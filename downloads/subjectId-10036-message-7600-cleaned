My Q for DACG is why are they public? Their 10K statement doesn't reflect the
reality that the competition is mostly private, and it is a lucrative business
that doesn't really benefit from being public. Like most law firms. They make
enough money, thank you, and are rich enough without going public and assuming
the overhead of that particular option.

Michael, re. CHB and CMH, you are correct and I was wrong. CMH has a bigger
market cap.

Fortunately, I can pass the buck to MarketGuide, which lists CHB as the largest
in its sector.
http://yahoo.marketguide.com/mgi/ratio/1763A.html
MarketGuide lists CMH in a different sector. I didn't notice this until you
pointed out my error.

Both stocks have approximately 9 or 10 analysts who make estimates, so I still
think my point, that the industry is not under-followed and therefore not in
severe need of a 'catalyst,' remains true.

I still like CMH better, because of the less-attractive balance sheet and cash
flow for CHB. Otherwise the two are highly correlated and there is little to
distinguish them.

John,

because of the less-attractive balance sheet and cash flow
for CHB

You see that your negative cash flow is the result of working capital changes
in the midst of explosive growth, no? Personally, with companies growing so
quickly and experiencing big jumps in sales, I don't punish cash flow with
working capital changes, since that negative disappears when the growth becomes
less aggressive. CHB is just funding its growth with its cash flow and a little
bit of debt added on to a balance sheet that had been pristine and
underleveraged. William Young is supposed to be a very good manager who is not
overaggressive financially, so I admit I am putting some faith in this.

Too, with the "negative net tangible assets," this is an improper use of this
measure IMO. If a company has net negative tangible assets after a series of
goodwill-producing acquisitions (as CHB has done to get into retail and certain
production niches), but manageable debt, then I fail to see where this is a
negative. Maybe it would come into play if the business were being liquidated,
but not for an ongoing concern. If anything, as long as earnings are strong and
the acquisitions accretive, it shows there is some value in the
branding/location/distribution that is being accounted for as goodwill.

Mike
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:6/28/1999 1:04:00 AM
From:Q.

Yes, Mike, I am well aware that rapid growth can result in negative cashflow,
and I understand goodwill.

As I have pointed out, the two stocks are highly correlated.
http://www.tscn.com/wsc/Corporate_Snapshot.html?Timespan=260&TSym=CMH,CHB&PH=2
So there is little reason to favor one over the other.

Since I wanted to buy only one stock, I needed a criterion. The choice is not
critical, for the reason I mentioned above, but I needed to choose just the
same. I selected my criterion, and that was balance sheet and cash flow.

If you prefer to make your criterion growth, then you will choose the other
stock. It is obvious that growth can result in a less attractive balance sheet
and cash flow.

Everybody has to make their own choice, in how they weigh one against the
other. How much emphasis they put on growth.

I'm not going to stoop to using invective adjectives, like "improper", to
describe an analysis simply because it approaches the choice from a different
personal objective.

DACG: <<why are they public?>> This is not a question I generally look at, but
here are some ideas:
Limited liability - Some ERP installations have failed spectacularly with ugly
impacts all around. Legal SOP is sue everyone involved. Perhaps top management
wanted to protect personal assets. Law firms don't have option of incorporating
to avoid liability, I believe. Same for accounting firms.

Seeking higher valuation - When they went public ERP was catching seriously
high multiples and y2k impact wasn't on the screen. Perhaps owners wanted these
multiples and opportunity to cash out portion of holdings.

Using shares to acquire private entities..consolidation - This strategy was
more popular when they went public than current.

Stature of being public company may have elevated them above private companies
they compete with - Perhaps important to Fortune 500 types they sell to.

Stock options to reward key employees may have been facilitated by going
public...retention of key employees, the main asset of such a biz, is key
issue.

All the above is speculation on my part, of course.

One of the interesting ERP trends that may play to DACG's advantage is the
shift in emphasis towards front office, customer-focused info-aps. Siebel
Systems seems to be leading here. The result is that companies will often end
up with SAP backbone ERP, Siebel or some other front end, and some other stuff
to connect and fill in the blanks. Since the application providers offer
training and are thus competitors, I would think an independent would be
preferable for end to end training projects with multiple applications...to tie
it all together. And training would seem to be a mission-critical aspect to
these complex installations...If the employee's don't know what they're
doing...the outcomes will almost certainly fall short.

will consult with their suprvisers overnight. In the meantime I had to leave

CQB is a dog. I used to own it for many years many years ago and lost $$. Every

while the market has quadrupled or better. For some reason it and DOL (the
other large US importer of bananas) cannot or will not divide up the market
where each can make a good profit. I am somewhat skeptical the Americans will
get into Europe and sell a lot of bananas due to some EU edict. However, maybe
this is the time for a turnaround as you suggest. They used to have a preferred
stock that paid a better dividend; don't know if that is still outstanding.

commodity driven trades you read about in the news releases work out well.

Today was a mixed bag for me, but I'm betting quite a few of you did well
thanks to an interesting phenomenon in the last 15 minutes today. Several of
our value stocks- Steelcase, Varian Medical, Midway, USEC, Borders Group and
others- jumped rather immensely and unexpectedly to finish off the day. Funny
thing is it didn't start with the Fed announcement, but was rather delayed a
little over an hour and then all happened in a few minutes. Never seen anything
so broad in number and compacted in time before.

FWIW, I did take a position in Washington Mutual, an S&L which has grown rather
well over the past decade, but spent the last few years in acquisitions and
bloating the balance sheet. It recently announced it was going to temper some
of its activities in order to squeeze more efficiencies out of its sizable
assets rather than bloating them some more. Banks have been under some
pressure. WAMU just moved into my neighborhood and made me take notice.
Interestingly, there is less interest rate risk to WAMU than one would think.

Today I also added more Champion, trimmed Oracle (on a valuation basis) and
eliminated LaSalle (on a valuation basis).

I suspect CHB's relative multiple is moving to be more in line with its
relative debt level. I've seen this before recently with the oils, just as they
were putting in a bottom - the ratios among the stocks line up according to
safety in the event of a doomsday scenario. IMO, most of the housing stocks,
manu housing, RV, construction products, and that ilk have been doing this this
last 3 months.

To be honest, I hesitated a bit in buying more Champion. I already own National
RV and several other stocks that are likely to be affected by the same
macrotrends as CHB. But basically, my portfolio has grown significantly this
year, and the average position size has grown proportionately. My older
Champion position was the smallest in my portfolio, which didn't fully
represent its true position in terms of relative appreciation potential, so I
upgraded it. I feel I have a good level in the 18's where the downside is
severely limited. True, the stock movement has been bearish, but it has only
fallen back to old support. It has bounced rather sharply off this level
several times. If CHB moves to new lows, I will be exiting the stock. Not a
value investor-like thing to do, but to close below 17 would be a very
difficult thing for this stock to do. If it happens, I'm probably not aware of
something, I'll have a small loss and that'll be that. Gone are the days when I
impale myself averaging down in an underperforming, technically damaged
position (I hope).

There's a big difference between the ag equipment and the manufactured
homebuilding industries and that is that there is a major recession going on in
ag right now. Homebuilders of any stripe are going to enjoy the strong consumer
economy even if interest rates turn up a bit. Barring a recession, I don't
think we see another major leg down in the Claytons or Champions. The others in
the industry are much weaker players and are by nature more speculative. In a
recession, could we see something closer to book value? Of course. But that is
where Clayton really shines - they have recurring revenue streams on the
financing and community businesses. It would have to be the kind of downturn
that breaks through Clayton's conservative credit margin of safety. And in that
case, you're dead in just about any other stock as well.

I am waiting with interest to see whether Clayton and Champion make their
quarters. For Clayton at least, missing a quarter is a very unusual event.

And Mike, I like the spirit of your screen, and I do something very similar but
with one difference I consider a major one. Rather than last five years return
on capital, I use last ten years. Sounds like a minor quibble, but this weeds
out much of what you're finding - cyclical companies that have had a great five
year run but which got murdered in the last recession. When I screen for good
businesses that are cheap, I generally look for three things in the business:
1)ROE through a cycle greater than 15%, 2) High profit margins, 3) Significant
free cash flow - then on valuation: 1) P/E less than ROE; 2) Free cash flow
yield greater than the long bond yield.

I don't know if these came out of this particular screen, but things like
Herman Miller, Hon Industries, Payless Shoesource and Lancaster Colony might be
attractive if you look for similar criteria.

James, here is the Southern Energy reference:

http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/990702/tr.html

I do not care if there is a major recession in manufactured housing as in ag. A
50% miss might as well be one. In my opinion, if ALMOST ALL these companies
miss, ALL will be taken out and shot to a greater or lesser degree.

I still think it is an interesting industry to watch.

Southern Energy is a minor player in this industry - I had never heard of them

you'd really have to question whether we're on the right page on long term
valuation. But to extrapolate Southern Energy to Clayton is a stretch.

Huh? That isn't what the screen found. JLG and CXP I'll give you. They're
definitely cyclical. NVH and MAIR maybe, but there's definitely a big growth
component as well. Tidewater is going through its own recession and is still
profitable. Fair Isaac is as consistent as they come and one might argue that a
recession with increased credit risks could help them. The others are hardly
big cyclicals. I find software and consultying cos punished because of the Y2K
lull, clothing, a new industry in PPD, a lottery company, and health supplement
concerns. Maybe you saw a few cos and made a quick judgement. But this screen
did not produce a list loaded with cyclicals. If it did, I wouldn't feel the
need to post it or publish it.

BTW, you're an institution. Read my disclaimer. I give that you have greater
screening capacity than me. I don't have easy or free access to quality 10 year
or 20 year databases. I might use them if I did.

Hon and Herman Miller aren't cyclical? Somebody'd have to convince me. Payless
may be good in a recession, but it doesn't look like they're doing so well in a
boom time. Lancaster fails my growth tests otherwise it'd be on there.

A classic value investing example. SFLX went below cash/share. The theory is if
it went below cash, it is a buy. I did exactly that. Picked up 6000 shares
around 3.25, then 4000 at 2 11/16.
That happened 1.5 months ago. They announced in merger talks and SFLX is 5 1/2

You're right. Something else you had in your screen must have weeded out the

re: inventory glut in manufactured housing. One thing I might add here is that
in its most recent 10K Champion indicates it sees excess inventory in certain

Re: value investing plaything

As much contrarian as value investing, I bought back into WHX in a small way
today. They are so leveraged they did not rally with the other steels earlier
this year. But they didn't fall at all with the recent bad news. Gabelli
apparently is still buying them, and LaBow is a particularly tenacious value

still feel they can be valued as I've posted on the WHX boards here and on

I continue to like ALSC and added to my position today. It looks like book
value before allowing for taxes will be around $20 when the restructure of the
foundry investments is completed, the semiconductor business is turning up and
the company has new products out. Hard for me to see any medium term downside,
unless the foundry restructuring fails to go through. My perception is the
company is worth at least $20 now. Although this is not a net net situation it
is kind of close because its investments will be monetized by the end of the
year and then the company has to hold them for 6 more months before selling
them. I am hopeful that the company will figure out a way to spin them off to
its shareholders on a tax free basis. Otherwise I think someone could buy the
company with its own assets.
BTW looks like the MM is taking DSWL higher again! send me a pM next time you

We had an interesting discussion on the thread with the Needham analyst who
downgraded the stock then upgraded it a week later. He said that his downgrade
was based on a valuation being less than 35% above the market price. After the
stock dropped and he raised his valuation he upgraded. Of course with the
subsequent improvement in the price of the stock he should have downgraded it
again unless he has again increased his valuation of the company. Haven't seen
a new downgrade yet!

GZSP at $3 9/16: Believe it or not selling at perhaps 40% of net working

is pretty interesting despite the warts.

Notes: Principal source of pressure is that many institutional owners of GENZ
who got this as dividend can't own it by their charter. Net-net will be
shrinking for quite some time due to continuing losses from R&D efforts but, in
my opinion, even if the next 5 years' R&D is a total flop, liquidation value at
that time should still be considerably larger than the current price (extra
margin of error). Has $100 million of sales mostly from a real surgical device
business.

Well, bye-bye to Champion for me. It looks like a new closing low today, and I
said I would sell at the new low. So I stuck to it. Hope it gets ridiculously
cheap. If not, well, I get the tax loss as a consolation - and I could use it.
Thinking of buying Clayton to stay in the sector, but am willing to be patient.

Meanwhile, used the proceeds to buy Keane (KEA). It's one of those Y2K stocks
that ran up furiously last year. It and Analysts International (ANLY) both made
my screen last week. Managers of both companies give clear, specific reasons
for their difficulty - loss of Y2K revenue AND delay of non-Y2K revenue.
Keane's managers say that they expect to resume 25% top-line growth (and 25+%
bottom-line growth) after the Y2K bump is passed. There's been some insider
buying. ANLY has a lot more insider buying, and its managers too say that they
will resume historical growth once Y2K is passed.

Interesting to me is that both of these companies have been creating
shareholder value steadily for years, but only in the last couple did they
become stars. Keane had more Y2K work than ANLY, and is five times larger. My
thinking is Keane got a lot of contacts and leads out of its Y2K work, which
can only help going forward. The ANLY situation is similar, but on a smaller
scale. Keane has hit some economies of scale, with 30+% ROE and high ROA with
good margins. I think you could bet on either horse. The stocks basically move
together. ANLY pays a decent dividend. I went with the larger concern, whose
managers own 20% of the stock already, mainly because I don't need the
dividend. Valuations on both are remarkably similar.

BTW, Fair Isaac looks higher for some reason. Anyone find a reason?

Peter, I think if you read all the posts and references on the GZSP
SI thread, plus all of my posts on GZSP on the Yahoo GENZ thread (no separate
thread) you will be fully informed.

I particularly recommend the roadshow verbal and slide show which is one of the
URL references on the GZSP thread and the prospectus. Collier's roadshow
presentation will leave you scratching your head as to the current price.

My latest post on Yahoo is the best statement of my view on the valuation:
http://messages.yahoo.com/bbs?action=m&board=7076856&tid=genz&sid=7076856&mid=7
2&amp ;

The surgical device business IS worth double the current price and the biotech
business with $150 million cash IS worth more than zero, even if it may cause
the company to lose up to $10 million each quarter this year. (Note, the
roadshow presentation forecast 15% sales growth this year and 20% next, with
profitability in 3 years and cash flow positive before then.)

The key technical short term issue is what market clearing price is required to
take care of all the stock that institutions that got it as dividends do not
want. My estimate based on the GZMO trading last year is that it will be seen
within two weeks and within no more than 1/2-1 point of here. I think there is
even a 25% chance that 3 5/16
was it today, but I doubt it.

I am beginning to try to understand tracking stocks, after jeffrey generously

My understanding is that holders of tracking stocks have a claim on the assets
of the parent company, just the same as common shareholders of the parent.

But how could this hold up in court? If the majority of GZSP shareholders
requested the assets to be spun-off, wouldn't they win the day? Of course, if
the parent continues to hold the majority of the tracking stock shares, this is
a moot point.

Peter, I never thought that EDS stock failed to get a reasonable valuation
because it was a GM tracking stock for many years. In my opinion, the critical
issue is whether the parent company is stable.

In addition, I have written several times on GZMO, which is NOT a value stock,
that the performance of the tracking stock assets (owned by GENZ) is materially
enhanced by the close ties to the parent company and the expertise it can bring
to the table versus being a true independent company.

A pure, small biotech company benefits immensely from the manufacturing,
regulatory, legal, financial and other resources available through the larger
parent. For example, GZMO got the new Folkman compound because of the parent's
expertise, not their own.
This is less true with the GZSP surgical device business, but how much extra
discount does a tracking stock deserve? (EDS got none.)

I would maintain that the value of the protections/advantages offered by the
larger parent versus the lack of them for most $100 million sales companies
balances the reduced control over the assets and the exposure to the risk of
the large parent inherent in the tracking stock.

technical circumstances surrounding the institutional ownership of GENZ, and
the issues of the disadvantages of a tracking stock versus the parent company
help, created an opportunity which fully met, in my opinion, the parameters we
try to get in a value investment.

However, I would only give it 1 in 3 odds that this frog will turn into a $20

Jeff: Manufactured Housing...stocks sensitive to hints of bad news. Scuttlebutt
in the industry has been that when the economy catches cold this group catches
pneumonia. This exacerbates negative reactions. The industry has a few big
players, some of whom, like Fleetwood, according to Jim, aren't renowned as the
best managed, and a slew of smaller relatively unsophisticated players [Most
are private]. This structure and a dip from peak demand can lead to inventory
overshoot which takes a bit to be corrected even if the demand dip is
temporary.
Financing may also play into the demand situation. I recall Greentree got
caught playing Fun With Numbers and they were major credit supplier. A somewhat
more cautious lending community could curtail sales.
Bottom line: This is not a bad time to start phasing in on dips for a patient
investor willing to ride out a series of "buying opportunities" down the road,

line in the financials. It trashed operating cash flow the first quarter [vs
earnings].
Any thoughts as to what this might be before I call IR?

re HSTR: yes, I looked at it. Came across a semi-favorable article. To me they
are almost a mini CMH (mfger, retail sales, and finance). Financials look very
favorable to me. Very aggressive acquirer apparently. I had passed on the stock
because I thought maybe they had too much Texas exposure, plus I myself am
already VERY exposed (--g--). That is, I already own stocks in almost every
aspect of the 'home' segment. (I've posted here on most of them.)

Starting a very small position in Resource Bancshares Mtg. (RBMG)

A mortgage originator. Ergo, not a very good place apparently for an investor
to invest.

Growing sales rapidly (imo). Selling at 10 1/2 with a bv of about 11.5. PSR
about .65 vs. double that in previous years. Insider buys. 4% dividend yield.

Wallace Weitz, interviewed in "Bottom Line Personal" (6/15/99, p.4) is quoted
as saying: "The company should earn about $2 per share - which makes it a value
stock in my book." I agree. (although I'm not able to predict $2/sh.)

FWIW.
