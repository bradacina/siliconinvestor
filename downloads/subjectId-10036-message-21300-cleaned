HELE not so good news:

The company forecast sales of $615 million to $640 million in fiscal year 2006,
which began March 1, up from $581.5 million in fiscal year 2005, and earnings
per share of $2.50 to $2.60, up from $2.35.

But analysts on average forecast $2.85 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Profit in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Feb. 28 was $12.0 million, or 37
cents a share, compared with $7.52 million, or 23 cents, in the comparable
period a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected the company to earn about
37 cents according to Reuters Estimates.

Sales rose 13 percent to $127.6 million from a year earlier, beating analyst
expectations of $120 million.

The El Paso, Texas, company in February had lowered its earnings forecast to
between 35 cents and 45 cents per share, from earlier guidance of 58 cents to
63 cents. Helen also revised its sales forecast to $120 million, down from $136
million to $146 million.

Down 10% as I write, to Oct. lows.

$1 billion buys a say

MARCELENE EDWARDS; The News Tribune
Originally published: May 10th, 2005 12:01 AM

An East Coast investment adviser who just spent more than $1 billion on
Weyerhaeuser Co. stock might want the company to sell or spin off its
timberlands.

No one knows for sure what David Winters, president and chief investment
officer of New Jersey-based Franklin Mutual Advisors, wants the Federal
Way-based timber giant to do.

But analysts speculate he might suggest Weyerhaeuser make some money from the
millions of acres of trees it owns.

The fund Winters manages started buying stock in March and has accumulated a 7
percent stake in the forest products company. He has made one thing clear: The
stock price is too low.

Over the past year, Weyerhaeuser has traded between $55 (hit a year ago today)
and $71 (reached in April). It closed Monday at $66.90.

“I just read the annual report and realized it’s undervalued,” Winters said.
“Wall Street doesn’t appreciate it much.”

He wants to meet with company executives to suggest how the company could
improve. But he won’t share his suggestions – yet.

“It’s rare that you find a company with executives whose hearts and minds are
in the right place,” he said. “My thoughts are, there are things they can do
over time to surface the value.”

Weyerhaeuser spokesman Bruce Amundson said the company could not comment due to
Security and Exchange Commission guidelines.

The company issued a statement in late April that said executives were open to
discussing new strategies.

That might be because Franklin is now the second largest shareholder in
Weyerhaeuser, behind Capital Research and Management Co. of Los Angeles, which
owns 31.3 million shares.

Franklin now owns 17 million shares.

Once someone accumulates that much stock, companies tend to pay attention to
their opinions, said Steven Chercover, an analyst with D.A. Davidson in Lake
Oswego, Ore.

Weyerhaeuser owns 5.7 million acres of land in the United States and holds
long-term leases on 30.4 million acres of public land in Canada.

During the last couple of years, the company has been selling small pieces of
its timberlands in the Northwest and in the southern United States.

“Investors are looking at this sector as an opportunity to unlock value,” said
Mark Wilde, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York. “They
may want to separate timber assets from operational assets.”

That could mean spinning off the timberlands into a real estate investment
trust, or REIT, and keeping the paper mills and lumber mills where they are.

Winters has a history of buying big enough pieces of companies to give him a
say in how they are managed.

During the past four years, Franklin Mutual Advisors has become the largest
shareholder at Spokane-based Potlach Corp. Winters suggested that the company
sell some of its assets.

In that time, the company sold its coated paper business and its oriented
strand board business.

“We wanted them to become more proactive to surfacing the value,” Winters said
of Potlatch.

Shares of Potlatch rose from $20 in early 2003 to nearly $50 this week.

Following Franklin’s announcement about Weyerhaeuser on April 29, Weyerhaeuser
stock went up $3 a share to $68.61. On Monday, shares closed at $66.90, down 61
cents.

Analysts are skeptical that Weyerhaeuser would be interested in separating the
trees from the mills.

“(CEO Steve) Rogel is a guy who thinks a lot of the value is in the forests,”
Wilde said. “I am pretty cautious about whether Franklin is going to get
Weyerhaeuser to separate the timberlands.”

And splitting up the company might not be a good idea. Many of Weyerhaeuser’s
businesses are cyclical, which means they can swing with the economy. When one
business is having an off year, another business can absorb some of the
decline.

A company with lumber mills, paper mills, real estate and timberlands is
stronger than any of those businesses on their own, analysts say.

Other big timber companies also have considered the spin-off strategy recently.

International Paper and Longview Fiber have publicly considered selling or
spinning off timberland. Seattle-based Plum Creek is a timberland company only.

The key for Franklin will be getting other shareholders to agree with whatever
suggestion Winters makes and then getting Rogel to agree, Chercover said.

“If you can realize some short-term shareholder value, all the other
shareholders vote for it,” he said.

WHERE THE TREEES ARE

Timberland acres owned or leased by Weyerhaeuser in the United States:

Washington: 1.14 million
Oregon: 1.12 million
Louisiana: 1 million
Mississippi: 778,000
Arkansas: 727,000
North Carolina: 560,000

Since you mentioned QC Holdings, you might want to take a look at DLLR. It is a
little different company from the others in the sector. First of all, on 38% of
their business is in the US. 57% originates from Canada and the UK. Only four
stores are located in Texas. They have a dominant share of the business in the
UK and Canada. In the UK they are six to seven times larger than their nearest
competitor.

The company has averaged 16% EBIDAT growth the last four years. The company
recently came public. In their latest quarter, if you add back the one time
charges for coming public, they would have earned 42 cents this quarter. The
company recently raised their EBIDAT estimates for this year to 75 to 76
million. Their corporate tax rate is roughly 42 percent.

Furthermore, they have an interesting acquisition with WE THE PEOPLE, a
document preparation company which specializes in documents for bancruptcies,
divorces, wills, living wills and incorporating. This is how I originally got
interested n the company as WE THE PEOPLE started in Santa Barbara, where I
live, and has grown rapidly. Currently, there are 172 stores, with fifty stores
in CA and 30 stores in NY. They are currently located in 32 states. The company
thinks the concept can be expanded to Canada and the UK. This is a mini-HR
Block type business that could benefit those who don't think they need the
services of an attorney.

The company states that the current regulatory questions only puts 8 to 10
million at risk. So I think this company offers an interesting risk/reward
ratio at its current price of 9.75.

It was a great place to find value the last 5 years, but it's much tougher
today. It's a cyclical industry and current MHC IPO appraisals are finally now
coming down to more realistic levels, so we may see some real bargains again.

Hudson City's massive second stage offering now in progress has sucked the

I was hoping that you could add a bit of color to your comment(s).

While the P/E ratio of the market is pushing 20x ttm EPS and corporate profit
margins are at their peak, interest rate still remain low (even in the face of
the fed raising rates) and, furthermore, interest rates are still pretty low.

As such, it doesn't appear at least to me that the market, in general, is

as dale often says, generalized "market" comments are usually just someone's
guesses or biases...this reply you elicited from this poster is an even further
generalized comment, i.e. useless

what matters is what you own, and how it is doing and will do longer term

IMHO it's much more productive to focus on that, rather than some SI poster who
just posts doom and gloom...it's the same as someone who is continually
bullish, but has no track record or specific advice

over the past few years, the two main lessons i have learned are to avoid
focusing too closely on the "market" itself, and to go against the
crowd...i.e., buy when everyone is scared and selling, and sell when everyone
else is euphoric...also interesting that the more i read of the thoughts and
practices of the best stock market participants over the years, the more i find
this among their best ideas as well

<Interest rates are still pretty low.>

The Fed has raised the Fed Funds Rate to 3%. But the vast US bond market is not
responding to this treatment. Short-term market interest rates have gone up
somewhat, but the long end has not, and that is a HUGE economic signal. It
signals that the US bond market sees the current US economic situation as being
close to a real economic recession.

The S@P is trading at 20 times trailing net earnings. That pretty much
represents a record.

Moreover, if you analyze multiples like price/revenues, price/book or
price/dividends, you'll discover that current multiples are much higher than
their respective historical averages.

Sure, there are a small percentage of equities that are trading at decent
valuations. In a real secular bear market, only 10%-15% of stocks will rise and
NO asset class will outperform cash. Don't let your typical run of the mill
money manager or huckster tell you otherwise.

The average Joe should either have his money in cash or with an extremely
astute bear market conscious money manager.

The few money managers I respect are currently either in huge cash positions
(50%) or are hedged their long equity positions by shorting the indices.

re CBH (Fool article):
the article in Motley Fool raises some valid points regarding CBH. I indeed
think that they are correct stating that CBH's profitability is mediocre, as
measured per ROA. A steady well managed bank should operate at a ROA>1% and an
efficiency ratio of <50%. However CBH is not a "Steady bank" they are rapidly
growing; the deposit growth was almost 30%! CBH's business model is to gather
deposits (the cheapest source if funding for S&L's) offering superior service
to customers. I conclude from CBH's deposit growth that they are successfully
executing this plan. The somewhat high efficiency ratio is alleviated by the
fact that CBH is expanding rapidly by opening "de novo" branches, which
naturally leads to upfront costs.

CBH's 1.5% loss reserve is in the same ballpark than other banks like BAC
despite lower loan losses so far and higher than the 1.1% reserve of SOV, which
Barron touted a few weaks ago.

So, my opinion is that CBH's business model works even though they are not (and
probably never will be) achieving stellar return on capital. However it appears
to me that they can finance 20% growth going forward, which at a current
valuation is enough to entice me to a starter position.

CBH's efficency ratio is high than everyone else because its branches are
almost twice the size of its competitors.

As the bank matures, the market is asigning a lower PE multiple to its stock
price in anticipation of lower growth going forward.

Losses relating to its loan portfolio are very low. I think they can only go up
from here. I think that's becomes more of a problem in 2006.

A new column on Icahn buying RAD:

May 17, 2005 (The Patriot-News - Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News via
COMTEX) -- An investment group managed by billionaire investor Carl Icahn has
taken a financial interest in Rite Aid Corp.

Icahn's stake in the East Pennsboro Twp.-based drugstore chain comes on the
heels of his victorious proxy fight to gain a seat on the Blockbuster Inc.
board of directors and his ability to thwart an acquisition by Mylan
Laboratories Inc. of Canonsburg.

Rite Aid is one of a dozen companies listed as investments by Icahn Management
LP, a hedge fund, in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Friday.

According to the document, Icahn Management owned 10 million shares of Rite Aid
as of March 31, or about 1.9 percent of the company. Carl Icahn is one of the
investors in the hedge fund. It is not known whether Icahn Management has
increased or decreased its Rite Aid investment since March 31.

Rite Aid spokeswoman Karen Rugen said the company does not comment on its stock
price and "we don't comment on people who invest in the stock." She noted that
"people invest in our company all the time."

Evan Mann of Gimme Credit, a New York firm that does corporate bond research
for institutional investors, said Icahn's Rite Aid investment "certainly peaked
my interest." Mann noted that Icahn "tends to be a more proactive investor."

The question is whether Icahn "has something up his sleeve or does he just
think the stock is cheap," Mann said.

Rite Aid stock closed Monday at $3.94 a share, down 3 cents. It is up about 7
1/2 percent for the year.

Icahn became known as a corporate raider in the 1980s through his hostile
takeover of TWA. Lately, he has taken an active investment role in companies
such as Blockbuster Inc. and Mylan Laboratories, a generic drug manufacturer.

Last week, Icahn and two associates were elected to the Blockbuster board as
dissident directors. He owns about 9 percent of Blockbuster.

Earlier in the year, Icahn prevailed over Mylan, which called off its planned
acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals for $4 billion.

At both Blockbuster and Mylan, Icahn has questioned the compensation packages
for the CEOs.

Rite Aid reported sales of $16.8 billion for the fiscal year that ended Feb.
26. It posted earnings of $302.5 million, up 262 percent from the year before.
However, sales have been sluggish of late and are lagging behind its two main
competitors, Walgreen Co. and CVS Corp.

Mann has expressed concern that an "underinvestment" in Rite Aid's store base
is "rapidly eroding its competitive position."

Rite Aid has initiated a store-development program in the past 18 months. It
expects to open 80 new and relocated stores in the current fiscal year and
remodel 200 other stores.

Walgreen, meanwhile, is essentially opening a new store every day, while CVS
significantly expanded its business last summer with its acquisition of 1,250
Eckerd drugstores in the South.

CAT news:

NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) on Tuesday said machinery
and engine sales each rose 20 percent in April from a year earlier.

Retail machine sales were helped by strong sales in Asia/Pacific and Latin
America, with sales up 22 percent in Asia, compared with a 13 percent rise in
March. In Latin America machinery sales grew 65 percent, compared with 57
percent growth in March, the company said on its Web site.

Analysts said the sales figures were strong, despite tough comparisons from a
year ago. 

"April retail sales were impressive, especially considering (the) recent
slowdown in certain machinery names and a general softening in the industrial
economy," JP Morgan analysts said in a research note.

In the engine business, sales of petroleum engines jumped 25 percent, compared
with a 13 percent increase in March, while sales of industrial, marine, truck
and bus engines declined slightly. Electric Power engine sales rose 23 percent,
compared with a 15 percent increase in March, and 35 percent rise in February.

April dealer inventories were 36 percent higher than a year earlier, the
company said.
 (Per Prudential, when adjusting for higher sales unit volume, months of sales
in inventory decreased 8% YOY.)

And if this transportation bill gets past the White House I would think this
would be beneficial long term for CAT as lots of spending will follow for
highway construction.

WASHINGTON, May 17 - The Senate overwhelmingly approved a $295 billion highway
and mass transit bill this afternoon, setting up a showdown with the White
House, which has called for a bill $11 billion smaller.

The 89-to-11 vote reflected the desire of most of the lawmakers, regardless of
party, for more road and transit dollars for their states, especially since the
last big road-and-transit aid program is set to expire at the end of the
month....

Senator James Jeffords, independent of Vermont, urged Mr. Bush to reconsider
his veto threat. "This bill will have an impact on every city and every town
and every state," he said. Mr. Jeffords is the minority leader on the
Environment Committee.

world's lowest cost producers of copper, net of gold and moly," said David
Cohen, President and CEO of Northern Orion. "Our recent equity issue of
approximately $101.6 million is a major springboard in the financing of the
Agua Rica project, which together with our Alumbrera income, provides the final
required equity for its development. Financing discussions with bankers and
smelter groups are progressing well, and we expect to announce the hiring of an
experienced Agua Rica project development executive and the scoping study on
Agua Rica within the next three weeks."

RBK: Brendan Watt, fwiw, I've got Reebok on my watch list since your mention,
and I've been hemming and hawing on this one. Downgrade by Prudential today is
somewhat strange to me. "The stock has outperformed the group and the market
over the last six months." That's so, but the stock has also been dropping, so
I wonder why the downgrade comes now.

On some measures NKE is also attractive (e.g. relatively low forward p/e). To
me it's the old story of what do you want to buy, the powerhouse company in the
sector (Nike, with its superior margins), or the relatively cheaper(compared to
NKE) RBK (e.g. lower margins than NKE but much better (lower and decent)
forward p/e - as you mention). I lean toward starting an exploratory position
in RBK, which to me is more a value play; maybe both companies might be buys
though at current price.

SHRP. Had exited positions from portfolios in past few months. Now back in this
afternoon with just an exploratory position.

Bad earnings report. Plus, Ionic Breeze, which does or doesn't work depending
on whom one talks to, is not doing well, and this product is/was their very
prominent profit driver (I am led to believe).

However, the stock is now at a price (after hours) of under $11, and with no
ltd and $6/sh in cash and a stated b.v. of $13 (before today's earnings loss),
there's room for the company to maneuver and maybe overcome some of its
problems.

I've held this stock for several years in various amounts up until a few months
ago. I expect I may be holding these few shares purchased after-hours today,
plus some added to later on average-down, also for a few years.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&s=PMMAY.PK

It trades almost negligible numbers of shares a day so liquidity is clearly a
concern, but alot of metrics look good

- margins have risen solidly over the past few, although leveling out currently
- no long term debt
- PE 12
- sales per share are slowing vs. previous year's levels, but still up 14+% in
past year
- ROE in range of 50%
- strong cashflow

I'd probably have bought 10 or 20 shares myself if not for the low liquidity

From the new lows list, I'll take a few shares of Lindsay Manufacturing (LNN),
a manufacturer of irrigation systems for farmers.

This year's not going to be good for LNN's business, it seems. Prices for LNN's
raw materials have increased, and LNN is attempting to pass these along to
their customers. But farmers and their lenders are balking - putting off their
purchases.

http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/050324/irrigation_equipment_1.html

I'm betting demand is still there, and eventually LNN will see customers
spending again. The company is debt-free (according to Yahoo) and perhaps has
enough cash on hand to wait for better times. For investors, there's a small -
1.2% - dividend yield while they wait.

According to Yahoo, Third Avenue Management - the "safe and cheap" guys - are
the largest institutional holder. Among mutual fund owners, Neuberger & Berman
Fasciano Fund is in (or was in), also according to Yahoo. (Several media
reports have described Mr. Fasciano's apparent stock picking prowess.)

A revision-to-mean bet, I'm looking to see the $17.70 stock sell again at
$25-26 within the next 18-24 months. That's a level at which the stock has
traded several times over the past five years:

Still holding ANF since it was first mentioned here in 1999. Continue holding
because underlying fundementals steadily improving, various discounted cash
flow valuations, with wide ranging valuations, leads me to conclude the company
is fairly priced to mildly undervalued, no other investement alternatives at
present, and, further to avoid paying capital gains.

P/S ratio is a bit rich these days. The company generates lots of cash flow and
has a clean balance sheet. Whether this trendy retailer continues bucking the
trend is always the question.

To my amazement, Value Line purchased ANF for its Portfolio 1 (That is VL's
pics with above-average year-ahead price potential). VL notes ANF's strong
earnings growth over the past few years and believes near term financial
performance will "likely stay with the established trend." They also note good
demand for the company's traditional merchandise and also the Hollister
Division "ramping up nicely."

I don't consider ANF a value stock and view it as a Buffetology pick. High
returns on invested capital without incurring debt. I am unsure whether one can
say that ANF has a sustainable competative advantage. I always ask myself where
ANF will be in 20 years?

Management has steered ANF through many turbulent times while increasing
earnings at a 15%-20% clip which leads to some confidence in what the company
is doing and will continue doing the future. The new Holinger concept seems to
be successful and is the company's main source of growth. There is also another
concept, Rhule (sp) that the company is experimenting with and could be a good
source of future growth. Meanwhile, the original chain seems to be maintaining
well lately.

Given that my mortgage reits have rebounded nicely - just waiting for my bank
recs to come around - & given my historical record of almost always being right
- i'm recommending Citrix (CTXS) - closed today @ $24.49:

doing due dilig on Citrix - stock closed @ $24.49 - range is $15.02 to $26

&#183; per 1Q05 finl’s - released 4/20/05 - Citrix appears to running on all 8
cylyinders - revs for the 1/4 hit $202 mill - year over year qtrly growth of
25% - diluted eps of $.22 vs. .05 last yr - when revs go up 25% & earnings go
up 4-fold - generally means the co. has hit its economies of skill level &
earnings w/ keep growing

&#183; nice stock buyback - 2.6 mill shs repurchased - @ avg of $22.74 for $58
mill - another $200 mill to go - better yet - given Citrix’s enviable cash
position & close to $170 mill in annual inc - sizable buybacks can take place
going forward for a long time - wow - 2.6 mill shs works out to about 40,000
shares every trading day

&#183; for 2005 - gaap earnings projected to be .94 to .99; w/revs of betwen
$840-855 mill&#183; net inc for 2001 to 2003 was .54, .52, & .74 eps/diluted -
now they’re tracking to do at least $.94

&#183; Total revs for 2001 to ’03 was $591.6 mill, 527.4 mill, & 588.7 mill -
why the down yr in ’02 - i don’t understand - i don’t have the revs for ’04 -
but revs this yr are supposed to be at least $840 mill - this type of
profitable growth is exceptional

&#183; a little gem in the Bal Sheet - shows deferred revs of $239 mill on
3/31/05 - these are monies paid up front - that get amorized over the life of
the agreement - & the number is growing - from around $100 mill in ’02 - to
$165 mill in ’03 -

&#183; Citrix has products that companies want - they’re saying 160,000 orgs
user Citrix - Citrix runs in 100% of the Fort 100 cos; in over 100 countries; &
seems to be getting more customers by the hour

&#183; A quick glance of news stories on Google shows many companies &
organizations in the process of implementing a citrix solution due to the cost
savings - less man hours to maintain the network & user PCs don’t have to
upgraded as often

&#183; bottom line - at @24.49/shr - provided no one comes out with a better
mousetrap - i can easily see the earnings doubling along with the stock price
in the next 24 months

Hi Paul - I added to my pharmaceutical stocks by buying a position in PFE in
the $27 range. I bailed out on MRK earlier this year but never re-entered when
it was lower. I also like C and JPM and have been trying to set up a long term
straddle with both companies. I missed adding to C when it was around $45 and
will do so if we see a check back. My thinking is that once the Fed signals
that they have reached the end of the interest rate hikes, these money center
banks should be able to generate good profits from the spread in rates. My
special situation bank "NYB" should also benefit when rates stabilize because
they borrow long and lend short. They can lock in their loan returns w/o the
risk of higher long term rates.

I continue to like the shippers and believe both the bulk and oil carriers will
continue to do well as they service the growth in China and India. I own both
DRY's and SFL in this sector.

===================================================================
I have noticed in my neighborhood many remodel projects. There are four or five
houses on my street that are doing large projects and just driving around many
more are in process. It appears that you either are remodeling or have bought a
new house or 2nd home. Any idea on a value play that will take advantage of
this trend?

We talked about cement companies, home builders, the box stores (Home Depot &
Lowes) and even some of the specialty vendors (bathroom and fixture suppliers).
Can you or anybody else think of "Value" companies that would benefit from this
remodel upgrade trend. Based on the housing sales numbers and new housing
starts, this trend will continue for many months (maybe even a few years) as
long as interest rate remain near their all time lows. It's a global economy as
when I remodeled my bathroom, my toilet was made in China, the fixtures came
from Germany and my shower glass doors were made in Canada. Even my new
travertine stone was shipped from Italy. The only common thread in this theme
is that the shipping carriers will continue to see more activity. That is why I
added dry bulk carriers to my portfolio.

Maybe I missed something but you always seem to be alert to new "value"
opportunities so if anything comes up on your radar that fits in with this
"remodel" theme let's hear about it.

Okay, here's an update of the remodeling stocks I'm looking at:

HD: Holding. I've been in Home Depot since it was discussed here in '02. Home
Depot closed Friday at $39.63. Latest adds I made (I've sold no shares that I
remember)were 10/04, 12/04, 2/05, 3/05 @ $40.11, 42.12, 39.75, 39.75. At this
time I suspect there may be better opportunities in other stocks.

MAS: Possible Add. I've been in since 4/03. Poorer than expected earnings and
outlook dropped the stock recently. I didn't add more because I was (and am)
concerned that Mr. Manoogian (of the controlling family) sold $13M shares in
December. I believe I will add a little more though now. P/e on forward
earnings (projected by mgmt.) will be 12.8-13.3. That is very low historically
for this stock. As is current price/sales. For past 10 years, sales and div.
have increased every year. Home Depot is expanding (in some former K-mart
properties?), Masco is a big supplier to HD (Behr paint, etc.), so I originally
believed it would be very good for MAS as new HD stores were stocked with MAS
products. May turn out however, that HD new business won't be that significant
to MAS bottom line.

EXP. Holding. Spun out from homebuilder CTX. Sorry I didn't add more.

JJZ. Holding for evaluation. (My price target for remaining shares was $10 -
exceeded just recently with announcement of sale of losing Eljer unit.)

BMHC. Holding. In since '00. My pick vs. Jim Clarke's/Mike Burry's HBP.

(Sometimes ltb&h works even in what might be a cyclical business.)

HBP. Holding. I'm in since 10/04.

GFF: Holding. In since 9/00. Stock's come down to near 12-month low. May be
time to add a bit - not sure if want to.

TARR. Holding. (Remodels apartments into condo's)

IPII. Buying. Initial buys 12/04. Most recent buy 5/18/05 @ 9.18.
Low p/e, and growth in Florida market. (Might be a beneficiary if strong
hurricane predictions this year come true. - Or, otoh maybe it could wipe out
one of their Florida facilities.) I give this dink Florida-headquartered
company the benefit of the doubt given it has actively pursued its new listing
on the Nasdaq and its good earnings report.

WHR. Holding. I mentioned Whirlpool on the dividend investing thread, 5/5/05.

CX. Holding. Cement company. World-wide production, but Mexican-based and
dominant there. Have held this stock a few years, as have others on this
thread, I believe. Mentioned as one of three cheap foreign stocks in Motley
Fool article, 5/11.

BXC. Watching. Reported lower earnings. Price/sales looks good. Company
overloaded with debt (Yahoo figure). Cerberus Capital apparently invested in
the company and maybe helped bring it public. Couple announcements of recent
IPO's that failed - they were spun out apparently too quickly and with too much
debt. If I recall right, Cerberus was involved in one. BXC could be another
example.

TWP. Lookig at it now. Trex, mentioned by Shane M on Buffettology thread
yesterday. Stock might appeal to me on a GAARP basis.

Wow Paul, that's quite a list. Building Materials Holding Corp has an excellent
2yr and 5yr chart. In fact a lot of the companies that you have listed like
TARR have good five year appreciation. I wonder if I may be late to this party.

I do like WHR (especially with the recent news of Maytag being bought out by a
private party). WHR makes better products, has less debt and still is
relatively cheap at 11 times earnings with a very low price to sales ratio.
These manufactures still carry a lot of debt which can limit their upside gains
when sales turn down.

I used to own HD in the low $30's but sold it and agree with you that from a
"value" perspective there are probable better plays.

Thanks for your list.

muwis123, about Morgan Stanley. Somebody - I don't recall the post - gave me
their opinion several months ago that in their experience, MWD was run by
unscrupulous managers, so the company was suspect even at the then low price.
So I decided to pass on MWD. (Thanks whoever it was who alerted me!)

MWD is a substantial company. That's a positive. The company is likely to carry
on, and if so, at some point as the stock continues to drop, there ought to be
a value proposition.

MWD still will likely (imo) exhibit the same wall street culture - high
testosterone, overly aggressive, ethically bereft, self-serving norms - no
matter who comes in to replace the people who've left or who fills the spots of
those who are about to leave. That's a negative.

I will initiate a tiny exploratory position. At current price one gets - if
management's number's can be believed:

Stock under 2x book value. Only one year in past 10 has the year's average been
under 2.

Stated book value has increased every year for past ten.

Company is profitable every year in past 10, with profit margins always over
8%. That's very good, imo, given current stock price.

ROE has been higher in past years. At current level - which is maybe about 16%
before all the lawsuits come forth - the stock to me on this measure, might be
worth low $50's. (Currently $49+). In other words, no great bargain to me if my
basis were only this measure.

2% dividend yield.

Forward p/e - per Yahoo - is under 10. That'd be at the low end of its
historical average annual p/e.

You're welcome, muswis123. I don't have GNRL but I did buy a few shares of
another of your picks, DRL, today.

Still a murky situation, but maybe as price drops closer to stated book value
(assuming b.v. holds up - which might be a big assumption), then maybe we might
be near a bottom. In the innards of that company there still resides a real
business (I hope).

re Doral (DRL) valuation

- 110M shares = 1.54B$ market cap
- 3.6B$ deposits
- Earnings/share 2004 =4.23$ but this needs to be readjusted
- according to management 40% of earnings are not mortgage related = 1.7$/share
- IO restatement will reduce book value by 400M$ after tax. Adjusted book value
will be 1.55B$ = 14$/share

Gains on sale of Mortgage gains were 600M$ and incidentally or not?) 509M$ in
IO's were retained. I conclude the without IO's the Gains on mortgage sale
would essentially disappear. Thus, for valuation purposes, i value DRL's
mortgage operation at zero $. If that is the case and the remainder (sans IO)
of DRL's books are not cooked (a somewhat heroic assumption) a buyer at current
prices would basically by a bank at book value with a PE of 8.2. This would
make DRL's undoubtedly a value stock. The problem of course is the assumption
that DRl's books are clean, with the exception of the IO strip valuation.

I also looked at other Puerto Rican banks:RGF, which has somewhat similar
problems and OFG which has a pretty scary non-performing loan rate (3.87%) on
it's loans considering the booming real estate market but a much less leveraged
balance sheet.

With as many losing stocks as I have, I'd be surprised if I couldn't claim a
record on SI - an ignominious one albeit -g-.

OTL today unexpectedly lost a big customer for its main and obviously declining
product - lead additive for gasoline. That took the stock down a few points.

Among stocks at new annual lows there are my long-held SCRA and recent-purchase
DRL. I added a bit today to my position in PERY, which is again near its
12-month low.

All this mentioned to balance somewhat my comment that I expect shares of
often-discussed BL to be at a new high tomorrow (closed today about $36) given
that management announced after-hours today that they will thwart a takeover by
offering to buy about 50% of shares outstanding at $42.
-------
Fwiw, I added to my position in EPL. Kurt Wullf, who writes the well-respected
(well, respected by me anyway) McDep report which analyzes oil/gas stocks, has
a recommendation on this stock (as well a bunch more). Also EPL announced
yesterday several successful wells.

Also fwiw, I started an small exploratory position in TUNE. I am hoping they
will see improving profits from their involvement with digital tv tuners. Not a
value investment, but this dinky company has cash, no ltd, and sells about 2x
book value.

DRL downgraded this morning by UBS from a Buy to Neutral...
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:5/26/2005 9:55:17 AM
From:Carl Worth
actually it's not really a downgrade, as UBS pulled coverage a while back,
effectively going from a buy to a "we don't know" <g> briefing shows it as a
downgrade as the last stated rating was buy, but that was when the stock was in
the mid 40's, so UBS sure got that one right huh?

now they have resumed coverage at a hold, and stated that the stock could be 24
next year based on earnings, or 11 based on more writedowns

isn't that helpful? LOL

one problem with their report is that they state that DRL trades at 1.8X book,
which is way off...even after the I/O writedowns, the book value will be in the
neighborhood of 13 bucks

basically, like most analysts, they should have stayed with "we don't know"

this stock has been my worst holding by far so far in 2005, so take my opinion
with a grain of salt or less, but i think DRL will be back in the 20's by
2006...i actually added a little at 12.98 yesterday

here is the color of the UBS release, for whatever it's worth:

 Reinstating Coverage with Neutral 2 Rating -- Many Near-Term Concerns

* We see potential for additional writedowns:
Apart from DRL's estimate of $400m -$600m in I/O writedowns, we believe that
$50m - $75m of the company's mortgage servicing rights (MSR) could be at
risk. Similar to the I/O strips, prepayment speed assumptions used to value
the MSR are lower than U.S and local peers.

* Other concerns also increase risk of more negative news flow:
Apart from uncertainty related to DRL's financial restatement, we are also
concerned about 1) regulatory & legal risk 2) derivatives mgmt 3) interest
rate sensitivity 4) impact of proposed tax hike and 5) limited M&A play on
the company. Negative news flow could pressure the stock, which still trades
at a high P/B valuation (ex I/O writedowns).

* "Cash based' earnings analysis indicates longer-term value:
Ex. noncash gains/losses from Doral's I/O strips, MSR's and related hedges,
we estimate "cash based" EPS (CBEPS) of $1.50, $1.70 & $2.25 in '04,'05 &
'06. DRL's stock could thus be worth $24 in '06 using historical & peer
comps, if current issues are resolved in a timely manner.

* Valuation: $14 PT -- More weight on downside in near-term:
Doral is trading at 1.8x P/B versus 1.0x - 1.5x P/B typical of financial
stocks during periods of investor uncertainty. A P/B ratio in this range
gives an $11 price. A 75% weight towards the downside ($11), and 25% weight
to upside ($24), gives us a $14 12-month price target, and Neutral 2 rating.

re BSX, yet another chance to add to BSX at 28$. The lower earnings forecast
was somewhat expected, yet the stock takes another dive. At 28$, we are looking
at a PE or a little more than 14. Even more importantly, BSX appears to be
taking steps to develop the next blockbuster after stents. I consider to add to

Wachovia downgrades Doral Financial to 'underperform'
http://biz.yahoo.com/cbsmb/050527/6623808fa5d948d3b8196a2247f9212b.html?.v=1

By Steve Gelsi

NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Doral Financial drew a downgrade to underperform from
Wachovia Capital on Friday. Wachovia cited "significant potential liquidity and
interest rate risk" at the Puerto Rico-based mortgage lender. In addition to
matters surrounding a gain on sale accounting and the valuation of
interest-only securities, Doral is reviewing other matters that may require
restatement, including the accounting for the deferral and recognition of
mortgage origination fees and expenses and for lease payments, the note said.
The consequences of the company's restatement and reporting delay, "could be
quite severe," the note said.

Grommit, geez, I find your post here very unnerving -

"This week I moved my stock portfolio to be 40% Canadian Oil Sands
Companies..."

From my understanding of what I've read of your posts over the past years, that
is one strong call. You must be very sure of your research and conclusions to
be making what seems to me to be such a large and abrupt change.

Very ominous for other stocks, if you're THAT right about oil.

And you could be. I've certainly been upping my oil/gas/related positions over
the past year or so. And now they account for a nearly uncomfortably large
component of my portfolios. I've slowed down as these stocks have corrected,
but now maybe I best continue to add. Somewhat worrisome to me that I've
slipped here in this sector from trying to make value calls to making a macro
call - a macro call that appears reasonable, maybe obvious (therefore wrong?) -
yet even if true (oil prices are going up because scarcity increases), doesn't
necessarily have to translate that money can be made by buying these stocks
now.

Anyway, I upped my tiny position in PCZ today at open a little. They have an
oil sands component:

http://www.petro-canada.ca/eng/media/10317.htm

I also upped my exploratory position in rail roader, NSC, by a few shares too.

Holding shares of NXY, SU, and a tiny few of CNQ. I might add to CNQ if it
retracts a bit from today's good move
