Im trying to understand your thinking. Bear in mind that I know very little
about the oil and gas industry however after looking at the transcript of the
latest conference call, management indicated that the 9/30/06 number for gas of
$4.10 was unusually low and that was the number that impacted all the reserve
calculations. how did that number affect your analysis? I spent about 20
minutes going through the 10/26/06 transcript of the call and continue to be
impressed with the company. They are 74% hedged through Q1 07 at over $10 so
they will make good money that quarter either way, whether its costing them
$2.50 or $3.50. While I was not pleased about the current equity offering I
will live with it.

regarding CHK - i do not know all that much about the E&P industry as well but
i do know how to read a cash flow statement. With respect to CHK it is clear
that they are spending more than they take in, supposedly to increase their
reserves. This is fine in my opinion but it turns out that the aggressive
acquisitions tend to dilute shareholder value, since reserves/share are lower
now than thy have been 12/31/05. Feel free to check my numbers they are from
CHK's last presentation and their 10k. CHK tends to increase their sharecount
by 20% annually but their reserves have been growing less than that. the
increase in DDA expenses of 20%+ this year is quite remarkable considering the
fact that this is a company with a long reserve life which should dampen the
impact of cost increases. Since they continue to book new reserves at cost this
does not hit the income statement directly (note that the book value for their
reserves/share has increased even though each share represents less reserves in
mcfe compared to 12/31/05.

I do not know why some officers have been buying CHK shares aggressively in
spring/summer 2006 but I do know that some of their buys are underwater.I do
not want to imply that CHK is a dishonest organization but i have learned to
interpret cash flow statement ever since I lost some money in Worldcom stock -
CHK simply does not pass the smell test.

i am pretty sure that the overall quantity of reserves is impacted by the value
at the end of the period because the reserves have to be economic meaning the
company would show more reserves if the price were $7.10 rather than $4.10.
perhaps i can find something on gas reserve calcs.

REGARDING CHK - YES the quantity of reserves is indeed dependent on the reserve
price at the time of estimate, since onl;y reserves that can be exploited
economically are counted. This is true for official reserve estimates (those
stated in 10k's and such) i am not sure about the numbers stated in corporate
presentations.

I am also not sure what this means for high cost proven reserves where costs
are already sunk but lifting costs are low enough to warrant exploitation,
those would have to be written down in value but the reserve quantity on the
books would not change. I have not seen that with CHK so far. CHK's average
lifting costs are less than 1$, so i doubt that this would matter (as far as
quantity is concerned) even at prices around 4$.

cramer said the other day that they will be fine, that's probably the kiss of

i think AHM is a much better idea at this point, as you get a solid and growing
dividend, better earnings estimates, and a company that sticks to prime loans
instead of subprime, plus they buy credit insurance and have very conservative
loan reserves, so there is far less likely to be a nasty surprise than with a
company like NEW or IMH

here is a recent presentation they did, which gives a lot of good information

re chk I went through their latest presentation and I decided I no longer care
so much about the reserve issue. Whether its costing them $2.50 or $3.00 to
find the gas its still highly profitable at the margins if they are selling it
for $7.50+, and I agree with them that more likely than not the price of
natural gas is more likely up than down over the next decade so im happy to
invest in a company that strives to increase their reserves.
perhaps the difference in cash flow that you are finding its that that they are
making more expenditures to lock up non conventional acerage which I speculate
takes longer to bring to a proved reserve category. Bottom line if you believe
the peak oil theory at some point $10 gas will be the norm and this company
should be thriving.

TREF closed today at 46.80 Norwegian Krone, ie ~47 NOK. This translates into

or from the Oslo Exchange here:

TREF&menu2show=1.1.2.1 .

Yes, it is a small, under the radar, independent oil producer in Argentina.
Currently producing 5,000 bopd but gearing up.

The company's website has good information:

http://www.trefoil-limited.com/

A bunch of old TS/TX shareholders who hang around the Investor Village forum
have discussed TREF in the TS thread here:

http://www1.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=4164&mn=150&pt=msg&mid=795472

I use Fidelity. You can buy TREF in the US (via a couple of market makers) or
directly in Oslo (orders > $50k USD). Fido's commission for international is
steep (3.5 c per share) so careful there. Of course this is one you want to put
a limit order and perhaps be patient to get filled, especially if you trade in
the US. The IPO was about a year ago and the stock has not done much since
then. I think it will start moving any time, definitely after the next quarter
report and when reserves are adjusted later in 2007.

Disclaimer: I own a substantial position in this stock as I mentioned in

I spent some time researching tref and this what i came up.

Despite the fact that mgmt projected peak end of year production at 5400 boed,
they made no announcement that they achieved that. They completed two
additional wells and it sounded to me like production would be closer to 4000
than 5000. Comparing it to PDP.to which is also in argentina : PDP announced
peak oil flow of 13,700 boed vs a market cap of about $645MM. for
trefs market cap of $262 .5MM the comparable would be 5575 boed.

I could find no information on reserves. So based on above I just dont see why
TREF is a compelling buy at the moment, especially since its a lot more
expensive than PDP.to.

I own neither but I do own CLL.to which owns 35% of PDP.to.

Madharry,

Seems to me that TREF likes to keep a low profile (opposite of PDP) and only
releases news on major events. If you contact IR (Sven Engevik +54 11 4814
5556) he will confirm that TREF is already producing 5,000 bopd. Production
will go up significantly as they are taking over new acquisitions with existing
production.

From the presentation at the Pareto Conference (Sep 06):

http://www.trefoil-limited.com/news_presentations.htm

2P reserves are ~24 Mbbl (including their recent acquisitions at Tupungato and
Atamisqui). Market cap of TREF is ~ USD 250M. Compare to PDP: 2P reserves at
~18 Mbbl and market cap of ~USD 800M (w/ warrants & options). There is roughly
a factor 4 in valuation difference.

Of course, with small companies like these, success relies more on the geology
of the fileds and the drilling bit rather than current production or reserves,
but I disagree that TREF is expensive compared to PDP. It is the other way
around, in my view. For more info on TREF reserves, check the Pareto pdf in the
link above.

TREF was focused on Cha&#241;ares Herrados (CH) which has 2P reserves of ~15
Mbbl and then had this home run in Puesto Pozo Cercado (PPC). They are now
focused on PPC which is looking even better than initially thought. TREF has 2
drilling rigs and 2 completion/workover rigs and is trying to get a 3rd
refurbished rig.

The Tupungato and Atamisqui acquisitions will add existing production. TREF
management team is top notch. Also, looks like the PPC discovery could be
extrapolated to the east to Atamisqui. We shall see.

Anyhow, thanks for asking.

i think if you are trading something like USO, you have to use technical
analysis...there are no fundamentals to evaluate USO like you would a company,
and while you may think OPEC or peak oil or something else will cause oil to
rise in the long run, and you very well might be right given enough time, the
short term swings can be brutal

another thing to note with USO is that unlike the spot price of oil, which
currently rises every time a contract expires, due to the contango in the
subsequent contract, there is no contango in USO, so while the spot price of
oil is still above where it was a few months ago, the price of USO is well into
new low territory

crude hit a low of 55.81 in mid november, and USO hit a low of 50.25...now
crude is dropping below 57, but USO is 4% lower than mid november, so while oil
would appear to be a bit higher than mid november at this point, a person who
bought USO back then has lost money

JMHO of course

Some folks are talking about bargains in the energy sector. I do not think we
are there yet. Most stocks are still above the October level (in particular the
better names) but fundamentals in terms of pricing look worse to me. In
particular I think that many NG stocks trade at or even slightly above NAV
(CHK, EOG )and are not able to create shareholder value by drilling due to high
service costs. Look at CHK, they are spending 25% more (despite their hedging
gains) than their cash flow, issuing steady flood of debt and shares. Earnings
forecasts for 2007 are below 2.50/share assuming no major changes in NG prices.

re: pegasus wireless. Unfortunately, I was indisposed at the time of this
posting but when I saw that the market cap was low yet officer compensation
seemed relatively high I reviewed the 12/15/ 06 proxy. I can see why this
company chose to delist. The 
company could be a poster child of the type investors should be wary of. The
first warning sign though was very easy to spot- 2 separate classes of voting
shares. one for management and insiders the others for investors. Then there
was the preferred share offering now a liability of $257MM or so. BTW AIG
bought a chunk of the preferred and subsequently sued the company and i believe
there was a settlement. It seems that that the company stated that it was an
exclusive distributor of Direct TV in several areas but didnt mention that
Direct TV could terminate the agreement pretty quickly. Oops!

After a sharp decline in the stock price mgmt repriced their options in 2005. I
expect they might be repricing them again in 2007.

I laughed out loud upon reading that one of the reasons the company gave for
delisting was that it was unlikely that they could sell more shares to the
public anytime soon.

CHK is going to make lots of money in the coming years. I really think its
silly that the company seems to be valued now on the basis of two weeks of
projected weather. What seems clear to me is that several candian and american
majors are reducing their cap ex for gas drilling . That coupled with
production of oil from the oil sands ventures, which will absorb lot of
canadian NG means that there will be a lot less canadian gas available for
export over the next years. I bought CHK leaps on friday as I see NG sub $10 as

These guys who write columns and create screens often don't seem to do the next
digging steps (eliminations) that would help their readers. And they'd have
more credibility with me if they would say where they are actually placing
their own money.

I've scanned each of those nine stocks for possibilities for me. Here are my
comments:

IMOS: I sold half my few shares at the recent pop. Still looks to be in buying
range though.

WSTL: A little too expensive for me. Tough for me to figure this one. Several
years of profits now after many years of losses.

EXCO, PICO, PZE. I hold shares in each, and they have been mentioned on this
thread previously. I am disappointed in PZE and am considering selling at least
some.

EEI: This stock shows up for "9 value stocks for impatient investors"? The
stock's done nothing in two years.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=EEI&t=2y

Still looks overpriced to me; I'd not be a buyer. jmo.

MKSI. A little expensive, imo. While book value has been increasing, the
current p/bk (1.5) has been lower in past years. This looks like a cyclical
company with key insiders now selling. I'll pass.

MGS, CRWS. Might work. No time for me to look at them now.

----
I have an issue with term "impatient investors":

"...Many investors, including me, don't have the patience needed for
traditional value investing. With that in mind, I've devised a screen for
impatient value investors."

My belief is that nobody can be a "value investor" unless they realize they
have to be patient. It's almost built into the term "value investing". If a
buyer is not willing to be patient, he/she must be something else, perhaps
better described as a speculator.
This jmo, of course.

Very true and smart words. A very successful value investor I know who is now
82 years young stated that "Youth has no patience. I had no patience when I was
young, but did OK. Had I had patience, I'd own 10K shares of XOM at a cost of
much less than 0 considering dividends, since I bought Sirconi Vaccum years
back but couldn't hang on. Mergers, acquisitions, splits, etc now = 10K shares
of XOM and I invested 1K bucks. Now that I'm 82, I have plenty of patience,
just no time.
--------------------------------------------------------------
EEI looks like decent value, and has been showing up on my breakout scans
sporadically since October (Higher close than any last 5 day close on 2X or
more average 50 day volume). Turned out to be a good hint but I never took a
bite. Now its a thin float momentum play, likely to do alot better, but tuff to
chase in my psychological state of mind after last week. It has the gut feel of
a stock that is going to be pushed up alot more. Receivables do constitute
their entire tangible book value and still the Government Agency's are likely
good payers. The last divie does instill a high degree of confidence. Neither
has it moved much off a 1 year flatline chart. A move to get in here by a chunk
of money all at once would cause an uncomfortable gap up though. I'll put it in
the (Question mark column) along with 5,000 others. Should be an interesting
open on Monday.

Hello Paul

I thought I'd chime in because I have been investing/trading CWTR for the last
2 years and made some nice money. I first bought it after my wife shopped
there, bought a jacket and put it on and within an hour 2 people asked her
where she got it. She told me that the shop was great for her age group and
continues to be. I have been to at least 10 stores in different cities and they
are always full of buying customers. It does go up and down and the key I have
found is to buy when lower and hold until it goes up. I just bought some more
at 24 and if it goes lower I will add. I will then sell some around 30. I think
it has split twice in the time I have been investing in it. Also done well with
AEOS

Hey,

I am trying to figure out the taxation of various trusts for US tax-exempt
accounts. I assume a royalty trust based in USA (something like SJT) would not
be taxed at all in Roth IRA/401(k). What about Canadian trusts? Would they be
taxed by Canada at 15% (41.5% from 2011) regardless if US account is taxable or
tax exempt?

Thanks, Neil H. I'll consider CWTR again, although it really looks expensive to

Yes afaik. The trusts' distributions going into a US tax-exempt account are and
would be so taxed by Canada.

These Canadian taxes are fairly easy to claim as a credit when the trusts are
in taxable accounts --- as long as the amount of such taxes is below $600/yr
(joint filing). If the taxes in taxable accounts are higher than $600 (I
believe), then the IRS forms that must (for full claiming?) be completed are
MUCH more complex/difficult.

Canadian taxes (15%) paid from trusts that are in a USA deferred tax account
(e.g. IRA) are gone forever most people say. OTOH, I've also read a couple of
posts where the person says forms can be obtained from the Canadian gov't to
return some of these taxes.

I have Canadian trusts and other foreign tax-withholding stocks in tax deferred
(IRA), tax exempt (Roth) and taxable accounts. In my tax-deferred and exempt
accounts, I have assumed there's no recourse for me for regarding the Canadian
15% withholding.

This all is just my opinion: I'm no expert on
taxes/withholding/trusts/Canada/etc. and I could easily be very wrong.

THX. Oops. I didn't do well with my recent buys of THX at 55.

Jana Partners, which bought a chunk of THX, offered to buy the remainder of the
company last year for $62/sh. They were rebuffed by THX. Now though...sigh...
now that natural gas prices have fallen, THX agrees today to a buyout offer
from Forest Oil at $52/sh. in stock and cash. (Benefit apparently to Jana is
that Jana will clear their position in THX (although taking their lumps), and
they will have a position in Forest).

I guessed it was a risky spec. play buying at $55, because the stock price fell
off as Jana failed to increase its offer, THX didn't modify its objections, and
no further buyers came forward at the lower price.

I closed my position this morning.

Looking at Marty Whitman's Third Ave. Funds letter for period ending Oct. '06
(issued December), he says about Hong Kong real estate companies his fund/funds
are acquiring: "Three...equity investments during the quarter (were) Wharf
Common, Cheung Kong Common, and Wheelock Common. Each issue was acquired at
what seems to be a meaningful discount from Net Asset Value ("NAV"). For
example, the Wheelock Common bought during the quarter was acquired at prices
ranging from $13.50 to $14 per share in Hong Kong dollars. Wheelock management
estimated that NAV was $27.85 per share in Hong Kong dollars at September 30,
2006. TAVF (edit: Third Ave Funds) management believes that Wheelock management
estimate of NAV is conservative."

I'll step up for some shares of Wheelock (WHLKF). It's a belief thing. I'm
going to believe somebody at Third Ave. Funds has done his/her homework. Maybe
that person is going somewhat on their belief in a Wheelock's manager's stated
belief of what NAV is. Anyway, I am hoping (betting) somebody did their
homework and they are right in their conclusion that this company is
undervalued (as measured by price:NAV).

The stock's moved up a little bit from $14 HK (converted to WHLKF to about
$1.94-1.97/sh), but still looks okay to me if (IF) the stock can get closer to
the believed NAV figure. A figure which presumably keeps growing with inflation
and Wheelock management's development activities.

To protect myself a little, it's a small position and it's among a package.
That is, I've previously mentioned that I have bought CDEVY and CHEUY also. I
suspect I will be making (or trying to make) a commitment to hold these stocks
several years.

Interesting idea. I've been looking at a few of these land developers on the
heals of Baron's International trader columns and also on the heals of DB's few
positions in a few of these developers.

This google link provides a little bit more avenue to search out research,
annual reports, interim financials etc. Even on Wharf.

http://finance.google.com/finance?q=HKG%3A2868

BJCLF is a small speculative one which I upped today. ( Just in time for the
worldwide crash of emerging markets - LOL).

This one is currently selling below NAV with 100% earnings growth expected for
a few years, and is an arm of the Bejing Municipal Government. Water
infrastructure, commercial and residential land development, highway and toll
roads, and port development.

Some clips from reports on BJCLF ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=2868.HK )

For the first half of the year 2006, profit attributable to
equity holders of the Group was RMB86,738,000, an
increase of approximately 452% compared with
RMB15,704,000 for the first half of the year 2005, which
was mainly resulted from the recognition of negative
goodwill of RMB127,480,000 arising from the
acquisition of a subsidiary known as Beijing East Ocean
United Investment Co., Ltd. during the period.

As of June 30, 2006 it's total equity after all current and long term
liabilities and debt was 3.87 B ($Rmb) and today its mkt cap is $3.89B. About
1X NAV of 6 months ago. Looks cheap for that kind of growth and expected to go
gangbusters for years.

It's a bit of work to decipher the financials but from the interims and annual
reports, you can, and also then do the conversions. About 1.7b Honk Kong Shares
out, most very tightly held.

certainly some short term pain ahead but both stocks are cheap and generate

S which I (unfortunately) still own is coming into the buy range again.
Problems are well known but despite the issues, S is supposed to generate 4B$
in pre tax FCF next year (10% yield on the current market cap). This should
make S very attractive to private equity or a strategic buyer like Comcast

You mentioned Harvest Energy Trust, HTE.

Canadian tax withheld]

http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/061004/0169518.html
[October 4, 2005: 4th quarter dist, .338 US/month]

HTE seems about due to report 1st quarter distributions in next few days. At
.338 US/month, the yield at current price (about 20.25) is a mouthwatering 17%
after deduction of Canadian tax.

If HTE should happen to cut their distributions to .24 US/month, (IMO that
would be probably worst case), that is still 12% after tax deduction.

I don't think the Canroys can stay at these levels very long. Greed and search
for yield should take effect soon, IMO.
