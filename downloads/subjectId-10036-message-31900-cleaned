CVX is my top position in both the IRA and taxable portfolio. This is after
peeling off some shares in the $100 range. Many of my oil and commodity shares
are down 30% from their recent highs. My cost basis on the group is very low as
this sector comprises several core holdings I began to establish in the late
80's. Long term I am still positive on the group especially if they continue to
raise their dividends over time. The recent correction is good for any longer
term sustained rally to continue.

I continue to watch PBR and RIO. I agree with you on Lula, the Brazilian
President. Of the foreign countries with large oil reserves and natural
resources, Brazil has one of the most stable political environments. The key
challenge for the government is to spread the economic wealth to the middle and
lower classes. The economy will grow larger and longer if everybody
participates.

There definitely is a rotation under way out of oil and commodities which I
believe is fueled by these hedge fund liquidations. The hedge funds amplify the
price moves both higher and lower.

EKS, regarding commodity stocks, I'm beat up there to the point where I'm
reluctant to commit more funds to the sector. I am coming to believe the market
is telling me I have no idea what I am doing and that the market is right.

I hold RIO. I like it. Stock's a point away from a 12-mo low. Not sure what
I'll do at this point (add more or just hold). Your idea to watch it a little
longer seems reasonable. If I didn't already hold some shares, I'd more
strongly consider entering for a small buy somewhere around current level.

I haven't a good reason for this, but I look favorably at commodity producers
where the controlling insider shareholders are family members. I assume they
are very careful about the acquisitions and new mines that their companies
develop. So that'd be TCK and LMC, for example, that I like. LMC at a new low.
I've been following it on the way down with buys: I may add more tomorrow.
(Same kind of story as PBR. They are going to have a new mine in operation in
2009-2010 and IF commodity prices hold and IF there's no new onerous tax laws
or government (Congo, Russia) confiscatory actions, the stock will do
okay--imo. (Looks like Congo is going to insist on a larger take. FCX (in which
I hold shares too) is also affected by Congolese actions.)

CCJ's major uranium mine has flooded again. (They hadn't been able to repair it
from the first flood.) That might help competitor USU.
I've shares in both :>(

"Commodity" encompasses quite a bit. For agricultural, maybe it's time now to
look at ADM-- stock hasn't been this low since Jan '06. P/e at 8 is low
historically. I've no shares now, but will consider a small buy for tomorrow.

Holding AUY. :>(
Near a 12-mo low, this one might be worth a speculative bet now on gold.

It's very frustrating with PBR as I just added a few shares less than 30 days
ago and it is already down 12%...Ugh!. I wonder if the market is concerned
about some possible "new tax" announcement scheduled for September 19, 2008.

Jurgis posted this article yesterday from the Economist
http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12009864

From the article:"...A government committee is looking at how best to increase
the state’s oil take, and will give some preliminary findings on September
19th. One of two options seems likely. First, as has been suggested by
President Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva and by his energy minister, Edison
Lob&#227;o, the government could create a new company that would partner any
firm (including Petrobras) exploring in the pre-salt areas that have yet to be
auctioned. Second, taxes on profits could be raised for new concessions. Either
change is likely to need ratification by Brazil’s Senate....".

===============================================================
I am increasing my other Brazilian bets with ULTR, GGB, RIO and DPDW because
irrelevant of any extra "country" tax, I believe these companies will benefit
significantly from the build out of the deep water Brazil oil fields.

It almost looks like what Canada did with their proposed increase oil royalty
"tax" on Canadian Oil Trusts. I sure hope there is not a similar proposal in
the works for PBR and their oil partners.

EKS, With more backup this time, I will give again the ruling reason for buying
PBR now.

<u>You can buy PBR at a stock price now that equals the stock price BEFORE any
of the massive PBR Brasilian off-shore discoveries were announced.</u>

Current stock price: $45.42

Price before the first big announcement: Nov 7, 2007: $46.27
Closing price on day of first big announcement: Nov 8, 2007: $58.26

OTOH,

1. There's been some rumors that insiders were big buyers of the stock before
the announcement, and some or a lot of that had already brought the stock up
higher by Nov 7 to the $46 area.

2. We know with more certainty now (vs. 11/'07) that the oil is actually there.
That's a positive. Otoh,we also knew then and now even if the oil were there,
it would take several years, billions of dollars, and tremendous expertise to
lift "large" quantities of oil from the fields. And thus, we knew/know that the
share price of Petrobras could/would fluctuate until the oil revenue stream was
more assured. One could've guessed there'd be no hurry to jump into the stock
after the announcement. --- And so, maybe there's no hurry now.
--------------------
It's possible that Lula will disappoint PBR shareholders with his proposals to
increase the government's share. OTOH though, those proposals have to wend
their way through Brasil's elected representatives. Right now, with PBR's
current stock price, one could almost conclude that PBR stock now gives very,
very little weight to the enormous off-shore finds Petrobras has announced
subsequent to Nov 7,2007.

Imo PBR is now a buy for both short-term traders and for longer-term holders.

finally an honest clipping and the NYT story.

Nobody ever knows why the stock market goes up or down every day. But that
doesn't stop people from offering reasons. For instance, people used to say
that if oil prices fell, stocks would rise. They said that if the government
came to the rescue of troubled financial institutions, that would boost stocks.
And they suggested that if the Fed cut interest rates more than expected,
investors would buy stocks. But today, The New York Times decided not to even
offer an explanation. It suggested that nobody knows.

New York Times:
The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 344.65 points on Thursday on a
confluence of poor news about the economy, although investors could not pin the
drop on any overriding reason. None of the news came as a shock to Wall Street.
So what pushed the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index down 3 percent, its worst
daily performance in three months? “Boy, it’s hard to say,” Douglas M. Peta, a
market strategist at J.& W. Seligman, said after the market’s close. “All of us

$3.15. Vs. stock price of about $3.06/sh.
Not a Ben Graham net-net (We'd want to see stock price at 2/3 nca), but afaik,

Chinese may put limits on visitors to Macau. Thus apparently crimping Macau
business which was supposed to help the big casino players - Aruze, Wynn, LVS,

I've decided I can't figure the outcome of the political maneuverings, although
I suspect China officials will ultimately want the tourism and government
profits that Macao gambling provides. Also disconcerting for casino
shareholders are the difficulties Las Vegas casinos face with gas
prices/reduction in airline flights/local (Indian) gaming/etc.

Where I now believe the better-outlooked opportunities lie are in lottery
tickets. That's a market in China that's not Macau specific, but instead open
to all Chinese (I believe). Also in USA, these tickets are an easier buy than
even traveling to local casinos. The stocks of lottery purveyors have already
moved up, so they are not value buys based on their financials or usual
metrics. It's a growth bet.

In line with the Brazilian investment theme and the eventual build out of their
offshore Oil & NG fields, I increased my small position in Deep Down, Inc.
(DPDW.OB). The company announced last week that they have appointed Bryce
Merrill to the position of Director of Subsea Services at Mako Technologies.
Mako Technologies is a wholly owned subsidiary of Deep Down Inc and provides
deep water ROV (remote operated vehicles) services.

Deep Down Expands ROV Staff Through Mako Technologies
http://news.corporate.findlaw.com/prnewswire/20080825/25aug20081438.html
From the article:"...Merrill served on various projects for BP, Chevron,
Petrobras, Shell and Total. During his tenure at Oceaneering International,
Inc., he served as ROV supervisor for the Petrobras Pacnorse project, where he
was responsible for operation of the Arms Bell onboard the drillship, which at
the time set a new world depth record with a dive to 3032 feet. Merrill has
significant experience designing and building specialty tools used in subsea
operations....".

The value proposition is that Merrill will bring his contacts and experience to
build a growing subsea off shore oil rig service business specifically in
support of one or more PBR long term (oil rig) service contracts.

Floatation Technologies (another subsidiary of DPDW) has already signed a multi
year service contract with PBR for floatation buoys and I suspect Mako with the
help of Bruce Merrill will do the same for deep water ROV services.

This is a penny stock with a huge number of shares outstanding. The company
must grow their sales over time obtaining multi year service contracts that
create guaranteed revenue streams. If Mako lands any future service contracts
with PBR, this division could generate new sales equivalent to their Floatation
Technology division.

This is a high risk high return play that allows exposure to the huge dollars
Brazil intends to spend on the development of their Oil & NG offshore fields.
The value proposition is in the individual (Bryce Merrill and his PBR contacts)
and the potential new contracts he might bring to Mako. At $0.62/share, a total
loss will not hurt too much but over the next several years it could become a
multi bagger.

Total current assets @ $59M (USD) a/o 6/'08
less: current liabilities @ $22M
less: long-term liabilities ~ $1M
less: minority interest ~ $4M

That's $32M to be divided by 10.3M shares = $3.11/sh. The stock's now at $3.47,
about a three year low.

Company expects to do $100M (USD) this year. With a market cap of $36M, that
gives a hefty p/sales ratio for a grocery (compared to US grocery chains I am
following. OTOH, it might be THE significant grocery operation in a
less-competitive (??) Israeli market (I do not know.). Also a large component
of that $36M is cash/marketable securities-- about $23M which could be backed
out of market cap to show a "better" p/sales figure. And of course the $23M
cash/equiv vs. just $4M in debt, provide somewhat of a margin-of-safety.

Hi - with a K

You posted on 6/2/07 that you started a position in Ultrapar Holdings Inc.
(UGP). Do you still own your shares? Would you buy more at current levels?

I like the business sectors that the company serves. The dividend yield of 3.4%
(at a 33% payout) is attractive given the potential growth of their businesses
but the company carries quit a bit of debt.

One interesting item that caught my eye is that 49.5% of the company is held by
the Igel family (through two holding companies). The special governance
features for this ownership block expires on 12/16/09. It's possible that the
board will renew these governance terms but more than likely some other
arrangement will be made to cash out (all or part) of the Igel family's
holdings which should create higher shareholder value.

Debt is carried at 52% in foreign currency and 42% local currency with a
duration of 6.1 years. At $1,497 million in total debt this represents
$11/share or about 32% of the common share price. http://www.ultra.com.br/
Net cash flow was negative in 2008 but should improve substantially through
2011 since their long term debt duration was extended. At current growth rates
this debt should become quite manageable as their net cash reserve increase.

place in Brazil.

Petrobras acquired the fuel and lubricants distribution business in the North,
Northeast and Midwest regions of Brazil, and jointly with Braskem acquired the
petrochemical assets of the Ipiranga Group. The oil refining assets held by RPI
are shared equally between Petrobras, Ultrapar and Braskem.

For Ultrapar, the acquisition of Ipiranga is part of its growth strategy in the
fuel distribution segment, where it already operated through Ultragaz in the
distribution of LPG. Fuel distribution is an activity with the same
profitability and success drivers of LPG distribution: a major brand, efficient
logistics and excellence in the management of resellers network. The growth in
fuel sales, gains in operational efficiency and the greater investment
capacity, due to the simplification of the shareholding structure and the
implementation of a simpler decision making process at Ipiranga, were all
determining factors in the decision to make this acquisition.
=============================================================

They took on a lot of debt in this acquisition and it will take several years
of continued growth to generate the free flow cash they achieved before this
purchase.

This is the big negative I see for this company.

ConocoPhillips Joins Origin in $8 Billion Gas Venture
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=aGyI6a3zhpqY&refer=news

From the article:"... Sept. 8 (Bloomberg) -- ConocoPhillips, the second-biggest
U.S. oil refiner, agreed to pay as much as $8 billion to join Origin Energy
Ltd. in a natural gas venture in Queensland state as the Australian company
seeks to fend off a bid from BG Group Plc.

ConocoPhillips will initially contribute $5 billion to the venture, which will
focus on coal-seam gas and liquefied natural gas processing and sales for
export to Asia, Houston-based ConocoPhillips said in a statement distributed on
Business Wire. It will take 50 percent of the coal-seam gas unit of Sydney-
based Origin, Australia's biggest producer of the fuel...".
================================================================

Seems like a pretty large investment by COP. It shows their commitment to their
LNG business.

``With this investment, ConocoPhillips has gained access to the leading
coal-bed methane resource in Australia,'' Jim Mulva, chief executive officer of
ConocoPhillips, said in the statement. ``The company has enhanced its LNG
position with the creation of an additional Australian LNG hub serving
Asia-Pacific markets.''

Im really surprised there hasnt been more discussion of the legal ramifications
of this governmental arrangement regarding fnm and fre. I'm very confused that
all of this can be done without shareholder approval. If I'm a preferred
shareholder suddenly according to this arrangement I get no dividend for the
forseeable future and the government a new lender gets a priority preferred
shares that apparently yield 10%, yet I get no say to vote yeah or nay on this
proposal. not only that but I believe virtually all of the preferred shares are
non cumulative so once the dividend is not paid for a given year its lost.
Seems like more of an expropriation than a conservation to me. any attys want
to weigh in on this? This could be the death of the preferred share issuance. I
cant see how anyone would buy a preferred non cumulative share ever again. If
im a serious preferred share owner of fannie mae I would much rather have seen
the company sold. at least I wouldnt be wiped out this way. did the board try
to sell the company, but was not successful?

Hi Paul - Have a fun and exciting trip. Be sure to check out any of the Cirque
du Soleil shows (http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/default.htm ).
It's well worth the cost.

I always go back to the McDep Weekly Energy Reports to verify my valuation for
different energy companies and have concluded that the market is significantly
under pricing this sector. COP is the largest conglomerate which continues to
be undervalued. They calculate the Net Present Value of COP at $150/share with
$60/barrel oil! I am tempted to buy more but the portfolio is already over
weighted in this sector.

Here is their most recent report.
http://www.mcdep.com/mr80819.pdf
August 19, 2008

They discuss the recent sell off in the sector and their opinion as to when the
low might be put in.

From the article:"...A more immediate question may be when might the current
stock price declines stop? Our optimistic response is now, the month of the
26th anniversary of the turn in 1982. Seasonally, October may be a bottom. By
the four-year election cycle, the bottom may be two years from now. That seems
too pessimistic because the stock market has already been declining for a year
and recently has taken oil stocks down as well..."

The item that caught my attention is with oil at $102/barrel, we broke through
the 200 day moving average of $106/barrel.

"...Current quotes for near-month, twelve months and 72 month oil are $113,
$114, and $112 a barrel compared to 200-day or 40-week averages of $110, $110
and $106 respectively (see chart, page 2, Six-Year and One-Year Oil and Natural
Gas Futures). Amid signs of slowing economic activity the trend could be flat
for awhile as it was during 2006 (see chart, page 6, Six-Year Commodity Price
Meter)...."

It's hard to say when we will hit bottom but I am sure we are closer to the
bottom than the top.

As prices turn red again, you may have the best approach by taking a few days
off. I think I will turn the computer off and go take the dog for a walk.

Fresh oil find shows up to 4 billion barrels in Brazil
LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Companies led by Petrobras encountered fresh success in
a field offshore of Brazil, saying a recent oil find in the Santos Basin
contains up to 4 billion barrels of oil.

From the article:"... Petrobras (PBR: PBR 39.61, +1.17, +3.0%) , BG Group
(UK:BG: news, chart, profile) and Galp Energia (PT:GALAM: news, chart, profile)

barrels of oil equivalent.
It's the third find in what's called the BM-S-11 concession, the first being
the high-profile Tupi discovery that contains up to 8 billion barrels of oil.
The companies said the most recent discovery was better than initially
expected. The well is 230 kilometers (143 miles) off the coast of Rio de
Janiero at a water depth of 2,230 meters.
Petrobras holds 65% of BM-S-11; BG controls 25% and Galp holds 10%.
"Brazil will become a very major production center for our company and will
sustain a major earnings contribution over at least three decades," said BG CEO
Frank Chapman in a statement. ..."

difficult to reverse. On the other hand, perhaps PSR is a good metric now for
retailers that have suffered margin shrinkage in slow economy. I still would

ive been taken to the cleaners on this one too. Clearly Mr. market agrees is
saying that their is a very high risk of survival to washington mutual. I an
not one of those people in the know as to what will happen here. However I do
think that this is a company with salable assets, and on top of that they have
access to the fed discount business. So my bet though smaller is that the
company survives. However, Its certainly possible that they cut or stop paying
the dividend on the preferred, especially after fnma and freddie mac are doing
so.

Philosophically though, the question is what is the likelihood that wm goes
down the tubes vs. it survives with the preferred intact. so for example if
survival is 50/50 meaning if it fail you lose all your money but if it survives
you make 4 times your money is it a value proposition or not?

How would B. Graham answer that question?

me:
Maybe the line is drawn with the degree of uncertainty of the bet/investment?

Or maybe it is related to the type of wager. Your original posting talked about
weighing the odds of BK and losing all your investment vs no BK and a 4 bagger.
If the odds are 50-50, take the bet, you suggest.

But betting the odds on a BK is fundamentally different than betting on
fundamentals.

Maybe it depends on if your BK analysis is predominantly based on fundamentals
or gut?

This is a good article that outlines WM's survival options.
Washington Mutual: In Troubled Waters
By: Salman Friday, September 12, 2008 8:19 AM
http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewarticle+articleid_2607222.html

JPM has been studying their books since March. A spin off of some of WM's
branches to JPM for more capital or the sale/transfer of WM's credit default
swaps that are under water would make WM leaner and a survivor. Maybe the Fed
steps up and underrights a portion of these credit default swaps with combined
JPM and WM assets.

From the article:"...The cost of protecting Washington Mutual's debt with
credit default swaps rose to 32.5 percent upfront, plus 500 basis points
annually, up from 30 percent upfront plus 500 basis points on Monday, according
to Markit Intraday. That means it costs $3.25 million in upfront costs plus
$500,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt...."

============================================================
Disclosure - I own 100 shares of WM in the IRA and was lucky to sell the bulk
of my core position at $55 last year. I sold the last of my taxable holdings at
$19.

I think you are right in your evaluation of the potential Risk vs Reward of WM
but at this point it is a bit too risky for me. (I almost bought some of the
preferred hybrid shares).

The value proposition is for a potential buyer to acquire some or all of WM
assets. At this time, WM has very limited options and it will be the potential
buyer that obtains fire sale assets at WM's expense.

Those WM-PR are up almost 100% from Monday and the first dividend is due Monday
September 15, 2008. My guess is that WM peels off some assets to JPM but it
will not be a complete buy out. It should be a good deal for both parties and
the WM preferred shares continue to hold their value.

I have read the article. thanks for posting it. I have the following comments:

It seems to me that of late rating agency downgrades are occurring in response
to stock prices rather than the other way around. I dont think that ratings are
of much use to anyone anymore except that it determines access to capital
markets unfortunately and how much collateral needs to be up under certain
condition. in my view banks and other companies made a horrible mistake
allowing ratings to determine ratios in various loan documents and other
agreements. I'm not sure that the these credit swaps numbers have any meaning
as i doubt that anyone is insuring their debt in this manner anyway. My guess
is its some trumped up measure that allows shorts to garner headlines and put
more pressure on the stock but perhaps i am too cynical.

Every thing is negotiable and these tpt guys werent born yesterday. If the
choice is bankruptcy or these guys taking some haircut with some opportunity of
making good money at a later date im sure they will listen to reason. I still
think its possible that WM could be sold to one of the canadian banks looking
to expand their presence in North America and it might make a good match, or
even to an asian bank for that matter. If that happens it will be home run for
prefferred shareholders. Even if that doesnt happen I dont see a 90% liklihood
of default within 5 years. My gut feeling tells me that the last thing the
government wants to do is to take over the country's largest thrift. It would
be a logisitcal nightmare . Then of course like many of my other speculations
this year i could be completely wrong and i can use my preferred stock to cover
holes in my wall. I am certainly not suggesting anyone purchase this is an
investment or even speculation for now.

UHR.VX (228 CHF),ETE, CPNO (26.53$), WMB
Purchased back my UHR.VX (Swatch) for 228 CHF. Crazy swings in the market here.
ETE (my largest MLP holding - ouch!) is really getting hammered. no clue why
today the MLP ETP was up 5% and the GP (ETE) down some. Makes no sense but I
guess is that's how he market works sometimes. On a happier note I put some
proceeds from a sale of MWE into CPNO. Both are similar G&P MLP's in the sense
that they do not have a separate GP (general partner) and do not pay IDR's.
CPNO's balance sheet is stronger than MWE's that why I bought it. Both are
yielding 8%+ and are poised to grow distributions in the mid teens unless we
see a total collapse of he NG midstream business.

ETE I continue to hold I own to much to buy more. I'll probably will sell my
highest cost units for a tax loss and reinvest in something similar.

MLP's/ GP I own: ETE, WES, MGG, CPNO

WMB hit my short term price target a day after I bought it (sold at 27.35$)
LOL. Crazy market.

Some market comment. AIG - never thought it would come down like this but when
they got into the argument with their auditor I lost all confidence and sold my
shares. LEH I consider toast. Who needs these Wall Street brokers anyways?
And who needs the rating companies. They downgrade companies and justify this
by increasing credit spreads and sinking stock prices? Holy smokes! They
basically are saying that if everybody else thinks something is wrong there
most be something to it and we need to downgrade as well. It appears to me that
this is an implicit acknowledgment that their analyst have zero predictive

Followed you in on Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC (MIC) for a starter
position for my IRA. The company carries a lot of debt but appears to have
sufficient cash flow to service it. I like two of their primary businesses (1)
Bulk liquid storage terminals and (2) Gas production & Distribution.

The bulk liquid storage business has good growth potential and steady cash flow
from long term (3-5 year) customer contracts. They do not own the products they
store but just provide the terminal storage facilities.

Their gas production and distribution business is located in Hawaii. They
operate the only gas utility in the Hawaiian islands and are the state's
largest propane distribution company on the island.

If they maintain their current dividend payout, the stock yields around 13%.

Their depreciation expense is quite high which overshadows their actual
operating cash flow (about $2.22/share). If they can work down their large
amount of debt over time (from current business operations), then this company
should be able to build their future book value which will eventually be
reflected in a higher stock price.

Fill now on a few more AVT shares.

Could be an okay way to play growth of technology/electronics sector (assuming
there's any growth -g-)

NUE just upped its Q guidance 15 minutes ago a fairly substantial 20% or so, PR
below. It spiked, then fell back.
I still think this is a great name to pick up on the cheap, even better after
the most recent announcement.

Just talked with a retail broker, he mentioned that the uptick rule, and the
naked short rule may be reinstituted by week's end. Anyone hearing that?
Also, he was of the opinion that brokerage earnings to be released mid-week may
not be as bad as the Street is fearing or expecting.

fools rush in... I bought a little avf. gut feeling is that they wont let the
worlds largest insurance company go belly up. they will find a way. Of course
several smart people didnt think leh would go belly up either. I was only
briefly one of those smart people.
