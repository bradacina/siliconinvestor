PRAA - I bought mostly because it was a recent IPO that seemed likely to get
some good press and more volume. I agree that the valuation is stretched here.

The charts in your other holdings don't turn me on much. I have wrestled a lot
this year with reconciling valuation on its own and chart action, i.e. whether
anyone cares about the cheap prices. No magic formula, I just go by my gut
instinct on when to buy a diving chart and when to wait for an upswing.

I TRY to buy 'em when they look cheap to me. That is difficult sometimes when
there's so much negativity and day-by-day drops in the stock price -- when the
charts look like down is the obvious direction. OTOH, putting aside that it
might be psychologically difficult to step in like this, it's also many times a
very wrong thing to do. I have wounds all over my body from falling knives.

But my fingers keep clutching at 'em. -g-

Beware of falling sector knives, especially in this not-so-nice bear market.
Sectors that thrive for a while just go off like old meat, then valuation
doesn't seem to matter as the stocks get booted down the stairs.

With interest rates destined to go up sometime not too far over the horizon, I
can't see housing as a good play in general, even if the PE ratios are tiny
right now.

Just my two cents. That said, the lack of sector leadership in the market makes
pro-sector buying impossible too.

Appreciate your post. I'd guess it represents the consensus view. For the
housing sector, it almost seems like the general opinion (on SI anyway) is not
just to avoid the sector, but to short it. -g-

I started a position in home builder CTX today. I like the financial
fundamentals except for the debt part. There's no beneficial reason now to buy
this company over any other of the majors, imo, although CTX itself is much
more diversified in aspects of the housing sector than its competitors. It's a
stick builder though, and these stocks all seem to be correlated, viz:

I have not invested in grocery stores/food distribution companies in the past

have somewhat of a distribution monopoly here in Minneapolis which makes the
company interesting. In this environment the two items I worry about are debt
and pension plan problems. The PE of 9 seems reasonable. I do not know what
interest they are paying on their long term debt, but if their credit is good
they could refinance the debt which could be an opportunity.

Value Stock: WTBK

Westerbeke (WTBK) is a microcap company that sells a variety of engine
products. They have a website at http://www.westerbeke.com

The company has recently received $2.6M in cash from an arbitration award. This
has improved its situation tremendously. It currently trades around $2 per
share.

Valuation:

Based on WTBK's 10Q plus the recent arbitration award, I compute:

$11.182M of current assets -- This includes cash, inventories, marketable
securities, deferred taxes, prepaid taxes and the split-dollar life policy
(which the company gets back when John W. dies). I also added the company's
$725,800 LIFO reserve here as we are interested in current inventory value
(look it up if you dont know what i'm talking about).

($7.473M) of liabilities. This includes ALL LIABILITIES.

$2.6M addition for after-tax gain on the arbitration award. Note that this
payment also makes the deferred-tax and prepaid-tax assets above become
cashified.

------------------

$6.309M Net Worth

NOTE: I have assumed the company's plant is worth $0 in this computation.

WTBK has 2,427,982 shares and options outstanding. I assume that all options
are exercised at a strike price of $0 to be as conservative as possible.

$2.60/share is thus the company's net worth per share, based solely on the
balance sheet.

WTBK's 4-year average net income is $443,900 or $0.183 per share. The company
is likely to generate income numbers that lie in a band around this average
moving forward.

A portion of WTBK's equity surplus should be considered NOT to be working
capital (i.e. not cash the company needs to maintain inventory, payroll, etc.)

The company's valuation should be:

(Non-working-capital equity surplus) + (P/E) * (Net income)

For conservativeness, I use a 10 P/E. So the second term is $1.83/share.

For the first term, I estimate by assuming that the company needs a cash
cushion adequate to withstand 3 years of substantial losses. I take a loss of
$0.183/share to be "substantial," based on the company's average profit. (3 *
0.183) = $0.55/share.

The remaining cash is surplus that could surely be distributed or profitably
reinvested. Thus it falls to the bottom line as equity surplus. So, we have:

Valuation = $2.60 - $0.55 + $1.83 = $3.88 per share.

Please comment if you feel I've made any errors.

CUB - started a long position on Friday. Feedback from the thread would be
appreciated.

Just did a quick cash flow analysis for 2002, 2001, and 2000 fiscal years. At
2002= $.46/share; 2001= $.06/share; and 2000= $1.06/share, I don't see anything
in the free cash flow to spark my interest. The dividend rate of .76% is only
in the money market area.

It appears that the bet on this would be massive revenue increases due to the
military increasing their spending for its products. I have no way of judging
the likelihood of that actually occurring, but "as is" the flow to the bottom
line doesn't offer me much margin of safety. At the current share price of
$18.40, I could get $.92 return with a 5% CD or dividend, which is over twice
the 2002 cash flow for CUB, almost 3 times the year average cash flow and
almost twice the three year average.

Having said all that, the chart does look interesting. Nice trend in price
since June 0f 2000.

I'm not buying on momentum yet. So, based on my read of the cash flow, I'd
pass.

Hard for me to call CUB a value play. It's always been strong in its two
segment niches (mass transit -ticket/turnstyles if I remember, and defense). At
current price, Cubic is too expensive (imo) as a value play unless someone who
follows it closely sees something special or somebody can identify a catalyst.

That said, I'd could see the stock moving up 50% from here. Those large
government defense bill dollars will eventually flow, and CUB will get its
share. I'd guess CUB will move in line with most other defense stocks. I have a
couple such (can't call them value plays either), and I so am hoping the entire
defense sector will rise.

Adding a bit more today to BAMM, an old thread favorite.

I re-looked at the numbers, and I was wrong about BAMM being a Ben Graham
net-net at current price. It's iffy (imo) if BAMM will be profitable for the
year (upcoming Q is the big one), and BAMM has lots of dollar exposure from
their operating leases (which look to me to be off the balance sheet).

Still, I don't see BAMM going BK, and if BAMM can hold its share of book sales,

this stock that takes account of all the prime real estate MCD has acquired
over the past decades that has increased in value but has been depreciated on
the books over so many years.
-------
About picking the leaders in a sector:

I am always struggling with which stocks to buy within a downtrodden sector. Is
it the market leader(s) that analysts will focus on and most investors know and
look at first? Is it the most leveraged which might show the greatest earnings
gains when the sector has good times again (assuming the leverage doesn't wipe
out the company meanwhile)? Or perhaps the most downtrodden stock --which might
give the greatest stock market percentage gains if or when the sector comes
back and pulls up the stocks in it? Or might there be a company in the sector
that appeals to a consolidator or perhaps a different company in the sector
that might appeal to a new entrant tying to establish a position? How about
considering the cheapest company on a price/sales and/or a price/book and/or a
ROE or sales growth basis?

Over the years I have learned about me that if I try to pick one from among the
choices, I usually make the wrong choice. Therefore you will generally find me
making several selections. I'm not sure that is the best way financially - I
don't net gains and losses by my stocks within a sector and measure against
individual performers in the sector - but this diversity does, for me, make for
a much much more liveable investment situation.

So as regards restaurant stocks, I have a little YUM I started in November as
well as other restaurant stocks I've mentioned over the years. I'm currently
buying to build up a small position again in SWRG.

Coincidentally, from briefing.com today:

Yum! Brands (YUM) 23.87 +0.67: As Briefing.com has noted on several occasions
over the past couple of weeks this is a good time of year to be hunting for
bargains, as stocks trading near their lows often rebound early in the new
year. One stock which fits the bill is Yum! Brands. YUM, which operates the
Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell, Long John Silver's, and A&W All-American Food quick
service restaurants, is down nearly 28% from its midyear and 52-wk high of
33.17

Decline triggered by general market weakness, a couple of earnings warnings,
concern over debt load and poor results from fast-food king McDonald's. While
all of these concerns were legitimate, Briefing.com contends that the downside
risk from current levels is minimal as YUM is trading at deep discounts to the
market.

At present, YUM sports a forward p/e (based on confirmed estimate for FY02 of
$1.89) of 12.7x. Multiple falls to 11.6x when using consensus figure for FY03.
By comparison, S&P 500 trading at roughly 16.5x CY03 estimates. Stock's
price/sales ratio of 0.97 and price/cash flow ratio of 7.8x are also well below
market and industry averages.

Discounted multiples are one reason to consider YUM. Another is that management
continues to do a good job of improving operating efficiencies. Inventory and
receivables trends are both favorable, suggesting that YUM is well positioned
to leverage modest improvement in industry conditions into solid bottom-line
improvement.

Considering that 9 of the 13 analysts surveyed by First Call rate the stock
Neutral or Hold, any upside surprises to earnings resulting from the improved
operating efficiencies likely to result in ratings upgrades. Anybody familiar
with the way Wall Street works knows that positive earnings surprises and
ratings upgrades are a powerful one-two combination.

Assuming YUM meets or beats consensus forecasts going forward, investors should
expect at least moderate multiple expansion. At 15x projected FY03 earnings
stock has upside to 31, or 29% above today's price. -- Robert Walberg,

MU Took a look at Micron today, thinking the bad news might have pushed it into
the buy zone. Here's a post I put up responding to comment on Yahoo that MU had
over $10 in tangible assets: FWIW, I'd estimate Net liquid asset value per
share at close to 2.82. This reflects rule of thumb adjustments like
discounting receivables 10% and inventory 50% and is, at best, an analytical
guess. Tangible assets without netting obligations isn't useful IMO.
The 'cash crunch' I find more worrisome is the inability of MU to generate any
FCF over the cycle. I just ran 5 year cum. FCF and came up with negative 220mm.
The only year EPS and FCF were postive was YE 8/31/00 reflecting the millenium
upgrade cycle. With the Y2K bug in the rear view mirror and no killer aps I
don't see conditions that would focus demand like that ahead. The 5 year period
reflects a complete cycle with revenues in the final year below the first so
the 'growth' argument for neg. FCF isn't there. This is just a lousy
business/industry where competive forces have squeezed out all profitability in
the absence of extraordinary conditions like Y2k.
.....................
Merrill argued a couple of days ago that MU was getting close to a bottom @
~1.3* book and showed a chart indicating bottoms near book in prior cycles. The
trough on this basis would have been .6 book in 89/90. We'd have to drop
another 40% to be there even if the multiple to book was a valid
measure...which frankly I doubt.

This company has been in business making flooring and related products since
1891. They have a strong commitment to shareholder value as evidenced (at least
to me) by the amount of the Free Cash Flow (Timba-style) that they gave back in
the form of dividends.

<pre>Year Free Cash Flow/Share Dividend/share
1995 3.77 1.40
1996 2.18 1.56
1997 2.39 1.72
1998 2.27 1.88
1999 4.24 1.92
2000 -3.03 1.44</pre>

In 1998 the warning signs started appearing about liability for asbestos injury
that may have occurred due to asbestos having been contained in some of the
products they had manufactured some 20 years earlier and had not manufactured
since. As the popularity of the asbestos litigation grew, so did the need for
ever increasing liability reserves. They settled scores of thousands of cases
without trial but scores of thousands kept being filed in class-action suits.
In 2000, Armstrong filed for bankruptcy protection. Management had decided to
let the bankruptcy court figure it all out so that they could get on with their
normal business at some point.

They have recently filed a reorganization plan to come out of bankruptcy and
this plan has the approval of 75% of the litigants.

The plan can be viewed here:
http://www.armstrong.com/common/uscorp/content/files/2835.pdf

The press coverage of the plan has been less than complementary with this being
typical of what I've seen:
http://www.forbes.com/2002/11/29/cz_rl_1129soapbox.html?partner=yahoo&referrer=

I believe the press has misinterpreted the above referenced reorganization
plan, and so has most of the market. Section 7.4 of the plan indicates, to me,
that Armstrong is funding the plan with 60-70 Million shares out of 215
Million, which is about 1/3 of the company. Additionally, they are not giving 1
Billion dollars to the claimants, they are giving 600 million (300 unsecured,
300 asbestos trust)

Now I'm not exactly approaching this company from a purely numbers-crunching
position (yet). I am approaching from a few conceptual viewpoints first. I
number these viewpoints just for my own clarity, but do not represent this
numbering as any indication of the priority of the issues. More than the
following points is the belief I have that this management team is a great one
and really committed to the shareholder.

First, Armstrong didn't file Chapter 11 because its business was bad or that
its business was unprofitable.

Second, the market for its business (flooring) is booming, but even when it
wasn't (look at the 1995, 1996, and 1997 cash flows) Armstrong was making
decent money flowing to the bottom line.

Third, regardless of how much of the company they give away, the remainder will
be worth something.

Fourth, not having the liability overhang, their profitability is likely to be
strong.

Fifth, they haven't "burned" their suppliers, employees, lenders or clients in
this reorg. They are honoring all long term debt, all executory contracts, all
promises to employees.

Sixth, they have a world-wide footprint and great name recognition.

So.....what are they selling for per share? They closed yesterday at the
expensive price of $.26/share!

Now, before anyone goes rushing out to buy, it would be very advisable to read
and understand the reorganization plan. Again, it looks to me that Armstrong is
giving away about 1/3 of the company's stock and about 600 million dollars to
settle all present and future asbestos claims. Current shareholders, it looks
like to me, will get warrants with which they will be able to buy shares in the
re-formed company.

I am not buying the current shares so I can exercise the new warrants, I am
buying the current shares because I believe the new warrants will trade on the
markets as a security in their own right for about 7 years, and that they will
have a value far in excess of the current stocks ridiculously low pricing. When
I sell, it will be the warrants I sell, and I'll make a decision at that time
whether or not I want to buy the stock of the new entity.

I think this company presents a challenge and an opportunity to the value
investor. This value investor doesn't look at bankrupt companies usually. But
then again, I haven't seen a world-class, non-tech, nicely profitable company
with great management selling for pennies a share either.

Happy Holidays to all!

Looking forward to the feedback!

.26 would be terribly expensive under the circumstances. Once the plan is
approved, the existing stock will be canceled, and new stock will be issued to
everyone EXCEPT existing shareholders. You're basically looking at a 100%
chance of a total loss.

If you were willing to take a position in a VERY highly speculative play,
you're only real chance of coming up with something with any kind of market
value would be the senior notes. I'm personally not set up to trade corporate
debt, and while I have a vague understanding of what the strategy might be,
have no hands on experience on this kind of play. The idea would be to purchase
some of the debt at a deep discount to face value and hope that eventually the
stock you receive in the swap will be worth more than you paid for the debt.
IMO, it's a play better left to those with a far higher level of expertise in
evaluating the level of risk involved, and that's assuming there is a current
market for the debt and there is an inventory of the debt available for sale.

Have a Merry Christmas and don't buy stock with a Q on the end of the ticker
symbol.

Hi Don!

.26 would be terribly expensive under the circumstances. Once the plan is
approved, the existing stock will be canceled, and new stock will be issued to
everyone EXCEPT existing shareholders. You're basically looking at a 100%
chance of a total loss.

While I agree that the "New Common Stock" is being issued to only the unsecured
creditors and the asbestos trust, I disagree with your statement of ...."100%
chance of total loss". The existing shareholders under Class 11, Treatment, per
the chart listed, in part, on page 19 of the reorg plan....and I quote: "If the
Holdings Plan of Liquidation is approved by the requisite shareholders of
Holdings prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date, the Holder of
the Equity Interests in AWI will receive the New Warrants (which will be
distributed in accordance with the Holdings Plan of Liquidation)."

As I said, I'm buying the current stock to get the warrants.

Are you saying that the holders of the equity of Armstrong will have no
ownership interest in the company that comes out? That doesn't make sense to
me. Why would management take the trouble to treat all other classes fairly and
then snub the shareholders who they demonstrated such respect for over the
entire course of the business?

Yes the existing shares will become null and void. Not disagreeing with that.
But that doesn't mean the existing shareholders won't be thrown a bone (or
more). At 26 cents a share, the bone doesn't have to be very big for one to
make a nice profit.

If you were willing to take a position in a VERY highly speculative play,
you're only real chance of coming up with something with any kind of market
value would be the senior notes.

While I can see how you may feel that way, I would guess that the Senior Notes
haven't been discounted that much because of the way they are being guaranteed
under the reorg. plan and would represent less of a bargain than the current
common stock. Typically this strategy would be a great way to get a great yield
on your money if you felt that the company would survive long enough to pay the
debt (like some of Tyco's notes a few months back), but I suspect (again, I
haven't explored the pricing on ACKHQ's debt) that the better value here is the
common stock.

Have a Merry Christmas and don't buy stock with a Q on the end of the ticker
symbol.

Thank you for the well wishes and the advice.

As the owner of common stock, you are an owner of the company, not a creditor.
In order for you, the owner, to receive any proceeds in a bankruptcy
reorganization, ALL other classes of creditors have to be made whole. It
doesn't have anything to do with "fair", it has to do with our bankruptcy
system as it currently exists. I can appreciate the incredulity of anyone with
any kind of sense of justice, but the fact of the matter is making assumptions
about right and wrong will cost you money in this type of situation. Perhaps
the most amazing part of the process is that shareholders are never given a
chance to vote against management issuing debt that automatically wipes out
their share of a company's equity.

The time it would take me to download the document you posted is more than I
would want to spend on a Q stock, let alone what it would take me to read it.
On the rare occasion warrants are issued to existing common in bankruptcy, it's
almost never a good deal. Plus, from when a plan is filed, to a company
actually emerging (if ever) from bankruptcy, is typically at least several
years. Most companies stop filing financial reports with the SEC after entering
bankruptcy, so to take any kind of position in the company requires going in
totally blind as far as the current financial condition of the company.

The Forbes article didn't have a negative slant, it was being kind. If this
really is the kind of company you want to own stock in, wait to see if it exits
bankruptcy, then wait another year for the creditors who got stuck with stock
to get done closing their positions.

Hopefully you'll get some additional feedback on "value" in bankrupt pink sheet
and otc stocks. It really is that bad, but I understand it's hard to grasp on
an emotional level just how bad it is for anyone who hasn't watched one play
out. I've only owned stock in one company that went bankrupt, but I made sure I
got my money's worth on the tuition I paid for my education. I think the
experience made me a better investor, but it did take a lot of the light
hearted optimism out of buying stock in highly leveraged companies.

Well, then I can clearly say that you don't know what your talking about
regarding ACKHQ, but if you want to continue to talk as though you do, that's
fine.

I have owned one other bankrupt company, and bought the shares while it was
still in bankruptcy. The company was a builder, NVR. When it came out of
bankruptcy, the existing shareholders got a 1 for 30 reverse split. I held onto
the stock for 5 or 6 years and, when I sold it, I averaged 14% per annum rate
of return on my initial investment for the entire holding period. So my
personal experience puts lie to what you are stating with such supposed
authority regarding outcomes when bankruptcy occurs.

Since I have explored and analyzed the financial statements on this company for
the last 7 years (and most recent 9 months) as well as took the incredibly long
amount of time to download the reorg. doc. (it was maybe a minute) and since I
took a couple of hours to review it thoroughly, I would suggest that you are
the one arguing from an emotional basis on this rather than I.

In order for you, the owner, to receive any proceeds in a bankruptcy
reorganization, ALL other classes of creditors have to be made whole. It
doesn't have anything to do with "fair", it has to do with our bankruptcy
system as it currently exists.

If you would take the time to read the reorg docs, instead of just applying
blind prejudice, you would see that this statement is as erroneous as some of
your others. The other creditors do not have to be made whole, they just have
to agree to the plan.

I can debate facts with you or anyone else to improve my understanding of them,
but I cannot and will not debate emotions or prejudice or contempt prior to
investigation.

I don't know how much research you think I should do, but I think that pretty
well covers it, and is typical of most reorganization plans. I assume if you
had found anything to suggest existing common get a share of the new issue, you
would have posted it. There's nothing in the paragraph you did post that
guarantees warrants will be issued, or at what ratio, or at what strike. You
have no idea (no one could) where the stock might trade if it does eventually
trade on a major exchange, or if a mystery strike on a mystery warrant
represents a good value compared to the mystery future price of the new issue.

Timba: I haven't looked at Armstrong recently but would suggest looking at it's
extended enterprise multiple with market cap and ALL debt like obligations
[Including converts and preferred] less cash in the numerator and all cash
flows to those obligations in the denominator before deciding this is cheap.
The low share price can be viewed as a 'call' on the residual, but without
knowing how far out of the money that 'call' is, it's hard to say it's
cheap...I would expect that when all obligations are considered, the price
reflects a way out of the money call. An online bond quoter showed Armstrong
bonds being offered @ <50% which doesn't reflect much hope for the lower
priority equity. OTOH, if there were ever a time for animal spirits to put wind
in the sales of beaten down speculative issues, it's now, so you may catch a
really nice bounce in Jan irrespective of the true value of equity's residual
claims.

While I do a multiple based on using the cash flow, it is not in the format of
"enterprise multiple". I find that using "market cap" as any part of my
determination of value will give me a volatile measuring device, as the formula
in no small measure depends on how the market is voting at the point in time
that I make the calculation. [For the initiate, market cap is market price that
day times the number of shares outstanding].

Instead, I like to use the cash flow and compare it to what it would cost me to
purchase that same cash flow safely (say a CD). I admit to some laziness in
this regard as I find it too much work to keep up with CD rates on a frequent
basis, so I use 6% as a proxy. If I'm to assume the risk of the stock market, I
want to be compensated for it. What I look for is twice the safe rate as a
minimum return.

So...if I find that a company has Free Cash Flow (by my conservative derivation
of that number) of, let's say, $1.20/share, then $1.20 divided by 12% (twice
the CD rate I use) is $10.00/share which is the highest price at which I be
willing to buy the shares of that company, given that cash flow.

Of course, this is not my only determination of value in my buying decisions,
but it is the critical test that, if not passed, I stop my research into that
company.

Well Don, I really try to make my investment decisions based on more than an
article in a financial publication. They may be correct in what they write, or
they may not. They are journalists, trying to do a story that will sell copy. I
posted the story as a pretty good example of what I have seen as the press
coverage of the Armstrong reorg plan, not as an investment guide, although some
I guess might use it as such.

. You have no idea (no one could) where the stock might trade if it does
eventually trade on a major exchange, or if a mystery strike on a mystery
warrant represents a good value compared to the mystery future price of the new
issue.

I would suspect that none of us have the crystal ball which is clear enough for
this kind of projection, and I hope that my not having one doesn't discredit me
so much that anything I might say has no merit.

I don't buy an interest in a company because I know what price it will trade at
some day in the future. I buy because the cash flow I'm buying is cheap
relative to alternative choices for capital employment. Of course, underlying
all of that is the assumption that some day I will be able to sell the
ownership interest at a price more fairly representative of the value of that
cash flow. I have one of the Graham sayings embedded in my soul: "In the short
run the market is a voting machine, in the long run a weighing machine." While
this may not be the exact quote, I believe I captured the essence of the point
he was trying to get across with it.

I assume if you had found anything to suggest existing common get a share of
the new issue, you would have posted it. There's nothing in the paragraph you
did post that guarantees warrants will be issued, or at what ratio, or at what
strike. 

Actually, this is not quite correct. There are some assumptions I make when
reading the reorg plan. The first is that the court will ensure that those
items contained within the plan will be enforced as part of the finalization
process. This enforcement assumption gives me some confidence that indeed there
is a guarantee of action according to the details contained within the plan.

I will admit, that I am unclear as to what the number of those warrants will
be, however that they will be issued to existing shareholders if the plan is
adopted I consider is certain, providing that the existing shareholders vote to
accept the plan (however, the plan states if the existing shareholders don't
vote in favor of the plan, they'll get squat, so another assumption is that the
shareholders will approve it). As far as the strike price of the warrants, it
will be 125% of whatever the fair value of the company is determined to be by
Lazard in conjunction with the financial experts hired by the asbestos trust.
If one assumes they will derive a "book value" of sorts, then the warrant
strike price will be 1.25BV. The term of the warrants is 7 years from the
Effective Date.

The reason I didn't post more facts, Don, isn't that they weren't there. It was
because any written document is subject to some measure of interpretation by
the person reading it, and I didn't want to color the facts contained by
whatever biases I might bring to my reading of the plan. I have schooled myself
to be extremely objective when reading financial documents, as have most
successful investors, but that doesn't mean I have a "lock" on the "only true
meaning" of any document.

When I first visited this board back in 1997, there were frequent and heady
discussions of the financial statements and their meaning. It was in that
spirit that I posted this puzzle. I am not a proponent of investing in bankrupt
companies or "turn-arounds". Your points regarding how the vast majority of
them end up for those who hold any type of interest in them are good and valid
ones. However, there are the rare occasions when value may discovered in even
these situations.

I always enjoy reading your posts and am not trying to upset you, but how about
a reality check? 

I take my research pretty seriously. I take my public reputation equally
seriously. I hope I have never posted anything on this site about any company
that would lead the observer to believe that I deal in fantasy. I can accept if
you believe otherwise.

Any opinion/interest in FLOW?

It's the leading co. in its niche, albeit an out of favor niche. Selling at
fraction of book and sales and perhaps about to be forced into turning assets
into value. Important dates coming up in January.

From the last 10q:

<In order to improve our financial position and increase the likelihood that
the Lenders will grant the forbearances discussed above and agree to negotiate
a new credit facility, we have already taken some measures to reduce headcount
and operating costs and continue to explore a number of additional options to

reduction, facility and physical operations analysis, sale of non-core

I'm sorry to see FLOW here at such a low price. To me, it's always been the
leader in water-cutting technology, an important niche business. It looks like
there's a change in management which might be for the better. And maybe with
some judicious business decisions(and a little luck) the stock could go for 10
or more again - where it's often traded (up from roughtly 2.5 now). Stock's
usually traded at 2x-2.5x book value, and book value's about 4.5 now - assuming
no further writeoffs. So even at 1x book value it is a good gain from here (2.5
to 4.5) If management could just make a profit again and maybe get its typical
return on sales.

You asked for opinions/interest. My opinion is that management might very well
be able to turn this company around, and if so, the stock will rise. It seems
to me the company's position in this niche segment will help them. OTOH, as
regards interest, for me, I have no interest in the company at current price.
With outstanding debt greater than equity, and no evidence of an improving
business, it's just not a compelling buy for me. That could just be me though--
I'm in a lot of stocks -- too many-- that are turnaround candidates. I just
can't see the value enough to step into yet another one here.

I did go over parts of the plan, and can't find any fault with the Forbes view
point. I can also (if I squint) see your view that if warrants are issued they
might (if I squint) have some value.

I'm sure there are as many different views on what constitutes a value play as
there are value investors. IMO, there has to be something substantial to
provide some measure of protection to the downside, and if the downside is
breached, whatever that "substantial something" is, it will eventually cause a
correction which results in profits or at least something close to break even.

I've seen you do some very solid fundamental analysis on various issues. In the
case of Armstrong, there are just plain too many pieces of the puzzle missing
to arrive at any kind of value, and any attempt to do so requires making
unsubstantiated assumptions of the purely speculative variety. From where I'm
sitting it looks too speculative to build a case for it being a good value. Not
to mention that I view officers who bankrupt public companies as pond scum and
the Armstrong scam stinks of payoffs and kickbacks.

It's a mystery to me how fund managers can dump hundreds of millions of dollars
of other peoples money into these companies, and then not lift a finger to see
that shareholders committees are formed to protect the investment from corrupt
officers.

I do agree with you that the shareholder's place at the table of bankruptcy
proceedings needs to be improved. Especially for those situations where
liquidation is not a likely outcome.

While your use of it probably didn't have any positive connotations, I
understand that pond scum is alleged to have some beneficial uses! :~)

My first post to this on the subject of ACKHQ as a possible
coming-out-of-bankruptcy play was conceptual in its framework. Now I'll put a
few numbers together.

Some Assumptions I'm making:

1). "New Common" shares will be issued for the emerging from bankruptcy company
and they will be somewhere between 60 million shares on the low end and 70
million on the high end.

2). Warrants will be issued to existing shareholders to partially compensate
them for their equity interest and these warrants will be the total
compensation to the existing shareholders.

3). The number of warrants issued will be 5% of the "New Common" shares.

4). The number of existing shares of the bankrupt company is 40.7 million
shares.

5). The existing cash flow of the company at the existing number of shares is
$1.70/share.

Some manipulations of numbers using the above information:

5% of 60 million is 3 million new warrants on the low end; 5% of 70 million is
3.5 million new warrrants on the high end.

I'll use the lower number of new warrants, as this is the most conservative
approach.

Therefore, 3 million warrants replaces 40.7 million shares which means a
reverse split on the order of 13.567 to 1 [40.7/3.0=13.567]

To try and determine what the cash flow would look like for the new situation,
I took the current cash flow per share, multiplied it by the current number of
shares to get total cash flow and then divided it by the new number of shares
to get the cash flow per "New Common". I used 70 million as the number of new
shares, because, again, this represents a conservative approach: $1.70 X 40.7 =
69.19M divided by 70 = .988/share cash flow for the New Common.

So, what would I pay for .988/share cash flow? Well, I like to get twice the
going CD rates for a return for any money I invest in the market. I'm lazy so I
still use a 6% rate for CDs, so I'll use 12% as the rate of return I'd like to
have. (Again, this is conservative as a lower required rate would yield a
higher price that I'd pay). So, I divide .988 by .12 and get that I'd pay no
more than $8.23/share for that cash flow.

To convert that into today's common, remember that we will be looking at a
reverse split of 1 warrant for every 13.567 shares of common we currently hold.
So, if I divide 8.23 by 13.567 I get that I should pay no more than .607/share
for today's stock.

But wait, you say, surely the warrants aren't the same as buying the stock?
True enough, and very astute observing fellow value sleuths!

The reorg plan that has been filed indicates that the warrants will entitle the
holder of the warrants to buy the common at 125% of Fair Value. Since I don't
know what they say fair value will be, for this discussion, I'm going to use
.607/share as fair value for the current common stock, because that is what it
is for me. So, if I divide .607 by 1.25 (125% = 1.25), I get that the current
price should be .485/share.

It is currently selling at .26/share which is almost half of what I would
consider fair value using my conservative approach, which is why I am
interested.

By the way, although some of the numbers crunching I've done here may be
somewhat unconventional, it appears the "professionals" are not nearly as
conservative as I am.

According to page 82 of the 8K filed with the SEC as the Disclosure Statement
(which can be viewed here:
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000090951802000874/mv12-20ex99_1.tx
) , Lazard comes up with a value range for the warrants of between $11.10 and
$13.90 each. I hope they are more right than I am!! For, if they are, then
using the low end of their range: $11.10 divided by 13.567 means that the
current stock would be fairly valued (according to their methodology) at
$.81/share.

By the way, the intended Effective Date is 07/01/03. Since it appears that
Armstrong has the support of the litigants, who are the biggest block to be
concerned with, and since I believe I read somewhere that the lenders are on
board, and since the shareholders have no choice but to vote for the plan and
get warrants or vote against the plan and get nothing, I really don't see much
reason for this to be delayed.....even if I squint! :~}

Doesn't a higher estimate of fair value imply a higher warrant strike price and
therefore a lower warrant value? Don't you need to apply Black-Scholes or some
other option valuing method at this point?

Timba,

A couple things you missed: Shareholders don't get to vote on the plan. If the
warrants are approved, it will be by the class 6 creditors, which I believe are
the unsecured creditors. I'll speculate that there isn't much downside to the
warrants being approved, as if they are exercised, it puts money back into the
creditors pockets, and if they aren't, no big deal.

The filing does give the "estimated" total value of the warrants as something
between $40-$50 million with a median range of $12.50 each, that would come to
about 3.6 million warrants to be distributed to the holders of 44 million
shares, or about 1 warrant for each 12 shares. If a person has enough blind
faith to accept those numbers, then the stock is worth around a buck a share.

Since the "estimate" is a $30 price range for the new common, you're probably
looking at something in the neighborhood of a $40 strike on the warrants. In
the real world, I don't think you're going to find a market for that many out
of the money options, and if there were a market for those options, selling
pressure is likely to be intense right out of the gate. I also think it's safe
to assume there will be an IPO connected with the company coming out of
bankruptcy, and a whole bunch of creditors looking for suckers to take a ton of
stock off their hands. I don't think I need to mention what the IPO market has
been like for the past few years. I'd be surprised to see the stock priced
North of $20, and $17-$18 strikes me as more likely. That would make those
options a real long shot in the $2-$3 range even with the long contract period.

To put things a little more in perspective, you can currently buy January 05
contracts with a $40 strike on INTC for .95. You don't have to wait for the
company to exit bankruptcy. You don't have to see if anyone will approve the
conversion of canceled stock into warrants. You don't have to guess if there's
a market for the contracts. And, you don't have to guess the market value of
the stock.

If you want to trade options, there's a lot easier way to do it than jumping
blind into OTC stocks in bankrupt companies. I don't think there's anything
wrong with looking at cash flow, but isn't that putting the cart before the
horse when you're sitting at a table with so many jokers in the deck?

Doesn't a higher estimate of fair value imply a higher warrant strike price and
therefore a lower warrant value? 

Yeeeessssss.....but I'm not sure where you are going with this. I made my own
estimate of Fair Value and it looks as though the "professionals" are
estimating much higher than I on both the "New Common" AND the new warrants.
So, I don't know how that fits in with your thinking.

Don't you need to apply Black-Scholes or some other option valuing method at
this point?

Well, if I were discounting the future value as part of my analysis I guess I
would want to use some formulation that does that. I've never given much value
to Black-Scholes, but they did win a Nobel Prize, so some folks put value in
their genius. If you are familiar enough and can do it, I would be interested
to see what value is derived using their methodology.

I like a lot of what you say here.

However, I don't think it follows at all that there will be an IPO and would be
interested to hear your thinking on why you think there would be? My reading of
the plan indicates that the Articles of Incorporation will be amended and the
company authorized to issue up to 215 million shares of which 15 million are to
be preferred shares. 60-70 million of the newly authorized amount will be "New
Common" and distributed per the plan. Since this is an existing company with
existing registered shares and the new authorized amount of shares is
essentially the same number as previously authorized, I don't see where an IPO
would come into it.

Regarding INTC options or other alternative investments, I'm sure there are
many others. Apparently almost any of them would appear better to you than
ACKHQ, and that's OK. We all have our comfort zones, and all who post here
regularly are more in touch with their own parameters than those at most other
threads I've seen.

You keep talking about options when speaking of these warrants, and while I
agree that there are some similarities, there are differences. The 7 year
window for the warrants being one of the most important. As near as I know,
there are no LEAPs that go that far out. Unless by "options" you are referring
more to the ESO variety rather than the publicly traded ones, I don't know.

I don't think there's anything wrong with looking at cash flow, but isn't that
putting the cart before the horse when you're sitting at a table with so many
jokers in the deck? 

No, I don't think so. This company has been in business since 1891, it's not
like it's a dot com. They have a long history of earnings and paying dividends
and the business they do hasn't been changed. The cash flow going forward
should be quite comparable to recent years with the added debt service for the
extra debt taken on as part of the settlement roughly offsetting the
disappearing amount they've been writing off for increasing asbestos
liabilities, so I think I'm not being unrealistic is using the financial
statements to determine income (which is how I view cash flow) and thus from
that to determine value to me of that income stream.

I don't really buy into Black-Scholes model but it would be one way to value
the warrants. Anyway, I've got no problem with your analysis of cash flow which
led you to a value per share of ~$8. However, the strike price of warrants
won't be at 125 % of your fair value, it will be at 125 % of the higher value
that the settlement places on the new common. So I didn't follow the part where
you came up with a value for the warrants based on your fair value of the new
common. (IF that's what you did.)

Hi Steven

However, the strike price of warrants won't be at 125 % of your fair value, it
will be at 125 % of the higher value that the settlement places on the new
common. So I didn't follow the part where you came up with a value for the
warrants based on your fair value of the new common. (IF that's what you did.) 

Well, I must admit that I'm not sure of the validity of using this approach to
this step of the problem myself. However, the reason I did was I felt that I
had to adjust downward to account for the swap multiple between the warrants
and the New Common. Not knowing what some other party might use for value, I
felt it was consistent to use the value I derived as if it would be the same as
the value some other party would derive. I also felt that any number I arrived
at using this technique would still be consistent with being conservative in
approach.

Your point that the higher the value of the stock, the lower the value of the
warrant doesn't necessarily follow in my mind. Because of the 125% of Fair
Value fixed conversion rate, the value of the warrant should increase pretty
much in lock step with the stock.

What do you think?

The initial market value of the warrant certainly would increase with the
initial market value of the stock (and thus indirectly with the strike price)
but its not related to your value of the stock. So it might be a warrant to buy
a stock that you value at $8 (perhaps growth in the 7 years might justify
12-15) for $30. Therefore, you aren't buying the warrant to buy the stock but
to sell it back to the market. Which depends on a discount to the market value
of the warrant once it trades. Which will depend on the B-S (or some other
b.s.) model of the warrant value. Unless the stock once trading drops to close
to your value estimate rather than the settlement estimate. In which case,
you'll have a far out of the money option. At least, that's what I think.

That's correct. I've said all along that the reason I would buy the stock today
is to get the warrants and that at some point down the road I might revisit the
issue and see if I wanted to convert the warrants to stock or not. I want to
get the warrants because I believe the current pricing of the stock is way over
discounted and that condition will correct itself by, at, or just shortly after
the Effective date.

If, in the calculations I don't divide my cash flow by 125%, I would have a
higher valuation than I feel is justifiable to myself. After all, if I am
conservative in all my assumptions, the only thing that happens is that I have
a higher margin of safety (I can hear Don getting apoplectic on me for using
that phrase in this situation :~}) built into the final product.

Would you make any adjustment for the conversion or not?

Timba,

<<<You keep talking about options when speaking of these warrants>>>>

If it looks like a duck..... Anyhow, whether you call it a warrant or an
option, it's still a contract to purchase stock at a specified price, within a
specified period of time. Your point that leaps don't go out that far, is at
least in part the point I was trying to make. There isn't a market for
contracts that go out that far, and the reason being there's a break point
where it stops making sense to purchase options at a price that becomes a large
percentage of purchasing the stock outright. The market seems to like the
shorter dated contracts, and the farther out you go, the smaller the open
interest.

I still think you're looking at your trade from the wrong perspective. For all
practical purposes it's an option play at roughly $3 per share on the new
common. There probably won't be a market for the warrants, so the only way to
realize a profit is to be able to exercise the contracts at a price at least $3
above the strike. As I see it, whatever analysis you apply to the trade would
have to justify a reason to believe the stock will be undervalued at that
level. Any analysis you do will automatically be flawed because of the lack of
hard numbers to plug into the formula. You can make some ballpark estimates
going off the numbers included in the filings, but the only thing you know for
sure is those estimates have not been market tested.

Whatever formula you end up using has to justify a trading range above your
strike for the trade to make sense. Option play is tricky enough without
throwing a bunch of variables into the equation, but let's say your strike is
the 125% number you've been using, of the $30 price included in the filings,
that gives your strike at $37.50, plus the $3 you paid for the contracts, or a
$40.50 market price as your break even point. With all due respect, I don't
think you're going to be able to justify why Armstrong without a Q is the
bargain of a lifetime at that level, even with 7 years to play with.

Well, I can say you certainly are a challenge and I'll keep addressing your
issues for now, not out of the hope of changing your mind, because I don't
believe that your mind is open to change. However, I'll keep addressing the
issues because it helps me think through more clearly some things that I
perhaps only gave glancing attention to on my first dozen readings of the
financials and reorg plans.

Your point that leaps don't go out that far, is at least in part the point I
was trying to make. There isn't a market for contracts that go out that far,
and the reason being there's a break point where it stops making sense to
purchase options at a price that becomes a large percentage of purchasing the
stock outright.

So what, you're saying there isn't a market for 30 year bonds, because they go
out too far until pay-off? Or are you saying that your analogy of 7 year
warrants as options falls apart because I pointed out there are no 7 year
options, so you'll declare "no market" for the warrants? Neither argument has
substance, so I'll move on.

Option play is tricky enough without throwing a bunch of variables into the
equation...

You mean like calling something an option that isn't one?

There probably won't be a market for the warrants, so the only way to realize a
profit is to be able to exercise the contracts at a price at least $3 above the
strike.

Are you saying that there isn't a market for any warrants or just Armstrong's?
If you'll look in the WSJ, you'll find plenty of warrants being traded, so it
must be something I missed about Armstrong that would prevent there being a
market in their warrants? This is America, there's a market for everything!

Whatever formula you end up using has to justify a trading range above your
strike for the trade to make sense. 

Why? If the current stock is under-priced due to market over-reaction, all it
has to do is come back to conservative fair value of the cash flow for me to
have a double from here.

...let's say your strike is the 125% number you've been using, of the $30 price
included in the filings, that gives your strike at $37.50, plus the $3 you paid
for the contracts, or a $40.50 market price as your break even point. With all
due respect, I don't think you're going to be able to justify why Armstrong
without a Q is the bargain of a lifetime at that level, even with 7 years to
play with. 

I never claimed it to be "the bargain of a lifetime". I claimed it to be a
puzzle and possibly a reasonable value play.

Just for giggles, I went back through the stock prices for Armstrong to 1995
and here are my findings from then until the final quarter of 2000 when they
filed Chapter 11 due to asbestos litigations:
<pre> Year High Price Low Price
2000 36.81 .75
1999 64.31 29.00
1998 90.00 46 15/16
1997 75 3/8 61 1/2
1996 75 1/4 51 7/8
1995 64 1/8 38 3/8</pre>

This chart tells me several things: 1). the price point you say the stock has
to get to is not unusual territory for this stock; 2). there is enough
volatility in this stock for trading ranges; and 3). The price has been to
these levels within the last 3 years even with the overhang of asbestos
liability, so without it, who knows?

Surely there will be selling pressure on the New Common stock as it is
distributed to the litigants and they sell it for whatever reasons. But I look
at that pressure not starting immediately, so I'll have some opportunity,
perhaps to capture a nice profit early in the trading of the new warrants
(provided of course that there's a market). And I look for most of that selling
pressure to be over within 3 years as I believe there are time constraints
imposed for timely settling of affairs by the trust.

I'm not sure how much of the early selling pressure will be abated by the
buying of pension funds and mutual funds, but since this will be a world-class
company again after emergence, I suspect there will be some interest on the
part of those entities.

Keep swinging away, Don! You help get my blood moving, but I know you are not
directing it at me, just the idea. (At least, I hope I have at least that much
right!)

I agree about the adjustments to high low prices to account for different
shares outstanding. I didn't do it because the exact number of "New Common"
isn't yet known, but using 70 would be in line with being conservative. Even
with the adjustments, the old shares have traded right at the derived necessary
strike according to Don's methodology. And have done so within the last 3
years: 64.31 x (40/70) = 37.00 and the year before that the high was 90 so: 90
x (40/70) = 51.429. Which is 50% higher than that target.

To me, though the whole approach, while interesting to explore, is not at all
valid to how I made my determination of value. I outlined that in a previous
post.

just nitpicking and thinking that your proposed investment is quite risky...too
many unknowns and variables. 

That's OK. There are always too many unknowns and variables, yet we manage to
make a market anyway.

I'm not recommending that anyone invest (or speculate, if you will) in
Armstrong. There are a lot of companies who are seriously affected by asbestos
litigation and it appears as though Armstrong is the first to be emerging from
the havoc. They may have struck the worst deal to come out, we may not know for
some time. However, this issue will be revisited, I suspect, by many different
companies and at least some discussion of the considerations involved has been
spurred in this debate on Armstrong.

I have decided, thanks in part to the clarifying of my thinking that has been
effected through this debate to take a decent sized position in the current
common stock (Well, at least the number of shares sounds impressive, even if
the dollar amount involved isn't estate shattering!). I will keep the board

helpful and improved the level of civility and crispness of posts.

As we know, value investors have different ideas about value. So after about 20
posts on a particular stock, each person ought to be able to have concluded
whether that stock is or is not a suitable find. The purpose of this thread is
to "look for" (i.e. find) value plays. Once found then, it seems reasonable
that continual discussion of the particular stock be moved to a thread devoted
to it.

Of course, within SI rules, anyone can post however, whenever, whatever, and

Please accept my apologies for the recent spate of posts regarding my attempts

Apparently this board has moved in a direction different that what I perceived
was the original focus, which to to discover and debate not only the respective
merits of different companies, but also to challenge, if necessary those
accepted (and perhaps entrenched) paradigms that we sometimes find ourselves
coloring our perceptions of reality with.

Rarely over the last couple of years have I seen rigorous debate here over the

Given the recent reaction by respected members of the thread, I must conclude
that it my perception and/or approach in this series has been at fault and has

I think we kept it under the 20 post limit (or pretty close) and regardless of
whether or not it hit everyone's buy button, I don't think it hurts anything to
occasionally dig a little deeper than, "I found this Yahoo profile and like the
PE.". Years ago I had a professor who's favorite saying was, "I dare you to
take the time to learn something well, and then never use the information.".
IMO, all research eventually pays off even if it doesn't result in a trade in
one particular issue.

The first time I read a SEC filing, it took several hours and I probably
grasped about every third sentence. After reading a ton of SEC filings I am
usually able to skim through them and find the key points I'm interested in
with a minimum amount of time invested. I'm sure I "wasted" a lot of time
looking at unsuitable investments, but learning how to do better research is
something I believe is an edge in today's market. With the amount of
information available a mouse click away, if I don't know how to find and use
that information, I'm going to get stomped flat by thinking I can go heads up
against the players who do.

I assume most of those who post their various picks have looked at the
companies and have some reason to believe they represent some kind of value. We
probably got a little carried away with Armstrong, but I don't think it hurts
anything to see some extra discussion on the strategy behind different stocks,
along with a little background information to fill in the picture. And of
course, anyone who gets bored can always jump in with a pick that's so hot,
we'll all get rich over night.

SEC Proposes Making Companies Disclose Off-Books Debt (Update1)

The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed that U.S. companies be required
to disclose an estimated $3 trillion in off-balance-sheet debt, a reaction to
Enron Corp.'s collapse.

The fact that as little as 30% of the stock market may presently be bankrupt
has to do with value.

Isn't it funny? It's almost 2003 and NOW Officer Friendly the SEC garbage is
gathering up the courage to order its owners to disclose a cool 3 trillion in
debt hidden off balance sheets.

What'll they do next? Order major U.S. stock watering scams to write off much
of their worthless shares by reverse splits?

I find your posts well researched and really informative, in particular
Armstrong was a very instructive example. I also found the intellectual debate
very interesting, and I hope that everyone can take it in the spirit that I
believe it was meant, I mean after all that's what makes a horserace.

I have read some of your posts on a few boards. You've been pretty busy lately.
It looks as though you're on a mission or something...

I found Timbabear's discussion worthwhile, but wonder whether an attempt to put
the subject company in the first line of each post might not also add value.
That way readers who had eliminated Armstrong, for example, as a possible
investment would be able to skip over additional posts about that company. Not
perfect, but perhaps an improvement. I know of excellent boards which make a
point of getting the subject of a post on the first line here on SI for just
that reason. Personally, I don't go back to the post list between posts and
would have to read the first line of each post anyway. I also find displaying
ten posts at a time to be very time effective as one does not have to wait
between posts.

Best Regards, Lance

Timba: If I read you correctly, you're primarily expressing preference for a
yield over a multiple...and comparing that yield, cash flow yield, to
normalized CD rates. A yield, of course, is simply the reciprocal of a multiple
- 6% is the same as 16.7 multiple. A matter of personal preference without much
real difference, methinks.
The enterprise vs market cap issue, to me is more substantive, in that the
market cap approach ignores debt levels where the enterprise perspective
adjusts for debt levels thus providing a better comparable whether looking at
it as a multiple or as the reciprocal yield. EV/EBITDA is the most popular
enterprise measure, but I've come to subtracting Capex from Ebitda or using FCF
+ Interest in the denominator to produce 2 measures of EV/FCF, either of which
could be inverted to produce a yield.
