Partially OT.

At some point the high oil price is going to lead to recession or depression.
Although the economy is chugging along nicely, I am getting nervous with the
stock market making new highs together with oil. Even if we don't buy the
Peak-Oil doom and gloom (I only do partially), there is an oil price point
where the sales and profits start dropping.

The old wisdom was that you sold the market at ~$2 gas and bought it back at
~$1 gas. Now, we are past the $2 mark and will close to $3 soon, which might be
the new realistic selling mark (although it might be that we will never see $2
gas again). Those are rather random numbers, I don't have simple quantitative
metrics, but, as I said, I am somewhat nervous.

What to do though? I follow Buffett - mostly, because he has been market timing
a lot recently - and don't do much. Since I don't see a lot of buying
opportunities, I hold some cash I get when selling. I have some money in IGE
(natural resources, mostly oil CEF). And I am still in the period of my life
where monthly 401(k) contributions will continue buying the market (S&P) even
as it dips. That's pretty much it.

Other people may have their own methods to deal with the current situation.
Just don't be surprised if we get a dip to ~1K in S&P and similar dips in other
indices.

Peak-oilers will tell you that the situation is much worse, but I ain't one of
them. :)

Somewhat cautious Jurgis

Started an exploratory position today in NFB.

Bank location, history of dividend increases, current dividend yield, return on
assets... are attractive.

Not sure if it's the right time in the business cycle to be buying these
regional banks or specifically NFB, but I will try an exploratory position.

Jurgis Bekepuris. You might be very right.

Regarding: "Just don't be surprised if we get a dip to ~1K in S&P and similar
dips in other indices."

I won't be surprised, but I will be crying. I hope not too much on this thread.
It won't be a pretty sight.

I keep adding and adding and adding to my oil stock plays. If I posted every
time I did this, this would become the de facto Paul Senior thread--- with
people yipping at me to shut up already.

Somehow I've gotten off track. Instead of trying to be balanced and looking for
bargains (however defined), I've largely (in a very unbalanced way) just gone
along with the flow on these oil stocks. Of course, since there's no way for a
normal person (me- in the old days) to really understand the innards of even
simple companies (how much is hedged if anything now vs. future; how much are
probable reserves vs. accounting reserves; for whose benefit are the companies
being run - insiders with options vs. all stockholders; and who are these
people running these companies - salesmen who suck up money for their drilling
programs or business people with their own money on the line?, etc. etc. - I am
VERY diversified across many subsectors and within those subsectors too.

------On following Buffett--------

I'm surprised and disappointed that we're not reading more of
I-follow-Buffett-and-he-bought-oil-so-I-followed-him-and- bought-oil-too. Or
something like, "Senior, if you just followed Buffett and bet on him, you
wouldn't have to dissipate your psychic energy and diversify all over the
place"

I can't be the only one around here still holding some PTR:

re OIl stocks. I don't know where the oil price is going either. The once thing
is sure - oil will go up and stay there until demand wanes. This will more
likely happen in developing countries. Why? Increasing energy prices don't
matter much for many in the US. I personally pay nor 30$/week in gas instead of
20$ three years ago. This is no big deal, but for somebody who has 1/5 or less
of my disposable income, spending the same $ amount for gas might hurt and
should crimp consumption. Those type of supply/demand changes always happen at
the margin. I suspect that the volatile economy in developing countries will
hurt much more from high energy prices then the US/Europe/Japan. But we will
see - one way or the other, this will be resolved. Interesting enough, the low
LT interest rates in the bond market seem to suggest that a recession is more
likely than inflation. We shall see.

re BMW - i still own my position. Up now 50% in Euro terms and even more in

and lower US$. It's well managed and should do well LT, unlike most other car

re PVD. 20F for 2004 out(equivalent of 10k). Earnings were 0.18c/ADS x15 = 2.7$
per ADR. Dividend of 0.12c/ADS=1.80$/ADR. Not bad for a stock that trades at
28$. As i mentioned before PVD is a pension fund provider in Chile. it
essentially runs mutual funds for a fee, with some insurance strings attached.
It's business model is closer to a T. Rowe Price than to an insurance company.
Despite the recent run, i believe the stock is still fairly cheap.

This_is_the_end: You're not the only one who likes ACC.

Current Barron's interview with Marty Cohen of Cohen and Steers Fund:

"The other area I like is student housing. American Campus Communities is my
pick there. There is a huge demand for student housing and little new supply.
And campus housing has typically been poorly managed by the university or
whomever they've contracted it out to. So if you can get a company that really
knows what they are doing and has access to capital and systems, then you've
got a real winning combination there."
-------
As I often say, I find it better for me to pick several or all in a sector in
which I'm interested rather than try find the one "best" stock from among the
candidates. If I pick only one it seems that it's never the best one -
sometimes it turns out to be among the worst. I'd rather have the average
performance from several than just go with a single pick.
All this to say that I've picked two of the three in this niche, and (again)
the one I avoided, ACC, has so far turned in the best performance. Ah well, one
counts one's blessings. I'll once again look at ACC - maybe I can convince
myself it's not too late to add it also.

Unfortunately, there is no way to avoid this and in the same time participate
in the upside. That's why I follow the "long term hold" philosophy together
with raising some cash and some oil investments.

Re: Oil stocks. Yeah, I don't understand them at all, that's why I buy IGE. I

Bought 1/2 positions in travel stocks TSG and EXPE.
Both are good business with high FCF (low capex and working ) capital. They are
the leaders in their respective markets - TSG own the market leading SABRE
booking system and the Travelocity website (23% market share). EXPE own Exedia
and Hotel.com website with more than 40% market shares. Both stocks are cheap,
IMO. TSG trades at a PE of 13, EXPE trades at and EV/EBITDA of around 11, if my
calculation is correct. EXPE stock has fallen from grace after the spinoff from
Interactive, which is a good chance to own a stake in the most attractive IACI
business at a reasonable price. I admit that the "noncash" stock option expense
is fairly high, but that number has been coming down quickly over the years.

I still need to investigate EXPE numbers some more, the EBITDA number above is
only a rough estimates based on the SEC prospectus. IACI's number are very
convoluted through acquisitions etc. and EXPE's as a recent spinoff is
difficult to evaluate as a standalone entity as well but it's fairly obvious
that EXPE generate a fair amount of FCF.

To raise some cash, i sold my starter position in BFCF at a modest profit. I
also sold some VIA but still hold a full size position (I was overweight, when
the stock went to 32$). I think marketswill offer some bargains in September.

Travel stocks are too risky, IMHO, in this environment. High fuel costs
eventually passed on to consumers and terrorism means less travel and thus less
profit for travel related businesses. The risk/reward is not there at present.
Combine that with the economy sputtering and you may have a recipe for
disaster. JMHO

re Travel stocks -

 Travel stocks are too risky, IMHO, in this environment. High fuel costs
eventually passed on to consumers and terrorism means less travel and thus less
profit for travel related businesses. .

I don't think this simple logic applies. Of course it is true that less travel
means less business for a transaction facilitator like Travelocity or Expedia.
however i do believe that gross margins will go the other way. With less
travel, Hotels and airlines will be more desperate to fill their room/seat
capacity. If you read the analyst & earnings reports reports you find that the
recent boom in travel has reduced their margins. Both EXPE and TSG have become
wholesale operaters, securing large chunks of capacity and selling them
individually, right now they are having trouble to buy capacity at a reasonable
discount, LT I bet they won't.

Even if above logic were not true, TSG and EXPE don't have huge fixed costs and
depreciation on fixed assets.I would be much more scared owning stock in hotel
or rental car companies.

Sold Blair yesterday. (BL)

I purchased BL when it was first mentioned on this thread back in 1999 by James
Clarke who I hope is out there somewhere to receive my sincere appreciation.

That investment handily beat the market over that span of time and paid a
sizable dividend -- I believe over 6% per annum based upon my purchase price at
the time. I attribute this excellent return to a genuine Grahm net net.

I bought additional shares when I heard that a Hedge Fund, Loeb Partners, took
a large position and expressed interest in discussing with management
alternatives for increasing shareholder value. The balance sheet protected
downside risk and I valued the company at around $48.00 per share.

Eventually the company announced a dutch tender offer of half of its
outstanding shares for $42.00 per share and I debated whether to tender or sell
and finally sold. I anticipated that perhaps nearly all of the outstanding
shares might be tendered and wasn't sure that the residual entity met the value
criteria that I prefer. I will wait for the dust to clear and see what's left
over after the tender and consider buying shares again. Hopefully BL might fall
off the radar screen again and the price will drop to comfortable levels again.

I thank you again Jame Clarke, wherever you might be.

Whoops, forgot some fundamentals to mull over regarding ICICI
Bank, IBN.

ICICI Bank - Performance Review - Quarter ended June 30, 2005: 23% year-on-year
growth in profit after tax
Saturday July 30, 7:19 am ET

Bank Limited (NYSE:IBN - News) at its meeting held at Mumbai today, approved
the audited Indian GAAP accounts of the Bank for the quarter ended June 30,
2005 (Q1-2006).

from Rs. 66,780 crore (US$ 15.3 billion) at June 30, 2004.
Operating review

Credit growth

The Bank's net customer assets increased 40% to Rs. 103,487 crore (US$ 23.8
billion) at June 30, 2005 compared to Rs. 73,701 crore (US$ 16.9 billion) at
June 30, 2004. The Bank maintained its growth momentum and market leadership in
the retail segment. In Q1-2006, the Bank's total retail disbursements were
about Rs. 11,700 crore (US$ 2.7 billion) including home loan disbursements of
about Rs. 4,600 crore (US$ 1.1 billion). Retail assets constituted 63% of
advances and 60% of customer assets. The Bank is focusing on loan origination
in the retail and agriculture segments and on non-fund based products and
services, as well as capitalising on opportunities presented by the domestic
and international expansion of Indian companies. The Bank is also extending its
reach in the small and medium enterprises segment.

Funding

The Bank's deposits increased 70% to Rs. 113,778 crore (US$ 26.1 billion) at
June 30, 2005 from Rs. 66,780 crore (US$ 15.3 billion) at June 30, 2004,
compared to the banking system's year-on-year deposit growth of 15% as on July
8, 2005. During Q1-2006, the Bank repaid about Rs. 1,600 crore (US$ 368
million) of erstwhile ICICI's liabilities as they fell due in accordance with
their terms of repayment. At June 30, 2005, erstwhile ICICI's liabilities
constituted 11% of the Bank's funding compared to 25% at June 30, 2004.

International operations

ICICI Bank continued to build on its existing presence in various geographies
as well as enter new markets. During Q1-2006, the Bank acquired the entire
paid-up capital of Investitsionno-Kreditny Bank (IKB), a Russian bank with its
registered office in Balabanovo in the Kaluga region and a branch in Moscow. At
March 31, 2005, IKB had total assets of about US$ 4 million. The Bank's
subsidiaries have two branches in the United Kingdom and four branches in
Canada. In addition to providing credit and trade finance solutions to Indian
companies, the Bank is expanding its international retail franchise through
technology-based banking services.

Rural banking

The Bank's rural banking strategy seeks to adopt a holistic approach to the
financial services needs of various segments of the rural population, by
delivering a comprehensive product suite encompassing credit, transaction
banking, deposit, investment and insurance, through a range of channels. The
Bank's rural delivery channels include branches, internet kiosks, franchisees
and micro-finance institution (MFI) partners. The Bank has established about
5,000 points of contact through its various channels and channel partners.

Network

The Bank had 573 branches and extension counters at June 30, 2005 as compared
to 469 branches and extension counters at June 30, 2004.

Capital adequacy

The Bank's capital adequacy at June 30, 2005 was 12.04% (including Tier-1
capital adequacy of 7.57%), well above RBI's requirement of total capital
adequacy of 9.0%. The Bank has considered risk weightage at 125% for commercial
real estate exposure and capital markets exposure in line with the guidelines
issued by Reserve Bank of India on July 26, 2005.

Asset quality

The Bank's net restructured assets at June 30, 2005 were Rs. 6,209 crore (US$
1.4 billion), down from Rs. 7,264 crore (US$ 1.7 billion) at June 30, 2004. At
June 30, 2005, the Bank's net non-performing assets constituted 1.96% of
customer assets against 2.73% at June 30, 2004.

Group companies

ICICI Securities achieved a profit after tax of Rs. 35 crore (US$ 8 million) in
Q1-2006 compared to a full year profit of Rs. 64 crore (US$ 15 million) for the
year ended March 31, 2005 (FY2005). ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company
(ICICI Lombard) enhanced its leadership position among private sector general
insurance companies with a market share of 29% in Q1-2006. ICICI Lombard
achieved a profit after tax of Rs. 17 crore (US$ 4 million) in Q1-2006.

ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company (ICICI Prudential Life) continued to
maintain its market leadership among private sector life insurance companies.
Life insurance companies worldwide require five to seven years to achieve
breakeven, in view of business set-up and customer acquisition costs in the
initial years as well as reserving for actuarial liability. While the growing
operations of ICICI Prudential Life had a negative impact of Rs. 47 crore (US$
11 million) on the Bank's consolidated profit after tax in Q1-2006 on account
of the above reasons, the company's unaudited New Business Achieved Profit
(NBAP) for Q1-2006 was Rs. 69 crore (US$ 16 million). NBAP is a metric for the
economic value of the new business written during a defined period. It is
measured as the present value of all the future profits for the shareholders,
on account of the new business based on standard assumptions of mortality,
expenses and other parameters. Internationally, life insurance companies in the
growth phase are valued as a multiple of their NBAP.

ICICI Venture Funds Management Company announced the first closing of its real
estate fund with commitments of US$ 200 million, while the India Advantage Fund
continued to perform well and made its maiden distribution to its investors.
Prudential ICICI Asset Management Company was the largest private sector mutual
fund in India at June 30, 2005 with assets under management of over Rs. 17,000
crore (US$ 3.9 billion).

I guess Im going to hold mine for greener pastures. Yahoo shows a $5.84 book
value and I fear I was a little overly pessimistic when the stock was down.

Still hoping for some kind of buyout or merger that gets us somewhere close to
book value.

As the price dropped, I was very concerned. Now its up and Im a little more
optimistic which is not usual for me. (Oftentimes, Im trading them but not
here)

I guess I just assume their are leaks when companies are negotiating things
even though in many cases there are not.
In many cases, the good news seems to leak ahead of time too though.

One of my largest holdings, MAIN has been doing very well so I have been
lightening up on it as the momentum folks roll in.

Took a small position in WSZZ.ob at 81-84 cents. Wanted more but couldnt get it
and I hate to pay up. They have cash, cash flow and noted value author Paul
Sonkin keeps buying as well as 2 other large holders. Not going to make me rich
but I figure its a "safe" bet for a market Im worried about.

-----
Also I wanted to mention FSP here because of the insider buying. (No position,
but Im looking for income stocks)

Its a REIT and whats interesting, besides the dividend, is that multiple
insiders have been buying.

It seems its a merger of some private investment partnerships or something.

To be honest, its probably above my level of competence which is why I thought
I would ask for others opinions.

Franklin Street Properties Corp. ("FSP"), a real estate investment trust, is in
the real estate investment business. Since its origination in 1997, FSP has
experienced growth by applying an uncompromising discipline to its real estate
investing. These disciplines have been learned over many years of property
investment and reflect the natural characteristics of real estate as an asset
class within the broader capital markets.

FSP operates in two business segments:

REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS: FSP owns an unleveraged portfolio of real estate, which
includes apartment complexes, office buildings and industrial use properties.
Its real estate operations include leasing, interim acquisition financing and,
through our subsidiary, FSP Property Management LLC, asset/property management
services.

FSP offers a product/strategy that is different from most, if not all, of its
competitors. FSP's knowledge of the real estate industry and understanding of
its return generating characteristics allows it to identify superior assets for
investment. Unlike most real estate investment companies, which utilize varying
degrees of leverage in an attempt to enhance their real estate portfolio's
returns, FSP employs no leverage. This business model significantly reduces the
risk profile of FSP's product offering by more appropriately matching the
long-term nature of real estate as an asset class with "permanent" equity. By
eliminating foreclosure, financing and refinancing risk from the product
offering, FSP is able to offer better-quality risk-adjusted returns. FSP
believes it can significantly lower investment risk while enhancing current
income and long-term appreciation potential by owning property on an all-cash
basis (i.e.; without any mortgage debt), and diversifying property investments
by type (i.e.; residential, office and industrial) and geographic location.

INVESTMENT BANKING/INVESTMENT SERVICES:
Our subsidiary, FSP Investments LLC (member, NASD and SIPC), a real estate
investment banking firm and a registered broker/dealer, organizes single
purpose entities that own real estate and conducts the private placement of
equity in those entities.

FSP provides its shareholders with the opportunity to participate not only in
the rental income and appreciation potential of its properties, but also in the
income from all other business activities that are part of what has become a
nationally-recognized real estate investment bank and property manager.

Hi Paul --- hope all is well over here...

there are two micro-caps that i am accumulating at current prices that i think
are worth bringing to your attention -- at least to put them on radar:

SPAZ - must go here: http://www.spatializer.com/

then look here: [sec filing] http://tinyurl.com/ad6rz

they have been around a long time and seem to be forever in taking off -- sales
are still lower than they were around 5 years ago --- BUT, they have gotten
pretty lean and managed to turn a profit recently.

PCLP - http://www.paperclip.com

looks to me like the company is WAY better off than it was a year ago --- just
not reflected in the stock price. sales have improved even though they recently
lost a large customer. they are small and struggling but i like the looks of
the product, however would like to REALLY see how it works [not just the
concept - which i understand] right now, any product that conserves natural
resources has my attention.

Paul,

Understanding accounting never hurts for balance sheet analysis of value
stocks, but this can be picked up on an accounting class or on your own.

The other broad information is like an intangible asset that may or may not be
useful. It might help you strategically position a portfolio or particular
investment or evaluate the relative value across asset classes, but that also
depends on your ability to have relevant market insights based on your
knowledge and experience.

For example, high yield bonds have a pretty good correlation with the Russell
2k, as they both are a proxy for future performance of more speculative
companies. Spread analysis by Merrill's High Yield Group at the end of last
month showed that Russell 2k was likely to underperform. These cross-market
indicators might be say 55% accurate as opposed to a pure flip of a coin. A
portfolio manager might place a little bit of weight on these things as he or
she positions the portfolio.

Or say if you knew the existence of pipeline MLPs, and figure that they have
similar risk characteristics to Equity REITs, you might disdain an Equity REIT
at a 5% yield for a quality MLP at a 7% yield. Similarly, you might prefer to
own an Equity REIT closed-end fund at a 16% discount and 7.5% yield (albeit
leveraged) versus owning an Equity REIT outright. None of these things you need
a CFA to know about, but I am just arguing that having a broad understanding of
the market helps you find potential ways to spot opportunities and improve your
portfolio.

Of course, you could come with bad investing ideas if you have a bad intuition
on these things, which is why I'd still characterize it as goodwill or an
intangible asset.

FSP. Okay, I'll take a starter position.

Complicated,confusing, conflicting situation to my mind.

Unlevered real estate. But company seeks to prepare for increase in debt:

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/050817/175341.html?.v=1

Catch22 as regards their possible property sales:

"There are properties in our portfolio, which we believe have potential merit
as sale candidates for a variety of reasons, some "property specific" and some
"market driven". However, we generally consider sales of properties viable only
if there is a potentially better property in which to reinvest the sales
proceeds. Without any permanent mortgage debt and with significant cash already
on the balance sheet, property sales would generate cash that is not currently
needed for reserves or for mortgage debt pay down. Cash does not generate
significant returns these days, and, consequently, we are less likely to
consider any significant property sales until the Company has acquired other
properties that we believe have the potential to outperform the ones being
sold. Market conditions and pricing of potentially acceptable property
acquisitions have presented a challenge. However, potentially acceptable
acquisition and sale opportunities are appearing more likely for the second
half of 2005 and could, if consummated, positively impact 2005 second half
results."

"Opportunities" don't look as good now, but "more likely" later in 2005. Why?

Dividend seems to fluctuate now, more so than in past.

Has been in business several years - they emphasize their real estate
experience - but only recently as a public company.

------
Stock's a buy for me. Will MAYBE add a touch of stability to a portfolio.

Increasing dividend history.

http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=189918&p=irol-dividends

Maybe increases can continue. (maybe not) Maybe dividend yield on today's stock
price might be approaching 7%.

Buying stock today below prices some insiders recently paid.

Yeah, the debt announcement is a little bit of a conflict but its just $150
million while their marketcap is over a billion. It may be just to facilitate
transactions like where they are buying one to replace one they are selling but
the sale may close after the buy.

One thing that bothers me is that 3 of their VPs made BIG money from brokerage
commissions paid by FSP Investments in respect of the sale of preferred stock
in real estate investment trusts syndicated in private placements ("Sponsored
REITs").

A total of over $19.6 million between 3 of them for the years 2001, 2002, 2003
and 2004.
While Im not clear, it appears they paid these guys over 8% in commissions for
selling shares at $100,000 a pop. Those shares were converted to common, I
think.
It appears this exclusive club is now open to anyone with $17.25.

The prospectus said "On July 26, 2004, the special committees held a telephonic
meeting in which the special committees and representatives of A.G. Edwards
began reviewing potential valuations and analyses relating to the proposed
acquisition of the target REITs by FSP Corp. The special committees then
determined, after consultation with A.G. Edwards, to initially propose $16.67
as the per share value of the FSP common stock. This determination and the
special committees' negotiations with FSP Corp. and subsequent determination to
agree to a price of $17.70 were based upon a number of factors considered by
the special committeesin consultation with A.G. Edwards,"

They used $17.70 as the figure when merging with 3 other smaller companies.

I dont know how much different the REIT market is now as compared to last year
when AGE did their work.

If you have a few hours to kill...have a read and let me know what you think.
Like I said in my original post, this appears to be WAY above my level of
competence.

I tried to call investor relations but its just a voice mail. And they didnt
respond to an email from yesterday.

A "critical" view of the insider buying suggests its is very small in relation
to their stakes.

MACPHEE bought 10,500 but owns 382,806
CARTER bought 35,000 but owns 810,531
FOURNIER bought 1000 but owns 28,934

The director and CFO each took initial positions of 1000 and 5000 shares
respectively. (CFO just joined the company in 04)

On a side note, MACC might be worth looking at. They have a net asset value of
$5.81 which is UP almost a buck from last quarter yet the stock has barely
budged. Its at $2.65.

Madharry, about airlines. Yes, still have a stub position in MEH. Not happy
about missing AMR which I had followed when there were so many good buying
opportunities there. Opportunities in retrospect anyway -- at the time, who
knew?

Rather than buy airlines, my preference is still to buy the ancillary
businesses. Airport parking lots, airport management, fuel delivery services,
airplane repair, etc. I have a small package. Idea of course is that these
might have profits and not be burdened with high capital and labor costs or
poor business models like the airline companies, and that these niche companies
will benefit from passenger traffic no matter who flies the passengers.

FSPs debt press release relates to their investment banking business, not their
owned REITS.

They own 32 properties free & clear with no debt whatsoever.

The debt is for brokered deals apparently.

There is some confusion over the dividend since they paid 41 cents and then 21
cents representing a 4 month and 2 month period but the 62 cents for the 6
months is consistent with what they have been paying for the last few years.
Yahoo shows a 21 cent annual dividend which might disaude some folks from
looking closer at it.

So I expect about a 31 cent quarterly dividend going forward.

Most everyone that owns any of their 60 million shares bought in $100,000 lots
apparently.

Many have cost basis of $10 + above but they are not the kind of folks that
switch in & out of things.

The biggest risk I guess is interest rate risk. I dont particularly like the
fact that the REITs have gone up SO much over the last few years. But at the
same time, I need yield and these guys are conservative.

They dont overpay for properties and they dont leverage them.

There has been no analyst coverage or anything so that could be a future
positive.

They are not in a hurry to sell a property earning a nice yield only to put the
cash in a 2% money market so they are only going to sell a property when they
feel they can reinvest the proceeds into something better.

Wondering if I should buy RTU also. I never did anything with that.

might be lagging indicators of what's happening or could happen to the
business. And apparently, from the relatively low stock price and p/e, "what's
happening" to the business going forward is not going to be good.

I bought a very minor position in EXPE. This is NOT a value investment though:
I did not do a DD on the skimpy material available post spin-off. I bought it
mostly because I have used EXPE site and I consider it to be one of the best
organized sites on the web, incredibly good in servicing customers and
attracting their attention. I think Expedia.com and Amazon.com are two great
examples of how to set up e-commerce sites.

I may add to this position if stock craters and/or some concrete valuation
numbers become available and they are attractive.

WMT - Jim Cramer has been negative on the stock for a while. He believes their

Paul: I started WMT yesterday @45.85 without having read any of the posts on
this thread...so we independently arrived at a similar view...It's favorably
priced at this level. Both Morningstar & S&P peg fair value ~$58. Whether
yesterday's dip to match 2003 lows was triggered by the shooting in Arizona or
the jump in oil..I see neither condition as having a lasting impact. If oil
keeps jumping, nobody will be able to shop anywhere but WMT. If oil drops, as I
expect with the end of summer driving and hurricane season, given every experts
assessment that non-speculative fundamental value is well below current levels,
WMT's lower income customers will get some relief...just in time for Christmas.
Looking at a long term chart, WMT plateaued 5 years, 92-97, before jumping 4-5x
in the ensuing 3 years. It has now plateaued for nearly 7 years, so it could be
due for another jump.
Nevertheless, WMT is not a high expectation pick for me...I'm not looking for a
triple in the nest 3 years or anything like that.

WMT. Yes, I remember that plateau aspect. Also, I believe IF people organize
themselves to reduce their driving trips, WMT is the biggest
one-stop-for-everything-you-need destination (food, then everything else).
WMT's transportation costs will rise quite a bit of course, but I figure
everyone else's (competitors) will too. WMT should have a slight advantage, as
they pride themselves on their efficient supply-chain.

And I too feel the big gains in this stock occurred years ago, and we won't
likely see anywhere near those gains again. The company is just so big- any
stock gains going forward will be relatively small, I am guessing. I have to
believe though that the company will be around for another ten or more years,
and although there's a stock market risk, buying the stock is a decent bet for
me within a diversified portfolio.

A small bet for me now, but I'm willing to raise it substantially. I added more
today, and I'll add more if/as the stock continues to drop.

Also the Dec. 25 calls. The results of the Lipitor patent case make PFE a roll
of the dice. IMHO a positive ruling gives PFE a IT price target $30+ and a
negative decision a downside target of $20-21. But the odds from where I stand
are 70%-30% in favor of a position decision. IMHO PFE below 25 is a great

the restrictions have to do with the number of loans that can be made to one
person in one calendar year, the idea being that the loans should be
occasional, rather than a pseudo permanent loan, where the borrower pays back
the loan from a paycheck and then immediately borrows against the next paycheck

the news has been priced in at this point, long ago really, and the companies
have guided accordingly...there is also a possibility of legislative relief in
texas, which is the main state affected by the new regulation, though that
hasn't occurred as of yet

IMHO the companies are cash generating machines, and should be strong
performers for the long haul, though the only one i have followed closely is
EZPW, which i don't currently own, as i like to buy it on news or short seller
rumor related dips, and sell into strength

i also like DGSE, though it is more of a developing story

doesn't make much sense to short insurance at this point IMHO

stocks like HIG and SAFC (which i own) moved down initially but have already
recovered, and whatever losses they have will be made up by increased premiums
going forward, as well as by reinsurance

two others that i owned, but fortunately sold last week to lower my exposure to
the sector, are AHL and AXS, either one might be a buy on further weakness, as
they both dropped quite a bit last year after the hurricanes, which was when i
originally bought them...each one is trading a few bucks over tangible book, so
not much risk and each pays a decent dividend

one final idea, not related at all to the hurricanes, but still in the
insurance arena, is MIG...they have 6 bucks a share in book value, and trade at
5.30 or so...they should earn close to .60 this year...reminds me of UHCO which
was similarly attractive at 7 bucks two years ago, and is now at 23...not
saying MIG will be another UHCO, but it certainly appears to be worth much more
than 5 or 6 bucks

Still holding a few shares - up is good, but overall I'm in the loss column

Going forward, perhaps the stock's had a breakout now, emphasizing that the

I see companies benefitting from Katrina recovery doing well in future, so my
desire/greed button is to move funds away from these bank stocks/dead money
stocks toward the stocks of those Katrina-beneficiary companies. Of course,
everybody also see the Katrina possibilities and likelihoods, so the related
stocks have already moved up or have begun to move up.
