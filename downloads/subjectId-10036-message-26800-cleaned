I also thought it was a good idea to hire an experienced person in the US to
run their casino operations. Their casino numbers were terrible. Slot machines
had been the great hope for this company for several years. I also think a lot
hinges on the governor of Florida signing the ATM bill. Still the price is very
tempting down here, so it is on my watch list. You got in at a good price.

I've bought and sold UBET the last five years and have always looked at MECA,
but didn't like the debt burden. I also liked the CC, but it definitely is
going to be a "show me" stock as there is lots of disbelievers out there,
especially when it comes to the future of horse racing. But the agreement with
Churchill will help them while weakening TVG's bargaining position with other
tracks.

Madharry,

A couple of things. There's been some insider buying in RAS

http://xml.10kwizard.com/filing_raw.php?repo=tenk&ipage=4919652

The Chinese betting on Florida racing will never happen. Offshore betting is
already here and is a major drag on domestic companies. Once content is on the
internet, it's there to be stolen. My opinion is the MECA's best bet is to
restructure and to enhance the tracks to make them a destination location.

I wouldnt bet the farm on it, definitely not in my top 10 list, but I hope at
these levels patience will be rewarded. there were certainly lots of questions
at the conference call. I will probably check the website tomorrow to see if
the annual meeting is taped too. The new mgmt guy I think has correctly
identified the problems facing the company and I think the deal with churchill
downs makes a lot of sense. I thought it was a very savvy comment that they are
taking a hard look at their food and beverage operations with the idea that
having a name franchise in there would fill up more up of their tables. Clearly
the company will have to show investors that they are serious about turning
things around by selling assets paying off debt and increasing margins. But Its
not like they have enormous competition. They just have to execute.

I got tired of looking at my screen today and decided do some digging into the
numbers for KTC vs. SKM.

Looking at the numbers for SKM based on 2006 revenues and earnings, I came up
with a PSR of 1.75 and a P/B of 2X.
A P/Tangible book is a little less generous at over 3X, based on the tangible
book per ADR of $7.93 and stated book of 12.50. A PE of 12.8, again all based
on annual 2006 results. For some reason, based on the ADR ratio of 1/9, it
appears the US ADRâ€™s trade at a premium to their Korean Won counterpart that is
about 8% ($27.08 US price vs. Korean price conversion of $24.90 per ADR.

On KTC I came up with a PSR of just under 1 (11,780,900,000,000 KW rev in 2006
and market value of 11,758,315,350,000 KW).
A P/B of 1.37 and a P/tangible book of 1.45. The PE of 9.4, again all based on
annual 2006 results.

Somehow after going thru the numbers and looking at Q1 2007 for both Companies,
my tendency is KTC looks like the better value with better prospects for
earnings and revenue growth. May retest lows on this dip at which time I'll
decide on potential add to.

LM - their quarterly earnings were Ok but not great. Inflows into bond and MM
funds compensated for outflows from equity funds. the problem was that
expectations were for something better, as is clearly visible from the chart
prior to earnings.

I agree that LM is cheap based on EV/ assets under management and buyers at
this level will be rewarded some time. Short term however I think the market is
overextended and there is a high likelihood that we see more pressure and this
traditionally means weak share performance for asset managers like LM.

IBKR's IPO is a bust too. Apparently the valuation appears a bit rich now after
the IPO hype. i think i'll add to my small position acquired at the IPO if we
see prices better than 27$.

Hi Paul - I was doing more research on VCP (Votorantim Celulose e Papel S.A.)
and was surprised to find out that they are a major shareholder in ARA (Aracruz
Celulose S.A. ).
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aracruz

From the article"...Four major shareholders control the company's voting
shares: the Safra Group, Lorentzen and Votorantim (each owning 28 per cent of
the voting shares) and BNDES, the Brazilian National Economic and Social
Development Bank (12.5 per cent)..." .

Based on the PE and book value of both companies, it appears to me that VCP is
undervalued given ARA's current market price. I am not sure why the market have
them priced this way, but I now hold equal amounts of each based on my total
dollars invested.

My direct investments in companies that are headquarted in Brazil include RIO
(Companhia Vale do Rio Doce), VCP (Votorantim Celulose e Papel S.A.) and ARA
(Aracruz Celulose S.A.) and as a group they represent less than 2% of my
taxable portfolio.

I do hold positions in other conglomerates that have operations and interests
in Brazil, specifically BHP (BHP Billiton Ltd.), but their investment is small
compared to their total market cap.

Good find on VCP and bringing it to my attention.

Madharry,

Yes, I guess all those jokes about Canada being the 51st state really irks
Canadian regulators. Seriously, I think they would much prefer to see US
investors not invest in Canada. US investors often can't participate in special
corporate actions (rights offerings, dividend reinvest, etc) and sometimes are
restricted from having too large a % ownership of a security. Regulators
probably are interested in protecting US shareholders who they don't want
anyway.

Follow the Money
How Chipotle's Founder Made His Millions
By Brett Arends
Mutual Funds Columnist
5/16/2007 10:26 AM EDT
URL: http://www.thestreet.com/funds/followmoney/10357023.html

Fourteen years ago, a 28-year-old chef borrowed money from his dad to open a
taqueria in Denver.

Today, that taqueria is Chipotle, the hottest restaurant chain in the U.S., and
that chef, founder Steve Ells, is doing very well indeed.

How well?

Take a look at the public filings.

Steve Ells has seen his personal fortune soar to nearly $100 million since
Chipotle Mexcan Grill (CMG) came to the stock market just 16 months ago.

That works out at about $1.4 million a week since the company filed to go
public.

Not bad. You want guacamole with that?

Ells trained at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and began
his career working at Stars restaurant in San Francisco.

The success shouldn't surprise anyone who has walked past America's hottest
restaurant chain. Whenever you go, there's a line stretching to the door.

Chipotle's stock, which went public at $22 in January 2006, doubled on its
first day on the market, and it has been all hot sauce since. It just hit a
record $83.42 before easing to $81.91. It has jumped $16 in the last couple of
weeks alone as the company's latest figures shot out the lights again.

Today it employs 16,000 people, most of them full time, in more than 600
restaurants around the country.

When it comes to Chipotle, there are two kinds of analysts on Wall Street.
There are those who are surprised that the company keeps beating expectations.
And then there are those who have actually eaten at one of the restaurants.

Unavoidable corporate cheerleading: Jim Cramer has been pounding the tortilla
about this stock for a long time.

McDonald's (MCD) took a controlling stake in the company back in 1998 and spun
it off last year. It handed out most of the shares to its investors.

As of the last proxy, Ells owned 845,050 so-called B-shares, which have extra
votes but otherwise count as regular stock. Value at current market prices:
about $69 million.

He's holding options on over another 300,000 shares, with exercise prices
ranging from $14.79 to $63.89. Value: Another $14.8 million. This stock is
rising so fast that he has made $1.4 million just on the options he was given
three months ago.

Then you've got to count 55,000 shares of restricted stock, worth $4.5 million,
plus the $5.7 million in shares he has already sold.

Total: $94 million.

"It's definitely been a good run since our IPO a year and a half ago," said
spokesman Chris Arnold. "Ultimately, in the restaurant business it's good food
that wins, and Chipotle has been on a quest to source better and better
ingredients."

Chipotle boasts a policy of "food with integrity" and emphasizes quality,
all-natural ingredients. Ells pioneered using only free-range pork and other
organic ingredients. That is, say aficionados, the reason why Chipotle burritos
taste so good.

It's good to know that, for all the hedge-fund tycoons and corporate bandits
out there, the system can still work. You can still make a fortune in America
by building a better mousetrap ... or, in Ells' case, a better burrito.

Obrigado, EKS. I didn't know the connection between the two Brazilian
companies.

In searching now, I can't find confirmation of my recollection that either VCP
or more likely ARA was looking into a joint venture with a
construction/processing/engineering firm to build a plant to convert
ARA's/VCP's(?) trees into energy (instead of paper). That might create more
investor interest in these companies, if such conversion were profitably
feasible.

because I read somewhere that the reasons the umbrella group of security

US securities because of inferior regulations so it was that that if they would
strengthen their regulations to protect investors the discount would lessen.
I think some government officials might be surprised to hear that if the really

FSP finally hit my longstanding limit order for more shares.

$17.70 which was $18.01 but got adjusted down for the 31 cent dividend.

The light insider buying continues.

My concern is the street wont ever get on this one enough to make up for the
constant selling from their syndication deals.

Those folks get FSP stock...and then sell it to cash out and invest in the next
syndication and that means an abundance of selling pressure on the stock.

Plus, the street likes to see nice growing FFO and FSPs no debt model doesnt
cater to that. It is less risky than other REITs but I guess less rewarding
too. Still, almost a 7% dividend yield is nothing to sneeze at.

I'm in to track it for a while. Past few years company has been very profitable
(if its numbers are to be believed), and is of decent size (1600 employees,
rev. of over $1B USA).

The company pays a dividend, but the history of it isn't that long from what I
see, and the dividend policy has recently changed. It looks like the quarterly
dividend of .375 (USA$) is going to be maintained, giving an unusually good
dividend yield -- 6% -- for a tech business. The company has no ltd.

Thanks for the added info. I hadn't checked, although I had noticed in
searching SI for "BVF" somebody did mention on the Greenblatt thread they had
bought it last year.

Stock has moved up from maybe around 15 to 24 Since October, and by my
calculations the price rise now means it is not a buy based on high roe to low
p/e metric (similar somewhat to Mr. Greenblatt's high roic to high earnings
yield metric). So I'm not surprised it's fallen from the Greenblatt list. It is
a small buy - for me anyway - on other ways I might evaluate the thing. I want
to add though, it isn't a comfortable decision-- stock could be very dangerous
and/or risky at current level. (I'm hoping the good div yield offers a margin
of safety.)

Hi Madharry - Yes SIL has had a great run especially that it has almost come
round trip from it's high of $25.70 on April 10, 2006 and you were able to buy
in near the low! The key to a great investment is to have an exit plan and
diversify into several companies that continue to grow earnings over the long
run.

Check out the performance of the conglomerate mining and resource stocks over
five years compared to SIL. Some of these large companies include RIO
(Companhia Vale do Rio Doce), BHP (BHP Billiton Ltd.) and AAUK (ANGLO AM PLC
ADR).
http://finance.yahoo.com/charts#chart4:symbol=sil;range=5y;compare=aauk+bhp+rio
indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;logscale=on;source=undefined

You might consider when you hit your long term holding period, to peel off a
few shares and move some of those profits into a large diversified conglomerate
resource and mining company. This way you pay a maximum 15% long term capital
gains tax, diversify into a company that has exposure to several valuable
metals and pay you an annual dividend while you hold.

You definitely have hit a home run on part one. I have always found that the
hard part is to find undervalued companies that can keep compounding their
earnings and grow over several years.

I am always looking for those undervalued gems that will grow earnings for
years. Also, no matter how much I like the company, I limit my total investment
to less that 9% of my portfolio. Most of my individual company positions total
only 3% of my investment portfolio value and when they run higher to over
7%-8%, I peel off shares and rebalance the portfolio..

Good work on your SIL pick.

I'll join you in buying TRGL.

I don't know if it has bottomed and I'd like to see more volume on today's pop,
but there sure was a lot of sellers the last few weeks. Estimates have been
falling, but let's say they do $1.30 next year, or 19% less than the average of
$1.61 expected by 2 analysts. Let's say further that they grow at only 12% vs.
the 347% shown by Yahoo. The result IMO is a compelling value:

Company: TRGL
Date: 5/21/2007
Next year's expected earnings: $1.30
EPS growth rate used for estimate: 12%
Multiple Graham used for estimate: 8.5
Graham Fair Value: $29.74
Current Price: $14.33
$ difference: $15.41 
Percent Growth to Fair Value: 107.56%

Edit - News snip today from Istanbul publication:

Ak&#231;akoca gas will meet one-tenth of consumption

The natural gas extracted in Ak&#231;akoca will meet one-tenth of the gas
consumed in Turkey, Energy Minister Hilmi G&#252;ler has said. 

Speaking at a ceremony marking the integration of the gas to the domestic
distribution network yesterday, G&#252;ler said they had conducted long-term
research before beginning to drill. He also said he had monitored Norway's
search for gas, which found deposits on the 33rd drill, but said Turkish
engineers had found gas on their first drill. "I hope we will become a country
that extracts, refines and consumes its own oil and gas," he said.

G&#252;ler said 2 million cubic meters of natural gas would be produced in
Ak&#231;akoca, adding that the amount was equal to the total consumption of
Samsun, Sivas, Erzurum, Malatya, Kayseri, &#199;orum, Konya, D&#252;zce and
Aksaray put together. He said a new natural gas depot with a capacity to store
1.6 billion cubic meters would also be built in Silivri.

G&#252;ler said with Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, the Shahdeniz and Blue
Stream natural gas pipeline, Turkey had become a hub and that with these new
projects they also wanted to be an oil and gas-producing country.

The gas well was drilled by a joint initiative between the state-owned Turkish
Petroleum Corporation (TPAO), US-based Toreador and Stratic Enerji, according
to the Anatolia news agency. The gas reserves in Ak&#231;akoca are larger than
the combined TPAO gas reserves in the Thrace region. The search for gas was
launched in 2004 and two platforms, Prometeu and Saturn, drilled 13 wells
varying in depth from 640 meters to 980 meters. Nine were prepared for
production, three were closed because of poor yields and one was dry. Two
million cubic meters gas of is expected to be extracted per day from the nine
wells.

Hi -with a K - I am in TRGL (Toreador Resources Corp) for a starter position.
Does their recent filing for a $49.2 million shelf offering effect your
projections? If they sell the lot at $15.00/share then the new shelf offering
would add 15% more shares to their total outstanding shares count of 19.37
million.

I do think the recent selling was overdone especially if management stated that
they plan to double their production in years 2008, 2009 and 2010. If they
achieve this production goal, the company should be a good long term hold for a
few years.

I like their current production and operations located in France.
http://www.toreador.net/global_activity_france.html

The steady cash flow from these operations and their new shelf offering (49.2
million) should provide them the necessary resources to get their other wells
into production.

From their annual report:"...Toreador owns and operates five oil fields in
France. Their Paris Basin assets accounted for nearly 75% of Toreadorâ€™s
reserves and production in 2005....

Here is a link to their 2005 annual report.

PWE. You may be right on selling some. But the yield is still 10%, and with oil

Quite a day - and click on 3 month also. These are the largest of the canadian
trusts (excl PGH).

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=AAV&t=1d&l=off&z=m&q=l&c=cne,hte,pwe,pwi

and if you click on 1 year, you can see that some are getting close to
recovering from the tax news last halloween. I don't know if that means that
they have recovered enough or too much.

And the yield on the other trusts is higher than PWE's. Some are 12% to 13%.
(But then subtract 15% for foreign tax - so net of over 11%.)

RE TRGL - It looks like the private placement already took place at the end of
March.

From the article:"...Toreador, a Dallas-based oil exploration and development
company, said it issued about 2.7 million shares to the investors. It also
granted the investors options to buy an additional $8.1 million in stock within
the next 30 days...."

Toreador sells $45M of stock
Monday March 26, 12:05 pm ET
http://biz.yahoo.com/bizj/070326/1437532.html?.v=1

The analyst Subash Chandra at Jefferies & Co. downgraded the company to "Hold"
from "Buy," saying the deal indicates Toreador believes itself to be worth much
less than expected.

I do not arrive at the same conclusion as the analyst at Jefferies & Co. but
rather management probably felt that the extra liquidity would provide a safety
cushion for them to get their other wells into production. According to TRGL's
annual report, management is very bullish on their oil & gas production for
several years to come.

maintained (IF), then stock ought/should/could/might be a buy in this market
(of low interest rates) until p/e of 50 or more. Which would mean on consensus
analyst '07 estimates of $15.12 per share, there's value to about $750 per
share (vs. share price now of about $470/sh). Ha. Very possible ---
disregarding my ifs/coulds/mights/ assumptions -- I maybe should be looking

RIG. It's possible, I have read, that it isn't going to be about the supply of

people who manage and operate these things are in high demand/short supply and
apparently have skill sets and experience that are important and necessary and
which are not easily learned or gained. RIG having these crews, may have an
advantage over smaller companies/new entrants to the business.

I'm fairly assured that through a combination of being in an attractive sector
(good backlogs), increasing earnings, and increasing low p/e, RIG now at about
$97, will see $125 or better next year. (Although...in actuality, my record of
success with "fairly assured" isn't that great. Sigh)

If it were me in your situation, Madharry, I would not have the emotional
strength or commitment to this stock whereby I could overlook and overcome my

"Anyway this discussion would be probable be better on a drilling thread."

That's possible. I considered that before I posted here. On the Big Dog thread
(drillers, etc.), I sense that there are people either mostly not in RIG or are
trading RIG, or are getting out of RIG. There's no real discussion of the
merits for/again. RIG.

I see two ways of looking at this: On the one hand, if there are no or few RIG
"investors" on that thread, or the knowledgeable person or persons are selling,
it could be a time for the less knowledgeable (me) to be following wiser heads
and getting out too.

I take the contrary view. With so many people on that thread, with no real
enthusiasm for the stock, but with the stock showing great profits and great
future ('great' imo. I could be wrong), the experienced hands on the thread imo
and without actually asking anyone there, are concluding there are better buys,
or the stock is at highs and that the business is cyclical...and has been
quickly/viciously cyclical... so now's no time for them to be making long-term
(short-term?) commitments to RIG. I take all that as a positive for the
stock---the stock has room to grow--- and in my contrary opinion, while adding
now might be late to the party, the music is still playing and there is no
reason to be going home. So for me, I'm buying not selling.

Of course, all jmo. And I have been wrong...many, many times.

Re RIG, I was invested in both RIG and DO for a long time and made good money.
I gradually got out of RIG (and reallocated 100% to DO) based on what I
considered a lack of transparency, and periodic operational failures, on the
part of RIG's management. I still own a good sized chunk of DO, though I pared
back in early '06.

I'm no expert (and this is where the drilling thread might be helpful) but my
impression is that DO is the better managed company. The two stocks also track
each other very closely, with DO being a slight outperformer over the long run,
though RIG has outperformed in the past year. For those interested in entering
this sector now, that might be a good argument for hedging bets and investing
in both.

50,000*7*365*.3675(TRGL holds 36.75% interests)= 46.95M/year cashflow! Divided
by fully diluted share count, 16.08M, it is about $2.92/share cashflow! At
today's close, TRGL is trading at 5x Turkey cashflow. NOT including it France
oil field which is generating about 25M/year. NOT including other oil fields in
Romania, Turkey and Hungary. The Turkey ones are on the same formation of Iraq
fields! Going forward, TRGL will have the cashflow to drill them out without
any further dilution! No wonder insiders are buying like crazy!

I'm not worried about the recent shelf offering.

TRGL. I'm just a crowd-follower here.

Sorry to admit ignorance, but I've no real understanding of how to put the cash
flow numbers into context of significance. I've no idea whether the cash flow
number is higher or lower than peers at current stage of production or
development, or what TRGL's debt structure requirements are/will be for that
cash, or anything else that would make me jump off my chair to table pound that
the cash flow number screams buy buy buy. I understand that these companies can
be, maybe should be, maybe are evaluated and bought by cash flow numbers
(sometimes); I've just no feel for TRGL's numbers.

I do like the relatively large insider buys though -g-.

Very nice on BDHHY. I followed it a while, but was pretty top heavy in steel,
and lost track of it. Your GNA is very promising along with my GGB.

Babbling today not enough sleep last couple of days but surprising to me that
although most uranium is up including sxr up around 2%, edv is down a little on
very low volume 30,000 while a uranium play like khan resources is trading
2,000,0000 shares. edv is about 20% uranium exposure as far as we know.
Bought some mpel cause wynn up around 7% today. perhaps mpel price has
stabilized now.
