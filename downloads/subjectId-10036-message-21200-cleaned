PLT: Too expensive for me still. I've looked at it several times over the past
years, and it's mostly been too expensive for me. When it wasn't, the market
was also down and there were better values that I could find.

To me, rightly or wrongly Plantronics means headsets - expensive ones - and I'm
always wondering about the growth prospects and p/e values for that market.
That has dissuaded me from buying.
Perhaps this is just my problem, because the company is innovative, and the
market has rewarded it with higher valuations before and may well again.

Suma, NPTH: It's hard for me to say a stock doesn't have potential -g-. If it
is a stock to be bought because of its potential, then the question I have is -
for how long should a new buyer be willing to wait for the potential to be
realized?

Stock has traded much higher at least a couple of times over the past years.
Financial picture doesn't lure me.

I haven't a clue what the company does or is saying. This press release is so
full of jargon it's jabberwocky to me:

"Enpath Medical, Inc. (Nasdaq: NPTH - News) announced today that the first
human use of its new FasTac&#174; Flex epicardial lead implant tool occurred on
Monday April 25, 2005. This unique deflectable implant tool was used to place
two MyoPore&#174; sutureless bipolar epicardial leads, also manufactured by
Enpath, on the left ventricle of a patient in completing the left ventricular
lead segment of her cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) system."

These dink medical companies - I shake my head. For me, I need someone to hold
my hand for me to buy. I never can figure out how big or small the market for
their product(s) is (are). Still... the company's small size means some good
news can really propel the stock (again). Could be a good small speculative buy
at today's multi-year low price.

What is your reasoning with NPTH?

Npth was a stock a broker bought for me. It promptly went down from the high he
purchased it at so he sold. Big Loss.

However, the purchased he explained to me was predicated on the device that is

lot higher..(what stock hasn't...sic) and I wondered whether this newly

latest). And sometimes of course, there's big fish to be had (selling GI now

SXT: With the stock under $20, I added a few more shares to my position.

Not much of happening with the stock over the past few years:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=SXT&t=5y

Company seems to be a slow grower. Book value is increasing, price-to-sales,
and price-to-book are relatively (compared to past years) low, and the
company's profitable.

It manufactures and markets "colors, flavors and fragrances". I assume the
customer base is diverse, and that SXT can maintain its business in either a
defationary or inflationary environment. I presume SXT's chemicals are vital,
but only a small part of its customers' cost of goods sold.

Given the 3% dividend yield, I'll continue to stay with the company to see if
the business can inch its way up, and if the market might revalue the stock
higher.

I agree that WMT is becoming very interesting. One item that concerns me is the

Blankmind,

When you look at your strategy of buying these banks, how much are you
factoring in the shape and value of the yield curve for valuing these
companies?

Isn't it that lots of banks are becoming cheap because of concerns of higher
short-term rates cutting into margins. Interest rate profit spreads could
tighten, and carry trades become unattractive. If the return on book value
decreases, maybe these stocks should trade at lower Price-to-book multiples.

When you say you are holding because of continued great results, do you mean
for your strategy or for CSBK?

That being said, I'd be happy being financial assets trading below book value
if they can earn a decent return. What kind of eps do you think they can
generate in the next year or two?

re: automotive market. Nothing at current price stands out as a clear buy to
me.

Maybe Pep Boys? Stock's come down, but it's also been much lower too. And
cheaper on a p/sales basis.

I've added to my small Toyota (TM) position under $74, and may continue to do
so, if stock falls.

I have losing positions in DRRA and SUP. I'm not adding at this time.

In general I prefer the auto retailers over the auto manufacturers. Although
I've trimmed my positions in all the stocks that I've been holding in this
subsector, I may add back to ABG if the stock drops below $14 again. ABG seems
to stress luxury and mid-line import brands, and these seem to be more popular,
hence profitable. (Or so I am led to believe from the annual report.)

I like auto insurers, and I'm holding positions in several. I see that DRCT on
today's new lows list is a writer of "non-standard" policies. I'll consider the
stock. I like non-standard because often-times the policy pricing is not so
fixed by the regulators as with standard policies. Car purchases can be
postponed; not auto insurance (if one complies with insurance requirements).

Not a value play, but maybe GM is worth a speculative short. Very dangerous to
bet against Mr. Kerkorian, but troubles at GM - health and pension - seem
intractable. Product seems to me to be very weak also. OTOH, if Kerkorian gains
control (that's not likely at this point, imo) and he installs somebody with
the skills/charisma like he did at Chrysler - perhaps like luring away Ghosen
from Renault/Nissan - the stock could gain ten points in a day.

so analysts put down .88 and it turned out 1.11 (1.67 with a prop sale)--
guidance for rest of year left the same and was questioned by

I like SU as well. I'll add if price breaks to a new high.

With stocks in other sectors I'm much less willing to average up - I'm one who
will try to average-down. I figure differently for oil stocks. I'm figuring
that if there is an oil shortage or a peaking of oil production, and if
respected big cap oil managers or presumed media pundits begin to increase
their collective voice about this, people (including me) will become more
accepting of this as a received wisdom, and there will be much more upward
pressure on oil/gas/related stocks - caused not only by good earnings (which
everyone is already aware of), but also by more people deciding they had better
have themselves decent positions in the oil/gas sectors. I can envision this
(the perceived wisdom sinking into our collective mindsets)to happen gradually
if it (the oil problem) does exist. I believe rising stock prices in the
oil/gas/related sectors will be a confirming sign that the oil/gas problem does
exist in people's minds - if not in fact, and I also believe I will still then
have buying opportunities even if I have to increase my positions at prices
higher than today.

In other words, I'm reluctant to add more now; I'm waiting.
I will mention that I'm very overweighted already in the various sectors with
diverse selections. (I hold more than thirty different positions in the
oil/gas/related sectors.) A majority of my buys were last year and early this
year.

great results this past qtr - in fact - i can't think of one bank that hasn't -
there may be one - i just can't think of one - so yes - i'm saying i see
continued great results going forward - even w/ rising rates - in fact - if you
look at the rates they pay vs. collect on loans - they haven't changed that
much - neither have losses changed much - but if i'm missing the boat here -

in full disclosure - here's my earlier post from 3/27/05 - the 2 mortgage reits
have gone up - especially when you add the dividends rec'd - & the 4 banks have
gone down further - i'm still holding all 6 positions:

Here's 6 undervalued financial stocks that make BAC (Bk of Amer) look
expensive:

- 2 mortgage reits - the analysts are saying they're going to tank due to the
Fed hikes - but the companies themselves are saying they're going to continue
turning out profits & dividends - these are risky - but i think worth it - here
goes:

#1 - (IMH) Impac Mortgage - - they're behind on their Sarbanes & 10-K filings -
but they're saying they're going to file unaudited 10K - won't effect their
dividen payments - etc... I believe them. They pay $3 annual dividend - stock @
$16.42 - range: $16 - $27.91

#2 - NEW - New Century Financial Corp - $32.90 book value - dividends expected
to rise from the current $6.20/share level - $9 eps projected in '05 - goal is
to eventually distribute 100% of the reit’s taxable income - earned $8.29 in
’04 vs. $6.32 in ‘03 - confident they can increase dividends in future periods
- at $44.456/share - i think the selling is way overdone

- & 4 recently deumutualized thrifts in & around NJ:

&#183; #1 - CSBK - Clfiton Savings Bank - closed at $11.18 - net inc for latest
quarter was $.10 diluted; about $.40/eps annualized - but earnings keep growing
as ipo proceeds deployed - sitting on several branch offices acquired decades
ago & now worth $millions more than reflected on balance sheet - Equity $202.9
mill/14 mill shs = $14.49 book value - but real book value much higher - pays a
$.20/annual dividend or almost 2% - just announced a 5% share buyback

&#183; #2 - KRNY - Kearny Bank - closed at $11.13 - book value is $23.16 - just
de-mutualized so real earnings and dividends not exactly clear but both should
be good when they do come out

&#183; #3 - ABBC - Abbington Community Bank - closed at $13.08 - on track to do
about $.79/eps for year but should be higher as ipo proceeds deployed - $17.34
in book value - actually - this bank is in Bucks County, PA - which borders NJ

&#183; #4 - OSHC - Ocean Shore Bank - closed at $10.81 - also too new to
determine earnings - but book value is $15.97

Blankmind,

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but appears to me that CSBK has about 30 million
shares outstanding, not 14 million (from the 10-Q for quarter ending 12/31/04 -
or from 3/31/05 quarter profit of $1.5 million divided by 30 million shares
equals the 5 cents reported). Can you doublecheck your source for shares
outstanding? Would significantly alter the value proposition.

my questions to blankmind are:
why did he call Clifton MHC a "parent"? Who owns the stock of Clifton MHC and
how do we verify that CSBK is the intended beneficiary? How do we know that
Clifton MHC's shares are in some way special and do not receive dividends?

From:- with a K
Spek, I am perplexed by the action of PDGE's stock. While the company seems to
be executing quite well, something continues to put downward pressure on the
stock price. Maybe it's Barron Partners continual selling or maybe it is
something else... Fear of asbestos liability?

I wrote up my thoughts on Dale's 50% thread near the peak price in February, I
recall, similar to my post on AUO near it's peak. Both calls stick in my craw.
Sometimes I feel like a contrarian indicator and I tell myself I should just do
the opposite of what I think I should do!

If I plug in your .20 in expected earnings the valuation looks compelling:

Blankmind,

The CSBK results look ok, not great, from an uninformed investor point of view,
and that may be the main type of investor looking at these stocks right now.
For example, a friend pointed out that Keeley Small Cap Value Fund lowered its
small bank exposure recently in December from 10% to 3%, so it doesn't seem
like institutions are loading up at this point.

I'd say that PE's of 50 or even maybe 25(?) if you adjust for shares actually
out in the mkt don't look attractive to the typical value investor. One problem
from a short-term price perspective is that if you are right and everyone else
is wrong, then you are wrong.

Also, the impact of higher rates tends to lag, so I don't think you will have
started seeing much of the pain yet (should there be any). I don't know enough
to determine how important this factor is, but it could cause prices to deviate
significantly from how they have behaved in the past few years.

In addition, below book value is great, but what about the relative value
question. I see a lot of new thrift ipos beat up badly (i.e., trading below ipo
prices) in addition to some other ones on the thread that look cheap --- are
your choices the cheapest ones? They may do well, but I'd rather buy the
cheapest ones unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise.

I'm trying to be constructively critical here. I do appreciate your posts on
these opportunites and am considering buying some.

Thanks!

I received a promotion email with his Feb 2005 newsletter, he said his proven
system is now issuing an early crash warning signal again - for only the 3rd
time in over 100 years. His newsletter said he correctly predicted the 1987
crash, also went to bonds in Oct 1999 and avoided the big stock market crash in
2000-2002 while gained 70% in bonds in 5 years.

Anyone has comment on his creditability? Did he finally issue the crash signal
in last three months since Feb 2005 newsletter? I thought I read his bearish
comments through out 2003-2004 and the crash still did not happen. Maybe this
time he is sticking his neck out to give the final crash signal?

I don't know Jim Sheperd, but most market prognosticators are not reliable in
my opinion, especially if they think they can reliably predict crashes. Through
random chance there will always be prognosticators who have made some good
calls in the past (if there are thousands of people trying to predict the
market, odds are that a few of them will get it right, but that doesn't mean
they will get it right in the future).

If you really believe in this guy and his reasoning make sense, you might
lighten up you positions a bit. I just take all these forecasts with a grain of
salt. Just my opinion.

If you could, the question you want to ask all these guys who say they
predicted the '87 crash or advised you to get out of the market before the '87
crash and who use this '87 prediction in promoting their record is this:

"Okay, when after the '87 crash did you say to get back in?"

Because naysayers there were then and now many, but far,far fewer - if any -
who said the week after the crash, "buy, buy, buy."
And that REALLY was THE time to buy.

Just be careful who you insult. It may come back to haunt you someday. The
"doom and gloom crowd" was ultimately right in 2000: The Nasdaq fell almost 80%
from its 2000 high by October 2002. Whether or not "the doom and gloom crowd"
profited from the decline is an entirely different story. Some may have covered
too soon. Others may have gone bankrupt before the decline. Unless you are
dealing with a money manager, you'll never really know who profited from that
decline.

One thing is for sure:

Money managers need to gloat about their performance in order to attract more
$$$$. The astute individual investor/trader can afford to remain silent.

Moreover, when an individual shows continuous independent financial insight, he
places his existence in a realm where no one (outside his family) can touch him
nor hurt him. He is a law unto himself. He is a success, a great event,
regardless of whether a Bull or Bear Market is in sway.

I hope I'm wrong. But I think the market environment moving forward will prove
to be a disaster for over 90% of money managers, who will become blindsided by
the Bear.

It sounds like you ascribe no financial value to the bank's membership - and

From:Carl Worth
these MHC companies are hard to understand, but blankmind is right about the
net effect of the second step conversion, if it takes place...i think his
figures on book value are off a bit, but there is no doubt that the book value
is higher than stated by yahoo, as long as the second step eventually takes
place

i had to read through the information on various banks which have completed
both steps of the process to understand and verify what blankmind was saying,
and even then it took me a while to digest it all

i'm not even sure these banks are that great of an investment, in comparison to
other things you can buy that may pay off sooner, but the inherent book value
is unquestionable, once you understand the dynamics of the MHC structure

perhaps blankmind will post the example of the company which did this type of
second step conversion recently, he mentioned it a while back on the thread,
and it was the one whose filings i read through in order to understand the
process...i then found several others which were similar, and in every case,
when the second step conversion was announced, the stock price went up
substantially, between 50 and 100% in every case from what i remember

the reason for all of this, as blankmind has posted several times, is that the
MHC shares are sold as a secondary in the second step of the process, and the
proceeds from that secondary go to the company...because the secondary also
involves issuing all new shares, and existing shareholders get enough of those
shares so that their percentage of ownership of the converted entity remains
constant, they continue to own the same percentage of an entity which is now
worth a lot more money, because it has received the proceeds of the secondary

essentially, in step 1, X number of shares are issued to the MHC and Y number
of shares are sold to the public (some also go to a charitable foundation and
some to the ESOP, but these are immaterial amounts)...now fast forward to a
time when the stock is trading at price A, any particular shareholder owns H
number of shares (their part of Y), and the company decides to do the second
step...in step 2, the same number of shares as X are sold to the public but in
Z form, usually at 10 bucks, so the company receives 10X dollars for these new
shares...at the same time, a holder of the Y shares receive (A/10)*H shares of
the new Z shares...the MHC shares now do not exist, nor do the Y shares, and
there are now X + (Y*A/10) shares of Z outstanding, the new and only shares at
that point...the MHC no longer exists at this point, it isn't bought out, it
just ceases to exist...the new company now has more shares outstanding than it
did prior to step 2, but it has 10*X more dollars in its coffers, so the
process improves the book value of each resultant Z share substantially...of
course, it also gives the company greater earnings power, once it is able to
deploy the additional capital

as such, whenever you look at one of these companies, rather than figuring it
based on the MHC shares not existing or "counting," figure it as the company
having 10*X more dollars in total book value, and then divide by the total
outstanding shares, including the MHC shares...as such, in the example of CSBK,
as of 12/31/04, the stated book value was 202M...add 168M for the MHC shares,
and divide by 30.5M shares outstanding, and you get a book value of about 12
bucks

again, the easiest way (though it is still very complex) to understand this is
to go through the filings of a company which has completed the full process...i
certainly wouldn't blame you if you decided the whole thing wasn't worth it,
and avoided these stocks altogether <g>

Value Investing Guidlines

What do value investors look for in a potential investment? Here are some
guidelines gathered from a variety of value investors. Investors should settle
on a formula that works for them, but it will probably include as a minimum
these elements:

A Price Earnings Ratio (P/E) in the bottom 10 percent of its sector.

A PEG of less than one. (The link will take you to an article that explains how
to calculate PEG.) A PEG of less than one may indicate the stock is
undervalued.

A Debt to Equity Ratio of less than one.

Strong earnings growth over an extended period. A realistic number might be in
the 6% - 8% range over 7 to 10 years.

A Price to Book ratio of one or less.

Don’t pay more that 60% to 70% of the stock’s intrinsic per share price (see
below for more on intrinsic price).
A big challenge for the value investor, and all investors for that matter, is
reconciling market value and book value.

Intrinsic Value
Current accounting standards are adequate for measuring buildings and equipment
(book value), but as our economy has moved to a more technology/knowledge-base,
many of these intellectual assets never show up on financial statements.

Value investors acknowledge that their target investment company is much more
valuable as an ongoing business (expected cash flows, etc.) than its assets
(market value). In many cases, it is the intangibles – patents, trademarks,
research and development, brand, and so on – that drives the expectations of
future growth, not hard assets.

How do you calculate the value of intangible assets? An article from
Investopedia.com offers a step-by-step process to come up with a number.

Coming up with the intrinsic value of a stock is a complicated process and
there are a number of ways to get to the number.

Finding Intrinsic Value
Fortunately, there are several places you can go on the Web to find the number.
MorningStar.com calculates the number, which it calls “fair value,” on its
site, however you need to be a member. Take the two-week free trial to see if
you like their service. Another good source is Reuters, which also requires a
registration, but it is free.
However you arrive at the intrinsic or fair value, give yourself a margin of
error with the thought that if the calculation is wrong you might over pay. If
you use one of the services mentioned above or another source to find the
intrinsic value, determine if they have already factored in a margin of error.

For example, if you believe the intrinsic value is $40 per share, give yourself
a margin of safety and lower the target to $36 per share.

Conclusion
Many people have made fortunes using a value-based approach to investing. This
overview suggests a philosophy that works over time if you buy carefully and
hold for the long term.

In US$, that's US$20 to a present stock price of US$51. (oh yeah, and that's

Recent activity.

I started a position in Planetout at under $7. This is a $125 million company
that has recently started being profitable. They claim unmatched reach to the
gay/lesbian etc. population both in the US and abroad (interestingly, paid
subscribers are only 4% of overall users). They also claim that they have
unusually sticky websites based on how much time users spend there. They still
have a lot of cash from their IPO. The 180 day period expired in April so
insiders are now able to sell. EV/Sales is a little over 3. I put no faith in
the earnings estimates for Planetout, but I will be quite happy if they make
the 61c in 2006. Part of my investment thesis is their is some GLBT stigma here
that could benefit those that prefer to weigh their earnings in the long run.

I started a position in Corillion Software at $3.10. This is a web banking
software company with a product called "Voyager" that has JP Morgan, Bank One,
Wachovia, Commerce Bancorp as customers. EV/Sales is 1.6 as they have a lot of
cash. They are in the process of acquiring another web banking software company
for mostly stock and 4.5m cash. Their earnings unfortunately are very skewed to
license sales. Yahoo shows earnings estimates of .20 and .25 for 2005 and 2006
respectively.

I started a position in QC Holdings at $13.40. This is a paycheck lender. The
pawnshops and paycheck lenders have been hurt with newly announced federal
regulations on paycheck lending. The new regs have an immaterial effect on QC
Holdings because for the most part they don't do business in the states where
the regulations have effect. ROA is almost 21% and ROE is almost 26% and the
company is trading at under 11x 2006 earnings of $1.28.

I passed on Clifton (CSBK). I'm guessing the MHC structure is not uncommon for
thrifts and the market sees through it. There's room for ROE improvement here
<g> and it should do okay, but the appeal is not very strong for me.

I sold BP and Chevron and bought more Conoco Philipps. The reserve replacement
ratios were pretty scary on the majors and COP is considerably cheaper on a PE
basis. I missed Suncor in the high US$20s (and the oil sands buys) and now I'm
waiting for an opportunity. I still hold Burlington, Pioneer Natural, Devon,
and XTO.

Added to Reebok in the low $40s - it's around 11x 2006 earnings and they've
grown earnings 19% a year over the last five years. I don't get the valuation.

Added to Principal Financial in the high $30s - they've grown assets under
management 16% a year over the last four in a difficult environment and are
trading at 1.6x book with a current year PE of about 15.

Added to Fidelity Financial and First American. The current year PEs are around
10.

Added back Ebay at $34. I had sold to take tax losses and waited to see the Q1
report before adding back.

I would have sold off some of the furniture companies (Pier 1, Furniture
Brands, Natuzzi), but they went down too much before I pulled the trigger. Now,
I've got to think more about buying them.

I sold all my Equity Residential bought over the last 4 to 6 years. I'm selling
as much of the REITs as I can stomach the associated capital gains. I've worked
the REITs down below 11% of my portfolio, down from 35% at peak.

Hi Paul - Here is another article about Franklan's view on the Weyerhaeuser
assets.
http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/222301_weyer30.html

From the article:"...The value of Weyerhaeuser's timberland holdings may be
obscured by the company's pulp and paper business, operating in an industry
that has struggled for years, Winters said. The timber business, on the other
hand, "has good economics and is a good business."..."

According to the article "...Franklin was also a prime motivator in getting
Potlatch to study whether to convert to a real estate investment trust, said
Paul Latta, an analyst with McAdams Wright Ragen Inc. in Seattle. REITs have a
different tax status than traditional corporations, once considered more
favorable to shareholders.

Weyerhaeuser could consider spinning off its timberlands into a separate unit
or selling them, Latta said...."

==============================================================
It appears that management has been selling redundant assets since early
2002(http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2004/03/15/story1.html).
It's been 36 months and the company has kept a lot of their timberland assets.
This is their crown jewel. Perhaps management will convert the timberland
division into an REIT that could be spunn off to share holders.

Any idea what a REIT spinn off of the timberlands business would bring? I like
those assets and they are renewable too.

From:- with a K
Paul, I picked up some WY on 4/27 based on the heavy selling the previous 2
weeks and the speculation that financier Carl Icahn may be bidding for a stake.
I think it was a day later I read that Franklin had reported their large stake.
Should be interesting to see how this plays out.

re Bank stocks - i started a small position in CBH today on the selloff.
Valuations measures are OK, PE around 13, P/S around 3 based on 2005 numbers.
The interesting thing about CBH is that they have been growing deposits by 30%+
during the last years. CBH is expanding it's footprint and gaining market share
by being extremely customer friendly. Potential for 20% profit growth over the
next years make CBH current valuation metrics look cheap, IMO.

<Why are you bearish>

1) Valuations
2) Quality of Market Action (Speculative Activity).

Prime reason is #2 (for short term)
Prime Reason is #1 (for intermediate and long Term)

Bearish for me means S@P 500 and Nasdaq Composite here (especially most Tech
stocks).

Below is the Letter sent to BL by Loeb:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Blair Corporation
220 Hickory Street
Wharton, PA 16366-0001

Attn: Board of Directors and Executive Officers

We are pleased to see that the management and Board of Directors of Blair
Corporation have elected to monetize the company's consumer credit portfolio.
However, we are disappointed by the way in which the stock market continues to
value the company, even in light of the apparent likelihood of approximately
$140,000,000.00 in proceeds from such sale being distributed to shareholders.
As
an alternative to the distribution of a portion of the proceeds from the sale
of
the consumer credit portfolio, we propose the following transaction. Loeb
Partners Corporation, or an affiliate thereof, subject to due diligence and
other customary conditions, proposes to acquire Blair Corporation for $36.00
per
share, for an aggregate consideration of approximately $297 million based upon
8,247,426 shares outstanding. Should further value surface during due
diligence,
Loeb may be willing to increase the per share value of the transaction.

As you are aware, we are a family of investment funds located in New York, New
York and, together with our affiliates, the owner of approximately 6.7% of the
outstanding common stock of Blair. We are confident in our ability to finance
the proposed transaction. It is our intention to utilize cash on hand or a
financing arrangement. We are prepared to commence due diligence immediately
and
believe that we can complete the process in a very short period of time.

We believe this proposed transaction would provide liquidity and a premium to
current shareholders. We request that the Board of Directors consider our
proposal and respond on or before May 18, 2005. Please be advised that we have
no desire to pursue this proposed transaction other than on a friendly basis
with the support of the Board of the company. We and our advisors are prepared
to promptly meet with you to explain the details of our proposal and commence
the due diligence and transaction agreement negotiation process.

Loeb Partners Corporation

Gideon J. King

CBH looks like a good bank - good luck

CBH is a stock I have been following recently also. It is cheap compared to
where it used to trade, but it is still at a slight premium to the group and
banks are close to an all-time high. I'm not so sure it is going to be as easy
for them to grow deposits at 30%+ over the next few years. 1) with interest
rates rising, they will be competing with alternative products that offer
higher yields. The last two times the Fed tightened. 2) They have to open more
banks just to maintain their growth rate. Any slowdown in openings like we have
seen in Washington DC with zoning issues will hurt perception that this is a
growth story. I also wonder if their model works in other parts of the country.
3) Competitors getting better at defending their market share against the
regionals like CBH. They are opening branches longer and on weekends.

I think we'll see a short squeeze with the stock if the yield curve steepens.

re CBH - i believe that CBH is the best growth story among the larger bank
stocks I am following. In my own model I assume 20% deposit growth, which
should be achievable for quite a few years. With a current PE of around 13.5
(if I believe the analyst estimates) CBH with a 20% growth rate looks pretty
cheap, even discounting a tougher environment for banks in the next few years.
I have a small position only at this point but i am very inclined to add if the
stock falls for whatever reason.

ELN - Thanks Paul/MC/Dale for your reply on Jim Shepherd comments. Dale you are
right - he has been negative all along since 2004, but always say 99% signal of
a market crash. I am afraid once the market really crashed (after 1-2 years of
his initial signal), he would grab the latest crash signal and claim that was
it. Anyone know him long enough to clarify if that is not his style?

Paul, our ELN recovered to $7.4 today. For those brave hearts who bought at $3
over a month ago, it more than doubled! I am still a little bit under water but
will hold it out.

I covered my nose and added some UTSI today at $6.85. It will likely go down
since I bought it :-( I either had a bad strategy or unbelievable bad luck,
maybe both.

I just finished Ralph Wanger's excellent book on value investing "A Zebra In
Lion Country" in which he points out that the star forecasters who predicted
the October 1987 crash remained bearish during the recovery afterward and did
not go long for the subsequent huge bull runup.

Yet their newsletters still sell because they were "right" once out of many,
many wrong calls.

It's not what you do right or wrong one time, it's whether your approach to the
market (and there are many) makes money over time and beats the market
averages.

The rest is just hype and rhetoric.
