re Regional BANK stocks. I am slowly deploying funds in the sector. I
understand that the big guys are doing better trading stuff than the small guys
actually lending but still the dispersion in performance seems too large
lately. Everything RE related has been going up by huge amounts so why not
those holding the senior debt?

My plan is to make a significant sector bet, because i believe that the small
regional banks are going to benefit as well if indeed this recovery is for
real. I plan to allocate about 20% of my portfolio to this bet, maybe more if i
found good targets.

My plan is to buy a bunch of small cap bank stocks over time (next 6 month)
that are profitable, with decent equity ratios and credit quality and trading
below tangible book. Plenty of these critters around that nobody seems to care
about. Most trade on appointment so are too small to mention even on this
board, at least not before I have established my position <g>. The valuation
differences in the small bank group are nothing but amazing, again efficient
market at work. I'll buy the numbers not the chart, as usual.

re CSR. Looks incredible cheap at the first look. one thing is really strange -
as of 12/31/08 they had 150M$ in LT debt and paid 22M$ in interest (14.6%!),
despite the fact that they had 80M$ in cash. Maybe we should buy shares in
their lender instead. I have observed absurdly high interest rates with Chinese
companies before. Now CSR is issuing 50M$ in stock.

This is all based on yahoo numbers but they match the numbers in CSR's filings.
I think they do contract manufacturing and are structured as a rollup (hence
the stock issues). The earning estimates in yahoo do not go along well with the
earnings they had lately which seem to be about 50-60c/share.

speaking of microcaps, the best one I know of out there is CVU
(CPI Aerostructures )

CPI Aero produces structural aircraft parts for the U.S. Air Force, other
branches of the armed forces, and leading defense contractors. It supplies such
programs as the C-5 cargo jet, the T-38 Talon jet, the A-10 Thunderbolt attack
jet, the E-3 Sentry AWACS jet, the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, the Sikorsky
S-92 helicopter, the Gulfstream G650, and others.

The stock trades on the American Stock Exchange with approximately 6 M shares
outstanding and a float of 4.5M shares. This is a thinly traded stock with an
average daily volume of well under 15,000 shares. For a tiny company there is a
nice level of institutional ownership and insiders hold a sizeable amount.
There are no analysts currently covering the stock, but the CEO is unusually
candid and has given guidance for the next three years, which he has recently
confirmed. I suggest you listen to his last conference call and his recent
presentation at the Cowen conference. Both can be found on their website.
http://www.cpiaero.com/

The Company has made great strides in the last two years. Revenue in 2006 was
$17.9M and grew to $28M in 2007 and 2008 revenue is projected to be $35M. This
would represent an annualized growth rate of 40%. Net income (loss) in 2006 was
($1.3M) and grew to $1.9M in 2007, and the company is projecting 2008 net
income of $2.6M, a year-over-year increase of 37%.

In the recent earnings release, Edward J. Fred, President and CEO, supplied
quite a bit of detail concerning recent contract awards and, based on these and
on other long-term information currently available, he provided a long-term
outlook for 2009 through 2011. He projects 2009 revenue to be in the range
$42M-$45M with net income in the range $3.9M-$4.3M. Furthermore, using 2008 as
the baseline, and for the three-year period ending in 2011, he projects an
annualized growth rate for revenue in the range 30%-35% and an annualized
growth rate for net income in the range 50%-60%.

In the lastest conf call for 6/30/09 he reaffirmed all the above numbers and
even gave reasons why and how he could exceed them significantly

Even in this lousy environment you would expect the Company's price to have
done much better, but based on 13 g's recently filed, it appears some of the
Company's largest holders have had to reduce some of their positions, creating
market headwinds.

(also, the yahoo board does a good job of following this company.

Forgot to mention that I sold CHFI earlier. But I still own a great deal of
CNOA, one of the stocks that CHFI is holding. CNOA has also been on a tear.

Last week I added to PRSC. The company is similar to RSCR in that they are
community based providers of social services, but they don't compete against
each other as they address different subsets of the Medicaid population.

The SP has been on a roller coaster the last year. States were delaying
payments for services and the declining share price violated bank convenants.
Eventually they worked it out with their banking syndicate and the states paid
for their services after receiving help from the federal government.

In 1996 the company did two million in revenue. This year their revenue will be
almost a billion. Medicaid enrollment is up greatly this year and if any of the
healthcare proposals pass, their business will increase greatly.

Management is paying down debt as they realize that they were overleveraged.
They are bringing their leverage down from seven to three and recently
announced a voluntary payment against their senior debt.

Not to worry about the shelf. If you look at the projected business increases
over the next few qtrs and years, you will see why they need additional capital
(stock or loans) to funds their receivables and work in progress. Knowing that
the govt and the primes are their major customers, you know these guys are

Paul, now here's one you should give a serious look to

JAV

Is Javelin Worth A Second Look?
Written by Nicholas DeCesare
Monday, 19 October 2009 00:00

Much has transpired at Javelin Pharmaceuticals (AMEX:JAV) since I wrote about
the company back in August. Javelin is a specialty pharmaceutical company,
which develops and commercializes products for the pain management market
primarily in the United States and Europe.

Shortly after my article, Javelin moved over $2.00 on the hopes that their
Phase III data on Ereska would be positive. However, Javelin began their August
11th conference call by stating that the Ereska trial had not met its endpoint.
The randomized, multicenter, double-blind, 1:1 placebo-controlled study
assessed the safety and analgesic efficacy of repeated doses of Ereska over 6
hours in 259 patients with acute moderate-to-severe pain following orthopedic
surgery. It yielded a P-value of 0.053, just missing the standard for
statistical significance of 0.05 or less. The stock tanked into the $1.35
range.

In the months of September and early October, the stock took off again,
recovering back over $2.00, but now hovers around $1.55. There are several
reasons that Javelin is worthy of a second look and could have huge upside
potential. At the August 11th conference call, CEO Marty Driscoll clearly
outlined the direction the company was headed and what great things may be
ahead for Javelin. First, Mr. Driscoll clearly stated that despite the P-value
of Ereska missing its desired outcome, it was clear during the trial that
Ereska worked. He also stated that the FDA would look at the data and discuss
their findings with Javelin. More importantly, Mr. Driscoll believes that it is
possibly once all the data is reviewed by Javelin, that Ereska results may in
fact yield a different P-value.

But, Javelin’s real “jewel” is Dyloject. In fact the company stated that they
believe they will file their first ever NDA for Dyloject in the United States
within the next few weeks. Dyloject is used to treat post-operative pain and
addresses an underserved medical need for safe and effective injectable NSAIDs
(Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)in the hospital setting here in the
United States. It is already approved and marketed in Europe. The potential
here in the United States is for Dyloject to be a multi-million dollar drug.
Just how big Dyloject can be, is still up for debate. However, high estimates
put this blockbuster drug in the hundred millions within a year or two of
approval here in the United States. Of course, that brings up the most
interesting part of the conference call with Mr. Driscoll. He made it very
clear that the “value drivers” for Javelin for the rest of the year would be:
filing a high quality NDA for Dyloject and removing any financial overhang by
completing a major strategic transaction. When analysts asked Mr. Driscoll
about the strategic partnership that Javelin was looking into, it became clear
that Javelin was entertaining offers from other pharmaceutical companies to buy
them outright.

So, why the recent decline in stock price? The simple answer is, impatient
investors who waited a couple months since the August conference call and when
no deal was made, sold their stock. However, for the patient investor, Javelin
may prove to be a huge payoff. Mr. Driscoll made it very clear that Javelin was
still on track to file their NDA this fall, and he also made it clear that
“much was near at hand.” When asked if discussions have moved past partnerships
for Dyloject before the NDA is even filed, Mr. Driscoll stated that discussions
with others have expanded well beyond Dyloject. With such limited downside, an
investment in Javelin Pharmaceuticals could be a huge payoff in the very near
future. If Mr. Driscoll is true to his word, Javelin may be filing their NDA
very soon, partnering with bigger pharma, and possibly a solid acquisition
target. With 3 products in Phase III trials, no debt, and a small market cap, I
believe an acquisition is exactly what is “near at hand.”

Pretty much an immediate dismissal for me for JAV.

Why is this stock a value stock?

From the article, it's not because of the balance sheet or earnings, but rather
because of the favorable prospects the author and the ceo believe for Dyloject.

So for me to buy this stock, even in my small spec plays, I have to believe in
Dyloject, maybe even be an expert in it, or else I have to believe in others
who belive in it - the ceo and/or the article author.

Irks me when author states, "So, why the recent decline in stock price? The
simple answer is, impatient investors who waited a couple months since the
August conference call and when no deal was made, sold their stock."

Confusing speculators/market players/investors. Investors almost by definition
are patient. And "investors", here, would have to be people who've carefully
considered the situation and determined the stock offers safety of principal
and an adequate return.

Hard for me to see that with this company/stock info. provided.

Of course that doesn't mean the drug won't be a roaring success or that the
stock won't go from $1.60 to $16. If it does though, it'll most likely be
without me.

Perhaps I am missing something about JAV. A/o now though, with my quick look, I
pass.

Paul, there is not that much to believe in. Dyloject has already been approved
in Great Britain and they have a major parter who is working to expand it thru
pout Europe. It will shortly file in the US. The drug as been used for year so
approval is almost assured (as much as can be). Plus they have to other drugs

RE:SVU

Are you going to redeploy the funds back into the food & grocery sector? Will
you close out the entire position?

The only other positive I see in the company (SVU), is this is the first
quarter with the new CEO. Previously he was with WalMart and had expertise in
marketing. This was what SVU lacked and I like the idea of change at the top.

My strategy will be to continue to hold the position but sell some March
covered calls to generate the income which the dividend provided. This should
be enough time to see which direction the new CEO takes the company and if he
can extract the value for the shareholders.

Based on the performance of other food retailers, SWY or WMT might be good

Einhorn makes a lot of sense. So how does the small investor build a position
based on his strategy?

From his October 19, 2009 speech at the Value Investing Congress:

"...We have bought long-dated options on much higher U.S. and Japanese interest
rates. The options in Japan are particularly cheap because the historical
volatility is so low. I prefer options to simply shorting government bonds,
because there remains a possibility of a further government bond rally in
response to the economy rolling over again. With options, I can clearly limit
how much I am willing to lose, while creating a lot of leverage to a possible
rate spiral...."

I agree with his overview of the situation one year later....

"...The lesson that I have learned is that it isn’t reasonable to be agnostic
about the big picture. For years I had believed that I didn’t need to take a
view on the market or the economy because I considered myself to be a “bottom
up” investor. Having my eyes open to the big picture doesn’t mean abandoning
stock picking, but it does mean managing the longshort exposure ratio more
actively, worrying about what may be brewing in certain industries, and when
appropriate, buying some just-in-case insurance for foreseeable macro risks
even if they are hard to time.

==================================================================

It's possible that Corporate debt will be better than sovereign debt unless the

Chevron announces new gas find off Australia

SAN RAMON, Calif. — Energy company Chevron Corp. said Sunday it has made an
additional discovery of natural gas in the giant Gorgon gas field being
developed off the northwest coast of Australia.

Chevron said the Achilles-1 exploration well, located about 100 miles off the
coast, was drilled to 14,800 feet. The well is located in the WA-374-P permit
area.

Chevron owns half the project and is the field operator. ExxonMobil and Shell
each hold a 25 percent stake.

In August, Chevron announced discoveries in wells off of Western Australia
state. The company and its partners are developing the field, one of the
world’s largest, with a plant constructed on Barrow Island. The first gas is
expected to be delivered in 2014.

Deals to export gas already have been signed with China, India, Japan and South
Korea.

================================================================

Many of these new finds are off the coast and are very deep wells that require
these new deep drilling platforms. It seems like ExxonMobile has their finger
in everyone of these projects. Maybe I need to add to my small XOM position.

dpdw. i cant say Im in love with it but considering that they were able to sell
57 million shares last year at .70 i guess there is always hope that that the
ceo will step down and hire someone who can turn a profit. Im in for 10,000
shares. id hate to see this thing turn around and me left watching with no skin

longs and increasing my shorts. instead im covering yet another short position

Re:FRpK Preferred series K - Doubled up my previous position.

Starting December 2009, I will have held some of my REIT preferred series for
one year and will be selling those to book long term capital gains. To replace
the lost yield, I have been accumulating new positions in the FR preferred
series at prices between $10/share and $15.00/share.

These should eventually trade above $20.00/share like the other REIT preferred
shares, hopefully before the Fed starts to increase rates.

My exit strategy is to sell my REIT preferred shares in my taxable accounts
once they turn into a Long Term Capital gains AND trade above $20.00/share
($25.00 is PAR value based on IPO). I have buys in REIT preferred shares on
12/2008 and 03/2009. After 3/2009, I should only hold the FR preferred series
(J&K) in the taxable account.

===================================================================

Also added Penn West Energy Trust (PWE) to my basket of Canadian Oil Trusts.
Will be selling some to book tax/loss before year end with the plan to maintain
current allocation into 2010 (about 8% of portfolio among EEQ, ERF, PWE, PVX).

To sell 17.5 mln shares at C$14.25 apiece

* To use net proceeds for the Detour Lake gold project

* Offering priced at a discount of 2.8 pct

Oct 22 (Reuters) - Canadian gold explorer Detour Gold Corp (DGC.TO) said it
would raise about C$250 million ($239.5 million) through a bought deal
financing to advance its Detour Lake gold project.

Detour Gold said a syndicate of underwriters led by RBC Capital Markets will
buy 17.5 million shares for C$14.25 per share, a 2.8 percent discount to Detour
Gold's Wednesday closing price.

The underwriters will have an option to increase the size of the offering by up
to an additional 1.8 million shares, for gross proceeds of up to C$25 million.

Detour Gold shares, which have gained more than 15 percent in the past month,
closed at C$14.67 Wednesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. ($1=1.044 Canadian
Dollar) (Reporting by Krishna Chaithanya in Bangalore; Editing by Ratul Ray
Chaudhuri)

(Not sure why the stock has now dropped below $14 can. Seems like a positive
that they were able to raise so much cash and didnt have to offer any warrants
to make it happen as is normally the case for development companies. This
continues to be a very oversized position for me. So I will not be adding but I
do think that this decline will be a temporary one, as I think it means that
there is institutional buying here at $14.25 can. and the underwriters will of
course be happy to see the price closer well over that so they can exercise
their option and make some more moolah.)

I sold off my junk to raise some cash and buy some things if they get cheap
enough.

on a different topic, it seem strange to me that anyone is buying the newly
public reits. I will look at them if and when they sell at a serious discount
to nav.

Am sitting here contemplating my brother-in-law. Believe it will be very hard
for me or professional investors to beat him in the stock market this year
(with the metric of percent portfolio gain). Unlike all previous years, I
believe this year he might be doing way better than me (percentage-wise).
Consider: a person who's come late in life to both the stock market and to a
high-paying job. All his investing is in a variety of mutual funds in an ira
made from company contributions from his salary. As the market fell, he just
kept his max ira deductions going into his combo of stock/bond funds. Which let
him dollar-cost average to pick up ever more shares at Dec/Mar lows. Given he's
only been investing for maybe 10 years and has his good salary now, his
contributions are large compared to portfolio value, so picking up more shares
at the lows was/is a significant $ bump to the overall portfolio value.

My sister-in-law, maybe another in that situation. (She avoided some pain by
just not opening her monthly brokerage statements. -g-_) Sure seems to beat
whatever I've been doing - running around
looking/reading/screening/posting/buying/selling/crying and moaning. -g-. (Of
course, everybody's situation is different. One has to play the cards one's
dealt. I've no paying job.)

Plenty of people like these two though, I'd guess. A/o today, they seem to have
come through stronger-than-ever the worst market crash in a generation. You
would have had to have had a job, an investment plan, be following it, and had
the guts/brains/luck/emotional indifference to stay the course.

so I decided to move on.

At forward p/e of 12, roe would be 2.43/23 (roughly) or about 11%. Makes it
more of a gaarp stock for me than a value buy. Dividend yield, 1.5%, not enough
to keep my patience.
Offsetting that, a buyer/holder does get BK which has a franchise/moat for
"asset servicing".

Economy improves, market continues okay, I suspect BK (the stock) might
continue to do okay too. I don't envision great improvement though from current

BK stock has recovered less then most other banks. ROE (including goodwill) as
you calculated it, is irrelevant since the goodwill was created when Mellon and
Bank of New York formed the new BK in 2007. The return based on tangible book
is very high - as an asset servicer, BK does not need a whole lot of capital.

Due to it's business, BK has a large low cost float but investing this float
into risky paper got them into trouble. I think Bank of New York had a history
of screwing up but with the Mellon guys now in charge more, i hope these times
are over. I think this business is worth 15x earnings when run properly.

Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Gulf Resources Inc., a Chinese producer of bromine and
other specialty chemicals, plans to expand production capacity to take
advantage of a 36 percent jump in domestic prices since the start of the year,
said Chief Executive Officer Xiaobin Liu.
The company, which is listing on the Nasdaq stock market tomorrow, is targeting
a 30 percent share of the market for bromine, used in flame-retardant
materials, from 20 percent, he said in an interview in Bloomberg’s New York
headquarters. Gulf Resources also plans to expand in “higher margin” businesses
such as pharmaceuticals and fertilizers, he said.
“We’re starting to see a recovery in bromine prices in the third quarter,” Liu,
41, said. “We expect prices to grow steadily because of China’s economic
recovery.”
Gulf Resources is the largest bromine producer in China with eight production
facilities, Liu said. He expects the number of domestic manufacturers to fall
to 30 within the next five years from the current 70 to 80.
The Shouguang, China-based company expects revenue of $100 million this year,
up from $85 million in 2008, Liu said. Profit may jump to $27 million in 2009
from $22 million in the year- earlier period, he said.
Gulf Resources rose 7.3 percent to $10.35 in over-the- counter trading at 2:25
p.m. in New York.

Upped my few shares of Israeli tech conglomerate ELRN.

They got a non-binding offer for one of their companies, Medingo. They own most
of the company, from what I read, and the offer is for "a cash consideration
ranging from $150-170 mln and a contingent additional cash consideration
conditional upon one or more milestone(s) to be mutually agreed, which may
bring total consideration up to $185-213 mln."

If this is all true and comes to fruition, I have to believe ELRN with an
enterprise value of maybe about $255M, and with all its other incubator
companies, is undervalued at $7/sh.

reserves look pretty skimpy now
http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS226402+26-Oct-2009+GNW20091026

Carinalli was loaning money to an convict (Soderling) whose company "Ripp it"
wanted to build houses at Borax lake. This is no joke. Funny story unless you
loaned money to these guys. I don't know if it's related to Summit State banks
bad loan, just speculation on my part.

In the meantime OSHC earnings look great. Credit quality is very good, yet the
stock still trades as if they are affiliated with the Sopranos.

an expression of non binding interest means exactly that, so why bother tossing
out any figures that are subject to change anyway. If there were some specifics
including some kind of penalty if the deal doesnt go through id be much more
inclined to add. I watched the lang oleary exchange show on cbc.ca. they had a
brief interview with bill gross of pimco. He made little sense to me. He doesnt
see any inflation on the horizon for the next several years despite the huge
growth in the money supply but didnt explain why. practically in the same

that Gross must be concerned about inflation and that he pays attention to what

ROIAK is surging on EPS of $0.25!

Radio One, Inc. Reports Third Quarter Results
On 7:00 am EDT, Thursday October 29, 2009

WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Radio One, Inc. (Nasdaq: ROIAK -
News and ROIA - News) today reported its results for the quarter ended
September 30, 2009. Net revenue was approximately $75.5 million, a decrease of
12% from the same period in 2008. Station operating income(1) was approximately
$32.7 million, a decrease of 6% from the same period in 2008. Net income was
approximately $14.2 million or $0.25 per diluted share, an improvement from the
net loss of approximately $266.1 million or $2.81 per diluted share for the
same period in 2008.

(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20090806/PH57529LOGO )

Alfred C. Liggins, III, Radio One's CEO and President commented, "Our third
quarter results contain mixed signals. The sequential improvement in radio
revenue that we have been seeing since Q1 continued, but not as strongly as I
would have liked. While certain of our larger categories are showing signs of
recovery (food and beverage -1.6% year-to-year, retail -2.5%, healthcare -4.4%,
government/public was flat), others continue to display significant weakness
(automotive -37.6% year-to-year, financial -22.9%, telecoms -10.2%,
entertainment -10.0%). The efforts we have made to cut costs and streamline the
business have positively impacted the income statement, and I believe position
us well for the future. I was pleased that our radio division outperformed
their markets once again, this time by 390 basis points."

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements represent management's current
expectations and are based upon information available to Radio One at the time
of this release. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Radio One's
control, that may cause the actual results to differ materially from any future
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially are described in Radio One's reports on Form 10-K/A and
other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Radio One does not
undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.

Net revenue decreased to approximately $75.5 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2009, from approximately $86.2 million for the same period in
2008, a decrease of 12.4%. Our radio stations generally continue to outperform
competitor stations in their marketplaces, this quarter by 390 basis points,
and as with the second quarter, our total net revenue improved sequentially
over the 16.0% decline then reported. The prolonged weak economic environment
continued to adversely impact radio, online and print advertising and also
caused a reduction in sponsorships for certain key events held during the
quarter.

Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based
compensation and impairment of long-lived assets decreased to approximately
$47.5 million from approximately $58.2 million for the quarters ended September
30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, a decrease of 18.4%. Our cost cutting
initiatives continued to pay off, specifically with compensation savings from
employee layoffs, bonus eliminations and salary cuts, vacation benefit savings
from scheduled office closings and reductions to discretionary expenses such as
promotional expenses, contractor spending, and travel and entertainment.
Events' spending was also curtailed in light of sponsorship declines. Revenue
declines continued to drive further savings in commissions and national
representative fees and with fewer client bankruptcies compared to last year,
we incurred less bad debt expense. We also incurred lower issue related costs
for Giant Magazine and less traffic acquisition costs for our internet
business. This quarter included $263,000 in restructuring charges for the
restructuring and consolidation of the Company's radio business offices,
compared to a $490,000 restructuring charge for layoffs that occurred in third
quarter 2008.

Stock-based compensation decreased to $302,000 for the quarter ended September
30, 2009, compared to $415,000 for the same period in 2008, or 27.4%.
Stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation costs for all
stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of
compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The decrease
in stock-based compensation was due primarily to the vesting completion,
forfeiture and cancellation of certain stock option and restricted stock
grants.

Impairment of long-lived assets for the three months ended September 30, 2008
reflects a non-cash charge recorded for the impairment of radio broadcasting
licenses in 11 of our 16 markets, namely Charlotte, Cincinnati, Cleveland,
Columbus, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Raleigh-Durham, Richmond
and St. Louis. As a result of the economic downturn and the deterioration it
caused to the 2008 radio industry outlook, which negatively impacted revenue,
profitability and terminal values, interim impairment testing was performed in
August 2008, which resulted in the impairment charges recorded third quarter
2008. Given the prolonged challenging economic climate and its adverse impact
on both radio and online advertising spending, we performed interim impairment
testing as of August 2009, and concluded no further impairment to our radio
licenses or goodwill had occurred.

Interest expense decreased to approximately $9.2 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2009, from approximately $14.1 million for the same period in
2008, a decline of 34.7%. The decrease in interest expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2009 was due primarily to early redemptions of the
Company's 8(7)/(8)% Senior Subordinated Notes due July 2011, and to a lesser
extent, more favorable rates and pay downs of outstanding debt on the Company's
senior credit facility.

As there were no early bond redemptions for the quarter ended September 30,
2009, there was no gain on retirement of debt to report for the quarter,
compared to approximately $5.7 million for the same period in 2008. The third
quarter 2008 gain on retirement of debt was due to the early redemption of
approximately $43.1 million of the Company's 8 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes
due July 2011 during the quarter, at an average discount of 14.0%. A principal
amount of $101.5 million remained outstanding as of September 30, 2009 for
these senior subordinated notes.

Equity in income of affiliated company increased to approximately $1.4 million
for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, compared to equity in loss of
affiliated company of approximately $1.1 million for the same period in 2008.
The amounts are attributable to our share of net income or loss generated by TV
One, LLC ("TV One") for the quarters ended September 30, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The Company's share of TV One's income is driven by TV One's
current capital structure and the Company's ownership levels in the equity
securities of TV One that are currently absorbing its net income.

Income taxes for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 was a benefit of
approximately $1.5 million, compared to a benefit of approximately $59.7
million for the same quarter in 2008, a decrease of 97.5%. The tax benefit for
the quarter ended September 30, 2008 related to the impairment of indefinite
lived intangibles in that quarter which reduced the deferred tax liability.
There was no impairment in the quarter ended September 30, 2009, hence the
benefit for the quarter was greatly reduced from 2008. The Company continues to
maintain a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets ("DTAs"),
except for DTAs associated with definite lived assets.

Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $87,000 for the quarter
ended September 30, 2009, compared to income from discontinued operations, net
of tax, of $639,000 for the same period in 2008. The loss from discontinued
operations, net of tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2009 is
primarily due to legal and professional expenses incurred as a result of
ongoing legal activity from previous station sales. The income from
discontinued operations, net of tax, for the three months ended September 30,
2008 includes a tax benefit of $716,000, compared to a tax benefit of $92,000
included in the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the third
quarter 2009.

Other pertinent financial information includes capital expenditures of
approximately $1.7 million and $2.8 million for the quarters ended September
30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2009, Radio
One had total debt (net of cash balances) of approximately $644.3 million.

In March 2008, the Company's board of directors authorized a repurchase of
shares of the Company's Class A and Class D common stock through December 31,
2009 of up to $150.0 million, the maximum amount allowable under the Credit
Agreement. The amount and timing of such repurchases will be based on pricing,
general economic and market conditions and the restrictions contained in the
agreements governing the Company's credit facilities and subordinated debt and
certain other factors. While $150.0 million is the maximum amount allowable
under the Credit Agreement, in 2005 under a prior board authorization, the
Company utilized approximately $78.0 million to repurchase common stock leaving
capacity of $72.0 million under the Credit Agreement. During the quarter ended
September 30, 2009, the Company repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of
Class D common stock for $790,981 at an average price of $0.42. As of September
30, 2009, the Company had approximately $49.2 million in capacity available
under the share repurchase program taking into account the limitations of the
Credit Agreement and prior repurchase activity.

The Company announced during its 2008 fourth quarter conference call that it
would move to an annual conference call schedule as opposed to a quarterly
conference call schedule, effective for the fiscal year 2009. Thus no
conference call is scheduled for discussion of the third quarter results.

broadcasting companies and the largest radio broadcasting company that
primarily targets African-American and urban listeners. Radio One currently

Notes:

1 "Station operating income" consists of net loss or income before depreciation
and amortization, corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, equity in
income or loss of affiliated company, income taxes, noncontrolling interest in
income of subsidiaries, interest expense, impairment of long-lived assets,
other income or expense, gain on retirement of debt, and income or loss from
discontinued operations, net of tax. Station operating income is not a measure
of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles.
Nevertheless we believe station operating income is often a useful measure of a
broadcasting company's operating performance and is a significant basis used by
our management to measure the operating performance of our stations within the
various markets because station operating income provides helpful information
about our results of operations apart from expenses associated with our
physical plant, income taxes, investments, debt financings, gain on retirement
of debt, corporate overhead, stock-based compensation, impairment of long-lived
assets and income or losses from asset sales. Station operating income is
frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in our industry,
although our measure of station operating income may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures of other companies. Station operating income does not
purport to represent operating income or cash flow from operating activities,
as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles, and
should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an
indicator of our performance. A reconciliation of operating income to station
operating income has been provided in this release.

2 For the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, Radio One had
56,242,964 and 94,537,081 shares of common stock outstanding on a weighted
average basis (basic) and 56,684,369 and 94,537,081 shares of common stock
outstanding on a weighted average basis (fully diluted) for outstanding stock
options, respectively.

3 For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, Radio One had
61,873,161 and 97,219,115 shares of common stock outstanding on a weighted
average basis, both basic and fully diluted for outstanding stock options,
respectively.

4 "Adjusted EBITDA" consists of net loss or income plus (1) depreciation,
amortization, income taxes, interest expense, equity in income or loss of
affiliated company, noncontrolling interest in income of subsidiaries,
impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, other income or
expense and loss or (income) from discontinued operations, net of tax, less (2)
interest income and gain on retirement of debt. Net income before interest
income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and
amortization is commonly referred to in our business as "EBITDA." Adjusted
EBITDA and EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under generally
accepted accounting principles. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is often a useful
measure of a company's operating performance and is a significant basis used by
our management to measure the operating performance of our business because
Adjusted EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest
expense that have resulted from our acquisitions and debt financing, our taxes,
impairment charges, as well as our equity in loss of our affiliated company,
gain on retirement of debt and any discontinued operations. Accordingly, we
believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information about the operating
performance of our business, apart from the expenses associated with our
physical plant, capital structure or the results of our affiliated company.
Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses
in our industry, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA do
not purport to represent operating income or cash flow from operating
activities, as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting
principles, and should not be considered as alternatives to those measurements
as an indicator of our performance. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA has been provided in this release.

Upping by a few shares more my few Alexander and Baldwin (ALEX, formerly AXB)
as stock drops upon release of blah earnings report.

P/s, p/b still relatively low. Div yield over 4%. Their Matson line dominates
the shipping between mainland USA and Hawaii.

MFCAF down from its highs. I'll add a few more shares now.

I like company's stated emphasis on book value - preserving and increasing it.
And that stock is selling below stated bv.

i covered some of my shorts at breakeven. the market reversed itself in a
hurry. i got back about 1/2 of yesterdays losses. I ended up adding to elron
after all. added to my shorts of aig and zion. covered my shorts of db, wfc,
and spy. decided to hold on to my nat gas stock chk and sd, and added more to
ceres global ag fund which was selling at under 2/3 of 10/9/09 NAV.

OT rant : I dont see how Geithner can hold onto his job much longer. There is
now increasing evidence that besides being an inept regulator, the guy is at
best a buffoon who was part if the group that wasted tens of billions of
taxpayer money in the covert AIG bailout of big banks, who are now using that
money to offer big bonuses to their staff, while main treet continues to be
hung out to dry. One can either laugh or cry at the ongoing discussions after
the horses are gone to lock the barn door.

I also dont understand how this guy Friedman who apparently bought 50,000
shares of Goldman Sacks after sitting in on the discussions and determining
that Goldman Sacks would be paid 100 cents on the dollars from AIG isnt being
prosecuted for insider trading. If that isnt inside information then what is?

NSRGY (47.15$) AYE (24.1$). I Sold my NSRGY position in my IRA account (keeping
a substantial position in taxable accounts). Almost a 50% gainer for me. Quite
amazing what a food stock can do without any substantial change in outlook.

I bought just a little AYE (electric utility). That was just about he only
stock down today. They do have quite a bit of coal plants (with some build in
advantages, as management claims) but also quite attractive regulated and
transmission assets (the latter is where they put a substantial part of their
investment $ in).

i continue to watch the share price of mfcaf. its like a separately managed
fund for me. its a big part of my portfolio and I will be happy to see it
continue to increase nav over the next few years.

gfre reported some numbers on thursday:

I also see somebody posted a writeup on on seeking alpha:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/169987-gulf-resources-cashing-in-on-bromine?sou
ce=yahoo

I expect GFRE to be discovered a bit more with the nasdaq listing, and
write-up. I dont think that a 15 p/e would be outlandish for a company like
this, so I think $20 is certainly possible here over the next 12 months and I
see little downside from here. Of course I too am frequently wrong.

FWIW, I had covered my ANN short at small profit earlier this week (plus
written option premium). Guess I covered too early. Am close to 100% net cash
in trading account currently. Not saying there aren't values out there, but
unwilling to risk too much capital at this point.

Hi Paul -

RE: SFL

Increased my SFL position by 30%. Now in my top 10 positions (#6). SFL pays a
qualified dividend now yielding 10.5%. The company also offers a dividend
reinvestment option for stock at a 5% discount (to the 12 day market avg) which
should continue for a limited period.

The last time I checked, the company's average lease contract period was 14
years across their entire fleet. The PE is 4.5 and analysts have next year
earnings at $2.48/share. BV is around $9.00/share. Their most expensive assets
are their deep water drill rigs which are probably worth more today and
currently generate the largest long term income streams.

I expect the market to be in a trading range foe the next 12-18 months and am
looking to generate income for the portfolio. The kicker for SFL is if oil does
move higher, they participate in profit sharing agreements on several of their
lease contracts (specifically the deep water drill rigs). They receive a
percentage of the income exceeding their base amount.

My previous buys were at $16 (5/2006) and $12 (10/2008) and sells at $29.00
(7/2008) and $23.00 (9/2008). I missed loading up in Feb-April 2008 @
$5.00-$8.00 but have had my dividend reinvested since they began offering it
last year.

The weekly SMA for SFL is right around $11.00/share and the daily SMA is around
$12.50/share. At current prices ($11.00-$12.00) the stock seems like a good
value.

My two year target price is around $20.00/share and if they raise their
dividend next year to 2007/2008 levels, that is not an unreasonable price to
expect.

================================================================

I was looking to unwind 1/2 of my Stimulus trade that I put on in 08/2009 with
SIEMENS A G ADR (NYSE: SI) and ABB LTD (NYSE: ABB) but was too late in getting
out. ABB is back to where I bought it and SI gave back 50% of my profits in the
last three trading days. I think the selling was over done but want to be out
before the stimulus money runs out late next year.

Good job on selling some of your UTX as you hit close to the recovery high. As
these companies traded well above the 50 day SMA, it was only a matter of time
before they tested the trend line. If the daily SMA trend lines do not hold,
the weekly 50 SMA is much lower (10%-14% lower). Don't know if we will test
these weekly 50 SMA levels, but I want to be out of my speculative buys if we
do.

In this market, it is better to exit the position and come back latter once all
the sellers have exited.

EKS. SFL: I may join you in adding to position. I'll review their latest
presentation a little closer.
===========================================
"In this market, it is better to exit the position and come back latter once
all the sellers have exited."

We have a lot of people doing that. Pretty difficult for somebody to be willing
to endure one more time the falling market and/or volatility we are seeing if
it's going to be like Oct-Mar of last year. People now seem more willing to
sell more quickly. Not hold on to positions. So this feeds the downdraft as
stops are hit, and people sell and wait for better entry points. I find it
scary, making it more difficult for me to hold on.
