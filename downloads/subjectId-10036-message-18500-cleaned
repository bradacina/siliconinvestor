HELE gets plugged by Zacks. Yahoo shows a PEG of .89 and EPS consensus of $2.23
next year, up from my $2.12 calculation in the link.

Snip:

Here is a synopsis of why these stocks have a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).
Note that a #1 Strong Buy rating is applied to 5% of all the stocks we rank:

Helen of Troy Ltd. (NASDAQ: HELE, news) is a designer, developer and worldwide
marketer of brand-name personal care products. Solid product performance in the
U.S. and abroad helped Helen of Troy report a strong third quarter earlier this
month, including net earnings of 78 cents per diluted share on sales of more
than $179 million. That earnings result beat the consensus by almost +26% while
sales improved by +25% year-over-year. The company's sales increased in almost
every segment, led by retail personal care products, the Professional division,
the International division, and its Idelle Labs skin and hair care products.
Helen of Troy felt comfortable enough to raise its earnings per diluted share
guidance for the fiscal year ending February 29, 2004. Analysts have raised
expectations for the years ending February 2004 and February 2005 by about +11%
each over the past seven trading days. Helen of Troy is not the only cosmetics
company experiencing improved earnings estimates in the current environment.
Helen of Troy is very optimistic that its fourth quarter will be strong as
well, so investors may want to groom their portfolios with some shares of HELE.

Latest Kiplinger magazine has an article on "Five Stocks to Sell Now". I own
some stocks on that list of course -g-.
(TOY and RKY)

I have cut back today, by 1/2, my small position in RKY. The p/e and p/sales
are pretty reasonable, but I tend to agree w/Kiplinger that the negatives are
strong too - Coors is undercapitalized when compared to the marketing and
distribution resources BUD has. BUD is also trouncing everyone with their
low-carb Ultra. OTOH, this is all well known, so possibly RKY won't decline
much from here, esp. if the overall market holds up. OTOH again, it doesn't
look to me like RKY will perform very well either going forward this year as it
tries to compete with Budweiser & others. I was looking for about $5 more from
the stock - from $55 to $60. Believe I'm better served now though by deploying
funds elsewhere.
--------
Sold half my small position in ITG. This company (stock) is influenced by the
amount of shares traded in the stock markets, and volume is picking up.
Forthcoming company news might be very good for the stock - or it might not be;
I sold some shares now though to capture a short-term capital loss.

No, he really meant to say that there isn't any difference. One of many
examples:

"Market commentators and investment managers who glibly refer to "growth" and
"value" styles as contrasting approaches to investment are displaying their
ignorance, not their sophistication. Growth is simply a component usually a
plus, sometimes a minus in the value equation."

Okay, but do we then get to this conclusion:

There's no difference between growth and value styles or approaches. Growth is
a component of value.

FFIV is proposed as a stock for this thread's consideration. If you don't see
it as a value stock, consider it as a growth stock. That is, it's a value stock
with perhaps a very large growth component.

This stock therefore meets the requirement of the thread.

If a stock like FFIV meets requirements, then such a stock should be expected
to be seen here by thread readers.

If a stock like FFIV fits, then I have to really stretch to find a stock that
doesn't fit.
Conclusion: Any and all stocks could be posted here and still be called
appropriate to a value thread.

Although as I re-read the post, FFIV is mentioned as owned by several mutual
funds and as a possible take-over play, not as specifically as a 'growth'
stock.

Mark, I recall one book said the major difference between Buffett and Graham is
that Buffett changed Graham's net-net value approach, and counted "growth" as
part of the "value". Graham never liked "growth".

I tend to like Buffett's approach, since you will not be able to buy a single
stock in 1998-2001 since the market was grossly overvalued. There were
below-cash net-net plays in late 2002 to early 2003, but now they are all gone
and you will probably have to wait for a year or two to buy those
"trouble-free" net-net stocks.

Graham's reasoning is "growth" is always priced in the market. All the analyst
forecast stuff are simply pricing in those anticipated growth. It makes sense.
My answer is to be a superior investor, one can develop expertise in some
industry/sectors so that s/he can see what average Wall Street analysts don't
see, and have a more accurate forecast/estimate than them. Based on that s/he
can predict the company is going to beat or miss the estimates, thus has a much
better chance to profit, than taking the face value of analyst estimates.

Yes.

FFIV is proposed as a stock for this thread's consideration. If you don't see
it as a value stock, consider it as a growth stock. That is, it's a value stock
with perhaps a very large growth component.

That would depend. I'm not really familiar with FFIV, nor am I interested in it
because I have no way to value it. I have no way to predict with any degree of
confidence what the future growth will be. Most likely (but not necessarily)
Buffett would have the same problem. Certainly if anyone is going to make a
value case for FFIV they would need to explain what their growth estimates are,
how they arrived at them, and why and to what degree they are confident that
they are sound.

You could also make the case that it is extremely unlikely that a company like
FFIV is going to trade at a level that would make it a Graham style "obscene
value play", because the market's tendency is almost always to overvalue
companies in hypergrowth mode. For that matter, I must admit that I've wondered
how a few of the ideas that have shown up here could ever be considered as
value plays based on their current fundamentals. However, as you say, the
thread traffic is manageable and the discussion is very constructive. As long
as that remains true, I don't think it really matters one way or the other what
kind of label you want to use.

Since we are considering growth stocks today, I consider XICO a short term
"strong hold" and a long term "buy". The company had a good report and an even
better "must listen" conference call. The company is roughly where FARO was
about 4 quarters ago, in an industry that gets a better valuation. It appears
that Q2 will start the breakout period, like it was for FARO in Q2 2003.

My guess is that the stock will see $30's in 4-5 quarters, if the market holds
up (which it probably won't). More realistically it will get to the high teens.
Long term, in the next bull market, it will probably see $50-100, as it is busy
creating durable competitive advantage in the high end of the analog mixed

I don't think it's exactly true that Graham "never liked" growth, it's more
that he was very conservative in what he was willing to pay for it because of
the uncertainties involved. In principle I think he was right - a net/net today
is more certain than anticipated x% growth over the next y years.

I think that Buffett's insight was that, for certain companies, you can predict
the growth with a greater degree of confidence than Graham was willing to
allow.

The difference between Graham and Buffet is that Buffet was never a cigar butt
trader. Indeed his best investments (Geico, Washington Post, Coke) tended to be
superior business, acquired at a reasonable price. As a superior business
Buffet defines a business with a high ROA and with franchise that provided a
level of safety that he could project earnings 10 years out. Tech stocks and
also pharma stocks apparently never fell into this category, because of the
uncertainties involved in their business prospects. It is also interesting to
note that Buffet liked "Goodwill" during the 60's and 70's as a play on
inflation. During these times, the franchises of the companies he invested in
become more valuable because of inflation and the intrinsic growth and such the
"Goodwill" (the intrinsic value of the business minus hard assets) increased.

Growth vs. value,

I agree with Paul on this one. In some sense one can say that all investing is
"value investing" because everyone tries to buy stocks that are "undervalued."
In my mind this definition of value is pretty useless --- it doesn't
differentiate a value stock from any other kind of stock except perhaps that
you think the value stock is going to go up more.

I am not looking for stocks with large PEs, Price/Books, Price/Sales, and good
growth prospects --- what I call growth stocks. I have been a failure in
investing in these types of stocks and don't have a huge interest in seeing
them. Also, statistically it has been proven that these stocks underperform
value stocks over time.

Hence, a growth stock recommendation here or there is fine (or a follow up on a
former value stock), but in general I think they'd be better located on another
board. In other words, I find the standard (and possibly ignorant?) distinction
of growth and value to be a handy distinction and think this board should
remain primarily devoted to value.

Swiss drug giant Novartis (NVS:NYSE ADR - commentary - research) reported a
14.5% increase in fourth-quarter earnings, boosted by double-digit sales
growth.

Novartis said it earned $1.36 billion, or 55 cents a share, compared to $1.19
billion, or 48 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts were expecting 53 cents a
share, according to Thomson First Call.

Group sales, which include pharmaceutical and consumer health sales, were up
21% to $6.7 billion.

For the year, Novartis earned $5.02 billion, or $2.03 a share, vs. $4.7
billion, or $1.88 a share, last year. Analysts had forecast $2.00 a share,
based on First Call estimates. Sales surged 19% to $24.9 billion.

"2003 ended on a strong note as our sales grew dynamically, reaching record
levels for the eighth time in our eight-year history," said Daniel Vasella,
chief executive of Novartis, in a statement. "All of our businesses gained
market share, based on our innovation-focused strategy."

The company said its cardiovascular and oncology products were the "main
drivers" of pharmaceutical sales, up 18% for the year and led, in particular,
by Diovan for heart failure, Gleevac for leukemia, Zometa for bone cancer,
Lotrel for hypertension and Lescol for cholesterol reduction.

Novartis notched 24% sales growth in its consumer health division, fueled by
its generic drug unit, Sandoz, and helped by over-the-counter medicines, CIBA
Vision and medical nutrition.

Looking ahead, the drug manufacturer said it expects high single-digit sales in
local currencies, driven by pharmaceutical sales, seven of which "are forecast
to be blockbusters by 2008."

The company added that it expects research and development investments to
increase disproportionately in 2004, but said earnings should "exceed 2003
levels."

but I don't see too many bearish signs. The market is very speculative right
now. I have been venturing into thinly traded stocks and even OB stocks a
little and the rogue trading going on there is quite incredible, just like
1999/2000. One lesson I have learned is when everybody makes money so easily
there is something wrong with the market and it's better to be very careful.
Unfortunately what is different from 1999/2000 is that there are not too many
value stocks available. In 2000 one could buy Allstate below at 18$ paying 5%
dividend and many others, they were going down because the liquidity was sucked
out of these stocks to speculate in Mo-Mo stocks. Right now I find only very
little of these opportunities and this is why i hold a large cash position.

Spek, the alternative investment interest rate environment has changed a lot
since 2000. I think it is reasonable, normal and indicative of nothing to find
few good dividend stocks.

A major mistake I have made in the last year is to think a given stock's P/E is
high at some point in time, only to find that sequential quarter earnings are
growing by something like 25%, because of the combination of higher sales,
better pricing and leverage on the bottom line.

RADN is an example, where EPS went from 10 cents in Q3 to 15 cents in Q4 on a
4% sales increase over the prior quarter. The annualized quarter P/E suddenly
went from 20 at $8 to 13. My favorite FARO, for Q1 2004, will come close to 20
cents versus 4 cents the year before on a 50% sales increase. Most commentators
on tech stocks don't have a clue on what is happening for many companies, the

Viastem is a patented transport medie for stem cells, bone marrow, etc, that is

its relevance in the current market cannot be understated. with all the concern
about mad cow why would we want to store or transport precious biological
substances in a media that is bovine sera [cow blood] based and risk the
transmission of prions?

its not exactly a one man show -- more like about a 3 or 4 man show.

i hope to see the company make progress with Viastem and with the investing
public. they need to communicate their business model and its potential to
investors. they are totally ignored in the market place - and rightly so since
they do next to nothing when it comes to public relations.

i have seen the stock dip as low as about 11 cents but not often and not many
shares trade at the lows. if you could buy 40k shares at .25 [and i dont think

Good news for CGNX.......CGNX: Court Rules in Company's Favor in Lemelson
Patent Suit [delayed]
Ridgeland, MS, JAN 26, 2004 (EventX/Knobias.com via COMTEX) --Cognex
Corporation (CGNX) announced that Chief Judge Philip Pro of the US District
Court in Las Vegas has ruled in favor of CGNX in its lawsuit against the
Lemelson Medical, Education & Research Foundation, Limited Partnership. Judge
Pro held that the claims of 14 patents asserted by the Lemelson Partnership are
invalid and unenforceable, and not infringed by Cognex. Cognex filed suit
against the Lemelson Partnership in September of 1998, seeking a declaration
that certain patents issued to Mr. Lemelson that purportedly cover machine
vision are invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed by either Cognex or users
of Cognex products.

Interesting list of stocks in current Barron's under "Cheap Thrills".

The Barron's author identifies 22 stocks from among the S&P 500 that have p/e's
about 10 or below, nine from the S&P midcap, and 12 from S&P small cap. Total:
43 stocks.

Not too many cheap stocks left according to the author and the people he
referenced.
------------------
One way to separate value stocks from growth stocks is by p/e where, in
general, value stocks might be expected to have lower p/e's than growth stocks
(sometimes).

If these cheap stocks are or could be value stocks, and this subset (of the S&P
list) represents a substantial number of stocks that are current value
opportunities, then I would've expected that there'd be more discussion here
about more of these stocks and the risks/opportunities in buying any or some of
them now. Although of course, almost all, or maybe all, of the 43 stocks have
been mentioned here at various times previously.

Still, for us old timers here, when I realize that we've seen a couple of posts
again recently from yet more value investors who say they're no longer going to
post their picks here, and I couple that with difficult-to-comprehend stocks
like CGNX (well, I don't see where it's a value stock)that are showing up, or
stocks posted with no supporting rationale for purchase as a value play, it is
disheartening to me to see the direction the thread is moving.

But of course, that's just me. Others will have a different opinion.

Paul, I have not read this article but i have a hard time to come up with
stocks with a PE of less than 10 that I like. I assume there are a bunch of
homebuilders, mortgage lenders and some insurance plays in that group. Amongst
the 3 choices, I would probably try my luck with the insurance stocks.

I don't like the homebuilders even though they have a low PE because the RE
boom has been going on so long and I feel we are close to a top, because the
artificial low interest rates should go up. The same could be true for the
mortgage stocks. Of course the same growlings have been coming from the bear

Bought a starting position in ABC at 56$.
I liked ABC CC much more than MCK. Similar valuation but ABC looks better than
MCK. As I mentioned before the biggest concern is that MCK is initiating a
price war causing margin erosion for all players. But concerns may be
overblown. We basically look at a business that is going to have an expanding
topline of about 13% for the next few years and if earnings move in lockstep,
the stocks are undervalued.

I also think that the increased threat of counterfeited drugs as well the
increased complexity to distribute biological agents offers opportunity for
higher margin business.

Paul and All, no value stocks is not necessarily a bad sign, this is the
typical market cycle. We are at the overvalued phase and value investors should
take some chips off the table.

Most value textbooks say "don't time the market". I have to say that "time the
market in very short term (daytrading)" is almost a sure way to lose money, but
longer terms (couple years) one has to time the market. Warren Buffett is a
long-term market timer, otherwise why sometimes he put all money to stocks and
other times sitting on a lot of cash? He is sitting on over $30B cash now
(rough number).

My model turned bearish Thursday 1/22/04, and I am putting money where my month
is - shorted big position in QQQ at around 38.25, and smaller positions in
individual stocks that I think are significantly overvalued.

I am hoping to pull off a "no drawdown" month if the market correct, or at
least a much lower correction than the market. Time will tell.

Good Luck to all!

I think Warren Buffett's asset allocation cycle (some years in cash some other
years fully loaded in stocks) is the equivalent (or net effect) of long term
market timing - that some years market is overvalued so there is no value stock
to buy, other years market is undervalued so there are a lot of stocks to
deploy the cash.

He evaluate many many stocks in search of bargains - the net effect of him
unable to find any stock to buy means market is overvalued. He claims he
doesn't care about market, but the market itself is the sum of all stocks he is
evaluating, it is the same thing, only that he cares long term, not daily
movement, and all us long term value investors agree. My model does not give
daily signals, not even monthly, it is usually in a year or two that it gives
signal.

I don't know whether BRK (A or B) is a good buy right now or not, so I don't
feel qualified to address that issue.

However, regarding market timing.... It seems to me that he does not do market
timing for the companies and fractions of companies that he buys. But he
certainly does appear to play macro movements to some degree. Witness his
movement into US Bonds a few years ago and his subsequent exit about 18 months
later. Silver comes to mind, as does his recent comments vis-a-vis the falling
US dollar.

So it seems to me has some portion of his investment capital allocated for
deployment in broad sector plays.

It seems as though he's also willing to enter into short-term "pick the money
up off the ground" type moves occasionally. The Mirant debt purchase about a
year ago would strike me as being in that category.

I note:

1. The benefit for the investor of being diversified and only having this stock
as a very small portion of a portfolio. (Although it still hurts a bunch when a
stock drops 7.25 points (as of this minute) on unexpected, bad news.)

2. "They" always say that investing in a consulting business is dangerous
because your assets walk out the door every night. I've had stock positions in
several consulting companies before; this is the first for me where the assets
have walked out and won't return.

3. I would've hoped that with the insider buying at higher levels, the future
looked good to management. They must not have had a clue about morale in this

paul I value these things like a private buyer would. in the case of ntli,
think of it as a mature cable company with "triple play" capabilities. It has a
du-opoly position alongside bskyb in the UK. So I compare its valuation to
mature cable properties in the US like cmcsa and cox. when you do this you'll
discover its significantly undervalued on a price to ebitda and price to fcf
basis. its a stock with two catalysts for value creation over the next 18
months. With global crossing, I see its emergence from BK as an event at the
polar opposite of the telecom bubble. consider the dollars this company has
invested in a modern global communications infrastructure. It has three billion
in recurring revenue and its selling for less than half of that, even counting
its low debt. Yes its not profitable but I think it will be in the future. this
security is TOXIC, nobody will admit to owning it. I guess I just outed

Triple play maybe. However NTLI finances still look bad with 6B$ in debt. I see
that NTLI has grown the topline by 5% and the operating earnings by 10% but
because of debt service they are loosing money. Enterprise Value to EBITDA is
21.63 (according to yahoo) which is higher than Comcast or Cox ( around 17). So
this does not look cheap to me, but what do i know NTLI has moved up
substantially this year and might just continue to do so....

Regarding GLBC I can't tell because I have not been able to look up the balance

Fallope's learning curve could be very important to 'value' investors. My guess
is that a lot of injured stockmarket players learned that the secret to
investing is getting out BEFORE the bubble bursts. And that's what they're
going to try to do in the present market.

I guess that I learned the opposite lesson because my largest position (after
cash) is BRK.b. My cheapest b's (1366) were bought on the day NASQUACK peaked.
I can't bear to part with them, but then again I can't part with those I bought
@2000 last year.

I actually have been rebated cash from brokerage houses, but that's because I'm
cheap, and I pound the table. In any case my commissions are so low that they
are lost in the noise. I've only benefited from analyst pumping and dumping
because it helps move the prices from fair value. I can't complain.

IMHO, the little guy has a great advantage most of the time. I can slowly
accumulate small, thinly traded mispriced stuff that never reaches the radar
screen of the big guys. I've blown off my share of fingers in value traps and
scams, but overall the last 3 years have been very, very profitable.

Don't know about the next 3 years, hence my transition from margin a year ago
to cash now. For the last 4 months my thin gruel has consisted of a few MA's,
cash-outs, CanRoys, and occasional out-of-the-money puts.

So now I'm down to the likes of BRKB, WSC, WPO, MCO, VUL, etc. Most have huge
gains. Why would I want to do anything but buy and hold? I don't need the cash.
I'm happy with the underlying value. When I sell, I tend to not buy back in.
And I don't feel like paying the taxes.

So I shouldn't hold CMX bought in single digits? I should pull the rip cord on
NIAG bought under 2? How 'bout TARR with a cost basis of a few pennies?

Hi, Paul:

I recall you asked a while back about my holding in SGH. About that time, I was
mulling selling it, as the weather in the northeast US was, and had been,
pretty warm. I held off, and, of course, the weather, and temperatures, have
been brutal, the heating degree days having returned to the average, which is
good for Star Gas, and especially for the Senior Subordinated class "H". This
AM, the company reported for the Q ended 12/31, which actually was quite a bit
warmer than normal. IMHO, it was a very good report, especially considering the
weather. A normal distribution was declared for all units, including the "H";
with the colder than normal recent temperatures, the company should be able to
maintain the current "H" distribution at the very least through this year (also
JMHO). There is also some conversion formula for all the "H" units to become
common "U" units after the "H" distributions are the same as the "U"
distributions for a certain period of time - this possibility makes the
speculative appeal of the "H" units more interesting. I'll need to revisit the
actual terms. I'll continue to hold these units.
Also looking to adding to CL, and re-entry into LUV.

Sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2003, totaled $18.7
million, compared to $15.4 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Net
earnings for the quarter increased to $505,000, or $0.10 per diluted share,
compared with net earnings of $221,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the same
period one year ago.

New orders received during the first quarter were $18.0 million, compared to
$18.8 million for the corresponding quarter last year. At the close of the
December 31, 2003, quarter, the Company's backlog was $19.5 million, compared
to $18.6 million at the close of the same period one year ago. Orders from
international customers during the first quarter were strong and totaled
approximately 49% of the total orders for the December 2003 quarter, compared
with 34% for the prior-year quarter.

Order placement from the tobacco sector was up substantially and orders in our
aftermarket business increased nearly 50% over the prior year.

"Sales per Employee $226 " seems very low.

Data from Yahoo:

Revenue 176M/759 employee = Revenue per employee = 302K!!

this looks better!!

Portfolio update - selling CAJ
Canon had quite a run for a stock with this market cap. I want to make sure i
have plenty of dry powder ready once the market correction sets in.

MEDI had quite a run today, missed earnings consensus by 0.01$ and the stock
rebounds 6.7%, that's just the way I like it - expectations are so low that it
does not matter if you miss. I hold all my shares.

Today may have scared some small cap Mo-Mo players. I see that the stocks that
have run of the most during the last month got hit the hardest - this sure must
be the MM's fault :-).

Trimmed a very little GD. GD has been mentioned here and on Buffettology
thread. (OT: Added to EASI in defense sector. EASI is not a value stock, imo.)

Added just a bit to THC. I like the price/sales & price/book numbers.

Added to losing position in NGAS. Stock can be bought now below price/sh in a
recent private placement.

Cut back a little on RNBO, a stock mentioned here a couple of times.

Culled YUM today. Company says it "sees no adverse impact from bird flu". I
like the company management and their aggressive business stance. However, I'd
rather just step aside at this point to see how this avian flu thing develops.
(Company has been discussed here before: Their KFC stores in China have been
very profitable, and are expected to be a significant component of the overall
business.)

ADG. Hoyasaxa, SI search doesn't seem to be working to help value investors:
its history does not go back far enough.

I am seeing many stocks being posted on now by people here and on other threads
(e.g. Dale Baker's) that have previously been discussed here when their shares
were much lower... and when people seemed to ignore these picks. -g-

ADG has been mentioned here several times over the past few years. As far as I
can tell (and I'm no expert), it still remains the cheapest of the defense
sector stocks. It has good p/sales, p/book, and enterprise value/ebitda
numbers, and its management (several ex-generals) seem to be well-versed in the
DOD procurement business. It's a small company - with a stock that reflects
that. The company deals primarily with just a few foreign governments. ADG are
trying to expand beyond artillery shells: whether they have acquired the right
areas of warfare technology or whether they have the management depth required
for success, I do not know.

I'm a long term holder, and I have a full position.
Imo, it's still a buy at under $20/sh. (at which point I consider adding more)

Of course, jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

too funny...

whatever you call it,they're stocks that are worthless if nobody wants to buy
it from you.

you are of course right - BUT the beauty of value investing is that when you
position yourself in a company that DOES begin to succeed and gain
recognition-- oddly, suddenly everyone wants to own it.

Someone who knew something about value - remember:

Benjamin Graham's famous observation that, "In the short run, the market is a
voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine."
