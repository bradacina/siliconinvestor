It looks like BDN will test the lows which occurred in the December 1992 cycle.
Both the BDNpC and BDNpD held up but there was very little volume. The stock
traded lower today with twice the normal volume probably based on the company's
news yesterday of their intention to cut their common dividend payout (with the
possibility of adding a stock dividend).

For a real ride, you could pick up some of the common shares on a lower low
where there is low volume. For those who did that in December of 1992 and sold
in December 1997 were rewarded with a 16 bagger.

George8 - This is the question the market is trying to figure out. If you read
several of the posts on this thread by Grommit and Spekulatis you might get a
better feel for the risk. Just do a search on the value Investing thread for
"BDN" and all of the posts will show up that you can review.

Here are a few.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25428024&srchtxt=bdn

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25432513&srchtxt=bdn

I have focused on buying just the preferred series and am spreading my buys
over a small basket of (hopefully the survivors) of REIT companies. I also have
an exit strategy that provides some hedging (short common or buy Puts) on the
common shares if dividends are terminated and/or common stock dividends are
initiated. It appears that BDN management is considering paying a portion of
their future common dividends with newly issued shares of common stock. This
would dilute the common shares outstanding if they use this strategy for
several dividend cycles.

The positive is that with the Feds recent announcement of QE (Quantitative
Easing) of over $1 Trillion should provide the sector a lower cost of funds
(and more liquidity) for future refinancing and roll over of their LT debt. I
am not too sure how all of this will play out but believe that the preferred
series provide a compelling "value opportunity" at $0.36 on the dollar. I will
continue to be a buyer if new lows are made and the REIT sector doesn't crash
too much further.

The concern investors have with all REITs in general and specifically BDN is
that FFO numbers are going to get worse before they get better. The big
question is how much worse and are we in the the 3rd or 4th inning of reaching
the trough or in the 7th or 8th inning. It's a moving target and from many of
the recent analysts reports it's going to take longer perhaps 12-18 months
before any stabilization of the FFO numbers occur.

Hope that helps.

re BDN. The common is a lottery ticket and even the preferred may be
problematic. I see some of BDN's bonds trading for a 20% yields. Those bonds
are senior to preferreds of course which are also trading at 20% (in the case
of BDN-C). Why anybody would mess with preferreds when the senior bonds are
trading at similar yields is beyond me.

 what happened to moral hazard? Do you really care about moral hazards any more

happened if they had let AIG go and next morning, there is a long long list of
AIG's counterparty exposure with major and minor banks in it from all over the
world where the true amount of exposure is unknown. This might have caused the
financial stampede of our lifetime, I think.

Or maybe not. I would not have wanted to make that call back in September, but

Have you tried to buy any of those BDN bonds?

While BDN senior bonds with a 20% YTM sound attractive, I have often discovered
those posted yields to be inaccurate or not an accurate reflection of the
bond's true pricing.

That display shows some bonds at a 20% ytm, but others at only 13%, 14%, or
even 7%.

If 20% is real though, I'm thinking if buying the bonds and a little common
stock is a better deal than buying the preferreds. Maybe you can get the same
upside, with better downside protection.

RE Bonds - you are correct that the bonds yields are erratic for lightly traded

consistent yield of 13-14% for Kimco bonds. Kimco is a better credit than BDN,
IMO. In my IB simulation account I have done some test trades and found that it
takes a long time to get the ask price, if ever. No real life trades yet, so

I know through Schwab the transaction cost to trade bonds is very high (perhaps
2%-3% total commission in/out). When you have to give that much away in
expenses the yield begins to not look that attractive. You have to trade in
size (ie $50K) and usually split the bid/ask price.

There might be some good buys with the Toxic Asset Plan to be announced next
week.

Toxic Asset Plan Foresees Big Subsidies for Investors

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/21/business/21bank.html?hp

From the article:"...The plan to be announced next week involves three separate
approaches. In one, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will set up
special-purpose investment partnerships and lend about 85 percent of the money
that those partnerships will need to buy up troubled assets that banks want to
sell.

In the second, the Treasury will hire four or five investment management firms,
matching the private money that each of the firms puts up on a
dollar-for-dollar basis with government money.

In the third piece, the Treasury plans to expand lending through the Term
Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, a joint venture with the Federal
Reserve...."
==========================================================

If the Fed sets up something similar to Treasury Direct, you might be able to
buy a share in some of these assets for pennies on the dollar w/ a very low
transaction costs.

The other Bond like asset that is beginning to look attractive again are Tips

BDN - I put a little time into looking at BDN and I do NOT like what I see.

Using my metrics, I much prefer HRP over BDN.

My basic process is simple and stems from my being a small or medium sized
commercial real estate investor, developer and manager. I calculate the Net
Operating Income of the portfolio of properties. I use a 10% cap rate to put a
value on the portfolio. I add something for non-revenue producing assets. I
look at what's left over after the debt.

In BDN's case I come up with a $3.7 billion value in the rental properties,
plus maybe $400mm in other assets. BDN has debt and other liabilities of $3.1
billion. Liabilities as % of assets is 75%. 25% of this debt is due within two
years, and 54% within four years. The very thin layer of preferred is yielding
20%.

Contrast this with HRP. I come up with a $4.9 billion property value at 10% cap
rate. Add $500mm of other hard looking assets for $5.4 billion, against total
liabilities of $3.1mm. Liabilities as % of assets is 57%. Only 10% of this debt
is due within 2 years, and 33% within four years.

Now, HRP does have a much larger preferred stock tranche, at $700mm of par
value. To a large extent, they have preferred where BDN has debt. That $700mm
represents about 13% of asset value. Until last week the preferred was also
yielding 20% but it's down to about 18% now.

From the above I believe that:

The HRP debt is a lot safer than the BDN debt, and the ytm differential (20% vs
14%) supports this.

The HRP preferred is a lot safer than the BDN preferred, but yields are nearly
the same.

The HRP common stock (yielding 15%) is also a lot safer than BDN's common
(yielding 16%), as the HRP preferred does not have the power to throw the
company into default should more damage befall commercial real estate.

Please tell me where this analysis is weak. Criticism is the investor's best
friend.

Hi Peter -

I also like HRP over BDN for the reasons you described. With the company's
announcement of a dividend cut just shows that expected future FFO will
probably get worse so the company is conserving their cash. Marty Whitman likes
their high cash flow coverage levels but they may not look that attractive in
24 months after 15.6% of their leases rollover. Your analysis looks good to me
except your property valuation (always subject to error) may be a bit low and
your total liability number may be too high. See the link to the Hunter Report
below.

Finally, BDN has some property under development where HRP does not. This
further strains BDN's future capital needs.

Below are some recent company events and analysis that might be of interest.

1) I am not sure if your debt analysis included the recent sale of $460 million
of assets in October 2008 which recently closed.

Brandywine Announces Closing of the $412.5 Million Oakland, California
Portfolio Sale and of a $48.8 Million Richmond, Virginia Sale
http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/081008/0441381.html

2) The Third Avenue Real Estate Fund managed by the value investor Martin
Whitman recently acquired a $12.5 million position in 2009 of BDN's senior debt
(Brandywine Operating Partnership 3.875% Convertible Senior Notes putable
October 2011 (“Brandywine Senior Notes”)

( http://www.thirdave.com/ta/documents/sl/shareholderletters-09Q1.pdf )

From their Q1 2009 letter to investors (pg. 12):"...Brandywine’s portfolio is
more than 92% occupied with a diversified tenant base that provides steady cash
flows. Brandywine will likely face deteriorating fundamentals (albeit not as
severe as retail) and, over the next three years, it must address about $1.2
billion of debt maturities. However, the company’s high cash flow coverage,
manageable debt levels, and approximately $4 billion unencumbered asset base,
gives us confidence that Brandywine’s Notes will remain performing. In the
unlikely event of default, the notes should be fully covered in a restructuring
or liquidation....".

3) Insiders were buying shares (totaling 12K shares) between March 5, 2009 -
March 16, 2009 based on the last Yahoo insider report (
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=BDN ). I would like to see 10x this level from
the Directors which would show a higher level of confidence for the company
looking forward.

4) This is from the Citigroup Global Markets Report dated March 6, 2009 that
Spekulatius posted March 7, 2009.

theHunter — Our REIT Industry Comparative Valuation Analysis
http://www.citigroupgeo.com/pdf/SNA31115.pdf

From the article:"...Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN)

BDN Presents at Citi's 2009 Global Property CEO Conference — BDN's CEO, Jerry
Sweeney, commented that the company is committed to delevering its balance
sheet, primarily through asset sales, and the company’s top priority is
securing construction financing for its IRS development in Philadelphia.
Additionally, management outlined Brandywine’s projected sources and uses of
cash. Fundamentals in the company’s core markets have been relatively stable,
but management expects some downward pressure and has been aggressive on
leasing to retain tenants in 2009.

Sources & Uses — The company has $550m of upcoming cash need, including a
December bond maturity ($152m), payoff of secured mortgage $69m, $160m of spend
for its IRS project, and $135m of revenue maintaining capex. Sources include
$180m of asset sales ($300m of unencumbered properties are currently on the
market), mortgage refinancings, and $180m of mortgages ($90m is currently
underway); additionally, the company is looking at JVs on existing assets. The
company is also in the market for a $165m construction facility for the IRS
project (expecting 300-400 bp spreads over LIBOR) and is in talks for
longer-term financing for the facility. The spectrum of potential buyers is
wide given the size and scope of assets ($3m-$50m).

Fundamentals — Brandywine’s markets have been fairly stable, and vacancies have
not increased that much, according to management. The company expects that a
vast majority of tenants who are looking to relocatewill probably stay in
place. BDN’s goal on leasing is to be as aggressive as possible; as a result,
44% of 09 renewals have already been signed.

From the "Hunter Report"
On page 61 of the report they show BDN's CAP rate to be 7.50.

On page 64 of the report it shows BDN has 19.9 % of its LT debt coming due in
the next two years (2009 & 2010), a bit less than your number. They show the
Gross Asset Value of $4,851 million (including assets under development) vs
total debt $2,967 million (61.16% debt/value).

On page 66 of the report they show that 15.3 % (based on total sq ft) of their
leases rollover in 2009. This number seems a bit high when compared to the
other companies in this sector.

They rate BDN as a 2H which is a high risk - Hold. Their target price on the
common is $4.50/share.

Whitman went heavily into REIT Bonds after getting clobbered with the commons.
Now the RE value fund is almost 50% non us RE companies (mostly Asia). Those in
HK particularly tend to have very low leverage (<25%) so they should make it
inb almost any scenario. Whether they can prosper is another question
altogether of course.

Senior Bondholders of REIT's need to know that secured holders or mortgages
will come first in the soupline. Obtaining mortgages for CRE >60% LTV is right

b) separation of CEO and Chairman
c) independent BOD

This would not cost the government anything and maybe it would prevent
embarassing events like the Aig in the future and may curb compensation excess
without any new laws.

re Geithner plan

 If i understand the basics and please correct me if im wrong. the govt will
finance the bulk of the purchases of toxic real estate purchased by third
parties from banks.

Correct. The treasury will provide cheap financing (by leveraging their own
borrowing capacity. Equity in each tranche will be 16% (1/6 leverage) and the
treasury will provide equity alongside private investors. In addition,
investors will have to pay some insurance (I assume it's going to be some
percentage of the total sum per year) to pay for losses beyond the equity.

Seems like a reasonable plan. private equity will provide expertise and some
equity and make sure that the treasury does not overpay. This makes sense since
the treasury does not have the capacity (and probably not the expertise ) to do
the valuation for those assets. Insurance on the assets payed to the treasury
will pay for some of the losses that are going past the equity layer (where the
investors get wiped out). the treasury leverages it's cheap borrowing capacity
and provides relatively cheap financing which ensures that private investors
can pay more than otherwise possible for those assets and still make a profit.

Of course in principle this is nothing than a huge SIV where in the end the
treasury is still on the hook if things go terribly wrong. Also the
construction entices private investors to make binary bets where either the
payout is huge or it's a total bust. The relatively low leverage ratio of 1/6
is supposed to prevent that though.

this from an editorial in Barron's Dale- which pretty much makes my point:

The AIG problem is a result of two administrations' cowardly belief that
bankruptcy for AIG would sound the death knell for the world financial system,
and their timorous refusal to admit that a generation of government subsidies
for credit, especially housing credit, created the problem.

Secrecy is the real problem here: In good times, regulators and investors never
demanded adequate disclosure of financial wizardry as long as the fees and
profits flowed. In bad times, they tried to kid the public to avoid loss of
confidence in government and the banking system.

Bankruptcy would have been far preferable to the current mess, which
justifiably erodes confidence. If officials come out of the darkness and speak
in the light, and if they proclaim the state of banks on the housetops, there
will be plenty of confidence. In order to solve problems, we must properly
identify them. For those who claim that their secret knowledge will keep
confidence intact, there should be no bonus payments and no bailouts.

im not sure that the leverage is really 1/6. because I think the private
investor only puts up 8% of the money. In fact I think this sounds like such a
good deal that I might try this myself.
It seems to me though that there is so much room for fraud and borderline fraud
here that I predict that the taxpayers will lose a ton of money on this. Not
only will the banks take advantage of this but so will contractors, people in
the construction business etc. they can buy properties, renovate them charge
the SUV big bucks for the restoration and then lose money on the sale of the
properties. They may ultimately lose their 8% capital but recoup it many times
over in fees for the contracting work. None the less this should help revive
the economy in a big way but not sure this will do anything to stabalize
housing prices. Should be really good for lawyers and accountants though.

instead of the incompetents being permitted to fail present and future

Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN) CFO Howard Sipzner buys 20,000 Shares
http://www.gurufocus.com/news.php?id=51752

This is his biggest buy since December 4, 2008 when he bought $30K shares at
$4.00/share. A few more buys of this size by Directors and Officers may signal
a good entry point to buy some more of the BDN preferred series shares.

Re: HRPT Properties Trust (HRP)

On Wednesday, May 13, 2009, HRPT Properties Trust (HRP) will hold their BOD
meeting where they will vote "To approve an amendment to their declaration of
trust that would authorize the Board to effect reverse splits of their common
shares..." ,

This will impact the HRPpD convertible preferred stock as it is a convertible
preferred.

From the Proxy:"... proportional adjustments may also be made to other
securities of ours then outstanding which are exercisable for or exchangeable
or convertible into our common shares, such as for example our Series D
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares, in accordance with the terms of those
securities....

In the case of a 2 for one reverse split, the conversion rate will change from
1.9231:1 to 0.9616:1. The $25.00/share liquidation value should remain
unchanged.

I do not think there is any impact on either the preferred C or the preferred B
series as neither series are convertible into common and are not mentioned in
the proxy statement.

The biggest impact will be share dilution if the company uses these new
"reversed shares" to pay the common dividend in the future. I do not anticipate
this occurring.

Therefore, with a reverse split, there may not be any significant advantage (to
the upside) to owning the Series D convertible preferred.

Disclosure: I own a small amount of both the preferred D and preferred B series
and no common shares.

Both the HRP preferred B & C shares continue to look attractive to me at prices
in the low $9 and $8 respectively. I am using these shares as higher risk bond
substitutes in the portfolio. They throw off high income and have an excellent
chance for future appreciation.

Paul, have you looked at VIRC lately? Seems attractive to me. Earnings not hit
too badly. Leverage non-existent. Seems like school furniture ought to have
decent prospects. Price cut in half. Looks like single digit PE and well under
book value, which looks fairly real.

Market value of common stock at $2.50 is under $40 million. Real assets over

operating income was $7 million and EPS was $0.31.

Trades so thinly though - it's difficult to buy.

recent press release:
"Four major elements of our business — balance sheet, order rates, operating
costs and customer relationships — remain gratifyingly stable despite the
recession. In the case of our balance sheet, we ended the year free of bank
debt for the first time in over 20 years. Inventories are more than $10,000,000
lower versus last year. Accounts receivable are comparable with last year and
accounts payable are down proportionately with inventory levels. Our 20-year
relationship with Wells Fargo Bank continues to be strong and although our
seasonal revolver will have the same $65,000,000 peak availability in 2009, we
don’t expect to need all of it unless some unusual opportunities present
themselves.
Order rates are down, but on a year-over-year basis they haven’t deteriorated
appreciably since mid-summer. Shipments for fiscal 2008 were down approximately
7-8% from 2007. Incoming orders for the full year were down approximately 8-9%.
In the fourth quarter, which captures our entire order flow since the economy
entered its serious downturn last October, incoming orders were down 10-11%.
The backlog itself was up approximately 8-9% at year-end.
Operating costs are appropriately matched to current order rates and we do not
anticipate the need for layoffs. We had the foresight early last year to begin
letting natural attrition reduce the size of our workforce" ....

re WGOV the aerospace industry is going through huge slump in 1-2 years. They

Order flows for industrials are down 20-25% on average. this is based on

those orders will come back any time too since there is quite a bit of spare

RBN and EMR are names I'd like to own at the right price. Too late for WGOV

making its money. More review by me is required I guess. Back otoh, it's the

More Deep drilling support companies. DRIL QUIP INC (NYSE:DRQ) & OCEANEERING
INTL INC (NYSE:OII)

These two were recently discussed on CNBC.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DRQ,OII&d=s

DRQ seems the most interesting. They supply the drill heads. They have little
debt and insiders own 23% of the company thus a vested interest to see the
company perform well. PE is around 12. Stock up from it's low but perhaps one
to watch on any sell off. If stock trades back down to $20, it might be a good
value proposition.

OII provides remotely operated vehicles, mobile offshore production systems,
built-to-order specialty hardware, engineering and project management, subsea
intervention services, nondestructive testing and inspection, and manned
diving. This one is up from it's recent lows. They have $4/share LT debt

3/15, 6/15, 9/15 & 12/15... The company has the right, at any time, to defer
dividend payments for up to 40 consecutive quarters without giving rise to an
event of default (but not beyond the maturity date) and up to 20 consecutive
quarters before the alternative payment mechanism takes effect...The Bonds are
unsecured, junior subordinated obligations of the company and will rank junior
to all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the
company."

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Thousands of buildings at U.S. bases in Iraq and
Afghanistan have such poorly installed wiring that American troops face
life-threatening risks, a top inspector for the Army says.
These wires installed in Iraq are some of the most important to ensure safety.
They all need to be replaced.

These wires installed in Iraq are some of the most important to ensure safety.
They all need to be replaced.

"It was horrible -- some of the worst electrical work I've ever seen," said Jim
Childs, a master electrician and the top civilian expert in an Army safety
survey. Childs told CNN that "with the buildings the way they are, we're
playing Russian roulette."

Childs recently returned from Iraq, where he is taking part in a yearlong
review aimed at correcting electrical hazards on U.S. bases. He told CNN that
thousands of buildings in Iraq and Afghanistan are so badly wired that troops
are at serious risk of death or injury.

He said problems are "everywhere" in Iraq, where 18 U.S. troops have died by
electrocution since 2003. All deaths occurred in different circumstances and
different locations, but many happened on U.S. bases being managed by various
military contractors. The Army has has reopened investigations in at least five
cases, according to Pentagon sources.

Of the nearly 30,000 buildings the Army's "Task Force Safe" has examined so
far, Childs said more than half "failed miserably." And 8,527 had such serious
problems that inspectors gave them a "flash" warning, meaning repairs had to be
completed in four hours or the facility evacuated.

He said the majority of those buildings were wired by contractor KBR, based in
Houston, Texas. KBR has faced extensive criticism from Congress over its
performance in the war zone. KBR has defended its performance and argued it was
not to blame for any fatalities.

Military electrocutions became a national issue about a year ago, after the
January 2008 death of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A
decorated member of the Army's Green Berets, Maseth was electrocuted in his
shower at a U.S. base in Baghdad that once served as one of Saddam Hussein's
palaces.

His death was blamed on improper grounding and dangerous wiring on his living
quarters. Soon after that, the Army asked Childs to help create "Task Force
Safe," a team of master electricians assigned to inspect Army posts for
electrical dangers.

Childs said the "large majority" of the buildings the task force examined in
Iraq had been wired by KBR, which he expected would follow American standards.
But the results, he said, were "just horrible."

In one building, "I had them pull a switch out of the wall to look at a switch,
and when they pulled it out of the wall, the wires fell out of it," Childs
said. Thinking that was an exception, "We pulled the one next to it. They fell
off," he said. "It was just very, very poor quality work."
Don't Miss

* Warnings about wiring in Afghanistan
* Shocks came often at U.S. bases, report finds

Much of the work was done by crews from countries beyond Iraq, "with very
little supervision by anybody." And many of the problems involved improperly
grounded systems that allowed plumbing to conduct electricity, which he said
could lead to electric shocks such as the one that killed Maseth.

Childs said service orders on at least two occasions warned of the hazard in
Maseth's quarters, and "two simple electrical 101s" should have been checked
out by electricians.

"A competent electrical contractor and electrician would have gone to that job
site and tried to discover why pipes could have been energized," he said. If
they had been, "then Ryan Maseth would not have been electrocuted, in my
opinion."

Maseth's family is suing KBR. An Army investigator has recommended that his
cause of death be changed to "negligent homicide," accusing the company of
failing to properly supervise or inspect its work. The Army has yet to accept
the recommendation.

KBR has repeatedly said it was not responsible for Maseth's death or for any of
the others and defended its work.

"KBR has worked diligently to address electrical issues when asked," the
company told CNN in a written statement. "What is important to remember is the
challenging environment in which these issues exist.

"The electrical standards in Iraq are nowhere near those of Western or U.S.
standards. Add to this the challenges that exist in a war zone. We have been
and remain committed to fully cooperating with the government on this issue."

But Childs said the majority of buildings on U.S. bases were built and wired by
KBR since the U.S. invasion.

"They installed the housing units, they installed the electrical, they
installed the wiring. They installed it all. And it's wrong," he said. "It's
all put in wrong."

KBR was not alone, however. He said the Army survey found problems with every
contractor whose work it inspected.

Task Force Safe has yet to inspect another 70,000 buildings in Iraq and has
just begun its review of bases in Afghanistan, where contractors have raised
similar concerns. In written answers to questions from CNN, Pentagon spokesman
Chris Isleib said, "We are correcting hazardous conditions every day."

"This is a huge undertaking but absolutely necessary for the life, health and
safety of our service members and civilians," he said. "When we find a defect,
we put in an emergency work order and take action immediately to protect the
people working or living in those facilities."

But Childs told CNN he is surprised more Americans have not been hurt.

"All the potentials are there," he said. "It just hasn't happened.

On another note, what do you think about NRG, the IPP. They are one of the
better managed companies in this space, Even WEB owns a few shares. EXC has a
bid on them but no means to follow through, I think. They have hedged for Y2009

I don't get much of a message when examining NRG. Some pros and cons kinda
offset each other which makes me neutral, not enough to really take a bite
except for perhaps a nimble trade at some point. Estimates are pretty good, but
its been a pretty big laggard given the past 3 weeks. Total debt and
liabilities of almost 18 billion is something of a detraction. with almost 1/4
billion shares out, I think it would take an army of buyers to get this moving
up enough to make it significantly worthwhile for an investment. My guess - if
the rally were to continue, she can make it up to 19-20. Like most stocks, I'm
pretty much looking at everything for trades, not investments. Everything seems
so market dependent as opposed to being individually dependent on fundamentals.

I divested CSIQ, OME, and some ACM this week. On dips, I may go back into
these. ACM does seem promising as do some of these micro cap value stocks.
Until the market can produce signals that are strong enough to warrant long
term holding I'm staying cautious despite opportunity for continued gains this
rally. Bear market rallies tend to be fast, furious, and volatile, but rarely
sustainable. So selling into strength even if early beats selling into
weakness. Market still looks very short term overbought to me.

I'm kinda wondering what the Fed. will do now for act 2? Seems they already
spent alot of ammo via recent announcements. Maybe a change in the mark to
market rules. I don't view reinstatement of the uptick rule as very significant

I also let go of KALU as well as some clunkers in my portfolio. I agree that
the market looks overbought short term, in particular the Nasdaq. I ams
thinking about buying some puts on QQQQ for protection - those puts are pretty
liquid and can be traded without high friction cost.

FYI from NRG's last conference call:

"Of the $595 in repowering investments made during the year, $418 million was
used to fund our Elbow Creek, Sherbino I, Cos Cob and Cedar Bayou 4 projects
all of which are expected to contribute to the company’s earnings in 2009 and
beyond. The $349 million change in cash accounted for over half of the
liquidity build in 2008, which is outlined on slide 17. This together with a
$300 million increase in letter of credit capacity, primarily due to the return
of letters of credit from hedging counterparties migrating from the second lien
programs to the first lien structure drove liquidity to an all time high of
$3.36 billion.

This however, does not include the $760 million deposited with us by our
hedging counterparties, which is available for future cash collateral called by
those counterparties should commodity prices rebound. Including these deposits,
total liquidity available to the company at year-end exceeded $4.1 billion.

Complementing this liquidity position is NRG’s long-term low cost corporate
debt structure with no corporate maturities before 2013. There is no need to
refinance this debt anytime soon, and with the weighted average cost of debt of
approximately 6.6%, the cost of our existing financing is significantly below
any comparable financings that could be done in today’s market even by an
investment grade issuer.

For any new growth oriented project level financing, we did not foresee any
cost disadvantage as these projects, we continue to pursue such as the peaker
projects in Connecticut will tend to be investment grade.

Our 2009 adjusted EBITDA; cash flow and capital allocation guidance is outlined
on slide 18. Considering our hedge position going into 2009, we are able to
maintain our 2009 guidance for adjusted EBITDA at $2.2 billion and cash from
operations at $1.5 billion. As previously disclosed, our guidance also includes
the benefit of various tax strategies, which we expect will bolster cash flows
in 2009 and 2010. While we historically estimated that our cash tax rate in
those years would approach 30%, we now expected to be closer to 10%.

For the year, we anticipate higher maintenance CapEx than in 2008 mainly
attributable to normal planned activities at our baseload facilities in Texas
and higher environmental spend as we complete back-end control projects
primarily at our Dunkirk plant and initiate back in control work at Indian
River.

Repowering investments for 2009 include completion of Cedar Bayou 4, initiation
of the Connecticut peaker projects with our partner United Illuminating and
final payments on one set of GE wind turbines. We will also continue to
aggressively pursue the development of STP 3 and 4. However, we expect this to
be cash neutral to NRG in 2009 as partner contributions and other financing
arrangements fully fund CapEx requirements.

During the year, we also ancipitate repaying $426 million in debt, including a
$197 million mandatory offer to the term loan B lenders in March, and $143
million to settle the CSF II structure in the fourth quarter this year.

Regarding share repurchases, we remain committed to completing the share
repurchases for both our 2008 and 2009 capital allocation programs totaling
$330 million once we are clear to do so. With the company’s sizable liquidity
position and restricted payments basket of approximately $530 million as of the
filing of our 10-K. NRG has more than sufficient capacity to execute on these
commitments.

So as we look forward to the rest of 2009, the prospects for NRG remain solid."

re NRG - i hear you. I think NRG is best of breed but IPP generally speaking
has been a lousy business. If they indeed had such a dependable cash flow they
would pay a dividend. None of the IPP does. Of the hybrids like EIX, SRE, the
dividend is funded from the regulated part only. They all make that very clear.

On another note have you looked at ESRX recently, you owned it at some point?

re FED - I am not sure the FED can really do more. The biggest risk at this
point is not the financial sector which is held on life support using a
dizzying array of machinery by the FED, it is the economy spiraling downward.

For example the recent home sales data for existing homes have been touted a a
recovery. While I agree that more sales are better than a stalemate market, i
see what those home sales are in my neck of woods -deeply discounted
foreclosure sales. Those sales have led to an about 10% drop in the home sales
value based on Zillow and other internet machines (which work based on comps)
in the last 2 month alone. This is throughout town. So now we got a situation
where everybody who bought after Y2002 and afterwards with less than 10% down
us underwater. To illustrate the point, I have a friend who bought here house
in the mod 450K a few years ago that zillows for 250k now. They are decent
credits (I think) but their income is weakening also due to the recession. Of
course refinancing is not possible either so sooner or later all those
mortgages are going to default for one reason or another and yet another
foreclosure sign goes up.

The stats show that as well, since despite then higher sales, the inventory is
up. So anybody who believe that "prime" mortgage in CA from Y2004-2008 are
worth face value is just kidding itself. The worst vintages Y2005-Y2007 are
probably only worth 70c on the $, if that. The loss totals from this mess must
just be staggering and they seem to be getting worse by the day. I cannot see
how this problem is solved without the lenders taking huge adjustments to the
principal. Too late to worry about moral hazards now once the donkey is in the
hole

re NRG -
 why do you think EXC has no means to follow through? It's a stock deal, and
EXC has more than 51% of NRG locked up in tenders.

Debt mostly has a change in control clause so if EXC takes over, they would
have to refinance all the NRG debt, even if they pay in stock. Now the weighted
debt cost would go from 6.6% to 10%. Also EXC is partly a regulated utility so
I expect the regulators to take a sharp look.

Have you looked at Exelon Corp. (EXC), The stock is down more than 10% from
when they announced their offer for NRG in October 2008.

Exelon Corporation Offers to Acquire NRG Energy, Inc. in $6.2 Billion
Transaction
Sun. October 19, 2008; Posted: 11:05 PM
http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1953445/?relatestories=1
From the article:"..."An Exelon-NRG combination would result in a total
enterprise value of approximately $60 billion with a generating capacity of
around 47,000 megawatts, or enough electricity to serve nearly 45 million
homes," said John W. Rowe, Chairman and CEO of Exelon. "This combination would
not only diversify Exelon's generation portfolio geographically, it would also
create immediate earnings and cash flow accretion. We believe a combination of
Exelon and NRG would represent an exceptional value for shareholders of both
companies."

============================================================

If this ridiculous carbon credit program is passed it could result in over $1
Trillion of potential trading credits over the next few years. I believe EXC
earnings would significantly benefit from a hedged carbon trading program. They
operate the cleanest "carbon" free production facilities in the US.

Exelon Corp. (EXC) energy portfolio is concentrated in nuclear energy, with
nuclear energy generation representing almost two thirds of total energy
production. Exelon's nuclear fleet represents 3% of total US energy production.
They also operate very "green" hydroelectric and renewable energy plants.

EXC may be undervalued based on their potential future carbon credits they can
sell into the market since they are the cleanest producer of energy in the US
(primararily derived from their nuclear power plant operations).

Any opinion on EXC based on your NRG analysis? Will the combined company be
worth more together than separately?

EXC sure is going to benefit from the carbon cap and trade but I do not know
excactly how much. Personally the whole IPP sector does not interest me that
much except maybe a special situation like NRG and here is why.

The price that IPP can achieve is largely determined by NG prices, since the NG
peaker plants are the swing producers. But why would I bet on a sector that is
dependent on NG and is regulated and has many other pitfalls if I can bet
directly on the NG sector itself. I'd rather buy a NG producer like EOG or an
integrated company like WMB or a utility like company like SUG or SE or an MLP
with a high dividend yield like ETP, EPD, KMP etc.. Less trouble and at least
as good of a reward, IMO.

I looked at PEP annual report and I am not sure I like to hold it here. Of
course, the 2008 was tough, so the results are OKish taking into account the
economy. However, the stock is rather expensive here. Plus they took on debt to
repurchase stock, which is IMHO almost never a great idea. Most companies who
did this got burned as stock declined further and they could not buy back even
more at even lower prices. IMHO, buying back stock from free cash flow is
great. Taking on debt to buy stock is not. Considering that PEP has almost zero
positive cash flow after cap spending, acquisitions and dividends, and dividend
yield is only about 3.2% here, I am not sure it's a great hold. Will think more
about it.

re MSFT - i sold my MSFT this Thursday and Friday for 18.XX$. Cheap stock and
very nice balance sheet but sooner or later Balmer is going to use to have

I also came to he conclusion that MSFT monopoly may not be that unassailable
any more in few years. This is also based on my own observation - i have for
the first time in my carrier seen that management axed a software (it wasn't an
MSFT application) for cost reason without a clear replacement. This was a yield
management system that was regarded as mission critical a few years ago. No
it's gone and they try to do the same using our ERP system. This encouraged my
few that companies and probably consumers are cutting costs in ways that we
have not seen before. So i can see companies going to something like Openoffice
(which is free) to replace the MS office suite. Probably a huge productivity
drag short term since many old documents are not working quite as they used to
but if you are a government or similar organization, why not if some of your
folks are underutilized anyways.
Anyways, the main reason i sold it is because I do not believe MSFT stock will
outperform.

MSFT - I own it and hold it, but you are mostly right. MSFT has a lot of brand

story. They will chug along with only big risk being some stupid acquisition.
If they don't screw up there, MSFT will be a safe, boring stock. Actually, in
the best case they will pull IBM-like performance, which will be
outperformance.

Short term, MSFT can have volatility, but IMHO it is cheap enough to be rather
stable. I would be very surprised if it dropped to $10 or thereabouts.

For me MSFT is now like PEP, JNJ, BRK, MMM, maybe NKE. Stable supercaps that
may outperform lousy supercaps. Would I expect super results from them? Not
really. But I don't expect 80% drop from here either. Should I hold them? Not

On one hand, they almost always survive since regulators allow the increase in

BKH. I also don't know the key metrics pro analysts use for evaluating
utilities.

Given what I already said, and my observation that BKH is perhaps at a 11 or 12
year low while in that period of time dividends have steadily increased and
stated book value has risen from under 10 to 27, I have to believe the $17
stock is undervalued.

I assess the risks of these comments, this way:

"regulators can screw up". Possible, so far though BKH has been able to work
through what they (BKH) want and what regulators allow. So not a concern to me.
(Maybe it should be, but it isn't -g-)

"coal getting whacked". There's got to be a substitute before coal plants are
shut down - if they ever are. Can't have people without reasonable substitutes.
I don't believe it's there and available to BKH customers. (I could be wrong.)

The big problem/issue for me is that BKH is a diversified "energy company",
part of which is regulated (steady income I presume) and part of which is not.
We have seen these staid/conservative/bureaucratic organizations get greedy or
try to juice company profits and thus their executive bonuses by taking risks
in the unregulated market that they improperly assessed and/or could not
manage. And THAT has brought several to their knees or to the floor (bk). Imo
this company (BKH) is not without risk. They are small and in several energy
businesses. Some of which seem to be related to trading energy, the downfall of
several companies. For me, I'll try to control risk here by only going for a
small position and by diversifying (e.g. MIR-- another also in the unregulated
market). If BKH can just continue their ways, just do okay, I expect with the
8% dividend yield and given time, the company will be a double within four or
five years. I hope.

re MSFT - i can understand why somebody at current prices is attracted to MSFT.
It's cheap, it's got cash and it's got products that almost everybody uses (or
has to use). it's also got unfortunately a major shareholder who is selling
lot's of stock and who will continue to do so. Then there is Balmer who's ego
is larger than the Space needle in Seattle and who is going to buy something
big even though he's got very little so show for his smaller buys so far.

This is not a recipe for outperformance, it may have limited downside but
that's not enough to keep me interested. If i believe the market goes down I
sell my stuff and wait to get in again.
