Fwiw, selling 1/2 of few shares of Lab Corp. still held from 2003.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=lh

I see in Yahoo that Chieftain Capital might still be a major stockholder.
(They are value investors.)

I suspect (and might bet) that shares will again be available under $50. I
figure I can re-enter then. However - whether or not I'm around to catch when
the shares trade below $50, and whether I have the will/courage and funds to
pursue a purchase then - I do not know. (With this tactic, another negative is
that the sale now goes into a long-term cap. gains tax bucket, and a purchase
if made, starts the 12month + one day clock. Result might be, it's not such a
good bet to try to re-buy just for a scalp.)

Price/Book ... Relevance ?? Quite often, on this Message Board, I see reference
to the ratio Price/Book, which then infers something or other. But have the
users of this ratio taken the nature of its data into account ? And if they
did, would they still consider it relevant ?
According to Investopedia "The book value of equity is the value of a company's
assets expressed on the Balance Sheet. This number is defined as the difference
between the book value of assets and the book value of liabilities."
What it should also emphasize is the fact that the book value that is entered
is the value at the time that it is entered, and that’s the way it stays for
ever more. So if Company ‘A’ entered its property as a Fixed Asset in 1970 at
$1 million, then its Balance Sheet in 2005 would still have that Asset at $1
million, even though it may now be worth $10 million on the open market. The
same applies to Long Term Liabilities. Needless to say, Current Assets and
Liabilities are also entered at their current value, but because their time
period is 12 months, the overall values could change more frequently.
If we again consider Company ‘A’ whose Fixed Assets form a MAJOR portion of the
Balance Sheet equation, then the Denominator of the Price/Book equation is not
likely to change that much over time, plus the fact that the value of "Book"
could be based on a very old evaluation which has very little to do with the
current situation. So in an extreme case, Price/Book could very nearly be
written in the form Price/Constant. Which means that the main variable is
"Price" !!
Let’s now consider Company ‘B’, which is in the same sector as Company ‘A’, and
which has the same number of issued shares as ‘A’. But the difference here is
that Company ‘B’s Fixed Assets of property was valued and entered into its
Balance Sheet in 2004, and as a result had a value of $5 million. This
component of Company ‘B’s Book value would now be 5 times larger than Company
‘A’ !! On the other hand, if Company ‘A’ liquidated its Fixed Assets, it could
very well be worth twice the value of Company ‘B’ !!
So with regard to the Price/Book ratio between these companies, would we be
comparing apples with apples ?
On the other hand, one ongoing variable which is entered every 3 months into
the Balance Sheet, as an update to Accumulated Reserves, is the Bottom Line of
the Income Statement, which can be transposed into EPS. And the Current Value
of EPS is more up to date and relevant than an item which may be many years
old.
So wouldn’t it be more relevant to use Price/EPS for comparison purposes, since
this is not affected in the same way as Price/Book would be, considering how
the value of "Book" is determined ?
Even though Yahoo!, or other similar financial information sites, may use
ratios such as Price/Book, does that necessarily mean that they are invaluable
analysis tools ?... Or should one not interrogate the derivation and data on
which these tools are based ?
To quote an extract from my friend, Dr. Karl Posel’s book, "Winning on the
JSE", he stated "Once the word ‘Book’ (so) appears, the question must
inevitably cross the reader’s mind of ‘So what. What are we now to do with this
quantity whose magnitude reflects only the book value of the company’s net
assets ?’ The complete limitations of the use of this concept then are
immediately apparent."
Maybe there are those who have other ideas on the subject ...

I did not do well with net-net CLST.

Net-net value when I bought at $3.19 was $4.30.

11 months later, it's no longer a net-net due to losses or
repositioning/restructuring of the business.

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/051011/datu048.html?.v=24

The ruling reason for my purchase is no longer valid, so I've taken my losses.
Company may yet survive and prosper; I do not know.

Another disappointment is INFO, a below-cash play which keeps dropping in a
value trap as business and cash seem to evaporate. (I've no position in this
one.)

I note these examples as supporting my belief that if one is going to play
net-nets and below-cash stocks, it might be better and safer to buy a small
package of such companies, especially if a person is not able to winnow
possibilities through superior knowledge of business prospects or superior dd.

Price to book also becomes distorted [reduced] by stock buybacks which most
investors consider a good thing. Despite it's short comings P/B is usually a
decent value proxy when screening for low price stocks and is consider an
important measure of the relative value of financial stocks...where the
underlying assets are often a bit of a black box.
Most ratio's that are good screening or 1st cut analysis have

Adjust book value by adding back the number of shares multiplied by the current

When one looks at Mr. Buffett's acquisitions over the past decade or so, I'd
venture to say (shooting from the hip) that nearly none of them looked "good"

Actually, I have found P/BV to be very useful when screening micro-caps and is

several investments that have doubled using this approach.

Generally speaking, it can also be helpful in approximating a company's
"liquidation" value during times of extreme pessimism.

P/FCF is another good metric to look at. I believe is a superior ratio to use
versus P/E or P/BV because there is less chance for mgt manipulating the

Thanx for the reply Bob. Yes, I'd agree with you that Price/Book Value PER
SHARE would be reduced by share buybacks, which removes shares from
circulation, resulting in a larger denominator and hence a smaller value of the
fraction !
However, I still, personally, question the relevance of Book Value, as this is
surely only related to what is contained within the Net Assets of a company as
they appear in its Balance Sheet. And the value of those assets will be as they
were ORIGINALLY entered into the Balance Sheet and may not have much relevance
to current valuations.

Thanx for the reply gcrispin. I would have a different problem with Book Value
and Goodwill. They may both form part of Net Assets, but the Goodwill entry may
have been processed this year, whereas the major portion of the Book Value
prior to that entry may be, say, 10 years old. Therefore, from the point of
view of calculating a company’s current value, I’d agree that Enterprise Value
would be a better measure, since all the components involved in its calculation
are far more current.
However, the fact that the company paid more for the tangible asset, resulting
in Goodwill, may not necessarily be a bad thing. Since the value of that
tangible asset may be a value, or values, that were recorded many years before
in the purchased company’s Balance Sheet, and may not have that much relevance
in the current market place.
As far as I’m concerned, the important consideration with regards to Book Value
is the principle of the original entry cost into the Balance Sheet, which does
not change with time.

From:Dave
When I said that a P/B ratio is "useless", perhaps the term "useless" is too
strong.

When you poll so-called "value" investors, one of the key metrics they use is
the Price to Book valuation. Yes, in some ways it is important, but there are
many ways to "inflate" book value. As such, that is precisely why Benjamin
Graham liked to purchase his "net-nets" since he defined a "value" stock as one
that sold at a discount to Current Assets minus all Liablities; not Assets -
Liabilities.

In addition to Goodwill and other intangibles on the Balance Sheet, an analyst
also has to wonder about "Other Assets" or the like.

Furthermore, book value is now a moving bar. Liabilities such as Pension and
other healthcare items have the potential to be mis-stated thus inflating (or
deflating) book value. The reason why these items have the potential to be
mis-stated is due to the fact that many assumptions are used to calculate the
items. These assumptions may include the basic discount rate and future rate of
return. Minor adjustments in either assumption can have huge impacts on Book
Value (Shareholder Equity) and, as a result, Price to Book.

Off balance sheet issues definitely have the potential to mis-state book value.
For example, has the company guaranteed the liability held by a third party?
Does the company have an operating lease that it cannot cancel?

As you can tell, I can go on and on.

My basic premise is that since everyone knows that a stock selling below "book
value" is a "value" stock, that metric is no longer of great value in the
current market. Furthermore, even Mr. Buffett who I consider to be the best
"value" investor of our time began shying away from the Price to Book metrice
in the early 70's with his acquisition of See's Candy.

A stock selling near book value may not attract buyers for numerous reasons.

From:bruwin
Thanx Dave for your extensive reply, and to muwis123 for your comments. At the
risk of labouring the point, I’ll just make a few more observations regarding
my opinion of Price to Book Value !
You made mention, Dave, that Ben Graham "defined a 'value' stock as one that
sold at a discount to Current Assets minus all Liabilities; not Assets –
Liabilities."
I suspect reference to those sentiments can be found between pages 212-218 of
his book ‘Security Analysis’. I also suspect CURRENT Assets were used because
they reflected values which were incorporated within the last 12 months and,
therefore, were a lot more relevant than Fixed Assets which could be many years
old.
I also suspect that when investors look at a P/Book value of, say, 1.5 they
assume that the stock is currently selling at a price above that which could be
obtained were the company to be liquidated, so it wouldn’t currently be
regarded as a bargain. However, as I eluded to in my previous messages, that
particular Book Value may be based on a Fixed Asset valuation done many years
ago. If that Fixed Asset formed a major component of the Book Value, and if
that Fixed Asset was now worth 3 times more than the figure originally put into
the Balance Sheet, then that P/Book ratio may now be, say, 0.8 and we’d now
have a stock that would be considered more of a bargain !
I believe this would also cover muwis123’s comment, viz. "The idea of having an
asset valued on the balance sheet at its original cost can be a positive as
well as a negative. If the company bought real estate 10 yrs ago, the value of
that asset is likely to be much higher today."
So if one had many other variations to this theme within the Balance Sheets of
other companies, you surely have to question the relevance of Price/Book Value
as a valuation comparison (it seems "even Mr. Buffett, who shied away from the
Price to Book metric," was of the same opinion !).
As Bob Rudd said in his message 22609, "Most ratio's that are good screening or
1st cut analysis have shortcomings ... they are useful for narrowing the field
of choices but additional analysis is required to get a truer picture."
I’d certainly agree with the reference to "shortcomings" and "additional
analysis is required to get a truer picture." I’m sure most would agree that
there’s "no one cure (or ratio) for all" when it comes to company analysis.
However, I do believe that some ratios are better suited than others for
valuation comparisons. And in my opinion, Price/Earnings per Share is more
relevant than Price/Book Value, since Earnings per Share does, at least,
reflect the LATEST 12 month’s Net Income of ANY company, which should be more
relevant than an extract from Fixed Assets which could be many years old in one
instance, and more up to date in others.

That is a tangential argument. The market, overall, is much more efficient than

If you don't believe me, I'd compare Mr. Buffett's purchase of KO in the 80's
to his purchase of BUD today.

Now, again, regarding the Price to Book Ratio and its relative "uselessness",
I've already given several conditions which can cause Book Value (or
Shareholder Equity) to be mis-stated. Furthermore, since almost everyone knows
about Book Value, it is not a good indicator.

Do you believe the Price/earnings ratio is useless as well? I would think that
measure is even more widely known than P/BV.

BUD is a different story for Buffet, IMO. Just because the stock has
underperformed since he announced his stake in the company, it does not mean he
has gotten it wrong. The Company still has a great brand and a dominant market
share. Its size also makes them more efficient than their competitors. When
Buffet and Munger talked about their purchase, they acknowledged that it would
take a couple of years for BUD to turn itself around. In order to buy a
significant stake they had to buy in earlier than they have in the past.

Well ... if nothing else, the question of the suitability of the Price/Book
Value ratio has raised some interesting comments and observations. Hopefully,
it has also given fellow investors some food for thought.
One of the final observations I’d like to make is related to what constitutes
the make-up of any financial ratio, AS OPPOSED to whether or not the financial
data, that feeds that ratio, can be distorted or manipulated.
Let’s face it, there will always be the risk that the numbers that constitute a
company’s financial statements can be, and unfortunately have been, adversely
tampered with. But that is a separate issue compared to what constitutes the
intrinsic formulation and the mathematics behind a Financial Ratio. In my
opinion, a ratio must be able to stand or fall based on those latter two
aspects. Its efficacy should also not, in my opinion, be negated just because
it may be a very well known ratio. There are many, very well known ratios,
indicators and formulas that have been around for many years, which are just as
viable and effective today as they were when they first saw the light of day.
So, personally, I cannot agree with Dave’s contention that, just because Book
Value is known by just about everyone, that that makes it a poor indicator. In
my opinion, the reasons for its unsuitability go a lot deeper than that,... but
I suspect you’ve heard enough from me on that subject !!!

Well ... whether the denominator of the Price/Book ratio is tangible or
intangible, it doesn’t alter the fact that the value is what it was when
originally entered into the Balance Sheet of Industrial type companies. I don’t
do Banks or Insurance companies, but I see no reason why the principles of
double entry accounting should be any different. Therefore I question the
relevance of this number, especially when one uses this ratio as a measure of
valuation when comparing it to other companies, whose Book entry values may
have been done a lot earlier or a lot later.
In my opinion. Free Cash Flow (FCF) has become something of a "flavour of the
month" value. I’m sure there will be many who will disagree with me, but I
belong to the school that believes that the two important statements you need
to analyse the Financial Statements of a company, are its Income Statement and
Balance Sheet. To the best of my knowledge, anything that you see on the Cash
Flow Statement ends up in, or is part of, those two statements.
I’ve often read that "Free Cash Flow" is somewhat superior to the Income
contents of an Income Statement because it’s "pure cash". Well, any revenue
that a company obtains, be it in "free cash" or in "non-free cash" form, has to
go via the Income Statement. So if the contents of a company’s Financial
Statements are properly checked and Audited, then one should be able to rely on
its contents and what the Bottom Line tells us. And the Bottom Line divided by
the number of shares in issue gives you Earnings per Share (by all means
exclude Extraordinary Items).
So here you have a number that is up to date and reflects the latest Income and
Cost stream of a company.
Therefore, in my opinion, if you now divide it into the current price of a
company, you have a ratio (P/E) to use as a yardstick for comparison purposes,
based on a "level playing field".
I suspect that there are too many investors out there in constant search for
the "Holy Grail" of company analysis and valuation. Of course, that’s their
prerogative. Personally, I prefer to keep it simple.
For those who like to dabble in a bit of mathematical "re-arrangement", one can
take a company’s EPS, DPS and best market interest rate, and calculate, with a
reasonable degree of accuracy, what the current P/E of a company should be.
This can be a useful aid when determining whether or not a company’s P/E is
currently too high. Needless to say, you couldn’t do that with a Price/Book
ratio.

same whether you look at market cap/Equity or price per share to book value per

While buybacks reduce the P/B attractiveness, the improve the ROE
attractiveness by increasing ROE due to lower net equity.

Seems to me if the company borrowed the money for the buybacks, then
shareholder equity section (book value) wouldn't change while the number of
shares would be reduced. So book value/sh. increases. If stock price doesn't
change, then p/bk is lowered. The "good" of a lowered price/bk is offset to
some extent by the "bad" of a higher d/e ratio.

If the company used equity to buy back stock (like use cash already in the till
(current asset account)), then I guess it depends on the particular situation.
If stock is trading below book value, the buyback would increase book value/sh
after the buyback. Maybe not though if the stock were trading much higher than
book value when the buyback occurred.

This logic right? I'm a little foggy this a.m.

Paul,

My opinion on the share buy back using equity depends on the financial status
of company and company situation.

If the company is debt free and very profitable, using buy back and adding some
debt will enhance shareholder value. The cash sitting in company's pocket will
not earn that decent return.

On the other hand, if the company is very leveraged and it uses buy back to
make company into high leveraged play, that is not good. Big NO NO.

Third case would be some technology companies such as Cisco, which issued lots
of options to CEOs and employees. This kind of share buyback is simply pay for
options, which will not add any extra value for shareholders.

Hi Bob, in order to adequately reply to your message, I've copied part of my
own ...
"Yes, I'd agree with you that Price/Book Value PER SHARE would be reduced by
share buybacks, which removes shares from circulation, resulting in a larger
denominator and hence a smaller value of the fraction !"
Maybe the best way to explain what I was getting at is via an example :-
Let's assume a company's Book Value is $1 000 000 and it has 10 000 000 shares
in circulation. Then the Book Value per share is $1000000/10000000 = $1/10 =
$0.10. If the Price of a share is $10, then the Price/Book Value per share is
$10/$0.10 = 100. If 6 000 000 shares are taken out of circulation, we now have
$1000000/4000000 = $1/4 = $0.25. The revised Price/Book Value per share is now
$10/$0.25 = 40.
So the end result is a larger denominator, i.e. $0.25>$0.10, and a smaller
value of the fraction, i.e. 40<100.
In my example I'm assuming share price remains constant while Book Value per
share increases due to buybacks.
However, as far as I'm concerned, the important consideration is the derivation
of Book Value which cannot, in my opinion, give an equitable comparison between
stocks, due to the original entry of its value in the Balance Sheet and the
fact that it remains at that value.
On the other hand, Earnings per Share, especially if Extraordinary Items are
excluded, gives you an up to date value which represents a company's normal
business activities and provides a far more equitable ratio, P/E, to use as a
stock comparison number.

Buybacks and Price/book,

If a stock is selling below book value, buybacks lower the P/B ratio. If the
stock is selling above book value, buybacks increase the P/B ratio.

So you guys never deal with stocks selling below book value???

Anyway, I think Price/Book is useful in certain cases in addition to PE and
cash flow, and I think Graham does too in certain cases based of my readings of
his texts. Do I care if a stock has P/B of 4 versus a P/B of 5. Not really.
That stock is not being valued based off of book value. Do I care if a stock is
selling near book versus, a P/B of 5? Certainly. If you buy a business, isn't
one relevant pricing point (not the end all, but a relevant point), what
someone else paid for the business? And don't Buffet and Graham both recommend
that you look at buying stock like buying a business?

But if you guys think P/B is irrelevant that is fine. It means the stocks I am
interested in one won't be as crowded.

I am too lazy to do a thorough analysis on companies that I know I won't buy.
But here are my guesses:

WWAT - From a brief glance, I assume it is trying to gain sales to achieve
breakeven before its funding (multiple fundings?) runs out. It's possible that
they have genuine technology, but they just can't get to break even. It is
possible that it's just a sham and they don't deliver. This would require more
time to analyze.

TIVO - This one we know to be genuine company. I have no clue why they can't
break even with such a high growth rate, high sales and rather known brand
name. My only guess would be that the pricing is cutthroat, they made some bad
deals with cable/satellite providers to push their sales selling under cost and
that they can't figure out low-cost manufacturing, while DVD recorders with
80GB disks are eating their lunch. Fire the management and it might still have
a chance? I don't know. It's really amazing to see such a well-known company to

For me, I'm just tired of the new people who come here occasionally and post
their correct observation that book value is a historical number subject to
depreciation/manipulation, and then go on to conclude ipso facto that it's not
useful in making stock comparisons or stock buys.

Many value investors use book value. I am looking in front of me at "What has
Worked in Investing" (Tweedy Brown). I suppose I could find the importance of
book value in Dreman books. Been there/done that though in previous responses.

Of course, in some industries - consulting, IT, biotech, etc. - book value is
pretty much irrelevant as a decision tool. In other areas, for me, I have
bought many, many stocks based on current p/bk vs. past p/bk and I have been
satisified with the results.

---------
Now if one is looking for the ONE best indicator, my guess is that it would be
p/e. I can't find the latest (1976) media interviews held with Ben Graham, but
I have part of the AAII (American Assoc. of Individual Investors) 10/'05
article, where the author said Dr Graham was trying to simplify his suggestions
to his readers. The formula I believe, was to buy a large selection (30) of
stocks selling 1/twice AAA bond yield, and sell performers if they appreciated
50%. And of course, there're plenty of studies that reinforce low p/e as a key
valuation metric.

When somebody asked here few years ago what the most important metric was, I
believe ROE was the top contender. That might change now with the easier
calculations for cash flow, ebitda, etc. I will point out that for those of us
who like to see high returns on equity (in addition to other metrics that we
use), that the equity in ROE is the maligned book value.

Steven J. Emmerich. Yes, you are correct about O'Shaughnessy.

I checked before I wrote the post of a few minutes ago. I believe he studied
book value, and I wanted to spell the guy's name right. Glancing at my notes (I
don't have his his 1996 book , only copies of interviews.) , I didn't see where
he mentioned book value at all, so I didn't mention him.

Although now, I see in a Barron's 1996(?) article he is quoted as saying, "The
biggest losing strategy over time is buying last year's 50 biggest losers... If
you want to be a bottom fisher...go for fundamental values like low
price-to-sales, low price-to-book, low price-to-earnings ratio. Don't try to be
a bottom fisher on price."

His definition of a cheap stock: "The company's ratio of price to sales must be
below 1.5".

In one article the tactic was to buy at beginning of the year 50 shares with
the above criterion, also including criteria of: "earnings increase from the
previous year and a sharp gain in stock price." Hold all the picks the entire
year, then redo.

I would need some confirmation on this assumption of mine: O'Shaughnessy would
say his is a risk-adjusted strategy, and that might be quite a bit different
from strategies that don't consider risk in their methods.

Several of O'Shaugnessy funds, based on his screens, failed miserably, and
there have been issues taken with his research approach. And he doesn't have

him as the definitive answer.

I think P/B, PE, P/S, Price/Cash flow, ROE are all potentially useful. Too say
that one of these is basically useless seems rash in my opinion. I tend to look
at Cash Flow, PE, and P/B most right now, but a good P/S with a potential for

I agree with most of what you say here. O'Shaughnessy is not definitive,
doesn't have the overall track record of other value giants, and all of those
value measures have value to value investors. But one fund he started which
most closely used the criteria from his book (combination of low PS with price
momentum called Cornerstone Growth) has a since inception annualized return of
17 % (almost double SP500 and R2000) and has beaten those indices in 6 of 8
years. It's now run by Hennessy Funds:

identify turnaround companies that are still cheap enough for much future
appreciation.

Personally I don’t get "tired" of entering into a constructive debate or
discussion with anybody regarding matters related to company analysis. But
then, that’s just me.
I was encouraged by the feedback and comments that were made by others on this
Board with regard to the subject of P/Bk ratio. I, for one, saw no reason to
consider whether or not they were frequent or infrequent contributors to ‘Value
Investing’.
My initial motivation for broaching the subject of P/Bk was to expose the
derivation and make-up of Book Value. I believe that if one is going to use a
ratio or formula, you should do so on the basis of complete understanding of
what it consists of and thereby be aware of what it is telling you. I suspect
that there are many folk out there who are followers of either Fundamental
Analysis or Technical Analysis, who use ratios or indicators etc.. just because
that’s what a lot of other investors do, and don’t actually interrogate their
intrinsic make-up. Conversely there will be those who are completely aware of
this make-up and are content with their use. Of course, that’s their
prerogative. In my opinion, the ultimate criteria is not whether Tweedy Brown
or Dreman or Joe Soap are regular proponents of a ratio, but whether or not the
integrity of that ratio can stand up to logical scrutiny (let’s not forget that
there was a time when a large majority of folk believed the earth was flat. In
the end logic prevailed !!!).
Needless to say, I would agree with you that P/E is one of the best financial
ratios. However, I wouldn’t suggest that one hangs one’s hat on only one source
of data. I, for one, wouldn’t buy a stock unless it satisfied 6 critical
financial ratios and 4 other criteria, all of which were derived from an Income
Statement and Balance Sheet.
You say that ROE qualified as the top contender after a Board survey. As we
know, that’s a ratio made up from Income Statement Bottom Line and Total Assets
minus Total Liabilities (or Shareholder’s Equity). I wonder what the Board’s
opinion would have been had someone suggested a ratio comprising Profit before
Tax and Capital Employed ?
... And not only is Equity "the maligned Book Value" in ROE, it can also be
equated to Share Capital + Reserves. And Share Capital could very well be a
monetary value that came into existence many years ago when a company sold its
shares to the public. And if the Reserves were next to nothing, because a
company’s Bottom Line gyrated between profits and losses, then the Share
Capital value could predominate and we’d be back to the situation of Book Value
being equal to a very old historical value with not that much current
relevance.

bruwin: What your example misses is that book value doesn't remain constant in
a buy back, it's reduced. If the numerator, market cap [share price], remains
constant and the denominator, book value, declines, the PB ratio rises. The per
share version consists of both numerator and denominator being divided by the
same number, the reduced share count, thus the ratio remains the same. Here's a
pretty decent article on book value that explains book value and it's
limitations: http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2005/commentary05101313.htm
This is an excerpt covering the impact of buybacks:
* A company that has a history of buying back a large number of shares (in
excess of covering dilution from employee stock options) will have a lower book
value. All of the shares bought back go into what is called "treasury stock" at
the full buyback price, and these are subtracted from book value. The original
shares are recorded at par value, which is usually as low as $0.10 to $1.00 per
share. A good example is Inside Value newsletter pick Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:
BUD), which in the past four and a half years bought back 140 million (15%) of
its shares. Book value is just $3 billion, yet the company has almost $15
billion in treasury shares. Without any buybacks the book value would be around
$18 billion. A really good indicator here is that both the P/B and the ROE will
be extraordinarily high. For Anheuser-Busch, P/B is 11.7 and ROE is 75, which
are extraordinarily high and of little use in assessing the value of the
company. To overcome this, we can use a BV adjusted for share buybacks. This
would reduce the P/B to 2.0 and the ROE to around 13.<End quote>

Here's a further, and perhaps clearer explanation from Prof Damodoran who's
written several books on valueing companies:

How do stock buybacks affect price to book ratios?
Stock buybacks reduce the book equity disproportionately. This is because most
firms trade at above book value, and it is the market value of what they buy
back that is taken out of book equity. Consequently, price to book ratios
increase after stock buybacks.

When do price to book ratios and value to book ratios convey the most
information?
Book multiples convey the most information when book value means something.
That is why price to book ratios work well for financial service firms, where
the assets are financial assets and are marked to market. They tend to work
less well for technology firms where the most valuable assets (research assets)
are often off the books.

Well, this is the crux for me: "In my opinion, the ultimate criteria is not
whether Tweedy Brown or Dreman or Joe Soap are regular proponents of a ratio,
but whether or not the integrity of that ratio can stand up to logical
scrutiny"

Does book value stand up to logical scrutiny? OF COURSE NOT. (imo). Does it
have "integrity"? Given what management/accountants could put into that number
(depreciation adjustments, r&d writeoffs, for examples) and its historical
basis - I could see where a case could be made that book value does not have
integrity.

The stock prices of many companies fluctuate, sometimes with the channel moving
upward over time (perhaps due to inflation). I presume we value investors (not
necessarily including growth investors) would like to know where we might buy
such companies near these lows and to get an inkling when these stocks are near
highs. It turns out that often there is a point below which one can be alerted
that the stock is in a buying area - and above which the stock is in a selling
area. That point is the book value/share number. Having bought many,many stocks
this way, I find book value/sh. to be not only important, but significant. That
book value or book value-per share may seem illogical or a decrepit measure
from railroad days - that makes little difference to me or other value
investors who are getting monetary benefits from using it in their buy and sell
or screening decisions.

In past, when people have come on this board to tell us all that book value has
terrible problems as a metric because of its composition or that bv is
pathetically irrelevant (said during the dot.com craze), it has always seemed
to me that these are inexperienced value investors. Posters who were damn sure
of correctness of their opinion though. And yet so wrong.

Book value/share is very relevant. So obvious to me in my day-to-day work.

Well, just my opinion and maybe just my experience.

On the one hand, I am upset with myself for having got sucked into a discussion
where I feel I have to defend the metric (which is not my job), and I'm just
very much wasting my time writing. I doubt that I'll change anyone's opinion.

On the other hand, as somebody mentioned here, if people don't like and don't
use p/bk in their work, that's really okay, because it makes it better
(e.g.eliminates competition) for those of us who do use this metric.

It might not be such a bad idea. ABT is already in the stent business and BSX's
valuation is very attractive.

It'd be a heck of a buyout. To take on BSX, I assume they'd pay more than BSX's
current markt cap of $22B.

(ABT market cap is $58B.)

One of the positives for me about ABT is ABT's diversity. The huge buy of BSX
would focus and concentrate ABT's business. As an ABT investor, it'd force me
to be betting on BSX's success. I'm not sure that's what I want from my ABT
investment. I would expect other ABT holders to feel somewhat similar. ABT
stock could easily drop further if deal is announced. Dang.

I don't really like BSX's valuation all that much- to be honest. I think I
prefer ABT without BSX.

IMO, ABTs valuation is somewhat attractive, but still too high for my tastes. I
will wait.

Sold some OVTI recently and added some XEC. Still have quite a bit of cash and
will have more once I put in my 2005 Roth IRA funds. Not much to buy. :)

Jurgis - What do you think ABT is worth and what price would you be willing to
step in at?

I will relook at ABT if it drops under $33. Note that I am often very
conservative with my buys. I don't have a specific sell target or concrete
number what "ABT is worth". Current price is somewhat attractive from a cursory
evaluation, but not enough for me to spend more time yet.

Best regards

May want to look at CHK, STO, and PCZ. PCZ up $1.60 today. Glad I bought in the
morning before the run up. STO has a target of $30.00. Good luck

There is a number of stocks I bought this year at levels similar to current:
DIIB, LNX (just changed name and ticker from DFS), SXT, XEC. I am not buying
any of them right now, since I already have positions, but I might add if they
drop.

Situations might have changed since my buys, so do your own DD.

CHK is a bit too expensive for me. I will look at STO and PCZ. Where do you get
info on PCZ though? Yahoo does not have anything. SEC only?

I have a moderately large position in IGE - natural resources etf, so I am
overly keen to buy too many oil/energy stocks.

Thanks for suggestions though.

re csbk - Not a bargain relative to many S&L with more earnings power, IMO.
).04$ quarterly earnings are pitiful. I own the new IPO ISBC, which is much
larger and more liquid and did earn 0.08$/share and OSHC which did 0.09$. All
those earnings are diluted , since we count non-issued shares sitting in the
MHC but in relative terms (and considering that all 3 stocks trade at pretty
similar shareprices) CSBK is not a bargain.

CSBK will get the thread's bank analysts' pencils moving again. -g-

It's been one controversial stock here.

The issue (for me) is how many shares should be considered outstanding for this
company? This was discussed somewhat last year as you may recall. One link is
here:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=20898825&srchtxt=csbk

The critical point (for me) is whether "we" are dividing the equity by 14M
shares or 30M shares. Because if by 14M, then current price, now as then, is
below - ah jeez, do I dare bring this up - current stated book value. Because
(sigh), I am with blankmind on these bank stocks ("I've found it nearly
impossible to lose money on stocks that are profitable and trading below book
value") - it's rare and a buying opportunity when bank stocks trade below
stated book value.

Blankmind has said his record is 100% (that's scary); I recall that it is
indeed very, very good. I suspect people may want to be very careful in
challenging his analyses and betting against his conclusions. For me, for a
small position, I'm willing to go WITH blankmind and so I put myself in the
camp of "we" who will bet the correct number to use is $14M.

However, at this time, the stock has dropped from my first buys to slightly
above my final purchases. And even with only a very, very small position I do
not like to see these larger-than-expected short term losses I have. So I
figure now near year-end is a an appropriate time for me to get some pain
relief and take those losses to offset short term gains elsewhere.

Whether or not it is still or was ever a value stock, that I perhaps best leave
to others to determine for themselves. -g-

OT. Fwiw, made the following changes today:

(OT because I'm not claiming all these stocks now or earlier fit value
investing criteria.)

Closed position in EPIQ.

Added to positions in SYMC (I recently received SYMC stock for VRTS in a
buyout), KHDH, and GEPT.

Started exploratory position in AVP.
