Walter Bagehot. re.:UK/Euro stocks.

1. Some Euro/UK stocks seemed to be value stocks when they were previously
mentioned here. I've several. Not so sure I want to discuss them, because I
can't justify them as value stocks at current prices. If someone sees something
of value or of interest with these now, I'll read. Otherwise, I'll continue to
just hold. That'd be such like DEO, EONGY.pk, STO.

2. Some Euro/UK stocks might still be considered value plays, and have been
mentioned here before. People have had a chance to look, review, purchase or
pass, comment. For new people to the thread, it's true they might not have seen
these here or been aware of them. I hold, for example, SVMRF.pk, SBEAF.pk,
PLND, FXEN, MFCAF.pk, EONGY.pk, AER, GSK, FTE, TEF, TKC, various shipping
companies, etc. If someone wants to provide additional information on these,
I'll read. Otherwise, I continue just to hold.

3. Some Euro/UK stocks just don't seem to be value stocks. They should be
discussed elsewhere if the poster himself/herself does not consider them value
stocks. Or if posting here as a mention or a fyi or fwiw, then warn us please
with an OT preface.

Just read a summary of the VIC congress which took place in california in early
May- Of note to me was that Fairholme has taken a large position in GS and that
one of the presenters Eric Sprott recommended 3 small gold stocks, two of which
are owned by companies that I have decent sized positions in. I note that one
presenter was very skeptical about small chinese companies, said that he
thought up to 1/3 of them were fraudulent.

Also saw some analyst talking about proposed settlement of GS with SEC. There
was some rumor that GS was going to settle for $1 billion. He thought there
would be some issue with a judge approving such a settlement as he thought the
most they could be on the hook for under current laws would be $15 million, the
amount of fee income they derived from the transaction. I had not heard this
before and I think it gives yet another perspective on the hit to GS market cap
that its taken.

one presenter was very skeptical about small chinese companies, said that he
thought up to 1/3 of them were fraudulent.

Up to 1/3? Why not 1/2? Why "up to"? Does that mean "from 0 to 1/3" and if so
does that statement have any meaning at all?

I hate the hack jobs who do no DD and just spew whatever comes to their mind.
Whatever can be said about Asensio and his puppets, they at least show some
evidence of work done and an investor can decide whether to believe him or the
company.

So far I have seen maybe 1-2 Chinese companies engage in something that legally
can be called fraud. All the others? Yes, they are mostly young companies. Yes,
mostly they do not follow the established practices of western company attitude
to shareholders. They do secondaries while overcapitalized. They do not
communicate well if at all. Sometimes they mess up their financial reports and
have to restate them. They have insider dealings. They buy superfluous real
estate at possibly high prices. Sometimes their business plans collapse.
Sometimes they hold too much A/R and inventories. They don't smooth out
earnings and revenues like pro companies. Is that all fraud? No. It's actually
totally natural situation with young inexperienced companies in emerging
country. Anyone who has invested for some time in emerging countries would have
seen this many times. Actually, you can even see most of these behaviors in
small-micro caps in US.

Graham would not have invested in Chinese small caps NOT because they are
fraudulent, but because they are "young". He advocated investing only into
established companies with a long history of positive results, which naturally
leads to working out all the kinks of young companies. On the converse side, if
one decides to invest into inexperienced companies (whether in China,
Someotherland or in US), one should not be surprised when there are kinks in
the process of growing up (or going out of business). Crying fraud usually just
means that the investor has no will or intention to understand what is going
on.

re Chinese companies -
Barron's had a number where the "1/3 fraudulent" was referenced as well. I
agree that this does not make it true.

I do think it's a little naive to assume that those irregularities that you are
mentioning are all due to inexperience. I have not seen many pharma upstarts
buying convention centers from related parties (AOB). Also for unsophisticated
players they have set up nice legal structures (3 layers of holding companies,
US, Cayman, Hongkong) that will make it very hard to enforce liabilities should
any bad thing happen to shareholders. Then there are issues with double books (
a menace in China) where the Chinese tax books don't match the us books
(according to shortsellers, we can't substantiate that because none of us
understand the language enough or has the means to look into Chinese tax
records.

I also mentioned the cement company (forgot the ticker) where the owner don't
really own the shares, but a contract with the owners who are running the
enterprise.

These are a lot of yellow and red flags for me. Your mileage may vary. I can
tell you one thing - if there is a panic over the Chinese small cap fraud, you
will be able to get a good and the bad ones at prices you never consider
possible.

Well, real estate deals is a signature of the emerging markets. Practically
everyone and their mother in Eastern Europe went into buying RE when the
economy was booming. I am not saying that it is a great idea, actually I think
that it is a bad idea, but it does not make it fraud. I'm not sure why they
love the RE so much, but they do. Funny thing apparently US "investors" did too
;). They were just a bit more business-savvy :P not to buy the RE within some
other unrelated company.

You realize that most of those were set up from US side, not from the Chinese
side? So perhaps then you should bark on the tree of the "sophisticated" US
acquirers. ;)

There won't be a panic over Chinese small cap fraud. However, when there is a
panic over China - and we are almost there again - you are right we will get
"good and the bad ones at prices you never consider possible". Actually I
already did once in 2009 and looking forward to a repeat.

More serious issue is that if there is a real Chinese depression - yeah, the
one where its economy goes down and not just slows to 4-5% growth - a lot of
these companies will disappear. The positive is that most of them are
overcapitalized, so there is a chance for them to survive. However, they are
built on optimism, so business slowdown can be brutal.

I owned some CHL many years back and I did notice that the Chinese government

back they let them buy many regional wireless carriers fairly cheap, presumable
to grow CHL into a national champion. that seems to have been a good deal for

Hi Paul -

I have my watch list of "hybrid" utilities but am holding to my entry points
based on my valuation criteria (forward PE <11, dividend yield > 5%). This
correction should continue for a few more days IMO but should end as fast as it
started.

I am going to stay patient and stick to my previously set buy points. I
probably will have made my new buys in hours (48-72 hours) rather than days.

I hate to see my idle cash earning .01% while I wait and even my credit union
cash earning 1.15%. The money in these market swings is made on the Buy in
levels. Don't forget to peel off shares when the gain is achieved. No one wants
to own stocks anymore but rather rent them. I am moving more towards this

ALO.PA - infrastructure play. Alstom is a french infrastructure company.
Business lines are power generation (they are larger than GE in this line),
transporation (the famous TGV trains amongst other things) and transmission
(they bought this from Areva for a decent price of 8x EBITDA). Alstom current
earnings are 3.8 Euro and thte stock trades at 37 Euro. Their balance sheet is
in good shape (1.5B$ net cash) and a BBB+ credit rating.

Their outlook near terms seems somewhat subdued - their order book is great but
orders have shrunk during the crisis (no surprise here) and although they are
rebounding the Book-bill is still below 1. This looks very much like ABB but
somewhat cheaper. ABB's margins are higher (13% EBITDA margin compared to
Alstoms 9%) and ABB seems to have a better near term outlook as well (although
their B/B is <1 as well) or maybe they are just more optimistic. I think the
lower Euro will help them to gain business outside Europe (currently ~45%) and
improve margins.

Hi Spekulatius -

Foreign Infrastructure Companies - I am not too bullish on any companies that
are in this sector especially if we go through a double dip recession. Many of
these companies have sold off their recent highs and a case can be made that IF
there is a second round of stimulus AND participate in a sub sector where there
is growing demand then it might be time to nibble at a few shares.

First - There was some discussion that Europe was talking about a new stimulus
program.

Second - Euro has fallen significantly relative to the dollar, so companies
that present bids in "Euros" may have a competitive advantage to win the jobs.

Third - Find companies with large backlog, a low debt profile and is a survivor
in their niche.

Your suggestion for ALO.PA (Alstom) may be a good one and seems to meet much of
this criteria. If we ever get this super train out to bid in CA, they may be
quite competitive in winning their bids. Hope there is not a "Buy American"
provision in the RFP.

The company I have my eye on is Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. (CBI).
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=CBI+Key+Statistics
- They were recently bought by a NV from a private equity company in the
1990's.
- Some of their work is bid in Euros thus can benefit from a weak (falling)
Euro,
- Expertise in designing & building LNG terminals, storage systems and related
infrastructure. Anything NG should benefit from the recent drilling disaster in
the Gulf of Mexico.

- They have exposure to nuclear as they build the containment vessels. Anything
requiring welding expertise they do( ie. LNG tanks, Pipes, refinery etc)

- Backlog is the lowest of the three (FLR, Shaw, CBI) but still greater than 1.
Their margins are good and at current price their forward PE is now around 8!

- Debt profile not very good. Large amount of goodwill from their recent
acquisitions. This may be a deal killer.

The stock could still correct back to $10 if we visit the past lows but I may
nibble at a few more shares on another 15% correction ($15.share-$16.00/share).
I own a small position around $20/share.

Check out all the recent projects they have won since 2000. Go to bottom of
page and view their history.
http://www.cbi.com/about-cbi/history/

The company has grown by consolidating from many smaller U.S. firms. Their are
about 20% the size of FLR and 70% the size of SHAW. I like their niche in the
LNG business.

Finally, I would hedge with a buy/write strategy as their options get very
large premiums (out 6 months > 20%).

Hi Paul -

RE: SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU)

Been thinking about adding to my position. I like the defensive nature of the
grocery business. Reviewing their balance sheet, SVU's debt is still very large
(even after the sale of several stores).

- The company is very profitable and now selling at 7 PE (1/2 the PE of
competitors). Analysts have SVU earning $1.92/share for 2012.
- EBITDA/Debt 3.41 (pretty large but I suppose manageable)
- Operating margins at 3.14% pretty good and reflect their excellent warehouse
& distribution network.

I will maintain my position (Avg cost around $14.00/share) but will pass on
adding new shares. I must stay w/ companies that have a low debt profile in the
current environment. However, w/ their new CEO (recruited from Walmart - Craig
Herkert CEO bought 25K shares at $14.75/share in Jan 2010), the sales of more
stores and their excellent warehouse & distribution infrastructure, SVU seems
to making positive progress.

ltb&h stock where I only hold a few shares. It's just that I added last year at
$49.9, and in this market with bargains or possible bargains abounding, I'd
just as soon not pay more than my last add.)

Hi Jackstraw -

From the stocks you listed, I like ACM 1st & JEC 2nd (based on PE and their
debt profile).
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=JEC,ACM,TLVT&d=s

JEC has the lowest debt profile of the three but ACM's PE is lower. ACM may be
in a better niche sector as their primary services is to the government sector
but w/o any new stimulus funds may see slower growth due to future municipal
budget cuts.

Everything I am adding must be a "value" buy (PE below 12) and must have low
debt (or EBITD/debt<1).

Thanks for the list as I never heard of either ACM or TLVT. TLVT could get
caught up in possible debt issues if Spain runs into problems. That may be
another reason to avoid the stock. I do like the business sectors that TLVT
operate in but their market cap is quite small at $800M.

cwillyg. Yes, position size and max pf % have been discussed here many times.

If you're going to pick individual stocks as well as have mutual funds, of
course you will want to be alert that your mutual funds don't hold large
amounts of your stock picks or maybe stocks in the same sectors as the
individual stocks you are buying: otherwise you might find one day you have
more bet on a specific company or sector than you had believed.

If my portfolio value is $x including cash and funds, I rarely will spend more
than .06x in accumulating a specific stock. The stock might rise to or above
$.06x after I own it though. (I'm not an aggressive rebalancer.)
I keep a portfolio of more than 200 positions spread over about 20 different

Since no concentrated portfolio advocates chimed in ;), I'll be devil's

more). Concentrated portfolio can be great IF

- one does have strong (and correct ;)) convictions about sectors and companies
- one has very strict and narrow stock selection criteria that gives only few
companies as a result. (Note: this does NOT mean that you narrow the criteria
until only "leftovers" are left!!! I.e. if market is overpriced and there are
no cheap stocks of great companies, buying a concentrated portfolio of cheap
stocks in blah companies will lead you to ruin! )
- one takes a long-term, business owner approach to owning stocks like Buffett

- one has ability to objectively, thoroughly and critically evaluate everything

re ALO.PA - I am somewhat sceptical too regarding infrastructure but it looks
like Alstom is well position and while margins are still somewhat low, they
have shown consistent improvement. their backlog is till large (I think it's 27
month worth or work) but it is shrinking, albeit at a slower rate (because
book/bill is improving but still below 1).

What matters is not what a contract is bid in, it matters what currency your
costs are and I bet that Alstoms overhead is mostly in Euro (variable cost
depends on location) so a lower Euro for sure is an advantage. Besides that
ALO.PA has already it's double dip, the shareprice is almost back to march 2009
lows (above 10% above now). I agree that a double dip recession is a
possibility but I don't think that the stimulus has played a huge role for
Alstom's business, i am not aware of any power plans or trains that were build
from stimulus money. Those projects need years from inception to build, so they
would not kick in, even when funded.

I think most stimulus funds were used for smaller projects (smartmeters, some
transmission projects) where money can be spent fast.

re Dividend yield - yes if you translate the dividend in Euro into US$ and the
Euro is falling, the yield will fall too. but that is a very narrow view and
only true for companies that solely operate in European markets.

1) Exporters do much business in US$ denomoniation. Energy and basic material
companies sell their goods in US$, so if anything they will benefit from a fall
in Europe, because their cost will fall to the extend it is in Euro.

2) many European companies are multinationals. Nestle for example does less
than 2% of their revenues in their home country Switzerland. it does not really
matter much how the Swiss Frank is valued, they are truly a worldwide business.
UL for example does 60% of their revenues outside Europe

3) US based exporters be aware. Boeing for example will have a much harder time
to compete with Airbus now. HPQ will have sell in Euros and may not be able to
raise prices there. GE will have to compete with Alstom and ABB in Europe and
the rest of the world. BMW will make much more money in China (due to US$ peg)
and the US.

4) The Euro is still not cheap - it's still higher than at it's inception in
1998 and probably close to fair value. It went as low as 0.85$/Euro in
1999/2000 and I did not hear much howling then. We are at 1.22 $/Euro now.

I'll back up Jurgis on this one - I have just two stocks at the moment, and am

My approach has developed to being:

with Jurgis that it is not simply a case of using the stock screener to narrow
down the list
- Very long-term view (I can't actually remove any cash from one of my pots as

Dan's DD list was certainly helpful - everyone will have their own in some form

Walter Bagehot: Company was ServiceMaster. I followed Mr. Buffett into it late
'70's, early '80's (if memory serves). Added more periodically as performance
(company and stock) improved. Company earned great returns with little capital
expenditures. The company dominated a fragmented market.

Eventually combo of the business not having a sustainable competitive advantage
and poor management decisions (acquisitions, hubris, etc.) led to earnings
losses. Not sure how I ended up by the time I sold: I'll say not so great--
giving up gains as stock fell; and as stock faltered my holding it tied up
capital that could've been employed elsewhere.

Buffett exited too, possibly cutting his position way before me. If Buffett
originally bought partly because he had faith in the key guy who built the
company, well that guy retired and the new ceo and his new team essentially
failed the stockholders. Perhaps Buffett, with his access to management, saw
this quicker than small, outside investors.

I don't follow Imperial Oil anymore. At one time, I believed XOM, the majority
shareholder, might acquire the remaining outstanding shares. That doesn't seem
likely to me now, esp. with Exxon recently having made a big gas acquisition. I

Hi Walter -

RE: An Expanding NG Market (both domestic & worldwide)

My NG energy growth theme is based on all the new NG wells coming online from
the domestic shale drilling ventures currently in process. I expect double
digit growth in NG deliveries through 2020.

LNG is only one of the many by products of the processing. I want exposure to
all the components in the NG processing cycle.
Description of a natural gas processing plant
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_processing

In all cases you require the infrastructure expansion that CBI specializes in
building. There are many other companies that will participate in this growth.
The trick will be finding the undiscovered "value" buys, especially those with
hidden asset "jewels".

One of the immediate needs is the storage and temporary warehousing of the gas.
Salt mines are being converted to store the gas (D and GASS have the largest
storage capacity in the U.S. which is tied into the intrastate pipe lines). For
example, NG gathered from the Marcellus shale fields eventually makes its way
to some type of storage location (above ground tank, converted salt mine)
before being processed for further distribution. Some of this gas is compressed
(LNG) where ships are loaded at one of two different east coast ports (a third
is being built near Maryland) for delivery around the world.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas

"...LNG accounted for 7% of the world’s natural gas demand.[4] The global trade
in LNG, which has increased at a rate of 7.4 percent per year over the decade
from 1995 to 2005, is expected to continue to grow substantially during next
years.[5] The projected growth in LNG in the base case is expected to increase
at 6.7 percent per year from 2005 to 2020.[5]..."

Therefore, I think you can make a compelling argument for double digit growth
in NG w/i the U.S. (primarily due from new shale well development). There will
be the need to further build out the NG infrastructure (refineries, storage &
pipelines) to deliver all the NG component products (including LNG)
domestically and around the world.

The value propositions I am looking at are several of the specific
infrastructure projects that need to be completed to bring the Marcellus Shale
NG (and other NG shale fields) to market.

The other value opportunity is to identify those companies that own the pipe
line and storage assets (many are financing expansion projects ie.MDU Resources
Group Inc. (MDU)) that will benefit from the increased distribution volume in
the coming years.

Many of these assets can currently be purchased at value prices (PE<12) and
some of these companies have hidden jewels that when integrated into the
growing NG infrastructure become extremely valuable (ie. pipeline easements,
underground NG storage capacity, selected mineral rights, end user customer
base - commercial & residential).

RE: SUNH

My first reaction is that I am not generally attracted to the OpCo/PropCo
splits. Reason is that I have seen PE do it a great deal - successfully for
themselves in a rising market, but to the detriment of the operating businesses
once they have been sold on in some cases. Thus, on the face of it, for
long-term value, I don't approve.

Is there value in this proposal?

On the face of the ratios and the returns on assets and investment, I don't see
much value. Return on equity is high, but so is debt, so that is to be
expected. Shares outstanding are rising - no evidence of a buyback (and
probably not possible given the earnings available for debt paydown, and cash
balance).

Cashflow is poor: half of operating cashflow goes on capex, leaving 30-40m p.a.
for debt paydown. Pretty tricky if debt is $300m.

Looks to me like that have bought growth at a high price 2006-2007 and there is
little margin for safety.

On a macro level, it is spinning off the assets at a low of the cycle. How does
that deliver value exactly, other than expose a healthcare nursing operation
that is surely quite expensive to run?

Further, how does a company really expect to "unlock" value by becoming smaller
after property is sold off?

Open questions as to who funds the capex improvements on the buildings once
they are spun off. I would put money on the REIT doing further dilutive
offerings as the markets rise as well.

Re: DD (DuPont)

I have mulled it on and off for a while now: Q1 results give the impression
that it might be on for a blockbuster year, but we're value investors, so let's
look at the balance sheet rather than hoping for results:

It has loaded up on debt in the past 2 years, partly to maintain dividend and
partly for acquisitions, but net debt is still fairly low (as cash has not yet
been deployed fully on acquisitions) - interest coverage is OK; price to book
is a little high at 4.1 though, and 13.4x P/E. 13.4 x 4.1 = 53.6: double the
22.5 Graham would feel comfortable with.

Share buybacks were a good point 2005-2007: understandable as the shares have
gone nowhere since 2000.

On the Income Statement - revenues have gone nowhere in 5 years (admittedly we
are at a low point now), but I don't see durable earnings power as a result.
1.71 EPS 5-year growth rate. Margins are strong, but return on assets doesn't
show a huge competitive advantage. If I normalise revenues or earnings, I still
don't find a compelling growth or return, and my P/E will still be higher than
the 7 that Graham considered fair for a non-growth business.

Lots of analyst coverage, all plugging the stock as a buy. I don't see a huge
number of insider purchases.

Return on equity is good, but I think you have to have faith in the management
execution of acquisitions to be comfortable with this business.

What do I know that analysts don't? The stock is being pretty fully plugged in
the market as a buy, and I don't think it is unloved, undercovered, or a great
business at a low price.

I'm not going to place a bet on PV units that could grow to have a large market
share: simply put, they are in a very competitive market, and I have seen
technology such as that simply made redundant overnight by newer technologies.
Companies are in a never-ending game in that market: I'd warrant that returns
will keep being eliminated by the competition.

Just my opinion.

I guess the SUNH split up reminded me of the Marriott/Host Marriott split up
years ago, that Joel Greenblatt wrote about in his value investing book.

I was hoping that the sum-of-the-parts would be worth more than the pre-spin
whole. It seems that the real estate is quite valuable, but isn't getting any
credit in the public markets. They said that the REIT would have $145 million
of rental income. Any idea what that would be worth? It seems like it should be

Re: SUNH

Mine is one of many opinions: I have to admit that I have not read Greenblatt's
write-up of Marriott - could you summarise perhaps, if it is relevant?

My counterargument to that analogy would be (with the disclaimer that I don't
know the details of that transaction)

- Marriott is scalable more easily than a nursing home: allowing the real
estate assets to be spun off, and operating more like IHG as a branding /
franchising business unlocks scale benefits and value in the brand
- Is SUNH a scalable brand? I would suggest that most people choose the best
local nursing home that they can, and brand power has little to do with it
(though again, I have no experience of nursing homes)
- Splitting the businesses does not generate any real value: the tail is
wagging the dog.
- The whole of SUNH is being judged on earnings: no greater earnings can be
conjured from somewhere else simply by splitting

However

- Stock splits create nothing of value, but are effective at raising market
valuation by simple nature of the market's psychology.

re SUNH - I like the move. I compare the nursing home business with the hotel
business but you pay a much lower cash flow multiple for it. if you know a
hotel business at 6x EBITDA multiple, then let me know. I think he spinoff will
create value immediately by helping to realize a higher multiple for the rent
side of the business and create more focus for management. I suspect that one
would want to keep shares of the rent side of the business, not the Opco (a. K.
rentslave).

Disclosure: I own a few shares.

SUNH-I hate company management like this. doesnt look like they buy any shares.
they dont have to do. the company awards them and they sell when they feel like
it. seems like sanctioned employee theft to me.

recent buys: NE, E, SNY
Sells NDAQ, CLD

NE buys (my 2nd add at a little more than 30$ today) looks premature with the
moratorium on drilling. As stated earlier, NE makes 22% of their revenues in
the GOM, but i think underutilized rigs in the GOM could pressure dayrates
worldwide.
On the other hand, it is cheap, trading at only 1.05x tangible book, no net
debt and a fairly low earnings multiple. I think they should really jack-up
their dividend just as they do with some of their rigs <g>.

Also like NE. Profitable each year past ten, with many years of high profit
margins. cash/cash-equivalents net out debt, as you say. I'm holding on to my
very losing position in this one.

Added a little yesterday to my losing position in DO. Company has been
profitable eight of past ten years. Numbers okay, but not so good as NE. What I
like is for past couple years they've declared a special dividend each quarter.

http://www.streetinsider.com/Dividends/Diamond+Offshore+%28DO%29+Declares+$1.37
Share+Special+Dividend/5552418.html

Down from last year,it seems like DO total dividend this year might be about
$6. So on a $68 stock, that's about 9%. Should hold, IF Gulf business
continues.

I suspect these two companies will march together, both affected similarly by
events arising from the BP disaster.

This might explain why my two canadian closed funds are selling at such large

NE - It doesn't concern you that President Obama announced a moratorium on new
offshore drilling for six months & stricter guidelines are expected to be put
into place as well, in a move that may raises costs for offshore drilling.

RE: Noble Corp. (NE)

It looks like NE has a total of six rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico.
http://www.noblecorp.com/Fleet/RigSummary.asp?Region_VC=Gulf%20of%20Mexico

According to their 2009 annual report they have a total of 62 mobile drilling
units. Therefore, the Gulf of Mexico represents 10% of their fleet. One drill
rig (operated by Shell) is a deep water drill platform. It looks like the
others operates in shallow water (< 5,000 ft).

NE also generates revenues from contracted service labor which could be
impacted by a U.S. drilling moratorium. The big question is if the rest of the
world will follow U.S.'s lead and adopt a worldwide review of all offshore
drilling platform permits that could lead to a significant slowdown of
business.

Worst case assume all Gulf of Mexico revenue stops for 1 year. That could
represent 10% of NE's annual revenues or about $360M. At a 46% profit margin,
earnings could be impacted by $166M or about $0.65/share (vs $6.27 total
earnings/share for 2009). Their revenue per share would go from $13.95/share to
$12.54/share. Either way, the financial impact from a stoppage of All Gulf of
Mexico activity is not that big and the stock at $28.00/share seems to have
discounted the worst case scenario.

I guess the unanswered question is how reaching will the U.S. moratorium have
on the industry and for how long.

I will nibble on a few shares on a lower low w/ lower Avg daily volume (less
than 4M shares). This may occur if investors throw in the towel and sell the
stock down to the $23/share-$22/share zone.

I currently have exposure by owning HAL and DRYs (w/ their three deep water
drilling platforms). I do not want any more exposure unless I am buying a
survivor at a very deep discount.

Buying NE at current levels will probably workout fine but I am partial to
watching this sell off from the side lines.

NE Noble...I think there's compound risk from a moratorium...first level may be
just 10% revenue loss and a lesser amount of cost savings, so perhaps 20%-30%
lost net margin for awhile...second level impact: overcapacity causes price
pressure and reduced margins...I haven't taken deep dive into how much of their
business is locked in with commitments that offset this risk, but most of that
should be in this week's 8K...with that said, given such little debt, I don't
see much risk if I'm willing to hold for 3-5 years.

I did a preliminary analysis of SUNH breakup.

The big positive is splitting off income to a REIT entity, where income is not
taxed at the corporate level. And it probably does make sense to split the two
parts. Being a landlord and being a care provider really are two quite
different business models. The current financials look okay.

"Prior to the spin-off, Sun anticipates raising additional capital through an
offering of its common stock, and, in connection with the spin-off, each of the
Operating Company and the REIT is expected to enter into new credit facilities.
Proceeds from the equity and debt financings and cash on hand will be used to
repay Sun's outstanding 9.125 percent Senior Subordinated Notes and the
outstanding term loans under Sun's existing credit facility." Negative here is
that they might not be able to retire the debt at a discount. But I suppose
retiring 9% debt is not a bad thing.

From my observations, usually a stock price will be held down before a
secondary, and the time to buy is immediately after it goes through.

Probably a decent buy. Another approach would be to look in after the split. I
suspect that one or the other part will come out of the gate slow, and that
could be a value opportunity there too.

I have it on my watch list for now.

For rigs under contract the driller still get's paid regardless of drilling or
not. After 6 month the company renting the RIG could invoke force majeure and
the contract would be void. (this is what I heard on another site, so can't
vouch for this to be true) My guess is in this case the RIG would be moved
somewhere else and that would have an impact on worldwide dayrates.

So far the changes proposed (more redundancy in BOP etc.) should not impact
drilling economics too much. Also remember that if oil supply falls, crude will
shoot up and that is bullish for the drillers. The crude has to come from
somewhere...

Fwiw, I'm substantially reducing positions in several bond funds I hold where
the current annualized yields now are under about 5.5% (e.g. LSBRX, which had
become one of my largest positions in my biggest ira.) My intent is to free up
monies for individual stock purchases, and to a lesser extent, for additional
purchases of preferred stock or bond etfs (e.g HYG) where yields are closer to
9% than 5.5%.
