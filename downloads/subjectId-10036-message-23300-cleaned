Started a position in LLY at $54.90. Yahoo has their forward PE at 17 so at
least some analysts expect this company to start making money. Dividend is 3%.
I hedged the buy by selling some covered calls. The 200 day moving average is
at $54 so my next buy target is around $50. LLY has about $1.47/share free flow
operating cash flow and sufficient cash on the books to cover their long term
debt.

I am looking for more drug companies at "value" prices. Any suggestions from
the group?

I now have established positions in LLY, JNJ, MRK, PFE and BMY. I may add SGP
if it drops below $17.5.

JNJ and HSE ...........
(HSE just one example of many because they already reported earnings)

thanks. when one undiversifies, choosing the right sector can be more important
than the stock. that's why i've been pretty much absent this board for almost a
year. but i've been thinking of selling some oil sands and reentering the value
world. trying to spread out my portfolio now...

but it is still hard to find a more compelling growth and valuation story than
oil sands -- if you believe in higher chinese energy demand and limited world
production capacity.

here's just one example (of many) --
look at Husky vs JNJ:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=HSE.TO
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=JNJ

HSE:
price $CAN71.50
2005 EPS can$4.65 yahoo
2005 EPS can$4.72 press release.

2006 EPS can$6.14 yahoo
2006 EPS can$6.51 CIBC (report 1-11-06)
let's use 2006 EPS of 6.30

2007 EPS can$7.86 CIBC
2006 PE 71.5/6.3 = 11
2006 / 2007 growth = 33% and 25%

JNJ:
price $56.8
2005 EPS $3.49
2006 EPS $3.79
growth 8.6%
PE 2006 = 15.

so HSE with a PE of 11 and 25% or 30% growth is a better buy than JNJ with a PE
of 15 and growth under 10%. now, i haven't look deeply into JNJ, so if I am
missing something, please let me know. But I am not a JNJ buyer at these
prices.

HSE:
For the year 2005, Husky Energy Inc. is pleased to report that net earnings
were up 100 percent to a record of $2.0 billion or $4.72 per share (diluted),
up from $1.0 billion or $2.37 per share (diluted) in 2004. Cash flow from
operations in 2005 was $3.8 billion or $8.93 per share (diluted), compared with
$2.2 billion or $5.18 per share (diluted) in 2004.

sorry for the ranting.

lass uncertainty with JNJ... i don't quite agree. i have no idea if all of JNJ
growth efforts will work out. but i do know that each oil sands company will
sell all the oil they produce. they are spending oodles on capacity expansions.
all the oil will be all be sold. the uncertainty is the price. there will be no
FG inventory. their growth is barrels times price. both are increasing.

and fyi - the CIBC earnings report which i mentioned, has WTI oil at $60 for
2006, $60 for 2007, $55 for 2008. hmmm. it will be higher, i think. but that's
the issue. that is the key question everyone has to ask. and that's why I
reallocated a year ago. a year ago all the anlayst estimates were at $45 oil.
won't be there again.

here is the best link, i check it every day.

and if there is any terrorist oil event, or any other disruption, the upside is
in energy, not JNJ. and even without a disruption, the long term story for oil
prices is up.

same story for coal, as oil sands. BTU, CNX, for example.

What you say is true. Companies that produce commodities always can sell what
they produce straight into bankrupty if price fall below production cost.

Risk for Oil sands
1)Oil price risk
2) Project risk (delays,cost)
3) Environmental ,
4) availability of NG

I agree that this looks like a good business in the current environment going

I have hedged some of my bank stocks by selling some covered calls to lock in
some recent gains. The trading activity in several of the financial stocks
including C, JPM and WM look weak against the general move of the market. It's
possible that new money is going into different sectors than banks.

C has had the biggest correction from it's recent high (in January) and I am
looking at adding to my current position if it trades down to $42. Their
dividend is looking quite attractive now over 4% and the stock is trading with
a PE less than 10. C is quite a value proposition at these levels.

My largest bank stock position is in the regional bank NYB. I continue to add
to this position at current levels.

Once the Fed signals that the current interest rate hikes are done, the
financial sector should attempt another move higher. NYB's earnings should
benefit the most (from the banks I hold) from flat rates.

Do you still like C at current levels?

ROIC. Definition and importance and use of this metric. (Several stocks
previously mentioned here, are profiled.)

Article cross-posted from Harry Lew's thread:

Return On Invested Capital

Five Cheap Companies that Create Value
Wednesday February 8, 6:00 am ET
By Elizabeth Collins

Morningstar.com

My favorite financial ratio is--hands down--return on invested capital, or
ROIC. I think it's 10 times better than return on assets (ROA) or return on
equity (ROE), and net profit margin doesn't even come close. That's because it
single-handedly provides a quantitative answer to the question, "Does this
company have an economic moat?" (The idea of an economic moat refers to how
likely companies are to keep competitors at bay for an extended period.) Given
how great the ROIC metric is, I wish there was a stock screener that would help
me find companies with high ROICs, but unfortunately one doesn't exist. So let
me show you how to calculate ROICs, and then you'll be able to conduct a
sniff-test of a company's economic moat by yourself. I'll also discuss some
companies that are high-ROIC machines and happen to be selling at 5-star
prices. But first let's talk about what exactly ROIC measures, and why it's
superior to all other financial ratios.
ADVERTISEMENT

ROIC is a measure of how much cash a company gets back for each dollar it
invests in its business. You're probably saying, "That sounds so similar to ROA
and ROE, why not just use those, since they're posted on just about every
financial Web site?" I agree that using ROA or ROE would be easier, but in my
book they just don't cut it. First of all, the numerator in both of these
ratios is net income. In many cases a company's net income has nothing to do
with how profitable its operations are. There can be so many things going on
"below the line"--interest income, discontinued operations, minority interest,
and so on--that net income can make companies with unprofitable operations look
profitable, and vice versa.

Further, ROA measures how much net income a company generates for each dollar
of assets on its balance sheet. The problem with using this metric is that
companies can carry a lot of assets that have nothing to do with their
operations, so ROA isn't always an accurate measure of profitability.

ROE looks at how much profit a company makes per dollar of shareholders'
equity. Theoretically ROE is a great metric because it measures how efficiently
a company is using shareholders' money to generate profits--and as investors,
that's something we should care about. But ROE has its limitations, too. By
carrying high debt levels and repurchasing shares, management can increase a
company's financial leverage, and thus its ROE, but too much of either can
produce an unreasonably high ROE that doesn't accurately represent the
company's profitability.

As far as net profit margin goes--which is net income divided by
sales--frankly, I couldn't care less. And since net profit margin doesn't tell
us anything about the balance sheet, you would never know if a company is
posting great margins simply because it's interminably shoveling cash into its
business. That can't go on forever.

So how do we calculate ROIC? For the "return" part of ROIC, we don't use net
income, but rather earnings after taxes but before interest payments. We do
this so that companies won't be penalized for having a lot of debt (and thus
high interest payments). For the "invested capital" part, we take all of the
company's assets, then subtract all current liabilities (those due within a
year) except for short-term debt. Dividing aftertax income by invested capital
gives us ROIC. Here's what it looks like:

1. Aftertax income = (operating income) x (1 - tax rate)
2. Invested capital = total assets - (current liabilities - short-term debt)
3. ROIC = aftertax income / invested capital

The beauty of ROIC is that you can make any adjustments that you think are
necessary. For example, if I think that a company has a lot of cash on its
books that isn't being used for operating purposes; I'll subtract this
"nonoperating cash" from total assets. Or if the company is actually paying a
lot less in cash taxes than what's showing up on the income statement, I'll add
the difference back to the "aftertax income" figure. On the flipside, the fact
that an investor needs to make some judgment calls in calculating ROIC is
probably what's keeping the metric out of stock screeners.

ROIC by itself doesn't tell us much about a company's economic moat. A company
creates value only if its ROIC is higher than its weighted average cost of
capital, or WACC. The WACC measures the required return on the company's debt
and equity, and takes into account the risk of the company's operations and its
use of debt. WACCs typically range between 9% and 12% for large-cap companies,
although there are many exceptions. Companies that have generated ROICs higher
than their WACC for many years running usually have a moat. But a positive
spread between ROIC and WACC alone doesn't justify an economic moat. Investors
also have to think about the qualitative attributes--high barriers to entry,
huge market share, low-cost production, corporate culture, patents, or high
customer switching costs--that create an economic moat around a company's
profits. Here's how you can use ROIC: If you think a company has a great
business model that enjoys an economic moat, check to see if its historical
ROICs are greater than its WACC. If they are, chances are you've found a
company that will continue to generate value for its shareholders.

Now let's look into five companies that are ROIC winners. These companies also
happen to be trading at prices well below our analysts' fair value estimates
here at Morningstar, so we would consider buying these stocks. The stocks
mentioned here had 5-star ratings--or "consider buy" prices--as of Feb. 7,
2005. The star ratings may change daily due to price fluctuations or other
factors.

Strayer Education (NasdaqNM:STRA - News)
Business Risk: Average
Economic Moat: Wide
Strayer--a for-profit post-secondary education company--has generated ROICs
that have averaged 95% since 2001, the year the current management team joined
the company. Stock analyst Kristan Rowland predicts that ROICs will top 110% in
the future. From the Analyst Report: "For-profit education is very profitable,
with wide-moat companies such as Apollo Group (NasdaqNM:APOL - News) and
Strayer generating returns on invested capital north of 90%. We think these
outsized returns are sustainable because of the industry's high barriers to
entry. Top-flight firms such as Strayer possess regional accreditation, which
is difficult to obtain and contributes to their moats. Membership follows a
period of candidacy lasting up to five years, and periodic reviews are required
for continued accreditation. Regional accreditation also helps Strayer attract
students because it is indicative of quality. Furthermore, it allows
institutions to tap into federal student-aid programs, expanding the pool of
students that they can attract."

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ - News)
Business Risk: Below Average
Economic Moat: Wide
Diversified health-care company Johnson & Johnson has posted ROICs of 25%, on
average, during the last five years. Stock analyst Tom D'Amore expects ROICs to
be greater than 30% over the next five years. From the Analyst Report: "We
think Johnson & Johnson is an exemplary wide-moat company--it boasts trusted
brand-name products, world-class R&D and marketing capabilities, and global
scale and reach. A key reason for J&J's success is its decentralized management
structure--the company encourages entrepreneurship among local managers to
stimulate creative new product development. Sales and marketing expertise and
quality manufacturing skills are important distinguishing core competencies. In
addition, the company keeps a careful watch on costs, which shows in the steady
improvement in operating margins."

3M Company (NYSE:MMM - News)
Business Risk: Below Average
Economic Moat: Wide
Manufacturing company 3M has generated 18% ROICs over the last five years, on
average, and stock analyst Scott Burns is forecasting ROICs of over 24% over
the next five years. From the Analyst Report: "Innovation and strong
manufacturing capabilities have long been the trademarks of this company. 3M is
synonymous with research and development and a corporate culture that breeds
innovation. Another of 3M's advantages is its ability to leverage technologies
across different businesses and continuously find new uses for basic
technologies. In addition, 3M fiercely protects its patents and uses its
protected period to perfect its production processes. Combining this production
expertise with the company's global manufacturing base makes it cost
prohibitive for rivals to undercut its prices once items fall off patent."

Fastenal (NasdaqNM:FAST - News)
Business Risk: Below Average
Economic Moat: Narrow
Fastenal supplies customers, including manufacturers and commercial
construction contractors, with 250,000 varieties of threaded fasteners and
265,000 general-purpose maintenance, repair, and operations products. ROICs
have topped 19% on average over the last five years, and stock analyst Matthew
Warren expects returns to exceed 24% over the next five years. From the Analyst
Report: "Fastenal has translated its unique competitive position into decades
of profitable growth. This well-oiled machine continues to turn out new stores
and take share in a highly fragmented market. By offering more than a quarter
million types of fasteners (and a similar variety of maintenance, repair, and
operations--or MRO--products) through its 1,700-plus stores, Fastenal provides
enhanced selection and more convenience than broad-line distributors or
hardware stores. Also, the company's 12 distribution centers and in-house truck
fleet provide a highly efficient path to market, especially for heavy
fasteners, which are expensive to ship via parcel carriers. Fastenal's unique
offering is rewarded with pricing power--an important attribute, given recent
steel price fluctuations."

Sysco (NYSE:SYY - News)
Business Risk: Below Average
Economic Moat: Wide
Sysco--a provider of food-service products--has posted 19% ROICs over the past
five years, and stock analyst Greggory Warren expects this strong performance
to continue. From the Analyst Report: Sysco is the dominant food-service
distributor in North America. The company generates impressive returns in what
has traditionally been a low-margin business, using economies of scale,
investments in technology, and a cadre of marketing associates armed with a
portfolio of its own branded products to cement its position. Sysco exhibits
the very traits we look for in a wide-moat company. Being the market leader in
such a highly fragmented industry allows Sysco to grab share from weaker
competitors and gives it prime access to customers and acquisitions. We believe
part of Sysco's success stems from its unparalleled economies of scale. The
food distribution business has high fixed costs, which means that only
companies capable of spreading those costs over a larger base will generate
above-average returns. Finally, Sysco's investments in technology and in its
distribution network have allowed it to lower its procurement and delivery
costs and cement its position as the low-cost provider in the industry."

Elizabeth Collins has a position in the following securities mentioned above:
APOL.

-----
Fwiw, I disagree with the author about the greater superior benefits of ROIC
compared to other metrics. I'm a fan of ROE, especially when used in
combination with other metrics - what I call quadrant investing. For example,
Greenblatt whose "magic formula" relates return on capital to earnings yield
would be an example of what I'd call quadrant investing (looking for stocks in
the quadrant of high roc and high earnings yield).

I'm also a fan of profit margins. To say: "Sure it measures how efficient a
company is with each dollar of revenues, but that's the money its customers
give it. As an investor, I care about what the company does with investors'
money." unjustly trivializes this metric. My view is it's not the dollars that
"customers give it (to the company) i.e. sales - which is all important of
course - it's how much of those dollars the company gets to keep after
expenses. Sustainable high profit margins just reek of "moat" imo.

Anyway, this may all be irrelevant because it seems to me several of us arrive
at most of the same stocks that she mentioned with our own favorite metrics.

* leverage and risk decreasing
* Diversity

* Earnings stagnating
* inverted yield curve bad for banks
* Executives leaving

I am in the bull camp for now at current valuations. i still hold my MHC S&L
OSHC and ISBC, which i think are still attractively valued. I sold WHI after

Hi Chris, Mr.X’s latest recommendations of undervalued stocks, with his own
comments, include ....

1) NHHC is an illiquid stock, with just 2.3 million shares floated. It provides
home healthcare and staffing services in the Northeast USA. After a modest drop
in growth in 2004, revenues have since been climbing steadily. The company
reported a record first Quarter figure of $26.3mil., which is 9% on a
year-on-year basis.
With a P/E of 16.9 compared to the industry average of 22.1, Mr.X believes NHHC
to be undervalued. The company has no long term debt and more than $17mil. in
cash, with a very strong Current Ratio of 7.6.
NHHC also offers an above average dividend yield of 2.8%.

2) PDII provides a wide range of outsourced services to clients in the
pharmaceutical industry. It’s established relationships with drug companies
such as Bayer, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. The last 2 years have been difficult
for PDII and the stock lost approximately 85% of its value. However, the
company has embarked on a turnaround plan, viz. discontinuing unprofitable
business lines, reducing expenses and focusing its resources on the
pharmaceutical industry. A cash stockpile of $98mil. ($7 per share) is
available for growth initiatives and a possible acquisition.
Its Gross Profit/Enterprise Value stands at a very low 1.0.
The company has done a good job of retaining its clients, having secured a new
contract with Glaxo that should add $70mil. to annual revenue.
Despite recent troubles, PDII has delivered Net Profits in all but one year
since going public in 1998.

Further to the 5 stocks posted in my Message 23070, their latest progress is :-

APFC = 31.5%
PLCE = 23.4%
DTPI = 40.4%
STIZ = 122.3%

 Oh well, capping a crummy week for my stocks . I don't see a crummy week for
the broad market and my portfolios are up, so i guess you must be referring to
your energy & commodity stocks. I bet that the broad market sans energy is up
for the week.

Some of the gassy E&P's get me interested again after the recent pullback.
According to CHK website for example, their reserves are worth 40$/share at 7$
gas, with a sensitivity of 5$/share for a 0.50$ gas price change. If I assume a
normalized gas price of 6$, the reserves would be worth 30$ and for 5$ about
20$. I think with the current oil prices 5$ gas is unlikely but 6$ might be
possible. So from reserve point of view, the downside seems limited. Even if i
assume that the shares would trade at a 20% discount at a 6$ gas price base, i
get a 25$ equity value/CHK share which is not too far from the 29$ where these
shares are trading now. So i am assuming that CHK at 25$ would be pretty
interesting.

My recollection is that the spot gas is a very small part of the market
otherwise i would expect my heating bill next month to be cut in half and that
aint gonna happen. many of the companies put out the average realized price for
the quarter or year. I think $6 is way low. The reason spot is currently so low
is that because of the seasonably warm weather usage is down and there is
relatively little storage available. A blimp in the scheme of things/

You're right on CHK. It won't hit 25. Cramer said on the last dip to wait until

Madharry, the spot matter quite a bit if a NG producer is not hedged. Of course
the future strip matter more from a valuation perspective (and CHK does have
some hedges in place) but the market will those only add for their present
value not in terms of an earnings multiple.

I think the real surprise is that despite Katrina and the production losses, we
have record inventory, and lower draws than expected, even adjusted for the
warmer weather. I think the real aberation were the high prices this winter on
the spot market - now we are going into the low consumption season with very
high inventories, which could mean gas prices around 5$ easily. So i would
expect quite a bit of panic, earnings misses from many gassy E&P, which could
open up nice opportunities for LT investors as the MoMo crowd leaves the energy
playground. FWIW i do believe that 25$ for CHK is in the cards.

In terms of valuation, i tend to run the simple valuation that an gas E&P gets
attractive when the reserves in the ground are valued at around 33% of the
average future strip, which i believe would be 33% of 7$ =2.5$, which is
exactly what CHK reserves are valued at (XEC is around 2.8$).

CHK: I don't see that consistently correct oil/gas price predictions are
necessary to drive the stock price.

That is, as regards "for decades the management have been poor at predicting
oil/gas prices", for me, even if I were to agree with that statement, when I
pull up decades charts of big oil, maybe others too, the stocks do rise over
time regardless of the fluctuation of oil prices or managements' predictions of
what prices were to be.

I look at it this way. CHK management is buying their stock because they
believe they can raise earnings and/or increase assets or sell the entity or
somehow "eventually" get their stock at higher prices than currently. I'm not
buying the stock because I believe or I assume management believes they have
special talents to predict oil/gas prices. To the extent that anything they do
(acquire assets/hedge output, etc.) is based on predictions, yes management
must always make predictions. But because no one apparently can predict oil/gas
prices correctly consistently, that to me is no reason to conclude that CHK
management can't or won't do well for stockholders going forward. The top guys
are betting a lot of money they can, and I'm riding with them.

CHK. My CHK purchases haven't been predicated on the fact or assumption that
CHK has or hasn't good management. I do not know anything of the management
competence. Only about management that key management are buying, buying,
buying and heavily their stock. So I am following.

My opinion about "the oil industry's ability to project future prices and
supplies" is that that ability or inability is irrelevant to me who is buying
stocks in the industry now. Over decades when one looks at the charts, the
trend continues to be higher stock prices for the stocks - regardless, imo,
whether managements were or weren't or are or are not able to "project future
prices and supplies".

Of course that's looking backwards. Whether some of these companies may or may
not be able to replace reserves or continue to do well by their stocks, I do
not know. I bet yes though.

re CHK - there is no questions that CHK's management has excelled in the past
and appears very capable. They are buying their own stocks and CHK as a company
is buying reserves from other entities with debt is a bet on high gas prices,
IMO. Clearly the table (in CHK last presentation on their website) suggest
that, if indeed gas goes to 5$, CHK's reserves are worth about 20$/share and in
that case i don't think that CHK stock would trade where it is right now. If
one looks back at CHk's stock it is quite clear that the company was hurting
pretty bad in 1998 when NG prices were low (2$ and less).

CHK

CHK announced they are 71% hedged on NG for 2006 - at $9.43.
if they sell the rest at today's $7.30, the ave price would be $8.81 in 2006

their presentation showed EPS sensitivity to gas prices.
at $8.50 they project EPS of $3.47.
at $9.00 they project EPS of $3.58.

so at $8.8 NG, we're looking at $3.53 maybe.
at $29 / 3.53 = EPS of 8.2

overhangs that might impact sales. For the rental cars, it is high gasoline
prices, for its travel business it is bird flu and terrorism, and for its
brokerage business, it is the real estate bubble. Things can only get better

About this fellow, Mohnish Pabrai: He seems to be an up-and-comer-- I see he's
a person being frequently asked by the media for his opinions on Buffett or
Buffett-type investments.

He's sort of misspoken or misquoted a little though in this sentence, "'He
(Buffett) has been putting money to work in Scottish Power and stock in
Wal-Mart (WMT.N: Quote, Profile, Research) and Anheuser-Busch (BUD.N: Quote,
Profile, Research),' said Mohnish Pabrai, managing partner of Pabrai Investment
Funds in Irvine, California, which invests $270 million and owns $10 million in
Berkshire shares."

As far as I know from my reading, Mr. Buffett is only buying Pacifcorp from
Scottish Power and is NOT putting money into Scottish Power stock, which might
be inferred from the above quote. I'm holding shares in Scottish Power, so I'm
following the company and have seen nothing to indicate Mr. Buffett is or has

Rather than AFCO you might look at GLW (Corning). They have already had a big
run but are making money and have four different business groups; Display
Technologies, Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, and Life
Sciences.

Their Display Technologies are similar to AFCO's products. The Environmental
group has a next generation diesel catalyst filter that is now being installed
in many European cars and trucks that must meet new EU pollution standards in
2006.

Their telecommunication group lost a lot of money in the dot com bust but
recently have large contracts for their optical cable from Verizon that plans
to build out Fibre to the Home in several test markets.

Nothing too exciting in their Life Sciences segment but they continue to sell
product which is a slow and steady contributor to earnings.

I started buying shares at $12 and rode it down to $5 buying more shares all
the way down. It's hard to add new shares at these levels but I think the
upside potential is quite positive especially when their new revenue hits from
their Environmental Business segment.

About SGA and tv/radio stations. Yes, I have an opinion...don't listen to me.
I've been very wrong on this sector the past couple of years, and am taking my
lumps for it.

As you know, these things don't have bottom line profits or only very little
profits, so p/e's are irrelevant. The stocks trade on cash flows mostly
generated by station advert. revenues. As the entrepreneurs have bought and
sold stations and consolidated the industry over time, there've been multiples
paid for those cash flows. This gives some indication of where value is.
(private market value)

The issue - as I see it anyway - is that there's maybe been a paradigm shift,
because ad revenue is shifting from public radio/tv stations to other media
(cable, satellite radio) to an extent that people aren't so willing to value
the stations as high as they have been valued in past.

Whereas I've bought several public radio stations with a view that valuations
and stock prices will revert to mean as ad revs increase over time, it surely
doesn't look to me like this is going to happen, or happen any time soon.

I've averaged down in YBTVA, and sold some last year at loss for tax purposes.
I'll likely sell more if stock remains low for remainder of year. I have SBGI
since 8/04 which I'm holding at near breakeven. I've seen SGA on the lows list,
but given I'm stuck with several losers here already, I've not considered this
one.

I have assumed SGA business & assets are not much different from any other
company's in the sector. But since you mentioned it and I looked at it briefly,
that does not seem to be so, as far as results. SGA is consistently profitable
(has bottom line profits!). With not too bad profit margins. I'll have to look
at SGA closer and consider it.

---------------------
I'm also suffering with SALM. Here I've added some a little while ago as stock
has dropped along with others. I like SALM because it is focused on religious
broadcasting and that is different from all the other radio/tv stocks. I am
hoping the demographics from SALM business are more favorable - preachers (who
buy radio time) and their flocks who are more likely to listen to public radio
broadcasts and more likely to be stable in contributing to their religious
affiliations. OTOH, SALM too, seems to have erratic business results. I can't
decide if it might be because the managers are more religious than
businesslike, or if the management is more self-serving than stockholder
oriented. -g-

Anyway, unless I had a specific and particular reason to buy SGA (I will check
it out), my pick for a buy now would be SALM which I am betting will eventually
(sigh) trade over $20 again (a 50% gain from current price).

SXT. Losing confidence in this one. I've trimmed back position for a small loss
on my first, highest cost, purchase.

Hi Paul - Followed your lead on INTC. At 14x earnings, a small dividend and the
stock near it's 52 week low, this stock looks like a reasonable value at
current prices.

I last owned this stock in the high 20's and sold it in the low 30's. I will
buy more if it breaks down below $20. This is a starter position for me.

I am looking for the stock to rebound back above its 200 day MA of $24.66 and
may sell some of the July $25 calls once the premium moves higher.

There seems to be a groundswell of support on INTC, I would agree. At this
price, I would be inclined to add. I have a very small amount I can buy to
offset a losing position in 30 days, I may do that at this price or lower.

Today, I sold HNZ at 36.70 mid morning, I cleared over two points in a
relatively short time frame, was content with that.

Hi Wallace - I try to establish at least a 10% return on my new investments
even if it is a short term holding. My goal is a 10% return on the total
portfolio (including the losers) per year.

Your HNZ investment was a good "value" buy. I might have tried to lock in a 10%
return by selling covered calls while collecting the 3.3% dividend. A reversion
to the mean may get you $40 on HNZ. My strategy might have been to continue to
hold and sell the Sept $40 calls for $0.95.

However, any profit is a good one. HNZ has had an excellent run in February
from $34. Their PE of just over 17 is not that exciting but that dividend of
3.3% is quite attractive.

Good work on your trade.

Funny you mentioned it, I was looking at some HNZ covered writes, the same ones
you were looking at or the '07 leaps. I have been the "loser" on several
covered writes, if you consider capping your gain while protecting the downside
and putting some $$$ in the bank to be on the wrong side of the trade.

The FCF is intriguing. Several years ago I owned CD, but sold because I grew
tired of the pay structure for management. Too many options and large bonuses
for Henry Silverman, who, today, received a 12 million dollar bonus for 05.

The company is a bit different from the time when I owned shares. The real
estate division with its franchises was considered to be a good bet in a
housing downturn as the independents would franchise for more marketing clout.
Now, in my opinion, their NRT division gives them exposure to the potential
downturn in RE. It looks like Silverman wants to head up the travel businesses.
In my mind, that shows the most growth potential.

OT: Powerball has something to do with value investing?

Well... maybe:

"Feb 18, 2006 (AP)— People with dreams of winning Saturday's record $365
million Powerball lottery jackpot stood in lengthening lines to buy tickets
that flew out of machines at dizzying speeds.

"I figure somebody is going to win it, so it might as well be me," said Casey
Symonds of Omaha, Neb., after buying $25 worth of tickets for himself and four
co-workers Friday.

The chances of winning the jackpot by matching all six numbers were 1 in 146.1
million.

The Powerball jackpot topped the previous lottery record, which was $363
million for the Big Game the forerunner of Mega Millions. That was won by two
ticket holders in Illinois and Michigan in 2000. Powerball's previous record of
$340 million was won by an Oregon family in October."
------------------------

IF it were possible to buy all possible combinations - which I assume from the
article to be 146.1M of them, and IF as in previous lottery record there were
at most ONLY two ticket holders, then for a an investment of $146.1M (I assume
tickets are $1 each??), then you are guaranteed to be a winner and split (with
the other winning ticket) $363M for a return of $181.6 on your purchases of
146.1 million tickets.
A good value bet if it were doable! (And as long as there are not more than two
winning tickets!!)

=======
As I often say, I'm looking for methods that work for most people - average
investors. Seems to me that would be to be on the side of the house rather than
on the side of the gambler. That's how I'm betting anyway. I hold:

OT: Interesting, Paul. I wonder if you bought the 146.1 million tickets if the
lottery officials would pay you if you turned them in and told them, "The
winning ticket is in there somewhere," or if they would make you produce it? If
the latter, I calculate that it could take you up to 4 and a half years to find
it, going through 1 ticket per second, 24 hours per day (or 19.5 years with a
40 hour work week).

Ramblings . . .

Every 3 years I have to put a lot of maintenance work into a rental unit I own
on High St in Denver, CO. This unit is zoned industrial and located 1 block
south of the Union Pacific, UNP, Railroad's Intermodal yard. I do this
maintenance work on the theory that if my wife throws me out, I have a
habitable place to live, and to ensure the place is livable for the renters. By
the way, my plumber substituted disposable vents, for the vents that "vent" to
the atmosphere. When those disposable vents wear out, boy does the house stink.
And the replacements cost $5.46 at the Home Depot. Oh, let me relate these
ramblings to Value Investing before I forget.

When I bought the property in 2002, the UNP Intermodal yard unloaded the
trailers and containers on Mondays only. Now the trailers and containers are
unloaded Monday, Thursday, and Friday. And the yard is so busy the truckers
cannot pull the trailers out quick enough. (Maybe I should have bought vacant
land, and turned it into a parking lot for trailers and containers?)
The point is UNP Intermodal yard is 3 times more busy now.

There are investment ramifications to this activity. In this part of the
country, there is a lack of over-the-road truckers, because many truck drivers
are retiring, the truck companies do not know how to retain the workers,
bankruptcies by a big Denver trucking company, younger workers are not becoming
truck drivers, and so on. In addition, the price of diesel fuel is skyrocketed
in the last year making rail transportation cheaper for heavy cargo that
travels 700 miles are longer. And many of the imports coming into the west
coast that move to the east travel much longer than 700 miles. The UNP is a
combination of the old Southern Pacific, that served Los Angeles, the San
Francisco bay, and the central valley of CA, and the original UNP that served
the west coast north of San Francisco. So, basically the UNP serves the entire
west coast. The UNP's transport of imports from the Pacific and Asia is
enormous, and I am seeing that at the UNP Intermodal Yard in Denver, CO. For
the detectives out there; most of the trailers and containers belong to EMP
(subsidiary of UNP), Yang Ming, Hanjin, Maersk, Seaboard, Nicor (you guys from
Chicago take note), and a few others. There must be somebody who knows how to
make a buck off this information.

I wrote awhile ago that the UNP and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe were
experiencing bottlenecks transporting low sulphur coal from the Powder River
basin of Wyoming and the western slope of Colorado to the markets in the
eastern USA.
See the first link below.

I read in the Billings, MT "Gazette" that the RRs are rolling through their
region in numbers they have not seen since the 1950s. To gain futher
information, I visited the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters
and Waiters here in Denver. Its a beautiful hall, but most of the Porters and
Waiters have passed away. This hall has liquor license #9 for the state of
Colorado, so I got a dose of history and a glass of cold beer.

Also, I read in "Forbes" magazine that the Norfolk Southern is now innovative
and profitable. All this information taken together has convinced me there is a
long term transformation going on in the transportation goods across America.
The RRs are in ascent; the truckers are in eclipse.

Its time to spend some serious time analyzing the RR industry.
Try the second and third links below.

If I am right, it is still early to invest in the RRs. Carl Ichan (sp) has just
bought public a company that builds RR cars. The easterners that read this
board have an advantage here because many of the traditional RR suppliers are
located back east. The Johnstown PA area is thriving now because of the rebirth
of the railcar business. SI poster, richardred, states the old Portec RR
Company, ticker symbol PRPX, is doing alot RR track and rail maintenance work.
Maybe, we can all make some $$$s here.

Good luck investing
