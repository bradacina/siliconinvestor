Independent Boar member proposals: I have a hard time voting no.

Not sure what you mean by above. Proposals for independent board? Yes.
Proposals by shareholders? Mostly yes, but I vote "no" on some "ethical" and
"green" proposals. IMHO, board should not spend time on figuring out if KO is
getting "green" water in Brazil or some such thing.

Excessive executive compensation. I'll vote no for the chairman.

I vote NO for the whole compensation committee and possibly CEO/CFO if they are
on board. All of these people should know better.

Board member owns only very few shares. No no!

Welcome to the thread, Blastedwand. I own a few shares of SNY. SNY has drugs
that come off patent, and some drugs on patent that soon (or later) may be
approved by the appropriate government agencies. I don't see how anyone can
call this stock a "fantastic" value play unless they understand what drugs are
coming off patent, when, how much $ SNY will lose from this, and conversely
what new drugs are going to be sold, when, and what expected revenues will be
got from them. Anything else, imo, is just looking at history and in the
rear-view mirror, expecting the past to be as the future. What I believe I am
seeing is the lack of new blockbuster drugs from any big pharma company being
approved and stimulating the stock price. So we have PFE, LLY, SNY trading at
forward p/e's 7-8. If there's something in SNY's business or pipeline of drugs
that distinguishes it from these other companies, and makes it such a good or
better buy, I do not see it.

Otoh, you have Warren Buffett who has purchased shares of SNY. Maybe he has
some insights somehow to SNY's drugs, although I'd suppose pharma was outside
his circle-of-competence. Maybe he invests by looking in that rear-view mirror.
As regards SNY, that's what I'm doing -- assuming that SNY will continue to
come up with new and important drugs and that the company will at least muddle
through. And that the 4% div. will hold. However, since with SNY I just presume
or guess past=future and that stock will revert somewhat to mean, eventually,
but not necessarily "easily", my conviction is not-so-strong and my shares are
few. There's plenty of risk with this company and stock, the way I look at it.
Jmo of course. (And I've been wrong many, many times.)

"I don't know."

In another note he talks about a margin of safety with the same stock. Strange

I think both BAC and C are both going a lot higher once the dust settles. On
the one hand I agree that it is hard to make heads or tails out of the balance
sheet. on the other hand, unless I think the world is coming to an end (which I
do not), both will emerge as strong if not stronger than before. Is it not only
a matter of time before the government overhang is gone, they start buying back
stock with all the cash they have, and fire up the dividend once again? If the
answer is yes, then most will kick themselves that they did not take a position
when they had the chance. I should state I am long 100,000 shares of C and
20000 shares of BAC. Avg price for C is 3.69 and bac is 10.63.

So, Dr. Ipsofacto, what have you learned or observed from reading all the
recent articles about Mike Burry?

For me it's this:

When you've found something that you believe, and it must be something you
truly believe, and it has a margin-of-safety, bet big, not small, that you are
right.

Affirmation about (value) investing: There are two ways to make money on Wall
Street as regards value investing: Investing itself. (Investing as with a
margin of safety). And maybe even better, entrepreneurship -- putting yourself
out there - giving advice, getting interviewed, starting your own webpage,
publicly tracking your own portfolio, writing, starting your own fund, etc. I'd
say Mike was pretty good about making and justifying and being sometimes right
about his stock picks. That's a big positive if I compare him to somebody like
Whitney Tilson, also an entrepreneur type who seems to me has made his money
entirely from promulgating "value investing", yet is a person whose advice,
investing skills and results remain wanting. (imo)

I talk about entrepreneurship here because Mike's helped himself to get his
reputation, and people are apparently reviewing Mike's past posts to see what
they can learn from him. And there's no question it's fun/interesting to see
how some previously unknown small player came to trounce the professionals and
make a $billion and become "famous" doing it.

As can be seen, Mike did have a terrific and enthusiastic following while he
was posting here. Imo though, and also in the opinion of some others maybe, he
was not "the best" investor on the thread. You could say he was learning and
growing at the time, and eventually he became the best investor of us all. (I
don't believe this. Sour grapes on my part? -g-) Certainly his one famous trade
or value call affirms something significant though.

I'm one who's interested in what works for most people in value investing.
While theoretically any good amateur analyst "could" have seen what Mike saw,
and "could" have done what Mike did even if not to such a large dollar extent,
my guess is that Mike's unique skills/abilities and the unique situation that
he found, are not so apt to be duplicated by anyone, except maybe rarely.

years. It will still take some time to fully clean up the mess but it will get
cleaned and they will rise again. should easily see 20% plus growth per year
over that time. All these banks just got a free pass to work through the mess

GPOR to me looks interesting, even at these prices - though it looks like
you've had shares for a while now.

In my opinion:

Pros

1) Earned $0.55 in 2009 and projected to earn ~$1 in 2010 even with sizeable
hedges of oil at $55-$58.

2) Large oil sands property that some seem to think might be worth more than
the market value of the company today.

3) Low Debt

4) Cash Flow coming to pay the low debt

Cons

1) Oil price could come down, hurting the 4 reasons above.

Is this your take also? Any further thoughts?

Thanks,

Even more discouraging to me, GoodWitchOfTheWest -g-

Your argument here for buying or holding is that noted value people on SI or
people with good track records on SI are buyers (or holders). And why are these
people buyers? Hard for me to get the details because I can't sort on the
letter "C" on SI, but in briefly looking at some "Citi" posts, the reason for
buying seems to be that several professional investors have large stakes and/or
that "loan quality has improved" or something about the price in a trading
range. Or that Mr. Pandit says things will be better going forward.

It's just a little more than what my family members or circle of acquaintances
can argue. Still no stated decent reason for it to be a value buy. No analysis
by SI buyers that I see. As it appears to me on SI, it is just people following
other people following other people.

Could work out very well nevertheless, for both traders or maybe also longer
term holders (five years). And not that I won't take a chance on something
similar (but something more quiet). LYG, for example. I'm calling it a
speculation though, not a value buy.
===========================
I view investing (different from speculating) as a process. If people can't or
won't give a reason for a popular stock that makes any sense to me why they
have concluded and believe the stock is a value, then to me, I move closer to
seeing the buy as being less part of a process and more like an "everybody
says, and I don't want to miss the opportunity (to trade or buy)" kind of
thing. As I say, that makes me want to stay far away.

GPOR. Yes, I agree with your pros and cons. I have held a large position in
GPOR from 2008-2009 where I bought it mostly in $2-4 range (+ small buys in
$10-12 range in 2008). I have sold a lot in $7-12 range, but still have large
position at current prices.

It seems to me pretty expensive here, high P/B, high P/S, not much upside even
assuming return of top earnings in 2007 when their income was about 38M. The
positives are 90% oil skew (vs gas) + oil sands. I would not buy here, but I'll
probably hold my position. Would I buy if I didn't have a position? Probably
not.

Overall, I want to hold oily companies since I think oil price will continue to
remain high and may climb higher. However, the stock prices are pretty high
too, so I am undecided what to do. I have lightened some of my positions (GPOR,
PBEGF, eliminated SU) and moved some money to new ideas, some of which (IACAF)
have run up from my entry, some of which may still be attractive (CLLZF,
COPJF). They are smallish foreign outfits though that may have their own set of
issues. From larger companies, NXY might still be attractive too.

I have also invested in deepwater drillers (RIG, DO, ATW), though I am less
attracted to the sector since its a service sector and because all 3 companies
also have about 50% of commodity shallow water rigs that may be in oversupply.

to be fair sometimes there is not more to contrarian investing. When the dow is
at 6500 and everyone is in a panic I asked myself one question: "is the world
ending?" if the answer is yes than doesn't matter what you invest in. if the
answer is no than you go to work. you look at companies or sectors that have
been unfairly beaten down.

Take insurance for one. Just because AIG was asleep at the wheel did it mean
all other insurance companies were also? How could you compare AFLAC and LNC to
AIG? I do not think you could yet they were getting crushed. Now I looked over
the 10k's and read what I could but I was not going to kill myself trying to
understand every little thing. What I was trying to understand was if it was an
over reaction. It was in the case of LNC and it was in the case of AFLAC. Then
there was GNW. I didn't want to jump in right away because of the direct
exposure to mortgages. If I did I would have owned it at $1. I waited for a few
quarters and listened to the calls. I read through the note and the financial
stuff I could understand. When I decided I felt it was out of the woods I
invested and bought 10k at 6.27.

With BAC I did a similar thing. There is no way anyone of us can understand
there filings or all the junk they load up the reports with. Plus as we know
when they want to hide the crap they can and they will. The only question was
are they going under. If you thought no then you ask the second question. With
the pickup of countrywide and ML what could be the sum of all the parts. Even
of you think they were all 50% over valued at the "TOP" the sum is still over
$50 a share. So that is when I started buying and now sit on 20,000 shares. C
was a slightly different situation. Once it got bailed out everyone looked at
it as a bad thing. I looked at it as a good thing. I now knew it was not going
under and took a position. You are correct I do not know what it is "worth" but
I do know that it is not worth $4 or even $5 or $6. I know in time the
government will be out of both banks, they will buy back stock and they will
once again pay a dividend.

Value investing is many things. There are plenty of stocks in my portfolio that
I have researched in much more detail to come up with the reasons to invest.
These I decided not to over think up front. There will be a time to sit down
and research when they reach a price that I decide based on many factors is too
high like I am now concerned with in GNW. In any event that my two cents.

I do not view my position at "subbornly opposing majority". frankly I didn't
care what anyone thought when I took my positions......

Hi Paul -

RE: Citigroup, Inc. (C)

It is hard for me to value the company because we just do not know what
percentage of their loans are still bad, will these loans get better over time,
what average free flow cash is generated from their on gong business (ie fee,
interest charged etc.) after they have sold off their money generating
divisions and what will the reverse split be.

According to YAHOO the BV of C is $5.35/share (w/ 24.48 Billion shares out!). I
believe this assume that all loans on the books are valued at 100 cents on the
dollar. At Friday's closing price of $4.31 represents 80% of BV or inversely a
20% discount to fair value of assets. If the company is leverage 10:1 on their
capital then I can infer from the current market price of $4.31 that their
basket of all their loans are only valued with a 2% discount.

I believe their loan portfolio s/b valued at least with a 10% discount and
maybe one could even argue a 20% discount is a better conservative estimate. If
you use a 20% discount then the BV s/b less than zero (ie. no value). If you
use a 10% discount, then C should be valued at $0.35/share.

If you add back in the free flow cash generated per share from fees and other
ongoing operations (after the sale of the cash cow divisions) may be as high as
$15Billion. That's equivalent to $0.61/share. At 6x free cash flow that equals
$3.66/share. Add back in $0.35/share from bad loans that might actually turn
out good. I come up with a number of $4.01/share.

This back of the envelope analysis just shows the magnitude of the numbers that
C management can jigger. First 24.8 billion shares is HUGE (24x that of IBM).
This number impacts cash flow per share etc.. 2nd the loan leverage ratio of
10:1 vs 15:1 vs 5:1 impacts the bank's profitability (especially when you start
to actually write down the bad loans). For example every dollar loss at a 10:1
capital leverage ratio is a $10 loss to BV (and to their capital reserves).

I am just happy I held my nose and sold all of my C shares at $19.00/share in
September 2008. I was not so lucky with my WM shares but got $55.00/shares for
50% of my shares on my last sale but still hold the other 50% now valued at
$0.16/share. My cost was around $20.00/share so I broke even.

The moral of this story is that the individual investor has no way to verify
the quality of the loans the bank holds in their portfolio.

I own NYB where they have entered into arrangements with the FDIC where the
FDIC guarantees the payoff of all the loans assumed by NYB from failing banks
(now about $12 Billion). NYB's management has proven that their lending
criteria is sound with less than 1% of their loans that go sour (measured for a
10 year period). It's also a much smaller bank (easier to manage) and not a
mega bank like Citi (many potential land mines that can explode throughout
their world wide operations).

EKS

P.S. I guess a strategy for C is to repackage their retail mortgages and sell
them to FHA or Fannie Mae but I suspect very few of their bad loans can be
hidden in the bundles like in earlier years. The true picture for C is the dust
will take at least another 24-36 months to settle and once 70% of their bad
loans are written off and a better picture of their free flow cash flow is
presented will we know what a reasonable value for the company should be.

For now, I am not touching this one or any of the mega banks. I will stay with
NYB and have them pick up the sour loans for $0.60 on the dollar w/ the FDIC
providing guarantees.

Paul Senior,
What I consider the most important concept I've learned (in my 1 month of value
investing) can be surmised by the following excerpt from The Big Short by
Michael Lewis:

"Burry did not think investing could be reduced to a formula or learned from
any one role model. The more he studied Buffett, the less he thought Buffett
could be copied; indeed, the lesson of Buffett was: To succeed in a spectacular
fashion you had to be spectacularly unusual. “If you are going to be a great
investor, you have to fit the style to who you are,” Burry said. “At one point
I recognized that Warren Buffett, though he had every advantage in learning
from Ben Graham, did not copy Ben Graham, but rather set out on his own path,
and ran money his way, by his rules… I Also immediately internalized the idea
that no such school could teach someone how to be a great investor. If it were
true, it’d be the most popular school in the world, with an impossibly high
tuition. So it must not be true.”

Emphasis on “If you are going to be a great investor, you have to fit the style
to who you are”. I might be reading too much into it but it's almost seems like
an objectivist concept (Ayn Rand). I’m a big fan of objectivism.

Otherwise, I'm really lacking in some fundamental financial concepts that are
probably obvious to someone in the industry or someone with a degree in
finance, business, or accounting. Unfortunately, I have a degree in
Biochemistry and soon a Medical Degree, neither of which help me read a 10K. My
biggest problems come with technical analysis of income statements etc...
Finding the time to learn how to do this is a challenge to say the least.
Filling in the gaps in my knowledge is going to take time. But I'm learning and
having almost too much fun doing it... a good combination.

re C - at 4$/share you are basically acquiring a questionable bank at about
tangible book value. I think that most bad loans are already reflected in the
books, so that is not that much the issue (at least for me). The issue is
earnings power and questionable management - Vikram Pandit has almost no
banking experience and came to C via a hedge fund acquisition (the hedge fund
later folded). C is a Motley Crue of assets, an underperforming US bank
operation and investment bank, some quite valuable international bank and
consumer credit operations. If those pieces were broken up and individually
sold, they should be worth more than book, if the management stays in place
(much more likely, imo) the value that is still there may diminish, because
more able competitors will go after their business.

For me, it's not worth a bet. I can for example buy into GS (if I bet on an
investment bank) for a 25% premium to tangible book and I think it's well worth
it. If I want to buy a bank business, i buy small regional bank stocks, most of
which still go for under tangible book.

Hello Jurgis,

Well, you and I are on the same page regarding oil. To be honest, I'm getting a
bit jittery about the overall market at these levels, and I feel like Oil
companies are a safer bet than other value stocks, given the potential
continued rise of oil prices.

But, I'm running into the same issue you are in that there aren't a lot of easy
picks either in the oil stocks. You can find some cheap valuations, but most of
those companies have issues...

I'll have to think about GPOR. It does look to be volitaile, so if it would

JSB - don't get too attached to BOCH fairly sizable dividend. There is no a
whole lot more shares to serve - i think they will cut the dividend some
because their net interest earnings will not expand much unless they play

I've looked at those promos on occasion, but in general the 3% fee is for a 6
month loan, so annualized it comes to 6% up on the front end of the loan which
makes it near 7% annualized. If they give you the money for a year, its a
little better. Best I've ever had was 12 months at 0% and no fee for the money
and no annual fee for the card. That was a Chase card a couple years back.

Couple more:

EnCana - severely out of love at the moment - marginal premium to book value
(my worry is at what value that book is at). Replacement ratio high (but
knowing little about gas, is that problematic for the pressure they have to
contain in their system?). Consistent dividend history and low-ish debt. Would
prefer more cash on balance sheet though.

Constellation Energy - they cancelled the MidAmerican merger and clearly saw
more value as an independent (it was very cheap at the time). I see more value
in it - still trading below book with lots of cash. Debt moderate, but
manageable.

A lot of contract drillers / offshore come up on my screening for value

concentrated with few customers. Any thoughts in the group?

Wrong. I thought so too, but if you do the math, the percentage is much lower.
Hint: although you pay 3% on the front, you don't pay almost anything during
the 6 months you carry the loan with a balloon payment at the end. This changes
APR quite a lot. One of the non-intuitive math things. You can check it out by
plugging values into:

right now cown is my favorite financial stock. they just released their 10k and
ive accumulated a full position in it over the past two weeks finishing the
last of my purchases today. the short and sweet of it is that the company sells
for below tangible net worth and gets no credit for over $8 billion in assets
under management as of 12/31/09 which should be more now. its thinly traded
because a group controlled by the ceo owns a huge chunk of shares and there are
other major stake holders. and its a competitor of other insvestment banks so
its not likely to be full of traders or a stock thats followed closely. the
company has very little debt now. If you believe that the global recovery is
happening and we are not going back into a depression i think cown is a great
way to participate on the cheap. plus since mgmt owns such a big chunk of the
company i hope they are less likely to loot it.People who are interest should

While we are taking about oil and drilling. I picked up a 5000 share position
in NOV at 29 and change last July. In looking at the last 10k they seem to have
low debt a lot of cash and according to Yahoo book is about $33 a share.
Obviously all these companies have been affected by spending over the last
12-18 months.

Backlog was lower than I would have liked to see going into 2010 but it seems
that common sense would say all those companies who put off investments and
upgrades over that time would eventually have to invest that money in the
equipment to maintain operations.

I assume that would be positive for NOV but what I would like to get some
visibility on would be projected increase in drilling rigs globally as a
significant increase in rigs is what will put NOV in a prefect position to
capitalize on new business. Is there any place to get that information?

EDIT

I found a site search BAKER HUGHES. If what I am reading is correct is shows a
preety good increase in rigs at the last count on March 19th. sees like an
increase of over 500 rigs vs last year. the majority of those in North America.
Seems like a good rise in rigs. If that is correct doesn't NOV stand to
benefit?

Fair enough; that could be a good play, depending upon how he negotiated his
comp with Cowen...I'll pass I think for now though, as it is not true enough
value in my book for my style. There is a link to the 10K on my earlier post.

On the Tsakos companies, I am wary of anything where the management company is
not in the public vehicle, and where the entire shipping investment is not in
the one individual public company. I cannot find details of how his business is
structured, but in having more than one public company, he is obviously not
focussed on one by definition. I posted on the shipping thread just now as well
with my general thoughts on the sector.

NOV - intrigues me - my caution is that they ate up the amount of cash that is
on the balance sheet in the cash losses from operating in 2008...

On the Healthcare REIT idea - I think that needs to be more specific on a
particular investment: REITS can be good short-term holdings, but in the
long-term are not value-focussed in my mind, as the entire sector is so prone
to cyclical boom and bust (see Soros' 60s article on REITS in general). I'm not
particularly keen on the idea of chasing a sector in general, largely as you
cannot predict how competition for those extra revenues will actually play out,
particularly if the market gets cut-throat.

How about National HealthCare for a company with value characteristics:
- Last price is below book (though being in real estate, what is the book value
at...)
- Low debt
- 5yr ROE of 12.8%
However
- EPS low
- Cashflow not great

It is LIKE A LOAN amortized over 5 years, since credit card companies charge
very low minimum monthly payments.

Two examples:
Straight 1 year 3% loan for 100K.
At the beginning you have 100K capital from the loan that you can use in any
way you want (for example invest it).
After 1 month you have to pay 100K/12=~8.3K principal + ~100K*0.03/12=0.25K
interest = ~8.5K. You have 91.5K capital left.
After 2 months you have to pay the same amount ~8.5K again. You have 83K
capital left.
And so on.

0% loan with 3% origination fee amortized over 5 years (in other words, minimum
payment is low):
At the beginning you have 100K-3K up front fee =97K capital from the loan that
you can use in any way you want (for example invest it).
After 1 month you have to pay about 1K minimum payment. You have 96K capital
left.
After 2 months you have to pay about 1K minimum payment again. You have 95K
capital left.

Notice that even after a month you have much more capital than in the case of
the straight loan. Miracle? No, just math.

If you invest the capital somewhere, let's say lend it as a straight loan
yourself, the 0% loan with 3% origination fee amortized over 5 years (in other
words, minimum payment is low) is much better than the straight 3% loan. And
APR calculation reflects that.

You are right, that if you don't do anything with the money you get (put it
under the mattrass, use it to pay for non-productive asset such as a car), then
straight loan is possibly better.

Thank you for your clarification as it gives me a little more insight into your

I'm not really a credit specialist or interest rate analyst. It's all pretty
greek to me. I'm only in the stock market to try for capital gains. From my lay
man perspective if C offers me money for 6 months with a 3% fee attached to it,
it's simply highway robbery. If they offered it to me for a year and a 3% fee
with 0 interest, it becomes a matter for consideration since an alternate use
of funds could well return better than 3% in a year.

Fair enough.

I had lots of fun calculating exactly what happens in these two cases. As I
said, I found it counterintuitive at first too, so I really wanted to be sure I
am getting correct results. Interestingly enough, it also means that balloon
loans (mortgages) may be great in certain cases, assuming that interest rate is
good and one has enough capital to pay balloon at the end (otherwise there is a
huge risk of bad rate refinancing at the end that may eat all your profit from
balloon loan).

Anyway, good luck. :)

with the borrowing cost. right now both my home equity line and margin rate is

Welcome to SI, Blasted. Gotta love it when someone registers, buys a 3-year
subscription, and posts questions and opinions right up our collective alley
all in the span of about 3 hours. And not just posts like "XYZ to da moon
Friday!", but the kind of stuff folks like us can really sink our teeth into.

As funds permit, I, too, am doing what it sounds like you and a lot of people
here are doing. Looking around and thinking "If the world isn't coming to an
end, there are a lot of very good companies offered at very steep discounts
right now, and even if they're twice the price they were 6 months ago, they're
still a steal and one need only have a timeline of years; not days."

Just a little over a year ago, I put in a ton of limit buy orders at what I
thought were stupid prices. The kinds of prices I didn't think I'd have a
chance of getting, and the total of my orders, assuming the stocks didn't tank
after I bought them, would've maxed out my margin.

About once or twice a month I'd check to see if I was getting fills. I was. Got
a bit into margin but not too deeply and am nowhere near it now.

I used to be an active trader. These days I'm just too busy for that, so even
though I haven't been a buyer in a long time, I consider most of the stocks
I've bought to be relatively safe alternatives to savings accounts but with
likely far higher yields.

I'd probably still be buying with every spare penny, but not a lot of those
laying around. Websites in the re-start phase (yet again!) do have healthy
appetites.

Regarding SNY, unfortunately my wife is highly placed at a CRO, so even though
we don't talk shop much, I'm just too darned cute to find myself in prison
because I happened to load up on some OTM calls only to find out over dinner
that they're not only a client, their FDA submission is nearly done, weeks or
months ahead of schedule.

When I'm presented with a possibility I think it'd be insane to pass up,
nowadays I do tell her that I've taken a position, don't specify whether long
or short, and tell her that if they're a client, I don't wanna know it or

CVX. I have consulted for CVX and have mostly liked the then management. I use
Chevron (mostly) in my cars. I've held a position in CVX since maybe '95 with
reinvesting dividends. It's been a very good hold for a what I wanted: The
dividend Achiever/Aristocrat thing.

I sold down my position in '08-'09. I just have too many oil/gas stocks and too
many oil majors. And when oil drops, the shares of all these stocks all just
fall.

As pharma analysts flit to certain pharmaceutical companies based on their
perceptions of companies' drug pipelines, oil analysts seem to me to do the
same with oil majors: Sometimes XOM is seen to have the best prospects,
sometimes BP or Shell or COP, and it may now be CVX.

I'm holding on to the CVX shares I have, and I plan on continuing to do so. I
decided I like Total, especially or primarily if I'm interested in a good
dividend component; if shares will drop I might add there. (XOM maybe too, if
it hits lows on no adverse news) On a 2-5 year basis, CVX has outperformed TOT
though:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=CVX&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=tot

The "dean" of oil analysts is Charlie Maxwell. As I understand it, he is
advising to stay away from majors because they have a hard time replacing
reserves. He likes some of the Canadian oil sands plays. I've followed his
advice and made larger bets there. (larger than bets than on the majors).

I may have got myself tied up in the way I'm looking and analyzing some oil/gas
stocks. I'm looking for ones that trade under after-tax net asset value. That
is not the standard/accepted way to value oil/gas companies. These are mostly
small companies that I find, and although I'm not making big commitments to
them (ATPG an exception for me), I am putting money there.

I'm saying I believe it depends on what you want from the investment and how
long you plan to hold: I agree: "Chevron (CVX) seems like a nice value-dividend
play. It's an Achiever."
I'm in for that reason. However, I am investing the dividends elsewhere now,
because the CVX yield looks a little low to me. As regards, " I don't see the
price of energy going anywhere but up in the next 5 years and CVX meeting (or
beating) those forecasts...", that part I'm not so sure translates so easily or
assuredly into capital appreciation. My latest outright purchase of CVX I show
to be 9/5/08 @ $78.60/sh. so with that lot, I'm still underwater coming up on
two years (with CVX now at $75.30). These stocks can fluctuate -g-.

DSWL. I saw the term, didn't get it, and didn't want to admit ignorance.
Something to do with market cap I guess? Could you explain what it is please,
as you've mentioned it now twice, so you must consider it at least relevant if
not important.

Thanks Bob

This has been a hobby of mine for a long time. To be fair it was not until
recently when I started to have enough real money to start acting on my
research. That was probably a good thing as I was younger and not as informed
as I am today back then.

I have read all the Buffet books, and even some of the Graham books including
the parts of Security Analysis I could get through. I have been eager to find a
place where I can go and bounce idea off of like minded folks at the same time
I can learn from people who have been doing this longer than I.

The Big Short brought me to this website and I instantly knew I had found a
home. I have a full time job not in the financial sector and as I said I fired
my money manager a year ago and took over my portfolio which today is worth in
the low seven figures. The entire amount is invested in equities at this time.

I appreciate the kind words and hope to add something to the board if only
another opinion. Most of all I want to continue to learn. In less than a week I
have already picked up some things that have added to the way I evaluate my
picks.

well I only took a quick look but I do not like what I see.

For one thing they earned .04 a share last quarter. I cant even seem to find
any real projections for 2010. according to cnbc they are trading at like 33x
PE which is crazy.

Obviously I did not do the deep dive but on a quick scan I do not see anything
that would make me want me to dig more unless I am just totally missing
something.

Seems to me there are a lot of better picks out there.

I like your first trade in particular - nice return. I'm not familiar with the
insurance companies - so they tend to trade at a discount to book? Seems that
some comps do. Seem to be quite sticky revenues and earnings, which is good -
how do you look at the float and how the earnings translate into value?

re Dreswell - the reason the PE is so high is that the earnings have fallen by
more than the price has over the past year, and the assets are a floor on the
price (hence my measure of safety on the stock).

My view of the value is in the rather low valuation to book, which fails to
value the company's real business on top of those assets. Combined with a track
record, and a clear cyclical return, and also a floor to the investment in
those hard assets, I think it might be a true value play.

Feels like a yuck investment on first glance, but maybe I'm wrong. While I keep
an eye on P/E in relation to where the stock might go, I really am not looking
at the technicals or the P/E when analysing these at first. Earnings recovery
to last year will chop the P/E ratio dramatically to a level more in line with
where it has been in the past.

Happy to debate it though - I am happy to be proven wrong

Any other interesting ideas going around?

Regards,

Alex

Welcome blastedwand -

One of the best stock screeners is located here:
http://finviz.com/screener.ashx

I use this site to point me to undervalued sectors, find undervalued stocks, or
just to find different companies that meet my "value stock" criteria. It's a
good first start when trying to find new value opportunities.

I also try to find "hidden gems" that might be buried in a company's balance
sheet or even as a separate operating division. Many time the market overlooks
this and if you identify it first, it make it easier to stay with the position.

For example I liked Both HD and Sears in the early 90's and at that time Sears
was the disliked retailer. The savvy investor realized that the two companies
had one significant thing in common....they owned the land (or the mall) that
their stores were built on. I made a lot of money w/ Sears buying it below
$10.00/share w/ this in mind. Their real estate holdings was the "hidden Gem"
in their balance sheet where it was held on the books at cost not market value.
Eddie Lampert realized the significant real estate value and bought the company
w/ his hedge fund.

Therefore, when I scan for new value companies, I try to find hidden assets (or
under utilized assets) that with good management can be broken out and made
more valuable. Sometimes this comes in the form of an undiscovered operating
division and certain types of assets they may own under license or certain land
use rights they may not know they own. New technologies or discoveries make
these assets become valuable (ie horizontal gas drilling).

The only way an undervalued opportunity becomes valuable is when the market
(and management) discovers the true market value. That's why it is important to
have a management that is always thinking "out-of-the-box".

You have to turn a lot of rocks over before you discover anything. However, if
you think you might have found one of these "hidden gems", alert our board to
the opportunity. I am sure one of the many savvy investors here can
substantiate your find or show you the flaws in your analysis.

The value investing thread is a good place to discuss undervalued companies or
different "investment themes". It is helpful to provide a link or two so the
even the lurker can sound in if something sounds too good to be true.

you may be right. I need to take a deeper dive when I get some time. For me I
like to try and find stocks that not only are a discount to book but also have
some real potential to break out with strong growth. I guess the growth is not
jumping out at me but to be fair I looked at this for 5 minutes.

I am going to look closer and read through some statements and educate myself
some more on the company.

I will throw out one stock I am watching but I will say right upfront it is a
total flier. MBHI. This bank could get shut down and seems to have nothing
going for it but recently the government gave it some breathing room by
allowing it to restructure some debt with treasury. In addition it failed to
comply with nasdaq listing rules by trading over $1 but it was also given
breathing room of another 180 days to comply with that. Board has already
approved a reverse stock split but for some reason they have not done it yet.

They have new management team in place and are executing on a capital plan.
They have increased their liquidity and seem to be executing as the new team
has promised.

I do not see how the economy in Mich is going to get any worse and if it starts
to hold and even turn around it would seem like this could benefit as well.

In any event I own 100k shares at .33 and as I said this is a flier. This
purchase goes against everything I promise myself I would invest in but I just
couldn't stop myself for some reason. Obviously it is trading below book as all
banks seem to be doing and it is very hard to figure out what it is really
worth and if it will even still be around in 6 months.

Don't hold this pick against me as I normally don't live on the edge like this.

Some of these banks are interesting - the difficulty is seeing what is on the
book in terms of lending. I will have to take a deeper look later, but my
checklist on financials would be:

- Clean book of lending?
- Area of operations (outside core is a danger sign)
- Deposit base strength
- Capital cushion (clearly low in this case, with government involvement)
- Market characteristics (banking markets are very different between regions -
what works in each area etc)
- Management experience in (a) that market and (b) turnarounds

I view as more of a turnaround than value play, as the naturally levered nature
of them can drive them to nothing before you can blink at times...

Hi Alex -

Well that's the tough part. If they were easy to find, then they would not be
hidden. Start by reading the annual reports and understanding what the company
does. Look for operating companies that do not necessarily fit with the core
business. Look at the tangible assets they own (real estate, patents, mineral
rights etc).

Look at recent purchases they may have done and if they are selling off some of
the non core assets. For example, when Supervalue bought Albertsons, they
already had a buyer lined up to buy the Osco drug store business units. They
cherried picked the good stores and sold the under performing ones. This
allowed them to buy excellent performing assets for about $0.75 on the $1.00.

Scan the news and see if any new regulations might benefit the company.
Sometimes there are unexpected litigation settlements or even government
bailouts. The FDIC has been acquiring failed banks and selling off the assets.
NYB has been buying these assets for $0.65 on the $1.00 with the government
guaranteeing the acquired loans.

This is where the fun is involved. You have to think outside the box. Look at
some new innovative "disruptive" technology and see which companies might
benefit from it. I have been exploring "horizontal drilling" technology to see
if any large land owners (that own their mineral rights) might now be able to
explore profitably for NG . One land REIT I own, Plum Creek has had success
finding NG on some of their properties. The new drilling technology makes
marginal parcels very productive parcels with new wells that will last over 30
years. That's a good way to add a new ongoing revenue stream to the companies
bottom line.

I usually start with a theme and use the company screener to identify companies
that might benefit from the "opportunity". Scan by sector, geography, sic code,
successful managers (remember Hacksaw Reynolds) and of course successful growth
companies. Think of it as a treasure hunt because the values are out there to
be found if you look hard enough.

If you find something do share with us on this thread as what you might think
is a winner could turn out to be a dud as you may have over looked some obvious
company liability.

Hi Dr.

The easy answer is to start with companies that have a PE of 10 or less.
However it can be much more convoluted depending on what your screening for. If
I am searching for cheap tangible assets, I will screen BV numbers less than 1.
This can be deceiving since sometimes BV includes goodwill which overstates the
value of tangible assets.

If I am trying to find a company that generates a lot of cash and sells at a
discount, I will do some free cash flow screens combined with a PE screen. This
can also be misleading since you have to look at the quality of the cash
flow(s) (one time, wasting assets, one time litigation settlement, etc.).

Sometimes, I will start with a company I consider a value and pull some of the
financial ratios from Yahoo and use these as beginning screening criteria. This
is especially useful if I want to find companies in a similar sector or
business. The screening tool will give you many more companies to investigate
than the similar Yahoo direct competitor comparison screen.

Think of the screener tool as something similar to a medical blood panel test.
You can find those companies that are in the normal range and one or two that
are undervalued but may have one or two financial components in the extreme.
Can management (new or current) fix these extreme components or are they even
fixable. If they are fixable (like expanding profit margins) do they have the
pricing power in the current economic cycle.

There is no one "correct" set of valuation criteria. Benjamen Graham looked at
BV and PE's. Buffet also factors current management into his value proposition.
Other than PE and BV, my main criteria for determining value is to compare
companies to their peers. Sometimes you can find an undervalued company that
owns a core group of underutilized assets but until a new management is brought
in or the assets are sold (at market value) the investment remains undervalued.
The screening tool does not help in this case.

I hope that helps. The is no absolute answer to your question.

Some interesting names youa re throwing around:

 Timberland (strong business brand and value characteristics)
Strong brand maybe, but what value characteristics/ I don't see anything.

 Daily Journal Corp (cash per share; run-up in share price is large though)
Dying business (newspaper) but very cheap based on cash flow multiples. Cigar
but stock.

 Tessera (strong revenue growth historically and value characteristics - price
seems depressed as it has missed guidance...sign for me to buy)
Tech stock, majority of their business is in very competitive markets
(semiconductor connects& packaging) but they have a lot of IP and fairly strong
margins. I also like their micro-optic business - it has a lot of potential.
this could become a takeover candidate because of IP. I think it's not
extremely cheap at this point but at lower prices, i'd be interested.
