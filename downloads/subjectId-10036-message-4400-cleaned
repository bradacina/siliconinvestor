I will not argue with anybody with the guts to liquidate their entire
portfolio. I tested myself on that four months ago, and found I went right back
in. Now I'm in gradual liquidation mode again, trying to get myself into
high-dividend and stable REITs (EGP, LHO), Asia (APF) and microcap net-nets
(PSO). The common denominator is low correlation with the U.S. market. So even
though I didn't have the guts to go all cash, I have well over 50% of my
portfolio in these three categories. Plus another 10-15% in cash. Its very easy
to say cash is better than value stocks. I probably agree with you. If the
market tanks, low P/E stocks are going to drop too. But I don't think the three
categories I mentioned go down much, yet they also give me some offense (PSO
and HYDEA have made me more money than any index investment would have, and the
REITs I have bought have held up just fine. Asia has not been fun though, but
that's five year money). My challenge to you is if you actually believe your
analysis, what is your cash position. Given what you say, if you're not holding
50% cash, you need to rethink your conviction level.

Hi Mike,

I'm back with a semi-equipment pick. ;-)
James does not invest in high-tech but
someone may be interested. :-)

OK. It's HELX. Selling cryo vacuum pumps to
semi-equips. Semi-equip sector is in the dumps.
And HELX is expensive at 4 P/book, 2 P/sales.
But... it pays ~6% dividend and has 30% ROE, etc.
Last semi downturn they got down to similar yield.
Dividend was kept all the time.

No debt, $1.7 per share cash. Some acquisition
pending.

Any comments?

Jeffrey Bash: re "too many value stocks I am down on". Well that got my
attention.

When somebody says their value stocks are down, maybe (I sez to myself) them
are just the ones to look at now.

So, just as an exercise to see if I can find anything I might like and to see
why you might be concerned with your value stocks, I took a couple of minutes
to see where you've been visiting on SI lately. Here's a list with Yahoo's
current estimate of p/bk and psr:
CCUR (7., 2.)
SUL (1.3, .6)
NUHC (1.0, .2)
DIIG (2.5, .5)
XICO (.6, .3)
SUBM (neg, .25)
GDC (1.8, .6)
SEMI (1.6, 2.)
ETEC (3.3 2.8)
JBL (5.4, 1.0)
DPMI (2.1, 1.9)

Okay, a lot of disclaimers here: If you think I'm too snoopy and personal, post
back same and I will offer a public apology. I am not saying you own these
stocks or even that you have culled them out as value stocks. Only info. I have
to work with though. Also, I am not saying I know what I am talking about-- if
you read back a few posts you will see I have a bunch of stocks I am down on
that I thought were value stocks -- or I thought were value stocks when I
bought them at higher prices. Also for my stocks, I admit I am not so
consistent as regards p/bk or psr values. Value of course is in the eye of the
beholder, and we (you, I, others) have been involved in at least a little
discussion of how/best way to value tech stocks.

Okay given all that, it does seem from what I see about the stocks you've
posted to, that all of them are tech stocks, and very few, even now, have a
margin of safety as defined by me (and again, I am not consistent in my own
choices) of price below book value. Only 6 of 11 have psr's less than 1.
Now I am not saying these stocks aren't good investments at these or even
higher prices. However, from my perspective, looking at stocks to screen for
value, I think maybe only XICO which is selling at 1.8 vs. 1.3 cash value (.3
debt/eq) and low p/bk and psr might be a value stock (for me).

Jeffrey, I certainly understand that in this market environment (maybe in every
other market environment as well -g-) that there are concerns about the worth
and efficacy of value investing. (Obviously I share some of your concern --
just based on my listing of my own crumbled stocks). Are you sure though you
yourself have not gone somewhat away from classic value investing -- these 11
stocks don't seem as diversified or offer a margin of safety (based on my quick
scan) that one might expect from straight Graham.

Anyway, FWIW, and regards.... Paul.

Jim, you missed the key phrase -- "can value stocks bought now
give you a positive return?" I do not have a significant cash position.
However, of recent sales made, virtually all of the money has not been put back
into stocks. I do not believe in buying the hot stocks because I expect a
bigger fool to come along, and I am skeptical that small value stocks in
general will get a day in
the sun before a more substantial correction comes along.

I generally do not subscribe to overall market strategy theories, but I have
two I like. The last thirty-two years can be split into two roughly equal
periods -- the first, in which stocks made zero progress relative to average
returns over extremely long periods (of about 9-10%), and the second, where
stocks had nearly double normal returns. I think we are soon due for a possibly
long period of substandard returns.

My other observation is that you can stick a chart of the Dow almost perfectly
on top of a chart of the Nikkei, with recent Dow highs matched to N 40,000. I
don't know how high is high, but my inclination to buy stocks with new money or
proceeds of sales is rather low. It is probably the fun I have more than
anything else that keeps me from being an aggressive seller and, altho I have a
lot of money in the market, I do not need it to maintain my standard of living.

jeffrey,

Can we apply traditional investing to this market?

I ask this because the IRA, Keogh, and other tax free investing into mutual
funds and the current flow of money out of Asia has caused an artificial
market.

How can an analyst put out a 'buy' on Yahoo projecting $250.00? Is this
investing or speculating (or gambling against the odds)?

I've been trading short term on stocks I know. Any news, good or bad, related
to the company or not, seems to cause big movement in prices on the small and
mid caps. It's enabled me to lower my positions.

"Can we apply traditional investing to this market?

funds and the current flow of money out of Asia has caused an artificial
market."

I agree. And Jeffrey has an interesting point to compare our market to the
Japanese market. During their bull market and at their highs they had a
national ethic for saving and investing. Their post-war generation was going to
rebuild Japan in this way and with the help of other factors, succeeded. Our
current savings rate approximates theirs thanks to mutual funds, 401k's, and
IRAs. Does that mean we will repeat their bursting bubble? Maybe. But they have
also maintained an economic system of national patronage and protectionism
which has corrupted their large corporations. Their finance system is corrupt
and is much less regulated than ours (many hate the word "regulated" so you can
replace it with "investor-protective" or some such phrase) with regard to
reporting practices. And they are more vulnerable to national demographics
because they have very pro-Japanese immigration policies. The US is more likely
to hire out of skill than nationality and when the boomers age out of the
productive demographic the major corporations will lobby congress to allow more
able-bodied workers into the country to take up the slack.

This is beginning to sound like a defense of the current market valuation and
it wasn't intended to be. My point is that we may not repeat the spectacular
bursting of Japan or the 30's due to the system we have in place. I'm still
expecting a strong retreat in the near future so I have been raising cash as I
mentioned in earlier posts. However, the stocks that I did hang onto (TCOMA,
TCIVA, TYC) have recently done so well that my % of equity has increased!
Strange market. The only sense that I can make of it is that all my stocks that
start with T's have done well and all that start with O's have done poorly! :-)

John, if you put your point about there being much fewer problems here
than in Japan together with my two theories about the last 32 years and about
the same price pattern as the Nikkei, you may end up with a long period of
sloppy markets and par or subpar returns, but no collapse like Japan. I think
this is possibly the most likely of the bearish scenarios.

And speaking of dividend and value, does anyone have an opinion on Weyerhaeuser

Still...
WY is the largest private owner of softwood lumber in the world. They have
never cut dividend. Inside ownership about 12%. This stock is looking like a
great fit for me for portfolio inclusion based on a relative dividend model.

Jeffery; We have a new Godzilla in this market that has grown in
size and it is still growing and it's changing the way the market
works. Old patterns can't be used to predict what this thing will
do. More Index funds coming on line all the time.

In a way we are back to the NIFTY FIFTY thing, the 50 top stocks
in the S&P500 make up over 50% of the entire S&P.

The Top 15 in the S&P 100 make up over 50% of it.

The Top 5 in the Nazdaq 100 make up 50% of it.

We have index funds now running out our ears, and more coming
on line as fast as they can set them up.
These funds track the indexes , regardless of the inflow or
out flow of money, hence they computer program buy/sell the
the ones that effect the index the most more than the others.
As it's easier to stay in step if you trade the Nifty Fifty.
-------------
Indexing has for all practical purposes crippled the concept of
value investing. It's more strategic investing now, based mostly
on cash flow than into the mutual funds , vs interest rates.
Pension funds and all have gotten into the swing, looking for
returns they go with the flow.

There is some rotation, but that's mostly among the Nifty Fifty.
At any given time you can down load the top 50 in the S&P,
spilt them into two groups of 25, pick the second group
cull out any thing that's out of favor, then reallocate every
3 months and you will beat the S&P.

A very good post James! You are so very right in what you have said. Let me
asked you an additional question? Have you used or thought about the "Beat The

your idea of the second 25 of the top 50 S&P stocks. Now if we can get a
Management company to set up a mutual fund with just those stocks would it be
as hot as the BTD in back testing? Would you think investing in the ""Nifty

I agree WY would be a good value at 40. Also check out Westvaco (W). W has a
somewhat lower D/E, p/b, p/e, and more cash. But I would buy either on a 10%
dip. I recently bought some Pope & Talbot (POP), which is mainly a sawmill
operation with little timber land of its own. Despite a recent (small) loss,
the resulting 50% drop in price has raised the dividend to about 7%, which
should be safe with $5/share in cash.

Yeah, very good post James -g-. Nice to see your occasional hit-and-run post
here that repeats your opinion that value investing doesn't work, and that we
need to do this new thing you've come up with. Juices up the thread on a quiet
Sunday. Nice to see also that you're packing your post with some stocks and
prices, and that you've got some help in cleaning up your English and spelling.

Of course you provide absolutely no evidence that value investing is crippled.
I don't see why balancing your MOMO stocks every three months is optimum or why
transaction costs are not important. I don't see that culling losers from
gainers is better than picking the losers. (I would guess the tendency for
value investors would be to go with the stocks that haven't yet moved as much.)
I don't see where anyone has tried this method successfully, or even that you
yourself use it. Nor is it clear how best to reallocate (by $, by percent
increase/decrease in price, some sector balance,50 stocks only). And
risk/reward tradeoffs are not considered. (As in 'margin of safety' that is
often associated with value investing) Nor are any tax implications considered.
(Although I assume your method is for IRAs/401s/etc.)

Basically you are saying buy a sample of big stocks that everyone is buying
(indexing on) that are going up. If they don't go up, don't buy 'em. Sounds to
me just like what Will Rodgers once said--I think before the market crashed.

Anyway you get credit from me (FWIW) for creative ideas, but as far as this
actually being a better way to invest than value investing... I don't see it.

Hi Jim; Well I was using that more to show how the index funds
have so much power in the market today. That's not the
way I ( trade ), mostly because I can't afford to cover that many
bases weighted. So I'm limited to Mutual funds to get diversity,
and a few picks.
One thing I noted last year is that within the top 100 of the
S&P if you see a stock that has an unusual pull back, check it
out. Many of them do pull back 20% and they most always rebound.
MICI ,& CPQ were my better plays last year, they both got over
sold. I missed BA not long ago but if she pulls back again to
the $44 level I'm going in.
---------------
I was a die hard Peter Lynch fan, but even he admits that the
stock market does not work the way it did when he made it
big.
------------------
Value seems to be a relative thing, and nowadays thanks to all
the indexers it's best to stay with the mo mo stocks and
bite when they have significant dips that enhances their value
relative to their peers.
------------------
Poor boying it I still look for steals on some really beat up
stuff ( when they get hit so hard as to take them not just below
book, but below CASH on hand ) these are almost always good for
20% but for me they are hard to find. I don't have a screen
program that looks for cash on hand, and have to dig through
a ton of under $3 stocks to find them. Here I'm just buying the
cash.
--------------------
There is a lot I would do if I had the resources , but I don't see
the point any longer in my making up a model I can't afford
to trade, yet with out some diversity there is to much risk,
so I have to compromise on what I would like to do.

Will Rogers was not a market guru but rubbed shoulders with a few,
he warned of the crash, and his "Don't buy if it don't go up,"

He also referred to the Wall Street gang as the "peanut gallery." ,
and stuck pins in their balloon more than once. Both before
and after.
Some bankers use to invite him as a speaker to their hob nobs just to prove
they were good sports. He would rare back with a smile on his face and insult
the hell of them, and not only could
get away with it, but got paid to do it.

I can't afford to trade the MO MO style, was just using it to
show the effect in the market, and why the older value style
of investing does not seem to be as effective as it once was.
I doubt very many individual investors could trade Mo Mo style
and I don't exactly recommend it. I'm just calling attention to it
so people might think or re-think about how time tested
methods can lose their effectiveness.

If any thing, one has to keep an open mind, and at least consider
a strategy within their means. Ignoring the MO MO characteristic
won't make it go away. So how you fit that into the equation could
lead to a serious debate, and never be conclusive, as the way
people should invest will never be the same. Among their resources
is also their ( time window ) as to when they might need the money back. While
I talk stocks a lot I'm 61 and 80% in bonds.

Agreed.
My thesis is that semi-equips are undervalued now.
My pick for risky small-cap value is ASYT. My pick
for conservative small-cap value is HELX - you get the 6%
dividend, you know. :-) Of course, for the people
unfamiliar with the sector, it's wise to wait for
AMAT to drop to value levels.

IMO, Marty Whitman's picks are not the best of
the breed, but then he made them a quarter ago when prices
were different. He also will ride the theory that the
whole sector will rebound.

BTW, another approach that I may test in the
future is buying high-yield stocks and selling when
they drop from that category either through price
appreciation or through dividend cuts. HELX would
be one such stock.

Good luck

James: Appreciate the clarification. Makes more sense to me now.

David Dreman reported that he invests heavily in low p/bk stocks of large caps
esp. after they drop in price and he/his team have assured themselves that the
reasons for the drop are understood and short term (I'm not sure what he means
by short term.). The interesting thing for me was that in a recent interview (I
think it was with Morningstar, not sure though) he said, if he can't find
stocks that meet his criteria, and while waiting for such stocks to show up, he
keeps his money in an index fund. (And the author of the article says Dreman
has beat the S&P for the past few years.) So this might be one possible way to
invest for individual investors. I know for myself, I'm mostly in a combination
of stocks I've picked and cash. I will now go back and consider whether I too
should put that cash into an index fund and draw from that fund when I see
individual stocks to buy or put stock sales proceeds directly into the fund.

producing stocks and funds? Would that make a difference? Does anybody have any
experience trading stocks within an IRA?

Pretty basic stuff and if anybody knows of a separate thread for this I'd
appreciate the push.

Thanks,
John

Roger T.; re. CSEP, others. Thanks for posting. Some of these keep showing up
from my screening criteria also. Have been following CSEP, but don't own it.
Environmental friendly pesticides, new products introduced, but they never show
a profit, and they are very small. Stock price bounces around, maybe okay as a
trading vehicle.
Problem with some of these net-net stocks for me is that I can not see what a
catalyst might be to drive them higher, they can stay down quite a while (which
is hard in this up market), and basically you have to own a number of them
(according to B. Grhaham).

I'll look again at RAGS. Paul Senior

Hey Paul. Here are some links to some recent articles - the one on small caps

Small-Caps May Offer Big Opportunities according to some - research by Ibbotson
Associates Inc. found that over the past 72 years, small-caps have averaged a
return of 12.7 percent a year, compared with 11 percent for large-caps. That's
a huge difference in the long term.

doesn't ever seem to earn much on that book value. Also small and maybe risky?
WY is going in the wrong direction -g- UP, and I didn't get a chance to buy at
the price I wanted. I'll keep watching W and POP. I figure these are all
cyclical companies where insiders might know when to buy, but for me, trying to

John Kolb: re: setting up Roth IRAs and "pretty basic stuff".

Well I think the setup of it/them is a basis all right , but not at all "basic
stuff". Lot of people wrestle with the issues you mention. And these issues are
sometimes never really resolved permanently-- they keep coming back into our
lives too.

Key to me now is your expression "have any experience trading stocks". Not
"investing" but "trading" --- that's a tell to me. So given the fact you want
to trade stocks -- you should set up one ROTH as a trading vehicle. In trading,
you won't have the favorable long term gains, and the tax consequences for
short term are deferred until you cash out of the ROTH. So this opinion is for
what I think you want.
But maybe really the wrong issue.

To me, the question is not the tax consequence, but rather should you (or
anyone) even trade stocks. That you want to trade says to me --my own opinion
of course-- that the best advice would be to put you in a position where you
cannot so easily and cavalierly trade stocks. Because trading is not a method
for making money that has much validity. Putting you in a ROTH IRA with an
internet broker is just what will encourage you to trade more (and lose more
IMO.) However, as stated by me in other posts, nobody wants to hear this, and
only people who've traded a lot and lost can understand this. So be it.

I assume this is a rollover ROTH. I can't comprehend an individual stock--
trading or investing-- vehicle if it's just the annual $2k (My $2k's in an
eq.-inc. mutual fund.) Get yourself a good CPA tax man (or woman)-- who can
determine tax consequences of various options given your life circumstance and
goals. If you're going to trade stocks and you are interested also in dividends
within a ROTH (if your CPA says this is okay for you), my (unqualified) opinion
is to keep the dividend ROTH account separate from the ROTH trading account. In
this way, when you look at your separate accounts, you will know why a
particular stock is in each particular account. Also you should see over time,
which account(s) performs best for you, which types of investing you are
relatively better at, and therefore where you might best direct further inflows
of investing funds. JMO... and...

Alert: I seem to keep being wrong many, many times-- possibly related to my
penchant for having way too many opinions -g-. Also please note, as my wife
keeps reminding me, I'm not qualified to give any legal, accounting, stock
market, medical, marital, or cooking advice.

100 guys = 150 opinions. Ask some people on this thread also:

Looks like CSEP was indeed a value at $1.25. They are merging one for one with
RING which closed at $2.50. I expect CSEP to rise and RING to fall in the am.

Another net-net that seems like a real steal is FLYT....trading at less than
half of NET CASH...with a boatload of NOL's to boot and several insider buys
since Dec, the latest being 30,000 by the CEO at 91 cents. I've done well with
a number of these kind. They take patience but all have worked out for

Hi Paul,

Thanks for the response and the link. I appreciate your opinion but I fear I
misled you a bit. My fault for the vague post. I intend to invest (buy and
hold) but wonder what happens when a stock is eventually sold within the Roth
account. Are commissions paid from the Roth account? Is a loss (god forbid)
balanced by a gain in the non-IRA account? That sort of thing.

Also, does the special tax status of the Roth IRA oblige a different portfolio
makeup (heavier in dividend producers perhaps?)? Some of my better performers
in the non-IRA account have not paid dividends but the few dividend producing
stocks I own incur taxes so it would seem logical to put those in the Roth. Is
there anything I am missing?

The link was wonderful and I've been reading the back posts. Thanks for the
help.

And, please, call me John. :)

My opinion is that commissions are taken from within the Roth account, and that

Roger Thrash: IMO, in addition to the stocks you mention, you also bring forth
some serious issues for value investors to consider as regards investing in
net-nets. Not sure I'm ready to confront those issues yet in myself. Something
to do with how I -- and some others here -- apparently are investing in
net-nets. I/we-- perhaps unlike you, and perhaps unlike Ben Graham-- are
putting some spin on the method -- like maybe we want a viable (viable in the
sense of growing, real) business. This has led me to censor my list of
potential stocks in which I will invest. Not sure if this is good/bad or
right/wrong. Seems to work for some though. You've caused me to reflect that
perhaps you are one of the real true Graham net-net disciples (buying a package
that meet the criteria and holding them the requisite time). And given today's
environment, to own and see a package of such dreck in a portfolio month after
month is very hard on the ego/eye/cocktail conversation (even if offset by $
gains and margin of safety). So I salute you.

If "all" the net-nets have worked out for you, you must be lucky, smart, VERY
patient, or only investing in a few over a few years, or a combination. Anyway,
my cap's off to you also.

Nice call on CSEP-- I had thought $1. 1/4 might work, and I had a chance, but
lost my nerve I think.

I've looked at FLYT based on your post, and I think it also is a good buy-- so
I've started a small position today. Not sure where your numbers are coming
from though. Based on the SEC 10QSB of 6/5/98, I'm looking at $31M in working
capital (& no LT debt) which I suspect is mostly cash/cash equivalents with
20M+ shares outstanding. This seems to be a company liquidating everything they
can. Essentially, they are money looking for a business. So the bet is that
they won't squander the money.

This is what you've forced me to reconsider AS BASIC: Value investors are
people who buy $1 for fifty cents. So from what I can see with FLYT, I am
getting about $1.5 cash/sh for the $1 per/sh (approx.) stock price. Which is
buying $1 for sixty-seven cents. Well, that's about as good as it gets for me
w/net-nets. I just don't see -- and this is just me -- how I can call myself a
value investor (which I do sometimes)-- if I don't include this one (and of
course, within a well-diversified portfolio). Thanks, I think -g-. And
obviously, I hope this FLYT continues your record for working out
satisfactorily. Paul Senior

FWIW: adding a little to my position in UNMG at under $4.

Posted on it once before. Somebody said they actually followed me into it
(Foolish person! -g-) Initial reason for my purchase ($4) was that new
management team bought control from Pres. for $5/sh. I figured that surely,
management thought the stock could sell for $6 in a few years (giving me 2
points on my $4). (Of course -g-, the offset is that the Pres. didn't think
so... he was probably happy to sell at $5.) Recently, there's been an
investment management firm come in and give a capital infusion: they've bought
1M sh. at $4.5/sh -- which is about equal to book value/sh. Furthermore, sales
for this last quarter have gone up 25%. I don't pretend to know the
ramifications of what's happening here -- they are a Mexican company and in the
fruit juice business which might seriously be affected by El Nino weather,
competitors, etc.

But if I can buy below book, below what the controlling owners paid, below what
I assume at least a couple analysts from the investment firm thought was a good
$4.5M buy... well then, I'm going to buy. FWIW.

5.Only one broker following and rate as hold.
6.Last year had large(4.5 mil) inventory write down which will give good

How could anybody who're a working couple save and build up to $800M? Turns out
very simply:
Let Warren take care of it. In at $47 per and never leave.
Of course it's still the old 'simple-yes, easy-no' method. Good for them

Thanks Paul for the note. Here's another article by Glassman in today's

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1998-07/19/002r-071998-idx.html

Yeah, as a value investor the LSGI portfolio has been hurt by Asia - but I've
been picking companies like those in that portfolio for some time now and a
quote in Glassman's article sort of explains the concept - buy misunderstood
and out of favor stuff and just hold - if your sector and business analysis is
anywhere near the mark some will be discovered.

When it is out of favor it is cheap, and can get cheaper before it runs. LSGI
selections were cheap when we found them, and are cheaper now. But with tech
stocks, when they get discovered and begin to run they can run big. So I'm
still happy with the "dogs" I've bought - some day they will grow and I'll bet
at least half will "hunt."

The fund was launched in April 1993 but did not start posting eye-popping
numbers until 1995. Every year since then it has beaten the S&P and, according
to the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey, has finished in the top quintile (or 20
percent) of its peers.

For the past 12 months, Hickory has returned 65 percent, compared with 29
percent for the S&P and 17 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average.

How does Lawson do it? "We try to find stocks that are forgotten or out of
favor or misunderstood," he told me. "I'm trying to answer this question: 'What
should a reasonable person pay for a company if he's willing to hold it
forever?' " If the answer is significantly more than the market price, then
Lawson may buy it.

Here's another article on how value mutual fund managers are finding stuff to
buy:

http://www.detnews.com/1998/biz/9807/19/07190028.htm

"Even with U.S. stocks at record valuations, mutual fund managers who look to
buy stocks on the cheap say they're finding plenty of bargains. "It's amazing
that this market is concentrating a lot on the favorites," said David Dreman,
62, whose Red Bank, N.J.-based company manages about $6 billion in customers'
assets. "There's no price too high, but you can still use good value standards,
say, on a tobacco stock."

&#255; &#255; "Value" investors such as Dreman seek to buy stocks that are
cheap as measured by the ratio of their price to their expected earnings per
share. The style has been frustrating this year because investors have
preferred to bet on growth stocks, even as those stocks have rocketed ahead.

I'd like to pull that last message I posted, but I can't. My apologies to Roger
Thrash, who had more courtesy than I did in responding to me privately rather
than giving me what I deserved in public. I misunderstood his message, and now
that I read it again, he is simply holding back until he has filled his
position in an illiquid stock. I know the feeling. I sincerely hope he gives us
the full analysis when he has his own position filled.

The reason I went off the handle is that I don't want to see this special place
degenerate into the kind of hype we see on the vast majority of other threads.
But that was undeserved in this case. Please accept my apology.

On a more positive note, USEC...I ordinarily treat IPOs like the plague,
because the seller knows more about the business than I do, but there is an IPO
coming tomorrow (Wednesday) which in my opinion is a fat pitch right over the
plate. The seller is the U.S. government, so my bias against IPOs is reversed
in this case. The government is privatizing its uranium enrichment operations.
The prospectus is complicated and cumbersome, but the disclosure is excellent.
If you read it three times and see what I see, you will find a dollar bill
selling for fifty cents. Oh, and it pays a 7-8% dividend (not sure what the
price of the IPO is going to be, but it is not "hot", so I think you may have
plenty of time to do your homework and still get a good price.) All I can say
is watch this one tomorrow (its one of the largest IPOs ever, so it will be
quite visible), and you may be able to get the prospectus on EDGAR under the
ticker USU (the company is called USEC). Hint: pay special attention to the
footnotes to the balance sheet. You will hear more about this from me in the
next few weeks. I have not seen an asset play like this since St. Joe before it

There is a school of investment thought which holds that you buy a stock when
its earnings growth is higher than its price-earnings ratio and sell it when
its earnings growth is lower.If the growth of earnings per share, for instance,
is 20 per cent and the share price is 10 times those earnings then the stock is
a screaming buy. If the reverse, then sell the stock.It's an appealing idea in
its simplicity. It also does not work very well.

A bull market is all about big numbers. And in the greatest bull market of all

The booming U.S. stock market continued to attract large foreign interest.
"Foreign direct investment in the United States and U.S. direct investment
abroad continued at near record levels in the first quarter of 1998, spurred by
strong merger and acquisition activity across national borders." Private
foreign investors bought $29 billion more in U.S. stocks than they sold in the
first quarter of the year. That followed record net purchases -- the difference
between purchases and sales -- of $66 billion in the year 1997.

in the quarter ended June 30. The Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund (large-cap

5 percent for the quarter. Lower returns of small-caps compared to the S&P 500
index makes a contrarian investor eager to increase investments in small-cap
stock funds. According to Kyle Frey, manager of the Warburg Pincus Small
Company Value Fund, "Valuations of a growing number of good-quality small
companies are compelling." Frey points out that price-to-book,
price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios of small companies are at the low

(mostly) last year at $30+ level (vs. stock price today @ $13).

I don't know why PFG needs or would accept a cash infusion. They say they are
trying to max. shareholder value. But if stock decline is a consequence of a
major investor coming in, then mgmt. goofed. Consortium of Swiss Re,Credit
Suisse, and Securitas Capital I believe is the group buying $75M stock at bv.
Have not done my homework on them-- they sound safe,stolid, careful--Swiss! -
patient maybe in getting a return on their investment. (I hope they aren't
expecting to wait decades though to see results -g-). Since I calculate (and I
am not competent in making these bv calculations) bv at maybe $18-20 or more,
and here at stock price of 13 (actually about 13.5/8+ for me), I bet that I
should be able to get an even better ROI than Swiss Re (or the insiders who
bought last year).

Have no idea whether Ed McMahon is a spokesman for PFG.

If stock continues to drop to retest its lows of past few days with no co.
info. forthcoming, I intend to buy more and hope that combo of no news +
falling stock price does not scare me out. If bad news comes out, I'll have to
evaluate what effect it might have on future of co. Profitable insurance co.
(over 1000 emp. with market cap of more than 340M) selling this far below bv,
with another insurance co.or two willing to come in at bv to the tune of
$75M--- gee that's just too tempting for me. Any ideas/opinions you (or anyone
else) has (have )re PFG, glad to hear them here.

Not trying to tout the stock. I've been wrong many, many times before. Heck,
wrong many, many times before, during, and after -g-. For me though, this stock
may be (maybe) worth a full position in a long-term taxable (and diversified
-g-) portfolio. Paul.

Jim,

So USU is public, at around 14 1/4, near the low end of the range.
I read the prospectus and am less than impressed. At best I see
a company selling for a mild premium to book. The dividend is based
on a very high payout, and looks like it's around 7.7% at present.
They repeatedly state that pricing pressure is intense, and admit
that hey, it's a commodity with 4 major producers worldwide and
with government regulations and national loyalties complicating the
picture.

It transfers its depleted UF costs to the government today, but
it also pays off a huge chunk of its cash. I see basically stable to
very low growth over the next 10-15 years, and the prospectus
states that if anything the numbers are declining recently.

So it looks like an attractive utility-like company for a decent
dividend, but I don't see a dollar for 50 cents. Of course, maybe you know
something about the value of their inventories that I don't.
I didn't see it in the footnotes.

BTW, New Holland is just getting crushed. New lows are becoming
frequent and they're adding up, if slowly. I only have a $2200
position, so I'd buy more, but I'm concerned that I'm missing
something that the Street is getting. If you hear any scuttlebutt
I'd love to hear it.

I like a tech company, Asyst (ASYT). Why I like it is up on
my web site. Basically, as a contrarian, I can't resist the
semi equip sector now, even if it is tech. Given my recent history,
that means everyone reading this who likes the idea should wait
3 months and get it 30% cheaper ;)

James and Mike,

Here's a beauty. ENC. A company producing
collectible figurines. That gives some brand
name protection and loyal customers. Margins are
great, cash flows positive and enormous. The company
turned around this year - sold the money losing
direct marketing division, changed name to Enesco from
Stanhome. Trades at 1 PSR, ~16 PE, depending how you count
it. No debt. Repurchased ~1 mln. shares. 3.X dividend yield.
Reported yesterday with good results. There may be
a pop up in the near future as PEs are updated (cf PSO).

As a negative - the CEO is paid some enormous salary.

A friend of mine made killing on DFS, which is
in the same business. Now DFS is no longer a great buy,
being more expensive at 3.X PSR,
but then they did not need to turn around. :-)

Another thing. What do you guys think about ELY
at these levels? Here's another NKE deja vu. A well known
baby-boomer stock. My broker says that a bunch of
his clients follow it. Which means that you'll have a NKE story -
it will recover (or bounce up to fall again) much sooner
than the real recovery. The 64K question is whether the
story is intact. Same question as NKE. If golf is growing
only 1-2% like Aldila quoted, the ELY growth might be
unsustainable. It may need overseas expansion as NKE does
to show good numbers. OTOH, it's a cash machine,
so buying now is OK too. It's trading at ~1.2 PSR using
last 6 months. That's good. PE is 11 or 14 depending whether
you use this quarters result or the last 6 months result.
However, the inventories and AR are still ugly.
I'd wait for <$10 or for a glimmer of recovery.

Re: USEC. Just started trading today - the government privatized its uranium
enrichment business in the largest IPO of the year. It did not "pop", so you
can still get the same price the big institutuions got.

Mike - Your analysis is exactly like my first cut. Now flip the prospectus
over, however painful, and read it again. Look for:

1) Inventories are not as boring as they look. The government has slipped USEC
a huge uranium stockpile which is completly unnecessary to the core business.
It will be liquidated over about 6 years. Uranium has a market price, noted in
the prospectus. Discount it however you want, but I don't see how you can get
much less than $7 a share for this asset. (see pp. 59-60)
2) Why have operating earnings been falling for the last 3 years? Its almost
all due to an expense on the income statement called "Project Development
Costs". The nature of this expense makes me want to set it aside and value the
business without it. It looks a lot more like an investment than an expense to
me. So if we do that, we've got a business earning $2 a share (nearly all free
cash flow), the uranium inventories worth $7-10, and then this investment/money
pit.
3) The $150 million project cost I am backing out is the tail end of what looks
to me like a government boondogle. The feds have spend nearly $2 billion on
this research, which if feasible would cut USEC's costs signficicantly (but
would require $1.5 billion to build a new facility). The point is that it is an
option. Management is not going to build this plant if it doesn't make
financial sense. Options, by definition, cannoth have negative value, so let's
just call this zero.

Also, top-notch management from the private sector. An oligopoly where
competitors are often barred from each other's markets. And when was the last
time you ever saw the government run something efficiently. There have got to
be cost-cutting opportunities. Also, when you think about book value, the
plants are on the books for nothing becasue the government owns them. But USEC
has a sweetheart lease deal in perpetuity. That way below market lease has
great value which is not on the balance sheet.

This stock will trade in the mid-20s when the market figures this out, and I
get an 8% yield while I'm waiting.

EQNX - Value play?

One of my favorite stocks, eqnx, was recently beaten down because they slipped
in earnings last quarter (due to slipped orders from OEM(s))and apparently the
word leaked out prematurely. They were punished severely.

Now trading at $9.5, down from a recent high of $18,
PE - 11.1
3.4M shares, book value of $4.29
Price:sales - 1.8
38% held by institutions, 23% insiders.
$14 million in cash, no debt.

Seems to me they could just liquidate the company and pay a handsome premium to
all shareholders. Most recent press release says that they have already booked
the orders missed from last quarter, hinted that another OEM deal is in the
works.

Their closest competitor - Digi (dgii) is trading at PE of 73! Equinox products
are better (IMO), cheaper, margins are higher, and they have new products on
the drawing board. They get great technical reviews in the trade magazines.

Does this fit the mold of a "Value Play"?

USEC is not a utility. Nuclear power plants are their customers. You underscore

misunderstood. The sales effort by Merrill and Morgan Stanley was inept, yet
they got the deal done (at half what the company is worth). Let's really focus
on this in the next couple of days, because I know the business as well as
anybody, it is trading at half what it is worth, and it pays a dividend yield 1
1/2 times the long bond rate. In my opinion this is a no-brainer, and I put 10%
of my portfolio in it today and will put another 10% in when I sense which
direction its going to go. (I sense there is a good chance it could go lower).
Anybody who has read the prospectus, fire questions my way either on the thread

Re: USU

Ok, here goes -

To be misunderstood, there must be hidden assets. Are there?
First let's value inventories correctly (I admit that valuing
much of it at DOE's cost is not an accurate reflection of the
value):

In stock on books at DOE cost:
7.944M SWU @$90/SWU --> $715M
12,145 Metric Tons Uranium @35/kg --> $425M

Just got from DOE for free, on books at DOE cost:
7000 metric tons uranium --> $245M
3800 metric tons uranium --> $133M

Just got from DOE for free, on books at estimated current value
given that this is raw material that must be broken down into
Uranium and SWU:
45 tons LEU --> $25.3M
0.8 tons HEU --> $22.4M
50 metric tons HEU --> $176.8M

Other assets include cash of $50M, AR of $222.5M, Russian product
paid for but not delivered $162M, property of $121.6M (I'll assume
that's true), and several other assets that add up to about $600M

There's also a big "other" at $574M which I'll throw in as true.

So that's $2920M in assets

Assuming liabilities are real, there's 980M in current accounts,
$150M long term, and 127 other for about $1.25B.

That gives me $1670M in adjusted book, which is at the high end of
the projected IPO price. No dollar for 50 cents as far as I can
tell, but yeah, it's a dollar of real book for about 85 cents,
assuming that the present value of future dispositions is a wash.

For 85 cents of book, I get a 7.7% dividend, first paid 12/31/98.
I also get about $200M in reproducible free cash flow. And I get
a product mix that is increasingly leaning on Russin HEU, which
as far I can tell there buying for about $85/SWU and selling
for about $90/SWU. I'm doing this as I'm late for dinner with the
inlaws, so that may require rechecking. That lower margin business
is now at 37%, up from 25% of business. And SWU prices have ranged
from $49 to $91 in the last ten years, making the increased reliance
on Russian HEU more risky, IMO.

It dominates the Asian market to the tune of 68%, which I see
as a great opportunity for the company, as more than anybody
Asia once it gets going again will need what the company sells.
And it's laser enrichment technology is exciting, but would
be more exciting if it was being deployed sooner than 2005. The
competitors already have cheaper processes, and one of them
will be getting an even cheaper process around 2001. The company
competes primarily on price.

I see a decent value play, but I think the government is getting
close to fair value, give or take a few hundred million ;)

re: USEC (USU)
Mike has just boiled down an incredibly complex prospectus to a simple
analysis. I am honestly shocked because I know how long it took me to get to
that point. And I didn't see it until I interviewed management one-on-one.
Mike, great job, and you're getting close. You have the facts just as I see
them, but let me take you one step further. Hopefully this exchange is helping
others understand this unique business as well - wouldn't want to just have a
one on one exchange on everybody else's time.

First, you need to discount the inventories - don't use market value ($45 per
kg of raw uranium - 1000 kg per metric ton, and $95 per SWU of enriched
uranium). Yeah, I am being conservative. The uranium is 60% of a year's global
demand, so clearly they can't sell it without destroying the market price. The
market price is $45 a kg. Maybe you already did that because you used $35. I
used a 30% discount, so maybe we got to the same point.

The flaw I perceive in your analysis (which remember, got to the share price as
a decent value with a dividend) is that you're not separating the core
business, which earns $2 a share in free cash flow, from the "hidden asset".
These are completely independent of each other. You are subtracting all the
liabilities of the company from the asset. But that asset has nothing to do
with the liabilities. Put the uranium and SWU inventories aside, the business
stands on its own and earns that $2. So I feel very comfortable saying, "what
is the least $2 of stable but not growing free cash flow is worth?" With
interest rates below 6%, that's $18-20. Then I add to that the $7+ (I think you
can see now how conservatively I am valuing those excess inventories) to get to
$25-27. Your analysis double-counts a billion of liabilities. The stock trades
at 14 1/4 with an 8% yield.

Is the yield safe? The payout ratio is very high based on trailing earnings.
Now the hidden asset starts to become very important. Management is going to
liquidate those inventories, about $150 million a year. What happens when you
sell inventories which are on the balance sheet for half their market price? a)
its pure free cash flow, net of a tax hit (over $1 a share) - there's your
dividend safety, plus a huge share buyback if the business is as stable as I
think it will be; and b) for every kg of uranium liquidated, they book about
$14 of earnings. ($40 per kg market price - $20 per kg book value)*(1 - tax
rate). Voila - this no growth business will show growing earnings - remember,
this earnings source is not in the trailing numbers.

Now how about more? Government operations are not notorious for being run
efficiently. The VP of manufacturing told me face-to-face last week that he can
cut $50 million of cost easily, and that is just the start. Of course unions
will be an obstacle to anything extreme, but there is low-hanging fruit here.
Take that $50 million, tax it at 40% - that's $30 million of incremental
earnings. Give it a 10 P/E and there's another $3 per share. That is not in my
valuation - those are bonus points.

I made USEC my largest investment today, and will double it when I get a feel
for which way it's going to trade (I'm dreaming of a sell-off to 12, because
NOBODY seems to understand what this business is worth). I have enough
conviction in my analysis that I am actually hoping the largest stock in my
portfolio drops 20% so I can buy the rest at lower prices. And I will do so
without hesitation.

Sorry for the long post, but as Mike found out, this one is not simple. But
once the light bulb goes off ("ding!") it becomes very simple. If you intend to
research this investment, may I suggest you print out this exchange between
Mike and I, read the prospectus, then try to develop the story yourself. Do not
buy this unless you do your own homework - hopefully this will be of assistance
in sorting out a very complicated story.

Respectfully,

Jim

more on USEC: you asked what is the management incentive? This was the clincher
for me, when I met management.

[And I know this is getting long winded. Some on the thread say they appreciate
hearing an argument between two value investors about what is going to be a
high profile stock. Others may be bored out of their minds. If you think Mike
and I should do this privately, post such thoughts to me privately and we will
stop.]

Let's get perspective on management. USEC is the government's uranium
enrichment business. In 1993, the Clinton administration decided to go ahead
with privatization, and hired the best and brightest of the private sector to
make the company a real business. The CEO is the former president of General
Dynamics. The head of manufacturing was with ABB. The head of sales was with
Otis Elevator (Allied Signal). These are top-notch executives who had other
alternatives. Why in God's name are they working for USEC? Public service? I
don't think so - these guys are not bureaucrats.

They are in it for the money. They have set themselves up perfectly to get
stock options and make a fortune on an undervalued business. But they made one
crucial error. The government at the last minute said they would not grant
stock options at the offering price, which would make it look like a sweetheart
deal and create a political issue. So, unlike other IPOs, the executives have
to wait six months to get their options priced. So these guys have every
incentive to make this company look like an ugly duckling at the offering, and
for the next six months. Then they announce a huge share buyback, announce cost
reductions and new contracts. That is how I think this plays out.

But understand this. I grilled two executives for an hour and a half last week,
and the strength of the management team is apparent in the prospectus. These
guys are good. Just understand the unusual nature of their incentives.

ONE MORE BIG THING ABOUT USEC
A consortium of three companies, including Lockheed Martin, begged the
government not to do the IPO because they wanted the chance to pay more than
the offering price to acquire the company. This was clearly not their highest
offer, and there were multiple bidders. The government decided to offer it to
the public to avoid the risk of a "Sixty Minutes" story about a government
giveaway to a defense contractor. No political risk in giving it away to the
public and letting small investors make a lot of money. Understand this -
Lockheed Martin understands this business better than anybody - USEC contracts
their labor from Lockheed. So if Lockheed was begging to pay $17-18 this deal,
that should tell you that it is probably worth much more. That said, the
company is now effectively takeover-proof.

I will respond to questions, but this is the last long post.

This situation reminds of Peter Lynch's advice in one of his books on the great
deals to be found in government privatizations. "Whatever the queen is selling,
buy it."

If I remember correctly Barrons had an piece on USEC not too long ago but I
can't find it now. I believe it was negative.

I called the company to get a prospectus today and they told me to call MSDW
which said they don't have a final version yet. It should be available in a few
days. (BTW they only accept faxed or mailed in requests which is a bother for a
individual investor w/o a fax machine.) Meanwhile the S-1 is available online
and the amended version is out too.

Jim, how do you think the suit could affect USEC? And where did you get the
info about the other bidders--is that public? Do you know what institutions are
big buyers (any well known value players)? Thanks and sorry for another post on
the subject to those of you who are sick of it.

PS: Another co. selling at a low multiple of free cash flow is fsc. They are
buying in shares hand over fist.

Re: USU

Thanks James. Buffett once said he wanted such a margin of safety that he
doesn't have to carry it to the nth decimal point. So I was a little loose in
my valuation. It sold SWU for 115 last year, so I figured present value of 90
wasn't too bad for a discount.

You are correct though. Certain of its assets are separate from its business by
and large. As the prospectus states:

Substantially all of the Company's revenue is derived from the sale of uranium
enrichment services, denominated in SWU. Although customers may buy enriched
uranium product without having to supply uranium, virtually all of the
Company's contracts are for enriching uranium provided by customers.

So say, to be conservative, there's $17 in good net assets. Which are truly
separate from the business? Well, to start with, the $1742M in transfers and
current inventories incl. the uranium provided by customers. What liabilities
offset this? Certainly the "Uranium owed to customers" and I'd throw in the
long-term debt and "other liabilities" to be safe. So say $650 million against
the "hidden" assets. Maybe $11/share? Discounted a bit more to maybe $9/share?
Yes, your $7 is very conservative.

And its business is primarily a service business, requiring little asset base
depletion. So that business produces $2 in FCF and pays a $1.10 dividend. And
its current revenue level is fairly well locked-in via its long-term backlog. I
guess you were looking at it as a fair price of $18, or 9 times earnings/FCF
with a 5.x dividend for a now non-growing company. The market is probably
already valuing it off its dividend, thanks to confusion similar to my own. And
7X earnings doesn't seem to bother this market, for companies like this. So
I'll stick with $15.

Ok, so there's at least $24-25 in value. You win. I like it. I wish that I
analyzed all my stocks this close. Good luck with it. I'll try to make room
myself.

I must say that I also hated it because of the IPO, but an IPO on a day the DOW
is down 200? And with this confusing a prospectus? And with people suing to
block the transfer of uranium? Yeah, there's a margin of safety. Now the hope
is that it falls to 11-12 so I can get the business for free. Me buying it now
might help achieve that goal ;)

Good investing,
Mike

Part of your evaluation depends on the value of the inventories. What do you
make of the lawsuit (announced yesterday) by the other Uranium suppliers to
limit the government from augmenting the Uranium inventories of USU ? Seems
like a big unknown in your valuation equation.

Also, what is source of the $17-$18 buyout number?

Finally, it is very common for spinoffs and IPO's not to price the options
right away. They are often priced within 3mo to 12 mo afterward. Look at ICBC,
OTL for example.

BTW I appreciate your commentary on value and the discussion on USU. I am now
investigating and will report if I have anything new to add.

Last question (different topic) but still in the realm of value investing.
Seems as if NH is really taking it on the chin as of late. What are your
thoughts ? I figured I had achieved a good entry at 18.5 but it appears to have
significant downside potential from that point.

Lots of questions - I'll make this brief. The threat from uranium suppliers to
block the transfer of assets is a very important issue, but I have to think
they're too late. The assets have been transferred. Their beef is with the
government, not USEC. And yes, if I were a uranium supplier, I would be mighty
concerned about USEC dumping 8,000 tons a year onto the market. And as for
labor, sure the unions are an issue. My $25-30 valuation does not include the
benefits of any cost cutting - those are just bonus points. But would a strike
hurt? Of course. And the other question was a source for the Lockheed story. It
was public information about 10 days ago when Lockheed reiterated its bid. It
may be listed under Lockheed's ticker. But its not just a Wall Street rumor -
it was a formal announcement from the bidding consortium.

OK, I'm done.

IPTY is a value situation IMO, but is just getting out of the gate.

The facts? Here they are-

--Company is called iParty and plans to capture the party goods and services
market through the internet. ($40 billion U.S. market)

--Website will be launched in late September.

--Jim McCann of 1-800-Flowers is one of the founding shareholders.
--Bob Lessin, well known New York financier and 'tech stock angel' is a
founding shareholder.
--Byron Hero, former CEO of Danskins is now CEO of iParty.
--Sam Belzburg, very rich Vancouver based mogul is on the board of directors.

--Fry-Multimedia is developing the website. Fry, the
commerce data base management partner,
was recently named one of the top twenty web site
builders in the world by Internet Computing magazine.

I think IPTY will be a winner with this kind of management.

Tim,

Actually, I sold out of TBR a few days ago at 121. Several reasons:
1) I needed cash for home repairs
2) My small allotment of shares was way too small to be split
into twelve companies without commissions killing me on any
future exit. Not to mention stretching the limits of my mental
tracking mechanism.

My feeling is that the HOLDrs are temporary and therefore not a good vehicle.
Also, why pay the 1.50/share that my broker wanted. Twelve companies wouldn't
do with my small holdings. And there are a zillion analysts following this
thing. As we hit mid-July, it wasn't looking to zoom higher than 120ish
pre-split. I felt that despite all the indecision, the market was rendering a
verdict - and that verdict was factoring in an expected post-split fall in the
less liquid shares. So I sold - it was a relative decision. I needed to
liquidate about 25%, and I couldn't bear to sell much of anything else in the
portfolio. My plan is to purchase individual babybras as warranted on a value
basis post-split. I too expect there will be quite a spin-off downdraft effect
on the less liquid shares that may create significant opportunity a la MWY. If
we're lucky, even the big ones like telesp may fall with a world bear market.

Good investing,
Mike

Your definition of Free Cash Flow is almost right except that you shouldn't
subtract dividends and you should only subtract maintenance level capital
expenditures -- not those put into projects that aim to expand the business.
Capital spending is the 10-K or annual report. To get maintenance level capital
expenditures you may have to call the company as many don't break out capital
spending in their reports.

The idea is that you want to calculate what money you would be able to take out
of a business without hurting it in the future (thus subtracting only
maintenance level capital expenditures). This is done as if you owned the whole
business and is sometimes called owner earnings. You don't subtract dividends
because those are actually paid to you as an owner. Free cash flow is in one
sense the economic return from an investment and is often mentioned by Buffett
who estimates them in the future and discounts back to the present which is
much tougher to do than get the present figure. He actually claims to value
businesses this way but Munger says he's never seen Warren actaully do one of
these. <G>

See the free cash flow thread.
http://www3.techstocks.com/~wsapi/investor/Subject-17762

The first 30 or so posts are long but very good. Also some of more recent posts

Ali C.: Yes, saw your initial response and saw that you've posted before on the
cash flow thread also. So my reaction was, why does anyone even care about cash
flow itself, not just the capital spending component? The cash flow thread
entertains several different ways of calculating cash flow. But even ignoring
any methodological disagreements there, I saw darn little in the way of stock
recommendations. Too little IMO to keep anyone's interest in the thread.
(Actually, I can't even remember one recommendation.) Now someone posts here to
you that Munger says he never saw Buffett do one of these. Not to say that
Buffett doesn't do them, or do them often. Just making me ever more suspicious
about anyone actually successfully picking, holding, selling stocks based on
DCF, free cash flow, etc. Paul Senior

Discounted cash flow forecasts are absolutely the right way to value a stock in
theory. But as my favorite business school professor told me, "In theory a
giraffe shouldn't be able to walk, but it does."

I was an investment banker for four years, and spent many an allnighter
creating ever more elaborate DCF models. Now that I am actually buying these
companies, though, I consider that analysis an absolute waste of time because
it is so sensitive to the slightest change in inputs. I have no delusions that
I can forecast most of the businesses I own for two years, let alone 20. That
is what Graham teaches me - when you buy at a low enough price, it doesn't
matter if you're off by 20%, you still make a lot of money.

That said, though, free cash flow is the most critical concept in investing.
Wall Street is obsessed with EPS and quarterly earnings forecasts, which I just
consider silly. But really, that is all anybody talks about.
1. You can doctor earnings, but you can't fake free cash flow
2. You can't spend earnings

Take a look at Sunbeam's financials for the last three years. The company had
an earnings turnaround, but free cash flow stayed negative. It should have
surprised nobody when the story fell apart.
