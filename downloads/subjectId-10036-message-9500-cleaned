Portraying Buffett as a technophobe is rather silly. I believe he's said that
he cannot look out 10 years and guestimate the ROC(E) for a given tech company
with any margin of safety. He's never said that GEICO or any other captive
company cannot USE technology. I'm willing to bet that Buffett was playing
bridge across the net before many of the posters here were even aware of the
WWW.

GEICO is doing something rather simple: they are burning $1-200 million in
airway advertising to raise their market share from 2% to 10%. It's a commodity
market where GEICO can be the lowest priced producer. Whether customers use an
800 number or http:// is irrelevant. The important thing is the name GEICO
(it's no longer Government Employees Insurance Company, just GEICO).

I think that what's been weighing down BRK are the former GNR shareholders who
figured that they've been snookered, and some of the cultists who have jumped
the Omaha Express to ride Netopia. Maybe there'll be some empty seats in the
Aksarben this year.

Is anyone still following VAR? Since I mentioned it earlier this year it has
recently climbed up to ~30. Almost double. Currently they are trying to place
themselves into the emerging brachytherapy treatment for Coronary Artery
Disease. They have signed an agreement with Cordis (J&J subsidiary) to provide
them with brachytherapy systems to sell. Cordis is a major provider of coronary
stents and are positioning themselves for this new procedure. Once the method
of application for this new procedure is decided (gamma vs. beta emitter), I
believe that it will replace the current standard; angioplasty. If Varian is
successful, this could be a new avenue of growth for them beyond their
traditional capital equipment product line. Any opinions?

LAU: BRK - Good points on Selling by GenRe holders - probably a more important
near term issue impacting share price.
GIECO advertising is attention getting and entertaining and I agree that they
are leveraging low-cost producer position - with a low-price based
appeal/position. Near term this works well because they're direct approach
supports it well. The problem comes later in the game when all players migrate
to net. Who will intermediate the market: Individual players like Gieco or
infomediaries like insuremarket?
And what happens to profitability when several large players with net based
direct cost structures are a click away - it's a change in industry structure
coming closer to pure competition that impacts absolute profitability even
though BRK may still be lower cost producer.
In this environment, you want a brand differentiated on qualitative rather than
price to get higher margins than dumbest direct competitor.
WEB isn't a total technophobe - the existing GIECO site attests to this, but
will he and the GIECO team be able to position the brand and operating
activities in this new environment?
Don't get me wrong, I'm lately [& lightly] long and hoping for the best - but
strategic positioning in net-driven environment is major concern for long-term
value.

Bob, in view of your self-generated "sell" signal on EBSC, I am reevaluating
<ggg>. While I agree on the value buyer comment I am skeptical that this
particular stock would attract yearend bounce traders (who are now kicking it
out).

I am also perplexed as hell as to where the company buyback is. I decided to
test it by offering some at 5 3/16 when the market was plunging earlier,
figuring I could replace it lower. I left the order in for about 1/2 hour, with
no takers, before canceling. It was worth buying over a million shares at an
average 6 1/2, but not worth being as aggressive as possible near 5 with the 3
million shares remaining on the existing authorization?! I don't get it.

Paul, yes I am buying some insurance stocks. There are so many cheap ones out

I have been buying brk (of course) now 70% insurance as you know. I am also
building a long term position in Progressive, which just gets cheaper (read
goes down alot) <g>. I also have been buying White Mountains (WTM) a small New
Hampshire based holding company that John Bryne spun out of American Express a
number of years back. He still holds a big chunk but is no longer chairman. WTM
has a controlling interest in FSA, a neat little municipal insurer, a la Jame's
Ambac. I think FSA is a buy here too.

One of my favorite little ideas is STFC, which is a medium sized auto insurer
that's just a cut below Geico and Progressive in terms of quality. Because of
pooling arrangements, it has a built in growth profile that makes the economics
quite compelling here. It trades at about $9 which is it's book value. This is
real quality at the right price.

OK - I ran the numbers on QQQ (which is the largest 100 stocks in the Nasdaq,
give or take). Some really interesting insights into the valuations of the
"other half" of the market if you bear with me for a few minutes.

First of all, let me just get my two cents in on the "crash" today. That
"corrected" the Nasdaq 100 all the way back to the level it traded at the last
week of December. Yes, December 1999. You might remember it - it was last week.
I have to laugh when the same TV commentators who were saying "It might be due
for a correction" last week are now saying "It might be a buying opportunity"
at the exact same price level. I shorted the damned thing in early December,
and this price doesn't feel "correct" to me.

Anyway, I took as an approximation for the Nasdaq 100 the top 100 Nasdaq market
caps as of December 31st. Then I aggregated the earnings (and just as
important, losses) of the component companies and calculated the ratios based
on a market cap weighted index investment. Here they are:

Trailing 12 P/E 133
CY 1999E P/E 129
CY 2000E P/E 96
Price/Sales 13.5
Price/Book 17

Disagregating the index leads to the following observations:

Here are the biggest 11 stocks with their respective P/Es for 1999 and 2000.
These eleven make up 60% of the market cap in the top 100. WHAT FASCINATES ME
IS THAT ALL THE EARNINGS ARE IN THESE ELEVEN STOCKS. THE NEXT 89 COMPANIES
COMBINED EARN NOTHING. ZERO.

Microsoft 75x, 66x
Cisco 123x, 96x
Intel 36x, 31x
Oracle 114x, 90x
MCI/Worldcom 40x , 28x
Dell 70x, 50x
Sun Micro 99x, 77x
Qualcomm 231x, 162x
Yahoo 983x, 627x
Amgen 62x, 55x
Applied Mat. 52x, 36x

Thats about as much work as I have ever done on the tech sector. I remain
uncomfortably short QQQ and a little AMZN. I also added a TGLO short today at 9
with a stop loss at a little under 10. I think the risk-reward is in my favor
there if the business is as worthless as I think it is.

And here is a bit of humor the thread might appreciate: yesterday GM broke off

December. Once the news hit the stock collapsed. To head off the bleeding the
CEO released a statement claiming that the end of the deal would not have a

for the dynamism of this bull market in general and the technology sector in

valuation back in the 50's when it first got going. Well we have lot's of

Jim - QQQ: My numbers and methods differ. I took the components as listed on
Yahoo http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s= @^ndx&d=v4
Downloaded in spreadsheet format. When I tried to get weighted average PE's
using nasdaq's weightings the numbers didn't work because extreme PE's skewed
the average. So I converted PE's to earnings yields, took this times market
caps to get earnings. Then took aggregate earnings and compared to aggregate
market cap. For forward estimates, I took Barrons 12/31 IBES EPS estimates
converted to PE's, Earnings yields, and earnings as above.
Looking at your data, I found one error in mine - Qualcom estimates hadn't been
split-adjusted by Barrons since split occurred 12/30..I made the adjustment
The top 11 were same as yours except Ericson instead of Amat - for
comparability I replaced Ericson with Amat
My summary stats:
top 11 current PE 78 [2,184.7B Mcap/27.86B Earn]
top 11 forward PE 53 [2,184.7B Mcap/41.36B Earn]

Lower 89 Market caps:
current PE 98 [994.3B Mcap/10.15B Earn]
forward PE 67 [994.3B Mcap/14.8B Earn]
I'm a bit iffy on the period that Yahoo used for earnings list shown in the
above link, and of course there's potential for errors there.
Nothing in the above should be construed to indicate that I disagree with your
conclusions that QQQ components are way over-valued, I just doubt that the
index is as overvalued as I had initially thought [and as your numbers
indicate] thus the sureness of the short went away [At precisely the wrong

perennial underperformer. Worse, Laidlaw still owns 43% of the shares and
indicated last fall that they wanted to sell. This share overhang would depress
the price in and of itself. If the used offal market is crummy as well, this

And that was before I read Lau's post on the Laidlaw angle. I know this one
from researching Laidlaw a couple years ago. Generally speaking, if a business

Sales push with rising AR's indicate they got as close to 'channel stuffing' as
a service co can this quarter
Seasonality - current quarter is usually weaker
Cyclicality - Activity begets waste as higher rates raise concerns this co
would have a bit of a headwind
Unconfirmed indication that market is shrinking by 5% annually due to
conservation waste prevention methods - maybe customers are recycling thier own
stuff - oil, dry-cleaning etc
History - Red ink for several years and reverse split indicate all is not well
Morale - employees seem dispirited, defensive, internal competition, little
faith in upper management [Small sample but fits with other info]
No strategic buyer and financial buyer won't want to play problem-solving role
unless it's dirt cheap - [as Lau pointed out, Laidlaw is pushing for a sale]

Allen Furlan: re. TEXP. Should work out for you, I'd say. Might work as a
straight deal also for someone who wants a position in this business. From your
linked Marketwatch article, there will be $800-900 million in assets for the
new company (which is net---before the 90 million of expected debt is added) of
which TEXP gets a claim to 35%, resulting in TEXP having an asset claim of
$280M (on the lower $800M figure). That for TEXP which has a market cap now of
$179M. Looks like a pretty good deal to me (based on the numbers-- but who
knows if Marketwatch is correct). Also many of these oil companies often sell
below their asset value so I'm not confident in my conclusion that TEXP would
be a good buy at current 4 7/8. Your writing of calls would seem to be the best

Wallace, to try to answer your question about LIFO vs. FIFO:
"Intercompany comparisons of inventory turnover do not provide valid
comparisons when the companies are using different inventory methods, e.g.,
FIFO and LIFO, since the cost of goods sold and inventory under LIFO during
periods of rising prices will be higher and lower, respectively, than under
FIFO." from Financial Statement Analysis by Charles J. Woelfel. I'll let you
interpret that, but I would say that it does not sound as if one method is
inherently inferior, just different. Of course, there may be other

showed up at 12:04 at 5 5/16 and was not content to sit there, but marched it
up to 5 15/32 by the end of the day. It looks like he did not get much, did you

Interesting, and not surprising to me, that the stock is trading better after

I think this is one of those times where we are having a sharp tech stock
correction that was overdue, and will be blamed on any number of
factors, none of which are really critical fundamental factors. Prices just got
too high and any reason will do for a correction that was going to happen
anyway.

If I am correct in my view, many tech stock prices will recover some or all of
their losses after this decline is over.

BKE has been on my watch list for awhile.

I never pulled the trigger for a reason which may be irrational to some. I do
not approve of the compensation plan. To rich. I think I get burned more
frequently by greedy executives than by non greedy. plus I do not approve of
the ethics.

And perhaps fraught with a problem. If they improve profit over the preceding
year they get a huge increase. But even decreases get a bonus. For example, a
20% decrease in pre bonus income earnes a 75% of base salary bonus. You grow
income by 20%, you get 200%. Ugly. Excessive. Not for me. And might someone
manipulate the numbers to maximize their income by fluctuating net income? 50%
increase gets 360% of base salary. hmmmm. I see motivation to hold back or take
a profit hit in year one and zoom profits in year 2.

Regardless of the manipulation (pure speculation) I think it is excessive and
will not buy it.

thanks peter51. I've seen BKE recommended by some value investors. I like that
BHE has rising sales, very good roe, no debt, low pe. I'm always somewhat
skeptical about investing in these fashion shops. When fashions change and they
have markdowns and/or the stock drops, I start to feel they will never recover
(I've owned a few that never did). And when business is good - and even with
BKE where they can show a consistently good record - these companies still make
me uncomfortable because I always suspect their misstep is coming. So unless
some other people on this thread like it, I'll just pass on BKE.

One stock in the fashion business I am monitoring is Bon-Ton Stores. Their
numbers are not as good as Buckle's. Sales are about level for past few years.
There's increasing debt, roe stinks --- gee maybe I SHOULD at least be
monitoring and reevaluating BKE--g--- but p/book, psr look pretty good even
considering the debt level. I notice insider buying here too. Interesting thing
is that couple of insiders who sold at 7+ range are now buying again in 4-5
range. Stock, now at 4, is about 1/2 point away from as low as it's ever been
(since '92)

One stock in the fashion business I have taken a very small position in is
Tommy Hilfiger (TOM). Here we have a rapidly and hugely growing company - and
taking on debt, increasing the shares outstanding. And while growth will slow
(I expect) and ROE is decreasing, so also are the price/sales and p/earnings. I
am betting TOM @21 or so (close to its 3 year low), is too low for the expected
sales and earnings going forward.

JMO, and I've been wrong many, many times before.

Paul Senior and LauA - On BKE, I share your concerns about fashion, but what
makes this different from your typical fashion company is two things. First,
they buy branded merchandise rather than private label their own styles, so you
don't need for them to always be right on fashion, you just need them to buy
from the right people whether it is Tommy Jeans or Doc Martin Shoes. Second
they operate in small towns, so there is less competition on the branded
fashion front. There just aren't that many places to get Tommy clothes in their
markets. I agree with the concerns about cash comp, but family does owns 60% so
the bottom line is that management is incredibly aligned with us.

Defense would depend on expected length of correction, extent of inflation

Short term, be off margin. Ride correction through with good stocks. (Worked

Cash to buy bargains. Don't care that much short term about devaluation in my

RE: Defensive Positions & Value Ideas

I have been buying TPL (Texas Pacific Land Trust) at $38 to $40 as a defensive
position and to provide a counterweight to one oversized tech position (DSTM).
This is an asset value buy, not a growth buy.

TPL owns some of the worst land in the country: 1.06 million acres of West
Texas ranch land, mostly carried on its books at no value.

TPL in a nutshell:
- 0.405 acres of land per share
- Oil & gas rights on a much smaller no. of acres.
- $0.40 dividend (1%)
- $1.08 cash / share
- $3.45 receivables / share (land sold in past, financed)
- Permanent (100+ years old) share buyback program
(typically 2.5% to 3.5% of shares retired per year).
- Income from oil & gas royalties from owned & sold land.
(income has varied from $1.10 to $2.40 per share per year)

The current TPL price ($37.75) values their land at around $82 per acre.

TPL has limited upside. My target is around $60 during the next year. Oil & gas
income should improve since the price of oil has increased, but there is a time
lag before TPL sees the improvement. I am buying TPL as an asset play, not
based on oil & gas speculation.

TPL has limited downside, based on land value. Look at the 10 year chart to get
a better feel for historical prices. The worst case I can picture is for TPL to
stagnate in the $30's for a couple years. Best case is a double to around $75.

TPL may have some use as an inflation hedge also.

Also, every few months some market prognosticator "discovers" TPL and mentions
it in the media (Dick Davis Digest, CNBC, etc.), and it will spike for a time.
This has happened several times over the past two years.

Comments welcome.

plays. Mindful of Paul Senior's wise counsel ("buy a basket of these things",

I didn't delve far into CTO because I already own Florida real estate plays
(JOE & FLA).

Most of the other land plays have at least some hope of turning into a
development. TRC is one hour North of LA on Interstate 5. JOE owns 30 miles of
Florida gulf coast. TPL owns...grazing land!

But I was reminded of your comment about buying crap at half the going rate for

$82 an acre seems really really really cheap no matter where the land is.

I disagree with that rule of thumb. Take a look at PICO. They are the current
owner of Nevada Land & Resource, which owns ~1.4 million acres of northern
Nevada along the I-80 from Reno to Salt Lake. This land came from one of those
railroad land grants to Central Pacific RR (one of the 'golden spike') players
and looks like a checkerboard along the Humboldt River valley. It was the site
of an 1870's land rush when sodbusters from Omaha and St. Louis didn't realize
that the river was running only because it was the one decade in the Millenium
that it would rain in Northern Nevada.

This checkerboard got passed among railroads until Santa Fe sold it to a public
water company in 1994/5 as a predicate to its merger with Burlington Northern.
The sale price was $32/acre. It included water rights, microwave and fiber
optic cable stations, lots of freeway interchanges, and far-as-the-eye-can-see
chaparral. The river runs east to west, and ends in a wet-year lake that really
is a sink hole. It crosses the Carlin Trend, abuts major gold mining districts,
and includes large geothermal fields.

To date, I would credit Santa Fe as the winner in this transaction despite the
fact that PICO, the current owner, is flogging it as an undervalued asset,
carried on the books at $36/acre.

Remember, land has carrying costs - taxes, insurance, etc. Renting range land
to ranchers who require X # acres per steer, just isn't a very profitable
business. One Burns Brothers Truck Stop, at one interchange, gives a higher
total return, than the entire property. I'd rather own a piece of Burns
Brothers, but the Burns Brothers don't want me.

From:Wright Sullivan

Lau-

You have proven one of my points wrong. I said that TPL owns some of the worst
land in this country. It sounds like Nevada Land & Resource has them beat by
half.

TPL's land came to them in the exact same fashion: A checkerboard grant (each
checker is 640 acres) made in the 1870's to the Texas & Pacific Railroad.

In 1998, TPL made approximately $5,500,000 from oil & gas royalties, grazing
leases, easements, and other income. In addition to this, they sold $5,000,000
worth of land and used the proceeds to buy back shares and fund the 1%
dividend. This is their standard operating procedure. (TPL market cap is
roughly $100 million).

Even if these numbers fluctuate, there's at least some income here.

As I said, this is not a growth play. But one can look at TPL's 10 or 20 year
chart and get some idea of whether it is low or high relative to its past
valuation. Not much has changed with TPL during that period, except that they
have sold some land and bought back some shares (3.5%/year).

I don't know if $82/acre is cheap or not in West Texas. But at least most of
TPL's income comes from oil & gas (less than 10% is from grazing leases). So
there's a bit more to TPL than bad land at $82/acre.

I find it interesting that all of these land companies and REIT's are moving
down in lockstep, yet I can't find a lot of correlation between the
fundamentals of, JOE and TPL, for example. In theory, TPL should move somewhat
with the price of oil, and should decline if raw land prices are declining. But
I don't see raw land prices dropping through the floor where I live (S.C.), and
the price of oil is not low. Basically, land prices appear to be holding steady
while TPL and its kin are dropping.

JOE and CTO are much more interesting as long-term holdings, in addition to the
improvements of short-term rationalization. With both of these, there is the
opportunity for substantial growth as Florida grows. The coming retirement of
the baby boomers adds an element of inevitability, though we may be talking
about a 15 year timeframe here. Most people today have trouble with a 15 month
timeframe.

Your point with respect to Burns Brothers clearly highlights the danger here.
With many of these land plays, there isn't much of an operating business to
provide long term returns. Crap at half the going rate is still crap, and will
continue to be crap 10 years from now. But at some price it is a value play,
which is what I am after, along with a margin of safety which is no longer
present in some of my other investments.

There may be better ways to achieve this result, but a small TPL position looks
like a safe side bet to me now.

I appreciate your perspective.

Additional info on value of TPL land:

- Avg price of TPL land sold in 1998 was $157/acre.
- However, the vast majority of TPL's acreage is remote ranch land (they also
own a smattering of land in El Paso).
- Average price of ten 1998 TPL land sales for ranching purposes was $61/acre
(these sales are included in the overall average of $157/acre).

Based on the above, $82/acre may not be far from fair value for the land alone,
but this does not take into account the oil & gas royalties which exist
separate from the "surface rights", which are what is sold.

When 1999 annual report comes out in the next few weeks, I'll update these
numbers.

"CRY.TO has a Value of $40.4 per share says Vectorvest"
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=12508797
=======
Free Stock Analysis of Cryptologic by Vectorvest at their web site type in
symbol CRY.TO. Here is what their current Stock Analysis of Cryptologic Inc

Thank you for requesting an analysis of Cryptologic Inc from VectorVest
ProGraphics. The ticker symbol for Cryptologic Inc is CRY.TO. CRY.TO is traded
on Toronto Stock Exchange.

PRICE: CRY.TO closed on 01/07/2000 at $24.95 per share.

VALUE: CRY.TO has a Value of $40.4 per share. Value is the foundation of the
VectorVest system. It is a measure of what a stock is currently worth. Value is
based upon earnings, earnings growth rate, dividend payments, dividend growth
rate, and financial performance. Current interest and inflation rates also play
an important role in the computation of Value. When interest and/or inflation
rates decrease, Value goes up. When interest rates and inflation increase,
Value goes down. Sooner or later a stock's Price and Value always converge.

RV (Relative Value): CRY.TO has an RV of 1.4. On a scale of 0.00 to 2.00, an RV
of 1.4 is excellent. RV reflects the long-term price appreciation potential of
the stock compared to an alternative investment in AAA Corporate Bonds. Stocks
with RV ratings above 1.00 have attractive upside potential. A stock will have
an RV greater than 1.00 when its Value is greater than Price, and its Relative
Safety (see below) and forecasted earnings growth rate are above average. In
some cases, however, a stock's RV will be above 1.00 even though its Value is
well below Price. This happens when a stock has an exemplary record of
financial performance and an above average earnings growth rate. In this case,
the stock is currently selling at a premium, and the investor is banking on
future earnings growth to drive the stock's price higher. This information is
very useful not only in knowing whether or not a stock has favorable price
appreciation potential, but it also solves the riddle of whether to buy high
growth, high P/E, or low growth, low P/E stocks.

We believe that RV ratings above 1.00 are required to consistently achieve
above average capital gains in the stock market.

RS (Relative Safety): CRY.TO has an RS rating of 0.88. On a scale of 0.00 to
2.00, an RS of 0.88 is poor. VectorVest looks at safety from the viewpoint of
an equity investor (one who is buying stock of a company) rather than that of a
purchaser of debt (one who is lending money to the company). From this
perspective, consistency of financial and operating performance, stock price
appreciation history, and price volatility are the key factors used in the
evaluation of Relative Safety (RS). Debt to equity ratio, capitalization, sales
volume, business longevity and other factors are also considered, but to a
lesser degree.

VectorVest favors steady, predictable performers. All stocks are rated on a
scale of 0.00 to 2.00. A stock with an RS greater than 1.00 is safer and more
predictable than the average of all stocks. A stock with an RS less than 1.00
is less predictable and riskier than the average stock.

RT (Relative Timing): CRY.TO has an RT rating of 1.19. On a scale of 0.00 to
2.00, an RT of 1.19 is good. RT is a fast, responsive, short-term price trend
indicator. It analyzes the direction, magnitude, and dynamics of a stock's
price behavior over the last 13 weeks; then reflects and projects the
short-term price performance of the stock. Once a stock's Price has established
a strong trend, it is expected to continue that trend for the short-term. If
the trend dissipates, RT will gravitate towards 1.00. Should the price change
dramatically, RT will notice the crucial turning point. When warranted, it will
explode from a Price low and dive from a Price high.

All stocks are rated on a scale of 0.00 to 2.00. If RT is above 1.00,the
stock's Price is in an uptrend. Below 1.00, the stock's Price is in a
downtrend.

VST-Vector (VST): CRY.TO has a VST-Vector rating of 1.14. On a scale of 0.00 to
2.00, an VST of 1.14 is good. VST-Vector solves the dilemma of balancing Value,
Safety and Timing. Stocks with high RV values often have low RS values, or
stocks withlow RV and RS values have high RT's. How can we find the stocks with
the best combinations of Value, Safety, and Timing?

The classic vector formula (square root of the sum of the squares) handles this
problem. It combines a set of forces into a single indicator for ranking every
stock in the VectorVest database. Stocks with the highest VST-Vector have the
best combinations of Value, Safety and Timing. These are the ones to own for
above average capital application.

GRT (Growth Rate): CRY.TO has a GRT of 24 % per year. This is excellent. GRT
stands for forecasted Earnings Growth Rate in percent per year. GRT is updated
each week for every stock. Watch GRT trends very carefully. If the GRT trend is
up, the stock's Price will likely rise. If the GRT trend is down, the stock's
Price will increase more slowly, cease to increase, or subsequently fall.

Recommendation (REC): CRY.TO has a Buy recommendation. REC reflects the
cumulative effect of all the VectorVest parameters working together. These
parameters are designed to help investors buy safe, undervalued stocks which
are rising in price, and to avoid or sell risky, overvalued stocks which are
falling in price.

VectorVest is tuned to give an "H" or "B" signal when a stock's price is
approximately 10% above a recent low, and an "S" signal when the stock's price
is approximately 10% below a recent high. High RV, RS stocks are favored toward
receiving "B" REC's, and sheltered from receiving "S" RECs.

STOP-PRICE: CRY.TO has a Stop-Price of 23.30 per share. This is 1.65 or 6.6%
belowits current closing Price. VectorVest analyzes over 6,000 stocks each day
for Value, Safety and Timing, and calculates a Stop-Price for each stock. These
Stop-Prices are based upon 13 week moving averages of closing prices, and are
fine-tuned according to each stock's fundamentals.

In the VectorVest system, a stock gets a "B" or an "H" recommendation if its
price is above its Stop-Price, and an "S" recommendation if its price is below
its Stop-Price.

DIV (Dividend): CRY.TO does not pay a dividend. VectorVest focuses on annual,
regular, cash dividends indicated by the most recent disbursement. Special
distributions, one-time payments, stock dividends, etc., generally are not
included in Dividend (DIV).

DY (Dividend Yield): CRY.TO has a DY of 0 percent. This is above the current
market average of percent. DY equals 100 x (DIV/PRICE), and is expressed as a
percentage.

EY (Earnings Yield): CRY.TO has an EY of 6.88%. This is above the current
market average of %. EY equals 100 x (EARNINGS PER SHARE/PRICE), and is
expressed as a percentage.

EPS (Earnings Per Share): CRY.TO has an EPS of $1.72 per share. EPS stands for
leading 12 months Earnings Per Share. VectorVest determines this forecast from
a combination of recent earnings performance and traditional fiscal and/or
calendar year earnings forecasts.

P/E (Price to Earnings Ratio): CRY.TO has a P/E ratio of 14.51. This ratio is
computed daily based upon Price and EPS. P/E = Price/EPS.

GPE (Growth to P/E Ratio): CRY.TO has a GPE of 1.65. This ratio suggests that
This ratio suggests that CRY.TOis undervalued. Growth to P/E ratio is a popular
measure of stock valuation which compares Earnings Growth Rate (GRT) to Price
Earnings ratio (P/E). A stock is considered to be undervalued when GPE is
greater than 1.00, and vice-versa. VectorVest believes that RV is a much better
indicator of long-term value. The RV of 1.4 for CRY.TOis excellent.

DS (Dividend Safety): CRY.TO has a DS of 0. On a scale of 0 to 99, a DS of 0 is
poor. DS is defined as the assurance that regular cash dividends will be
declared and paid at current or at higher rates for the foreseeable future.
Stocks with DS values above 50 on a scale of 0 to 99 areabove average in
safety.

RISK (Dividend Risk): CRY.TO does not pay a dividend. All stocks in the
VectorVest system that pay dividends are classified as having Low, Medium or
High Dividend Risk (RISK). Stocks with DS values above 50 are above average in
safety. These stocks are classified as having LOW or MEDIUM RISK. Stocks with
DS values below 50 are below average in safety and are classified as having
HIGH Risk.

DG (Dividend Growth): CRY.TO has a DG of 0 percent per year. Dividend Growth is
a subtle yet important indicator of a company's historical financial
performance and the board's current outlook on the future use of funds.

YSG-VECTOR (Yield-Safety-Growth Vector): CRY.TO has a YSG-Vector of 0. On a
scale of 0.00 to 2.00, an YSG-Vector rating of 0 is very poor. VectorVest
combines Dividend YIELD, SAFETY and GROWTH into a single parameter. YSG-Vector
allows direct comparison of all dividend paying stocks. Stocks with the highest
YSG-Vector values have the best combinations of Dividend Yield, Safety and
Growth. These are the stocks to buy for above average current income and
long-term growth.

VOL(100)s: CRY.TO traded 26800 shares on 01/07/2000.

AVG VOL(100)s: CRY.TO has an Average Volume of 27900. Average Volume is 50 day
moving average of daily volume as computed by VectorVest.

% VOL: CRY.TO had a Volume change of -3.8% from its 50 day moving average
volume.

OPEN: CRY.TO opened trading at $23.25 per share on 01/07/2000.

HIGH: CRY.TO traded at a high of $24.95 per share on 01/07/2000.

LOW: CRY.TO traded at a low of $23.25 per share on 01/07/2000.

CLOSE: CRY.TO Closed trading at $24.95 per share on 01/07/2000.

% PRC: CRY.TO showed a Price change of 6.2% from the prior day's closing price.

INDUSTRY: CRY.TOhas been assigned to the Internet (E:Commerce) Group.
VectorVest classifies stocks into over 190 Industry Groups and 50 Business
Sectors.

CRY.TO has below average safety with well above average upside potential. It
reflects a stock which is likely to give well above average, inconsistent
returns over the long term.

The basic strategy of VectorVest is to buy low risk, high reward stocks. We
suggest that Prudent investors buy enough high Relative Value, high Relative
Safety stocks to keep the overall RV and RS ratings of their portfolios above
1.00. As you do this, you'll find that your risk will go down and your
investment performance will improve. Not a bad combination.

Hmmm....certainty and net nets. That isn't the assumption underlying any given
net net. The idea is a large basket will yield good returns. Any given net net
may be worthless/fail spectacularly.

Twister - re: CTO; I doubt that Buffett has flipped it. If you calculate his
ownership in CTO from his ownership in Baker, Fentress, you will see that
according to his filings last fall, he owns 100,000 more shares than the
calculation indicates. I took this to mean that he had independently bought
that much extra CTO. These REIT filings are for his personal holdings, not
BRKa. I don't believe he has that 18 month deal with the SEC to keep secret
personal ownership. If he flipped, he'd have to report in a timely fashion.

I also agree with Mike Burry that Net-Nets are a statistical phenomenon where
gains occur in aggregate, offsetting losers. Individually, it's a crap shoot.
When I buy those and January Effect stocks, I always refer to them as a
wastebasketful. Most have significant problems to be priced the way they are.
The buyout arbitrage stuff is the same. Not all will work out.

There was a time many years ago when Wells Fargo published a list of stocks in
the S+P 500 that were considered to be below investment grade. Someone
constructed a "not in Wells Fargo" portfolio - an equal dollar investment in
ALL of these stocks, and found that it outperformed the S+P every year. What
happened was that most stock prices stayed the same. A few went bankrupt. One
or two recovered to become 10 baggers. These occasional winners provided the
entire profit. It appeared impossible to a priori decide which ones would do
the big turnaround. So you had to fill up the whole wastebasket.

good work on the filing. It's almost as if he's returning to his roots. He
always goes where the value is, wherever it is. <g>

I understand the concept that many net-nets are better than one. I don't even
like many of them. <g>

keep up the great work.

me. I also am making a bet that oil will trend down.

Twister, "I don't even like many of them" heads in my direction. I don't buy
basketsful of anything. If over 30 years of sophisticated investor experience
does not count for anything in selecting a moderate number of the stocks I
believe will deliver excellent returns, I might as well hang it up. I buy few
stocks and hold them a long time and everyone had something special which
"caught my eye" when I bought it - and some are mistakes.

Quite honestly, I've never heard of MAIR before you mentioned it, and won't

LUV, well, I guess I like Herb Kelleher, the business plan, the recently
announced load factors. As I stated before, I am betting on at least a modest
drop in oil prices, plus the LUV chart says it performs well going into late
spring and summer.

I have now flown MAIR twice and both times flight was delayed because of

to save money are good long term investments and as a consumer I have decided
to stay away from NOrthwest which used MAIR to operate this particular flight.

Jeffrey, I agree with you. I think it makes a lot of sense to do real business

two methods, as James and the other thread participants do, you are really

Seems to me that the issue of buying 'baskets' of stocks is a statistical
method to plow around the fact that linear analysis fails in a non-linear
system. Some would call it 'setting your net wide'. Successful practitioners
might include Graham-Newman Corp, Walter Schloss, and Peter Lynch.

Hagstrom has called attention to focus investing, which in my argot might be
termed 'setting your net narrow'. The Hagstrom set of focus investors includes
Keynes, Buffett, Munger, Ruane, and Simpson. His 1999 book credits none of
these "Superinvestors of Buffettville" with more than 27 years of performance.

Jeffrey,

MAIR - Took position after I saw you mention. The companies growth record,
strong financial position, reported increase in business this Q, etc. Feel BV
understated from depreciated assets.

Will be looking at it further to add if numbers continue to look good.

Ron, on MAIR, I did not intend to suggest purchase, but that it be considered
as an alternative to LUV. I own neither, but think both are somewhat
interesting.

..........

As far as buying lots of stocks versus fewer goes, I have posted before that I
believe that owning lots of stocks tends to deliver average returns and that
none of them then can be monitored as well as I want to do for all of them.

I did not make 10 times on my money on XICO last year by not listening to every
conference call, reading every piece of info I could get my hands on, being
very active on the threads, talking with mgmt and others close to the company,
etc. Those opportunities do not come along very often and you just can't know
they are staring you in the face unless you follow a company with that kind of
effort.

LauA. Yes, that kind of sums it up. I don't follow your point though about
crediting no superinvestor with more than 27 years experience. That's a "huh?"
for me. -g-

I wish I knew what truth was. Or even purpose. I've got 30+ years investing and
it's taught me to diversify. Here, this discussion on this thread, if the
purpose is to help each other or figure out what works, what is most helpful,
then is there one value investing style that is better/best? If purpose is to
make a reasonable return is one way better than another? If purpose is to get
rich is concentration the best route? Should concentration/diversification
change as investing experience or lifestyle life goals change? I have no
answers.

There's something else also tied into the diversification/concentration
discussion. Certainly, the time that must be devoted to an analysis of each
situation.
But the variables which are significant in making the investing buy and sell
decisions are different too.
Which suggests that there is some basis for thread readers to give extra
attention to a particular stock when different style value investors reach the
same positive conclusion about it. We talk of the 3 thread buyer rule, for
example.

recently announced acquisitions and/or liquidations?

WEB has gotten involved in a number of these situations that after the fact
were obviously good ideas. However, I had no way of finding out about them
early on.
