Thank you, Jeff

On software wage increase, I think you have not noticed the full automation
which is coming. Firms like Select in Red Bank, NJ has been doing that for
couple of years already. I think they first write a script of what programs you
want to fully exploit. Then, the program will be used to give you the answers
(object tech). Microsoft still has a few years to go; they only have wizards
and not applying automation to change wizards to work flow. More wages for more
automation programing.

Inflation is now controlled by 10% over production; or in services, 10% over
capacity. This economical policy has been carried out since 1992. That is the
reason why we have 5 years of good economy and still going on. Shortages in
manpower will be compensated by automation and re-employment of elderlies.
Notice how the older people move around in supermarkets; They can all do
programing if computers are $500-1000 each. Some even took jobs in supermarkets
and department stores now (social security 1996 has 60 rather than 50 billion
dollar surplus). We all know the 70's zero population growth problems; it has
been changed now.

Hi Jeff, haven't had time to read all the posts, so forgive me if I'm
duplicating another post, but American Sensors (SNIFF) looks promising. They
make home early warning detection systems (carbon monoxide detectors is a major
product). Last six months' sales is $47 million and the market cap is about $18
mil.

They are currently not profitable and last quarter's sales were down, and
expenses way up, as a result of a transition to a new battery-powered product
line. But it is a growth area and the stock is trading dirt cheap.

As far as I can tell the PSR is WELL under 0.5, and it trades below book. Some
other savvy investors on SI picked up on this one. I would look for good
results from this one if you're not looking for them next week. I think they
might be rewarded down the road for keeping their products at the cutting edge
although it has created operating losses. The whole home security area is a
growth field and people are only beginning to understand the danger of CO in
the home.

Justin, there was an article in Individual Investor back around the summer and
it stated that Buffett had purchased NVLS (Novellus) and WDFC (WD-40). As you
stated it was around 45, and now like you said it is 89. WDFC has been up about
5. If anybody knows any other stocks Buffett has purchased in the last year or
any he purchases in the future, I would appreciate it if you would post them
here. I know sometime last year he purchased McDonald's (MCD)

Thank you, Jim

Believe it or not, in recommanding stocks; people say buy when the stock pulls
back. In blue sky prospectus, you have to have disclaimers so that you don't
get law suits. Buffet's winning ways is analysed as focus on good companies
with good management, and have large cash pool at the brokerage that makes a
market for your stock. Ie. Salomon Bros. and their programmed trading. US Air
gave Buffet some problems. Buffet had to have Disney merge with ABC. If you
imitate his style of investing; you can not succeed because you are dependant
on some one else to make a market( specialists only do 11% of the NYSE stocks,
they are no longer in control of the market). Value investing today, is to own
a company that has a technical advantage. Management has to have proven long
term outlook on technology. And productivity improvements at all times,
otherwise stock will not go up because earnings will be dormant.

From:Jim Garrison

Arthur: Don't misunderstand what Buffet was saying - he wasn't doing the
disclaimer bit. He indicated that the stock was overvalued and that would not
recommend it to his friends or family. I've heard interviews (I dont remember -
either him or authors who did books on him) who confirmed that he was saying
that the stock was not a value at those levels.
He was right (as usual), since it has not done much since 5/96 purchase (up
about 10%).

I dont agree with your comments the need for market makers to succeed in his
style of investing. I'm no Buffet expert, but I can't see how you wouldn't be
successful if you buy great franchises and managements for cheap prices and
hold for a long time (e.g. Coca Cola).

Some companies with those characteristics tend to get taken over - that's what
happened at ABC. Takeovers are one of the major ways that stock value gets
realized. There are more of them then ever, yet you seem to indicate that they
are bad or not present today. I don't follow.

Buffet avoids technology (since he doesn't understand it). IMO I suspect (if he
understood tech) he would have been buying Intel a year ago (in the 50's) or
sooner. My opinion only.

Sure, he's had some problems the last few years, but also successes. The big
one was US Air - where he went outside his area of expertise. I remember a
while ago (5 years maybe) him buying Wells Fargo around 40 or 50. Its now 300+.

There are many ways to make (and lose) money in the market, and I for one would
be interested in looking at any companies that he is buying stocks in.

In all fairness, I have to admit that I sold IOMEGA (recommended by the Value
Talk Investment Service - since closed down) at about $1 (split adjusted) about
5 years ago. Is this the kind of company that you are driving at with the
technical advantage?

Thank you, Jim

You have some very interesting view points, that all people who analyse Buffet
refer to. But you have missed one important fact that you pointed out as an
argument of great stock picking. That is prices of Buffet's stocks always went
way above normal pricing. Eventually not much trading (priced out of reach).
For us MM watchers, it means there is a large cash pool formed. Then it becomes
too lofty in price, the P/E ratio exceeded the expectation. For a lesser MM, it
will be called heading for a blow off. Buffet introduced ABC to Disney for a
merger, when ABC was $750/share (?). I believe US Air was sold to Fidelity at a
loss, even after British Air was called in.

This discussion is in no way, down playing Buffet's team. But MMs call the
shots, and we all have to look at overbought or oversold conditions. Classical
market making at it's best still has to be analysed correctly also.

Some gold producers around the world got gold deep down 450 feet. Costs are
down at $125/oz. On the surface in Neveda, the cost is $285/oz; but gets down
some and the cost goes down to $225/oz. The joke is gold is so heavy that it
sinks in front of our eyes. Near Denver in deep mines, the cost is said to be
$125/oz, you can be paid up to $45,000/yr to work in those mines. However, the
walls in the mine is 125 degrees F. Indonesia produces at $125/oz. Thought you
might be amused by these facts. That's why futures are down on gold; unless
there are price supports. Gold standards can never be; European central banks
all want to sell their hordes, knowing the costs.

just for gold but for gold stocks. The key question is whether at some future

I think people still think of tremendous gold demand; after all the
substitution of gold usage, since it went to $1000/oz in the 70s. Government
currency is neccessaryly more valuable than gold; because of the expansion of
economy, which is wages as well as wage rate related. On the other hand, Gold
cost is always wage related. This lead me some time ago to propose the theory
that currency exchange rate should be wage equivalent. All auto assembly
workers around the world, having the same productivity, has the same wage, just
in different currency.

China for instance, having 105 billion US dollars in their treasury can
exchange people's dollar one to one US dollar. If they accumulate more US
dollars, maybe one to twe US or even 1 to 5 US someday. Taiwan did that in
1987, when their government had reserve to exchange US dollars. They currency
became hard currency; I remember, no one in Taipei wanted dollars from me in
March 1987, because dollar dropped in value each day. That becomes the first
step to eventual wage equivalent currency exchange rates. When the adjusment
comes, a lot of people will be rich; if they own the currency of some countries
which devalued theirs now.

Hi Arthur: I knew the cost of producng it was droping, and I feel that
some cos can do better on that end than others..I didn't know it
was so cheap to get at in Indonesia, I guess thats why Freeport
copper and gold toke a run up. I don't see gold going to it's old
highs, but it does not have to for the mining cos to make money,
right now the demand in asia is strong..gold will always be a hedge
people use were there is a lot of change, or instability, and the
new world order is far from being orderly...so gold will continue
to have demand, it may go down over time, and likly will, the
key is how much cheaper with new equipment, and better discovery
technology can it be produced. And who can best tie up the resorces.
There is money in it, however the rules have changed and will
continue to do so. The stock pile of gold is not so high that if
mining slows down that it won't run up, also more people more
demand, in a nice peacefull world the metel it will just drag along
but let a shakeup come in political cirles, and it will take off
until sability returns. When major changes come they can be good ,
bad or ugly, but always they will produce fear and stimulate demand
for gold..Asia I think is changing for the better , but it's that
fear of change that has the demand for gold up in that part of the
world..Lots of people have put faith
in the American dollar..some are concerned it's too high..let the
dollar start fallng..and watch gold go up, right now the central
banks are in a catch 22 if they sell gold then the dollars they
have will fall and they have more of them and more to lose by
selling than by holding. I do not see them selling their supply.
If the dollar falls, and gold don't in proportion go up,
they will be buyers. Right now gold is cheap mostly due to a
high dollar.

Hi Mike - I went through this whole thing about 6-8 months ago and ran across
Euro-Nevada mining which is traded on the TSE as EN.T Some of the quote servers
carry it as YEN on the NYSE. There is scant info on EN on the web but I've
collected enough elsewhere to build a good case. I discovered it through an
article written by Chuck Allmon who is a rabid value investor.

Euro-Nevada is not a mining company but it is a great gold play. What they do
is secure land rights on "world class" mines only (which is the "official" name
for the highest yielding deposits), map out the deposits and yields, and then
turn the operation over to one of the big mining companies in exchange for a
percentage of bullion and royalties. They have some very big proven sites
coming on-line in the next 6-8 months. The value here is that they will ride
the gold wave with the rest of the mining companies but have little risk
because they are not a capital intensive operation. They have 35 employees, NET
margins over 50% for the past several years, no debt, $160M in cash in and
bullion, current ratio of 35 to 1. Allmon called it "the world's largest gold
royalty company." I've been accumulating and its currently just short of 10% of
my portfolio.

If you might be interested in this, let me know and I will post more info on
it.

Gold demand is up in China, with all those people. But, they are not buying
from Italy either. 1000 people in China dug Gold in their western province.
Recently, some died because of extreme cold. gold futures did not react due to
the problem of production in China.

What is the real truth of Chinese gold fever is the lack of good wages. Bottom
line pay per person per week is $50 chinese dollars. the exchange rate is 8.5
to 1 US dollars. 10 k gold is the most popular and we know how much copper is

still my broker don't like it. But he also tried

I might add I'm getting a big discount on commissions, and can for

one share, if not for that I might avoid CCH as she is a

her trade on the Nasdaq because of the under $1 rule.

She is selling below book value..as was AMD when I bought her at

the quality of management. Frankly, I don't believe it. It's not that the
management of a company can never be a key, or even the key, to the stock's

Hi Folks - Here is my buy report on CEMX which was recently reviewed in
Barrons. As usual, this is strictly my opinion as an individual investor and
should be used at your own risk. Sources for information are documented and
opinions are clearly indicated where appropriate. Also, thanks to Teri Skoerboe
who frequents this thread who also helped with the research.

Regards
Jeff
*********************************************************************
Why I bought CEMX
2/22/97

1.No debt.
2. Depressed price.
3. Good value (reasonable PSR=1.0 and PRR=11.5)
4. Good margins (58% gross, 14% net)
5. They are the world's largest supplier of microwave-based test
equipment.
6. Good ROE (12.4% 1996 with 5-year average of 13.2%)
7. O.K. past sales growth of 10%. Its a nice stable company that
fell on hard times.
8. Conservative management.
9. Stock buy backs totaling 25% since 1992.
10. Stock sells for around $9.50/sh and book value of $6.50/sh
was called "rock solid" in recent Barron's article.
11. Good turnaround play. They have turned the corner.
12. Good international diversification.
13. Boring company that sells boring products.
14. This is a turnaround microcap.

The business: CEMX is the world's largest producer of microwave-based lab
equipment for the food and pharmaceutical industries
and government. They make several general types of devices. One
product line cooks samples sometimes with other reagents in
preparation for analysis. Another product line measures moisture
and solids. Key advantages of CEMX's products are long-term cost
savings, control of the process, ease of use, and speed of
analysis which justify the higher cost of the products relative
to competitors. (10Q, Pg 4) A significant amount of the
company's sales consist of consumable supplies, parts and service
for its instruments. (10K, Pg 2, also Barrons, 2/17/97, Pg. 19)

Size of Industry: No exact data is available here. But if CEMX is
the world's largest producer and generates $30M in revenue, then
the overall market is probably in the $100M-$150M range. The
industry is growing worldwide at a rate of perhaps 10-15% as
evidenced by the expected growth rates of others in the group
(Zacks RM). Also CEMX is developing new products that are
replacing old techniques for preparation and analysis.

Marketing: Products are marketed directly by CEMX and its
subsidiaries in UK, Germany, and Italy. Advertising is done in
trade magazines and trade shows and by direct mail. Products are
demonstrated at potential customer's sites (10K, Pg 3). (This is
the most desirable situation)

Market share and competition: CEMX is the world leader in micro-wave based lab
equipment but no direct breakdown of percentages
were available. A good guess is that CEMX has 20-40% of the
market share. The company lists Bio-Rad Laboratories, Instron
Corp, Isco Inc., Modern Controls, Inc., O.I. Corp, and Pacific
Instrument Co. as competitors. So there are 7 players in the
which is not unreasonable competition for the size of the market.
Data could only be located for Isco and Instron which have Pretax
Margins of 1.8% and 4.4% respectively. Compare with 14% for
CEMX. This is typical for an industry leader (gorilla).
Therefore, CEMX controls the market assuming that the other
companies (probably private) also have lower margins. This is a
fair assumption.

Reason for the earnings glitch: Sales went flat year-over-year
from weakness in German and Japanese economies, technologies
competing with the Company's fat analysis system in the U.S.
process control market, and continued softness in the U.S.
environmental and governmental markets which significantly impact
digestion system sales. Continued softness in U.S. governmental
and environmental markets is expected short term. (10Q, Pg 8,
12/31/96)

Expectations: Zack's ACE growth rate is 15% predicted by 1
broker. (Only two brokers follow the stock)
One broker is regional and the other is national and both
recommend "HOLD" at this time.
Zack's recommends "Moderate Buy" indicating positive earnings
expectations.
S&P ranks the stock as a 2- (1=lowest, 5-highest). Low risk,
Bullish (Pg 3381, 11/6/96)

Management: Michael Collins, Pres and CEO is founder of the
company (54 yrs old). Pd $200K/yr + up to $50K bonuses. VP
Marketing, VP Technology, and CFO are all new within the past 2-3
years and are paid $120K-$130K/yr + bonuses of $15K-$30K/yr, ages
47-55. Bonuses are performance based and NO bonuses were given
during the current year of financial difficulties. (Good!)
There are four directors on the board. This is reasonable
compared with other companies of equal size. Collins owns 14.4%
of the stock (14A, pg 4), board and other officers currently own
3% and have options, four institutions own 32% (14A, pg 4) and
total institutional ownership is 51% (Zacks).

Research and Development: Fisher suggests a reasonable PRR
(Price/Research) range between 5 and 15 for "Super Companies".
The current PRR is 11.5 which is good. Average PRRs for the past
3 years based upon average prices were 17.5, 17.9, and 15.6 for
1994, 1995, and 1996 respectively. Management has spent 8-10% of
sales on R&D in the past and expects to do so in the foreseeable
future. (10Q, Pg 3)

Valuation: Results using NAIC Stock Selection Guide (SSG)
software for Windows and S&P data (Pg 3381, 11/6/96). Sales
increased steadily since 1987 at a 13.3% rate while earnings grew
at 10.0 %. The earnings glitch in 1992 was considered to be an
aberration for the purposes of this analysis. 5-year projections
are 15% earnings growth. (Zacks). Since there is only one
analyst reporting, the historical value of 10% was used. From a
price of $9.50 the total projected long-term return is 20.4%.
Current P/E is 17.9, 5-year historical high P/E=19.1 and low P/E=
13.4. So the PE is slightly above average and there is some room
to expand although the current PE reflects the low earnings. PSR
is a better measure of value here.

Current PSR (Price/Sales) = 1.0 based upon prior 4-quarter sales
or 0.91 based upon current quarterly sales x 4. Historic PSRs
range from 1.17 to 3+. PSR is currently above that recommended
by Fisher for a "Super Company" but is not an unreasonably high
value. Current PSR indicates a good value play for this company
since it is at an historic low.

Industry Comparison: Compared with its two peers listed in proxy
statement:

Measure CEM Isco Instron

PSR 1.0 1.23 0.53
Sales 31M 40M 151M
Pretax Margin 11.9 1.8 4.4
D/E 7.1 0 20.0
ROE 8.6 4.5 9.8
P/E 15.6 23.6 14.5
LT Growth 15.0 N/A 17.0
% abv 52 wk low 10 12 42
Inst ownership 51 18 36
Inside ownership 17 61 10

1. PSR is in a reasonable range compared with its peers.
2. CEM has the best market advantage because of much higher
margins. They can control their own destiny.
3. Long-term growth rates are similar.
4. Other companies in the group are probably suffering from the
downturn as indicated by the current stock prices. Note Instron
has other product lines so its earnings probably didn't suffer as
much as its peers as demonstrated by the price (% abv 52 wk low).
So the low earnings is probably due less to competition and more from
a general industry downturn.
5. Management of CEM looks good as does Instron compared with
Isco by observing ROE.

Miscellaneous issues and opinions:
1. This is a good turnaround play only. Sell when the price has
recovered to historic levels AND a suitable substitute can be
found.
2. Price could reach $15 in 6-9 months. Price could double in
12-18 months or less.
3. Its not a good long-term holding because the growth is below
20% goal.
4. No current insider trading data was found.
5. Management appears to be doing a lot of things to enhance
shareholder value. Stock buy backs should continue as there is
still $2.5M authorized and management has extended the buy back
program in the past.

Kaneb Services (NYSE:KAB) gave us a big "earnings surprise" at the end
of last week, and the stock is beginning to move up strongly.

KAB reported earnings 0f $.06 per share for the fourth quarter of 1996.
The three analysts who are following the Company were each expecting
only $.04 per share.

Zacks Investment Service reports that KAB is the top ranked stock in the
Oil Production/Pipeline Segment out of 33 stocks followed in that
segment. The three securities analysts who follow the Company all give it
a "Strong Buy" rating, and they are projecting 1997 earnings per share to
reach $.30, a 58% increase over 1996.

For 1996, net income grew 86% to reach $6.5 million, after adjusting for
non-recurring items in the prior year. Revenues reached $229 million, a
8% increase. Cash flows for the year were equally strong, allowing the
Company to retire a substantial amount of debt and implement a stock
buy-back program.

Kaneb Services provides specialized industrial services to a wide range of
industries, including petroleum refineries, chemical plants, offshore
energy production platforms, steel mills, power generation and other
process industries in more than 20 countries, and also manages and
operates a network of petroleum pipelines and terminals, making it the
third largest independent liquids terminaling operation in the
United States.

Hi Paul - Who's right? Lou or Ken? If you recall in "Super Stocks", Fisher
states that this kind of "jawboning" occurs after a glitch because analysts
don't want to lose face because of their poor judgment on earnings predictions
or a failure to realize that "even great companies have glitches". They can't
blame themselves so they blame management. Or is this Lou's biting sarchasm?

Bob,

Do you have any insight into why Kaneb's earnings have been so
erratic over the last 5 years or so? Lack of earnings stability and
hence predictability may be a reason for the PE, which even so seems
high. Current ratio of 1.3, d/a of .473, trading at greater than
2x book. What is your figure for net margins? Mine's in the low
single digits. Cash flow sure is impressive, but how steady has
that been over the years? Up >25% in the last week with about three
years of 4.5-6.0 overhead supply coming in view.

Bema looks awfully speculative to me. It's another rollercoaster

80% of that gain over the next 3 mos. It is up over 25% in the
last two weeks on "nothing special" volume. Also, the company
has never made money and continues to have negative cash flow. Its balance
sheet looks ok, but it is still at 4X book. I just wonder if this is an

I am pretty comfortable with YEN. The investor's kit directly from the company
helped raise my comfort level. Its include either single sheets or full reports
from the following brokers: Richardson Greenshields, First Marathon, Nesbitt
Burns Red Book, Midland Walwyn, "Donaldson,Lufkin&Jenrette", and Gordon
Capital. There are also newspaper articles from Barrons (3/18/96), The Northern
Miner (6/3/96), and Financial Times (5/24/96). Also, Allmon's endorsement in
the NAIC Better Investing Mag is also a plus. NAIC is a pretty conservative and
common sense organization and they wouldn't publish something that was shakey.
The BI article was in the Sep 96 issue. Also, don't confuse Euro-Nevada mining
with Franco-Nevada mining which is a sister company. Also the 10K you get from
the company does a very good job of describing what they have done in the past,
where they are now, and where they are going.

They developed the Meikle Mine in Nevada for Barrick. Other mining companies
they work with are Goldfield, Aurora Gold, Homestake, Newmont, and Placer Dome.
So they aren't playing with small fry. Also they are worldwide with operations
in Tasmania, Indonesia, and Australia as well as all over the Western US and
Canada.

if it can be covered with cash which is the case here. According to S&P, LT
debt is $1.4M and ST debt is $3.8M. So $1.4M debt on revenues of $30M is
negligible IMO.

To Jeff: re Management. I don't know who is right. Fisher and analysts
presumably do interview managements to get a take on their competence. And
Fisher, in his book, says how hard it was just to get in to see some of these
people. A bunch of analysts covered Mercury Finance - they must have missed
something there. I see in Forbes mag. that Fisher sometimes recommends sales of
stocks because they have gone up or down. Maybe he bought because of
management, but it doesn't appear to enter into the sell decision.
Maybe more to the point is how do we guys who have no access to management (or
maybe we really do and don't know it) assess management? And do this for all
the companies we are interested in. Possibly, each of us has to develop our own
way here. (I like reading annual reports, following history of communication
w/stockholders, and of course the sine qua non: ROE ) Paul

This is a critical point. If the company is big enough, there is usually enough
written not only in the main stream press but in technical and trade journals.
Sometimes I can get my hands on brokerage reports which are also nice. I also
use the 10K and 14A to evaluate management. The 14A (proxy statement) tells a
lot about management. I look hard at compensation packages, stock ownership,
bonuses, and how much top management gets paid in a downturn. Its been my own
experience that good managements 1) own a good bit of stock, 2) don't take
bonuses in a downturn, and 3) have bonuses tied to performance in a
well-defined way. Of course there are other obvious things like management
turnover, background of the top dogs (engineers? marketers? visionaries?) which
Fisher and Lynch enumerate in their various books. This is one reason why I
tend to stay away from micro-caps is that there is not a lot written on these
companies. Also, I use historical ROE and margins relative to the industry and
competitors to evaluate management.

But unfortunately nobody has perfect data. Evaluating management is more
probabilistic rather than an exact science which is why some managements fail
in light of very good evaluations and interviews by various analysts. Go CTN!

Now that the subject has been broached, how does one figure an
exit point? Say you've got this great company with value characteristics, but
you're up 40-50% in a few months? Does
rate of rise of stock price figure into it? Are there value
parameters you can watch for a sell signal? Do you only allow
a certain amount of retracement off a profit floor (e.g. I'll
only lose 10% of a 50% profit)?

position). IMO, how much/fast it has gone up, stop points, etc more applicable
to growth (usually more volitile) stocks. Sort of like 'sell when you would no
longer buy it'.

BTW: IMO taxes and commissions are secondary. Many a $ has been lost holding on
for the capital gains long term tax rate.

There are tools you can use. I use the NAIC Stock Selection Guide that gives

Would you also consider it important to investigate management's willingness
continuously strive to lower expenses? And if so, how does this show up in "the
numbers," since we do not have direct access to management? Also, it might be
telling to utilize Buffet's criteria of requiring $1 of increased market value
for each $1 of retained earnings. Also, investigating the candor of management
in the past.

A couple of quotes from Hagstrom's book:
"Like Philip Fisher, Buffet is aware that great businesses make lousy
investments if management cannot convert sales into profits. In his experience,
managers of high-cost operations tend to find ways to continually add to
overhead, whereas managers of low-cost operations are always finding ways to
cut expenses."

"A company that provides average or below-average investment returns but
generates cash in excess of of its needs has three options: (1) It can ignore
the problem and continue to reinvest at below average rates, (2) it can buy
growth, or (3) it can return the money to shareholders. It is at this crossroad
that Buffet keenly focuses on management's behavior. It is here that management
will behave RATIONALLY or IRRATIONALLY."

I will include one more quote that deliniates Buffet's concerns about "the
institutional imperative."
"According to Buffet, the institutional imperative exists when '(1) an
institution resists any change in its current direction; (2) just as work
expands to fill available time, corporate projects or acquisitions will
materialize to soak up available funds; (3) any business craving of the leader,
however foolish, will quickly be supported by detailed rate-of-return and
strategic studies prepared by his troops; and (4) the behavior of peer
companies, whether they are expanding, acquiring, setting executive
compensation or whatever, will be mindlessly imitated."

Just some thoughts.

Mike - I'm not sure if you are talking about exit points for value stocks in
general or for Euro-Nevada. For Euro-Nevada, I will hold the company until
fundamentals deterioriate which might not ever happen.

For the PSR plays, I set an exit PSR range based upon company size. For very
large companies that are growing fast (ie. AMAT), my exit range is 3-4. If the
stock is rather volitile, I will exit on the low side. If the stock has a very
steady rise due to 1) rapidly rising earnings, and/or 2) regaining of "Wall
Street Darling" status I will hold on until the PSR reaches the higher side.
For smaller companies, the range is 3-6 depending upon what I'm dealing with.
These ranges have worked well for me in this market and they conform pretty
closely to Fisher's approach. I also like to give some consideration to the
PSRs of the company's peers for choosing the exit since PSRs for companies of
similar size in a given industry will have similar long-term PSR histories.
These data are a bit more complex to intrepret since PSRs tend to shrink as the
company grows larger and it goes through various earnings growth and
contraction cycles.

method expoused by Ian Woodward which simply determines the % above a stock's

you better have a strong over all market, and at 150%+, well. . .

"corporate anorexia"?

If a company's expenses are out of line, it is likely that it is going to show
up in the lower profits relative to its peers. This is one of the criteria I
use to judge reasonableness of expenses. Another that I picked up from Peter
Lynch is to look at the real annual report. Is it the real flashy $15/copy type
or printed on cheap paper with few or no pictures? TXI and RGC which have been
good investments for me over the past few years printed on cheap paper. TXI
switched to a glossy buy equally unimpressive format last year.

Investigating the candor of management in the past is also something I like to
study. Are they really forthcoming when problems arise or do you find out with
an untimely preannouncement or a bad earnings report?

dr. z - SSG is a method of evaluating growth stocks based upon fundamentals.
You get paper versions when you join NAIC (National Assoc. of Investor's Corp.)
It costs about $40 the first year and about $25 thereafter. The first year you
get a nice Investor's manual that explains a lot about fundamental investing
and how to work an SSG. The Windows software (which I use and recommend) costs
about $130 and it takes about 15 minutes to do an SSG if you have a paper
version of a Value Line. It prints out nice graphs and charts of the data.

NAIC is one of the oldest organizations for educating investors. They've been

NAIC stands for the National Association of Investment Clubs. It is an
organization that provides investment education, mainly but not only directed
to investment clubs. You can join as an individual or as a club or just buy
educational materials from them.

The stock selection guide is a form that it recommends be used to evaluate a
stock for investing. The basic idea is to gather and structure up to 10 years
worth of key information like prices, earnings, dividends, etc. Then you supply
estimates of earnings, sales growth; average p/e's, eps and lowest price. It
cranks out price ranges, expected return, upside/downside ratio's, etc.

The stock selection guide is not on-line, but NAIC sells software and a
quarterly data service that implements most of the data gathering and has
analysts estimates for relatively modest costs.

For info see the NAIC home page at:
http://www.better-investing.org/member/member.html

Check NAIC out for its other services - membership doesn't cost much and they
have a very good magazine (Better Investing) and low cost investment (entry to
drip) plan, etc. Peter Lynch and the Beardstone Ladies are just two of the
references I know of that highly recommend use of NAIC principles.

Re Kaneb Service (NYSE:KAB)

To give a general answer to this question, there are a series of non-recurring
items in the last several years which cause this to happen. When you purge them
out, then earnings growth becomes more logical.

If you e-mail me your e-mail address, I will add you onto the subscription list

Can anyone tell me what to make of this:

Harbourton Financial Services L.P.
recent share price $1.00
p/e 6.25
book value 8.98

The company deals loans and has a really high short term debt of
$232 million, but I still can't determine why it is priced so low. I read one
article that sounded like they were going to sell off everything because of new
tax laws. If they were to liquidate, what would that mean for the shareholders?
here is the news article where they discuss liquidation:

On a quick look HBT looks terrible to me

If they become a taxed corp. the PE jumps to around 9, earnings are falling,
and the book value is more like $1.25, Costs related to liquidation would
probably eat up the at least 20% of book giving you the current price of $1.00

Aaron's question brings up a good point. Can anyone comment on how
to value the following:

Banks
Brokerages
Other Financial Services firms

I understand that book, PSR, PE, net profti margin, etc. are often
not useful. What can one do? I recently bought into REF as
an asset play then quickly got out when my fear
of not understanding how to value it finally overcame me.

Any comments appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Chris: Banks? Well yes, many people have an "interest" in them - but not on SI,
IMHO.
I say it's been very very difficult to lose money investing in these stocks
over the past 2 years. Perhaps now that the subject is coming up at this time,
it may be an indicator that the party is coming to an end. Anyway . . .
Here are the top 3 standard measures for evaluating bank company stocks: (And
if you are serious about "banks" -- you must actually delve into subcategories
such as - S&L, Bank, Bank Holding, Diversified, Money Center, Regional, etc.):

Return on Total Average Assets: (the Numero Uno ratio for judging)
ROE
Equity as a percent of Total Assets

And of course the standard stuff like earnings growth. Although I personally am
looking at relative dividend yield.

Some ideas for you all look into (NOT recommendations!!): Ponce Bank mentioned
in post before mine may be okay. I've seen it being recommended by professional
value investors. We might check into JPM (Morgan - premier international bank -
earnings subject to trading gains/losses) ONE (Banc One - a regional
powerhouse), NB (NationsBank - very aggressive acquirer) MEL (owns financial
services -Dreyfus) Citicorp (Geez, where was I sleeping for so many years when
it was 15, 25, 35, 45, 65, 75, 95, 105, 115, etc.?) Prices of them all seem so
high now. But if the banks don't screw up like have in the past, maybe they'll
get a market multiple (the price will go up - assuming the market won't crash)

Navistar: long-term appreciation likely?
This maker of trucks was recently featured in the WSJ's Shareholder supplement
as being the worst 10-year stock (1 dollar purchase of the company is now worth
.19). It may finally be the right time to buy, however. The company is working
on diversifying/enhancing its product-line, has simplified manufacturing to
lower costs, has increased its market share to ~37% from ~27% in 1991, and has
linked more than 400 top managers pay to the company performance. Although the
demand for heavy-duty trucks is not booming, I feel that they may be able to
boost earnings significantly over the next two years.

Here is a look at some of their key data:
http://www.dbc.com/cgi-bin/htx.exe/core/dbc/squote.htx?SOURCE=core%2Fdbc&TICKER
NAV&tables=market&format=fractions
interesting to me is:
1. book value 13.60 (trading <10)
2. 9.86 cash/share
*the P/E, HOWEVER, is rather high at 25.

Does anyone have any comments on the future of this stock?

Thanks,

Aaron: Navistar has been popping up on some of my stock screens, so I did some
investigation. What I found:

1) Value Line is also positive on the possible long term gains. It's summary
indicates in part "These risky shares have sizable long-term capital
appreciation prospects". But their rating on is neutral on the short term
prospects based on momentum and price and worst on safety (they rate it a 35
which is short term (year ahead) market performer and very riskly). They note
that NAV businesses are inherently cyclical. Value Line estimates that NAV
could make 1.70 per share in next 5 years.
Cancelling their next-generation truck program due to union trouble's last year
was not a plus - big dent in new product development. I seem to remember that
NAV has a history of union problems - IMO: definitely a minus.

2) I've read that the rational for valuation of P/E's for cyclical stocks is
reversed: ie buy high and sell low. Buy in recession when earnings are terrible
and sell when all is rosy and they can't produce enough product and company is
earnings piles of money. Peter Lynch, in 'One Up on Wall St' (i just got the
tapes) recommends buying cyclicals when you perceive that demand is picking up
for the product. In the last 10-q NAV predict 13% less demand in industry this
year for trucks. Not a plus.
Also, earnings are what you make of them. Value Line doesn't include the
write-off of the terminated program (one time) in its earnings and computes a
p/e of around 12-13.

3) I follow the three major advisory newsletter services and summary of their
recommendations on NAV are:
value line 3,5 (timeliness, safety - scales 1-5 1 best)
zacks 4- (mild sell and decreasing - scale 1-5 1 best)
zweig 6+ (mild sell but getting better - scale 1-9 1 best)

The S&P Stock Guide that I just got rates NAV a B- (scale A+(top) to D) B- is
the 3rd from worst with D being in reorganization.

4) I did a NAIC Stock Selection Guide on NAV and was suprised to see it was
profitable the last 4 years (i remember playing it with options a while ago and
getting killed when they didn't come close to an earnings estimate). Using
value line (operating) numbers, I got an upside/downside ratio of 5.0 (buy),
total return estimate of about 17% (compounded over next 5 years) and buy range
of 7-11.2, estimated price range (next 5 years) of about 20 high , 7 low.
Average pe (last 3 years) 13.7 current pe 12.7. This rates a buy recommendation
based on the numbers, but % profit on sales and invested capital are both
decreasing (not good).

--------------

I hope this helps in your evaluation.

My evaluation: it has good possibilities if you are very patient - it's
probably too soon to buy. Based on everything, I do not like the company and I
will not buy it. IMHO, if you want to pursue it, I'd recommend you read the
value line full review (some libraries have it), and don't buy unless you're
willing to hold on for a while (IMHO 4-5 years).

My opinion only.

Thanks for your opinions, Jim. I am a long, long term investor who isn't afraid
to wait 5 years for a good thing. If a stock I buy doubles in five years, I am
very happy. I will just put a bid out there (somewhere ~8 for Navistar) and
wait for it to go through. I think that there are many people interested in
raising Navistar's share price, and I believe it will be done given a few
years. For me, the trick is just buying as close to the bottom as possible,
then being very patient.

Paul,

Would you say that it has been nearly impossible to lose money
in banking and financial stocks because a) interest rates have
been low and falling and b) the stock market has been on a record
tear?

I wonder if with banking stocks, their businesses are so wide
open for everyone to see (everyone knows current interest rates,
what the bank pays and what the bank earns) that investor emotion
doesn't matter as much as the bottom line -- what are interest
rates doing?

Same thing with brokerages, though there is more variation here,
no?

Hi Mike,

You said: >> ...Can anyone comment on how to value .......

In my files I found the following excerpts about valuing banks:

Bank Run -- Investors stampeded out of bank stocks last week; should they be
headed the other way? - Michael Mayo, banking analyst at Lehman Brothers,
maintains that banks are in their best shape in three decades. A key measure of
banks' cost control efforts, the so-called efficiency ratio, which measures
non-interest costs as a percentage of revenues. Mayo says that banks
increasingly rely on lines of business whose true value isn't captured on their
balance sheets. This belief underpins his effort to arrive at what he calls
banks' "hidden book value", which he adds to book value in order to come up
with what he calls "franchise value". Hidden book value puts a price on a
bank's consumer deposits and mortgage servicing, as well as money-management,
credit-card and processing businesses. These may not be apparent on balance
sheets, but they can be quite valuable.
Barron's 4/15/96 Pg. 16

Merchants New York -- Bank-Vault Solid -- ...Merchants New York has one of the
strongest balance sheets in the U.S.. Its ratio of risk-based capital to assets
typically exceeds 20%, more than 2&#171; times regulatory requirements and far
above that of most banks. (Generally, the higher the figure, the stronger the
bank.)... ...To buttress itself against unexpected disaster, the bank sets
aside hefty loan-loss reserves. These equaled 2.3% of average loans last year,
compared with 0.5% at most banks... Barron's 10/30/95 Pg. 26

Don't Bank On It -- Amid the Merger mania, an Analyst Sees Earnings,
Credit-Quality Woes -- An Interview with Frank R. DeSantis Jr. - Some of the
things that could be used to indicate a market (Banks) top: 1) Margins: Bank
net-interest margins peaked in mid-1993 and they have been heading down; 2)
Asset Quality: Credit quality is starting to deteriorate; 3) Valuation:
Price-to-book value, price-to-assets have rarely been this high. Price-to-book
is running just over 180%. While it's a less useful indicator today than it has
been in the past, it's still a reasonable one. "..And generally, when the group
gets over 175% of book, I start to wonder about its performance."
Barron's 9/18/95 Pg. 20

Citicorp has exceeded their 8% tier-one capital ratio goal. The tier-one ratio
is a key measure of a bank's capital relative to the riskiness of its assets.
Federal regulators don't consider a bank well capitalized until it can maintain
at least a 6% ratio.
Barron's 6/26/95 Pg. 43

SUNTRUST BANKS - Cloudy Skies Ahead? In 1994 SunTrust had a P/E ratio of 12
while most regional banks traded at P/E's closer to 8. SunTrust's current share
price equals 183% of its book value; peers trade at 150% of book. Although
SunTrust's cost base has long ranked among the lowest in the industry -- it's
efficiency ratio, a measure of the amount of expenses for every dollar in
revenue, is about 59%, compared with 63% for the average regional. Barron's
2/13/95 Pg. 17

I have been researching Mesa Airlines as a value play. They are the largest
commuter airline in the world ( USAir Express, America West Express, Skyway).
Althouth they have had some problems in the last year it seems from my research
that a turn-around is in hand. I am still in the learning curve of value
investing so any input into my analysis is appreciated. From what I have
researched this stock has been depressed due to lowered earning estimates due
to charges from making changes mandated by the FAA, and the aforementioned
problems. They are currently covered by 8 firms (PaineWebber, Smith Barney,
Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and others). But in the long run it looks like
it very well could return to previous earnings. Let me know what you think.

As of 2/21/97

52 wk high: 13.88

I highlighted the path and while holding down the control key; I
pressed the "c" key. ("C" for copy) -- I used my mouse to
highlight the path, or contents of the location field.
Then when I typed the message to you, I held down the control key
and pressed the "v" key. ("V" for that's the way Bill Gates wanted

TRANSNET CORPORATION (NASDAQ:TRNT)
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS SUMMARY

TransNet Corporation, which The Napeague Letter has followed for almost a
year, recently announced extremely strong results for the second quarter
of fiscal 1997. This continued its long-term growth trend as you can see
from the following chart:

2nd Quarter 1st Quarter ------- Fiscal Year ------
1997 1996 1997 1996 1996 1995 1994 1993
------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
Revenues 19,232 17,454 16,539 15,730 64,201 56,217 40,342 28,903
Gross Profit 2,014 1,872 1,842 1,717 7,226 6,454 5,396 4,676
Pre-Tax Income 316 290 297 236 966 692 394 263
Net Income 316 290 297 236 1,003 882 394 263
Net Income/Sh 0.07 0.06 0.06 0.05 0.19 0.17 0.08 0.05

- The Company's high-margin Service & Support business led this
expansion with 40% growth versus prior year, thus demonstrating
that TransNet's key growth strategy is working successfully.

- These results give TRNT trailing 12 month earnings per share of
$.22. At a market price of $2.25, the Company trades at a PE
multiple of only 10.2, and at $3.00 it trades at a multiple of
13.6, substantially below that of its industry segment or the
market in total.

- The results for the quarter exceeded my expectations. On January
10th I projected revenues of $19,232,000, net income of $316,000,
and earnings per share of $.06 - all of which were exceeded.

- I am currently projecting a 42% increase in earnings per share for
fiscal 1997, on a 22% increase in revenue.

TransNet Corporation (NASDAQ:TRNT) provides its corporate clients in the
Northeast, with a variety of Systems Outsourcing services under extended
contracts, and hardware and software at preferential pricing. As a result,
the Company has a strong following of loyal clients, a reputation for
innovation and quality as a value-added microcomputer reseller, and
a history of increasing profitability.

- Several different industry studies confirm that demand for Systems
Outsourcing , which has been strong for several years, will grow
even more rapidly in the future.

TransNet has announced that it will implement "alternative cost-effective
methods of distributing personal computers and printers to our clients."
I estimate that such a program might generate an additional $.07 per
share.

TransNet is a potential acquisition candidate in a market segment which
is rapidly consolidating through acquisition, and there are some
indications that the Company may be taking steps to prepare itself to be
acquired.

At its closing price of $2.38 on Friday, January 31st, the Company is
substantially undervalued, and can justify a market price in excess of
$6.00 per share.

Paul Harris Stores Inc: PAUH

Another "gift horse" value buying opportunity has presented itself.
Paul Harris (PAUH) has gone from $2/share to a 52-week high of $23.
Since October, it has "corrected" several times to the $14-$16 range,
only to rebound predictably to the $22 range.

The stock closed down today $1.25, to $15.75, WHILE THE STRONG
FUNDAMENTALS REMAIN INTACT!!!!!!!!!!!!

It looks like the stock is assuming a trading range between a $15
support floor and a $22 cieling, and is ready to begin its ascent to the
$22 range again, IMHO. This would represent a 40% gain.

This same 40% retracement/ascent occured during the MONTH OF JANUARY,
since correcting back to the current price.

Here is the charting service.....check out the chart...

Bob,

An interesting company. One thing I noticed in the 1996 10-K, however, is
disturbing:
->One customer accounted for %50 of '96 revenues and an affiliate of
of this company for %19. Furthermore, the revenues from this customer are up
from %34 and %17 in '95 and '94, respectively. The Company, itself states that
any decrease from this customer would adversely affect revenues.

Otherwise, it appears to be a strong company, which responded well to the
continual decline in computer hardware prices by seeking and finding a new
distributor that could get the company a discount comparable to the larger
stores. A definite potential growth story.

Impressive earnings and sales gains and estimated 30% 5 year growth.
Trememdous price volatility from 1 to 23 last year!
Was this a motley fool discovery?

Big question: Is their product a fad? What is chance their style
will have staying power to support more such big increases
in sales/earnings?
From news release:
<Paul Harris Stores, Inc. sells the Paul Harris Design private label
brand through 224 locations. Paul Harris offers a unique

Technically, I agree with others,
IMO support has to be tested around 15-16 before buy.

year. Is it a hold or sell ? AFAIK, the stock is followed by only two analysts
and they both consider it a buy, so I'm in a quandary whether to take a nice
gain or hold. tia, wayne

Wayne: I can't do a full analysis since RCMT not on my NAIC S&P data but some
comments:

1) Zack's rank has it at 3. I usually sell trading stocks when a stock drops to
a 3. Only one analyst projects the 40% 5 year growth rate. I've had no luck
using Zack's estimates with only 2 analysts.

2) It sure has good psr of .7 vs 1.2 for business services sector. Except it's
psr was .6 last year and .7 over 5 year avg.

3) The earnings growth is great but revenue flat. With the mergers it is real
difficult to analyze. Appears earnings are up on cutting expenses - there is a
limit to that without top line growth.

4) I compute an average pe over last 4 years of about 13 * estimated eps of .58
= 7.54. PE varies all over the lot with average of high's,low's of 19.6-6.3.
Estimated low price of 6.3 * .58 =~ 3.5.
Avg hi pe * est eps 97 = 19.6 * .58 = 11 3/8.

5) How about selling enuf so you have zero cost? If it were me I might sell 1/3
and let rest ride with a real tight trailing stop (like maybe sell if it falls
more than 15% from recent high).

Hope this helps.

What does AFAIK stand for?

Good trading.

Jim,

Appreciate treader's consideration of Hallwood Energy Partners. Announced
earnings up to 0.37 from - 0.02 a year ago. Symbol is HEP. The 96' yrs earnings
at 1.34 vs -1.07 the year before. Shares closed at 9. Yield is 5.8% (dividends
paid since 1985) were 13 cents each of last four quarters. Oil prices may
stabilize and move up above $ 21 dollars. Loss due to failed venture in
Indonesia which they have written off. They returned to profitability in the
first 9 months of 96.

Primarily they engaged in production of oil and gas and in acquistion,
exploration, development and operation of oil and gas properties. They are
under followed, IHO. Only 10.8 shr outstanding. average dal volume 16,000.
Tang. Bk value = $ 5.61/sh. Mkt value 97.2 MM.

Appreciate all threader's thoughts. Much of this taken from Standard and Poors
sheet. Also featured in back pages of Forbes about a month ago with touted
appreciation potential of 60% in share price.

Happy investing,

Jarrett

Jim...Thanks for taking the time to give me the benefit of your analysis of
RCMT and ideas for when/how much to sell. First Call rates this a 1 based on 2
brokers, with projected earnings of .64 for 97 (implied PE--15.3) and .80 for
98 (implied PE--12.0) The proxy report shows the Directors and Officers (8)
have 40.7% of the stock. Do you consider that a plus? Thanks again, wayne

AFAIK is "as far as I know." :) As you might guess, there is a Net Acronym
search engine with about 6000 entries. (AFAIK wasn't there, but it is still a
nice resource. :) http://rimula.hkr.se/services/acronym.html
