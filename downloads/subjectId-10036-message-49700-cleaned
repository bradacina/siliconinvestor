I don't see the promise with CLC. It does seem that you have trouble to explain
your purchase in this stock. Which brings up a question that I wanted to ask
before: why do you buy stocks that you don't consider a value at the time of
purchase? Examples are CLC, EXPD and CFR that I remember recently. These stocks
were not a value by your own admission, when you purchased them, but apparently
you liked the companies and purchased a small position. Subsequently you sold
the stock (which failed to go up) and the reason is not quite clear either. Was
it that you researched the business, and decided to buy some stock, just to
justify the time you spent on them? This sometimes happens to me, that the
longer I look into a particular sector, the more value stocks I find, mostly
with not that great results. It's like itching to play in a poker game, even if
you know that your cards aren't good, just because you feel like you need some
action.

I often find sectors or business that i like, but if I don't find the companies
to be a value, I don't buy, or search a bit more to find foreign companies in
the same business, or I find similar business.

For filters, I'd look at MMM, for example. While the majority of their business
is not in filters, they do have a business there and many other lines, that
look just as well in terms of profits and potential. Or maybe catch the water
angle with XYL or something exotic like Kurita (7370.T). I think the filter
business is quite nice, with a consumables angle, maintenance contracts, and a
high risk, if there is a failure, which makes the switching cost quite high.
But paying 20x earnings for a mediocre looking company like CLC does not make
sense to me.

Some stocks that I buy I consider relative values. Which as discussed here many
times, is a very very dangerous way to invest (imo). I bought EXPD because I
felt it had a very good history, a superb ceo, a good balance sheet, and its
stock price was temporarily down because of a slowdown in Chinese growth and
trade. At some point, I came to believe I was going to have to hold the stock
longer than I expected I might, because the shipping/expediting business seemed
like it would continue poorly for a long time, and the stock still did not seem
like it was washed out (still sported a too-high p/e), so it could and might
fall further. So I sold, for a loss.

As I said about Cullen Frost, "...for the Eagle Ford shale and infrastructure,
I recently did step up to buy a few shares of Cullen-Frost for a tracking
position...I'm interested in buying stocks of local banks involved in shale
plays". I also mentioned WFC. About both stocks I said, "I don't claim either
of these stocks is a value at their current prices and metrics".

When it was pointed out to me WFC was a big bank presence in North Dakota, I
decided I could get the bank/shale exposure I wanted in ND, OK, and TX with
WFC. Somewhat muted effect from shale though because WFC is so big and diverse,
Otoh, maybe a safer bet. So as I said, I swapped Cullen for more WFC.

CLC is mediocre only on some metrics, imo. It's very expensive when I look at
its historical roe. That metric is a key one for me though. CLC seems to be
doing everything that a good company might do (that a good roe company with a
good business franchise might do): Keep debt very low, buy back stock, increase
dividends (The low yield though I don't like), have rising stated bv, expand
business into new areas - geographically and in complementary businesses.
Company had one eps down year (was profitable though) in past ten.

I looked roughly at the stock chart of CLC:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=CLC+Basic+Chart&t=my
What would you say... maybe a double in the stock every 8 to 10 years? Coupled
with a 1% growing-slow dividend, that equals maybe 8% or 10% annual return.
That is mediocre. I find that if the stock were bought ten years ago, then
today, with dividends reinvested, the annual return's been a bit over 12%.
Still not great. However for me -- if the company can just keep doing what it
does and get its share of the filter business, and if I could buy the stock and
hold on to it for ten years, I'll take it for 8% or maybe 12% -- with a shot
for maybe better if the company comes through with some product breakthroughs
or rides the inflationary times we may enter. For others who evaluate the
possibility or probability differently or for whom 8% (12%) is too low, or too
low for the risk they see, okay, the stock's a pass for them.

===
MMM vs CLC: Over the long term, CLC has been a better performer than MMM (which
is a surprise to me)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=my&s=CLC&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=mmm+&ql=1&c= ^GSPC

I hadn't considered MMM. Last time I looked I found it too expensive.

=========
I'm generally not subject to buying a stock because I spent so much time
researching it. More likely, my situation might be I'll quickly see that a
stock falls into a style box that I'm interested in
(yield/gaarp/growth/thesis/value) and I'll rather impulsively begin buying a
few shares.

I'm surprised how people think that INTC, DELL, HPQ will die because nobody
will buy PCs anymore, but then WDC and STX will somehow survive. :)

WDC and STX face the same amount of risk as INTC, probably more. Mobile devices
do not have HDDs at all, while they still have CPUs. And if we talk about HDDs
being needed for cloud storage, so are INTC CPUs. :)

WDC and STX are quite cheap. But don't fool yourself that there is no risk. The
HDD price wars are a bit less intense than years ago, but the prices are still
crashing and solid state will keep the pressure on margins. Solid state is
close to the magic price/Gb level when people will start putting it as full
replacement primary drive into laptops. ~200Gb solid states are becoming cheap
enough to have a primary SSD that will hold OS, apps, games, music, videos with
some planning. Yes, you can still get 1-2Tb HDD for the same price, but now SSD
is viable as primary main drive. If HDD loses a significant segment of laptop
market, look out.

Price wise, yes, WDC & STX are as cheap as DELL and much cheaper than INTC. I
should probably buy a small position. I'm just not sure it's a great place to
be.

If you're looking at continued low p/e and saying therefore it's a value trap
--- that's not quite correct, imo. If something has a low p/e year after year,
that doesn't necessarily mean it's a value trap. For me, I search out such
companies. I'm interested as long as the earnings don't seem like they will
drop in those future years. Because in those future years, if the earnings do
fall, the price (p) will drop (hurting me), and yet the p/e <u>might</u> still
stay low. (When I've seen huge drops in earnings though, the p/e has often
risen actually. Denominator "e" becomes so much smaller it pushes up the ratio.
Even though "p" falls too.)

That seems to be the point with WDC, others. There may be a sea change with
their businesses, and so people believe earnings will indeed fall -- maybe
jeopardizing the company's business or existence. If anywhere near true, the
stock(s) could be value trap(s) if bought only on today's low p/e.

If you think WDC is a value trap go through the CF/BS statement line by line
and see if they are inflating earnings by under spending in one category and
over spending in another. So far I can't see any. They appear to be depressed
because of perception of death of p/c, thai floods etc.

Overall, WDC's financials do look good, but there's some questions. I do not
think it is a value trap either.

On the financial statement, there's a large increase in R & D spending as well
as an increase in selling and administrative costs. WDC is looking into
expanding its products to compete better?

On the balance sheet you'll find large increases in goodwill and intangibles
along with a large increase in long term debt. I didn't look into what this is
about. Maybe acquisitions?

On the plus side is growth in retained earnings and treasury stock, and the co.
is solid on free cash.

I would be interested in buying WDC but that huge gap in the chart is

performance going forward, but very good roe to p/e now (ala Greenblatt) and

Cummins in Barron's today:

http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111903463204578048523672674046.h
ml?mod=BOL_hps_dc

<blockquote>Cummins is sensitive to economic swings. In 2009, amid a global
financial crisis, revenue plunged to $10.8 billion from $14.4 billion and
earnings collapsed to $2.49 a share from $4.08. They've recovered, and then
some. Last year, revenue topped $18 billion and earnings per share totaled
$9.07. Another slowdown is afoot, however. Cummins says it expects revenue of
$17 billion this year and earnings before interest and taxes, or Ebit, to come
in at 13.5% of revenue. Previous guidance called for revenue of $18 billion and
an Ebit margin of 14.25% to 14.75%. (Cummins doesn't issue earnings guidance.)
Those numbers imply that revenue for the second half of this year will fall
about 15% from the same period last year. Shares nonetheless seem a good deal.
Based on the lowest earnings estimate among more than 20 analysts who cover the
stock, shares trade at nine times 2012 earnings and 10 times 2013 earnings.
That's a discount to the broad U.S. stock market of about 40%. Based on more
optimistic forecasts, of course, the discount is larger. The current slowdown
is unlikely to resemble the 2009 one. should benefit from rising spending on
high-efficiency engines and components as the recent tightening of emissions
and fuel-economy standards in developed countries spreads around the world,
according to Morningstar analyst Basili Alukos. He notes that the stock has
historically traded at an average of 14 times earnings and calls it an
"interesting value proposition" at today's price. Cummins will present
third-quarter financial results on Oct. 30 and says it plans to cut 1,000 to
1,500 jobs by year's end. "The good news is that the negative earnings revision
is out of the way and [Cummins] tends to be proactive in regard to reducing
costs to meet weaker demand," wrote Credit Suisse analyst Jamie Cook in a
Wednesday client note. Investors who buy Cummins shares get a dividend yield of
2.3%, and payments seem safe, making up less than one-quarter of earnings. The
knock on industrial stocks is that their earnings could slip if the global
economy worsens. Tuesday's warning from Cummins suggests that risk is real but
manageable. Investors, meanwhile, are paying sky-high prices for dependable
earnings; the consumer staples sector in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index
trades at 17 times projected 2012 earnings, versus 14.4 times for the broader
index. If part of defensive investing is paying a low price, Cummins looks safe
enough. </blockquote>

WDC and STX margins appear to be at levels that we have never seen before, at
around 15-20% pretax.The question is really, if you believe, that this time is
different. In my opinion, the Thai flood last year created a capacity shortage,
that boosted margins to the current abnormally high levels, a situation, which
is likely to reverse to the mean, imo. I think this is one case where you need
to take the current fundamentals with a grain of salt, and estimate the
normalized margins to get the right picture. I have no idea what they would

How do you determine when the changes in demand are real and not reversible vs.
when they are temporary blip?

IMHO, every single value investment is a value investment because somebody
thinks that the demand for the company's products is going to be lower and/or
margins will drop.

If I look at my portfolio, all the companies there trade at cheap prices
because someone thinks that their earnings/CF will drop and continue dropping.
And for every single one of them someone can argue that the negative change is
structural, long-term or permanent.

So how do you decide when such expectation is correct and when it's not? Cause
if you were looking at expectations, you'd never buy a single value stock. Only
growth stocks have high expectations - and unfortunately high prices too.

I don't believe I have a way of determining with any certainty that drop in
demand is permanent and not reversible. As I sort of say, if it looks to me
like demand fall is caused by a macro/exogenous factor, and if I get scared
enough that it actually might be that permanent, I'll want to sell, and
sometimes I do, eventually. Sometimes I'll sell too if demand looks like it
will recover although it'll take several years.--- I tell myself I don't have
the patience to hold.

<blockquote>If I look at my portfolio, all the companies there trade at cheap
prices because someone thinks that their earnings/CF will drop and continue
dropping.</blockquote>

My view is that stocks are bought for a number of reasons and they're sold for
a number of reasons too. With our stocks like MSFT, DRAGF -- hard for me to
understand that the people who believe the earnings/cf of these companies will
drop and continue to drop have that kind of effect on the stock. Possible
though -- just hard for me to see that as the prime reason the stocks are
cheap.

I guess I don't have a silver bullet to resolve this question either. That's
why I asked you. :)

MSFT - the stock is cheap because people believe that MSFT era is over: PCs are
kaput, the PCs that are not kaput are Macs/Linux, web space is non-MSFT, mobile
space is non-MSFT too. So, yes, IMHO there is an argument that MSFT is in
secular decline. Not as fast/steep as newspapers or NOK/RIMM so far, but still.
(Yes, I know that MSFT has grown earnings so far - it's the perception of
decline, not the fact... yet?)

DRAGF - I think the issues are declining Euro economy + need for gas; uncertain
political situation in their natgas field locations; large holding by Arab
majority shareholder. So maybe these concerns are different from what you talk
about, but it is possible to interpret them as concerns for possible drop in
earnings/cf if the company fields suffer some kind of political change. I will
agree though that in general oil/gas demand is not in a secular decline,
although it may be in multiyear cyclical decline if we get a worldwide (or
Euro/China) recession.

As DRAGF has climbed, I do not consider it very cheap here, BTW.

Here's an example of a company in an area where I believe there is not a
permanent disastrous-type change in the macro environment, and so I believe
that the sector(s) will eventually return to some profitability. Guessing, I'll
say the perception of the company and its stock price should improve 12-18
months out for a 50% gain. I'm not so confident though that things can't worse
or that the stock price can't/won't continue to go lower, so I won't wager
anything more than a small amount. I will do that though.

Both Buffett and Graham could buy whatever they bought for cheap because a
large segment of market thought that these companies are in decline and priced
them accordingly. They thought differently.

Obviously there are exceptions to my statement. Sometimes the whole market is
cheap including growth companies. Sometimes market decides that some segment is
boring - not in decline, but just not fast growing enough. Perhaps these
opportunities are better than investing in stocks where market thinks the

There has been a lot of discussion on this thread that SSD will replace HD. I
don't think so in the near future because of price and the capacity limitation
with SSD. $.10 per gb(HD) $.99 per gb(SSD). that means if you bought a laptop

Hi Grommit -

Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH)

I started a small position in SNH. I would not call it a true "value" buy but
perhaps if it is compared to other medical REITs it might be a candidate at
current levels. The company has raised their dividend every year for the last
six years. You do raise a possible concern that fees charged may be reduced
if/when Medicare reimbursement amounts decrease but I think the market may have
priced this in the stock. The stock is off more than 10% from it's highs in
2011.

As with many of these REITs, debt levels are pretty high. 14.6x their net
annual income equals their long term debt amount ($1.96B). This is at the high
end as I would like to see something south of 10x's. The current yield for the
SNH common is 6.9%.

Insiders did buy shares in March 2011 at slightly higher prices so management
does have some skin in how the company performs. Nothing too exciting about BV
which is at $14.85/share or their PE that is quite high at 21.

My main interest is to capitalize on the future growth potential w/ the baby
boomer generation and their need for senior housing. My buy is really to
compliment my MPW shares which I feel is in the fully valued (to over valued)
price range.

SNH is well capitalized and may be in a position to acquire other marginal
property operators at value prices. Management appears to be an efficient and
good operator, so that is a bonus.

My initial buy is small but would like to build up a long term position,
hopefully at lower prices.

If you see any other candidate hospital/senior housing REITs and/or preferreds,
please post.

The business does not need to go away, in order to become a bad business. If it
starts to shrink in $ terms continuously, it probably becomes a bad business,
because a continuously shrinking business means continued restructuring
expenses to right size costs, and more competition for the remaining business.
Very few shrinking business are good business. The computers, printers,
newspapers, franking machines are not going to disappear, but those business
are, or may be shrinking.

That is the problem with trying to bottom fish, if the bottom is slowly falling
out. Have seen my fair share of working in shrinking business lines. It's not
fun (for the employees) and it typically isn't profitable either.

In addition, my experience seems to indicate, that betting on turnaround

RE: Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (MILL) 

Paul - It's probably best to stay away from this one after reading this
http://goo.gl/5k28u .

From the article

<blockquote>Miller Energy Resources (MILL) is an oil and gas exploration and
production company primarily focused on the Cook Inlet area of Alaska. On
12/10/2009, MILL acquired Cook Inlet Energy, consisting of the former Alaskan
assets of Pacific Energy Resources, in a competitive bankruptcy auction, paying
less than $5 million. Immediately after, MILL wrote the value of the assets up
to $480 million, booking a pre-tax gain on the acquisition of $460 million.This
unusual transaction and the dubious background of Miller's management and
financial partners has been covered in articles from The Street Sweeper, and I
would recommend you read them for additional background information, however I
believe a brief history of these assets is useful. The Cook Inlet assets that
Miller currently owns were originally acquired and developed by Forcenergy in
the late 90s. Forcenergy went bankrupt and eventually merged with Forrest Oil
Corp in 2000. Forest then sold the Alaskan assets of Forcenergy to Pacific
Energy in 2007, and Pacific Energy went bankrupt in early 2009, finally selling
a group of their Alaska assets to Miller Energy.This article will take a closer
look at the flawed assumptions MILL and their investors are using to derive the
company's reserve value, as well as the shaky financial footing the company is
currently on, both of which should concern current and potential investors in
MILL, especially if history repeats itself.</blockquote> My thinking was one
could play their preferred http://goo.gl/VAM1A (Miller Energy Resources, 10.75%
Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock) which was priced at a discount
to par @ $23.00/share. This preferred has only been trading a few days and is
down to $22.40/share.

Maybe in the teens it could be a speculative "value" buy and safer than owning
the common shares. The play is you own the assets of Pacific Energy Resources
that was bought by Miller in a competitive bankruptcy on the cheap. However,
management is suspect and they could be playing the preferred holders as fools
given the tone on the seeking alpha article.

For me, it's a better than holding the common shares but may not be worth the
risk.

I am watching and may nibble at a speculative buy if this trades in the teens.

It's still an interesting set of events that could pay off big if any of their
holdings get gobbled up by one of the large integrated Oil companies planning
to build that LNG facility.

You have been warned.

WDC/STX

I post here at risk as the moderator does not like my postings due to usual
options nature.

I just wanted to add one point to debate on disk drives. The big question to
the HDD makers is does enterprise/system/data center growth grow faster than
consumer shrinks and what is ASP/margin impact?

As to question earlier on margins, they had been noticeably above trend earlier
in year, noticeably. They have started to come in. Most of increase was
Thailand but some is industry structure. The question is how much does going to
effective duopoly help - and do SSDs get close enough in price to take back to
more competition.

In financials, STX and now WDC are massively buying back shares. At 4X PE, you
only have to survive a few years fir huge returns. Abd the cloud should drive
demand long enough for this. Even the yellow ages guys made it long enough for
the PE guys to get in and out with a few exceptions. This decline should be
much slower and prices paid for the stock are much cheaper.

STX is a big part of my portfolio.

Earlier this month Berkshire Hathaway added shares of DVA as it hit new highs.

This company is enjoying a duapoly with FMS in providing outpatient dialysis

FMS is in 40 countries, while DVA is focused primarily in this country.

Another co. in the healthcare sector that has a good history of fat profit
margins in USPH. They run medical clinics and rehab centers. There's little
debt and the stock pays a small div. The div. was initiated last year and was

I like USPH's business plan. They recognize that their business is dominated by
many small players and have grown to be the third largest co. in the U.S. in
their sector. Since 2005, they have made several acquisitions all funded by
their free cash flow.

There are financial presentations on their website if you are interested:

Thank's Sergio for the new names. I will add them to my watch list. I do think
that in the medical business, these "service" organizations do add a lot of
value and many of their positions require special certifications. As a result,
they can charge higher rates for their services but still the main driver on
prices is/are Government funded Medicare reimbursement rates.

As the populous ages, many of these out patient service organizations
(especially the larger companies that can grow by acquisition and/or
incorporate their "franchise" brand) should do well in the current environment.
This is much more cost effective than in-hospital stays and/or hospital
affiliated services. Their overhead is just too high.

I see a significant area emerging for these medical support services. Even
Walmart is offering services in this area from flu shots, eye glasses and
perhaps eventually certain types of out patient procedures. Medical technology
is advancing to where it is no longer necessary to have one or more doctors
oversee a procedure but rather only certified and licensed RN's.

The value proposition will be the new medical out patient procedures and or
therapy that can be provided at much less cost than current hospital rates. The
winners will be those companies that can "franchise" their quality brand and
qualify for Medicare reimbursement.

It will be a win/win for everyone.

LUK - decided to buy just a few shares @22.08$. Best risk reward situation with
this investment company for a long time, imo. I like the National beef deal, as
they are earning 20% on this investment, since they don't have to pay taxes on
earnings (NOL). I can see them expanding on this business over time, with
acquisitions.

The Fortuesce chapter was closed at what looks to me good conditions for LUK. I
also like that they paid off ~500M$ in debt. They biotech venture is a money
pit and should be sold or closed down, imo. The other business seem to be
plugging alon and improving. The MLI position was sold too, albeit at a steep
discount but at a small profit for LUK. I think the Leucadia guys are
accumulating dry powder for another big deal.

LUk should not regarded as a mini BRK, it's not comparable, at least not the
way BRK is right now. LUK does opportunistic investments in "fixer uppers" and
they do put their own management in place , both things that BRK does not do
(also WEB partnership in the days before BRK was the investment vehicle did

think the market may have priced this in the stock"

I also avoided all mortgage reits in favor of hard assets -- buildings. I was
occasionally jealous of the great div yields but i thought that they were too
risky.

clipped opinion:
Wrong side of the curve...mREITs make their profits by trading the interest
rate curve, i.e, buying short-term lower rate mortgages and selling longer-term
mortgages which bear higher rates. The difference between the two is their
revenue. It is my opinion that Bernanke's latest "QE to infinity" announcement
a month ago, will make it much more difficult for mREITs to make money because
of the tightening of this spread. In its latest Q3/2012 market commentary,
Annaly's management stated that: Spurred by global monetary policy, and aided
by fundamental credit improvement since the crisis, flows into the sector
continue driving yields and spreads to historic lows.

10:03 AM Liquidation in mortgage REITs picks up where it left off on Friday,
with nearly the entire sector lit up bright red. Leading today's decline is CYS
Investments ( CYS -4.6%) after being cut to hold at Wunderlich. No details are

are declining and mortgage refinance activity (prepays) is on the rise

2:44 PM Mortgage REITs continue to get repriced for lower yields going forward
with earnings reports from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo not bringing good news.
Both banks reported sliding net interest margins and booming mortgage business

I think I can pick up some cheap stocks/bargains going into year-end,
and so am raising cash as the opportunity presents itself to lighten up.

I think it's often not what you buy, or actual tactics, that determines how
well
you'll do, but how you position yourself strategically, where if the market
does
materially weaken for whatever reason - the European crisis, disappointing
earnings, tax related selling, the fiscal cliff, etc you are there to take
advantage
of it, and to do so in some size (relative to your means).

I guess I differ from Paul in this, but then, that's what makes a market.

Adding small to my losing position in Ceres Global Ag. as stock drops.

As discussed here and by CERGF management, Ceres is transitioning or has
transitioned from an investment company to an operating company. Earnings
aren't there though --- couple of issues being drought which has affected
storage business, and change in Canadian law which may or may not help Ceres.

"...the Canadian Government passed legislation ending the Canadian
Wheat Board’s (“CWB”) marketing monopoly on wheat and barley, to become
effective in
August 2012. As at the date of preparation of this interim MD&A, we are now in
this open
environment and grain is able to move freely into the United States and can be
hedged in the
Minneapolis Grain Exchange starting with the September futures contract.
Riverland Ag (ed: Ceres) is
currently acquiring Canadian wheat and the signs are encouraging that we will
be that we will be able to increase our position this fall..."

What I like about Ceres is management's presumed background as investors and
their focus on book value:

"We are beginning to make purchases to build out our inventory positions and
encouraged by the opportunities that integrated North American wheat and Barley
markets will mean to Riverland Ag.Furthermore,our investment in Stewart
Southern Railway continues to gather momentum, as its oil by rail shipments
continue to expand. Ceres will look to deploy its cash resources in support of
growth
in these two core investments. Finally, Management believes Ceres’ stock price
is significantly undervalued relative to the underlying value of its assets.
Therefore, while this discount exists,
Ceres will continue to deploy cash in the buyback of the Corporation’s shares."

If the company's assets are actually "significantly undervalued" and the
management team were investment managers, then I would expect them to want to -
and maybe actually - "deploy cash in...buyback(s)". For me - a person who is
usually interested in low price/stated bv as an investment criterion - I am
encouraged by the low price/bv I see here and management's apparent willingness
to do something about it.
Jmo. For others, who look at other metrics or have have different focus (like
the income statement here vs. the balance sheet), their view of the stock now
as a suitable buy may of course be different from my view.

Utilities: SRE: Thanks for the alert, Grommit. Maybe it's time I sell down the
position. The utility sector still doing very well as people go for the
necessary service they provide, their increasing dividends and/or their
relatively large dividend yields (compared to some gov't bonds). And as the
these stocks continue to move up, it may just reinforce the idea for yield
hounds that it was/is a good sector to be buying into.

I'm with EKS though -- it seems to me p/e's of 15 for gas/electric utility
companies.are too high -- that's growth stock territory (for me). Otoh, maybe
that's the new normal now. Water utilities have sold for p/e's well over 15 for
some time -- years.

Currently my domestic (USA) gas/elect ute's are: EXC, PPL, GAS, ATO, SO(SO

anyone else here) has ideas for less risky utes than SRE and that have lower
p/e, I'd be interested in knowing more.

Delta Air Lines to bring N.D. crude oil by train to its Trainer refinery
September 08, 2012|By Andrew Maykuth, Inquirer Staff Writer

<img src='http://articles.philly.com/images/pixel.gif'>

Who knew that the economic solution for the region's beleaguered oil refineries
would arrive on a slow train from North Dakota?

Delta Air Lines, the new owner of the Trainer refinery that is scheduled to
reopen later this month, on Thursday became the third fuel producer in the
Philadelphia area to announce plans to bring in crude oil by rail from the
Bakken oil field in the upper Midwest.

Edward Bastian, the airline's president, told an investor conference in New
York that Delta plans to replace some imported oil at Trainer with domestic
crude brought in by rail. The cheaper North Dakota crude could enhance the
airline's plans to produce its own jet fuel, Bastian said.

Story continues below.

<img src='http://articles.philly.com/images/pixel.gif'>
<img src='http://articles.philly.com/images/pixel.gif'>

"It's very early to draw any conclusions, but this could lead to even larger
savings," the airline executive told the Deutsche Bank Aviation and
Transportation Conference. Delta is counting on its subsidiary, Monroe Energy
L.L.C., to generate at least $300 million a year in savings by refining 80
percent of the airline's domestic fuel needs.

Delta joins a fast-growing queue of refiners who are building unloading
facilities and securing rail cars to tie into the North Dakota shale-oil boom,
where producers are employing the same hydraulic fracturing method used to
extract natural gas from Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale.

Without sufficient pipeline capacity to get the crude oil to refiners, Bakken
producers have resorted to moving the stuff by rail. Rail volumes of petroleum
products are 41 percent higher so far this year compared with the same period
last year, according to the Association of American Railroads.

BNSF Railway Co. on Tuesday announced it now has the capacity to move one
million barrels of crude oil a day out of the oil fields in North Dakota and
Montana. Rail tanker cars are in short supply.

"I don't think anyone expected it to grow this fast," said Krista York-Woolley,
a spokeswoman for BNSF Railway. "We don't see it stopping."

The rapid expansion of the rail network has taken experts by surprise because
moving oil by rail is much more expensive than by pipelines. "I never thought
we'd be talking about a million barrels a day of crude oil moving by rail,"
said Tom Kloza, chief analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. Kloza
estimates that it costs about $16 a barrel to transport crude oil by rail to
East Coast refineries. Bakken crude currently sells for about $20 less than oil
delivered from the North Sea and Africa, so refiners can make a few dollars
more per barrel by replacing the imported crude.

Some analysts question how long North Dakota crude will sell at a discount, but
Delta's Bastian said Thursday that nothing structural in the market suggests
the Bakken's price advantage will shrink "for the next several years."

Story continues below.

<img src='http://articles.philly.com/images/pixel.gif'>

Other refineries in the region are rapidly building facilities to unload the
100-car "unit" trains that will carry the crude on a six-day journey across
half the continent.

Philadelphia Energy Solutions, the joint venture of the Carlyle Group and
Sunoco that this month will take over operations of Sunoco's Philadelphia
refinery, plans to build a rail yard along the Schuylkill near 35th and Moore
Streets to handle up to two unit trains a day. The refinery could take up to
140,000 barrels of Bakken crude oil a day - about 42 percent of the plant's
330-barrel-a-day capacity.

PBF Energy, which operates the Delaware City Refinery in Delaware, in July
postponed a $1 billion expansion of the refinery and instead launched a $60
million rail-unloading project to handle up to 100,000 barrels a day of crude
by rail. The refinery has a capacity of about 190,000 barrels.

The Delaware refinery is designed to handle heavy crude oil, which means it may
be targeting petroleum extracted from Canadian oil sands. The Bakken oil is a
light, sweet crude, more compatible with the Philadelphia and Trainer
refineries.

But sweet crude produces more gasoline, which is less profitable for refiners
than such distillates as diesel, jet fuel and heating oil.

Kloza, the oil analyst, questions whether Delta can accommodate large volumes
of North Dakota crude because it is configuring the Trainer refinery to
optimize jet fuel production.

Utilities. I agree that 15 PE sounds high for such a low growth sector. So
utilities are not my 1st choice of sectors. We both own GAS and ATO. Look at
ATO, for example: EPS at $2.30 and $2.47 for 2012-2013. That's a 15 PE. I think
that most investors only see that the dividend is 3.8% and is safe based on
$1.38 dividend and $2.30 EPS. Many div seekers do not care about PE (in error).
That view is the norm on the SI div thread. Anyway -- I also own NEE and LNT.
Utilities are 6.7% of my portfolio.

Re CSX - I think it is a play on coal, industrial demand, housing and higher
diesel prices at the same time. UNP is the better franchise, but the price is a
bit rich. I just happened to be that the market overreacted (imo) to CSX
earnings release, so the stock was available at a decent price. For me, buying
stock, is a little bit like going fishing, I put lines out (GTC limit orders)
and at the end of the day, I check what i have on the hook or not. A little bit
haphazard but the market is often a little irrational in the short run, and you
get stocks a few % cheaper than just buying at prevailing market this way (or
you end up with stock that you shouldn't have bought because you missed some
news and didn't pull you limit order ).

I believe that many dividend investors are oversimplifying. They (rightly)place
a large emphasis on past dividend rates, but don't seem to care if coverage
ratios have decreased or in some cases, the dividends and share buybacks have
partly financed by debt. I think PEP is an example that had a great dividend
growth rate in the past ( easy to do, since they started at a very small base)
but now are stretching the limits in terms of coverage (~50%) where I think
they have to easy on the stock buybacks.
This is particularly true, since they acquired their bottles , which increased
their debt load and also their Capex requirements, without achieving much in
terms of synergies as far as i can tell. The dividend crowd does not seem to
mind any of this, they look at the past record and seem willing to extend this
is in the future, notwithstanding the fact that all these things imply much
slower growth rate going forward. In the long run, the earning growth rates
determines the dividend growth rate.

This is where I get confused, value, PE's etc...so simply stated,
potential/future earnings has no value? PE is a rear view mirror calculation,
no? Maybe I'm to simplistic("keep it simple stupid"), at the end of the day
whether investing in growth, value or whatever-I think it still comes down to
basic potential.

( I think many dividend investors have ridden these increased PE's to large
capital gains and are content to sit tight, collect/reinvest the divy and wait
for the E to catch up to the P.)

I'm not sure how CSX can be a positive play on coal as there doesn't seem to be
a catalyst to help in that area.
A Bloomberg opinion piece outlines the stark reality facing coal.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-17/championing-coal-romney-and-obama-igno
e-its-dark-side.html

CSX has hung in there with pricing and productivity gains. But without
increases in revenues, (consolidated revenues were down 2%) CSX looks, at best,
a play on the economy. (Currently, they have five hundred employees on furlough
and more than three hundred engines in storage.)

Below are comments regarding Deutsche Bank's downgrade.
Deutsche Bank downgraded CSX (NYSE: CSX) from Buy to Hold with a price target
of $20.00 (from $25.00).

The firm comments, "We are downgrading shares of CSX to Hold (from Buy) as we
now see a balanced risk/reward given coal headwinds (utility coal volumes are
expected to continue to decline in H1 2013 and export volume comparisons are
challenging given lower export thermal forward prices and weaker global
economic growth forecasts). Despite expected core pricing gains and
productivity improvements next year, we believe mix and coal headwinds will
constrain earnings improvement as we are now modeling flat y/y EPS in 2013. As
a result of these challenges, we have lowered our target P/E multiple to 11x,
which implies a $20 PT using our 2013 EPS estimate of $1.78."
