room, it's not that fact that management grants itself stock options and
restricted shares it is a matter of how much. GLBC has about 23m shares
outstanding, so 2.2M options is not peanuts. And since they are underwater they
have issued 1.3M restricted stock, which is basically an option with 0$ strike
price. Typically a company should limit dilution to less than 2%, especially if
it is loosing money...

 On December 9, 2003, the company issued employee stock options of
approximately 2.2 million shares. On March 8, 2004, the company issued
additional awards of approximately 1.2 million shares of restricted stock
units.

Spek, with all due respect, you have to go DEEPER in your analysis of these
companies...glbc has 40m common shares. (In addition, ST Telemedia’s subsidiary
holds 18,000,000 shares of restricted preferred stock in New GCL, which are
convertible into shares of New GCL’s common stock on a one-for-one basis.) STT
holds a preferred that is COMMON EQUIVELANT...so it looks like 1.2 million
shares could be issued someday given 2.2m options are way way out of the money
right now.

as for comparing price to sales ratios, that's not going to get it done either.
These companies have different business models, different capital structures,
different maturity levels, (comparing icgc and gx to algx is silly) different
opportunities...If you go off and read a little bit about what xo (and others)
had to say about its purchase of algx (the synergies) you will understand why
algx might have been more valuable to XO (far more) than to any other bidder.
For starters, because the two are highly complementary, they can cut upwards of
$160m out of the combined cost structure. That's for starters. Carl Icahn is an
extremely savvy buyer of corporate assets. It is highly unlikely he overpaid
for a company he bought out of BANKRUPTCY.

room, I know that all these companies have different business models but they
seam to have quite comparable gross margins and they revenue losses are about
the same as well (high single digits). So I do not see a reason why there
should be a high valuation gap in between those. I have also read about the
Allegiance merger and the cost savings. The 160M$ number seems very very high
to me, but i guess we will see. I am pretty comfortable watching this from the

TFT LCD makers: March sales estimates

Yvonne Young, Taipei; Carrie Yu, DigiTimes.com [Thursday 1 April 2004]

AU Optronics (AUO), Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO) and Chunghwa Picture Tubes
(CPT) all estimate strong March sales while HannStar Display sees only slight
growth, according to the companies.

AUO expects to see record revenues this month, higher than last month’s
NT$12.48 billion, as its 3.5-generation (3.5G) and 4G TFT LCD plant are both
running at full capacity, and its 5G plant has reached 60,000-glass substrate
monthly processing capacity.

CMO also estimates record revenues to exceed February’s NT$7.92 thanks to LCD
TV panel orders from Japanese customers and improved 5G yield rate.

CPT, apart from estimated record revenues in March, expects its PDP (plasma
panel display) shipments to steadily grow through May. Its March PDP shipments
have exceeded 4,000 units. The company bases its optimistic March sales
estimate on strong 17-inch LCD monitor demand, improved 4.5G yield rate and
higher 15-inch panel prices.

HannStar said its March sales will only slightly increase from February’s
NT$3.07 billion due to slow ramping of its 5G capacity but anticipates strong
monthly sales in the second quarter after the plant reaches output of 50,000 to
60,000 panels next month.

Nrgn: low hanging fruit for you Madharry, but fruit not easily seen by me. If I
could get the $9.22 stock under $7, which is what the $100M in equity was paid
in the private placement, I might be interested. I'm guessing there's no
profits to be forthcoming in the next year, so I further speculate that the
stock price could fluctuate as drug discovery and development companies prices
seem to me to do. So I might get a chance at NRGN at a below $7 price.

Not really a great time for value investors to buy stocks today with the market
up being up strongly. Still...I'll double up and average up on my exploratory
position in JAX, a stock I've held since last June, and could've added to at
lower prices, but did not.

I am holding CAG, DLM, and SLE also, but not SVU (I'm not critical of SVU - I
just did not buy when stock was attractively priced). Motley Fool had a recent
positive article on DLM; I am considering adding to my DLM position if the
stock will drop. I still suffer with small positions in large-company grocery
stocks KR, SWY, & ABS as Wal-Mart tears up the market. Other food
stocks/related in my portfolio are FDP, GMK, IBA, VLGEA, COST, CSG, plus a
couple more.

Coal-- I lost patience at the beginning of the run up in coal stocks and sold
my position. And just did not see the strength or dynamism of the China pull,
and so I was not willing to buy back during the coal stocks' rapid climb. I did
buy a few shares of RIO recently. As posted, I'm also in coal in a back door

- I seldomly post on here - but over the years, I'm pretty sure i have a 100%
track record - & this is verifiable by going to "Peoplemarks" on here - anyway
- here's my first of 2 value picks:

- INV - American Residential - trades at $9.06 - book value of $10.42 -
earnings were projected to be $1.50 - $2 - but then guidance withdrawn - not
lowered or raised - just withdrawn due to too many variables - INV takes
mortgage apps off of brokers' hands - fund the mortgages - then sell the
mortgage pools to companies such as Countrywide & Washington Mutual - INV is
the biggest player by far in this sector - so since they don't service the
loans - their risk of default is negligible

- the good news & bad news is that INV has only 8.5 mill shs o/s fully diluted
- so it's good because they're making a ton on e.p.s. - but bad because
institutions can't easily get into such an illiquid stock

- INV just came out with fundings for March of $877 mill; which were far higher
than anyone on the yahoo boards projected

- per 3/5/04 news release - D3 Family Funds Buys 1.1 Million Shares of American
Residential From Home Asset Management Corp. - for $9.50 Per Share - David
Nierenberg From D3 Appointed Director

- so basically this turnaround fund thinks $9.50 is a good entry point - if INV
delivers on its $2 eps for 2004; after earning $3.70 for 2003; with book value
of $10.42; then I have to believe INV can easily double or triple from here.
Good luck.

My second value play is Synergy Financial Group (SYNF) - which just completed
its mutual to stock conversion at $10/share. Now at $10.22

- As of 12/31/03 - Total assets of $628.6 mill; total liabil of $587.7 mill;
equity of $40.9 mill

- During the 1Q04, synf fully converted, adding about $65 mill; giving total
equity as of 3/31/04 of around $106 mill

- They have about 12.5 mill shs o/s. For book value of $8.48/share

- Earnings for 2003 were $3.4 mill - based on 12.5 mill shs - only .27/eps

- However, earnings are growing at a great clip. Earnings for 2001: $1.9 mill;
for 2002: $2.0 mill; for 2003: $3.4 mill

- More importantly, banks are being gobbled up for over 2X book. Synergy’s book
is around $8.48. Stock trades at 10.22. So plenty of upside.

- Bottom line: I think SYNF is a good value play; strong earnings with low
writeoffs; high book value; and great takeover candidate

The CEO put the quarter into context:"Ken Shifrin, APS Chairman of the Board

We really need to clear this up. AMPH makes 2/3 of its money from financial
services and the 1/3 from insurance management for a physician-owned malpractie
insurance company. They are not an insurance underwriter.

It's all spelled out clearly in the 10-K:

OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES

Through our subsidiaries, APS Financial Corporation, or APS Financial, and APS
Asset Management, Inc., or Asset Management, we provide investment and
investment advisory services to institutions and individuals throughout the
United States. Our revenues from this segment were 64% and 59% of our total
revenues in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

APS Financial is a fully licensed broker/dealer that provides brokerage and
investment services primarily to institutional and high net worth individual
clients. APS Financial also provides portfolio accounting, analysis, and other
services, to insurance companies, banks, and public funds. APS Financial has
its main office in Austin, Texas with branch offices in Houston, Texas and
Redmond, Washington.

APS Financial charges commissions on both exchange and over-the-counter, or
OTC, transactions in accordance with industry practice. When APS Financial
executes OTC transactions as a dealer, it receives, in lieu of commissions,
markups or markdowns.

APS Financial is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., or NASD, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, or SIPC, the
Securities Industry Association, and, in addition, is licensed in 44 states and
Washington D.C.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every registered broker/dealer doing business with the public is subject to
stringent rules with respect to net capital requirements promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. These rules, which are designed to
measure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker/dealers, specify
minimum net capital requirements. Since we (as opposed to APS Financial) are
not a registered broker/dealer, we are not subject to these rules. However, APS
Financial is subject to these rules. Compliance with applicable net capital
requirements could limit APS Financial's operations, such as limiting or
prohibiting trading activities that require the use of significant amounts of
capital. A significant operating loss or an extraordinary charge against net
capital could adversely affect the ability of APS Financial to expand or even
maintain its present levels of business. At February 28, 2004, APS Financial
was in compliance with all applicable net capital requirements.
APS Financial clears its transactions through SWS Securities, Inc., or SWS, on
a fully disclosed basis. SWS also processes orders and floor reports, matches
trades, transmits execution reports to APS Financial and records all data
pertinent to trades. APS Financial pays SWS a fee based on the number and type
of transactions.

Asset Management, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, was formed and registered with the SEC in 1998. We formed Asset
Management to manage fixed income and equity assets for institutional and
individual clients on a fee basis. Asset Management's mission is to provide
clients with investment results within specific client-determined risk
parameters.

OUR INSURANCE SERVICES

As of December 31, 2003, APS Insurance Services, Inc., or Insurance Services,
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. Prior to October 1, 2003, we owned 80% of
Insurance Services. On October 1, 2003 we acquired the remaining 20% minority
interest in APS Insurance Services for approximately $2.0 million in cash (see
Note 14). APS Insurance Services, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries APS
Facilities Management, Inc., dba APMC Insurance Services, Inc., or FMI, and
American Physicians Insurance Agency, Inc., or Agency, provides management and
agency services to medical malpractice insurance companies. Our revenues from
this segment contributed 36% and 41% of our total revenues in 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Substantially all of our revenue from this segment was attributable to FMI
providing management services to American Physicians Insurance Exchange, or
APIE, a reciprocal insurance exchange, wholly-owned by its subscriber
physcians. A reciprocal insurance exchange is an organization that sells
insurance only to its subscribers, who pay, in addition to their annual
insurance premiums, a contribution to the exchange's surplus. These exchanges
generally have no paid employees but instead enter into a contract with an
"attorney-in-fact" that provides all management and administrative services for
the exchange. As the attorney-in-fact for APIE, FMI receives a percentage of
the earned premiums of APIE, as well as a portion of APIE's profits. The amount
of these premiums can be adversely affected by competition. Substantial
underwriting losses, which might result in a curtailment or cessation of
operations by APIE, would also adversely affect FMI's revenue and, accordingly,
our revenue. To limit possible underwriting losses, APIE currently reinsures
its risk in excess of $250,000 per medical incident. APIE offers medical
professional liability insurance for physicians in Texas and Arkansas. FMI's
assets are not subject to any insurance claims by policyholders of APIE.

regional banks which have had a good run. As we were reminded last week, where
interest-rate exposure is concerned the market will shoot first and ask
questions later.

I'm very quick to sell when a sector weakens. This portfolio is the equity from
selling our house and we are living on the income. "In the long run we are all

My questions regarding SYNF:
Why did they raise so much capital in relative terms? The last stock sale for
10$ will bring their sharecount from 3.4M shares to over 10 million shares.
Their capital ratios per Dec 31 2003 (before the stock sale) seemed OK, so why
do they raise so much capital?

hi, paul...
Some transactions for me at the open today. I doubled up on ConocoPhilipps
today... 2004 PE is under 11. Also, added to Valero... 2004 PE is under 9.

Completely bailed on Safeway... I'll look at it again if the forward PE drops
to single digits. My biggest loser ever.

I added to Microsoft again today.

Warning on United Utilities... yahoo's earnings estimates have a five year
forward earnings growth rate of negative 5%. I have no idea what this is based
on. If I believed it, I would not invest at these levels. I expect flattish
growth (which oddly the 2005 estimate predicts).

I'll take some FLCN here.

Not really a fan of IPO's, but FLCN has some attraction for me. FLCN makes
loans to car dealers (not their customers).

I seem to be drawn to car dealerships and their stocks. Maybe it's my disease
of "new car fever". Some dealership stocks have done okay, and as I've
reported, I'm still buying some shares in this sector. Sometimes too, the
stocks of companies that support those dealerships are interesting (i.e.
profitable). I've posted on the ones I've bought; I assume though this sector
or the stock prices of the companies are not attractive to readers. FLCN, being
a small business and an IPO too, possibly holds even less interest. It's
difficult to get history, and Yahoo doesn't give a financial summary. Per
Yahoo, the one analyst who follows the stock says it has a forward p/e of 7+,
based on 9/'05 earnings. 9/'05? Nobody should put much belief in numbers that
far out, esp. if only by one analyst. I do expect though, that barring terribly
adverse events, I will be holding the stock at least 2-3 years.

Stock's about at the IPO price.

I notice that Third Avenue Management (Marty Whitman's co.) is a large
institutional owner. That's a nice positive, imo.

On INV, i previously said the latest earnings guidance was $1.50 - $2 - but
here's the latest-latest from yahoo boards:

Revised 2004 guidance from 1/16/04 was $1.40 to $1.60 per share. The Company
has $4.00 of excess cash per share, and a PE excluding this excess cash of 3.3
times. Clearly, the company is undervalued and with a quarter or two of
profitability under its belt we should see multiple expansion. Further upside
available through a capital event (repurchase of stock or special dividend), or
simply the deployment of this excess cash to grow earnings. DN seems to have
strong track record and I've been watching his public >5% investments - AMED is
a great example. I bought at $4.00/share about three years ago and stock is now

• high/low - $12.01-14.25; now @ $13.15
• csbk just converted to a stock bank in mar ’04 - winds up with about 14 mill
shs - I’m getting all my info from thier 424B3 - filed on 1/28/04
• net income for 6 months ending 9/30/03 - only $2.0 mill; or $4.1 mill for
year. This works out to e.p.s. of .29/share; and a p/e of 51.22 based on share
price of $15. But of course, once they deploy their ipo proceeds, all things
being equal, the overall earnings and eps will become much more impressive
• they have no debt other than deposits
• Retained earnings is $75.1 mill; plus $130 million from ipo - would give
$205.1 mill in equity - $205/14 mill shs - book value of $14.65 per share after
the offering - not sure about this calc - b/c looks like bunch of $$’s going to
one of the holding companies
• bottom line: recently converted bank; trades below book value; solid
earnings. I think the stock price will go up to the banking “takeover” avg of
at least 2X book - or $30+ - when the banking sector comes back to life

BDK raises estimates. (Disclosure: It is in my top 5 of my portfolio)

ATLANTA, April 6 (Reuters) - Tool maker Black & Decker Corp.(NYSE:BDK - News)
on Tuesday raised its first-quarter earnings forecast, citing strong demand in
North America.

The company's shares rose 2.2 percent in early trading.

The Towson, Maryland, maker of Price Pfister faucets, Kwikset locks and DeWalt
drills said it expects earnings from continuing operations to be in the range
of 90 cents to 93 cents a share, up from its previous guidance of 65 cents to
70 cents a share. A year earlier, Black & Decker had earnings of 55 cents, it
said.

Analysts on average expect 69 cents a share, according to Reuters Research, a
unit of Reuters Group Plc.

Black & Decker said it expects sales to rise 16 percent in the first quarter,
or mid-single-digit sales growth excluding currency translations and
acquisitions.

Neil H., Brendan Watt, thanks for the SU posts. Considering SU with more focus,
and given today's market sell off, I've decided to take a position in SU at
this point (which I'm doing now).

Fwiw, I also took a smaller start in REP.

I realize I'm dancing with a lot of girls here, but imo, if oil continues its
rise - it sure seems like demand is going to increase- , and if I hold on to
the stocks as I plan to, overall it still should work out okay for me.

Essentially, I'm just continuing to add more oil stocks to my own private
specialized, oil "mutual fund": large caps, small caps, transportation,
refining, etc. Continuing to make a bigger bet on oil than I have.

Not really difficult to manage many small positions; they're up on Yahoo, so I
can track them. For the written reports that I receive from companies in the
sector, I'll likely at most just glance over 'em. Although I always acknowledge

S&P raises BDK target to $73 and estimates to $4.84. Separately, Lehman
Brothers today raised their estimates to $5.00, saying that sales growth is
likely to continue a few more quarters driven by strong housing and consumer
spending.

First Call shows 7 analysts with a hold rating and 1 with underperform (also 2
with a "buy" and 3 "strong buy.") I think some of those first 8 will follow
suit and raise their estimates and rating after the CC April 20. But even if
I'm wrong BDK is reasonably valued here.

Black & Decker (BDK ): Maintains 5 STARS (buy)
Analyst: Amrit Tewary

Black & Decker raised its first-quarter earnings per share guidance to 90 cents
to 93 cents, up from the prior estimate of 67 cents to 70 cents. Citing strong
demand in its North American business, the household appliances maker now
expects to report sales growth of 16% for the quarter, or mid-single digit
growth excluding currency translation and acquisitions. Based on higher sales
growth expectations, S&P is raising the first-quarter earnings per share
estimate to 92 cents, from 70 cents, and is upping the full-year 2004 estimate
to $4.84, from $4.40. S&P's 12-month target price of $73, raised today from
$66, is based on S&P's historical p-e model and assumes a target p-e of 15
times S&P's 2004 earnings per share estimate.

My model is telling me the market is very dangerous right now - the most risky

I don't see the conflict between the two statements. If "huge profits" are made
if money is invested when P/E ratios are low, and now one is putting money to
work when P/E ratios are high, it seems to follow that one might expect less
return, and perhaps even negative returns if the P/E multiples contract.

I'm still of the belief that there is money to be made in any market, if one is
positioned to properly exploit the opportunities. Value wears lots of

Employment Games and Other Silly Statistics
The New Value Revolution...
Same Old Misunderstandings
Paying the Piper, the Painter, and the Librarian
Cheap Is Cheap, Value's Something Else
Margaritaville, Gold and Vancouver

By John Mauldin
April 9, 2004

This week we take a look at what value really means, and I offer a few
thoughts on the recent employment numbers. They may not be what you think.

I am taking a little R&R this weekend, and have asked my friend Lynn
Carpenter who is the editor of the Fleet Street Letter and The Optionist
to give us her thoughts on value investing. It is a wise and witty essay,
and I commend it to you.

But first, let me make some brief comments on the recent employment
numbers. The market went crazy on Friday as the Bureau of Labor Statistics
told us 308,000 new jobs were created, far beyond the expectations of even
the most wild-eyed optimists. As an aside I should note the futures market
went crazy about 90 minutes before the announcement of the official
figures, as S&P futures were up big and fast before anyone supposedly saw
the numbers. Now, the Fed, the White House and various relevant agencies
saw the report the evening before, as well as the guys at the BLS. I am
sure no traders got to see an early "hint." It must have been some
optimistic traders starting a trend and then someone wondering what they
knew and then some program trading kicking in, with the momentum guys all
jumping on the bandwagon. These things can happen. It is just that they
don't usually happen 90 minutes before a BLS announcement, many of which
have been quite disappointing in recent months.

Even so, inquiring minds would like to see a print of the tape and know
who was buying and why. If it was innocent, it was a gutsy call. But that
doesn't tell us anything about the underlying employment numbers.

Employment Games and Other Silly Statistics

I remember seeing the BLS report headlines flash across my screen and
thinking, "Finally, some good news. About time." Ever the optimist, I
should have waited a few hours. Bill King sent this note out to his
readers:

"We have never seen such a grossly misinterpreted Employment Report in our
30 years in this biz...

"...About release of the report, we immediately noticed some huge red
flags. How could non-farm payrolls explode 308k when a) the unemployment
rate increased to 5.7%; b) wage growth was less than expected at 0.1%; c)
the "employed population ratio" actually FELL to 62.1% from 62.2%; d) the
"employment participation rate" was unchanged at 65.9%; e) total
employment was unchanged at 138.3m and most importantly f) the average
workweek fell 0.1 to 33.7, which is near a 40-year low (33.5)!

"When dissecting the numbers we learned that NSA (non-seasonally adjusted)
service job wages fell 8 cents and they accounted for 230k of the 308k job
growth. Leisure & hospitality wages NSA fell 4 cents; and NSA avg hours
worked fell 0.3. Something is obviously wrong. Healthcare contributed
36k jobs, leisure & hospitality 28k, retail 47k, government created 31k
and the phantom jobs estimated to be created by small business was 153k!
This is now known as the business birth/death rate. Apparently a large
number of workers entered the workforce in order to force the unemployed
rate higher, but still something seemed incredibly wrong."

Lacy Hunt of Van Hoisington Management tells us what the "wrongness" is
(as did several others on Monday, after digging through the data over the
weekend. Of the 308,000 jobs created, 296,000 are temporary or part-time
jobs! "In March, the number of persons who worked part time for economic
reasons increased to 4.7 million, about the same level as in January.
These individuals indicated that they would like to work full time but
were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because
they were unable to find full-time jobs."

Wages and hours fell slightly, which is not consistent with out-sized job
growth. Certain figures in the statistics just don't add up. Again from
Bill King: "In the Employment report there is this illumination in Table
A-7: 'NOTE: Detail shown in this table will not necessarily add to totals
because of the independent seasonal adjustment of the various series.
Beginning in January 2004, data reflect revised population controls used
in the household survey.' So we checked to see why the caveat. 'More
unemployed' increased 182k; but in the table, men age 20+ saw unemployment
increase 182k. Women age 20+ had a 142k increase in unemployment. That
totals 346k more unemployed by real math, but not BLS seasonally adjusted
math. http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t07.htm

But on the bright side, the usually reliable TrimTab looks at the same
figures and think BLS doesn't know how to add. Applying a year-over-year
methodology, TrimTab says non-farm employment actually increased by
519,000 employees, representing an improvement of 211,000 jobs over BLS
data.

The January and February employment numbers were also revised upwards by a
total of nearly 90,000 jobs. The job gains came primarily in the
construction sector, which added 71,000 jobs reflecting strong demand for
new housing, and the retail service sectors. March marked the first month
since August of 2000 that there were no job losses in the manufacturing
sector.

So, who's right? The optimists or the pessimists? If you are looking for
the monthly BLS survey to tell you, I think you are wasting your debating
time. The numbers are estimated, based upon a "survey," seasonal
adjustments and a host of guessing games. Again, these are estimates which
will inevitably be adjusted as real numbers begin to show up a lot later.
The staff at the BLS does yeoman work, and I believe they sincerely do
their best, but latest month reports are subject to fluctuations due to
assumptions. We all know the old line about what assumptions can do.

Remember, we are looking at very small percentages in estimating the
employment rate and the number of jobs created. There are 147,000,000 some
odd workers in the US. 308,000 jobs is 0.2% of total jobs. Lately, the
normal move is less than 1/10 of 1%. Do you really think they are anywhere
near that accurate on a most recent month basis?

The value of the report is to see the trends over longer periods of time.
The trends are clearly getting better than last year. Should we get
excited (or distraught) over any one month's report? Probably not. Leave
that nonsense for the politicians.

But the trends also show job growth weakness as compared to previous
recoveries. This recent report suggests a new trend may be starting, one
which is consistent with the weakness in job growth. Remember when I wrote
a month or so ago that there were large numbers coming to the end of their
welfare checks starting in the first quarter? There was a significant
increase in the number of people looking for work in this most recent
report. Coincidence? I think not. Evidently they decided it was better to
get part-time or temporary jobs than remain without any income. I
personally know that lack of money can clarify your priorities. That may
be the lesson to take from this report and one which bears watching, to
see if there is a new trend being started here: part-time and temporary
work on the rise. Such is not the stuff of legendary recoveries, nor
contented voters.

Also, I suspect, but have no statistical proof (although reasonable
anecdotal evidence exists), that many companies are hiring "temporary"
workers because such workers do not come with health and other benefits,
nor do they bring a rise in unemployment insurance if they leave.

The bond market went into full retreat on these numbers, thinking the Fed
will soon be able to raise rates. This data does nothing to suggest the
Fed is going to feel free to move any time soon. Indeed, I exchanged a few
emails with Greg Weldon on that note, and he wrote back:

"THE source of strength ... Part-Time for Economic Reasons ... Up Huge,
enough to suggest Full-Time jobs contracted, and a thought FULLY supported
by the disinflationary Earnings and Aggregate Hours figures...Let alone
the new HIGH in Number Wanting a Job ... and rise in Unemployed More than
27 Weeks ...AND ... DROP in Employment/Population Ratio. Hardly enough to
'budge' the Fed."

There are some monthly statistics from government sources that I think are
reliable and meaningful. I would pay attention and adjust investment and
trading strategies based upon them. But trading or investing based upon
the most recent household employment survey? I leave that to those with
more seasonally adjusted intuition. Or to those who get early hints.

Again, trends in the statistic can give us some clues, but monthly numbers
are there to be gamed by the fast and nimble. If you are not in that
crowd, I suggest you not play the game.

This is all the more reason to look to value as a reason to invest. Let's
enjoy what Lynn Carpenter has to say.

The New Value Revolution... Same Old Misunderstandings

Five years ago, value investors were dinosaurs. Young men were hissing
that Warren Buffett was all washed up. The score since then: Berkshire
Hathaway up 30%, Nasdaq down 20%.

How things have changed. Now everyone who got caught in the bubble has
taken up the value religion. But touring a mosque doesn't make you a
Muslim. These days I hear more unadulterated claptrap in the name of value
than there ever was silliness in the name of growth.

Value investing has roots that go back hundreds of years to when upper
class families in England provided for their heirs with English gilts,
high-quality bonds. The father of American value investing, Columbia
professor and money manager, Benjamin Graham made a direct connection
between bonds and value...

It's all about acquiring an asset that produces a stream of earnings at a
fair price. The asset's proper value depends on future earnings it will
garner. If you pay grandly today for meager capacity to make profits
tomorrow, you are not a value investor. That's it. That's the nut, the
essence, the very spirit of value investing in a paragraph.

Unfortunately, describing it is not doing it, and it's in the doing that
things go agley. It's easy to figure out what a brand-new bond is worth.
It pays a set dividend, so you know exactly how much money is coming in
eventually. A hundred years ago, most investors bought stocks much the
same way... the price was related to the dividend they'd get, but even
better. Stocks don't expire. As long as the company was in business, it
paid.

How Value Investing Paid the Piper, and the Painter, and the Librarian

All across America, but particularly along the East Coast cities,
symphonies, libraries, art museums and schools were endowed with stocks of
railroads, steel companies and other industrial giants in the 19th
century. They benefactors expected the dividends to support their
charities to infinity.

Then the world changed. Not only did American industry begin a downward
path in the 20th century, stocks in general stopped paying high dividends,
and investors began to look for other attributes, predominately growth.

In some cases, these fortunate 19th century institutions found themselves
in dire trouble when the 20th century rolled around and their fortunes
were tied to particular stocks. Dividends were barely enough to keep the
electricity on. I recall reading a story several years back about a museum
here in Baltimore that had to go to court to get permission to sell the
B&O railroad stock in its endowment fund. The founder had decreed that the
stock should never be sold, nor the principal touched. Alas, 100 and some
years later, the stock no longer paid enough in dividends to support the
institution. Worse, the company was headed into oblivion.

Now that's buy and hold!

But since John asked me to write about value in general, I'd like to slay
a few leading myths today. First, the notion that value is boring.

There Is No Straightjacket on Value-Let It Grow

Chief among the odd notions that I hear about value investing is that it's
radically different than growth investing. Staid. Limited to mature, slow-
growth companies that pay dividends.

But if you would think back to that short description of value investing I
gave you earlier, you will see that's obviously not right. It's completely
illogical, in fact. If value investing is buying a stock at a reasonable
price related to its stream of earnings, a company that is earning more
and more money certainly ought to be a value candidate... if the price is
right. In fact, Warren Buffett once said, "value and growth are joined at
the hip."

A value investor can certainly be a growth investor. I am. In the past
year, I recommended several growth stocks in Fleet Street Letter. Among
them: Zimmer Holdings, which has gone up 74% in the last year, and Guitar
Center, which has gone up 68%, and GTech Holdings which rose 108%.

So, if anybody has told you that value stocks are only maiden-aunt stocks
that rise 10-15% a year at best, tell him to get a good book and learn
something. In fact, I can recommend an excellent one to start with: How to
Think Like Benjamin Graham and Invest Like Warren Buffett, by Lawrence A.
Cunningham.

What all those nice double-digit winners I just mentioned (and many more)
had in common was that their price was fair and their expectations were
outstanding.

Which brings me to the second most common myth about value among the
uninformed...

Cheap Is Cheap, Value's Something Else

Last week when I spoke to John on the phone, he mentioned that most people
seem to think value stocks are ones that have fallen a lot, and now that
they're cheaper they're values.

Well, Enron fell a lot. But it was no value.

Companies on the way to bankruptcy fall a lot. They're not values either.

Companies with earnings disappointments of a lingering nature and
declining sales are usually cheap. They're not values.

In short, a 2002 Hyundai for $20,000 is not a value. A 2002 Mercedes S-600
would be a steal. Value means value, not cheap. A stock may have risen
100% in the last year and still be a value.

In fact, I can give you an example of this. In 2000, I added Centex to the
Fleet Street portfolio. Since then, it has gone up 308%... and it is still
a value stock. It is still-even with doubts about interest rates and
overbuilding-priced at a discount to its earnings expectations.

How can I tell? I use several metrics, including price to sales, price to
cash flow, price to EPS growth, price to book value (plus earnings and
sales growth outlooks and many other criteria). But the one I haven't
mentioned yet is the value metric most people associate with finding a
"cheap" value stock-the price to earnings ratio, or P/E.

A Simple Measure for Simple-Minded Folks

I always look at P/E ratios. That, after all, is the embodiment of the
value idea... a good price relative to its earnings. Or it should be.

In truth, it doesn't work out so purely.

But let me step sideways here and ask you another question. Would you be
willing to marry a tall, blue-eyed blonde?

OK, the honey of your dreams just popped into your head. But would you
really accept bad breath, a scary uncle in the Mafia, a mother-in-law
who's going to move in with you, a screechy voice, a terrible temper, no
sense of humor and acne? That's probably not the dream you had in mind.

So it is with low P/E ratios. They are the tall, blue-eyed blondes. But
they may have dire faults nonetheless. Anyone who only looks at the
current P/E ratio and doesn't compare it to the industry norm or the
company's own outlook or check the quality of the earnings reported in the
first place is taking a dangerous shortcut. You might as well mail order a
bride.

Many low P/E stocks are not values, they are traps.

The big problem is the quality of the E. There are a thousand ways a
company can generate misleading, poor-quality or doubtful earnings, and
that's not even counting fraud. If a company delays paying some big bills
or speeds up its depreciation schedule, it can show more earnings than it
would otherwise. If it sells off a division for mega-millions, those
dollars add to the bottom line and swell the earnings.

But you can only sell something once. And advancing a collection or
delaying a cost, is only borrows from one year to prettify the results of
another.

A P/E ratio is a good guide, but only as a rough-cut tool. You have to be
awfully careful to be sure that E is trustworthy. Can the company
duplicate those earnings, or better yet, increase them? Are they real
earnings from operations, or did it merely float a secondary offering and
sell a bushel of stock. If that's the case, not only will those earnings
not repeat, you'll have to share the pie with thousands more people at the
end of the next year.

Most advisors will tell you something along the lines of "a stock with a
P/E below 18 is a value stock," or 15, or 20, or 12. It varies from person
to person. Those who put the limit at 12 or 15 are likely to be the ultra-
cheap stock fans. They're the ones who rumble trashcans hoping to find a
good tuna sandwich. I'd never tell you that. Because I never use those
guidelines except as a general screen, and with good reason.

If you shop around for stocks with a P/E of 12 or less, you will come up
with mostly real estate investment trusts, regulated utilities, and
grocery stores. If you want to collect a big dividend, a utility or a REIT
may be good, for part of your portfolio. But these are all abominably slow
growth companies. They have low P/E ratios because they have low earnings
capacity. Let me be clearer: they're cheap because they should be cheap.

Occasionally, you will find a vigorous, growing company at these low
levels. That usually happens when there's been some bad news that scared
all the chickens away. But don't expect to find one a week. I know. I
look!

On the other hand, I have sometimes bought a stock that had a P/E ratio as
high as 40 or 50. Again, it has to do with the quality of the E and the
future expectations.

If a company for some reason has much lower earnings than it did
previously, its P/E ratio will rise. But if you can, with a high
probability, expect it to get back to its usual business, the high P/E is
not a red flag... unless you are prone to putting red flags on safe
investments. Sometimes, a stock going for a P/E of 50 is cheaper than one
going for a P/E of 20... looking forward, that is. But if you don't look
forward, you have no business buying stock in the first place.

Another time that a fairly high P/E stock may be a value is when profits
are delayed for some reason or special charges, particularly costs for an
acquisition, expansion or research and development, reduce the bottom line
for a limited time. Because investors have a Pavlovian-dog reaction to
acquisitions-thinking that they always cause unexpected trouble before
they benefit the company-you can often get a good deal on a stock right
after it acquires another company. In fact, many companies do acquisitions
quite smoothly, but the market keeps forgetting that.

A company with new products emerging may also have a high P/E ratio today
and still be a value. This is often the case with drug companies, for
instance. As long as the new product is really ready to roll out, stable,
salable and definitely capable of gaining market share (no wishful
thinking here), then tomorrow's earnings should be higher. Which means
that today's P/E ratio is not a good guide.

I always evaluate a "forward P/E" when I look at a stock. That is, I
estimate the next year's earnings, very conservatively, against the
current price. That's like looking at a stock in 3-D, it gives you a much
more lifelike picture.

The other test I run is to compare the current P/E ratio with the EPS
growth rate. That's called the PEG, and a powerful tool it is. If the PEG
ratio is 1, the stock is priced exactly in line with its earnings rate. If
it's under 1, it's a bargain and a value, so long as there are no bogeymen
in its closet.

Complicated, Yes, And Fully Within Your Grasp

A few weeks ago, I did some workshops with investors on finding value
stocks. We went through all this and then some. I taught them how to look
at cash flow, spot earnings bubbles, evaluate growth and profitability and
much more. After each workshop, people crowded around to say, "I didn't
know you did all that to find value."

Finding value in a stock is at least as much work as finding value in a
spouse, a car or a business. In fact, assuming you are a successful and
intelligent person in all other aspects of your life, it should be a lot
easier. After all, you don't have to marry your stocks. (You can reach

I don't invest in the US market indexes. I rarely buy index-related stocks. I
don't believe most people can beat the markets by playing the markets. I think
you have to look under Wall Street's radar to find unloved, unwanted values.

Rite Aid reports Q4 profits that top expectations(8:39 AM ET) NEW YORK - Rite
Aid (RAD) reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $59.1 million, or 9 cent
a share, vs. a loss of 2 cents a share in the same period a year ago, boosted
by a reduction in store closing and impairment charges. Revenue for the quarter
ending February rose 6.2 percent to $4.4 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson
First Call had been expecting earnings of 8 cents a share and revenue of $4.4
billion, on average. Same-store sales rose 6.4 percent, amid 6.7 percent growth
in pharmacy sales and a 6 percent increase in front-end sales. The drugstore
chain also reiterated fiscal 2005 revenue forecasts of $17.4 billion to $17.6
billion and same-store sales growth of 5.5 to 6.5 percent. The stock closed
Wednesday unchanged at $5.40.

NEW YORK, April 8 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch on Thursday raised its rating on
Rite Aid Corp. (RAD) to "neutral" from "sell."

The brokerage said the drugstore chain's latest quarterly results placated
concern that its recovery had run its course and that extended valuations on
its stock had ran ahead too fast.

"There's a bit more juice to Rite Aid's recovery than we had cautiously
projected," analyst Mark Husson said in a research note, citing an increase in
fourth-quarter profit that Rite Aid reported earlier.

I have been somewhat hypocritical of insurance company but i skimmed through
some stocks. My best finds are PRE and ACE. PRE has similar value metrics (P/E,
P/B) than MXRE but is bigger, has better credit rating and a 10 year track
record. ACE seems to be a small AIG in the making. I am watching both, Right
now,I am somewhat leery of insurance because i suspect that some of the
companies will cough up some blood due to the bond massacre. However, I do

hoyasaxa. I've sold DIS because I don't see where the Comcast bid is going.
It's still under the price DIS is trading for. Even if they make the bid better
for stockholders - increasing the bid price or maybe more likely, increasing
the cash component, I don't see a large rise in DIS stock from that.

DIS is selling around 24x expected '04 earnings. I see where analysts say theme
parks are doing better and cash flow is good. Depending on how far back one
goes, DIS's no bargain based on p/bk or p/sales (post 9/01), although current
numbers are much better (favorable) if one looks at '94-'00. S&P has a 12 mo.
target on DIS of $28. (Stock's at $24+ now.)

What is to be expected with a purchase of DIS now? (I ask this in the context
of other entertainment stocks that are out there. To me, looking at and owning
several of these, Disney at current price is not as attractive on a value
basis.)

The picture I see is that DIS is fairly valued at current price. Jmo, I could
be wrong.

ABIX, which I mentioned (probably someone else mentioned it before me, forgot
who) but did not buy last year, got a 1 day 3-bagger jump and the next day
trading halt after "exclusive distribution" news.

Hope someone on the thread profitted.
