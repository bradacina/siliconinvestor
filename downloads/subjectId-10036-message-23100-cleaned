I usually go to www.advfn.com for my Financials. It seems that they are behind
with AOB’s reported results. Their latest numbers refer to AOB’s 2nd. Quarter,
where T/O was $11.9mil., EBITDA was $5mil. etc... I’m going to ask them why
they are late in this instance.

They have a description which says "date preliminary data loaded" for each set
of results. This may not be the exact date the company publishes its results,
but I’ve usually taken it as being close to the pertinent date.
For the Quarter ended 09/2004 the data was "loaded" on the 29th. November 2004.
The previous Year End and 4th. Quarter , at 12/2004, was "loaded" on 25th.
April 2005.

It could be, then, that AOB’s recent rise may have something to do with an IBD
article. If that’s the case, what a pity that apparently so many folk in "the
Market" first need to be informed about the inherent quality of a company’s
fundamentals before they react accordingly !
Anyway, as far as I’m concerned, their Q3 results only confirm to me that AOB
is certainly worth considering.

I was looking at TYC- but with a PE of 19.1, and uncertain earnings, I'm not
sure it's a value. JNJ (for example) has a PE of 19.6, and doesn't have many of
the problems TYC has (and JNJ has a better dividend as well) and quarterly
growth is better, profit margins are better, return on assets and return on
equity are all beter for JNJ. Other than the price drop, what value do you see
here? Seems to me TYCO could breach it's 52 week low, if anything else

WMT: Today's news from Maryland mandating healthcare was unsettling so I did a
bit of research. Merrill takes the difference between what WMT says it now
spends and what the Maryland law will require and estimates that if this
mandate went nationwide it would impact WMT shares by 3-4 cents/Sh. I would
estimate that the likelihood of that would be about 20%, or similarly, that 20%
of the country would likely adapt a similar approach. Taking 20% of the
mid-range gives .007/Sh expected value of the impact. While there's near term
headline risk as this spreads [30 states have similar proposals], it doesn't
kill or even seriously damage WMT's fundamentals....it may lead to an
additional 'buying opportunities' for those not all in. I'll likely hold on and
look to add if it revisits the lows...the remerchendising and other initiatives
are more impactful than this.
OT: This approach to healthcare, mandating coverage levels, has a bit of a
socialist ring to it. If it spreads, it could have broader implications on many
fronts...none of them pleasing to shareholders of public companies.

WMT's a company that's built its success, imo, on doing many things well.
Keeping labor costs low is one factor, but maybe bigger factors are their
supply chain management techniques and purchasing clout with vendors. They may
have to cough up a little more than their smaller competitors (in Maryland) for
health benefits, but that shouldn't stop this behemoth from continuing to grow

Yes, IMO, today looked like a good day to ad. My other big core position, ICO,
has weathered the mine disaster so far. Primetime did a special on it an
included an interview with Wilbur Ross. They really tried to scapegoat him and
bait him. Somehow they failed to mention he had only closed the purchase of the
mine at the end of November! Prior to that it was in BK and running on a very
limited budget. Hoe the heck is he supposed to fix a mine in 30 days?

I added at 9 and change so I'm feeling better. I'm also believing Ross will do
what's necessary to improve some of the basket case mines he acquired. ICO
donated $2,000,000 to a fund for the miners' families and the ABC interviewer
called him cheap! I think what he did was exemplary. Usually the survivors have
to sue to get anything. Very rare for a company to offer something like that
immediately after a tragedy.

Paul - your WF pick is an interesting one.
Ran into this today: (disclaimer - the quote at the top about Nick Vardy's
newsletter is not mine. I included it so you know who is writing about WF)

http://www.moneyshowdigest.com/Digest/article.asp?aid=msd2006pick1-3317&iid=msd
006pick1&scode=001783&spn=sir

I treat new newsletters with some skepticism, but I have no doubts about the
future success of the Global Bull Market Alert. Editor Nick Vardy has created a
service destined to be a "must read" for sophisticated global investors and
traders. Here’ are his top picks for 2006.

"Having worked on the public offerings of formerly government-owned banks in
Central Europe in the mid 1990s, I am convinced that banking turnarounds are
one of the strongest ‘top down’ investment themes in global bull market
investing. My top pick for 2006 is Woori Finance Holdings Co. (WF NYSE), a play
on Korean banking. While the South Korean market has been up about 50% over the
past 12 months, many banking shares have doubled in value.

"Since recovering from the Asian financial crisis of the late '90s, South
Korea's banks have been on a tear. The country's financial sector—once in the
firm grip of the industrial conglomerates or chaebo— have been transformed into
fast growth, commercially-oriented, money-making machines. Loans to the shady
chaebo have plummeted to less than 5%, while loans to consumers have soared to
56% in 2005. The average ratio of non-performing loans stands at 1.6%, down
from 12.9% in 1999. As a result, South Korea's banking sector is expected to
earn $9.5 billion in 2005, topping 2004's record profits of $8.4 billion.

"Cobbled together from two troubled banks in 2001, Woori Finance today includes
the second-largest commercial bank in Korea in terms of total assets (including
loans), deposits, and the number of branches. It also boasts two Ivy League
economics PhDs (Harvard and Penn) on its Board of Directors. During the first
stage of its turnaround, Woori focused on making employees and clients accept
the very idea of credit assessment. But it is really the dynamic growth of the
South Korean economy that will secure future profits.

"Woori's goal is to become nothing less than a one-stop financial supermarket,
offering everything from credit cards and brokerage services to asset
management and insurance. And with revenue growth exceeding 90% in the last
quarter over the same quarter the previous year—and a p/e of less than 9—
Woori's stock is inexpensive compared with its other publicly traded
competitors. Buy Woori at market and place a stop at $51.00."

DTV article in Forbes. I very much agree with their conclusions and I also hold
DTV. I think the growth story (subscriber additions) will change to a FCF story
pretty soon. The growth story didn't get rewarded, hopefully the FCF story
will:

I also try to avoid content distribution (DTV being the exception) as I think
that broadband will get commoditized,I also think that the DSL versus cable
story is not in it's last innings yet and that cable will see a margin squeeze
due to DSL. The phone companies will have a hard time penetrating the TV market
in my opinion due to lack of economies of scale to buy content - the more
subscriber you have, the less you have to pay per subscriber for then content.

The content provider themselves should do OK but they must learn to profit from
the new distribution channels (via internet, Pay-per-View). I am quite heavily
invested in VIA ,L and CBS. I don't think the internet will hurt the content
providers although there are risks.

which runs at about 20B$, if memory serves right. This healthcare liability are
not accounted for on the balance sheet. When I add this all up, i just see too
much debt for my taste, that's why I passed.

FIOS is a gutsy bet, but they need more than broadband to make it pay for
itself. I see problems with bringing TV to consumers, as it's cheaper to buy
content in bulk, which VZ is not able to do for quite some time. i could see a
nasty tug of war with cable, internet calling, satellite, phone companies, with
uncertain outcome, so i am not tempted to buy any of the distribution

The Return on Capital I was referring to is one which we prefer to target,
namely Pretax Profit as a percentage of Capital Employed (P/CE). We prefer
‘Pretax’ because it doesn’t include any once-off tax credits, or similar. We
see this ratio as indicating what profit a company has earned with its
available capital.
VZ belongs to the sub-sector, Telecom Services-Domestic. I did a screen of all
the stocks in this sector and eliminated all negative P/CE ratios, and ignored
one stock, GTCC because its ratio was 426%. The average P/CE ratio of the
balance of 21 companies was 10.1%, with VZ below this average in 10th. place at
8.6%.

The following companies were between 20% and 31%, viz. TALK, NPSI, CTCO and
WWVY. Then came BLS, SPM, SHEN and CTCI.

optic cable in here .wow heavy duty labor job. layed line about three feet
under ground maybe deeper. installed control boxes between every two houses.
then they run a buried line up to house when an order is placed. install new
box, battery back up on system at house, connect over house lines, run new
heavy duty line to pc. and set house up for wireless , no charge.
Next is tv , which will be turn key system next year. I plan to switch
immediately to vz tv as cable we share the line and the picture stinks imo. I
am sure for about same price being on your own dedicated line reception all in
HD will be outstanding. I also expect the down time will disappear on vz vs
comcast coming out all the time to fine tune the system. Will they ever get a
return on the cost ,, i expect it takes years for every installation. vz has my

Madharry, i do not give the currency valuation to much of a consideration.
being from Europe, I tend to look at the Euro/US$ exchange rate, which right
now i would consider fair.

I do not that seem resource heavy currencies like Can$, SA Rand and Brazil have
appreciated to levels that are not sustainable long term for the respective
industries in these countries (other than resources).
As far as resource companies are concerned, i do not see why they would profit
from higher exchanges rates in their home currencies. After all, resources are
quoted in US$, which means that a company located in Can for example will have
a good deal of their cost in Can $ as well, which should be a disadvantage
compared to US based peers if anything. This does not mean that in the short
term, a bull market in those stocks and a currency appreciation will not
compound nicely.

Business Wire makes its money -- about $127 million in revenue last year -- by
disseminating news releases, a service in particular demand by publicly traded
companies that are required to meet fair disclosure rules....".

==============================================================
I guess this could be considered a media content company. If you assume a 30%
profit margin on $127 million revenues, then a $600 million purchase price
would yield a 15 PE. Typical of these media companies, they generate large free
flow cash flows. I suspect that this was the factor that Buffet liked.
There is some talk that Business Wire plans to expand their distribution
network to include the "blogging" community content. This is a huge new growth
area for them.

Warren Buffett likes RSS, too
(http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gardner/index.php?p=2248 )

From a value perspective, this is a very inexpensive way for Buffet to
participate in the future growth of the Internet. This is especially true when
one looks at the current valuations for Yahoo or Google.

i don't think that P/E of 13 is accurate as they had a gain in the most recent
quarter from the sale of some unused land

backing out 1.7M in profits from that transaction, you get a trailing 12M
profit of 3.26M, so on 6.52M shares fully diluted, you have a P/E of about 20
at 10 bucks a share

they are currently in the weaker part of the year for them, but they do seem to
be growing pretty decently at this point, and the chart is beautiful, as is the
balance sheet

the key in the near term appears to be whether they can strengthen Q3 and Q4
with improved food service sales...that might be a challenge considering that
hot dogs are typically summer fare, especially when you consider the number of
baseball games each week in the warmer months, vs. the number of sporting
events each week in the cooler months

the overall trend appears quite encouraging

Followed you into ALCO - the FLA farming/real estate company. I found some
interestinbg tidbits regarding the value of ALCO land in thei annual report. It
seems that some smaller sales were done at a valuation of about 20k/ acre. They
also secured a huge credit line of 170M$ with 7680 acres in collateral only
(P51, 22k/acre). Now ALCO owns about 136k acres which means that at a EV of
300M$, an acre is valued at about 2k. now i do realize that some of ALCO's land

I am in the hundreds of stocks now. That number seems to grow and grow. Which
is okay; that's what computers are for: to keep track of all the positions.

If anyone should insist that performance must revert to mean of the market (ie.
you get lousy performance) as the number of different shares and/or sectors
increase, it's possibly so, but I certainly don't see that at this time. (It's
also not a matter of outperforming 'the market': It's really about trying to
achieve financial goals while minimizing risks, but 'everybody' talks about
"beating the market", so I make my comment to that: namely that it's possible
that owning the "best" 200 or 300 or more stocks in a market of 15,000 or more
stocks, can actually beat the market (sometimes).)

To me, it's not so much the number as it is the diversity. If for example,
somebody had $100K to invest and they liked the oil sector for that $100K, it
would be my opinion (and my action) that because it's too difficult for a
"normal" person to evaluate the potential of a particular stock in the sector,
it's best to spread the bet. So for me, I would have no problem "hedging" by
buying small in a large number of oil stocks - 20 or more maybe - over time -
in the sector, with the total amount being the $100k.
($100K and "20" are hypothetical.) Similarly, for diversity, if there's an
undervalued sector or two or three, then another $100k ought to be spread into
each of these, with that money dispersed into a goodly number of stocks in each
sector.

The result is the building of a mutual fund equivalent, except you choose when
and what to buy, and when and what to sell, and you are your own manager - so
you save on the management fees!

------

It seems to me people (I include myself) are too quick to sell. Sometimes
stocks can go well beyond what value investors believe- as growth and momentum
players climb aboard. So for me, I try not to see selling as an all or nothing
thing. So even if someone felt compelled to exit a position, keeping the last
25 or 50 or 100 or 200 or whatever shares depending on your investing level -
i.e. keeping a stub - that can turn out to be very profitable. Examples for me
are AAPL, RAI, LHO, AVT, etc. etc. My point is that sometimes stubs sit in the
portfolio, cause no trouble, take no significant time to manage, and sometime
are surprising growers. They do add to the total number of stocks one owns, but
I'd rather have them in the portfolios a little bit, than not have them in at
all.

And so the portfolios build.

You say ALJ only has $33mil. of debt left and "...now that debt is almost gone
..." ?
Are you referring to "Long Term Debt" (LTD) as detailed on its Balance Sheet ?
The way I see it, its latest Quarterly Balance Sheet shows LTD at $128.4mil. It
was only slightly higher, 5 Quarters ago, at $142.9mil. That gives a current
LTD/Shareholders Interest of (128.4/249.7)x100 = 51.4%, which, in my opinion,
is very high.

Maybe ALJ's comments refer, only, to "interest bearing" debt, which is not
clear from the financial statements I looked at.
However, whatever the nature of that debt, according to its last Annual Result,
it’s also costing ALJ a post-tax number equivalent to 56% of its Bottom Line
(based on a 40% tax rate).
I see, from its chart, that its price has come down about 23% in the last 4
months.
I got these figures at Yahoo, which agreed with the numbers at another site I
usually refer to.

I wonder if it was only "impatience" that caused ALJ holders to sell ?

Alon USA Prepays Term Loan
Thursday January 19, 4:03 pm ET

DALLAS, Jan. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Alon USA Energy, Inc. (NYSE: ALJ -
News; "Alon") today announced that it has prepaid its $100 million term loan,
due January 14, 2009, reducing the Company's total debt outstanding to
approximately $33 million. According to the terms of the loan, Alon did not
have the right to prepay the loan before January 2006.

ADVERTISEMENT
[0]

"Due to the strength of Alon's balance sheet we have decided to use
approximately one third of the Company's cash to reduce debt. After this debt
repayment we will have approximately $200 million of cash and cash
equivalents," stated Jeff Morris, Alon's President and CEO. "As we outlined in
the Company's initial public offering prospectus we intended to repay all
outstanding amounts under the term loan in the first quarter of 2006 and we are
proud that we were able to accomplish this goal."

The loan had a current interest rate of 10.6%, thus the Company anticipates the
repayment will have an annual incremental interest savings of approximately $6
million starting in 2007. The Company anticipates the repayment of the loan
will only have a small incremental impact on interest expense for 2006 since
the Company will fully expense its deferred debt issuance costs of $3.9 million
and will pay a loan prepayment premium of $3 million in the first quarter of
2006.

Alon USA Energy, Inc., headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is an independent
refiner and marketer of petroleum products, operating primarily in the
Southwestern and South Central regions of the United States. The Company owns
and operates a sophisticated sour crude oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas,
which has a crude oil throughput capacity of 70,000 barrels per day. Alon USA
markets gasoline and diesel products under the FINA brand name and is a leading
producer of asphalt in the State of Texas. The Company also operates
convenience stores in West Texas and New Mexico under the 7-Eleven and FINA
brand names and supplies motor fuels to these stores from its Big Spring
refinery.

Here's another take from the Fool today.

Motley Fool
Alon USA Cleans Out Debt
Friday January 20, 12:33 pm ET
By Robert Aronen

Back in November, I highlighted Alon USA Energy (NYSE: ALJ - News), one of the
smallest refining companies in the country. As I said in the original piece, I
think this is a company to watch due to experienced management, excellent
growth prospects, and a strong balance sheet.

Thursday, the balance sheet became even stronger when the company announced
that it had prepaid a $100 million term loan that carried a hefty interest rate
of 10.6%. This move will result in $6 million in interest savings starting in
2007. There will be little cost savings this year because (1) the company will
fully expense the $3.9 million in fees associated with securing the loan
(normally such fees would have been amortized over the remaining three years of
the loan); and (2) the loan agreement included a prepayment penalty of $3
million for paying the loan off early. Nevertheless, after prepaying the loan,
the company coffers will have nearly $200 million of cash and equivalents vs.
only about $33 million in total debt outstanding.

During Alon USA's presentation at the Lehman Brothers Energy and Power
Conference in September, management indicated that it intends to pay a
dividend. To date, a dividend hasn't been declared. However, with the
high-interest debt prepaid and cash piling up on the balance sheet, I wouldn't
be surprised to see Alon USA declare a dividend when it reports its
fourth-quarter results. The company hasn't yet announced what day it will be
reporting, but it should be around the second week of February.

Even without a dividend, it is fairly clear to me that Alon USA is undervalued
and flies below the radar of Wall Street's analysts. The company's market cap
of $1 billion includes nearly $200 million in cash and equivalents, a 70,000
bpd (barrels per day) refinery capacity, more than 160 convenience stores,
pipelines, three product terminals, and two asphalt terminals. Last year,
Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO - News) purchased Premcor and its 790,000 bpd of
capacity for $8 billion -- just over $10,000 per bpd. This suggests that Alon
USA's refinery alone is worth around $700 million (70,000 bpd times $10,000 per
bpd). In other words, Alon USA's refinery and cash balance account for about
90% of its current market cap of $1 billion.

With demand for gasoline increasing, muscle cars being the highlight of the
Detroit Auto Show, and no new refineries on the horizon, refining companies
should maintain their record profits for the foreseeable future. Investors
looking for a growing company selling for a reasonable price could do worse
than running the numbers on Alon USA.

Fool contributor Robert Aronen owns shares of none of the companies mentioned.

Well, as I said in my post, all I could see on its latest Balance Sheet for
Quarter ending Sep. 2005, was a Long Term Debt of $128.4mil., giving it a
Debt/Equity of 51%.
I also said that I didn't know whether or not that was all interest bearing. I
suspect maybe it isn't, because the Interest Expense per Quarter seems to be
relatively low, compared to the $23.7mil. the debt cost for $171.6mil. over a
12 month period.

There is $193mil. in Cash and Equivalents on their Balance Sheet. I wonder why
they then sit with $128mil. of debt which is costing them money, when they
don't appear to be earning anything with that cash, based on the fact that
"Interest Income" on any of their Income Statements shows zero ?

Anyway, it's certainly a good thing if ALJ's management are going to repay debt
because it certainly has cost them enough in the past !

I think the oil sands are still undervalued.
example -- there is a fresh odlum brown analyst report which project COS
dividends to increase from CAN$4 this year, to CAN $11 in 2007. that's becasuse
COS will have completed their capital spending and they open the tap to produce
oil.

However the projection is based on US$55 oil. at US$64 oil, the dividend could
be CAN$4 higher, they say. that's CAN$15 on a stocks at CAN$150.

all the oil sands have that upside. the analysts are all playing it safe on the
projections. maybe it is offset somwehat by some construction delays not
visible. anyway -- these companies will sell all the product they can produce,
the only question is the price.

my portfolio is still 70% oil sands, as i posted here last summer.

You have hit upon the riskiest part of alj to be sure. it is a stand alone
refinery. However, I believe the near zero(and soon to be zero!) debt more than
compensates for that risk. VLO has about 15% of it's market cap in debt. That
was a bigger concern when revenues were way down a couple years ago, IMO. They
made a very astute move in expanding through debt/acquisition and have been
rewarded immensely...along w/shareholders. I am hopeful alj will follow along

It seems, This_is_the_end, that I took your original post 23165 to mean that
ALJ's loan repayment was already reflected in its latest Balance Sheet, which
is why the numbers didn't seem to gel.
Unless I'm mistaken, the terms of that loan seem rather onerous insofar that
the company gets penalised if they want to pay it back early !
If that's the case, it possibly explains why they sat with Cash on their
Balance Sheet which they could have used to reduce their ongoing Interest
Expense as reflected in their Income Statement.

Apart from their recent debt situation, the rest of their fundamentals, in my
opinion, seem in good shape.
However, what do you think about the fact that their last Quarterly Revenue
went up by about 10%, yet their Operating Margin fell by about 20%, with a
knock-on 11% reduction in their Bottom Line ?

I don't have a definitive answer buy here's what may have happened. See
underlined comments in their press release below, Looks as though they had some
downtime and built up excess inventories. Make sense to you? Their spreads were
actually much higher but with the unplanned downtime they kept buying sour
crude and storing it up for the 4th quarter. I'm not the greatest financial

Alon USA Reports Strong Third Quarter Results
Tuesday November 8, 4:25 pm ET
- Company Schedules Conference Call for November 9, 2005 at 10:00 A.M. EST -

DALLAS, Nov. 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Alon USA Energy, Inc. (NYSE: ALJ -
News; "Alon") today announced net income for the three months ended September
30, 2005 increased to $24.4 million compared to net income of $6.1 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2004, an increase of $18.3 million. Third
quarter earnings per share were $0.57 compared to $0.17 for the comparable
quarter last year.

ADVERTISEMENT
[0]

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2005 included $5.0 million
of after-tax gain recognized on disposition of assets ("after-tax gain")
relating to the contribution of certain pipeline and terminal assets to Holly
Energy Partners, L.P. ("HEP") in the first quarter of this year. The amount of
after-tax gain recognized was $4.2 million greater than planned due to the
acceleration of a portion of the deferred gain relating to the HEP transaction.
Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2005 excluding the effects
of the accelerated deferred gain would have been $20.2 million, or $0.47
earnings per share, in line with Alon's previously announced third quarter
earnings per share estimates.

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $74.3 million, or
$1.98 earnings per share, compared to net income of $22.9 million, or $0.65
earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, an increase of
$51.4 million. Excluding the accelerated $4.2 million of after- tax gain
recognized in the third quarter, net income for the nine months ended September
30, 2005 would have been $70.1 million, or $1.86 earnings per share.

The increases in net income for the three and nine months periods ended
September 30, 2005 over the comparable periods in 2004 were primarily
attributable to continued strong industry refining margins and favorable
differentials between WTI and WTS crude oil ("WTI/WTS"). For the third quarter
2005, Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spreads increased to an average of $17.13 per
barrel compared to an average of $6.71 for the third quarter 2004, primarily
due to production interruptions in the Gulf Coast region in connection with
hurricanes Katrina and Rita. WTI/WTS crude oil differentials for the third
quarter 2005 increased to an average of $4.09 per barrel compared to an average
of $3.87 barrel for the third quarter 2004.

The positive impact of favorable refining margins and WTI/WTS crude oil
differentials in the third quarter 2005 was partially offset by the Company's
acceleration of a reformer catalyst regeneration that was previously scheduled
for January 2006. As a result of downtime associated with the regeneration,
refinery throughput for the third quarter 2005 decreased by approximately 5,400
barrels per day as compared to the second quarter 2005. Despite this reduction
in throughput, overall refinery production of 66,747 barrels per day in the
third quarter 2005 was 13.5%, or 7,944 barrels per day, higher than third
quarter 2004 production due to the expansion of the Big Spring refinery's crude
oil throughput capacity in the first quarter 2005.

Jeff Morris, Alon's President and CEO, commented "In the third quarter, we were
unexpectedly required to accelerate a reformer catalyst regeneration as
previously disclosed on September 22, 2005. Now that this regeneration has been
completed and the appropriate upgrades are being designed, we expect to avoid
the regeneration previously scheduled in January of 2006 and to combine our
next regeneration with our scheduled low sulfur fuel upgrade planned for April
2006. Operations are back to normal and we have returned to the consistent
performance to which we have become accustomed.

"Turning to the fourth quarter, we ran well in October, <u>decreased our
inventories</u> and improved our cash position. We expect our cash balance to
be further enhanced in the fourth quarter <u>as we convert approximately
300,000 barrels of unfinished product to finished gasoline and diesel</u>.
Sweet/sour spreads in October increased over third quarter levels and refining
margins remained strong even as Gulf Coast refineries came back on line. Thus,
we believe we are on schedule to reduce inventories and increase our cash
balances back to planned levels by year end.

"During the remainder of 2005, we expect to complete an incremental expansion
of our jet fuel hydrotreater from 4,000 barrels per day to 5,000 barrels per
day. We expect to implement this expansion without impacting throughput at the
Big Spring refinery. We also plan to begin investments in our asphalt
facilities in Big Spring and in Bakersfield, California to grow our premium
asphalt business. 2005 will be a record year for asphalt sales for us, as we
sold out our entire Big Spring production of 150,000 tons and our Bakersfield
facility will triple last year's sales volumes. These results further evidence
the quality of our asphalt business."

You could very well be right.
I'm not an ardent follower of Resource based, or Resource related, stocks
myself. In my opinion, they can be very well managed companies etc.. etc.., but
they are still very dependent on the price of their Resource, over which they
have virtually no control.

If, for example, the price of oil falls through the floor, or there's an oil
glut, they will definitely suffer. The same goes for gold, copper etc..
On the other hand, ALJ is a refiner, so it may be slightly less problematic for
them.

But as you say, let's wait and see what their results have to say. That's when
I, personally, make my own buying or selling decisions.

Finally, I have increased my return by selling some SFL staggered short term
covered calls (six months out) and writing some SFL naked Puts (so stock is put
BEFORE the x-dividend date) that lock in a 20% ROI. This is a limited risk
strategy that works as long as the company continues to fulfill their long term
lease contracts.

Would appreciate a little elaboration on your tactic with options. I tried some
time ago to trade options on dividend paying stops but had them called away
because they were in the money before the exdiv date.

Are you writing these calls out of the money and are you buying them back at
some point in time before exdiv. And do you use charting to time your call
sales.

With the put writing it sounds like you are planning to buy the stock from the
put buyer before the exdiv. So does the option expire before the exdiv?

Hope this isn't too much. I just found your post today while searching some
tanker stock symbols.

Thanks in advance for any comments you care to share.

Hi RWS - It can be a somewhat complicated strategy but it essentially is
selling Put & Call time premium and collecting the stock dividend so as to
increase your total return. You want to be sure that you sell the naked Put so
if it is exercised (ie stock assigned to you) you also receive the dividend.
Therefore, you must know the xdividend date and make sure it occurs after the
option expiration date.

Finally, you can stagger both the option expiration periods and the strike
prices to obtain a "natural" or "leveraged" hedge on your core position. If I
conclude that my core company is undervalued and is one of my long term value
plays, I may sell more naked Puts at different strike prices that can be
exercised in the future. This is equivalent to doing several "buys" over time
and allows you to average into a new position.

The best outcome is to have both the calls and the puts that you sell expire
worthless and you therefore pocket the option premium. You only want to sell
covered calls that if exercised you still receive the dividend. Also, this
strategy works best when the company is restructuring and trades in a narrow
price range. You want to find a company that will be in a flat trading range
for 12-18 months. This is typical of a company that is bottoming out (or
establishing a base), has had big insider sales, large one time write downs and
is reorganizing or bringing in new management. Otherwise you have to set up
staggerd covered calls at different price levels so you can lock in your gains
and hopefully not have you stock called away. This is tricky. difficult to do
and hard to time.

I only use this type of strategy as a hedge to my core positions and always
keep 1/3-1/2 of my shares open so I can participate in any stock move higher.

Hope this helps.

KND was slammed due to changes in Medicare funding. I've been burned before by
changes in Medicare funding before, so I guess I didn't learn my lesson that
even though the numbers look good, the government changes in payment will rule
the day. I still hold my shares but will look for a point to sell in the future
as I think the overhang will take a long time to overcome.

Grommit, thanks for the oil analysis/update. I have have shares in most of the

At this point, I've just run out of courage to add more VLO shares, even though

For right now though, fwiw, I'm adding a few more COP and OXY.

Grommit: Is that HW or HD?

Or both? I like HD as a buy around current price. I've got enough for now
though. HW doesn't look expensive: I'll check it out.

I've never followed PSUN. I like LIZ at current price. Adding a bit today to a
most small exploratory position.

I have MAS which is a big supplier to HD. The stock doesn't seem to be able to
get any traction, and the company to me seems to be struggling. Relatively
(i.e. by p/sales, etc.) the stock is cheap. I don't like to see the stock down
at these levels because I'm worried it portends tough times for HD.

Albertsons inks dell to sell
(http://bizneworleans.com/109+M5ff7c6330e5.html )
From the article:"...Albertson's Inc. announced today that it has entered into
a definitive agreement to sell the entire company to a consortium of investors
for a total transaction value of approximately $17.4 billion in cash, stock and
assumed debt, including the settlement of the Albertsons Hybrid Income Term
Security units...."

"...Under the terms of the agreement, Albertsons shareholders will receive
$20.35 in cash and a fixed exchange ratio of 0.182 shares of SUPERVALU stock
for each Albertsons share, on a fully diluted basis...."

=========================================================

What is good is that the deal provideds for the accelerated payment of the
Hybrid Security Units (w/ dividends) at the $25 face value. These units were to
have expired in May 2007 and would have been converted into common stock.

The Hybrid Units go xdividend 1-30-06, so I plan to sell my complete position
sometime after this date.

I will hold onto my common shares and will take the cash settlement and
maintain a small position in Supper Value stock (SUV).

The investment provided an OK return as my common shares returned 27% over
three years and my Hybrid Units returned 13% over one year.

There is still quite a bit of hidden value in their real estate and now Kimco
Realty Corp. (KIM http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=kim&d=t ) will work on bringing
this value to it's shareholders.

Sold IVX @30.75 [Cost 18.54] in front of acquistion by TEVA. Conisdered rolling
into TEVA, which is very well run, but looks a bit ahead of itself. Will
consider buying TEVA if it comes in a bit. Besides selling and considering the
TEVA buy from a new position basis provides clearer perspective than viewing it
as an owner.

Started AMGN Today @74.70. This was a READY-FIRE-AIM move. Cramer touted it as
a 'buy when it's down' play. I checked Morningstar's Fair value: $91, S&P's @
81. I may change my mind upon closer inspection, but on first blush it looks
like a better place for my IVX proceeds than rolling them into TEVA.

I have a simple question for the group.

What was the rate of return for
1) the Dow Jones Industrial Avg. and
2) the S & P 500
for the calendar year of 2004? (Without dividends).

And, where do I get this information if I misplace my beginning of the new year
copy of the WSJ or Barrons?

I thought there was a relatively easy and straightforward answer until I tried
to get this information off the internet and was bombarded with a bunch of
financial advisors/publications/hacks/mystics/etc trying to sell me their
products. UGH.
