WY because of the housing contruction slump, and DMND because of the change in

LDR seems to be a stock that has run and sells at a price way above what the
future warrants for it, despite growth in earnings.

In general my watch list of grossly under priced stocks is expanding, with
stocks worth shorting contracting.

Some of the stocks below may be worth some DD. I own a few of these and am
researching to see if any are worth adding on the long side. My experience has
been that a basket of equal dollar amounts in them would yield significant
results a year hence. Particularly those selling at a large discount to
tangible net asset value that have positive earnings forecasts for 2008 and
2009. I haven't seen so many of these since 2002 lows. Alot depends on the
economy in general, the outlook for the particular industry group, management
steps to navigate an ugly economy, and just how far this bear market rally can
last. Believing the analyst estimates for 2009 could be a losers game, but with
heavily discounted stocks already it does remove alot of the downside risk in
hanging on.

Thanks for the list, anializer. With these doggies, I'm in agreement with
Madharry - I don't want to be in a rush to buy leveraged mediocre (or worse)
companies. I've put your screen through my screen -- I'm going to ignore most
anything that's not near its 12-mo low, that has high/debt equity, and that
does not have appropriate (by my formula) returns given its stock price. Some
of the stocks on the list I'm already suffering with (TNE, NM, OLP, more).

I've found a new one that meets my criteria, and I've placed a small order at a
little lower than current price. If it fills, I'll post it.

One I might consider further is MOSY. Barron's this week reports the CEO bought
200K at $1.80-1.85. Yahoo shows a couple of other recent insider buys too.
According to my read of Yahoo numbers, cash+cash equivalents + short term
investments = $1.77/sh, with no debt. The stock closed at $2.10 on Friday.
Company hasn't been profitable in past few years, and doesn't expect to show
profits for '08 (maybe '09 too). Still...if I could get a few shares at cash
value, I might consider a very small gamble.

Perhaps a contrary opinion - or heretical opinion -g- - might be to short
Berkshire. The stock's come back up from its lows. Financial numbers (roe)
don't all look so great. To justify the current p/e and 1.3 book value on a
conglomerate affected by consumer spending, I'd say a buy or hold now is a bet
that Mr. Buffett can come through with some tremendous market-approving stock
buys with the cash he's got available. On the pressure for a decline in the
stock, any large further market decline will cause redemptions by value
(growth?) funds who might want to sell or have to sell their BRK shares. Of
course true Buffett-heads are buy-'n-holders so they won't sell. (Maybe Mr.
Buffett himself is buying shares these past couple of months.)

If the market falls further, with the stock not having a dividend, with people
being concerned with Buffett aging, with the company already showing its worst
performance in decades, the stock could be a loser in '09.

ASFI has been beaten down also, earns are positive, though estimates are

The play here is a thought that they will be able to buy some receivables from
companies and banks that are being written off for maybe 5 or 10 cents on a

I agree, no need to jump as we don't know if the lows on indexes will be
retested or even violated. I'm thinking they will by March so just trying to
prepare some ideas for opportune entries.

MOSY is also interesting however the discount is not that enticing relative to
tangible net assets. Continued losses also present a question mark.

 Value investors shorting things after S&P500 dropped 38% in a year... OK, I

So what- 38% down - that does not mean that some stocks are still overvalued.
We are also up 25% from the bottom to look at the situation another way. I
don't think that it's time to go all out and short anything but some selective
shorts do make sense. For example a pair trade short XOM - long COP, TOT, RDS-A
(put you favorite oil company) is a value conscious approach imo. The truckers
are flat YOY despite crummy looking fundamentals. A lot of banks are going to
go belly up and will be nationalized because real estate keeps falling. I am
typically not a trendfollower - rather a contrarian but things are unhinged in
a way that I have never seen before. Forget the 1990,2001 or 1982 recession,

is down 20% YOY. I think there is enough cash flow coverage that the earnings
are safe - as they did not really increase their dividend when they raked in

CSX - the argument went that those RR companies benefit from high fuel prices
(because of their inherent energy efficiency). Now should we not deploy the
reverse logic and say that RR are less competitive when fuel is cheaper as is
the case now.

Infrastructure may benefit RR a bit but better roads if anything would also
benefit the truckers - the RR main competitions. The biggest near term problem
is that there is just less stuff to haul around - less steel, less cars less
almost everything is produced and less needs to be moved. the earnings forecast
seem to ignore all that and assume that the RR can increase tariffs by a
substantial amount to make up for all this. This just does not seem all that

HI Paul - Spectra Energy Corp. (SE) has operated independently from Duke Energy
Corp as of Jan 2007 so there is not a lot of financial operation detail for
their different business segments. From a quick review of their Nov 7, 2008 10
Q that covers the nine months ending September 30, 2008 it appears that the
company did not use any hedges for gas/ng price changes but rather can pass on
any increases directly to their customers with or without added mark ups. In
2008 it looks like they absorb a $63 million decrease from lower natural gas
prices which were not passed on to their customers w/o any markup.

The company had extra ordinary gains to offset this pass thru price offset loss
from significant gains from a stronger Canadian dollar.

What is interesting is that their operating revenues benefited significantly
from a stronger Canadian dollar (almost $0.24/share) probably due to their
large Canadian operations segment (Western Canada Transmission & Processing)
which is reported in US $.

I did not realize there was such a large benefit to their 2008 operating
revenues from the increase resulting from a stronger Canadian dollar ($146
million in Operating Revenues - almost a 10% delta).

It appears that (so far) management is able to control both the increases and
decreases to meet their revenue objectives.

=============================================================

The company does carry a lot of debt ($10.5B) but seems to have sufficient cash
flow and positive EBIT. I have a very small position which I bought at slightly
higher levels and would buy more shares in the $14 -$15 area.

The other one I like and have a much larger position is Enbridge Energy
Management LLC (EEQ). I only got 1/2 of my full position on at $22.90 before it
took off and is now trading in the $29-$30 area.

I really do not plan to trade any of these high dividend payers I acquire as I
am looking to build up my total portfolio income through dividend income
generation. I have a simple strategy to buy dividend generators that pay 5% or
higher and sell them when the dividend falls below 3% or when earnings (and or
cut in dividend) fall due to high debt load.

The company continues to cut costs and close their marginal producing stores.
They wrote down about $14.00/share in goodwill in their last earnings report
bringing their BV down to $16.00/share. This value is understated as much of
their older real estate is carried at cost which is much lower than current
market value.

The company still carries a larger than industry debt load which management
continues to work down over time with asset sales and and an aggressive payoff
schedule. Free Flow Cash should begin to increase over the next 36 months which
should further help to reduce debt if management determines this is the best
use of this cash.

I don't know how much worse things can get for ESIO, but with the stock at
under $7/sh. and cash (per SI) at $5.45 and no ltd,I've got to go with the
downside to the stock having some limit -- maybe a point or two lower (assuming
management doesn't spend the cash).

http://si.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&cb=1231519545&symbol=N ^ESIO

If the cycle turns, and if I can hold on, then I would expect to see the stock
once again trade at book value or higher. Book value (stated) is about $14/sh
and ESIO has traded above book value every year in past ten.

I figure the upside/downside risks strongly favor a bet. OTOH, it is a very
small supplier company in a competitive arena about which I'm no expert. So a
very few share bet for me now which I'm only willing to add a little more to if
stock keeps dropping on no adverse news.

I took a look at ESIO and it meets a some portions of my ideal criteria, while
earnings going forward seem to be the question mark. But I will add to my value
watch list as I have done with MTW and will monitor developments. My tendency
is not to chomp at the bit on anything here, and wait a bit. The bear market
rally is looking more and more like its over. At the real bottom, whenever that
comes I want to be prepared with lots of cash and ideas. I suspect value
pickings will be huge in number at some point and irresistible. Today I let go
of my TRN before my profit evaporates. The layoff's there don't appear to bode
well, despite the apparent value. EME, AAON went out at small loss and gain
less than a point. TSYS which is not a value stock I dumped because it had run
and wasn't bought for its value. So for now I'm just focusing on my project
which is to build a watch list of value stocks based on certain criteria.
Project works like this. Go thru each and every stock in all my watch lists one
by one. Go thru every component of the S and P 600 and the Russell 2000 as
well. Examine each balance sheet, examine the earnings for 2008, the estimates
for 2009, and search news for any recent developments that would be a negative
impact. If the stock meets my criteria, the first of which is that it's selling
at a worthy discount to net tangible asset value it gets consideration for
adding to the value list. Earnings of 2008, recent quarterly earnings, and 2009
estimates should be positive or only negative by a marginal amount with
potential for improvement. I then annotate each chart in the watch list with
notes on book value and earnings so that ongoing dynamics of the stock price
movement can be compared to the current stock price on any given day. So far I
have 300 stocks in this value watch list, but once its completed, it gets a
last go thru.

That sounds like a lot of work. Let us know what you finally wind up liking or
buying. You should wind up with some good candidates.

I often wonder if what I REALLY should have learned in high school is that it
sometimes pays to work together and that sometimes, maybe most times, copying
somebody's homework - the right somebody's - is even better.

===================
That list is going to be a little skewed of course since a main criterion will
be tangible book value. I'm finding what I believe to be some large cap former
growth stocks with good earnings power to be trading at attractive prices
(although their stock prices are above tangible book value). I added to MSFT
under $20 today, for example. It should be a survivor of the recession - it
still earns profits and has a substantial cash hoard. It would be a company
where it's difficult to see the stock ever trading below book value (about
$4/sh). It may not have the double potential of something like a package of
ESIO's, but in some sense, the risk with MSFT might be less too, thus perhaps
for some, allowing for a larger $ commitment.

Just conversing here. Not arguing for or against MSFT. Or for or against any
stock criteria. My buy-in price for MSFT is about $25 in July, so there's some
indication I might not wind up in positive territory despite my positive
outlook regarding the company.

Any screen or criteria development decisions are always lacking something. Some
good ones will be missed and some bankruptcies will be in. That's a reason for
buying a good size basket in terms of the number of stocks. My criteria was
decided on because it worked well at the 2002 and 2003 lows. I think the main
thing is in order for it to work, positions need to be entered when the market
itself is in sync with a beginning of a primary uptrend and for bear market
rallies, at the extremes of a down move near panic levels.

ADL, one mentioned on Dale's thread recently by someone who listed his watch
list of 42 stocks had a nice % move today. I think your right, it can't ever
hurt to pick off some ideas and benefit from someone elses work as well as our
own.

Here's a recap of weekly events from a friend at Creekside Advisors, just for
interest. Tuff to call a new bull market in the current economic environment. I
honestly think in bull markets you can almost throw darts, but in bear markets
value gets thrown out as well. Seems to me even in value investing, getting the
market right is a very important part. I do realize you have much more patience
than I do, but I can have patience too if I've limited the downside risk
exposure to small dollars.

As goes the first week of January?

Weekly Market Update 1-9-09

The year started out well enough, with the market moving higher during the
first few days, but then earnings warnings from Alcoa and Intel, along with
lousy retail sales, some worrisome comments from the Fed, and more bad news on
the employment front sent things to the downside, with the market finishing
sharply lower.

For the week, the Dow Industrial Average was down 514.81 points, or 5.70%, to
close at 8,519.88. The Nasdaq dropped 60.62 points, or 3.71%, finishing at
1571.59, while the S&P 500 fell 41.45 points, or 4.45%, to close at 890.35.

At their last meeting in December, the Fed cut interest rates to a range of
“zero to &#188;%”, a new historic low. This week they released the minutes from
that meeting, which reflected a somber tone, with comments including,
“Conditions in the labor market deteriorated considerably in recent months as
most major industry groups shed jobs”, and “In the business sector, investment
in equipment and software appeared to be contracting at a faster rate in the
fourth quarter than during the third quarter.”

Clearly, economic good news is in short supply, and the economy is slowing at
an accelerating pace. The Fed, through their statement in December and their
meeting minutes, has communicated that they are going “all in” to fight
deflation, stabilize the banking system, and attempt to stimulate the economy.
Nonetheless, monetary stimulus (lower interest rates) will not be enough, and
so quantitative easing will be used, with the Fed buying assets and injecting
capital into financial institutions.

However, that will also not be enough. With consumers and businesses not
spending, the government must spend to fill the void. That means a large
stimulus package, and this week, the Obama administration started the process,
with expectations ranging somewhere between $700 billion to $1 trillion.

In the housing sector, the MBA Mortgage Applications Survey decreased 8.2% in
the latest week. The “purchase” index was up 7.3%, while the “refinancing”
index fell 12.3%. Interest rates on the 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell to
5.07%, as a result of the Fed entering the market and buying mortgages to drive
down rates; part of their “quantitative easing” process. Meanwhile, the ARM
(adjustable rate mortgage) fell to 5.9%

On the labor front, weekly first time jobless claims decreased 24,000 to
467,000, from a revised level of 491,000 in the previous week. However, the
data may have been skewed by the holidays. There were anecdotal reports of the
telephone filing systems in several states crashing from the overload of calls.
The 4-week moving average of claims fell to 526,000. Continued claims, however,
continued higher to yet another new record at 4.61 million, as job openings
vanish.

The Monthly Employment report for December showed that the economy experienced
a net loss of 524,000 jobs for the month, and approximately 2.6 million jobs
were lost in 2008. October was revised downward from 320,000 lost to 423,000
lost, while November went from 533,000 to 584,000. The unemployment rate rose
to 7.2%, which likely understates the true level of unemployment due to the
data collection and analysis methods.

Crude oil prices shot up on geopolitical tensions in recent weeks, increasing
31% in just 5 days around year end before settling back. For the week, crude
fell to finish at $40.62/barrel. In spite of OPEC’s announced production cuts,
inventories are rising, with oil producers attempting to charter additional
supertankers for temporary storage. Wholesale gasoline rose to $1.11/gallon
despite continued declines in consumption. Wholesale heating oil increased to
$1.49/gallon, while natural gas fell to $5.54/mmBtu.

Final Note: 2008 made it “12 for 12”, with another month of net job losses, as
shown on the chart below. What has economists concerned is the acceleration in
the rate of losses, with more than 1.6 million jobs lost in just the 4th
quarter, and the nasty downward revisions to prior month’s data that seem to be
happening with increasing regularity.

Intuitively as it would seem, when workers lose jobs, or become fearful that
they might lose their job, they tend to hold back from buying big ticket items
such as houses and cars. The chart below shows the auto sales data for 2008,
and comparison to the jobs chart above makes it pretty clear that the lights
went out on the economy in early October, and activity ended the year with a
thud.

With the dire economic predicament at hand, Congress has started to consider
the need for a bold economic stimulus plan. Predictably, the deficit hawks are
now engaging in hand wringing about the damage that the stimulus spending will
do to the budget deficit.

Unfortunately, the time for those concerns has long passed. If they’re worried
about deficits, perhaps they should consider what will likely happen to tax
revenues in the absence of stimulus. Economic history has shown that government
revenues tend to collapse, as unemployed workers and profitless corporations
don’t pay taxes, resulting in an explosion in the deficit, not from the
spending side of the ledger, but rather from a lack of revenue. There are now
no good choices.

OT fund of funds -
Article from the WSJ

 Hedge-Fund Middlemen Get Pinched
By JENNY STRASBURG

The business of recruiting investors to hedge funds boomed over the past decade
and helped drive the hedge-fund frenzy. Now, investors burned by big losses in
hedge funds are dumping these middlemen.

The combination of market losses and investor panic resulting from money
manager Bernard Madoff's alleged Ponzi scheme is putting the heat on firms that
pool money from clients and invest in hedge funds. Last year, these so-called
fund-of-funds assets overall shrank for the first time since 1996, according to
industry tracker Hedge Fund Research, or HFR.

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123144443944765309.html

Could be very valuable information from a liquidity perspective. According to
the graph shown in this article there was still about 650B$ invested in fund of
funds. I guess this number will now shrink dramatically due to collateral
damage. I hear anecdotal evidence that this is happening on other threads where
investors are calling it quits after Madoff and money managers are shutting
down.

I know I am probably diverting attention away from the main topic off the
thread. I am finding myself more and more watching these macro or liquidity
trends since i believe they determine the direction of the market. If anybody
minds those OT post I am going somewhere else with this stuff, thought about
using Q8 now abandoned thread for this.

DPS, CPN - both stocks worth to keep an eye on for two reasons:

1) Both are reasonable cheap
2) Both are heavily owned by hedge funds. For the case of DPS, we have Pershing
and Greenlight owning 31M shares. For CPN Harbinger alone holds 71M shares and
also Luminus has been a big buyer recently

http://www.nasdaq.com/asp/holdings.asp?symbol=DPS&selected=DPS
http://www.nasdaq.com/asp/holdings.asp?symbol=cpn&selected=cpn

Hedge fund ownership in these times is of course a double edged sword. For CPN
the ownership is so large that i wonder about the exit strategy. About the only
conceivable way that those hedge funds can liquidate would be via a CPN
takeover. This is not an unreasonable scenario of credit markets recover. CPN
could be an anializer stock since it is below tangible book (which understates
the value of the generation fleet many analysts say) and is profitable.

I do not own any of the above right now (exited CPN on the recent runup) but i
am keeping them on my watchlist because whacky things could happen in either
direction.

Like we discussed most preferreds have jumped up from their bottom prices. In
fact they are probably the best performing equities in my portfolio. Now the
question is: is it still worth buying preferreds? And if so, what would be your
list to buy?

For me current situation is conflicting:

- On one hand, Fed rate and treasuries are at record lows and preferreds still
offer high yields and high yield spreads. Both of which are BUY signals
- On the other hand, both government and private capital has recently been
raised at 12-15% levels. Which means that 10-11% preferred yields are not
really bargains. We as investors are getting less return than what other
capital providers got.

And this is without consideration of macro picture where you could argue that
another shoe may drop.

well, 1/3 of my portfolio is pref shares and it gives me a pretty safe income
level. so as far as your question of if they are still worth buying, i would
not frame the ? in terms of expected future gains. a more direct question and
easier to answer question is: "do you want a portfolio of 13% to 16% yielding
stocks?"

I think that CLP is the safest -- 80% residential.
AHT is a gamble, I have a small wager. CLP, HRP, AHT, FR, BDN all lowered their
common dividends recently, so the pref divs are even safer because of it.

Some of these have other pref avail, but the yields are usually similar. All
but DRE have declared the pref divs for the coming qtr.

FR-K 16.3%
BDN-D 13.3%
CLP-D 13.1%
DRE-N 14.0%
AHT-D 29.8%
HRP-C 14.0%

AOB - I really don't have strong opinion. It's too low to sell like most
Chinese stocks. It's not a great buy either IMO. I don't have strong opinion
about the real estate purchase either. Read my rant below.

One advantage of Buffett style investing is that you only buy companies where
you trust the management. And once you buy, you don't second-guess them. If
they decide to invest money in X, they know better and you are there for a
ride. IMHO, second-guessing the management is one of the worst things most
investors do. Let's face it, we are not CEOs and we are not necessarily
qualified to judge their actions. I am not advocating blind trust in
management, far from it. However, I believe it is a large part of Buffett's
success that he does not need to spend a lot of his time continuously trying to
figure out if management is doing the right things.

All that being said, I invest in companies that are far from Buffett's
standards and I need to evaluate management decisions there. In case of AOB, I
will not do anything right now, but I may sell if the stock runs up.

Ignoring to second guess management speak has in the past led to considerable
losses for me. I'd rather guess wrong sometimes than not guess at all.
Investing is all about second guess based on limited information, IMO.

Regarding you other question about preferreds, i don't think I am a buyer at
10-11% yields. Most of these are not rock sold companies and even though
preferreds have some protection relative to common, it is far from bullet
proof. Just ask the bagholders for FNM/FRE preferreds how this can work out.
I'd rather buy some rock solid non-cyclical equity stock like PEP or NSRGY
where I'd expect similar returns with much less risk, IMO.

As I said, there are only few companies into which you can invest without
second-guessing. On the other hand, if you invested in BRK and second guessed
Buffett, I don't think you would have lasted a year. He does a lot of things
that need to be taken on faith or not at all. Most of companies that he invests
into are easier to hold without second-guessing. E.g. if you hold PEP or KO or
JNJ, you really can forget what's happening and not concern about management a
lot. Not many such companies though.

Your thoughts about preferreds are similar to mine. With a lot of stocks low,
the "somewhat-guaranteed" 10-15% yield is not necessarily better than expected
(but not guaranteed ;)) 2X to 3X return in stock prices.

FWIW the RR stocks are getting interesting again. CSX is the cheapest in terms

TBT, PEP, RYJUX
Even with the market in a funk I am not getting much fills. The stuff that I
want just does not seem to go down much. A few PEP today for both my IRA and my
taxable account did get filled.

I am looking into ways to bet against treasuries. Treasuries seems to be the
last bubble there is. TBT is a 2x levered ETF bet on increasing 10&20year
treasury yields, RYJUX is a 1x fund bet on 30year yields. I am not crazy about
the 2x levered funds but it is the only tool available in my IRA.

Both have rallied a bit off their lows but are now falling back. My rationale
is that treasuries yield should not stay low forever. Ultimately the fed's
money will inflate something (although it is almost certainly not the things
that they want to inflate) and then the treasury yields will rise. That should
be good for the owner of TBT or RYJUX. Comments welcome.

Spekulatius - I'm playing in this field, and got filled at 40.40 today on TBT.
Stop placed at 37.16. Target 47ish, but it's actually a moving target as it
corresponds with the 50dma. Of course this average is converging with the 9 and
20dma, so there is a much larger move coming if it can tighten up in here and
see the 9 cross through the 20 and 50dma. We'll need a close above 42.96 to
really refresh the newly found upward move in this issue. Until then we may
find ourselves caught in another panic to safety in Treasuries....get stopped
out, and have to reassess. I will note though that the TLT is still below it's
9 and 20dma even with the up move today. If we can catch another few days of
selling in Treasuries we could see the 9dma fall under the 20dma in TLT, and
that would act as resistance and fuel further selling. Which would be most
welcome for my TBT position, and further confirm that Treasuries have indeed
topped out. We shall see.

** Note that the close of 40.32 was below the 9dma, but not by too much.
Tomorrow will show if it was smart to initiate this one at these levels.
**I've chosen to pass on PST for now.

The following was taken from a post I did for both of my blogs on 1/7/09.
RGRDS - JT

"TLT was a favorite short at the start of 2008 as it would move to the high 90s
every time a meltdown occurred. Then we would rally mildly and it would fall to
the lower end of it's trading range. Well, as most of you know we had a
meltdown. Treasuries ripped to the upside as we had fund managers playing a
game of diversifying mattresses. The November 20 panic low corresponded with a
gap up in TLT stopping out many long time shorts such as Jim Rogers. Then we
get a big equity sell off at the beginning of December 2008 causing TLT to gap
up even higher. And then came the FOMC December 16th cut to the 0-.25% range.
TLT gapped higher. Was it an exhaustion gap or a continuation gap? For Pete's
sake was the Fed going to continue to jam treasuries even higher? That's what
most of us were thinking, but then the note that changed the game.....yet
again.

The Fed will start buying 500b of MBS paper over the next two quarters. No
doubt selling Treasuries to subsidize it's purchases. And voila`....the
reversal begins. TBT which is the 2x inverse of TLT, or an Ultra short on 20yr
Treasuries as it's name implies gets the nod. TBT starts to reverse back up
through it's 9dma and makes a move on filling the gap down from Dec 17th. Then
it makes a dash for the 20dma. All the while TLT reverses as the pair implies.
Then Barron's finally gets involved in the act. "Get Out Now" they proclaim in
an article that lays out this very thesis that so many traders have been
eyeing. Short TLT, and get long TBT and PST. And Monday Jan 5th we felt the
Barron's bounce.

It's still early on in this reversal, but it bares taking a stab at these
levels providing the 9 and 20dma provide support now for TBT and PST. If
shorting TLT these should be used as areas to add to an existing position or
create a new one. Keeping 120 or as high as 123 as a stop level. TBT could use
a stop of 38-39 for new positions. PST could use a stop at 52 with an upside
target of 59-62. Volume is still thin on PST as the 9dma has not crossed the
20dma in this issue either. I would rather use TBT because it has more volume
and it's pattern is the mirror image of TLT ie: with all those gaps to get
filled. My target for TBT is 49 with 54 being my top end target for now. (Could
go higher, but since it's new there is no 200dma yet.) TLT target is 106 with
my top end target being 96.....with the possibility of a return to 91."

i wonder if you could elaborate on the debt covenant. its after all a tracking
stock so I would think that would pertain to liberty media as a whole, bit im
just speculating. QVC is a pretty big business. They have "big loser" products
coming out as well as Obama stuff. I believe they could be the walmart of their
field and should benefit from more people sitting at home and watching tv with
time on their hands. I dont consider this a lottery ticket but a play on the
continued growth of retail sales through interactive media. I expect they will
survive this recession.

LINTA - the debt covenant was mentioned in a report from Barclays (formerly
LEH).I assessed it via Fidelity. Condition is Debt/EBITDA<4 with the current
value being 3.8.

I think you are correct that this would pertain Liberty as a whole. Malone has
already some maneuvers to counter that but the fact is as a whole his
enterprise is build on leverage optimization to achieve return. Nowadays the
rule is the simpler the better. Complex enterprises with high leverage are
exactly what i don't want to own right now.

I like those stocks, EKS, for their dividends and their business strengths.
Their businesses ought to be able to weather a recession. (Maybe not their
stock prices though) I'm a buyer of any if they'll drop to new lows. Missed KMB
past few days. Have open order for PG, SYY, at lower prices (These are co's
with many years of dividend increases.)

Here's a site I found now that ranks dividend payers that have a good history
of increasing dividends:

http://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/25-year-dividend-increasing-stocks.php

And:
http://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/10-year-dividend-increasing-stocks.php

Also, fwiw, Kiplinger has a screen that sorts stocks by number of consecutive
years of dividend increases (with a max of 25 years).

Hi Paul - Thank you for the link. My strategy is similar to yours on picking up
shares when/if they hit "New Lows". There is no urgency to buy now especially
with the weak market outlook. My credit union cash is yielding 3% while I wait.

Here is a link to a stock screener (finviz.com) that I have been using. Below
is a screen for dividend payers >4% yield with a Market Cap over $10B.

What's nice is you can further drill down by industry and sector. From the
results page, you can sort by P/E and by clicking on the ticker you can view
the company specific detail.

I think it might be interesting to overlay these results with the dividend.com
ratings to see what emerges.

The only thing that is not available is a sort feature that displays
"x-dividend" date.

Here is the detail for Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB):
http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=KMB&ta=1&p=d&b=1

Notice the lack of the insider "Buys" at the bottom of the page.

FWIW, I also added PG to my watch list Monday.

Oops. You might be right, Spekulatius. BNI might indeed be the railroad of
choice. Got a little more CSX though with an open order that filled. Possible
error by me.

I suspect that all the rr stocks might have difficulty this year. Perhaps
there'll be no standout stock in the sector. I'm intending for now to try to
hold on to my three:

re RR, GWR seems pretty expensive. KSU was traded as a takeover candidate and
think it would be good for them to take a decent offer. the main thing that
they have going against them is the high cost or capital because of their lousy
credit rating.

It seems to me that those RR really should at looking to create a cost to cost
network. We have CSX&NSC in the east and UNP and BNI in the west. If an east
cost player combines with a west coat play is would create a cost to cost
player with fairly little overlap. Since all stocks are in the same doghouse,
they could do it as a simple stock exchange and merger of equals. This way they
would not need to do these huge cost savings that need to be done for a
takeover to justify the premium and that tends to screw everything for their
customers. They could do the integration slowly - now that business is slow and
pricing weakens would be the time to do it. Seems to make sense which probably
means it's not going to happen.

However i'll keep an eye on KSU. I think there is a good chance that they
aren't a standalone entity in 5 years any more.

The market is in an orderly retreat. There are not many outliers here (at least
amongst the stocks that i am watching) and just a uniform weakness across the
board.

I do get some significant fills however: More PEP, starters in SNI (22.36$),
PARGF 61.6$ (Pargesa), PCP (54.22$) maybe more if we get a dump into a close
due to Momo shorting as was customary in Oct/Nov.

Still 60% in cash in my IRA and even more so in my taxable account.

Added Anglo American plc (NasdaqCM:AAUK) and DU PONT E I DE NEM (NYSE:DD).

AAUK BV at 8.36/share with $1.36/share cash. Stock closed at $9.40 (five year
low!). Dividend now around 8% but will probably be reduced. Forward PE 2.99 P/B
1.25. AAUK is really a long term inflation hedge for the portfolio and should
do well if there is huge inflation in 36 months. (
http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aauk&ta=1&p=d ).

DD selling at 1.8 x BV with $2.38/cash. Dividend at 6.5%. Debt level is ok with
LT Debt/Equity 0.58. ( http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=dd&ta=1&p=d )

Started to deploy new cash previously sitting in Treasury Money Market. Cash
level still around 25%. Portfolio yield now at 8% with several preferred REIT
shares added last month.

APH, SNI -
APH stock is retreating ahead of earnings. If earnings are weak and tomorrow is
another crappy day we may get a good buying opportunity. According to my fairly
shallow research APH is the best managed company in the connector business:
Highest growth, best gross margins etc. in n"normal times". This business is
taking a deep dump which at least partly is due to inventory correction which
should play itself out fairly quickly. I expected APH to emerge as one of the
first from this slump. TEL is another company in this field that I am
following. Not quite as good as APH but dirt cheap. If APH report is bad enough
we might also have a buying opportunity for TEL. This stock has already come
down a good deal.

SNI is a cable channel play. They recently spun of their newspaper business.
SNI owns marque channels like Food Network HGTV, DIY Network as well as some
web properties. Food Network and DIY Network are doing great and HGTV seems to
be doing OK. the stock is not extremely cheap on a PE basis (PE=11) but on a
leveraged adjusted metrics (EV/EBITDA) it compares well with other media
companies. The interesting thing about SNI is that there is virtually no debt .
60% of revenues are advertising so there is some economic vulnerability there
but the remainder is Cable fees which are continuing to rise. This is a spinoff
I have followed for a long time , it seemed too expensive at 40$, mildly
interesting at 30$ and is now trading at 22$. Quite a discount for an unlevered
and largely unimpaired business. I think a few years down the road, this will
go for top $ again.

Anializer's strategy to pick through the rubble when the dead are lying on the
battlefield and the smoke clears is a good one but the current downturn also
offers the opportunity to buy some best in class midcaps at very attractive
prices. I am planning to do both.

AAUK -
the low was at 7.27$ on 11/20 according to yahoo and E*Trade. i don't think
that was a misprint I bought my last batch below 8$ and then had no guts to buy
more :-(. I think this will eventually turn out OK - i also have a buy order in
below 9$. AAUK has a decent balance sheet and they are generally a low cost
operator. I also think they will cut the dividend as they are smart enough to
see that a rebound will need quite some time.

DD - I cannot see the attractiveness of this company. If I want to play
chemicals I am going to buy BASF (BAS.DE) when the stock goes below 20 Euro
again. They are the low cost leaders due to their skill to build and operate
large integrated plants. The chemical business is in a deep recession right now
but i think it will also lead out.

Hi Spekulatius - The Dupont story for me is their big expansion in China into
Solar panel manufacturing. Here is my previous post from November and pictures
of their new manufacturing facilities in China. This division should double
their sales in 2 or 3 years to over $500 million. Pretty good for an R&D group
with just over $10 million in sales in 2004.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=24792715&srchtxt=dupont%20solar

The other bonus in Dupont is their Pioneer Hybrid seed division (
http://www.pioneer.com/web/site/portal/ ). They are 2nd to Monsanto in
worldwide hybrid seed sales. They continue to show good growth in their hybrid
seed sales in Brazil.

The Dupont Energy & Utility division (
http://www2.dupont.com/Energy_and_Utilities/en_US/ ) may get some Obama
infrastructure money specifically from their Power Generation & Distribution
unit ( http://www2.dupont.com/Power_Generation_Distribution/en_US/ ) and from
their Water & Sewage Treatment unit.

Dupont is not just a chemical company but have other profit centers that IMO
are being sold on the cheap. I was quite surprised by their many other business
divisions they owned.

DD is now one of my top five holdings and I plan to add more shares over time
on any continued sell off.

=========================================================

I am still quite cautious on this market, My strategy is to move new money in
over time (next 3 quarters) with my focus on good dividend payers that have
moderate to low debt.

Keep your picks coming as I find many of your selections are good one. I
especially liked ENBRIDGE ENERGY MGMT
(NYSE: EEQ). We might get a buying window tomorrow for SPECTRA ENERGY (NYSE:
SE). If it trades lower than $14, I might add a few more shares to my small
starter position.

the market sort this out. I see no reason for the govt and future taxpayers to
subsidize incompetent management. I also think we should be looking at
clawbacks from senior management who benifitted from a ponzi like scheme that

re open orders -
well APH did not fill today. They beat earnings and stock surged. I did buy
more SNI(21.2$), a small batch of AOB (4.32$)and some TOT (48.8$).

I actually sold TMO at 37.9$ since it reached my near term target. BAC
apparently getting TARP'd a second time. If C's earnings are a total disaster
there are going to be nationalized over the weekend, if not they have a few
more weeks to live. Not sure the market gives a hoot either way, so i think we
are going up for a little bit.

I thought a bit about energy and what I want to own. I settled on TOT which I
owned before (and also own via Pargesa). I think they are better managed than
RDS-A. BP has a high dividend problems but problems in Russia (COP as well).
the US plays CVX and XOM are fairly valued at this point. I think the majors
and the E&P are better than the drillers or oil service companies. I think the
latter are going to be massively hammered this year by lower demand for
serves,cancellation, non-paying customers and lower dayrates. The drillers may
be better trading vehicles but short and medium term I think they are going to
a lagging in the recovery if it comes eventually.
