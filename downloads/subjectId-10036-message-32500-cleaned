The 87' crash felt differently in Europe. The 87' crash in the USA was a one
day even essentially - the lowers intraday during the 1st day of the crash. In
Europe I remember a big down day (but not as large % wise than in the US_ as
well, followed by a steady trickle down that lasted until November/Decemember.
It took month for the European markets to get on their feet.

Risk reward this week is better than last week. The banks are backstopped so I
think the credit freeze should slowly thaw. Now we still have to deal with a
recession that is fairly substantial but i think at current stock valuation,
that is more or less already build in. The market is driven by fear rather than
economic factors, IMO.

Cheaper oil and lower raw material prices are a major plus for the US and
Europe as well. That could support margins for some companies, even when demand
is slack. it will also help the consumer. If credit market's thaw enough I
think we are going to see are going to see one heck of a merger/acquisition
wave.

FWIW, I bought more STT today.

CX, fwiw, my buy prices on the shares I still have are:

10/18/'00 @ $9.13/sh
6/'04 @11.53/sh
6/'08 @ $23.02/sh
8/'08 @20.57/sh - 20.23/sh

I believe I'll follow you and try to average down with a gtc for a small
purchase about $5/sh. For me, as I liked it at $9 in '00, I ought to like it
even more at current price.

On the one hand, construction is going to continue at some point, CX is
geographically dispersed, CX is a technology innovator, CX is well-managed
(from my reading of media reports), and the stock price surely is beat down.

OTOH, CX is big in Mexico and while home construction can and does proceed
slowly (residential construction home-owners buy cement a bag at a time), I am
worried that because so much government revenue and spending are dependent on
oil, esp. Cantrell, and because Cantrell is in decline - maybe surprisingly
steep decline - the Mexican economy will do very badly. Worse than just being
appended to the USA economy which is suffering (esp. construction in USA in
which a majority (?) of Hispanics have been employed). Mexico is a very big
market to CX, so that's the big negative for me (compared to my favorable view
in past years). CX also uses derivatives and has a high d/e ratio (although
that common in this capital intensive industry).

re CX, the US$ debt is pretty scary with almost all currencies now falling
against the US$ that could get one ugly bloodbath on the balance sheet. Took a
quick look at CX valuationwise:

CX 5B$ market cap 20B$ debt, 5B$ EBITDA = EV/EBITDA about 5
LaFARGE (LG.PA) 10B$ market cap, 15B Euro Debt, 5B Euro EBITDA = EV/EBITDA
about 5.

Looks like CX & Lafarge trades at a similar valuation as per EV/EBITDA but at
lower gearing. Of course the devil is in the details. Personally I would like
to see at least one of CX balance sheet under the new reality before committing
capital.

For me, since I've followed the company for so long and have faith in

to give up and take my losses or I'm going to bet on the management team
pulling through this. And if I decide the latter, I ought to lower my cost

"What market does or does not believe, does not matter. If we do not have our

buy companies way below their intrinsic value, we are not value investors.

Expecting that market will agree with you as a value investor is, sorry to say,
a folly. If it did, the stock would not be at value price."

The statement that it is different this time ALWAYS applies regardless if we
are talking euphoria or despair.

Bob,

I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, the blurring of lines between the
public and private spheres can be deleterious to both government accountability
to the public, and to the integrity of the market. It's possible that the
government might overlook malfeasance or misfeasance at the firms they invest
in. Also, it puts the government rather than the market in the role of picking
winners and losers. The market is a far better mechanism for doing this than
politicians or bureaucrats.

On the other hand, I think this program could be a prototype for a solution to
our unfunded entitlement liabilities. Whether or not you agree with the concept
of private accounts (disclosure: I am an staunch advocate of them - it works
well in Chile, Sweden, and other countries), the US is facing a financial
catastrophe in 10 years or so if something is not done to shore up Social
Security and Medicare. Even if the fund isn't subdivided into individual
accounts, something like this program could make these systems solvent in a
matter of years.

Hi Paul - Added some SVU today. Should be a good defensive stock if we have a
mult-quarter recession. Stock is cheap at 6 PE with a 4.3% dividend. The
company does carry quite a bit of debt from their acquisition of ABS last year
but they continue to generate good cash flow from operations.

Of the three major supermarkets, SVU seems to provide the best value. My last
sale was on 12/21/07 at $37.80. Seems like $16.50 is a good price to begin to
accumulate shares.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KR,SWY,SVU&d=s

I put some money into TESCO early last year which has held up better than SVU
(only down 22% vs 57% for SVU). I should have bought some WMT.

Sold 30% of my shares of COMCAST CP A (NasdaqGS: CMCSA) since I expect many
customers to terminate their cable subscriptions (cable is a discretionary
consumable). This will impact their cash flow which they rely on to service
their huge debt. The company is trying to raise their rates but I doubt it will
generate enough marginal revenue to offset the loss in subscribers.

Added to SVU yesterday @$16.36. (Why do you and I keep following each other at
the same time into into so many stocks? -g- )

Having post purchase dissonance with SVU the next day (today). Before the add,
had believed I might make it a core (large) holding. Now, not so sure. So very
much a competitive business with new entrants too. The county seems to have
plenty of grocery stores (WMT and TGT expanding also.)

Have not sold any of my earlier purchases (I have some from the Albertson
takeover too.) - Shoulda/coulda/dint, I guess. Have no intention of selling any
now.

Agree with you that by the value numbers, this one looks cheaper than
competitors KR and SWY. (I have a very small exploratory-few shares of SWY.)

Company has more debt than in past because of the Albertson deal. Maybe they
can do something with the debt (like reduce it).

The thing with SVU for me is that the company doesn't have to grow greater than
the market - just grow along with it. Or alternatively, if the market stays
flat, just hold its own. That I believe the company will do.

SVU is one of Mergent's Dividend Achievers, and I hope the company will
continue to try to increase dividends. Mr. Buffett buys brand-name food
companies (e.g. Kraft) at 12 p/e.
I just don't see where SVU can't be held up as a value stock. I have to expect
the stock to do better in a few years with SVU at its current 5-6 p/e and
p/sales at lowly .08. For me, I'd rather take the 4.3% dividend yield and bet
on the 192,000 employees to deliver earnings results, than I would buy treasury
bills.

Once my nerves settle down (if they do), and if the stock keeps dropping on no
adverse news, I may add more.

The key is, as you say, if it is done correctly. The opportunity is there to
have this crisis become a value investment for the government. The challenge is
theory vs. practice.

It requires independence, skilled management and, perhaps the trickiest part,
sustained discipline to act like a business rather than a political tool.

When govt gets involved in business, politicians find it almost irresistible to
exert influence. You can easily see if govt gets involved in banking industry
that pols will want to influence mortgage policy, loan policy, interest rate
policy. And the first heart-breaking mortgage foreclosure story from a bank
with partial government ownership that hits the media... well, you can just

Here is an upbeat article for SuperValu. I bought more today as I believe the
current price is getting quite compelling.

SuperValu: Is It Time To Go Shopping?
(Stock price $26.44 on date of publication- 8/7/2008)
by: Dividend Inc August 07, 2008 | about stocks: SVU
http://seekingalpha.com/article/89816-supervalu-is-it-time-to-go-shopping

Mervyn's recently went bankrupt after agreeing to much higher sales leaseback
terms when they restructured last year with a private equity firm. Their higher
lease rates eventually bled them to death and they announced the closure of all
their stores last Friday.

I was a bit concerned that SuperValu might have entered into similar "sales
leaseback" agreements from their recent Albertsons acquisition. I did not find
any such news.

On their corporate Web site, you can toggle through their retail stores(s) and
see the number, location and store brands they now own. They really cherry
picked the ABS stores (including the high end stores Shaws & Bristol Farms) and
kept the best of the best (ie most profitable & best locations).
http://www.supervalu.com/sv-webapp/retail/retail.jsp

They own the land, buildings and fixtures for the stores they kept. That is why
they sell below book since current BV reflects the new purchases at cost (last
years market value). Actual BV may be even higher if you adjust the value of
their older properties to reflect current market values. Either way, the
current stock price is significantly below BV. Yahoo has BV at $29.00/share!
Based on today's close at $16.50, SVU sells at 57% of BV.

On September 19, 2008 (less than 30 days ago) Fitch reaffirmed their debt
rating at BB+ (investment grade). Fitch said its rating outlook was "Positive,"
which implies an increase in the ratings is likely usually at some point in the
next eight to 12 months.
(http://money.aol.com/news/articles/qp/ap/_a/fitch-affirms-supervalu-debt-ratin
/rfid141057798?channel=%22pf%22).

Here is a six month price chart. Notice the new Yahoo "Event" features showing
both key events and insider transactions on the chart. On October 14, 2008 the
company lowered FY 2009 EPS guidance. The stock traded twice the normal volume
down to $17.42.

I am looking to build a position for SVU to get it to a top 10 position in my

Other than their debit which they are paying down ahead of schedule, I believe
SVU is one of Buffet's "Buy America" companies.

In the retail sector WAG looks pretty defensive to me. Nobody seems to like it
right now because of leadership troubles, but they still showed a decent SS
Gain last time. I guess their earnings estimate may turn out to be on the high

able to win market shares

Another LT winner may be BBY. CC appears to be falling apart and so are some
more regional players. Once this recession is done those companies should still
be standing while their competition is turning into dust. Maybe a tad early but
i think from todays prices the investor is going to make money owning those
names.

I also like VF although i think it is early for that play also. They have a lot
of low key brands (Wrangler, Jansport etc.) that stretched consumer may
gravitate to. Also their balance sheet is sound and they do seem to have a good
management with a plan.

I do not see consumers pulling back on food items much. I don't think that they
are going to turn of Cable TV (CMCSA) or their Dish either as those a
relatively cheap means of entertainment. CMCSA sale may be OK since the value
proposition is not that clear compared to many other straightforward
opportunities out there, so i would probably sell CMCSA as well if i had
shares.

Hi Spekulatius - I own Walgreen Co. (WAG) but at much higher prices. This one
could be a good one to add to. The PE is less then 10 and they only have about
$1.45/share in debt. They always seem to have plenty of customers in their
stores. I like that they terminated their bid for Longs Drugs so that they can
focus on growing their current store base. There would have been a lot of
overlap in store locations.

I have been selling shares in CMCSA since the new "over the air" HDTV
transition starts next year. The new converter boxes are inexpensive and the
picture & sound quality is just as good as cable. Cable is a discretionary
expense and will be the first to go if it is a question of paying the mortgage
or buying food.

It looks like the best defensive play at this point are in several of the drug
companies. These are the one I own but have only added to MRK recently.

PS Could be wrong on SVU as it hit a new five year low this AM. The only

In addition to shrinking pipelines, there is a lot of political risk in major
pharma. I do not think the risk is fully priced in. You may think that the US
government would never invalidate a patent or use the threat of FDA audits of
manufacturing facilities to push business decisions a particular way. But a
year ago, I would have thought the nationalization of the mortgage finance and
insurance industries and a trillion-dollar bailout of the banks was impossible.
Drugs used widely in a primary setting (e.g. statins, asthma medication) are
most at risk, while specialty drugs (e.g. oncolytics, MS treatments) might be
able to preserve pricing. So PFE and MRK have much greater risk than BMY.
Biotech is safer from this standpoint, but valuations in that sector are seldom
as attractive as major pharma looks on paper right now.

I have to clarify. I've no source to back up my wording of "most" loans in
Eastern Europe. "Most" are in Hungary though, and there are Swiss loans in
other countries. I've read also of such loans being in Japanese Yen
denomination.

"The use of non-local-currency denominated loans has become a widespread
phenomenon in Eastern Europe in recent years. In Hungary the most common
currency for such purrposes is the Swiss Franc and around 80% of all new home
loans and half of small business credits and personal loans taken out since
early 2006 have been denominated in Swiss francs. A similar pattern of heavy
dependence on foreign currency denominated loans is to be found in Croatia,
Romania, Poland, Ukraine (US dollar) and the Baltic States, although the mix
between francs, euros, the dollar and the yen varies from country to country."

Hi Paul,

For the record, I also like GE for the same reason as SI Bob.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25021972

For the record, I also posted previously that I didn't like GE at a higher
price. I won't mention who didn't agree with me:).

Regardless, I view GE as a proxy for the US market. I'll take the dividend
while I wait. Personally, if I don't like GE, I might as well sell other US
holdings as well as I think GE is well-positioned for future growth. It's
financial division is outperforming the sector and its industrial section is
still strong. In addition, it has an excellent balance sheet. If GE continues
to fall, the entire market will go with it.

Of course, as you have said before, just my opinion, and I've been wrong
before.

GE: "...it has an excellent balance sheet. If GE continues to fall, the entire
market will go with it."

This thing is a difficult-to-decipher conglomerate.

I claim no expertise regards the balance sheet analysis. I see though they have
almost 1/2 $trillion in debt obligations, a debt/equity ratio of 4.9:1. The
balance sheet doesn't look excellent to me. On the one hand, if it were so
strong, why'd they have give Mr. Buffett such a favorable deal for the
preferred? OTOH, the balance sheet IS strong enough that Mr. Buffett quickly
determined to take the phone call offer from GE and do the deal.

Very roughly and maybe very incorrectly, I divide the company into the key
financial sector and an industrial sector. So many financial companies are
selling for under book value or at book value and/or pay a dividend greater
than GE's 6%. I'm not sure what companies are comparable to GE's industrial -
maybe UTX, EMR, DOV. These companies are selling at p/e's which are at or below
GE.

My point is that while your opinion is that "If GE continues to fall, the
entire market will go with it," my inclination is to believe GE could go lower
to be where competitors are, and it's maybe not like the old days ala 'as GM
goes, so goes the market'. Market could rally and GE remain mired, or GE could
fall further and market recover. Jmo, of course.

edit: GE is a big component of cap-weighted averages, so if GE falls strongly
on company specific news, I have to agree market indexes are affected
could/will fall. I'm looking at possible fall of GE against possible fall of
other stocks - the entire market of stocks.

I agree that they do go downhill with their finance section which was a killer

I noticed lacking newsfeeds for example with BWP distribution announcement that
did not appear on my homepage, neither does it if you type in the ticker
symbol. It does however pop up if you look in the pipeline industry group so
they still get AP newsfeed it's just disorganized.

Not sure but the list of screwup with yahoo/finance gets long and longer

1) Message board screwup when they "upgraded" the system
2) new email is terrible (slow etc.), so I am still on classic (and they did
not make it easy to switch back at some point
3) missing newsfeeds.

I consider going to Google. They do have Portfolios and their format allows to
copy and past the ticker over from Yahoo.

10/24/2008 9:44:25 AM</span>) , though none have been filled yet. The only fill
I've gotten is one of my http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ACAS (<span
style='font-size:11px'>LAST</span>: 10.67<span style='font-size:11px'>
10/24/2008 9:49:25 AM</span>) orders.

I had to laugh this morning because as I was busy entering limit orders at
really low prices in case things got stupidly crazy, Art Cashin came on CNBC
and was suggesting exactly what I was doing. "Put in limit orders at silly
prices".

I dislike the word "hope" in the market, but this time it's in a completely
different context. I hope I don't get filled on all of my orders not only
because some of these are at stupidly low prices (IMO), but if they all get
filled, I'll be entering margin territory more than I typically do even on
trades and never have done on LTBH positions.

Addendum: As I was typing this, I started getting a few more fills. I've got
something like 30 orders open. And there goes another. Got HD at $18.01 (as
near as matters, 5% yield) and http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GE (<span
style='font-size:11px'>LAST</span>: 17.73<span style='font-size:11px'>
10/24/2008 9:44:26 AM</span>) at $17.53. I like to enter my orders (both buy
and sell) a little bit away from round numbers to (IMO) increase my chances of
a fill.

I'm ONLY buying dividend payers now. I see this as a once per generation
opportunity to buy strong companies and their dividends at crazy prices. And
won't sell even to take profit unless I get uncomfortably deep into margin.

Further addendum: My position in our parent company,
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LSE:AFN (<span style='font-size:11px'>LAST</span>:
0<span style='font-size:11px'> 12:00:00 AM</span>) is no longer my biggest
position on a value basis. Not only have I been putting on bigger positions in
other companies, the mothership has been tanking lately and the strength of the
dollar vs the pound has been further eroding the value of that position.

One more: Not getting anymore fills at the moment and I'm frankly disappointed
that we're not getting the kind of tankage that tells me a bottom might've
finally gotten hit. I want to see carnage. Down about 300 on the Dow is not
even remotely hinting that we've gotten what I see as a necessary cleansing
toad-choker of a storm.
