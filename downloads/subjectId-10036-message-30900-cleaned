Spent some time on IAR and RHD. What I don't understand is why their shares
were priced from at $40 and $80, respectively, less than a year ago.

It's been known for a long time that yellow pages is a dying business.

Another thought - these two are likely to try to merge, and probably get
government approval. That could really move the stocks back up.

im pretty annoyed with mcgc management not to mention their ir guy. There were
lots of indications that they were likely to cut their dividend including a
comment by a jeffries analyst who downgraded the stock at the time citing a
likelihood that they would cut the dividend. When I spoke to the IR guy, he
went out of his way to tell me that the analyst's comments were purely
speculative and that management has consistently reaffirmed the dividend
guidance for the year. Although I was skeptical at the time because not only
was it clear that their were liquidity issues but on top of that some of their
income is PIK in other words no cash. Now they have not only cut the dividend
but they are waffling on whether they would raise equity at these absurd levels
now that they have been given a mandate to do so by shareholders with rocks in
their heads. I hope they know their business better than the shareholder

BID's explanation for the cost increase makes no sense. on the one hand, they
are saying that they auctioned more high value items, which have lower margins.
However, a lower number of items with a higher average price should also mean
lower costs. this if course is the opposite of what happened

I think something is amiss here. Maybe the sales need much more prodding from
BID to go through. BID's management will never let us now if the art market

oh yes. i told you i bought a lot more after they cut their dividend and the
price declined on mcgc. As I said earlier it would appear that if they can earn
an average historical return on equity going forward it should result in
appreciation from here a well over my target hurdle of 16% annually. But if
they start raising capital at below NAV that will reduce the potential return
to investors and it irritates me to think that management thinks that by
raising capital below nav they somehow think that will make it more likely that
the stock will return to nav. OTOH if they have the funds to originate more
loans that will increase profitability.

peter:

the reason why IAR and RHD traded at lofty levels for a long time is after the
fact a simple one, the magnitude of the correction in credit markets. What was
1 before is now 0 and not some 0.9 or so.
If RHD was viewed being much more riskier beforehand its stock would not have
traded $70 and its bond at par.

The current credit crisis was in its depth and duration impossible to spot;
even as last as September 2007 the world seemed besides a few gaping holes in
subprime and other RMBS, in order. It was not before this time money market
funds auction securities crashed along with ordinary corporate debt.

Once more I cite my Alt A and Option ARM bonanza, IMB (as well as CFC). While
signals were deeply red for 9 months IMB traded relatively stable at prices
from $20 to $25. It appeared as a value stock earning $2 or more in a good
year. Only in November the real big fall came when it crashed from $21 to $5 in
one quarter. That was when people gave up on stocks which seemeed nowhere to go
before.

I see that particularly in RH Donelly, the fundamendals are not that bad in a
quarter, aside from its monstrous debt levels. In the preceeding good times RHD
did not try to pay back some debt by issuing stock (at $50 to 60 a secondary
would have made sense) or look to be aquired.

The RHD common stock price appears to be a good proxy for credit defaults, once
more. When it was at 60 to 80 it was fully valued. In the latter half year when
the street decided to pull the plug, the bet is now more like, zero valued.

Now with the business at least not growing it has little "exterior" value to
show while the debt stays the same.
Combine that with
. competitive pressures in their revenues
. creeping inflation on the cost side
. debt not going away but essentially becoming more costly as maturities
approach
they are either a cheap aquisition target or see a restructuring. Their income
is too low to sustain the amount of debt they carry around.

RHD creation:
RHD was formed on February 6, 1973 as a Delaware corporation. In November 1996,
the Company then known as The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated through a
spin-off into three separate public companies: The Dun and Bradstreet
Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation, and Cognizant Corporation. In June 1998,
The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated through a spin-off into two separate
public companies: R.H. Donnelley Corporation (formerly The Dun & Bradstreet
Corporation) and a new company that changed its name to The Dun & Bradstreet
Corporation (“D&B”).

RHD does not have significant bonds coming due before 2013, but they rely
heavily on bank debt: 3.7B are in various
credit facilities which must be extended 2010 and are subject to certain
covenants.

Nearly the same applies for IAR: its most significant debt is a bond maturing
2016.

The most important catalyst comes from the unhealthy quick ratio; and low cash
on hand so that a failure to pay interest on outstanding debt can occur
anytime.
In that regard both are weak but IAR got much worse in Q1 08 compared to
preceeding quarters.

BID - I agree with you Spekulatius. Even worse, BID claimed last year that they
deliberately moved towards high value items, since the low value items had high
overhead and presumably lower margins. Now they contradict themselves and say
that higher priced items have lower margins... so why would they move from low
value items then? and why the costs would be going through the roof if they
actually moved towards high value items that have less overhead?

Your explanation that market may be weakening and they are just trying to give
lame half-true explanations is possibly correct. As I said in my previous post,
I would not buy BID here, but may hold it and see how Q2 plays out. IMHO, there
is still a lot of petro-millions sloshing around and BID may do fine. But I
will be extra careful and may sell the whole position if I really think the
management has lost it (again).

I now have an equal weight in PBR and OXY.

Paul, do you still hold RDN, discussed here several times over the last 6

I loved this paragraph from their earnings report:

"Radian Group Inc. (NYSE: RDN - News; the "Company") today reported net income
of $195.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.44 for the quarter ended
March 31, 2008. Book value per share at March 31, 2008 was $35.64. Excluding
the impact of net unrealized gains on derivatives and hybrid securities, the
Company's net operating loss was $215.2 million and the net operating loss per
share was $2.69 for the quarter. "Net operating loss" and "net operating loss
per share" are non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of these measures,
including a reconciliation to pretax income, is included below"

That's what passes for accounting standards? I think the FASB has a hell of a
lot of work to do, and Congress needs to go along.

Edit: Yeah, I know. They're "non-GAAP". It's still bs and useless unless you've

DRYS. I've mixed opinions and mixed feelings on this one.

It looks like the stock's gained about 50% in about six weeks. For a $4B
company, I find a quick a rise like that very, very scary. It's a hot stock.
(Also scary to me.)

Yet the stock/company still has some attractive things going for it that may
(or may not) be reflected in the price.

I'll cross-post from the "Shipping - Oil & Gas Tankers, Dry cargo, LNG" thread:

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=24582647

The gist is that financing for ships is/or might be more difficult to come by.
This could/might/will affect greenfield shipyards (yards that have contracts
but the yards themselves don't yet exist), and small companies who have placed
orders for new ships. It's a positive for larger companies (that banks/finance
companies have more confidence in). This is a positive for DRYS in two ways:
1.) DRYS is big, not small 2.) DRYS is big on the spot market, so any shortage
of ships and increase in shipping rates affects them very positively and very
quickly.

Aside: I like the analyst quoted, Natasha Boyden, of Cantor Fitzgerald in New
York. I've seen her on tv several times, and she does a credible job imo in
explaining the sector and her picks. (She still likes DRYS for a buy if you
believe in advancing day-rates).

The ravages brought by the earthquake in China are severe, and that's going to
require rebuilding and even more resources that China needs. ("The industrial
city of 700,000 people — home to the headquarters of China's nuclear weapons
industry — was turned into a thronging refugee camp, with residents sleeping
outdoors.") This could help get immediate contracts to DRYS. (I do not know.)

DRYS is a stock which will go up if/as shipping rates rise. If rates fall
though, the stock will drop back quickly again too. I have a few shares; I am
going to hold on-- or try to.

even fundamentally its hard to see how the real estate market which seems
inevitable that it continue to decline can be a positive for banks nor can the
lack of liquidity for derivative products and even good loans. the banks needs
to make a leveraged safe spread somewhere but where? I just wonder what it is

a chart somewhere about how all weve seen so far are the subprime problems, but
we havent seen the alt a , and pay what you want reset problems yet. this guy
mcavity is saying the us banks have acknowledged mortgage problems, european
banks have acknowledged mortage problems, but somehow the japanese have not.
Have they suddenly figured out how to be great bankers?
This is my roundabout way of saying that I find it difficult to believe that

Hi Paul - I have owned DRYs since their IPO in 2005 (w/ my most recent buy in
12/07). It has made it to my top five position in the portfolio and I am even
more bullish now since their acquisition of Ocean Rig.

A recent posting from a knowledgeable poster on the Drys YAHOO message board:
What sets DRYS apart from other Bulkers
http://messages.finance.yahoo.com/Business_%26_Finance/Investments/Stocks_%28A_
o_Z%29/Stocks_D/threadview?bn=24683&tid=110194&mid=110194

Each deep drilling rig generates the same income as about 15 dry bulk ships but
the contract period is much longer (typically five years). These rigs are
expensive ($800 million/unit) and take up to three years to build. Ocean Rig
has two of these deep drilling rigs under contract ($637K/day) and has ordered
two more rigs that are scheduled to be delivered 3qtr 2011. It's possible that
these day rates could double by the end of 2011.

There are only 9 of these new 5th generation ultra deep drilling Rigs available
for delivery by 2011. DRYs will own four of them. PBR has recently announced
two multi year lease contracts and stated they will need more as they develop
their new oil/gas offshore oil fields.

I am not that concerned about DRYs spot market bulk shipping strategy as with
their move into the ultra deep drilling market, 40% of their revenues will come
from their drillers division and about 60% from their dry bulk shipping
division.

They do carry a lot of debt and are leveraged but their generated cash flow is
more than enough to cover their debt payments. I would like to see some of this
debt be payed down in the next 36 months and have the company lock up longer
term charters on more of the dry bulk shipping fleet. The CEO has reduced the
size and age of the fleet and has begun to sign longer term lease deals.

Based on the future cash flow from both the shipping and drilling divisions and
a slight PE expansion for the drilling side, the stock is still 50%
undervalued. The company reports earnings soon and the analysts expect
$4.40/share for the Mar'08 quarter. Their current 2008 year estimate is
$18.62/share or 5.25 PE. None of these estimates reflect the drilling rig
revenue as the Ocean Rig acquisition has not closed (sometime in late June).

Looking forward to 2010, it is possible with their drilling division the
company could earn $30/share. With a slight PE expansion to 7 PE, this stock
should still be a good value at $210/share. If it was not for the ultra deep
drilling opportunities that four new rigs add to the cash flow, I would be
taking more profits off the table at current levels.

The currency translation in dollars cost the company 900+ hundred thousand this
quarter and four hundred thousand+ last quarter.

Their ownership in Netsol PK is still sixty percent or seventy million dollars
which translates into the enterprise value of the entire company. You are still
getting their European and American operations for free.

Netsol is the largest IT company in Pakistan. I believe the value compared to
their growth rate is still not recognized in the market. I'm not buying anymore
at these levels, but I'm not selling any either as I already own a large
position.

MBI has a peculiar thing going on. basically it seems thatthey are booking
gains because the market value of their obligations has been going down. FASB
allows write down the value of you own debt to market-market, if you are a
crappy credit. For MBI this adjustment appears to have been 3.6B$ and this is
burried deep in the footnotes of theyr 10Q. the headline numbers only state the
net market to market losses (net=sum of market to market of assets
=liabilities).

Of course writing off the value of your own debt is sort of a catch22 situation
especially if you want the rating agencies believe that you are AAA worthy. As
far as I am concerned balance sheet and income statement with those kind of
adjustments are completely worthless...and so is management that pulls 3.6B$ in
pseudo equity out of the hat.

Greetings from Enron. Somehow i think we have a long long way to go before this
is over.

The gist is ripped from:
http://www1.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=4143&mn=68355&pt=msg&mid=4759315

Excerpt from 10Q:

The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157, “Fair Value Measurements,”
excluding non-financial assets and liabilities per FSP No. FAS 157-2,
“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,” beginning January 1, 2008. SFAS 157
defines fair value as an exit price, representing the amount that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. SFAS 157 requires that fair value
measurement reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an
asset or liability based on the best information available. Assumptions include
the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique (such as a pricing
model) and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model. SFAS 157 also
clarifies that an issuer’s credit standing should be considered when measuring
liabilities at fair value. SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets and liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). SFAS 157 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-2, which
delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2008, for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except
those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). A transition adjustment to
opening retained earnings was not required. Upon adoption, the credit valuation
adjustment to incorporate the Company’s own nonperformance risk on the insured
credit derivatives liabilities resulted in a reduction in fair value of $3.6
billion of the derivative liability as of March 31, 2008.

It's not as black and white as you suggest. If - a big if - I had money to buy
the debt at discounted prices, I could retire it all at exactly the number
specified on the balance sheet - the market price. Of course the problem is
that MBI or anyone does NOT have money to retire the debt and that's why it's
trading below par. ;) However to suggest that they are cooking the books
somehow is not really correct. I like what Marty Whitman says about financial
reports, to paraphrase: "Financial reports cannot be prepared and should not be
prepared as if they could provide simple answers to equity investors. Most of
the adjustments are made to make the some number 'simpler', but this just
confuses matters more. Financial reports should be prepared so that
sophisticated investors could figure out what they need to know about the
company and that's it." Take a look at Berkshire financials. Buffett is
supposed to be a gold standard in investment community, yet I can pretty much
guarantee that you will not be able to figure out what the values, investments

My 9/07 exploratory buy of IDT @ $9.07/sh has declined substantially. At

The line of reasoning that If I had the money I could retire the debt at this
price is flawed becuase the fact is they dont and they cant, and if their
situation should improve then that debt will cost more to retire. Its a legal
liability at par as long as its not retired and accounting is supposed to be
conservative not liberal. Furthermore it doesnt take into account that the
price of the debt will increase as more of it is repurchased so valuing it all
at the market price is spurious too. It is as black and white as i suggest
because I am in investor and I want to know what a company's current legal
liabilities are, not what some impractical far fetched possibility might be.

None of my three brokers can transact trades on the Sao Paolo exchange yet.
It's more expensive but I believe one can find undiscovered value opportunities
before the big mutual and hedge funds jump in. American Latina Logistica looks
very interesting. I believe after 2011 they will have a lot of their special
debt financing paid off and you will see a big increase in their dividend pay
out.

Your post on the Shipping - Oil & Gas Tankers, Dry cargo, LNG board highlighted
Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR)http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=ULTR which is
not a true value opportunity but does have some hidden assets. One of those
hidden gems is their River Business operation. Their River Business segment
owns and operates river barges and pushboats that transport dry bulk and liquid
cargos through the Hidrovia Region of South America. River barge transport is
the third leg in cargo transportation in Brazil (with trucking and railroads
the other two). On a cost per pound/mile River barges are probably the most
efficient way to transport bulk cargo. If such an operation could be integrated
into a company like American Latina Logistica, the company would make quite the
domestic shipping conglomerate. Remember, all of the commodities produced in
Latin America that are shipped to other countries have to find their way to one
of the several sea ports. Brazil is the largest global grower of soybeans,
producer of paper pulp and exporter of raw minerals. In a few years you can add
both oil and NG to this list.

Did you know that both ARACRUZ CELULOSE SA (NYSE:ARA) and VOTORANTIM CELULOSE
(NYSE:VCP)http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ARA,VCP&d=s
use river barges exclusively to transport their paper pulp to the sea port for
transport by dry bulk carrier to China.

OT: I agree about ULTR.

It's a company involved in various aspects of shipping. I have difficulty
showing its a value stock. It may be though, in that Yahoo shows a low (?)
estimated p/e of 7 for 12/09.

I'm buying it for its possibilities in Brazil - although they operate in
several S.A. countries.

Further info. on the Hidrovia region from ULTR website:

"UABL (edit: part of ULTR)is the largest owner and operator of river barges and
pushboats that transport dry bulk and liquid cargos through the Hidrovia Region
of South America, a large area with growing agricultural, forest and mineral
related exports. This region is crossed by navigable rivers that flow through
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay to ports serviced by ocean
export vessels. We believe that this river system offers the most efficient
means of transportation for bulk cargos through the Hidrovia Region. At over
2,200 miles in length, the Hidrovia Region is comparable to 1the Mississippi
River in the United States and produces and exports a significant and growing
amount of agricultural products. For example, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and
Bolivia produced, in the aggregate, 39.9 million tons of soybeans during the
1995 / 1996 season compared to 115.7 million tons during the 2006 / 2007
season, a compound annual growth rate of 11.2%. Production for the 2007 / 2008
for these countries is estimated at 115.9 million tons, which accounts for
approximately 53% of world total soybean production estimates. In addition to
agricultural products, companies in the Hidrovia Region are expanding and
initiating the production of other goods, including forest products, iron ore."

Company is moving barges from USA to where they believe the greater revenue and
profits are:

From 5/12/08 report, http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/080512/142538.html

"The Company is in the process of building its new barge building yard, and it
has also continued its barge expansion program. The Company completed the
positioning and shipment from the USA of 30 second hand barges and one second
hand push boat and is in the process of positioning a second similar shipment
during the second quarter of 2008 comprised of 27 barges and two pushboats. "

Company might benefit from the recent Brazilian oil discoveries:

"The Company believes that the market in general continues to be strong and the
new Brazilian oil field discoveries are encouraging as to future requirements
of modern large vessels such as ours." (Large ocean-going vessels and offshore
supply business being two other parts of ULTR.)

I'm hoping for and expecting good things from Ultrapetrol over the next few
years.

I was never aware of American Latina until it was mentioned here. By chance, a

Latina - it's in a couple/three of their funds I see now. So, as regards
American Latina, at least one big mutual fund is already in; thus for me, I'm

Anyway, the company decreases loan reseves but then mentions 5.5 million in
"special mention" assets that could have trouble down the road, including the
fact that they have some loans past due and have "overloaned" to a single
customer.

The stock is a great value if things stays as they are, but if these
development worsen then it could get uglier. And, I am starting to
dislike/distrust management already.

If the economy turns around this should do well (and the Fed cuts should help

do not even consider a scenario where revenues may shrink.

As far as military is concerned just be careful to assume that more soldiers
(if it ever comes to that) mean more weapon spending. 3/4 of the military
budged goes into salaries and maintenance. If the total spending pot remains
the same, the weapon funding will shrink.

The company's ``insatiable'' demand is forcing producers including Exxon Mobil
Corp. and BP to pay more as they compete for the remaining units... Explorers
that don't have rigs under contract may delay projects or pay rents of more
than $600,000 a day.

``The oil majors have their backs against the wall as Petrobras has
aggressively locked up significant rig capacity,'' said...

Petrobras is negotiating for as many as 17 more vessels to probe the Tupi
discovery and neighboring fields, said Bill Herbert, an analyst at Simmons &
Co... The company already controls almost seven times as much capacity as the
next biggest user of rigs that can drill in 7,500 feet of water, according to
research by Dahlman Rose...

I relooked at UNH and WLP today as Buffett announced increases in both
positions. Note that both positions are still pretty tiny for Buffett (~200M
per each, compared to billions in his major positions). I also relooked at our
discussion with Spekulatius about these two.

They look better than KFT, but not much better. Huge goodwill and intangibles
pretty much obliterate the equity. In current environment, there is no clarity
what kind of issues are there in their "long term investments". Still their
balance sheets look better than KFT's. Income is also problematic, but possibly
may recover.

I am now more on the edge to perhaps buy a small position. But maybe I will
sleep it over. :)

Hi Grommit - I would say that the huge run in oil is mainly due to the weak $US
dollar. Maybe as much as 18% of the 26% gain is from a weak $USD.

The chart below compares the $USD to $Euro, $CAD, $BRL and XOI. Notice that the
XOI tracks the currency gains especially in the $BRL (Brazil Real). 10-18% of
this year's gain is due to the weak $USD. The lagger might be that of the $CAN
and that may be where the future value opportunities might be found.

http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=EURUSD=X#chart2:symbol=eurusd=x;range=1y;com
are=cadusd=x+brlusd=x+
^xoi;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;sour
e=undefined

Other than PBR, most of the other integrated oils track the performance of the
XOI except XOM and PCZ. Of the list presented on the graph, PCZ may be
undervalued to the others by 5%-10% especially if the $USD falls further to the
$CAN.

^xoi;range=1y;compare=^xoi+pbr+xom+cvx+bp+cop+pcz;indicator=volume;charttype=li
e;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined

Based on the $US and $CAD, many of the Candian oil companies and Oil Trusts
appear to be undervalued. The $CAN is only up 10% to the $USD but the XOI is up
19%. Petro-Canada (PCZ) tracks the XOI but the of the Candian Oil Trusts I
follow ENERPLUS RES FD (NYSE:ERF) and PENN WEST ENERGY TRU (NYSE:PWE)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ERF,PWE&d=s have underperformed perhaps as much as
20%.

are=erf+
^xoi+pcz+pwe;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale
on;source=undefined

I continue to hold all my integrated oils and Candian Oil Trusts and have added
some new money to PBR. Based on the above, I should add new money to more of
the Candian Oil Trusts and start a new position in PCZ.

There are at least a couple of pitfalls to be diversified or over diversified
(depending on one's perception). The risk of inadequately following a
particular stock (too little weighting, failure to understand company, etc.)
and the risk of becoming sloppy about a particular stock that moves
significantly (As: It's only such a small part ($) of the portfolio so so-what
if it drops 50%).

I want to reiterate though,

1)It is only received wisdom that the larger the number of stocks held, by that
fact, the greater one will approach average results. That is not necessarily
so, imo. I find it's a function of dollar-weighting within a sector and being
in the appropriate sector at all. So, for example, as for oil/gas stocks, I
find the important decision is whether and when to be in any or not. Whether a
person is in for 1-2 or 15-20 or 20-50 different positions, this is a
risk/reward issue. Where for me, I am on the side of having less business risk
with individual companies (a risk which occurs with picking just 1-2 companies)
which is offset by my not going for the greater or greatest rewards by
attempting to define, seek, and pick only 1-2, the "best" opportunity.

2) There's way too much testosterone emphasis about "beating the market". There
are studies out that show many/most? individual investors aren't even getting
'average' results long term (Ibbotson 10%/annum average). For somebody old like
me, looking back, with perhaps now a more acute sense of compounding, I say
somebody who can invest regularly and who can get 10% compounded annually over
a few decades -- that person is going to be okay financially at the latter part
of the lifestage. I realize of course younger people want it NOW, so view
"average" results as unacceptable. Looking back though...a different story.
Imo, in my experience.

I also got a feeling that some of the gas and oil plays are getting highish. I
am thinking of selling (or lightening) BJS, APA, and BSIC. Although after I
sold EGY, it continued to rock up over 10% in couple of days. I guess it's the
proxy fight + overall oil companies going up.

I cant help but make some commments here. first of all I dont know how reliable
that 10% is. I assume that would be someone holding the s&p index fund for many
years that doesnt have any fees attached to it. My experience talking to less
that financially sophistiated people over the years, which I believe
constitutes the bulk of investors is that they are a. the most likely to pull
their money out of the stock market after a sharp decline, and to put money in
the stock market after a sharp increase. b. when times are tough, they are
among the likely candidates to lose their jobs, and have to liquidate their 401
k plans to make ends meet. This is not particulary relevent to your remarks
about holding lots of stocks or a few stocks in a portfolio. Most research has
shown that the most of the return in a portfolio is market return the second
highest component is the sector and last is the individual stock. Not being
diversified in a sector cost me dearly in the case of silver. I originally
owned cef, paas and sil but unfortunately shifted everything to sil. i am more
diversified with the oil and gas plays though not to the extent you are. I am
simply incapable of following more than 50 stocks or so and acknowledge my
limitations.

comments. FWIW.

>I would say that the huge run in oil is mainly due to the weak $US dollar.

I doubt it. I've been in the peak oil camp for years. for the dollar:oil
correlation, hard to say which is the cause and which is the effect, or is it
just a correlation?

>PCZ may be undervalued to the others by 5%-10%
PCZ is one of my favorites. a nice, low PE, but they do have refineries. :o(

>Based on the $US and $CAD, many of the Canadian oil companies and Oil Trusts
appear to be undervalued.

I do not understand what the canadian tax effects will eventually be. I have
lightened up considerably on trusts and moved to US reits for dividends. ???

Elmatador, as regards rebalancing for stagflation and Brazil, I am trying to
figure what products/services/materials Brazil, with its new wealth or stature,
will buy from the USA. Of course, oil service/oil equipment/etc. This is
already well expected, and many of us have bought stocks of such companies in
anticipation of this.

I guess maybe more Brazilian imports of airplane parts, maybe more medical
equipment. Maybe IT stuff - for banking, management effectiveness.

Do you (or anyone else here) have any opinions on what Brazil might increase
its imports of? And what companies exporting to Brazil might benefit?
