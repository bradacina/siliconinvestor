Look, Paul, we could all post our biggest success and say that that proves
value investing works. What a waste of time. Congratulations. You made a lot of
money on a growth stock in a bull market. If you're going to play that game,
post your biggest loser too.

I like to hear other viewpoints, but that is why I subscribe to Barrons,
Business Week, Fortune and the Wall Street Journal. You have a viable strategy,
but this thread is supposed to be for commentary on value investing - period.
We all like to see newcomers, but the last thing dedicated participants want is
for this to become a general investment forum, or even worse, a growth vs.
value debate.

Paul, I will confess to being one of those MBA-types value investors love to
laugh at. We could discuss the theory of finance into the wee hours over a
couple scotches, and I would tell you why I think its garbage, but this is not
the place for that. Maybe if I told you about my biggest winner that would
convince you? And if it wouldn't, why do you think anecdotal evidence would
convince anybody here? My favorite question to ask candidates I interview is
"Tell me about your biggest loser."

You believe portfolio theory. I don't. I understand it, but I reject it. But if
you do, then of course you understand that a monkey investing in high beta
stocks would have outperformed the index for the last two years. The part of
MPT that you're not talking about is that it applies in reverse. In a bear
market you are going to get murdered with that strategy, unless there is much
more to it than you are telling us.

And if there is, I'm not sure if I want to hear it. As our fearless leader,
founder, and all around good guy - Mike Burry - pointed out oh so politely,
this is a value thread. If you look at past posts, it is intelligent talk about
value stocks and value investing. No comments on the market's latest move, no
hyping the latest IPO and no debates about growth investing. If you have no
interest in value investing, you're in the wrong place. And if you do, then
participate in the discussion. I like newcomers with different ideas, but I for
one do not want this thread to become a general investing thread, or some inane
debate about value vs. growth.

Tried to post this once but think it got lost. If it went twice sorry all.

I agree. I have no interest whatsoever, in seeing high P/E stocks mentioned
over here unless they are busted growth stocks where the P/E
on recovery earnings would be very low.

My experience is that this is the kind of stock where you can make huge gains.
Traditional value stocks tend to trade in ranges and have poorer growth
prospects. IF you can identify a real growth company that has fallen
TEMPORARILY on hard times, I am interested - perhaps
like a CYMI or an EFII were at $14.

deep deep value = too good to be true!; your comments disappoint me. The
payments are accrued because this company is controlled by ben lebow. He is the
"hidden liability" as he wants to keep all the money in the company to invest,
presumably at a return higher than the 55% internal accretion rate that
retiring the pfd at current prices would garner. the russian investment is
returning a higher return but it certainly is not as risk-free as buyback would
be. Maybe he'll continue his buyback in the near future.

As for your assumption that the manager does not have a track record deserve
more than $15 million, you fail to do your own homework to see what that
manager started with. (see Forbes, 4/22/96). Maybe he is as undiscovered as his
stocks. Check out is 13-D filings and you may see some consistency and real

Mike & all,

Just have to post this. Happened about an hour ago.

They usually can't get by my secretary, but she was gone and I answered the
phone. It was a broker trying to get my business. He's got this 'hot stock'. So
and so has been quietly taking a large position in the company etc. etc.

"I'm not interested. I make my own selections. I'm not interested in
speculation or street rumors. I buy based on value according to my research."

"You want value? I'll give you value!" and he names a stock. I happened to be
on line doing some research so as he's giving his speal I look it up.

"Let's see, it's selling at a PE of 30, growth of 15%, 9 times BV, debt to
equity of .7, and it's low on cash."

"LOW ON CASH? THEY JUST GOT A CREDIT LINE FOR ANOTHER $14 MILLION!!"

Dear Paul Senior,

>much bearish sentiment and too much emphasis on macro stuff. Are you >too
>scared to make money? -g- Paul Senior

I am sorry for the sentiment. I call them as I see them. Stock prices are
higher now that at any time in history no matter how you slice it.
The historical record could not be clearer. These are the highest PE ratios of
non-depressed earnings in American History! We are presently 15%-20% above 1987
and 30% above 1929 on a PE basis. True, inflation and rates were higher in 87
but they were both lower in 29.
Worse, earnings quality is also very suspect due to stock option compensation
(which is not expensed), merger accounting gimmicks, and operating costs being
moved to the "one time charge" line. There is an excellent article about
earnings quality in the March 23, FORBES. You can get to it from my page
(news). Barrons also did a number on Disney this week. Since Value Investing is
about finding very good deals, it is hard for me to imagine many competent
value investors being very enthusiastic about this environment. I still have
some investments in the U.S. But they were mostly made years ago at very
attractive prices. Most recently (last year) I was finding terrific values in
Europe. All have since advanced very significantly. Values are equally
difficult to find in Europe now also. The macro stuff is sort of essential even
though I don't particularly like writing about such matters. Asia is a very big
deal and I believe the crisis is still very much in progress. Current stock
market rallies are basically an irrelevant event. All the economic news out of
the area is horrid. When events of this magnitude occur, you just have to pay
some attention. Asia represents 30% of world GDP. There are also all sorts of
banking and derivative issues which have yet to be resolved.

So I am sorry about the bearishness. It is not a market call. It is valuation
call. I am not afraid of making money, I am afraid of losing it. You can't make
much money paying more for a business than it is worth, but you can lose some.
Remember Warren Buffett's 2 rules.

1. Never lose money.
2. Never forget rule number 1.

By the way, I am a shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1988. When it was a
terrifically undervalued stock.

Wayne Crimi: aarggh. Well I asked for it -gg-. You are going to suck all the
energy out of me that was missed by Paul Levy. --gg--. What I like about you
guys is your rigid unwavering devotion to your beliefs, even if they are
unencumbered by fact or other alternatives. And the really good part is... they
apparently work for you!

You have sliced and diced the data every possible way to come up with the
statement "Stock prices are higher now that at any time in history no matter
how you slice it."?? This is a fact or opinion?? How's about if I cut it as
small cap value stocks circa 1963? Microcaps in 1969 perhaps? Airline stocks in
1950's??? Gold stock prices are higher now than ever before? You've checked all
of these slicing possibilities and more??

You can't imagine competent value analysts being enthusiastic?? Try this
('course I'm not qualified by anybody as competent - or a value analyst, but
still): We are in a two-tier market like the '60's. But instead of the nifty
fifty we've got the nifty S&P. Money is being poured into these S&P stocks, and
maybe is pulling money out of stocks that are iffy - that is, where companies
have something not so right with them -- characteristics of value companies! A
reasonable possibility IMO; after all we are dealing with human nature where
now we want those Dells and other popular stocks not the dogs of value land (as
if any great body of people actually ever did want value stocks). So value
investors in this environment should be expecting many opportunities to find
and invest in upcoming value stocks. I find 'em (but then again I not qualified
etc.etc.) Nice article in today's Morningstar.net though about a value investor
who does seem qualified, and she's finding a few things to talk about.

Also a very germane article in theStreet.com today. One columnist interviews an
analyst who apparently knows everything there is to know about Chase (the
bank). Says they are overexposed to Asia and they are in denial about it --
hoping it blows over. The stock could crater -stay away. (I'm reconstructing
all this from memory, but I think I got the gist right.) But then Cramer comes
on with an article saying, yes the guy is right, nobody is better at the
analysis... but so what? The stock is a bargain at the current price, the guy
has been critical for years, and HE NEVER MADE YOU ANY MONEY. Is that you?
Except you got it better. If you shake people out of buying and you're right
and the market craters, you're a hero. And if you do scare people and the
market rises or they don't buy these good companies that are available, you
still win ...you've got Berkshire and others going along for the ride. Even if
the market drops, you're partners with the gov't on these stocks bought at 1988
prices--you win again!

My intent is to do what works. Buffett's holy two rules are useless in my
opinion. Because there is only one person - Buffett - who has never lost money
on a stock deal (as far as I can tell). There's maybe another guy on this
thread, possibly 2; and I will even put you in that category just so I don't
have to have my face rubbed in it -g-. EVERYONE ELSE has LOSERS if they are
Value Players. It's in the nature of the game. That's why Graham was
diversified. Therefore, a more practical two rules would be: Everyone sustains
some losses in the stock market. Expect that and learn to live with it. (i.e.
plan to minimize and recover and recoup).

And uhhhh, I'm losing it here...need to refocus on purpose of this thread which
is to find value plays. I interpret that to mean: talk about stocks - value
stocks- that will make us money. Anything else is merely commentary at best and
not serving the purpose of the readers... so I think I have to stop now...

And I have just enough energy left for a double martini, so I will go out and
get myself a frozen yogurt -g- (tby.. still a little too overpriced for me

Paul,

You'll have to admit that it's getting tough to find 'em.

I keep coming up with companies that have great growth histories but don't seem
to know where to go from here. Lotta cash, low debt, but a lot of competition,
tighter margins, and management concerned about the value of their options.
Doesn't occur to them to do some belt tightening and declare some dividends.
Instead they'll buy back stock so the value stays high - for who?

Or - they go looking for an acquisition. This way they can show revenue and
earnings growth. We're supposed to ignore the big 'goodwill' number they put on
the books.

Ran 146 stocks last weekend, found 7 worth further research, scratched last one
off the list today.

I don't care what the market does, but I think it's more difficult to find
value stocks at decent buy-in prices.

>>If it will not, then they will not go up now, and

I think in a real bear market everything gets hit as people want out of stocks
altogether. Better to be in cash if you think one is coming. Value stocks will
be sought only after the bear has taken everything down.

One needs to get the bigger picture (I'm not sure I have it, yet.). There are a
number of places money can flow as it exits the stock market. People keep
looking at the money flow and say, "What can bring this down -- there is just
too much money flow into stocks." This is always the belief at this time.

However, capital flows are a very nonlinear phenomena. A very small change can
affect the flows to a great extent and self-reinforcing moves in the opposite
direction can happen, too.

Anybody out there tracking the breadth or know of a location that I can go to
get a good handle on what is happening in the breadth?

Wow, this is getting really interesting. People (read: more

thread and tell us how irrelevant value investing is. At about
the same time, friends and acquaintances are losing all patience with
my talk about value but perk up when someone says "this one
will double by December." These are the same ones that say, "I'm
making 40%" and expect it to continue. Recently two people approached
me about helping them do commodities for even bigger gains - 30-40%
in stocks isn't enough. One of them thinks commodities aren't enough,
he wants options on S&P futures.

As I run a value investing web site, I can also tell you that
I approach 200 hits/day when the market shakes out like in October
and January, but am down to 60-70 hits/day now. People don't need
ideas - they know to just pile into the stocks everyone talks about,
a strategy that has worked well the last 15 years.

I tell my editor that Dell at 140 is an albatross that has just
been shot, and he says no way, the money flow is just too
strong. That money flow brought it to around 122 pre-split within
a few days.

Certainly is interesting...last year I was bearish on valuation, but
never before have I had so many people slap me in the face with

Jeffrey,

Re: LTXX. My approach is not to buy tech companies
that are behind the pack. It's OK to buy 2nd and 3rd and
10th company in non-tech business (e.g. what is the order
of Citibank, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Nations Bank etc.?).
It's usually a losing proposition to buy a tech business
in 3rd position. Being behind in tech means lower sales.
Lower sales mean low profits, means low R&D, means falling
behind even more.

To summarize, a value play in tech land may be
a very lousy play, because they may never recover.
Of course, they may be bought out, but that is gambling,
not investing.

In case of LTXX, I see the value - PSR < 0.9.
However, I also see TER and CMOS as the leaders. If you can
figure out whether LTXX has a defendable niche that TER and
CMOS won't touch, then it may be a great play. Otherwise,
forget it. If you have to buy LTXX, get a subscription
to "Infrastructure" and check their story on it.

On the other hand, some semi-equip leaders have
interesting valuations now: KLIC, ASYT, CFMT, SFAM.
The valuations may become even lower in the future, so
do your homework and buy your choice.

Good luck

If most people are declaring value investing dead, and most

Mike, I had the 1973-74 experience and you do not want it!! Let me put it in
the context of DELL. DELL at its high had a price of about $70
and a P/E of about 50. In '73-74 the first leg down was $60, which we just had
in 1998. The only trouble is there were about seven more legs down and the
stock would have ended up at $7 with a P/E of 5. Yes, there were lots of stocks
that ended up with P/E's of 5. Almost everyone, including me, got killed
because even the value investors would have been buying DELL at $15 and lost
half their money.

As far as LTXX is concerned the two best pieces to read are the last quarterly
release and the front page article in the 3/23/98 edition of Electronic News -
see post 1152 on LTXX thread for URL.

I think the comment about not buying a second tier tech company because lower
sales means lower R&D dollars and falling further behind
is very astute. However, that would tend to apply to a small tech company
trying to be a "full-service bank" so to speak, as opposed to selecting a niche
where the resources it has are enough to keep it competitive. VTSS is a great
example of a second-tier company that has done very well in its niche. The
companies trying to compete with Intel on microprocessors are the other side of
the coin.

The appeal of LTXX to me, for a modest amount of money, is the balance sheet
and relative valuation to peers CMOS (somewhat larger) and TER
(much larger), and the foresight described in the Electronic News piece with
their Fusion product - the "catalyst". The problem is I
do not have the technology knowledge to assess the likelihood of success, and
have to rely on customers buying so far (Hitachi) and
company (biased) and analysts comments.

IF LTXX is successful with the current strategy, the price could triple. If
they are not you could probably get out at $3.75 book value or better by the
time you find out. I wish all my stocks had those odds.

First of all, I would regard VTSS as the first-tier
company in its subfield. What I mean is that depending on
your technical knowledge you can subdivide large fields into
subfields and find subfield leaders. E.g. INTC is a semi
field leader. VTSS is GaAs subfield leader, ALTR is
FPGA subfield leader.

The problem with subfields is that they have to be viable for
growth and "secure" from larger predators. E.g. assuming that
LTXX is a leader in discrete component semi-test sector, is this
sector going to grow, and is there assurance that TER will
not enter that subsector?

For example, WJ has a great product line that is a
standard in the industry. However, the products don't need to
be replaced that often and there is not much growth in that
niche. (WJ info per Andrew Vance). On the other hand, all
surrounding territory is taken by AMAT, NVLS, LRCX, so
WJ faces an uphill battle to expand into new products. This
is a "niche squeeze" that shows investors a profitable company
with high margins, but with potential of bottomless R&D
expenses if the company decides to grow. And notice that AMAT,
NVLS and LRCX even don't plan to wage an all out war on WJ.

In addition, WJ has a good management - they are just
in a difficult position. Is management of LTXX good enough
to find their way into a "golden niche"? The past results
are not persuasive.

In summary, I buy subfield leaders when I know
that subfield is secure and growing. I also look at the
management expertise and vision. I don't consider LTXX
such a case and I don't plan to spend time to change my
opinion. I don't claim that I am right, and it's possible that
new LTXX products will push them to splendor. It's
also possible that the valuation is so low that the stock will
go up without much fundamental change. Do your own
homework.

I'll ask one question though: why not KLIC?

On stocks generally, I like ones with low valuations where only a modest change
in fundamentals or perception can have a solid impact on the price. That way, I
am not requiring a whole lot out of the company to get a good return; and the
risk is usually less than average.

Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), the commodity egg producer which I mentioned
a while ago, is one where I think no change in fundamentals is required, just a
change in perception.

LTXX I view as one where only moderate success with its Fusion product
would lead to a material rise in price. The two references I mentioned
earlier suggest that the odds are decent that the company is at a positive
inflection point in its fortunes. (Gruntal was not even interviewed for the
Electronic News article, and they are the firm with the strong buy on it -
target $11 - because of the new product.)

KLIC is obviously a better company and decently valued. I also see no
inflection point. KLIC will do better only if the industry or its perception
changes. LTXX will do better if they make a hit with the product. I prefer the
stock price to be more a function of what the company does.

Two caveats - I probably know a lot less about technology than you do,
since that is not my background, and I am NOT jumping up and down for
LTXX. I think it is interesting and bought a small amount. I liked DPMI much
better at 26 when I bought it, primarily because every way I looked at it I saw
it as "mispriced", which is a label I put on a company I find exceedingly
attractive and worthy of almost unlimited investment.

Jeffrey Bash: YES. (re: reliving '73-'74 market). Starting to get cold sweats
thinking about it again. Problem with owning value stocks now in such a climate
as '74 is that everyone who is anyone in the press is negative, people are
indeed burned and burnt out, and you can buy (I am giving guesses here,not
facts) GM for maybe 3x cash flow, AEXP for 8x pe, XRX for 6 pe with a 6% div,
food co's (they're "safe" at pe of 9),Merrill (if it wasn't bot out tomorrow
-g-) for maybe 7x pe (with expectation for no earnings for 2 years),REITs (that
haven't folded) for 15% yields ('cause everyone thinks their div. will be cut -
and they often are cut), etc. etc. And the guys who were sooo right about
shorting the market -- they covered way long ago and mostly didn't make what
they could have (unless they were so stubborn they never sold in any of the
bear rallies). (Everyone thinks these guys would be gloating or at least happy
that the market has tanked. But they aren't because everywhere they look they
see pain - theirs, their neighbors, TV, etc.)

So why - in such a market - would anyone hold - let alone think of buying -
SWR, SJP, or any alleged value stock? The ans. is they don't - they don't want
or hold. That is why it is so important not to be overinvested now, to realize
that there is a margin of safety only - not a guarantee - with value stocks, to
be diversified, to have patience and staying power to realize that these are
businesses we are talking about(not just pieces of paper), to give these
business time to work their stuff in a country of great opportunity. ..... Ahh

Barry Hall: re: Just Buy. And being facetious.

But you ARE correct. Just buy has been the correct policy for people who want
to make the most money. (to maximize returns unadjusted for risk).
Some studies apparently show value investing beats growth investing (risk
adjusted, maybe absolutely too??). But it sure doesn't feel like it to me now.
It does seem so much easier and comforting and profitable buying Microsoft or
Dell etc. And I don't mean it sarcastically. Jealous- maybe -g-; I never bot

Just that maybe those with the most guts make the most money in a bull market.
And it's pretty hard to argue with success or the expectation of continued
(40%/yr??) success. But it is a long term game for some, and in that sense,
value investing has a place (I hope -g-).

In the summaries of performance I did here a while back, it looked to me like
it could be a possible bet to choose those stocks that three or more posters
said they owned. Maybe even 2 or more posters. That would lead someone to buy
SJP and WHX and DSWLF - all of which turned out very well (IMO).

Now at least 4 of us are owners of ELAMF. (Come on ELAMF -g-.) And at least a

Paul,

I'm hesitant to post this.

I admit that my criteria is a little tighter because I don't hold as many
stocks - and I go for the VERY undervalued. I look at every stock I see
mentioned by certain people on SI, but my most profitable have been the ones
I've found myself. I've made a lot of mistakes and I've been lucky. I've only
lost on one major position (out of 38 buys), but there's many that I sold far
too soon.

I look to sector, then financial stability (very low D/E), strong working
capital, and good history of performance by current management. If all of these
things fit, is it at a good buy-in price? Usually this requires that the market
has dumped it for the wrong reasons, occasionally because it hasn't been found
yet. This does narrow down the stocks I would buy.

Two reasons for me to sell: usually because it has gone over value (my
criteria) but sometimes because I've found something better.

I have found it difficult to keep track of a wide variety of stocks, so I own
only 2-4 major positions at any one time. I keep small positions and continue
to track most stocks I have owned in the past, updating my files on them in
case they become 'buys' again.

I believe I do a lot more research than most. I've been preparing and reading
financial statements for years and can catch most of the BS. (I've put enough
into them myself) I also feel this let's me make judgements on management.

IMO - Market investing is a matter of finding a method that fits your ability
and your risk tolerance. Based on past performance, I consider my investing
moderate risk with high reward.

BTW - I feel it's hard to profit from investing if you let tax liability
influence your decisions.

Except for a brief period years ago, I have only been investing in the market
since Sept of '96. I realize that I am inexperienced and less educated compared
to many that post on these lists and I respect their expertise. My posts too
often reflect many years of being the 'boss'.
It's difficult.

I seem to be drawn now to looking at foreign stocks for value

Interesting. Looking at my portfolio, though I didn't intend it this
way, it's 30% foreign (TBR, ELAMF, DESWLF) 40% US (SJP,MSA,PHSYA,SWR)
and 30% multinational (BMC, HYDEA, YUM). Just going where the
value is, and the US is more expensive. I especially can't believe
the discounts that are placed on TBR, ELAMF, and DESWLF compared
to their US-based counterparts.

Anyone want to suggest their single favorite foreign value idea?

Re: JBM

Jan Bell Marketing was a stock I brought up here I think,
definitely on my web site, and then as my first stock on
Microsoft Investor. It was a net net at a true 2/3 of
net working capital less liabilities. Looked like crap, but
as I pointed out, was working on the inventory, had good
cash flow. When the story ran it was at
about 2 3/4. 2 5/8 was Graham's net net 2/3 criteria.
Now it's around 5. Take a look at the following report:

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980318/jan_bell_m_1.html

Simply amazing numbers. They did everything the CFO told
me they would do. My first professional double, yet I actually
managed to lose money on it, buying at 2 7/8 and selling at 2 3/4.
Even now at a double, it lookslike one of the remaining U.S. values
out there. Net working capital is up to 110 odd million and the
company is selling just above that. It's got 48 million cash.
No debt.

Also, St. Joe's is back at 32.5, below net asset value by
my calculation and down from a recent 36.

You make a valid point. However, when most analysts talk about market levels
they are talking about stocks in aggregate. The S&P500 and the DOW are at the
highest PE ratios for non-depressed earnings ever. In addition I have seen
broader based indexed PEs that suggest very similar circumstances. (Nasdaq -
40x-50x , Value Line Expanded Edition 20x 3500 stocks). Clearly there may be
some sectors that are not at all time highs. In aggregate though it is not
close. We are in orbit.
Bargains are an endangered species.

I agree that the S&P500 in aggregate is more overvalued than some other areas.
But as I suggested above, the nasdaq and most other small caps are also very
very high.

>>Also a very germane article in theStreet.com today. One columnist
interviews an analyst who apparently knows everything there is to know
about Chase (the bank). Says they are overexposed to Asia and they are
in denial about it -- hoping it blows over. The stock could crater -stay
away. (I'm reconstructing all this from memory, but I think I got the
gist right.) But then Cramer comes on with an article saying, yes the
guy is right, nobody is better at the analysis... but so what? The stock
is a bargain at the current price, the guy has been critical for years,
and HE NEVER MADE YOU ANY MONEY. Is that you? Except you got it <<better.

What you are talking about here is almost nonsense. It is very simple. If you
buy a bunch of businesses for less than they are worth you will make above
average returns over the long haul. (and vice versa) That these things
occasionally take several years is of no importance. Cramer may generate above
average returns (although I doubt he can do it without leverage) but he is
generally a hyperactive trader who judges his results by the last 5 minutes. I
judge by the end of the game - meaning years. That is the real test. If Chase
has the problems that the analyst says, it will eventually be reflected in the
price (lower). That other analysts and Chase itself have yet to recognize it
makes for a great opportunity to sell it if you own it. (all assuming the
problems really exist) The timing of the inevitable decline in price is
impossible. I can assure you that Cramer does not know either. It will catch
all but the most lucky longs.

>>If you shake people out of buying and you're right and the market
craters, you're a hero. And if you do scare people and the market rises
or they don't buy these good companies that are available, you still >>win.

Yes, that IS value investing. That's what's sufficient and necessary.

What I don't get, is why then, there is SO MUCH discussion about the level of
stocks, so much 'the sky is falling', and so relatively little about specific
companies on some value threads. Is it that the developers just like to hear
themselves talk and write about the big things in life rather than dinky little
net-nets, low PSRs or the other gritty or unpopular stocks we value investors
sometimes have to buy? Setting the stage, getting the context... okay; but
where are the current stock picks? (This is a reflective and general question -
not attacking you nor referring to your site(s).)

And there is a reasonable explanation also IMO. In the case of Porcupine, who -
when I asked (after visiting their sites) for some specific stock
recommendations here - tried to take my head off -g- -- I did not realize then
- he or she (or it -g-) - had partners or associates and they apparently run a
business managing money or writing newsletters - so he/she/they were not about
to give us on this thread - any ideas, let alone their best ideas. So maybe on
some of these value threads, if I do want concrete investing ideas, I must pay
$ for it. That's okay...I just would like to know that before I start writing
these missives and get myself in trouble -g-. Note: I haven't a clue about your
site(s) which seems "free", and I am not referring to it.

Specifically, I just want stock market ideas - specific value stocks to check
out that the writer or analyst has recently actually purchased, i.e not just
screens. (and also not a "model portfolio" where I'm left to interpret "model"
as synonomous with "theoretical".) As I visit some of these "value" sites I
don't see such specified value stocks, and I am learning not to expect them.

Mike and All,

I was interested in the valuation of the foreign component (TBR, ELAMF, DSWLF)
of the portfolio, since they are arguably all emerging market stocks. I was
wondering how some of you more-experienced foreign-market value investors would
address the following questions (more in general than as they relate to those
specific stocks):

1) How do you adjust enterprise value for political and other non-financial
risks? Comparing ELAMF - headquartered in a very volatile area of the world -
and an "equivalent" American company, how should one adjust their measurement
of enterprise value to compensate?

2) Do you manage or make adjustment for currency risk? There are various
well-known approaches to currency risk: hedge the currency exchange, diversify
your currency risk among many countries, discount the currency risk as part of
your valuation of the company, or ignore the risk. By discounting the
valuation, I mean allow a percentage of the valuation as a margin of safety.
For example, to hold TBR, it would need to x% cheaper than an "equivalent"
American company and, if you were one of those sell when fully valued people,
you would perhaps sell it if it reached than percentage discount.

3) Do you make any adjustment to an enterprise's value due to foreign tax
rates? For example, I noticed that DSWLF's profit margin should be 50% higher
than an "equivalent" American company (paying 33% tax) because DSWLF
essentially pays no taxes. Do you think that DSWLF is worth 50% more than an
"equivalent" American business (i.e. if all other things were equal, they
should trade at the same P/E)?

Paul,

It's not hard to see what the problem was. I ID'd my own problem late
in 1997: it all comes back to portfolio concentration and the antsy feelings
that come with owning very few stocks. The other issue was that there were
constant cash withdrawals from the account - 40% of
that account went out the door last year. Now I'm
dealing with money that isn't needed for at least 10 years.

When I only had 4-6 stocks, it was hard to sit on a JBM
and HYDEA as 1/3 of the portfolio. Too illiquid and
manipulated by MM's. It's easier to be patient when the bid/ask on
something like HYDEA doesn't eat up 2-3% of your portfolio each day.
So far in 98, I've had just two stock sales, but I still have >7.5%
positions in each, so I basically own everything I've bought this
year.And my portfolio swings haven't been more than 1% in one day on
the downside all year. Never more than 2% even on the upside.

This peace of mind, and in my opinion more disciplined and successful
investing, has come from a 10 stock portfolio. In my reading,
I rarely see anyone recommend a 10-12 stock portfolio, though it
eliminates about 90% of the non-market risk. Going to 16 stocks
only takes you to 93% and going to hundreds of stocks only gets
you to a few more percentage points.

Still can't explain why I didn't buy JBM when I saw it at 2 5/8
in January though...

Mike and Paul, please let me jump in - briefly. I think Portfolio management is
a key especially in choppy or down markets. In bull markets small portfolios
are risky but you may get away with it.

Al Frank has a good understanding of portfolio management IMO. He recommends
for example 20 to 30 stocks for a $100,000 portfolios. Yes, that is overkill
for minimizing systematic risk; however, with the funds spread out no one or
few mistakes will demolish the value of the portfolio. And assuming that it is
comprised of value stocks and that you wait until the stock reachs full value
before selling it, this approach can be very profitable as demonstrated by
Frank's performance over the last 20+ years.

Stock picking is important but just or maybe more important is portfolio
management and patience to wait for the full value to bloom.

One man's opinion. Good Investing!

Mike,

Presenting this for discussion.

As I posted on another thread, I ended up buying TSEMF - Tower Semiconductor.
I've been following it down and it seems to have hit resistance. A fund sold
off their shares and buyers have not yet surfaced because of sector weakness.

I have avoided tech stocks for over a year now because I considered them
overpriced, but the market has totally dumped them and I thought it might be a
good place to look for the oversold. I feel Tower to be a good buy at this
level.

Tower is selling @ $11.00. EPS was .33 last Q, 1.45 for the year. Analysts have
projected earnings of .01-.11 for this Q with a consensus of .06, .40-.60 for
'98 and consensus of .50. I can find no additional dilution.

$11.00 is 88% of BV. They have +/-$6.00 in cash. This makes no allowance for
high depreciation or their technology. Any buyout would be at a much higher
price and they are a good buyout target.

My thinking:
For them to come in at the consensus, they would have to make no cost reduction
and see revenues fall over 50% from last quarter. It's the same for the '98
projections. They would have to continue the R&D, G&A, and overhead expenses at
'97 levels in spite of a 50% drop in sales. This is a well managed company and
I can't see it.

They projected a decline in sales. This would automatically cause them to lower
inventories. Throughout the sector, suppliers and customers have lowered
inventories in anticipation of lower prices.

I've been reading about the sector. Planned expansion of new wafer foundries
have come to a big halt. This is particularly true in Asia with companies
lacking monies for capital expenditures. Even some projects that had been
started have been put on hold. This isn't a labor intensive business and the
devaluation of Asian currencies would not give a major advantage. There is an
increasing demand. Prices have been under pressure, but Tower seems to have cut
costs and maintained margins.

IMO - Selling below BV with Tower's strong balance sheet, TSEMF is a very good
buy at this price level. Revenues will not fall off enough to cause earnings to
be at analysts projections. Tower will make cost reductions to compensate for
lower revs. The Asian problems actually give Tower an opportunity. Inventories
are being depleted. By year end, Tower will rebound strongly.

Where am I wrong in my reasoning?

Portfolio management. I agree with Michael. I used to own 15-20 stocks, but
then cut it back to 8-10. That's a number I can keep a close eye on, and it
makes me really do my homework because I might have to sell something I like to
buy a new one. When I had 15 stocks, I figured, what's another tiny position.
I'll finish my research later. But with just ten, each one is a big investment,
so I double check the numbers. The first rule of investing is "know thyself"
That's how I think. It may not be how you think.

And if you're worried about a major disaster wiping out a big chunk of your
portfolio if you are wrong, then you will also miss the opportunity to hit a
home run when you're right. I had 25%+ of my portfolio in St. Joe for most of
1997 and had about 20% in Philip Morris in late '96 to early '97 when it went
up 40% in three months. That made up for my losers and then some.

I agree, its hard to keep track when the number of stocks gets past 10 or so.
And like you, I have had portfolios with a small number of stocks like MO that
have done quite well because of strong moves by one of the stocks.

However, it works the same with a highly diversified portfolio too because
upward moves from 25% of the portfolio can boost the performance significantly.
Again, assuming investments in value stocks and waiting for full value.

And like you said - "Know thyself." I guess we should start there before even
trying to put the other pieces in place.

Thanks for the comments. Is St. Joe a good value now?

add to right now. I am very selective. I require a high quality company with
good growth prospects, clean balance sheet and an attractive price. I simply
can't find any additions at present and have been accumulating cash.

The last 2 things I bought were Applebee's (APPB) and Diagio ADR (DEO). I
bought APPB at 20 and again at 16 for an average of 18 over the last few
months. It now trades at 22+. The value is still reasonable but I have some
short term concerns. This was very marginal deal for me and if they miss the
first 1/4 by much I am gone. I bought DEO at 36+. It was 47+ this morning. I
bought at the end of January. THis is the merged company of Grand Met and
Guinness. They have numerous great brands and merger savings coming down the
line. I would not add to my position at 47 but I belive there is another few
points of upside to fair value.

Ha. Well I disagree with all of you! 3-5 stocks or 9-12 say, would be okay for
someone really trying to catch the pitch and make a lot (and willing to assume
a higher risk IMO). 10-12 positions way too risky for long term patient value
investors. Growth investors, maybe okay -- all you need is a couple of Cokes,
and MO's and hold the heck out of 'em. For value investors, got to always be
planting seeds. Note Mike's portfolio. No stocks reported bot prior to '98. (No
time diversification.) Al Frank is not a good example to use -yes, he's
associated with buying large numbers of different companies - 75, 100, maybe
more - lots of time diversification, biz. divers., but his portfolio results
are heavily skewed by large amount of margin. (His example doesn't proove the
diversification case IMO.)
Let me ask you pig-at-trough investors. If HWP dropped 25 points for some
superficial reason (say the HWP Pres. had a heart attack --- that wouldn't be
superficial to him though -g-), what would you do? Sell a position you've
researched the heck out of,and have owned for a while, (and so has good
prospects per your evaluation) and buy HWP? Substitute a potential better
value, for one you already have evaluated? That'd only be okay IMO if you fit
in the category in my first sentences above. But for value investors - I
believe Graham says one can make an adequate return with value stocks, not
necessarily get rich. So if switching, my opinion is that it is not value
investing to give up one value stock for another. JMO. Paul

I'll bring this one to the thread's attention again, with the disclaimer that I

approx. 1 million shares, or 4.5% of shares outstanding. This isn't the guy
down the street calling his broker (unless the guy is a mutual fund or hedge

The company is Resource Bancshares Mortgage Corp. (REMI). 15X '97 earnings, 8X

To set the record straight on Al Frank, his margined return for the period from
1977 thru the first six months of 1995 is 22.92% annually, hypothetical
unmargined 16.95% annually and the S&P 500 14.48% (est.) annually.

You buy HWP if you have the cash. Otherwise you wait till one of your carefully
researched and held value stocks reaches full value. At that time it is sold
and if HWP is still a value it is bought if is the best value.

One of the subtleties of this process is the fully valued number is always
changing based on the fortunes of the stock.

Okay. I stand corrected.

How many stocks do you think you actually do know? Your portfolio turnover is
what, 100% if you include 1997. Plus stocks you evaluated that you didn't buy,
that you should have bought? You know a bunch more than 10-12. Even the last 3
you've just recommended. It's the second go-round for you with them, so you
already know a lot-- maybe enough to quickly make a buy decision. As I say,
stocks are like old girlfriends -- they keep coming back into your life,
sometimes pleasantly and surprisingly so -g-.

Yes, statistical. I would not take a sample of the stock market with less than
30 stocks. Darn few portfolio managers own fewer than 20 stocks. And only a
couple - Torray,Yacktman,etc. own maybe 10+. Can't emulate Buffett - doesn't

Michael,

I glanced at ALR. Do you know what caused massive losses
and revenue drop $147 mln -> $65 mln in 1994? Of course,
debt/equity shot up at the same time. I would not buy
this stock without explanation because we might be in
for another surprise like this.

In other words, how do we know it's not a cyclical
high or a favorable-military-contract high with no future?

Refac is very similar to ALR in its uncertainty.
Look at max year chart @ Yahoo and 7 year revenues,
earnings @ WSRN.

The only positive is that they did not have loses -
probably because it's mainly a holding company. Accounting
and balance sheets are probably a headache.

Sorry, that I am asking questions without much homework,
but what I see is not very exciting. Looking forward for
other arguments pro and con.

BTW, I liked your idea on buying HWP. Did you follow
through?

My two macro ideas currently are HWP and BA. Don't
ask for valuation models. These are buy-and-forget stocks
of industry leaders selling below 1.5 PSR. They are not
screaming buys, but just OK places to put spare cash.
BTW, some people would substitute INTC for HWP. A matter of
taste, I assume. :-)

For more value oriented guys I'll throw in boring
LDL.

ALR is one of those small cap ultra-value stocks

The answer to that hypothetical (HWP) is pretty straightforward. If you are a
value investor you are seeking to hold a portfolio of stocks with the greatest
value. Presumably you've calculated the present value of each stock under
consideration; simply choose the portfolio of stocks with the highest present
value at a given level of risk. Obviously, taxes are a consideration here, and
before you sell one holding to take advantage of another you should include
taxes and transaction fees.

Hi Paul,

"you are implying that everyone else is doing value investing (esp. portfolio
rebalancing) incorrectly? "

I've read and re-read Paul Levy's post and, frankly I don't see this. I'm still
on the learning curve here but my understanding of value investing was to
determine a present value, sell when it reaches full or fair value and to
include the tax rate when you determine when to sell. I know I'm not telling
you anything you don't already know but I didn't understand your response to
Paul's post.
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:3/27/1998 12:13:00 PM
From:Chuzzlewit

Paul, if you are a value investor, then presumably you have a way of
calculating value. In general there are two approaches:

You could look at the balance sheet and restate the assets according to current
market conditions and then compare the net worth per share to the market price
per share.

The second approach is to estimate the the risk-adjusted present value of the
free cash flows. This is essentially the approach taken by Value-Line without
explicitly telling us how they do it.

Any other method is a surrogate for one of the two methods above. For example,
if you study a company a great deal you may come to the conclusion that its
leverage is too great and you are uncomfortable with it. Well, obviously that
is only one inputt that would be used by the present value approach as an
adjustment to the discount rate. If you think about it you'll see that all of
the frequently used heuristics of value investing are really manifestations of
the components of either valuation model.

I wouldn't dare to suggest that you are investing incorrectly, but I would
suggest that if your buy/sell decision is based on "value" that you have some
way of quantifying "value". Once you quantify value the portfolio balancing
exercise is straight forward.

Finally, let me point out that those "target" numbers that brokerage houses are
so fond of publishing are value estimations (albeit set in the future).

Paul

John Kolb: What's so straightforward about calculating present value to make
portolio allocation decisions? It's getting more and more complicated the more
we discuss it. Now there are two general categories from which to choose - in
addition to risk levels to consider, and tax consequences. You matrix and rank
all this in a mathematical model in order to make decisions? I certainly don't
operate this way.

Where have you ever seen anyone on this thread say about xx stock, "and this is
its present value.. $aa."
Do you have present value calculations for your stocks which you use for
decision making?

Unless of course I am being too analytical here. I just assume the words
present value, mean some sort of discounting using actual numbers. If it's an
intuitive something about the risk level is too high or I need 2 months more
for a long term gain, well that's just not my interpretation of "doing" present
values.

What I am trying to say --stepping back to the start of this mess -g- is that I
believe it is a mistake to swap out one undervalued stock for another stock
which is presumably even more undervalued. Because no one can predict
accurately when the values will be realized. For example, on this thread we
have seen opinions where someone says, yes, xx is undervalued, but it doesn't
fluctuate too much, so I'll sell it and buy yy , and maybe later I'll still
have a chance to get xx again at its same price (after capturing a gain on yy).
I believe that is suboptimizing performance not enhancing it. That's IMO. Paul

Hi Paul,

You're absolutely right: I am nowhere near operating that way! :)

BUT, that is my goal. As my inspiration I use Mike Burry's analysis of the
dreaded Oxford Health Plans. He reviewed and posted the numbers and felt that
it was a reasonably good buy on the basis of market over-reaction. Then, as the
numbers continued to come out of that company he continued to plug them into
his model and altered his position accordingly. What impressed me so greatly
was his reliance on the numbers to make a rational decision in a difficult and
potentially emotional situation.

So, my feeling is that a reliance on the numbers as they are released in
quarterly reports ought to give you present value. From what my new book from
good ole uncle Ben says I should be able to determine what my gain will be when
the market value reaches present value given the tax I will have to pay when I
sell. If this potential gain is less than the potential gain I could get by
having my money in another stock then I figure I'm better off doing that.

That is the goal anyways and I've probably mis-stated it. Having said that, I
should also say that I am no good at this. I held OXHP when Mike sold and if it
weren't for a heroic averaging-down maneuver at $14 I probably would still be
crying! Conversely, in the stocks that have actually gone up I've watched as
they exceeded my guess at value and they are still going up!! Don't get me
wrong - that's a good thing - but it tells me that I am still not able to
determine a solid valuation for this market.

Whatever I may say though I cannot deny that my best results have come from
doing the very least. When I try to get fancy and shift things around then I
end up being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I tend now to be in a sort
of holding pattern with a few companies I am very pleased with while looking
for exit strategies for the many with which I am displeased.

I continue to learn and these discussions are a tremendous help.
Enjoy your posts, and please call me John :)

John, since you brought up the OXHP story, I'd like to relate to you my
experience with it. I went long OXHP last spring because it looked like a great
growth story.

In July when they released their second quarter numbers -- quite exceptional --
I began to feel uneasy because the stock was dropping from about $89 to the
high 70's. I rationalized this by thinking it was just short-selling that
accompanies every rapid grower, but I felt uneasy and began to watch the news
much more closely. Straw #1

Other HMO's were having cost problems, but why not OXHP? The analysts were
saying the problems were company specific, but that begged the question. What
was different about OXHP? There didn't seem to be anything that I could find.
Straw #2

During the spring and summer there were a number of lawsuits against OXHP based
upon its very slow payment rate. Straw #3

In the early fall a consent decree was entered against OXHP concerning late
payments. It was noted that the new accounting system that OXHP was installing
was not going in as smoothly as anticipated, but once it was installed things
would be a lot smoother. Straw #4 broke the camel's back!

I concluded that OXHP was in fact different from the other HMOs only in that it
didn't know what its expenses were, and the erosion in their cash position was
very telling. I exited the stock in the beginning of October and began to warn
people about the potential danger on the OXHP thread.

After they dropped from $70 to $29 I continued to warn people because the
inescapable conclusion is that their numbers are still not to be trusted. Given
that inescapable fact, using potentially bogus numbers in the best of models
will not yield reliable results. The risk is just too high! Until there is a
thoroughgoing audit there a simply too many uncertainties surrounding this
company. Caveat emptor: GIGO.

to be smaller and smaller and the profits for REMI less and less, is that

Paul, I don't claim to be the brightest guy in the world, nor do I do as much
number crunching as you and others on this thread. I really respect the guy who
follows this company for the firm I do business with. I'm sure he has the
normal analyst pressures, but he has made some excellent calls...really
plugging away with a Barnett Bank reco, as well as coming on EDS near the
bottom, among others. He's good, although certainly not infallible.
I really feel these guys are in the sweet spot as far as business is
concerned...low interest rates, high new home sales. The risk, of course, is
that said excellent interest rate environment will end abruptly.
As to subprime, it is only a small percentage of their business. I am not crazy
about the stigma it carries either, but I believe management is doing it as a
means of diversifying their business portfolio.
Most simply, I like this stock, as I may have stated before, because my source
believes it can grow at a 30% clip over the next 3 years. It's multiple on
current earnings is about 15X, on 2 buck estimates for next year less than 8.
Compare that to Countrywide, a company in a similar business, projected by VL
to grow at an 18% clip over about the same time period, trading at about 17X
this year's earnings (1 Q to go), and 16X next year's. That is my most
simplistic investment thesis for REMI.

I have ADEX in my watch tickler. Similar to ZIGO in industry segment and
prospects. Key value ratios a little better, ie P/B and P/S at 1.36/1.36 vs
2.44/1.72 for ZIGO. Have you researched this sector? Who do you consider the
strongest players? Appreciate any input.

Monday March 30, 7:30 am Eastern Time
Company Press Release
SOURCE: Hvide Marine Incorporated
Hvide Marine Expects Lower-Than-Forecast First Quarter Results
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., March 30 /PRNewswire/ -- Hvide Marine Incorporated
(Nasdaq: HMAR - news) today announced that it expected earnings in the first
quarter of 1998 (ending March 31) to be well ahead of the previous year's first
quarter, when it had earnings of 33 cents per share, but approximately 25%
below analysts' consensus estimates of 57 cents per share.

The Company attributed the shortfall to lower utilization rates in its offshore
energy support business. Domestically, in the Gulf of Mexico, there were a high
number of drydockings and unscheduled service interruptions. On the
international side, utilization rates suffered from the start-up of new
operations and the fact that a significant number of newly acquired vessels
were out of service due to upgrading in preparation for new term contracts.

Day rates for all the Company's offshore vessels, both domestic and
international, continue to show firmness, which indicates an improving
performance in the quarters ahead as the Company continues the process of
integrating new vessels into its fleet.

The Company's other business segments - offshore & harbor towing, chemical
transportation and petroleum product transportation -- are meanwhile performing
satisfactorily.

The Company is expected to announce actual first quarter results on May 6.

Statements contained in this press release relating to the 1998 first quarter
and beyond are forward-looking statements. These statements reflect
management's reasonable judgment with respect to future events. Although the
Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated as a result of various factors, including cyclical or other
downturns in demand, unanticipated additions to industry capacity, changes in
the Jones Act market and weather conditions. All forward-looking statements in
this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
statements in this paragraph.

With a growing fleet of 267 vessels in two core businesses, Hvide Marine
(pronounced ''VEE-dah'') is one of the world's leading providers of marine
support and transportation services, primarily to the energy and chemical
industries.

Paul,
Most are up 15-25% in the 11 weeks since the past post. HDCO (which was on the
watch list) is the only one with less than 15% gain (an actual 15% loss) and
MAX is up over 40%.
My current thinking is still that I like all of these long term with APPB
having the most long term competition.
Short Term:
APPB - Hold until it breaks above 24 and then accumulate. This could take
months to a year.
DSWLF - STRONG BUY still. ADD above 23 as it should run to 28 within a week of
crossing 23.
ELXS - I sold mine at 16-3/4 after incredible 50% runup between earnings and
then slowdown in profits. I hope to buy in the 11-12 for a long term hold
again. I may have to pay 14 to get any.
HDCO - I never owned since 1996, and am tempted below 37. I think PC's will get
hot with Windows 98. This company has good management but I don't know if Year
2000 problem will effect them. I'll probably buy soon.
MAX -40% runup with no revenue growth. Take 1/2 off the table near 9 and buy
around 7-1/2 for intermediate timeframe traders.
MEOHF. Short term dud. Commodity is selling at lows. I took my 15% profit for
the short term position. I hope to buy back near 7-1/2 to 8 again.
NTAIF - No revenue growth, but still undervalued. Should do even better when
ASIA heals.
OO - I sold 1/2 near 12. Hoping for one last pullback under 11. It should run
well this summer unless company is a dud. All the troubles with Sunglass Hut
should be done.
regards,
Richard
p.s. Look at strength of VIP. A breakout above 42 may get this to become a
CANSLIM momentum type stock. Great earnings in a tough Russian economy.

Yes, the nature of the announcment concerns a S-T problem, but the question is:
is this their only problem? Not in my opinion, the boat co's are not benefiting
from the same supply and demand imbalance that the drillers are. IUt tkaes a
very short time to build new supply boats. therefore supply is not constrained,
while demand (bqased on the number of rigs at work) is basically fixed because
the the long period of time it takes to build a rig (1 to 2 yrs) . the only way
for the boat co's to increase profits is for the supply of rigs to increase
faster than the supply of boats. That ain't going to happen. Stick w/ the
drillers.

Re: HMAR

It seems in value investing, one can often ignore bad
business economics if one knows how to identify the going
rate for dogcrap and pay half that. Reducing costs and
paying off debt can make even dogcrap realize an intrinsic value
higher than the market price - granted, this is not a Buffett
approach but a Graham one, and the holding period should
be appropriately shortened.

Hvide appears on its way down. If it retests its last low
at 15, then we're paying 1X book and sales and just about 10 X
earnings for a profitable business, giving us a 12-15% ROIC vs. <10%
if we bought above 20. That looks like a half-price sale to me,
and is attractive to me even if it is dogcrap.

You make a good point, Mike. But that opportunity is more often available with
companies in isolated niches than with large groups of companies in an industry
that on the surface appear similar and tend to move in groups, both up and
down. The P/E of HMAR is unlikely to get to be (your) "half" of a driller's
P/E.

Jeffrey, re:>>The P/E of HMAR is unlikely to get to be (your) "half" of a
driller's P/E<<
Being a number thing, I suppose it depends a lot on what numbers you choose to
use and how much you decide to argue about it-g-; but, I think that you can
make a strong case that HMAR's p/e is already at fire sale prices compared to
the drilling group. On a trailing basis, you could compare RIG trading at $53
w/ a ttm p/e of 39 to HMAR at $18 with a ttm p/e of 11.4. On a forward basis,
after adjusting for the .14 shortfall in estimates announced today, HMAR at $18
with a Zack's est. for '98 of $2.69, compares to NE at $32 with a '98 est. of
$1.95 (and you can make a strong case, imo, that NE is a good value play.)
Just a thought.

Mike, why not pay 9x '99 earnings for NE where your upside is tremendous and
the fundimentals look solid for at the very least.... several yrs.

LT - You won't find anyone on this thread that thinks buying a stock that has
averaged a point a day up for the last 9 days is making a value investment.
Despite your excellent argument, HMAR is more tempting to us value guys I will
bet.

Those of us without expertise in this area would welcome more comment on HMAR.

Ron, Let say that TSEMF makes .50 in 1998. At $10,
a share, the PE would be 20. The chip manufacturing
business has an overcapacity that will last for
another 2 years. The delays and cancelation of new
plants today proves the overcapacity theory. The
chip growth in 1998 is forecasted to be 14 percent vs
17 percent in 1998. TSEMF states the next two quarters
will be losses. You say the price will rise because
of inventory reduction and cost cutting. IMHO there
are better bets like putting more money into DSWLF.

Hi jeffrey bash,
If your research skills is pretty good, I have
a diamond in the ruff for you to look at. FAMH
is a temp service agency. First the goods. PE is at 6.
Growth is 28% last quarter. Revenues will increase
from around 9 million to around 60 million due to
a string of acquisitions. The acquired companies are
profitable and is expected to boost profitability.
The bad. Management is unpredictable. Company is
non reporting, not listed on NASDQ. IT's a penny stock.
The thread FAMH is a juvenile insane asylum. Recently
things have improved. FAMH is in the process of being
audited by a reputable accounting firm. Famh is being
merge with a NASDQ company which will take care of the
listing and penny stock problem. Can anyone figure out
this company?
