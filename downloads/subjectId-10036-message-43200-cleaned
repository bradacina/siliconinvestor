Hi Clownbuck -

Do you have an opinion on Spectra Energy Partners, LP (SEP)? Their 2010 annual
report shows their EBITDA at $117.1M. The company's EV is $3.47B. That's 29.65x
well above the 8x amount that you use as a benchmark value threshold. So I
would assume you see SEP LP as grossly overvalued?

However if I look at their forward PE of 17, a total LT Debt/ Annual Net Income
of 4.5, selling just below 2x BV; the stock appears to me to be undervalued to
it's peers and slightly overvalued to the rails (transportation of NG & Oil by
rail). When you look at a niche player in the rail group (lessor of Oil & NG
rail cars), GMT is equally profitable but carries much more debt than the
pipeline companies.

It's possible but not as cost effective to move NG & Oil by rail (ie GMT is one
name). I have owned GMT for this reason. When I compared GMT's financials
against several of these pipeline companies, the pipeline companies seemed to
be a better value bet.

Also, many of these pipeline companies own very valuable "right of way
agreements" for their pipelines (both inter and intra state routes) that is an
intangible asset not reflected in their BV. I think these right-of-way
agreements are very valuable especially when pipe line capacities can easily be
increased but no new land owner access rights are being obtained (just look at
the trouble TransCanada Corp. (TRP) has had in building their pipeline).

I think the market has undervalued these pipeline companies which in the future
will be difficult to construct w/o new right-of-way agreements. It's almost
like those companies that own these agreements can control the distribution of
NG especially in those areas where all the new NG volume is being produced.

FWIW sold my GMT and looking to buy one or more of the discussed pipeline
companies.

re SEP , in my opinion SEP with a 5.8% yield is too expensive. i don't think
it's trading really at 26x EBITDA/EV though, but probably in the mid teens.

8X EBITDA is not a cutoff, its a good price for a pipeline asset (at least for
long life backbone pipes). The only pipeline stock that is reasonably valued
(although not cheap) is BWP with a 7.2% yield.

Although keep in mind that the large pipes are a regulated business (regulated
by FERC). They can make a decent but not great return and the yearly tariff
adjustments are indexed to inflation , plus a small bonus (up to 2% I
believe).The smaller pipes (gathering assets) are typically unregulated, have a
shorter lifespan and command hence lower multiples.

The problem with the Magic formula screen is that it only looks at backward
data by design. The underlying assumption is that companies that have shown a
good cash yield in the past, have a strong business and the stock will come
back (to get into the screen they have to get cheap first). 

I'm a big Magic Formula fan. I like the type of stocks it turns up, and I
utilize a variation of MF in one of my stock selection approaches (I put a
third leg into the approach that looks at various growth rates, but still very
much MF at it's core).

while some may view it as a problem, Greenblatt's backtests on the MF approach
have generated considerable alpha over time - I think around 5pp or so vs.
market. Also, I guess it depends on definition of cheap, but some of the
trendier names will make the MF list if other metrics are strong enough - for
example AAPL is currently a MF stock. For this reason I say AAPL looks cheap -
but others will disagree.

My results for Hornbeck seem to be satisfactory. Just perhaps because I bought
some shares 6/10 @ $14+ area because the Hornbeck sons were buying shares at
that time. The stock, now about $27-28, may still be undervalued: tangible book
value (per SI) about $32/sh, and there's apparently a slow recovery by the oil
companies in the GOM where Hornbeck has operated. However, with analysts'
saying (per Yahoo) that forward p/e might be 23, and at stock price now where
there's been insider sales, I decided I'll just cut back on my few HOS shares
for now. I continue to hold all shares of my small position in TDW.

Hi Paul -

Started a small position in Spectra Energy Partners, LP (SEP). Sold out of my
GATX Corp. (GMT) for a small profit. I booked a 10% gain on GMT which I
originally acquired 2/23/2011 but looking forward I was concerned with their
high amount of debt. I would like to eventually have exposure to the rail
sector either through UNP and/or CVS or again with GMT but at lower prices.

For now I think SEP is the best long term value of the group especially from
the defensive side and we slip back into a slow or no growth economy.

I am structuring the portfolio with a more defensive posture selling positions
that are vulnerable to a economic slow down and/or have a high amount of
leverage debt.

Aberdeen International update (AAB.TO, AABVF)

I pasted below a recent article with comments by COO. Here is the link:

http://www.miningweekly.com/article/sulliden-likely-on-a-gold-majors-shopping-l
st---aberdeen-coo-2011-07-06

Sulliden is back in the crapper (1.70 CAD), so I had wondered about lightening
my trading position in AAB.TO (0.85 CAD), looking for a better entry price if
the discount widens.

However, another thesis of mine is that management will create value over time,
and with "risk back on," I think I will just let things ride. Company is still
at a nice discount, buying back shares, and a dividend hike may be in the works
(shouldn't they disclose that to everyone by the way, not in an analyst
presentation?). That being said, I am not going to buy more at these levels.

MC

TORONTO (miningweekly.com) – TSX-listed Sulliden Gold, which owns a gold
deposit in the Peruvian Andes, would make a likely takeover target for
companies like gold giants Barrick and Newmont, which own mines nearby,
Aberdeen International COO David Stein said on Wednesday.

Aberdeen is an investment company that puts money into early stage mining
projects, and Sulliden is the firm’s largest position currently.

“I think this company will most likely be taken out,” Stein told investors and
analysts at a presentation.

“We’ve got the team to develop the mine here, but given its location right
between Barrick’s Lagunas Norte mine and Newmont’s Yannacocha mine, it’s in a
very strategic mining area.”

Lagunas Norte is Barrick’s lowest cost operation and produced 808 000 oz in
2010, while Yanacocha is the largest gold producer in Latin America.

South Africa’s Gold Fields also owns the Cerro Corona gold mine north east of
Yanacocha.

“Sulliden’s already over three-million ounces in resources, and they’ve got
quite a bit of potential at depth also,” Stein said, pointing out that
recoveries for the sulphide ores could be greatly increased through heap
leaching.

According to a presentation on Sulliden’s website, its Shahuindo project
contains around 3,3-million ounces of inferred and indicated resources, and
expects to conclude a feasibility study by September.

Production is planned for the first half of 2013.

Sulliden has a market value of around C$358-million.

MONGOLIAN COPPER/GOLD

Meanwhile, Stein said that Aberdeen aimed on floating a company called Temujin
later in 2011 or early next year. The company owns two porphyry deposits in
Mongolia that used to belong to Ivanhoe Mines, building the massive Oyu Tolgoi
mine in the country, which agreed to cede them to the government in 2009.

The initial public offering would be in the “ballpark” of $15-million to
$20-million, which would fund exploration expenditures for the next two years,
Stein said.

“It’s still early days there.”

SOUTH AFRICAN PLATINUM

Aberdeen is also busy putting together a portfolio of South African platinum
properties that it aims to list later this year, according to Stein.

“We’re still putting all the acquisitions together. Once we do, it’s something
that we would want to take public right away, as we would need significant
capital,” he said.

The company was busy buying two properties, one on the eastern limb of the
Bushveld Complex, and the other on the western.

The Bushveld Complex hosts around 80% of the world’s known platinum reserves.

UNDERVALUED

Aberdeen is buying back its own shares and plans to increase its dividend in a
bid to lift its share price.

Stein bemoaned the fact that the company’s share price, trading at C$0.84
apiece on Wednesday afternoon, was significantly lower than its investment
portfolio’s market value of C$1.37 a share as at the end of April.

The company is also considering selling two gold royalty streams it owns in
South African mines, worth some C$25-million, as it doesn’t believe its share
price is reflecting their value.

Stein said Aberdeen was also planning on hiking its dividned, but wouldn’t be
drawn on when and by how much.

TCLP. I am not going to like stepping up for shares, now, after I failed to buy
at lower prices when I first considered TCLP. I may just do it though.

A difficult time in the market. So many stocks like TCLP have now recovered
from recent lows. Otoh, many of these stocks are still below highs seen this
year. I have to wonder if the stocks will give up the gains from the past
couple of weeks, or will stocks continue upward to challenge the good times of
March/April? I don't mean to be a market timer, but if we are in a whipsaw
market, I tell myself I ought to wait for the next soon-to-be-seen downdraft
(profit-taking in TCLP) before I buy. That would be assuming TCLP does fall.

I see why you have been buying Corporate Office Properties Trust (OFC) lately.
It is one of only a few stocks (REITs) that I have noticed is selling below
it's 50 Day and 200 Day MA.

I have been socking more cash in my preferred basket ready to deploy on some of
these sectors we have been discussing.

It takes a lot of discipline to choose your entry points and sometimes you have
to let the market run it's course. I probably get 2-3 really attractive buying
opportunities in any one year that result in significant returns 18-24 months
down the road.

Perhaps now is the time to take as much time and effort to initiate sales as I
argue to myself the over valued case(s). Sometimes the best plans are to do
nothing.

===================================================================

FWIW, my E&P small Cap basket continues to move higher up over 4% from it's
deficit position late last month. There will be quite a few new well results in
September that could significantly increase the value of these companies.

ANTARES ENERGY LIMITED (AZZEF) is one you brought to my attention in December
2010. They continue to show excellent results on their Permian Basin leases (
http://www.gtp.com.au/antaresenergy/inewsfiles/2011%2007%2006%20Land%20Acquisit
on%20Update.pdf ).

AZZEF is up 24% since my buy in December 2010. I continue to expect good
things.

Here are my recent results of my E&P Small Cap Basket.

<u>July 2011 Top E&P Small Cap Basket results:</u> Up 4.29%
18 holdings in the basket: 7 positive/ 11 negative

LEI 6% 25.4%
AXAS 6% 10.3%
DBLE 6% 4.2%
AZZEF 3% 23.8%
</pre>

I am looking towards Q4 to see all the holdings in the basket profitable as no
one position is off more than 25% (except CFW but it's a 1% position).

VOG & PVA are my two dark horses w/ a large basket position (13% & 18%
respectively) that are still losers. PVA's last two wells in their Marcellus
Shale leases were marginal producers but on their Eagle Ford leases they
reported six new wells (June 14, 2010 -
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Penn-Virginia-Corporation-bw-764895488.html?x=0&.
=1 ) producing a total of 4,096 BOPD. Their 85% interest in these wells alone
adds about $4.60/share ($60K x 4,096BOPDx85%/44M shares). I am still optimistic
about PVA even though it is selling near it's 52wk low.

Therefore, it should be an exciting second half of the year.

re MLP - I don't own MLP's at this point. I think they are too expensive, or in
other words yields are too low to bother with them.

I do think they are a terrific vehicle for retires requiring income. the IV
MLPs board is a great place to learn about them. On big lesson I learned is
that the prices/ yields of MLP are strongly correlated with the yields of BBB
bonds. This is understandable, since bonds are an alternative investment to
MLP's and in addition most MLP's have a a BBB credit rating (or somewhat
below), so BBB is a good proxy for their cost of capital.

Given my dim view of the bond market, I don't think I want to own an investment
correlated with BBB bonds of infinite maturity, so I don't own MLP's at this
time. Once yields go past 8%, I am going to take a look at them again.

The MLP's in the portfolio represent at most 4% of my portfolio(s) and do

SO/VE. Okay, although I don't know why SO would be a less-followed utility
stock. The geezer dividend-hounds ought to be able to find and track this $34B,
26,000 employee company easy enough.

The only utility/utility-related stock that I'm willing to raise my bid for now
is Veolia Environnement S.A. (VE). So I'm in for a few more shares now. (Am
still interested too in more RWEOY.pk, but only if it will drop back down)

Regarding VE: In my opinion the company is primarily known for what Yahoo says:
"management and operation of drinking water plants, wastewater decontamination
and recycling plants, drinking water distribution networks, and wastewater
collection networks." Perhaps not so well known, VE is "the leading private
operator of public transportation in Europe", according to the company. In the
USA, among other things, they are the SuperShuttle people.
I've held shares in an ira since '09 and also in a taxable account since '10.
Not much progress in the stock price. Which is okay with me -- given VE's size
and breadth and businesses, I can't expect great gains from rapid appreciation
of the stock. Fwiw, if anybody reading this is contemplating buying the stock,
they ought to consider if they will hold long enough to get the annual
dividend. If so, that dividend is taxed differently (a higher (!!) tax is
withheld) if the stock's in a non-taxable account, than if it's in a taxable
account. For me, I'm adding shares in my taxable account.

Exco Chief Miller Is Said to Lower His Buyout Offer by 9.8% to $4 Billion
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-07/exco-chief-douglas-miller-is-said-to-l
wer-his-buyout-offer-to-4-billion.html?cmpid=yhoo

From the article:"...A revised offer submitted to the company last week is
valued at $18.50 a share, with a majority of the price in cash and the rest in
shares, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the
talks are private. Miller’s original bid, made in October, was for $20.50 a
share in cash, or about $4.4 billion...."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------

Originally bought this stock 9/2010 for $13.50/share as a value play to
$24.00/share. Sold out the position 2/24/2011 at $20.25/share. Stock selling
off today on 5 x avg volume to $16.60/share based on the news of the lower buy
out offer of $18.50/share. I may reconsider entering the trade with a tracking
position once all the weak hands have thrown in the towel.

Wilbur Ross and a few other value investors have been building large positions
at higher prices.

Maybe the original buy out group was having trouble getting financing for their
deal and their producing properties were originally valued too high (per the
recent NYT article) and their bank got cold feet.

This one becomes a special situation if it trades back into the $14.00/share -
$ 14.50/share territory.

XCO. Thanks for the update. If the stock goes out at $18.50 or equivalent,
it'll be a losing proposition for me. I'll continue to hold, because that would

Looks like deal is off - Not in the best interests of the shareholders.

Re: EXCO Resources Inc. (XCO)

From Briefing.com: 11:47AM Exco Resources terminates strategic review process;
special committee determined there were no proposals in the best interest of
the co/all shareholders (XCO) 15.89 -0.78 : After consultation with its
independent financial and legal advisors, the Special Committee determined that
its review of strategic alternatives, including its consideration of Mr.
Miller's proposals, has not resulted in any firm proposal or any other proposal
that the Special Committee determined was in the best interests of the co and
all of its shareholders. In addition to Mr. Miller's original proposal of
$20.50 per share in cash, on July 6, 2011, CEO and Chairman Miller submitted a
written proposal for a possible transaction in which he and certain indicated
financing sources (who collectively hold a significant minority percentage of
EXCO's outstanding common shares) would acquire by merger an ~81% interest in
EXCO's common equity at a stated purchase price of $18.50 per share, with each
EXCO shareholder receiving $13.52 per share (or ~73% of the purchase price) in
cash as well as equity in the post-transaction EXCO with a stated value of
$4.98 per share (or ~27% of the purchase price), subject to rights of election
and pro ration. As part of the financing for the proposed transaction, Mr.
Miller's proposal contemplated the issuance of $300 mln of perpetual
convertible preferred stock which, if not successfully issued, would result in
an adjustment to the cash and stock mix received by EXCO shareholders. Mr.
Miller indicated he believed he would likely be able to finance the transaction
but he did not provide any financing commitments, nor did his proposal outline
the terms by which his potential investors would govern EXCO and what rights
and protections would be offered to the remaining publicly held interest in
EXCO. "We conducted a thorough review of strategic alternatives available to
the co. As that process did not result in a transaction the Special Committee
determined is in the best interests of the co and all of its shareholders, the
Special Committee has decided to terminate the process."

I still believe there is significant value in the company especially if shares
can be had in the $14.00/share area. Perhaps another buyer will step up with a

Hi Grommit -

Re: Bunge Limited Bunge Limited (NYSE: BG) - dividend paid quarterly
Penn West Petroleum Ltd (NYSE: PWE) - dividend paid monthly
GSTpA 8.62% Pfd - dividend paid monthly

Peeled off a few shares of PWE and bought more BG w/ equivalent amounts of
GSTpA so I generate the same net dividend income stream.

PWE is a Oil & Gas company that yields 4.7%. BG an Ag stock that yields 1% and
GSTpA is a NG E&P preferred yielding 9.4%. The combination of BG & GSTpA should
provide a better capital gain opportunity than holding PWE.

This brings down my PWE holding From a Top Six position to a Top Nine position
in the taxable portfolio.

I am also looking at doing a similar pairing (ie lower yield high growth w/
high yield preferred) w/ Devon Energy Corporation (DVN).

CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR) is a good candidate for this strategy as well
when I look pairing the allocated money with DFTpA.

I also want these higher growth low yield candidates to have little or no
leverage LT debt and a low PE. Both BG and DVN fit this criteria to a tee.

I think both stocks could see $100/share in 18 months representing a potential
40% gain for BG and a 25% gain for DVN.

Hello Madharry,

I meant to respond to you before, but maybe there's something to be learned
between the two of us. It looks like you and I both did well over the 2008-2010
period compared to the indexes, but this year we're seriously underperforming.
I'm with you that I would need several up-days to get back to break-even, even
with the indexes up on the year.

I think that overall we share a decent amount of gold/silver stocks (I've owned
over 10% in GDXJ for over a year). I've had several small cap oil plays over
the last year, and I've dabbled in some chinese stocks. I also have some large
cap tech value plays.

My guess is that these combinations were doing well in 2010 and they're
bringing us down in 2011, as we're overweight in these areas compared to the
general indexes. Thoughts?

Thanks,

Sold TC yesterday?

Going the opposite direction of my inclination. TC will be a nice stock to be
holding in 3 years provided that gold is still over $900 then. But that is true
about many gold mining stocks, which is what TC is moving into. In the meantime
they continue to make money on their existing moly mine.

My main hesitation is that it will be awhile for the new mine to come on line
and the stock may be "dead money" until then. But I am likely to buy a stake in
2011 because I want to be in before the moving starts.

Another mining stock to watch is Mosquito, Canadian. MSQ.V. Massive mine with
moly and silver and copper and some rare earth metal deposits if they can ever
get it off the ground.

Mining stocks generally do not interest me, but now there appears to be some
value in them. Either gold, silver, and copper are bubble-priced now or some of
the mines are quite good values.

Most value managers are doing poorly in 2011, which is natural after couple
years of value outperformance. You can call it Ken Fisher's The Great
Humiliator, you can call it style shift, you can call it reversal to averages,
but it happens. The most rational explanation for this phenomenon is that by
the fact of outperformance the stocks you hold are not as cheap anymore, even
though you still think they are cheap. So other investors with different styles
pick something else and run with it and now you're underperforming. ;)

What can you do? You can:
1. continue holding for your stocks to be considered cheap again and outperform
again
2. shift sector(s)
3. sell the stocks and hold cash/bonds
4. change investing style while value is out of favor

I don't advise 4, although some people do it. I won't mention names, but some
people on SI do it. ;) Some of them even do it somewhat successfully. ;) It's
not easy. Your call though. ;)

3 is IMHO for specific conditions. Although some of the conditions (debt
ceiling games and Euro crisis) are set up for 3, it's tough to advise doing 3.
;) If we have a crash, you'd be a big winner though.

2 - this makes sense for some sectors
1 - this makes sense for some stocks/sectors too. :)

To look at your sectors in sequence:

- Gold/silver: huge run up. Yes, there are bullish (and bearish) arguments, but
stocks are not cheap (and even though you can't really value gold itself, it's
possibly not cheap either). IMHO, it's a candidate for sector shift, but if you
are gold/silver bull, you'd argue against it.
- Oil - huge run up. There are bullish and bearish arguments, but stocks are
mostly not cheap. Another candidate for sector shift, but if you're a peak oil
fan, you might continue holding.
- Chinese stocks - fraud crash. Mostly sell and move on unless you have the
big-non-RTO companies. I'd probably not shift from Chinese names that are out
of fraud zone, since IMHO most of Chinese stocks are cheap. So I'd rather be on
bull side even though bears are clamoring for RE bubble and hard landing.
- Cheap tech stocks - these have not run up. So I'd shift into the sector
rather than shifting out of it. But yeah, obviously there are bull/bear
arguments here as well. :)

It's also possible to find good/great stocks that are not sector dependent and
perform greatly even when sectors/value-style are out of fashion. Not easy to
do though. ;)

Hello Jurgis,

Thanks for your thoughts. I'm glad that other value managers are experiencing
under performance also. At least I feel like I'm tracking with someone. :)

To your other points, I have reached a little on some growth prospects (mostly
small cap biotechs), but those have done reasonably well compared to my value
stocks. I'm still sticking with a value focused portfolio and not trying to
switch styles too much.

With Gold, I won a lot of GDXJ, and I've tried to play this a little more
conservatively these days by writing covered calls each month on it and trying
to get 3-5% premiums on those calls. I feel better about doing this than just
being entirely long gold stocks as I agree about the valuations. But, I also
want to hold a decent chunk of gold with the fiscal environment we have.

I've trimmed my oil but I still own several plays. I'm not quite sure how to
play oil these days. On one hand, I want to be in oil companies as I see the
price of oil in general increasing over the next 2-3 years, but on the other
hand, these companies don't generate a ton of cash as they continue to invest
in future oil production to replace their older production.

I'm not putting any more money into Chinese stock plays. I've been a bit burned
on 3 now, not a big deal, but enough to teach me.

I'm putting a lot of my portfolio in tech stock values - mostly CSCO, HPQ, GLW,
RIMM and MSFT. I'm happy to put more into these as long as they don't bounce
much from here.

Going back to your #3, I tend to think that my best plays are made after a
serious stock market correction and that if I could find a closed-end fund that
paid 6-8% for me to wait for a correction (and then not fall with the
correction), I would put a good percentage of my portfolio into that and just
wait. But, I'm not sure if such an investment exists. Maybe I could get 6-8%
with preferred's, corporate bonds, or mortgages, but all of those crashed in
the last crash also. So, given the rate environment, I'm again just buying
these cheap tech stocks and hoping in a correction they wouldn't fall much
more.

Thanks for all of your thoughts...

To all;

I was looking at the refinery sector and I thought Sunoco (NYSE:SUN) is an
interesting play. Price of $42.86 (or $5.2b) of which cash is $12.22 (that has
grown from $240m to $1.5b in 3 years). The past 3 years the company has been
shedding affiliates and focusing its business - lastly spinning off their Coke
business (interesting fact is that they put the ex-GM CEO Fitz Henderson at the
helm of that division). The CEO, Lynn Elsenhans, is a former executive at Shell
and after listening to some of the investor calls and reading the annual
reports it seems that she is the right person to stream-line operations.

Interesting fact is that in '08 when the last bull run in the oil market
happened, the business had profits of $776m compared to last year's of $234m.

The hot stock this year in the sector has been Western Refining (NYSE:WNR) and
the top player is Valero (NYSE:VLO), which have returned 95% and 13%,
respectively. SUN is up 6% - that's price return only. Dividend of $0.15 was
reduced from $0.30 a couple of years back, but expect to raise it in the
future.

We've had a lot of discussions on energy here, so I thought a different play
might bring interesting discussions. Margins in this field are definitely not
as fat and it's also a cyclical business.

Not really.

Depends on what you mean by "Graham mold", but 100% real Graham net-nets are
very rare and Graham probably would not have liked even the ones that occur
like GRVY. If you mean
kinda-somewhat-Graham-since-he-mentioned-various-different-metrics-in-various-p
aces, then maybe.

E.g. if you take Chapter 5 from "Intelligent investor" and use the following
criteria:

1. Diversification: 10-30 stocks
2. Each company selected should be large, prominent, and conservatively
financed.
3. Each company should have a long record of continuous dividend payment.
(since 1950 :P)
4. Price limit at 25 times 7 year average earnings, 20 times last year's
earnings.

then there's tons of stocks that fall into this "mold". Including KO, PEP, JNJ,
and so on. I'm not sure Burry was buying based on this either. ;)

So you have to define what you mean by Graham mold. ;)

you get 37 results on Finviz:

http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=cap_midover,fa_curratio_o1.5,fa_pb_u2,f
_quickratio_o1.5,fa_roe_o10&ft=2

So I guess you can buy a set of companies satisfying these criteria. I own GLW,
RIMM, SNDK from the list.

This isn't my criteria, I just found it through a combination of what Graham
said on the web.

Mind sharing why you own those companies? I want to purchase GLW but I don't
see any synergies between its different segments. RIMM is dying don't you
think?

We can call them Graham's criteria, but you presented them, so I assumed they
are somehow relevant to you. As I said before, Graham said a lot of different
things in different contexts, so there's IMO no single set of criteria that can
be assigned to him and called his. :) IMO there's no point of talking about
some set unless the set is interesting to you. :) (Just FYI, when I talk about
Graham stock, I talk about net-net, not about one that conforms to your :P set
of Graham's principles)

I like GLW as a company, I like their products and their history. You may be
right that there is no big synergy across the company, but IMHO that's not a
big deal. In fact, most big companies have to have multiple product lines that
don't necessarily have synergies.

I won't argue for RIMM. It might be a sell/short here. I just said that I own
it, I did not say to buy it. :)

re GLW - i like GLW too but I think that the LCD marked is going through some
weakness and GLW may have room to fall. This is based on LPL and AUO results
(both companies fabricate panels, GLW does the LCD glass) as well as comments
from Best Buy .

FWIW, LCD glass is where the bulk of GLW's profits come from.

Refineries. Yes, agree. A cyclical business as you say. I caught a previous
cycle, but missed this one -- TSO, VLO, DK, ALON, WNR, etc. I suspect too late
be buying, but who knows. I'll pass. For me, for now, will only consider oil

I have an order in for more HES now.

For an oh-so-small tracking position, I'll take a few shares of Advance Auto

And with some areas saturated with auto parts places, maybe growth in future

most of my investments have not worked out so far this year. I dont think the
share performance is related to the company performance. the share performance
seems to be by a large captive to the fickleness of the risk on/risk off crowd.
so I am resolved to rolling with tides of popularity or lack thereoff, with
some diversificaton into dividend yielding stocks. I am pretty much trying to
counter the effect of us continuing to print more and more us dollars, which is
kind of what the french did until they werent able to do it anymore. so I still
think hard assets and global technology is the way to go. and if i can get
those hard assets at a big discount to nav so much the better.

Has anyone looked at this company? At first glance I wasn't too impressed, but
the cash flow excited me - the high depreciation rate masks the free cash flow.

there are many ways to own silver in your portfolio if you think silver is
going up long term.
i bought slw at much lower prices than this. however, if you want to have
silver in your portfolio long term i think this is one of the better ways to do
it. the ex ceo about 6 months ago stated that each share was like a call on 5
ounces of silver in the ground but we know what slw costs are to take it out of
the ground more or less $4. now these are shares that are highly liquid and are
tax advantage when compared to owning the metal itself, either physically or
through an etf. I can only imagine why mr. market thinks silver is going to be
range bound for the forseeable future but I dont see it that way, as usa europe
and japan will continue to roll the printing presses over the next decade.

however my purchase of silver in 2011 was in the from of three sets of 2010 atb
silver bullion coins. all purchased for $37-38 per ounce, and i had to sell off
some slw and axu at higher prices because it had become so large a chunk of my
portfolio, and there is always the possibility of silver dropping sharply in
the short term.

having said all this it would not surprise me if OSG or COWN outperformed SLW
over the next two years. which i why im a proponent of more diversification
now.

For a 234.92M company with 85M shares outstanding... and 2B in tangible assets
it seems like an interesting play...

Then you see almost 3B in debt and in the newspaper industry, I immediately
cross it off.

Cash flow has always been extraordinary in the newspaper and print company. In

elsewhere. There are better deals than this on the market.

Excellent points, definitely not a safe investment - I see your points.

IMO upside thesis is based on the facts that the cash flow is sufficient to
support the debt level and since equity approximates 10% of debt, then we have
a leverage situation on our hands, where increase in assets would increase
equity more than the debt.

On the other hand, you are right, that decrease in assets could be very
dangerous to the equity position.

NVMI is a small, maybe even a micro cap, and AMAT is a mega cap, and large caps
a re more on my radar. I like AMAT's almost 2.5% div. yield, that's a nice
cushion.
NVMI's financials seem vey sound at first glance.

By FN3 I meant footnote 3... Fair value per the Balance Sheet is $105,827,444
and per the table in Footnote 3 is $105,827,445 - as I said, I don't mean to be
picky about $1, but combined with my question about the reference to Note 4
(look at the Aguia Resources Ltd. performance shares reference) I question how
much time they spend on reviewing their own financials.

>>What are your criteria to short a company?<<

I don't short based on valuation only - i want a short term (negative of
course) catalyst. I also like companies with a lot of debt, since this will
generate "gravity" to the stock once it starts to fall.

But overall you are asking the wrong person, my shorts in aggregate have
probably lost me money. I do try to do more of it but regard it more of a
portfolio hedge (short something rather than sell long positions) rather than
be profitable on their own.

Shorting based on valuation alone does not work for me. After all, once
valuation does not matter for the longs, what prevents them to run it up to
even crazier levels ? - nothing!

of safety. It's good that management is vocal about the stock being
