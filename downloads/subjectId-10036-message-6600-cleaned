Internet stock speculation is a new paradigm that I have never seen in 35 years
of investing. It is VERY dangerous for us value investors.

Look at your AMZN shorts. You would have made a ton if you bought it instead of
shorting it the first time. You would have made another ton if you had gone
long when you covered at 104, instead of just covering. The guy on the street
was making those buys.

When money can be made this easily by people who know nothing, then money will
be sucked out of everything else, and especially smaller company stocks. A
correction of this phenomenon will require a slaughter of those folks and in my
opinion must occur before sanity can return to what is value and what is not.
That will NOT be fun for anyone when it happens.

Therefore, I conclude that no value stock should be bought merely because it is
cheap (no matter how cheap), unless there is a highly visible catalyst for it
attracting buying from the shrunken pool of
money available for investment in these stocks.

I hate to be so gloomy but I have been looking for an explanation of what is
going on and this is how I see it.

Ken,

The Yahoo board is the best on Timet, by far. There's a lot of detailed

investors like to think they know about the stock.

RTI is by some measures a cheaper way to play Timet.

Sorry to take so long to get back to you. Hope you went ahead and added to your
position in IDTC, as it is now at 23 7/8, 50% higher than when I first
introduced it to this board. To answer your questions:

I don't remember any secondaries being offered in the last couple of years. I
tried to look up info on shares outstanding and could not confirm that they
have doubled as you said. If they did, it may be because of an acquisition and
insider option exercises.

I have not read the bond covenant, so I do not know why they must buy them
back, but it appears almost certain that they do need to.

I suppose they could use cash on hand instead of bridge financing, but it would
deplete their cash levels to what they probably consider dangerously low
levels. I think it would bring them to under 60 million dollars, and remember
they are rapidly expanding their network and this requires infrastructure
investment. The company did spend 11.7 million on network expansion in just the
last 6 months.

There is some merit to the argument on the IDTC thread that there might be some
private deals that would replace an IPO. However, those who have argued that
the break off of Net2Phone will not be largely beneficial to shareholders are
ignoring these key facts: CEO Howard Jonas owns 1/3 of the common stock and is
not likely to take this VERY HOT internet company that he has sacrificed so
much for and put so much money and hard work into for YEARS now, and do
something with it that does not increase the value of his shares; Also Jonas
and Co. have a history of looking out for shareholder value and I do not expect
them to stop now.

Sorry I was not able to give complete answers. Happy Investing!

Jeffrey, I very much respect your opinion. And I agree with all my heart.

But my heart has never been a very good investor - hence the 24 points I gave
to AMZN investors. Still, there'll probably always be a part of my portfolio
that I reserve for actively betting against the tulips.

It probably won't be fun when the world crashes down. But I'm not going to
refuse to buy stocks that meet my criteria: a deep contrarian play of a
business I'd like to buy outright. So far this year, it's putting me ahead of
the Nasdaq in a tech-free manner, and it's really hard to give up something
that's working. Especially when everywhere I see people saying that my type of
strategy isn't working in this market. In fact, I'm working even harder to be
faithful to my strategy, and refine what's working, toss what's not.

Is it really true that when the internets crash the whole market will crash?
With how incredibly narrow this market is, can it be that it is representative
of a fragmented market that will rise and fall heterogeneously in ways that the
indices can never measure? After all, the indices certainly have not
represented the intelligent investor the last few years on the way up. Why will
they on the way down?

I don't know the answer to these questions, but for now I'm risking be one of

But, Paul, you didn't tell me about the other part of a diversification

Somewhat on the other hand, re: exit strategies, I second whoever said that if

valuation between small and large caps, I can't imagine that many small caps

1. APCC -- high growth, no debt, almost fairly valued but still a bargain.

2. CKR - I chatted with the company yesterday. They are guiding analysts to
1.75 for this year. (Some had gotten a little extreme, without passing their
numbers by the company, the company claims.) The company also claims that the
guidance is causing the downgrades. But that guidance is still 20% growth or
so. They say that all is wonderful.

things like "XXX high growth, cheap". If I don't know and really respect the

And I still have the bruises to prove it.

By the way, has anyone looked at BBC. I realize that 15x-16x consensus 99
earnings and the recent chargeoffs in 98 are not exactly a screaming
endorsement, but healthcare has some favorable demographics going for it and
distributors might be a less risky and cheaper way to enter it than drugs. My
problem is that I know less than zero about healthcare products, drugs, etc...

The company has been growing profits by both acquisition and internal growth.
If they can make the 20% (or even 15%) growth over the next few years that is
forecast, it looks quite appealing to me. This is a high quality company that
has been around for a long time. Narrow margins, but that is sort of typical
for this Co. Cardinal looks like the better Co. in the industry, but it's much
more expensive by way of comparison.

I spoke to the Company on Thursday and they were still comfortable with current
EPS estimates. To me it may have good near term and long term prospect and the
PE makes sense. I just have no clue about health care so its tough to form a
firm opinion on the estimates.

Grommit,

I've liked APCC in the past but honestly had taken it off my watchlist sometime
last year as it had gotten so pricey. What a crash it has had. The high 20s was
where I was looking at buying it a long time ago. I don't mean to speak for
anyone, but I doubt it meets the valuation criterion of most of the value
investors on this thread. This is probably more of a Buffett stock IMHO.

My primary concerns with buying APCC are

1) barrier to entry: The only barrier to entry I see is that APC UPS quality is
seen as superior by the vast majority of customers. I'm not sure why
competitiors can't make a UPS that is just as good though. It doesn't seem like
it should be that hard to do - but apparently is harder than it seems.

2) Slowing growth in PC sales. As PC sales growth stalls will APCC sales
slowdown too, or can APCC increase penetration to continue growth?

3) I've wanted a UPS for my home, but they're still a little bit too expensive
for my budget. I realize home users aren't the primary market, but when I see
something in the store I like and put it back on the shelf because of price it
impacts my decision on a stock.

Why wouldn't we be interested in a Buffett stock? I too was looking at APC in
the 20's a while ago (in fact, I'd bet it was brought up here at some point),
but it dropped off my watch list as it ran higher.

Second, if I'm not mistaken, APC is the product of choice for corporate america
and serious computer users because they wouldn't want to risk their
jobs/livelihoods on anything else. Isn't that a barrier to entry? Akin to
Gilette in razors?

Third, what is it in PC sales are slowing? I thought unit volumes are up but
ASP's are down so there's a net negative in dollars, not units produced. And
unit volumes are what drive USP sales, no?

Actually, when I see something I like in a store and like, but put it back in
the shelf, I think I need to make more money, not that I shouldn't invest in
the stock. Rather, I see a possible marker for a defensible margin edge.

Paul, a huge amount of their cash flow is getting chewed up by reversing
deferred tax accruals due to the cross-over in book vs. tax depreciation on

Mike,

Why wouldn't we be interested in a Buffett stock? 

I think some on the thread may be interested in Buffett stocks, but value
stocks as defined on this board seem to have tighter PE, P/Bk, P/S etc.
valuation criterion than APCC. A PE of 19, P/Bk of @4.5, and P/S of @3 is not
going to get much more than a glance from many value investors. I was saying
this in effort to possibly explain potential lack of interest in this company.

Second, if I'm not mistaken, APC is the product of choice for corporate america
and serious computer users because they wouldn't want to risk their
jobs/livelihoods on anything else.

Yes, you're right here. In the marketing material APC sends out they mention
reliability as the #1 quality customer's are looking for in a UPS, and
something like 90+% view APC as the most reliable product - hence the current
advantage. APC has a strong brand name advantage. I guess what I was trying to
express was that I couldn't understand why APC couldn't be challenged by
competitors on these grounds given the relatively high ROE APC enjoys.

Third, what is it in PC sales are slowing?

This is my own personal outlook. I've seen arguments for 20% unit growth for
many years and other arguments for possibly even flat unit growth year/year. I
guess I'm somewhere in between, but definitely in the "growth is slowing" camp.

 when I see something I like in a store and like, but put it back in the shelf,
I think I need to make more money

My wife thinks I should make more money too! <G>

In closing, I'm interested again in APCC at these valuations.

Buffett Stock ? Here is an additional lesson for us:

Buffett, in his last Ann Report recommended that all BRK shareholders read
Levitt's speech. (I posted this on “Buffettology”)

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=8746472

It is worth reading slowly. Buffett wouldn't often point to someone else's
wisdom, would he ?

We have to wait years until Levitt's eight points become effective.

In the meantime, we should not consider any stock where there are signs of
dishonest flim-flam, of "earnings management".

So, I would recommend that posts here mention whether they checked for
mysterious disappearance of equity (i.e. more than the dividends) - from where
the hits are usually taken - in the last 10 years or so. A little comment on
the honesty.

“Punish those who rely on deception” , Levitt said near the end. Well,
that applies to the big funds. We just do it our way - and will be
rewarded by the better choices we make.

different story and that is why they trade at higher valuations. I think this

Health Care --

I researched hospitals a month or so ago but never took the plunge. A couple
were tempting, but there was a lot of uncertainty with gummit medicare funding
and hospitals are said to be most at risk of Y2K (I think UHS was my favorite).
If not risk of a medical failure, certainly at risk to have earnings shaved due
to all the actions they are taking to reduce the risk (like reducing patients
at year end, and adding manual backup for most everything). Also -- no real
value plays.

Anyway. That's my conclusion.

For those desperate to get into drugs, BRL may fit the bill. But this may be
another company too fairly valued to fit this thread. Let me know. I like the
long term aspects with so many proprietary drugs coming off patent over the
next 5 years. Maybe this is a "buffet on drugs" stock. Around a 15 PE based on
$2.00 EPS for year end June 99.

Guys,

I bet a lot of you are like me in having your portfolios track NAESX (a index
fund designed to track the Russell 2000). Hope the hot link works to show
divergence from the S&P500.

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=NAESX&d=2ys

Seems to me that this index fund may be a good value now. When people say the
stock market is overvalued, they are not talking about the stocks I own. They
aren't overvalued, they just drop in price. : - {

>>When people say the stock market is overvalued, they are not talking about

I agree with you. Many of the smaller stocks have been in a bear market for
well over a year. I am seeing values that would ordinarily be very tempting to
me in a normal environment. My problem is this. I suspect that when the big
ones blow up, everyone is going down with the ship. My only solution is to
require a larger than normal margin of safety.

I suspect that this may not happen this time. I can see the internets blowing
up and others flourishing, especially small cap value.

I'm up about 16% this year with value stocks. And I put my entire IRA in
Deswell at 8 3/16. Not to brag, but I hate to see so much downer pessismn on
our chosen strategy. It can work. Just because I'm having some success now
doesn't mean I know what I'm talking about, but what seems to be working for me
at least is extreme contrarianism in the value stocks, rather than just buying

I have two ideas I am just itching to invest in right now that fit all my

can buy them at the same price. But I think I will get a much better

I guess since my boat is being floated by this rising tide for now, I'm just a
bit optimistic. But are you insinuating that I am doing something contrary to
value principles to get my returns this year? And if so, then why shouldn't it
continue, and still have some downside protection in the event of a meltdown?
(this is all rhetorical)

I think we should be clear that it will take a meltdown for the market to
change character. 20% corrections don't do it. Something needs to threaten the
mutual funds, threaten the public into withdrawing large sums all at once,
threaten them to stop rolling over 100% of their retirment into index funds. No
doubt about it - the average investor thinks of an S&P index fund as equivalent
to a money market in terms of safety. Having Easter in a cocktail party setting

>> but I am going to wait until the market breaks<<

Does anybody have Buy-Orders in, against a break ?

I have started to do that, GE at 75, FELE (Franklin Electric) at 48. Got to
work on some more.

If we really like a stock, we can determine at which price we would like to
add, then put it on Automatic Pilot.

It would also keep the number of issues down which one owns. Easier to keep
track, and Buffett says: 20 times at bat in a lifetime, is what one really
should follow...

I must admit, I still have cash lying around, from my house sale (after 28
years, a 10-banger if you don't count inflation)

One has to update the orders, from time to time. I forgot, had GE at 53 and it
broke to 69 in October.

Any thoughts ?

Strange way to invest for most people, I'd say. Putting in orders way ahead of
any break. Don't see why it's necessary.

You ordered GE at 53 for the Oct break. Still you looked at it going down but
didn't buy any scale down @75-69 range? But now your order is upped to 75. No
prob. if next break is Oct. style - sharp and return. But what if not? What if
GE does now get to 53 or lower. No one can tell the depth to which a market
break will go. Maybe 53 will have been a good guess.

And then what if it stays there? If the break is like '72(??) when it went on
forever - and there were bargains everywhere, but you 'knew' there'd be even
better and more the next day. I'd guess for a person like yourself-- you've
seen it before and can deal with such (again). But for people who've not lived
through it-- takes tons of guts IMO to hang in if/when these breaks occur,
especially if they are very quick and sharp, and especially if there is no
quick rebound. Very easy to be confident about putting in an order now 25
points below current. Very not so easy to live with that decision if it gets
executed. JMO---

Strange way to invest ?- maybe...

First, that GE order at 53 was placed 3 ? years ago, I just had not revised it.
Should pay more attention.

Secondly, I am travelling some, may not be, and may not feel like, watching the
market ALL the time. Would feel lousy if I found out afterwards what I missed !
Like October. The ‘98 and ‘87 breaks were very short, easy to miss. Gosh, in
October so many came down 45 % from their High !! Briefly.

Thirdly, I would only pick the creme -de-la-creme of my stocks, not the ones I
actually should get rid of or the so-so's. Besides, I have to reckon with the
possibility of the market breaking big-time and there has to be enough money in
the account to execute all the orders, possibly on the same day.

You know as well as I do: you can never tell when the break ends ! You fret on
the way down and then you say: Shucks I missed it - unless you are very lucky.
Admit it !

So, why not pre-determine at what price you would like to own more of your
favorite stock ? Isn't it hard enough to FIND good value ?? Why are having this
BB, pray tell !

Suppose it reaches that price and then turn around. You would be happy, right ?

So what if it goes lower ? If you still have cash, buy more. If not, go over
the dogs and get rid of them. I have those. Don't you ? A welcome event, to be
forced by an irresistible opportunity.

I have done well with this sort of thinking. I don't think it takes a lot of
guts. Just Reality thinking an a little Comman Sense and patience.

Only partly a propos: I used to watch my college trust on Saturday morning,
putting the Friday close into a spreadsheet and have it spit out how many years
were unfunded, of the 20 years I had promised 5 kids.

Finally, zero years unfunded. OK. Joy. But soon I was down two years again.
Shucks. So, the next time the fund reached it's goal, I got brave and wrote a
letter to my broker listing all the stocks, number of shares and set a price,
in each case: Friday's close + 15 %. I was lucky, it took 6 or 7 month, but it
all was sold, on Automatic Pilot. Mail comes from the broker, reporting
execution. As planned. Money left over, in the end. Paid for half of Stanford
Med School of the last, lucky kid..

Why is it so difficult - for a Value Investor ! - to determine the value at
which you want to BUY or SELL ???

Would you agree with Buffett that you can't really time the market ?

What if it stays down ? I am a hardy one ! If I am convinced the company is
terrific, I stick it out. Mind you, sometimes out of laziness. Take Magna Intl,
an auto parts maker. Won't bore you, why terrific. Bought it before the ‘87
break (but ‘87 Hi=33), 1 000 at $18. went to $ 2 !! Too lazy to buy on way up.
Was 110, now 85. Still 15 % p.a plus Dividends. Yeah, another Buy-order
candidate. @ $ 60. Patience.

It is fun to debate this kind of question .. Tell me if I convinced you, a
little. If not at all, we just have different styles. I have coined various
sayings, one being:

“There are 17 ways to be successful” ........... (17 = many)

Walter in HK

PS Can you believe I have become a Momentum Investor ! Bought 10 000 of LCA
Vision LCAV at $ 4 and in two days it's $ 5. But I did a lot of studying to
find out why momentum exists, almost like an Internet stock. In short hand:
Laser Vision Correction is booming with the Boomers because word-of-mouth
advertising has reached a critical mass. The Centers are going past the
break-even point. Tons of gravy on the second 100 procedures per month, once
the Overhead is absorbed by the first 100. Capacity : 600 / month. VISX gets $
250 per eye. 580 lasers in the US , 70 % VISX. The arithmetic is staggering.

Do you think that is worth a separate post here ?

Strange ways .. - more

Just read a post on the SI SUNW thread, a guy listening to companysleuth.com
and a bunch of broker reports. I never pay much attention, I think one should
form one's own judgement. Sometimes there are tidbits there, but that's all.

As a result, I must admit though, I usually buy too early. Typical case I can
think of, when things weren't picked over as they are now. There was the old US
Filter, I tripped across, reading Value Line. $ 27 cash per share, profits
going up 15 % each year for the last 5 years.

Cost ? $ 16 1/2. Cash at a discount !! Greedy me, put in an order for 500 at $
15, saying to myself: Buy more at 12. Missed that, bought another 500 at $
11.50. Was low on cash. So, my average was $ 13 1/4. Bought cash for 50 cents
on the dollar.

Well, at $ 27 Value Line comes around and recommends it as a Special !!

7 Months after I bought it, Ashland Oil offers $ 33 to all, takes it over.

I found out afterwards why it was cheap: The Chairman wanted to do an LBO,
wasn't touting it on Wall Street. Wall Street is basically a herd. Use your own
head.

So, you see, I read the basic information, I make my own price and I don't
listen to the guys that basically sell entertainment. If they knew anything,
they would be sunning themselves on their Yacht on the Riviera. Here a sample
from the SI SUNW post:

>> ..been touting SUNW for many months
.......and have consistently maintained "strong buy" recommendations and
.......have ROUTINELY REVISED their targets upwards<< etc etc etc Well, either
you buy or you don't.

So, what's so strange about determining the value yourself and acting upon it ?

Hi Walter in HK.

I've always said an investor has to determine whether he/she is the kind of
person who will average down or will average up (or will just hold) for the
stocks in which a position is undertaken, especially a core position. Averaging
down, as market drops -- I see nothing wrong with that. But for core stocks
(ala GE), putting in orders currrently 75% of market value is strange to me. If
market drops to that extent, and so rapidily (where I feel I have to put such
an order in now so as to be able to pick up the stock), I'd rather just be at
the phone or computer. I'd like to think I'd just cut my vacation short and get
right back to the screen.

Secondly, one either has to have the money set aside now for the buy
(uninvested money), or else one has to sell something to pay for the buy (GE).
That would mean an emergent, and forced decision (have to sell the dogs of the
portfolio.) That in turns means one must be able to identify the dogs, and in a
market break, when almost all stocks decline, they all look like dogs. Very
difficult, imo, to id. which stocks are least likely to recover. If co. were an
actual dog, perhaps it should be kicked out of portfolio BEFORE the market
break.

As you say, many ways - 17 to invest. Your method requires patience - trait of
value investor. And you have been patient in some stocks for more than a
decade. Not so many posters here, imo, have been so tested this way and come
through it so well. Certainly not me -g-.

Please post on VSIX, LCAV. I know VSIX's been a big winner for you. We can
learn something from your experience. Might be some interest in the stock too,

Mike,

>>My problem is this. I suspect that when the big ones blow up, everyone is
going down with the ship.<<

>I suspect that this may not happen this time. I can see the internets blowing
up and others flourishing, especially small cap value. <

Here's the way I see. Keep in mind this is not a judgment about what to do,
it's just a view based on my observation of what has happened in the past.

I'm finding a lot of interesting prices among smaller cap companies that I do
not know very well. I suspect that if we compare investment results between
that category and the big blue chips and internets, the little guys will
outperform significantly over say the next 10 years. So from a valuation and
long term perspective I am totally in your camp.

But I have the view that many pockets of blue chips are very overvalued and the
internets are really interNUTS!

I also have the view that that if the overvaluation among the premier S&P500
stocks gets corrected violently, all ships are going to sink because I think it
will cause some problems in psychology, the economy, and perhaps even some
panic selling etc... This market appears to be very leveraged.

If however, the excesses get corrected by time and the values catch up to the
prices, I think a portfolio of small caps will do great without interruption.

For me it's a matter of:

1. Do I want to commit money to companies I do not know very well when they
might get "really" cheap within a year or two.

2. Do I want to risk not having any ammunition when the big guys that I really
love get attractive again.

I do not have this issue resolved in my mind yet so I am nibbling on positions
that I like but don't love while keeping a loaded bazooka just in case.

Maybe there is no correction needed...

Good post, Wayne.

Let me paraphrase the options and add a few:
1. Prices correcting (your violent correction)
2. Earnings catching up to valuations over time (your 'over time' correction)

3. There could be a combination of the 2, of course.

4. However, a continuation of the overvaluation is also quite possible, and
perhaps the most likely. For example, if GE earnings continue to grow at 14%
and the price goes up by the same amount -- everyone is happy. The PE stays at
50. (Or maybe a mixture here also -- stock up 10% for a few years and PE eases
a bit. Investors still happy.)

As far as a violent correction. I think a large percentage correction would
take some months to play out. And with that amount of time, and with the FED
taking actions to ease overreaction, there will be no major correction.

The risk of major correction was higher earlier with the international
situation dark. But the risks of the minute being more controllable (inflation
and interest rates, well, at least interest rates are more controllable) have
lessened the risk of major correction.

I agree with you on this and hope you are right.

>>4. However, a continuation of the overvaluation is also quite possible, and

To be honest I hope you are wrong. I would like to buy great American
corporations at a price that makes some sense - and soon.

Somehow I suspect that there are inter-relationships between stock prices and
economic activity that are self correcting (cost of capital and return on
capital) and/or extremely high stock prices without offsetting consequences are
a sign of much too easy credit that will eventually spill over. This is a very
long and theoretical discussion though, and probably belongs in another thread.

>> And with that amount of time, and with the FED taking actions to

I don't want to get into too controversial an area (especially when I hold such
a minority view) but I think the Fed's reputation and AG in particular is not

then we'll let history judge this Fed and AG.

I haven't contributed much to this board, but I sure have taken a lot, so I
figured that I would try to throw something out there when I finally come
across one. The reason I came across this stock is because I work in the field
of Radiation Oncology in which they now solely participate. Now, I'm sure
someone will find fault with some of my research, but hey, that's what everyone
is here for. First of all I'll let everyone know that this is health care
equipment company. Capital equipment. But let me get to the valuation before
you move next to the next post.

The company is Varian Medical (VAR). Just this week split from the parent
company which split into three separate companies. Varian Medical kept the
stock symbol, so it is misleading to look at the charts with that symbol. This
company produces Linear Accelerators and the associated peripherals such as
Simulators, Mulit-leaf collimators, brachytherapy equipment, and information
systems. They ARE the market leader in the field. I would conservatively
estimate that they own 70% of the market. The main competitor is the medical
division of Siemens. Siemens has just in the last three years begin reselling
Linacs due to FDA shutting them down for approximately two years. During this
period, Varian owned the market. The only other competitor is Electa (bought
Linac division from systems) and they have very few machines in the USA.

Now these machines on the average cost around 1 mil+ and on the average last
approximately 10-15 years before replacement. The barrier to entry to this
field is tremendous. Varian is the original producer of these machines. Now, I
know your thinking that in today's reimbursement arena, hospitals are not going
to purchase 1 mil machines, wrong. Remember Radiation Oncology is 95%
outpatient where the reimbursement is still decent and when you treat 30
patients a day on one of these machines at 300 a pop it begins to add up. And,
you got to have one to be in the business. Another benefit is the that these
machines have to be serviced often. Guess who provide the service. Yep, Varian.
And the contracts aren't cheap. Parts neither. Anyway the post is getting long
so let me get to the valuation. Here goes

Current Price 16 5/8

Price/Book (mrq) 0.90
Price/Earnings (ttm) 9.84
Price/Sales (ttm) 0.37

Book Value (mrq) $18.59
Earnings (ttm) $1.70
Sales (ttm) $45.10
Cash (mrq) $4.40

After-Tax Income (ttm) $51.7M
Sales (ttm) $1.36B

Profit Margin (ttm) 3.8%

Long-Term Debt/Equity (mrq) 0.19
Total Cash (mrq) $131.5M

Market Capitalization $502.2M
Shares Outstanding 30.0M
Float 18.6M

One other drawback to this company having split from the others it may become
unpredictable for earnings predictions due to the large cost of Linacs and when
they hit the books. One quarter could be huge and one not. What do you think?
Do the numbers look worthy of discussion?

Great post TwoBear. Being in the medical field myself, so close to Varian, and
having my mom worked at Varian for quite a while, I've been watching it and
thinking, too. My biggest fear is that it is capital equipment prone to
cyclicality. But on reflection (after your post -before, I hadn't thought too
deeply on it) I can see the demographics actually favor VAR. I'll keep looking.

I like this part best:

Dear Paul, I did post a little on LCAV

>>Why sell at 10 ? You love the IRS ?<< and such.

The LCAV closed Friday at 6 15/32 and I bought it Tuesday for 4-even. Must have
sensed the Momentum right. I must admit I had a sell order in at 7 7/8 because
my goal was to earn the money in stocks for the “Cabin” I have to build at my
Cottage on a Lake in Canada. (Now 3 married kids, 5 grandchildren) I have the
money but the cottage itself was bought from stock gains, mostly Nowsco Well
Service (Calgary) The sailboat Union Carbide options after Bhopal. So, why not
the “Cabin”?

At 7 7/8 I could have paid my US taxes, built the “Cabin” and have some left
over with the interest of which to pay for the higher RE taxes and insurance.
You see all expenses are planned, budgeted, never in hot water.

But when LCAV hit 7 during Friday I got on the phone to Florida and cancelled
the order. Let it ride. It's been a great ride. 10 Grand one night, 14 last
night. Mind you, on paper, so far.

Iteresting lesson, though, from this first foray into Momentum: Takes just as
much DD, maybe even more. And can I do it on Sun Microsystems ? I am an EE but
have no idea who will win the battle of whatever standard. Basically I stay in
SUNW because I saw Scott McNealy being questioned once as to how good he is in
Strategy. His answer: You just wait and see. He was extremely confident,
convincingly to me and I have terrific BS detectors.

So, in this instance, it boils down to a gut feeling. Which have their place. I
once had lunch with an officer of Magna Intl, an Austrian Toolmaker (like
Stronach, the founder) and he told me TESMA (a sub of Magna with public stock)
is good, it can grow better than Magna, still being small compared to Magna.

Well, I was going to look at the financials and dig out what I could. The stock
was at 12. MY first father in law, then 92, went and bought it. Three days
later, in the paper: Stronach got 300 000 options of TESMA. Too late. Went to
18.

Ha ! My father-in-law had bought it, saying “If this friend tells you it is
good, he is doing you a favor” Just on the gut feeling, rode 12 to 18.

Going back to bed, just wanted to check how LCAV closed the day. Will consider
VISX options on a pull back. Haven't done Options in Years. Anybody
knowledgeable on Value Board ? This almost feels more like Art of Investing,
but it's pretty dead there

TwoBear,

It doesn't look to me like you've adjusted your numbers to take into account
the spin offs of VESA (semi equip) and VARI (instruments). Or maybe my numbers
are wrong. You're talking about the surviving corp. (VAR - a.k.a Varian
Associates, a.k.a Varian Medical Systems). Pro forma (from their 8K), they have
about $540m in sales, $29m? in cash, $152m in equity, $1.27 EPS. Still not
unreasonable. I'd be interested in a longer term outlook for growth (future and
historical) - just eyeballing 3yrs: high single digit growth in rev. and
mid-teen growth in EPS. Operating margins seem to be mixed too (again only
3yrs) - any input? competition?.

Re: VAR
The numbers look like something that could be cheap, but the business is what's
worthy of discussion. Also the fact that it is a spinoff makes me want to look
at it.

First impression. What jumps out at me in a big way is this (and I have done
nothing on the stock but read your excellent post). These guys dominate their
market. I just posted something two days ago about what I think of medical
equipment "franchises" which begs the question: HOW LONG ARE PRODUCT CYCLES IN
THIS BUSINESS? If the franchise is as strong as you say it is - and it
certainly appears you've done your homework - why are they only making 10% on
equity? And why are profit margins so low? This sounds like the kind of
business that should be minting money. Is there some reason to believe that
earnings are depressed or that they are going to ramp up in the near future?
How long are product cycles? What does a 10 year history of earnings look like?
Have there been recent entrants into the business. Are return on capital and
margins going up or going down.

A lot of questions, but those are the numbers I would focus on first. I would
love to interview the management of this company.

Once again, great post. That's the kind of thing that makes me download a
prospectus and start reading it. And the kind of thing that makes this thread a
good use of my time. IF this is a good idea, I would expect to hear it from my
Wall Street sales buddies in about 6 months up 50%.

Thank you. Boy!! Is IDTC flying or what? Against my gut instinct I sold 1/2 my
IDTC position today at 30 1/4. It was against my gut because I really think
IDTC stock is going to have a lot of upward pressure on it still until the
details of the IPO/spin off are fully disclosed. Depending on what they
announce it may soar even more after that. The ONLY reason I sold was because
of my strategy. My average price was 15 1/8, and so I always sell 1/2 my
position when I have doubled my money. I am looking to buy them back somewhere
between 22 and 26. Absent news on monday we should see the beginnings of at
least some kind of corrective pull back. The only thing besides news that would
prevent this would be for the internet frenzied investors to really start
hitting this stock. I think we already have quite a few of them buying it now,

In your experience is medical capital equipment different by nature than say ag

You point out something that our tech analyst is always saying too. If you're
going to do cyclicals and avoid getting burned, you want to look at the
underlying growth rate. Is each cycle higher than the previous one? With
medical device cyclicals, you might have a shot at those economics. That makes
the question of barriers to entry that much more important though, because you
have to make sure your horse doesn't get lapped in the next product cycle.
That's the problem with a lot of the technology capital equipment stocks. You
don't have that problem with a Caterpillar or Deere.

And I don't know if there is anything that makes $1 million machines stop
selling in a cyclical fashion.

This gets more subtle, but the type of machines made by Varian don't have very
quick technology cycles, and Varian is fairly dominant enough,with enough
capital expense/barrier to entry, to control that to an extent. As the
population ages, there will be more demand for these machines. What would cause
a slump in demand? I would think it would be rather steady slow growth, with a
long life to each product cycle. Maybe like the steadiness IBM exhibited in its
mainframe heyday, except slower growth.

Hi Walter in HK. Well, your posts are most interesting to me. Especially as I
had looked at some of the stocks you've had good success with.

UC was the stock miss of the year for me after Biophal. My recollection was all
analysts were negative. Bankruptcy was talked about (media). But I figured even
if 10,000 people died and UC had to pay off the families or gov't... amt. would
not be enough to wipe out UC at then current price. Shouda, coulda, but didnt
buy. No courage of convictions.

SUNW. I'm still selling down my position. Buyer since '95. On the SUNW SI
thread, poster was putting his kids through college by trading ups/downs. Very
successful seems. I've tried it too. Profitable, but not risking enough to make
it worthwhile. For me, at some point, too risky to just have faith and believe
that Scott Mc will bring co. to even higher level. PE so high, technology
changes too fast, other things beckon.

VISX: WOW! WOW! Some move there in past few months on this favorite of yours.

I looked at, and missed (sigh) Magna years ago when it was lower. I have always
found it odd - (and thus difficult to invest) - that some supplier companies
have higher pe's (evaluations)than their customers. Magma vs. BigThree; now
also FLEX, others vs. HP/Oracle others. And sorry for me to say, but it's
always been the wrong way to look at these supplier companies.
Walter, in the same vein as Magna,I'm looking at Meritor (MRA)- Do you follow
it?

Paul (LVC) and Tx for compliments
Of course, the human memory is benign and one tends to forget the bum choices.

In retirement I find it most satisfying that one remembers the heroic
accomplishments achieved from time to time . One generally knows there were
worries, but somehow the memory of the worries and of the crises recedes. Nice
of memory to do that.

I will take a look at FLEX and MRA which latter I did not find in Value Line. I
still find VL a very efficient way to scan. Also to get background quicker than
on the Internet.

What criteria do you use for screening ? I think I told you, since 1973 I use
Low P/E with a high rate of profit growth. Often simply : The P/E number must
be substantially smaller than ROE average % number over 10 years. There ain't
many.

That turned up a few in 1973, the five best of which I bought. 3 did very well
and Teledyne turned out to be a 40-banger. Four years of MIT cost me $ 1600.

I also learned at that time: You Can Not Loose more than you put in, but there
is no limit on the upside. So, it pays to put work into the picking.

Some guy on Yahoo BEAM blasted me for being boring and I told him Click on
“Next” but two came to my defense, one saying “you can bore me anytime”.

Well, I will learn how to behave on these here boards, maybe pontificate less,
except on Value Investing and Buffettology.

By Monday I have to decide in which form to put more money into that freight
train, Laser Vision Correction. Too bad, way-out Options only exist after the
stock has been up there. These stocks never have. What to do ?

In the LVC business Word-of-Mouth advertising has reached a critical mass and
now TV is starting to cover it. This week an Am Soc of Cataract and Refractory
Surgeons is meeting in Seattle. www.ascrs.org Check Track L !

I found out that there are 580 lasers in the US, each with a capacity of 600
procedures. Humans have two eyes, 15 appointments a day, a month booked in
advance. Wolfie's Ophtho did 530 in February.

Now, do your math. $ 250 / procedure. VISX 30 million shares, 75 % market,
Summit (BEAM) the rest. That's why they behave the way they do.

The Centers, LCAV LVCI LZRC have 120, 120 and 175 procedures per month and
laser, roughly. LCAV had 90 in the previous quarter, hired a new marketing guy
(Ex LensCrafters, Am Home Pr) in 9/98. Market Cap / # Centers is lowest at
LCAV.

A center breaks even at 100 procedures a month, I read. Go figure the next 100.
Each $ 2500 less 300 for the Ophtho, 250 for VISX and less the tax on income.
Multiply by 12.

So, I finally took the plunge Tuesday April 6, at $ 4 for LCAV, after deciding
not to put equal money into all 3. Decided for pick, not spread.

Fri closing: 6 ..15/32 ....up 61 %. ...Unrealized, mind you. Beat all the
others, for those 3 days anyway.

So, you can see why I am thinking of plunging more. The risk is patent suits,
but that will be a while, while the freight train continues.

Never been a Momentum Investor in my life. But something is going on here, I am
convinced. So, I am letting you guys here know about this heretic thought and
action of mine. Hope you will not excommunicate me.

W. in HK: re: LCAV. Will need more help in figuring this one. I see 9000
procedures in 1st Q. That's 3000 per mo @ $2500 less 250 for VISX and less $300
for the Doc = $5.85M rev per mo or $70M per year. (assumes no sequential growth
of which there will be lots apparently). So revs are doubling over 1998 ($35M)
which, in turn, was a double over 1997. But how much of that rev will be
carried to bottom line? I can't figure it. Made no money on $35M last year. If
make money on
all above $35M (=$35M) how much (analyst est. = .1? or $4.1M on 41m sh.
out.???) Or maybe they're running the business for expansion, not for
profits??? Maybe the investment is based on hot topic momentum. Maybe okay too.

Walter in HK: some screening criteria I use:

I like p/bv and ROE and low pe. All situational.

If ROE is measure of management effectiveness, should be fairly stable (and
ideally high) over time. If fluctuates a lot, I get nervous (like the a
posteriori changing of bv by accounting adjustments, as you've mentioned)

For manufacturing companies, I like to compare p/bv to ROE to bv. Thus, for a
company like ESL, bv=11, ROE of 16%, but p/bv only =1.09. "Fair value" might be
somewhere around 1.6xbv. Potential buy. More sophisticated analysis to adjust
for cost of capital. Also check for insider buys/sells.

For insurance companies: High ROE is a negative! Too competitive a business to
have high ROEs usually- co. could be underpricing/mispricing its business. I'll
take steady increases in book value and price below book value. Consider also
debt level. This week I added to my positions in SKP and NWLIA -- both
companies meeting this criteria (although there's not really enough history for
SKP)

Also relative dividend yield. Dividend yield relative to its past dividend and
relative to the S&P yield. More mechanical method. Owning in this way: JPM,
JCP, WHR, others.

And also use some screens for historical data (when I can find it) for years of
continuous earnings increases, div. increases, rev. increases, etc.

OT: Personally, I think investing in MO and Loews is more ethical
and socially responsible than investing in Laser Vision. There is a small
percentage of patients for whom Excimer is warranted, but on the whole, as a
physician, I abhor the commercialization of the procedure, and feel it is the
worst form of hypocrisy on the part of the ophthalmologists who perform it. I
am sure the stock will do well, but only because of an eager, unknowing patient
base, and financially-motivated physicians who will use asymmetric information
to foist their services on the public.

This opinion steps on some very big toes both in the public and in medical
circles,where power follows money. And I don't want to make this thread the
theater for this particular debate.

From:Walter in HK

(OT) Mike, I hear you and I respect what you say, especially since you are a
physician. Let me try and sort that out, see what you say.

First - not on this thread ! Right. Would be a wasteful theater.

Second - I did buy MO about 5 years ago, saying to myself: a financial
decision. Now I am married again (my first wife died if colon cancer, 9 years
later in the liver) and said: OK I won't buy more. But even as a financial
decision I want to get rid of it at $45. Then my conscience can also be clean.
I am a practical guy 8-)

Third - Laser Vision Correction. I would disregard financial motivation of the
Ophthos. Looking at it in absolute terms, I did at first feel uncomfortable. If
it is not necessary, why take a risk? I myself have a birth defect behind the
lens of one eye - read only headlines with that eye. Would never risk the
other. But most people apparently have both eyes done at the same time.

Including my middle child of five, a twin daughter, still playing ice hockey
(she was the Captain of the MIT Women's Hockey Team) and not wanting to loose
her contacts on the ice. OK, at least not a plain vanity motive.

The freight train coming down the track of this “Industry”, I think is powered
by that Boomer thinking. I would not reason the way they apparently do. I know
a lot of people are vain and do all sorts of things. I had a big-time boss. He
has contacts, and being short, had special shoes in which he stood higher but
they showed no high heels ! I once sat beside a plastic surgeon on a plane, he
told me far more men have plastic surgery than women.

So, there is a lot going on behind the scenes. And it has pushed LVC. It is
surprising. However, now that so many procedures have been done, apparently
over 400 000 in 1998, I would think the track record must be improving, fewer
bad outcomes. Are they minimal ? I have no idea. To the affected individual,
never. Not everybody can, by definition, pick the Ophtho wo does 100 a week.
There is, anyway, the “eager, unknowing patient base” as you say.

Everything is a trade-off. I think, in the end, there will be more and more
changes to the human body. Before long, they will fix the gene that predisposes
you to cancer of the colon. Whatever is done, may involve some risk.

Probably people are used to all technical things becoming more reliable. At one
time we ground valves on cars. Countless examples, especially when you consider
the greater complexity of today's products. My first job was in radio tube
production. They had a life of 500 hours. A million transistors on a chip -
forever.

So, is this trend responsible for the thinking of those who have LASIK done ?

Another daughter's husband talked her into not having it done. He has a little
company that sells parts for humans - like a glaucoma valve. He says long-term
effects are not yet known. I looked into that a little. The Bowman layer does
not regenerate. Is it not needed after you have grown up, like the clavicle?
Why did evolution put it there ? I never got an answer whether that drives
LASIK where Bowman is preserved.

This whole LVC grew out of laser surgery. I happen to have met Dr.L'Esperance
on New Year's 1995. He explained that , 20 years earlier, he was the first to
apply lasers to humans. Then he found this laser that has 6.2 electron Volts of
energy per photon and that it takes 5.9 eV to disassociate a lens molecule. (or
some such numbers)

Well, that is some invention. Now, what do you do with that ? Imagine we don't
know what was to happen. I would think of the military. No glasses nor
contacts.

No use doing thought experiments. My gut says we will see more technology
fixing bodies. Where do you draw the line ? At ice hockey or at plain vanity ?

I don't know, but I don't see it in quite the same degree of irresponsibilty as
you do. The cure would be to stop it, to protect how many ? Right there is the
dilemma, I think. We fly airplanes. What is the rate compared to LVC ? Driving
a car ??

Yeah, I guess I narrowed it down. Just took too long.

Interested in your reaction, which can be short since I covered almost
everything 8-)

Let me know before Monday - the next decision.

Paul, Laser Vision Correction I did this exercise to get a handle what ONE
center could make if it is true that the first 100 procedures cover all OH,
i.e. are the break-even point. Out of the second 100 you can then, under the
assumptions made, make about $ 1.45 Million in that center, because you only
pay the Ophtho, VISX and the IRS.

I don't pay attention to earnings estimates. Just apply that to the number of
centers, better : Lasers, some cities have several.

All I am saying is, there is quite a potential in profits and the prices are
not as crazy as they look if you don't get into the economics. And one laser
can do 600 procedures a month. Yikes, VISX..

If you are interested, go to the SNRS thread because for some reason there are
two guys reporting from the ASCRS meeting the next seven days - provided they
get their modems going in the hotel.

Also go to www.ascrs.org and look at the number of papers in the field.

I wish I was an Ophtho at this point, for a month. One would really get a feel
of what is actually happening.. I have an Internist son (Stanford) but he is
working on building an artificial kidney at Mass General. You have to ask
Ophthos.

Never mind revenues etc. What counts, is, once they are over the break-even
they will make tons. Except startup cost will be a drag when you keep adding
centers quickly. I picked LCAV because they slowed down, having bitten off too
much, maybe not being organized well enough, or whatever.

Where exactly the break-even point lies is also not THAT important to know, as
long as the procedures per month go up substantially.

NOT the proper candidates here. Fine, destabilize the cornea and go run and
slam your head into something. There is no cure for a ruptured globe. Horrible

those trying to replace the income they lost when medicare cut reimbursements
for cataract surgery. These procedures and variations are NOT NEW. They have

on a mass scale, with new variations that have not been tested long-term.
Phen-Fen comes to mind.

I'm very sorry but this is something I feel very strongly about.
Everything is a trade-off. 

I just think it's sad because there's asymmetric information here. The patient
doesn't have the right information in the right context. And some physicians

I owned aati and did quite well with the company last year. Very good
management and reasonably priced with book of 13.5 and 170 million in revenue
last year. Because the company has so few shares outstanding the cost to aeon
is about 100 million. They have strong financing lined up and I would rate
probability of deal completion very high. Companies would like to close by end

it at 48 now. Just like I'm sure you were reluctant to pick up Timberland at 43
after reviewing it at 36. I can see SLOT doing a Timberland (now over 70), but
I'm waiting for that 36 again. On a whining note, Timberland's now my best
stock this year, and I didn't even put it in the ValueStocks.net portfolio ;( -
I'd be beating that Nasdaq yet if I had. BTW, I read an interesting statistic
that 2/3 of all Nasdaq stocks were down in the first Q.

RE: Nasdaq interesting week coming up perhaps we ain't seen nothing yet

with earnings coming out the box maker's are going to take a big hit monday
(IMHO). Compaq fessed up friday .. and if intel does not do well (tuesday after
the bell) ... hope the fire does not jump the river and spread to this other
bank.

NY Times ran front page financial page article on the over valuation of Lucent.

there is just too much money is chasing money in NASDAQ.

On the issue of product cycle, a linear accelerator is a linear accelerator.
They just add technological advances to the basics. First were 80 cm machines,
then 100 cm, then dual energy machines, then electrons, then the computerized,
then the multi-leaf collimator, now the portal vision. The beauty of it all is
once you have a basic accelerator you continue to upgrade it with the new
peripherals. For example, buy a Linac for 1 million, later add MLC for 300K,
next portal vision 250K, then Varis information system 300K. As you can see
once they are in the door there is a continuing upgrade revenue stream. To do
this, you have to have a C series accelerator. At the present I would guess
that 50% of the country is still using non-computerized linacs and will have to
upgrade to participate in the revolution of treatment in Radiation Therapy due
to this increased technology. In a nutshell, we are going to be able to
escalate doses without increasing morbidity therefore increasing cure rates.

Also don't forget that Varian produces a good portion of x-ray tubes for x-ray
machine manufacturers (different technology than linac). Was speaking to
Southeastern executive last month and he was telling me that Varian has
patented a tube that doesn't use oil in the tube for cooling. That is big as
far as x-ray tubes go. Just think how many x-ray tubes are out there. There is
almost one in EVERY doctors office and at least 20+ in every hospital.

On the issue of margins, I am not sure. But, I am curious if that figure of
3.8% is true to Varian Medical alone or is the figure of the parent company. I
will say that Siemens has been lowballing Varian every chance they get to gain
some market share, and this may be a result of that but, Siemens still has
inferior equipment in many eyes. I wouldn't compare it too Coke/Pepsi, but
maybe Coke and Sam's club brand.

Hi Walter. ah,uh..I don't know. They all look overvalued to me--because I can't
quantify '99 and '00 demand. BEAM, LCAV, LVCI,VISX, LZRC... so many. Maybe for
me- OHSI. Have to think some more about it. Paul

Mike, yes, SLOT looks okay to me too - even at current price. I don't like
paying up for it now either, but it should work out okay in a couple of years
(or sooner). I'm surprised that some of SLOT's performance numbers look better
than IGT's - I hadn't noticed that before.

So FWIW, I also started a very small position in SLOT today. Where was the
pullback on SLOT that I'm seeing on my other stocks that, like SLOT, have had
recent run-ups? (rhetorical wry grimace)

Paul, I'm just being overly technical, but this statement:

 For insurance companies: High ROE is a negative! Too competitive a business to
have high ROEs usually- co. could be underpricing/mispricing its business.

should probably be stated "co. could be under-reserving its business". That's
what gets them in real trouble in later years, especially in longer-tail
business, because they have to make up in one or two years reserve shortfalls
that they were making for years. (In a sense, they can get away with
underpricing, as long as they recognize that they're doing so.)

Always enjoy your insights.

On just about every measure but size, SLOT does look better than IGT, I agree.
Still, passed on SLOT today. This is too nitpicky, and tells me that maybe I'm
just making up reasons not to buy it, but the stock runs up 25% in advance of
good news in the legislature, and then when the news breaks, the stock does
nothing. If nothing else, this tells me that I don't know what moves this
stock, and even if I did, it would be too late.

I did go with a few moves though, reflecting an effort to improve my portfolio
management skills relative to my stockpicking. I'm not convinced they go hand
in hand.

I unloaded WHX and Loews. Since I'm a bottomfisher, I try to get my ducks in a
row before buying. When the market repeatedly tells me I'm wrong, well, at some
point I have to stop fighting it. I don't want to follow any stock into
bankruptcy, so I've set 25% fall without any new information or fundamental
realization as my breakpoint. And both these just cleared that threshold. My
sells (e.g. Case) have done pretty well though, so someone might want to buy
these or at least take a look. Why Loews is falling so much, I don't know. No
respect for asset plays, I guess.

I used the proceeds to upgrade the dividend yield on my port. Bought some UST
as a rough parallel/favorable tax switch to Loews, but with a stable dividend
above 6%. I like that UST has fallen so much in sympathy with Loews/MO/RN
despite the renewed dividend increases and share buyback. UST has much less
potential liability than the other tobaccos, and the CEO is looking for 10%
earnings growth this year. I also added some more MO.

The steel money, well I really wanted to put it back into steel. Ispat,
National Steel have looked like my two best ideas, but I couldn't pull the
trigger on either today. So I went to the REIT sector, toyed with Public
Storage then went with EastGroup (EGP). So the port of 20 stocks now yields
3.86%. Safety in a downturn, maybe. And now I'm out of steel.

Sbarro Update

I spoke to the company today. They are talking to the SEC, finalizing some
questions and issues. These final issues should be hammered out within days.
The voting should proceed in the weeks to follow, followed by a bond issue
assuming approval. The whole process should put the closing sometime in June
give or take.

PEAKF - $3.50/share: 1/3 of book value, 2.5x P/E, 1/3 of revenue for well
positioned semiconductor cap. equipment stock.

Have had large turnover in mgmt. recently, so stock hammered-> down from $25.

PEAK International is in the semiconductor cap. equipment space. Most companies
in this space trade at 3x/4x revenue.

They also have a dominant 40% market share in the business they are in ->
packaging products for transporting, storing and handling semiconductors
(trays, carrier tapes and reels).

But mgmt./ownership is a mess, leading to defections and current beat up
valuation. At a minimum, with cash of $10mm, and no debt, seems like should be
worth near hard book of $8. Also given robustness of earnings power in the
business and its strategic value, seems like a good deal for a strategic
acquiror.

Recent press release indicates business is chugging along nicely:

"Peak Reports Continuing Momentum In Its Business"
Hong Kong and Austin, Texas, April 7, 1999
In response to continuing inquiries, Peak International today reported
continuing momentum in its business, reflecting ongoing strengthening in the
semi-conductor industry and customer demand for Peak's products. Peak expects
to report sales of ~$17.5 milliom for the quarter ended March 31, 1999. PEAK
FURTHER NOTED THAT IT ATTAINED HIGHER REVENUES FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH THAN FOR
ANY OF THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
Peak emphasized that it is meeting its customer demands, and that it has not
experienced the transitory delays in order taking or customer service,
disclosed as possible in a previous announcement, and further, that it has
experienced no stoppages at its factories. Peak also stated that its cash
position is strong, and that it has no borrowings.
Peak reaffirmed that it is actively searching for a new President and CEO as
part of the Company's goal to build its senior management leadership.
Jerry Mo, acting President and CEO said, "Contrary to the self-serving efforts
and innacurate statements of certain parties interested in depressing the price
of the Company stock, Peak's market position, the momentum building in its
business, and its financial strength all position the Company to attain long
term growth and enhance shareholder value. We are very pleased with March sales
results and are confident about business developments."

Seems like an interesting story here. JMHO.
