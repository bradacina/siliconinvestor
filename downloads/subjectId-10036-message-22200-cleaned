Right, Bob Rudd. That's what I meant to say: RML is a supplier to WMT, and WMT
will be cutting back purchases from RML - apparently only though as regards a
particular product line (boys' clothes), which is a small percentage of RML's
overall sales.

I hope that's all that WMT will be dropping from RSL. (assuming here that both
companies have, and want to continue, a profitable customer/supplier
relationship)

I'm not concerned with cash flow here. (Perhaps I should be.) I assume that
sales are down due to hurricanes damaging RSL's goods for delivery as well as
distribution facilities, and I expect cash flow will be diminished too. My bet
is that sales and p/sales will return to normal levels at some reasonable point
in future.

FSP and HSM are both down despite the insider buying and nice yields. I guess
thats a function of interest rates.

I averaged down twice already so my average cost is $17.01 in FSP.

Would like to see some more insider buying now that its down.

Im probably going to wait for that before buying more.

Still hopeful that their upcoming conference call will bring buying interest as
right now, FSP is relatively unknown on wall street.

Current yield is 7.72% and I feel confident that they wont reduce it going
forward because of their historical dividend payments.

HSM is $13.13 which yields 8.22% if they dont reduce them again as they have in
the past.

Madharry. I'm buying this stock for the dividend; I don't expect much capital
gains. Which is okay, because I am expecting that the consistency of the stock
price will offer a little bit of stability to the portfolio in which I am
putting it.

To me, I see more risk that the dividend yield will continue to rise (as the
stock price continues to fall). I find it rare that the dividends in these real
estate companies are cut. (Of course, when the rare occasion occurs, the price
plummets.)

You are correct in that there's not a lot of public or private history to the
company. We do have some positives however:
1. Recent insider buys higher than current price.
2. Good dividend for the past four years.
3. Company seems to pride itself on having an unleveraged portfolio of
properties. If I understand that right, that means no mortgage debt.
4. Company properties are diversified by type and by geography.

As is my wont, I like to buy as part of a diversified package. I have posted
here on a recent buy of Camden Property. And there have been the education
REITs. I also still have a few shares remaining of LHO and MLS - stocks I've
posted on here over the past 1/2 decade or more. Also holding UDR.

For me, FSP might work. Diversity and time sometimes mitigate risk. For
somebody else, somebody perhaps only with a high-tech portfolio of a dozen
stocks who might be looking to add FSP, I'd say maybe FSP is a risky 1/13 bet
to be making, and I presume a little too slow for somebody hoping and expecting
a lot of action from his/her stock picks.

I don't recall LBY, but as I look at it now, stock seems relatively attractive
on psr and p/bk. Earnings have fallen off a cliff though of course. That high
d/e number is discouraging for somebody who just scans for this without having
knowledge of the business requirements. Net profit margins have been slipping
in recent years.

With this stock, as well as other manufacturing stocks I've been looking at and
buying, I have the nagging suspicion that times are just so difficult - Chinese
or other competitors, increasing raw material costs, etc. - that it just may
not be possible for any of these listed companies to be again making enough
profits to support stock prices the way they were before (with those higher psr
and p/bk numbers). I often bet on revision-to-mean; that may not happen with
these companies. OTOH, the stock - now near $12 - has traded above $25 for many
years (including this year), so maybe if the company comes back into favor -
the special charges cease - it seems reasonable to me the stock might improve
somewhat: even just going to $18... That'd be a 50% gain. Not an impossibility.

re PERY. i don't like the stock after a customary look. High debt load is the

anb issue with higher overall rates or deteriorating credit ratings. I don't
think their brands are strong and I don't see how they can position themselves
against low cost competition.

HELE - their weak execution and cash flow generation was masked a while by
acquisitions which foreshadowed the current weak results.

FWIW - during the last 2 years the junkiest and highest leveraged companies
often had the best returns. I believe that going forward, things will be

PERY, HELE, XEC --

I followed PERY since I owned it May thru August 31. Even though it's kind of a
slow growth story, I want to buy it back. Quality company with a fair PE.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/co?s=PERY

My latest buy (throughout Sept) was XEC. A natural gas game. I don't think it
possible to lose on this one. unless there are government windfall taxes or
price controls. Nat Gas prices will not be going down this winter. A lot of
industry experts are saying $20 per MMBTU.

http://www.321energy.com/archives.php?c=natgas
http://www.wtrg.com/daily/small/ngspot.gif

It is believed by industry insiders such as Chesapeake Energy, the nation's
third largest independent producer of natural gas in the United States, that
the market is currently experiencing a false sense of security, which is common
in September and October as these are typically months with low demand for
natural gas. As Aubrey McClendon, CEO of Chesapeake Energy, explains, "There is
no physical shortage today since we are just putting gas in storage. However,
we are going to go into wintertime with our lowest amount of storage in three
years. Offsetting that you have very high gas prices right now and the question
the market is searching for is -- have we forced enough conservation to offset
the supply losses? Our view is that we have likely not done this, and now we
are all in the hands of Mother Nature."

try googling "natrual gas shortage" or something.

I dumped UTSI stock @ 5.65 and took my loss. If the fundamentals change (and I

enough with the company to stay in there, but be careful. These things can get
really ugly.

My best trade this year (even though a huge money loser) was a dump of ENC when
the fundamentals changed. It used to make money and trade at a discount to
book, so I bought it. Well fundamentals changed --- it had a misimplementation
of an Enterprise Resource Planning system and demand for its collectibles
shrunk. Now it is bleeding out cash and could go bankrupt.

You just read em...It hurts to admit being wrong. I was right about the

turns I may follow. Often my style is to hang on, but as I posted, I've been
down this road before....Last year's Florida hurricane trade was over in 3
weeks or so...I hung on and sold at a loss, because I expected more...this
time, I've repeated the error by not selling sooner [the magnitude of it fooled
me], but I still eked out 3.6%.
It's really tough to sell when you're deep underwater, especially as a value
investor...I'm still holding UTSI, but I can't make a good case for doing so.
Wish I'd cut that loss earlier.
Longer term: Currently FLE is ~70% RV's, but MH and RV production are
interchangeable. If MH biz which has been in a depression for several years
[since ~99] due to prior credit excesses, turns on demand for low cost housing
it may offset RV softness due to high gas prices. If gas prices drop, RV's may
not be so soft...they've actually been pretty resilient up to just the recent
gas spike. The market sold off on Thor's good outlook today, so the Katrita

Grommit, I posted this on XEC about 5 weeks ago on another thread. I since
closed out my position for a modest gain, before this rampant selling. I may
look to reenter.

XEC: Independent with a PE around 11 and profit margins of nearly 23%. In June
completed acquisition of Magum Hunter Resources, thus tripling its proved
reserves and doubled its production. About 81% of proven reserves are natural
gas. More than 80% of Cimarex's reserves are in Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas.
Has a strong record of exploration and development with rigorous collection and
analysis of data by a top-drawer engineering staff. With higher NG prices, XEC
could use the extra cash to aggressively pay off debt, which is low to begin
with. Has low exposure in GOM; aerial surveys indicated that all operated
platforms and producing structures are intact and appear to have suffered only
minimal damage. Some of Cimarex's onshore Gulf Coast operations also suffered
light damage. S&P rates it a buy with a $50 target. On 9/1 Lehman Bros. raised
its target to $58 fro $52. Lastly, XEC has an unusually smart, civil, and
sophisticated Yahoo message board, a bullish sign IMO.

MCsweet, thank you for the update on UTSI. It is a very risky stock - even

UTSI is making huge bets on IPTV and other new area. Their existing business is
under pressure from Chinese competitors. I wish they could have sold their
cheap wireless phone solutions in developing countries like India and Russia,
that's the advantage they have over local competitors. However they have not

TPX - I own this one. I'm hoping it won't go the way of the housing bubble. The
consensus seems to believe that though. Also, with gasoline prices where it is,
consumer spending will be hurt. That certainly won't help move their high end
products.

On valuation, the stock looks cheap even assuming a pessimistic year for 2006,
say flat EPS , despite expanding into 90-100 more stores next year. I think
with a little patience, the stock will do well. I expect it to double in two
years with little downside risk from here.

My guess is that we're seeing a lot of tax loss selling and portfolio
repositioning away from economically sensitive stocks.

re FMD - there are several red flags. The most important issue with tthe stock
is that "cash earnings" are less than 1/2 of stated earnings (I calculated
40-50% but i think the actual number is more 33%!). So the question is what do
you pay for 1-1.40$ in cash earnings?Please see my earlier post as well as the
rebuttal for a balanced viewpoint:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=21584900&srchtxt=FMD

FMD securitizes student loans and cashes out some premiums paid by the lender.
Those premiums and some other fees are "cash earnings". FMD then calculates the
projected cash flows od these loans (please note that students don't pay
principal and interest for 4+ years), discounts them back using their models
derived from their proprietary database. Those are the non cash earnings.

Sounds a lot like Enron to me, except that FMD does not have large debt that
could sink this company. I am be wrong but i would not pay much for "non cash
earnings" valuation wise.

hoyasaxa: The key for that threesome is the prospect for RV sales which in turn
depends on the level of gas prices and consumer sensitivity to that level. I
agree that WGO & THOR are currently stronger. This is largely due to the prior
multi-year strength in RV's relative to MH which was once FLE's main biz. FLE,
relative to the other two, is more a bet on MH, since they have traditionally
been a MH player and shifted more to RV's when MH sales were killed by the
credit drought. They can shift production back and already have strong brands
in that category.
I may re-enter FLE when the situation stabilizes as a bet on MH rebound. RV
prospects look less attractive/more uncertain to me presently...but that could
change if gas prices revert to the mean as they often do.

You are correct in pointing out that the residuals from the securitized bonds
is big question mark for FMD. However, I think the future cash flow from these
bonds can be considered to have a greater than zero value. First, TERI is the
guarantor for FMD loans. Since TERI is a not for profit agency, students may
not discharge these loans by declaring bankruptcy. The article I linked noted
that the company stands to receive $3 in cash for each $1 in discounted income
recognized at the time of the securitization (assuming a 12% discount rate).
The historical net default rate for these bonds is 3%. FMD has modeled a 6% net
default rate for their residuals in June 05 securitization. Finally,
securitizations are not all lumped together, but sold in tranches with credit
ratings ranging from AAA to A depending on their credit enhancements and
payment pecking order.

The prepayment risk due to higher interest rates is more difficult to quantify.
However, considering the price of the stock, I like the risk/reward ratio with
FMD.

Speaking of bank stocks, ran across another demutualization when searching
insider buys.

INVESTORS BANCORP (ISBC)

I show 4 different open market insider buyers on 10/12 at prices up to $10.71,
this was the first day they began trading.

Im no expert on demutualizations but I recall several posting on a couple of
them in the past.

INVESTORS BANCORP, INC.
ANNOUNCES COMPLETION DATE OF MINORITY STOCK
OFFERING AND FISCAL YEAR END RESULTS

Short Hills, New Jersey, October 7, 2005 - Investors Bancorp, Inc. (the
"Company"), the holding company of Investors Savings Bank, announced today that
it expects to close its minority stock offering at the close of business on
October 11, 2005. Upon closing, Investors Bancorp, MHC, will hold 63,099,781
shares, or 54.27% of the Company's outstanding common stock, and 51,627,094
shares, or 44.40% of the outstanding common stock, will be issued to
subscribers in the offering, including 4,254,072 shares of common stock to be
purchased by the Investors Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan. In
addition, the Company will contribute $5,163,000 in cash and issue 1,548,813
shares of common stock, or 1.33% of its outstanding common stock, to the
Investors Savings Bank Charitable Foundation.

Shares of the Company are expected to begin trading on Wednesday, October 12,
2005, on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "ISBC."

The offering was oversubscribed by eligible account holders of Investors
Savings Bank as of January 31, 2004. Accordingly, eligible account holders will
have valid orders filled in accordance with the allocation procedures set forth
in the Company's plan of stock issuance. Supplemental eligible account holders
as of June 30, 2005 will not have orders filled. If you are an eligible account
holder and would like to confirm your allocation, please contact the Stock
Information Center at (800) 768-1260. The Stock Information Center will be open
from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Monday, October 10, 2005, and 9:00 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. on Tuesday, October 11, 2005 through Friday, October 14, 2005.

Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. acted as financial advisor to the Company in
connection with the offering and managed the subscription offering. Luse Gorman
Pomerenk & Schick, P.C. acted as special counsel to the Company.

At June 30, 2005, the Company had total consolidated assets, deposits and
stockholders' equity of $4.99 billion, $3.24 billion and $407.8 million,
respectively. The Company also announced it had net income of $7.0 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2005 and a net loss of $3.1 million for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The Company's registration statement (SEC File
No. 333-125703), previously filed and declared effective by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, disclosed that the Company had net income of $4.9 million
for the two months ended May 31, 2005 and a net loss of $5.3 million for the
eleven months ended May 31, 2005. The net loss for the year ended June 30, 2005
was due primarily to the asset and liability restructuring transaction executed
in March 2005, as disclosed in the Company's registration statement.
Additionally, and as stated in the registration statement, net interest income
remains under pressure. The increase in short-term interest rates,
unaccompanied by a corresponding rise in long-term interest rates (the
flattening of the yield curve), continues to have a negative impact on net
interest income.

Investors Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for Investors Savings Bank,
which operates from its main office in Short Hills, New Jersey, and forty-six
branch offices located in Essex, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean,

What's your value criteria on Price/Sales for a wholesaler/manufacturer? I am
looking at Newell Rubbermaid since their CEO resigned recently. A new

E_K_S: For wholesaler/manufacturer I only compare current p/sales ratio to past
years. That could indicate NWL a buy now at its current relatively low ratio.
However, NWL's not been able show profits on its sales, and if they've sold
businesses in their restructuring (I'm not sure here), I don't know if they
would be the ones with high p/sales or low p/sales. In other words, for NWL I'm
not so sure that p/sales is an indicator of a possible buy-in point. I've been
interested in NWL at $20 and below when it's occasionally been there - sorry I
didn't have courage to step in at those times. (ref: discussions with
Investor2)
-------------
MRK looks good on financial numbers (certainly compared to past years).
Lawsuits, possible pipeline or patent issues, etc. make me want to avoid this
one. I have stub amounts of BMY and PFE - these companies' problems and stock
performance (down, down) don't give me much faith for restarting a MRK
position. For me, if I see more discussion by other value players that they are
buying MRK, I might get some encouragement for a few shares for myself.

I'm considering upping my stub holding of ABT if stock drops a couple points
more. This company's problems don't seem to be as intractable as others (but I
am only guessing), and I like the company's mix of pharma and med. supplies.
Also, based on Yahoo forward p/e estimates, I am considering upping a position
in SNY.

Not a value buy, but fwiw, I've taken on a few shares today of medical device
maker CYBX. This is based on somewhat positive discussion in Barron's of
company insider buys, and that company has rejected couple of buyout offers.

Hi Paul -

What's your experience with ACTI? Have you owned it long? Why did you buy in
originally...their technology or basic "value"?

I like the company. Here are some of my thoughts . . .

ACTI is an interesting company with a set of digital identity systems that are
used by EDS, IBM, Maximus, Northrop Grumman, and Unisys. The stock was recently
trading at $10 in Dec 2004 but is now trading at a multi year low. It appears
that there has been some management reshuffling with the CFO resigning, and a
director leaving the company. They recently acquired another company for $21
million and announced a restructuring that will reduce their workforce by 13%.

The company has several technology patents of value that may not be figured
into the value in the key statistics that you posted. They recently sold the
exclusive rights to one of their patents for $4.1 million.

I see this company having a problem of marketing their technology and with the
right distributor and/or integrator (i.e. Microsoft Sun Microsystems, Dell) or
partner (i.e Google) sales could explode.

I have been trying to locate a "value" investment that has this type of
technology. This could be a five or six bagger if it hits with it's network
authentication technology. They have an enterprise authentication security
technology that utilizes an end-user smart card (and even finger print
biometrics devise) that works over any Internet based network. It's so secure
that many gonvernment accounts use it!

Google is working on a hosted network centric service that needs such an
authentication security system. Their beta test service will have end-users
(enterprise customers) use their network to host and store several types of end
user applications including Sun Microsystems desktop utilities. Both Sun and
Google have long been interested in delivering applications via the Web.
Programs sent that way, such as Google's Gmail e-mail system, can be accessed
by any connected PC. ( http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2005-10-03.. .
Their solution relies on a secure end-user authentication "open source" layer
which ACTI can deliver now (they meet the specifications for many government
accounts).

Google could license (or even buy) their technology and provide it to their
customers at no charge. There are many large corporate customers that would
provide these biometrics and smart card devices to their customers at no fee in
order to provide a secure end-user (including mobile cell phone user)
environment (brokerage companies, banks, or any other e-commerce services).

Does ACTI have the marketing expertise to promote their technology to Google
and provide them the vision to invest in a long term licensing (and or patent
purchase) agreement? Their corporate office in Fremont CA is only 20 miles away
from Google's corporate campus in Mountain View CA.

============================================================

I plan to take a small position in ACTI and maybe Google and ACTI can discuss
their needs on security technologies.

I will be watching to see if ACTI announces a new (1) marketing manager and (2)
if they release an "open source" software/hardware security product. Any
discussion or marketing agreement with Google would be a home run for this
company.

can climb the wall of worries this is going to be a 25$ stock.
