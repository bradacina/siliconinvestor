INN was he worst performing REIT for the first q. according to this article.
But look at what happened to PEI.

DJ Investment Up In Small Real Estate Cos In Q1, While Overall REITs Weaker
By A.D. Pruitt
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Investors piled into the stocks of small real-estate companies during the first
quarter, an indication that the improving economy is encouraging investors to
take on more risk.

Overall, the performance of real-estate investment trusts was weaker in the
just-ended quarter compared with the previous quarter. The Dow Jones All REIT
index posted a total return of 10.48% in the first quarter, down sharply from
the fourth quarter's return of 15%.

But in a surprise, returns for some smaller REITs were higher. The three
best-performing REITs in the latest quarter have market capitalizations of less
than $1 billion and were among the worst-performing stocks last year. Many of
the smaller-cap REITs are considered riskier investments than larger companies
because they usually shoulder heavy debt loads and tenant demand is more
sensitive to economic pressures. As such their stock prices tend to be on the
cheap side.

For instance, Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI), a
Philadelphia-based owner of 49 shopping malls that has a market cap of about
$845 million, was the top-performing REIT in the Dow Jones index for the first
quarter with a 48% total return. That is a turnaround from last year, when
Pennsylvania REIT was one of the worst performers, posting a return of negative
24%.

Last year, investors dumped Pennsylvania REIT on concerns that the company was
too highly leveraged and that sales volumes at some of its malls were too low
to remain viable.

In recent months, however, investors' perceptions of the company have changed.
With "the economy picking up, credit markets reopening and retailers looking
for space...investors are more willing to take a position" in the company, said
Nathan Isbee, an analyst at Stifel Nicholas.

Nursing-home landlord, Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (SBRA) posted the
second-best performance in the latest quarter with a total return of 38.8%.
Last year, the stock of the company, based in Irvine, Calif., posted a total
return of negative 29% on fears that steep cuts in Medicare reimbursements
would hurt the ability of its tenants to pay rent.

Joel Beam, a fund manager at the Forward Select Income Fund and one of Sabra's
largest shareholders, said the company and its tenants should be able to cut
expenses to offset expected drops in Medicare revenues. Besides, "there aren't
many stocks out there that you can get an 8% yield," Beam said. Sabra's yield
is significantly higher than industry's average of roughly 3%.

Timber REITs, companies that grow and harvest the trees used to produce lumber
used for home building, were also strong performers during the quarter,
benefiting from perceptions that the housing industry is on the cusp of a
recovery that will eventually prompt builders to ramp up construction. The
three companies that make up the timber sector had an average total return of
8.65%, according to the Dow Jones index.

Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY), the leading timber REIT and one of the largest
forest-products companies in the world, posted a total return of 18% during the
latest quarter.

While all the property sectors ended in positive territory, the health-care
REITs posted the smallest total return, 2%. Because these landlords have very
long-term leases, the perception is they won't be able to benefit from higher
rents as fast as their peers that have shorter contracts and cater to a broader
array of consumers like retail, hotels and multifamily.

The worst-performing REIT was Summit Hotel Properties Inc. (INN), delivering a
total return of negative 18.8%. Investors started exiting the stock after the
company reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings in late February
at a time when many hotel companies are posting improving profit on increased
corporate and luxury travel.

"Investors were anticipating better revpar [revenue per available rooms]
numbers and that has not yet materialized," said Daniel Donlan, an analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC. He said part of the problem was the company
started renovations at a number of its hotels, which disrupted bookings.

Hi EKS. In January, most of the major contributors to this thread where running
for the sidelines and parking their money for a major market sellathon. This to
my understanding, is not value investing. I could post links but why bother.
History proves me right. Value always shines through regardless.

Market timing right now is not value investing either. It never is.

Value investing is about finding value where others are not finding value. And
it does not mean buying stocks on down days or at 52 week lows.

Georgi,

I agree with you about basing user experience on how to valuate a company,
that's why i don't really have an opinion on it other than i would not buy the
stock.... In general the people i know buy the groupons in the beginning but as
time goes on and good vendors stop using groupon due to bad experience, people
largely ignore it and dont bother with it anymore. Just my 2 cents.

NFLX - got to bring up fond memories of this gem. Not going to lie i could go a
little while without some of these public names.... just to much stress

I've debated on whether discussing my portfolio returns % or $ value, not that
yall give two shits about it anyhow, but 2011 was a wild year but a decent one

I risked only 60% of my total capital (40% cash): I returned 41% for the year
on total capital.

- Carried two long positions MA and AAPL (AAPL held from 2010)

-AAPL started at 10% of portfolio in 2010 i bought at 223.83, it increased to
15% of portfolio by start of 2011 and did well in 2011

-MA bought that in September 2011 - 10% position (wish i did sooner) - returned
19%

-NFLX - i started building up a position in leaps at end of 2010 into early
part of 2011. I risked 5% and lost 50%, and thats with covering 75% in March
2011 and the rest in September when it finally turned in my favor but barely
edge anything because of time decay.

-OPEN - this stock was all over the place, i exited for about a flat gain.

-Vale - i been on here for a long time hating the sh*t out of this stock, i
bought leaps at avg price of .9 and sold them at 3.00 or so in the fall for a
gain of 230%. I still have 25% of them. 10% position

-BHP - same thing, i used my netflix money to help buy bhp puts in the summer,
110% gain. Still have some of the Leaps left. - 10% position

-EWA - i own leaps on this Australian ETF as well, it was flat for the year. -
10% position

I learned alot of lessons in 2011, im still reflecting on it... i really played
on what is emperor wear no clothes china (still am though everything is
expensive and hard to have direct exposure now), but its funny how it takes
time for something to develop and play out, i benefited greatly from timing and
using volatility in my favor.

Ive been very humbled, investing is hard. I sit and chew on things forever...
end up only owning a few things.I want to own more stocks.

Also as i have made more money, i have been more conscious and cautious.... how
does that happen!! more money more problems

My style of investing has also wore on me, i look for things that are flawed
and try to wait it out... i was really early on china, late 2010!

2012: positions

AAPL (sold most of it past month or so)
MA (never selling this stock)
SU (bought 1/4 position)

re AP - the stock is cheap by many measures , price/tangible book, PE,
EV/EBITDA etc but there are big issues that make me question the value
proposition at current prices (~20$/share)
- Asbestos liabilities, while manageable are a constant drag on FCF
- backlog has sunk from 730M$ in 2007 to 210M$. it has shrunk consistently at a
rate of 140M$/year, which means that given AP revenue base of 310M$, the book
to bill has been way below 1 for several years. Given the long lead time nature
of AP product (Cold rolls for steel plants) it appears that this means that AP
revenue will collapse this year and earnings most likely will do likewise.

In fact looking through the numbers above, and the weak business environment
that most steel companies find themselves in, I think AP is a better put than a
long play.

Hi Clownbuck -

Re: SVU

The author provides a compelling argument that SVU could be a value trap. He
did not discuss the value in their company owned real estate (similar to Tesco,
Walmart, Sears and Target). I have not looked recently to see if this makes up
a large component of their assets but this was always a large factor in my
review.

Second, the author does not discuss the Pharmacy franchise they obtained from
the Albertson's purchase. They are one of the top 5 (if not top 3) medical
prescription providers in the U.S.. The margins in this business can not be
compared to the margins in their grocery business.

Lastly, there was no discussion about the company's ability to generate FCF
especially while operating a profitable distribution/logistics division.

I think I agree w/ his conclusion that a significant restructuring is required
that scales down the food side of the company and highlights their pharmacy
side. Their distribution/logistics division could be spun off and/or expanded
to serve Target's expansion plans and/or even be acquired and folded into
Sysco's operation.

Therefore, I think the author is a bit too narrow sighted on where the
potential value opportunities are. In the current structure, his conclusion is
probably accurate especially since this industry (food sales) is a very thin
margin business. They just can not make it up on volume w/ their huge debt load
(at least in the 3-5 year time horizon he is looking at).

Hi Dennis -

Re NG

The market is always looking forward. The number of NG drilling rigs are now
25% less than were in place last year and falling. At some point supplies (in
storage) will meet current demand. If I were a buyer of any of these companies,
I would want to own the low cost producers. The best time to buy these
companies is when there is way too much supply, no more storage capability and
wells have to be turned off. I think we are pretty close to this stage in the
cycle. Eventually, there will be no new wells drilled, a bitter cold winter
depleting NG storage and "poof" too much demand given the current supplies.
Once there is any indication of such a situation, there will no longer be any
value buys available. In fact, I would be peeling off shares of my basket of NG
companies to sell.

So I agree w/ you that falling prices & building inventories are indicators to
watch but not necessarily the best ones when looking to acquire one or more of
the low cost producers at a value price (for the long term hold).

re SVU - yes the authors looked at consolidated numbers that includes all
business units. The problem is that SVU business cannot be easily broken apart.
For example you cannot simply look at the pharmacy as a standalone unit because
they are part of the store - if the store closes, so will the pharmacy. So,
while it is true that the pharmacy would have a higher value, if it were a
standalone unit, this is simply not an economic reality.

Sam with the distribution business where SVU itself is the largest customer.

Sergio H,

At least according to the father of value investing, Benjamin Graham, market
valuation should be a factor in value investing. He warned that one of the
biggest risks was buying relatively cheap second-tier stocks near a market
peak. They may be relatively attractive, but their fundamentals can deteriorate
and interest in them can disappear, so you end up taking a big hit on price.
Take 2008-2009 for example. I was overweighted second-tier stocks and got my
head handed to me. I made it all back and then some, but would have been much
better off with holding more cash in 2008 and especially in 2007 when the
market was looking pricey.

Graham suggested a stock/bond allocation range from 75% stocks/25% bonds to 25%
bonds/75% stocks based on the relative value of the two asset classes. Of
course, I don't know anyone who actually follows that, but it shows the father
of value investing considered these things.

I agree with you that too much short term timing is inconsistent with general
value investing. I think few very people can correctly time going to all cash
and, as importantly, then correctly time going back to fully invested. I also
believe that technical analysis is fairly independent from really value
investing, although I don't begrudge people who use it.

However, I do believe there are times when market valuations suggest being
fully weighted versus having some cash available. Right now is not one of the
times I am inclined to be fully invested, but I will concede the market has
rallied farther than I expected.

Re: SVU

Another thing that does not make sense is the author's comment about the
dividend. At $74 million, it's a bit less than 10% of FCF. Not a problem, IMO.

And the debt. Yahoo shows a $3.7 billion decrease from $9.8 billion to $6.1
billion in less than 3 years. At this rate they will be debt free within the
authors 3-5 year time frame. Just like Whole Foods.

Hi Kyros -

More on SVU - The value proposition.

I was thinking how SVU can leverage on their positive attributes, do something
disruptive in the industry and start to utilize their assets in a much more
profitable way. Is there an easy solution? Not really but an exciting
opportunity IMO.

What if SVU trimmed down their retail space by 30% removing shelf/storage items
that (1) took up a lot of space and/or (2) were marginal product contributors
and replaced that "retail space" w/ a customer pick-up distribution Kiosk. This
would be an area for customers to pick up their pre-ordered items that were
placed from (1) their smart phone and/or (2) from their computer at some other
remote site. My thinking is that SVU could capitalize on the "smart phone"
technology, online internet orders, their extensive warehouse & logistics back
end systems and their brick & mortar store locations.

The Concept for the Pre-Order Model

SVU would build an electronic customer pre-order system allowing the purchase
of high valued/high margin items w/i their stores, online, or even at other
retail locations. SVU would partner w/ several established online retailers
(like Diapers.com, coffee.com, bathsupplies.com etc) that would offer great
deals to current SVU customers. SVU could cross promote products displaying a
one off item at their store (ie. Armanino Foods specialty pastas) and allow
customers to pre-order item(s) by simply taking a picture of the bar code w/
their smart phone. Vendors would deliver product to SVU's warehouse(s) and
their distribution trucks would deliver items to the store Kiosks w/ 2 hour
window pick up time (customer received special discount if received w/i that
delivery window) using a "just-in-time" delivery system.

SVU could lead the industry in online product pre-paid delivery (no
receivables, product is paid electronically at time of order and therefore no
inventory turnover). This type of pre-order sales model can be used for special
meat & seafood orders for holidays, large one time "in season" produce buys,
diapers from online partners like Diaper.com, specialty high value/high margin
foods like coffee, pasta, bathroom and health care supplies etc.

Now, you have converted low return retail store space, to high return high
margin space where the key was integrating their logistic delivery system(s)
into each store site for both refrigerated/frozen foods and dry supplies. Using
the smartphone customers could scan products at competing retailers (like
Costco) to see what might be available through SVU's online two-day store
delivery service. Using Groupon, facebook, and other vendor offers along w/
SVU's retail channels, a new company can now get SVU's distribution channels
and SVU is not responsible for maintaining inventory and/or shelf space.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

My point is that SVU has a lot of very good assets that can be reconfigured
using new technology (like the smart phone) to present a compelling efficient
pre-order distribution retail network. Too many times, analysts are judging a
company based on "old" style ideas and if one just think's outside the box a
bit, it can open up a lot of new and intriguing possibilities.

Your point on debt pay down is a big one too. There has been a rumor floating
that SVU may cut and/or eliminate their dividend which may have caused the
recent selling in the stock.

Hi Sergio -

I was not really promoting Andrew Nyquist or the DeMark set up (in fact never
heard of that) but was intrigued w/ his F&D Cost and Low Cost NG Producer
tables. I do not recall ever seeing such a list of all the NG producers ranked
in such a way. For me, the low hanging fruit are the low cost NG producers
bought at a value price. My value proposition is that if one believes we are at
or near the bottom in the NG cycle (I believe we are see my earlier post to
Dennis), then you want to be buying the low cost NG producers. The chart
posted, (for me) provided a pretty good list of those producers.

I hope w/i the coming week and months to be nibbling at some of these producers
and was glad to find out that I already own a few on that list.

I am always looking under a lot of rocks trying to find value opportunities.
Many times I have found that at extremes in a cycle, values (or potential
values) do rise. As an example, SVU I believe has some value but only to a
management team that shares my view on restructuring options. Therefore, I
could be buying into a value trap if the company is managed the same old way.

As for me, my focus has been to turn my portfolio over more (trying to turn it
over every 36 month rather than every 60 months) and have been now selling many
of those companies I bought in the 2008/2009 market crash. Many of these
companies (for me) are at or near their fair value level and I try to post my
reasons why. Recently I have been using the GN and debt levels as an important
consideration weather to hold or sell a position.

Remember, cash generates a negative return but I also want to preserve my
principle too.

I hope that helps in clarifying some of my current views for finding value buys
(at least for me). They are out there but right now I am looking at some
different metrics that must present a compelling value argument before I step
up with any new buys.

FWIW, I did more 30% of my portfolio into foreclosure real estate in November
2011. That represent almost one entire year of my new stock buys (assuming I
hit my 36 month portfolio turnover goal). I have been selling a few of my fair
valued assets to finance those transactions.

I always seem to have trouble with fcf --- sometimes it seems to be
inconsistent the way people report or define it.

Here:
http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&btn=s_ok&mode=&symbol=svu&s_ok=OK

free cash flow per share is $2.32 per share (reported under "solvency ratios"),
which does seem like a Very attractive number ---- resulting in a "screaming
bargain" though, I don't know.

And then down that link's "per share" numbers, long-term debt per share is
$29.94, so from that I don't have such a positive view that the company can or
could pay off its debt in just a few (3-5) years with just a fcf number of
$2.32. Not that it or any company would necessarily want to pay off debt.
Rather, that these numbers don't give me a lot of confidence that the company
is both safe and cheap. Other people with better knowledge of the financial
numbers or analysis, may have a different (and better) opinion than I have.

I'm still considering if SVU is worth making a small bet on. A large bet ---
that'd be too tough (risky) for me right now.

Hi Paul -

Re: SVU

I am also reviewing the company after really not looking at it for the last
year.

Items that add to the value proposition for me include:

(1) Recent EPS share losses were the result of writing down accumulated
goodwill from the Albertson's acquisition. There is still quite a bit left to
write down. I suspect, next week earnings will show another write down.

(2) After backing out all Goodwill, TBV/share should reflect their cost of all
their company owned real estate. This should be a large positive number but
from two different sources it comes up as -$6.82/share. Somehow, I believe this
number still reflects accumulated goodwill.

I was trying to figure out what the Net TBV/share is once you exclude all
goodwill. That balance should reflect the value of their real estate based on
their original cost. I suspect that this value will be close to the current
market price or perhaps a bit lower since (a) the acquisition of Albertsons
occurred before the real estate bubble and (b) previous owned SVU real estate
was bought at much lower prices.

(3) The CEO has been paying down the long term debt.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=SVU+Balance+Sheet&annual

February 2009 Long Term Debt: $7,968,000 ($37.58/share)
February 2011 Long Term Debt: 6,348,000 ($29.94/share)

Amount paid down: $1,620.000 (7.64/share over the last three years or about
$2.54/share per year)

Share Out 212M

Therefore, at the current pay down rate, LT debt would be paid off in about 10
years.

I will have to go to the SVU Web site and look at their annual report. When I
did this last year, they broke out the detail for both revenues and earnings on
their logistic business. My take then was that this was their hidden gem
because that division was so profitable. I valued just that piece at around
$600M or about $2.83/share.

The key for any of this is if current or new management can leverage their
Pharmacy brand (ranked just below Wallgreen in market share) and their
profitable logistic business assets (Sysco has shown past interest in this
business) together and somehow rework their retail stores to generate higher
gross margins/ft sq w/o raising prices. Shrink the stores and lease out inside
Kiosk space (in my Lucky store both Citibank and AAA lease inside space) and/or
develop some type of electronic pre-order (internet) pick-up Kiosk.

SVU is definitely continuing to have difficulties. My son is the produce
manager of an Albertson's store where the store management changes more often
than most people change their shorts. He is not allowed to purchase local
produce and has to try to sell cherries for $4.00 per pound. Locally they are
grown and available for $2.00 per pound. We live in the fruit and vegetable
bowl of the nation.His cherries just rot on the shelf. Management has no clue
as to hiring practices and regional managers are equally in the dark. All
departments are trying to go against last years numbers with less staff and
lower employee hours.

People want one stop shopping like Fred Meyers offers and when for instance,
other stores are offering Coke for $5.00 a case, it is hard to sell yours for
$6.99 a twelve pack. I think that I would buy stock in Walmart before
considering SVU. By and large, food companies don't have the margins to make
money like they used to. In our state we just passed a ballot measure that
allows private stores to sell hard alcohol. Walmart and Costco are gearing up
for their June first start. Once the cost leaders are established it will be
the kiss of death for companies here like Albertson's. JMHO

I dont disagree with you Jurgis, i havnt for some time now : )..... the
valuation is obviously reasonable

all i know is please show me similar action on a stock with a run or move like
this and show me a good outcome?

I mean as a value investor, do we not put the stock through our checklist and
if the thing is going parabolic, dont we put the breaks on? Name a value guy
who buys in after this kind of move....

The value proposition was at $200, $300 etc.... now im just not so sure. It
will be a dominant force for years to come, but in my short lifespan moves like
this have not turned out well. Trying to think of one

I added a little GMXR- and GMXR today. Their latest well looks to me like it
should cover (or at least go a long way in covering) their interest payments.
I'm not sure how fast these wells decline (33% per year??) and hopefully they
can duplicate their recent drilling success a few times such that the stock may
appreciate nicely. I think the stock is a better buy today than it was
yesterday despite the price appreciation.

Actually some of the valuation measures were worse at $200 in 2008 than they
are now ( http://www.gurufocus.com/financials.php?symbol=aapl - not sure if you
can see 10 year financials without registering). On the other hand, the law of
large numbers may strike AAPL at some point.

It was better buy 4 months ago at $400, so I won't make any recommendations

re SVU - a couple of things. if you look at EV/EBITDA numbers, SVU and SWY are
valued about the same (~4.2 EV/EBITDA). SWY has better comps and a better
balance sheet , in SVU case the equity slice is much smaller, which provides a
lot of leverage. However looking at the enterprise including debt (the way an
private equity buyer would do it) both are valued about the same.

In SVU and SWY case, the EV does not contain the following very real
obligations:
1) lease obligations
2) Pension obligation (~600M$ funding gap)
3) Multi emlpoyer pension funding obligations (~130M$ annually, worth about
1.85B$ at a 7% cap rate)

Add it all up, and I get ~ 5.5x EV/EBITDA, which imo is not terrible cheap for
a company that is shrinking, has heavy Capex requirements and besieged by
stronger competitors. I also want to point out that while SVU total debt load
has decreased, that EBITDA has shrunk by almost the same amount than the debt,
which means that SVU has just shrunk, not really leveraged.

Every once in a while, you can buy good companies for 6x EV/ EBITDA, which imo
seems a much better deal than buying a coin toss like situation like SVU at
5.5x, when adjusted for all the implied liabilities.

<ul><li>SVU. My relative is also an Albertson's produce manager, but on the
West Coast. Your son's experience matches exactly my relative's -- wrong
pricing for local-grown produce and/or no response or inadequate response to
competitors' pricing-- because pricing decisions are made elsewhere
(centralized-- vs. decentralized); less manpower in store & fewer hours than in
past year. I hadn't asked him about store/region management

When things, whatever it is start going parabolic, it usually precedes
problems. Thinking art market now, silver last year, oil in 2008.

This guy kind of paints a clear picture that i was hinting on... each time the
largest mkt cap company in the world starts experiencing an exponential move it
marked the top in the market, not necessarily the top in the companies actual
dominance in the market place.

Oh well... Now I understand why nobody talks about the moat. When the company
with most fanatical and devoted user base is said to have no moat, how can
there be a moat for any other company? What moat does Coke have with 10 brands
of soda on the shelves and tons of alternatives to soda? How does that compare
to exactly 2 platforms for personal computers: Mac and Windows (everything else
is noise)? How does it compare to pretty much one choice for music players
(iPod - well, it's passe), two choices for phones (iPhone and Android), so far
single choice for tablets (iPad)?

Moat is not about having 90% of the market, although iPod came close. Pretty
much no company has 90% of the market unless it's regulated and bound by
monopoly regs. Moat in consumer space is having users who buy your devices
without care of cost and without considering alternatives. And Apple has that
in spades.

I am not even talking about switching costs for anyone tied into Apple
ecosystem. They are not insurmountable, but they are significant. I can switch
from Coke, Harley Davidson, Master Card in a day. Try doing that with your
iTunes music library, your apps, your contact book, etc. And try doing it not
as a geek with intimate knowledge of available conversion tools but as regular
person.

Mr. Gogo, perhaps you should talk with your friends who have Apple devices and
ask them what it would take for someone to pry them from their cold dead
fingers. :P

OK, I'll go ahead and say it. I believe that Apple has the biggest moat of all
companies right now. :) Just to be controversial and see if someone shows any
other good candidates for top spot. :)

And BTW, I am not Apple fanboy. I don't own a single Apple device and don't
plan to own any. I still see the power of the brand and company. Peace, Steve,
LSD works, you did it!

Matt,

I agree with you on two counts:

- Law of large numbers. Being the biggest company in the world means that you
have sold your products to most of the people. It's hard to sustain these sales
and grow them further. At some point everyone has iPhone 10 and nobody cares
about iPhone 11. Apple can still capture market share in computers, but that's
the only market where it can easily grow fast. Otherwise, they have to expand
into new markets (TV?) where success is not guaranteed.
- Monopoly regulators. MSFT got into lost decade after anti-trust lawsuit.
Apple has avoided this so far, but at some point they will come after Apple and
usually they win.

Hi Jurgis,

I know what you are talking about, and I will explain you why i don't think it
is a moat. First switching from iTunes. It will take less than a week to Google
software team to automate the switching everything from Apple cloud to google
cloud. One example is switching from mozilla firefox to google's Chrome.
According to your logic that has to be difficult too: bookmarks, history...
Just a click of a button and you have all bookmarks and everything from mozilla
to Chrome. I personally don't own anything apple but a few Ipods that I have
got as presents. I love them and I use them. Will I pay the money for them? No.
I get the same from my android phone. I think the moat of Coka Cola is not
comparable. Their distribution network that would take years and years to
build, the chemistry of the product and the years of advertising the brand
deeply rooted in the psychology of people.

In the last 7 years I have advised about 20 lame users of computers to buy
apple laptops. Just friends ask me "What do you think is best for me to buy"
And I tell them apple, and I never hear again from them. Mainly women. And I
ask them from time to time, why don't you get a windows computer. Everyone
screams at me - not happening. So yes, this is a moat at first glance. The
reason for the moat is the ease of use and the beauty of everything. The reason
for this is Steve. Unfortunately he was the main driver, dictator and whatever
he was to achieve it. Without him i think this effect will start fading. More
and more kids I see with android device. Beautiful tablets with android
(200-300$). It is supremely integrated with google docs, gmail, google maps. My
phone now is the best GPS that I have.
and let us not forget Google owns Motorola now. They will make a perfect
integration between hardware and software.
I think that in two three years we sill start seeing erosion. It is very easy
to get off the apple products and I have seen many people (not geeks) doing it.

And I think Coka Cola has enormously bigger moat.

Your whole message is a proof that Apple has huge moat.

Your arguments against it is usual geek "it's easy" crappola. Even when it's
easy, most people don't do it. You switched to Chrome. Most of my relatives
have not switched from IE and have not even updated IE from whatever version
was originally installed.

But it's not easy. Tell me exactly how you gonna transfer your iTunes song
library to some other place without losing licensing, replacement, DRM, etc.

Just read what you wrote yourself. How many of your friends switched back to
Windows again? It's so easy to dismiss them as "women" or lame users. But they
are majority. (As an aside, I'm happy I'm not your friend, knowing what you say
about them behind their backs).

You argue that moat will weaken without Steve. So first you say that there is
no moat, then you talk about it weakening. How about some consistency?

You think that Coke has a bigger moat because you don't work in soft drinks
business. People commonly think that moats are weak in the business they work
in (computers/phones, etc. in this case) and strong in the businesses they have
no clue about.

Numbers tell more than "My friends" "Your friends". As you see about 90% of the
people use windows. This is not going to change much in the near future. Price
is the main reason.

< It's so easy to dismiss them as "women" or lame users. But they are
majority.>

if you think that 4.5% is majority over 90% then there is no need to discuss
anything.
But let us say apple have 30% of the computer market, still far from majority.

and the majority of the people I know have gone back to windows. Those who
bought laptops to use for communication, to read news, skype, use it for design
are staying with it. But those who tried to use it at work, did not.

You argue that moat will weaken without Steve. So first you say that there is
no moat, then you talk about it weakening. How about some consistency?

I think Moat is something that is almost impossible for the competition to
overcome. Design and ease of use is not so difficult unless it is patented. And
even then there are ways.

As a programmer I know how easy it is for Google to write an application that
will take all your songs convert them in anything and place them in your new
library. I am sure you know it too...

below that. It's hard to determine if their EPS have been positive for last 10

Hi Paul - I know you own both of these and have been adding shares. What's your
current value take on each? They are now getting into my buy zone again and I
didn't know if you thought one had a better value proposition than the other.

Awhile back Clownbuck looked at each and determined that ERF (I believe) was
not replacing their reserves as fast as they were making their payouts. That's
definitely not a sustainable proposition.

I would like to add to these as oil falls in price and/or as the $US gets
stronger (should be able to buy Canadian properties cheaper). My thought is as
QE3 is no longer on the table and one of the Fed members would like to see
rates increase sooner (perhaps as early as late 2013) than later (late 2014 per
Fed chairman's last statement), I anticipate the $US increasing in value
perhaps as much as 13% from present levels.

If this does occur, many of the Canadian stocks will become on sale (relative
to the $US) and I would like to use my strong $US dollars to pick up some of
these bargains.

Maybe you have a list of other Canadian companies that should be on my shopping
list.

This is a silver mine I will be buying that was mentioned by SI member Sultan (
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=58391 ). It's traded on
the Vancouver exchange so it works w/ my Canadian company theme.

Their mines are actually located in Texas and Mexico. This promotional video is
what sold me (
http://www.thebullandbear.com/bb-reporter/bbfr-archive/Aurcana.html ) as well
as their cost of production figures @ $8.73/oz (page -16- of presentation:
http://www.aurcana.com/i/pdf/CorporatePresentation.pdf )

Aurcana Corporation (AUN.V) -TSXV
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AUN.V&ql=0
Aurcana Corporation (AUNFF.PK) -Other OTC

I own Gold mines and other minerals w/ BHP but nothing that is a "pure" silver
play. This one looks like a good low risk/high return play. And it's not a
China investment. Perhaps even Madharry may find it attractive.

Interesting that you also have been nibbling at some of the larger miners, so
this one might also work for you. When I make my initial buy, I will post it as
(for me) it is a value buy.

couldn't keep up with demand. The stock prices of gun makers are like sleeper

gun shares to profit from the momentum and fear-induced rally. The trades feel
right as long as the National Rifle Association keeps telling members that
President Obama's second term will undermine the Second Amendment. A friend who
reloads ammunition says it's getting harder to buy primers, the little caps
seated in brass cartridges that ignite and propel bullets. He says a run on
primers suggests stockpiling and fear."

ERF - 2012 Presentation
http://www.enerplus.com/files/pdf/presentations/March%20Investor%20Presentation
pdf

My takeaway:
(1) 50% Oil/50% Gas
(2) 50% acres in North Western Canada & 50% U.S. domestic shale
(3) Pg-3- Netback $/boe OIL= $45-$50
(4) Pg-4- of presentation: 175% Organic Reserve Replacement in 2011; Oil
reserves increased by 14%
(5) pg-8- of presentation - Company increasing Payout ratio (by 20% to 180% -
very high and not sustainable) to maintain high dividend; Also increased equity
offering ($345M 1/2012) w/ limited growth in Funds Flow from operation due to
low NG prices. 2012 Debt/Funds Flow 185%

PWE - 2012 Presentation
http://www.pennwest.com/upload/media_element/media_file/15

(1) 66% Oil/ 34% Gas
(2) pg-9- Debt to Annualized Fund Flow 190% (est) Surprised to see it a bit
higher than ERF but no no equity offering to increase credit facility like ERF.
(3) Netback $/boe OIL= $60
(4) Pg-12- Replaced over 230% of 2011 production and achieved overall 2P
reserve growth of 12%.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

ERF appears to be a bit more leveraged than PWE but has a 20% lower netback
$/boe. ERF looks to increase reserves by 10%/year while PWEs's target is
12%/year. PWE has 30% more Oil production & reserves than ERF. ERF is adding
future oil reserves at a slightly faster pace increasing Oil production (YOY)
2011 to 2012 by 35% through acquisition and drilling. Both companies plan on
spending over 85% of 2012 Capx on light oil development projects. PWE is
aggressively increasing their total YOY production faster than ERF (this for me
is a huge factor but it does result in a higher netback cost for PWE).

PWE (last $18.11/share) selling 5% below it's 200 day MA of $19.1/share, ERF
($20.70/share) selling 16% below it's 200 day MA of $24.84.

It's hard for me to determine which company is the better "value" buy as each
has it's positive and negative attributes. PWE is well ahead of ERF in
production and building their Oil reserves. ERF has a 20% advantage in their
Netback $/boe for OIL. Both companies have been impacted by the historical low
price in NG perhaps w/ ERF being hit more than PWE here.

ERF can reduce their generous 10.5% dividend payout to save capital, while PWE
still yields 6.5% w/o having to extending a $345 Million Equity Offering like
ERF did in 2012. Surprisingly PWE has a larger estimated Debt/Funds Flow (only
by 3%) than ERF but both (for me) are quite high at 185%-190% which is not
sustainable.

Therefore, I will probably add to both companies on any continued sell off but
would favor ERF by a small amount since they have the lowest netback $/boe cost
for Oil. However, ERF has the biggest NG exposure of the two that could offset
any gain they may have in their lower netback $/boe advantage.

The biggest positive I see, is both companies have little political risk w/ 50%
of their assets located in the U.S. and 50% in Canada. There could be some
impact on future delays in the installation of gas/oil pipelines into the U.S.
as both companies rely on these pipeline to move their product to market.

Disclosure: I own both companies ERF (45% - avg cost $22.50/share) & PWE (55% -
avg cost $15.08/share), the total represents a 3% position in the taxable
portfolio.

I was surprised that both companies had such large Debt/Funds Flow but it seems
that is typical to the way they structure their business (and the historical
low NG prices amplifies this ratio). Each has good Canadian holdings. I expect
the distribution to be cut for ERF but am not sure if I should wait on my buy
or maybe the stock already reflects this.

In this down market it is hopeful to see that SU is green which indicates to me
that at least today's buyers see this company w/ a lot of value. Many if not

SVU -- Here is the WSJ take on things. Pretty out of touch, if you ask me, but
I guess that's what makes a market.

Supervalu Swings to Loss

By
http://online.wsj.com/search/term.html?KEYWORDS=KRISTIN+JONES&bylinesearch=true
http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=SVU Inc.
http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=SVU swung to a
fiscal fourth-quarter loss as the supermarket operator contended with weak
same-store sales, store closings and the sale of fuel centers.

Supervalu, whose brands include Albertson's, Save-A-Lot and Shaw's, has
struggled to cut costs in an effort to remain competitive with low-priced
rivals like http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=KR
Co. http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=KR and
http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=SWY Inc.
http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=SWY The company
planned to cut 800 office jobs in February in a bid to offset growing food
costs.

Looking ahead to the current year, the supermarket operator sees per-share
earnings of $1.27 to $1.42 on revenue of $35 billion to $35.5 billion. Analysts
polled by Thomson Reuters most recently expected earnings of $1.19 a share on
revenue of $35.3 billion.

Shares were up 10% in premarket trading to $5.85 as adjusted earnings for the
latest period also topped expectations. The stock hit a 30-year low last week
and is down 34% so far this year.

Ahead of the report, investment bank J.P. Morgan warned that the supermarket
operator's stock has been "unusually weak because of bankruptcy concerns,"
adding that investors believe, rightly or wrongly, that "Supervalu is on an
unavoidable course toward insolvency." The company didn't address those
concerns Tuesday.

For the quarter ended Feb. 25, Supervalu reported a loss of $424 million, or $2
a share, from a year-earlier profit of $95 million, or 44 cents a share.
Excluding goodwill and work-force reduction charges and other items, earnings
were 38 cents a share. Revenue decreased 5% to $8.23 billion. Wall Street saw
earnings of 35 cents on $8.31 billion in revenue.

Same-store sales were negative 1.9%.

Gross margin narrowed to 22.8% from 23.3% on added advertising expense, among
other things.

SVU stock positive in pre market +17.67% last $6.25. Management's full year's
profit forecast for 2013 $1.27 to $1.42 is quite good. At $6.25/share that
represents a PE of 4.5. Net sales are still falling YOY down 5% but maybe they
have now stabilized.

I guess the big concern for everybody is if this is the bottom on their sales
slide. I still believe the company has a lot of good core assets which just are
not going to fade away.

Good work on seeing the glass half full. It still will be a challenge for the
company to reach previous highs but hopefully they are headed in the right
direction now.

SVU -- It's tough turning this around, but the CEO, who is from WalMart, is
making a decent effort. His chances are perhaps 50-50, but if he succeeds, the
stock can triple. It takes a long time to overcome a bad reputation for a store
chain. With SVU one can wait for the turnaround, as long as they continue to
make money and pay a dividend. Most potential turnaround situations are
profitless and dividendless.

about buying into it last year but past.

Looking at the balance sheet I could see why there is some concern on

debt. Since high short position I will wait for a slight pull back and buy in.

Yes, SVU is by no means a sure thing. The short position is truly enormous.
Ordinarily, such positions imply that there is a significant risk of
bankruptcy. I suspect this is one but not the dominant reason with SVU, and it
may partially reflect pair trades of long-short hedge funds that are long the
strong companies in the space, like Whole Foods, and short weak companies like
SVU.

So SVU has reported loss in excess of $2 billions in 2011 and 2012. And there
is real concern about debt service ability. Why are you so optimistic about it
then?

Is it really profitable (net operation gain), or is it just accounting game?

The losses are due to non cash goodwill write off charges. Excluding those they

Hi Paul -

I was looking at my BDC watch list today and am still not sure how to evaluate
"Value" buys for this sector. I agree w/ your premise that there will always be
a need for these companies in both a high and low interest rate environment. In
fact, it might be a good time given the current low interest rate environment
and only a small increase in rates by the Fed in the long term (3-5 years).

So do you look at ROE or ROA returns of the companies or some combination of
other metrics. Your last observation was to start and/or add to a position when
a secondary is done. Try to buy below that price. Any other suggestions?

Here is the list of BDC's I follow: http://goo.gl/nFCxA

FWIW I am looking to trim some of my AG holdings as I expect commodity prices
to eventually fall due to an eventual strong $US dollar and early US soy bean,
corn and grain plantings (good weather has allowed as much as 3 weeks early
planting this season). Harvest should be very big bringing prices down.

Peeled off 30% of SEB shares. Looking to peel off shares in BG, ADM & CAG on
any snap back rally. It might be a good play to buy into the AG machinery
businesses like DE and/or Ag Growth International Inc. (AFN.TO) AGGZF on any
significant pull back. The farmers have lots of money and are spending it at
Tractor Supply Company (TSCO). TSCO is not a value play anymore but maybe there
are other similar stores where they spend their money (boots, specialized
equipment - GPS planting, etc).

BDC's, I also don't have a good way to evaluate these type companies. I don't
use roe or roa here .

I've used bdc's both to park cash and also for yield. This has meant large
positions for me. Large relative to "regular" stock positions. Also large in
terms of holdings by sector: bdc sector vs. other stock sectors. And so when
these stocks have cratered ('08), I had by dollar amount, relatively large
losses and more painful losses.

Here's what I'm doing with bdc's now from that experience (besides having cut
back on the number and proportion of bdc holdings in my portfolio):

1. Watching d/e ratio. Although d/e ratio is limited by law to 1:1, it didn't
seem to protect anybody in '08, and it may not now. If d/e is near the allowed
high, it may just encourage bdc's to issue more shares to fund new business and
give bdc managers greater pay/bonuses. Issuance of new shares may or may not be
dilutive.

2. I want to hold bdc's that have yields about 9-10%.

3a. I want to see bdc's with insider purchases. (Nicer of course if at higher
prices than what I can buy the stock for.)
3b. I don't want to see bdc's with insider direct sales.

4. I don't want to own bdc's that have previously cut distributions.

Here are my current holdings ranked by recent position size, most to least:
PNNT, FSC, ARCC, TCAP, CODI, TICC

I'm not happy with my losing position in FSC. It's one that I've held, and it's
one that has cut its distribution. I keep wanting to sell, but I keep holding
on. The offset being there are insider buys.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=FSC+Insider+Transactions
Also there was a dividend cut by ARCC. However, I have that pro value investor
Scott Black met with ARCC management (5/11) and came away convinced that the
issue causing the distribution cut was behind them, and so he was now (5/11) a
stockholder and recommending the stock. That info has been a positive
reinforcer for me.

I thought the FED might have included some of the BDC oversight in their "Too
Big to Fail" policy, but it appears these companies are on their own. I think I
will not chase yield and stay w/ my Credit Union or one or more of the Regional
Bank stocks that yield upwards of 8% (like NYB). It's just not worth the extra
yield (at least for me). I continue to monitor these BDC's as they are
mentioned here and on other income threads as good income generators.

Dividend Investing and Higher Interest Rates: BDCs vs. Mortgage REITs
http://seekingalpha.com/article/262972-dividend-investing-and-higher-interest-r
tes-bdcs-vs-mortgage-reits

It's the occasional land mine I want to avoid. I have stepped on enough of them
(chasing yield) over the years that it's easier to avoid them than flirt w/
that danger.

Thank's for your observations. Since the large (Too Big To Fail) banks are not
making any of the needed small business loans, it seems like the BDC's are a
very good source of funds for these companies.

i've followed BDCs for a few years, harkening back to when there was really
only ACAS & ALD. the industry has changed quite a bit since then.

as far as debt:equity, BDCs are effectively limited to ~0.75 ratio after what
happened in the credit crisis. in addition to being low cost, long tenure debt,
SBIC financing doesn't count against BDCs ratio. (not all BDCs have this
program in place). ARCC can effectively increase their leverage through their
Senior Loan Program partnered with GE finance. AINV may be looking to do
something similar with the Madison deal announced last week.

one thing to remember about BDCs, while they look to be fairly unlevered
relative to the rest of the financial sector, the companies they invest in
often have high leverage.

as far as dividend cuts, it became a necessity to closer align the payout with
NII... at least for AINV & FSC. ARCC cut their dividend in 2009, but has raised
in each of the most recent two quarters.

Finding BDCs as a value play is a good question as they all trade close to book
value and come with prescribed debt limits.

Buying a BDC is a bet on management. Evaluation of past performance in order to
gauge expectations for future performance. You can't really evaluate a BDCs
holdings, so you have to evaluate management.

BDCs grow only by increasing shares or increasing debt. You want to find BDCs
that have successfully managed growth while maintaining their dividend and
sales growth. A BDC that is producing growth while maintaing a low debt ratio
is favorable as they are able to move quickly when they find an opportunity and
have demonstrated their ability by their prior success.

A quick look at Yahoo is a good place to start....gives you the five year
dividend avg., debt to equity ratio and earnings growth. A good BDC bet has
demonstrated earnings and income growth and a stable div. without suffering
dilution of earnings when increasing shares or debt.

Some BDCs pay a monthly div. PSEC is my largest holding. I think it holds up
well in evaluating their payout history, their growth rate and their debt to
equity position. I don't know if its a value stock.

Hi Sergio -

Some good ideas on what to watch for when evaluating BDC's. I have added PSEC
to my BDC watch list. I noticed that PSEC has priced a $130M 5.375% 5.5 year
unsecured senior notes due 10/2017. Seems like pretty cheap money if after they
loan it they can get it back.

Have you ever seen a BDC make a loan where they receive an equity interest in
the company they make the loan to? Seems to me that if I can accumulate a
basket of small equity ownership as well as get my loan money back, that might
provide a nice "future" growth kicker.
