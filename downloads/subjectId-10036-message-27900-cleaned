Punching up my position in CODI.

It's a bdc which becomes controlling stockholder in the companies in which it
invests.

"During the June quarter, the Trust also completed a follow-on equity offering
and concurrent private placement for a combined total of 11,075,000 shares at
$16.00 per share, including the exercise of the underwriters' over- allotment
option, raising a total of approximately $168.7 million in net proceeds."

These buyers are underwater on those shares because the stock is selling today
@ ~$14.38.sh.

Today's buyer of this company gets a stock trading just slightly above stated
book value, with more cash than debt on the balance sheet, little long-term
debt (so far), and paying an apparent $.30/sh. dividend (annualized yield about
8.3%).

It's a dink bdc (market cap about 450M), and there's really not much public
history to the company.

Still, to me, the potential + div. while waiting, look very attractive.

From the 8/10 p.r.:

"Commenting on the quarter, Joe Massoud, CEO of Compass Diversified Trust,
stated 'During the second quarter, Compass Diversified Trust and its subsidiary
companies performed within our expectations. Second quarter deal flow also
remained robust as we continued to review a number of interesting acquisition
candidates. It is worth repeating our belief that a tightening in the debt
markets plays to our advantage, given our non-reliance on transaction specific
financing and our ability to consummate acquisitions quickly.'"

BJS, CPX, NBR.
I own a few stocks in energy and they are more or less plays on North American
NG:

BJS: pressure pumping for NG wells, near 52 week low.
NBR, Drilling, also international. Low valuation.
CPX. Well service. IPO'd in 2006. Rollup with strong growth and cheap
valuation.

My investment thesis: Energy equivalent for Gas @6$=36$/BOE. Oil at 70$+.
Something has to give. I like the picks and shovel plays more so than the

OK, I will ask the question: "At what price do real value investors sell?"

Let me clarify. I am mostly Buffettology investor. For me selling is simple: I
buy when I expect 15% conservative annual return, I sell when expected return
drops to ~5%. (No, it's not 10% rise in price... ;)).

But what about the REAL (TM) value investments. Let's say I buy company A for a
book value. When do I sell it? At 1.5 book? At 2x book? How about company B
that I bought for 1x cash? Do I sell it at 2xcash? 3x?

Let's assume for now that companies A and B are cigar butts and we have no
expectations that they will turn around and become great companies earning tons
of cash. When would you sell?

Let's try to keep this discussion thread somewhat on-topic without branching to
specific companies/areas, other investment strategies, etc. :)

Just to start, I think the goal would be to sell at 2x book and maybe 2x-3x
cash. But why should I believe the company would reach these levels if it's a
cigar butt? ;)

Hi Jurgis - For me the sell proposition is the most difficult as there are many
different measures to determine "fair value". My basic consideration is
earnings and a precursor to this is the company's ability to generate free flow
cash flow.

"Time is the enemy of the poor business and the friend of the great business.
If you have a business that's earning 20%-25% on equity, time is your friend.
But time is your enemy if your money is in a low return business

1998 Berkshire Annual Meeting

With these cigar-butt positions, the company usually has gone through some
"black swain" event and no longer generates free flow cash or have any
earnings. They either die or can rise from the dead like Halliburton Company
(HAL) in Dec 2001 with their asbestos litigation problems.

Management is key but it is very difficult to quantify other than looking at
their past history.

"At what price do real value investors sell?"....according to Buffet never as
long as the company continues to grow and generate good earnings.

"Your goal as an investor should simply be to purchase, at a rational price, a
part interest in an easily-understandable business whose earnings are virtually
certain to be materially higher five, ten and twenty years from now. Over time,
you will find only a few companies that meet these standards - so when you see
one that qualifies, you should buy a meaningful amount of stock. You must also
resist the temptation to stray from your guidelines: If you aren't willing to
own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.
Put together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward
over the years, and so also will the portfolio's market value."

Ahh, but you are talking about Buffettology investments here, not "cigar butt"
/ Graham (?) value investments. I assume there has to be some sell strategy for
these too. For example, TAVFX is a good classical value (not Buffettology)
investment fund and Marty sells things regularly. Of course, he loves
situations when his investment is acquired, but he sells some on price
appreciation too. The question is how does he decide when to sell? Is it
certain P/book, p/sales, p/e, something else?

I would like to hear more "value" investment sell strategies. Just let's keep
Buffettology and its "keep forever" out of this discussion. Buffettology is

Jurgis Bekepuris: I say selling decisions, like buying decisions, ought not
generally be made based on one metric. For selling on book value, it could
depend on what the business roe (return on that book value) is at the time the
sale is considered; and/or how long the person held the stock before seeing
gains; or if the stock was originally bought on the basis of reversion-to-mean
(so the sale presumably would not be until the stock has gone up to its mean
value), etc.

Buying below cash same. Of course once the stock price rises above cash value,
if the stock is a cigar butt, then margin-of-safety decreases and one will
consider selling. Again, based on factors and situation at the time.

As regards cigar butts, the idea is that nobody - or very few only - see a
catalyst or believe the company will improve its fortunes and maybe move up
from 1x to 2x b.v. or 1x cash to 2x cash. That's why such companies' stock
prices are cheap. And why it's best to buy a package of these companies as they
become available. Because many times, they won't improve their fortunes. With
cigar butts, one bets one's winners do better than the losses sustained from
the losers. Historically, that has worked. At least for Ben Graham and
disciples.

All jmo of course.

What is a 15% "conservative" annual return, and how does it differ from other

Paul,

I think you gave a fair and good answer. I guess it shows why I don't do much
"pure" ;) value investing: not only I have to buy at/below book/cash, but I
also need to estimate the future. I have some confidence of doing that for
companies with historically high ROE (Buffettology companies) but not generally
for cigar butt companies (historically spotty or low ROE). From this discussion
I think, I will stay with my core competence of investing mostly in
Buffettology companies and only go with cigar butts when I do see some
catalyst/future where they may increase from <1x to ~2x book/cash. Not many of
those, though. ;)

For your question:

-----------------------------

"For me selling is simple: I buy when I expect 15% conservative annual return,
I sell when expected return drops to ~5%."

What is a 15% "conservative" annual return, and how does it differ from other
types of 15% annual returns? When you are talking about a 15% annual return are
you saying that's the return YOU are expecting on your investment $, or is that
the return you are expecting the company to achieve on it's equity?
--------------------

I buy companies that show expected annual compounded rate of return of 15% in
Mike Burry's Buffettology spreadsheet. Specifically cell B31 of it. ;) It is
"conservative", since it uses the low PE in 10 years. Of course, the inputs for
Mike's spreadsheet (ROE and PE pretty much) have to be guessed/chosen by the
user. For most cases though, I just use 15% ROE and 15PE. :) The real work then
is choosing companies to which this can be applied. I only work with companies
that show >15% ROE for (most) of the 10 past years with low debt/equity ratios.
But this is just the quantitative part. I may relax it if the qualitative part
(company/field) is attractive or may tighten it if the company/field is dicey.
As you know, I don't buy financial and insurance companies.

Just to expand a bit on what I realized from this conversation (and since I
wrote it anyway):

Looking at p/book or p/cash in value investing carries a very simple meaning:
if you take a thing, not a business, p/book is a very simple measure to check
whether you are buying it for cheap or not. ;) Of course, there's a catch: if
you are paying price P1 for a thing and someone tells you that its book value
is P2>P1, you start to wonder why is the seller not selling it for P1? ;) But
market is much more complex for businesses, since you can't simply say "I sell
everything" and liquidate. It is still not a meaningless measure, since if you
can buy a business for < book (P/B<1), then at least theoretically management
can liquidate the company and pay you more than what you paid.

What people have correctly observed though, is that for company to sell at
P/B>1, there has to be some expectation that its business will prosper. You
cannot just expect a crappy company rise from P/B<1 to P/B>1.5 or so by some
miracle. One could expect for a company to rise from P/B<<<1 to P/B~=1 just
because of liquidation possibility, but even these events are rare and mostly
come with bankruptcy risk.

So it is very reasonable for people to ask: what are business prospects of a
company that you bought for P/B<1? And since my answer in a lot of cases is
"don't have a clue", I am not going do be doing much of P/B<1 investments going
forward.

BTW, homebuilders are an exception. ;) :P :/ 8} |\

Jurgis Bekepuris, about b.v.: I see it this way:

The complaint about book value is that it is not relevant to asset evaluation
(unless one is intimately familiar with the company and the innards of b.v.,
such as might be the CFO or other insiders), because stated book value either
could understate assets -- such as with real estate companies where the asset
might actually appreciate but the book value asset is net after subtracting out
depreciation - or the true value is overstated by b.v. because assets are
overstated -- the company acquired another company and overpaid for it, for
example. Some people argue that intangible assets should be subtracted from
stated book value. Others believe intangibles can have great value - the
franchise operation (intangible value) of Coke or American Express helped make
Mr. Buffett rich, for example.

For me, I want to do what works. I want to operate in the investing system in
which I find myself. That is, there are some sectors in which it is common for
analysts/business people/investors to weigh book value as a key to determining
value. These are companies that trade on book value. So when I realize I'm in
this venue, I look at book value too. For example, banks/insurance
companies/brokers are generally considered to be a good/great value if they can
be bought at stated book value. If I find such stocks I want to buy them. It's
not that I'm expecting a miracle and the stock for some specific reason, or
even for any reason, to move up from say 1x b.v. to say 1.5 b.v. It is that in
my experience and what other people - investors and academics - have written to
be their experience, the stocks of such 1x b.v. companies will over time, rise
and return to their mean b.v. number. So this is a way to invest that works.
Whether someone understands why it should not work, why b.v. is a poor
substitute of roic or dcf or any other of their logical metrics, that is not
reason enough for me to forsake using the tried-and-true b.v metric in my
evaluations of the appropriate companies. (Not saying it's an either/or thing -
roic, dcf, etc. have their place too.)

The relevance of book value comes up over and over again when people question
investors who use this metric. (We are old codgers from the '50's and '60's
-gg-) Perhaps it's just something a person either sees or doesn't see. Reminds
me of Mr. Buffett's buying a dollar for 50 cents, and how many either see it
immediately or don't see it all, don't get it, no matter how he describes that
value to them. Sometimes we just ignore or overlook stuff that we know might
work for us, but that might make us uncomfortable (buyng on b.v.?). On this
thread too, we see it occasionally when there are companies with no debt
selling below cash in their coffers, and yet you won't often see more than a
couple of people saying they're considering or interested in making even a
small purchase of the stock.

all the caveats that you and Madharry mentioned, it's not as if I heard about
P/B. ;)

I am still not happy though that in one post you claim that there has to be
something in the business that would ensure the rise from <1P/B to >1P/B and
then in this post you turn around and throw your arms in the air and say that
you don't care about the reasons, but in average, based on past experience and
research, companies do come from <1P/B to >1P/B. I would like to hear which one
of these two you really believe and practice in your investing, because the two
are very different:

- If it's something in a business that has to cause the rise from <1P/B to
>1P/B, then I have to really analyze the business and find out what it is going
to be. For most dinky businesses I can't do that. Perhaps others can, e.g.
Marty Whitman.

- If it's just a method and you buy a basket of <1P/B companies with not much
analysis of what the heck will cause them to rise over >1P/B, then OK, one
either agrees with the method or disagrees. And I don't have a problem with the
method. But assuming this is the method: when do you sell? Since this presumes
you did not analyze the business, you would have to have some kind of
quantitative point to sell. What would it be? 1.5P/B?

whatever. I've seen these macro comments for years and IMHO almost none of them
made money to any of the commentators.

it without consideration that it might get cheaper if some macro event occurs.

will wait for a better entry point on this one.

The dividends for the integrated oil companies have always been quite good

Yes, I use both depending on what the business is. As I say, for brokers,
banks, others, the stocks are usually cheap - buyable - when they trade at book
value. For some other businesses and the specific stocks therein, the stocks
can be cheap if they trade below book value and either there's a reason why the
stock might not decline further below book value (margin-of-safety), and/or
there's a reason why the stock might rise and revert to mean. Of course, I'm
going to seek out a specific reason wherever I can, but sometimes it's just or
primarily, formulaic. (e.g. some insurance buys recently)

I've no specific rule for selling based on book value numbers, other than to
review current p/bk and compare it with 10-year avg. p/bk, and looking to cut
position when p/bk seems high. Almost always a selling decision is based on a
number of factors. I have my difficulties overseeing a large number of stocks,
and generally it is an exogenous event that triggers me to look at this p/bk
metric for a sale decision. That is, I see the stock hits a new 12-mo. high (or
low), or perhaps I notice in the latest p.r. that earnings have dropped or
risen sharply, or I see heavy insider selling, or the stock just drops sharply
and deeply, etc. That prompts me to review the stock's metrics.

Not saying any of this is the best way or only way. Just my way.

Regarding BP... P/e is about 10

OK, I'm confused. Diluted normalized EPS for the last 4 quarters (according to
google) is 0.70 + 0.23 + 0.13 + 0.31 = 1.37/share. At the current price that
works out to a P/E of almost 48. The PE based upon operating cash (as reported
by google) is almost 52.

Obviously I'm looking at something wrong because google reports the P/E as 8.24

CHS posted 2nd quarter results. Unfortunately, they are not very good. I
lowered my expected ROE to 18% (which still might be too optimistic) and CHS is
still not a buy even with the current drop in price. I am looking for

Hi Paul - That's interesting about Seadrill. One of my larger investments SFL
(Ship Finance Intl) recently entered into a finance and profit sharring deal
with Seadrill for a new $210 million rig. The new rig was to be delivered in
July 2007.
http://www.shipfinance.org/IR/press_releases/1097955.shtml

According to SFL's press release:"...The rig will be chartered back to the
seller for 15 years on a bareboat basis, guaranteed by Seadrill. Seadrill is
among the world's leading offshore drilling contractors, with a market
capitalization of approximately $6 billion. The aggregate charter payments for
the first three years will be approximately $120 million, the following four
years will be approximately $77 million, and the last eight years will be
approximately $109 million...."

Seadrill has a contract w/ ExxonMobil Exploration valued at $82 million where
they will use this rig. It's a 400 day term agreement.

What's interesting is SFL has a profit sharing arrangement with Seadrill for
this rig. It's quite small but I guess I also have a "vested" interest in this
investment too. ("...In addition to the fixed charter rate, Ship Finance will
receive a profit split element of 4% above certain threshold levels, starting
January 1, 2009. During the charter period the charterer will have several
options to buy back the rig, and the first purchase option will be after 3
years at $142 million and the last purchase option after 15 years at $60
million...")

This was the first large investment for SFL outside their normal oil tanker
financing business and is potentially a new and profitable sector for new
financing opportunities.

SFL was formed in 2003 and spun-off from Frontline Ltd. (FRO) in June 2004.
According to this article, SFL is still considered to be undervalued
(http://seekingalpha.com/article/22729-ship-finance-international-the-big-boats

Kind of like Mr. Buffett's quote where he says something about a person could
be better off with the market closed, because when it's open, it just gives
everybody a chance to make more mistakes.
----

Even though I make a lot of wrong decisions, it's my hope/belief/expectation
that the decisions I do make turn out to be right enough times and make more
money for me in total than I lose from the plenty of bad or wrong decisions I
make.

I mean I have to believe that. And have to believe the results are satisfactory
for my risk/reward profile, or else by this time I should have or would have
just given up.

-------------
This relates to a discussion previously: Where are the biggest wrong decisions
made? Failure to sell a losing position? Failure to add to a losing position?
Failure to sell a winner? Being too concentrated? Being too diversified?
Listening to stock tips? Perhaps it's different for all of us.
For me, my biggest failures, imo and in my judgment, are related to this:
Failure to initiate a position when I coulda/shoulda. Perhaps it's just
hindsight bias. Still it's an issue for me, and what drives me sometimes to
increase my buy decisions. As I say, I would rather be in for a taste than be
out with nothing.

Buffett is also big on waiting at the plate as long as it takes to get a fat

pretty good feeling about each one.

Biggest wrong decisions - mine used to be taking big losses until I got
religion and clamped down on that hard. Next to that it would be stopping out
of good stocks on dips and not buying back into big runups (CLB is a great
example), followed by stocks I wasn't high enough on and never bought at all
before they ignited.

The biggest mistake to avoid is building big positions in stocks with sinking
fundamentals and loading up more as they plunge back to earth. Got over that

I'm still mulling this. Possible, maybe very possible my biggest losses are not
now from missed opportunities as I suspect, but rather from the classical error
of chasing dividend-rich stocks. Could be a market anomaly, because so many
high div. yielding stocks are being sold off as people seek safety now.
My biggest dollar loser now is CBF. An error of adding more as stock drops.

I don't like stops because I've found I can't or won't get back in. Which could
be understandable for me, since I follow so many stocks, it's easy for me to
get distracted or overlook something.
With your difficulties here you add anecdotal evidence to my belief it's not
that easy for anyone to get back in once stopped out. It's one of those things,
imo, that people say is easy to do, should be done, but in practice, for one
reason or another, unless somebody is trading/watching just a very, very few
stocks, it is not so easy.
With my value investor hat on, I don't like stops because I'd be wanting to
added to a stock that's become a better value(lower stock price), rather than
sell it for an unknown reason or only because the market has dragged the stock
down with it.

Jurgis Bekepuris. If you lack confidence, wouldn't that keep you from getting
into "a variety of 'not the best' ideas"? If you believed they were good ideas
when you purchased them, you had to have confidence, and if they were your
secondary choices, the error seems to me to be, not so much confidence related,
but rather picking the wrong stocks or wrong stocks at the wrong time.

----------------
I'm not one much for confidence or comfort as a criterion.

I can't be. I mean if I claim to be wrong many,many times - more than anyone
else around here -g-, - then how can I be confident in any of my picks? -gg-
(Confident in the sense of being positive about it, assured about it,
outspokenly recommending it, etc. As opposed to being confident I'll be wrong.)

Then again, I don't run a concentrated portfolio, so maybe being confident
isn't a necessity. I also get around it by position sizing. Less confident, the
fewer shares bought/owned.

Aside: Saying again, for me, my biggest winners (percentage) always seem to be
stocks that surprise me. My memory is that they have never been stocks I've
been very confident in when I purchased them.

My ideal portfolio would be between 10 and 20 stocks that I'd - just about -
never have to trade. I'm getting close, but sometimes I wonder if it's just
laziness. In the past, I was concerned that I traded out of good stocks during
an episode similar to what we're experiencing now. Now, I try to trade so that
it increases the quality of the portfolio - out with the bad, in with the good.

Chasing yield in a market like this is basically shopping for trouble. Yields

doug5y, what would you do with additional monies coming into your ideal
portfolio? Reinvest them in one or more of the same 10-20 stocks? Not sure what
excessive trading is for you, but if you had this concentrated of a portfolio,
and only decided to sell or really cut back on 3 or 4 stocks in such a market
as we see now, that would be altering maybe 15-40% of the portfolio. That could
be a big change.

I agree with you about an ideal portfolio. Nothing wrong with wanting to have
say 10 stocks and never having to trade them. Or maybe 10 or 20 stocks with
just rare trades out of or in to. I guess I never found the right 10-20 stocks,
or believed I could find the right stocks, or had the confidence to plop so
much money of a portfolio into such few positions. For me, my history is that
I've done worse in my earlier days with having only a few (20) stocks, than I
do now having with having many (>200)

Well these are all Canroys that you've mentioned, Grommit, so there could be
some contributing factors that lead to somewhat correlated moves in the stocks.
We know that each Canroy is different in the sense they operate in different
geographical regions, or their emphasis on gas or oil is different, their life
expectancies are different, their stated objectives/policies are different,
etc. Still there is common risk to these stocks - taxation policy, oil and gas
prices, etc.

The dividend(distribution) yields for the stocks you mentioned are:13.4%,
15.5%, 17;.1%, 14.4%, 15%. This per Yahoo before Canadian tax and currency
adjustment. That still leaves very high yields and does beg the questions -
what's going on, and can the distributions be sustained?

So here again, like you, to reduce business risk I am taking on a package of
these companies as part of a diversified portfolio of stocks. (I own all you
mentioned save PWI.) If these Canroys can hold on to their distributions, and I
can hold on through the volatility of stock movement, and if I don't get
suckered into overly purchasing such stocks on their drops, I figure even if I
sell the stocks in a couple of years at their current price, I'll have got the
good distributions and I'll have done ok.

My biggest mistake is selling too early. I sometimes found stocks that nobody
else seemed to care about and sold out when they reached my target price. Some
of them went on and doubled and even tripped after i sold. So i think I am
trying Paul's system to keep a stub position.

I sometimes regret not reacting faster especially to bad news. My rule is to
sell unexpected bad news and ask questions later, especially with large caps.
because chances are that a) I am not the only one caught at the wrong foot and
b) Once the big funds unload their millions of shares, the stock comes under
extended pressure.

The biggest advantage of small investors like us is that we can be nimble. I
can exit my position in most stocks within a minute if I am on the watch. The
big guys need to unload many million shares which i going to take them many
days to do so.

On the other hand I can step in and buy the deep dips that occur in a panicky
market like we have now. It does take guts but it has paid handsomely for me

"Reacting to bad news" I'm still working on a rule for that one. Haven't found
a consistent approach that I like. There's the way you've mentioned-- sell on
bad news quick as can be. Sort of like the Wall St. saying, 'your first loss is
your best loss'. So true when the stock continues its decline.

Some drops I've experienced have been really sharp and severe. I've read where
there are managers who say they never sell at this time. Because they say the
bad news is immediately fully reflected in the downward adjustment of the stock
price. It's too late to sell, they say. Recently, I've been following this
latter method with the big declines, but the results for me are inconsistent: a
few stocks continuing on a slow drop; some stocks stabilizing or rising after
the that first sharp low.

Regarding Citigroup. I hold too much Citigroup stock. I sold some when it hit
54$ but bought back when it hit around 50$. Needless to say I am now underwater
with most of my positions.

I think short term C is trouble, as there is going to be some fallout from the
subprime and leveraged loan crises. Although i am just guessing I suspect that
C has to write down 2B$ next quarter (assume 20B$ in bad loans that are worth
10% less), mostly from leveraged buyout commitments. I do think that C's
exposure from mortgages is less than average. Also investment bank earnings
will certainly suffer. All in all i think that next quarters earnings will be
way below forecast. I suspect that some is already baked in but who knows.

I do like C's diversity from it's far flung operations. Now more than 50% of
C's earnings come from abroad. C is strong in some parts of Asia and earnings
should grow quickly in this part of the world. But others are doing better at
home.

I did use the recent surge in BAC stock to reduce my position by 75% and have
reinvested some proceeds in WF. I am also pondering to put some funds into WB
and BCS. BCS is interesting because I see ABN going to RBS.L (which I also own)
and I think this will boost BCS stock. BCS also has some problem on it's own
but they do have a nice dividend and a cheap valuation.

I need to hold my nose to buy financial stocks, as I am probably already
overweighted in this sector but the valuations are cheap and i do not see the
nice dividends that many larger companies pay going away.

Well, the goal is to continually improve the quality of the portfolio. I follow
both the value thread, and keep an eye on the 50% Gains thread, and a few
others, so there's always new ideas bubbling up. I usually have a list of
candidates to invest in. For example, today I noted on this thread about
Timberwest suffering a low price due to current market conditions and a strike
in British Colombia with timber workers. TimberWest is owned by Third Avenue.
Timber will come back with the world economy the way it is, IMHO. I currently
have a position in TimberWest.

As well, from Dale's thread I've had my eye on ABB.

I've not sold anything during this downturn. I would be surprised to have 40%
cash as you suggest. But I suppose it's theoretically possible.

The reason I don't mention all the adds is that this isn't the CODI thread, and
it's not supposed to be the Paul Senior buy&sell thread. Everyone reading the
thread got a chance or three to see CODI and see if it was something they might
be interested in as a value pick. That's the purpose of the thread.

Disclaimer: CODI only used as an example of recent averaging in on a position.
There is NO relationship between the number of my buys to my knowledge or
confidence of CODI; I've no knowledge/belief/suspicion that CODI will be any
better or worse than any other stock I've ever bought, whether I've bought it

Good question. I don't know if I've mentioned it here, but Bijou Brigitte is
one I'm doubling up on. It's a German retailer with stores throughout Europe
and a foothold in the U.S. (down in Florida's Eurotrash region). The concept
(and history) is strikingly similar to Claire's, though they are much earlier
in the growth cycle. Dividend is over 5%, P/E is low teens, P/S is slightly
over 2. Available as an ADR on the pinks, symbol BIJBF.

Negatives:

Limited coverage - minimal investor relations and almost all in German (which I
don't speak). Businessweek has recently picked it up on their site, so at least
an English snapshot is available:
http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/snapshot/snapsho
.asp?symbol=BIJG.DE

Transition - The company was founded in 1963 and Friedrich Werner, the founder,
is approximately the age of Rowland Shaefer. His son (Roland Werner) is on the
BOD, unclear whether he is slotted to take over, or whether he is better or
worse equipped to do so than Rowland's daughters were to take over Claire's.

In sum, this is a company selling at a price that can be favorably compared to
the price that Claire's was bought up at in March. Granted, that was then, but
I still think Apollo got a good deal on a cash flow generator which had reached
saturation. Bijou Brigitte is also a no to low debt cash flow generator, and it
has not reached saturation. I think it's worth a premium to a potential buyer
based on cash flow alone, the growth prospects come for free.

I guess the better expression would be "second guessing" - when I get in, the

do, when I have bought the stock, I follow it more attentively than before
buying, so naturally I start to worry about its warts and whatnot. My
(partially) quantitative methodology of selling is my solution to this problem.
However, there are still loopholes - I HAVE to sell if business deteriorates
substantially from initial investment thesis and this is very hard to judge.
NTZ, PIR, FDP were examples from all sides of spectrum:

NTZ - I held way too long thinking that business has not changed and will come
back. I finally gave up after 3 years.
PIR - this one I sold maybe a bit too late, but I think I was on target that
business is going to hell.
FDP - I thought that business was going to hell and sold, while it turned
around and stock rallied.

I find it much harder to hold the "cigar butt" plays, since there I cannot be
sure if they will ever recover. That's why I started previous thread about

other vinyl-based building and home improvement products. Our products are used
in a diverse range of industrial and construction applications from high
performance plastics, pulp and paper production, packaging, chemical

Their business is suffering. And they're in the now dreaded "home improvement"
sector.

Reflecting that, their psr and b/bk numbers are now very low compared to their
past history. In nine of the past ten years GGC has been profitable. I'm
guessing they are taking steps (plant closure/consolidation) to remain so.

As regards insider buying, there've been a bunch of "dispositions", but on Aug
17 there was an insider direct purchase of 5000 shares -- at $17.25. (The
current stock price is a tad under $15/sh.) This is the first insider buy I

There are some noted value players in the stock (as reported by Yahoo): the

There's a 2% dividend yield for waiting.

thousands over the years. as to what they are i/m not willing to disclose them
at this time. of course sometimes they reverse themselves too so one can get
whipsawed. on a similar vein selling the stock that seems to be overvalued to
buy one that is clearly undervalued can backfire too. getting rid of apple in

CHS. I really like Bloomberg's Pimm Fox's shows. He interviews some interesting
and articulate stock analysts. Not that I know if they're right about their
selections though.

Good discussion, imo, yesterday on his show about women's retailers. As I
understand it there are about three aspects that are hurting the sector. First,
one of the retail chains is having substantial markdowns, and that is putting
pressure on the others' margins as they too are pressured. Secondly, the stocks
mentioned here in this subsector are the one's that have adult females as
customers. At this time, in a general sense, these women are spending their
clothing monies not on themselves, but on their kids during this back-to-school
time. Thirdly, mall traffic is generally down, so there's more competition for
the customers who are shopping. (All this according to the analyst.) These
companies might do better in time, as merchandise and fashions change and
customers begin returning. It's about having styles and merchandise that people
want.

It looks to me like these particular chains are all beat down. I'm not
interested in buying now (maybe I should be), but if I were, I'd buy a
package---CHS, TLB, and CWTR.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CHS,TLB,CWTR&d=s

--------
As far as teen retailers, the analyst liked ANF and also URBN. And this analyst
also liked TGT for its reasonably-priced and various popular clothing lines.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ANF,URBN,TGT&d=s

------------
This is the second analyst on the show whose favorite chains are the upscale
ones. This analyst likes TIF (Oops, should have added, but didn't, to my stub
position when stock recently dropped), SKS, and JWN. JWN (Nordstrom) was also
the favorite of the previous retail analyst Mr. Pimm interviewed. I've now
looked a little closer, and imo, JWN is not really a value play. However, given
that the rich are getting richer, that Nordstrom continues to expand, and that
my calculated fair-value p/e is about 16--- with the stock at a forward p/e of
14, I'm willing to step up for a few shares. I bought a little today for an
exploratory start.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TIF,SKS,JWN&d=s

-----------------
The analyst also mentioned a couple of stocks my market research team has come
across too. H&R is privately held. Zumiez, suggested by the analyst, was a
strong recommendation from my team (teenage family members). My 15-yr old
nephew recently repeated his suggestion to me to buy Zumiez; he also mentioned
again his favorite pick of Nvidia, a semiconductor supplier to the consumer
electronics products he likes. I patiently explained to him the stocks were too
expensive. Haha. Wrong and wrong. (i.e. wrong if you want to make money. Maybe,
Maybe right if you just want to be pedantical. ((Making money is better.)))
These stocks have turned out to be among the few stocks which continue to hit
new highs.

I hate when this happens. -g-. Sheesh. Missed 'em. As well, these kids must
look on me as a total incompetent about stocks and a geezer who knows nothing
about anything that's au courant: stock-picking seems so effortless and obvious
to them, it seems.

Paul,

CWTR is still way overpriced. "I should have shorted it" overpriced. There was
a Fool evaluation of its dismal 2Q results that was right on the money IMHO.
TLB is a toss up - it will all depend if they can deal with J.Jill. Talbots
stores are doing OKish.
CHS is tough one. It is a buy if they can go back to 20% ROE, but I am really
unsure they can. It's not a teenage outfit and once they drop out of the
"luxury" market, it's very tough to come back. And "middle" market is very
competitive and saturated.

I think the "back to school spending on kids so 2Q results are bad" explanation
is hogwash. This did not happen last year, why is this an explanation now?

ANF - it's way too late to buy this one, where were you for the last 5 years?
;) (You can also ask where I was - I bought and sold for stupid reason ages
ago.)
URBN - expensive.
TGT - not cheap either. Where did I miss that one for last 10 years? ;)

TIF is expensive and ROE'wise does not show very good results for a luxury
chain. Maybe that's the reason it dropped.
SKS - oh my god, how can have such stinking ROE while being a real luxury
retailer? Hmm, ok, their sales suck, that's why. :) Probably no one shops
there. :)
JWN - not sure. Really not sure. They have checkered history of results.

ZUMZ is very expensive. Very. But of course, you have to expect that from your
"hot growth teenage retailer". :)
NVDA - Again, you are probably way too late. The time to buy it was when it was
almost bankrupt. I think they reverse merged with their video card producer or
something. I should have realized that it and ATI (now part of AMD) had a good
duopoly. Of course, it was pure gamer play and the danger was that Intel or
someone will kill them from low end. It's still a danger although smaller
maybe. I think they have some low-price chips for integrated video but I doubt
they are very protected.

My loser's lament centers on chasing yield, too. When I was a beginning
investor, I read all the textbooks stressing the importance of using
compounding to grow your investment. I knew it was better to compound your
investment at 10% than to compound at your investment at 1%. So I set out to
find high dividend payers that would allow me to compound better. Boy was I
smart?

After looking through the weekend issue of Barrons I found 2 prefered stocks
yielding over 12% per year. This was back in the middle 1980s. The stocks were
First City Bank of Houston TX, and Financial Corporation of CA (the parent of
the old American Savings and Loan). I actually did a pretty good job of
researching the histories of these companies.

To the best of my recollection First City was suffering along with the rest of
TX from the 2 headed monster of 1) a crashing oil bidness and 2) spiralling
real estate values. A former Gov of TX, John Connolly had declared bankruptcy
and there was surprising despair throughout the state. I thought First City was
safe because it made profits most years (but not recently) and had been managed
by the same family for generations. Boy was I dumb, First City filed for
bankruptcy directly and away went my 12% compounding and my investment. OUCH.
Financial Corp followed First City into bankruptcy within the year. OUCH OUCH.

Loser's lament II. During the late 1990s the entire subprime auto and subprime
mortgage industry was falling off a cliff. Sound familiar. By this time I had
completed my schooling in Finance and was working in the field. Boy was I real
smart?

Again I did my research, but this time the research included financial
comparisons of most companies within the subprime industry, and I included a
survivabiliy metric. This metric still serves me well. I look at a company's
employee owners, inside and outside of managers and directors. I want every
employee to have an ownership stake. And I looked to see if a company paid a
CASH dividend.

Also, I looked at diversification of the company outside of the subprime
industry. The diversification can be into prime mortgages, industrial banking,
savings banks. Anything outside of subprime.

Again I bought a "good" candidate - Imperial Credit of Hawthorne CA. Within a
year its subprime subsidiary had filed for bankruptcy and I lost 1/2 my money
before I sold.

I notice a lot of this discussion centers on behavior elements. I confess to
being the moth that circles the porchlight at night until it dries out and
falls to the ground.

Watch out if they expand in the US, the track record of German retailers in the
US is not good

That doesn't seem to be a priority for them right now. They seem content to put
up a few stores in Florida so the Eurotrash kinder have somewhere to go when
Mutter und Vater come over.

OTOH, they do seem to be successfully expanding in Europe. Germany is still the
largest, but Spain and the Netherlands are moving up rapidly and France is
early in the game. They are also expanding in Eastern Europe, which I think is
a very promising area for them.

BTW, I assume the above comment isn't directed at food retailers. Otherwise,
even if we agree that Trader Joe's doesn't count, I think the folks at Aldi
might take exception.

Unlike some value investors, I don't buy trouble. I know some trouble yields
opportunity but I don't want to take on that risk/reward equation.

I want obscurity - unknown, unloved, disrespected and not allowed into the
finer establishments with the beautiful people....with a beautiful set of
numbers chugging along under that veil of anonymity.

My best winners have always come from that vein. If management screws up and
doesn't execute right, I chuck them over the side. I'd rather miss a reform
school graduate and focus on the merit scholars that haven't been recognized
yet.

Market panics like the last month were scary because even the very best

TLB. I decided I'll reconsider. When it's got down to current levels, it's
usually been ok to buy. That is, the last time it did, I didn't and I'm sorry I
didn't.

ANF. I assume at least a couple of us still hold ANF from the old days of Jim
Clarke liking it. One discussion at the time being something about it being or
not being worth $17 or $19/sh. --- maybe back in '01 or '02, if I recall.
(Stock closed today $78.70) Not sure what happened to me given some buying and
selling, but I still have shares from '06. I'll not add at current price.

TIF. Have read a media report of guards having to keep people from the store in
one Asian city because lines trying to get in are so long. NYC store always
busy whenever I check it out. Perhaps my experience not typical...or
representative. I've been in for a while and have sold some. Still have a small
stub purchased 5/'05.

SKS. Agree with you. I've never understood how they make money, because when
I've been to their upscale store during my lunch hours when I worked nearby,
there was never anybody else shopping in the place. A big store, just empty.

You are correct, i love Trader Joe's. that's an retail, concept with room for
expansion. The German discounters like Aldi and Lidl could show the US food

Bijou Brigitte can be tracked here. Stock is down quite a bit. Same store sales
are down this year. Expansion is mostly planned in France and Italy near term.

 "Reacting to bad news" I'm still working on a rule for that one. Haven't found
a consistent approach that I like. There's the way you've mentioned-- sell on
bad news quick as can be. Sort of like the Wall St. saying, 'your first loss is
your best loss'. So true when the stock continues its decline. 

Again it depends. For large cap stocks, selling as fast as you can is typically
a good answer. Some stocks with smaller capitalization can fall so fast and so
hard that it is not possible to get out ahead of the stampede.

I'm holding ANF also. Like you, I've bought and sold numerous times over the

moneymaker. The company does nothing but execute their business plan. Just
recently started opening stores internationally - don't know if that will ever
be big for them. I've got plenty and won't add here either.

No other retailers but not because of fears of the economy/subprime or
whatever.

Still holding CAKE and think its a buy here. Grand Lux looking like a

ANF I've been out of since about low 50s which was probably '04-'05. Made a
sick amount of money on a short term call option in early '04 which made up for
the early sell and basically made my year in '04.

Fantastic company, but I get very concerned that the management team has
completely turned over except for the CEO, and they are getting closer and
closer to saturation of their core concept. They have done a great job starting
new concepts. Still looks reasonably valued even at 76, though if they have a
misstep in this environment the stock is going to get killed.

Love the company, but if it went to my valuation again I'd be concerned because
its under different leadership.

You know what stock really surprised me is AEO. They've done just as well as
ANF even though I always viewed them as a second rate ANF. That has been a
great stock as well.

Haven't gotten a clear head shot at ANF since early '04.

There are zillions or retailers that are down hard now - ANF is not one of them
this round. This one usually gets killed in an environment like this. So whats
the one to buy this round. I own HD and RCII and BGP but not satisfied that any
of those is a pitch down the middle of the plate like ANF was in July '00, Oct.
'02, and early '04. After 7 years it seems the market has finally agreed with
us that this is one hell of a company. Which brings up Woody Allen's quote from
Annie Hall I believe "I wouldn't join a club that would have me as a member" -
once the market considers a company great, my game is up!

So what retailers have gotten killed? Is it DLIA? I don't see anything there. I
don't think its SHRP. Is it HD - too big probably. Is it PLCE? Is it CC? WMT is
sitting on a five year low, and that is one many many value investors pounded
the table to buy 1-2 years ago at higher prices. BGP is probably the most
interesting one I own and we've taken some lumps on this one, but its no sure
thing. If it works it could work big though.

I looked at PLCE and that one is scary. It's failing at fillings, failing at
loan covenants, failing at store remodelings for DIS. I am not sure why DIS
does not walk away in disgust. Perhaps they don't see a better alternative, so
maybe PLCE has some power. But I would not touch this one with a 10 foot pole.

No retailers attractive to me have been "killed" yet. It seems that market is
still assuming no recession and containment of subprime/credit. HD and WMT are
getting to OKish prices, but not there yet IMHO. I hold LIZ and AEO, but
neither is screaming buy. I will wait if TLB and CHS drop at least another
10-20%.

From:anializer
E.K.S. – I’m not so sure hunting out new additions to the 52 week low list is a
good way to invest here. Basically and in general, it means that those stocks
have not participated in the rebound, nor have they participated in a long
advance over the past year, and for whatever reason, the market does not
respect them. More often than not, new lows are a sign of weakness, not
strength, and very often there is a reason that the stock refuses to
participate in upside market gains.

That said, with the panic selling we saw a couple of weeks ago, many good
stocks were thrown out like babies with the bathwater and I believe a new 52
week low on August 16 might have been an anomaly in some cases creating value
opportunities. But I would also be very cautious and careful screening them.

On 52 week lows, MWA looks like a decent speculation on a technical basis to
me, however its negative tangible net worth is something of a detraction that
keeps me from getting too excited about it. Water was supposed to be the play,
and MWA has countered that in large part by refusing to confirm even a bounce
so far. Stocks with negative tangible net worth on the balance sheet concern
me, and thus far ROE and profit margin levels have not been good. Insiders
holding stipend amounts doesn’t say much either. That all said, one would think
at least a move to overhead resistance in the 13-14 area is forthcoming.

OMG was very close to a 52 week low when I picked it up recently and they have
very solid looking earnings and nice handsome balance sheet with plenty of
cash. Last week it started to bounce and it is now about 12 points above recent
lows at 49.40. I think the end of the market meltdown created the bottom of a
multi month decline in its share price on August 9 at 36.22. I was a bit late
in spotting that bargain with an August 24 entry, however I think it will do
better and re-challenge its all time highs over time. It’s a company with
stellar fundamentals, 416 mil in cash on the balance sheet, no debt, and it’s
also improving its earnings.

As far as 52 week lows I don't own but would consider taking a look at, there
are not many. Given the overall market’s condition and recent history, perhaps
6 month lows are more appropriate when considering a stock’s sell off from
June-July Highs. There are a good number of stocks at or near 6 month lows with
stellar fundamentals that are worth looking at. I see less in the 52 week low
camp.

On a side note, chasing dividend yields is not for me. It is a concern for some
of my managed accounts, and with that in mind, HTE looked attractive to me in
this area, so I got some. But for the most part, chasing dividend yield is a
sure fire way to incur loss, and more money has been lost in this endeavor than
any other I know of. Fat and juicy, non sustainable dividends are more often
than not offset by capital loss.

All just some thoughts to consider. 6 month lows apear to be where its at right
now.

I pretty much take a different approach to everything you've said in that post,
analizer.

1. Imo, buying value stocks does not mean to avoid stocks that
"have not participated in a long advance over the past year"
or that "the market does not respect...".

2. Value is keyed on price,imo. If the price is low enough, the value could be
there. New lows are not necessarily a sign of weakness for such stocks for
value buyers, imo. They can be a sign of strength if the margin-of-safety can
be figured. I hope so anyway: I'll be adding a few from the lows list to my
portfolio on Tuesday.

3. I have no idea what "MWA looks like a decent speculation on a technical
basis to me" means. I own MWA. Based on its current results, it looks
overvalued to me. (poor profit margins, poor roe, and poor sales increases,
according to Yahoo) I'd not be a buyer, nor would I add.

4. You apparently like to fish in the 6-month lows list vs. the 12-month lows
list. Where do you find a 6-month low list?

Dreman, Wellington, others have a position (according to Yahoo). Even at

Jmo, I could be wrong. As I have been so many,many times.

For me, I'll guess low price (low p/sales, relatively low p/e) of Best Buy

there's a better reversion-to-mean opp with something that's dropped quickly
