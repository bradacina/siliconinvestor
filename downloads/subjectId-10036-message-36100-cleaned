I just heard the gov. of washington on NPR. she said something like she faced a
deficit of $9 billion out of expect revenues of $39billion. now she faces an
additional deficit of $2.6 billion. She said that with the stimulus ending
states were facing a future budget deficit of some $180 billion in 2011. It
seems to me that under those circumstances increasing taxes to pay for health
care revisions and stopping the stimulus is gonna be hard to do without putting
this country into a depression. maybe i should go into the fiddle business.

>>Same with health care reform. Germany and France (which have the most
expensive health care system in Europe) can run their system at 10-11% of GNP
with a better average outcome . . .

Your view is a commonly held one. The following article from Lancet Oncology
suggest to me the comparison ought to be life expectancy from the point of
diagnosis of a life-threatening illness. On that basis, the U.S. system often
has the better outcome.

I just realized that the source I cited in my previous post requires a
membership. Within "fair use" guidelines I'll post a few quotes below (from
Lancet Oncology, August 21, 2007):

 Survival Rates Significantly Higher in United States Than in Europe 

"One of the reports compares the statistics from Europe with those from the
United States and shows that for most solid tumors, survival rates were
significantly higher in US patients than in European patients."

~~

"The age-adjusted 5-year survival rates for all cancers combined was 47.3% for
men and 55.8% for women, which is significantly lower than the estimates of
66.3% for men and 62.9% for women from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) program ( P < .001)."

"Survival was significantly higher in the United States for all solid tumors,
except testicular, stomach, and soft-tissue cancer, the authors report. The
greatest differences were seen in the major cancer sites: colon and rectum
(56.2% in Europe vs 65.5% in the United States), breast (79.0% vs 90.1%), and
prostate cancer (77.5% vs 99.3%), and this "probably represents differences in
the timeliness of diagnosis," they comment."

Hi Paul - You are right about CVX having some big finds and big projects. It
looks like CVX is selling a small percentage of their Australian Wheatstone
field interest and a small percentage of their onshore natural-gas processing
facilities banking the proceeds and gaining a 20 year partner.

Chevron signs liquefied-gas deal with Tokyo Electric
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chevron-signs-gas-deal-with-tokyo-electric-200
-12-05

Chevron Corp. said Saturday that its Australian subsidiary has made a deal with
the Tokyo Electric Power Co. to deliver 4.1 million tons of liquefied natural
gas per year, for up to 20 years, from the Wheatstone field in northwestern
Australia.

=================================================================

Analysts have pegged their forward PE at 10 which still seems like a good
value. I would like to see the company raise their dividend but it is still
pretty attractive yielding 3.5%.

Higher survival rates means that those who do get diagnosed have longer to
live.I agree it's an important metric. I am guessing that this does no include
those people that do not get diagnosed at all.
Also the question comes up why the life expectancy is lower in the US despite
earlier diagnosis (?), better treatment (?) -higher incident rat of life
threatening diseases in the US? Why?. Obviously there is more than one metric
to look at.

CFP. Okay, I looked. I been got before, but not this time, not with this one.

First of all, it is not a dividend, it is a distribution that a holder gets.

How can the distribution yield be so high? Maybe they use leverage? Apparently
not.

And look at the price vs. the NAV. The price is THAT much higher than NAV? And
of course the distribution is based on what they have to work with- the NAV,
not the stock price, so the distribution yield on NAV is very very high indeed.

What's going on here? As they say, you're getting a distribution. Essentially,
they're giving you you money back.

Not sure what this is or is called. Imo though, an investment, it isn't.

12/8/2009
Brandywine Realty Trust Announces Quarterly Dividends with a 50% Increase in
Common Share Dividend and Sets Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Release and
Conference Call
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Brandywine-Realty-Trust-prnews-3003964756.html?x=
&.v=1
RADNOR, Pa., Dec. 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:
BDN - News) announced today that its Board of Trustees has declared a quarterly
cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, payable on January 20, 2010 to holders
of record on January 6, 2010. The January 2010 $0.15 quarterly common share
dividend represents a 50% increase from the previous $0.10 quarterly dividend
paid in October 2009. The Board of Trustees also declared quarterly dividends
of $0.46875 and $0.460938 for the 7.50% Series C Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Shares and 7.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares,
respectively, each payable on January 15, 2010 to holders of record on December
30, 2009 of the Series C and Series D Preferred Shares. The preferred share
distributions are unchanged from previous amounts.

============================================================

That's a pretty good sign w/ the dividend increase on the common. That brings
the common yield up to 6%. The new dividend amount is only 34% ($0.15 vs $0.44)
of what they had previously paid per quarter from 2001-2008.

Re: Companhia Paranaense de Energia (ELP)
New York Community Bancorp Inc. (NYB)
Fluor Corporation (FLR)

ELP stock hit a 52wk high. Sold some April $22.5 calls (covered calls) so I
could receive the dividend in April and lock in some of the recent gains. 1/2
of the position is now hedged.

Sold some NYB April $13 Puts (received $1.10/share premium) to up my exposure
in this core holding. NYB will issue 60 million shares priced at $13/share to
close Friday Dec 11, 2009. This will raise their capital ratios and satisfy the
FDIC requirements for the AmTrust asset purchase. The transaction s/b accretive
to earnings by $0.05/share - $0.10/share so their $1.00/share dividend is safe
(their dividend payout ratio is now under 100% from 112% and analysts see it
moving to the low 90% during the next 6-12 months). Many of the analysts have
upped their price target to $14/share-$17/share. The company plans to grow
their niche multi-family mortgage business and w/ an average 36 month turnover
rate in these mortgages, future loans placed provide expanding margins and
better earnings.

SUPERVALU INC (NYSE: SVU) and NOKIA CP ADS (NYSE: NOK) are looking quite
attractive "Value" buys. I am waiting to see lower lows on lower volume and may
look to build positions by selling some out of the money naked Puts. I am
looking to start buying both companies around $12/share. SVU's PE is around 6
but w/ such terrible industry earnings the market is pricing a worst case
recovery. Even if future earnings are 1/2 last year's earnings, the downside
risk appears to be quite low.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SVU,NOK&d=s

The best approach at this point (and w/ year end selling) is to wait for the
institutions to close out their losing positions and see if some scraps can be
picked up at fireside sale prices.

Too many people agree on this thread that Fluor Corporation (FLR) has bottomed
(of course I am one of the first in at 10% higher prices) so I am looking for a
continued sell off perhaps as low as $37.00/share. That's where I will pick up
a few more shares. FLR seems to be selling off more than some of the other
infrastructure picks.

;compare=si+jec;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logsc

These infrastructure stocks move fast to the upside when the institutional
buying kicks in. I will be peeling off shares in SI to build my FLR position.

I'll reach up for more WLFC at current price.

This is a thinly-traded stock with a big bid-ask spread.

The stock is up in past couple of days after company announced it intends to
buy back 30% of outstanding shares over the next three years. On the one hand,
if this comes to pass, it may mean the float, 5M shares, and the outstanding
shares, 9M shares, will be reduced enough to make the stock even more volatile.
Otoh, the buybacks may serve to put a floor under the price of the stock.

Again, I like the stock because the p/e is 5-6; the company's posted profits
every year past ten; the roe is somewhere between 10-13% now, on a stated book
value of $20.2. The stated book value has generally increased yearly (past ten
years). The stock, dropping today to $13.39/sh, is at .66x stated bv.

====
If the company is buying back their common shares, it would seem to me they'd
also want to call in their preferred. I looked, the yield's about 9%, the
preferred can't be called until '11, and the call price ($10) is only a few
cents away from the current preferred stock price ($9.90). I view this as
meaning the preferred might be a safer bet now, a bet on the yield for a year
or so, but no chance for a capital gain. I own the preferred, will not add, and
will expect it to be called in '11.

re DSX - i like the balance sheet but i am not sure about the valuation.

Balance sheet: 250M in cash versus approx 250M$ in debt so net debt is zero.
This looks pretty good.

Valuation: 80M shares out and book value is 970M$ or approx. 12$/share. So this
is one of the shippers that is trading above tangible book. NAV of ships has
fallen and in most cases it seems that asset value has fallen below stated
bookm (certainly true for ships acquired during the last few years). So i am
wondering if I pay more than NAV at current valuations (which i think is not a
good idea).

Dividend is cut to zero so the yield perspective is mute.

Hi Paul - I somewhat agree with you and concluded to maintain my small LLY
position (because I like the dividend). I covered my naked Put position for a
nice gain and might re-establish if LLY trades back down to $32. I sold the
April $29.00 Put (for $1.50/share premium) a few months back when LLY traded
around $33. I also sold out my AMLN holdings as LLY has a joint venture with
them.

I am considering closing my JNJ position and selling covered calls on my BMY
holdings. Both have had an excellent run from their recent lows. I may hold on
for a few more trading days this year but there really are not too many days
left this year to trade.

I am not too sure which Pharmaceuticals provides the best value proposition at
this stage in the cycle (especially with the pending health care legislation).
What's on your watch list? ABT got away from me at $45/share and now at
$54/share I am not compelled to buy at the current price even for a starter

Pass again on CKR (CKE Restaurants). I keep looking at it because I have
competitor JACK. CKR always seems to be the better bet-- it's dominant, more
aggressive in trying new things, better food (maybe), more diversified, maybe
better managed in some respects. CKR pays a dividend, JACK does not.

Every time I look, I come back to JACK though. JACK has been profitable each of
the past ten years, CKR six of ten; JACK has higher net profit margins; also
JACK has generally higher roe with less d/e; further, JACK has a lower p/e.

Also, I like the potential kicker that JACK has with its "Mexican" Qudoba
restaurants. If they ever spun these out, it might attract quite a bit of
attention as people maybe compare it to McDonald's making Chipotle a
stand-alone.

I'll continue to prefer JACK and am adding to it as it keeps dropping.

FWIW I went to a Qdoba a couple of months back. The only reason I did was
because it was close. IMHO it is a shell of Chipotle. Presentation, food
quality and food temperature just not there compared to CMG, at least at this
location.
OT but related to the prior discussion (Suma are you listening?) I went to a
Burger King with my DW the other day (again because it was there), and she got
a salad with "grilled" chicken. That salad was really poor - some dried out
veggies in a small tray over the lettuce, which you dumped on to lettuce
underneath. The "grilled" chicken had been grilled (somewhat) before, then
frozen, I'm guessing. It came to DW in a bag after being microwaved, none too
appealing. She barely touched this culinary delight.
Compare this to the McD's salads, which are nicely prepared and presented, and
tasty, no wonder the golden arches guys are doing better in this space.

UTX added that it expects 2010 EPS to grow between 7-13%, or a range of
$4.40-4.65, while revenues are expected to be between $54-55 billion, a 2-4%
increase versus the prior year. Analysts are expecting the company to post 2010
EPS of $4.53 and revenues of $53.3 billion. UTX also reaffirmed its 2009
full-year earnings forecast...."

================================================================

Paul good pick on UTX it has outperformed my HON.

UTX is a Low Yield/High Growth company.
http://seekingalpha.com/article/177317-17-stocks-for-the-three-major-categories
of-dividend-investing?source=article_sb_popular
I would classify dividend stocks with a yield less than 2.5% and dividend
growth greater than 7.5% in this group. Low yield and high growth dividend
stocks are the other extreme of high yield and low growth stocks. Their
long-term risk is associated with growing the yield-on-cost over time. If the
dividend growth rate is cut, the investor’s future earnings and yield will also
be cut.

I know you peeled off a few shares recently. I assume you maintain your
position until you feel it is no longer trading at a "Value" price. I guess you
monitor the future dividend payouts and when the dividend growth slows down,
this might be a red flag to close out the position.

Great "value" pick and too bad I did not follow you in on this one.

Hi Jack - Any suggestions on U.S. companies that participate in the design and
manufacture of Nuclear Power facilities? GE got out of the business many years
ago and I am not too sure if the U.S. is even working on the next generation
technology. I was not able to find any pure plays but it seems that one or more
of the following companies have products and/or technology that are needed in
this sector.:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SI,FLR,ABB,UTX,HON&d=s

The only thing I came up with was France's government owned agency that designs
and builds their power plants. I believe this agency/company evolved by
acquiring the intellectual property of GE's nuclear power plant division.

Any ideas?

Shaw Beats Fluor to Nukes Contract
http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2009/11/23/shaw-beats-fluor-to-nucl
ar-contract/?mod=yahoobarrons

The company has $11.00/share cash after backing out their long term debt with a
stated BV of $17.00/share. SHAW sells at 1.7x BV and analysts have a forward PE
of 10. Their operating margins are similar to FLR but both their ROE and ROI do
not match FLR's performance (FLR must have a better management team). SHAW is
1/3 the market cap of FLR and has business segments that overlap with FLR.

Analysts have Shaw's forward PE at 10 below FLR's estimate of 11.5.

Insider James Bernhard (CEO) bought 250K shares Nov 3, 2009 at prices between
$25.40 and $26.00/share and now holds 526K shares.

SHAW would make a good acquisition candidate with all that cash on hand and is
one of only a few companies in the world with nuclear power expertise. I could
see a merger with FLR or a foreign international firm acquiring the company to
obtain their technical expertise (maybe a Chinese sovereign fund).

Here is an overview from their Web Site that discusses their lines of business.
http://www.shawgrp.com/markets
SHAW does have a big service and maintenance business which generates over
$6.00/share free flow cash.

The company seems undervalued based on these different measures. With the
concern of Global warming and the future carbon tax implications, more nuclear
power plants will need to be built (especially in China). SHAW should be the
beneficiary of this growth.

HONEYWELL INTL INC (NYSE: HON) , SIEMENS A G ADR (NYSE: SI), Shaw Group Inc.
(SHAW) and Fluor Corporation (FLR) make up my basket of infrastructure
companies in my portfolio. I plan to build up my SHAW and FLR positions as the
opportunity presents itself.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FLR,SHAW,HON,SI&d=s

RE:CVX & COP divergence in stock price

Peeled off a few shares of Chevron Corp. (CVX) and bought more ConocoPhillips
(COP). Over the past five years COP tracked the price of CVX but since
September 2008 there has been a divergence to where CVX is now valued 40% more
than COP.

;compare=cvx;indicator=split+ke_sd+volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalue

I am not too sure why this is, perhaps because of COP's NG exposure or the lack
of performance in their refinery division. As a result, I have been peeling off
shares of CVX and buying shares of COP. I now have equal weights of both
companies in the portfolio which now rank 3rd and 4th position in my top 10
holdings. COP's dividend was recently increased (10/09) and now yields 4% which
is a 0.5% higher yield than CVX. Both companies are good core holdings and have
performed well for me.

RE: Shaw Group Inc. (SHAW)

(1886 Westinghouse Electric Company:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westinghouse_Electric_Company ).
- 1997 Westinghouse Electric Company changes name to CBS Corporation.
- 1997 the company sells non-nuclear power generation unit to Siemens AG
- 1998 the company CBS Corporation sells its nuclear business to BNFL (British
Nuclear Fuels Limited)
- 2000 the ABB Group's nuclear power business, formerly Combustion Engineering
(CE), was purchased by BNFL and merged into Westinghouse Electric Company.
- In Feb 2006 Westinghouse was sold by BNFL to Toshiba for $5.4B (
http://pittsburgh.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2006/02/06/daily3.html ).
- In August 2008 The Shaw Group Inc. (SHAW) entered into a joint venture with
Westinghouse Electric Company (a subsidiary of Toshiba) to manufacture a "next
generation" nuclear reactor module called the AP1000.

It's too bad that the U.S. has fallen behind in developing the next generation
nuclear technology. It seems that The SHAW Group is one of the only U.S. owned
companies with interest in this technology. The Shaw Group has a licensing &
maintenance interest in every new AP1000 they build and place in service.

This is the best pure "Nuclear" play I can find. The Shaw Group Inc. (SHAW)
appears to be selling at a value price if indeed the AP1000 reactor module
becomes the next "new standard" used especially for new power plants built in
the U.S.. Four new plants are already scheduled to be built in China with SHAW
supplying these reactor modules.

Westinghouse, Shaw to Form Joint Venture Company to Manufacture Modules for

From the article:"...“Westinghouse and our consortium partner The Shaw Group

than 14 plants here in the United States. Other markets are fast emerging,” he
said. “It is imperative, therefore, that we move decisively to develop the

Preparations for Six AP1000s
11 November 2009
World Nuclear News
www.world-nuclear-news.org

Chinese planners are moving ahead with three new nuclear power plants based on
AP1000 reactors - the first to be developed after technology transfer from
Westinghouse.

The US-based reactor vendor is already constructing pairs of AP1000 reactors in
China with its partner Shaw at Sanmen and Haiyang, but these new units are to
be the first built independently after the technology transfer that was part of
Westinghouse's contract. They are also China's first nuclear power plants not
located on the coast.

The sites are Xian'ning, Hubei province, Tauhuajing in Hunan, and Pengze in
Jiangxi. All have been given the go-ahead for final design and initial
construction work, such as site clearance, for the first two reactors at each
site. Main construction is set to start on all three sites around this time
next year, with commercial operation following around 2015.

A further wave of AP1000 build will include at least one other pair of units at
each of the above sites, while up to six new locations are already pencilled in
for AP1000 development.

Each of the latest sites is to be led by a different Chinese firm: Xian'ning by
China Guangdong Nuclear Company; Taohuajing by China National Nuclear Company;
and Pengze by China Power Investment Corporation. Transferral of the AP1000
technology is being carried out by State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation,
which will now take the engineering lead on new AP1000s.

Hey Paul,

Re: Hotel Reits -

I think it's tough to say we're out of the woods yet. There could be more money
to be made in Hotel Reits, but it's more of a speculation that things are going
to get better quickly. I believe the airlines are up due to the drop in oil
prices.

Personally, I'm out flying every other week and I'm not seeing the demand
pickup yet. There are a lot fewer flights and we're in the slow season. It will
be interesting to see what happens in the spring.

In regards to Hotel REITS, I owned many earlier this year individually, but
have sold them off. It's tricky to value them at these levels because many of
them are keeping certain properties while letting others go to default. BEE and
SPPR always look interesting to me as they haven't made the run like some
others, but I currently feel like there are better values out there in other
sectors. That being said, I have around 15% of my overall portfolio in a Reit
mutual fund (401k) and one reason I've sold off my hotel reits is because I'm
not wanting to get overexposed to Reits.

There is value still out there, I think, it's just hard to find which
individual stocks are still undervalued.

re Shaw - if you take tangible book value only Shaw's valuation is pretty
comparable to FLR. Also, if I take 2010 estimates, the PE is more like 12x. i
also look at P/S EV/EBITDA and don't see a compelling valuation difference
between the two.
Also, i found Shaws income statement with all the adjustments for Westinghouse
hard to grasp. I don't even like the nuclear reactor business too much because
it's very much at the wimp of local politics and having watched the build out
of nuclear reactors stopped halfway through construction in Germany, I think
it's risky business. So for me it's seems that buying Shaw when I have the
option to buy FLR at the same valuation is more of a diworsification than
anything else at this point.

Here is my AMLJ DD update...

AMLJ is a rapidly growing defense electronics company that IMO has good chances
of becoming a multi-bagger. Here is why:

1. AMLJ recently posted fiscal Q2'10 (ending September 30th) diluted EPS of
$0.05. Annualizing that number gives them a PE of 7 which is quite inexpensive.
http://siliconinvestor.com/nfvda/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=43069456

2. AMLJ has announced $3.92M in large orders since July 7.
http://siliconinvestor.com/nfvda/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=43128519
http://siliconinvestor.com/nfvda/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=44362465
http://siliconinvestor.com/nfvda/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=43066370

3. Their web site indicates that they recently started a second shift and are
in the process of training a third shift. That implies to me that it is likely
they will have sequential increases in EPS for several quarters.
http://siliconinvestor.com/nfvda/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=44481978

4. The growth in large part is happening because their $30M UAV (Unmanned
Aeriel Vehicles) contract with Raytheon has entered the production stage. The
$30M in revenue is going to be delivered over the next 5 years. They have
additional UAV programs that they are working on going forward which will drive
additional growth. In fact, they received a pre-production order for $220K in
October for one of the additional UAV programs.
http://siliconinvestor.com/nfvda/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=43069754

ct_Award.htm
http://siliconinvestor.com/nfvda/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=43066370

5. I estimate that fiscal Q3'10 (December) will have diluted EPS that exceeds
the fiscal Q2'10 diluted EPS, fiscal Q3'10 diluted EPS will be
$0.065-$0.070/share, and calendar year 2010 diluted EPS will be in the range of
$0.30-$0.40. If I use the midpoint of my calendar year 2010 range they are
trading at a forward PE of 4!
http://siliconinvestor.com/nfvda/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=44365577

6. They have a pristine balance sheet and are building huge amounts of cash. As
of the end of the Fiscal Q2'09 (September) they have $2.3M of cash. Book value
is now in excess of $1.30/share.

7. Their Mica-Tech subsidiary provides a product for data acquisition and
control of the electric power grid via satellite (Smart Grid). This division is
currently running at essentially break even and provides potential for future
growth as the division is in it's infancy.

8. AMLJ has a stock buyback in place.

I understand the extra for the stuff on your son's burger, because those items,
essentially, are already available "bundled" at extra cost on another burger
offering. So, why give those for free, when you make people pay extra for them

I have occasionally enjoyed the $1 whopper junior in the past, but I've read
franchisees don't like them and other items on the $1 menu. Profit margins
there are razor thin, if anything. I guess that's a problem if people come in

I noticed too that the nat gas pipelines seem to have moved today on the XOM

Lot of speculative talk now on what nat gas co would be acquired next. I don't
see making bets on one or a number of them to profit from jumping in ahead of
an acquirer. Too unpredictable, too many companies are possible acquisition
candidates, and it may be too presumptive to assume that CVX or COP or somebody
else will now be a buyer. OTOH, I remember back in the old days, when somebody
(XOM?) decided they ought to diversify and get into the mining business. So
pretty soon several of the big oil companies had bought out big mining
companies. Although that of course did not work out well for any of the
acquirers, it shows there's a precedent for one big oil company to make a big
acquisition and other big oil companies to then follow with THEIR copycat

Still sniffing around NITE, CEO Tom Joyce was on Mad Money last night. I would
not call him optimistic near term. I did like the fact that the reason
(according to Joyce) that profits may be pressured near term is because of
money spent to meet NITE's growth needs in the future.
Cramer did bring up the possibility of NITE being taken over, IMHO he was
implying that NITE would be an attractive takeover candidate. Joyce said
something like "the phone hasn't been ringing off the hook," nor did he rule
out that possibility.

RE: XOM; MSFT; CNP

Followed you in for a little XOM. Peeled off a few shares of MSFT to book
recent gains. Hedged CNP with May $15 calls. Stock has had a good run from
$10.00, dividend secure w/ 5.3% yield (xdividend in Feb). Option premium juices
div yield an extra 1.5%. Strategy is to buy more CNP at $12.50 and sell shares
$15.00.

FLR, SHAW & JEC all up big.

Looking at PFE and HRP as possible new buys at current levels. No hurry to
chase. Div yields look nice too.

DPDW continues to sign new contracts but stock can not hold any recent highs.
Still waiting for my lottery ticket to hit.
