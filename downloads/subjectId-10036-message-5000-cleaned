HEY I GOT #5000

Thanks Joseph - I meant the 1000 richest having the personal assets of 50
million regular people, if I've got that right.

That 'fact' or 'estimate' would have a powerful effect on the 'wealth effect'
calculation, I would think.

Very interesting.

You guys keep buying, you should ask yourself: who's selling? Also a very
powerful statement.

<<1000 richest having the personal assets of 50 million regular people>>

I had 10 mil "average investors", meaning about 10 mil "upper middle class",
assets roughly between $100k and 1 mil. There are certainly 50 mil Americans
with negative combined net assets.

One should also be careful to distinguish assets from income. Income
distribution, which does not include unrealized cap gains, is much more
equatable.

FWIW: Switched out of HOT into FCH.

Starwood (HOT) changed their structure and dividend policy (reduced it). I find
more attractive now FCH (Felcor Suite REIT). Not that I can understand or
evaluate REITS, 'upscale', 'full service' hotels (which is what these two REITS
seem to consist of), or understand well FFO and/or other REIT terminology.
However FCH, selling at 20+ with a stated bv of 25 (which may or may not be
reflective of anything), heavy (IMO) insider buying, trading near its lows
(seems like it hits new lows every day), and about a 11% dividend yield --
well, it's worth establishing a very small position in a tax-deferred account.
Bought some more today at 20.1/8

Careful using book value on real estate companies, but you're fishing in
the right pond. I already own LHO, a small hotel REIT with a 12%
dividend yield. Only problem is I bought it at a 10 1/2% dividend yield.
Today I bought Patriot American (PAH) looking for a quickie. Major
announcement today which should reverse the downtrend, and even if it
doesn't, it yields 10%. Arguably has asset value of twice the share
price.

As for Cummins Engine, lousy management, lousy industry. The kind of company
where an earnings miss is not a "surprise" - the real surprise would be if they
made a number. But the last analyst threw in the towel today, so you've got
virtually unanimous low expectations, and the price looks right - below book
value. But watch out - these guys write off book value faster than you can
calculate it. And the truck cycle still hasn't broken down. I think its early,

I'm trying to find a good site that would provide indexes for food costs for
restaurants. Does anyone invest in restaurants here, and does anyone watch this
kind of stuff? (In particular I'm looking at re-entering a position in a local
steakhouse I like (RDHS-Logan's Roadhouse- not a value stock) and would like to
get behind food costs trends if I could)

Thanks in advance for any help.

Here's what I've been buying recently:

NITE - Market maker, major player in internet stock trading. Reasonable
valuation IMO. I posted earlier about this one.

YORK - Energy producer. Currently selling below book. Recently announced
exiting money losing energy brokering business. What's left will be profitable,
perhaps earning estimated over $1/share in near future giving a forward PE of
under 4..

CREAF- Creative Labs. Dominant maker of computer sound cards. Controls the
Sound Blaster standard. Selling at PE of about 5. Recent comments by Intel
indicate PC demand may be stronger than expected. CREAF recently introduced new
"Live" product which recieved strong demand. Is also major DVD supplier, which
could reach critical mass soon.

On RDHS, you would think dropping food commodity prices would be good for these
companies. You might also want to look at EATS in your review, which I own.
They appear to be similar-sized companies. I
believe EATS shows food costs as a percent of sales in its SEC filings, which
is not a direct measure.

The statistically cheapest stock that I have seen in years was last week when
electronic distributor NUHC at 3 1/2 was briefly selling at 70% of the excess
of current assets over ALL liabilities. Making $.10 per quarter, no inventory
issues, out of favor industry, 10% or so of $250 million sales. Unfortunately,
I thought it was a good buy at book value of $6 many months ago.

My point is not to recommend it now, back above $4, but to point out that I
believe that stocks generally should carry much higher risk premiums now and
there may be many companies gradually joining them in valuation as more and
more issues fall out of favor. I am really worried that this selloff will turn
into a 1973-74 type slaughter.

Jim: Well, looks like you got a quick profit in PAH. Seems like a lot of REITS
are up today and looks like on higher vol. than yesterday (per Yahoo). You've
mentioned LHO a couple of times, and each time I've tried to reason myself into
taking a small position. But I get overwhelmed. Market cap is small - they seem
to have about 12 upscale properties - maybe too small to be reliable or to get
a following to generate potential stock buyer interest. On the other hand, HOT
was tiny once too. Plus the dividend for LHO 12%. That seems too good to be
true. That's better than the long run record of the market (if LHO can sustain
the dividend). Plus they have insider buys and are rated #13 in the Yahoo REIT
category. (There're over 100 REITs in there -- overwhelming the number and the
different sectors - industrial, shopping centers, Class A, Class B, health,
etc. etc.) I don't really like to rely on Yahoo's analyst recommendations, but
it's really hard for me to get a feel for these RE businesses, so maybe I will
have to rely on 'professionals'.
LHO has a management arm that controls or manages the REIT. This management arm
is, of course, the same people (I think) who are in the REIT. Plus this
management does foreign investing also. If they are deal makers and not
business people, that's generally been a clue for me that I might have trouble
with the investment. I see there's another company, MHX, which seems similar
(but much more aggressive perhaps). It has separated its management and REIT
into two stock classes and it has a 12% dividend rate also. (Div. rate was 14%+
at one point). Also, both companies are similar in that they are new (under 3
years).

I'll think some more on LHO. The dividend is very attractive, and I can buy
below what the insiders just recently purchased. (Cripes, there are a ton of
REITs like that now it seems) One very strong point for me though, is that you
recommend it. (Well maybe not recommend it to me exactly, but you are buying or
have bought it for yourself.). And you don't make that many different buys
(compared to me -ggg-), so I want to make sure I give some effort to see what
you are suggesting.

I'm not really sure what your expectation is for the stock (I know you want it
to recover to at least your buy points); for me, I think I will expect that
profits I get will be more dividend than capital appreciation, and that I will
need to hold this stock a while. Paul

re: USEC
I know at least several people bought USEC based on my recommendation in July,

in yesterday's New York Times accusing the company and the government of
covering up major safety violations in order to get the deal done. Took the
stock down a point, but it came back on a down day today. The impetus for the
article was Ralph Nadar and an anti-nuclear energy organization. The article
was irresponsible. Does USEC produce a hazardous and scary product? Duh. Has
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission set out a number of things the company must
do to achieve full compliance. Yes. Were these items fully disclosed, along
with the expenditures required to fulfill the requirements? Yes. Were they in
my valuation? Yes. I stand by my previous statements. This stock has been an
absolute gem through this market "correction"

Anybody notice what Buffett said yesterday. He is holding $9 billion in cash,
which implies he's done a bit of selling. And, more important, he said he will
certainly reinvest that money on a "dramatic" market drop. What I take from
that is that he thinks we ain't seen nothin' yet. The implication was clearly

had to believe there was over 40% downside, and been pretty damn sure of that,

Just read the Raymond James 9/16 LHO report, and I like it, even though numbers
came down for this Q by FFO .03-.04. Analyst considers this a one time event
because of disruption caused by NW pilot's strike at Bloomington, Mn. Radisson.
'98 FFO estimate $2.14, '99 $2.40 (which would yield a div. of $1.68. assuming
a payout of 70% of FFO). Upscale properties, not as subject to intense price
competition as mid price (Hampton Inns, etc.) motels. NAV per this report
$20.00. One downside is lack of diversity (only 12 properties) and that
unlikely to increase unless LHO share price improves, whereby more shares could
be issued to enable acquisitions.

Thread,

Thought I'd mention this. I was running a net-net screen and a few bigger
companies are starting to appear. Some of these are:

Silicon Valley Group (SVGI) semi-equips $10 3/8
Speedfam (SFAM) semi-equip $13 3/4
Oak Technology (OAKT) semiconductors $3
Sequent Computer (SQNT) computer hardware $7 1/2
Kinross Gold (KGC) gold and silver $2
Carmax (KMX) retail (used cars) $6.50
In Focus (INFS) computer peripherals $4 1/2
Brooks Automation (BRKS) semi-equip $9

(Warning; The information in the database I use is somewhat dated - including
price information. Sometimes it is outright wrong. Verify for you own use.)

The market caps on these range from $90 million to $330 million. This is a
totally different breed of net-net than the microcap that has been showing up
until now.

USU is also showing up as a net-net with net curr assets less liabilities of
around $19/share. But I am unable to find a recent balance sheet to confirm.
Jim, can you cofirm or deny this? The 3-3-98 balance sheet shown in the
database has $2.9 billion of current assets and $1 billion of total liabilities
on the 100M shares.

The number of semiconductor companies showing up is leading me to examine the
semi-equip sector again in light of the somewhat more upbeat recent view of PC
demand. The "Semi-Equips: Buy when blood is running in the street" has some
posters who are on top of the industry and have a value slant on things.

i was looking at avp (avon) it's @ same price it was back in 94.
funny it takes many years to buy and hold and one could be wiped off
in a few weeks.

i felt so bad for avon share holders.

positive
ceo was nbr saying their growth rate is approx 16-18% (not bad condsider intel
growth rate 17%).

AVP ceo thought asian customers, value oriented, will shift from EL to AVP. AVP
trading below market mulitple and below in it's industry multiple. seeing today
muliti year lows. the stock was 30 in 1994 and today 28.

EL (esteLauder) is not even at 52 week low, higher mulitple, company
announced stock buy back and was up 4.

AVP ceo, ex G ceo, has purchased AVP shares in the open market at much higher
price from here.
either the ceo is too optimistic or he really sees value in his company .
Negative: only 35% of their business is domestic. mostly internationl.

I have collected lots of other material on avon if anyone is intrested. My
problem
is since i don't understand the business
i sort of watch and wonder and some times these stock make a huge
jump after i wonder why they are so low.
take PVN for example. last weekend i studied banks and could not understand
why PVN was affected so badly but then i thought the street knows the best and
i better not jump into something i don't understand. so all my work goes to

Tim, re: PFG. The story is a sad one :>(

Yes, I still own PFG (too embarassed to tell you where I started my position,
but I bought more at 12, 10, 5, 3, and 1+. Never before have I experienced such
a rapid drop-YIKES! Way underwater on this one. Lot of money being made past
few weeks though by day traders as stock has bounced around 2-4. But that's not
me.

Nice overview of situation in 9/14/98 WSJ. Company has tried to grow through
acquisitions ala Conseco. But they've over extended themselves either through
too much debt or by their (in)ability to integrate and manage their operations
and acquitions. Investor confidence has waned (dramatically!) as they've failed
to secure additional funds from an outside source, from their failure to sell
one of their operations at the price they expected, from subsequent or
consequent earnings losses, and from the resultant insurance investigations,
ratings agency downgrades, and change of PFG management.

In this, as well as other insurance stocks I follow or own, a key valuation
statistic for me is book value. It's become very difficult (for me as well as
most others, I think)to understand what the PFG bv actually is. I'm
disappointed to read in the WSJ, that an analyst following the company believes
it to be about $8.1/2 to maybe 12.1/4 per sh. (depending on how some goodwill
items are treated). Now the company, according to the WSJ and my interpretation
of some of the recent co. announcements is trying to sell some of these assets
"to pay off its steep debt". This adds more uncertainty.

If I did not already own more than I wanted of PFG, I would add to my position
at the stock's current 2.3/8 price. Over time, with a new management team, they
should be able to resolve some of their issues, and I see no reason why the
stock wouldn't trade for 2/3 of book. This would be a double from the current
price (assuming bv really is about 8+). I've been thinking of buying more at
these (low 2)levels. What's holding me back is, as I say, that I already own
more than I'd like, and I've been so wrong on this stock. Paul Senior

From:Daniel Chisholm

What I found particularly interesting about SBUX is its contrast with other
"consumer brand franchise" companies that Buffett would be willing to pay a
(seemingly) steep price for.

I personally like Starbucks' coffee, think their stores are quite nice, and do
not dispute those who say that it is in a leadership position, etc. The fact
that they are successful, and do not advertise, is certainly worth reflecting
on.

For the sake of analyzing the stock as a short candidate, I am willing to
concede every qualitative judgement w.r.t. the stock to the bulls (e.g., I'll
assume that barriers to entry are high, that business opportunities will
continue to exist and will grow, etc.) This is a "margin of safety" required
for analyzing a short.

Personally, I find their prices to be quite high, yet they seem to add enough
psychological "value" to the product (the whole "experience"), that they get
away with charging outrageously high (IMO) prices for their product. So I
honestly think that they are in some way adding a certain amount of "Starbucks
value" that makes people willing to pay premium prices for a cup of coffee, and
one should not dismiss this when analyzing the value of the stock.

And yet, their margins are thin. And correspondingly, their ROE is modest.

The thing that really drove home the short case to me is that in spite of all
the good things about Starbucks, the simple fact is that they are to a large
extent, a (bull) stock market phenomenon.

What I think I have learned is that a high ROE is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for paying up for Buffett-type franchises.

Any comments on this conclusion? Since this is a Value thread,I've tried to
steer things towards staying on topic ;-)

I think your topic (SBUX) merits discussion on the short side, just as much as
any discussion of stocks value investors find attractive to purchase. And, come

FWIW, my girlfriend and I were switching planes in Charlotte one day a little

Buffett would ask two questions about Starbucks.
1) Can I be certain Starbucks will have the same dominant market position in 10
years that it does today?
2) Can I be certain its product will have the same market position in 10 years
that it does today?

I think you would be hard pressed to answer either of these questions in the
affirmative. With Coke, Gillette or Wrigley you can.

Valuation follows from that. If the business is low margin and low ROE now, it
ain't going to get better, and is likely to get much worse. Is gourmet coffee a
fad that will go the way of, what from the 80s - cocaine for example? Also,
don't forget that Starbucks is in perhaps the worst business known to man.
McDonalds is the only one in the restaurant business that has made money
consistently over time. Remember Boston Chicken.

One of the most concerning things about the stock market right now is
that the average forecasted EPS for the September quarter for the
major companies is flat or down from last year. This hasn't happened
in almost a decade. The Wall St. Journal today had an article about
this (http://interactive.wsj.com/articles/SB90638557455016000.htm).
One of the interesting statements was:
>>>>>>>
A few big oil, financial and technology companies are expected to post
heavy earnings declines, pulling the overall earnings number down. But
the median company is expected to show about 9% earnings growth,
according to both IBES and First Call.
<<<<<<<
Anyway, my dad asked me what the story was for the "consumer"
companies. I researched this out of curiosity. Here's what I found.
The first number is Zach's estimate for this quarter. The second is
what Marketguide shows for September last year. It's not rigorous but
it's interesting. It's a mixed bag.

this year's vs last
P&G .79 v .78 +1%
Gillette .41 v .31 +32%
Coca Cola .40 v .40 +0%
Disney .17 v .20 -15%
Wrigley .66 v .60 +10%
Avon .30 v .26 +15%
Philipp Morris .83 v .58 +43%
Kellogg .38 v .50 -24%
Pepsi .41 v .35 +17%
Campbell .59 v .58 +2%
Sara Lee .49 v .46 +7%
Colgate .64 v .58 +10%
Budweiser .83 v .79 +5%
Heinz .59 v .51 +16%

The mean percentage gain is about 8.5 percent (even if you throw out
the outliers Kellogg and Philipp Morris).

This is my response to a post on the Buffetology thread which I thought might
be a useful post here too.

Let me have some fun with this one - I am going to repost the whole thing,
otherwise the value investors on this thread will think I'm having delusions.
This is the investor who has to sell before I will call a bottom.

<<Also, re:<Oh, but Dell's earnings are going to double in two or three years.
The risk is that EVEN IF YOU ARE RIGHT, and even if the stock trades at a high
multiple of 30-35 at that time, you've lost money. And if you are notright,
you're dead. >
1. How would I lose money if it doubled in the time period you
mentioned? If it doubles, I have twice as much money? where does the
loss come from?
2. Not to provoke a long tirade, but what is your argument for Dow 6000?
IS it global depression?
If this is the case what is to keep Coke and Gillette from going down
further and even Berkshire?
Are you saying sell all stocks and get into cash NOW?
In my view a long bear market is provoked by the so-called external
shock like an oil embargo, a quadrupling of the price of oil in the 70s.
What is the external shock to the market in your view?
jhg >>

1. Dell trades at about 75 times earnings. Even if earnings double in three
years, and the stock winds up trading at a high multiple of 30 times those
earnings, which it won't, you've lost money. This is pretty simple math. This
is not my scenario, by the way. I did like the article, and have great respect
for the business model. But so does Compaq, IBM, and every other potential
competitor. The barriers to entry are weak, which means be careful.

2. Argument for Dow 6000. Hmm. I won't do the long tirade. But the return on
equity on the Dow today is something like 19%, a historic high. The historical
average is 11%. That tells me there is some downside in earnings. And you are
paying a multiple of over 20x on those earnings, which are arguably at a peak.
So take that multiple down to the historical average of 15x, and take the ROE
down to - I'll give you 15%, which is generous, and you've got downside risk of
what, 20% on earnings and 25% on the multiple. That tells me the downside risk
is well below 6000. More like 4500-5000.

And I guess that will answer the next question. I'd pay about $40 for Coke, and
I do like the company, understand the business and want to own it. Gillette is
probably getting close. High 20s? So what stops those from dropping lower?
Absolutely nothing. And Berkshire too is still way higher than I would buy it
for. Cash is nice right now. Like Buffett, I have no intention of being in cash
when the next bull market starts, but I'm in no hurry.

3. What's the catalyst? Is it global depression? Have you read a newspaper
lately? At least half the world is in a depression now. Where do you think
Caterpillar was going to sell its next excavator, or Coke sell its next bottle
of soda, and Gillette sell its next razor. These markets were their growth
story a year ago. And it is spreading every day - just ask anybody you know in
Brazil. How big a catalyst do you need? And there is no sign it is stopping.

Buffett told us last week that he is a) more in cash than he has been in a long
time, and b) he implied that he has not even started buying this "dip" because
he is expecting something much worse. I agree with him 100% if this is what he
was saying. There is a notion now that Buffett just buys good businesses, he
doesn't time the market. That is garbage. Buffett has made fortunes timing the
market since the 1950s. And I don't know of a case where he has been wrong on a
major market call. He is making one now. And so am I. As I have said on other
threads, I will buy big name stocks to hold forever when:
1) Internet stocks are in single digits...no speculation
2) Abbey Joseph Cohen has been completely discredited..."buy the dips" is
ridiculed.
3) We have seen massive sales of mutual funds.
4) We see a bear on the cover of Business Week.

That probably means Dow 5500 at least...at most rather.

I can't resist responding to this: The big cap names have been mispriced for
years now. The market is paying a huge premium for the combination of perceived
liquidity and little bankruptcy risk. The reality is the just about everything
else is in the midst of a bear market. IMHO
right now the big caps and long term bonds are not being priced by economic
decisions but as consumer items. While I have not been a buyer of either of
these products, I do not presume to know when they will tank. But I do believe
that it more likely that other segments of the beaten down market will rise
first and as people gain more confidence in the smaller names which yield
dividends and turn profits
these luxury items will be priced more realistically. The one big name that I
believe is an exception to this is MO. Having said this I recognize that you

Paul-

I'm buying JOE, CNSO, MORP, and QUIP.

MORP (Moore Products Co.) makes instrumentation and control systems for
industry. We use their systems to control chemical plants and are very
satisfied with them. Very low P/E, been around for years, well respected in
industry, making good money, a good software company as much as anything.

QUIP (Quipp) makes stacker machines for newspapers. My newspaper customers (the
other half of my business) use them extensively. Popular opinion says that the
internet will wipe out the newspaper industry by sometime next week. I see a
lot of papers still undertaking tremendous capital projects so that they can
add more color and strategically advertise to targeted audiences. This requires
smarter inserting machines and stackers (Quipp). Quipp has around $8 cash per
share, great earnings (which may slow a bit due to project cycles), and a $16
or so share price. Looks like a no-brainer, but then it has for over a year.

I wrote something about CNSO, the tassel maker, a while back but nobody was
interested. I like the company and the husband and wife accountants who are the
owner/managers. Their earnings are improving and the market hasn't noticed.

I also mentioned JOE recently here with no replies. Seems to me that their
price is not far from that of a couple years ago, but their management has
their act together. James called the rise and fall of JOE like a pro, but I
don't see any reason that his original buy logic of a year ago shouldn't hold
now, except that the recent fall has soured many investors on the stock. Smells
like value to me.

I agree with you on JOE. The value is just as much there as when I first
bought. One big thing is different though. The stock is in the down cycle, not
the up cycle. Not the business, the stock. When I bought it it was moving from
undiscovered to discovered to loved. Now were are in the loved to disappointing
to ignored cycle. It may take a while to get moving again. I could be wrong,
but this is a different game. I am not saying don't buy it, but I am saying
that the case is most definitely not the same as when I first bought it in late
1996, because then it had a huge catalyst to realize the value. When the
catalyst fully fired, I sold. Now there are at least several REITs out there
with a similar discount to NAV, zero catalyst, but they have a 10% dividend. I
continue to follow the stock closely, and when a catalyst forms, I'll be back.

Hi James,

This is slightly off-topic but only slightly.

First, do you think the speech by Greenspan was influenced by the near default
of Long-Term Capital? On the face of it LTC's troubles hint at a possibly much
larger problem with foreign and domestic markets. Could this have been the
final shove to induce a rate cut?

Second, could you briefly explain how the bail-out occurred? I've heard people
say that it was a "Fed bailout" but it appears that the only people infusing
money are the very banks who invested in the fund. So they were protecting
their own money and in return received substantial control over its future use.
I'm not sure where tax-payer money was used.

I realize you work at a completely different type of investment firm but I
value your opinion and felt it might be germaine to the overall market
condition. Afterall, I moved into a high cash position right alongside you back
when things were still moving up and couldn't be more pleased.

And for Paul's question about whether people are buying anything the answer is
"kinda" <g>. I placed a bunch of GTC orders for a few companies (DSWLF, NH,
CSE, CRUS, OMPT, X,...) but the only one that got filled was USU for $14. Not

Paul,

I owned SCRA for a couple of months about 18 months ago, unfortunately selling
it for a quick profit and missing the huge move up to 44.

I've recently repurchased half of the position I had then, and think I should
try to hold it long-term, to see if it returns to 44 someday, or surpasses it.
(When I bought it the first time, the target was 30/share, which was obviously
surpassed by almost 50%, before the huge correction).

There's another stock that I think may be a good value, though I haven't yet
bought any. That's KAMNA. I wish I had bought some at 13 a few weeks ago,
though 15 3/4 doesn't look bad either. I think their earnings in the past year
included extraordinary gains, so their P/E is probably really around 12. They
have a 2.60% yield. It's surprising that there's a billion-dollar aircraft
company that most people have never heard of. I think it's possible that it
will eventually be bought out, as there has been so much consolidation in that
industry.

Jim, I guess I bought your NH stock today. I couldn't resist a price under $10.
Selling at book value, 20% or so of sales, over 5.5% dividend, 4 X last years
earnings and 5 X this. Stock is selling as if they were losing money, but based
on today's news they are far from it. Also far more of their costs should be
denominated in other than dollars than US companies, so their competitive
position improves
relative to their competitors with the strong dollar.

I look at it at these levels as giving a superior current income return to
Treasuries but will be over $20 in the next recovery in 2-5 years. Also note
Fiat has stepped up to the plate to buy $250,000,000 stock, which is 1/2 what

re SCRA: Well, we all worry about something or other. The high debt doesn't
bother me. It's not out of line with comparables (shipping, container,
high-cap.intensive co's.) Nor am I concerned about the upscale hotels being
empty in the alleged soon-to-be seen recession or depression.
I don't like the cyclical nature of the container business, the possibility
that China can control container prices by controlling manufacturing (the
supply) of these things. Another negative IMO is that SCRA hovercraft
operations and English railroad operations are dependent on securing contracts
with government agencies, and are also dependent IMO on people's use (or non
use) of the Chunnel.
Finally, I don't like that SCRA makes profit forecasts that they don't meet;
then fails IMO to adequately explain why they didn't meet them and why they
think stockholders should believe the next forecast they put out.

That being said, SCRA year-over-year earnings have increased substantially
recently (They predicted a double although they didn't make it). And they are
forecasting very good (IMO) earnings growth again this year. The dividend
should offer some downside protection (but that doesn't seem to be happening
now!). I've followed the stock a little, on and off for maybe 10-15 years. My
last go 'round started with purchases in the teens, and I've not made any sales
in past few years (so I'm living through the drop from 44 to about 24 now.) I
attribute the current SCRA stock decline to the general decline we are seeing
in the USA and also the decline I am seeing in other English companies in which
I have positions (such as BAB and BOX). (SCRA is not 'officially' based in
England, but it's pretty British to me -g-.)

I intend to add again to my position in SCRA next week if I can get some at 24
or better level. FWIW. Paul Senior

dj800: About your CIEN. As I say, I like your choice of VTS as a value stock,
so I'll just assume that CIEN is equally as good, and that I am missing some
knowledge about CIEN or not seeing what you are seeing with it. For me, I see
no compelling reason to buy. Sure price has dropped a huge bunch. Yes fiber
optics is important and growing -- yes, that's a given. But have you checked
out CIEN competition? I thought Corning (GLW) was the dominant player. They're
certainly bigger.

Plenty of other companies seem to offer more than CIEN on a price/sales,
price/book, price/cashflow, earnings growth rate. So I assume you've found some
of them as well, yet still believe CIEN offers the better buy. And I assume
that this would be a long term hold for you - or at least until CIEN reaches
20? Perhaps I need to think some more about "potential". You've said CIEN has
growth "potential" and upside "potential". Looks like I am focusing more on the
risk. I think in this kind of market, to buy a stock, either the buyer should
know it and be comfortable with it (esp. if it is declining) (and by that I
mean not rely on what some writer or CEO says)-- or else, the stock should have
some feature on which one can hang one's hat, esp. if the stock tanks even
more. Like it has a very good dividend, or its pe is at 15 year low, or
cyclical stock is at its low, or p/cf is very low, or great and continuing
sales growth (maybe that is CIEN?) Just my opinion. Not saying that CIEN won't
go back up to 20, 40, 80--- just that I can't see the favorable risk/reward.

one way to look at it is that cien tlab merger fell through when cien
management WOULDN't accept another down tick in the offer from TLAB. I think
internally, management sees value NORTH of $30 here (when the dust settles).
Don't forget, the original offer from TLAB (very smart) was NORTH of $40 wasn't
it? Cou'ld the underlying business CHANGE that much in a month or so? I doubt
it. I expect indsiders to step up at this level.

re: merger call-offs and CIEN.

Yes, a person would think that an acquiring co's bid would set the value of the
company. And that things don't change so much in a month or so. But these are
assumptions; I've found I've been burned many times with 'em. For example,
Mellon directors rejecting buyout bid at 90; stock gradually declining to its
present 57. Kemet directors rejecting bid of $25, stock rising to 30 slowly
dropping to 9+. Perhaps the fundamentals did change, maybe they didn't.
Regardless, stock prices did decline and stay down. (I've seen the same thing
with selling homes, but that's another story.)

For dj8000 interested in buying/holding CIEN, my opinion would be that if you
(Twister) are recommending (buying) CIEN, that would be a very positive sign. I
defer to your knowledge and insights here Twister.

For me, it's very hard to make the leap that CIEN is a value stock. Maybe it
has value to an acquirer, but I can't figure it. If the value is strategic or
even of tactical importance, then there is, IMO, a premium that the acquiring
company is very willing to pay. And I think that that premium is a "value"
above the value as determined by a Ben Graham kind of analysis. This premium
value is too tough for me to figure. But I think you are right in saying that
tracking insider buys will provide a clue as to what CIEN executives think
about this if they step up their buys.

paul, in a zd article, they are intimating the chairman is stepping up and
buying stock. I think cien doesn't lend itself well to a Graham type of
analysis. The value of cien will be realized by a strategic or tactical buyer,
like a tlab or csco. cien has an excellent product but it requires the deep
pockets of a larger company to realize its potential. I'm a buyer in this
range, and lower.

Paul,

I am buying now, but since most of my stuff is not value I try to refrain from
posting too much of my activity here.

Recently bought some ITWO (high tech, Gorilla Game stock) Very pricey, I'm
gambling that they'll win in a proprietary software space with high switching
costs. Involved w/ supply chain management and e-commerce and has close ties
with Oracle. ITWO is not a value stock, but I wanted to post to show that at
least somebody is adding to several positions in this market 

Also, bought Creative Labs (CREAF), dominant in computer sound industry. I like
their sound cards and speaker systems, and they're cheap. I don't think Intel
will usurp computer sound just yet. This is a dog, uhh ... I mean value stock
IMO. I think this has a higher risk profile than I like for a dog, but their
product is good, and when I go to the computer store their products dominate
the shelf space for audio.

Also have been adding to a position in YORK. They own several power plants and
cogeneration facilities in US and abroad. Also are involved in alternative
energy to a (small) degree w/ efforts in wind generation. (Some states
legislate that a certain portion of energy be of the "alternative" variety and
this trend may spread). Revenue growth is tremendous, but they've yet to get
margins up to par. As they stop the rapid expansion I'm betting margins
improve. This is a value stock IMO.

I'll just bring back a few stocks from recent posts to jog anyone who might
want to make some additional comments:

PSO: Maybe Jim Clarke bought a block (10,000 sh) or perhaps everybody here
jumped in on Jurgis's earnings post and/or Jim's response -g-. Stock up 7/8
today to over 7.

JOE: Has moved 10% off its lows, I notice. Ended some weird (IMO) joint venture
with the NFL week or so ago.

AVP: At its 12 month low. Co. says it is still on target to meet '98 and '99
earnings estimates. Sonki posted it and was a buyer, I think, at these levels.

SBUX: A caffeine headache day for the posters here who were short. Stock up 5
as Starbucks announces a marketing agreement with Kraft to expand shelf
presence.

CIEN: is up 1/4. Beats being down 1/4 -g-.

Gambling stocks: Some concern that Georges could hurt casino business in
Mississippi, etc. HET (Harrahs), et. al. might be affected.

SFC: Close to its low. These subprime lenders.repackagers are all hurting from
what I can tell. (The stocks of the companies I'm looking at are all down
anyway.)

LHO, HOT, FCH: Hotel REITS. If you haven't noticed, there's been a bounce from
lows for a very large number of REITs - hotel, apartment, commercial. Some
people coming into these investments just recently are seeing capital gains as
well as good dividends. Since - from what I can see - prices are still way
below highs or even midpoints, people who purchased earlier may not be so
fortunate.

BC. There were several million share block trades in mid Sept. for Brunswick.
Stock now is 13.1/2 up from lows of 12. I see now thatAMF (symbol PIN) is also
trading near its lows.

CSE, AG, NH: Starting to see those projected earnings dropping. CSE and AG have
announced layoffs. CSE now recommended by pro value investor (value stock fund)
in this month's Worth mag. All three stocks up a little today.

Sorry if I've left out anybody's fav. These were the only stocks/categories I
saw that had some discussion going past couple of weeks.

Re: CREAF

The danger for creative does not come from Intel but from Microsoft. Back in
the days of dos and Win3.X there was no original standard for audio built into
the operating system. This meant that anyone who made a sound card had to come
up with there own way to process sound. During that time Creative made a name
for itself with the best and most reliable system and that system slowly became
a standard. Check on an old game and it will specify Sounblaster or Adlib
compatible sound card required. If you look on games today you see that it is
just a sound card that is required, or if there is a standard it is Direct
Sound or Direct3d. Direct Sound and Direct3d are standards built into Win95/98,
therefore Creative has lost its position as a standard and whatever licensing
royalties they may have recieved in the past. They are therefore losing market
share esp in the OEM business. However that being said their new Live sound
card is impressive. Also they still have a mind share for old computer users
like me, but that is a shrinking minority so they now have to compete on
quality and price... JMHO

Also, currently, when I buy a stock, my time horizon is 1 year, since 1. day

3. potential is potential, it need time.

after one year, i will review the investment and decide what to do next. short

Alex,

Thanks for CREAF comments, especially mentioning MSFT threat. On some of the
"techie" boards and newgroups there is what I perceive to be a credible threat
the Intel will move sound processing into the CPU or motherboard. Similar
concerns exist regarding graphics cards, many of which are trading at low
multiples, like Trident or SIII.

I think the Environmental Audio in the "Live" card is a technology that
Creative will control for now, and it seems that entertainment developers will
utilize. I think optimal use of the Environmental Audio can be programmed into
software titles, leading me to believe this is proprietary in nature, although
other cards may offer similar compatibility (ala AMD to INTC).

As you can tell, I'm not "up" on the technology, but on the audio newsgroups
the concensus is that the card coupled with the 3-D speakers produces a great
effect, and if you want it, buy a "Live" card. (There is a competing 3D audio
chip from Aureal, so CREAF is not alone here, but I get feeling developers will
follow CREAF).

Again, appreciate the comments.

For those interested in LHO (which I am) - my simplistic calculation of how
Georges may affect the company is to the tune of less than a penny this Q. This
is due to the fact that they have a property in the Fla. Keys. Any comments or
follow up on this most appreciated.
Also, for the thread, when is the allure of the 5% long bond going to end.
Interesting that the spread between munis and treasuries is at, or close to, an
historical low.
As someone said on Squawk Box yesterday, "why should I invest in the bond at a
PE of 20, when I can acquire some great companies at PEs of 10 or less?"

The answer to the question is that you shouldn't invest in the long bond at a
P/E of 20 if the good company at a P/E of 10 is not going to a P/E of 4. New
Holland is instructive here, where some good folks on this thread thought it
was worth buying at a P/E of 8, only to see it drop to a P/E of 4. It was only
when Fiat stepped up to the plate to buy 1/2 the public stock that I felt OK
buying it. Not many companies will have that kind of support.

dj8000, thanks for info. regarding regional airlines. Article was very bullish
on outlook for those regional airline companies and their stocks. And it could
happen too.
For me, this looks like about where I entered my round trip on KLM. My bet is
that I can take the trip again, but I'll pay more here for some more shares.
(And maybe this next time I'll learn to take some profits.) KLM is hurting from
the NW Airline strike, KLM's big exposure to Indonesia, the general avoidance
and selling of airline stocks, the general drop in European ADR/NYSE stocks,
the Am. Air/British Air etc. very strong code sharing/etc. partnership, the
dollar strength (?), and KLM's high union component.
Gee, I wouldn't want to even speculate on what other problems KLM could be
having. Some positives though are that they dominate Amersterdam Airport, they
have a strong and growing freight business, they are ordering new jets, and
they pay a reasonable dividend. In my opinion they are likely to be around a
while. Being that they are a Dutch company, my bet also includes some
unmeasurable component that says they ought also to be good world traders (as
some Dutch people are/were historically --- don't mean to stereotype any
group), and so KLM management which deals in world markets will be sensitive
and alert to capitalize on business opportunities wherever they might find
them.
This is not an argument for anybody to invest in KLM. Just that I'm comfortable
with the investment. Successful with it--- no. I know nothing about the
regional airlines the article mentioned. I'd be nervous that if they were doing
really well, the majors would go after their lunches. But the risk maybe is
that the economy tanks and maybe their stocks will too. I think (hope) that KLM
has the where-with-all to last through the alleged recession that we are about
to see. In any case, I'd guess your wait-and-see approach for now to these
regionals is very reasonable. JMO, Paul.

"'Tis the part of a wise man to keep himself today for tomorrow, and not
venture all his eggs in one basket." Cervantes.

Well, I've got lots of baskets -g-. They keep shrinking in size though. Man,
when a couple of stocks you own suddenly drop 4-5 points in a day, that's
enough to make you want to empty those baskets, and every basket, real quick
-g-.

Still looks like a good day to buy stocks though: For me anyway, I've been
buying early this morning:

LHO (Yet again.) I see no reports by LHO of hurricane damage. Such prelim
reports should have been out by now if there was material damage. Possibly some
earnings loss though if people's travel plans are postponed or switched. If Jim
Clarke recommends and holds this one, that's 50% of the battle for me. If
Wallace is interested, I'm interested. Seems like all the hotel REITs are
dropping today. At some point the recession, overbuilding, possible decreasing
REVPAR - all the nasties are built into the prices of these stocks. I'll take
LHO here and the LHO dividend and hope both the price and div. can be
maintained.

Conseco (CNC), adding to my small position. Very strong insider buys at this
level. So I'll up my bet also.

Consolidated Stores (CNS). Sold about 2/3 of my full position recently at
higher prices. I'm going back in now (gingerly) to build it up. This
merchandise consolidator (Big Stores, MacFrugal's, Kaybee stores)ought to do
okay if we go into a recession. This stock is still expensive, but it generally
(a killer word -g-) has sold for a much higher multiple than the current pe.

Arrow (ARW). Initiating a position with a very small buy. I'm interested in a
distributor when it's at or below book value. My favorite is Marshall (MI), but
I think I'll wait a little longer there. Arrow is an $8B dollar
electronic-component distributor which is obviously having its difficulties.
But they provide a service that companies want, and ARW are big enough and
capitalized well-enough that they have some clout in their markets. That's IMO.
We'll see what happens a year or two from now. I say it will be back above an
increasing book value. Again IMO.
