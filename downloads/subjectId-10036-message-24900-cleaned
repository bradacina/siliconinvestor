YRCW. I still own them (shares bought in 2001), but I trimmed my postiion back
this week. I really needed the money for screaming energy deals. Also sold all
ANF, some GEHL and some BDK.

bought
HTE at 25.38
PTEN at 23
SU at 67.32
COS at US$26.5
etc.

Someone was very generous or scared to sell them to me. When energy regains
sanity, I will rediversify.

Hi TimbaBear - You stated "...The current metrics for DRYS are such that they
are carrying too much debt and too little free cash flow for my taste. ...".

(1) What do you feel is a reasonable "Free Cash Flow" ? Until they lock in
their long term lease contracts, their debt will be high and free flow cash
flow will be small but positive.

(2)Dry's sold one of their ships (for a profit) and contracted for a two new
ships in the future. DryShips gets contracts to build two drybulk vessels in
China
http://yahoo.reuters.com/news/articlehybrid.aspx?storyID=urn:newsml:reuters.com
20060925:MTFH87189_2006-09-25_13-20-48_WNAS7543&type=comktNews&rpc=44
"... Sept 25 (Reuters) - Greece's DryShips Inc. (DRYS.O: Quote, Profile,
Research) on Monday said it signed contracts to build two panamax drybulk
vessels at a Chinese shipyard, each for about $33.25 million.

The company also said it agreed to sell a bulk carrier for $35 million and
purchase another bulk carrier for about $40.8 million. (Reporting by Devidutta
Tripathy in Bangalore)..."

It seems that management is building it's fleet life and is selling older ships
(w/ profit) and contracting newer ships. Management's most recent move was to
lease current capacity w/ longer term contracts but still needs to lock in
higher rates for current future capacity. Once this is accomplished, the free
flow cash flow will be excellent and positive.

I guess the bet is that once shipping rates move higher AND management can lock
in long term leases at these higher rates, the company can book a good ROI
(even w/ the new ships on contract).

If rates go south for a long time, then the strategy fails. My bet is that the
daily rates stabilize or go higher so management can lock in a "fair" long term
contract rate. This will guarantee a fixed ROI for the new ships on order. The
kicker is that the new ships delivered may go up in value and could be sold at
a higher price in the future.

While you wait Dry's continues to pay a 6% dividend. Both India and China
demand more ships and IMO will drive the daily shipping rates higher. Also. if
inflation kicks up, the real value of the fleet assets move higher.

As Drys waits for their new ships to be built, they can wait for the day rates
to move higher. Based on their current contracts, they have 30% of their
current fleet available for long term lease and once the new ships come online
they have those too. Last month DRY's management entered into long term leases
at the current "high rates" that contracted a significant amount of their
excess capacity. Therefore, as rates rise further, they can slowly move into
longer term contracts for the rest of their fleet (aprox 30%) which eventually
will provide an excellent ROI , a positive Free Flow Cash Flow and management
can make extra debt payments if it make sence.

This whole strategy depends on where the daily rates run. If they go higher,
management does have a plan and enough cash to pay their dividend while they
wait.

EKS

P.S. Disclaimer, I own Drys at both higher and lower prices but believe the
fundamental strategy of the management is sound. Management has been proactive
and made some significant moves to position the company to take advantage of
higher daily rates.

YRCW is a good stock to own to balance a portfolio with energy stocks. First of
all it's cheap, based on PE and EV/ revenue and since fuel cost go down with
energy prices, the stock should go in the opposite direction.

YRCW also have a fuel charge program.

From the '05 annual report: "The fuel charge is common among our industry and
represents an amount we charge to customers that adjusts with changing fuel
prices. We base our fuel surcharge on a published national index and adjust it
weekly. Material changes in the index or our cost of fuel can positively or
negatively impact our revenue and operating income." (aside: I assume because
fuel surcharges - rates/amounts/caps are negotiable items in the contracting
process with customers)

"Fuel surcharge is an accepted and important component of the overall pricing
of our services to our customers."

Regardless, it would seem that if fuel prices do decline, that that would have
positive effect on volume of shipments, and if media and investors ask, "Who
benefits from lower fuel prices?", among the first, quick, and easy answers
would be transportation companies. So I do agree that lower fuel prices
could/should/might mean higher stock prices for companies like YRCW- at least
for a quick pop or in the short term.

I haven't tracked it closely, but it often seems to me on days when oil stocks
are up, the transportation stocks I have - rail and truckers - will move down.
And similarly, the transport stocks move up when oil stocks are dropping.
There's not as much volatility with these truckers&railers as there is with the
oil stocks though (it seems). Still, I often get the feeling I'm playing
roulette and betting both black and red at the same time. Given the broad
diversity of stocks in my portfolios, I expect this, but I'm not so comfortable
with it.

(To a lesser extent, I seem to be seeing that negative correlation too between
oil stock prices and retail stocks.)

energy and freight. what you say sounds good, in theory. i could not plot
yellow stock price vs. gas prices directly, so i just picked 3 energy companies
at random, and plotted them against yellow. (you should click on 5 year chart
also). they moved in step until Q1 2005. so maybe not a lot of neg correlation
due to energy prices. in fact, oil prices are DOWN over the past month and
yellow is not UP.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=YRCW&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=su,nxy,imo

also, i would not say that yellow is excessively cheap now. the PE is low, but
so is the expected future earnings growth. but, if they can pull off profitable
expansion plans, it may be cheap now. they have some efforts at china
expansion, i believe.

Paul,

In addition to GAI (an old friend I'd given up on years ago), here is another
Chinese cash-rich blast from the past, MHJ. The board made money on this as a
net-net play a couple years ago (at least I did --- I think brinks posted it as
one of many on a net-net screen).

MHJ is a pearl/jewelry company. It has gotten cheaper again with lots of cash
on the balance sheet. It also makes money. I think lack of trust and
understanding of management is a major issue. MHJ has a complicated corporate
structure (MSIL a Hong Kong subsidiary), and I still don't fully understand why
they don't use the cash for buyback or dividend.

However, today's conference call may be of interest as they try to explain
these mysteries. They don't explain things convincingly, but at least they seem
to understand shareholder dissatisfaction and are making some efforts --- I
give them some credit for trying.

So I wouldn't bet the farm on this, but think it is worth consideration for a
small position.

I'll up my few shares of Alcoa a little.

Still looks to me that this DOW component is selling at an attractive price
based on relatively low p/sales and p/book. Forward p/e -- in which I put no
faith - seems to be low too. There's a mediocre dividend yield while waiting
for this cyclical stock to improve.

I'm guessing there's not much stock price appreciation (maybe from $27 to $35
or so in maybe a couple of years?). OTOH, in spite of high energy prices, I'm
guessing the business is intact (safe), and that there'll be continuing
aluminum demand from emerging markets.

Hello E_K_S

1) What do you feel is a reasonable "Free Cash Flow" ?

Free Cash Flow that if the company over the next 12 months just did exactly
what it did over the last 12 months would yield me at least 17% when compared
to current stock price.

For example if a company had FCF of the equivalent of $11.00/share and was
selling for $37.00/share then it would have a cash flow yield of 11/37 = 29.7%
if they just did in the next year what they did last year. I would be very
interested in looking more deeply at a situation like that to see if I could
determine the likelihood of a repeat.

On the other hand if the cash flow were negative, I wouldn't spend any more
time on it.

I know I pass up a lot of "opportunities" that way, but there are lots of folks
brighter than me out there and they seem to do quite well by looking more
deeply for catalysts. I'm a wimp and a bad guesser about what might happen, so
I eliminate growth projections and try to find situations priced such that if
they just rinse and repeat I ought to benefit as an owner.

I didn't mean to diss any company.

Hi TimbaBear - Your FCF measure seems like a simple and easy first cut value
screen. Can you provide a list of any companies that have met this type of
test? I find it useful to exam the companies in more detail because a story
tends to develop that provides good investment ideas.

Where do you get the historical FCF value(s). I believe Yahoo Finance reports
the most current number on their key statistics page.

I find that the ability for a company to continue to generate free cash flow
even during very hard times is an excellent predictor of intrinsic value.
However, when I investigate further, there are usually "other" events (like
pending litigation, waisting assets, obsolete technology, competition) which
make the specific value proposition a more risky investment. By the time
management fixes these problems the stock price has already moved higher (which
should imply a decreasing FCF yield over time).

Mr. Market is pretty efficient about adjusting the stock price to reflect the
pending issues management must correct.

I have never measured the change in FCF over time as it is difficult to find
the historical data. Maybe a first value cut would be to screen the FCF yield
and then ranked these results by industry.

Where do you get the historical FCF value(s).

I'm a life member of AAII and subscribe annually to their database. Using their
software, SI Pro, you can screen the whole database of companies for any and
all parameters. Additionally, you can build the screen and save it and also
create custom fields. That will give you FCF screens based on current data.

For historical data, I believe Reuters, Google, and ADVfn all provide
historical financial data both in Quarterly and Annual breakdowns.

Can you provide a list of any companies that have met this type of test?

I just provided several here the other day. I do so when I feel there is a bit
more merit to the research than just surviving the first screen.

Got one for you to look at now though: MHJ

Look at the cash on hand, and listen to the conference call they gave
yesterday. Keep in mind that yesterday's call was not reporting earnings, just
providing an updated clarification of some issues. I bought a few shares today,
if that is any indication of what I came away from the call thinking.

I think this is the link to the call. Warning, the English is somewhat broken

OT but perhaps of interest:

Seth Klarman on the Art of Complex Deep Value Investing
by Yan Zen
Seth Klarman - Seth Klarman On The Art Of Complex Deep Value Investing

Seth A. Klarman, President of The Baupost Group, averaged about 20% per year
for 24 years with only one negative year. This digest of Seth A. Klarman’s
investment strategies and practices is mainly based on a guest lecture by
superinvestor Seth Klarman at Columbia Business School and his book, Margin of
Safety. Many sections here are not Klarman’s exact words, but our digest of the
distilled essence of his investment methods. (The following is
from Superinvestor Digest’s September issue.)

LOOK FOR MISPRICING

&#168; “If only one word is to be used to describe what Baupost does, that word
should be: ‘Mispricing’. We look for mispricing due to over-reaction,” said
Seth Klarman.

&#168; “At Baupost, we constantly ask: ‘What should we work on today?’ We keep
calling and talking. We keep gathering information. You never have perfect
information. So you work, work and work. Sometimes we thumb through ValuLine.
How you fill your inbox is very important,” said Klarman.

* Look for forced selling, supply-demand imbalance.
* “Investors can not predict when business values will rise or fall. Valuation
should always be performed conservatively, giving considerable weight to
worst-case liquidation value and other methods.”
* “A margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices
sufficiently below underlying value to allow for human error, bad luck, or
extreme volatility in a complex, unpredictable and rapidly changing world,”
wrote Klarman.

FOCUS ON THE RISK BEFORE FOCUSING ON THE RETURN

&#168; Seth Klarman’s foremost principle of operation is to maintain a high
degree of risk aversion.

* Rule #1: Don’t lose money. Rule #2: Never forgot Rule #1.
* Klarman believes that the primary goal of value investors is to avoid losing
money.
* There are three key elements of Klarman’s value-investment strategy.
* A bottom-up approach, searching via fundamental analysis.
* Absolute return strategy.
* Pay attention to risk.

&#168; If you have $1 million and we flip a coin: head, you win an additional
$1 million. Tail, you lose your $1 million. In terms of probability, this is a
fair bet. But few people would be willing take this bet due to the possibility
of losing everything.

&#168; [SiD Notes] The key is (1) to limit your bets on situations where the
probability of winning is way above 50% and (2) the downside is limited.

&#168; Cash is the ultimate risk aversion. But clients are uncomfortable. Why
people should pay a money manager to hold cash? They are paying the manager to
wait for the opportunity to invest.

&#168; Think of the asset-under-management as if it is your own money. What
other people think doesn’t matter any bit. Ignore questions like “How does it
look to our clients and peers?”

* Keep some cash in the side pocket so there will be no forced liquidation.
Duration of the investment should be equal to the duration of the capital.

RISK = (AMOUNT OF LOSS) X (PROBABILITY OF LOSING)

* Klarman defines risk as both (1) how much is the potential loss and (2) what
is the probability of losing.
* An investor can counteract risk by diversification, hedging (when
appropriate) and invest with a margin of safety.

&#168; To Klarman, using beta and volatility to measure risk is nonsense. “Beta
= 0.7. What the hell doesn’t that mean?” asks Klarman.

&#168; As a stock falls big time, the risk should be less. As the stock goes
lower and lower, the risk would become less and less. If you back up the truck
and buy 51% of the company, you would be able to force the outcome with
control. That’s the benefit of averaging down.

&#168; However, if you short a stock, your loss would be bigger and bigger. The
amount of your potential loss is infinite.

* Klarman doesn’t do “long and short”. They bought puts on Korean Government
Bonds to sell the bonds at par.
* The greater the risk, does not necessarily mean the greater the return. Risk
erodes returns because of losses.
* Klarman believes that the long-short crap is trying to make things too
complicated.
* A Value Investment Philosophy: Klarman stresses that the future is
unpredictable. Investors must be prepared for any eventuality. The river may
overflow its banks only once or twice in a century, but you still buy flood
insurance.
* An investor looking for a specific return over time, does not make that goal
achievable. Targeting investment returns leads investors to focus on potential
upside rather on downside risk. Rather than targeting a desired rate of return,
even an eminently reasonable one, investors should target risk.

THINKING ABOUT “AUTHENTIC” VALUE INVESTING

* "I think growth investing is a stupid style. Bet on the two horse at
Philadelphia Park and you'll do well from time to time," said Seth Klarman.
* Beware of value pretenders. These investors apply a dip strategy. They buy
what's down, not what's cheap.
* Look at investments as "fractional ownerships."
* No book or lecture alone will turn anyone into a successful value investor.
Value investing requires a great deal of hard work, unusually strict discipline
and a long-term investment horizon.
* Klarman believes that his book, Margin of Safety, is a blueprint that, if
carefully followed, offers a good possibility of investment successes with
limited risk. He describes the book as one about "thinking about investing."
* Understand why things work. Memorizing formulas is not enough.
* Study the behavior of investors and speculators. Their actions "often
inadvertently result in the creation of opportunities for value investors."

THREE WAYS TO INVESTMENT PROFITS

* From the free cash flow generated by the underlying business, which will
eventually be reflected in a higher share price or distributed as dividends.
* From an increase in the multiple that investors are willing to pay for the
underlying business as reflected in a higher share price.
* Or by closing the gap between share price and underlying business value.

SEARCH STRATEGY

&#168; Spin-offs: Complete lack of information in spin-offs.

&#168; Forced selling by index funds.

&#168; Forced selling by institutions: Big mutual funds are often forced to
sell tainted names.

&#168; Disaster De Jour: accounting fraud, earnings disappointment,

&#168; Bankruptcy: Unfavorable leases can be terminated. Bond investors tend to
sell the recycled equity in a hurry.

&#168; Graham-and-Dodd deep value: Discount to breakup value, P/CF < 10.

&#168; Catalyst: tender, Dutch auction, spin-off. There are lots of competition
from many event-driven hedge funds. Savings and loans conversions are often
undervalued because they are only available to depositors and insiders.

&#168; Real estate: During the slump of 1992, the government had not been
sophisticated sellers of real estate. You could buy properties at half of
building costs. And there are far less competition in real estate.

* No self-imposed constrains. No capitalization requirements.
* Adversity and uncertainty create opportunity.

VENTURE INTO COMPLEXITY

* If the security is hard to understand and time consuming, many of the
analysts and institutions will shy away from it. He identifies this as "fertile
ground" for research.
* Spin-offs: The goal of a spin-off is for the former parent company to create
greater value as a whole by spinning off businesses that aren't necessarily in
their strategic plans. There is complexity and the 2 to 3 month time lag of
data flow to the computer databases.
* Bankruptcies: Look for Net Operating Losses as a potential benefit. The
beauty of investing in bankrupt companies is again the complexity of the
analysis. During a bankruptcy, costs get leaner and more focused, cash builds
up and compounds with interest. This cash buildup can simplify the process of
reorganization, because all agree on the value of cash.

He seems to have a dedicated following (Maybe somebody'll buy my marked up copy
of "Margin of Safety" at the going $700 rate or whatever they are at Amazon
now), and a great record perhaps-- 20% plus for 24 years (according to the
article). I look at his picks and they seem so strange to me. Imo, at odds with
his safety first, don't lose money rules. I am one who'll say okay, great
record, but if I were to make any decisions based on it (like deciding to buy
into his fund or just go along with his picks), man, I want to see some audited
statements.

He runs Baupost. I've never been able to understand his stock picks. On the one
hand, that might be exactly what he wants -- talking deep value here, requiring
the hard work and in-depth research that most people (including me), won't do.
That gives him almost an exclusive to pick up great bargains, I assume. OTOH,
even though he states his ideas/philosophy, there's no way that I see any
consistency in his methodology. I can't see the method at all. Could be just
me. At least for me, if you read my picks here, you might not agree with
anything I'm buying, but at least you will sometimes see some method to what
I'm doing.

Here are Baupost's holdings:

http://www.nasdaq.com/asp/holdings.asp?mode=&kind=&timeframe=&intraday=&chartty
e=&splits=&earnings=&movingaverage=&lowerstudy=&comparison=&index=&symbol=elos&
ymbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&FormType
Institutional&mkttype=&pathname=&page=holdings&selected=ELOS

I have gone through every one of the holdings. For me, there's not one stock
that stands out as an absolute bargain or that I can spot easily as having a
margin of safety or a moat. Most of these stocks, I've never even heard of.
Just seems so strange to me that these are the things that will propel Baupost
to 20% gains year after year (with a margin of safety too)
He has ELOS. I have that too. Not a value stock, imo. It's maybe a garp or
relative play (imo). And if so, it's at odds with the apparent disdain Mr.
Klarman espouses for "relative" bargains.

He holds MLS at an apparent loss. Mills Corp.'s been discussed here. Could
anybody who's a casual investor know if MLS will survive and thrive and that it
has a margin of safety? Can only dedicated professionals like Mr. Klarman
really be so sure the odds are in their favor?

Cold Springs Capital (CDS). It's typical. Information is sketchy/not easily
available. Maybe a good deal for and according to Mr. Klarman, but how is
anybody else to see it? So many like that. I see HRZ, a big holding. Shipping
container co. with high p/book, high d/e, not much public history, not much
earnings reported. I've not done comparables in the sector, but for me, if
there's a margin of safety with this stock, I sure don't see it.

These stocks will mostly perform well, if Mr. Klarman continues his record.
That's not the point. For me - that's me, others may differ - his picks are
useless, because I just can't see what the logic or reasoning is behind them.
I'm willing to bet on the jockey sometimes (esp. if he's W. Buffett -g-), but
these things Mr. Klarman runs with are way too obscure or arcane for me.

All jmo. (And of course perhaps it's just my problem or issue that I don't
comprehend these picks.)

Brendan W: YRCW pension -

Good point about the pension liabilities: YRCW states 2.5-3B$, with a mid point
of 2.75B$ this is a 46$/share or about 35$ post tax.

With 10B$ revenue YRCW liability is 27.5% of revenue (pretax.) I get a similar
result with peer ABFS - 2B$ revenue with 0.5B$ pension liability is about 25%
of revenue, a pretty comparable number.

However , there are non-union trucker which run their own pension (rather than
YRCW and ABFS teamster run pensions) and they do seem to look better. When
adjusting for those liabilities YRCW does not look that cheap any more. Clearly
the unfunded pension liabilities do matter for the trucking company and need to
be taken into account. Thanks for bringing this matter to our attention.

seems a bit tough to come up with a value of 16 to 17 bucks a share such as
this firm suggests

the company has 16M in goodwill and 6M in other intangibles, so their tangible
assets are much less than described...whether or not their real estate is
undervalued, it still isn't trading much under book value

they cite a bunch of items as excuses for their yearly loss, but the bottom
line is they don't turn an operating profit, and their results are further
hampered by interest expense

last year they made 4M in profit, but even that is a P/E of 18, with no or
negative growth...how is this stock deeply discounted? i think the stock price
is a result of their poor results, not a management conflict

the firm you cite says that the management is creating phantom shares and blah,
blah, blah, but the diluted share count only increased by 15K shares year over
year...there is very little insider selling

i guess i would look at it this way: even if they put the company up for sale,
why would a buyer want to pay any more than the current share price?

JMHO of course, but i would think there are numerous better "value" plays out
there, notwithstanding the activist shareholder(s)

one further note: the golconda site referenced on that page appears to belong
to an investor who owns a whole 30K shares of TBAC...with all due respect to
that person, i have to wonder how powerful an effort is that references what is
essentially a token position in the stock

http://www.golcondalp.com/golconda_about.php

note that the same person apparently posts on the yahoo message board, where he
states that 30K shares is a sizable position for him...now of course 30K shares
would likely be a sizable position for most of us that post here, but we aren't
exactly investors who make management quake in their boots <g>

Hello fellow value investors with underwater positions in oil service stocks.
My falling knife is PDS, bought a scant two weeks or so ago, worth about a 20%
haircut.
I still believe in the long term viability of this sector, and am considering a
swap within the group. Does anyone have possible swap ideas out of PDS into
another stock within the sector? I know PWE has been mentioned here before.
Also, if anyone has any ideas about PDS, particularly the sustainability of the
distribution, and how much it might be cut (presuming it will be cut?), that
would be most appreciated.

i would say that just about everything i own now is underwater. pwe is not an
oil service stock but a producer. In addition it owns rights to some 4 million
acres which it plans to farm out for a portion of the revenues. The way its
been beaten down is a little suspicious to me. I know that there is talk of
amending the way cash flow of the trusts are being reported and there is
conjecture that this will affect the distributions in some negative way. I have
not seen any comments by management in regard to this issue. I suppose there is
always the possibility that the canadian government will rethink the trust
structure as well. But perhaps its all due to leveraged entities coming under
the pressure of stock declines and withdrawals. My latest purchase of pwe today
resulted in a net yield after withdrawal of taxes of 9.5% paid out on a monthly
basis. assuming an exchange rate of .90 and no change in the distribution.
According to the ceo their current reserves are approximately 20 years and they
distribute 50% of cash flow. OF course they are replacing reserves on an annual
basis.
Do your own dilligence but unless something crawls out from under a rock I
think it should be in good shape. I also own pds in a retirement account. dont
see anything wrong with that one either. But who knows. The metal stocks are
faring worse if anything than the oil stocks. I guess I should start rooting
for cold weather and hurricanes.

From:- with a K
Timba, I started a position in OVTI today. I've been eyeing it for a while. Per
S&P, cash flow per share and earnings have risen steadily the last 5 years.
Margins and ROE are healthy.

Per First Call, 10 analysts have OVTI as a "hold," telling me there could be
upgrades as they execute in the near future. Using consensus estimates of $1.40
for next year but a more conservative growth estimate of 13% vs. 20% for 5
years (First Call), I see a compelling valuation:

Company: OVTI
Date: 10/5/06
Next year's low expected earnings: $1.40
EPS growth rate used for estimate: 13%
P/E maximum used for estimate: 8.5
Graham Fair Value: $34.00
Current Price: $15.80
$ difference: $18.20
Percent Growth to Fair Value: 115.21%

A 4-year weekly chart shows some wild seasonal swings. Looks to me like it is
at seasonal support and should rise. Note the steady rise in earnings. (Using
my broker's chart tool I can draw a straight line to show support going back to
late 2003 but don't have a way to post that here.)

News:

New Casualty List Includes Valero and OmniVision: John Dorfman

By John Dorfman

Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Buying stocks of good companies when they are down is a
time-tested investment method.

In this column, I try to incorporate that approach into a quarterly Casualty
List. It contains stocks that have been roughed up in the latest quarter, and
that I think have strong potential for a comeback...

New Selections

In the third quarter of this year, 28 stocks with a market value of at least
$500 million were down 20 percent or more. I suggest that bottom fishers
strongly consider four of them: OmniVision Technologies Inc., Komag Inc.,
Valero Energy Corp. and Commercial Metals Co.

OmniVision (OVTI), with headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, makes chips used
for imaging in computers, cell phones, digital cameras and other devices. Its
shares fell 32 percent in the three months through Sept. 30.

Investors didn't like the departure of Raymond Wu, one of the company's
co-founders. And they didn't like the company's projection of results for the
second fiscal quarter (ending in October). The company forecast earnings of 26
cents to 34 cents per share, compared with analysts' expectations of 42 cents.

The beaten-up stock now sells for 9 times the past four quarters' earnings and
11 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. To me that's temptingly cheap
for a company that earned stockholders a 22 percent return on their equity last
fiscal year.

OmniVision didn't use debt to goose the return on equity, as many companies do.
Debt is less than 1 percent of equity.

***********************************

SUNNYVALE, Calif. and CHIBA, Japan, Oct. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- OmniVision
Technologies, Inc. (OVTI), a leading independent supplier of CMOS
CameraChip(TM) image sensors for high-volume applications, today launched its
sixth generation 1.3 megapixel CameraChip sensor. Featuring a 2-micron pixel
and 1/5-inch optical format, the OV9660 enables a 25 percent thinner camera
module, meeting the requirements of ultra slim handset designs. Additionally,
the smaller module size is especially attractive to handset makers because it
allows a drop-in upgrade from VGA to 1.3 megapixels, thereby extending the life
of existing VGA camera phone designs.

"Handset makers continue to design thinner and more compact camera phones to
support consumer demand for ultra-slim handsets," said Jess Lee, Vice President
for Mainstream Products at OmniVision. "Bringing our proven OmniPixel2(TM)
technology to market in the industry's smallest format gives handset designers
more options for camera placement, opening up even more possibilities for small
form factor camera phone designs."

The small form factor is also generating considerable interest from ultra
portable laptop manufacturers who, due to size constraints, have been limited
to using only VGA resolution cameras. The introduction of the OV9660 now allows
these ultra portable laptop makers to upgrade to 1.3 megapixel cameras without
the need for a costly system redesign.

I've recently taken positions in Emerson Radio (MSN) and Man Sang Holdings
(MHJ).

MHJ is selling for less than the cash on hand, has no debt, is cash flow
positive, is selling below both book and tangible book, and owns commercial
property in China that they are carrying on the books at their purchase cost in
1992. The drawbacks: 70% of shares owned by one individual so low liquidity;
they are foreign so GAAP may be different.

MSN is selling for just over book and tangible book, has had very nice revenue
and net income growth, is very conservative on share dilution (I believe they
have fewer diluted shares now than 4 years ago).

Wallace Rivers: regarding oil service sector. I've no suggestions for swapping
out of PDS. I'm underwater in it also though; I have no intention of exiting
position.

The oil service sector's pretty broad. Fwiw, I bought a few shares of CKH last
week. Whereas PDS is, as I understand it, Canadian drilling rigs, CKH is
offshore and more geographically dispersed. Offshore rigs are more expensive
and in maybe in short supply, and maybe not likely to be mothballed as could
land-based rigs. So that servicing part of CKH business might be okay. CKH is a
broadly diversified services supplier. Which could mean its diversity of
business might be safer (than PDS) if oil prices continue down. I suspect also
the reverse -the stock may not appreciate as much as other companies like PDS
in the sector when/if the sector comes back into favor.

Re: Oil Service Stocks

I did a write-up for another forum, ValueForum, in July, 2006. Here is my
write-up:

Essential Energy Services Trust is a new business trust with its recent
spin-off in May 2006. Essential is an independent oilfield services
organization based in Calgary, Alberta. Company provides essential production
services to existing oil & gas wells in BC, Alberta & Saskatchewan.

The trust services are centered on activities that maintain and enhance
production from producing oil and gas wells and related facilities. Thus the
company’s revenues come from operating budgets as opposed to capex budgets.
Therefore the Company’s revenues are less affected by changes in decisions
involving drilling activities. IMHO this is a very big positive. Most oil
servicing companies are focused on drilling activities. The Company believes
that by focusing on “essential” services they will be less exposed to the
cyclicality of the drilling cycle.

Quarterly Revenues were up 364% to $ 19.5 Million at 3/31/06

Yield 12.1% (Most service trusts yield around 8%)

TSX- ESN.un Symbol US EEYUF

Basic Units Outstanding as at May 31, 2006

MLS -- Moving Closer to Sale

Full Story: http://www.blogs.nj.com/default.asp?item=195356

Mark Ordan, the former chief financial officer of Mills Corp., was named chief
executive of the Mills Corp., which is trying to sell its Xanadu project in the
Meadowlands.

Ordan replaces Laurence Siegel, who retired over the weekend. A company
statement said Siegel will continue to guide the Xanadu sale.

Mills, which has put the entire company up for sale, is also under
investigation for its accounting practices by the SEC.

Today's news is positive for College Park, Md.-based Mills shareholders,
according to Richard Moore, an analyst who follows Mills for RBC Capital
Markets. "This is moving Mills closer to a sale. It gives me more confidence
that the sale will occur because of what is going on today."

SVU (Supervalue) reports 2Q profits jumped from $34 million to over $132
million or $0.61 per share, topping the Reuters estimate of $0.53, as net
revenues of $10.7 billion came in just above expectations due to Albertson's
Acquisition. Stock up more than 6 percent.

From the article"...Supervalu Inc., the nation's third biggest supermarket
chain operator, reported on Tuesday that earnings nearly quadrupled in its
second quarter, when it included the results of its newly purchased Albertson's
grocery stores. It also boosted its guidance for the year...."

---------------------------------------------------------------

I have hedged a few shares to lock in a profit for next year by selling the
April $35 calls. I will continue to hold a small core position as SVU completes
their store integration specifically w/ their regional distribution systems.
SVU is know for running a very efficient distribution business. Some experts
says the best in the industry (even better than Wall Mart). Management said
that they will use their excess cash flow to pay down debt. Maybe they will
also consider a raise in their dividend too.

Stock still selling at a value price. PE is now around 13. Watch Yucaipa to see
if they start selling shares. His private equity firm purchased $680 million
shares of SVU stock around August 2005.

on this board before you did.

If you look at the balance sheet there is a huge minority interest. This
minority interest is $37 million and has claims on a little less than half of
that cash. This is because MHJ owns a little more than half of an entity MSIL
that actually holds the cash.

it's true that a buyback is accretive, but i don't think it will do much for
the stock price

there isn't much of a float as it is, and the stock is already trading well
below book, so reducing the float further while simply improving the price/book
ratio isn't likely to attract new buyers

paying a dividend at least has the potential to attract new investors, who
might be willing to hold the stock for the dividend, while waiting for an
eventual capital gain

The buyback might not attract new buyers but maybe it has attracted old buyers
like me. I would see the company as being worth more, and so with more
confidence, I'd buy more stock.

Putting in a dividend might attract more buyers, but it's a dinky company, and
so it might still not be attractive to new people. Further if the dividend is
seen as some return while waiting for some catalyst to jump up the stock price,
maybe that catalyst comes quicker if the company has fewer shares and higher
p/book.

Not sure it makes much difference either way. Among all the value investors on
this thread, I'm guessing if more aren't tempted to buy now, not many will be
with a 3,4 or 5% div. on the stock. Jmo, I could be wrong. (And maybe all those
other people who will avoid this stock regardless are right to be doing so.)

Carl,

We can agree to disagree, but I'd like to make one last point. A high volume
buyback, even if implemented over an extended time period, can have a
tremendous impact on stock price for illiquid stocks. Just think supply and
demand. If they have 500k shares to buy, with 1k average trading volume, the
stock definitely has some room to run as supply dries up ;)

I have experienced this before, and that is why I bought some of this dog. If
the buyback is in addition accretive to book value, then it is a no-brainer and
much preferred over dividends in my view.

That being said, who knows when (and even if) they will start implementing the
buyback.

Best regards,
MC

to have supply and demand work in your favor, you have to have demand...it's
pretty clear that demand is lacking in the case of WNMLA stock, and especially
with so many other stocks working very well at this point, i wonder where that
demand will come from

i don't know what the rules are for pink sheet companies, but listed companies
cannot buy back more than a set percentage (something like 25%) of the average
daily volume of their stock, per day...as such, if those rules apply to WNMLA,
they might be able to buy 200 or 300 shares a day...forgive me for yawning <g>

take half the float from an already illiquid stock, and many investors will
never buy it, no matter the fundamentals, because you can't get out if you need
to sell...it already trades with a 4 or 5% spread much of the time, that's bad
enough <g>

all of our opinions are worth about what we get paid for them anyway, but agree
to disagree is probably the best course...time will tell what the stock
does...at least if they did something at all, there would be a little

Toward what end, confrontation? You looked at what you looked at and have come

You want to dispute anything I've said about a company, I don't care. Dispute

I own some stock as well, so I'm not saying you have made a bad decision to buy
the stock. What I am claiming is that people are not understanding the company
well because of its complicated corporate structure.

These guys run both MHJ and MSIL, so I'm not claiming they or you lie --- they
are in control of the cash. However, MHJ owns fractionally more than 50% of
MSIL, which actually houses all the cash to my knowledge Thus, what I'm saying
is that I don't think we, as MHJ owners, have claims to the entire cash. In
other words, to me the stock is not trading below cash value.

I ask you to look at it, not to just be jerk, but because I'd like confirmation

Paul funny that you bring up community bank stocks as i have been poking around
in this sector and found some values. I believe that times get tougher with
higher interest rates, the faltering housing and increased competition for
deposits by internet money market accounts.

Good management will be able to manage such adversities and a good enough
management will be able to sell out <G>. So far on my extended watch list of
20+ bank stocks 3 have been bought out just during the last 3 month. I believe
I can do well by looking for stocks with
a) low PE
b) deposit and loan growth
c) good demographics (income and/or population growth)
d) Loan quality, low charge offs, sufficient reserves.

Of course it's pretty difficult to get all those above in one stock, but i did
found a decent number of candidates where i will put in some low bids. Most of
those are illiquid so i guess I have a chance to get them filled over time.
Today i started with EPIK, a microcap bank in tony Marin county and close to my
neck of woods. Decent valuation, somewhat overpaid management, good growth
records and growing deposits in one of the most fluent counties in the US are
worth a bet for me. See this presentation on EPIK's website for a starter:

http://ofccolo.snl.com/cache/1001130096.pdf

My intention is to buy a basked of bank stocks that meet above criteria and sit
back and wait for good things to happen. i still own ISBC and sit on almost 50%
gain. Too bad that most thrift conversions lately have not been looking that
great to me.

I see also that one of Marty Whitman's Third Avenue funds has also gone into
these community bank stocks. I note they recently purchased RCKB, according to
their letter to stockholders. You might want to peruse:

http://www.thirdavenuefunds.com/taf/aboutus-shareholder-letters.html

I don't have a position in this one. And I'm not planning to buy any others
either. These stocks just are so very difficult for me to understand and to
value. One standard measure is 'efficiency ratio', but I don't use it because
it's too time consuming and not worth it to me for my small buys to be digging
around in companies' balance sheets for the numbers. I prefer using another
standard, roa, and by that measure, the low numbers community banks generally
seem to show (under .75), seem to indicate relatively poor performance.

There's one bank I recently added to, VNBC. I posted on it, but somehow I don't
see that post now. Must have forgotten to hit the right send key. Anyway, VNBC
is a pretty aggressive construction lender in California. So while it shows
better numbers than some other banks in our discussion (e.g. has higher roa,
higher dividend, with maybe a comparable p/e and p/bk), it may also be a
riskier stock.

Third Avenue Fund apparently went into some partial S&L conversions (MHC).
Blankmind brought those to this board and we hade a discussion about them a
while ago in 2005.

VNBC is a very aggressive bank, their assets increased by 15x+ in 6 years and
right now their leverage looks a little high. I conclude from this, that VNBC
is a high risk situation. If they manage their risk well and loans stay
current, stockholders will be amply rewarded.

I just bought another sleeper bank today. nice LT track record , decent

not sure if this will affect the actual results of these companies, even though
it is affecting their stock price for today at least

BAC's offer excludes options and margin trades, and is limited to 30 trades a
month, while it forces a person to tie up a minimum of 25K in a BAC savings
account (equity in the brokerage account does not count toward the 25K minimum)

as such, it may appeal to someone who doesn't trade much, doesn't use options,
and doesn't use margin, but those customers don't generate much income for
places like ET anyway...in fact, many of them may actually cost brokerages
money, hence the inactivity fees that many brokers charge, and the 25K
requirement by BAC, to give them a source of income to offset those losses

i think the concerns affecting the stocks are more related to the possibility
that other banks or brokerages may follow suit in some way, which is certainly
possible

other companies have tried commission-free trading in the past, and it has
never succeeded...perhaps this time will be different...only time will tell

Ah nuts, Spekulatius. -g-. I'll guess I'll have to change my statement of not
buying anymore community banks. FNLC will work for me too, and I'll be a buyer
for few shares.

The negatives are strong: Very thinly traded stock. Looks like dead money since
2004; stock might even be in a decline. They say they are positioned in the
fastest growing (coastal) areas of Maine. I don't even know that Maine is
growing. (Maybe it's all them trees whats growing -g-)

OTOH, I am looking for bank stocks with some consistent earnings (which FNLC
has had. In future, who knows?) and which have a relatively high ROA and
relative to that, a relatively low p/bk. Perhaps not the best way to buy these
things -- I know I need to do more research and give more consideration to my
formulaic way -- but I'll bet I'm sorta okay here.

I've got a lot of volatility in my portfolios now because of heavy oil
weightings. Right now, a few shares of this stock that seemingly has no capital
appreciation potential but pays a 3.7% dividend yield and slowly increases book
value (increasing book value is a good thing for bank stocks), well that looks
appealing enough to me.

Hi Paul - I also am heavy weighted in oil stocks. My next largest holding is in
natural resource stocks. Both sectors have done quite well this last cycle. The
average dividend yield to my portfolio from these two sectors is around 6%
based on my average cost. I can peel off some of my shares, pay a long term
capital gains tax and put this money into a basket of regional banks but I
would be giving up my high net dividend income. I like the long term value
these companies provide, so I believe I will continue to hold these shares and
add new money to special "value" situations (like COP).

My next largest holdings are in the finance sector w/ both large money banks (C
& WM) and regional banks (NYB). I am thinking of adding a few more regionals to
the mix. Many of the regional banks pay a pretty good dividend that provides a
good source of qualified dividend income to the portfolio. Regionals are also
candidates for a buyout from the larger money banks which adds a good kicker to
the portfolio if you happen to own one.

I see you like FNLC. What other regionals do you own or are on your watch list
that (1) pay a good dividend, (2) have an excellent "regional" franchise that a
money center bank may find a good fit as a buyout candidate and (3) has
significant value when measured by the relative BV (excluding goodwill).

I think Spekulatius makes a good observation when he states that many of the
regionals present bargains for the value investor as the "efficient" market
theory may not be pricing these banks at fair value. I believe at this point in
the cycle (interest rates have peaked and the next move may be down), the money
center banks may be poised to begin another round of buyouts and/or mergers.
JPM is rumored to be looking to acquire another "large" bank or special
regional franchise. WM was mentioned but perhaps some regionals might be in the
offering too.

Though you might find these numbers interesting-(not mine and not checked for

NATURAL GAS STRIPS FOR THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS:
November, 2006 $6.51
December, 2006 $8.06
January, 2007 $8.64
February, 2007 $8.64
March, 2007 $8.50
April, 2007 $7.79
May, 2007 $7.75
June, 2007 $7.86
July, 2007 $7.96

Above, please notice some prices for the upcoming contracts for delivery for
natural gas. This is based on NYSE prices and as we mention, these prices are a
lot better than where they have been in the last couple of months.
Unfortunately though, these are the prices for south of the border. Up here in
Canada, where you face pipeline charges to get it there and inventories are
just as full, instead of getting $6.51 U.S., the current spot price is $4.23
Canadian. Ouch!

Hi Madharry - I am bullish on natural gas and in the last year have bought into
a few different plays. One in particular that has done well is EP. I started to
accumulate shares a few years ago around $7.00. They have a large interest in
both natural gas and gas pipe lines. I have peeled off a few shares above
$15.00 but continue to hold as management pays down their debit.

The nice part about owning a pipe line "distribution" company (Mr. Buffet
understands this) is that whatever the price of the commodity, the pipeline
makes money. It's all it the amount of gas you move through your pipeline
rather than the price of that gas.

It also helps if you own a lot of that gas at below market prices too.

Ten percent of my holdings include "value" companies" that have some interest
in (1) natural gas or (2) natural gas distribution (by pipe line or by ship).

There is definitely value in Canadian companies because of the natural
resources they own. The strength of the U.S. dollar vs the Candian dollar makes
many of the investments an even better value.

Community bank - EPIK, FNLC, CPBK -

Announcing my 3rd buy today CPBK - a community bank in SC. Somewhat mediocre
rentability but also pretty decent loan and asset growth over the years. Stock
buyback and dividends are positives as well. Demographics in this part of SC
are not that great however.

Thinly trading does not bother me much, indeed I see it as an opportunity to
get in at a bargain price ( I did buy at the low today). Dead money does not
bother me much either as long as i believe the intrinsic value of the stock has
increased (Deposit and loan growth, book value and earnings increases etc.) -
it just means the stock is a better value now than it was before. I do prefer
to buy in coastal areas as i believe that strong real estate and income growth
is key for prospering banks (note that CPBK is an exception from the rule).

I am a bit more partial on the efficiency ratio and to a lesser degree ROA.
Why? Because an inefficiently run banks with an other wise intact franchise are
prime takeover targets. Smaller banks tend to have efficiency ratios in the
60-65% range while bigger banks run below 50%. This means that buy taking over
a small bank with let's say a PE of 12 (or PE of 15 after paying a 25% premium)
is a good deal if they can get the efficiency ratio back to less than 50%
(equivalent to a 30% earnings increase).

So i think because of the slower growth but still good profitability small
community banks with an intact franchise and trading at a decent valuation are
a prime acquisition target, which should provide a floor to those stocks.

Community Bank CPBK, I looked at this one a couple years back and passed.

I'll look again. It's the same thing for me as the others that I bought: I like
the relatively high roa to the relatively low p/bk. As you suggest though,
logically it would seem the efficiency ratio is a better measure, especially
for a bank with a franchise that might be attractive to an acquirer.

Without having specific and detailed knowledge of these banks, I'm one - like
you apparently - who would be trying to purchase a package of these things.
That should increase the chance that one or more might actually get a takeover
offer. And perhaps the other banks at least hold their stock value plus maybe
increase their intrinsic value (one hopes).

==================

In past, a big plus for community bank followers might be to see that Geffrey
Gendell was a major institutional holder. He is the largest in CPBK, according
to Yahoo.

In a 12/17/01 Barron's article he discussed three community bank stocks (CHCO,
FMAR, LION). This guy went around the country scooping up positions in
community banks, waiting, and then profiting from takeovers or improved
business conditions (betting somewhat on lowered interest rates.) Seems to me
he has made his money already (2001-2005), and I'm not so sure he'd be a buyer
now... maybe he's looking to sell, I don't know. That he's still in though, I
take as a plus.

The stocks have all stalled out in the past couple of years.
Here's the chart, although it's hard to see the quick ascendency and subsequent
lack of movement:

Hi Paul - When you and Spekulatius talk about the efficiency ratio for a bank,
what exactly do you look at to calculate this number? (Spekulatius you might
provide the board some of the specifics you look at..). Is it the operating
expenses divided by the net income?

It would seem that because of economies of scale a very large money banks would
be more efficient in their back room operations than a small regional bank.
Therefore, if you have a profitable regional bank that is inefficient in their
back room operations and holds a unique franchise, I would think that this
would be an attractive property for a buyout candidate.

The one thing that sours the balance sheets of these midsize regional banks is
how they value "Goodwill". Several of these banks have bought up smaller banks
and have accumulated a lot of worthless goodwill which they continue to carry
on their balance sheet. This over states their true BV. It's just another thing
to consider.

Well, that might be a good point, since there are many ways to calculate
efficiency ratios.

http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficiencyratio.asp

As I say, for package deals I feel I shouldn't have to be so clever as to have
to come up with measures by digging into balance sheets. (jmo, I could be
wrong.) For any company, rather than calculate the number for one year and make
a decision, you have to put that number context. Is it increasing or decreasing
over time, how does it compare to benchmark or comparable banks? So some
digging into the firm's history.

Anyway, for me, if I were to use efficiency ratios - and unless somebody like
Spekulatius or Jim Clarke, or somebody else here tells me that I'm wrong, I
would not use any of the four ways above, but rather

non interest expense divided by net income

This one's just more appealing to me because it's fast and easy to get and
calculate. And over time, even if there's lots of garbage in net income, I
suspect it ought to provide the same trending indication of how the particular
bank's doing as the more sophisticated efficiency calculations. (Jmo, without
any facts.)

anecdotally, im not sure that these takeover are worth a whole lot to the
acquirers. the bank that i do business locally is a multi- regional bank. i
have a checking account linked to savings account with them. they offer free
bill paying and decent interest on savings. Whenever Ive approached them about
other services they were always at a large premium to what i was paying
elsewhere. Whenever I mentioned this to the manager expressing surprise that
they could get any business at all, she would shrug and tell me that none of
the decisions were made at the local level any more. It seems to me that a well

The math i have been describing (efficiency ratio of 65% for a small bank
versus 50% for a large bank) is generally correct but of course the question is
if they can hang on to their customer through the merger and integration.

There are pretty successful acquirers that do merger as a growth path but many
stumble as their integration does not work and they aliniate their customers.

I am with BAC and have received bad service in the local downtown branch but
pretty decent service in neighbourhood branch where i live now. I like about

regarding efficiency ratio - i don't care too much about the efficiency rato

non interest expense divided into revenue.

I tend to look more into ROA and trends of numbers like efficiency ratio etc. I
agree with Paul that I do not feel a compelling need to dig too deep into those
numbers, since I buy a basket of those that look alright and cheap enough to
spread the risk.

I have seen some investors on BB that appear to specialize in this sector and
sometimes even in a particular region to learn al the minutia that they feel
are important. Since I put at most 10% of my capital into those banks I do not
feel the need to do so at this point.For those that feel compelled to do so,
