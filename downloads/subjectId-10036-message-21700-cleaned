ROCKY MOUNTAIN MINERALS, INC. Announces Sale of Petroleum Permit in Exmouth
Sub-basin of Australia to BHP Billiton and Apache Energy

PRESCOTT, Ariz., July 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ROCKY MOUNTAIN MINERALS,
INC. (OTC Bulletin Board: RMMI) announced today that it and its Joint Venture
partners (Strata Resources N.L. and Octanex N.L.) have entered into an
agreement with BHP Billiton Petroleum Pty Ltd ("BHP") and Apache Energy Limited
("Apache") for the sale of a 100% working interest in WA-329-P, a petroleum
exploration permit in the offshore Exmouth Sub-basin of Australia. The permit
covers an area of 177,000 acres.
The terms of the Agreement provide an initial cash payment of $400,000, a
deferred supplemental cash consideration of $1,000,000 contingent upon the
operator drilling a well or maintaining the property into Year 5 of the permit,
whichever first occurs, and the grant of an overriding royalty interest ranging
from 2.75% to 3.75% with respect to any future production.
In announcing the agreement, President of RMMI, Mr. Ray Hill said, "The sale of
WA-329-P to BHP and Apache provides the joint venturers a great opportunity to
participate in an exploration program with major international oil companies in
a highly desirable and prospective area with little financial exposure or
commitment. Beginning in 1998 several significant oil discoveries have been
drilled in the surrounding permit blocks by major companies, including BHP,
Apache and Woodside."
RMMI and its Exmouth partners sold exploration permit WA-322-P, immediately
north of WA-329-P, to BHP in 2004 under similar terms. WA-329-P is currently
undergoing a large, multi-permit seismic assessment. Mr. Hill noted, "We
believe that WA-329-P will become subject to the same level of exploration
commitment and work that we are seeing performed in the surrounding acreage."
The Exmouth Joint Venture percentage interests are:
RMMI, 25%; Strata Resources, 37.5%; Octanex, 37.5% SOURCE ROCKY MOUNTAIN

No, never have quantified the numbers. I suspect a lot fewer have been
successful than what I imagine. Growth of portfolios seems okay though, so I'm
not unhappy with the tactic.

Also of course, it's not just a matter of a "% successful" number. Like you,
I'm willing to make a bigger portfolio bet where I suspect the odds might be in
my favor. So for example I'm generally willing to risk more money on large caps
where I presume there are greater assets and less chance of bankruptcy than
with smaller companies where I make smaller bets.

Possibly a good metric for me might be the average length of time I actually
hold the stocks before I close the positions. I bet it's longer than I
initially anticipate. If I knew my average holding period, it might give me a
little more patience and piece-of-mind to hold on. I don't know what my average
holding period might be - I hope it's long enough to see the turnaround if
there is one. I'd guess that time is closer to two-three years than to
six-months or a year.

I like to "audit" my portfolio strategy periodically and see what works and
what doesn't. I learned a lot over the years that way, mostly the importance of
keeping losses limited in any given position and making sure the portfolio
holds a decent percentage of winners most of the time.

I’d agree with you about SLE’s Operating Margin, Dividend (a healthy 2:1
Dividend Cover) and its Long Term Debt. The banks appear to own more of SLE
than the shareholders. However, based on the ratio between Net Interest Expense
and EBIDTA, SLE seems to be using that debt fairly effectively, but only just !
Its P/E of 13 does appear reasonable, but that could be because of a falling
price, coupled with a falling EPS. SLE’s net profit and EPS have been falling
steadily over the last 15 months, even though its Revenue alternates by going
up and down every 3 months.
More of a negative, in my opinion, is the below par return on its Capital
Employed.
They also seem to have fairly large Intangible Assets. Maybe that’s due to
trademarks, licences etc ...
It'll be interesting to see how "the Market" reacts to SLE in the coming

re BAC and C - both may be good buys at this point. The market did not like
BAC's earnings either despite the good headline number. When digging into BAC
earnings release a bit one finds that BAC has been stretching it's balance

BAC sold off as well. Unfortunately C has not published it's 10Q, so it's not

Well Spekulatius, you saw fit to respond to my comment in 21688 that "HANS - up
20% - what's the big deal ?". By that I assumed you didn't think that a 20%
increase in a stock's price in less than a month was much of an achievement.
And therefore, by implication, your investment strategy was of such a calibre
that your average returns were far in excess of that figure.
I'm therefore somewhat surprised to read that you are content to only beat the
Indices by a couple of percent per year. You also stated that "your TWIN is up
almost 20% as well". Well, I think the big difference here is that HANS
achieved its 20% gain in 25 days, whereas TWIN took 3 months to get from a
recent low of $20 to its current $25. In addition, TWIN fell from a high of $28
to that low in mid-April.
If we want to compare "apples with apples", we can look at HANS's unbroken rise
from $10 in Jan.'04 to its current $107.50. That's a rise of 970%, or an
average of 53%/month !
(Since my message 21688, a few days ago, HANS's price has gone up another 12%).
What Peter Lynch would call a "10 bagger". The best that TWIN could achieve was
a rise from $19 in Jan.'04 to a high of $28.20 in Feb.'05. That's 48% in 11
months, or about 4.5%/month.
In my opinion, the difference in price performance between these two companies
can be found in the Quality of their Financial Fundamentals, which is what
attracted me to HANS in the first place.
Personally I believe that any investor, armed with a sensible strategy based on
understanding and analysing a company's Financial Statements, and a few things
besides, can certainly beat any stock market Index.
If your strategy is only just managing to beat the Indices, maybe you should
contact me and we can discuss an Investment Strategy that would regularly beat
the Indices.
The sad fact about professional Fund Managers and the like, is that they are
rarely able to consistently beat a Market Index, which, after all, is more or
less just the "average" of a group of stocks.
The aspect about why I "hang out on Message Boards", is, I believe, my own
business and certainly doesn't warrant further discussion. I'm sure there are
other contributors to this Board who obtain excellent returns with their stock
market investments, but that doesn't stop them from entering into constructive
discussion and debate on the subject of Value Investing.

Paul - STV: Thanks for the kind words on this. Took half of original position

'Safety net' Clearly the growth and momentum are strong and potential demand
could continue to drive both...so I've retained half the position having
covered my original cost + 80% profit with the sale...I'm working on 'house'
money from here on. The case going forward is that substantial infrastructure
needs exist in the Houston and greater Texas area..especially sewer..which
increased hurricane frequency is drawing attention to. Combine this with
oil/gas related tax revenues [Texas is still a major beneficiary of this,
though not to the extent it was in early 80's] to fund infrastructure and you
have the basis for continued growth and an attractive story. There may even be
potential for a takeover by a larger construction firm that envies the Texas
position of STV, but I doubt this occurs since ownership change could
jeopardize the Steel City tax loss carryforward that shelters income.

Yes Spekulatius, I mentioned HANS at $97 because that’s what it’s stock price
was when I posted my recent reply to Paul Senior. At that stage it had
increased by 20% from about $81 to $97 in 25 calendar days. I thought it
pertinent to make the point that a stock should be judged on the merits of its
Financial Fundamentals, and not on whether it was considered to be a "gnat
amongst giants", or any other similar irrelevant consideration.
My reference to HANS’s performance from $10 in Jan.’04 to its current $107.50
was to compare it to TWIN’s performance within the same period. In my opinion,
it’s "no contest". Needless to say, you’re entitled to your opinion.

HANS. I stay with my opinion. If HANS is in a niche market and if that market
grows like people who've bid up the stock perhaps believe it might, KO, Pepsi,
Cott - they will not only enter but they will bring their full resources -
capital, distribution, broad geographical dispersion - to dominate and decimate
the great returns HANS enjoys now.

It's my opinion that a company can do okay as a small player in the
food/beverage business, but if the profits are great in that niche or if that
niche grows, the big boys have to, and will, enter. Imo, this is an important
consideration in investing in one of these small companies in the sector. A
consideration perhaps not accounted for if one only looks at an income or
balance sheet.

Nevertheless, at this point, HANS is/was a VERY good call by you. (Like
Spekulatius, and anyone else who might be looking for stock ideas here, I only
go from the post date, since that's the only point where I could have been made
aware of the stock to make a purchase.) At this point, with the stock high, my
opinion is that if the "Financial Fundamentals" that you are looking at and
judging haven't changed in the past couple of months, but the stock price has,
and so significantly too, it seems to me that those who are in the stock should
be taking profits, and those who are out of it, should avoid it at current
price.

That’s the message I found in my mail from "m ----".
I’ll refrain, this time, from mentioning a name. As a matter of interest, I

As I’m not able to reply in private, I’m "going public" in this regard.
Now I intend making this the last reference to this rather boring topic.
First and last, the puerile and misguided references to "multiple-aliases" and
"self-promotion" don’t, in my opinion, warrant any further discussion. I’ve
dealt with them.
I certainly agree that there are "intelligent-professional investors on this
site". I wouldn’t partake if one couldn’t have meaningful discussions with
other investors who see Fundamental Analysis as very relevant to stock market
investment.
However, that doesn’t mean that I have to agree with everything they, or anyone
else, says. I certainly don’t expect others to slavishly agree with my views.
In my opinion, it’s the quality of what one bases one’s analysis on, and not on
how fine the individual may, or may not, be.
I fail to see how my comments on stocks can be defined as "attacks... on
individuals". To the best of my knowledge, this is a public forum. If I wish to
express an opinion, I’ll express it. I trust everyone else will as well. I more
than welcome constructive debate and discussion on anything I may say. If folk
are not prepared to adopt that approach and don’t like what I say, ... "Tough".
Don’t read it, just ignore it.
What I’m not prepared to accept, as I made clear to dale baker, is to have
someone make derogatory remarks when they know little, or nothing, about me.
"m ----" has no idea how long I’ve been involved in the stock market. Rest
assured, I didn’t enter it yesterday or the day before. "m ----" also knows
very little, if anything, about my stock market investment strategy. In fact,
its primarily not mine, but originated from my friend and colleague Dr. Karl
Posel D.Sc. Ph.D., who put his 30 years experience in the stock market,
together with his intimate knowledge of Financial Statements, and their
important relevance to company analysis, into several books on stock market
investing. Professionals and academics such as Dr. Posel value their
reputation, and as such, are very circumspect about putting anything into print
which they cannot defend and substantiate. To the best of my knowledge, no one
has found fault with any of his published works.
And finally, I’m always vigilant about learning more about investing. Who can
say that they know all there is to know ?! What I don’t need is a smart third
party making snide and unwarranted remarks in that regard.

Yes, I take your point Paul. There are some Big players in HANS's market who
could possibly influence future events at a cost to themselves, however large
or small that may turn out to be. One will just have to monitor events and act
accordingly. Until that happens one is, I believe, speculating.
Needless to say, at this stage those possible future events aren't reflected in
HANS's financial statements. However, should matters turn out as you and Mr.
Greenberg surmise, then those factors will undoubtedly appear in those
self-same statements, which is what makes them such a useful source of factual
information.
IMO the aspects we look for in order to determine QUALITY, are well represented
in HANS's Financial Statements. This is the first requirement in our investment
strategy.
However, the second requirement, under - or overvaluation, has started to play
a major role. In this regard the stock price could be regarded as high with
HANS’s P/E sitting at 44 ! Your point is well taken that one could certainly be
considering taking some profit and not buying anymore at this stage.
An important consideration, I believe, will be what appears in HANS’s next set
of Quarterly financial results which are due out next month. We tend to reserve
our judgement calls to publication of financial results or trading statements.
A good Bottom Line and corresponding increase in EPS, with a fall off in price
over the next few weeks, could reduce the P/E and make HANS a fair purchase
once again.

earnings. Both contain some interesting tidbit's especially in the case of C.

http://www.citigroup.com/citigroup/fin/data/p050718.pdf

- C's leverage has decreased and BAC's leverage has increased YOY. In
particular C states that they are not participating in the riskiest loans (IO
loans, aggressive ARM's and negative amortization loans) i think BAC has been a
player in the segments that C avoided but i can't say for sure.
- For both C and BAC, credit quality has improved except fore Card's
- BAC has done a better job managing costs
- C's ROA is still better than BAC's
- nice dividend increase for BAC (from 0.45$ to 0.5$)

Both banks look OK with respect to their balance sheet. Earnings quality
appears a bit better for C. If you want to see a really stretched balance sheet
have a look at WM. I bought some more C, this AM. Wanted to wait for sub 44$
but with the dividend payment due in a couple of days, I decided we are close

Thank's for the update and analysis of C vs BAC. What do you think of JPM
compared to either C or BAC?

Our friend Cramer would like us to buy the "best of breed" and on one of his
recent shows commented that C has several different core businesses which are
only fair. We should really sell C and buy the individual companies that are
the leaders in their sector.

I like the way C has several diversified lines of business each contribute to
the whole and are at a discount to several of the individual companies Cramer
suggested. Many times a subsidiary business (and crown jewel) can be hidden
away in a larger conglomerate. I think this could very well be the case for C.

=================================================================

Have you noticed how pension liabilities are accounted for especially in the
case of larger mature companies? Many times it is a hidden liability that the
value investor much watch out for (ie unfunded liabilities adjustments). If you
looked at the most recent earnings report for Lucent, you will notice that 30%
of their reported quarterly earnings were attributed to "extra ordinary gains"
from their pension portfolio. I guess it can be a positive for companies when
times are good and markets hit new highs. The smart investor will adjust it out
of the equation all together. However, if you do not dig deep down into the
report, you can be blind sided by the reported earnings.

Did you notice any pension liability adjustments for either BAC or C? I am not
sure how they they carry this on their books.

EKS

One of my biggest gains during my investment carrier was buying BAC in the
early 80's at $5/share. The company would sell shares to you at a 5% discount
to the market every month.

re C, BAC and JPM. I admit i have not looked at JPM for a while. I found it
inferior to BAC and C a few years ago, since there is not valuation incentive
to buy JPM compared to it's brethen i don't really see a reason to look into
this matter.

C's pension liabilities appear to be very low. According to the latest 10k C
has contributed about 200M$ total and the plan has no deficit. That's nothing
for a company with 20B$ earnings.

Cramer's talk to buy the best of breed is nonsense, IMO. You pay a much higher
average multiple if you buy a mix of each business line. C's retail banking and
it's card business are reasonably well managed. It's also hard to come up with
an equivalent if C's international retail business which is 40%+ of the
revenue. C is much simpler than it was 2 years ago. Insurance, various
commercial lending business and the fund management are gone. What's left is
the old money center core, brokerage but most importantly retail banking and
credit cards. The conglomerate discount is probably in the order of 20%+
(compared to sum of parts valuation) which is why I am interested in C in the
first place. But again, I am value investor and Cramer apparently is not.

again after the drop and decided not to buy.
Re-looked after your mention here and changed my opinion. I'll take shares at
current price.

Lowered expectations for '05 not good. This company makes scents and flavors.
My assumption has been that these things are small components of what goes into
Sensient's customers products and also or consequently are almost insignificant
to the customers' costs of goods sold. Therefore, I would assume Sensient has
some pricing power - if they raise prices customers aren't really affected
enough to complain. But given the earnings drop now, and the sluggish earnings
performance of SXT over the past few years, I guess I have to assume I am wrong
and that SXT does NOT have pricing power.

The earnings number that mgmt expects is $1.37-1.40/sh., giving a p/e of 13.7
now. That is above the average p/e that this stock has traded for in the past
three years. In addition, I'm not sure why we have any justification for
believing management's earnings projections.

OTOH, the p/sales ratio under 1.0 (which Yahoo shows) is fairly rare (low) for
SXT, as is the p/bk number of 1.4. Additionally, book value seems to increase
most years.

I don't have much faith that the stock will do much more than plod about in a
narrow range. OTOH, the stock seems at a low point, the company has been
profitable in each of the past ten years (at least) and has had decent profit
margins, so I suspect and will bet that the stock will eventually move up
within its apparent trading band.

I’d be interested to know where Motley Fool got their numbers from with regards
to their contention that JAKKS’s Quarterly Turnover (Sales) increased by 16% to
$127.1 mil.,"for the Quarter", and EPS increased by 77% to $0.39c.
According to Reuters, JAKKS’s previous Quarterly T/O for 31/3/05, published on
22/4/05, was $134.7 mil., and their Basic EPS was $0.38c.
According to my calculations that’s a drop in Sales of 5.6% "for the Quarter"
and a rise in Basic EPS of 2.6% "for the Quarter".
From what I can ascertain, JAKK had a T/O, 6 months ago, of $184.8 mil., and a
T/O, 3 months ago, of $134.7 mil. If the latest Quarterly T/O of $127.1 mil. is
correct, Sales have dropped steadily by a total of 31% in 6 months and EPS is
up by 14%.
If we compare this Quarter to the same Quarter 12 months ago, then Sales have
gone up by 16%, and EPS by 52%.
It seems one can draw different conclusions if one goes back 6 months or 12
months.
Are you in agreement with Motley Fool’s figures ? Have Reuters, or myself, got
it wrong ?

JAKK sales.

Perhaps it's the quarters that are being compared that the author has not
specified clearly. Assuming toy sales are seasonal, comparisons would be this
quarter's sales compared to the same quarter of last year. Not this quarter
compared to the previous three months (that is, not Apr-Jun quarter compared to
Jan-Mar quarter.)

Here's from the company press release:

"MALIBU, Calif., Jul 20, 2005 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- JAKKS Pacific, Inc.
(NASDAQ:JAKK), a leading multi-brand company that designs and markets a broad
range of toys, writing instruments and other consumer products, today announced
record revenue and earnings results for the three and six-month periods ended
June 30, 2005.

Second quarter net sales increased to $127.1 million in 2005, compared to
$109.4 million in the comparable period last year. Net income for the second
quarter of 2005 increased $11.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared
to $6.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the same period last year.

The Company's net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2005 increased to
$261.8 million, from $183.4 million during the same period in 2004. Net income
for the first six months of 2005 was $21.7 million, or $0.73 per diluted share,
compared to first six month 2004 earnings of $9.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted
share.

"The quarter was marked by record second quarter revenue and a significant
increase in year-over-year profitability," said Jack Friedman, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, JAKKS Pacific. "Our diverse products continue to be
well received by our customers and our acquisition of Play Along in June 2004
has positively impacted our results and has helped make JAKKS Pacific a more
diversified and more profitable company. Our results reflect the outstanding
efforts of our employees in developing and marketing our broad array of
products to traditional and new retail channels consistent with our plan, to
create a more consistent revenue flow throughout all four quarters, with
products that have selling seasons counter-seasonal to those of traditional
toys."
----------
I'm not so surprised as the Fool author that JAKK has had a decent quarter now.
Toy companies generally have their best quarterly sales as they sell into the
Christmas season. So the author possibly expected Jakks 2nd quarter to be a
weak quarter as is so for the large toy companies. However, as regards JAKK, if
I recall correctly, JAKK is different because JAKK has purposely tried to
reduce this seasonality factor with their product mixture and acquisitions. For
example toys like kites, etc. that don't depend on Christmas sales.

Re:AIG

There was an article in Barron's ( Monday/June 6 ) interviewing Chris and
William Browne, Managing Directors, Tweedy Browne:

http://online.barrons.com/article/SB111784278904550710.html

"Anything in the U.S. where you spy some value?

Chris: We have been pecking away at AIG. We came to two conclusions. One,
insurance is still a great business. AIG breadth of distribution is
international in scope, and you can make much better money in international
insurance than in domestic insurance. They have been very, very good at
managing their losses. If you have ever sued somebody insured by AIG, you are
wasting your time.

William: Plus, they have a large life business, and the life business is, on
average, more predictable.

Chris: In hindsight, however, no insurance company could have had earnings so
smooth and so predictable, and so they managed the earnings a little bit. The
other conclusion we came to was if they got fined by Spitzer and they paid the
combined fine that Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and all the brokers paid into
settling their research settlement case, it would be a matter of 50 cents a
share. Then life would go on.

What about life without Greenberg and some of his other lieutenants?

William: He was not doing the underwriting. There is obviously a structure in
place. It could all unravel. We are willing to take the bet that won't be the
case. They have in the past and probably will continue to underwrite in a
fairly sensible fashion. Clearly, the company wasn't quite as profitable as
most people thought. But this is an enormous organization with a huge structure
in place, and I don't think the action of one man is going to result in a
meltdown of its business franchise. Our expectation is that in a year's time,
as the air clears, you will be looking at a business that is still
best-of-class and trading at somewhere around 10 times earnings. We think
that's a pretty attractive entry level."

I jumped in, buying a full position below $55.

At the risk of repeating myself, Spekulatius, I believe I stated in my reply to
Paul Senior (21742) that I considered HANS to be currently on the expensive
side. Therefore there is every likelihood that its price could fall back. I’m
sure this could also have been encouraged by comments from the likes of Herb
Greenberg. ‘Analysts’ and financial commentators tend, in my opinion, to have
their followers, some of whom react to their pronouncements, irrespective as to
the quality of their contents.
If an investor has studied the financial statements, and other things besides,
and has come to the conclusion, based on these Facts, that a company has the
potential for making and increasing profits in the future, then that investor
will see these fall backs as potential buying opportunities.
This is one of the reasons why I posted charts of three companies on my web
site that showed price increases of between 96% and 154% in 12 months. They are
currently showing between 131% and 209% in 18 months. However, during those
periods they also had price fall backs due to selling pressure, for whatever
reasons. But the inherent Quality of their fundamentals has continued to be the
driving force behind the overall increase in their stock price. I’m sure the
same will be the case with HANS, as long as the information contained in its
financial statements tells us the same story.
What may happen to a stock’s price over a 24 or 48 hour period, is, I believe,
of more concern to Day Traders. For those who are in it for the ‘longer haul’,
it’s the inherent Quality of a company’s financials that is the overriding
factor.
But that’s just my opinion.

Anybody here with an opinion on either of these companies?

These two dull giant stocks seem to be ones that would have no pizazz for
investors. And generate disdain at any cocktail conversation about stocks
(unless maybe the cocktail party was attended by employees of the companies

I believe for me, if I bite, I'll go for both and assume that maybe one or the
other might do okay, and the one that does okay will outweigh the one that
might not. OTOH, maybe both may do poorly - low price, high dividend indicates
market opinion is "avoid". (Which of course is why value buyers might now be

CAT: Excerpts from Chief Executive Magazine in a profile piece on CAT's CEO,
Jim Owens:

The global infrastructure boom has surely helped, but credit also goes to the
company’s long-term recovery strategy that was hatched by Owens’ predecessors
and is currently being executed by the 59-year-old Owens. The plan has included
decentralizing the company, playing tough with the United Auto Workers, making
bold investments in technology, streamlining manufacturing, emphasizing
leadership development, and being able to catch up with a burst in demand that
materialized two years ago.

Cat’s sales were up 33 percent last year, to more than $30 billion, and Owens
is trumpeting projections of a further sales increase to more than $35 billion
this year. (See charts, right.) Profits for 2004 were a record $2 billion, and
Cat forecasts another 35 to 40 percent increase this year (bolstering the
reasoning behind the company’s 22 percent dividend bump and two-for-one stock
split as of July 13). Amid national hand-wringing over manufacturing
employment, Cat has added a stunning 5,500 full-time hourly jobs in the U.S.
compared with a year ago. Worldwide employment rose to 80,000 at the end of the
first quarter compared with fewer than 71,000 a year earlier.

Nearly every major industry served by Cat—construction, mining, energy and
marine—is solidly on the upswing. Caterpillar is ideally suited to exploit that
with a product line that ranges from a small skid loader to the $2.5-million,
797B mining truck, with a hydraulically controlled operator’s seat, a 3,550-hp.
engine, a payload of up to 400 tons and 12-foot-diameter tires. “We sure didn’t
do it with flim-flam,” says Owens, with a deliberate manner that bespeaks his
background as an economist. “Big iron is really moving, and production at most
of our manufacturing facilities is up 35 to 50 percent for the year.” Owens is
quick to admit that even he, with his economics background, didn’t foresee the
speed and size of the upturn. “The stars have shone on us,” he says....

Purchasing is one major area that Owens quickly attacked. He dispatched
purchasing executives to every global market, and they came back with new
solutions to the bottleneck, such as buying Chinese steel. Cat recently found
itself so desperate for alloyed steel for its gears that Owens okayed the
purchase of a barge load of iron pellets sitting in the Mississippi River,
knowing he could swap it for the coveted steel. “We were empowered to think and
act as creatively as we could to solve this, as long as it was ethical,” says
Dan Murphy, Cat’s vice president of global purchasing. “Jim said he’d make
anything available that we needed.”

Owens himself took up schmoozing suppliers of especially tight goods, meeting a
few times, for example, with Edouard Michelin, head of the French tire giant,
to improve collaboration and discuss capacity constraints. He also met with top
executives of Timken, which manufactures bearings for almost all Cat equipment.

At the same time, Owens also has worked to squeeze every possible improvement
out of the Six Sigma approach that now pervades Caterpillar. Barton began Cat’s
intense devotion to the manufacturing philosophy in 2001 as a way of driving
down the company’s repair and warranty costs. That includes focusing Six Sigma
methods “to prioritize which business units would get the iron from corporate
to increase production,” Owens says. And the company had enough “black belts”
that Owens could deploy some of them to suppliers to help figure out ways to
break upstream production bottlenecks....

“The mark of Jim’s tenure has been how he pulled his team together quickly and
got them to address a more rapid buildup of business than anybody had
predicted.” ...

Owens has stepped up leadership-development activities for his executives; for
example, Cat’s 30 vice presidents now spend one whole day together each year
evaluating the company’s high-potential managers. “He’s steeped in the values
of athletics and teamwork, and he creates a teamwork atmosphere,” says Stuart
Levenick, one of Cat’s five group presidents. “He’s also an unassuming guy with
small-town values, which plays well in our company—and globally.” ....

Owens wants to make Cat a higher-profile company. So, in a first for a Cat CEO,
he joined analysts for the company’s quarterly conference call in April. He
also iniated other corporate image-raising gambits, such as attending major
trade shows so he can speak directly to customers and dealers. One reason?
Owens hates the fact that Wall Street doesn’t give Cat its due. “He was flying
back from Europe and complaining to me about that the other day,” says Bill
Osborn, a Cat director for five years, who is chairman and CEO of Northern
Trust. “But Wall Street thinks there’s going to be a slowdown, and even though
you tell them otherwise, they factor it in and think the music will stop. I
told him, ‘Jim, don’t worry about it. Just keep producing those earnings.’” ...

Why Wall Street Has Cat Wrong

Owens says investors don't understand its strengths.

When Jim Owens became CEO of Caterpillar in February 2004, he inherited a
company experiencing explosive growth. How long can it last? Here are excerpts
from a conversation:

You’ve said Caterpillar has some building blocks that will enable the company
to prosper over the long haul. What are they?

The strength of our brand and our product line is one. Another is that we’re
investing more in technology than in anything else; we spend $4 million every
day on our product line. Our ACERT engine technology is one result of that kind
of investment. We have a global footprint, with a manufacturing presence on
every continent but one. We’re naturally hedged for currency fluctuation. We
have a longstanding history of financial integrity and good governance, a
conservative balance sheet and strong funding of our pension plans. 

Do you think Wall Street might be underestimating Cat’s potential? 

In the 1970s, our price/earnings ratio was slightly better than that of the S&P
500. That’s a high standard, but I think now we’re a better company than the
average S&P 500 company. But their average P/E is 16 to 19 whereas we’ve been
trading at only 11 to 12 times earnings. Given the global strength of our
brands and product lines, our manufacturing base and our leadership, we’re
undervalued.

Paul, I am trying to improve my personal trading strategy and money management.
Averaging down is not one of my favorite strategies. I trade large positions as
opposed to a little here and there with a very diversified portfolio. So
averaging down leads to ruin with large positions for me. GTI is a good
example. Averaging down in GTI would have been very costly for anyone and
disastrous for large positions. JAKK looks very undervalued currently but it
looked undervalued a couple dollars higher and a couple days ago! If JAKK was a
value at $18 I will average up but the market is telling me at the moment I was
wrong!

schzammm. Well, what ever you're doing is beyond my understanding.

Your profile says you're retired. You say you trade "large positions". What the
hell for?

I see life this way: Where ever you are at retirement, that's where you are. If
you've got x hundreds of thousands and now believe you need 5x more or millions
more, it's too late. I'm against beating up x hundreds to force it to achieve
4x, 5x, 10x more. And trading large seems to me to be doing this - beating up
on the portfolio. Otoh, I'm conflicted because I am trading small but a lot.
(Not so much buying and selling, but buying and buying)

"Averaging down is not one of my favorite strategies." Well you're not the only
one who feels that discomfort -g-. Who likes to be put more money in a "losing"
situation? I certainly don't. But it works for me. (Sometimes. Not with GTI
now, not with YBTVA, and I've got some - several - that've gone right into
bankruptcy. OTOH, I posted on PHS - and I could mention more. Buffett and
Munger from what I can tell say if you're going to be eating hamburgers all
your life you want to buy the meat as cheap as you can when you can.)

I usually believe that whenever any position is undertaken, the investor
(speculator) ought to have in mind beforehand whether he/she will average down
if the stock falls (if one doesn't exit the position) or will pyramid up as the
stock rises. I am generally an average-down buyer. In the oil sector, where
it's difficult for me to ascertain value, I am an average-up investor
(speculator).

This all just my opinion. Strong opinion -g- . Not disparaging you - you have
many years of investment experience. I wouldn't be surprised that if we compare
investing records that you are far ahead of not only me, but maybe the guys
here who are good investors.

I keep being told/taught this same investing lesson: There are MANY ways to
investing success. I seem to keep fighting that. I am looking for a normative
method - what is the best way for the majority of people to be successful in
the stock market? I say your way is not that way. But I know diddly, and if I
offer any alternative I can't properly back it up with facts. I'm just another
guy with an opinion. (sigh)

The Time-Tested Maxims of the Templeton Touch

Sir John Templeton
__________________________________________________________

It is impossible to produce a superior performance unless you do something
different from the majority
____________________________________________________________________

1. For all long-term investors, there is only one objective – “maximum total
returns after taxes.”

2. Achieving a good record takes much study and work, and is a lot harder than
most people think.

3. It is impossible to produce a superior performance unless you do something
different from the majority.

4. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of
maximum optimism is the best time to sell.

5. To put ‘Maxim 4” in somewhat different terms, in the stock market the only
way to get a bargain is to buy what most investors are selling.

6. To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are
greedily buying requires the greatest fortitude, even while offering the
greatest reward.

7. Bear markets have always been temporary. Share prices turn upward from one
to twelve months before the bottom of the business cycle.

8. If a particular industry or type of security becomes popular with investors,
that popularity will always prove temporary and, when lost, won’t return for
many years.

9. In the long run, the stock market indexes fluctuate around the long-term
upward trend of earnings per share.

10. In free-enterprise nations, the earnings on stock market indexes fluctuate
around the replacement book value of the shares of the index.

11. If you buy the same securities as other people, you will have the same
results as other people.

12. The time to buy a stock is when the short-term owners have finished their
selling, and the time to sell a stock is often when short-term owners have
finished their buying.

13. Share prices fluctuate much more widely than values. Therefore, index funds
will never produce the best total return performance.

14. Too many investors focus on “outlook” and “trends.” Therefore, more profit
is made by focusing on value.

15. If you search worldwide, you will find more bargains and better bargains
than by studying only one nation. Also, you gain the safety of diversification.

16. The fluctuation of share prices is roughly proportional to the square root
of the price.

17. The time to sell and asset is when you have found a much better bargain to
replace it.

18. When any method for selecting stocks becomes popular, then switch to
unpopular methods. As has been suggested in “Maxim 3,” too many investors can
spoil any share-selection method or any market-timing formula.

19. Never adopt permanently any type of asset or any selection method. Try to
stay flexible, open-minded and skeptical. Long-term top results are achieved
only by changing from popular to unpopular the types of securities you favour
and your methods of selection.

20. The skill factor in selection is largest for the common stock part of your
investments.

21. The best performance is produced by a person, not a committee.

22. If you begin with prayer, you can think more clearly and make fewer stupid
mistakes.

From The Book of Investing Wisdom, edited by Peter Krass, published in 1999

Sir John Templeton

As far back as the 1950s, long before global investing became fashionable, Sir
John Templeton was searching the world for opportunity. By the mid-1960s, the
Templeton Funds were investing in Japan. At that time Japanese stocks were
trading at 4 times earnings, while U.S. stocks were at 16 times earnings.
“People are always asking me, where is the outlook good,” he said, “but that’s
the wrong question. The right question is: Where is the outlook most
miserable?” The purpose it to find the most depressed prices. It’s about
risk/reward ratios, and the risky international strategy paid off - a $ 10,000
investment with him in 1954 was worth $2.3 million 40 years later, which works
out to a compound rate of 17% per year.

Growing up in rural Tennessee, Templeton was intrigued by the stories that
visiting Christian missionaries told of foreign countries, and he decided to
join them. However, after attending Yale and then going to Oxford as a Rhodes
scholar, he realized he was not cut out to be a missionary. “But I also
realized,” he said, “that I was more talented with money than they were. So I
decided to devote myself to helping the missionaries financially.” His first
major investment was in 1939, when he bought $100 worth of every stock on every
exchange that was trading at less than $1 (the money to do so was borrowed).
After holding onto them for an average of four years, he netted over $40,000.
Shortly thereafter, Templeton found an investment counsellor who wanted to sell
his business, which he bought for $5,000.

One of his habits over the years, was leading the Templeton Growth Fund
directors in prayer – praying to make the right investment decisions. For
Templeton, who became a British Citizen and was knighted in 1987, it was not
blasphemous. “I think all career are more successful and satisfying if you use
spiritual principles,” he said. Templeton believes that spiritual research and
progress is just as important as that in science. In 1994, for example, he
donated over $10 million to religious causes. Sir John Templeton is one of the
few men to practice what might be called a reverse tithe: He customarily gives
away to charity ten times the amount he spends on himself.
Prayers aside, Templeton had a well-defined strategy for investing, which he
boils down to the essentials in The Time-Tested Maxims of the Templeton Touch..

Paul,
Of all regular contributors here, I think you have the best grasp on the fact
that there are many ways to successfully practice VALUE investing. Unlike many,
you don't seem wed to one way to find value. You'll buy net current asset
plays, strong dividend payers, low PE/PS/PB, GARP, spin-offs etc. You don't
seem to eliminate stocks based solely on industry, market cap, or other biases.
About all I don't see you doing is daytrading, momentum 'investing', options,
shorting or other similar types of speculating.

MORE Napster.....

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=xmsr

XM is a $ 7 BILLION market cap company with 4.4 million subscribers paying $
12.95 month

Napster is a $ 217 million market cap company with 410,000 subscribers with
some paying $ 9.99 month or $ 14.95 month.

XM and Napster announced last night a joint venture as per below.

You have to ask yourself if XM has over 4 million subscribers paying $ 12.95 a
month why would subscribers not prefer a subscriber service where you can
establish your own radio station (TRUE Statement!) with a library of over 1
million songs. You would listen to what YOU want. Not what XM puts on !! Makes
sense to me.

No MP3 Player Required

LOS ANGELES, July 26 (Reuters) - Online music vendor Napster Inc. (NAPS.O:
Quote, Profile, Research) and satellite radio provider XM Satellite Radio
(XMSR.O: Quote, Profile, Research) are making music together.

The two companies said late on Tuesday they would launch an online service that
enables XM's 4.4 million subscribers to buy music they hear on the paid XM
radio service.

The two plan to jointly launch "XM + Napster," in the fourth quarter of 2005 in
conjunction with the availability of new XM/MP3 players that let users bookmark
songs they hear while listening to the radio for future purchases online.

After the MP3 player is connected to a personal computer, the service will
match the marked XM titles with songs in Napster's catalog so that they can be
purchased.

Subscribers can also use the XM + Napster service to organize playlists using
other songs from personal libraries and transfer these unique playlists to the
XM players.

Currently XM's MyFi portable radio sells for about $299.

Those XM subscribers without the new MP3 devices, can also tag songs for
purchase online through XM Radio Online, a Web-based service.

Analysts have long said satellite radio is likely to converge with music
players and other portable devices. XM Satellite is the No. 1 satellite radio
provider, directly competing with rival Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. (SIRI.O:
Quote, Profile, Research) in the nascent market.

Sirius in February said it had discussed with Apple Computer Inc. (AAPL.O:
Quote, Profile, Research) the possibility of adding its service to Apple's
popular iPod music player, but Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs did not see the
need at that point to combine the functions.

After launching its wearable MyFi device in October, XM chief executive Hugh
Panero said he believed one day a portable satellite player would be combined
with portable players that store music, like an iPod.

OTOH, profitable every year and positive cash flows (per Yahoo). The slipping
profit margin is still okay - high enough - for the price paid for the stock;
p/e at 10 area is okay too imo. 3% div. while waiting. The demand for the

Hi Paul - I have been considering companies that have "natural resource" assets
specifically timber resources. Three come to mind RYN (RAYONIER INC REIT), GP
(GEORGIA PAC CP) and WY (WEYERHAEUSER CO).

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=ryn+gp+wy

GP seems to be the best value play based on PE and P/B. GP has the largest debt
but has the free flow cash flow to cover it. It pays a dividend but not as high
as either of the other two.

I am not sure which of the three have the best timber assets and might be the
most undervalued. Have you reviewed companies in this sector? Any favorites?

I plan to pick up a few shares of GP for both my taxable and IRA accounts. This
will be a starter position and will allow me to study their annual report when
it is mailed out.

E_K_S. About forest product companies: They're mostly slow growers -g-.

In past - before China - I guess most everyone would see these stocks as
cyclical. And even if they still are, it's not so easy (not so easy for me,
that is) to see where we are in that cycle.

My preference is to buy a package here, and buy when the prices or situation
seems inviting.

RYN: It's too expensive. High p/sales, p/book, high stock price. But who knows
- maybe the stock price will surge even higher.

GP: seems okay, fair. I'm indifferent. I'm no expert though, and I've been
wrong many many times.

My three positions, fwiw:

WY: I bought because activist investor - Franklin Resources - is trying to
pressure BOD to realize shareholder value that Franklin says exists with the
"low" stock price. M. Price, retired from Franklin, was instrumental in getting
shareholder value out of Chase bank with his insistent/persistent prodding.
Maybe Franklin can do this again here. May take years. p/sales, p/bk didn't
seem too bad for a buy last time I looked.

IP: I bought because stock at lows. Also p/bk and p/sales low. If I recall
rightly, IP is the among the largest US landowners. They recently announced
they were going to restructure significantly (has underperforming assets).

UPM: I bought because stock near its lows. Low p/e, decent profit margins,
European domiciled (Finnish), big in magazine paper (Maybe newspaper readership
is down, but seems to me that people are still buying/reading lots of mags).

Hi Paul - I have noticed that many (if not all) of these timber/paper companies
are involved in asbestos litigation.

From a recent article
(http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2005/03/14/daily20.html)
"...Georgia-Pacific has been battling asbestos litigation for years. It
recently reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the number of
asbestos claims filed against it continued to decline in 2004, even as the
amount of money it paid on claims hit the $200 million mark. At the end of
2004, there were 59,700 pending claims, down from 64,300 at the end of 2003.
During 2004, 26,500 new claims were filed against the company, down from 39,000
new claims filed in 2003..."

So how does the value investor work this pending liability into their analysis?
Are these stocks already discounted by the market and enough monies have
already been set aside for the worst case scernio?

One of my best value plays was buying HAL (Halliburton Co) in 2002 at
$9.00/share when their stock tanked on pending asbestos liabilities. Mr. Market
overreacted and management was able to cap their liability by setting up a
trust fund for "all" potential claimants. I wonder why these timber/paper
companies have not done the same thing?

Perhaps until these asbestos suits are resolved, the true value of these
companies will not be realized. Notice that the proactive managements have
either already spun off their real estate timber assets or have future plans
to. I do know that when the dust does settle and it is eventually resolved for
the industry, the stock prices will be much higher.

Halliburton Co (HAL) hit a new multi year high today at $56.35.

E_K_S. Congratulations on HAL!

I decided to take Jim Clarke's advice here regarding companies associated with
asbestos --- AVOID!

(Now Jim doesn't post here anymore, so I don't know if he changed his opinion.
Perhaps so. Perhaps not. It seemed at the time many companies were having
financial issues with the litigation. For a value investor, the litigation
outcomes ($ costs to the company after insurance) couldn't be scoped out, so
that the value of the companies could not be ascertained no matter what price
they sold for. (Some co.'s did go bankrupt if I recall.)
A few of the companies did do very very well though. There was COO (if I recall
right), and some smart investors (you!) (or lucky or politically astute(??)
people) had a chance with HAL, and there was Buffett's/surrogate's/BRK's
investment in that packaging co. which went roughly from 19 to 40 after they
settled with plaintiff attorneys (Sorry. memory fails on the name here).

Anyway, I am guessing at this point GP's issues regarding asbestos are a
non-issue for new investors. I'm not following the specific companies involved
in asbestos litigation, but I don't recall seeing any horrendous
problems/surprises or bankruptcies lately. So I didn't mention it (as regards
GP) because I assume it's a non issue at this time.

That'd be my opinion, and I could be very wrong as I have been many, many
times.

(Sorry I was not a buyer of HAL when it was discussed here.)

RE: BUD

Mr. Buffett spends the majority of his time focused on the after-tax Cash Flow.
As we can now see, the "halo effect" of Mr. Buffett purchasing an equity stake
in BUD has worn off.

Q: As such, when will it be the "right" time to buy BUD?

A: When BUD can start growing its volumes profitably.

When that time happens, there will be plenty of time to buy BUD and earn a good
ROI.

With no catalyst in sight and BUD chasing growth by spending more marketing
dollars, BUD will continue to decline.
