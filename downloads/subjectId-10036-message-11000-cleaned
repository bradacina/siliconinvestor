Re: HBP. Just a guess from a quick look at the 10K and 10Q:

Are you betting that they'll realize the expected $15 million annual
consolidation savings and at the same time discontinue the $1 million+
quarterly restructuring charges? This would give them about $19 million+ more
operating income, or about $11 million+ more net income, or about $.50 to
$.55/share more income in the next four quarters than in the previous four
(ending 3/31/00 or 6/30/00, take your pick). Reported income being $.59/share
for FY1999, this could give them reported income in the range of $1.15/share
for FY2000. $1.15/share for FY2000 is in fact the estimate given by the sole
analyst on the Yahoo! "Research" page. The anaylst's estimate for FY2001
earnings is $1.30/share.

The stock traded today in the 4 1/2 to 4 3/4 range. 4 3/4 is 4.13x the FY2000
estimate and 3.65x the FY2001 estimate.

Is there something else significant I still haven't found?

Brendan

P.S. If I recall correctly, you've been following Crane for some time. What do
you think is the likelihood that management will execute to plan and actually
save the $15 million annually pre-tax (as well as keep the restructuring costs
down to the expected amount)?

Re YUM, today I sold all of it in all accounts as it broke 25 1/4 support. Good
thing - my sell prices were above 25, and it looks like it's headed to 24 and
beyond right now.
Why did I do this?

1. New lows rule - gotta abide by it.
2. The market has been very good at ferreting out info on this company. When
the stock falls, reasons seem to emerge later. The market is all over anything
to do with Ameriserve, and since Ameriserve represents a fairly significant
risk - as evidenced by the $72 million charge that didn't resolve anything just
last quarter - I am willing to let the market tell me a thing or two with this
stock.
3. I've been in and around this stock for 2 1/2 years, and it is not doing what
I thought it would. I recall one successful long-term investor who said he
gives up after 3 years because no matter how right he thinks he is, he has
never had reason to regret selling a go-nowhere stock at 3 years. I'm making it
2 1/2. This would be my second one, but I don't regret selling my first one -
Deswell. It is possible that Clayton and Senior Housing may be the third and
fourth, but there's a good year and a half on them yet.

Now, these are all technical reasons. My fundamental investment thesis, as I
detailed it over 2 1/2 years ago, remains intact. The company has done all the
right fundamental things that I thought it would do. But fundamental analysis
is only a majority of my process, a process where unanimity is required. I wish
I could get you up to speed, but there is really nothing blatantly new - except
the market telling us something has gone wrong that we don't know about yet.
Advertising turmoil, lack of organic growth, Ameriserve, Ameriserve,
Ameriserve. Those are the likely culprits. I'll find out from the sidelines.

Thanks Mike.

I've been looking at it closely and it looks cheap to me on the operating

The thing that has kept me out of the restaurants is basically my macro view
that we are at/near/past the top of a consumer cycle that has been extremely
strong.

I figure there's at least some risk of serious head winds over the next year or
so. YUM has international exposure so it may be less vulnerable if I turn out
to be correct.

Yeah, but unfortunately ALSC's stock value depends on industry valuations,
owing to the fact that a good part of the value is an inflated portfolio that
can't be sold because the company has no plant of its own. Looking at history,
the market values ALSC largely on this portfolio probably because of the lack
of plant. I don't agree with this, but try as I might, the operations are not
worth the current price either. The absolute risk low but not zero, and in any
case technically the thing looks headed to $14. I can wait. It's nothing
personal against the stock (or you - I still think it was a good pick), but if
I can get it at $14, then that's nearly 50% just back to here.

I'll second CAT, and Jim's Huttig (which comes courtesy of Jim's Crane). I've
bought both. Can't bring myself to second WPO, though maybe twister or Warren
Buffett can.

But the purpose of this post is Senior Housing, a stock that I proposed and was
discussed not so long ago. Today they did something very significant. They sold
Brookfield. That's their best property holding, with the best tenants and best
lease terms (for SNH). My initial reaction was "Oh crap." But it looks like FFO
by my calculations will only dip about 1.5-2 mill thanks to saved interest
expense, and the dividend is still well-covered by the only slightly-less rock
solid Marriot leases.

But this telegraphed some other positives. One, management is not simply
inflating assets. A worry was that they would not sell assets when prudent to
pay down debt, as they get paid based on a % of assets. Here we have a loss of
assets. That tells me management is doing right by shareholders to a large
degree, and makes me more comfortable.

Second, the properties were sold for about 20% more than the price paid by SNH.
The Marriott properties sit up at $325 million paid by SNH, or thereabouts. The
market cap of SNH now is $217.8 million plus what will be only a little over
$55M in debt. There are also a few other properties but I don't need a
calculator to find the margin of safety here. It's big. And the dividend still
seems safe.

Third, Senior Housing may actually be able to realize some value for
shareholders. If management is willing to sell assets - as I said, not
necessarily an expected attitude - then Senior Housing may realize more gains,
keeping the Marriott properties to pay the dividend.

Good Investing,
Mike

I don't know what you mean by Safe Harbor- the major non core asset of alsc is
umc and the second biggest is charter semiconductor. I think these are both
strong long term businesses. the third most valuable non core asset is the
ability to make succesful venture capital investments which N reddy has proved
to me at any rate. I am surprised that this is not valued more highly by the
market. as the company divests itself overtime of umc shares it will have an
awful lot of money to work with that my guess is will flow into venture
capital. if you are good at that and I believe reddy is the returns to
shareholders will be enormous over time.

For awhile jim I seriously consider buying some of the distressed debt of
reliance. it is a textbook case on how the market was quite aware that the deal
was not going through well before it was made public. in the end i felt there
was not enough information as to where assets were held to make any kind of
decision as to how much coverage was afforded to the debt.
I don't like retailers usually . I think it is a tough fad laden business. Wal
mart became successful because they had a winning plan- market expansion, cost
cutting, control, economies of scale, service. Probably if I were going to buy
a retailer it would be costco. same winning plan more or less. Home depot
maybe. every body else you have to guess how well they their management does,
how well their buyers buy, how they manage their inventory, where consumers
are.
I think it is very tough. I also note that the people who seem to have the
money strings don't seem to care that much about clothes these days- So
teenagers pretty much rule. will they flock back to ANF next year or to
something else?
I do like SNH but don't own it right now. I have not gotten around to look at
the other one yet. I am shying away from home builders and construction. I
think the fed overdid it with the interest rates and we are slowing down. lots
of empty nesters where i live and they are looking to divest and downsize. the
optionaires are a lot broker now, and so are the daytraders I am guessing.
meanwhile all these credit card debt problems should tell you something-
federated said that the delinquency rate was around 20% on some their
portfolios and first secuirty talking about closing its green tree unit- this
is desperation. people are going to be spending money for cable more
entertainment, and mobile phones, devices that allow them to interact with the
office when they are not there.

This is not the reason I bought Amazon, but just ask yourself if there is a
stock being beaten up more in the financial media than Amazon. Every contrarian
investment is not a value investment, but its a start.

I'm not going to go in depth on Amazon here, but think about this. Amazon has
about 4 million square feet of real estate, and this is warehouse real estate.
How many dollars of sales can a retailer generate from 4 million square feet of
real estate? At $300 a foot, about $1.2 billion. Amazon will probably do
something like $3 billion this year. And the real estate they have in place can
handle three times that.

Second point is that if Walmart wants to stock an item they have to stock it in
every store. Amazon should be able to turn over its inventories much much
faster.

Think about these two points. This is a wonderful economic model. Hasn't shown
in the financials yet, but it is starting to.

If you haven't read Quest for Value yet, you must. Amazon is a Z. For a Z you
look forward, not backward. And a Z you value like an option. Value investing
formulas do not apply to a Z. Bill Miller wrote an article in Barrons about a
year ago about Amazon which argued that an option can be a value investment. I
ridiculed his article at the time. Now I understand what he was saying.

What is Quest for value?
Comments re amzon:
1. What you say about amazon is true but it is probably also true for IM a much
cheaper company.
2. Personally, I believe that that small business will have to fight back. a
local bookstore had a wonderful Harry Potter party prior to the book going on
sale at midnight. I took my son and he loved it.

3. I have a moth problem. I researched it on the internet was going to buy it
on the internet but objected to paying a processing fee on top of a shipping
fee. so I ended up purchasing it at a local hardware store and bought it at the
same price without a processing fee and without having to wait.

4. My anecdotal conclusions are that it will be tough making money on the
internet in terms of consumer sales unless the product being offered is unique
or can be offered so that the consumer actually saves money and or time. Amazon
has yet to convince me that they will a return on equity with their model, that
is acceptable to me. And considering what their present book value is that will
have to be quite a lot.

OK, so it's contrarian, but it is also one of the most visible, over-analyzed
stocks by pros and amateurs alike. Where's my advantage in understanding
Amazon.com? Quest for Value's an interesting book, but I still don't see the
margin of safety in an option, at least as I define a margin of safety. More
likely, a diversified portfolio of these sorts of companies may indeed provide
the few rockets that offset or more than offset the ones that go to zero. So
you then have a margin of safety in the portfolio. But I don't see the margin
of safety in an individual Z, precisely because you are projecting based on
many assumptions that have no fundamental basis in past reality, and because
you do not have infinite time for the security to come around - after all, it
is an option in that regard. And in Amazon.com's case, a debt-laden one at
that.

I am going to request that my SYMC stock be transferred from margin to cash,

James,

I have no clue about Amazon. I've just noticed that most investors either swear
by it or hate it.

The one thing I'm sure of is that there IS a profitable business there if they
want it.

There are many times that I don't feel like going out and spending lots of time
driving to the book store, browsing etc... I'm busy. I'd rather point and
click. For that priviledge I am willing to pay a premium price. I am certain
there are LOTS of others just like me.

To become profitable Amazon would only have to figure out what expenses they
have that book retailers (super stores etc...) do not. And then on the flip
side, what expenses they do not have vs. book stores.

Then if they must charge a premium for my purchase and convenience, I am fairly
certain it isn't enough to offset and hour of my time, gas money, multiple
visits because they don't have it in the store etc... I will still buy it from
Amazon on those days.

Once they do that, the bigger their volume the less the premium must be. (maybe
after a time they can do it cheaper???)

I realize this is a simplistic view of complicated matters (that I don't
understand.) However, there's no doubt this company CAN make money. All they
would have to do is change their vision from grand success to making money.

If the current vision turns out to be correct they will make a lot of money. If
not, they will shrink and make some money. There's a place between going under
and owning the world that some investors forget about.

I think you'd have to balance the tendency to want to buy without driving to
the store with the tendency to wander into the nearest bookstore and buy on
impulse when out shopping. My impression of the book business is that it is
still primarily an impulse buy business. Sometimes I have the discipline to
say, ok, just wait and get home and buy it from Amazon. Other times I don't.
Just as you, I believe there are lots of others just like me. The question on
Amazon is it really worth more than the Washington Post and any number of other
companies with market caps under 10 billion. I can't predict Amazon's future to
a T, but I can see that there are other, cheaper and safer stocks out there.

James, here is one to look at ,LR, lanier. Seems less risky than REL was
several months ago. Company mentioned on this thread last year when spun off
from Harris. Net of goodwill they have book of .47 and had 9 months earnings of
.25(flat last quarter) They plan to sell off their voice(dictation) business
and also restructure eliminating 4-500 jobs. Company has debt of 560 million
and net book of only 39 million so leverage is high risk. However they will
securitize lease receivables so that only about 200 million will be short term.
Board authorized share buy back of 8 of 83 million shares. Completed 4.8
million at $3.61. Operating cash flow of 100 million and annual revenue rate of
1.2 billion seems to support more than a 3/4 price and 62 million
capitalization.
Last year on this thread their was a discussion of evaluation methods for
predicting bankruptcy. Hard for me to belive that LR qualifies. In any case I
started a position at 7/8 and would appreciate insight of knowledgeable members
of this thread.

Mike,

Definitely can't argue with you about AMZN's valuation since I am clueless (a
feeling I often have, but usually not until after my stock is down). (bg)

I will point out that AMZN gets impulse buys too. I just bought a book on
billiards that I'm fairly sure I wouldn't have found anywhere. I went to an
area to see "similar" books and found one I didn't know existed so I bought
that one too.

I agree with you about book store buying. The other day I went to a restaurant.
There was a long waiting list so I went to the book store to kill time.
Needless to say....

congrats on SYM and BL.

I looked at SYM and I see no profit plan. Year ending 2-26-00 was dismal
compared to prior and if things get slower in retail, as they seem to be, then
this year is likely to be a loss. I agre with the net net value of $5.40 or so.
Then add in the PPE and there certainly are assets here. But with losses
coming, this could be a flounder, is my fear.

I think BL could easily top $30. There are solid earnings and assets. My
get-out is over $30 for my remaining shares.

I did buy a few EBSC recently after exiting in frustration earlier. I would
like another exit from this one.

good luck.

Thanks for the heads-up on Lanier. I 'm just buying thousand share blocks as I

listening to management answer questions, this is not nearly as risky as it
looks, though there is not a rock-solid margin of safety on the downside. The
upside from this level just seems to be so huge that I'll take that risk. This
is not what a stock trading at 3/4 usually looks like - Lanier is a real

DIYH (otcbb)is an interesting speculation. They are a cleveland based home
improvement retailer with 11 stores, down from 16. They are getting badly hurt
by Home Depot and Lowes.
While it is hard to be optimistic regarding the long term outlook for their
business, I do believe the shares are a good value as an asset play.
The shares trade for around 5/8. (Thinly traded,patience & limit orders
required)
Book value is $4.76 per share with $1.61 in net current assets.
I expect continued losses for the next year at least.
I am projecting a total loss of 38 cents/share this year, (20 cents in the next
2 quarters), a loss of 21 cents/share next year (assuming sales declines
moderate) and a break even performance in 2002.
While this sounds bad, the fact is depreciation runs about 35 cents per year so
while I expect book value to decrease to $4.35 over the next 2 years, Net
current assets will INCREASE to $2.02 per share. (excluding the impact of any
store closures or share buybacks)
My argument is simply the VALUE of the assets,even in a reasonable worst case
scenario far exceeds the share price.

In the past few years they closed 5 stores. They averaged a $520,000 inventory
liquidation "hit" per store and an average of $1 million per store for the
equipment writedowns,lease costs & such. They offset those losses by a gain of
$1.9 million of the land & building of 2 owned stores.
They OWN 3 stores outright and have land leases on 2 others so I would expect
there is SOME unrealized appreciation there.
I calculate that if they were to orderly close all 11 stores and using the
average loss & gain on previous closures, they would have $2.81 per share
"left".
But they do NOT plan to close all 11 stores. In fact, right now they don't have
plans to close any more. However, I would expect that may change going forward.
It is my understanding a number of their locations are valuable and perhaps
"coveted" so I would expect that if favorable opportunities to close come up
they would take advantage of them.
I have suggested a stock buyback and got the impression they would consider
it...perhaps when they pay off their debt. (Hopefully fairly soon) They did buy
a block back at current prices (9/16) in Nov. 98. Since then, they have
signifincantly strengthened their balance sheet and insiders have been
continued repeat buyers.
I figure the company could be taken private for $2+ and they would make
themselves money...IF they could get a fairness opinion that low.
I have spent a lot of time with the numbers and I see very little, if any, risk
in the shares. I figure its good for an annualized +40% range for 3-4 years
going forward.
I do not see an immediate reason for the shares to go substantially higher but,
over time, even if the business continues to die, the shares will become more
valuable as they monetize a few more poor performing locations.
The public float is less than 2 million shares. It is a very thinly traded
stock and would likely take time to establish a meaningful position.
Only comparable public company is HBI which trades at higher valuations and has
88 stores. I prefer DIYH because insiders own a lot more and have been
consistent buyers and Its easier to see an endgame.

re: LR

I should add I would not even have looked at this company were it not a recent
spinoff. Microcap spinoff = irrational sellers. This could be the most
inefficient part of the stock market.

And Allen, I do NOT want this company buying back stock. I want them paying
down debt. If they can stabilize the balance sheet the upside is huge. Even
given the current distressed situation, if I didn't know the price before I did
my research I would have guessed this was trading at about $4. One could argue
that the company is trading below 1x free cash flow, and it is a real business,
and management is telling you on the call that they expect that free cash flow
to be roughly the same next year. You've got a lot of debt above you though, so
if you adjust it to an enterprise value it doesn't look like that. But I could
still see an LBO at two-three times my buy price here easy.

The biggest risk is that they are in a hypercompetitive market where margins
are deteriorating fast. Looking at the chart of competitor IKN tells me those
margins better stabilize pretty soon or somebody's going bankrupt. Maybe its
LR, that's the risk. But they have the highest EBITDA margins and the lowest
cost structure in the business according to management on the call today. That
was what made me pull the trigger. The guy with the lowest cost structure isn't
usually the one that goes kaput. Though the one with the worst balance sheet
just may be. I was somewhat heartened that they have a $120 million revenue
business nearly sold - that should knock out some debt. But I am not saying
this is without risk, though I think I do intend to take a normal sized
position in it over a few weeks of asking more questions.

You guys know me - I'm no penny stock hypster. I don't think I've every bought
a stock below a dollar before, though I have made good money on stocks I've
bought at 2-5. But take a look at the financials of this company - this is no
penny stock.

I really don't see either of your scenarios for HBI. It is my belief that
nobody wants ALL of their locations and therefore a buyout at $6 probably
wouldnt happen.
Rather, I expect the H2H will barely make it in the test locations and HBI will
have to try survive. If management is smart, they can make some strategic
decisions to sell some locations to X, some to Y, some to someone else, close
others and change others still to H2H. The balance sheet is strong enough to
survive for some time.

Regarding DIYH management, They would argue that they are good for even
surviving when HQ went belly up. Certainly, they seem more intent on
maintaining their jobs than enhancing shareholder value but I think they are
feeling some pressure. I wrote the board and suggested a number of things and
another shareholder also suggested a buyback at the last shareholder meeting.
The chairman owns over half, is very wealthy and so really the share price is
of little value to him. I really dont know what, if anything will happen, but I
can easily see how management could take it private with about zero risk at
$1.50-2.50. Or, they could do a dutch tender and buyback some shares...or an
open market buyback.
Or, I guess the worst case is more of the same and a "dead" stock for a few
more years. Thats the downside I guess.

provide more current assets & cash allowing an LBO or buyback.
I appreciate any expansion by you or anyone.

My belief is that sales, while HORRIBLE, will begin to stabilize in about 2
more quarters and the declines wont be as terrible.
At the same time, I realize they cannot cut much more in the way of expenses.

of successful LBO's of undervalued retail properties, thought enough of the
company"s assets to offer the Hechinger family and other stock holders about 2
1/2(my memory not too clear on amount) and infused cash into the operation
along with financing for inventory, etc. Also bought the K-mart distressed home
improvements assets for a song and a promise. He tried to meld the two so as to
get the scale to compete with the gorilla (HD). I unfortunately looked at the
balance sheet and thought the distressed bonds were worth a gamble(now
worthless). IMHO a small operation has little chance of survival unless 1) they
have a niche and 2) extraordinary management. Don't rely on financial analysis

I'm sure the story for the base metals is more complex than I can do it
justice, but I like it for the same reason energy caught my eye last year -
cheap shares and a favorable supply/demand story.

I've excluded two base metals because the demand side seems unclear and there's
a big overhang in supply - Lead and Tin.

Those that interest me; Nickel, Zinc, Copper.

Of course any interest in base metals pre-supposes that we are heading into
somewhat of a soft landing. The biggest growth in base metal demand is coming
from Asia. If our economy continues to support their growth this is the best
possible worlds for a bullish trend in metals. (It is also a bullish case for
global inflation, BTW - much of the new demand for oil also comes from Asia). A
sharp recession would slow those economies down enough that any supply/demand
imbalance could be easily reversed.

Currently there exists supply demand imbalances in all three, with the greatest
ratio of deficit/inventory in Zinc. If anyone goes over the numbers again and
finds some problems, I'd want to hear about it.

The question, of course, is; how much and how fast can additional supply be
brought to market if higher prices are seen by the industry?

Looking at the speed of inventory loss from zinc and copper, and looking at the
number of mines either idle or able to rapidly expand capacity - I'd say "not
enough, not fast enough" about Zn and Copper.

This is also an excellent opportunity to take advantage of some currency
strength and buy shares of Canadian or Australian miners. I giving T.BWR, N,
and Falconbridge a close look right now, haven't taken a position in any. But I
notice that Copper wants to move up and zinc, which is normally dead in the
summer, is also sporting some horns.

Let me know if you want to take this further - there's some complexity to the
mining bisness that needs to be addressed head on before I move in.

One concern I have is that higher fuel costs will hurt margins. I'm trying to
get specific information from co's about fuel hedging, % of operating costs,
etc. It's a double edge sword - there was a large copper miner in Montana that
had to shut down because the high cost of fuel would make the mine
unprofitable.

Some preliminary questions re LR: ($ in millions)

About 85 million shares at 1/2 is $43 market value of common as against a $155
book value. But how much of the book value is good? I see $116 in intangibles.
Then there's a $218 notes receivable, presumably from financing sales of
equipment - how good is this?

Then there are the $600 in receivables and inventory. It would take just a
small percentage of write-off to produce quite a hit to book value. The
inventory in particular worries me. Why do they have so much?

Unless I am missing something here, I would not count on any book value at all,
perhaps negative.

OK, so what about earnings value. We need enough value from earnings to to
offset the $680 of debt.

Firstly, does anyone understand why there is a $400 administrative and selling
expense? Is that not a lot f money for sales of $800 and service revenues of
$600? Perhaps sales commissions are 25% to get machines sold for their service
revenue.

In any case, I am seeing about $110 and $130 of operating profit in 1998 and
1999. This year looks like perhaps $120. I would be hard pressed to put a high
multiple on this business, what with declining sales, the threat of digital
imaging, etc. How about a 10x PE, or about 6x operating profit. $720 total
value against $680 of debt. $40.

Perhaps a stock price of 1/2 is right.

OK, you guys do deeper work than I do - where did I go wrong?

Peter - nice work, and I see your point.

Let me respond this way. Take this to a theoretical level.

You have a business with the following financials:

EBITDA of 20
Debt of 150

This is a business that analysis says is worth 6 times EBITDA. Now I ask, what
should the equity trade at?

In the most simplistic theoretical sense, the answer would be zero. After all,
if the business is worth 6 times EBITDA, then the equity would appear to be
worth negative 30.

Now let's take it to the next step. Clearly that reasoning is wrong. If
somebody were to give you that equity for free, you would take it, no? Think
about that. So obviously it has value. What is that value? In a sense it is a
form of option value. What if you had to pay a penny for it? $100? $10,000?
$1,000,000? $100,000,000? Somewhere in that range you sense its too cheap and
somewhere too expensive. If its anywhere close, you take a pass.

I have learned that with very low priced stocks with a lot of debt this option
value takes over the analysis. I don't like debt ordinarily, but sometimes I
like a lot of debt if the equity is almost free. The most relevant question is
"is the company going bankrupt" near-term, which is a completely different form
of analysis with a completely different set of questions. This is a form of
what Graham called "intelligent speculation" - he covered this in some detail
in the first edition of Security Analysis if my memory is correct. You could
call this gambling, but its all about the odds.

With a speculation like I'm describing in theory, there is a chance of losing
virtually all of your investment. And there is a chance of doubling or
quadrupling your investment in a short time. What are the probabilities of each
is the model I employ here, not the traditional value model. And if you do lose
all of your investment it does not mean you were wrong. I know I'm going to get
blasted for that, but consider Warren Buffett writing supercat insurance. If he
takes a $10 billion loss next year on a California earthquake, does that mean
he was wrong to write the policy? Buffett and Munger have often portrayed
investing as an actuarial model, just like insurance. Bill Miller has also
stressed the need for value investors to think probabilisticly.

I am not going to discuss Lanier any more on this thread (unless of course I
find some new information that makes me sell - or if I get a quadruple next
week and can gloat) - I find it a fascinating situation, but I would not want
to open the door to any outside hypster with a penny stock idea and destroy
this thread. That's why I'm trying to take the opportunity to broaden this into
a theoretical discussion outside the box of traditional value investing.

This isn't "margin of safety" investing unless you are thinking in a
diversified portfolio sense. Graham's investment thesis was based on a
diversified portfolio - stock XYZ might make no sense to invest 100% of your
money in unless you're a gambler, but if you can find 30 XYZs investing in all
of them becomes a very conservative investment strategy with "satisfactory"
upside. I would never invest more than 3% of a portfolio in something like
Lanier, probably less than that. If it works I'll wish I invested more, but I
understand the risk and I understand what "20/20 hindsight" means.

Peter, I responded but post must have gotten lost in ether. I agree with your
analysis and did not post as a value play, but rather as a risk reward play
base on subjective conclusion that bankruptcy is not probable. Would you pay 50
cents if you believed that chances were 50/50 that stock would be 0 or 3 in one

In my readings of the posts of LR, I did not come across one area of interest
for me. Why is this such a tough business, that no one seems to be doing well
in it. Cantrell seems very familiar with the business, but LR is not doing real
well either. What will happen to this business three years from now? Will it
still function the way it has now? or are people coming out with non jammable
copy machines, or direct distribution models which make LR's function obsolete.
Another question is what are the present market values of the debt issues for
LR. Sometimes a share price is very low because it makes a lot more sense to
buy the debt rather than the equity.

I've been looking at my homebuilder stocks and wondering whether it's time to
take profits. I wonder how much more I can hope for.

The analysts for the sectors downgraded stocks Aug-Sep 1999, pretty close to
the bottom for the sector. So I would guess their opinion is pretty much
useless. Now that the stocks are higher, they're starting to upgrade them.

Did anyone besides myself go ahead and buy MO 4-5 months ago? I know there was
a big discussion on here about the worth of MO, I have since taken profits, but
things still look bullish, IMHO.

N, I see another short seller is involved in value investing as well? If only

home builders, WBB -- congrats to paul on this one,

since there seems to be something afoot with today's announcement. But I did
not get excited over this stock when you mentioned it to me because I saw too
much insider selling. Taking another look. It is impressive when the company
announces that with EPS of $3.11 in the year just completed, and with things
slowing down, that they will only earn $4.00 next year. Stock price under $20
now, for the record. Lots of debt, lots of book value. What's your opinion now?

I've come to the opinion that buying MO is not value investing. There's too
much off-balance-sheet liability with the tobacco companies to evaluate them
financially. There's simply no way to know what the stock is worth.

won't get back in.

probably will not end up buying any (I don't like buying stocks that are losing

Three stocks, two of which I remember recommending on this thread before and
one I probably haven't discussed specifically.

1) Nacco (NC - 41) is moving up nicely, a little bit a day off a bottom. The
valuation is just unbelievable (3x EBITDA). You missed the bottom, but I
believe I first recommended the stock at around this level and this is about my
average cost, so by no means are you too late. I'm not selling anywhere below
60.

2) Lazare Kaplan (LKI) - I recommended this stock a year and a half ago as a
net-net at about 7 1/2. I'm sure I posted something around the time I sold it
(that was about a year ago - I took a small profit, but I sold it because I saw
things falling apart at the company) so I don't consider this by any means a
live recommendation. If anybody is still in this, the earnings report yesterday
should concern you greatly.

3) You want to take a good hard look at John Deere (DE - 33).

Michael, James and gang,

OK, let's talk about telecom service providers.
I just looked at a number of stocks (T, WCOM, BTY, VZ)
and they are floundering near 52 week lows. I know
that Mike flipped T on his "new lows" rule and I
flipped WCOM on DT acquisition speculation. However,
I want to raise more general questions:

1. Is this "a good business"? For ages, T had
a great unassailable cash cow. I would even claim,
it was a Buffetty business. It's definitely not
Buffetty anymore, but is it at least "a good business"?

Positives: Current infrastructure that has to be replicated
by any new players. Maybe current customers. Maybe
current wireless licenses. Same for current cable
infrastructure (T).

Negatives: Cap ex for infrastructure? Old, difficult to
maintain infrastructure? Cutthroat competition
cutting return-on-infrastructure? No growth prospects?

2. How to value these companies? Most of them are going
through acquisitions, divestitures, tracking-stocks,
joint ventures, partial investments, etc. PE, PSR
are mostly unapplicable. Mike's analysis on T was
great, but it may become obsolete very quickly.
Also looking at historical data T is at a good price
point, but is it really? I also liked WCOM's
results, but is it going to survive without
buying some ridiculously valued wireless company?

Is there a sufficient margin-of-understanding
to just buy them at price X, without going into
nitty-gritty financial details?

3. Currently stocks are trading on merger, divestiture,
etc. rumours. That is one possibility to profit.
Another one is a long term hold ala cable companies
a few years ago. However, I did not understand why
cable companies were undervalued then, and I am pretty
much in the same situation with telcos now.
Buffett would advise to stay out - or to stay in
a "circle of competence". For long-term holders
TTH may be an attractive option.

Any ideas, comments?

Jurgis, I started an initial position in T @31 a couple of weeks ago. My intent

Here are a couple of relevant (imo) articles you may/may not have seen
regarding T:

http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/tech/telecom/1039797.html

http://biz.yahoo.com/ii/000816/fund_000816.html

Regarding your mention of whether there is sufficient margin-of-understanding,
I do not know. I believe it's not possible to find it by going into the
financial details. My belief is that there is already sufficient information
published by the media which could lead an investor to take a position in T
within a diversified portfolio.

To answer whether this is a good business (and not just apparently cheap based
on traditional superficial measures) I coincidentally just did a new return on
capital calc on WCOM today, based on its latest results. Largely, I go by Stern
and Stewart's version when doing this. In terms of earning cost of capital,
Worldcom is doing a poor job.

In fact, it is not earning its cost of capital. After accounting for past
pooling acquisitions, and breaking down Worldcom's cash flows, I figure the
company is going to earn, optimistically, $8 billion in cash earnings on
invested cash thus far somewhat above $90 billion. Even looking ahead and
taking analysts estimates into consideration, I'm seeing at best a 10% return
here and hence WCOM is not earning whatever its cost of capital may be - I'm
estimating at least 12%.

Right now, it trades above its capital even though it is not earning the cost
of its capital. Not good. This may change as WCOM finds a way to leverage its
investment into further profits down the road. The latest quarterly report
provides a hint of this. But it has said it will have massive capital
expenditures in the future - and current cash levels imply additional
borrowings to do it. All this will dilute returns further.

I think with T and WCOM, we'd have to find a way to analyze the current levels
of investment and somehow come to a conclusion that future earnings will grow
quite significantly off this base alone. One wonders what degree of empire
building is going on - what is motivating management? Right now, T seems to
have the greatest potential because of its cable assets, but it is potential.
Management has to execute. Plans to spin off or merge with BT tell me that
management is responding to the wrong inputs right now. Ebbers' Sprint plan
told me he is responding to the wrong inputs as well.

Good investing,
Mike

To me and I could be completely wrong- T was really backed into a corner. It
had to buy TCI because that was the only way it could survive. Its long
distance business was going into the toilet and what else did it have. At least
now it has a chance to survive. Whether or not this will be good for
shareholders it is hard to figure. One thing that bothers me is that ATHM is
now selling for about $14 and T has committed to buying out some major
shareholders for $48 a share at their option. I do not understand why it did
that deal. I have also read that athm is starting to reduce its charges in
different areas to encourage installation.
I would think it will be difficult all the way around to figure what the cost
of service and revenues 10-20 years down the road will be and what inroads will
wireless have on
t's cable business. wireless is being valued at $5,000 a subscriber- seems rich
to me BWDIK. For now I keep liking ALSC, CEGE, MRVC, LDP, ASYT. and hope that
some of my turnarounds turn around. Oddly enough EGRP is showing up for me as a
technical buy. I have been watching it ever since someone recommended it in

Mike,

I'm new to looking at the telecommunications companies. However, that won't
stop me from forming many immediate self-assured opinions :-).

I think all the legacy companies may be in a bit of trouble (wcom, sprint,
ATT).

From what I've been reading Level 3, Qwest etc... and a few other "mostly
fiber" companies will have a huge advantage in technology and cost structure
over them in time.

In Level 3's case, they are even in a terrific position for future growth
because of the way they are building the network. For everyone else to catch up
is going to require that they recognize that a whole bunch of their technology
needs to be written down and replaced. That's both a huge admission and job.
It's also going to require "huge" capital outlays.

I think more than just the long distance business of the legacy companies is
threatened.

And I also think that perhaps the "new era" types have this one right. Although
it's somehere between difficult and impossible to value, you can't come away
from researching LVLT without thinking it's going to be mega-huge in 10 years.

I took a position today in MMM. I recently read an article in Forbes and lo and
behold they have some kind of fiber optic unit that generates revenues of $2B a
year and operating profits of $400MM and is growing at over 20% a year. It isnt
brain surgery to figure out that if this unit was independent it might sell for
close to what the entire company is worth on a comparative basis. The company
also has a health products unit that would also fetch a large valuation as a
separate entity.
My guess is that sooner or later the existing management is going to
restructure the company or the shareholder will for ce new management in to do
it. In the meantime you get a company that pays a dividend and generates nice
cash flow.
