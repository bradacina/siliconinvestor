unfortunately the company ceased reporting - but its last report [found under

Do you think the distribution of MWA shares to Walter Inc. shareholders on
December 6 will impact the price of MWA shares? The company looks like it could
be a value proposition if they meet their forward PE for 9-08. I do like the
theme of building out the water infrastructure and the need for all those
hydrants, valves and pipe fittings.

Have you studied any other competitor companies like Illinois Tool Works Inc.

I'll guess the distribution will not affect MWA negatively. It may be a
positive influence, because while all of a sudden many more MWA shares will be
available for sale (the negative), MWA is nevertheless the more desirable stock
(in terms of apparent company prospects) than the coal/house other piece. So
maybe MWA is the piece Walter shareholders will hold and not dump onto the
market.

I'm holding ITW. Have not added shares since my post on ITW here 9/26/05. Looks
like it still might be a buy based on some measures I use. Kind of iffy though;
not real compelling for a buy now. Same with PH. Just my quick impression, and
I could be very, very wrong in my opinion.

Missed PH a couple of years back when it was a lot lower and a cheaper. Hard
for me to step up now. I look at the chart, seems like PH doubles every five
years. Perhaps it's my problem that I'm reluctant/unwilling to buy PH shares
now.

I passed on MWA after listening to their last CC. Fifty percent of their
revenues come from new housing. They expect a decline on that side of their
business and pitched that the infrastructure side would make next year a bit
plus or essentially flat. At least that was my take on their forward guidance,
which was vague until the Q&A. I still see analysts predicting an increase in
earnings for next year. So I don't see how that computes. There has been some
cost savings from consolidations within their company, so that could explain
some of the higher earnings projections.

re ABY, WY, IP - ABY only looks cheap IMO. if you compare those three companies
based on EV/S (which includes net debt) rather than P/S, all three look like
they are valued about the same. Both IP and WY are better companies, profitable
and pay a dividend. ABY is only a better play if an industry recovery is
imminent in which case ABY gearing would work in the shareholder favor. Right
now it does not look like the industry is going to boom any time soon. ABY book

re WLT, MWA. I basically regard WLT as a cheaper way to get into MWA. I like
MWA's prospects and plan on holding my spinoff shares.

MWA looks expensive based on current PE but a closer look reveals that it's
cheaper than it looks. MWA current earnings are depressed by a high tax rate
(66%) and some extraordinary expenses as well as amortization expense (28M$
annually). the amortization expense is not transient but i tend to add those
back into earnings anyways since they are non-cash. The EV/EBITDA is around 8
which is a moderate valuation. Merger synergies and lower raw material prices
(copper!) may help improve earnings going forward. We should receive MWB shares
with more votes which should trade at small premium to MWA shares. I think the
stub may get under pressure after the spinoff more so than the MWA shares.

re MWA while it is true that about 50% of MWA revenues are somewhat housing
related 66% of MWA EBITDA comes from the infrastructure division (Mueller). US

improvement (hopefully).

I don't believe you can characterize "66% of MWA EBITDA coming from the
infrastructure division (Mueller)", because Mueller's revenues aren't mainly
infrastructure. Nor are the other divisions only new construction.

Slide eight of the PDF file you linked states that "repair and replacement is
approximately is one-half of Mueller's demand and one-third of US Pipes
demand." I interpret that to mean that the rest of that demand is coming from
new construction as exemplified in some of the details in the diagram in slide
six.

My only point is that the Mueller's revenue stream is more complicated than a
water infrastructure story. The projected earnings increase is based on lots of
moving parts (tax rate, consolidaton, new construction, infrastructure repair)
that I can't quantify to take a position in the stock.

Hi gcrispan - What's your experience with how BV is determined after a spin off
like MWA from WLT? Yahoo calculates the BV for MWA at about $10.50/share. Do
they value the assets based on the date the new shares traded? Does that mean
that land, facilities, inventory were all priced to market?

Many times I find hidden value buried in companies and when the assets are
repackaged and allowed to trade as a separate company, the market can better
value these assets.

If the true BV is around $10/share for MWA, then the downside risk IMO is low.
However, if their assets are inflated and forward operating expenses turn out
to be higher than when operating as part of WLT, I think the value proposition
shrinks. However, once the company obtains one year operating results, then the
market will have already adjusted the price to reflect any hidden value
obtained as a result of the transfer.

MWA stock does not trade much volume and I suspect after the distribution of
shares by WLT to their shareholders, there will be an over supply of shares
available and the stock may sell off closer to it's BV. I am going to watch the
trading on Dec 6-13 and see if I can pick up a small starter position.

If the new management can bring in earnings based on the analyst's Sept. 2008
estimate, and the stock trades at the industry PE of 15, it's possible to come
up w/ a price target of $24-$26/share. This assumes that BV is around
$10/share, management can run the new company more efficiently than as an
operating subsidiary, and revenues continue to grow (and does not stall because
new construction revenue falls off a cliff).

The big potential gain is an expanding PE 18-24 months out.

Hello EKS,

I have no experience with BV after a spin-off, but what you have written is
interesting.

FWIW, I do look at balance sheets and MWA's latest 10-Q indicates that half of
assets are listed as "identifiable intangibles" and goodwill. Since MWA has
taken over several companies in the last few years, it isn't surprising for me
to see these numbers and I suspect their intangible net assets look very
different from the stated 10.00 BV on Yahoo. (That 1.1 billion in debt is a
very tangible number, however.)

http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/fetchFilingFrameset.aspx?FilingID=4586255&T
pe=HTML

http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nettangibleassets.asp

I would imagine some people are short MWA and long Walters, although it didn't
really indicate that in the latest numbers. Some of that "oversupply" could go
to cover short positions, so it is really difficult for me to figure out what
is going to happen once the shares are distributed.

"If the new management can bring in earnings based on the analyst's Sept. 2008
estimate..." That is the 64,000 dollar question. If you haven't listened to
latest CC, I suggest you do so. My conclusion--and perhaps my bias--, after
listening to the Q&A, was that their sales from new construction make those
estimates far from conclusive.

Ive bought FSP 5 times in equal blocks as well as had my dividends reinvested.

My open market buys were

9-9-05 $17.05
9-14-05 $16.51
6-13-06 $20.58
7-13-06 $18.91

In all, with the dividends reinvested it brings my average cost basis down to
$17.07 per share.
I also own it in my IRA. Its the largest single position in my IRA. (Other than
Cash)

The reason I averaged up is because the Insiders continued to do so and because
I had a number of liquidity events so my cash was increasing and I wasnt
finding stocks I liked.

I never used to average up but Ive changed my philosophy if more information
becomes available which suggests things are doing well. (The repeat insider
buying in this case)

Here is the lowdown on FSP for the poster asking....

REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS: FSP owns an unleveraged
portfolio of real estate assets, consisting primarily of
suburban office buildings. The Company's real estate
operations include leasing and interim acquisition financing,
which generate rental income, loan origination fees and
development fees and, through its subsidiary, FSP Property
Management LLC, asset and property management fees.

FSP offers an investment/product strategy that is different
from most of its competitors. FSP’s knowledge of the real
estate industry and understanding of its return generating
characteristics allows it to identify superior assets for
investment. Unlike most real estate investment companies,
which utilize varying degrees of leverage in an attempt to
enhance their real estate portfolio’s returns, FSP employs no
leverage. This business model significantly reduces the risk
profile of FSP’s product offering by more appropriately
matching the long-term nature of real estate as an asset
class with “permanent” equity. By eliminating foreclosure,
financing and refinancing risk from the product offering, FSP
is able to offer better-quality risk-adjusted returns. FSP
believes it can significantly lower investment risk while
enhancing current income and long-term appreciation
potential by owning property on an all-cash basis (i.e.;
without any mortgage debt), in diversified geographic
locations that have long-term economic potential.

Hi,
Been lurking here for some time without posting and like the style of the
board. Don't claim to be an expert. Have been in the market since IBM was
$500.0, owned QCOM at $800.0 and lots of losers along the way.
There are lots of high yield ETF's that pay the div. every month year after
year. The yield is high and the risk may be a little too high for some but they
keep paying. On pullbacks because of performance the yield typically remains at
the same level. Lower price, lower div, same yield but even ETF's bought higher
will still yield more than 6% on my cost basis and many time recover to
previous levels. Some high yield selections are: cik 8.29%, COY 8.62% DHF
9.04%, EAD 11.48%, GAB 9.32, LBC 9.16, PHT 9.21, ZTR 9.33. Some of these
increase their div regularly. My yield on GAB is 14% and gain is better than
49% holding 2.5 years. The difference in yield is watching the world series on
TV or from the third base line Trading high yield issues for years and the
losers sold lost less than the annual yield, gotta pay attention but addiction
not required. Many of the top holders in the issues are pension funds. Hard to
find news on most but worth the investment.
Best to everyone on Thanksgiving.

blankmind, what made you call for a partial sale of GOOG now?

You were looking for $570; $600 maybe by year-end.

Aside: relating to Google:

My opinion is that everyone ought to develop an investing model that they're
led by. For Graham investors and maybe most standard "value" investors, that
model--- p/earning, p/sales, p/book precludes inclusion of GOOG--- now or back
at $380. (Precludes because those metrics were/are enormously high). OTOH,
there are other models that can be used to value stocks. I 've found an
alternate or supplemental that I like that's based on sales&profits. It ranks
GOOG now as being iffy... not a buy now, and not quite a sell either.

It's a philosophical thing. The standard Graham model is good because it's
exclusive, as is any particular model. For most people that's a positive
because the fewer stocks that pass a Graham screen means fewer stocks that have
to be researched and bought. So for GOOG it was an easy decision to have passed
on GOOG because it does not fit an inclusion criteria by standard value
parameters.

My attitude or philosophy is quite different from many others. I'm looking for
reasons to "include" stocks in a portfolio. Anyone who reads my posts for a
while would see I'm one who is always willing to make room for another stock,
and I likely hold more positions than anyone else around here. So for me, if I
see a stock the Graham model rejects, I'm willing to at least look at the
stock/company with another valuation model to see if I can include the stock
among my positions.

Anyway, as posted after your mention here, I found GOOG to fit, and I bought a
few shares. Not sure I want to sell any just yet. I don't see a specific reason
to sell, other than the stock has broken to new highs.

Yes, EKS, I continue to hold ARA.

Yes, the p/e, p/bk are reasonable.

Imo, the stock is up because profits/margins are up. Now IF, IF the company can
sustain this as they have for the past few years, then imo, the stock is a buy
now still, to maybe $100/sh. (or more), based on a model I'm using.

I have no idea though IF business will continue this good or as well as in
recent past years. And I don't understand the business or the environment in
which the company operates. So for me, I hold only a few shares.

Ah geez though. The conclusion here for me is gonna be like the GOOG thing: for
most people, as a standard Graham value, ARA's likely a pass; and maybe even
for a GAARP stock too. (Or it's iffy).
I myself won't buy more ARA now (unless I see continued good news), and I'm not
able to defend or justify my valuation of $100 to anyone with any factual
support. My intent is to hold what I have to see what happens.

a new rolling mill, which is a good sign that they anticipate need for more

Backlog growing in almost every segment and market. The only noticeable

time charters expire earlier, I believe in 2007 and 2008.

Lots of deals like that but in answer to your question, no return to

They did a few limited stock buybacks with the money as well.

WLT settles Bondholders suit - MWA spin off can proceed.

Walter Industries Settles All Litigation With Convertible Senior Subordinated
Note Holders
http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/061127/clm013.html?.v=69
From the article"... The combined principal balance of Notes held by the note
holders totals approximately $89.1 million and is being converted into
approximately 5.0 million shares of Walter Industries common stock. In
conjunction with this settlement, the Company expects that its Board of
Directors will rescind the previously announced Walter Industries two-for-one
stock split....".

----------------------------------------------------------------

As a result the distribution ration fow MWA will be reduced a bit.

From the article:...However, the distribution ratio could be reduced further to
the extent that additional shares of Walter Industries common stock are issued
as a result of any additional conversions of the Company's Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes or the exercise of outstanding stock options prior to the
close of business on the Dec. 6, 2006 record date for the distribution. If the
remaining balance of the Company's Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes of
approximately $16.3 million were converted, the distribution ratio would
decrease to approximately 1.65...."

============================================================
A favorable entry point for MWA might occur once the WLT spin off and
distribution is completed December 14, 2006.

I am very heavily invested in zinc: SLK.V was up over 20% today and MMG almost
10%. In addition my largest holding SIL which has barely budged, owns 65% of a
mine that will be producing 225,000 tons annually at a cash cost of .51 even
though its perceived as a silver mine. I have upgraded my fair value net of
country risk on SIL to $54.

This was copied from another source investor village posting. you may find it
of interest:

Zinc Supply

The International Lead Zinc Study Group (ILZSG, www.ilzsg.org, Zinc Statistics)
estimates World zinc Consumption at 10,774,000 tonnes, Metal Production at
10,319,000 tonnes and Mine Production at 10,008,000 million tonnes.

Zinc supply deficits:
Zinc Consumption – Zinc Metal Production = -455,000 tonnes
Zinc Consumption – Zinc Mine Production = -766,000 tonnes
Zinc Metal Production – Zinc Mine Production = -311,000 tonnes (concentrate
shortage)

Inadequate mine production, in spite of the stimulus of high metal prices, has
created a serious concentrate shortage for zinc smelters. Smelter capacity and
zinc consumption are approximately equal; smelters could supply demand, if
mines could supply sufficient concentrate. Smelters are forced to produce below
capacity and consumers forced to buy from London Metals Exchange (LME)
inventory, explaining the inventory reduction from 780,000 tonnes of April,
2004 to 276,325 April 5, 2006.

Zinc mine reserves are being depleted faster than new production is coming on
line, there is a lack of new discovery and late stage projects. Sierra Mojada
is among the projects capable of coming on line in the next few years

The solution to the zinc market deficit is addition of new supply; whether,
from new mines, mine expansion or restarting shut down production. Given that
most mines have anticipated the supply deficit for some time, the continuance
of tight supplies indicates mines are producing at their maximum capacity and
either have no additional capacity or have chosen not to develop it until the
zinc price increases sufficiently to justify expansion.

Zinc projects in development and restarts
(see graph)

Source: Yukon Zinc Corporation

These additions will be offset by mine closures due to reserve depletion.
Closed mines and announced mine closures are: Sullivan, Pine Point, Polaris,
Mt. Isa, Broken Hill, Cerro de Pasco, Kidd Creek and other mines that are near
the end of their reserves. Century, located in Australia, is the world’s second
largest zinc producer at 500,000 tonnes per year, its ore reserve is forecast
to be depleted by 2018. The proposed restart of the Lennard Shelf deposit in
Australia with historic annual production of 180,000 tonnes of zinc has only 18
months of ore reserve remaining. The 160,000 tonne McArthur River mine in
Australia's Northern Territory will close unless the Mines Ministry approves
its conversion from underground to open pit and to do so must overrule the
Environmental Ministry which has rejected the conversion.

Andrew Roebuck of TeckCominco at the 2006 American Zinc Association convention
forecast that mine closures will remove 1.4 million tonnes of zinc production
by 2011 and Teck Cominco has produced the following chart illustrating the new
mine production required to fill the “Zinc Gap” by 2015.

(see graph)

Harlan Meade President of Yukon zinc stated in a recent shareholder letter
“Certainly, to survive the record low zinc prices in 2001-2003 period, many
underground zinc mines (making up about 80% of world production) high graded
their reserves, reduced underground development and cutoff exploration. Some of
these mines ramped up production in second half of 2005 to take advantage of
higher zinc prices; by mid 2006 don’t be surprised to see some of these
producers hit the wall when they cannot sustain production.”

The 2005 zinc supply deficit between consumption and metal production is
455,000 tonnes per annum and 766,000 between consumption and mine production
(ILZSG above) and new consumption last year is estimated to have increased by
more than 600,000 tonnes. LME inventory April 7, 2006 was 270,375 tonnes and
daily consumption is about 29,000 tonnes, equal to 9.2 days supply. LME
inventory at the current rate of depletion of about 11,600 tonnes per week will
be depleted in 23.3 weeks or about 6 months.

The New Orleans complication. Hurricane Katrina contaminated a portion of the
New Orleans LME warehouses inventory, which is undeliverable until it has been
cleaned and approved for delivery. From the Dow Jones Newswire:

"This is a labor intensive task. Each bundle weighs one ton with 44-45 plates
each weighing around 46 pounds and each bundle has four straps," an industry
source said.
Warehouse companies are struggling to recruit staff as most of New Orleans
remains uninhabitable.
A curfew remains in place in the flooded area, where many of warehouses are
located while power still hasn't been restored to many buildings, the source
said.
"It takes a team of three to four people about 15 minutes per bundle. There is
a staff shortage," zinc analyst Graham Deller at consultancy CRU said.
"Another problem in New Orleans is a shortage of barges and lorries that are
needed in the reconstruction of the port. This is slowing shipments," Deller
said.
“The LME has been gradually lifting suspensions as it inspected material and
warehousing sheds, but maintained suspension on 2,819 lots, or 70,475 tons
affected by flood water and require cleaning.
New Orleans warehouses currently hold 203,700 tons of LME stocks, with canceled
warrants at 45.53%.
Canceled warrants denote material due to leave the warehouse soon but also
incorporate the remaining suspended warrants.” (Elisabeth Behrmann; Dow Jones
Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9412; 03-24-06 1138ET)

The 203,700 tonnes at the New Orleans warehouses is 75% of the total LME April
7 inventory of 270,375. The cancelled warrants, 45.53% of 203,700 equals 92,745
tonnes leaving 110,995 tonnes of inventory of which 70,475 is undeliverable
until it is cleaned, which leaves a deliverable inventory of 40,480 tonnes, 1.4
days of consumption. The problems related to cleaning the suspended lots and
the condition of the New Orleans port facilities, lack of equipment and labour
slowing delivery will reduce the ability to timely supply demand putting
additional pressure on the market.

The deficit will be with us for the foreseeable future, until new discoveries,
restarts and expansions provide reserves sufficient to meet expanding demand
and replace depleted reserves.

The available zinc inventory will go to the highest bidder. Zinc price has
responded to the supply deficit and consequent depletion of LME inventory with
an increase from a low of $0.335 per pound on November 7, 2001 to $1.34 per
pound on April 10, 2006. With continued depletion of inventory zinc price
should continue to increase and will likely continue to do so until new supply
balances the market. Contrary to some analysts that forecast a balanced market
by 2008, Metalline sees no solution to this problem until well after 2015, new
discoveries may not be forthcoming and demand may go unfulfilled at any price.

Zinc Total Cash Costs

The average smelter cost to produce zinc is about $0.35 per pound, $770 per mt,
represented by the red line in the above chart. Smelters account for
essentially all zinc production. Consequently, smelter price determines the
minimum zinc price, as smelters cannot produce below cost, for any length of
time, and remain in business. This proposition was tested in 2001 to 2003 when
prices ranged $0.34-0.37 per pound. Skorpion, located in Namibia, Africa, at
150,000 tonnes per annum and Mae Sod, in Thailand, at about 20,000 tonnes per
annum being the principle oxide zinc producers. Mehdiabad, in Iran, is
projected to produce about 450,000 tonnes from oxide and sulfide ore and be in
production by about 2010.

The above chart demonstrates that during the period of low zinc prices, from
about 2000 to 2004, few mines have been profitable and that it requires zinc
prices above $0.60 for mines to be profitable. The Century Mine in Australia,
one of the largest and highest grade zinc mines has cash costs of $0.37 per
pound. With overhead added to cash costs to determine total costs even Century
had marginal profitability until the recent rise in zinc price.

Looking sweet for zinc for several years to come! Yet another indication we
have seen little out of this metals boom yet - the incredible oversupply and
depressed 20 year deep bear market has skewed the world's view - people came to
take metal inputs as uber-cheap components of the manufacturing process. Those
days are gone - metals prices will be robust for many years to come.
Eventually, if sufficient projects come online then the market will stabilise -
copper for example has more robust production expansion possibilities and we
will probably see copper prices fall to more moderate levels in the mid-term.
But zinc is a differnt story because the typical sulphide deposits are far more
difficult to find and mine.

Hi Paul - I have been averaging down by selling naked $17.50 Puts on NYB. I
have also completed some tax loss sales for shares I have purchased at higher
prices. This is my largest "value" holding w/ my average cost basis now around
$17.00/share.

I am hoping the worst is over and the company can begin to show higher earnings
from their recent acquisitions and eventually from a higher long term yield
curve. The bank has a larger capital base from acquired customer savings
accounts. There is always a possible take out too at $21-$23 per share. The 6%
dividend continues to be paid but could be cut if earnings do not turn soon.

together, e.g. look how many are all up today. On the one hand it almost seems
like it doesn't make any difference which stocks in the sector one buys. Otoh,
over some timeframe - and depending on when one bought these stocks - there is
a dicotomy: some stocks hit new highs, others seem to languish once they drop
into the cellar (well below highs). Will a cellared stock like EAC come back

DPTR Delta

"DPTR is certainly popular. someone posted somewhere else that it may be the
most popular stock on si in terms of postings."

Heck in August I got thrown out of here for presenting. Here is the stock chart
since August:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=DPTR&t=3m

If you want to follow the minute to minute go here--oilfndr is a geologist in
Central Utah for ten years:

http://www1.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=969&clear=1&pt=m

David Pescod out today:

DELTA PETROLEUM (US:DPTR) $30.04 +0.98

I guess we shouldn’t dwell on this stock this much, but then again, why not?
When you have someone like Eric Sprott suggesting that if he could only buy one
stock, this would probably be it. The chart over the last three months tells
you that this thing has gone almost straight up and of course the key is
speculation.

Delta Petroleum is involved in three high risk/high reward areas in the United
States, but one of them stands out above them all and that’s the Columbia River
Basin in Washington State. Incredibly, a well drilled that has taken almost two
years to drill is now being tested, and results are expected by Christmas.

In the meantime, if this Washington-area play is found to be gas-charged in the
numbers that some people seem to be tossing around so easily, this could well
develop to be one of the plays of the year and Eric Sprott’s faith in this
stock could
be well rewarded.

Once again, some of the target numbers that are being bounced around these days
are becoming astronomical and you can tell by the volume of stock trading that
people are definitely paying attention.

On SCMR, it does have a few attributes I like.

First if one takes a look at a max chart, you can better see the long lateral
base.

http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=SCMR&sid=0&o_sy
b=SCMR&freq=2&time=13

To illustrate the base a little better here's a 5 year.

http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=SCMR&sid=0&o_sy
b=SCMR&freq=2&time=12

Other attributes are that if one browsed thru the last 5 yearly prospectuses,
one would find that share count is slowly and steadily being reduced.

In addition, no insider selling whatsoever in years. I'm sure they don't have
to after that year 2000 rocket.

Seems to me a pattern of slow and steady accumulation at the lows.

$3.20 a share in cold cash and no debt is something of a positive, if they use
that cash wisely to get some good news rolling, it could break out of this base
for a decent lengthy move. I also like that fact that no one thinks it can. I
am just thinking that a patient investor who had a few extra bucks he didn't
need to look at for several years, when the move comes, the percentage will
compensate him for waiting.

Of course this could stay in a base for 2 or 3 years still for all I know. I
suspect that when they are good and ready, and everyone has been flushed out
from inpatient under performance, it will move.

Just some thoughts and it remains on watch.
