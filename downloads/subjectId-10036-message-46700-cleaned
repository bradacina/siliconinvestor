What matters in investing is results. If he had great results while being
bearish, great. If not, well then perhaps he should have been bullish. :)
Investor is not redeemed by the fact that market eventually crashes and he can
say "told you so". If he produced crappy results while waiting for the crash
and his long term results (including the crash) are subpar, he's still a crappy
investor. :)

Jurgis,

I understand what you are saying....

I guess i am just sticking up for the people who are wrong... I personally
think it is not as black and white as most people like to make it out to be.

As value investors, sometimes you are early, sometimes really early..... You
see something different than everyone else is seeing and it does not make sense
to you. Under this scenario I think its difficult to stay in the rat race and
play the same game as everyone else. (at the same time conforming bias makes is
extremely difficult i would think considering you have investors that can pull
funds)

If a manager has draw downs or performs subpar for several years and then has
huge asymmetrical payoffs, not sure how that makes him a failure. (in Hendry's
case he has only been a manager for a few years i think and hopefully being
bearish you can still find value wherever its at)

I think Meredith Whitney is someone experiencing this very thing currently
(have no idea if she is right)
I think constantly outperforming the market is difficult... that's all.

OT?

I think you're conflating at least three different issues. :)
Let's try to disentangle them. :)

- Investor should be judged just by their performance. You can add things to it
like "long term performance" or "risk adjusted performance", though I think
that "risk adjusted" is a misnomer for hand waving and saying "I love this
guy"/"I hate that guy". ;) Obviously value investors may be early or very early
and may underperform during bubbles like 2000-Internet mania, but that's why we
talk about long term performance. :) And last decade was not really a difficult
time to outperform with market pretty flat over 10 years. ;)
- Talking heads (sorry Meredith ;)) could be judged by the correctness and
timing of their predictions. In general though they aren't. They are judged by
whether their spiel corresponds to listener's mental model and whether they
look nice (sorry Meredith :P). Overall, there's not much point arguing that
Jane was better talking head than Joe since no one is keeping a tally and
people have very selective memories. :))) There are extreme cases where someone
can be proven to be a loony, but overall it's just a matter of taste. ;)
- Fund managers do have a handicap of attracting and keeping funds. They might
be measured by their capability of attract/maintain capital rather than their
returns. Mike Burry was very successful with this at first, which helped him to
start his career, but then he had trouble with it during/after his big bet ;).
I think this is somewhat orthogonal to manager's performance. Crappy managers
are sometimes very savvy in maintaining capital and vice versa. Buffett was
savvy in both, which is part of his success. ;)

So with this all written out, let's return to what you said:

"You see something different than everyone else is seeing and it does not make
sense to you. Under this scenario I think its difficult to stay in the rat race
and play the same game as everyone else"

If you're an investor, you do what you think suits your investing style and
will still lead to good long term results.
If you're a talking head, you get those shmucks in studios to invite you to
tell your story
If you're a fund manager, you still do what suits your investing style while
maintaining a front to the investors so they don't pull money. :)

"If a manager has draw downs or performs subpar for several years and then has
huge asymmetrical payoffs, not sure how that makes him a failure."

If the long term performance is bad after the several years and asymmetric
payoffs, then he is a failure. :) If someone did not outperform market over the
last 10 years, well, that's not so hot. :) I have no clue what Hendry's
performance was.

"I think constantly outperforming the market is difficult... that's all."

Constantly outperforming market is impossible except for Madoff. :) Even
Buffett and Dale Baker :P had below-market years. ;) Long-term performance
matters though. You can explain away a year, two, maybe three, but by the time
you're explaining away 5-10 years, it's self delusion that you're good at
investing. :)

I think that the Burry situation is a good example of how difficult it is to
manage to short term expectations. and the problem that money managers face of
their investors insistently wanting to pull out their money at exactly the
wrong time. In Burry s case I think he pretty much pissed off the investing
community by refusing to honor demands for returning funds that they were
legally entitled to so even though he made them gobs of money in the end, it
was only by refusing to return investors money that he was ultimately
successful. Right now I am waiting for the pot at the end of the rainbow with

Actual vs. Wall St. Expectations: Denbury Resources Inc. reported adjusted net
income of 45 cents per share. By that measure, the company beat the mean
estimate of 33 cents per share. It beat the average revenue estimate of $579.1
million.

Hi Paul, I am wondering if you could give me a value opinion on GASS. It is an
LNG shipper like TGP, but no dividend at this point. Q4 earnings were reported
this morning, and I have included an excerpt below.

----------------

Fourth Quarter 2011 Results: 

<li> Voyage revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2011, amounted to
$28.9 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 0.7%, compared to voyage revenues
of $29.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010.</li><li> Voyage
expenses and vessels' operating expenses for the three months ended December
31, 2011 were $4.7 million and $7.8 million, respectively, compared to $4.1
million and $9.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010. The
increase of voyage expenses was due primarily to higher fuel costs for our
vessels under spot charters. The decrease in vessels' operating expenses was
due primarily to the higher number of vessels operating under bareboat charters
in the 2011 period.</li><li> Net income for the three months ended December 31,
2011 was $4.4 million, or $0.22 per share, an increase of $0.1 million, from
net income of $4.3 million, or $0.21 per share for the three months ended
December 31, 2010.</li><li> Included in the fourth quarter results are net
losses from interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives instruments of $0.2
million. This amount includes $1.2 million or $0.06 per share, of interest paid
on recurring interest rate swap arrangements. Excluding non- recurring items,
adjusted net income was $3.4 million or $0.17 per share compared to $2.4
million or $0.11 per share for the same period last year.</li><li> Adjusted
EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2011 amounted to $12.6 million.
A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to Net Income is set forth below.</li>

GASS. Yeah, LNG - I made that mistake too. And it was after I had already
bought the stock. I'm still embarrassed about it: GASS is not an LNG shippper.
It's an LPG shipper. As I was called on that:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26307850&srchtxt=gass

Still, I've liked what I saw (GASS fleet is the largest shipper of LPG afaik) -
although the LPG market and growth potential is perhaps much less than for LNG.

I hold shares. Bought from $6.21 through $4.27, and I show I've a gtc order in
since 11/11 for a few more shares @$3.75. Stock now is $4.59.

Looking closer now at GASS, I don't know if I want to increase my bid.
Relatively high d/e. History of profits mostly, but very lousy roe. Low
p/stated bv: At p/bv now of .33, maybe stock can get up again to at least .5 in
a good market. Would be at $7 vs. $4.59 now. From their website: "StealthGas
ranks number one worldwide in owned vessels in the 3,000 to 8,000 cbm LPG
carrier segment which is our strategic focus." Maybe being number one in this
(whatever it is) might make the company/stock more desirable eventually.

Anybody else here with an opinion to offer on GASS?

Added more FLU.VI @ 28.17 Euro today. Weak results due to terminal build costs.
my guess is that this year should be trough since a lot of terminal cost is
incurred without offsetting revenues. New management was put into place partly
based on political consideration ( Austria regional government holds a big
share and calls the shots) but i think they are doing the right thing,
attacking costs and reducing capex. this years dividend will be cut sharply but
i think we should be looking up next year when the terminal is in place and
generating revenue.

FLU.VI trades well below tangible book and once revenues from the new terminal
kick in at a huge discount to other airport operators.. Their forecast of 0%
passenger growth in 2012 seems very conservative - they still showed 9%
increase for Jan 2012.

Followed you back into TSCDY (Tesco). The stock is selling below it's GN. If
you use tangible Book Value, the GN is $15.82 or stated BV GN is $18.50. Per
share earnings have been falling w/ analysts estimates for 2013 at $1.51.

I too agree that there is hidden value in their real estate holdings which is
not reflected correctly in their tangible BV especially for their Asian stores.
They pay their dividend April and October and based on last year's
distributions yield 4.4%. Forward PE is 10.17. Their debt profile is w/i my
conservative guidelines too w/ 4x annual net income equal to their Long Term
debt.

My Buy today is not a tracking position but a standard full lot position that I
may build upon if it continues to trade below it's GN. Other than SVU, this is
the only other retailer I own, so it's a good diversified value holding for me.

Palm Oil is now another production crop in their basket of goods. I like to see
that they are building their exposure in Brazil. Company is cheap selling below
it's Tangible Book Value of $68.23/share. With a GN value of $96.53, the stock

Graham number: EKS, I suggest again that you are using the Graham number in a
way that's different from what Dr. Graham did. Namely he used it for the
Defensive Investor and was applied to stocks with "some earnings for the common
stock in each of the past ten years" and "uninterrupted payments ('dividend
record') for at least the past 20 years". (Intelligent Investor, pp. 183-184)

Of course, if it works for you in the way you use it, then that's to the good.
I myself use heuristics for many of my buys. (I like the word heuristics -- it
sounds much more accurate and scientific than just saying 'rule of thumb' or
'educated guess' -g-). I just hope your continuing use of GN for the way you
are evaluating stocks doesn't lead anyone to assume this is the way Dr. Graham
says to use his formula. Although...given Dr. Graham's changing his ideas very
late in his life, he might've applauded you for your efforts/results in the way
you use it for selecting new buy entry points.

DVN. A hold for me. I've held shares for many years. If it hits $15+ again on
no adverse news, I might add more.
UGI. Would like to continue adding to my position if shares will drop back.
BG. Thanks for updates and your (and Clownbuck and Grommit's) posts re BG. If
stock drops back (on no adverse news) to where you guys reported you were
buying, I'll add more shares. At the last time, I was too unsure and only
bought a very few starter shares. OT: I don't understand the healthiness or
unhealthiness of palm oil or the supposed rainforests being destroyed to
produce palm oil. I just try to avoid foods that contain this oil.

Hi Paul -

Re: Graham Number

My application is a modified Graham Number as I do not look at the 20 year
"uninterrupted" dividend payment history or 10 years of positive earnings. I am
looking at the tangible BV as this information is now available. Earnings are
very important but I may take exception if analysts are positive on their
future estimate(s), past earnings are positive for the last 5 years and/or
there are reasonable explanations for one time adjustments that may have
resulted in a one time loss over the last 5 years.

I further refine my Modified Graham Number (MGN) with my net annual earnings to
LT debt filter <=4. I am finding that many cyclical companies fall out of the
analysis as these companies may have losses during the course of the business
cycle. Therefore, I may make an exception to my MGN calculation "rules" to
include one of these types of companies (may include Chemical and/or Steel
sectors).

So maybe a better name for my value screen process is the EK$ value Number. It
does make me a disciplined buyer of value using a calculated approach for
determining what I consider to be under valued. So I agree with Graham that my
approach is a defensive one ( especially in this current environment). I will
continue to use it (or a modified version) as long as I can find candidate
stocks to buy.

In the future I will note my fair value price as the EK$ fair value number.
What is interesting is that your "heuristic" stock buy points (for those you
post) for the most part provide undervalued alerts when compared to my EK$ fair
value number. So when used for Buy entry points both approaches appear to
trigger the same "value" alert flag.

re LM - the problem is that LM's equity and income funds have to compete with
ETF (from Blackrock and State Street or Vanguard) that have a 0.2% expense
ratio typically. Since they don't outperform those, the asset start to migrate
out.

Now if you accept that ETF or index funds are the future and those have 0.2%
expense ratios than paying 2% for assets is too high - that would be 10x
revenues. That is one underlying reason why mutual fund companies with bad
performance are underperforming. Some like Troweprice are shielded because they
have some well performing funds and a 401k business. LM has neither so it is
going to succumb to the ETF crowd and/or has to lower their fund charges quite

Stock picking funds have hot and cold periods. A hotshot fund manager -- if

I don't understand etf's. I read SI boards, and my impression is that the

investing. The fees are contributed to the fund, so they have a positive impact
on long term holders. I'm a huge proponent of the low cost funds at Vanguard

not funny at all. my wife actually urged me to sell everything out at the low
base upon the advice of her guru who used to be an analyst. I ended up having
to sell a bunch of stuff that i really didnt want to. My cash portfolio is
still up over 50% since then so that decision ended up costing quite a bit of
money.

OT I listened to several hours of talking heads on the financial shows and I
was happy not to hear a single mention of silver and that it had moved back
over $35 which i consider to be very important. Of the commodities they seemed
to be focused largely on oil and to a lesser extent gold.

This discussion of ETF's and Mutual funds is quite interesting and changing.
They seemed pretty straight forward until you read a prospectus and decipher
tracking errors. I was chatting with some "manager" at Ishares and I was told
that they were bring out another 100 to 150 ETF's this year. I ask how in the
world can there be that many indexes to copy? he told me that the companies
that brand indexes slice and dice the world into 1000's of pieces. In fact he
told me that there are over 20,000 indexs alone at one firm. Once you slice one
up you back test them to see if they actually represent anything of substance
and market that result and see if it sticks. Alternatively large insititions
may see some aspect of the market they like, or would like some hedge against,
and ask for ETF's to be designed.

So it seems to me that ETF's will eventually be as diverse as mutuals. Infact
there are ETFs that claim to match certian funds. The advantage being intraday
trading and lower costs. There is a massive amount of profit in these babies.
The marquee index creater gets a slice of the etf fee for creating the index.
Any monkey can match the index rather than actually manage the assets and there
may be opportunities for managers such as Bill Gross to take a nice slice of a
monster pie to emulate exisiting funds. Its all very interesting.

Since the ETF's are historically created the question becomes how long the
formula for creation remains valid. Not unlike a formula that a portfolio
manager might stake his reputation and track record on. So you get an active
managment formula trading a stagnant supervised portfolio.

Ive never seen you as a mutual fund type so I dont think that ETF's will garner
much interest for you. I tend to use them for an intermidiate play. the last
one was GRID when I though the smart meter industry would fare well. I Was
really waiting for silver spring to come publicc, but wanted to be in the space
if they had become a hot deal. Its just an arrow in the quiver.

Paul -

For retail companies (in general) how is tangible BV calculated when valuing
their inventory? Is it at their cost or current market (liquidation) value? I
understand cash but inventory if valued too high could be trouble to liquidate
even if it was valued at 50%.

I also wonder how much that tangible BV number reported in advfn lags the
actual value (at least 6 months?). If so, I agree w/ you that at $12.67 price
looks tempting. I have never had too much success buying retail companies as
they spiral down based on a value buy. I have had success buying on the turn
and playing the momentum higher but getting out was always the problem.

I will add this one on the watch list because if the are a survivor, they are
probably pretty near their lows.

FWIW, Schwab's StreetSmartEdge Research module shows SKX tamgible BV at $17.01
($0.08 less than BV) and cash/share of $7.04. Schwab rates the company as an F.
Earnings est 12/2012 -$0.05. Stock pretty close to a five year low (except for
3/2009 crash hit $5.50/share w/ quick recovery to $11.00/share).

SKX.

SKX says, " Inventory write-downs . Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
or market. We review our inventory on a regular basis for excess and slow
moving inventory. Our review is based on inventory on hand, prior sales and our
expected net realizable value. Our analysis includes a review of inventory
quantities on hand at period end in relation to year-to-date sales, existing
orders from customers and projections for sales in the near future. The net
realizable value, or market value, is determined based on our estimate of sales
prices of such inventory based upon historical sales experience on a style by
style basis. A write-down of inventory is considered permanent and creates a
new cost basis for those units. The likelihood of any material inventory
write-down is dependent primarily on our expectation of future consumer demand
for our product. A misinterpretation or misunderstanding of future consumer
demand for our product or of the economy, or other failure to estimate
correctly, could result in inventory valuation changes, either favorably or
unfavorably, compared to the requirement determined to be appropriate as of the
balance sheet date. Our gross inventory value was $402.2 million and $227.7
million and our inventory reserve was $3.6 million and $3.7 million, at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively."

Inventory levels have come down. As reported in the quarterlies:
12/10: $399M
1/11: $376M
3/11: $326M
6/11: $238M

I presume this is all a positive. Maybe there's yet to be a huge write-off
though. If it happens, it may tank the stock. Imo, it'll be a one-time issue,
and the company and stock will recover. (eventually)

Part of being in retail is effectively managing inventory levels: taking
inventory mark-downs as appropriate, offering discounts to move merchandise,
using factory outlet/warehouse outlet stores. And on the other side of it-
making sure stores have enough inventory levels. Given the controlling
stockholder family and their experience in the fashion footwear business, I'm
believe they have enough savvy and experience to recover from any inventory
mistakes they may encounter. The "Shape-ups" business certainly though was THE
big inventory overstock problem for them.

Yeah, retail companies can quickly spiral downward. Especially if analysts see
same-store comparables (sales) not improving (growing).

I'm holding a couple of losing positions: RSH, which I've mentioned earlier
today, and also SMRT. I have some that seem to be okay or at least staying
close to my cost. Fwiw, I'm still accumulating WAG.

Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Common St (SKX) -NYSE

To put their inventory amount into perspective. A 100% write down is worth
$4.85/share. With a $17.01 tangible BV, their inventory only represents 29% of
the TBV. So the stock at a price of $12.16 would be selling at TBV when you
value the inventory at $0.00.

Therefore, the risk/reward might be pretty good even if the economy sours. So I
guess the question is can they generate enough sales to cover their costs while
they advance their next hot new shoe line.

It will be interesting to see how this story plays out.

Hi Paul -

AGL Resources, Inc. Common Stoc (GAS) - Hold
MDU Resources Group, Inc. Commo (MDU) - Hold
Atmos Energy Corporation Common (ATO) - Buy

Link to detailed Yahoo Finance listings for the companies listed above :
http://goo.gl/LUDgi

I too am very Bullish on the transition to LNG but it will take time and will
probably be a losing proposition w/o government subsides and/or until
infrastructure is built that reach break even economies of scale.

The middle of the road proposition is to invest in those companies that already
have large NG and LNG operations including pipeline distribution networks and
storage assets.

All three companies listed above are ones I own but GAS & MDU are selling at
their high end of their valuation. <u>I continue to wait on GAS. As of
2/24/2012 their PE was 19.02</u>. This is the latest figure I could find that
reflects the merged operations of AGL and Nicor (
http://ir.aglr.com/Tearsheet.ashx?c=79511 ). It's still too high for me to add
shares. I have not seen any analysts estimates for the combined company so I
have no idea where their Forward PE is headed (lower than 19?).

The same is true for MDU, so I am a seller of shares around $23.00/share and a
buyer below $19.00/share. The analysts have a Forward PE of $16 so their
expected earnings forecast are increasing which is good so I may raise my Buy
target below $20.00.

My overall target PE is 15 as long as the company can maintain a 4% dividend.
You might want to look at Atmos Energy Corporation Common (ATO). This is one I
will probably move up on my add list. Their PE is 14 w/ a Forward PE of 12.
Their dividend yield is 4.3%. Company just went ex-dividend on 2/23/2012, so it
is selling near it's lows. The company has a collection of excellent NG assets
that include 3M customers (including commercial, public authority & industrial)
all who are good candidates to use LNG in their fleet vehicles. They own very
profitable pipeline gathering & distribution systems. Their NG storage assets
include five underground storage reservoirs in Texas so their storage resources
are near the source.

Of the three companies ATO has the smallest underground storage capability (but
still quite large) but for the price IMO is the best value proposition now. The
one negative, it ATO carries a bit more overall debt than GAS and MDU but
owning operations in the regulated side can pretty much set their price to
service that debt as long as they follow the regulatory procedures.

That's the way I see it and I am still quite bullish on the industry.

FWIW, I also have been buying the actual NG commodity in XCO. My buy target is
below $7.00/share. The historical ratio of $Oil/$NG is out of kilter even with
the glut of NG in the market. It very well could go lower (and I will buy more)
but to me the value proposition gets better especially when articles appear
that mention new LNG fueling stations.

I love to buy straw hats in the Winter time (for 50 cents on the dollar) when I
can sell them during Summer time (for 80 cents on the dollar). I believe this
will be the case for NG at some point in the next 3-5 years.

Fwiw, two stocks mentioned in Barron's that I'm interested in (own) are DAR and
VLO:

"WHAT'S IN A NAME? With mid-cap
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=dar (DAR),
not what you might expect. For one thing, only 10% or so of its sales are
outside the U.S. Second, Darling takes animal byproducts from slaughtering
houses, as well as cooking oil and bakery waste from restaurants and other food
establishments, and recycles them into bone and poultry meal, tallow, and other
products. Not so darling.

Unsurprisingly, the company doesn't attract much Wall Street attention. With
the stock price at 16.46 and down about 14% from 52-week highs, investors don't
seem to be expecting good things out of Darling, but that could be
shortsighted.

Irving, Texas-based Darling has a few things going right for it—factors known
to the market over the past 12 months—yet the stock price doesn't seem to
reflect all the improvements likely over the next 12 months or so.

First among them is the $872 million acquisition of Griffin Industries in late
2010, which has clearly raised Darling's earnings profile. In each of the first
three quarters of 2011, sales and profits have roughly tripled. But if the
stock price is any measure—up only 43% from the announcement Nov. 9, 2010—this
has yet to completely seep into investor consciousness.

With a $2.2 billion enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) and annual
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization now running
about $400 million, the EV/Ebitda ratio is 5.5 times. That's 10% below the
company's average of six times. Darling has been steadily profitable since
2001. It already paid down about half the debt incurred for Griffin, and the
balance sheet is strong, with $314 million in long-term debt.

It's an underappreciated stock, says Robert Auer, a portfolio manager at SB
Auer Funds. He's owned Darling "on and off" but has been buying shares lately.
"It's the Wal-Mart of rendering," and it doesn't get credit for that at the
current price.

Auer likes the 50/50 Diamond Green Diesel joint venture with refiner
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=vlo (VLO),
which will take some underutilized Darling products and turn out 9,300 barrels
a day of diesel fuel. That plant should be up and running by early 2013 and
could add as much as $50 million to Darling's Ebitda next year. That would take
the EV/Ebitda ratio down to about five times.

The price/earnings ratio of 10 times the 2011 earnings projection of $1.55 a
share is undemanding, as well, Auer adds. Investors will find out more Feb. 29,
when the company releases fourth-quarter results.

One caveat to keep in mind is that Darling will begin to lap post-Griffin
results in the second quarter, so growth might slow. Still, there's likely
another 10% to 25% more in this stock as investors come to appreciate Darling's
post-Griffin charms and Diamond Green Diesel.

In case you are wondering, the name comes from the man who founded the company
in 1882: Ira Darling."

=================================
Article also mentions several banks that have been demutualized and that might
be takeover candidates. I don't follow that subsector of investing now; the
particular stocks though may be of interest to others here who do.
=================================
And JNJ: I've looked again at JNJ and again will pass on it. The article sums
up my reasons to avoid the stock:

"Last Tuesday's announcement that
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=jnj (JNJ)
veteran Alex Gorsky will take over the CEO helm didn't appease investors. The
shares fell about 1% after the news. The health-care giant's spate of problems
are better explained elsewhere (see
http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052748703754104577239281444477016.h
ml ). JNJ remains a quality company with a diverse stream of revenues and a
nice dividend yield, 3.5%, but Gorsky's task is formidable. Changes will take
time and JNJ's once-vaunted reputation is eroding. Its stock has basically
matched the S&P 500 index in the 10 years ended 2011. At $65, it isn't
particularly cheap, with a price/earnings ratio of nearly 13 times.

The depth of the market disaffection is summed up by Matt McCormick, a money
manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, and a former devotee of JNJ who
sold out of JNJ in the first quarter of 2011: "JNJ has to show more top-line
growth and…demonstrate results to clean up quality control before I'll buy
again."

JNJ is a show-me stock. Choosing an outsider might have sent a stronger signal.
Changes will have to be seen to be believed, and JNJ is most likely dead money
until then."

A stock viewed somewhat in the same way by me ("a show-me" stock) is Hospira.
For this one I did buy a few tracking shares a week or so ago. If company can
get its quality/regulatory issues resolved, the stock price might improve.

C&J Energy Services, Inc. Commo (NYSE: CJES) - Closed out my small position
GreenHunter Energy Inc Common s (AMEX: GRH) - looking to start a small tracking
position
Heckmann Corporation Common Sto (NYSE: HEK)

Financial links to Companies mentioned: http://goo.gl/uzHve

Hi Labrador -

I closed out my small position in CJES after they reported earnings last week.
The company generates a lot of free flow cash, is very profitable, carries no
debt but may be expanding too fast. In their earnings report, they stated that
they have two new FRAC fleets yet to be contracted under their standard two
year term and one more being built to be delivered at the end of the year (not
under contract). Further more, they have one of their FRAC fleets coming off a
two year contract (next month) that hopefully will be renewed for another two
year term to the same client. The company has a limited history in this field
never experiencing the "bust" period in the cycle. Since I had a 25% gain in
less than 1 month, I figured I would book the profit and look for an entry
point below $17.5 on any significant sell off.

Is CJES a value proposition? Based on their low PE, zero debit & huge free flow
cash, I would say yes. Could they liquidate their equipment at cost in a "bust"
cycle? Probably not but if their specialty services and parts business expands
as fast as their fracking business, they could weather a potential slow down
much better. IMO, the Buy in point is key since at the right entry price (ie
below $17.5/share), you are buying earnings at a very discounted price even if
50% of their fracking fleet goes offline. Also, they do have a pretty good
parts business, so one or more of their fleets could be used as parts inventory
in a worse case sereno.

GreenHunter Energy Inc Common s (AMEX: GRH) serves the same boom sector
providing salt water waste disposal from fracking as well as continued well
monitoring services. The value proposition will be in the combined
environmental services they will provide once they ramp up their service
business. I am valuing the company similar to Heckmann Corporation Common Sto
(NYSE: HEK) which is selling 3x that of GRH. <u>GRH is NOT a typical value
company but it's the potential value that is being created by the CEO Gary
Evans.</u>

Two recent events for GRH announced last week include (1)GreenHunter Water
Closes on Significant Acquisition of Appalachian Commercial Water Disposal
Facilities and (2) the development of Web based "real time" Well monitoring
systems called RAMCAT (Remote Access Management Compliance Asset Tracking. The
$8M acquisition for the disposal wells were negotiated w/ restricted common
equity and a preferred series w/ an 8% rate, no direct (bank) debt was used.
According to the press release last week, the deal comes w/ $15M in annual
revenues from the ongoing business that will be merged w/ the other services
the company now provides.

The potential for huge cash flows for GRH is based on what the environmental
service sector now obtains; the ability to maintain high margins in excess of
60% over the term of their client service contracts. The next key event for GRH
is to obtain one or more exclusive long term client service contracts which I
expect to occur since CEO EVANS is also CEO of MHR the E&P company. As Evans
expands the Triad Hunter Midstream business, I also expect GRH's RAMCAT service
to be expanded to provide "real-time" well monitoring on all the wells in their
gathering system. This would not only include MHR's operated wells but all of
the other owner/operators that supply NG & Oil to the Midstream gathering
system. Evans is building a complete end-to-end environmental service company
specific to the boom in the new shale wells drilled and put into operation.
Their use of state-of-the-art technology to monitor these wells (cameras, flow
sensors etc) for leaks and/or other environmental issues will generate monthly
reoccurring revenues and help reduce owner's/operators liability insurance
costs.

Foreign tax credit: "I also found out i didnt get a credit for the full amount
of taxes paid. only a percentage."

I found that to be true in my situation also.

For small players, the last time I looked (2010) I concluded: Form 1116 can be
ignored if your total creditable foreign taxes are $300 or less ($600 or less
on a joint return) and you meet certain other requirements. You just had to put
that foreign tax credit amount on line 47 of p. 2 of the 1040, and that was it.
The person/couple got the full credit against their taxes. (Assuming of course
the person/couple's tax for the year was over $300/$600.)

For foreign taxes withheld totaling over $600 for joint return filers (my
situation), if I want the credit applied directly against my taxes (as opposed
to just taking a deduction for the amount of foreign taxes withheld), then I
have to complete Form 1116. And you only get the full credit applied to your
tax amount if you have foreign income in a ratio to overall income that's
deemed acceptable by the USA's Internal Revenue Service. If this income ratio
test isn't high enough (or maybe low enough ---not sure which--- it's all a
black hole to me ---- my accountant's computer does the numbers), the unused
(unapplied) foreign tax can be carried over to future years for an offset to
USA taxes in those future years. In my case, I've had withheld foreign taxes in
excess of $600 in each of the past few years. I notice that I'm in my third
year of carry-overs and of not having my foreign taxes fully recouped. That
carried-over amount is increasing each year. So in my experience, it is not a
given that the foreign tax is recouped 100% very easily or quickly.

Atmos Energy Corporation Common (ATO)

Increased my ATO position by 65% to slowly build my NG utility/pipeline/storage
companies. MDU and GAS are still my largest individual company holdings each
25% larger than my current ATO position. I like the mention (up thread) of
fueling station and NG Truck engine builders but am waiting for better "value"
buys of companies in this sector.

It's a little discouraging that the one company (Wesport Innovations) that is
developing some of the next generation NG technology is a Canadian company. Why
don't we see any of our US companies lead this development (like HON, TRW)?

If anybody discovers any 2nd tier NG integrators that offer a value
proposition, please post. I am looking to add other types of NG infrastructure
development, products, technologies and even companies that benefit from cheap
NG (like fertilizer/chemical companies) to add to my basket of NG related

From the article:"...This year it plans to sell its Eagle Ford and some other

Ford Shale (and 3.745 net acres in the Eaglebine). This seems like an entirely
believable statement, as previously large sales of Eagle Ford oil producing
acreage have sold in the range of $15,000 to $20,000 per acre.

The above sale along with other Lucas Energy actions is supposed to generate
$106.8 million in cash inflows in 2012. <u>Since Marathon Oil (MRO) is a JV
partner with Lucas Oil in the Eagle Ford, it seems likely that MRO will be the
company doing the buying.</u> This makes the sale at a good price a virtual
certainty. MRO has paid top dollar for large chunks of both the Eagle Ford and
the Bakken in the recent past...."

It is a very one sided piece that looks at RSH valuation only under the
assumption that BBY buys RSH. This acquisition is just a hypothetical exercise
right now and it's dangerous to use these assumption for a valuation. Ideally
you want to come out ahead in most scenarios, including the most likely ones (
those are rarely acquisitions) when purchasing the stock.

I have a different hypothesis on how BBY looks at RSH - they view it as a weak
competitor in the mobile space that they can gain market share from. BBY
prefers to build their stores in malls with a small footprint where there is
much more foot traffic than in RSH's strip mall stores.

Hi Grommit -

What's the best way to value companies like ARCC. Their tangible BV is $15.13
and analysts show 12/2011 earnings at $1.49/share. That puts the trailing PE at
11. Their dividend yield of 8.8% is quite attractive too. Several of the other
metrics ROA (7.6%), ROE (12.2%) or ROI (12.2%) seem very good too. Even the EK$
value at $22.5/share shows that the stock may still be 36% undervalued.

When did you first discover the company and what attracted you to it? I tend to
shy away from these management investment companies as I always thought they
were high risk. However, their performance (at least over the last three years)
during the 2009 market crash has been quite good.

I bought shares last summer. Your observation (below) about performance during

>I tend to shy away from these management investment companies as I always

I agree because I got burned on ACAS. Fortunately, ACAS tanked when pref shares
were also down, so I traded my losing ACAS for cheap pref shares (remember the
days) which have since doubled+.

>However, their performance during the 2009 market crash has been quite good.
yes -- very reassuring. the dividend only dropped a little. note that ARCC

re ATO@30.8$, PEP @63.12$

I followed you into ATO at 30.8$. low return (high single digits/year) but very
low risk sort of situation. I figure that a 4.4% dividend yield and a 5% (maybe
growth rate/year) would lead to an 9-10% estimated return (assuming multiples
don't change) in my very simlpe dividend growth model.

PEP is somewhat similar, with less initial dividend (3.3%) yield but a higher
growth components (5-10% range). If we are lucky we could do low single digit
returns over the years. I think I'll make that a permanent position in my and
plan to add from time to time. Got some for my wife's "sleep well IRA" and my

Sorry Sergio, I really can not make a value proposition for the electric car.
Unless the electricity is produced from a nuclear power plant. It is more
efficient to have the power plant in the car. An an efficient engine like a
diesel or hybrid are very good now.

From several of the Electric Car analysis I have read, no one factors in the
cost or battery replacement and battery disposal. Replacement batteries are
required after 7-10 years and the environmental disposal/recycling costs are
large.

The diesel hybrid is probably the most efficient vehicle under development. I
believe VW and Mercedes have prototypes under development.

There are some companies that offer LNG fueling from a device connected at your
home using your NG line. It compresses the fuel and can refuel a car in about
90 minutes. The problem w/ NG is the driving range from a tank full of LNG.
It's about 60% that of gas and/or diesel.

I continue to look for U.S. companies that can advance the different
technologies. TRW has a division working on NG but it is small compared to the
company size. TRW is sort of a value play. That is where I am looking now.

FWIW the last car I bought was a VW Passat diesel (2005) and it gets 35mpg,
runs a 10% blend of bio-diesel and you can go 600 miles on a tankful of fuel.

Their 2012 models are even more efficient. I believe these cars are now built
in VW's new Kentucky plant.

I see NG being used by companies for local delivery and local routes with these

vehicles to electric vehicles. Infrastucture will be needed to provide charging
stations as these cars develop into full usage transportation as opposed to
local usage only.

Adding to the recent ETF discussion...amazing how deployment of ETF's are so
quick to adapt to public interest. http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=frak&ql=1

<On Wednesday, Feb. 15, Van Eck launched an energy-oriented exchange-traded
fund holding companies involved in what Van Eck calls "unconventional" oil and
natural gas.
Although energy-related ETFs abound,Market Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas ETF
has a unique mandate. The term "unconventional" refers in part to methods of
exploration and extraction and as such includes oil sands, oil shales, tight
sand, coalbed methane, and shale gas, all of which have become more common in
recent years. Because these types of extractions may be geographically
extensive or deeply embedded in underground rock formations, they may be
difficult to perform without the use of developing technologies. And some of
the developing technologies employed by the firms held in FRAK are
controversial technologies like hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") and
horizontal drilling.
Fracking in particular has been opposed by some environmentalists and by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has complained that the process,
which involves using pressurized fluids to create or expand cracks in
underground rock formations to release oil or natural gas for extraction, can
contaminate groundwater with arsenic or copper. Environmentalists also have
complained that the process can cause fracking chemicals to rise to the
surface. The energy industry has disputed these allegations, and asserts that
the fracking process has not polluted wells that provide drinking water.
Beyond fracking, the U.S. has unlocked significant domestic oil and gas
reserves recently, largely because of the unconventional exploration and
extraction methods employed by the kinds of companies held in FRAK. Among the
new ETF's top holdings are Occidental Petroleum, Canadian Natural Resources,
and EOG Resources.
FRAK tracks a Van Eck-managed index of 43 firms. The new ETF charges 0.54%.

OT - (Maybe not OT if you look at the cost to produce electricity as a value
play)

Sergio -

What is the argument for the production of low cost electricity? Are the
batteries charged from the "grid" that is powered by coal and/or NG power
plants? Basic physics teaches us that there is an inefficiency in producing a
unit of energy, transmitting it and storing it (loss due to heat, friction etc)
vs directly producing it to power an engine.

I am just not convinced all of the economics have been worked out for an
electric car if one looks at all of the resources used from end-to-end.

The best "value" argument I have seen in this field is what Bloom Energy is
doing.

http://www.bloomenergy.com/

This is a fuel cell that produces electricity directly from NG. There is a
point where if the price of Oil reaches some level, it becomes cost effective
to use these types of fuel cells to generate electricity directly (aka
Distributive Power) from very cheap natural gas. For me the value proposition
comes full circle back to NG.

These fuel cells are not there yet, but the developer stated that at some point
the economy of scale would be reached where a small size refrigerator size
Bloom Box (the size needed to power a typical U.S. home) would cost $20K and
combined with $2.50/cmf NG would provide the world's energy needs. This is the
piece of "disruptive" technology that would fuel the advancement of the
electric car IMO.

If you owe 1.92$ PD(in the ground, add lifting and transportation cost ~1$/PD)
and the spot price for PD (above the ground) is 2.5$ you are basically
underwater. I can easily see the equity going to zero in this case.

Check the 4th quarter review for the relevant numbers:
