EKS Overstock, Brocade LSI,
I cannot comment on Overstocks and Brocade as I have not analysed those stocks.
Brocade looks reasonably attractive based upon a look at yahoo's data. On LSI i
have a strong and negative opinion:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=20663878

The company has destroyed at lot of value and will continue to do so in the
future as programmable logic eats away their market. LSI might be off better
going fabless but then they would have to write off their trailing edge chip
plants and the stock would not look cheap any more with respect to price/book.

Spek, I know ISIL pretty well as it bought my XICO shares. I would not be too
apologetic about it being a value stock. The company has $735M of cash and safe
investments ($5 per share) and a healthy amount of free cash flow. If you take
out the cash you are getting a high margin business at a pretty good valuation.
Of course, the company is dead in the water now and the stock is acting poorly
- so your multiple buy strategy on declining prices is appropriate.

Dynasil Announces First Quarter Fiscal Year 2005 Results

WEST BERLIN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 24, 2005--Dynasil Corporation of
America (OTCBB:DYSL), fabricator of optical blanks from synthetic fused silica,
fused quartz, and other optical materials for the semi-conductor, laser, space
and optical components industries, announced results of operations for the 1st
quarter ended December 31, 2004.
Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 were $781,186, an increase of
25% over revenues of $622,494 for the quarter ended December 31, 2003. The net
profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 was $6,074, or less than $.01
per share, compared with a net loss of $26,036, or a negative $.01 per share,
for the quarter ended December 31, 2003.
"Order entry for the quarter was up 48% over the first quarter of fiscal year
2004 and we continue to focus on our strategy of profitable growth from our
optical materials business and by pursuing acquisitions," said Craig T. Dunham,
who was named President and CEO of Dynasil Corporation effective October 1,
2004. "We believe that the revenue increases are coming from improved economic
conditions in our markets combined with proactive sales and marketing efforts
that include offering new optical materials and pursuing new business. During
the quarter, we also completed Dynasil's leadership transition. The expenses
from that transition reduced quarter profits by $32,400 and without those
expenses, earnings per share would have been $0.01 per share. We also believe
that, if consummated, our previously announced acquisition of Optometrics LLC
will double our revenues and significantly enhance profitability. The closing
date for the Optometrics acquisition is currently scheduled for February 17,
2005. I am very pleased that Dynasil delivered its first profitable quarter in
several years and with our progress on the Optometrics acquisition," added Mr.
Dunham.

About Dynasil: Founded in 1960, Dynasil Corporation of America is a fabricator
of optical blanks from synthetic fused silica, fused quartz and other optical
materials. For over four decades, Dynasil has provided high quality synthetic

MLNM - once more again i entered a position in MLNM. the steeet didn't like
forward guidance on Velcade sales. I am somewhat disappointed in Velcade also
as I expected more activity with solid tumors. So it seems that Velcade's
market is limited to leukemia. On the other hand, MLNM's valuation is not
demanding and they still ought to be able to reach profitability with the two
drugs they have on the market. Today's R&D alliance with UCB tells that there
is potential in MLNM's R&D pipeline as well.

I have found GM interesting to look into precisely because of the yield. But
I'm always afraid to enter. They generate huge operating cash flow but over the
last ten years even more cash goes for capex. And yet sales trends are not
favorable. So if the capex does not help to produce sales increases, or reduce
production costs, etc, seems like just treading water. Then there is the huge
and growing debt load.

I'm probably too much of a novice to see the benefits of buying GM at this
point, but it seems to me the risk factors outweigh the potential. P/B is low
historically, but who can say if it will return to prior levels or if it is
permanently adjusted as is.

Hard to find positive comments on GM in the media. I'm still holding a losing
position, considering selling, but maybe with all the negativity I believe I am
seeing as regards the General, a bottom is near - so I'll hold. Figure I'll add
under $30 - if stock gets that low and I don't get scared out before then.

If forward p/e on GM is 10, that's about what it is for Toyota. While GM is
developing hybrids, TM is already there - or at least much further ahead. TM
revenue is still increasing while GM's isn't. At current prices (TM's stock
down a bit past few days) and the outlook for GM vs. TM as I see it - I'm no
expert though - I'd rather have TM, and I've added a few shares today. My
intent is to keep building up my TM bet and hope TM performance - company and

interesting, in my research today i was noting that housing stocks are among
the best sector during this january correction, with most 1 or 2% off their
highs, and TOL at a new high

clearly my view of the housing market is 180 degrees from yours, as i see
strong prices in various locations, but not much of a bubble, and certainly
nothing about to burst, but do you think these stocks would be doing this well
if a bubble burst was imminent? the market always looks 6 to 12 months ahead,
and the housing numbers continue to come in at record levels, in terms of
permits, starts and sales

time will tell, but according to the doomsayers, the supposed bubble was going
to burst 4 or 5 years ago, and since then we went through 9/11 and a recession
with no signs of weakness at all...check the starting date of the housing
bubble crash thread, or whatever it's called, for a continual hearty
laugh....in the current fairly strong and growing economy, are we more likely
to have a housing market crash than during those conditions? not IMHO, but
that's just me

ironically, all of that said, i don't own any housing stocks at this point,
though i may buy some SPF calls ahead of their report wednesday afternoon

note the main problem with that rydex fund...in 2000 the naz was over 4000, and
now it's barely over 2000, yet the fund is worth less now than it was in
2000...therefore, if you owned the naz in 2000 and hedged it with this fund,
your stocks would be down over 50%, and your hedge would also have lost
money....sure, timing can improve this, but if you are that good at timing, you
don't need a hedge anyway

it did pay a capital gain of about 2 bucks in 2002, but this doesn't mitigate
much of the above

since the lows at around 1100, the naz has gained about 80%, and the fund has
lost about 80%

note that if the naz was to go back to 1100 (very unlikely), the fund would not
return to the 120 level, but would likely go from its current 23 price to about
40..for you to sell that fund over 100 bucks again, the naz would have to go to
some negative number (i would have to say that is unlikely...lol)

investment math: buy 100 bucks of stock A, which then drops 80%, now worth 20
bucks...stock A now gains 80%, and is then worth 36 bucks

i don't think your hedging ratios are correct, and whereas hedging with options
has a fixed cost, your cost of hedging with these funds is unknown....if the
market starts higher, your cost increases until you sell the funds...again, if
you are that good at timing, just sell your stocks at the highs and save your
cash for the lows (good luck)

Leveraged RYDEX funds,

The problem with these leveraged rydex funds (or anything at a fixed leverage
percentage as opposed to a fixed leverage amount) is that the sell low and buy
high in order to maintain their fixed leverage percentage. They also have
extremely high expenses. Over long periods of time, this will underperform.

For that reason, IMO they are best for short-term market timing. I'd rather
just short say a Russell or Nasdaq-type ETF if I wanted to protect my
portfolio, because I don't know how long I'd need the protection. If you can
short stock futures, that's even better because you don't tie up so much of
your money and/or need to worry about getting a borrow.

Or Carl Worth's suggestion of going to cash is good, unless you like your
stocks currently but want protection from a big market move.

> All of my new purchases are canadian stocks.

That's interesting, because I too have decided that the US market, for a bunch
of reasons, is not great right now for the kinds of deals we like here, so my
own research has also focused on Canada recently.

My most promising Canadian find so far is CCL Industries. I don't have time for
details here, but the current valuation seems surprisingly low. CCL is a
profitable 50-year-old Toronto-based international packaging conglomerate a la
Crown, Cork & Seal (and in fact sold off a canning subsid in 1989 to CCS). I
was initially turned on to them when I found out CCL designed and supplies this
new aluminum beer bottle for Pittsburgh Brewing Company (I live in Pittsburgh).
Apparently, they can barely keep up with demand for the new type of bottle.
Share volume of CCL is extremely low, and so requires some care in buying any
significant quantities (patience and phone quotes from TSE). Both the class A
and B shares pay a modest (~2%) dividend. On the possibly negative side, the
class B shares are non-voting, and these are the only ones I've been able to
purchase so far since volume for class A is really, really low. Hopefully this
will change with time.

> I wonder how many of you keep journals relating to purchases and sales of
stocks and your rationale at the time for doing so.

I don't, but my turnover is so low that I could write them down easily (and
maybe I should take that as a suggestion). I prefer to focus on only 5-10
stocks and follow for 5-10 years, so my main holdings since 1998 have been a
few companies like RNR, DSWL, FR... some of which I'm very grateful for this
thread in bringing to my attention over the years.

Regarding Graham Net-Nets: You were not looking hard enough. Below is part of a
memo I wrote August 19, 2002--BTW I have also analyzed the performance of those
585 net nets to 2004 and have discussed it here before:

Start:

"It always seemed, and still seems, ridiculously simple to say that if one can
acquire a diversified group of common stocks at a price less than the
applicable net current assets alone - after deducting all prior claims, and
counting as zero the fixed and other assets - the result should be quite
satisfactory."

- Benjamin Graham,

The Intelligent Investor, 1973

Selecting stocks that trade below Net Current Asset Value has historically
outperformed the market averages by a wide margin. The following was taken from
"What Has Worked in Investing" by Tweedy, Browne and Company (See Exhibit A
attached):

"In an article in the November-December 1986 issue of Financial Analysts
Journal, "Ben Graham's Net Current Asset Values: A Performance Update", Henry
Oppenheimer, an Associate Professor of Finance at the State University of New
York at Binghamton, examined the investment results of stocks selling at or
below 66% of net current asset value during the l3-year period from December
31, 1970 through December 31, 1983.

The study assumed that all stocks meeting the investment criterion were
purchased on December 31 of each year, and replaced on December 31 of the
subsequent year by stocks meeting the same criterion on that date. To create
the annual net current asset portfolios, Oppenheimer screened the entire
Standard & Poor's Security Owners Guide. The entire 13-year study sample size
was 645 net current asset selections from the New York Stock Exchange, the
American Stock Exchange and the over-the-counter securities market. The minimum
December 31 sample was 18 companies and the maximum December 31 sample was 89
companies.

The mean return from net current asset stocks for the 13-year period was 29.4%
per year versus 11.5% per year for the NYSE-AMEX Index. One million dollars
invested in the net current asset portfolio on December 31, 1970 would have
increased to $25,497,300 by December 31, 1983. By comparison, $1,000,000
invested in the NYSE-AMEX Index would have increased to $3,729,600 on December
31, 1983.

The study also examined the investment results from the net current asset
companies which operated at a loss (about one-third of the entire sample of
firms) as compared to the investment results of the net current asset companies
which operated profitably. The firms operating at a loss had slightly higher
investment returns than the firms with positive earnings: 31.3% per year for
the unprofitable companies versus 28.9% per year for the profitable companies.

Further research by Tweedy, Browne has indicated that companies satisfying the
net current asset criterion have not only enjoyed superior common stock
performance over time but also have often been priced at significant discounts
to "real world" estimates of the specific value that stockholders would
probably receive in an actual sale or liquidation of the entire corporation.

Net current asset value ascribes no value to a company's real estate and
equipment, nor is any going concern value ascribed to prospective earning power
from a company's sales base." End

I have been focusing our computer screens on the NCAVS for the last couple of
months.

On August 7, 2002 our computer screen revealed 585 companies selling below Net
Current Asset Value.

Of this total 152 companies (26% of total) had positive return on equity for
the previous twelve months. END

For some reason SI will not post the 585 stock symbols for the positve and
negative roes. Very strange.

Thanks for the correction. I'm surprised (and disappointed)I missed so many of

Just going through some of those stocks now, Brinks, to see why I might have
missed so many, and where they are now. I randomly picked some stocks beginning
with letters a, c and d. Some of the stock symbols don't exist anymore (when I
ask for a Yahoo quote), and some stocks that do exist don't look anywhere near
net-nets anymore.

I hit CLST and that stock DOES look like it's now, or still, a net-net. Yahoo's
latest data is Aug. 31 '04, and it shows current assets = $452M, total lia. =
$321M and 20.4M shares out. That makes net-net number = $6.42/sh. 2/3 of that
is $4.30/sh. The stock's selling for $3.19/sh.
The company isn't profitable now (Graham's were all profitable, I believe -
although the study you mentioned said unprofitable net-net stocks on avg. did a
little better than profitable ones). The data I'm using (8/04) is outdated, and
the company's performance seems to continue to have eroded. Nevertheless, I'll
make a small bet, and take a few shares.

Anybody else see any net-nets (or have any comment on CLST as a net-net)?

Interesting - I keep a list of all buys and sells with a few words comment on
each transaction. All sells show whether the sale was a profit or a loss. I
also go back to all buy trades and indicate if the trade was eventually a
profit or a loss.

Reviewing your trading logs like that shows your pattern of decisions and their
results - for better or worse, you see every time you pulled the trigger and
why.

Occasionally, I see a gross mistake and actually understand why it was a
mistake.

It's not a magic cure, but it sure helps improve your decisionmaking process

Whether sold at a gain or sold at a loss and why - that is only half the story
as far as I'm concerned.

I want to know what happened to the money. Was the money re-invested in a stock
that performed much better than the sold stock? Did a sold-at-a-loss stock
subsequently recover and do okay or better than the new purchase? Or did the
sold-at-a-gain stock just keep moving up - gaining much more than the new
purchase? I've got several like that. I consider that being wrong twice - and I
like to know what my reasoning was at that sale/purchase time. Or if the new
purchase did what I expected and the sold stock remained stagnant or dropped as
I guessed, I'd like to know that as well.

The problem for me though is tracking all this. It's like a chain: A sold, B
then bought, then sold, then C bought. Too complicated; I've mostly given up
tracking like that.

Since I stay fully invested most of the time, I can look at buys soon after a
sell and estimate where the funds went. I do look at whether a stock I sold
went up after, and whether I made a good decision to sell.

For example, I sold NPSN around 76 where I considered it to be fair value. I
put the funds in FMT at 17 and made half of what I would have made holding
NPSN.

But when I look at the numbers in both stocks then, I made the right decision
according to my system.

I can see where holding 3-4x the number of stocks I do would make tracking it
all more complicated.

And trading around the core position. That can make profits in a stock much
different from just looking at a stock and figuring it was just a 50% gainer
from the time of first buy until sale of core holdings. Or selling core
holdings on scale up (or scale down). For people who buy/sell this way, it's
sometimes very difficult to track reinvested funds and see what a better
decision might have been.

The company has plenty of cash; current ratio is 6.3:1. Stock is now under

I keep a list of all buys and sells with a few words comment on each
transaction.

I've been experimenting with different approaches to do this over the years,
from Word docs to spreadsheets to Yahoo to 3 ring binders to spreadsheets
again. I am trying to force more discipline and documentation on myself to
counter the risk taking, competitive personality that I have, which can lead to
impulsive mistakes. It is also important to me that I have a system that I will
use and that won't be too time consuming or cumbersome.

I know I have become "PC centric" over the years (I now do most of my news
reading on the internet instead of newspapers, for example) so I decided a
simple spreadsheet would be best for me rather than turning to binders or
notebooks. It tracks purchase/sell dates, prices, returns, and most
importantly, reasons or thoughts or goals (trade vs. long term). I just started
a row to track my monthly performance vs. the indexes.

Any other tracking approaches that people have used that they can recommend?
What systems do people use to track all the ideas (watchlist) easily and
efficiently? I haven't come up with an approach that I like...

I finished January down .86% vs. Dow down 2.7% and Nasdaq down 5.2%.

Even though I did 22% with CLF (posted here) I regret selling it a few weeks
ago as it has run another $11 to $66. Damn.

Steve,

Technology stocks, in general, are interesting value plays since many value
investors shun them since the technology sector changes rapidly.

I remember reading a short piece about one value investor who will invest in
technology stocks, but they have to be cheap and be relatively stable. This
investor looks for tech. stocks that are trading at an EV/R of less than .5,
Enterprise Value defined as Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash & Cash Equiv.

Within tech stocks, the reason why, at times, book value can become meaningless
is the sheer amount of "non-tangible" assets on a companies balance sheet due
to their M&A activity.

From the new-lows list, I'll take a tiny exploratory position in Sirva, a

Problems with Sarbanes-Oxley perhaps, and the company found some accounting
errors.

Still, with over 7000 employees, the company remains (I assume) a force in the
relocation business. With our USA government continuing to move people all over
the world, there still should be business for SIR, and maybe better profits, if
SIR can resolve apparent regulation and accounting errors($21M-25M "errror"!)

P/sales seems reasonable. P/stated book is 1.25 per Yahoo. And ROE was 13.5%.

Steve168,

Your basic approach and the price-to-book study is fine, but you are picking up
some very risky stocks. Buying a basket of them is a good idea, but you
probably could do more to make things less painful in down markets. In the
future I would blend your stocks in with a lot more traditional value stocks
that are cheap on price-to-book basis, but also have some earnings, dividends,
and decent business prospects. The less risky stocks mentioned on this board
are a possible start.

In 2001-2002, I did buy a lot of your high cash type stocks, but the valuations
and cash burns were much more attractive at that time. I thought the downside
risk was much lower than what I see in the market today.

I have been in this business off and on now for almost half my life, I do
believe it is necessary to not get too high or too low. Anyone who has even
dabbled in this business who claims to have not gotten crushed is, more likely
than not, not being totally up front.

Some general comments:
We all have different value investing styles and goals. Either as a result of
this - or a precursor to this, we all mostly see and interpret things
differently. Even financial reports. Therefore, imo, it's to be expected that
we are each often contra-indicators for each other.

I assume everybody on this thread has posted at least one stock that either got
no response at the time or was dismissed or disparaged - and said stock
subsequently did very well, exceptionally well.

Sometimes the poster of said stock who comes back "just to update" seems to me
to get more gains from a psychological victory (haha I was right and you ALL
were wrong) than from what the capital gains actually brings.

Perhaps it's just the way people express themselves. To me though, there's a
difference between confirming a previous value pick (for the reason(s)
originally postulated, by a buyout, or maybe - to a lesser extent- "just
because" the stock moved up in a bull market) vs. stating the success in a way
that is not really helpful or educational to thread readers.

no, an idiot is someone who looks at a historical chart and imagines he could

5-Apr-01 80.46
4-Apr-01 102.44
3-Apr-01 98.41
2-Apr-01 85.17
30-Mar-01 79.41

you're telling me anyone who didn't catch the 1 single day during the entire
first half of the year that the fund was over 100 is an idiot? this is
ludicrous to the point of being hysterical...thanks for a great laugh

a few days later (april 19th), the fund closed at about 45 bucks, so it lost
over 50% in exactly two weeks...you tell me, a person who is long the fund
going into this stretch, is it more likely they sold at the high, or gave up on
their hedge approximately two weeks later, just at the wrong time, and sold at
the interim low? next time it's so obvious that the naz is in for a 10% one day
rally, please post here so we can all take advantage of that!

after selling, where would they get back in? using your "idiot" rationale, i
guess they would catch the low too to buy back in, and of course they would
know to be in before 9/11, because what "idiot" didn't know that was coming?
belaboring the point slightly, they would then know to get out on the friday of
the following week, and stay out well into the next year, as everyone said our
economy was screwed and the market rallied in spite of the doomsayers...i mean
i know i felt real confident buying on that friday, heck i bought a whole 100
shares of BAC, DELL, INTC, CSCO, and a few others that day because i was so
brave...i even held some of those stocks for a whole 2 trading days and sold
when i had made a couple points because at that point any gain seemed like a
great gain <G>

sorry if logic is incomprehensible to you...i didn't think it was that hard to
understand that if a stock drops 80%, and then gains 80%, you aren't back to
even, and i certainly didn't imagine that you would claim to be able to catch
the single best print on a fund for an entire half year or more...you must be a

Took an exploratory position in BCGI, and am not doing well with this one.

Apparently this prepaid wireless company has ridden on the backs of Verizon and
Cingular, and the latter two are taking the business inside:

"Earnings estimates reflect the previously announced expectation that Verizon
Wireless will continue to convert subscribers from bcgi's platform to its
internal platform, which is expected to be completed by the third quarter of
2005. In addition, the Company anticipates, as previously announced, that it
will continue to have fewer gross additions from Cingular Wireless."

Stock keeps dropping to new lows. At $7/sh. now, you get a profitable (for now)
company, about $4.43 in cash, no debt (per Yahoo), and a book value of
$7.64/sh. There've been no inside sales that I see (on Yahoo - which is not
necessarily current); there were some small insider buys last year between $6
and $10/sh.

Maybe this is almost another cash-in-search-of-a-business play. If so, and if
it's like some other similar situations that I've seen, then there's still a
decent likelihood (imo and guess) that the stock will drop even closer to it's
cash value. OTOH, with the company being profitable, the book value, and the
somewhat positive tone (of course!) of the pres. and ceo in Tue's 4q press
release, maybe the bottom might be around current level. In any case- has been
a VERY small bet for me.

Paul,

Thanks for the positive feedback. Brinks actually posted the Ticonderoga pick,
so he should the credit.

I don't mind too much if few people respond to my picks or comments --- I often
don't put up a response to other people's picks even if I buy one --- just too
lazy I guess, so I don't take it personally when people don't respond to mine.

Luckily I don't think I have too much ego --- as long as I am making money I
really don't need validation of my picks by others. This board and related
boards have been a fruitful place to make so money, so I am happy with how
things are going and encourage thoughtful investors to keep posting, even if
they don't get huge acclaim for their ideas.

Thanks
MC

muwis123, re: ZNDT. You provide some good reasons for purchase:

restructuring.
good scuttlebut. (hearing good things from ZNDT customers)
stock is cheap. (I note low debt/eq.)

For me,I have to pass on this one:
I've no knowledge of customer base.
Stock in past years has always looked cheap. Cheaper than currently from what I
can see. (b.v - which has not been growing - avg. at/under .5 for years
'00-'03. Now .68. P/sales now .58; has been below this number from '99-'03.
So... imo, could be looking at a value trap here - stock's mostly cheap and has
been cheaper. OTOH, if someone has confidence in the new products and the
possibilities of new management improving performance, the stock could be a
buy.
(I don't have any reason to be this confident)

One collectible-business stock that looks to me to be somewhat undervalued on a
historical basis (p/sales, p/bk) is Action Performance (ATN), which I am
interested in if I can purchase shares under $10. Could be argued here too that
that is also rear-view investing - I've no knowledge of management or product
lines here either - so possibly there's a good reason why this stock is down
and will continue to stay down.

all jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times

ZNDT addendum: Labor shortage in China? First time I've ever read of that.

"The year-on-year net sales growth was driven by the Zindart's Manufacturing
operations, reporting increased orders from both current and new customers and
full plant utilization for the half. Manufacturing division revenues grew 33
percent to $30.0 million in the first half of fiscal year 2005, compared to
$22.5 million in the same period the previous year. However, gross margins on
manufacturing revenues were unfavorably impacted by labor shortages in southern
China and rising oil prices."

KKD: How has dunkin' donuts been as an investment? Not sure if that's even
applicable. The franchise structure must be looked into as well as their leases
and any real estate value - could well be another Boston Chicken.

TPE: Hard pressed to find anything substantive. I don't trust the AMEX in
general nor a business I cannot value with any degree of certainty. Do a search
on SI and online for TPE and see what you find. The Brinks picks have intrigued
me for some time despite the "defensive self promotion of late" (who cares if
people don't see your successful record - and its great if people challenge
your ideas here, that's part and parcel of why we come here right?). Some great
ideas potentially. And the dialog b/t CW and Brinks is amusing too.

And CW- stand by my opinion on the home builders. Its only a matter of time....

By the way, ever see stocklemon.com (or something like that) - good stuff

sorry, you can't just make stupid statements and tell me your a CPA to validate
them

i see CPA's post on yahoo boards all the time who don't understand the first
thing about financial statements, portfolio management, or the market in
general...my father is a CPA, so i have the utmost respect for the title in
general, and he is the one who taught me much of what i now know about reading
financials....however, you have posted statements that make no sense at all, so
whether you are a CPA, an MD, or the secretary general of the UN, you still
have no credibility (actually, you probably still have more credibility than
the SG of the UN, but that's a whole other story <g>)...i have a BS in
electronic engineering, if i posted that i could make a computer out of
bananas, would you then believe me because of my degree?

again, i can see that facts leave you grasping at straws, and rather than
refuting anything i have said, all you can do is tell me to get a grip...i
won't belabor this discussion any further, as i'm sure the thread has had their
laughs and is getting tired of it...suffice it to say that if 25 years of
experience and a piece of paper made you successful in the markets, there would
be a lot more rich people in this country

thanks for some good laughs, and please remember to let us know when that next

to be clued in to that one (ahead of time of course, not 4 years in

Paul - Thanks for your comments on ZNDT. The results in the 99-03 period is
less relevant to me though. The company is refocused and should show
improvement over time going forward.

I have heard of ATN. They sell NASCAR related products. I have never been a fan
of racing, so I'm probably not the best person to judge the business.

homebuilders: it's only a matter of time until the stocks go down, at least for
a while, but where from, and where to? the doomsayers have been predicting the
"bubble burst" for 4 or 5 years, maybe longer

SPF, as an example, is up 5 fold in that time and currently trades at 72 with
over 30 bucks in tangible book value and over 10 bucks in earning power...is it
more likely to hit 90 or 50 first? i will keep my calls for a while and perhaps
convert them to shares before they expire, since i think 90 is more
likely...time will tell

Hi Paul - Another stock picker I talked to today mentioned his interest in KKD.
I really did not pay to much attention about this company after I heard some
reports about channel stuffing. I do not know how one would channel stuff
donuts but if there was some creative accounting, that may be the reason for
the low stock price. If you get a chance to do more research on this one,
please post your comments.

============================================================

Dividends are now categorized as "Qualified" or "Non-Qualified". Qualified
dividends receive a better tax treatment (I believe no higher than 15% for
Federal), while non-qualified dividends are treated as ordinary income. The
exact rules as to what makes a dividend qualified or non-qualified is complex
to me but I suspect many investors will just accept what is reported on their
1099 form especially for mutual fund holders.

From a brief review of the law, foreign ADR's, REITS and other "return of
principle investments" get treated as a "non-qualified" dividend and are
subject to the much higher tax rate (the highest tax bracket is 35% for
Federal). If I can save 20% in Federal Taxes by focusing on equivalent
"qualified" dividends, I would say this is another type of value investing.

Here is what I have discovered. There are some very high yielding Hybrid
Investment Units typically packaged as a "Preferred" stock that in many cases
carry the safety and low risk aspects of a bond but their dividends are treated
as "qualified dividends". Companies have used these HIU's in place of floating
corporate bonds in the last few years and are bought and sold like the common
stock.

One HIU unit I have been eyeing is the Albertsons Preferred A convertible that
was issued last year in order to finance their purchase of the Shaw's stores. A
424b4 SEC form was filed that covers the unique features of this preferred
equity
(http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=103172&p=irol-secToc&TOC=aHR0cDovL
NjYm4uMTBrd2l6YXJkLmNvbS94bWwvY29udGVudHMueG1sP2lwYWdlPTI3NzE4NDEmcmVwbz10ZW5r)

It pays a quarterly "qualified" dividend of $0.45 (7.46% yield) and can be
converted into the common according to a three tier conversion table based on
the 20 day average price of the common. On May 16, 2007 the preferred is
automatically converted into common shares.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=abs_p

My thought was while ABS works on their company turn around which may take
another 24 months, one could hold this preferred series, collect a nice
dividend and then receive a 1:1 conversion of shares in May 2007. This strategy
works as long as the common stock trades between $23-$28. The difference in the
common and the preferred series is (1) the price of the common ($23.36 & 3.27%
yield $0.19/qtr) and (2) the price of the preferred $24.55 & 7.46% yield
$0.45/qtr) or $1.19/share. There is aprox 8 more quarterly payments remaining
for the Preferred A series that generates $2.08/share more dividend income
($0.45/qtr-$0.19/qtr X 8qtr) Vs the $1.19/share stock price premium to buy the
series A preferred.

There is a possible capital gain of $3.45/share if the common reaches $28.
Therefore, you receive a 7 1/2% yield on the dividend and a potential 14%
capital gain on any conversion over $28 generating a 21% return for at most a
24 month holding period. The downside is if the stock falls below $20 on May
2007, you are stuck with a capital loss which negates the premium they have
paid in a higher dividend.

Anyway, I thought it was an interesting potential "value" investment that
provides a better income stream for the investor while waiting for the company
to complete it's restructuring.

Have you ever invested in any convertible preferred Hybrid Units? It appears
that there may be more value sometimes in the HIU unit than owning the common.

Have I missed something in my analysis?

Brinks, while I notice that your stock recommendations (DXT, SME.V and others)
others have performed very well, you are disappointed about the cool reception
on this thread apparently. The reason for this reception is that the way you
present your stocks does not fit the profile of most value investors here. Just
as an example, with Storm Cat you went into great elaboration with he Storm Cat
story but failed to mention the negatives (for example the fact that stock was
issued in private transactions at much lower prices etc.). Most investors here
appreciate a balanced review and a story too good to be true will only scare
them away. Also i think your own accomplishments (CPA, traded with Soros, 25
years of market experience) are of little interest to me and presumably to most
other thread participants.
That being said, i hope you might adjust your style a little to fit the nature
of this thread and keep the post coming. So far your stocks have done well
apparently and you are right, it is you own checkbook that counts (and I
presume that you are not in the business to make us rich anyways). Heck, I am
even along for the ride with dinky little TPE, since I believe it is worth a
good pop possibly and has downside protection because of unencumbered cash.

I don't think the fact that stocks your low Price/book adjusted) value screen
has not performed that well lately should be overrated. It was mentioned that
the bulk of the investment returns for below cash stocks came from the few good
performers, rather than the average stock, so a bad streak with a few stocks
foes not mean all that much.

From a fundamental perspective i believe all the stocks with the exception of
OSTE are poor business, which are worth less then zero, IMO. While in 2002 for
example many business looked poor as well financially as well, we are now 3
years into an economic expansion and business that are still in a bad shape
,are less likely to recover. Indeed I think quite a few of your stocks will end
up being essentially worthless, since they are likely to continue burning money
until the cash is gone. Thus, i believe that your selection of stocks is very
risky and with the small cap mania gone for a while, we are seeing this risk
more discounted.
