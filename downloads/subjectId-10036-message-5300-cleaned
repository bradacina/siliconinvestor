Unless I am missing your intent here, the company's action is not something to

twister, different point of view ... I think the public overpaid and
overreacted to the bad news. From a long-term perspective, it's impossible to
know if this is a blip in Landry's history or not. I don't think management
should be blamed for issuing stock at inflated levels (cheap equity) or for
encountering some business turbulence. Those buyers are just a portion of the
overall ownership which management owes fidelity to and the issue is unresolved
as to whether they are making the right business decisions.

Buyback

Regarding LDRY's buyback, I think that to best serve their
existing shareholders, most companies should offer stock
when it is overpriced and buy back when it is underpriced.
(Unless they really don't need the money in the case of
selling and do need the money in the case of buying back.) So
I am almost always happy to see these buybacks. Of course, I
can't praise management in light of poor performance leading
to huge stock declines, but you have to put some of the blame
on shareholders for over-optimistic expectations, even if
management encourages some of these expectations. For instance,
I would not blame the executives at Yahoo (or any of these internet
stocks) if their shares went to 1/4 of their value, considering
that it is the shareholders themselves that have priced in such
high expectations.

Buying on stocks on sale

In the spirit of STAR and LDRY, we have Rainforest
cafe RAIN, a growth stock turned value with solid
cash flows and earnings, no debt, PB < 1, and lots
of cash. (IPO at 12 and Secondary offering at 21,
now at 7 and company has been buying back)

It appears that investors are now unhappy with
"theme" restaurants (Dave and Busters, Planet Hollywood,
etc.) In light of low expectations, I think RAIN offers
a good risk/reward trade-off.

In a different arena, Thornburg Management (TMA) looks
attractive. It is a beat-up mortgage REIT. I know mortgage
REITS are not exactly high-quality investments (generally are
highly leveraged and cash flow negative, yuk), but TMA appears
to be the most forthcoming and conservative of the
bunch. It is way below book value (and book value consists
of actual investments, not property) and lowered interest
rates should greatly help company.

The most major risk is a lack of liquidity such that it would
have to sell off its investments at bargain basement prices.
However, it is buying back stock and paying high dividends,
so apparently it thinks it can weather the current crisis in debt
markets (caused by Asian crisis and LTCM) and return to solid
earnings growth. Also, the CEO bought $600K worth in Oct.,
so he is putting his money where his mouth is.

So I would suggest TMA as a somewhat speculative buy. I am
extremely high on TMA, with my reservations due to high debt
and my lack of understanding of the nuances of the mortgage
industry (although my understanding has been approving as
I have been tracking the industry for the past few months).

Any thoughts on these or related stocks would be welcome.

On the subject of beaten up mortgage lenders, I stumbled across what looks like
a real bargain while screening for "January Effect" plays. LFCO is a West Coast
S & L, which makes mortgage loans to sub standard credit risks. Down from about
$26, now trading about $6 ( I bought at 4 3/16). Was slammed with the other
mortgage lenders, plus had a merger deal fall apart. My cursory review of the
Company indicates that they have a stable source of retail branch deposits for
their lending and are not dependent on the liquidity of the junk bond market as
a source of funds like many of the mortgage REITs. Also there has been insider
buying at higher prices. P/B(mrq) is about .67, P/E(ttm) 2.85. I don't
specialize in banks, so I may be missing something, but it looks like a real
bargain, unless the economy tanks and unemployment skyrockets.

Tom Veale: your OMQP is moving up a little I notice. PE is very low - 6 - and
revs. seem to be doubling every year. But there's only a three year history
with this company. Here's a $13 company doing 33% ROE on a $6 dollar book. To
me, I think it's one of those kinds of companies that are best left to local
investors, such as yourself, who can follow it well and get a very good flavor
of its current activities and future prospects. Especially as you would know
people who work there, drive by the place frequently, etc. Peter Lynch would
give you an attaboy for your pick.

Additional comment:
A lot of us on this thread... well, okay, me for sure, and MAYBE somebody
else-- "we" don't think so much of PEG--- relating growth rates to current PE.
For example, (per Yahoo) earnings are up because of a government contract. OMQP
sells material handling equipment and "skid steer loaders" (I don't even want
to think what that stuff does -g-"). So, to me, I would have trouble seeing how
that growth rate could be sustained (given size of market, rebidding for
contracts, competition). And so I could not rely on peg numbers to be
sustainable. Paul Senior

MCsweet: re: RAIN. Yes, given some of the finance numbers I scan for, RAIN
could work. I've passed on RAIN (I'll think some more now about it now though).
I had thought earlier about RAIN vs. DANB. As Brendan mentioned, these
restaurants are very expensive and so, that is a drawback because it takes a
lot of volume of sales to pay for them. Risky because there are plenty of
examples where costly buildings/sites have lead to restaurant bankruptcy. On
the other hand, the expense could be a competitive advantage -- to spend that
kind of money successfully, the company had better be structured to have access
to capital as well as skill in selection and construction.

I passed on RAIN because 1) I couldn't figure why people would keep coming back
to them; 2)it seemed they were making more money on their T-shirts than on
their food. And as Brendan mentions also, food quality was iffy. (That was my
impression, not supported by any facts that I have.) DANB, on the other hand,
also has costly restaurants, but seems to get repeat business for entertainment
(again that's just my guess). RAIN could be a value stock: DANB surely isn't. I
decided to go with DANB. Paul Senior

Hi Paul, Thank you for your reply. The company only came public a short time
ago - maybe 2 years now. It's managed to grow internally and externally through
acquisition. My expectations are that they will continue a more modest growth
through expansion of their overall business. Their equipment replaces manual
labor - which in turn saves their customers money. Light commercial and
residential construction is one of the last really labor intensive areas and
OMQP's equipment is right there trying to help.

They have yet to approach the overseas market with their equipment. (other than
Desert Storm) This area offers nice potential, but will take time to achieve.

Earnings growth should come through consolidation of their manufacturing,
purchasing, G & A, etc. with their new divisions (Lull and Snorkel). OMQP's
biggest improvements locally have been a massive increase in production without
expansion of their existing facility. If they can accomplish that same sort of
efficiency gain at the new divisions, it will go straight to the bottom line.

All in all, I am expecting a solid 5 years of good growth in sales and earnings
for this company. Book value is growing as well. Get an annual report. You'll
see pictures of all sorts of equipment of which you are familiar. This is Rust
Belt stuff, not Silicon Valley or Info Highway. Steel, hydraulics, diesels all
combined into nicely engineered packages.

I assume that Value Investing is for the long term, and not ST trading. The
reason I brought OMQP to your attention is for long term thinking. It may cycle
with interest rates (and the construction industry) so one should be prepared
for that.

Thanks for the reply.

You make a good point --- Landry's management probably screwed

for that. However, once the price is down, I think buying
back stock is one of the best investments a company can
make. It is a great way to increase EPS, and does not
entail the risk of starting new stores, especially in
light of an expansion that hasn't be too successful and

FWIW, I understand that RAIN is to open a restaurant here in Nashville when a
mega-mall called "Opry Mills" opens. The mall is being built by Gaylord
Entertainment and the owners of the Mall of America. Depending on the growth of
the megamall concept, themed restaurants such as RAIN could have continued
opportunity to grow. IMO, food quality needs to become a central focus at these
types of restaurants, however. A Planet Hollywood which opened here and was HOT
for about a year is now having trouble exactly because food quality is simply
not there.

I opened a position in MLS recently, piqued by a business trip to Nashville.
Cab driver was saying business was down because Gaylord, GET, the big employer

thought, to give up such a good business, they (Gaylord) must really believe in
the Mills business model and operation.
I like the concept too. (No surprise I guess, since I also like the big, theme,
entertainment, repeat business concept of DANB).

I am looking for some balance in one of my portfolios. MLS - a REIT with close

Paul,

Suprisingly, alot of the people here in Nashville aren't buying the Opry Mills
concept. Currently tourism revenue is down considerably following the park's
closing, and we just don't understand how a Mall can be a tourist destination.
Lots of smaller shops that were built around the crowds being brought in by
Opryland are now beginning to close or are in trouble.

From a business perspective, I understand that the hotel bookings for Gaylord
(they have a huge motel here) are down considerably since the theme park has
closed. I've heard (hearsay) that occupancy rates are down from 90% to around
80% now. Alot of big conventions have cancelled, because Nashville, country
music, (Gaylord owns the cable channel CMT and owns a popular downtown tourist
attraction "The Wildhorse" Saloon), Opryland theme park, and the Opryland Hotel
used to be viewed as a good place to have a convention coupled with a family
vacation. Apparently the draw is no longer as good, and bookings reflect this.
Whether the mega-mall can recreate the draw is questionable IMO, but they're
alot smarter than me. I really doubt they expected the falloff in hotel booking
though.

paul, i have little doubt that the stock will bounce around in the next few
years. What you are doing is practicing a form of investing that Buffet has
really DISCREDITED with his own record and observations. This kind of investing
is probably a tad more tasteful for him than momentum investing. No offense.
But this stock points it out perfectly. You will need to watch it like a hawk.
You will need to know when to sell it. You will have taxes to pay if you are
succesful at one and two.

That's something that VALUE investors have missed. It is that Buffet has really
REPUDIATED Graham's methods—as much as he learned from him in the beginning. If
the world's most accomplished investor is saying that there is a better way,
why not listen?

Buy a good business for what it's worth and don't sell it.

And finally, ask yourself why, if all those other things are UP in five years,
this stock is BELOW where it was five years ago. Getting to that answer would
be a great exercise.

%BOM---------------------

From:Paul Senior

Hi Twister. Buffett may have repudiated Graham's methods. But I haven't. -g-.

Maybe Buffett is just too big a player to be a value investor in a small pond.

I am looking for methods and strategies that work. Graham's methods work.
Buffett's do not.

Here's how I think about it. If you follow Graham's methods and buy low pe, low
book value stocks you will do okay. Take an approach in which the stock/bond
allocation fluctuates such that you buy more stocks when they appear low and
buy more bonds than stocks when stock prices are high. That's pretty much
kinda/sorta what Graham says. And a lot of people have done this and have made
money. That's what Graham says to do to help the average Joe/Jane get a
'decent' return.

But if someone tries to follow Buffett, they get great wisdom and great quotes,
and great one-liners. But they do not get a methodology that they themselves
can use to emulate Buffett. That is, the people who I read who are avid Buffett
followers, made their money by following Buffett into his stocks or bought
Berkshire and held, held, held. They do not and did not make their money by
saying,
"Oh here's a stock I've come across and it's a perfect Buffett type, so I'll
buy it." For example, it seems to me on the Buffett thread there's a bunch of
sharp people all looking for Buffett stocks. There's really no consensus and
VERY few ideas, let alone recommendations - maybe one company RAL - a
possibility. Now granted with Buffett, all you'd need is that one, maybe second
company, and hold,hold, hold. But buy price plays a part too. So since 1995, my
guess would be that if someone were really a Buffett stock seeker, and only a
Buffett stock seeker, (and did not own BKH or KO or just followed Buffett in),
then that person would not have bought much since 1995 and would've missed one
heck of a chance to make money in the Bull Market (unless that person, like
Buffett, had bought before the runnup). I am saying there is only one
Buffett/Munger. Trying to emulate them because they sound so smart and are so
wealthy from their work... I think that is an exercise in frustration. Their
methods don't work for anybody else but them. If they did, then we'd hear more
stories of how people id'd stocks using Buffett methods and how successful
they've been.

Again, I'm looking for methods that work for the average Jane/Joe (me). I can
find lots of examples of people who say they've done well finding and buying
value stocks. I recall no examples of anyone ever telling me they are
successful in particularly focusing on Buffett's methods as a stock selection
criteria. (I exclude here some wealthy XRX and WMT people who've said, "yeah, I
work at the company and it's a good company and I've bought and held the stock
for 30 years. And, so with WMT, we see much later, in '97 or '98 that Buffett
buys WMT.)

Anyway, just my opinion. If I could easily find a Buffett stock, I'd buy it too
-g-. Meanwhile, I'll take value.

(Yeah, I know my arguments are a little disjointed here -g-) Paul

Maybe I'm too young to know better - just turned 28 - but I'm still optimistic

I think it is a lot harder than it seems through the rear view mirror to pick a
stock with unlimited upside potential, especially in technology. Just look at
CIEN which guru George Gilder mentioned in Forbes, and went from $92 to 8. Take
MSFT which clearly has unlimited upside potential, but to what extent already
reflected in the price?

I think the tenet of value investing is to buy a stock with much larger upside
potential than downside risk, as measured by things you can quantify. Here,
downside risk is often controlled by the company selling at close to what might
be called traditional investment value, but not always. For example, I would
have called JBL a value stock 2 months ago at $23.

I believe that it is a lot easier to recognize a value stock and achieve very
good investment results over a long period than to pick
a Buffett winner and achieve his results. Our goal should not be to be
superhuman but to achieve better results than an index fund, which beats 3/4 or

Hi Jeffrey, Since you mention JBL, hope you don't mind my showing my history of
managing this stock since I first purchased it in January. Not only was it good
value at the time, and selling at about 1/2 its former high, it has provided
some trading around my core position to let me collect some "rent" from it
while I watch the show. (Paul, I'm sure this isn't Mr. Buffett's style, but it
works for me and can be duplicated by anyone using the same method). The upside
is that the cash reserve is one's "hedge", the downside is that the cash is the
portfolio's "anchor" when prices are rising.

http://www.execpc.com/~oldcat/bargrph.htm

I plan on maintaining a position in this stock for quite a while. To limit the
risk of my long term position, I do inventory control of the investment. Take a
bit of money off the table when it's up and pump more back in when the price is
down. Note that I neared 100% invested when the price bottomed recently.

After fundamental analysis and value evaluation I manage all my investments the

The company has lousy returns on investment, but it is in a business that seems

With some stocks, I'm one who believes in regression to the mean. As you point

YORK is essentially an energy producer/owner of energy production. Both
domestic and international exposure. Some alternative energy exposure. They
were recently suffering heavy losses in the energy brokering business, but are
getting out of that business as quickly as possible. Alot of their potential
is, I think, hidden in current projects w/ high startup costs for new plants
and I don't think stock price adequately reflects the earning power of the
assets. Management has stated that once current projects come on line in a year
or two they expect EPS of $1 per share or more. This would give YORK an price
of $10-$15/share minimum I'd think (current price is 3 3/4). The main problem
is management seems to have lost credibility because they keep starting new
projects while pushing back the date when shareholders can expect the profit.
This isn't a problem to me, as long management stops expanding at some point
and begins making money.

Here's a good summary post by the most informed guy on YORK I know. His name's
Gunther and he owns alot of it. He is trying to get a shareholder
representative on the board.

I seem to remember FLM having a sizable off-balance sheet legal liability which
would go to explain the low P/B ratio. Or do I have this one confused with
another dog of the food distribution sector?

Anybody who was interested in USEC (USU - $14) which was discussed in depth (to
death?) here in July and didn't pull the trigger, its back below the offering
price with the market at stratospheric levels. 8% dividend yield. I stand by my
$22-30 valuation after significant additional research, including a lengthy
one-on-one visit with the top three executives at their headquarters last week.
If you've got two years, this one is going to work. And the dividend rewards
the patient.

James,

In a recent Popular Science magazine I saw where developers at NASA may be near
a workable nuclear powered rocket providing upwards of 6X the thrust of
conventional rockets.

Did the management of USU speak to any evolving markets such as this? Do they
have expectations for new market opportunities to open up? Or are they only
focused on power plants as the end users for the enriched uranium?

Thanks,

James, re. FLM: I don't think the legal liability is a factor --- yet.
From one of their '97 quarterlies:

"Furthermore, the company has been subjected to considerable unfavorable media
coverage
stemming from the jury verdict announced in the David's litigation in early
1996. Although the
David's verdict was subsequently set aside and the matter ultimately settled,
other customers have
made similar allegations in an attempt to alter their contractual arrangements
with the company. See
Note 5 to the company's financial statements. The company believes that
perceptions generated by
such legal proceedings have also negatively impacted sales."

But FLM is a dog. Still, they provide distribution to several thousand
groceries, plus they've got some technical expertise in supply chain
management. Maybe WMT is going to be the biggest and the baddest. And maybe
Albertsons, Safeway are humongous and growing . But there's going to be a need
for independents and a company like FLM to distribute to them.

I think maybe for me, it's a twister vs. Senior 'regression to the mean' kind
of argument again. There hasn't been a year in the past decade when you
couldn't have sold this stock for $20 (note: yes, I know that's not the mean).
Maybe the distribution biz has changed, but I think, sometime in the next
couple of years, FLM will hit $20 once again. So at 9-11, all in all, okay to
buy as a value stock IMO. Perhaps a lousy way to look at it, but there you are.

Weather is a favorite excuse of poor managements. I can understand an electric

I would agree, I gave you my weather diatribe on the wrong stock. Though if you

("did somebody say...") Not that you can't make money on them. I have always
thought, if I ever start a hedge fund, where I can short, my first shorts would
be the three "hottest" restaurant "concepts". They always collapse. But as you

SBARRO's RIP OFF OFFER!!!

If you are a shareholder of SBARRO, please write the company and vent your
anger about this offer. Let them know they will lose your dining business in
the future if they steal the company from us with this inadequate offer.

www.sbarro.com

How can the company make an offer to us for less than the value of the prior
offer in January when that one was rejected as too low? Sbarro's is a wonderful
company. It earns a very high rate of return on tangible assets excluding the
very excessive amount of cash it carries on the balance sheet. A minimum of $4
of that cash could easily be distributed to shareholders or used to buy back
shares. The value of the company minus the cash is still well in excess of
$27.50 per share. This is a company that has earnings power of just under $2 a
share. If $4 was distributed, that means we are being offered about 12 times
earnings for a very above average franchise that generates significant amounts
of free cash flow annually. This is way out of line with its intrinsic value
and compared to other restaurant deals for very inferior companies. To put it
mildly, they are trying to steal the company from the rest of us.

Vent your dissatisfaction with the offer.

Crimi, you are shameless, hypocritical and despicable.<<

I regret that your choice of words is very unprofessional and discourteous
considering I offer a great deal of my time and work for free at my web page. I
am trying to help people you know. However, I will address your point so that I
can clarify my view for others.

My view as expressed on my web page is that "AGGREGATE MARKET LEVELS" are
extremely high and that the U.S. is in a financial asset bubble related to
excess credit and speculation. My monthly view is limited to that very general
opinion about the market and what is going on in the economy. I have NO opinion
at all about where the market will be heading next!

This is a view that is shared by many value investors who still have long
positions for one reason or the other. It does not mean that there aren't
individual stocks that represent bargain value. Just very few (in my view)
among the DOW and S&P500 components that I am talking about in my monthly
market views.

On several occasions I said that I was doing some buying during a downturn. I
also said that small caps offered excellent value during the recent decline. I
do not give specific recommendations for either long or short positions at my
page. I consider that a value added service and a position of responsibility
that I don't wish to have. However, as part of certain discussions I have
mentioned SBARROs as a position I hold and why I like it. I have also mentioned
others. Just do a search on Silicon Investor.

My occasional purchases do not mean that I have stopped thinking the U.S. is a
bubble. I do. In fact, so does at least one former Fed governor as expressed in
Barrons this week. That same article also hints that Alan Greenspan thinks the
U.S. is in a financial asset bubble too. So do many other experienced
investors, economists, publications etc..

Within that view, I can still find very occasional values, as in the case of
Sbarros. But generally, I believe exactly what I say. These are dangerous
times. I suspect that the majority of investors do not quite grasp the extent
of the possible overvaluation. These are the highest AGGREGATE MULTIPLES OF ONE
OF THE HIGHEST RETURNS ON EQUITY EVER. That means we not only face a potential
decline of PE ratios, but also a decline in profitability at some point. From a
30 PE to the mean of 15 is a 50% drop. Add to that a 20% drop in profitability
and you get the picture. The present aggregate market is a bet on a combination
that has never been sustained in history. Not a good bet in my view if you are
a "value guy".

Would you prefer that I was like most Wall St. types and told you that this is
a "New Era" and you should rush head first into the excess and hope it really
is different this time?

It is that exact attitude that provoked my Web Page to begin with. I am trying
to provide a perspective that is not influenced by vested interest, bonuses,
career pressure, and GREED etc...

I am sorry that you find honestly as opposed to salesmanhip so offensive. I am
only trying to help people!

My personal portfolio is very defensive. I have stated that repeatedly. In fact
it's the most defensive it has ever been in my life. However, I have no idea
when or if THE END is coming. No one does!! The prices are very high and so are
the risks IN GENERAL!!! That's it! On the rare occasions that I find a bargain
within my circle of comfort, I buy it and so should you. You just won't get any
specific recommendations from me at this time.

Lastly, as to Sbarros, the family is trying to steal the company from the other
shareholders. All small investors should be concerned about that possibility.
Not just shareholders in Sbarro like myself. I still stand to make a profit
from my purchase. Others may not be so fortunate.

A number of us have created a very high quality forum here. We put our name on

degenerating into people posting ads, hype or self serving posts, because they

I am not looking to flame you, and I have nothing against the work you are

police things a little bit, because clearly we have some "sweat equity" in the

you contribute your thoughts to this thread, but posting a hyperlink to

danger is that if we let one guy do it, we're going to open the floodgates. I

just not how we do things here.<<

I understand your point of view. Mine is this. I have a limited amount of time
to express my thoughts to the various SI threads, Motley Fool threads and
newsgroups I read. I also answer e-mails that come from my occasional posts.
Rather that write the same thing or variations thereof everywhere I
occasionally browse, I post my thoughts in a monthly market view at my personal
web page. Then, anyone who wants to know what I think, read any articles I
found interesting (links), link to other web pages on investing that I found
etc... can do it from one spot easily. This saves me precious time. Other than
that I would spend 5 hours a night doing this stuff and that makes no sense. On
occasion I will read something that I agree/disagree with strongly and I will
respond to it. If someone addresses me, I respond to it. I've never viewed any
of these SI threads as a sort of club so long as you don't post any off topic,
or offensive things, or direct ads for pay services. I didn't consider a
monthly update notification of my thoughts, or a link to something I wrote on
another thread as out of line. Why write the same thing 10 times if I can
provide a link to it and write it once? If you find my monthly update
notifications and links to other threads than contain exactly what I want to
say here out of line I will stop posting them. It isn't an ad though. I don't
charge. As far as individual investments goes, I prefer not to do that. If I
tell you I like xxx company I will then feel an obligation to tell you when I
sell it. Since I am all over the place writing this stuff, you can see how this
could an be a problem.

Besides, my present portfolio contains a grand total of 6 stocks. Sbarros,
Applebees, Mercury General, Berkshire Hathaway (bought in 1988), Leucadia
National (token position that I wish to expand greatly some day. I have had
conversations with the company head), and Ensco. All except BRKA were purchased
in the recent decline or a prior one. I have cleaned out all my other long
positions over the last year or two (Kimberly Clark the latest) and I have no
other ideas that meet MY criteria for a bargain! I have written about all these
positions in public at one time or another.

From:Freedom Fighter

Here is a small Summation of my Method and the way I think. I hope it addresses
some of the criticisms that have been made of me in this thread.

My method for determining the intrinsic value of a business is not limited by
either one model or view of how the economy works. To me, intrinsic value is a
range of possibilities. In general, I am trying to purchase as much future
earnings power as possible for as little as possible. However, a thorough look
at market history suggests that not only does corporate governance change, so
does Wall St. and the public. Here is one example:

The historical record indicates that there is a close relationship between
interest rates and stock prices from the 60s forward. There is an even CLOSER
relationship between inflation and stock prices since then. However, there is
very little relationship between any of these factors prior to the 60s.

If you look at academic studies on risk premiums, there is substantial evidence
that risk premiums vary from decade to decade and under different economic
conditions.

How does one come to terms with a game where the rules of valuation are
constantly changing?

Logically, lower interest rates should mean higher stock prices and visa versa.
In modern times, investors compare the amount of earnings their company will
generate vs. the income an investment in an alternative security like bonds
would generate. They then plug those inputs into Dividend Discount, Free Cash
Flow, CAPM, and various other present value and earnings yields models of their
own design. Some use a risk premium specific to the industry, others use a
margin of safety etc… Some use relative valuation.

But contrary to popular belief, I believe it's possible that interest
rate/inflation models fail to consider that as nominal interest rates fall or
rise, so could future returns on capital and equity for business over the LONG
HAUL. In essence, what I am saying is that it is possible that all the factors
and returns in an economy MAY get priced in over time (10 years or so). If so,
then "intrinsic value" is based on some REAL return on capital (the difference
between the cost and return on capital) that can be expected from a business
over the LONG HAUL. If so, stock prices would tend to move to a mean PE RANGE
over time at any interest rate or any level of inflation. There have been
numerous reversions to the mean at many different levels of interest rates in
the past.

If this is so, an investor should try to determine the level of (REAL)
profitability their company will be able to sustain. To do so, it is necessary
to examine factors such as size, management, number of competitors, business
advantages/disadvantages, industry, reputation/ goodwill, etc… One could then
determine the appropriate PE by discounting adjusted inputs using any of the
standard models mentioned above or a model of your own choosing.

Given these two very different views on valuation and economics, an investor
could come to very different conclusions about whether a given stock is cheap
or expensive at present. Wall St. and most investors are assuming that higher
than average PEs are justified by low inflation and interest rates.
Furthermore, they are assuming that the historically high return on capital we
have at present also justifies higher than average PEs. In combination you get
a "New Era". I am saying MAYBE, MAYBE NOT!

My recent purchase of Kimberly Clark explains my thought process in action. In
short, KMB has earnings power of about $2.50 per share at present. (give or
take) It is an above average return on capital business with several excellent
brand names so it generates above average Free Cash Flow levels. I think that
above average returns are sustainable for a consumer giant that has its brands.
I would also say it has at least average growth prospects going forward.
Companies like this generally sell at a premium to the market over the long
haul. Temporary difficulties knocked the stock price down to the mid 30s. It
was trading at about 14-15 times normalized earnings power when I bought it.

No matter whether you discount a range of FCF levels at 9% or 10%, expect a
reversion to the mean, use a range of assumptions about its future growth, use
earnings yields vs. bonds, or any other common method, KMB looked good from a
valuation perspective. There was a significant margin of safety no matter what
as far as I was concerned.

However, the vast majority of companies at present are discounting low interest
rates, low inflation, and high returns on capital as if they are sustainable in
combination. For many of them, I do not believe it is possible. In aggregate I
really doubt it. If they are, the rewards over cash and bonds are minimal. If
they are not, future returns from those securities are likely to be close to
zero or negative over the next decade. If there is a reversion to the mean in
all ways watch out! Not a very good bet in my mind. And given my ideas about
what value is (a range of possibilities), they are overpriced.

I use all the following models.

A modified version of CAPM

Earnings Yield vs. Bond Yield

A Plowback Return on Equity Model of my own Design

Dividend + Share Repurchase Discount Model

Reversion to the Mean Model

All the models presented in "Buffettology"

A Catchup Model - How many years for the sum of the earnings of the company to
catchup to a bond with reinvested interest.

Real Return on Capital Models

Miscellaneous other stuff.

It saves me the enormous amount of time of having to search for them myself. I
thought my efforts were generous, not an annoyance. That's the way I think

Mike, yup still here, Re WHX, I'm just holding the A convertible, it pays a
great dividend based on current rates, and frankly everything I've heard about
the company since the strike ended(except for the steel business)has been very
positive. It seems that R.Labow has been pursuing his own interest(which are
aligned with mine) and adding value to WHX, the dividend looks pretty secure.
If the share gets back up to $14 or so I'll start shorting against the convert
again. Scott

I was curious about your aversion to restaurant stocks. I remember Peter Lynch
talking them up in Beating the Street, if I remember rightly. Buy something
successful that can be cookie cuttered and watch it grow. Wendy's, KFC, Pizza
Hut, etc. I think he invested his own money in Lonestar Steakhouse after he
stopped managing Magellan.

I guess on the negative side, ROE on restaurant stocks seem to be pretty low,
if my cursory look at several stocks is representative of the group. And then
there's the fickle nature of public tastes and fads to deal with.
Anyway, you know a lot more than I do. If you could write a few words about the
industry and if there are any exceptions to your dislike. Maybe you like
McDonalds since WEB owns it? Thanks in advance.

Restaurant stocks generally have a low ROE, because even the most creative
concept can be copied easily. Lynch's technique of buying a restaurant concept
which is just rolling out across the country could have gotten you in a world
of trouble in the last couple years. Because as Boston Chicken, Planet
Hollywood and the steakhouse chains have found out, others copy your concept,
and may even build it right next door to your property. I do like McDonalds
because it has stood the test of time and the test of competition. Another one
that looks like a franchise, Starbucks, I am wary of for reasons I think we
discussed on this thread before.

Anybody else watching Browning Ferris (BFI). Price ($29 5/8) is around a 2 year
low. It seems pretty blue chip to me, even though management has been dinged
for repeated reorganizations and "one-time" charges. By my math it's around 3x
book with earnings power of $2.00 a share but if you add back goodwill
amortization of $100m divided by 175 million shares (57c) you get a PE under
12.

Tomato,

One thing that I've grown to realize about restaurant stocks is that many are
captive to their own share price for growth. They don't generate enough cash to
expand rapidly as many like to do, so they are dependent on dilutive stock
offerings or alot of debt to come up with the cash with which to grow.

If the stock isn't highly priced, well, it's difficult to raise capital through
the equity markets. This forces companies to debt for expansion, and it's
difficult to justify taking on debt if your ROE is 9% or so. So really, the
best means of expansion seems to be in achieving an inflated stock price and
issuing more shares of stock at an inflated price.

For this reason I've backed away from an earlier restaurant stock that I liked
at this time last year (RDHS), and avoided (thankfully) another that I was
somewhat interested in (STAR).

I enjoy yours also. For what it's worth. I will continue to post at GADR in SI

different attitude about what is appropriate to post on one of these threads

value to investors that I find on Value Investing. Links to articles, web

and search them out. They don't seem to like external links (even if it might
be to a great article) or anything that is self serving like an update notice

things that I might have in one format into something presentable everywhere I
like to visit. I don't want to be a pain though and I respect their preferences
even though I think I have something to contribute.

Did you read the interview in Barrons this week with the former Fed Gov. that
called the U.S. an asset bubble? I thought that was a strong statement coming
from a person like that.

Just to let you know, this month I'm going to present a table of historic
projected returns from stocks from 1950-1998 using a payout ratio, dividend

Mike ,you and several others have expressed interest in the beaten up

Olympic Steel(ZEUS) at 216-292-3200.
Stock lost 5/8 today to close at 5 3/8 which is very near the 5 year low. I am
buying and here is my rationale:
1) Not producer but value added distributor. From CEO Michael Siegal "Our
motivating factor is not what we think we need to do (for ourselves);it is
based on what our customers need us to do for them ..we will continue to invest
in the things that make our customers more efficient in the market place"May
1995 An example is a welded variable thickness steel sheet which accomodates a
more efficient stamping operation for auto makers.
2)Excellent management. Siegal man of year in Metal Stamping News Dec 1997.
3)Real book(not goodwill hype) of 13.67 or p/b of .39
4)Last 2 insider transaction were small cash buys.
5)Earlier this year co-founder left company and did planned sale of 200,000
plus of his 1 million shares. He no longer files as insider.A speculation on my
part is that he may be continuing his sales. There are only 10.7 million shares
outstanding.
6)IPO was at 15.5 and secondary at 25. Company wisely using money to acquire
compatible businesses.
The investor package is excellent and for those who wish to put some time into
analysis I would suggest they request same.

There's not much to recommend at this point. I had a number of brief e-mail
conversations with Joe Steinberg (president). He reads my monthly market view.
That's how I became interested in the company. He has as good an investment
record as any I have ever seen. The company is bearish/cautious on the market
from a valuation point of view. They've been selling off all their assets for
cash. They now have an enormous pile of cash and no ideas. The thing I like
about it is that if they continue to sit on that cash, at some point during a
bear market (someday I hope) you may be able to get that cash at a discount and
a genius at the helm. I like having brilliant guys as partners, especially when
I can get them at a discount. In the mean time I have a token position so it

I know I mentioned this one before, but they just had
a solid earnings report (0.17 vs 0.13 a year ago).

Positives:

selling way below book value, low PS, insider buying, good
price momentum, easy earning comparison for next quarter (???
vs. -0.25 a year ago => EPS estimate of 0.20 for this year
seems conservative).

Negatives (?):

stock price near penny stock range ($3), very little analyst

Hi Allen,

I sent away for the investor's package for ZEUS but in the meantime...

Do you know of other value-added distributors to which I can compare this
company? When I compare ZEUS to the steel stocks I see that a 0.37 p/b is not
out of line with the industry (National Steel sports one at 0.17!). That isn't
a fair comparison since ZEUS is mainly a distributor (which would explain the
low margins).

Still it sounds interesting if they plan to grow through acquisitions but the
low float and the lack of dividend make it risky for me. Glad you found the
package so helpful - that hints to me that management might have shareholder
value in mind.

Thanks for any help,

The other one is a little company from Seattle you might have heard of. They
make airplanes. The stock is off by nearly 50% from its 1997 peak as everything

The annual meeting proxy(SEC 14) is generally best place to get company's

Steel,Huntco,Shihloh,Steel Technologies and Worthington. Agree that Steel
companies are priced very low to book. The reason I like Olympic is that they
have a very wide supplier base, including foreign suppliers. As a contrarian I
feel that if supply exceeds demand for a commodity product and a company can
acquire that commodity at good prices and then add value, they are much better
off than the commodity producer. That is why I think the investors package is
useful to give you the perspective of management relative to their strategy of

Boeing's got problems. No question about that. Delving into the intricacies of
each and every management problem Boeing has means never buying the stock. But
problems get solved somehow. I look at this as a stock I will never sell, and I
think it may go lower which is why I bought small at a time when it is testing
the previous low.

As Peter Lynch would say, you can draw this one with a crayon. Commercial
flight is a long term growth story, and there is 5 years of pent up replacement
demand laid on top of that. There are two companies that can serve that demand,
and it would take a decade and major state sponsorship for a new competitor to
enter the business (China? Russia? If Japan was going to enter the business
they would have already.) These two companies idiotically gave away this cycle,
but they won't make that mistake again.

I believe current management will be fired or the company will be taken over at
a price in the 50s. The only possible buyer in my view is General Electric.

Manana stocks. Yeah, I would put Case in the same category, though I think its
a better business with comparable upside to Cyprus. (If you hold these for 3-5
years, you are looking for doubles at least.

The reason I bought Amax copper is the contrarian value story plus two other
points:
1) 7% dividend yield, which may or may not be etched in stone, but at least is
there now. And they could pay it if the choose to - this is not a cash
constrained company.
2) I have done some quantitative work that shows that basic industry cyclicals,
(copper, steel) substantially outperform the market between December and March.
The crappier the business, the better the seasonal bounce. This is a phenomenon
that goes back years. I don't know why, but they do. (Part of it might be
January effect, but its more than that.) So I am looking for a quick 11-14
here. Maybe its a double in 3 years, but that's not why I bought it.

I like PSA even more now than when I first mentioned it. They are building
scale in a business with nothing but little guys, and are finding creative ways
to take advantage of their size. The numbers in their core business have been
outstanding, but the stock has done nothing for a year and a half.

Other REITs I particularly like would be Colonial (CLP) and Chelsea (CCG).
Colonial is a conservatively managed Alabama property company which has
expanded into other Southeastern markets. It is diversified among retail,
apartment and office property. Chelsea is a factory outlet mall owner, and
simply the best in its business. Its properties are outstanding and blow away
the competition. I consider both stocks pretty cheap based on the value of the
assets they own, and the skill and integrity of their managements. Both yield
around 8% (that's what you don't get with PSA).

Hope that is helpful - I really do believe that value investors should be
buying REITs now because nobody else wants them, and we're talking about real
property and real dividends, not some hyped up story about future potential.

And of those REIT stocks discussed earlier on this thread, I bought and still
own

LHO, FCH, ARI, and MLS. (All purchased at prices below current)

These stocks all have good dividends (IMO) and insider purchases.

LHO, a Jim Clarke special, was discussed in some detail here.

I chose MLS over CCG for my pick regarding outlet malls. Didn't see anything
special regarding CCG; also read one neg. comment about CCG. I just like MLS
concept better. Plus numbers look okay to me. (Nice div.)

PSA, I skipped-- I think I recall reading a Forbes article about 5 years back
on how the CEO, the basic developer of the public storage biz., really hurt
investors in HIS company by creating different classes of stock, other
financial manipulations. So I avoid. (Not at all sure of my rumor/facts here--
but enough concern for me to walk away from PSA).

Some caveats:

Every time I go up against Jim C. I think I lose (I chose RN over his MO pick,
for example), so my opinion is that my opinion here also ought to be discounted
for that -g-.

If you are assuming that insider trading regarding REITs is a strong signal,
you want to really test and check that assumption. Some companies, especially
REITs, I have found, offer loans to their officers to buy their stock. In
looking at one REIT, I read an analyst opinion that those loans were non
recourse -- (in other words, buy the stock, we'll loan you the money, if it
doesn't work out for you, you don't have to pay us back). Obviously then, in
these situations you would expect to see a lot of insider buys. Quite a bit
different from in-the-know people plunking down their own money -g-.

did and I missed the easy money. The Barrons article makes a pretty good case
that this one could go up a lot more. Definitely worth a long look.

Another play on your post office thesis is CNF, Consolidated Freight. This is
Emory airfreight and a trucking company. When the Postal Service outsourced
half of their Priority Mail business, CNF got the contract which looks like a
real winner for them. The question now is do they get the other half, which
probably comes up for bid soon. It makes sense to me that the company already
doing half the business has vast advantages in bidding on the other half. And
the stock looks pretty cheap on earnings, and if they make their numbers on the
Priority Mail business earnings are going to increase. Plus when you're buying
a stock on low P/E it is very nice to see that the business is NOT firing on
all cylinders (i.e. the earnings are not at a peak). The Emory business is a
turnaround situation - there's nothing like buying a turnaround on low P/E,
because you have the chance to get both an expanding "E" and a higher multiple.
This one also deserves a look, although the story is not easy to figure out.

Paul, thank you for your praise, but I'll tell you one thing. LaSalle might
have been a "Jim Clarke special" but only if you have Paul Senior's average
cost. You clearly didn't buy it when I was pitching it. I am still a little bit
underwater there, even though it has nearly doubled off its bottom which I
bought way too lightly. But hell, the thing still has a 12% yield, management
is honest and their properties are not the best in the industry but are
performing well.

Your insights are right on the mark. There is nothing wrong with Mills - I just
go with Chelsea - Mills executes the factory outlet concept a little
differently, but these are the two best in that part of the retail real estate
industry.

PSA, you are absolutely right, these guys are financial wheeler dealers. And it
is hard to completely trust management to the extent I do with Colonial
Properties. But I think this one is going to be a big winner long term because
you can buy the company for the value of the properties, but your upside is
that management does not manage the company as a real estate company - they are
trying to become the McDonalds of the self storage business and I think they're
halfway to doing it. None of the competitors is responding at all, which means
that if PSA's vision is right you're going to do very well in this stock for
the next five years.

Although I am not an expert on all the REITs you own, it sounds like you have a
diversied group of them, maybe a little heavy in hotels, but that's where the
value is. You haven't gotten tempted by the crap of the industry, which shows
you've done your homework. I think the strategy on REITs now should be to
diversify among three or four of them in different property types - buy very
good properties provided you are not buying a REIT that is still being hyped by
Wall Street (PSA would be my exception to that, but you should be able to find
very high quality assets in any sector which will give you a 7% dividend yield.

In retail, its Mills or Chelsea. In office its Arden or Kilroy (I like the L.A.
market a lot). In storage, buy PSA - the dividend is not the story there. Hotel
I would do Host Marriott but understand the tax hit you are going to take in a
month - might make sense waiting. Industrial (warehouse) is probably the most
stable of all property types through cycles, and you've got a company there
called EastGroup Properties (EGP) that yields close to 8% dividend and has an
outstanding track record for shareholder value increasing. Apartment I have no
view on. If you want to buy one REIT which diversifies you among property types
(though not geography, which is also important) I don't see how you lose money
on Colonial Properties (CLP) below 27.

I think I made my name on this thread with two real estate picks (I worked for
Morgan Stanley Realty for three years, so that's not a coincidence) - St. Joe
and Tejon Ranch a couple years ago. My REIT picks have not done my reputation
any good so far - it has been a horrible sector this year. REITs are not the
same game as St. Joe or Tejon. Those were investments for doubles, but REITs
today are an out of favor sector that offers you a 7 or 8% dividend to wait for
a 20% gain with limited downside. If that bores you, then look at the next
post. REITs are for investors, not speculators. In this sector, I am looking
for a safe and satisfactory return, but these aren't going to double.

Hope this is helpful.

point is that value investors and insiders are buying (to some extent) these
companies. Still, some faith and a long term outlook are required with these
two (on my part anyway). I'm looking to add to my positions if prices come down
a little more from current. (Note: if anyone actually does remember my earlier
post on CCS, I bought about 14 and sold most in the company's Dutch tender @
19.)

Jim, where you and I do agree is that CYM is a buy. Here, I am in your
situation ala LHO. I've bought higher and averaged down. Where you are looking
for a short term move to 13-14, I am looking for a long term move to 18. To me,
this is a regression-to-the-mean type stock.
There hasn't been a year in the past 10 when this stock has not sold at 18 or
higher. (Stock's now about 11). That day will come again. I think management is
actually doing something to make that happen. Again IMO. Meanwhile, I'll take
the dividend. (And of course, given my penchant for diversification, this
stock, CYM, is only a small part of a diversified portfolio--- just in case you
(-g-) should be wrong and the stock craters from here(-g-)).

Paul.

>>>i was looking at avp (avon) it's @ same price it was back in 94. funny it
takes many years to buy and hold and one could be wiped off in a few weeks.<<<

Paul and I think similarly, but generally we give each other ideas - i.e. we
start with different stocks. The fact that we are both in CYM for the same
reason, independently of each other, gives me additional conviction that I did
not make a mistake on my analysis. Maybe we're both wrong, but if I saw Mike
Burry and Paul Senior buying something independently of each other, I'd
certainly give it a look.

CYM has among the lowest cost copper mines in the world. In addition they have
coal and gold mining assets. I think the only thing more unpopular than copper
and gold mines today is Ken Starr. But Ken doesn't pay a 7% dividend. I have no
idea what the catalyst will be, but copper will not trade below 80 cents and
gold will not trade below $320 forever.

CYM has historically been an awful investment to hold long term. You've got to
pick off the big moves. You've got to get both the buy and the sell right,
because the wind is not at your back on this one. Ben Graham used to tell this
story in his class which Warren Buffett related in an old Berkshire report:

A rancher takes his horse to the vet and says "Look, I don't know what to do
with this animal. Some days he can run like a thorougbred, other days he is
lame as a mule." The vet thought for a moment, and said "When he can walk, sell
him." That is my strategy for Cyprus Amax.

Barrons has got a very intriguing piece on Maxxam (MXM) a wheeler-dealer
holding company with a very interesting valuation. It has a very thin float and
the article hypes the valuation. I would guess this stock jumps big tomorrow.
But if you are looking at it (and I don't know how you wouldn't be if you saw
this article!) answer me one question.

The company has 1.8 billion of debt, or $257 a share. The article never
explicitly backed this figure out of the valuation it outlined. I estimate that
about 1/3 of that debt is buried in the Kaiser valuation (Maxxam owns 60% of
Kaiser Aluminum) but what about the rest?

Re: CNF I've been interested too. Been looking at it a lot recently, though I'm
waiting for the mid-20's again, since I first noticed it back at 25 and I'm too
stubborn to pay the extra money I didn't make now. I started a thread to
discuss it more. Interesting company.
