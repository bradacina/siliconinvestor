Portfolio update:
1) I bought a position in PFE
Rationale for PFE:
+ market leadership
+ low PE of 16
+ Good track record of growth, FCF and earnings growth
+ clean accounting as far as i can see
- negative environment for pharma
- acquisitions

I also bought a position in MOT:
+ relatively low valuation (P/S)
+ winning back market share with cellphones
+ sound balance sheet
+ positive free cash flow and earnings
- poor earnings quality due to special charges
- mangement quality questionable
- poor track record

I did also look at two other value stocks, that have been mentioned here
before:
HD looks cheap based on historic PE/PS but due (possible)issues like this, i
decided to pass up on HD:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=18432872

GE: also looks good with respect to PE and PS. However it seems that earnings a
still bloated by pension income. According to Morningstar, core earnings are
much lower than reported earnings about 1.11$/shares and based on that GE does
not look cheap.

Both GE and HD did not pass my sniff test. Anybody has a contrary opinion on
stocks I mentioned here?

Jurgis Bekepuris, re. CX: still maintaining my position. Jobs are exiting
Mexico for China. That's a problem. I still expect people to be building their
homes though as the Mexican economy develops, which will happen (eventually).
As you may know, CX sells their cement in Mexico one bag at a time (i.e. when
money's available, people resume their home improvement efforts).

Also with CX, one gets an astute management and a geographically diverse
business.

Possibly not the best buy going at this time... but now at lows, I won't be

re HD and GE: How long would you be figuring to be in these stocks?

As for the the concern that profits allegedly come from and are dependent on
"free merchandise" for new HD stores -- that person's argument sounds inane to
me.

I've been adding to my HD position based on its growth rate and its market
dominance.

It seems to me that it's rare that one can find behemoths at five year lows yet
where analysts still expect earnings increases. And the p/e seems reasonable to
me.

OTOH, my ROE model says I shouldn't be paying over $17 per share for the stock
(assuming a 16% ROE going forward).

So far I have been wrong to be buying and adding. We'll see what the next 12

Jim Clarke, re: DOV. Sorry I missed lows of the day. I'll likely purchase a
starting position at current price though, now that the stock has come down on
disappointing earnings.

Regarding their history of free cash flow and how they are managed, I get a
flavor of that from how they describe themselves:

http://www.dovercorporation.com/html/index_about_dover.html

I go expecting to first find a list of their owned companies or how they
categorize their many acquisitions. That's mentioned very briefly, but I'm
struck by how it seems they so strongly (paragraph 4) consider their bottom
line performance: "A high-value, long term investment: ROE consistently close
to 20 percent; cash flow about five percent of sales; and CAAGR near 15 percent
since 1995." Not too many companies bring such measures up when you go to their
"about our company" page (imo anyway)

Regarding HD -
I do not think that the merchandise for new stores is free, however i could

I could not find any indication in HD's last 10k about these types of
concessions whatsoever.

Regarding GE: According to 10k the pension income was 6.8% of operating income
in 2001, I suppose this number was smaller than 2002. While 6.8% is significant
it's much less than the 30-40% of operating income according to Morningstar. I
did however notice that Power systems and Airplane engines made up the bulk of
operating earnings of GE's industrial business, the rest didn't really matter.
Also the Power and the GE engine business have provided the bulk of the growth

Do you have any elaboration on "astute management" in CX? This is something
which is even more difficult to qualify in foreign companies. Any pointers to
management evaluation would be great. I am still interested in CX.

HD and your ROE model - hey did you steal mine? :-))) Or did we both steal it

GE - I just looked at it and put it into "beyond my competency" pile. I don't

ROE with debt is only ~15% that is Buffettology limit, I think I will pass.

About CX: some notes for backup to my assertion of "astute management":

CX:

3rd largest cement company

About 21% of US market. About 55% of Mexican market (reported '01)

Generally focused on emerging markets though.

World's largest cement trader (enables some control over export markets)

Attempts to ue IT to deliver cement JIT. A focus on efficient manufacturing.
-----------------------------

On Industry Week's "Best-Managed Company" list five times: '96-'00
(May be in subsequent years too; I don't have info.)
-------------------

Hires marketing people from P&G and KO. So we get:

(Some snippets from 1/'00 LA Times newspaper article:)

"It pays lavish attention to its distributors - 5000 in Mexico alone - who can
earn points toward rewards for hitting sales targets; some can earn Cemex
stock. High-volume independent distributors can buy trucks and and other
supplies through Cemex at significant discounts."

"Cemex knows that tens of thousands of immigrants to the US go home at holiday
time... with cash... to to build or expand their houses. So Cemex hands out
construction tip booklets at airports in migrant cities where charter flights
pour in each December."

(40-50% of Mexican cement sales are in the "self-construction" market, i.e.
sales are by 50-kilo bags. And for CX, more that 50% of its sales volume
world-wide is this way. (vs. bulk, ready-mix)) (ref: Bloomberg 8//'01)

"(In Mexico)... when the roof is finished at a building site, the workers and
neighbors celebrate with a meal...Cemex provides the food- if the builder
agrees to put up a sign with the Cemex logo announcing the party."
----------------------------
CEO Zambrano was described by Forbes in 1998 as "One of the world's ten
smartest entrepreneurial-billionaires." (edit: whatever that means -g-)

Education: Zambrano is a Stanford MBA grad. "Hi-potential CX execs are sent to
US colleges, others take virtual MBAs or attend co's in-house management
program in Florida."

"His hi-tech obsession permeates the company. "Computers connect every Cemex
manufacturing plant world-wide and knit together order and distribution
systems. That allows orders to be pledged within 20 minutes, even in Mexico
City's chaotic traffic. If there are delays, customers receive discounts."
--------------

Now if only we investors could just have the stock go up (and not hover at lows
where it is now) we'd much more easily be able to nod our heads and say, "Yep.
Our management is astute" (-g-)

The Editor of the Wall Street Journal mentioned (both in print and in a TV

not a given. Although I am no expert in politics, I tend to place a lot of

hence has no motivation to undercut Bush's proposal except for being as

I'd guess dividends might be limited in some way, either outright by a max

I am saying that it's my opinion that commercial property REITs (that I've

If the primary reason people own these REITs is for dividends, these stocks
could decline further and stay down.

In any case, I believe I see better opportunities elsewhere.

Some details on NFI for those interested:

08:52am EST 30-Jan-03 Flagstone Securities (W.Coleman Bitting) NFI

NovaStar`s 4Q02: Another Blowout Quarter - Estimates Up

* It is difficult to overstate the power of NovaStar's EPS report. Fourth
quarter results highlight both the capacity of the non-prime lending and
investing business model to create compelling economic value, and management's
deft execution of this model. The worth of these commodities, consistently
unappreciated by the market, is becoming increasingly difficult (and expensive)
to ignore.

* Earnings of $1.62 per share topped our $1.50 estimate by 8%, were up 42%
from $1.14 per share in 3Q02, and were up 200% from $0.54 per share in 4Q01.
The
company also declared a $0.33 per share special dividend related to 2002
earnings, and increased its 2003 EPS guidance to $7.00 - $8.00 per share.

* Although NovaStar's investment portfolio continues to generate
extraordinary returns, what differentiates 4Q02 from previous quarters is the
dramatic growth in the origination franchise. Production volumes surged 65% in
4Q02 to $1.1B from $650M in 3Q02 as the company grew its wholesale account
executive staff by 51% and increased its net branch count by 17%. Expecting to
double its net branch franchise in 2003, management projects production will
grow by around 100% in 2003, to between $4B and $6B, propelling continued
growth
in the high-ROI mortgage security portfolio.

* Net interest income jumped 65% vs. 3Q02, reflecting the fact that all of
4Q02 production was held on balance sheet for the entire quarter, and
reflecting
a hike in portfolio margin to 13.0% from 10.6%. Net interest margin growth is
likely due to higher mortgage security accrual in the increasingly advantageous
forward LIBOR environment of 4Q02. With $1B of unsecuritized production on
balance sheet, 1H03 gains and high-ROI mortgage security portfolio growth could
be dramatic.

* 4Q02 results are more impressive still considering that NovaStar had $90M
of underinvested cash and liquidity after its 4Q02 mortgage security
resecuritization.

* GAAP book value, which does not attach any value to NovaStar's origination
franchise, increased to $16.62 per share from $15.50 per share in 3Q02. We
believe this growth is largely due to mortgage security mark-to-market gains in
the increasingly advantageous forward LIBOR environment of 4Q02.

* After preliminary review we have increased our 2003 and 2004 estimates to
$7.50 and $8.00 from $6.50 and $6.75. At last night's close, NovaStar traded at
4.1X our 2003 estimate, a 24% forward earnings yield. We continue to believe
NovaStar offers the highest absolute and risk-adjusted returns of any company
in
the mortgage finance sector.

I don't know who "Flagstone Securities" are, or what relationship caused them
to write the evaluation of NFI. However, the language can hardly be said to be
objective, which leads me to wonder what else might not be.

Knowing that you are quite successful as an investor/speculator, I know that
you believe in this opportunity and have, perhaps, a better chance of being
right because of your previous experience with the company's price movement and
your daily attention to the market and your almost instantaneous reaction time
to changing perceptions would get you out of this company before you got hurt
too badly. However, I would argue that you might be the exception, rather than
the rule.

"Sub-prime" lending means lending to folks who have demonstrated history of
being problematic for creditors. While there is definitely profitability in
servicing this market, it must be done with care and careful screening. A 65%
surge in NFI's production volume in the 4th quarter alone suggests quite a bit
of pressure on that screening process.

There have been other "sub-prime" lenders that have flared brightly for a while
(Green Tree and Flagship Mortgage come to mind). The reports written about them
by some were just as glowing as the one you referenced. However, both entities
are now defunct, their investors badly burned.

The main problem with success for the "sub-prime" lender, is that it usually
comes at the expense of underwriting standards.

I have not investigated NFI, and I saw that you believe they have insurance and
rate hedges to cover exposures, but it is amazing how quickly these "supports"
fail when the company starts going south. The "wiggle room" for the insurers is
the claim of fraudulent practices.

I believe that any money put into these type of financiers might be
appropriately called "speculative" money rather than "investing". But that is
my opinion only and might be worth as much as what you paid for it (nothing) or
it might be worth much less than that.

Hi Paul,

Here's someone a little more positive on RPM than I am.

"Believe it or not, a number of top-performing stock-picking strategies are
based on these simple truths.

Consider the stock-picking technique of Geraldine Weiss' Investment Quality
Trends, which is in first place for risk-adjusted performance over the past 15
years. Among the blue-chip companies on which she focuses, she will recommend
one for purchase only if its dividend yield rises to near the high end of the
historical range of yields for that stock.

She profits when that yield declines as the stock's price rises.

Similarly, Weiss recommends selling a company if its yield drops to the low end
of that historical range.

For example, Weiss currently rates RPM Inc. (RPM: news, chart, profile) a "buy"
because its current 4.8 percent yield is near the high end of the historical
range of the stock's yield, which extends from 2.7 percent on the low end to
5.0 percent at the high end."

The company will be familiar name to old-time value players because it was
mentioned so many times as a long-term buy-and-hold by Phil Carret, a 'grand

his late nineties.)

I notice that Pioneer Investment Management, which I believe is the manager of
the Pioneer Fund which was started by Mr. Carret, still holds a substantial
position. As does Carret and Co. However, they have reduced their holdings
according the the latest report I see. Another negative for me is that debt/eq.
has been increasing. Also, it's a thinly traded stock, and it's difficult to
get outside information on it.

I like that GEF sells below book value (which it seldom does) and at a
relatively low p/sales. The stock is hitting new lows.

Per Yahoo, "Greif Bros. Corporation and its subsidiaries principally
manufacture industrial shipping containers and containerboard and corrugated
products." I assume this business is related to the US economy and trading

little paranoid (who in big oil in California isn't?), but competent, talented,
and stolid. They had an emphasis on the bottom line. What I liked about Chevron
(as a consultant) was that when they undertook a project, they took the time
and spent the money and people resources necessary to do a first-class job. No
cutting corners if they moved forward. (Most of my other clients couldn't or
wouldn't operate like this.)

Sorry I didn't buy and hold Chevron lo these many years ago when prices were
lower. I've bought now though as I've posted. My intent is to hold at least for
a few years.

Dividend helps.

<<Spekulatius. I'll say CVX will recover at some point.>>
Good to hear your perspective, regarding CVX. I am sure they will recover.
Chevron was an well managed oil company, but since they merged with Texaco,
they seem to have lost the edge a bit. The earnings miss was quite significant
for a company this size, so i don't think that all has been bad luck or one
time events.

What I like about MRO is that they will be taken over at some point, IMO. They
are too big to be independent and too small to take over another significant
player.

Spekulatius, re. defense stocks. There was a short discussion of GD on the
Buffetology thread. As a result of that I looked more closely at GD, and
decided it would be a buy for me. I started a small position. I intend to add
more if stock drops lower.

I am still holding a number of defense related companies:

These include ADG as a small-cap value stock.
HON as a long-term play (stock now @$24. GE was willing to pay $53 for it.
(asbestos issues now?)
NOC large-cap beneficiary of government defense spending increases.
Conglomerates SVC (tactical vehicles) and GFF (telephonics)
And I have a couple of more I'm evaluating.

hi, paul. With regard to my post this fall:

re: TSG (Sabre Group)
I have not added since then. I still think the business model and valuation (pe
= 10) are compelling. However, the new proposed DOT regulations are thought to
significantly harm the "distributors" in favor of the airlines. On the last
conference call, management professed not to be worried because historically
the regulations changed "180 degrees" from the proposals. I'm going to hold
(not add) unless even more compelling valuations are to be had (price < $13).

re: Safeway (SWY)
I'm still holding, but not adding given earnings and margin declines. Current
PE is under 10. I still believe the market is mispricing Walmart's grocery
"advantage" relative to Safeway/Kroger and underpricing Safeway/Krogers
advantage relative to the rest of the grocers. I think SWY's higher margin,
higher SKU count (i.e., selection), higher levels of service will work in the
long run against Walmart. It's pretty annoying to shop at Walmart (I do) and
not find the flavor you want, the brand you want, the salt-free version, etc.
If you look at the institional ownership of KR and SWY you will see what good
value company you are in (Clipper, Davis, Oakmark, Legg Mason, etc).

re: UNM
I am still waiting for the 15s to add my small position. Current PE of 7 and PB
= .63.

re: WIND (Wind River Systems)
I still hold but doubt is building despite the valuation, prospects,
technology. I wonder if their new pricing model is too generous to customers. I

I was active Friday buying stock.

You asked about REITs. I added substantially to NHP (Nationwide Health) in the
$13s. This is a triple-net-lease healthcare REIT. FFO and dividend yield is 13%
(100% payout). Debt is rated weak investment grade. It is much cheaper than
comparables like HCP (which I also own). Listen to their conference call this
week for color on why to buy. The stock was cheaper during the last nursing
home crisis (which they seemed to navigate adroitly) but i don't think a
nursing home crisis is likely to happen again now. If the dividend was cut 40%,
you'd still have an 8% yield.

I added to Lafarge (LR), the global cement manufacturer, at $15.64. Senior debt
is rated baa1, the PE is under 10, and it has historically grown earnings at
double-digit rates. I will re-start Cemex (CX) shortly based on similar
valuation.

I bought British Petroleum (BP) at $39. PE is about 14. The five-year low stock
price is about $35. I succumbed again to the siren song of thinking about
China's oil consumption 10 years from now.

I added to ADP at $34.58. PE is about 20. I'm paying up for earnings quality
and historical earnings growth. I sold part of my position this fall at $40.

I added to McDonalds (MCD) at $14.23. The PE is under 10.

I tripled down on Toys R Us (TOY) at $9. Oakmark is big in this one. P/S is
.17, PE is 7.5, PB is .52. The company is in the midst of a long
CAPEX-intensive turnaround which seems to be working. The five-year low is
$8.50. I passed on Circuit City which also looks interesting in favor of TOY.

I started Furniture Brands Int'l (FBN) at $21.39. PE is under 9, double-digit
EPS grower, senior debt is rated baa3. Reputation for management and earnings
quality is high.

I added to Cadbury Schweppes (CSG) at $22.63. The company bought the #2 gum
company Adams for $4B. Senior debt is rated baa2, PE is under 9, double-digit
EPS grower. I may throw my Wrigley position into this given the valuation
disparity.

I started Tyson Foods (TSN) at $10.28. PS is .16, PE is 9, baa3 rated senior
debt. The board is in-bred and I believe insiders have disproportionate voting,
but I like their market position and price-to-sales.

I re-entered American Management at $11. I previously sold this at $20. The
company has no long-term debt, PE about 13, market cap about $470m, trailing
revenues $1010, working capital is over $200m, and I think good credentials in
systems consulting for government agencies. Five year stock price low is $10.

Sunday, rambling on: Nice article in today's NY Times by Mark Hulbert "Value
Stocks Are Cheap and Not Especially Risky".

Talking about value stocks as a class and value as measured by price/book.

A quote from the article:

"Two finance professors, Eugene F. Fama of the University of Chicago and
Kenneth R. French of Dartmouth, report that value stocks have beaten growth
stocks by 3.7 percentage points a year on average from 1927 to the end of 2002.
(Some researchers suspect that the difference may be smaller than this, but
none argue that growth stocks have outperformed value stocks.)"

So by the "efficient market hypothesis" it "should be" (my quotes) that value
stocks must be more risky than growth stocks because value stocks have that
higher reward.

Hulbert now reports on an academic study where the authors (professors) looked
at brokerage analysts and Value Line recommendations for stocks that the
professors characterized as either growth or value. That these analysts didn't
expect value stocks to outperform growth led the authors to surmise that they
(the analysts) don't perceive value stocks as riskier than growth stocks. (If I
am interpreting Hulbert's article correctly.) In other words, value beats
growth and value is no more risky than growth.

Here is the abstract cited by Hulbert:

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=360680 .

----------------------------
To me, this is all part of what I call The Big Investing Puzzle. And somehow
it's wrapped within this SI thread. I have seen that we all have different
"value" investing styles. And some seem to work well, and some particularly
well at certain times. So we seem to be pretty careful about criticizing
others' styles and performance. In this market, I will guess that not many of
us - if any of us at all - can be doing so well we can comfortably assure
ourselves of the superiority of our own method over anybody else's. (aside: at
least we mostly all lean to that "better" 'value' side, rather than the other
'growth' side -g-)

For me it has been a goal to determine and utilize a "normative" method of
investing. The Holy Grail for me being "The" normative -- not just "a"
normative. By normative I mean "the proper" "the proven" "the correct" way of
investing. One with academic support and empirical evidence (Real-world people
using it to make money.). "A" method or "The" method which is able to be
replicated by the average investor. (So, for example, on the Buffetology
thread, I have occasionally suggested that since Warren Buffett is arguably a
genius and unique in his work and the results he's obtained- he does not
provide a normative way to invest because his results cannot (imo) be
duplicated by the average investor.)

My point is (somewhere? -g-) that this Hulbert article shows that value beats
growth, and that it's apparently well-known and not a surprise at all. And that
"value" is defined at least in part by low price to book value. Yet for
investors here who define themselves as value investors, there doesn't seem to
be all that much emphasis being placed on book value. At least sometimes, more
important considerations seem to be the use of stops, selecting or avoiding
certain sectors, or limiting selections by market cap. or float. Buying up
versus averaging down. Or sometimes emphasizing the determining of hidden
values with a business or the seeking out of information not available to the
general public. Not that these are not significant aspects to investing, but
they do not seem to be closing in on 'a' or 'the' normative investment model
that I'm seeking.

You state that price-BV is "part" of the equation, yet you seek "The" normative

I'm not much good at absolute normative philosophies. My basic view is a
medium-size portfolio should pick 30-40 good stocks you believe in for
plausible reasons then trade them carefully and intelligently. I see people
buying stocks that just get slaughtered in the wrong market climate, based on
normative ideological criteria.

Unless your time horizon is Buffett's "close the markets for ten years, I don't
care", ideological rigidity does not seem to be the magic key to great returns.

The irony is that the market is not perfect, and any Magic Bullet criterion
will be discovered and copied so widely that it loses value. You are looking
for certainty and direction on a shifting ice floe, shaped and battered by
thousands of different forces simultaneously.

How is that for rambling?

Imo there's lots of evidence that book value would likely be included in a
normative approach.

For example, you've seen those studies in the "Contrarian Investment
Strategies" by Dreman, in Tweedy Browne's "What Has Worked in Investing", and
again in this NY Times article where price/book value (or the academic
equivalent) is used as a simple proxy which separates companies into either
value or growth categories. And there doesn't seem to be much argument against
using p/bk for doing that, according to Hulbert.

It'd be my opinion that after carefully picking a number of stocks and then
"trading them carefully and intelligently" that would only be a normative
method if it could be done by an investor under defined rules and with skills
that the average investor could muster. I'd guess the subset of people with
such skills and talent is so small as to preclude this as an effective way to
manage money for most people.

Certainly if there were a magic bullet, it's general use would render it
ineffective. Dreman was asked why he wasn't worried about sharing his methods
and his supporting evidence. He said that he once was, but that after his first
book came out, he realized people didn't have the patience or discipline or
interest to pursue his successful methodology. So I say, let me first find a
magic bullet-- I'll worry about its diminishing effect later. -g-

Perhaps because of exposure to Buffett's take on it, I tend to view EMH based
research as not adding much value. Most of the time the conclusions are obvious
or irrelevant. One of the best attempts to answer "The big investing puzzle'
was 'What works on Wall Street" which ranked P/B in the middle in terms of risk
adjusted returns. Stock buybacks lower book as do charges, yet the former can
imply prosperity and rational allocation of capital and the latter may drive
the price below intrinsic value. I think most of us on this thread are aware of
the 'science' aspect that low P/B, PE, PEG and various other ratio's are
usually less likely to have priced in expectations unlikely to be met. An
interesting question is whether one should blindly follow a low multiple
strategy or look deeper at qualitative issues and/or red flags that might
indicate that the apparently 'attractive' low multiple is anything but. Most of
us seem to go well beyond simplistically buying low multiples...so in the final
analysis it comes down to a combination of methodology and judgement...both of
which are imperfect and will continue to be so.

other, judgment/feeling/qualitative aspects. Seems to me on the selling line
judgment/feeling/qualititative comes into it more. That's because, imo it seems
easier to mechanistically determine "undervaluedness" than it is to determine
full or fair value, i.e. when the stock should be sold.

Paul,

<<<Yet for investors here who define themselves as value investors, there
doesn't seem to be all that much
emphasis being placed on book value.>>>

I typically use some kind of book value ratio when running screens, but the
problem I run into more often than not is book value is often skewed. A company
that capitalizes big chunks of current expenses as assets can accrue impressive
book values over a period of time without having anything worth diddly in an
arms length transaction. Intangibles can also throw the ratios way out of wack,
especially in situations such as AOL where acquisitions were made with stock
swaps at the top of the market. I think most of us automatically disregard
goodwill when crunching numbers, but that can also throw off the calculations
in circumstances where an acquired business actually represents a good value in
a market tested arms length transaction. The baby gets thrown out with the bath
water.

A few examples come to mind. As I recall, we both had stock in what used to be
S3 some years back. Book value was around $6 and the stock eventually hit a low
under $2. Tucked away in their assets was a 17% stake, at cost, in a
semiconductor factory in Taiwan. Two years after the bottom, the stock was
trading over $35 and their investment in the chip factory was worth twice as
much as the entire company.

Around the end of 1999 Carmax, which was a Circuit City tracking stock, was
trading around $2 at a good discount to book. The company was still losing
money at the time, but had a decent track record for growth and increasing
profitability. I seem to recall mentioning it here at the time, and although
there didn't seem to be much interest, the stock eventually went over $30.

On the flip side, I recall mentioning Eagle Geophysical, which also didn't seem
to get much interest. It was trading at less than .1 of book, went bankrupt,
and the stock was canceled.

I suppose if there's a point to any of this, it's that book value is probably
worth screening for, but is useless without a ton of DD to get a feel for how
accurately it reflects true shareholder equity. My guess is Warren Buffet
doesn't run screens for companies trading at a discount to book, then starts
entering market orders to buy a few million shares based on Yahoo profiles.<g>

Something I ran across over the weekend and thought was interesting.

http://www.icmasset.com/pubs/pubs.html

Click the "Special Publications" link and pull up the "Wall Street Transcript
Interview with Jim Simmons". It's an older article, with some outdated stock
picks, but the strategies he outlines gives an interesting slant on a lot of
the value investing techniques I've seen discussed here from time to time. In a
lot of ways it looks like kind of a hybrid of what you and I use, and is
probably fairly close to what I've seen James Clarke mention using for his own
personal account. I don't know if that makes it "the" system or "a" system, but
I think it's worth reading. FWIW, it's probably easier to read by printing it
out than fooling around with the PDF display.

I'll follow you into some of these stocks and for some of the same reasons:

1. I'll try to reduce my cost basis in TOY today by adding to my long-held and

2. I continue to build my position in CSG. I added a bit more today.

3. I have been considering ADP for several months. I finally decided I would
step up with a small buy. According to S&P, ADP sales and earnings growth are
slowing to the single digits. (S&P is negative on the stock given its premium
price.) If growth is slowing, the stock may drop further. It's rare though that
one gets to buy ADP cheaply. And it is still not cheap now. OTOH, given the
company's strengths and past performance, I'll bet ADP could rally if the
market sees better days. If this doesn't happen, maybe in 18-24 months the
earnings and revenue gains will result in a higher price for ADP shares.

Here's an interesting way to handle the asbestos liability:

"Honeywell asbestos deal may be copied
Sunday February 2, 7:30 pm ET
By Christopher Bowe and Andrew Hill in New York

Honeywell's deal last week to escape asbestos exposure by selling its Bendix
unit to a company in Chapter 11 is a creative use of bankruptcy law that could
be repeated by others, legal experts said.
Federal-Mogul, a vehicle components maker under bankruptcy protection for
asbestos liabilities, will take on the Bendix brake pads business, which has
about $1bn in annual sales, solely in exchange for assuming its asbestos
liabilities.

The acquisition sets off a process where Honeywell can receive a court order
barring any more claims against it related to its ownership of Bendix. Such a
move is potentially the first where a debtor made an acquisition with asbestos
liabilities and helped the seller.

"When the debtor makes an acquisition, everything else flows," said David
Berkin, attorney at Kirkland & Ellis in Chicago. "Depending on their
circumstance, other companies would be interested in this structure."

That circumstance depends on finding a willing buyer and seller, with an asset
that brings value to the group in Chapter 11.

These liabilities are then added to Federal-Mogul's existing pot of asbestos
claims, which are paid for by a trust set up in bankruptcy reorganisation.
Emerging from bankruptcy, Federal-Mogul is protected from future claims, and by
extension Honeywell would receive the same treatment. Honeywell has a $2bn
insurance provision that can be used to pay future claims against
Federal-Mogul.

Federal-Mogul's deal was reviewed by its bankruptcy court judge and received
considerable support from its creditor committees.

It plans to emerge from Chapter 11 this year with the asbestos claimants owning
50.1 per cent of its new shares in a trust to pay out liabilities. Existing
noteholders will own the remaining 49.9 per cent of the company.

"This is a good deal for everybody concerned. It makes sense for the claimants.
It makes sense for Federal-Mogul. And it makes sense for us, and common sense
is likely to prevail," David Cote, Honeywell's chief executive, said.

Many otherwise healthy companies face significant asbestos exposure through
units, but cannot, or will not take the whole group into bankruptcy.

Recent studies estimate nearly 60 companies are in bankruptcy protection due to
asbestos claims, while asbestos-related litigation costs could reach $275bn.

Honeywell recently struck another settlement for its Narco unit, following
settlements by ABB, Halliburton and Sealed Air.

One person close to negotiations in those deals said no one wanted bankruptcies
and "the sound rational approach is to make compensation available now". For
example, ABB would have been litigated for at least 10 years in 12 different
countries without a settlement."

the usual suspects with emphasis on enterprise rather than price

Qualitatively, on the buy side some businesses and business models, like video
conferencing, are very attractive to me. I try to guage the extent I have a
'feel' for the business or will be the last to figure out when it's circling
the drain. I'm paying more attention to red flags in the aftermath of recent
blow-ups [sort of like a deer the day after gun season starts]. Look for
management issues like 'fit' compensation, prior problems. Look at competitive
issues broadly[5 forces]. I always look at the chart but pay chart signals more
heed in businesses where I don't have as good a handle on the situation.
On the sell side, if the market hands me a quick 30+% , I'll often look at
getting out [On a trendline break] unless events have kept up with or exceeded
the rise [big contract]. Newly discovered red flags will often send me
scurrying towards the exit, too. Sometimes it's better to sell when the

because it can be tough to be objective when you have a chunk of something.

In looking at competitive issues, I've tried Porter's model (I assume that's
your five forces model). It's never really encouraged me make a buy decision;
the analysis has been too difficult or time-consuming for me as an outsider to
use. However, there've been a couple of cases where some of the competitive
issues stood out so quickly, that I was easily able to dismiss the stock as a
buy candidate. So maybe the model best works for me as a screener.

Regarding some of the stocks we've talked about here, I still have
video-conferencer PLCM on my watch list. And I watched it nearly double -g-.

i have noticed them knock the shorts several times. they said similar things in
the latest OID, and also boasted about how glad they were to take advantage of
the volatility to buy more stock in their great "partner", FLM.

this has got to be one of the bigger blow-ups for them, but i would be
interested in their take at this point. is this just a death spiral, or is it a
ten-bagger waiting to happen? hopefully Longleaf will address this issue in
some depth on their next webcast (one of the few mutual funds i know of that
provides such a service--just one of the things that sets Longleaf apart from
the riff-raff which makes up much of the industry).

in my mind, FLM has taught the real lesson: diversification is a
virtue--because you never know when today's greatest stars may become
tomorrow's biggest losers.

Paul: I'd agree with your observation that the Porter perspective is far more
useful helping the investor see problems, issues and limitations than it is for
seeing the positives. I tend to agree with Charles Ellis that investing is a
'loser's game' by which he means that winning the 'game' is all about avoiding
big losers [Clearly my experience hasn't lived up to that ideal, having had my
share of clunckers...but I fault errors rather than aspirations for that].
I tend to look at companies that are having problems where the price has taken
a big hit. A key issue is whether the problem is temporary and fixable or the
price drop is only partial recognition of an UGLY NEW REALITY...a secular
change in the business' prospects going forward. Often such changes revolve
around competitive issues and that's where the Porter perspective is helpful. I
include 2 additional 'forces' - legal/regulatory and the health of
complementors [enabling factors such as the sales of hotdogs would be to a
mustard vendor]. I often do this analysis after an initial 'ready, fire, aim'
buy based on a quick initial look.

Paul, i never understood the ROE model. Isn't the ROE model really implying a
certain earnings growth as well as cash usage? I use the Net present value
model (which is pretty much equivalent to a discounted cash flow model) to
estimate the net present value of a stock.
My model implies a discount rate (8%) and calculates the NPV of the dividends
(which are growing by the same rate then earnings in my model) and the NPV of
the stock after 10 years (based on an estimate PE ratio). I use an excel
spreadsheet to do so.

Spekulatius, (late night rambling): my ROE model is rather more backward
looking than the forward looking NPV models are. I calculate an average ROE
based on historical ten-year's data (if I can get it).

I also use a discount rate; and as with you, 8%. But I vary it plus or minus
0.5% depending on the industry I'm looking at and how consistent ROE seems to
be (judgment call).
I've been considering dropping that 8% number as interest rates have come down,
but I've not done that. That would result in the model giving higher estimates
to the value of stocks being considered. I use the model as a screen and to
check to see if I'm overpaying, so I keep the more conservative 8% number.

One big shortfall of the model (that I use) is that it doesn't take account of
debt/equity ratios. That ratio has got to be looked at separately. (We know
that given two similar companies with the same ROE, the company with no
long-term debt has to be valued more highly than the company where the earnings
are supported by debt and assets.)

The model might imply a certain cash usage, but if so, I'm not aware of it.
There certainly is an implication that ROE going forward will be similar to the
average historical ROE. I only use that average number as a point estimator. In
other words, I could develop a range where I expect the ROE to fall (using
standard deviations and such), but I don't do that.

For me the beauty of the model is that it generally takes me no more than one
minute to tell if a stock might be a candidate for me or not based on its
current price and the results of a simple mental calculation with a few input
variables.
---------------------------------------

The problem that I have for using net present values calculations on dividends
is that there are so few companies that pay dividends or that increase
dividends that the subset of companies which could meet a NPV bogey is very
small. Or perhaps I am not doing the calculations properly. Or maybe that small
number is exactly what's required...all one might need are just a few good
stocks.

For dividend-paying companies I often employ a relative-dividend model. The
idea being that when the dividend yield is relatively high, that signals a low
stock price (and a buy). Similarly, when the stock rises and the dividend yield
is lower than it usually is, it's time to sell. Dividend yields (stock prices)
have fluctuated as interest interest rates have fluctuated. So a 7% dividend
yield might not have been "high" for a particular stock when interest rates
overall were at 8,9, or 10 percent). Therefore this model compares the stock's
current yield to the relative yield of that stock to the S&P 500. My book
reference here is "Relative Dividend Yield" by Anthony Spare. As an example,
for Chevron from the 1960's through the early 1990's (a time when Chevron's
dividend was increasing), it was a buy if you could get it when its dividend
yield was about 160% or more of the S&P yield. And it was a sell in that
timeframe when the dividend got down to 115% of what the S&P 500 yielded. Right
now, CVX is a buy -- according to the model anyway -g- -- because its dividend
yield (4.3%) is about 228% of the S&P 500 dividend yield (1.89%, per Barron's).
Of course, one assumption is that the company isn't going to cut the dividend.
What I find interesting about this model is that as the S&P yield increases
because S&P stock prices drop (as is happening now), then Chevron becomes less
of buy even if its dividend and its stock price remained unchanged.)

We haven't talked about newsletters much but this piece on NFI from Mark
Hulber, the newsletter guru, is an interesting perspective:

If you could pick just one stock...
By Mark Hulbert, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 12:02 AM ET Feb. 5, 2003

ANNANDALE, Va. (CBS.MW) -- How would you like to buy a stock whose earnings per
share have more than doubled over the past year and which also sports a
dividend yield of more than 18 percent?

I thought you would.

And so does Dennis Slothower, editor of the Stealth Stocks newsletter. In fact,
this stock is the only one that he currently recommends to subscribers, as he
otherwise believes cash is the best investment right now.

The stock is NovaStar Financial (NFI: news, chart, profile), a real estate
investment trust.

However, on the theory that something that appears too good to be true often
is, I'm devoting this column to mining the Hulbert Financial Digest database to
see what additional light can be shed on this stock.

This performs a real service, if I say so myself, because NFI is not widely
followed by Wall Street brokerage firms. Standard & Poor's Corp. identifies
just one national brokerage firm that regularly monitors the company and just
one regional firm, for example.

In any case, newsletters -- unlike brokerage firms -- provide an independent
and unbiased perspective, since they are unmotivated by the prospect of
investment banking business.

The first step in my investigation was to query the Hulbert Financial Digest
database for any other newsletters besides Slothower's that currently own NFI
in their model portfolios. I discovered one other: Listed Insight, published by
Jim Collins (who also edits OTC Insight and Biotech Investor Insight).

This is my first step in researching a stock because placing a stock in a model
portfolio is the highest tribute a newsletter editor can give a stock --
higher, in fact, than a "buy" or even a "strong buy" rating. The fact that
another newsletter editor agrees with Slothower about NFI is a positive sign.

The next step in my examination: Find out if any other newsletters have
recently sold NFI from their model portfolios. It would have been a warning
flag if there were. But there was none among the 160-plus newsletters tracked
by the HFD over the last year.

The third step in my investigation of NFI: Check Slothower's and Collins' track
records. It turns out that both have beaten the stock market with their
respective letters -- not just with the two of their services whose model
portfolios currently own NFI, but each of their other newsletters as well. (The
only exception is Collins' Biotech Investor Insight--though because the HFD has
tracked this letter only since last summer, the jury is still out.)

As the final step I turned to the stock screening services that appraise
hundreds, if not thousands, on a single rating scale. These screening services
are already a valuable source of insight, and they will become increasingly
important in the months and years to come -- since the settlement between the
large Wall Street brokerage firms and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
compels those firms to regularly report the conclusions reached by independent
research.

The best-known of these independent firms -- Value Line, Inc. and Standard &
Poor's Corp. -- do not rate NFI. But a handful of others that the HFD tracks
do. Here's what three of them have to say about the stock:

Ford Equity Research (publisher of Ford Investment Review): NFI has a Quality
Rating of "C", its lowest rating. This rating "is based upon overall financial
strength and earnings predictability. It can be used as a tool to reduce risk."
NFI thus is considered to be a high-risk investment.

PortfolioGrader.com (published by Louis Navellier, who also publishes MPT
Review and Blue Chip Growth Letter): NFI has a grade of B on an A to F
schedule, which Navellier translates as a "buy" rating (though not as strong a
"buy" as an "A" grade).

Zacks Adviser: NFI is rated "1" on a 1-to-5 scale, its highest rating, a
"strong buy."

The bottom line from the investment newsletter community? While high risk, NFI
is an attractive speculation.

I found a simple dividend model insufficient. What i do is
1) estimate a growth rate for earnings and dividends for the next ten years
(mostly i assume that dividends grow with the same rate than earnings)
2) Calculate a stock value in 10 years based on an estimated PE ratio and the
earnings the stock may have after 10 years.
3) calculate the NPV of 10 years of dividends and the stock (discounted with
the discount rate, the sum of which is the NPV)

So in my model, I assume that i will hold the stock for 10 years and collect
the dividends and then sell the stock. For growth rates, I mostly use a rate
somewhat lower than what analysts are estimating.
The debt /equity ratio is just one of the risk factors. other risk factors are:
market share, industry, competitive position etc. The higher the overall risk
the higher i choose my discount rate.

looking at valuation, only long term models make sense of course, so 10 years
is as good as anything.
FWI:
NPV for MRO is 24.34$ (5% growth for dividends and earnings, PE=13 after 10

An interesting perspective on our recent discussions about strategies.
Obviously it ignores the idea that buying a value stock at a cheaper price
means a better value. But worth considering:

To:energyplay who wrote (17869)

View Replies (1) | Respond to of 17916

One of the biggest mistakes I have made in the past was worrying about price. I
always assumed it was important to buy a stock at the right price, to try and
get it on the cheap. If the bear market has taught me anything, it has taught
me that price doesn't mean anything in the world of trading/investing. It's the
rate of return that's important.
The rate of return.

It doesn't matter what the price is, it's the rate of return on our investment
dollar. Does it really matter if we pay 50 cents or $50 dollars if the rate of
return on our investment is 20%?

Since I have adjusted my thinking to buy stocks that are rising, my portfolio
hasn't shown a negative rate of return in almost two years. That doesn't mean I
haven't had losing trades, because I have. Since I was buying stocks that were
rising, my winning trades far outweighed my losing trades and I have done it
with very little risk.

If we were to sit down and come up with a winning strategy for investing, I
find it hard to believe we would include trying to catch bounces off stocks
showing huge declines. Although we can have success with this strategy from
time to time, it isn't a strategy that produces consistent profits. Neither
does the strategy of averaging down.

I know from my years in sales that one must develop a winning strategy if one
were to have consistent results. Consistency was very important to me because I
was paid by straight commission. If I gambled or cut corners and didn't
succeed, I didn't take a pay check home, and this happened on many occasions
until I learned to follow a winning strategy and concentrate on consistency.

I have assimilated this strategy to investing and I am amazed at the success I
am enjoying without all of the risk. I won't have the highest returns, but
being consistently profitable is my goal.

If I can show a profit in years the indexes are down, and beat the S&P 500 in
years it shows a profit, then I will consider myself successful. Setting
realistic goals is part of a winning strategy.

There are a lot of ways to make money in the market, but from a risk to reward
basis, based on my objectives, I'm only interested in buying stocks that are
rising, as opposed to trying to catch bottoms. Being a hero isn't one of my
objectives, beating the S&P 500 on a consistent basis is.

I earned many awards in management because I worked with my strongest people. I
let the weak ones die on the vine. The weak ones took too much effort and wore
me out. The reward didn't justify the effort. That's how I'm looking at
investing now. I'm looking to buy strength. EP doesn't look like a winner to
me. When it does, I'll buy, but the price will be higher than it is today. I
don't need the grief. I'm looking for rate of return. Price doesn't matter to
me anymore.

All in my opinion, of course.

I'm not one for competitive investing. Where the goal is "show a profit in
years the indexes are down, and beat the S&P 500 in years it shows a profit."
I'm more driven by achieving absolute dollar amounts in a future year.

And of course, I'm one for averaging down.

It's my opinion that this question and answer from Bill Miller in that Barron's
article is more relevant to value investors:

Q: You have bought this (edit: Kodak) all the way down. Can you talk about that
strategy?
A: Lowest average cost wins. It's rare for us to pay up for anything, and it's
common for us that if the stock goes lower after we buy it -- and it always
does -- we will buy more of it. If we're not buying more of it, then we'll be
selling it, because it doesn't make any sense to hold onto a declining position
without putting more money into it or changing the weighting in the portfolio.

price war' menu shift being a 'tell' that that's happening.
Dollar weakness and eventual dissipation of the 'Mad cow' panic could provide a
boost as overseas earnings are helped.
So far it looks like the market is telling me I'm wrong as it continues to make
new lows. Oh well.

Wallace Rivers. Maybe it is getting close for ALL again. I believe it was
mentioned here as a buy around the $28 level a few years back when it cratered
on poor earnings. As I posted, I sold my shares last year. Thanks for
mentioning ALL: I'll get ready to try again, if, like you, I can get at lower
prices.

I'm guessing ALL's drop may have something to do with AIG as well as the
general market decline. AIG's BIG add to their reserves this week - supposedly
(we don't know the real reasons, I'm guessing) for P&C business - has spooked
the insurance market. Idea being, if AIG fesses up to having underreserved for
several years' past - and they are the biggest and presumably among the
smartest (supposedly they would not write poor business that other insurers
though then did accept)- then those other insurers will soon be forced to
acknowledge that they too have under-reserved. And this goes back up to
reinsurers too. Not a pleasant time to be an insurance stock investor.

regarding TECD. My model for distributors is to buy them only under book value.
This hasn't worked too well lately. Not much has. My new idea is that, given a
week or so like the past four, to cash in my stocks, run away from the wife,
and just use the monies I can escape with to date real models. :>)

FYI on HD and women shoppers vs. LOW:

Do Women Prefer Lowe's or Home Depot?
08:53 a.m. 02/09/2003

By Karen Jacobs

ATLANTA (Reuters) - Home improvement industry observers have long believed
Lowe's Cos.(LOW)appeals more to women, but a new study finds the retailer
attracts no more female shoppers than its larger rival, Home Depot Inc.(HD)

A survey of 8,200 U.S. households by Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass.,
found that 45 percent of customers at both home center stores were female.

The study, conducted in the second half of last year, was not commissioned by
Lowe's or Home Depot.

"What really stuck out at me was how similar these consumers are," said
Forrester's Christopher Kelley, who analyzed the survey. "Whether you're a
Lowe's shopper or a Home Depot shopper, it's more about whether you're a home
improvement person than anything else."

Women have been getting more attention from home-goods retailers. A national
study by Lowe's last year found 94 percent of female home owners complete a
home project on their own at least once every five years. Home Depot has
noticed steady growth in the number of women attending its how-to clinics to
learn how to install ceramic tile or ceiling fans.

Home improvement industry analysts have said in the past that Lowe's had an
edge with women, with securities firms such as Natexis Bleichroeder saying the
retailer's wide aisles and bright lighting are more appealing to females.

Home Depot has conceded it may have undermarketed to women in the past, but
said it will not focus marketing efforts on any particular customer. "We will
not drop a gender to add a gender," Chief Executive Robert Nardelli told a
recent investor conference.

Forrester's study found Lowe's and Home Depot shoppers had many things in
common. For example, the average age of the Home Depot shopper was 50, compared
with 49 for Lowe's. Thirty-eight percent of Home Depot shoppers have a college
degree, compared with 35 percent at Lowe's.

There were some differences. Home Depot shoppers have a higher average income,
at $60,800, compared with $54,000 for Lowe's customers.

"I think that is more a function of geography than anything else," Kelley said,
noting Home Depot, with 1,500 stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico,
is more dominant in the richest U.S. markets than Lowe's, which has more than
850 stores in 44 states.

But as Lowe's continues to expand to larger markets such as the U.S. Northeast,
Kelley said, "the average income of the Lowe's shoppers is bound to increase."

Kelley suggested both retailers could benefit from technological improvements
such as self-service checkouts, which Home Depot has installed at its busiest
stores.

In morning New York Stock Exchange trading on Friday, Home Depot shares eased
13 cents to $21.50, while Lowe's stock was up one cent to $34.65.

Last month I read the American Association of Individual Investor's article by
John Bajkowski. He summarized the five-year results of different screens he
used to select stocks.

I liked that there were a large number (54 apparently) of different types of
screens, and that two Graham screens showed very good results (doubling or
more) over the five years.

The study's a bit complicated and takes some time to understand - more time
than I had available. I did spot three areas that troubled me:

1. The screens are rebalanced monthly. That didn't seem practical.

2. For the Graham screen and a few other ones (e.g a Neff-type screen), it
seemed that only a few stocks made the final cut (like maybe eight or fewer).
That seems too few upon which to base a definitive conclusion - to me anyway.
(I'd have to look at each rebalance over the five years to understand more.)

3. I have a tendency to sneer at certain investing styles such as O'Neil and
Zweig and yet these styles showed better results than the styles I do like,
like Graham, O'Shaughnessy, or low p/book screens.

Also scoring very high (near the top if I recall) was low price/cash flow.
Until now, I hadn't seen any screen that used this factor exclusively and had
this factor's results show so strongly favorable compared to other factors or
combinations of factors. Furthermore, for a factor I do like - ROE - screening
this way produced worse than average results.

Anyway, James Glassman in today's Washington Post further dissected and
clarified Bajkowski's work. Here's the link:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43293-2003Feb8

I agree with Mr. Glassman, that screens are great for unearthing potential
gems. The original AAII article listed no individual stocks, but Mr. Glassman
was able to get them from his conversation with the author.
Here are a few culled the different screens which Mr. Glassman discussed which
seem for me to be worth a further look (jmo):

Paul,
I read and enjoyed the Glassman article also. But rather than focusing on the
individual stocks mentioned, I'm led to wonder whether any of us really add
value to these screens. My basic assumption is that most VIs start with a
mechanical screen of some kind (one that likely resembles one or more of the
AAII screens). We all intuitively understand that, on average, cheaper is
better whether PS, PE, PB, PEG, etc. However, then we take the list and try to
cherry-pick it. O'shaugnessy specifically warned against trying to do that with
his screens. Try as I might, I've never been able to force myself to buy an
entire screen intact (I came close once). But once we get past the hard
numbers, am I (are we) adding value when we cherry-pick? I'm sure the gifted
few can do it. But can the rest of us?
I guess at least, when we use these screens, we're cherry picking in a cherry
tree.

I haven't done more than a cursory look at the numbers as listed on Yahoo on
either of these, but my question is: "Do you see either of these companies ever
becoming profitable?"

Buying companies who are currently profitable for less than their cash in the
bank is a wonderful thing, but when they're losing money when you buy them, the
results on your "investment" dollar can be quite adverse.

AWRE and ALVR

AWRE does not look attractive unless you are envisioning a rebound in earnings
in the near future.

ALVR looks like an interesting pick that fits in with the strategy as discussed
on the Low Price/Cash Ratio Value Stocks board. The burn seems to have been
reduced enough that you can wait for awhile for this company to turnaround,
although the headquarters location of Israel makes me a tad nervous ...

MCsweet, as I may have commented here before, I think low price/cash ratios are
generally a trap. You want a low price/cash ratio AND a business which which
has real value, so you are getting a worthwhile business for next to nothing.
If the business is basically worthless, I have no interest in owning a piece of
cash run by someone else (who has already demonstrated they can't create value
in a business).

Lightbridge (LTBG), if you can get it at book value of about $5.75, with $4.80
per share in cash, no debt, buying back stock, a P/S of 1.25, and (modestly
positive) earnings plus depreciation of about $.70 per share (recurring cash
flow) is just my idea of such a stock. You are getting a real business for a
buck at that price. Note the company is not forecasting any material
improvement in results this year, although bringing credit checking to Internet
transactions may have significant long term potential, starting this year.

Steve168: I have a small package of such stocks, ALVR being among them. There
are still quite a few out there that fit the category but I'm not buying new
names unless I see any that seem exceptional (and AWRE isn't imo). I am
intending to hold what I do have and give the category more time to show better
results.

Results for me have been spotty so far, and I wouldn't say satisfactory. With
the market as low as it is, I'm tending to place my new bets elsewhere - on
downtrodden stocks representing established companies with real businesses and
with at least some earnings history. (-g- Although my results here aren't
satisfactory either now.)
--------------------

Couple of stocks on my watch list of below-cash, below book stocks were
exceptional performers:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=sina+sohu&d=t

Had someone bought either as part of a package and held on, the profits here
might likely have made up for any and all other losses in the package.

I am still trying to resolve whether it is best to select specific issues after
considering the particular outlook for the company, or else just buy a package
of such stocks which fit the criteria (below cash, below book, no debt) Perhaps
I may have had the worst of it: I chose to go with a package of stocks that
"looked good" to me. And China- related didn't, so I wrongly passed on those
stocks.

Was it at the drop to $40 a few years ago that there was buying by one or more

Psr and p/e now don't look too bad compared to past few years. Not a screaming
buy, imo, but it could work out.

There's a glut of wine. Decent wine (indecent too!) is becoming more
inexpensive. Does anyone have an opinion on whether beer drinkers will, or are,
switching to the cheap wines?

Looked at my log, I purchased at 46.81 in '01. I am embarrassed to tell you how
quickly I got spooked, and traded out at a miniscule profit, leaving a lot of
$$$ on the table.
I kind of think beer drinkers are beer drinkers, they won't necessarily switch
to wine as it comes at a lower price point. BWDIK - I drink both!
On the other hand, with the "Dell Dude" being arrested for being in possession
of cannabis, maybe beer drinkers are switching to substances other than wine!
