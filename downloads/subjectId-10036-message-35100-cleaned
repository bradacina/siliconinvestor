Yes, I do think all three based on several criteria can still be considered
value plays. And I am, as you mentioned, happy that I kept 3/4 of my FCH
shares. FCH's stock price has wierd movements. It will start even in the
morning, be down 0.20 by noon and then finish up 0.20, all while SPPR and BEE
stay even. All three of these I would sell if Hotel Reits continue there
charge. I'd probably sell more shares of FCH above 4. SPPR above 2.5 and BEE
above 2 if they continue moving forward in the next couple of months.

I do want to back down on my SPPR comment as the 'Safest of my Hotel REIT
plays' though. After my discussion with TexasDude here, I do think he raises
some valid points about near-term liquidity risk. That being said, I'm still
holding my shares and consider it a good risk/reward.

OLP does look interesting. From my quick review, solid net income and FFO
compared to share price this past quarter. Can you give me a quick summary of
why you like this Reit over others?

Thanks,

Yes, it's seen as speculating if you're a "nonprofessional" (investor) in the
Ben Graham conservative view (ref. "Intelligent Investor")

Not actually clarified by Dr. Graham afaik, but implication I get is that using
margin might not be speculation when it's carried out by "professionals". Which
I also considered before posting. It leads to the definition of "professional".
Which I couldn't pin down. I consider Madharry though with his experience and
what seems to me (I don't actually know) his running and managing of his stocks
as a business, to consequently be a "professional". Whether he feels that way,
or my view is out of line from how others define or view "professionals", I
don't know.

To get around a lot of this, I specifically chose the noun "player" here and
not "investor". I try to be very careful and very alert anytime I use or see
the word "investor".

Paul,
I was just kidding you with my post!

However, when you allude to 'Professionals' investing on margin and it not
being speculation, let me remind you that a major cause of the stock market
crash back in 1929 was caused by 'professionals' speculating with 10% down
margin requirements. And then we have the greater market crash last year in
which the largest group of 'professionals' caused this market debacle by
leveraging(margin) up to 4 x 1.....we are still paying as tax payers and
consumers for what these professionals have done to us!

Madharry could be a professional investor.......good for him! But for him and
others to place in jeopardy my investments...because when markets
crash.......they impact both margin and non-margin accounts. Only thing
different is that I don't have to rob a bank to make margin calls or sell more
shares to raise funds.

All just my opinion!

IMO, margin is speculative unless what you are buying on margin has very low
volatility (such as a very high grade bond where you earn a spread on the
margin) and/or has a guaranteed payout coming soon, or if you have very
accurate hedges on. I think Graham might be ok with the use of margin in these
types of instances. I think these activities are what he refers to in term
professional.

I don't think he is referring to sophisticated investors who are already fully
invested in stocks, buying more of them on margin. In fact, he advocated not
being entirely invested in stocks.

Load and loads of "professional" investors have gotten blow up using margin. I
don't trust myself to use it to any significant degree (unless again I have a
hedged or low volatility opportunity), but then again I don't have much
confidence that I can time the market. Also, smallcaps typically have plenty of
juice such that I don't feed any compelling to crank up the portfolio's
volatility with margin.

For preferreds, you have to estimate whether the company may suspend dividend
and/or the company may go BK and wipe the preferred holders.

You already mentioned yield, but there is also a question of interest rates -
if interest rates go up and safe bond yields go up, the preferred price will
drop (as any bond) so the yield stays higher than more safe bonds.

Finally there is issue of 15% tax rate eligible preferred divvies vs. not. And
whether 15% rate will survive 2010. :(

On the surface your Citigroup strategy sounds good, however, the mere fact
there is that nice spread between the common and pfd means that 'professionals'
are willing to gamble that your strategy is wrong. This nice spread is there
for one reason......a shaky corporation is the basis for your gamble. Ssfe bets
are when the spread is smaller...if sound investing is ones strategy. As for
having any position in (C) you would have better luck going to Vegas and
putting all your money on red or black, and letting it spin. Remember, it was
only a few months ago that an middle eastern Arab sheik invested a boat load in
(C) common at around $28.00. Hard to believe this guy didn't have some of the
smartest advisors in the world give him the go ahead with his oil money to buy
C stock. Of all the major banking firms.........IMO, it's the shakiest of them
all. Never forget all that toxic debt that got them down to the current bargain
basement share price..........is still on (C) books. None of this stuff has
gone away....the final shoe hasn't dropped on these banks.

I just got off the phone with my next door neighbor......he is the IT manager
for Shell Oil and they just appointed a new chief executive and he is cutting
staff left and right, so if one thinks this economic environment has improved,
just know that suddenly the 'grim reaper' has shown up in Texas and when a
multi-national corporation like Shell is now laying off workers......why would
anyone want a multi-national bank stock in their portfolio?

Hey! I appreciate the points you make......but, I still stand by the position
that margin debt in this market enviroment is a sucker bet with the broker
firms loving that interest you are paying them. Always remember one think about
margin accounts.......the brokerage firm owns your stock and can declare is as
their asset...you get a piece of paper that tells you they have your stock in
'street name' only.......and if the stock goes down you have to give the
brokerage firm more money to cover your margin......all the while you are
paying them interest. Bottom line is that brokerage firms allow margin accounts
for one reason.........so they can make money off the investor.

PGF. Maybe you could explain this to me. This yahoo site claims a 10% annual
yield. I wonder what it really is? And how do you really know? Do they tell you
they expected div payout for the next qtr on their website perhaps?

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PGF

I looked at the holdings page
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hl?s=PGF

and just looked up a few of the holdings. I may not have the exact pref
security, but from my experience, it doesn't matter if you buy a G, H or W,
they all yield around the same. For BAC pref shares, for example, i think they
are yielding 8.6% based on today's price. And BAC is 11.5% of the ETF's
holdings.

MetLife Pref, at 4.3% of holdings, yields 7%
Wells Fargo, 4.8%, yields 7%
Barclays, at 6%, yields 5.5%.

So there's 25% of the portfolio, yielding around 7%. I do not know how they pay
10%. But if you buy the underlying pref stocks, you only get 7%.

Is the ETF leveraged? Is the 10% yield bogus? Why not just buy your own mix of
pref shares and avoid the ETF fees?

regards,
grommit

Right now my mix of pref shares is yielding 11/5% based on today's prices. And
the yield was much much higher a few months ago, when prices were 1/2.

FYI -- pcx vs two reit pref stocks. for what it's worth...

Fitch Downgrades Colonial BancGroup's Ratings Following Receivership
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Subsequent to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp's
(FDIC) action today of placing the Colonial Bancgroup's (CNB) banking
subsidiary, Colonial Bank (Colonial), into receivership, Fitch has downgraded
the Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) to 'D' from 'C'.

Following the bank's closure, the FDIC will sell the majority of Colonial's
deposits to BB&T Corporation. As a result, Fitch has placed Colonial's deposit
ratings on Rating Watch Evolving. Those deposits being assumed by BB&T would
eventually be aligned with BB&T's current deposit rating levels. The ratings of
any potential deposits not included in the transaction would be further
reviewed by Fitch. It is anticipated that parent company CNB will file for
bankruptcy in the very near future. BB&T is not assuming any bank level
subordinated debt or holding company obligations.

A $25 billion banking company headquartered in Montgomery, Alabama, CNB was a
Florida concentrated institution, with the majority of the company's deposits
and assets (including mortgage warehouse) located within the state. In addition
to Florida and Alabama, Colonial also maintained a presence in the states of
Georgia, Texas and Nevada.

PGF. If the PGF yield is higher than the yield on the underlying securities
they hold, then PGF would have to be using leverage or options or else they are
a Ponzi scheme. (Or all three- -g-. Just joking)

I use ETFConnect to see if a fund employs leverage. I didn't find any evidence
of such when I looked at PGF there. I also checked at their website, and I did
not see anything about their use of leverage:

http://www.invescopowershares.com/pdf/P-PGF-PC-1.pdf

Of course I did this before I bought PGF. I concluded that PGF doesn't use
leverage. (Possible I'm wrong.)

Now about the monthly PGF distributions: I wonder if some of the distributions
are return of capital. That always makes me a little nervous when I consider
it, because it's possible that fund management may be giving me my own money
back, so reducing the nav, and yet because they include it in distributions,
the "yield" looks so much higher. With PGF, I see no evidence that any of the
distributions are a return of capital:

http://www.invescopowershares.com/products/overview.aspx?ticker=PGF

The distributions vary of course. As I interpret the description of the fund,
it tries to track an index. That index is market cap weighted and the index
people rebalance it every month. So it seems that PGF rebalances too. And this
may be one more reason that the distributions vary monthly. (Surprised that if
there's rebalancing that there's no reported cap gain or cap loss amounts
showing up in the distributions.)

To my knowledge there's no one standard or correct way to determine yield. I
don't recall how Yahoo calculates it to get 10%. PGF reported the "30-day SEC
yield" at 9.46% on June 30. The 8/14 nav is $16.41. The latest div. (Oops I see
I missed it: ex-div today. I was looking for the announcement date and never
saw it.) is .11242. If I annualize that amount, I get an 8.2% yield off the
nav. And 8% seems reasonably closer to the 7% you are figuring Grommit.

---
I had been following along with you guys and buying preferreds earlier. I have
for example, the two you mention now. And I'm intending to hold them as well.

I am looking for a way to get a better yield on cash until I find suitable
stock investments. I want to take advantage of yields which remain very
attractive --- attractive to me anyway, certainly in comparison to the yields I
get at my bank or from money market funds at my brokerage sweeps. Or from what
brokers charge as margin rates.

I want to take relatively big positions in something I can get in and out of
quickly. Something where I can exit all at once and not forgo too much of the
distribution. In other words, something with a monthly distribution, not a
quarterly one. Because PGF has 34 or so holdings, that reduces business risk
compared to if I held a big position in just one specific preferred. I like
that. (It doesn't reduce market risk or interest rate risk though of course.)
Further, I wouldn't know which specific preferred to pick now if I had to pick
one or two. The days of just picking any or all when the yields were so high
(and prices low) are over. (as of right now anyway -g-)

The etf fee for PGF is .7%. Worth it to me for the positives I hope I am
getting.

Also, fwiw, I'm splitting off chunks of my cash further with adds to bond etf
HYG. Same reasons for me as with PGF.

You need to consider UBTI (unrelated business income) when holding MLP's in an
IRA. if the sum of your UBTI exceed 1000$ in an given year, there are going to
be some problems. Most MLP produce negative UBTI though but there could be
situations (hedging gains, sale or reorganization of business) where the UBTI
becomes positive. So my answer would be that you shouldn't hold too much MLP's
in an IRA to keep under the 1K UBTI threshold, maybe 20k should be OK in all
but the most strange circumstances.

Also to consider is that BWP for example cannot be hold in and Roth IRA account
because of some weird tax rules related to FERC regulated pipelines (that only
BWP seems to enforce). If you do buy BWP in a Roth, it would not pay a
distribution. Investorvillage "Mlps" thread is the best source for UBTI/tax
related discussions.

%BOM---------------------
Date:8/15/2009 5:06:26 PM
From:Paul Senior
You don't file a k-1 if the mlp is in an ira if UBTI is $1000 or less. Building
on what Spekulatius says, you don't want the dreaded UBTI to exceed $1000
though or you WILL have some kind of paperwork to complete (it may include the
k-1 -- I don't know) and conversations with whomever holds your ira, and taxes
to pay.

I believe that the $1000 is cumulative UBTI for the tax year. So if you have
more than one mlp in an ira it's the sum of the UBTI for all of them that
shouldn't go over the $1000 threshold.

So far, in my limited experience with oil/gas mlp's, Spekulatius's opinion is
more correct than my apprehension about having these things in an ira. UBTI is
not just the cash distributions one receives but apparently a calculation
which, in my limited experience is indeed small or negative for the oil/gas
mlp's I have (as Spekulatius finds also.) It's just that the amounts seem to
vary for each person depending on when they bought and how much they bought,
when they sold, which mlp's they bought, etc. so I keep my mlp's in the ira
very small so I don't get surprised with a k-1 with a large UBTI amount.

Now if you go big with mlp's in a taxable account, and you've got something
like a pipeline that crosses states (and some of these pipeline mlp's cross
MANY states), you could fall into the category where these states have laws
which say you are required to file state income taxes. I don't seem to have
amounts large enough to fall in that category -whew.

This of course, all jmo and my experience. I'm no accountant or tax lawyer.

Fwiw: as I have posted here before, my preferred way to play oil/gas mlp's in
an ira is through etf's that specialize in lp's. The positive is that there are
no k-1's issued to me, so no UBTI.

-----
Edit: I should maybe be less opinionated here. This not wanting to have UBTI
over $1000 might be wrong if somebody actually does the numbers. I have heard
of somebody saying, it's not really a big deal hassle if the UBTI DOES go over
$1000: The ira manager/holder/ or whatever the term is (Fidelity/Schwab) fills
out a form and apparently (?) pulls some money from the ira to pay the tax.
From this person's experience it may be worth it financially to keep these
mlp's in the ira and go ahead a pay taxes if necessary. Just hearsay. I don't
have enough facts to know.

re UBTI - Paul is correct. it may not be that big of a deal if the UBTI goes
above 1000$. From what I know, your brokerage custodian has to fill out some
paperwork (if they indeed notice that your UBTI is above 1000$) and they may
charge you for that and you will have to pay taxes from you taxable income for
this UBTI. This is certainly a hassle but may not be a big deal depending on
your particular circumstances.

The problem with most MLP CEF is the leverage. most of them violated leverage
covenants during the Y2008 meltdown and had to deleverage at the bottom. This
of course destroyed their performance. For this very reason, I prefer straight
MLP holdings and keep an eye on the UBTI issue.

Citigroup spread,

The spread is a done deal. The tender offer is over. I am not recommending do
anything with Citigroup at this juncture. It is just an example of a hedged
trade.

I made money buying Citigroup puts, since I could not short the stock, and
tendering the preferred that converted into stock. The money was less than
shorting the stock, but at least I didn't have to worry about a stock loan buy
in. By the way, I didn't use margin to put the trade on.

If you have a method, Madharry, I guess you have to stick with it.

Given that the whole world seems down today, then if the method is technical,
then maybe technically everything's a sell.

Which goes against my preference to buy on down days. Which maybe is now buying
on a dip, which could be wrong. Then again, I believe, or hope, I have a method
too, and I'm sticking with mine.

I've pulled my sell orders for now on oil. At current price, I'll start up
again a buy of a few shares of XOM.

FVE, mentioned here by others, at today's price now looks okay to me. I'll join
Grommit and Spekulatius with a buy of a few shares.

I'll up my few shares in reinsurer AXS by a few more shares. Low forward p/e,
under stated bv, profitable each of past several years (its short history),
small dividend.

I'll take some shares of bdc FSC. Dividend approaches 10%. David Einhorn who
trashed bdc ALD and was proven right, is in this one as an insider. Maybe his
confidence in FSC management is a positive.

FVE. I added some more last week and again today. I have enough now.

TDude -- cutting rates is different from cutting revenue (or revenue
potential). They are clearly trying to keep occy rates up. So try to find
another reason not to buy this one (I am serious.)

"The primary reason for the decline in this quarter’s net income from
continuing operations is our decline in occupancy. Occupancy for the second
quarter of 2009 was 86.0%, compared with 86.5% a quarter ago.... Occupancy is
still the key here. The occupancy drops that we and the industry have
experienced in the past two years appear to be stabilizing...

And it looks like health care is the culprit in the admin expenses...

"In reviewing our medical cost for the quarter, we found that two-thirds of the
increase was due to an unusually large number of health claims exceeding
$50,000. We believe that discretionary spending on elective procedures has
jumped in 2009 because of employees concerns about the economy, job market and
uncertainty about proposed changes to the healthcare system.

These costs should decline to normal lower levels during the coming months.
Encouragingly, you are seeing a greater utilization of preventive care among
our employees with our adoption last year of a consumer-driven health plan. In
the coming plan year, commencing in October, we will lower our health plan
administration cost by roughly $2.5 million annually offsetting an expected 10%
rise in health claim costs related to medical inflation.

You have to have a certain amount of trust in mgmt to invest in anything...

TexasDude,

These rate cuts are no where near the rate cuts that hotels are experiencing
these days. In fact, ADR went from 145.73 in this quarter last year to 146.42
this year. Maybe they are finally cutting rates, but I figure that a company
like this that is just now having to cut rates after the turmoil that has
occured is achieving a victory of some kind.

Plus, they had net income this quarter. I'm continuing to talk myself into
buying some shares.

Before I do, if you have other opportunities that are better than this, I'd
love to hear.

When I look at stocks like FVE, SKH, MDTH, SUNH with an unbiased eye, they
compare very favorable to hotel stocks. Metrics would be RevPar, occupancy,
EBITDA/EV and by my accounting all those metrics look favorable in relative to
historical metrics, or hotel stocks.. if you would indeed regard a stock like
SUNH as a hotel stock (not too much of a stretch regarding the business model)
than the metrics would look superior. That is where the value angle comes in.
Even though that some of those metrics turned slightly negative (gross margins,
Revenue/unit) it is nowhere close to the punishment the hotels have been
receiving.
Texasdude is mixing up business momentum with value, although his approach
seems to be inconsistent (IMO) since he is vouching for HRC which is Capex
dependent partly from those companies that I am discussing here.

FWIW, I bought a little MDTH (@9.44$) today, trading below tangible book and
profitable with moderate debt.

1. please explain why rates cuts and occupancy declines don't impact revenues
in a negative way.

they obviously do.

2. help me understand this rate cutting and drop in occupancy is going to
create more revenue.

The only reason to cut rates/prices is to get more business. If lowering prices
5% allows me to sign 5 new contracts, while if keeping the rates the same I
only sign one, well, lowering rates has added revenue. what i said before was
"cutting rates is different from cutting revenue".

times are tough. just because occupancy is down, contract rates are lower, and
expenses are higher, does not mean that mgmt is stupid or that the stock is not
a value. but, of course, mgmt might be stupid & the stock may not be a value...

i think your posts have pointed out that times are tough, not a reason to avoid
the stock.

think of it this way, instead of saying that this company is a no-buy, answer
this: at what price do you buy this stock?
(Although your answer will not help me to decide anything, your analysis might

I never compared their rate cuts to what hotels are experiencing, so don't
understand why you bring that into the debate. I've never questioned
management's integrity, so again why is that up for debate?(Not your post but
another here that brings up honesty factor of management.) However, with that
said one might go back to the recent CC and listen/read the questioning done by
Jerry Doctrow, analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. Basically, Doctrow is questioning
managements accounting practices.........hummmm!

As for Spet.......bringing up my (HRC).......I fully stated the cap-ex issue,
but then the stock has rallied by more than $11.00 from 52 week low, and FVE
has bounced..what, less than $3.00. Isn't FVE basically a regional(NE)
operation....if so, demographics and local economy is a factor one needs to
look at.

For a suggestion.....on 'maybe' a value, if one is looking for
income..........(BKCC).

And just for the record.........on Cap-EX....look at what FVE states about
their involvement in this issue. So if its so bad for HRC.........what does

favorable ratios there (though does book represent close to market value of
these hotels? Hard to justify these days).

I think I am going to diversify a bit from my pure hotel companies into
companies like FVE. Trimmed some more FCH today at 3.39 to raise some cash for

Hi Paul -
Added to my FR-J preferred to secure the ($0.45/share) September dividend. This
was a 30% increase in shares from my earlier buy (7/22/09) and provides me a
blended dividend yield of 18%. I now have full positions in the IRA of HRP-D,
BDN-C and FR-J.

My exit strategy for the IRA preferred shares is to have these spin off their
dividend income tax deferred and evaluate a sale if any of these trade above
par value which is $25/share.

I am tagging these as "bond" equivalents in the IRA portfolio which replace a
portion of my zero coupon bonds. Even at current levels, the risk reward
"value" seems decent.

==============================================================

I continue to look for high dividend payers with good long term upside. Ship
Finance International Limited (SFL) is one I continue to look at. If management
feels that the Global pending debt crisis is past us, they may increase their
dividend back to their previous levels. The first indication that this may
occur is if their next dividend payment (sometime around 8/22) is paid in cash
only w/o the option of receiving it in shares w/ a 5% discount to the market
price.

The company has sufficient cash flow to double their dividend amount but
reduced it last year to conserve their cash.

TECO Energy Inc. (TE) also is beginning to look interesting on any further sell
off down to $10-$11. Their forward PE would be just below 9 if the average
analysts estimates are accurate.

TransCanada Corp. (TRP) at $26-$27 is on my watch list too. This would yield 5%
at these prices. This Canadian company would benefit significantly from a U.S.
energy policy that promotes NG. Hold this one in an IRA and you will avoid the
foreign tax with holding. The upside is attractive at $40/share in 3 years when
their Canadian/US pipeline is scheduled to be completed.

PPL Corporation (PPL) is getting close to my buy in price of $27.60. This would
yield 5% at that price. Stock continues to sell off and a break through $25.00
could occur if the company reduces their dividend again back to their 8/2005
level (before their 2:1 stock split).

I follow industry analyst Natasha Boyden on Bloomberg TV. I've found her

quickly seems to change her opinions and recommendations. (That could be a

Nothing wrong with owning HRC at the right price :

Now it's trading at 19$ and a PE around 18. Unless there are good growth
prospects that is a little pricey for me. Competitor SYK (hospital beds are
only a small part of their business though) is tough as nails. I heard there
beds are cheaper which may give them an advantage in the current economic
backdrop.The fact that the stock rallied of it's low (less so % wise than FVE
by the way) has nothing to do with this stock being a value or not.

TD,

I guess my main point about these hotel/senior housing stocks is that yes,
they've taken some lumps in their business as well as their stock price. Some
are still down 90% from their highs. That being said, I think there are some
plays on these stocks as values in hopes of the economy turning around.

I own more stable companies definitely, that are growing (like CREE for
example), but I'm not necessarily sure that my returns with CREE (currently
setting a 52-week high) are going to better from today on than they are with
SPPR, FVE, etc...

I do appreciate your insight into the negative parts of some of the companies I
own. But, I expect my stocks trading at $1-$3 a share to have some issues. :)

Healthcare stocks: I looked at HRC again yesterday and at Stryker.

I wrote this last night, but lost my energy to complete my ideas:
=======================
=======================
=======================
Reviewing HRC yet again, I still find it too expensive for me. It's led me to
two others though.

I'm holding many health care stocks. Most are small positions. Some of them I
might benefit from if, instead of looking for new opportunities (new stocks), I
just upped my positions in those that I already have.

For a number of reasons-- one being the health care sector is so broad,
it may not be conceptually correct or even practical to try to use the same
metrics to value all these companies. Nevertheless I AM using estimated forward
p/e multiples as a vector to direct my investing funds. I understand that
analysts are not to be relied on, that even consensus earnings estimates, not
only don't hit their mark many times, but sometimes even fail to get the
direction right. (Analyst estimates usually/always being bullish)

For me, I've just arbitrarily decided that in this funk economy with confusing
political agendas regarding health care, and with health care not really
participating in the recent stock rally to the extent that other sectors have,
that I am not willing to buy any health care company that has a forward p/e of
15 or more.

For me there's no reason to step up. There are so many with lower p/e’s. Of the
many health care positions I hold for which Yahoo shows analyst estimates, I
have:

3 with forward p/e 17+ (HAE, CAH)
1 with p/e 15-16 (BEC)
0 with p/e 14
6 with p/e 12-13 (JNJ, COV, BLUD, BAX, BDX, VAR)
4 with p/e 10-11 (ABT, LTC, MCK, AMG)
4 with p/e 8-9 (AZN, GSK, BMY, UNH)
7 with p/e less than 8
--------------
I have come across two more that I now find interesting because their forward
p/e is in 10-11 area:

ZMH: current p/e=12.5; forward p/e 10.5

SYK: current p/e=14.3; forward p/e about 11.5 adjusted. (SYK has no ltd and
about $6/sh in cash. I subtract that cash/sh from the stock price of $39.77 and
use analysts' consensus earnings estimate of $2.94 (I am just not bothering to
take out the income on $6/sh that might be included in $2.94 ) to get adjusted
estimated p/e of 11.5)

Stryker has had a great history. I believe it's the market leader in its
segment (competitors being JNJ and ZMH).
=======================
=======================
=======================
I find the persistent insider selling by a Styker family member to be somewhat
disconcerting. I did decide though that I would add a few shares of Zimmer to
my holdings. I bought an exploratory position near market close on Tue., with
the intent to add if shares continue to fall.

Hi Paul - Some interesting developments for Votorantim Celulose e Papel S.A.
(VCP) and Aracruz Celulose S.A. (ARA).

VCP completed their buyout of ARA. The conversion was .91 VCP new for each 1
VCP old. VCP new includes all of the ARA preferred. A new holding company was
created where each company (ARA & VCP) now own a 50% interest in this new
company.

http://pulpinc.wordpress.com/2008/09/16/aracruz-and-vcp-to-merge/
Arainvest Participacoes, which holds 28 per cent of Aracruz, agreed to share
control of the two companies with Votorantim Group, which controls VCP.
Arainvest will pay US$292 million to Votorantim Group. Meanwhile, VCP will pay
US$1.5 billion to Arapar, to increase its existing stake in Aracruz to 56 per
cent (up from 28 per cent). Votorantim Group and Arainvest will each own half
of the voting stock of a holding company that will control VCP and Aracruz.

* Votorantim Group is owned by billionaire Antonio Ermirio de Moraes.
* Arainvest is a holding company controlled by billionaire Joseph Safra.
* Arapar is a holding company controlled by the Lorentzen family.

I continue to hold onto my small VCP position. Luckily I was out of ARA before
it tanked.

ARA used to pay a pretty good dividend (6%-8%). I got $0.60/share in Jun 09,
2009 on my VCP shares (around 4%). They tend to pay only once per year.

There should be some value in the combined company today but it already has had
a huge move higher to $15.50/share from $3.50.share in 03/2009. BV is stated as
$11.00/share. It s/b somewhat higher after the VCP/ARA merger. I am not too
sure what the earnings per share will be for the new company. Analysts had the
old VCP earning at $0.97 share on 500 million outstanding shares. ARA old was
to earn $1.11 on 1 Billion outstanding shares. The new VCP should have 450
million shares which translates to EPS of around $3.00/share. They each control
50% of the holding company so VCP's portion of earnings s/b $1.50/share.

ARA seems overpriced while VCP seems underpriced based on the combined earnings
of the new holding company. The per share earnings for ARA from the holding
company s/b less than the amount VCP shareholders receive.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ARA,VCP&d=s

I bet the VCP shareholders will see a pop in their annual dividend.
Historically they were paying 4%.

It's possible that VCP could up their dividend to yield over 5% while still
maintaining a forward PE of 10. If this is the case VCP looks like a "value"
buy below $15.00/share.

I am going to continue to watch VCP and look for their next consolidated
balance sheet before I commit new money.

(HRC) isn't going to be an overnight wonder, however, long-term it has the
potential of making a sound investment...and while you wait, you get a nice
dividend.

As for your mention of ABT and their PE......IMO, this is one of the best
pharma stocks to own. Here are some comments I made about them.....near the end
of the post.

Now if you have some mad money to invest..(AKA).. willing to hit a dry hole,
then I would suggest you look at (PSDV)..Here is presentation slides from CEO
just this month. Drug is in Phase III and data expected by year-end. Pfizer
hold a 10% position in the stock.......but all is riding on this Phase III
trial. Double your money or have a nice stock certificate to cover a bad spot
on the wall. (:>) Don't place a market order.....make the MM come to your
bid......float is thin and spread outlandish.

Re "money to invest" as in investing, or investing operation:

I always have an issue of using "investment" as a substitute word for
speculation. Although the particular stock has only a few years public history
and no earnings, it's possible (or not) that it could work out very well for
somebody buying now or later. People buying now could be very happy with the
stock in future. I've no idea. Accumulating some shares could be a terrific
success as a bet, a speculation, a play,a buy,a use of funds,a purchase, etc.

Given what is publicly known about the company, one thing that a buy of its
shares cannot be (here, on a Ben Graham thread), is as an investment
("investment operation"). (P. 1, Intelligent Investor)

Always important to keep the words and definitions separate, imo. Easy to see
here, as you mention: It's a speculation suitable for mad money perhaps.
Surprising though how many times a people id something as an investment and
when you look closer, they are really speculations.

BJ - almost ended up not buying after the downgrades from JPM and others and
the stock in freefall below 30$.I thought they may know something that I have
overlooked. The argument that BJ's comps may be weak due to food and gas
deflation is true but applies to many other stocks as well so who gives. BJ's
comps have been above average all along and the valuation is somewhat below
average in the retail sector.

I did up getting some on todays dip at 31.12$ but only half my desired
position. I guess I had to pay a little more for the assurance of a decent
earnings report and maybe it's worth it. I am writing this as a note to myself
to stick to my conviction next time.

DecisionPoint Reports Record Operating Profit for Second Quarter 2009

Strong New Business Pipeline Supports Growth for Second Half

FOOTHILL RANCH, CA, Aug 20, 2009 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- DecisionPoint
Systems, Inc. (DNPI), a leading provider of Enterprise Mobility and RFID
solutions, today announced operating results for the fiscal second quarter and
six months ended June 30, 2009.

Financial Highlights

--Second quarter revenues were $12.0 million
--Second quarter gross margins grew to 20.4%
--Second quarter operating profits rose 149% compared to prior year's
period
--Second quarter net loss was $35,000 compared to net loss of $669,000
for the same period last year

Nicholas Toms, Chief Executive Officer of DecisionPoint, commented, "We are
delighted with the outstanding results. We have achieved record operating
profit
and a major improvement in net results in a challenging market environment by
focusing on higher margin business and tight cost controls. Our revenue mix has
reflected this strategic shift to higher margin software and service revenues.
Strong gains in field mobility and managed services opportunities have
validated
the investment we made in these two practice areas."

Second quarter 2009 operating revenues were $12.0 million, a sequential
increase
compared with $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2009, and a decrease from
$15.4 million for the same period last year.

For the six months ended June 30, 2009, revenues were $23.7 million compared to
$28.5 million for the same period last year. The decline was primarily
attributable to the economic conditions during the early part of 2009.

Second quarter gross profit margins continued to improve sequentially to 20.4%
versus 17.5% in the prior quarter and 17.6% for the same period last year.
Tight
cost controls successfully decreased selling, general and administrative costs
to
$1.9 million for the second quarter compared with $2.5 million for the prior
year's period. As a result of these improvements, second quarter operating
profits increased 149% to $524,000 from $210,000 in the same period last year.

Six-month operating profit increased 69% to $389,000, from $231,000 for the
same
period last year.

Second quarter net loss improved to $35,000, compared with a net loss of
$669,000
for the same period last year.

Six-month net loss improved to only $442,000, compared with a net loss of $1.1
million for the same period last year.

Recent Highlights

DecisionPoint recently launched its Field Mobility program, which assists
customers in identifying and achieving faster Return on Investment in
field-based
workforce automation, while mitigating risks of in-house deployment. The Field
Mobility program provides application software and tool sets from multiple
Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Partners in virtually every application
category. DecisionPoint designs, deploys and integrates these solutions using
proven methodology and industry recognized best practices, while managing every
aspect of the rollout, including support services and help desk.

An example of the field mobility program's success is the recent launch of a
mobile, automated patrol officer solution, PatrolLIVE, for security companies
with DwellingLIVE, a software provider of home and community solutions
worldwide.
The enhanced PatrolLIVE solution allows security guards to consolidate all of
their functions on a single Motorola mobile device, while enabling them to add
tasks and be more productive. One of the most significant benefits for
customers
is that they can see the patrol officer's activities in real time through the
PatrolLIVE customer portal on the Internet, which gives an extra sense of
security and peace of mind.

"We are pleased with the initial response to our field mobility program and the
value our customers are already achieving with delivery of customized and
enhanced end-to-end mobile solutions," noted Toms. "DwellingLIVE is just one of
a
number of new customers we have secured recently. We have provided significant
business process improvements using broadband wireless technologies to several
new customers such as Wackenhut, West Marine, Winco Foods, Reagent Chemical,
and
Scientific Games, among others. These projects alone represent more than $7
million in new revenues for us."

"We look forward to the remainder of 2009 and beyond. Our success in signing
significant new customer contracts and building on an already robust pipeline,
gives us continued optimism. We remain focused on profitable growth and
expansion
of higher margin solutions and services," Toms concluded.

"GE as well is worth much more than 13 dollars a share."

Over the past year or so, I've come to different opinion. It's on my "to-short"
list, and I'll initiate a short now.

I find the company to be "un-analyzable" except by experts. And I like the guy
on Bloomberg whose analytical team has consistently been negative on the
company.

Things are not going well for GE in total. GE has slashed its dividend.

My ruling fact though is this: Although GE has a market cap of $146B and cash
of $4.9 behind each share, that is "only" $52B dollars while its total debt is
one-half trillion dollars. (per Yahoo).
Imo, that is way too much debt for one company in this economic environment (or
maybe in any environment). GE can move money around - use its debt to fund some
aspect of its business or offload some of its debt, or obscure it in its
financials -- all up to a point. Then there's a day or days of reckoning. Of
course even if I am right (and I might not be), it could be years from now, and
that is a long time to be short the stock. So I could be right and still lose.

Hi Grommit - Did you notice that HRP hit a new recovery high since the October
2008 fall off the cliff.

From the companies I own, FR is still the lagger. BDN rallied over 5% today.
This may be due to Cramer's pushing the REIT stocks in general and BDN
specifically.

Madharry. I have more cash and more buying power now than I've had in maybe the
past ten years. And that cash really wants a home --- these brokerage sweep
accounts pay nothing.

I have got to keep telling myself to be more careful and not be so cavalier in
reaching to deploy cash-- got to be more patient and not lower my presumed
standards. Just wait for the opportunities to show themselves.

I keep considering putting more money into bond funds or high-yield etf's...
not sure I'm willing to do much more of that though.

I don't seem to be finding the bargains that I used to. And for the first time
ever I have as many as three shorts on. (miniscule amounts though -g-) If I
step back to consider, I have to believe from my perspective that the market's
near a top. I don't want to believe that -- I'm in the market with over 200
positions.

near 31, I rode it up to 38 and then got smacked. Let it go as soon as my gain

jisaacs57. If by BZ you mean Brazilian train company "ALL AMERICAN LATINA
LOGISTICA S A UNIT 4 PFD & 1 COM ISIN #B", you shouldn't apologize for missing
it here. You were lucky.

I bought shares to tuck away. I'm down about 50% from my purchase here 5/'08.
What got me was that it's expensive to buy shares in this company - you have to
go through a 3rd party who has access to the Bovespa exchange, I believe. With
the "extra" charges, it only pays to take large positions, and not lag in with
small buys. Which for me means I'm down about 50% on a relatively large
one-time buy.

One positive for me is that it's not so convenient to follow the stock's daily
or weekly or any moves and news because of where I am and where it's traded.
Which means for me, if I actually bought the shares to tuck away as I say, it's
easy to just keep passing by it when I see it on my portfolio listing. Otoh,
because I'm not alert to it, I likely missed buying more near lows -- presuming
I even had courage to do that (I doubt it.)

Brazil is going to continue to supply commodity staples (soybeans, etc.) to a
hungry world market. I expect eventually that the transportation infrastructure
(American Latina--trains, Ultrapetrol (ULTR)--water transportation (barges/push
boats)) to eventually reflect that with higher stock prices. So I'll continue
to hold.

Fwiw, if there's interest in Brazilian stocks that trade mostly or entirely in
the Brazilian market (maybe called 2nd tier stocks?) there's an etf, BRF that
could be considered. It seems to exclude many of the biggies like the two main
banks, Petrobras, and some other company shares which can be bought on the US
exchanges. The etf is followed on the 50% Gains Thread, where it's close to
reaching a bell-ringing target price. I'm late to this etf; I am a buyer though
of a few shares at current price.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hl?s=BRF

Edit: Going past transportation and fwiw, I'm a fan of Noble Group, a Japanese
company which is a broker for commodities, e.g. Brazilian soybeans.

"Noble is a market leader in managing the global supply chain of agricultural,
industrial and energy products. Our “hands on” approach to business has seen us
grow to become a world leader in supply chain management in just 20 years.
We specialise in the origination and delivery of strategic raw materials,
adding value at each stage of the supply chain. The Group is also involved in
technical ship management, trade finance and coal mining running soybean
crushing plants and sugar/ethanol mills in Brazil, amongst others.
Our global network encompasses more than 100 offices in over 40 countries
across five continents. From our Asian headquarters, Noble Group serves more
than 4,000 customers worldwide."

I can completely understand many of your points the high debt load is worrisome
and the dividend cut painful as well. However it was a smart move to preserve
cash especially considering the severity of the recession /depression. Their
corp business in Manufacturing and healthcare are still very solid money makers
most of the reason for the massive drop in share price was fear of their
financial arm imo. I could be wrong but if they can slim down their debt in the
Buffett sense sure looks like a dollar for 50 cents to me.
