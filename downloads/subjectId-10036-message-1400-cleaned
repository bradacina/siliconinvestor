I'm watching a stock that has gained 2 dollars per share in one week on
increasing volume. It recently reported a revenue increase of 36%, while net
income increased from 150,000 to 1.6 million. It had a book value of 8.00, a
price to book of .96
earnings of 1.02, return on equity of 13% and a PE of 8. Could this stock be
considered a possible value investment? Is there anything else to be taken into
consideration when trying to find a stock of good value? I am new to this
thread, and would be interested in learning more about value investing in the
market environment we are now in. By the way, the stock is involved in the
financial sector. Is that a good sector to be involved in right now? If anyone
cares to respond, it would be appreciated.

JC-- Can I call ya Jim? I agree with your last post, absolutely.
Peter Lynch argued that one should invest in companies that pull
a consistant 15% ROE. Better than that, and every PhD in the world
borrows a few bucks and enters that market... chasing down profit
margins with increased competition... until the market collapses.
DRAM, strip malls, PC's, trucking, and on and on. Barriers to entry?

James: I've used a formula to relate price/book to ROE to value point for many
years. Sometimes it works. (not very effective with stocks that have very high
ROE compared to very low book. (e.g. software companies). For an example of how
it might go: if a company has a book of $10 and and an ROE of 10%, the question
is what is the fair value of the company given its current price?
Fair value (model will determine) is about $10, so you know you want to pay not
more than $10 for the stock. How about a stock with $10 book and 20% ROE? Well
you know you are willing to pay more for this stock... how much more? Model
might show fair value to be $20. How about crummy ROE of 6%? Well again, the
model will here show fair value of about $6 (if book is $10, so company might
be a buy at under $6. Of course as you point out, entering in point estimate
for ROE can be a dangerous assumption. ROE's do fluctuate. For low ROE's one
hopes management can do better, and for high ROE's one hope there is a
sustainability. Paul

<<ROE's do fluctuate>> I would not say that, because that would imply a little
more randomness than exists. ROEs tend to regress to the mean. 30% ROEs tend to
move in the direction of the average, as do 5% ROEs. Unless there is some long
term competitive advantage (or some long term competitive disadvantage). If
this is the case, then (except for some truly unique companies in Buffett's
portfolio) you would want to screen for LOW ROE, not high ROE.

I do like the Lynch point you cited. You could look for ROEs that are
reasonably high, but not high enough to attract everybody and their dog to
enter the industry.

And to answer the question of what I like now based on this logic - very
little, although there are some very cheap small caps out there. Many companies
with below average long term ROE selling at twice book value. Anything with
reasonably high profitability is in the stratosphere by any historical
standard. Cash looks just fine at this point, and I am trying to raise some.
Just trying to discipline myself to sell one dog for every winner.

William Jepsen: I'll just take a moment to respond to your earlier comment that
"To really make serious money on a stock, you have to work and sweat a bit to
find what everyone else does not know." That is not supported by data - as far
as I can tell. Based on what I've experienced and what I think I've seen, it's
not just so clear cut as you imply. The issue was discussed by value investors
in Bloomberg Personal Mag (May/June '97, p. 93). A statistical vs. company
specfic game someone called it. Ben Graham would have taken the statistical
approach (which of course is: obtaining only limited info about each of a bunch
of stocks that fit certain parameters). In my experience - I've always assumed
I have information that everyone else has, and I've never felt I made money
because I knew what others didn't. I mean I own several widely-held large caps
- how the heck could I know something others don't? For me - it's what one does
with the info that is readily available, not about having to get a leg up by
doing superior stock-specific research to get superior information and superior
returns. In other words I question whether superior stock research leads to
superior results. No studies I am aware of have shown this (finding out what
others do not know about a specific stock) as a recommended or necessary way to
invest long term.

Okay, I will give you some points: I'm not defining "serious money", so maybe
I've never actually made serious money by your definition; And maybe we are
different types of investors. ---Your method works for you... can't argue with
that -g-. Paul Senior

James: okay, let's talk about an example, say: HGGR

Now here's a stock - Haggar - that I've always thought was "cheap", and rightly
so - just a clothing company in a competitive business. In my mind this stock
is always showing up on value screens and always disappointing - it was a cheap
stock, is a cheap stock, and will continue to be a cheap stock -- ergo a pretty
lousy investment (and always a trap for guys like Hopkins). Well that has been
my impression over the past decade. But is that impression correct? Is there a
point where the price of the stock is below "true value"? Looking at some
numbers - five years from '92-'96 - the ROE has "fluctuated" from:
13.3
11.2
16.3
5.9
neg (in '96 and '97)

So here's how I look at it. I figure the mean ROE for this company is about 9
to 10%. (Average of the five numbers (assuming neg=0) is 9.3 and about 10.1 if
you toss out the high (16.3) and low (neg.) numbers.
Not really enough years for a good estimate or to see a trend, but it's
probably good enough. I'm surprised about 9 to 10%. I thought the ROE for this
company would be much lower.

By my formulas, and based on the stuff I posted earlier, I figure such an ROE
9-10% indicates that the company's fair value is about .9 to 1x book value.
Well, the book is $19+, so the company's fair value IMO is about 17-19.
Furthermore, the book has been growing, and in this '92-'96 period, the p/bv
has been above one (i.e. stock has sold somewhat above it's book value). Since,
the stock is about 13+ (vs. 17-19; psr first glance looks okay), I have to
conclude, the stock is indeed a bargain, and there is a good shot to make a
decent return here for the value investor AS THIS COMPANY'S MGMT MAKES this ROE
move up to the avg. ROE. Hopkins has actually picked a winner for value
investors? I have been wrong about the company and its stock? Geez, this ruins
my whole Sunday!

James, here's where we might agree:
Past performance is no guarantee.... etc. etc. As we discussed with my pick of
IGT which has high ROE -- there ain't no assurance it's gonna stay good. Samo
with HGGR - no indication ROE is going to get better. HGGR is having a bad time
of it now -- there is nothing that says they must or will return to a better
situation (higher ROE or higher stock price).

Here's where some of us might not agree:
If you set your screens for only high ROE's or "moderate" (15%??), you will
miss some opportunities to see some bargains in the stocks where ROE is low.
Yes, I screen for high ROE --just like everyone else (which in itself is not a
good sign), but for some types of analyses, all that is required about ROE is
that it be known and that it does not fluctuate so much that one is
uncomfortable in calculating an average over a reasonable time frame. Okay,
gotta go. Too sunny out to be in.... Paul

PS-- Article of interest>>>>>>>>>>'Nifty Fifty' stocks give valuable lesson

NEW YORK - Jeremy Siegel, author of the influential 1994 book Stocks for the
Long Run and
professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, says he
worries that people will
think his work justifies buying stocks at any price. He may not worry enough.

Siegel is your man if you're fretting about buying Coca-Cola at 43 times
expected 1997 earnings.
He's your man if you're worried about paying historically high price-earnings
ratios (P-Es) for other
giant companies, now popularly perceived as multinational growth companies. And
since those
issues weigh heavily in Standard & Poor's 500 index, Siegel can make you feel
better about buying
an index fund with the market at record valuations.

Two years ago Siegel followed his book with a paper published in the Journal of
Portfolio
Management. He argued that the long-maligned buyers of "Nifty-Fifty" stocks in
the early '70s
had been proven right. The companies were so golden that they would always be
good
investments. The prices investors paid, 42 times earnings for the group at the
market peak in
December 1972, have been justified over time as fair, he concluded. The Nifty
Fifty included
Philip Morris, Disney, Merck and, yes, Coca-Cola.

The study "means the old maxim of don't pay more than 20 or 25 times earnings
of an established
growth company doesn't necessarily have any validity," Siegel says. "Many
growth companies are
worth many more times than that."

Challenging market legends

He delights in debunking an argument made in 1940 by Benjamin Graham, father of
modern
security analysis and learned master for Warren Buffett. In his article, Siegel
put up and then
knocked this line from Graham and colleague David Dodd: "People who habitually
purchase
common stocks at more than about 20 times their average earnings are likely to
lose money in the
long run."

Siegel found that if you had invested in the Nifty Fifty at their 1972 peak and
held the issues
through May 1995, your annualized return would have been 10.97%, just shy of
the 11.23% of
the entire market. Siegel says he's updated the performance through December
1996 and the
results are essentially the same: Nifty Fifty investors hadn't been the
buy-high fools they appeared
to be for two decades.

Still holds true

Siegel says his findings are relevant even though the Dow Jones industrials are
up 75% since May
1995, when he prepared the paper, and even though Coca-Cola's P-E on trailing
earnings has
gone from 27 to 47. "We haven't reached the peak of the market and we haven't
reached the peak
of growth stocks," says Siegel.

Siegel draws support from the stock performance of Coca-Cola. In December 1972,
it traded at
a P-E of 46, but was really worth 87 times earnings, he says. Assuming you paid
87 times earnings
then and held Coke until this past December, you would have gotten the same
return, dividends
included, as from the market as a whole.

The problem is that if you buy high P-E stocks now, you should probably cross
your fingers for
good luck. If this proves to be a peak in the market, you may have to wait 10,
15 or 20 years for
the next peak to justify the price you paid. The long run may be painful even
if you get to declare
its end on a date that redeems your sin.

Siegel concedes that the market's climb has corrected all of the undervaluation
that afflicted the
market in the '70s and early '80s. "We're moving into territory above the
normal valuation levels,"
he says. But Siegel says it is not time to sell high P-E growth stocks.

Lulled by success?

Perhaps he's been so blessed by the bull market's endorsement of his book and
paper that he's
blind to its excess. Siegel says he has enjoyed a fair amount of fame lately.
His book has sold
80,000 copies, stunning for an academic text given no popular marketing.
"Obviously, we can't
deny the reinforcement of events, and events have certainly been very, very
kind to the theory," he
says.

But "stocks are not buys at any price," he says. "There can be prices where
they are too high and
will give you worse performance than alternative financial instruments."

William,

Thanks for the interesting post. A conundrum that has
dogged me has been, "Should I really be planning for
20 or 25 years from now?." In one sense yes, if I want
to retire comfortably. In another sense, it just doesn't
make sense to count on something lasting 25 years. People
die (maybe even me, countries disappear,etc. This issue
also relates to my dilemma -- when to sell? We'll never
get rich if we sell all of our 50% gainers, but what if that
gain is within a month or two? Back in January and Feb I
was pretty paranoid and inquired as to how to use value investing
to short stocks. A more relevant question is how does a
value investor know when to sell a stock? Should we go
with Buffett, or should we say, hey the last 50 years
have been a great market and we shouldn't count on that
for another 50 years?

Just my thoughts. The Nifty Fifty are currently
extremely relevant IMO,especially the 10 year drought
that followed.

Good Investing,
Mike

up. At times, 1 hour is long term to me, other times I will wait years. It
seems to be more art, or gut, than science. I use a lot of technical stuff, but
in the end, it is who you are who decides to buy, sell, or do nothing. I just
go by my years of doing this, mostly in micro and small caps, and have done
very well at it, enough so that this is all I do.

When to sell. That has been my problem too. I've sold my winners way too early,
gave up on future winners after a month or two, but held all my losers
religiously. ("If I liked it at 7, I've got to buy more at 4") Admitting your
weakness is the first step. Buying is not my weakness. If I had held all the
stocks I bought I'd be much better off now.

I've come to a system of categorizing investments:
1. Asset plays. For example, I bought St. Joe Corp at $65 because it owned real
estate worth $100 and there was a catalyst. It kicked out a $10 dividend, so
adjust everything back $10. Its now at $84 ($94 pre dividend) so its close to
my target. So I revisited my analysis and decided to take some profits. I held
onto most of my investment, but sold some just because its no longer a
no-brainer. In an asset play you don't expect the assets to appreciate
(although in St. Joe's case that has changed), you just want to get to that
value and get out.

2. Quickies. You buy a dog for $10 expecting its worth $20, but also expecting
to wait years to get there. You get lucky and it goes to 15 a month after you
bought it on takeover speculation. I'd take the profit.

3. Long term holds. I have three or four stocks which I tell myself every night
not to sell no matter what. I tell my wife to punch me if I sell them. These
are companies with strong franchises, in the kind of business which I can count
on ten years from now, and which I bought at a cheap price. For example,
General Mills or Clayton Homes, both still value investments. The capital gains
tax makes it even more compelling to hold these. For example, if you took a
long term hold from $30 to $70, and its looking a little overpriced, you've got
to think of the capital gains tax. On a $40 capital gain, you will pay tax of
about $11 a share. So you're not actually selling it for $70, you're selling it
for $59. When you look at it that way, it usually makes more sense to hang onto
it even if it may be ahead of itself. The key here is its a business that you
think is worth $60 now, and are pretty confident will be worth 12% more next
year, 12% more the year after that, etc. These are few and far between. Read
your Buffett.

My problem is how to know when to sell a loser. My instinct is usually to buy
more. Any advice there would be greatly appreciated.

When compared to book value hggr does appear to be a bargain however should not
a true value investor be concerned with the steps that management ought to take
to expose that value? Has there been a reorganization of top management? Stock
repurchase? A change in competitive environment?

My questions are not just isolated to hggr but also apply to the theory of
value investing. Is investing in potential turn arounds/unrecognized companies
still considered value investing and, if so, what are the signs (positive and
negative) to watch for as a company makes the transition?

This is an excellent thread and has been very educational for me as a beginning

She is doing some revamping of sorts, and turning a corner on how

We meet again. Just found this thread. Been looking for value discussion and

Last week I bought a stock selling below BV and EPS last 4 Q @ 3.5. Had been
earning .45-.55 per Q, then had a 7 cent loss - one time charges from an
acquisition - and price dropped 50%. Last Monday I see that CEO has purchased
40,000 shares in house - the options of a V.P.- giving him 30% of dilution. Co.
only has 1.2M dilution and 550k float, so he has almost doubled his position.

How much weight should I put on this info. Is this a buy indicator. Company is
expanding. Stock only slightly above my initial buy. I picked up a few more
shares. Don't know whether to go for more or not.

A lot of what you wrote looks good. Have you checked to see what the earnings
would have been with the charge subtracted out? If earnings were still on track
minus the charge then the market clearly over-reacted. Below book value is
probably good but why? Young start-up or has it been maligned in the past and
is stigmatized?
The insider buying is never a bad thing but would still like more information.
It is good that the company is expanding but what is driving the expansion? How
are they financing it? If the acquisitions are accretive to earnings then I
would be very interested; if they are issuing additional debt...

Frankly I wouldn't base a decision on just the information you've provided but

You didn't tell me what you think about the CEO purchase. Do I jump heavy or

O.K. I'll pay. It's NATS. Small brokerage firm, growing. I now own enough.
Would have to sell something to buy more and don't want to.

Stock now at 6.00. BV is 6.25. It had $2.24 EPS last year and IMO should hit at
least $1.68 this year. With acquisitions (two now) it should do even better.
Might be a bummer. I like it but am too conservative to do too much. If it gets
to .60 or so Q earnings, can run to 20 or better. Paid dividends in stock.
Check out SEC filings and let me know what you think. Only 500K float so
trading is low.

Thanks for the idea. I've been so busy lately, ideas are

Larry,

I am only asking this thread if the Insider Buy indicates strength, not hyping
a stock. I don't care if anyone else is interested or not. This is why I
initially didn't name the company and only did so because I was asked. Could I
refuse?

The first thing I do when considering a stock is review all news about the
company over the past year, including Press Releases from law firms filing a
suit. I then review SEC filings for two years, then review management resumes.
If I'm not satisfied, I call the company. If I don't get a satisfactory answer,
pass. I called, then bought.

Again, I am not hyping this stock. I make my own decisions and expect others to
do the same. I just want opinions on Insider Buys.

Ron
PS - One tactic used by lawyers to get an out of court settlement is to issue
Press Releases that will damage the company's reputation.

P,

After a quick review, I sure do understand your situation on WHX. I'd say the
government has been ignoring this one when they talk about how great things are
going. Union strike for 8 months, unfriendly NLRB and judges, EPA on their
back, etc. etc. Lose $4+ and still have a BV of $28 on their $8.00 price. Kind
of reminds me of Chrysler years ago, then again it also reminds me of Fruehauf
or International. Ruins one's faith in value investing.

Hold is what the analysts are saying and it sounds right for long term- then
again, there's too many good places to put one's money in this market. I can't
see it going down any further, but who would have thought it would be this low.
Funds have bailed because of short term prospects.

My read between the lines is that management has somewhat given up. If the
future holds more losses over long term, I think I'd dump and look for
something with a better future. IMO it will take profits for price to move and
I don't see any in the short term.

I know you have likely made these same arguments to yourself. Just responding
with my 2 cents and my advice is seldom worth that.

Edokeefe: re RACC. As could be expected, div. eliminated. At price in low 4's,
then RACC needs to earn only the skipped div of .36 to have a pe of 12. Stock
is slipping away from me - price is going up -as I keep thinking about Co. Co
with a lot of problems - Big 'uns (they are gonna cut revenue 30%, for
example). Still... much is already reflected in the price. And some positives:
new CEO, book of 7 (I figure take $2 off the current $9 because of 22m
reserve), business still on the books, general industry problem (too quick to
loan or too many customers skipping)- an out-of-favor business.
It's a stock which leaves me with the impression it could go to zero

I also have a full position and won't purchase more. It is down from where I

based, in part, on expenses of consolidating the investment bank acquisition.
It appeared to me mgmt threw everything but the kitchen sink into the charges.
IMO reason for recent drop. As indicated above, insiders own half the stock.

Its price is fairly volitile 4.75<6.25<9.75 in last 220 trading days -
technically it just nudged above 50 day emva and is holding just above it. My
technical indicators have it on a sell.

Will be interested to see what happens next few quarters. Big question is
whether it can resume earnings growth at anywhere near historical levels (5

I also think it's a dog, but my AAII Stock Investor shows cash at $8.15 per

Per Peter Lynch approaches, I'd wonder how much of the $25 is really for real

The cash/share is much more than $8.15--it sits
at well over $400M if one includes short term instruments,
but they also have substantial pension liability,
and its debt was downgraded by S&P after the
Dynamics offer. An interesting stock that tests
one's value investing mettle, both the patience
part and the analysis part. Even if one is not
invested, it is an interesting story to watch.
A dog to some, a 40% gainer for others. If nothing

I gave the Net Cash/Share computed as Last Qtr (Cash-LT Debt) / # shares. As of
year end, AAII has these as (482.6-268.2)/26.3 = 8.15. You are undoubtedly
right, but i'm not about to try to figure out their finances in detail.

Value Line sort of shares your view: highlights from Value Line CD:
- they rate it a 4,5 (next to worst timeliness, worst safety)
- Strike has idled 80% of capacity
- Value Line expects the strike to continue thru 1997
+ vl expects the 400M + cash position to see them thru
+ Once strike is over, vl expects topline growth to resume with higher margin
products
+ They estimate (high for them) 18-37% Annl Total Return 3-5 years
- Should only be purchased by "risk tolerant" investors (10% earnings
predictability).

James,

WHX - Just my thoughts.
1. There are many uncertain aspects to the company. The strike, the new EPA
standards, the BV, and the company's ability to profit. I agree that value is
worth more than the per share price, but it may or may not be worth the full
$28. Very often it costs as more to close an operation than its value and the
company has to pay someone to take it. The land has major value, but some of
the buildings, equipment, and other may be nothing but scrap or trash.

2. I wouldn't gamble on this stock providing a 25-30% return in six months
because I feel it a gamble. It could sit at the $8 level for a very long time
and it could fall. If the strike is resolved, there would likely be some upward
movement, but IMO the funds would have to see profits to get in and it will
take that money to cause any major move. There are too many stocks out there
that will provide that 25-30% with less risk.

3. The U.S. steel industry has major problems and don't feel comfortable
investing in the industry.

Not trashing, just giving MO.

Ron Bower: re finance stocks.

Well, I guess the big risks would be interest rate risks and business risks
(competition) and the general market risk. Somewhat offsetting those might be
small-cap - presumably out-of-favor area, so perhaps low price buy-in points;
and alleged positive future of the finance business as people save more, invest
more, Perhaps we are seeing globalization of industry with recent high-profile
brokerage buyouts. Also, perhaps positive (perhaps not) would be consolidation
of the industry and repeal of Glass Stegal (sic) which would allow combinations
of banking and investing/brokerage firms.

I have not come across any brokerage stocks I like now - but I've also not
looked at the sector in detail either. I like the mutual fund managment arena
better, and I've purchased some of the stocks posters have mentioned on this
thread. And I've also missed a few - Alliance Capital (mentioned here a couple
of times), Kansas City Southern, Marsh.

As you say, the finance sector is growing and doing well, but prices also seem
to reflect that. Still, there are the occasional opportunities. I can't tell
from your posts, but you seem to be somewhat of a top-down investor (find the
good sector, then the best stocks within that sector). That certainly has been
a very good (profitable) way to get into brokerage,investment, finance
co,mortgage co. -- even banks and insurance -- over the past few years.

I beleave the attemt to buy DYA was the first step in getting CTS.
This deal, from what I read isn't dead yet. WHX is still weighing options on
it. DYA realy isn't that much of a company except for the fact that they own
over 40% of CTS. Check out the financials on the two, my own calcs figure the
deal would add around $1.00 EPS to WHX within 2 years if it can be done. The
nice part of this is they have the cash to make it happend.

When the strike ends (it will some day) The price should rebound to the 11.00

Ron, I agree with you (WHX) on two of your three points. The steel industry is
an awful long term investment. Industry fundamentals are among the worst. And I
agree there is a ton of uncertainty about WHX.

BUT...you are on a value investing thread, so the relevant question is this. Is
it in the price or isn't it. At 30% of book value (I bought at 20%) I think the
market has overreacted a wee bit. If you believe the strike will never settle,
don't buy this stock. But if you are willing to be patient for a year, it is a
steal. This is not one for the retirement account long term - it is for a very
big short term gain.

One of my favorite things to say about this kind of investment (and I will
clean up the way I usually say it) is this - I will buy dog "excrement" if I
can buy it for half the going rate for dog "excrement". That is my philosophy

James,

Those on this list seem to have different opinions of 'Value Investing'. I seem
to be far more conservative.

I consider 90% of the stocks I own to be 'value stocks'. (I keep about 10% in
'penny' stocks that I feel have potential for high return, but could also see
bankruptcy. 800% gain versus total loss.)

My value stocks all have similar features. With most, my position is good ratio
BV weighed against EPS. Most are strong on cash with minimal debt, pay
dividends, and will grow 20-300% in the next year.

WHX is a company I would normally give strong consideration. A profitable
company disrupted by a short term incident. Exactly what I normally look for,
except - I avoid unionized companies and companies that could have
environmental problems. I also feel the potential gain not worth the risk, but
this is likely because I have more confidence in other sectors.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but my portfolio growth indicates I should continue to do
just as I have been.

Marlton Technologies (AMEX:MTY) is a financially strong and rapidly
growing Company, which has just announced a key acquisition which
could accelerate its growth and carry it to $100 million in revenues by
1998.

The Napeague Letter has been following Marlton for almost a year. Its
latest in-depth analysis of the Company can be found at
http://www.napeague.com .

With 38% revenue growth and 55% operating profit growth in the first
quarter of 1997, on top of record revenue and earnings growth in 1996,
MTY has been on a rapid growth track for several years, yet its stock is
still extremely undervalued by the market. While the Business
Services segment currently has a PE multiple of 31, MTY is at a PE of
14 although its profits are growing three times as rapidly as those of the
segment as a whole.

On Thursday, June 26th MTY announced its planned acquisition of
DMS Store Fixtures, one of the larger companies in this segment. The
Napeague Letter has carried out a preliminary Analysis of this deal
which indicates that it may be quite beneficial to MTY shareholders.
This Analysis can be found on the Napeague Web Site, at
http://www.napeague.com .

These two businesses are quite similar in many ways and should lead to
a strong partnership. They both use similar technologies and skill bases,
and many of their products are quite similar. DMS could provide MTY
with entry into an industry with strong growth opportunities, and MTY
can provide DMS with greater geographic distribution.

Regarding your repeated comment "extremely undervalued by the market".
Well, IMO, at 13.6% ROE, 1.33x book, pe of 12, psr of .52 -- the stock is not
much different from hundreds of others out there --doesn't look so undervalued
to me.

Here's what I see. A tiny lil' co. - 19M in market cap. They put on trade shows
essentially. Company has really grown - both revenues and apparently now there
are acquisitions. Maybe they are in "Business Services segment" with a pe
multiple of "31" and maybe they can increase their sales as rapidly in the
future as in the past and get their pe up. I'd like to see that --- double
triple quadruple the number of trade shows and other events -- there's just not
enough stuff out there now to get us all out of our offices -g-. Or perhaps all
our supervisors are just waiting to approve the time and $ to attend from a
selection of twice as many (if growth of market were 24% every year for next 3
years).

IMO, to invest in this stock, you've got to know the company or know Bob Davis.
No question your report is most comprehensive and your knowledge excellent.
Plus you've been right --
the stock has gone up!:>).

Maybe you'll continue to be right on. Howsomeever... fixated as I am, I see

Price/Book value ratio looks crazy on UCAR, but don't let that throw you off. A
couple quarters ago book value was negative. That is due solely to the fact
that when UCAR was spun out of Union Carbide, the former parent laid a huge
chunk of debt on the spinoff. Look at cash flow and earnings on this one, and
just ask yourself whether you believe the high return on capital is

Paul,

A fair response...but that's why they hold horse-races....

There is one point that I'd like to clear up - in your response you imply that
I only post about MTY, which further implies that I am vigorously touting only
one stock. However, The Napeague Letter follows a number of stocks, as you will
see if you visit its Web Site at http://www.napeague.com . At the moment I have
relatively positive feelings about MTY, but a review of the stocks followed
will show you that TNL can and does react to negative information (see CLZR...)

You made a very good point in your response - "IMO, to invest in this stock,
you've got to know the company or know Bob Davis." Well, the intent of The
Napeague Letter is to help its readers get to "know the company". It does this
by going beyond the superficial "analysis" offered by many investment services,
with their dependence upon simplistic ratios, and digs into the Company itself
through its SEC filings, industry and competitor studies, meetings with company
management, and on occasion, primary research. Hopefully, the resulting
Analysis will help you "to know the company".

I'm not sure that you can "know Bob Davis" through The Napeague Letter, but I
do provide a somewhat verifiable biography on the Web Site, and readers have
commented on the quirky insights into my psyche which can be gleaned from my
writing.

Does anyone have an opinion on this proposed addition to the Russel 3000?
I recently wrote a summary and, as you can tell, am rather bullish on the
Company. Thanks in advance

Valence Technology is making the transition from R&D to commercial production
of Lithium-ion, solid polymer rechargeable batteries for cellphones and laptop
computers. A Valence board member and its CEO worked together during Seagate's
first 7 years as CEO and director of operations.

Several laptop mfrs are now offering Li-ion batteries in their high end models
or as an approx $200 adder because they will store about twice the energy as
Nickel metal hydride. Currently, these batteries are configured as
series-parallel combinations of liquid-electrolyte LiIon cells enclosed in a
battery pack. According to a study by Compaq, about 25% more energy storage can
be gained with the solid polymer version(Valence appears to be the first
large-scale source) because the cells are rectangular (prismatic) in shape and
do not require a metal can to contain the electrolyte.

The company's first production line(low speed, multiproduct new design) is now
producing cellphone cells being inventoried and being held for testing. It is
likely that they will convert this line to the larger laptop cells (4"x4"
footprint) that store about 4 times the energy as the smaller cellphone cells.

Their 2nd line(high speed), thoroughly tested at another location, will be
bolted to the plant floor in Northern Ireland next week and is already set up
for the smaller cellphone cells and expected to be in full production around
Sept 1. It is my understanding that Motorola has been patiently waiting for the
product.

Their 3rd line(identical, high speed but likely intended for laptop cells) is
expected to be in production by yearend. It is my understanding that Hewlett
Packard has introduced a new laptop model with the capability of "hot swapping"
an auxiliary battery pack with a cd-rom or floppy. The companies have an
associative history and it is believed that the new design is for Valence's
battery.

Their 4th line(also high speed, identical) is expected to be in production by
February/March '98.

The Ireland plant has room for 10 lines and it is planned to add 1
line/quarter. The market is such that they should be able to sell all they can
produce for several years. The company has some joint ventures in place that
require zero cash outlay but pay Valence 50% of the profits as a payback for
all their R&D.

Their first 4 production lines combined appear to have the capability of
earning about $6 per share if run at full capacity. The stock, presently
trading at around $8, has a tremendous upside potential($6 x a PE of 20 =
$120/sh). They will likely ramp up a little more slowly but there is a
consensus that $25/sh by yearend is likely.

There is a dearth of information about the company through normal channels
because they have been maintaining a very low profile - there was a lawsuit
based on their having to back out of a $100 million contract with Motorola
about 4 1/2 years ago when stock price was in the high 20's. With their
previous technology, some of the cells would eventually short after many
recharge cycles because of a plating-out effect of lithium metal. They have
been a long time in R&D since and their new technology prevents this from
recurring.

Ron: Re IPT - i looked at a while ago and decided not to play. In these cases I
try to determine liquidation value. If I read the situation correctly (their
setup is really strange) the fair price to BREAK EVEN in 2 1/2 years is about:
2 1/2 years of dividends @ $2/yr and $3.51 (as of 12/31/96) residual or about
$8.51.
I think it's probably taxable (can't tell since they send you special tax forms
at end of year), and so @28% rate .68 * 8.51 = $5.78. Again, to break even not
counting commissions, time value of money, etc.

To quote their SEC filings:
Less than three years remain in the Initial Term of the Partnership. Because of
this, and due to the decrease in their share of earnings from 95% to 4% when
the Initial Term of the Partnership expires, Class A unitholders should expect
the market price of Class A Units to begin to decrease well before December 31,
1999.
-------------------------------

Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how it is possible to make money
on this. The company is telling you so above! The past performance numbers look
good, but they are history and bear no resemblance to the future - not with
their setup. IMHO, maybe the yield is holding the stock up - if they pay $2
this year (same as last) and you got it at $10 then it's approaching 20% yield.

Also, the one analyst reporting on the company thru Zack's rate it a 5 - the
worst (like in sell short) as seen at:
http://quote.yahoo.com/quotes?symbols=ipt&detailed=r

My opinion only based on quick look.

Price:Book Value: .95 (low since '91)

PSR: .37 (low since '91 about .33)

ROE: 11% (range 4.1-28.8%)

Stock has sold for over 14 every year since '92. If they can get ROE back up to
14-18%, stock could go to 14-18 IMO. Co purchased shares at 13.

A small cap (62M), ala MTY, but I like DRKN fundamentals better. I have same

Yeah, I knew I was asking for it. BV is obviously book value, I don't know what

on a manager because I don't have the experience, the time and the resources to
do all my own research to the same extent as a professional does. I never would
have found MAF Bancorp on my own, but it's up 60% over the last 9 months. I
think there's something to be said for engaging a professional, especially for
someone like me, who is still learning "the language of the game". Clearly you

Mike: Re LSVI

Did you hear that Duty Free Intl getting bought out? Maybe some idea of take
over value, since maybe in similar business. Using AAII Stock Investor data and
CNBC valuation of buyout at 678M, I figure this is 678/547 = 1.24 times last 12
month's revenue or, for LSVI 1.24 * 84.3 / 8.5M shares = 12.30/share.

AAII has it in industry 0963 (Retail (specialty non-apparel)) with industry PEG
at .5 as opposed to the .98 you indicated (that's their broad sevices (09)
sector = 1). As you indicated other valuations are undervalued, like PE,
Price/Book, Price/Cashflow at around 1/2 of the industry average.

I did a NAIC SSG on it and using eps growth rate of 10% (from zacks), I got
current price: 6
5 year average pe range 26.5 - 13.1
current pe based on last 12 months eps 9.8
pe base on next 12 months projected eps: 8.9
upside/downside 5.7
Project 5 year total return 28.1
Zoning 3.5<Buy<9.2

That looks very good.

Big, very obvious concern is the negative growth in earnings (-13) over last 5
years. S&P Data has:
year eps
1991 .78
1992 .62
1993 .49
1994 .44
1995 .11

Note that Zack's earnings momentum rates it a 4 (mild sell) (not the analysts
ratings) and I'm not enamored of the 10% projected 5 year growth by a single
analyst.

I'll think I'll wait to see more the positive results of the turnaround in EPS.
Or maybe after a hurricane (see below) price down around 4.

re: Weather. I subscribe to a cassette based investment service Investors
Hotline, and occasionally they have on weather experts - like, i believe,
people who do projections for futures trading. My impression it that for the
next few years that we are due for more volitile weather, rather than unusually
mild weather in the 70's and 80's. Volcano's or some such. Could be big factor.

What's with Alaska? Are their exec's frostbitten and sunburned <g>?

I sold 15% of my portfolio in the last two weeks, and just mapped out prices to
sell another 30%. I figure cash (or maybe a Z3 Roadster) is a better investment
for the next five years than stocks. Anything I look at I think, yeah, it might
look cheap relative to the market, but I have no doubt I'll be able to get it
cheaper sometime in the next couple years. My point is this. The market is
insane on a historical basis. Whether you're looking for a 10% correction, or
the mother of all "corrections" (30% sounds good to me), our attention as value
investors should be on selling, not buying.

Heres my case for a major drop.
1) Overvaluation on a historical basis. I have said for the last 5 years I
would sell most of what I own when the P/E of the index hit 20. It did a month
ago.
2) Total complacency. Even value investors have thrown in the towel and bought
because they are scared to death of underperforming the index. I'm talking
institutional money. I know what I'm talking about - I work for a value
manager. Even value managers are in the "Nifty-Fifty" stocks and are scared to
hold cash. If the market were to drop 20%, these would be your natural buyers.
BUT THEY HAVE NO CASH. There would seem to be no floor if something goes wrong.
3) The market valuation is based on the best of all possible worlds. Low
inflation, booming economy, money flowing into stocks. If anything negative
happens, KABOOM.

While Mike did not set up this site to be a debate on the market's ups and
downs, (and I do not want it to become such because so much of that is a waste
of time) will anybody fight me on this. This isn't just hot air, I am in the
middle of selling half of my portfolio right now.

I'm not saying this is the top. All I am saying is that the bottom is somewhere
south of here. Therefore cash is a great investment if you are willing to buy
when everybody else is panicking.

James,

I have to agree with most everything you've stated about the market being
overvalued and fragile. Not only is there little cash, there's major margin
positions.

However, I disagree that one should be converting to cash at this point. Many
small caps and certain sectors are undervalued. They might not be showing
30-40% growth, but well managed companies priced around BV, minimal debt, good
cash position, and solid earnings.

An example is Methode Electronics. Hasn't kept pace with the market and a good
long term buy at todays price. (I've owned for years)

I have been almost all in small caps for a year, because, as you said, thats

Coca Cola. Amazing, but you know its true. Not that I think thats logical, but
I know its going to happen when the big bang hits.

Lets just think, why do I want to be 40% in cash? Its not just to drop 40% less
than the market when the big one comes. Its to be able to buy on a dime when it
happens. If I am in a bunch of undervalued small caps (I grant you the're out

Hi Mike - After combing the Barrons roundtable recommendations from last week,
Chicago Bridge and Iron (CBI) recommended by Oscar Schafer has gotten my

nice since it reduces the effective tax rate. They are growing internationally
at a projected rate of 15%. To assure this, stock options for the big shots
doesn't kick in until they earn $6.25/sh cumulatively over 3 years. They
design, fabricate and erect steel tanks and plates for petroleum and chemical
companies. PSR = 0.41. The projected PE = 12. No trailing PE because they just
spun off. Zacks shows 4 Strong buys and 1 moderate buy recommendation.

Alan,

I bought FRDM at 14, because it was too cheap by any measure.
When it hit 17, I felt it was approaching a fair value for
a company with mediocre growth, but held on because the growth story was not
mediocre but strong. It reached 23, and I sold half, feeling that it was
getting ahead of itself. Then the earnings news came
out and I entered a market sell (17 3/8) for the remaining half. Why?

Because the falloff in the revenues from their credit operations
is likely reflective of a broader trend in the economy -- people
are reaching their credit limits. It shows in the growing
credit card delinquincies and it makes sense that it would show
in the bottom line of those companies that finance the purchase
of their products in-house. Other jeweler stocks may be at risk
here. My net avg exit price was 20 1/8, and I consider myself
lucky. At its current 16, I'm sitting on the sidelines. At 11-12,
I'd be buying again.

James,

After I made my post about being fully invested, I realized that you are taking
a position I took about three weeks ago when I took profits and built cash.
Then I began seeking new buys in other sectors. I now am fully invested in new
positions and waiting for earnings reports, yet reviewing daily towards
selling.

I pay very little attention to market trends because the holdings I normally
have aren't effected. If one buys on value and sells on overvalue, the market
trends will have little effect. Each stock must be looked at individually. I've
moved out of the techs, oil & gas, and all manufacturing except for two - one
in China and the other in Mexico. Most of my money is now in financial sector
because of the profits, earnings, and acquisitions. (Largest holding is SWST
bought 3 weeks ago at 15.75.)

MO - Value investing means not worrying about market trends.

Ron
PS - I've found two stocks of interest I likely would buy but can't so I'll
throw them out for consideration - IOMT and BOTX. IOMT is a watch because it
should show weakness from an estate selloff. I just feel BOTX undervalued.

You are right. QNTM, WDC and SEG not very bloody, yet.

Its current price is ~ $22 to $23. Its 1997's estimated EPS is $4.49.
It is a $545 million market cap company, trades at a 64% discount
PE multiple of 5.1 X, vs. the 14.3 X average multiple at
which the computer peripherals industry is priced.

Briefing.com also recommended this stock:

"In our Brief a few weeks ago we noted that bearish momentum
could carry APM lower over the near-term, especially on a break
of key support at 30. Meanwhile, we liked the stock's long-term
potential for significant capital appreciation based on deeply
discounted valuations and strong growth prospects over the next
few years. Since our report, the stock as well asthe group has
come under heavy selling on investor fears of growing pricing
pressures. However, in our conversation with the company's CEO
we came away convinced that the market's fears are exaggerated.
While the supply shortages which kept prices abnormally stable
over the past couple of quarters have given way to a leveling
off between supply and demand, neither APM nor the industry is
experiencing excess supply. To the contrary, strong growth in
the PC market should continue to drive impressive revenue and
earnings growth. Briefing remains optimistic over Applied
Magnetic's long-term prospects. Given the stock's better than
market growth projections and its relative p/e of 0.32, we
expect APM to stage a complete recovery over the next 9- to
12-months. (Rev: 06/03)"
