Yes, This_is_the_end, there’s been a nice recent upward move in ALJ’s price.
Getting rid of excessive debt that may not be working for the overall benefit
of a company is, in my opinion, a wise move by a company’s management,
especially with ongoing interest rate increases in the USA.

I would suggest, though, that only one good financial ratio improvement doesn’t
always tell the whole story. I believe ALJ has other favourable financial
ratios within its Financial Statements that, coupled together with its improved
debt situation, has probably made ALJ more attractive to informed investors.

As we said previously, it will be interesting to see if everything "comes
together" when ALJ releases its next set of Financial Results.

Madharry. re: GROW. It's no value stock imo. Crossy, on his thread, makes the
argument that it is. I'm buying because the stock could be a growth stock.

On the one hand, I want to buy these companies when they appear as "values" to
me. CLMS is such now at current price.
OTOH, if someone just bought and held (a ltb&h) almost any of the companies in
the sector - certainly the big ones I'm looking at - they would've done well
(by my standards anyway) regardless of what they paid for their stocks:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=my&s=BEN&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=trow

The stocks in the sector appear to be at all time highs. If one believes
enough-is-enough and we're seeing a multiyear top//value if it exists offers no
margin of safety, etc., then the stocks (GROW included)are, imo an avoid.

GROW is small and growing assets faster than the bigger competitors. It's got
mutual funds in the natural resource arena, and those stocks and the fund are
booming. For me, GROW is one of those stocks that I'd rather be in and watch
for a couple or more quarters, than be out of.

By buying now I hope I am not just fooling myself into betting on the past
favorable trend in stock prices. But that is certainly possible.

Most mines are one trick ponies. I dont have all my money invested in SIL. I

Mines need foreign capital to be developed and mines equal jobs. I expect that
development will proceed on schedule. and it would not surprise me one bit if
they ended up with some long term contracts to sell their zinc. Two years ago
SIL sold at about a 33- 50% premium to SSRI and at a slight premium to Pan

American. and this was before zinc prices took off.

UPN, WB to Shut Down; New Network Formed
Wednesday January 25, 3:23 am ET
By David Bauder, AP Television Writer
UPN, WB to Shut Down; New Television Network Formed

http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/060125/tv_network.html?.v=2

NEW YORK (AP) -- UPN's "America's Next Top Model" and shows from The WB will
air on the same channel after the two struggling networks decided to combine
their assets under a new name.
The new network, the CW, will be a 50-50 venture between the CBS Corp., which
owns UPN, and Warner Bros. Entertainment, officials said Tuesday.

The new network, scheduled to begin airing this fall, will target an audience
aged 18 to 34, said Leslie Moonves, CBS president.

"They really, truly belong together," said Sharianne Brill, programming analyst
for Carat USA. "They were both targeting similar, niche audiences and they both
have some strong programming assets. There's only good from a business
standpoint. The only bad thing will be that people will lose their jobs."

The new network will draw on programming from both UPN, whose shows include
"Everybody Hates Chris" and "Veronica Mars," as well as from the slate of The
WB, which includes "Supernatural," "Smallville" and "Everwood."

"America's Next Top Model" is already guaranteed a berth at the CW, and it's
likely "Everybody Hates Chris" and "Girlfriends" will survive. UPN President
Dawn Ostroff offered few other details of what will or won't survive on the new
network.

Both networks had struggled to compete against larger rivals in the broadcast
TV business, including Walt Disney Co.'s ABC, General Electric Co.'s NBC, CBS
Corp.'s CBS and News Corp.'s Fox.

UPN and The WB began secretly working out the business plan -- so secret that
executives from both networks were outlining their fall programming plans to
television writers last week in Pasadena, Calif.

The WB had a few strong years when series like "Dawson's Creek" made it a hip
destination for young viewers, particularly teen-aged girls.

They reflected the strong programming hand of chief executive Jamie Kellner.
But since Kellner retired a few years ago, the WB has tried to broaden its
audience and, in the eyes of many critics, lost much of its identity in the
process.

This season, there were clear signs of financial struggle. The WB announced it
was canceling "7th Heaven," the family drama that was the network's most
successful show ever, because it would cost too much to continue production.

Instead of replacing shows that haven't worked, the WB has turned to the
cost-cutting move of airing repeats of its popular fare -- so much so that an
astounding 51 percent of what it has aired this season are reruns, according to
the ad buying firm Magna Global.

After many years of floundering, UPN has grown stronger under Ostroff in recent
years with critical hits such as "Veronica Mars" and "Everybody Hates Chris."

Alongside Ostroff, the CW's chief operating officer will be John Maatta, who
currently has the same job at the WB. Along with melding the programming
lineup, they'll be in charge of molding two companies into one.

The CW will air 30 hours of programming, seven days a week, following the model
of The WB. Six nights of prime time shows will air Monday through Friday from 8
to 10 p.m. and Sundays from 7 to 10 p.m. There will also be shows on weekday
and Sunday afternoons, and five hours of children's programs now known as the
"Kids' WB" on Saturday morning.

Where viewers will find the CW is a complicated business tangle. In markets
where CBS and Tribune Broadcasting already own WB or UPN stations -- making up
about half the country -- the CW will be on that channel. The new network
expects to complete affiliation agreements for most of the rest of the country
by September.

Barry Meyer, the head of Warner Bros., said the companies would operate more
efficiently as one, but he declined to say how much savings they expected to
get or how many jobs might be cut.

Hal Vogel, a longtime media analyst and author of a book on entertainment
industry economics, called the combination "inevitable," saying "these
companies were not making money for anybody."

"Chances are, in five years they may not exist at all, or it may be something
else, but right now it's better than going alone," Vogel said. "This makes
sense -- it's not a slam-dunk proposition, but it makes sense. Six networks was
too many."

Spek,

Thought you might be interested in this WSJ article. Several years ago I owned
CBS through Westinghouse. It's interesting to see how all the pieces of
Westinghouse are now being sold or spun off.

Now that CBS is back as a public company, it's attracting the interest of
value-oriented investors.

Viacom recently split into two companies, creating CBS (symbol CBS) and a new
Viacom (VIAB). The breakup reflected the frustration of Sumner Redstone,
Viacom's chairman and controlling holder, with Viacom's stock in recent years.

CBS trades near $27, with the more-liquid B shares bearing the symbol CBS.
"It's the cheapest large media stock, despite terrific assets, potential growth
engines and a superior management team," said Oscar Schafer, the head of O.S.S.
Capital, a New York investment firm, at the Barron's Roundtable this month. The
Roundtable brings together a dozen leading investment professionals each year.

Several Wall Street analysts, including Morgan Stanley's Rich Bilotti, have
recommended CBS. He values CBS at $33 a share.

CBS has valuable assets, including the CBS television network, a group of 39 TV
stations, CBS Radio, a large billboard business, Showtime and book publisher
Simon & Schuster. Wall Street has deemed CBS a slow-growth, "old-media" firm,
in contrast to the new Viacom, which has a group of cable networks including
MTV and Nickelodeon, as well as the Paramount movie studio.

CBS was an independent company until it merged with Viacom in 2000. The recent
breakup undid that deal, which didn't generate the synergistic benefits Mr.
Redstone anticipated. Investors cheered last week when CBS decided to merge its
UPN TV network with the WB network, owned by Time Warner (TWX) and Tribune
(TRB). UPN has been losing money, and CBS aims to turn a profit with the new
network, called CW.

CBS may not be a high-growth company, but it is paying a decent quarterly
dividend of 16 cents a share, for a yield of more than 2.3%. The dividend is
expected to rise in 2007. CBS trades for a moderate 15 times projected 2006
profits of $1.75 a share. The CBS brass, meanwhile, bridle at the no-growth
label. CBS's chief financial officer, Fred Reynolds, told investors last week
that the company aims to produce annual percentage growth in per-share earnings
in the "mid-to-high single digit range."

CBS isn't without challenges. It gets about 70% of revenue from advertising,
and so is vulnerable to a weakening economy and the migration of ads to the
Internet. The radio business is struggling, and the fragmenting of the TV
audience poses problems. On the plus side, CBS's billboard unit is growing
smartly, and the CBS network remains No. 1 in prime-time ratings. CBS is
generating ample free cash flow, which should support a higher dividend and
share repurchases in the coming years.

FYI I haven't sold a single share in EDVMF or edv.to. The difficulty of it
being such a big chunk of my investing portfolio is offset by the realization
that my reasons for investing in it in the first place have not changed. The
company still sells at I believe a discount in excess of 20%. Management has
shown in 2005 that they continue to execute, and as an investment its perfect
for people who like myself lack mining expertise but want to play the pro
commodity anti dollar play. I say this because I think your decision is later
but not too late. I added a little more ECA and KHDH.

well we are all suckers or all geniuses, time will tell

i added a little more MPW today as well, there appears to be a persistent
seller still from the original funding the company did to get started...frankly
i'm not sure why they would sell at this point, but perhaps that's their
charter (i.e. fund startups and then take their gain or loss whenever the stock
becomes publicly traded)

in any event, by year end the dividend should be at or close to .25 a
quarter...assuming no hiccups in between, it's hard to imagine this stock
anywhere near this price by then

another stock that i have bought lately, which seems like a solid income play
with some growth as well, is DMLP

it's a limited partnership, and as such, i wouldn't want to own it in a taxable
account, as i believe you would have to wait for and then file partnership
information with your tax return...it may not be that onerous, but i can do
without that extra burden

in any event, the company is set up as a limited partnership, and pays out all
of its income in quarterly distributions...however, unlike most partnerships
which have a declining underlying asset, DMLP earns royalties from gas and oil
production on its properties, and since exploration is continuing on those
properties, and production is increasing, the distributions are rising and seem
to have the potential to rise for at least the near to mid term future

they just paid a distribution of .806 for the last quarter, up from about .57
the previous quarter, so the growth is excellent

i figure just the distributions make this one pretty attractive, but it appears
to have growth potential as well

as always, JMHO

Recap: Back a few years ago, when I looked at the 12 month performance of
stocks mentioned here where several people said they bought the particular
stock, I found that when three people (not two) said they had bought the same
stock at about the same time, then that stock did okay in the subsequent 12
months. It wasn't a valid statistical test, there were fewer posters then, and
what I found to be "okay" might not be what others might consider so.

Nevertheless, we know that value investors approach stocks from different
viewpoints, and if it's ever possible that some value investors here believe a
stock is undervalued AND bet money on their opinion and publicly so state that,
then that's a good sign to me, because I take it to mean no matter how you look
at the particular stock, you'll see that it's undervalued. OTOH, if we ever
find a stock that a heck of a lot of us (more than 4?) say we are buying
because the stock's undervalued, maybe we buyers are in the consensus, and
maybe we're wrong. -g-

Decent revenue growth (+15%/a) but bottom line has been lacking, although the

leverage will kick in or somebody will acquire the business. The company is
debt free, marginally profitable and that trades at low P/S:

Bad earnings report from TYC tody. the stock is trading below 25$. Earnings
miss is mostly due to margin pressure across the board. However I do like the
high FCF numbers that TYC is generating. I plan on doubling my position with
the hope that the impending split into 3 mini-Tyco's will be good for
shareholders.

OUTLOOK

The company continues to expect full-year EPS from continuing operations
excluding special items of $1.85 to $1.92 per share. The company further
expects that 2006 free cash flow, excluding the cash impact of previously
disclosed legal items, will exceed net income excluding special items . In the
second quarter, the company expects to make cash payments of approximately $450
million for previously disclosed legal matters.

TYC = I have never been a big fan of Tyco because each of their units operates
in competitive markets without many barriers to entry. Yet the price/value
appears compelling. Here is the latest analyst conclusion from Morningstar:

"That said, we think the current mid-$20s stock price represents an extremely
compelling value. Aside from the underinvestment in health care, we think a
majority of the issues plaguing the company are fixable within the next few
quarters, putting the company back on track toward a 3%-4% growth rate and
midteens operating margins. And with $40 billion in sales, the enterprise is
fully capable of generating somewhere between $4 and $5 billion in free cash
flow annually. In fiscal 2004 it generated $4.4 billion (excluding
unsustainable working capital benefits), and in 2005 it threw off $4.6 billion.
This year, we estimate the number to be about $4.2 billion. If we capitalize
the average of $4.4 billion at 9% (a formula to derive the value of a constant
stream of cash), the resulting valuation is $49 billion, or almost $25 per
share. That means at current prices, the market either doesn't believe the cash
generating power is legitimate, or that it won't grow. We think both
assumptions are misguided. The company is solidly profitable, and even with its
current problems, Tyco grew 4.2% last quarter, 3% last year, and 5% in 2004. To
give into such extreme pessimism at these prices would be a mistake, in our
opinion."

Added a starter position to my drug stock portfolio in JnJ. JnJ is close to
it's 52 week low, has a reasonable PE of 19 and pays close to a 3% dividend. I
am also looking at adding LLY if it breaks $55 to the downside. They sell at a
comparable PE to JnJ and recently entered into a partnership with Amyln to
develop a new type 2 diabiates drub called byetta.

Both drug companies are selling at the low end of their multi year PE range so
by accumulating shares at these levels one may be in a position to sell at much
higher prices.

The new Medicare prescription plan provides many of the drug companies with a
windfall credit as they are no longer required to sell scripts at a discount to
the government funded program. This windfall was estimated to be over $10
billion which should now find its way directly to many of these large
pharmaceutical companies.

GOOG. Well, I'll consider it as well, blankmind. Not by Graham value criteria
of course, but there are other valuation methods that could be used, imo, and
some show that IF GOOG can sustain it's margins, it could/maybe/possibly/ be a
buy (imo). I have been looking recently at YHOO in the same vein.

I don't follow internet stocks closely, but it seems to me that there are three
or four big profitable companies that dominate (for now anyway). They are EBAY,
AMZN, YHOO, and GOOG. I bought a few shares of EBAY when that stock dropped out

- on Google - here’s why I think Google goes up about 50% in 2006 - from its
current $380 share price - Google’s income per share was $5.02 diluted for full
yr 2005 - vs. only $1.46 diluted in 2004 - revs went from $3.2 bill in '04 to
$6.1 billin '05

- if Google’s revs keep growing at 20%+ a quarter - & profit margins open up a
bit more - then Google can easily do $7 or $8/eps diluted in 2006 - and with an
80 p/e - which is sustainable as long as revs & profits are growing robustly -
the stock can reach $600+ in 2006

- of course - if microsoft or yahoo come out with a better search engine - then
I'm sure Goog's sales & stock price tank - so be careful on this one - good

GOOG - 20% growth/quarter equates into 100% growth annually. With a larger
revenue base (6.1B$) this become more and more difficult. 6.1B$ is already a
substantial amount of money and I would venture the guess that those growth
rates will slow down after 1 or at most 2 quarters. From that i would assume
that 200-250$ is a fair price for GOOG.

While I agree that GOOG could go up 50% in 2006 i can as easily see 200$ as
well. For GOOG to continue growing at the rapid clip, they need to get more
revenue sources beyond search. I kind of like the diversified YHOO model more,
as an investor and user. I am hooked on my YHOO homepage, email,news and i
often use their search (even though i think GOOG still has en edge) for
convenience. In short YHOO is much more important than GOOG for my internet
experience. Beyond search and GOOG earth, i do not find much I like about the
other GOOG services. Email is no better than the new YHOO mail, Froogle is
inferior to some specialized sites like NEXTAG and Pricegrabber and what else

impressive 50% or so - from $3.6 bill to $5.3 bill; but Goog grew about 90% -
$3.2 bill in '04 to $6.1 billin '05 - so on revenues - Google beats yahoo in
gross & growth

- on profits - yahoo made $1.9 bill in ’05 - for $1.28 diluted; vs. Goog earned
$1.5 bill for $5.02 diluted - at first glance - it appears yahoo is doing
better - but Goog’s earnings are growing much faster - Yahoo went from earning
$839.6 mill in ‘04 to $1.9 bill in ‘05 - but Goog went from $399.9 mill to $1.5
bill

- actually - on historical p/e’s - yahoo’s is a reasonable 27 - but Goog’s is
close to 76 -

- Based on the above numbers - they’re both making tons of $$’s - & have
excellent business models - yahoo’s p/e is much lower - Goog’s earnings &
revenues are outpacing yahoo’s - so I’m going w/ Google - as I think Google

"the market has totally over-reacted to the China site - lukewarm earnings -
etc... etc.. it may go down from here - but given their amazing search engine"

Actually there is a far superior search engine that was launched in China by
Blinkx which is owned by Autonomy

http://www.autonomy.com/content/Press/Archives/2005/1020a.html

Note the customers in left corner of website: SEC, FBI, etc.

This is one of the greatest value stocks ever. Market cap is less than 1
billion.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=AU.L&t=1y

Here's a brief summary:

Autonomy is a London based company specializing in knowledge management, an
industry growing as fast as the Internet itself. In short, this technology is
the next generation of the Internet. This is the “new Web.” This technology can
best be described as the world’s smartest search engine. Nothing like it exists
today. For years, it was impossible for anyone outside the government – and a
select group of corporations willing to test the technology – to get their
hands on this powerful new tool.

The recent London bombings were solved by Scotland Yard using Autonomy’s
technology bringing the terrorist cell to its knees in just 8 days.

Autonomy’s technology doesn’t just identify a piece of information, “but also…
understands what it’s about.” It is based upon artificial intelligence.

Attempting to determine the profit potential of an entirely new Internet may be
difficult– it’s in this arena – the search engine market – that Autonomy stands
to see the greatest potential for the future. Autonomy’s retrieval technology
has thus far NOT been available to the consumer. That is about to change. The
commercial version of Autonomy’s technology for the public just became
available with all research and development complete.

To date Autonomy’s technology has only been available to the corporate and
government organizations. Autonomy's customer base comprises more than 1,000
global companies and organizations including, among others, BAE Systems, Ford,
Ericsson, Shell, Nestle, AOL, BBC, Reuters, Hutchison 3G, Royal Sun Alliance,
Sun Microsystems, Philips, Boeing, Schneider Electric, Coca Cola,
GlaxoSmithKline, Citigroup, ABN AMRO, CIA, Deutsche Bank, Nomura, the New York
Stock Exchange, Daimler Chrysler, Kraft Foods, Lloyds TSB, the U.S. Department
of Homeland Security, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, NASA and the
U.S. Department of Energy. Strategic reseller and OEM partners include leading
companies such as BEA, Business Objects, Citrix, EDS, IBM Global Services,
Novell, Veritas, Vignette, Supportsoft and Sybase.

Close to 90% of Internet users visit sites like Google and Yahoo! every day.
Search engines now surpass email as the #1 Internet application.

And where the people go… so does the money…

Marketers spent more than $9 billion last year placing ads on search engines.
That’s supposed to double in 5 years – not just in the U.S., but all over the
world.

Google, with a market cap of $ 80 Billion (more than 160 times that of Autonomy
!! and a PE of approximately 82 which about twice that of Autonomy) last year
had 280,000 advertiser accounts in its system, and expects that number to reach
378,000 by the end of 2005… and more than 650,000 by 2008.

Autonomy can learn about a user's interests and then make changes to a user
profile as those interests change, without the intervention of the reader.
Unlike other attempts to deliver a personalized news feed, Autonomy monitors
what the reader actually does to determine what he is spending time on, not
what he says he does, resulting in a more targeted search.

First, it’s important to know: China is the place that every Internet company
in the world is trying to break into. For one, its sheer size gives companies
an unprecedented market to work in. Secondly, China boasts the fastest-growing
Internet population in the world.

They just announced a partnership with China Netcom – one of China’s biggest
telecom companies, with a customer base of 110 million people and 95% of the
market share in Northern China – the region that includes the nation’s capital,
Beijing.

If they do say so themselves.

Strong positive cash flow throughout 2005, generating $17.2 million of
operating cash flow in 2005 (2004: $5.4 million) 

Yet their cash position is down about 40% YOY from Dec 2004.

Like I said, I only did two minutes. That was enough to tell me the cash went
for acquisitions, I didn't bother to look up what they bought. The question is
what part of their growth is organic vs part of a rollup process. For me, I
know that it's going to be too complicated to figure out. Going further, IMO
any effort to figure it out will almost certainly involve judgments beyond the
scope of anything that could be called value investing.

So for me, it definitely screams "stay away!" And that's before we get to the
red flags of the promotional nature of the earnings release and the question of
what the full story is with that government receivable that they're so
confident they'll eventually collect in full.

better than a money market. if it goes to 50 I make about 10% over two months.

I bought 1/3 of my position and my next "Buy" target level is $55.00. What do
you think if LLY? It's getting close to my 1st "buy" level of $55.

I agree with you on the JnJ Guident purchase. They already have a very
effective stint product and those billions of $'s can do a lot of R&D and
marketing.

Any other drug companies on your radar list?

Don't follow the drugs too much - have some LT (very LT) B&H stocks (MRK, WYE,
ABT, SYK) with low basis which I pretty much "set and forget." JNJ just seemed
too good to pass up at this level - one of the absolute bluest of the blue
chips IMHO on sale. Of course, the sale price can get cheaper.

I can only substitute chemicals for drugs, I think DD is an opportunity at this
price.

I am actually watching YHOO myself as a potential buy candidate. I am guessing
around 30$ would be my entry point. I like them because many can't without YHOO
when navigating the internet. Their homepage, content, email etc. give users a
reason to stick around and i believe they are much less risky than GOOG which
right now is only based on search.

Today i added to JNJ, a much more straightforward value stock.

And JNJ gets $800 million from BSX via GDT break up fee. Not bad for "losing"
this deal, even acknowledging that some of the $$$ will be used to pay lawyers,
I bankers, etc., in the pursuit of GDT.

Glad you mentioned it. I'm going to put an alert on my system for break of 70.
It seems like an excellent buy now, it would be even better sub 70.

Like JNJ, an excellent high quality blue chip at a very low price, IMHO, on a
relative basis.
