Here's an excellent example of why Chinese growth stocks are fertile ground for
those, like Dr. Burry, who have the forensic capabilities, the time, and the
Chinese language resources to do a detailed analysis of these companies - and
why they are quicksand for the typical net-net value investor:

I also tried to verify some info about GFRE and was unable to do so. I did
search for GFRE chief executive XiaoBin Liu and only got this:

I this the same guy? if so the chief would have another job as a Laizhou Yuanda
Chemical Industry Machinery Factory owner. Both the Laizhou factory and GFRE
bromide operations are in Shandong but of course that still does not mean that
both XiaBins are the same individual.

I also did some searches for GFRE operating companies " Shouguang City Haoyuan
Chemical Company Limited" ,and did not get any hits either although I did find
some similar named bromide companies located in Shandong province.

Anyway I am not able to really verify anything.I figure that with these stocks,
a) either I am at a great disadvantage of others, or b) there is nothing there.

Neither of these two options is very comforting, so I'll stay away from GFRE or

Hi Paul:

RE: EXCO Resources Inc. (XCO)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=XCO

I noticed you owned this company in 2009. Do you still follow it?

I started a tracking position today. What attracted me to this company is that
they recently purchased producing property (6/2010) owned by Southwestern
Energy Company.
http://www.excoresources.com/single-news-release.htm?regid=1438997

News release from their Web site: "...EXO announces agreement to purchase
properties prospective for the Haynesville and Bossier shales from Southwestern
Energy Company (NYSE:SWN) ("SWN") for approximately $355 million, subject to
customary purchase price adjustments. The properties to be acquired include
producing assets, gathering lines and acreage in Shelby, San Augustine and
Nacogdoches Counties, Texas and are located within the area of mutual interest
established by the existing East Texas/North Louisiana joint venture with BG
Group, plc (LSE:BG.L) ("BG Group"). BG Group will have the opportunity to
purchase 50% of this acquisition..."

I like that they got producing wells w/ the gathering infrastructure already in
place.

"...The assets include producing properties with current gross production of
more than 51 Mmcf per day (17 Mmcf per day net) from 9 producing wells and
approximately 20,000 net acres prospective for the Haynesville and Bossier
shales...."

On Wednesday they announced the completion of the sale of $750 million of 7.5%
notes. This will be used to finance the transaction.

My interest is in their gathering system(s) and the long term revenue stream(s)
they can generate building future capacity as new NG wells come online. The
purchase is already financed with long term debt and they have the opportunity
to sell off 50% of their interests with their JV partner BG Group where they
share common interests in similar properties near the same location. The risk
is in the near term price of NG but I expect NG prices to rise at a faster rate
than oil in the next 10 years.

It's hard for me to value these particular assets as well as the company's
other proved and probable reserves. They should be one of the lowest marginal
cost producers since they own the gathering assets which saves them between
10%-20% per MMcf over the other operators in this area.

Southwestern Energy Company Com (NYSE: SWN) is one I have been look at as one
of the lowest cost producers. Even after their purchase, XCO's debt to annual
net income is still quite low. When you compare the BV, Debt and other value
measures between XCO and SWN, XCO seems like the better buy. Their BV is 1/2
that of SWN at 1.9x. XCO is also selling near thei 52wk low of $13.30/share.

XCO is at an interesting valuation, my gut reaction is that they overpaid for

And xco likes to point out that they have production start off at an initial
"22 mmcf". I see the numbers, dont believe this last for a second, not to
mention most producers are now putting a tighter choke on the initial
production in these areas instead of blowing the top off them. This is similar
to the CHK hype machine.

Although I hold shares in RIMM (tiny position) and NOK (bigger position), both
of them are in the "hold lightly" camp. Both of them have long term issues.

RIMM:
Strengths:
- Blackberry/Crackberry email franchise.
- Strong growth and profits
Issues:
- Eroding enterprise support for Blackberry-only mobile setup
- Not much regular phone penetration / brand value
- No open OS / unclear transition to open OS / development / apps model
Bright future spots:
- Unclear (none?): more penetration into enterprises globally? more sales to
non-business users? Both of these are pretty questionable

NOK:
Strengths:
- Very high conventional phone market share / brand value, especially in
emerging countries.
- Great logistics / HW organization that produces profits even on $30 phones.
- Still high smartphone market share.
Issues:
- Losses in the last year.
- Forever botched up services/software organization and its deliverables.
- Unclear whether Symbian can be made developer and user friendly.
- Unclear whether MeeGo is good enough (replacement for Symbian)
- New CEO and old company culture will clash delaying Symbian^3,^4 and other
products.
Bright future spots:
- Unclear (none?). Great reception of N8? Great Symbian rewrite? Great QT
developer tools? Great MeeGo products?

>> Of course, their source for this info is from 2007 GFRE press release. <<

Nice research but the problem is that all the links I get are pointing towards
GFRE and their releases but none go to the operating subsidies.

I have been able to find links to ICL which claims to be the bromine market
leader and lowest cost producer (somewhat credible since the dead sea is the
highest concentration bromine source available:

http://www.icl-group.com/iclgroup/Pages/IndustrialProducts.aspx

Interesting that they state in the Y2010 report: "Production of bromine in
China continued to decrease,because of depletion of bromine resources, a harsh
winter and high production costs."

In above link, it appears that China's well with only about 0.2g/l of bromine
should have fairly high production costs.

Interesting that they also mention well depletion as an issue in China.

 "Production of bromine in China continued to decrease, because of depletion of
bromine resources, a harsh winter and high production costs."

I think winter was mentioned in GFRE's Q1 results. Depletion would explain why
GFRE is acquiring other companies to expand production. Depletion also would
partially explain the price rise, since imports are probably limited (and
costly?). However, this raises an additional issue - if depletion is big, GFRE
acquisitions would have to be thought as only temporary resource additions. In
essence then one has to think about GFRE as E&P with resources and resource
replacement being an important part of the valuation.

re GFRE
Jurgis, yes the harsh winter was mentioned in GFRE's press releases. I assume
it may freeze the water of some wells and such impede production. I did find
the chart from ICL interesting that shows bromide concentrations of different
resources - chinese wells had very low concentrations of bromine, which may
also mean high production costs.

GFRE stated selling prices of 3$/kg Bromine seems roughly inline with world
market prices, so I am not sure why a chinese producer in China would have a
large advantage - sure there are some transportation costs (hazardous good!)
but would they be high enough to impede competition?

>>In essence then one has to think about GFRE as E&P with resources and

Any particular reason you no longer follow these companies? Is it because their

re GFRE - during the last quarter GFRE's Depreciation expense was almost 4.8M$,
or almost 10% of their revenues. However the depletion (rapid or not) appears
to be the reason why GFRE cannot grow organically - they do not develop new
bromine wells but buy existing ones and exploit them. They probably can
increase production short term on purchased plants (debottlenecking) but LT
they are looking into declining production from each existing well(very much
like an E&P company).

It is not a growth business model, it's a rollup business model, at least on
the bromine side.

re GFRE leaps - the problem with GFRE's leaps is that the bid/ask spread is

retail (ask). you can pout a GTC order in of course with your price and leave
it there but very likely, you will only get filled of the stock moves against
your bet.

As on option play, i'd rather get into puts for something completely overvalued
like CRM or OPEN. At least there is liquidity in the options even though the
premiums are quite steep (due to volatility). Heck the 70$ 2/2011 puts for CRM

Hi Matt -

Re: GFRE Buy/Write strategy - An easy 20% return?

I always like selling covered calls. Therefore, if you think the stock is cheap
at the current price (@$6.90/share), you could buy the stock and then sell the
January 2011 $7.50 call for $0.80/share.

You would book a total of $0.60/share on the stock gain and $0.80/share on the
call premium. Assume that the stock closes above $7.50/share in January 2011,
your net gain on this call write strategy is $1.40/share. That's a 20% return
in four months or a 60% return annualized.

You give away the upside but do lock in the call premium and can sell the stock
and/or the option again in January 2011 if it is below $7.50/share.

I noticed somebody did this in size for the April 2011 $12.50 calls. It looks
like they sold 7,000 contracts to open for $0.20/share. The activity may have
something to do with option expiration Friday and could be a hedge on the April
10 2011 calls which have an OI of 7045 contracts.

The key on a low risk Buy/Write strategy is (1) you are able to buy the stock
at a value price, (2) there is option activity that allows you to sell out of
the money covered calls at better than fair value prices and (3) there is a
good chance that the stock will be called away at the strike price where the
covered call was sold.

The downside is if the stock tanks in the short period due to company specific
"negative" information.

Many times I will use this strategy to generate income as I am accumulating a
long term core position. When the opportunity presents it's self to sell an out
of the money call that carries good premium on a position I own, I will sell
the covered call. If during the period the stock drops significantly due to
"non Company" specific reasons, I will buy more shares equivalent to the calls
I already wrote. Thus I now have doubled my initial position and have 1/2 of my
shares hedged with decaying covered calls.

I have been doing this on MPW (Medical Properties Trust Inc.) selling the
October $10 calls. The stock has bounced around from $9.00/share - $10.25/share
(my avg cost is around $9.50/share) and also pays an 8% dividend QTR
(Sep,Dec,March & June). If my Oct $10 calls expire worthless, I will re-sell
the April 2011 $10.00 calls now selling around $0.70/share. During the period
from my first Buy around $10.00/share (sold the Oct $10 calls for $0.55/share),
I subsequently bought more shares at price(s) $9.30/share & $9.63/share.

I also did this on GOV (Government Properties Income Trust) until my entire
position was called away in May at $25.00/share. I am thinking of
re-establishing the position if GOV sells below $25.00/share. The dividend is
6.6% when priced at $25.00/share.

I like to put on a call/write position for (1) stocks that pay dividends, (2)
sandwich the strike month after the xdividend date and (3) the stock must meet
my "Buy" value criteria for the sector and/or company special situations. SVU
may be another one that fits this criteria.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SVU,GOV,MPW&d=s

It's not an all or none strategy. The Buy/Write strategy can complement a long
term hold....waiting for your value buy to blossom. It can "juice" your over
all return.

would be prohibitive for a stock i want to hold onto long term.

EKS,

Thanks for the post, and your main things that you look for on this. I actually
have delved into this covered call strategy for the first time on part of my
position in Intel. I sold the Oct 20 Calls for .19 and bought the stock for
18.10.

I am new to this covered call strategy and i dont believe i will do this to
often because the positions i take i really believe in but i like the idea for
some holdings in core positions while i am also getting a dividend yield and
also prefer the big cap liquid names. I am a little uncertain though on the
length and placement of writing the calls but have been reading up on it.

soo... we will see how this plays out.

Hi Grommit -

As a back up I use Zack's analyst estimates
http://www.zacks.com/research/report.php?type=estimates&t=KMB

I do not like Google Finance. Yahoo Finance is my favorite but recently they
have been updating their layout pages and from time to time the data fields are
vacant.

FINVIZ.com provides a comprehensive information page that provides a quick
overview at the company level.
http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=kmb

I will also use their screener to identify other similar candidate stocks that
have similar financial attributes that I may have overlooked.

Earning.com provides another view of upcoming company earnings w/ estimates. I
use it to see what stocks are going ex-divided for the upcoming week and/or
month.

URS. Got a fill this morning for a few shares to add to my small position. Not
a greatly profitable company or with even okay roe. Profitable every year
though in past ten. Perhaps such is a function of the nature of its business -
how the contracts are written and the government bidding process.

At current stock price, URS is close to falling into my value box, and I'll
just take a few shares here with stock near 12-mo low.

Thanks for the Graham screen, richardred.

Some of these stocks keep falling into and out of Ben Graham value. CENT is one
like that imo; I've followed it for several years, have no position currently.
WILC too, has been mentioned here over the years.

I'm trying to reenter AP (Ampco-Pit) again. Price is still too high for me
though.

I saw APT on that screen, looked at it, and decided to take a few shares. "The
company offers disposable protective apparel products, including shoecovers,
bouffant caps, coveralls, gowns, frocks, and lab coats for the cleanroom,
industrial, and pharmaceutical markets; and building supply products comprising
construction weatherization products, such as house wrap and synthetic roof
underlayment products to construction supply and roofing distributors."

Couple negatives: with flu scare of last year gone, demand for company's
consumable products will begreatly diminished. Secondly and more significantly,
APT's key distributor decided it will compete with APT, so it has stopped
distributing APT's product. This has been the reason I've not bought the stock
previously.

Steadily increasing book value, no ltd, history of profits have characterized
this company. I'll go for a few shares at current price, and hope the company
can use its ample assets to recover.

Pretty good positive summary here on Seeking Alpha:

Only point the guy maybe missed is that for such a dink company, there seems to
be an awful lot of daily volume in this stock. Perhaps I'm just overly
sensitive to that because I'm having to be very careful in extricating myself
from similar dink companies in this sector with low volume and wide bid/ask
spreads (LAKE, ABIX.pk)

New positions: MHR-C, UFPT
Positions increased: CEU, GFRE, NEWN, UVIC
Positions reduced: GRVY, IGK, NOK
Positions eliminated: COH

With some travels, I did not buy and sell as much as I probably would have
otherwise.

Fixed income market is getting quite expensive and not very attractive. I sold
some more IGK and may sell other prefs with hohum yields. I bought some MHR-C
after divie under par, but it is not greatly attractive either - it's callable
in December 2011, so if MHR does well, it will be called; if MHR does badly, it
will drop from current price.

I sold GRVY in my taxable account so I don't need to deal with PFIC issues.
Sold NOK on IMHO heightened risk of delays and underperformance after new CEO
appointment and Anssi Vanjoki's departure. Sold COH as valuation became pretty
high.

Added more to Chinese small caps that continue to be hated by everyone. NEWN is
the most risky out of three with recent subsidiary purchases that may mask a
lot of gunk in financial statements.

I started a small exploratory position in UFPT discussed recently on this
thread.

Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, by Charles
Kindleberger.

This is an encyclopedia of financial crisis and crashes. he goes through them
all - Kippelzeit (hyperinfaltion inflation) Tulipmania, the great Depression,
South Sea bubble, Asian Crisis, South American crisis.

There are many interesting things in this book: even before banks were
dominating the financial systems, merchants were able to create credit (in
effect money) by using bills of sale, or Wechsel (Wissel for the Dutch).
Eventually the creation of credit which first enhanced and simplified trade
(easier to move a bill of sale than a bunch of gold or silvercoin) lead to easy
credit and extension of credit to those that did not do commerce but
speculated. Well it was apparently 400 years ago when the state lost control
over the money supply and the gold standard did not help.

Another thing are credit crunches - I think there is a report that daily credit
for stock loans during one crisis (1857 or 1873) was 5% per day!.

He is a strong proponent of the lender of last resort, which jumps in when
everyone else is pulling back and gives unlimited support, maybe at a penalty
cost. It appears that the Bank of England was the first bank to dabble in this
and in fact it was the UK who gave unlimited support to the credit system in
2008 (remember the interbank guarantees in October 2008). But then on the other
hand he also recognized that in virtually every case, cheap money was available
to many, a crash occurred not too much later and quite a few government
defaulted as well in the past.

It a good book imo and has great entertainment value and some value for
investor or those that watch the financial markets because a lot of things that
we are seeing now, are not all that new, it's just that we are learning the
same thing over and over again.

Farmland. Might work for some with deep pockets and great research skills like
Mike Burry. Others will lose money as they lost it with stocks. The fact that
farmland - like RE - is illiquid will be both bane and blessing for some of
these folks. Bane if you need to sell it, blessing - maybe - if you can't sell
it through the downturn unlike stocks that are sold at the bottom....

Personally, I have no clue or inclination to buy farmland or RE for
investments.

BTW, if one uses cliche motivation "land is finite, human population is
growing", one should be very sure A) that one's assumptions are correct B) that
one knows more than average cliche spouting journalist. (c) Ken Fisher and all

I agree on farmland. For a normal investor it's very much a case where he is
not going to make money. "land is finite, human population is growing" is true
for CA real estate as well and has not prevented it from going down.

For me the value of Farmland would be given by the multiple of annual cash flow
(pick your number between 10-20X) that I could obtain by renting it out.

Yeah, I was thinking about mentioning cash flow and then forgot. :)

Farmland/RE works better if the cashflow yield is high. Then there is some
rational basis to appreciation and good money even without appreciation.

Most of the RE - AFAIK, I'm not an expert - did not get to very attractive CF
multiples. I have no clue if any of the farmland is trading at good CF
multiples.

At least CF is advantage over things like collectibles or commodities that
don't have CF at all.

Re: Farmland

I wonder if there are any REITs that specialize in Ag Production & farm
management? I did find this http://agroreit.com/models.html .

The closest thing I own is Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc. (PCL) which is an REIT
Trust that owns owns and manages timberlands in the United States. They own and
operate approximately 7 million acres in 19 states.

http://www.plumcreek.com/Portals/0/downloads/factsheets/PC_Quick_Facts.pdf

They generate some of their cash flow doing conservation exchanges. 1.3 million
acres have been committed to conservation
through conservation sales, easements and land exchanges. They can periodically
harvest the timber on these parcels but for a guaranteed cash flow have agreed
to not develop or sell these properties.

It's been an ok investment generating on average a 5% return in my IRA. I
probably should average down as the shares I bought in January 2008 are selling
about 12% lower today.

I do think a well managed Agriculture REIT w/ properties diversified around the
world might do well. Their land assets would provide a good hedge against
inflation and the cash flows generated from their crop(s) production should
produce a reasonable dividend stream for the investor.

Matt Monday, thanks for that list. Here are my comments.

AEA and QCCO. These payday lenders have been decimated by new state consumer
lending laws. I've made a small bet on QCCO. It may be in transition to a new
business model. Just a few shares for me.

AIRT. On my watch list.

AXS. I currently hold shares. Will not add at current price.

CSC. On my watch list now.

IPCC. Company at stated bv; bv keeps growing. And it might work as buy now.
It's in the p&c insurance industry, and I already have several in that sector.
However, IPCC's specialty is non-standard auto insurance, and that is a
business I've liked in the past. The reason is that "regular" USA auto
insurance is, or can be, heavily regulated by the individual states. Regulation
in terms of standardization of policy, profit returns that are allowed, and so
on. Otoh, with non-standard policies (i.e. "risky" drivers), those regulations
either don't apply or are relaxed (Jmo, I'm no expert in state insurance
requirements.) There's not so much pressure on legislators by the "normal"
car-driving voters. This leads to more profit opportunity for the companies in
the business (and presumably, more risk for them too.) Stocks near it's 12-mo
high; that discourages me somewhat. I'll consider though.

PLPC. Holding on to my very few shares acquired in June. I believe I mentioned
it at least somewhere on SI, but in searching, I can't find my post.

SVT. I'll consider reentering again when it gets closer to lows.

UUV. Might work. I'm already holding several tobacco stocks, so I'll pass on
this one.

Madharry, I'll link the latest presentation by SSN:

PageName=Rodman%20and%20Renshaw%20Conference%20and%20Corporate%20Presentation

With e&p companies, I guess there are at least four faiths that one must have
for a commitment:

1. Faith in quality of management (operations experience)
2. Faith in the numbers management provides (How much is salesmanship and how
much is unbiased, accurate analysis of facts)
3. Faith in the geographical formations
4. Faith in financial acumen. (deal-making skills by management (Acquiring
leases cheaply enough. Then, can management get financing without destroying
share-holder value).

Without providing any personal knowledge, I can only say management seems
competent and informative. The numbers management provides - those I can take
only on faith. I have A lot of faith in the geological formations. Management
has been very astute in acquiring land cheaply and selling parts off dear to
fund projects.

=====================
First of all we're talking about a dink company - there are 83.2M ADS shares,
so market cap of company is $116M. There are 16.6M additional sh in options.
Company has $70M in cash and $11M in debt. There may or may not be actual cash
taxes to be paid on most of this cash which was acquired from a recent land
sale. (There may also be a secondary cash receipt of $6M that subsequently was
received by SSN.) SSN has a small (under 5%) override on revenues produced from
the land sale, so there's quite a bit of investor interest to make sure whoever
has bought the land (It's not been officially announced who the buyer is.) has
financial and operating wherewithal to quickly commence drilling and hand over
the override to SSN. Over time, given the number of wells that might be drilled
and production flows off this land sale, these override monies can be
significant. (Aside: I'm not sure of the contract terms-- whether the override
is on gross production or net or some other fractional amount.)

You will see in the presentation that SSN values itself near-term based on
proved reserves at $1.82/sh (slide #30). They don't have or haven't published
reserve estimates for their Niobrara Hawk Springs project. They assume that if
it's as prolific as they expect, the value of SSN longer term (whenever that
is) is $9.89/sh. (slide #31)

Here's where somebody else took a swag at a current valuation:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/224261-samson-oil-gas-brings-home-the-niobrara-
acon?source=yahoo

I suppose I could put in my numbers where I like to use fully-diluted shares,
after tax amounts, and proved and possible reserves. Basically though it boils
down to this for me: The company seems to be pretty good at making deals; the
company is pretty good about keeping investors informed about what's going on;
the company has land and the cash to drill on it. I'm a big bettor (well, for
me) on Bakken, and also on Niobrara (a shale not much mentioned on SI). I
assume as is typical of small e&p companies, IF there is potential commercial
production of oil on its properties, and IF oil prices don't crater, and IF SSN
has the necessary operational skills or partnering skills, then maybe SSN can
realize some of the potential valuation numbers for it that are being written
about.

On the other note, GENC has been an NCAV net-net since 2008... That's the risk

I own farmland. It's been with my family for over a hundred years and I lease
it out. All farmland in my area is leased for a portion of the crop. So your
yield will be as good as the weather and the farmer. All farmers are not
created equally. It goes without saying that neither is their machinery.

It's a simple investment with few moving parts. However, it isn't for someone
who isn't involved with the culture. Most good farmland is bought up by the
largest farmers. The four families in my area just keep expanding their land
holdings when a parcel comes up on the market, especially anything that shares
a border to their land. So I don't see it as a viable investment for the
novice. The family that leases my land has been farming it since the thirties.

If you switch farmers, you better know what you are doing.

There is no better indicator to measure the LT inflation expectations than the
gold price, imo.

The problem with Japan is/was that the asset prices were so inflated that there
was no way out but zero interest rates. Even now, RE is Tokyo for example is
incredible expensive, even though demographics dictate falling demand LT.

Kindleberger observes in his book that most asset boom (if widespread enough)
eventually will lead to a boom in RE, the reverse logic applies as well, imo.

Re Enerplus Resources Fund (ERF)

Enerplus Acquires Bakken and Marcellus assets and sells Kirby Oil Sands lease
and other non-core assets
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Enerplus-Acquires-Bakken-and-cnw-2878654770.html?
=0&.v=1

Enerplus has added approximately 450,000 net acres of highly prospective land
in both Canada and the U.S. creating new growth areas that are expected to add
production and reserves in the years ahead.

o Enerplus has entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 46,500 net
acres (72 sections) of land in the Fort Berthold area of Dunn and McKenzie
counties in North Dakota.

The acquisition includes approximately 800 bbls/day of light crude oil
production and proved plus probable reserves of 10 million BOE primarily
attributable to the Bakken formation based upon our internal evaluation. This
compliments our existing estimate of eight million BOE of unbooked proved plus
probable reserves in this area.

o Enerplus closed the acquisition of 58,500 net acres of undeveloped land in
the Marcellus shale natural gas play in northwest West Virginia and
Maryland.... While no proved or probable reserves have been acquired, we
estimate original gas in place on this acreage of approximately 50 to 60 Bcf
per 640 acres.

o Enerplus has entered into an agreement to sell 100% of its Kirby
steam-assisted gravity drainage oil sands lease for gross proceeds of
$405million.

=====================================================================

ERF is consolidating their Oil & NG reserves and selling their producing Kirby
Oil Sands Lease where they should net $150 million on the transaction.

Jurgis, on Gencor, yes the Synfuels biz is gone as reflected by the lack of the
"other income"...combine this with the recession and a cyclical industry, you
have a company going nowhere, not to mention management controls major voting
rights to the shares, thus potential acquisition scenario is almost
non-existent. However, a catalyst may be increased revenue from the Obama
infrastructure program. Revenues have recently increased 8%, IR also indicated
a pick up in activity. Obama also indicated that fixing the country's
infrastructure is his priority. This may be a net-net with a near term
catalyst. How much lower can it go? Market cap is practically 100% cash.

cash question: I'd say it depends on the company. For a growth company, I'd
value lot of cash as a negative. That is, if they are growing why are they
holding cash instead of reinvesting in the business or returning excess to
shareholders?
For net-net companies, it's a positive. You'd be trying buying the stock to get
$1 cash for fifty-cents.
For value investors, cash would be one margin-of-safety aspect. I assume
though, that value investors are a minority, and that "the market" wouldn't
value cash that highly.
========================================

Is it something like this that's hurting this USA now?: Everybody afraid of
something or another, so we have companies and individuals sitting on what - a
$trillion in cash assets?

Maybe it isn't that the market doesn't value cash. It's that people don't value
the market. Buying stocks is out of favor.
Too many people just holding on to their own cash...or trying to.

IMO, this is also a way for burry to invest for coming inflation. I dont see
burry putting to much work into gold because he seems to not like crowded
trades. Farmland that i know nothing about would seem to not be a crowded
trade.

And when markets finally impose discipline on the US dollar maybe he will
become a farmer.

the notion that gold is a crowded trade is faulty. gold as an investment class
historically is much smaller than it used to be because to the huge expansion
of world financial markets. As world governments realize the idiocy of selling
gold at firesale prices- witness that moron Gordon Brown who sold much of the
UK gold at $275 about 5 years ago, they are now realizing that they are better
off holding gold and soon silver than dollars and euros. oops!

My opinion is that the ponzi scheme which has become dollar denominated debt
will ultimately end like all ponzi schemes do.
Lots of unhappy investors and safe haven types being taken to the cleaners.

My only question is whether under a more conservative regime will the Feds let
States and Municipalities go bankrupt so that they can amend foolish retirement
schemes, or will they try to keep the party going without facing reality.

I didnt say gold was a crowded trade. I agree with you that gold is not a
crowded INVESTMENT. I think it is somewhat of a crowded trade which there is a
difference imo, but that can only become more crowded, and even when it starts
to get crowded as an investment and a trade it will probably get more
crowded...... I traded commodities before really getting into stocks, so i cant
help but look at charts and other relationships that effect the direction of
commodities fwiw.

I was just suggesting that maybe burry thinks gold is a crowded trade.

I do not own gold, i am young guy.... what do i care about gold?

I hate to even mention this though, I own out of the money leaps on Newmont
Mining (NEM).

EPS % Chg (Last Qtr) 77%
P-E Ratio 18
3 Year EPS Growth Rate 35%
Debt % 43%
EPS Est % Chg (Current Yr) 30%
Market Cap $31.48 Bil
Sales % Chg (Last Qtr) 34%
Dividend Yield 0.9%
3-Year Sales Growth Rate 16%
Profit Margin 38.7%

Newmont had proven and probable gold reserves of 91.8 million equity ounces and
an aggregate land position of approximately 33,400 square miles (86,500 square
kilometers) Also like the copper kicker, i believe 20% of revenue comes from
copper.

Anybody think the eventual bubble in gold will be when our dollar is worth
nothing and we realize that great we have gold but now what to do with it? Or
we backing on the ability to trade that with each other and with the Chinese.
The whole gold concept blows my mind for some reason.

oh yeah, such things would never happen to our financial system.

GENC Market cap is practically 100% cash.

Yes, it is and that's the attraction. But you have to realize that apart of the
synfuel scam...cough...business, the company may never consistently made money.
So I don't see it suddenly becoming profitable unless they find another tax
credit loophole. Maybe that's what they are trying to do with the biofuels
R&D...

In other news, 2 CFOs got fired (quit?) within 8-9 month tenure. No new CFO.

Company has majority-voting share class controlled by CEO&family. So no hostile
takeovers.

Sorry, but I'll skip. Of course, it's a net-net and it could be taken over with
owner-family blessing for 3X tomorrow. Or it could go nowhere for another 2
years like it did since 2008 when it became a net-net

re (net?) Cash on balance sheet. in my opinion, cash on the balance sheet is
worth more than zero but each $ on the balance sheet is worth less than a $ in
market cap. Here are the reasons why:

a) there is a good chance that the cash is used for something stupid, most
likely an acquisition or stock buybacks when shares are fairly high. Companies
with a lot of cash tend to be poor capital allocators.

b) Even if a) is not applicable the money may be "trapped" in a foreign
subsidary and the only way to move it home to do something with it would be to
pay extra taxes in the US. MSFT is an example of that.

I have seen a few cashes during the credit crunch when a $ on the balance sheet
was worth more than a $ in market cap. This happened with REITs that raised
money in secondaries. The market responded favorable to the REIT having more
cash available and seemed to assign them a higher market cap. Those were pretty
exceptional circumstances, though.

The problem with Gold is that it's a "collectible" - it has been such for a
couple of thousand years so it apparently does not go out of fashion like rare
tulips or Pokemon cards. But what is gold really worth? Absent any cash flows,
it's worth what someone else is willing to pay for it just like is the case
with any other collectibles. So buying gold is a bet that there are fools that
are willing a higher price for to when you decide to sell. Stocks or even
farmland have a cash flow stream associated with it.

As for mining stocks, their track record in earlier financial crisis (1987,
2008) has been abysmal. This does not mean that the next go around might not be
different (they did survive the great depression well after all). the silver
bug get's me even more so because silver was an industrial metal when it was
used for photography. Now that use must have gone close to zero, so I assume
the demand gap is also coming from the collectible side.

While I agree that we have not seen a full blown retail mania yet, Gold has
become a liquid asset (in ETF form) and you can trade futures (with 10% down).
All those incarnations were not available many years ago and have made gold
more tradable, which I think is sort of how a mania manifests itself.

the danger is that this can all reverse very quickly if folks panic - ETF units
could be liquidated and the asset pool shrink which means that physical gold
would be sold. Futures, although they do not include a physical delivery do
impact the real physical market too, because some players are the same in both
(hedging etc.) and the psychological element. How will that turn out , it looks
like near term there is nothing but up but when the tide turns the chart will
probably look like 1981/1982. If we get hyperinflation gold will go up byut
it's going to be hard to tell of the buying power really stays the same. Some
stocks may work well or even better as a storage of value in such an
environment.

I just don't know how this is going to play out but it's sort of hard for me to
make a value case for gold right now.

it above $17 until the next report. Unfortunately, this also means that I have

KED too imponderable for me. Pass.

1. Company makes mistakes which cost shareholders money. Maybe competitor
mlp-holding companies do too, but I don't see it.

2. How can somebody have much faith in NAV when 50% of the companies (assets)
that KED holds are private firms?

3. Why will the distribution have a "significant" portion as return of capital?
Tortoise Funds didn't report any return of capital monies in '09, although they
say they may or may not have some in '10.
