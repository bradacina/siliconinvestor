In August, Concord was pressured by quality-of-earnings concerns. According to
an article in Barron's, some investors feared that the company used the sale of
certain terminals leased to merchants, which it reported as other income, to
make up for rising expenses. ("The other income category is a legitimate part
of our earnings," said Melinda Mercurio, a Concord spokeswoman.) [Haven't seen
anyting on this issue since]

I worry what impact declining consumer spending will have on CE, but perhaps
that is already reflected in this low price?

I'm looking at CE more as a growth stock. I posted on it on the Buffetology
thread.

Given the still high (imo) p/e, what I like about CE is:

continuing high profit margins (so far)
very good debt/eq ratio
on-going stock buybacks and acquisitions
apparently expanding the business around core competency
dominant in its sector
possible shift from insider selling at higher prices to small insider buying
around current prices

What I don't like is:
possible new entrants into CE's market
high price/sales
high price/book
continuing drop in ROE

What concerns me is my enthusiasm - but assumption - that the company acts as a
toll gate for people who use ATM and debit cards. And that this is a
sustainable competitive advantage.

As in Buffett advertising agency stocks of the 1960's that were profitable
because they gave a haircut to companies that used their services (i.e. took
15% of a client's advertising budget)---- I hope I'm looking at some similar
model here and a somewhat similar profit opportunity for stock buyers, even
though the CE p/e is high (compared to those advert. stocks).

I'm adding a little more to my small CE position today also. If we now have
three of us who've bought CE this year and posted on it, I'll add CE to the
thread's '03 list of stocks.

CE The market reacted strongly to the CSFB down grade yet there was nothing in
the press about Merrill's reinitiating coverage with a BUY. Here are some
excerpts from the Merrill report on qualitative issues:
Vertical Integration Creates Competitive Advantages
We believe that Concord’s vertical integration creates strong competitive
advantages. Through its presence at the point of sale, ownership of the largest
ATM and debit network, and back-end processing services, Concord is able to
capture fees regardless of the transaction type or source. In some cases,
Concord is able to generate four fees from a single transaction. By touching so
many points along the payment processing chain, we believe Concord is in a
unique position to not only grow along with the cardbased payment industry, but
also to influence the industry’s development. Concord’s vertical integration
also provides the company with many cross-selling opportunities.

Opportunities
Concord has developed a successful track record of finding emerging growth
opportunities early and then capitalizing as the market develops. The company
has done this with its network strategy as well as its early penetration of the
gas station, supermarket, and convenience store categories.

Key Investment Risks
Re-signing of STAR Banks
When Concord acquired the STAR and MAC networks, the company signed its large
bank clients to contracts that run through 2004. Meanwhile, Visa and MasterCard
have become much more aggressive in their efforts to grow their PIN-based debit
volumes. The potential exists for the card associations to attract a number of
large banks away from STAR and towards their own debit networks, thus hurting
STAR’s market share. In addition, Concord may feel pricing pressure in
re-signing long-term contracts owing to the competitive threats from Visa ,
MasterCard, and even First Data through its majority ownership of the NYCE
network. In our opinion, STAR’s dominant market share will keep banks as
customers, but the company will have to bring pricing levels down and the
amortization of signing bonuses (also known as “cap payments”) will likely hurt
margins. In the end, we think Concord’s 20% earnings growth rate will remain
intact. However, these issues clearly present risks.

Pricing Pressure Could Hurt Margins
Generally, Concord operates in highly competitive markets. Historically, the
company has been able to offset pricing pressure through lower processing costs
and general operating efficiencies. While we think Concord’s vertical
integration strategy and leading market share within its targeted markets give
the company long-term competitive advantages, competitors can always try to
steal market share away through aggressive pricing strategies.

Potential Conflicts between Merchants, Card Issuers, and the Card Associations
Given the attractive growth characteristics of the payment processing industry,
the major players in the payment food chain – merchants, financial
institutions, the card associations, and third party processors – clearly want
to protect their roles. With its growing number of hooks into the payment
processing industry, Concord continues to encroach upon the card associations
and financial institutions. We believe the company must walk a fine line while
catering to the conflicting interests of merchants and financial institutions.
Merchants want lower payment transaction costs while higher payment
transactions costs generally benefit financial institutions. Concord will have
to carefully manage its role in the middle.

Bob Rudd, I'm adding more to several stock holdings as the stocks drop in price
to new lows.

I continue this practice as it has worked in the past (sometimes). However, we
just might be in a very new era where this won't work even at current and
relatively low stock valuations. Stock p/e's at all risk and growth levels may
come down further and stay down because investors may want quick and larger
paybacks for investing in a future that's co-opted by extremists. Perhaps like
only buying stocks if NPV calculations work for 4 or 5 years, because the
future's too iffy to carry the calculations out longer. So by avoiding most
stocks, investors might continue to drop p/e ratios to adjust for the
additional risks that seem more possible and probable as regards suicide
attacks on the US and maybe chem, bio, or nuclear attacks too.

Stock p/e's at all risk and growth levels may come down further and stay down
because investors may want quick and larger paybacks for investing in a future
that's co-opted by extremists. 

i would say that, even if you didn't have worries about anthrax attacks and
whatnot on our own soil, multiples are likely to head back to the lows of the
1970s (SPX PE well below 10, bottoming around 7) over the next couple decades,
due to many factors, any one of which is enough to bring about a serious bear
market (e.g., demographics and the coming oversupply of sellers vs buyers as
baby boomers retire, poor GDP growth, the coming shellacking of bonds as the
dollar goes down the toilet, persistent high valuations today, the coopting of
America's corporate equity by scumbag CEOs, poor earnings quality,
overinvestment in stocks by the public, the historical reality that every
bubble was followed by a commensurate bust and retreat to trough valuations,
yada yada).

the stock market seems destined to go way down even without the help of Al
Qaeda et al. what they will add to the long-term valuation equation is without
precedent.

however, barring a catastrophic attack (e.g., something that kills more than
10,000 people in one go and forces evacuation of a major metro area), i don't
think anxiety alone will bring down valuations or shorten NPV payback.

So by avoiding most stocks, investors might continue to drop p/e ratios to
adjust for the additional risks that seem more possible and probable 

remember that most investors are doing anything but avoiding stocks. whether
you look at the historically low cash levels of mutual funds, the high
investment participation of households (which hit a high in percentage terms
last year, i believe, at around 52% of households having some stock ownership),
or the allocation policies of institutional investors, they are all extremely
heavily weighted toward equities, when compared to any other period in US
history.

my preferred habitat, if that is the phrase, is to buy and hold value stocks.
however, i think it is worth keeping in mind that in our country's worst
economic period--the Depression--value stocks underperformed growth. mainly
because more value stocks were fiscally weak cos that went belly up.

Darfot: regarding "remember that most investors are doing anything but avoiding
stocks."

I don't have figures for the macro level. I can speak of my social circle
though. (I'm talking about a very small sample here -- I don't know that many
people -g-)
I know only one other person who's been investing (buying or at least holding)
and who's ridden the market down. I've got at least a couple who've cashed in
their substantial stock portfolios for bonds. Others have decreased the amounts
they're contributing to retirement accounts. Some others only invest
sporadically like every few years when a broker can sell them on something hot
(gold bullion now). Couple of others sticking to their own business or
investing in collectibles or real estate. A few don't invest in anything.
(unless family or boats, trucks, women, wine-and-song are considered
investments)

Today I called my wife's broker to inquire about switching out of an IRA of my
wife's that's 100% in a growth fund (Ha! Some growth. grrrrrr.) to a fund more
like Dodge and Cox. The broker right away strongly recommended a balanced fund
where the fund manager makes decisions between holding bonds and stocks (and
where my wife might have some choice of which type of stocks - growth,
large-cap, etc. I haven't seen the prospectus -- sounds like the ole' Fund of
Funds game to me ---commission on top of commission.) Anyway, the point is that
this type of recommendation is one more indication to me that brokers must
believe that people won't any more be swayed to put their investing money into
just growth stocks or value stocks.

Even here on SI, it seems rare to find a thread where people are buying stocks
and holding them for more than just a quick trade. Sometimes it seems to me
that Silicon Investor is almost more Silicon Schmoozer -- popular threads where
posters have no intention of talking about stocks, let alone buying them.

I don't doubt that more people own stocks than ever before. And more will
continue to do so because tax laws may favor it. It just seems to me that going
forward, for people to commit to investing in specific companies they are going
to have to see, and see clearly, how and maybe when they're going to get their
money and profits out. Whether that's through a good size dividend, or a
history of growing dividends, or substantial cash flows, or something else. I
am looking at it like this today: for any stock with a p/e of 7, that's an
earnings rate of about 14%. A buy-and-hold (assuming the earnings continue)
where it takes maybe seven years to get your money back. About as far out as I
want to look. Any p/e higher, there's got to be a moat or a good story.

Paul, if a 14% earnings return is about as adventurous as you want to get,
"where it takes maybe seven years to get your money back", you must really hate
10 year Treasuries under 4%. It is all relative, and I think current returns on
Treasuries are out of line with a 14% earnings return. In other words, your

Terrorists, lack of faith in the government, China as manufacturing powerhouse

If treasuries ever do again, like in the 1970's, get to the point where they

I don't have figures for the macro level. I can speak of my social circle
though. (I'm talking about a very small sample here 

well, since a small sample is not as good as a large sample, why not consider
some macro facts:

* mutual cash fund levels would need to more than double just to reach the
average level over the past 30 years

* most individuals invest in the market through pension funds or equity mutual
funds. last year the latter experienced their first net outflows in over a
decade. but the amount was just $27 billion, which is only about 1% of assets.
this contrasts to the hundreds of billions investors poured into these funds in
the bubble years.

it is hard to say investors are avoiding stocks when they have only withdrawn
1% of assets from stock funds, which themselves have very low cash level
(indicating the managers are bullish and also not worried about withdrawals
causing a cash crunch).

if at some point individuals start to withdraw a more meaningful sum of money,
such as 10-20% of assets (which is by no means inconceivable, and is in fact a
given once boomers start to retire), the market will not respond kindly.

* SPX PE in 2002 was 30, or more than double the long-term average

* SPX dividend yield is less than half the long-term average

* market cap as percentage of GDP is STILL higher than at any previous market
peak, including 1929. since 1995 market cap as % of GDP exploded, then receded
following the bust, but is still WAY above long term average. it could fall by
half.

David: re: "I'm debating what to do about my remaining MAXS position if the
stock drops more."

My concerns are about buying more vs. just holding what I have.

With MAXS now close to $1 from book value, no ltd, selling at ~2x cash, and
decent earnings expected, and decent business prospects (niche brands in
moderately priced women's shoes), I'm not considering selling.

P/e at 10 is not so great. Nor is ROE. And there's insider selling that
continues. That's all a little off-putting for me when I consider ADDING to my
position should the stock drop again to Oct. low.

I guess a leading example wasn't enough to make the point for you. You want
DELL, IBM, LLTC, the drug industry, and all service industries? The economy
today is driven by less capital intensive companies than it was forty years
ago, and more service oriented ones (which require less than average capital).
Eighty years ago very capital intensive railroads and utilities were hot
stocks. "Capital intensive" means lots of debt, increased risk, lower profit
margins, and lower valuations. Market Cap to GDP SHOULD be higher now than in
the past. In my opinion, the only question worth discussing is how much higher
would be consistent with the past, when adjusted for the different mix of the
economy.

I view it as a hold for the reasons you stated -- p/e, low ROE, insider

I think the ROE is a bit better than reported if you remove the cash from the

The insider selling is disturbing though.

The EPS is growing, and they will benefit from the weak U.S. currency as well
as the aging population.

The dividends look pretty good as well.

there are so many things completely wrong with your argument that it's not even
worth discussing, especially on this thread. i don't know how i could look at
stocks like LLTC and DELL as great values, except that they have been great
shorts for me and i thank god people keep paying ridiculous prices for them so
that i can keep taking their money. but that is neither here nor there on this
thread.

the more interesting question for me, and i think most thread participants, is
the extent to which the unwinding of the greatest bubble in history in the late
90s will have an effect on value stocks. although many value stocks did not
achieve ridiculous multiples during the bubble, their businesses have to deal
with the aftermath.

history shows us that every bubble gives back every excess that was won in the
bull period, and ends up with trough valuations the lowness of which is
commensurate in amplitude to the bubble peaks (though the direction is
opposite). GMO did an exhaustive study of 40 past bubbles throughout history
and there was not one exception to this.

for a variety of reasons, i am convinced that the trough valuations we will see
in the next decade or two will rival those of the 70s. it is as natural as
night follows day.

this is why it is interesting to consider some of the valuation issues i
brought up. feel free to ignore these issues, and also to ignore me.

but do not make silly arguments about market cap to GDP (which was safely
within the historical average range in the early 90s, at around 55%, only to
more than triple from that level during the bubble) not mattering because of
the New Economy. imho, it seems you are just shooting from the hip without
understanding the historical context.

"feel free ..... to ignore me."

I will, after commenting on your latest generalization:

"trough valuations we will see in the next decade or two will rival those of
the 70s. it is as natural as night follows day."

As with your generalization on Market Cap/GDP, which ignored the historical
context of the shift over the last 100 years from a very capital intensive to a
less capital intensive economy, you ignore the historical and investment
context of interest rates with your latest generalization.

The valuations of the 1970's were accompanied by 8-10% and rising Treasury
rates and soaring inflation. Of course that competition for stocks required
very low valuations. That is not the investment environment today.

I will bet you also believe in a huge housing bubble, when last week Greenspan
- and before him me - pointed out that because of low mortgage interest rates
the cost of a house relative to the income available to pay for it is lower now
than in the early 1990's. Although the relationship is more direct here, this
is a clear example of asset pricing reflecting the interest rate environment.

As with your generalization on Market Cap/GDP, which ignored the historical
context of the shift over the last 100 years from a very capital intensive to a
less capital intensive economy

you seem to be unfamiliar with where the market cap/GDP ratio was just a decade
ago. if you were to look at a 100-yr chart of market cap to GDP, you would see
an erratic series of peaks and troughs. there are peaks. and there are troughs.
it so happens that in 2000 we had the biggest peak of all time, which coincided
with the top of the biggest bubble of all time. the ratio has been heading
straight down ever since but is still above all previous peaks (and WAY WAY
above where it was just a decade ago). eventually, we will find another trough,
probably at least 50% below the current level. there is no "shift over the last
100 years" reflected in this ratio. thanks for the laughs.

The valuations of the 1970's were accompanied by 8-10% and rising Treasury
rates and soaring inflation. Of course that competition for stocks required
very low valuations.

people who hope for the bubble to reflate also think high stock prices are
justified by low yields. this is false. there is no long term correlation
between low yields and high PEs. the people who yammer about this ignore all
the data before the mid 60s.

if you go back to the 1940s, yields were lower than today and PEs were but a
fraction of current levels. dividend yields never fell below the 10-yr T yield
till 1958.

the prevailing belief then was that stocks should have higher yields than govt
bonds because they were riskier. the prevailing belief now is that stocks
shouldn't pay dividends because CEOs want make $100 million a year. instead,
investors expect to sell at a profit to a greater fool. they trust in the
prowess of $100 million-a-year CEOs to deliver them strong pro forma numbers,
and they trust in the existence of future fools to deliver them capital gains,
all the while ignoring the demographic tsunami of sellers that will flood the
market as the boomers retire.

the thing about prevailing beliefs in the market is that they have a way of
changing over time. this is why the thing we call market history is of interest
to serious investors.

 i will bet you also believe in a huge housing bubble, when last week Greenspan

so you will bet on what i believe--something you have no way of knowing (and
regarding which, incidentally, you are wrong). this does not surprise me.

Darfot,

You make some good arguments, but in a couple of cases perhaps you take them to
the extreme.

Although there may be no long-term historical correlation between yields and
high PE's, I will find stocks to be much more attractive if my major
alternative investment yields 3% rather than 10%. Heck, if I could earn a
low-risk 10%, I might be out of the market entirely.

With respect to your 1940s data (a regime with lower PEs and lower bond
yields), I would guess that the stock risk premium has lowered from that time.
A greater percentage of people are invested in stocks. More importantly, stock
investors have access to more information more quickly, more liquidity, and
smaller transactions costs than at that time, such that you could expect higher
stock valuations due to decreased risks/costs in these areas.

I will find stocks to be much more attractive if my major alternative
investment yields 3% rather than 10%. 

while i agree with you in general terms, the devil is in the details. i believe
these attitudes are relative and subject to change. for example, you can drive
long term interest rates down to 1% or less and people still won't buy stocks
if they think stocks will go down. just look at Japan. when i consider the poor
quality of earnings and the high level of legalized theft present among CEOs in
American corporations, i wonder how people can have higher expectations here
than in Japan, and yet they do.

on the other hand, you can have long-term rates 50% higher than the current
10yr US T and people will still flock to stocks (as they did in the US in
2000).

on the other other hand, you can have the US 30yr T yielding around 2%, and
margin rates trading at half the dividend yield on the SPX (meaning the market
would be paying you money to use margin), and have the economy set for the
greatest inflationary expansion in US history (and the worst 50 year bond
market in US history), and yet everybody put their money in bonds in the early
1940s.

sure, it was harder to buy stocks then, but it was also harder to buy them in
the 1920s and that didn't stop people.

on yet another hand, you could have stock PEs in high-single/low-double digits
on honest earnings, with 30yr T yields working into double digits, and yet
corporations would assume only 6% returns on their pension funds even though
they could have locked in double that return just by buying US T's. that was
the late 1970s.

or they could assume 9% today when 10yr bonds are only 4%. if half their
portfolio is bonds with 4% yield, then they need to assume 14% return on their
equity portfolios even though 2002 GAAP finished at more than double the
long-term PE for an earnings yield of around 3%--this shows how dumb corporate
pension funds are, or how smart CFOs are for booking phantom pension profits
"as allowed by law".

back in the late 70s, and early 80s, people crowded into gold and other real
assets as they feared paper. it was the best time of the century to buy stocks
and bonds.

nowadays, people love paper assets when PEs are high and yields are low. gold
is still considered somewhat loony and is to be "ignored" like bearish posters
as nothing but a knee-jerk reaction to impending war.

what investments will people prefer in 15 or 20 years? the one thing we can be
fairly sure of is: they will be different from today's preferences. the chances
of tomorrow's winners being the same as yesterday's Nasdaq heros is close to
nil imo. always dangerous to fight the last war.

Regarding ALVR.... I looked for their financials at the SEC and they haven't
filed the 20F for 2002 there yet. So I went to their home page and read the
financial report they posted there.

A couple of points to ponder: 1). They claim to have spent almost $4 million to
buy back shares but the share count went from (approx.) 39M to 53M outstanding.
This looks to me like a way of removing personnel expense from the income
statement, thus overstating earnings (or, in their case, understating losses);
2). They did have two long-term liabilities listed as well: (these numbers are
approximates as I'm doing it from memory) $5.4M in long term debt and $5.4M in
severance charges; 3). They posted a Balance Sheet and an Income Statement, but
no Statement of Cash Flows.

I usually use the Statement of Cash Flows as a reality check on the Income
Statement, how do you cross-check the reported numbers? I have seen many
companies who appear to report minor losses on the income statement, but the
SCF revealed massive bleeding in terms of real cash flow. I'm not saying that
is the case here, just asking: "How would one know?"

Bought CX today.

Reconsidering RTRSY: sell, buy or hold? I am concerned that they don't have a
good plan of returning to profitability. Multex acquisition is not positive in
my mind, since it means that the core company does not have all necessary
ingredients to succeed and is looking for them outside. For established
companies such as RTRSY this usually means a disaster. I.e. I prefer a company
like BRK that buys other companies, because it has too much cash and has to
invest it somewhere. I don't like companies trying to buy their way out of
trouble, since if sinergies don't work, we have a bigger company in bigger
trouble. The price they paid for Multex is also not dirt cheap, i.e. it is not
just buying some assets at great price. On the other hand, with the drop RTRSY
is becoming a buy even if they manage to return to 15% ROE, which is way below
their old ROE. I have not decided what to do yet. Opinions welcome.

ADM. Pass on it. Too expensive.

I'm not going to do an in-depth dd. Gasoline additive rule changes ala
California legislation (ethanol) might be excellent for corn producers or their

will have to comment.

Their management --- they(CEO and son?) were self-serving at one time. I don't
know about now.

Looking backward though, ROE has not been very good these past few years. Based
on the numbers I see and model I use, I wouldn't want to pay more than about
$9.50 for this stock. (It's $11.31 now).

I am beginning to get the impression that stocks are all dropping to a lower
p/e level. (A fear I've had that seems to be coming true.) And that we may have
to live for quite a while with these lower p/e levels. It seems to me as I am
searching for new, "undervalued" opportunities, there are now a ton of good
quality stocks selling for about 12x '03 earnings. That seems - right now - to
be another metric for me. I'm trying to stay below that for anything I'd buy
unless there's some special circumstance. So from what I'm looking at, unless
somebody tells me to look deeper, at best, the most I'd buy ADM for is 12x the
.82 ADM is expected to earn (my Dec. '03 interpolation of Yahoo numbers) or
$9.85. In other words ADM is overvalued by this quick-n-dirty metric too. JMO,

I'll start a position in cruise line RCL.

I haven't done well in this sector. When the players were down because of
overcapacity fears, from the three I looked at, I picked only one, and that one
went bk on me. The other two, RCL and CCL more than doubled.

The stock prices of RCL and CCL have been coming down again. People fearful of
travel, the expense of cruising (maybe), on-board diseases, and still issues of
overcapacity (new ships coming on-line)

I've started a little RCL today. It's cheaper on a p/sales and p/e basis than
the far more dominant player, CCL. CCL being the premier stock - both larger
and better capitalized than RCL. RCL has a significantly higher dividend yield

Started MRN yesterday @9.25. Similar to CCRN in that both are in rent-a-nurse
biz. Dif is MRN focuses more on per-diem [read locally based] & CCRN is big dog
in travel nurse rental [13 week contracts, housing provided to shift supply
from areas where there are willing workers to areas where they are needed].
Both are at very low multiples facing concerns that hospitals are pushing back
on high cost of renting nurses by encouraging part & full timers to extend
hours and increased supply from nurse/spouses of laid-off workers taking more
hours to pay the bills. Both are short-term answers to shortage of nurses that
isn't going away soon-aging nurse workforce, demographics increasing demand.
Here are 4 players in the biz:

I think I would have bought CCL instead of RCL, if i decided to jump into the
cruse ship sector at all. Sure RCL has a lower P/E ratio but also a much higher
leverage. Debt to equity is 1.35 and it looks like this number will increase
due to heavy investments. Interest payments are about 10% of revenues, compared
to 2.5% of CCL.

I generally have put more emphasis on the "quality" of companies I invest
in,than on valuation recently, after jumping into stocks like ELN, EP, MIR and
the like. Measures of "quality" are market share, ROE, leverage, growth,
management. What I found is that investing in "lower quality" and hence cheaper
stocks does not work for me in a bear market. In my opinion, the strongest
companies will recover first when the economy recovers and there will be a
sweet spot when jumping into the 2nd tier companies will be more profitable as
the bull market returns.

Spekulatius: You are likely right. I'll add some comments.

Regarding: "In my opinion, the strongest companies will recover first when the
economy recovers and there will be a sweet spot when jumping into the 2nd tier
companies will be more profitable as the bull market returns."

Perhaps it depends on the particular sector or what is meant by "strongest".
Here's a comparative chart of CCL and RCL:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=ccl&k=c1&t=5y&s=rcl&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

Sometimes RCL has risen more than CCL when both stocks were down. Perhaps
that's when the sweet spot kicked in. Some of this could be attributed to RCL's
increased leverage. If the industry is turning around to prosperity, investors
might guess that RCL will show the greatest gains (per earnings improvement and
ROE) and so this stock might be the one to bet on if the sector comes into
favor. OTOH, maybe not. When both stocks drop,it looks like RCL is often
dropping further and taking longer to recover. That's not so good.

My experience with this sector mirrors the results I've often got before. Which
is, given a choice among several, if I pick one, I pick the wrong one. So now
that these two stocks are again down near lows, I shall attempt to do what I
believe I should have done before and that is to buy the package. I have a
starter position in RCL. As I see CCL come down a little, I'll buy it also.

I've mentioned I'm using this tactic with other sectors too. For example, I
have a position in auto retailers -- small positions in several companies like
UAH, SAH, GPH. Here the stocks seem low on a number of financial ratios, but
it's impossible for me to determine which might be the better or best
investment. (I am assuming there is an investment opportunity in the sector,
and I could be wrong about that as well.)

With this tactic I expect I will forgo some gains by not searching for the
"best" stock in the category. However, at this point, where any gains are hard
to come by for me, I'd settle for obtaining the average that might be achieved
from an improvement in this presumed undervalued sector.

jmo, and I offer no good data to substantiate the efficacy of this tactic.

Paul, I posted this recently back on the CFZ, but I thought the gang here would
find it interesting. The sector leader of the natural gas companies, APA, is
making new highs, and many of the other large caps are showing strength in a
weak market.

Energy : Part 1. 2000-2001 - A proxy for 2003-2004.
In the span of about 14 months, from Early 2000 to Spring of 2001, the XNG rose
from 120 to 260, and the OSX from 75 to 140. It was a breathtaking boom,
comparable in my mind only to the gold run beginning in late 02. A similar
opportunity in energy is at hand.

What was the prime mover of the 00-01 boom? Soaring NG prices.

Benifitting from high commodity prices were first the explorers and producers
of energy (e&p) - names such as Apache, Anadakro (represented by the xng). The
direct recipient of surging cash flow were the the oil service companies (osx)
- Diamond Offshore, Transocean, etc. The end result was a boom in both the
explorers and in the oil service companies. This boom peaked in the winter of
2001, where soaring ng prices precipitated demand destruction and mediated a ng
crash (and along with the commodity, the xng & osx).

Because of both demand destruction and a modest increase in ng supply as a
result of a drilling boom, NG builds came in larger than usual in the Spring of
2001, prompting me to perform an abrupt reversal of my position on energy as
reflected in my May 5th post stating one should "short everything energy in
sight." A crash began in late May 2001 and completed its carnage in fall of 02.

We are now again in the first innings of a bull, where commodity prices have
risen in response to concerns over ng storage. Well documented is the fact the
supply has again fallen, as it did in 1999-2000.
http://www.oilviews.homestead.com/files/Production_Lehman_Q4.. .

But in the first innings, equity values have not yet begun to fully appreciate
that such a fall in supply has implications for commodity prices well into
2003. Current valuations suggest some market disbelief that commodity prices
will remain high beyond this season. Using 2000 as a proxy, the more likely
course of events will be smaller than normal builds and increasing concern over
winter 2003-04. That is the recipe, as it was in 2000, for a energy equity
bull.

This is nothing but a seat of the pants comment, but as much as I'm somewhat
bullish long term on the cruise industry, I'm skeptical from a personal
perspective. We (five of us) are scheduled to cruise on 3/16, that may be the
time that war breaks out. We have talked about what we would do in that
instance, or maybe that would be decided for us (i.e. cancellation, in the
worst case). We could back out, and face a relatively small, but not
insignificant, penalty, as we have insurance. This we are considering. I
suspect we are not the only ones.
To show you my mind set, I am a big long time bull on LUV, and have done very
well on the long side in the past. I tried to grab a short on LUV the other day
at a higher price.
I just don't think that being long in the travel business is where you want to
be in the current climate.
Another factor with RCL is its significant exposure to the European market in
the summer, which is very soft - Princess has already repositioned one of its
mega-ships (I believe Grand Princess) from Europe to the Caribbean.
Overcapacity via large new build activity has been well documented, as well.
Just my .02. And, were the current climate to lift, you very well might have
great long positions.

I have owned ADM forever and have a core position - this position is tax free
distributions. This is a family thing as my father did business with the boys
that started ADM during the years they were located in Minneapolis. I agree
with your take on lower P/E levels. When ADM gets sold off in the $9's or lower
I have bought and sold when the position gets over priced. We had an
opportunity to buy in the 8's a few years ago and I bought some and sold it
last year in the high 14's. There is better return in the ADM investment than
meets the eye. When the stock is cheap the company buys back their stock and
does a tax free stock distribution over and above the dividend to stock
holders.

You could stretch for yield using a small percent of your capital with NAT,

New Idea --- CHIC

I found this one when I did a fresh screening recently. Looking for the usual,
ROE>PE, low debt, insider buying, don't sell tobacco, no asbestos, etc.

Charlotte Russe Holding Inc. is a mall-based specialty retailer of fashionable,
value-priced apparel and accessories targeting young women between the ages of
15 and 35.

http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=CHIC&script=700&layout=1

stock price $10
ROE 18% 1 year, 26% 5 year.
EPS historical growth rate 16%
P/E 10 +/-
No debt

EPS history 2001=0.92, 2002=0.95, outlook 2003=1.03 (my guess)
analysts say 1.05 in 2003, 1.28 in 2004.

They've been opening stores manically since 1998. 20-50 per year. 52 in 2001,
63 in 2002, 75 planned this year. So sales have been obviously increasing, and
EPS to a slower rate. 5 year EPS growth 16%, 2002 was low at 3%, next year
might be 10%. When the economy kicks in, it could be higher.

"While it is important to evaluate the near-term results and earnings guidance,
we should be careful not to overlook the long-term growth opportunities for our
business. We plan to open 75 new stores during fiscal 2003, a 30% increase in
store count, funded entirely with internally generated cashflow. We have a
strong balance sheet with $33 million of cash as of December 2002 and no
long-term debt. With average cashflow from new stores continuing to produce
cash returns on investment of over 80% in their first year of operation,
reinvestment of our cashflow back into the business represents an appropriate
business strategy," the Chief Executive concluded.
http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=CHIC&script=400&layout=1

Compensation might be a little generous on the options, but they are
wonderfully out of the money right now. The 2002 options granted were 90,000
shares at $12,87 and 60,000 shares at $10.18.

http://biz.yahoo.com/p/c/chic.html

this is worth studying:
http://yahoo.marketguide.com/MGI/mg.asp?target=/stocks/companyinformation/ratio
Ticker=CHIC

the story:
http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=CHIC&script=2100&layout=
1

This one seems nice. They are making money, significantly growing store base
using cash flow, EPS growing a bit while awaiting the economy, no debt, nice
history, good story. I bought more than an opening position.

Grommit

PS -- I wonder what the upside is? The analysts have a range of $1.10 to $1.40
for 2004. (But that doesn't mean anything, because even corporate outlooks have
been proven to be unreliable.) I'd guess $1.15 with no sweat, higher if the
economy improves. Let's give them a better PE of 15 on that $1.15, and we have
a target price of $17. Downside $.90 EPS at PE of 10 = $9.

Question to anyone on covered calls experience..

Two weeks ago I sold Feb covered calls, 7.50 strike, on a stock selling for
7.68.. for .35 per contract.

When I've done this in the past I've been willing to have the shares taken from
me and pocket the premium.. then re-enter another trade. Indeed I do this with
a lot stocks and the returns can be consistent if one is fortunate to time
things right and get out if things turn.

The odd thing about this particular trade (and my question) is that the
underlying security rose to 8.15 on Friday and my account today shows the stock
still in hand.. the option's closing price Friday was .65 but nothing has been
done.

I assume Monday I should see the contract having expired not exercised (my
stock not called), and the premium I received still credited to my account, and
the stock shares still in my portfolio. Or has anyone had to wait for Monday to
see that indeed the stock was called. Or put another way how often are in the
money calls not called and what's the differential threshold.. I'd have assumed
a premium of .65 would have triggered it automatically.

thanks in advance

Note.. from a definitions site:

"After the option's expiration date, the contract will cease to exist. At that
point the owner of the option who does not exercise the contract has no "right"
and the seller has no "obligations" as previously conveyed by the contract."

So I'm assuming I lucked out a little on this particular trade and will keep
the price increase in the stock and the premium for selling the calls..

Energy Master Limited Partnerships

Does anyone have experience and/or insights with these?

Apparently, energy companies go into partnership with retail investors,
converting assets such as pipelines into a pure income-based products, with the
energy company serving as the general partner, and investors serving as limited
partners. Many trade on the NYSE.

These investments have some interesting properties:
(i) High yield 6%-9%
(ii) Partial (around 80%) tax deference on dividends
(iii) Decent historical growth of dividends (2%-4%)

They also entail some risks and complications
(i) Investors have to file a K-1 with IRS.
(ii) Some of the general parterns are in bad shape (El Paso comes to mind)
(iii) In some cases, the general partner receives lucrative fees that may
motivate them to not act in the best interest of the limited partners.

Allen, <<Any ideas on how to play a bet on bond yields increasing?

I have thought about this problem and have not found a perfect way to deal with
it. Here are some of my thought processes.

If one keeps capital in short term debt instruments and keep rolling it you
would be behind the curve on bond yields the time frame you are rolling the
debt.

If the increase in bond yields come from foreigners selling US debt the dollar
should take a serious hit. If during this period you own foreign debt the value
of the debt will go up if the currency you hold these bonds goes up as the US
dollar declines. The cash flow or stream of revenues from these bonds would
translate positively for the US owner as it is converted into US dollars as
they are paid or one could keep a foreign currency account to hold this cash
flow or any other capital.

Gold and Platinum seem to have been the metal currency of choice during the
recent decline in the US dollar. One could buy the metals or stocks in
companies that mine the metals. Most metals have increased in US dollars terms
and one could own a fund that tracks the CRB index. QRACX is one fund, but the
fees are high. Pimco has one for administrative accounts, but I have heard they
will let you in if you send the money to them directly.

You can look at the charts of FCO, FAX, GIM, BEGBX and PSAFX to get an idea of
the increase in value of owning foreign debt during the recent US dollar
decline against other currencies.

When one shorts these instruments you have to pay dividends to the person who
loaned you the shares. Also, a lot of brokerage houses charge you interest on
the margin. This is a high cost. One would have to get out the old spread sheet
and see if you could make a buck. If some of these instruments have options
that could be less expensive, but your timing has to be right.
