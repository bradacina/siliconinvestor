Mike: re FINL vs. Z

P/bv .65 .8

psr .39 .15

d/e .0 .51

sales .5b 5.2b

profit margin 5.4% 1.7%

Not an easy call for me.
Venator -- Footlocker -- has many more locations. Not as profitable. More debt.
Not sure why profit margin difference seems so big. If 5.4% is sustainable or
if Z can increase their to better than 1.7%. I think it'll be some fight among
all these chains. Paul

My reasons for FINL over Z was mainly the lack of any LT debt, the substantial
cash position (which they've largely spent down by retiring at least 4% of
their shares the last two months), and the, IMO, greater growth potential (in
terms of they have a lot of stores to open before they hit FL's level, and I
don't see any reason why they couldn't do that). I understand management at
FINL is supposed to be good (or at least for some reason the Fool thinks so)
and I think they've been doing a good job of expanding the concept with the
bigger superstores, while still controlling inventory. How they open stores
with over 120 pairs on display and shrink inventory per square foot by over
20%, I don't know, but it sounds good, and any good news with a 2/3 book value
and no debt is almost reason enough for me. My position is small and hopefully
I can add to it later with my Amazon.com profits ;-)

Speaking of "blue-blooded contrarian" can anyone here stomach a
look at Japan? Here's a comment I pulled from Reuters:

''The fundamentals just aren't there,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager of
equities at Nikko Securities, who believes the world's second-largest economy
is all but assured of contracting again in 1999. ''It is not possible to be
optimistic.''

I just don't understand it well enough, and am more likely to throw my next

E. Newman: VVTV. Yes, I saw the move.

Congratulations to you, sir! I understand you've followed VVTV for several
years, so I hope you've got what you wanted from it today. Thanks for bringing
it to the attention of the thread here when it was a value stock (I thought it
was a value then, anyway.)

In my opinion, I've erred in selling it. I had a very good gain - about a
double I think, and with the euphoria of internet stocks, I guess I just should
have held to see what developed. The stock wasn't likely (it seems now in
retrospect -g-) to have dropped much.

As I say, I've been wrong many, many times before. I've got stocks that crater
on me -- APM, PFG, UC, etc. I've got stocks that I've taken a round trip on --
JPM, JCP, etc. And I've got stocks that I've been selling too soon -
SUNW,FLEX,BMY, etc. And those etc. etc. etc. parts are really painful too!

With stocks that are purchased as value stocks, I agree with Jim Clarke's
observation that they sometimes seem to spike about 40% at once (if I recall
his comment correctly) and then, promptly, they oftentimes recede. So it
behooves the value investor to act (sell) promptly.

With VVTV, we're likely not dealing with an undervalued stock that's become
fully valued-- but rather with an undervalued stock that's
thought/alledged/promulgated/touted now as a super growth vehicle. That's a
change I didn't really understand (and maybe is more hype than reality.)

Sometimes with undervalued stocks, there's a reason why the stock rises -- the
problem gets fixed, new management looks to be effective, business cycle turns,
and so on. So as things look good, the stock becomes fully valued. Then, as a
value investor, I seem to be selling into an outlook that has become bright and
shiny. Easy enough to sell when I don't know why the stock has moved up. But
when things are looking good for obvious reasons, who wants to sell? (That is,
why sell if outlook is so good?) But as value investors, sell we should (IMO).
That's what I do and did. Sure looks to me though in hindsight as an obvious
mistake with VVTV. My error du jour I guess. Paul Senior

I agree with you that investing in Japan is a worthwhile contrarian play. I
bought the WEBS for Japan (EWJ) on the ASE. It is the Morgan Stanley index that
trades like a stock. Also, the WEBS can be shorted without having to have a
preceding uptick. EWJ is trading around 10 and that seems to be at the bottom
since more bad news such as recently announced rising unemployment did not
depress the index any further. The government is launching a $500 billion
economic stimulus package in the coming year. The bankrupt banks are slowly
starting to be closed. I'm not sure when Japanese stocks will rise but they
surely will and EWJ seems to be a good place to be without having to guess
which individual stocks to buy.

You might want to reconsider shorting the Internets. Not because they are not
overvalued but for precisely that reason. I do not believe that anyone thinks
internets are fairly valued. You would be hard pressed to make a case for 10%
of their current value - which is precisely the problem. I believe that
everyone knows this which is why the contrarian play (imo) is to sit by the

generate some kind of cash flow model to prove it.

Jim, glad to see we're of the same opinion. I've actually spent some time
looking at Amazon.com, and thinking about its model, and I'm pretty confident
in what we've done. Re: it being the contrarian thing to do, I don't know many
doing it. I expect that a lot of people are holding off to the new year to bail
(and hence avoid the immediate tax hit on their gains); these are not long-term
holders, but people who bought at 150 and saw their stock more than double in a
short time. I can't imagine but that they'd be wanting to head for the doors
once 1998's books are closed. The business economics stink, and once the
trading momentum swings, I don't see any fundamental floor at all until we hit
about 50. How many funds will keep it on the books for windowdressing but head
for the doors in January? I'm thinking quite a few.

Timberland didn't give you much of a chance to get in (where my front-running
actually got me the better price :)). I bought that one on less than 30 minutes
of analysis because I thought the margin of safety was gargantuan. Like Deswell
at 6. Now it's like Deswell at 8. There's still a MOS there, but you gotta be
ready to take an immediate 25% hit and hold longer-term. FINL, well, glad it
reacted like it did to a crummy report.

BTW, I did add ELAMF and UBB to my positions today on the long side.
They are Graham-like in their margin of safety as well. UBB could conceivably
go to 7 again, but I'd just buy more.

Seems to me that we'll see the internet stocks fall off starting next week. No
one wanting to take profits just before year end. My guess is that once the
selling starts, free fall. Shorts look like a good move to me, but... Crazy
market.

I have been following Japan and feel the Nikkei to be overpriced. Japan is at
least 3 years away from recovery, likely 5 or more. There's more bad news
coming. At 115 range on the yen they cannot export their way out of trouble and
they have no domestic demand. I decided to leave Japan to the Pros.

JWG - Next to Deswell my most profitable investment. It is definitely
undervalued at current price - about 60% of BV - with no debt and a cash
surplus. I've been buying both JWG and DSWLF seeing very little downside on
either and current price due purely to tax loss selling.

Someone on this thread mentioned DSTM, which doesn't use the criteria most on

up off the lows yesterday on big volume. It has a very good looking balance
sheet, and perhaps the tax loss selling has been washed. No position, just
adding to what one person kindly posted.
Also, does anyone follow Schlotzky's Deli (BUNZ), which one would suspect has
also been a victim of tax loss selling. They reported SSS yesterday, which
appeared not too bad, trades at about BV with a sound balance sheet. Has anyone
dined at their stores, or follow the stock.
I'll attempt to get research on these two companies.

Yes Wallace. I wouldn't justifying buying this time of year because of tax loss

effect. But if the stock is beat up enough that I think it's undervalued --
once I come to that conclusion, I don't want to let extraneous circumstances --
market dropping, end-of-year, etc. deter me from establishing a position.

Furthermore, I think I am in the process of also learning not to SELL just for
tax consequences (at any time of year). Seems like loser stocks for me which I
sell to offset gainers -- often these losers make their comeback. I would've
been financially better off if I held on to them rather than go for reducing

year even, but I count at least one year - the only year I tried to play it -
as a successful January effect play. Once again this year, I'm heavy

Wright Sullivan is the first mention of DSTM that I recall. After looking into

I don't think this fits this thread's criterion for value, but _relative_ (and
"relative" valuations have to be judged more carefully) to the ERP software
space valuations, this is about as cheap as I've seen a solid company sell.
High market share and rapid rev growth indicate they're still strong and
growing. If they get much cheaper they usually have serious problems. DSTM has

Shane-

We got flat-out lucky, with DSTM up about 25% in three days. Who knows, maybe
we nailed the bottom (I'd better hush or Mr. Market will make me regret that
bit of wishful thinking).

To those interested-

Most of the DSTM discussion between Shane and myself was off-thread in private
messages, so as to not be an annoyance. And I don't know any way to retrieve
most of our thoughts now that they've slipped into the ether.

But I think DSTM has a lot of upside left, and it is a straightforward
business. If DSTM has serious problems, I haven't seen them yet. For those
willing to consider value in the software arena, this is one worth looking at.

Even on a good day, though, the market can play tricks on you. Today, DSTM is
up 15%, but CHKPF, the stock I sold to buy DSTM, is also up 15%. I guess the
moral is: Don't be smug, and ignore short-term movements.

Happy new year to all and thanks again for the thought-provoking discussions in
1998. Maybe even my "official dirt cheap value stock" (CNSO) will start shaking
its tassels in 1999.

I see, and I hope this tactic works. Since I'm riding with you on some of those
stocks - ELAMF, TIE, LHO, UBB, MWY -- and I believe I purchased most, if not
all, at higher prices than you-- I surely would like to see a bounce too. Not
sure a bounce would get me into plus territory with these, but I hope we get
that bounce nonetheless.

My screens show that today's market action was very positive for a large number
of small cap stocks. Lots of green-on-da-screen. This is also reflected by some
of the posts here, and in other stock-specific threads which I am reading. So
maybe we will see a continuation - bounce- in the next few days.

re ELAMF: Man, IMHO, if ever a stock deserved a bounce it would be this stock.
Low valuation or discount because it's a Mexican company -- that I think I
understand and accept. But at current price- either the company is teetering on
the brink due to some yet-to-be-explained cause (somebody knows something and
is selling), or else value investing only applies north of the border. That's
my opinion only, but jeez, even Paul Klemencic has bought -- and he --like Jim
C and Warren&Charlie -- NEVER misses. (Again IMO -g-). Not touting the stock
(or Paul or Jim -g-, and not to slight Ron Bower or the other value guys who've
bought)-- just venting an ELAMF stockholder's frustration. Anyone reading this
thread for a while has come across ELAMF and had a chance to evaluate for
themselves. So far, avoiding it has been the correct choice.

Ah well, '98 is history now, time to reset and start afresh. Looking forward to

Regarding Schlotzky's Deli (BUNZ): I saw it for the first time last month while

the soup and sandwich and was very impressed. It's all in the bread, something
you just can't understand until you have tasted it. And I know form my other
travels that many places don't have a Schlotzky's yet, so there is room for
growth. They are not competing directly with the burger joints or the more
expensive dinner type restaurants. The low p/e and book ratios provide a margin
of safety if growth doesn't pan out at 20%. The national ad campaign this
spring should boost awareness, among customers and stock buyers. The accounting
issues are complex, but Value Line says not to worry, and I do see a lot of
cash and little debt. There are few accounting difficulties that cash can't
solve. Normally I think restaurants and specialty retailers are too risky, but

some mistake. Have you followed Morgan Products (MGN)? At about 2.50 I thought
it was undervalued. Now they announce they are buying a company about the same
size as them using bank debt. Now it's at 3.50. I figure if you double the size
of the company, you should double the price, right? Maybe the discount is due
to the fact that the deal is not yet complete, or no one is back from vacation

CBOE showed stock at 321 1/4 and yzzmf(Jan 330 put) at 32 1/8 for last on
12/31. Assuming these are approximately correct the Jan 330 put has 8 3/4
intrinsic value(330-321 1/4) and 23 3/8 time value(32 1/8-8 3/4) This huge time
value for a ten day option is quite appropriate because of the extreme stock
volatility. If the stock rises above 330 your put expires. You are protected
above 330 by the time value, ie 23 3/8, so your break even point is crossed at
353 1/8. Remember your total sales proceeds were 321 1/4 plus 32 1/8 or 353
3/8. You lose above that price, but holding during the daily volatility is a
lot easier.(at least for me). If your analysis is correct and stock does
fall(or stays below 330) your profits are limited to time value, ie you are put
the stock to buy at 330 but your initial proceeds were 353 3/8.

Another possibility for a bearish bet on an Internet stock
would be to open a bear spread, using either puts or calls.
The risk is well-defined, and the fact that you are selling
one option and buying another (in the case of a bear put
spread, buying the higher strike and selling the lower one)
helps offset the fact that the options are so pricey. Of
course, a spread also limits your potential rewards.

Shorting these stocks has nearly unlimited risk, and as
Michael Burke (and probably others) have said, if something
is overvalued by a factor of 10, there is no reason for it
to go to overvalued by a factor of 20, 40, etc.

I have no position in any of these stocks, but find the

Thread,

On foreign investing-

I have most of my money in HK/China equities. I have looked at other foreign
markets and determined this to be the lowest risk with the largest potential.

The one factor that caused me to avoid equities in other countries was the
necessity of not only determining the value and potential of the company, but
to research other items that might effect the investment. I singled out
HK/China because the currencies are pegged to the $US, favorable tax
incentives, and some other factors.

Suppose one now finds an under valued company in Japan. If bought with the yen
at 115, the performance of the company is less critical than the prospects of
the yen going to 140 or higher. A 20% company growth could be eliminated by a
20% currency devaluation. By the same token, a stronger yen would increase the
value of the holding. By making an investment, one must determine not only that
the company will be successful, but that the yen will not decline and that
Japan's high corporate tax rate or other political/social factors won't be
detrimental to the investment.

An example of the problems one faces: ELAMF (Mexico) had long stated that a
devaluation of the peso would lower their costs and make them more competitive.
The peso dropped from 7.80/$US to over 10.00. It lowered ELAMF's costs but it
also caused a huge tax from currency gains on $US they held in the bank. This
resulted in a major reduction in earnings.

An extreme example - A little over a year ago the Russian market was selling at
a huge discount to value. Today those companies are at much higher value in
roubles, but are almost worthless in $US.

A recent report indicates that Asian markets would have been the place to
invest a year ago. In local currency they have shown minimal improvement, but
in $US, the gains were substantial. Had one invested in Japan a year ago, they
would have seen minor improvement in the yen value of the stock, but would have
had substantial $US gains in value because the yen improved from 140 to 115.
Japanese investors that fled to the US markets have suffered losses for this
same reason.

IMO there are some excellent opportunities for investment in foreign equities
but it requires extensive research on risk determination well beyond the amount
required for investing in the US.

Ron

Zach Eitzen: My opinion is that you never want to short a stock just because it
is overvalued. Too many examples of the stock just doubling from an already
grossly overvalued price. Classic example, IMO, would be Resort Int'l in the
'70's - the first Atlantic City Casino I believe- and was thought to be run by
the mob and thought to be a joke or scam company. A very large short position
discussed a couple or more times in Barron's by Robert Wilson (his logical
argument was impeccable!)- a very well known "value" investor at the time -
eventually creamed him ($20 million worth I think) and all who followed him
into it after reading Barron's. (aside: He claimed later that professionals
read the article and bought the stock to run him out. That resulted in the
common practice today of professional investors refusing to divulge publicly
the shorts they have on.) More recently IOM burned plenty, I'd guess. Probably
DELL too.

With overvalued stocks, we think these stocks will eventually regress.
(Although as mentioned here by Wayne Crimi -- that's a dangerous assumption
because sometimes earnings can indeed rise to support the 'overvalued' price).
What's needed, IMO, is some methodology that can be shown to have some high
likelihood of success. I don't know of any such - possibly it would link
factors such as insider sales, recent stock splits, rate of change in stock
price over stock's beta, % drop from high.

This would be for only a small amount of an investor's money -- fun money
maybe. As I've posted here many times- IMO shorting is a strange and dangerous
and insidious game. It really should be left to either very sophisticated
investors or very inexperienced beginners. (It's really the only way for a
beginner to understand how insidious- once he/she's tried shorting a few
times.) Paul Senior

On shorting Amazon, it is my experience that you never short a bad stock but
only a bad company. An overpriced stock can become a lot more overpriced before
you are proven right. (If fundamentals are deteriorating, that would be a
different story.)

However, these Internet stocks do smell like the top in the oil stocks in late

(If fundamentals are deteriorating, that would be a different story.)

That's my understanding of Amazon.com. Debt, losing more money the
more it sells. A cutthroat industry being made more cutthroat, with
no barriers to entry.

Hey, I buy all my books from Amazon.com - I just link to it from my web site,
buy it, and as an associate I get an extra 15% off in addition to the 30% or so
below retail, and no taxes. My mom also buys her books there. I questioned her
about it - only reason for her actions: it's cheaper. Is there anything special
about the site? The layout? No, in fact it's kind of confusing. Why couldn't
Yahoo just start selling books, CD's, etc directly? Wouldn't that cut into
Amazon's business? Of course. Would Yahoo do this? Well, Yahoo's not
necessarily a bad business, just an overpriced stock, and I think Yahoo's more
sensible than to enter such a competitive industry. I see obviously horrible
dynamics like Iomega's. IOM had explosive sales in a horrible industry - data
storage. So people priced it ridiculously, thinking one day everyone will have
a zip. Well, ok, that happened, but is IOM a good business? Is it's stock a
good stock anymore? No. Its competitors are willing to go bankrupt undercutting
it on price. Amazon.com's sole benefit is is its low prices, and hey, an
industry that competes on price only...

I don't believe for a second Amazon.com will become THE place to shop on the
internet, yet this is already priced into the stock, as people continue to
ignore the horrible business economics, so I feel I am indeed shorting an
overpriced stock of a bad business.

BTW, I've put up a new web site - ValueStocks.net - at you guessed
it http://www.valuestocks.net . I'm still working on it, but the basics are up.
Feedback welcome, especially from the posters here. Of course, ironically, I'm

Mike-

Related to your Amazon thoughts: Did you see the article in the latest Fortune
magazine (1/11/99, page 150) about Buy.com? They sort of take the lowest-cost
web seller concept to the ultimate extreme and sell everything below cost,
theoretically making all their money from advertising (or something like that).

Here's a link from Fortune's web site:

http://www.pathfinder.com/fortune/technology/gurley/index.html

I felt like I was in the twilight zone, or a News of the Weird column while
reading it. I don't think it was a joke. It was a lot like that Saturday Night
Live fake ad from a few years ago, about a bank which did nothing but change
money for customers, two tens for a twenty, etc. The very serious narrator
asked, "How can we make money this way? Simple: Volume". A riot, but truth is
stranger than fiction once again.

No discussion needed on this, but it illustrates just how cutthroat pricing on
the internet is and will be.

January.)

Unfortunately, cutthroat pricing on the Internet has adverse implications for
companies with fixed assets selling stuff in malls and elsewhere. Over the
longer term, as people get more comfortable with computers and Internet
shopping, the traditional retail business
model will become more difficult as a greater percentage will be window
shopping with items purchased on the Internet once the desired choice has been
identified. (But note that Barnes and Noble just opened a superstore about a

Mike, I would have to change my comment a bit to say that a sound short is a
vastly overpriced stock where the fundamentals are deteriorating AND ARE
GENERALLY PERCEIVED TO BE DETERIORATING. It is quite plain from the chart that
the latter is not now the case. If you wait for that to happen you might short
at 250 with a far higher probability that it is going to 50 and a far lower
probability that it might go to 500 -- in other words, with a larger expected
return than by shorting it now.

Be careful. I remember well the earlier Resorts International reference. The

I'm sure that value hounds have noticed Novacare's p/e of 3, p/s of .10, low

low, but how much of their book is tangible, i.e. really worth something? I
seem to remember a lot of goodwill from the last time I was owned it. Price to
sales would be hard to fake. Earnings are supposed to be okay next year, but
they are so hard to predict, I'm not trying. Value investors don't need crystal
balls, right? I've heard there are convertible bonds to pay off in the near

In a day like today, when I'd guess value investors are selling or standing by,
I am still finding things I like.

Added today to NOC (Northrup). Co. announced lower than analysts-expected
earnings. The company says they will earn closer to $6 per sh in '99. That's a
pe of 11 at current price. Too low IMO. (Although this latest announcement from
management is the second warning -- how credible might these guys be???). PSR
compared to previous years is high, p/bv looks like it's maybe midrange. At
least two analyst downgrades. One analyst estimates recently approved $100B
dollar bill will go mostly to upgrade current troop equipment/pay. Not that
much for high tech (Northrup-like) programs. Wild Card for me: Sabre rattling
from N. Korea is intensifying mightily (that's IMO--maybe I'm just becoming
more aware). These guys play a serious brinkmanship game. If ever there is "a
problem", defense will come back. ps. Doesn't Mr. Buffett have a large in GD?
(rhetorical) I'll try more NOC.

Added to my small position in United Cos. Financial (UC). A big loser for me.
This company may go under. But at current price, it's an attractive bet for me.

You have to wonder why rates (long term 5+) are increasing when the fed is

Well, the money has got to go somewhere and since the increase in supply is

NEW YORK (CNNfun) - Pioneering online retailer Amazon.com played Pied Piper to
an Internet-sector rally Friday, surging more than 19 percent on the Nasdaq
after a prominent Wall Street brokerage firm changed its target price from $133
per share from December 16th to a formula-based target of 1.333x the closing
price of the previous trading day. As of Thursday's close, the target price for
Friday was set at $211 1/4 per share, but that figure is expected to jump
dramatically on Monday and all subsequent trading days of this century.

Henri Bloodlet, an analyst with CICU Openweiner, set the moving target shortly
after trading opened Friday.

In a research report issued Thursday, Bloodlet said he had based the upward
revision on the company's enormous success in expanding its share price since
his last report in December, and also suggested that Amazon's unprofitable days
are a finite number rather than in infinite number as previously suggested.

"We continue to believe that Amazon.com is in the early stages of building a
global community of billionaires that could rule that planet," Bloodlet wrote
in the report.>>

I am convinced that this period is going to end very badly for most investors.
If I am correct, I will get some intangible satisfaction from knowing that I

Well, tracking that Jan effect. My portfolio as posted on
my website was more or less my second experiment with playing
the Jan effect - just about every stock had the potential to
bounce. And it is happening. I'm up 9.50% so far this month.
Yeah, I know, Amazon.com has already nearly doubled again, and
anyone in internet stocks would be doing better than me. But
the Nasdaq is only up a little over 6%, and it's had a heck of
a run since the year started. So with my diversified portfolio
of relatively unknown, unheralded, huh-at-the-cocktail-party stocks,
I feel that my gain so far is real, and that the Jan effect is
in fact still working - so far. Just saying that yes the individual
investor can still benefit from this oft-heralded, oft-disparaged
phenomenon, and value investors are likely the ones most capable of
taking advantage of it, IMO.

Good investing,
Mike

Michael and all take a look at this.

30% of book.
20% of sales
7 times earnings.
3 times operating cash flow.

An "oil services" stock. (That's why it is down.) But is this company's
earnings really related to the price of oil? You tell me.

Amazon....

I have lost a ton of money shorting Amazon since June. I was up some in
September. Last week I finally gave up.

When I shorted at $32 split adjusted I said I can hang on even if this
ridiculous stock triples.

I gave up when it had quintupled.

AMZN's price has risen 20-fold this year ... another nine-fold in 15 years (per
the Cramer piece) is possible, yes.

Is another nine-fold this year possible?

I swear to God, I do not know. The concepts around which I structure my
perceptions have been shattered and none remain at the moment.

Today AMZN's market cap is greater than Norway's - tomorrow ??? Greater than
Jamaica? Japan?

I write disjointedly to demonstrate how shattering these events can be to one's
own good sense.

I agree about buying LEAP puts, high-priced though they may be.

From your guys' readings, what historical episode most closely approximates the
internet mania?

Peter

If every day Amazon rise by 33%, re Blodgett, then by the end of the year all
the money in the world will be in margin accounts to support AMZN holdings.

The one historical bubble that comes to mind, and I have previously posted

Paul,

Couple of differences:

1. IOM was making money from introduction of Zip onwards.
2. Its ROE was/is(?) pretty good.
3. Its PSR, PE was not that outrageous.
4. It had (and still has) a proprietary solution to
removable storage.
5. It never had high debt/equity. I did not realize
that certain Internet company has a lot of
debt. Or should I say it has no equity?

Maybe that's why IOM did not drop to 0.

Oh yeah, Internet companies have no overhead. That
explains it. I am buying 1000 shares of AMZN on Monday.
:-)))) :-P

Well gentlemen it is clear that sooner or later amazon will creash bigtime

Microsoft? Assuming that it will crash and lose 80-90% of its valuation, what
is the best way to play it? how expensive are puts these these days? Is it
possible to set a fixed dollar loss and just buy puts every three months for

Hi Jurgis. Oh, there are differences for sure. There are always differences.
But what about the similarities?

It's a mania in both cases.

Run up 10x in about a year.
Fanatic bulls.
Revolutionary product or service

Sceptical media gives logical counter arguments:
(Book business is not that profitable, Barnes&Noble buy their distributor; no
barrier to
entry for internet companies)
and for IOM:
No lock on technology (optical is coming). Quality problems.
No evidence that businesses are buying in bulk. Price assumes very heavy market
penetration. Who really needs or wants back up Jaz?

Media event. Articles every day in the paper. Especially the fight between
bulls and bears. Media mavens say stock is overpriced-- stay away.
My favorites re IOM: entitled something like "Those millionaire Joes/Janes who
bought early. What they are doing with their money and what they are buying
now."
(I've not seen such stories with AMZN.... yet)

Conclusion to be drawn from media (or maybe what I think the media is
concluding for us)-- the longs are going to get killed and the shorts will win
out.

But the BIG similiarity question--- (-g-)----> Is there a point in time at
which the shorts take over from the longs -the point where AMZN should be
shorted if we intended to short-- if that point exists, might that point be
similar for AMZN as it was for IOM?? Can we identify that point??

Re: amazon, I found last night that I still have that short position.
Due to a snafu re: the split and my online broker, I only bought
back 1/3 of my position, when I thought that I was closing the short.
Good thing I didn't know this when it hit 200 - saved myself an ulcer. But for
now I still have the short. Mixed feelings on that
but whatever I do I'm not covering at the market open. I'll have to

Paul,

> Is there a point in time at which

In case of IOM, it broke when it did not
deliver revenue and earnings growth. AMZN does not
have earnings, so it may break down on revenue
growth slowdown. AMZN got onto the annualized $1 bln.
sales last year. BKS has approximately $2.7 bln. annual
sales. Assuming that AMZN does not take over other
retail markets (CDs, PCs, beanie babies, etc.),
and that it grows to BKS revenue, and that it has
to deliver 50% revenue growth per quarter to satisfy
the "investors", it will take another year for it to
reach the BKS sales. So in this case there will not
be a disappointment this year. However, this model
is totally baseless. The break may come much earlier
or a bit later. If you really want to short it,
wait for the disappointment to happen and act then.
You will lose ~20-50 points, but you may make money.

On the other hand, if you compare
Internet to biotech bubbles you'll notice
that these break totally on investor sentiment.
But they usually don't have neither earnings,
nor revenues, so it's a bit different game.

BTW, in all questions of shorting, consult
John G (http://www.siliconinvestor.com/profile.aspx?userid=93590).
He is a professional hedger, and his threads
on high-flyers and broken stocks are excellent
reads. Personally, I'd rather short broken stock
than a high-flyer. But then, I wouldn't short at all. ;-)

Good luck

>>"From your guys' readings, what historical episode most closely

I have never seen or heard of anything like the aggregate financial asset
bubble that we are experiencing at present. The internet leaves me speechless.
Japan in 89 is similar. Stocks may have been higher in Japan. There is a
difference though. Japan was and is a large creditor nation with a large
current account surplus. The U.S. is the mirror image. This means that when our
bubble bursts, the dollar may be vulnerable to collapse too.

I don't know Wayne, I used to be in your camp, but when people like Abby Joseph
Cohen, who was bearish in 1990 and Byron Wien, who's no Polyanna, aren't
particularly bearish, I wonder if maybe the market as a whole is in fact not
too high? If you take away the best performers of the S&P 500 I'm not sure that
p/e s as a whole are totally outrageous. P/Es of small caps aren't that high,
are they?

Right now I'm in "special situations" so it doesn't make a lot of difference to
me what the market does, unless there is a melt down of all equities (which I
guess can never be ruled out).

Interesting to juxtapose AMZN and TCMS

AMZN trades at 130x year 2010 earnings, and only if all goes according to plan.
Meanwhile TCMS will consistently throw off 1/3 to 1/2 of its market
capitalization in cash annually between now and 2010.

I suppose the idea of investing in companies as opposed to stocks has gone
totally out the window.

$199 sure looks like that "island in the sky" characteristic of a short squeeze
climax top. The stock opens up 25, goes to up 40 and closes nearly unchanged on
much larger than normal trading volume. Terrible price action. Time will tell.

I would agree that a broken stock is a much safer short.

AMZN isn't broken unless it: (i) fails a second time at or under 200, and (ii)
closes below 150 within a few days following the failure.

Fellows: Could you see and describe a point or points where shorting should
have been initiated for IOM?

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=IOM&d=5y

Because my recollection is different from Jurgis's. I do not recall an
announcement of earnings or revenue shortfall at the inflection point. But I
remember that point and when it occurred very well- because I thought of
shorting specifically there. But no stomach for it.

If you do see an appropriate point, could it be applicable to AMZN?? I see a
reference point on the IOM chart,and I say it is applicable. Now that has no
real basis for substantiation -- we're only talking one or two stocks here, and
we're not talking value fundamentals at all--- but there's enough of a clue for
me to be wary and maybe to say... the top for AMZN mania has not been reached.
Of course, that's OPINION only,and I've been wrong many,many times before. -g-

Paul,

>[IOM crash] Because my recollection is different
>from Jurgis's.

You owe me big - I looked up June 1996
archives of the IOM thread. :-) You are right, the
turning point was NOT a revenue shortfall. It was
the secondary offering for institutional investors
below market price. However, there was no sudden "death blow"
top. The stock started trading down, then Cabbott newsletter
got compromised, then there was revenue shortfall
or quality problems (I don't remember which) in Europe.
If you have time to read 50K messages, you can figure it
all out yourself. :-)

I doubt if short sellers made a lot of money on
IOM. It is down 2/3 from the top. Since the ascent was
fast, it's unlikely you would have shorted at the top.
If you shorted at $18, which was the
offering price of the secondary, you would have made
~$7-8. It depends whether you consider that worth your risk.
IMO, shorting a broken stock is less risky
and ultimately more profitable. But then, most Internet
companies have farther to fall. :-)

Jeffrey: Good response to Amazon v Walmart. In support of this, note that prior
to Barnes & Noble, Amazon didn't offer 30% /20% discounts nearly across the
board. They had to match B&N's discount structure or game over. Now there's
several shopbot's devoted to books [and many other net categories] that will
keep these guys profitless forever...or at least at margins that make current
valuations ludicrous.
Also, now that Amazon is building distribution centers, they are going to have
to deal with a lot of real world stuff..like slippage [It fell off the truck],
unions, logistics..that they used to let Ingram do. It took Ingram quite awhile
to learn to deal with this stuff and it's going to be interesting to see the
Amazonians climb the learning curve.
