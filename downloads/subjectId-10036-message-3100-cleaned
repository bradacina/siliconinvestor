Looks like New Holland may be a way to play the next
emerging markets boom/recovery? In any case, I am having
a hard time staying out of the stock - just feel that if
I am patient I might get it even cheaper.

BTW, VO barely budged today at 33 and change despite Mario
Gabelli's table pounding in the roundtable that the stock is worth
upwards of $50-60. I guess the way he says everything is worth
10 times cash flow bothers me. Why not 6 or 7? And if 6 or 7,
then what's the upside? Maybe the market agrees.

Mike, do you have any updated view on OXHP? As you know, I never bought it. Do
you have a view on what it might be worth on a takeover, or takeunder? My guess
is that they would be more likely to put themselves up for sale if they were
desperate than if they were not.

Re: OXHP

As you know, my analysis changed dramatically with the 12/9 $200M in
charges and subsequent apparent press release/conference call
cover-up/numbers games that Wiggins played. The article I wrote
certainly never anticipated the size and the misdirection involved.
I had joked a few days before that it would take
$200M in charges to get into risky territory - voila, to my dismay.

In general, my analysis hasn't changed since then - very risky but
attractive as a takeover candidate by a growing insurer seeking
national coverage/with a history of successful acquisitions. If it
can show an iota of a successful turnaround with new management, the share
price can double back to the mid-high 20's at least. But I really try to avoid
ifs, and it is speculative whether previous cash flows will be attained any
time soon if at all.

It became apparent to me, however, that the entire industry was being
hit out of proportion to fundamentals. Oxford wasn't going to recover
without the industry recovering (and possibly not even then), and I
decided to go with the greater margin of safety in the more mature Pacificare,
which I bought Jan 12 at 48 1/4 (down from ~100), as I posted at my web site.
Including FHP (which is in the end a success despite the surprises), it has
been built on successful acquisitions, and it has a 17 years of experience
running brand-name Medicare when
all the new plans are bailing on it.

It wouldn't be the first time Pacificare has feasted on others' famine and
emerged stronger. Besides, it is trading at about 6 X 97
EBITDA, and its members at 536/head were cheaper than Oxford's even
at Oxford's discount. Oxford's at 4.3 X the EBITDA it was doing, but
whether it will ever hit that again is the whole question.

Re: OXHP takeover - with insiders owning so little,
no insider buying even at these levels, shareholders growing
increasingly frustrated, and new management required anyway, I don't
see why the Board wouldn't allow a takeover at a modest premium.

Michael Price getting on board PHSYA didn't hurt my decision either,
and I must admit I jumped at the chance to get in at a cheaper price than him -
amazingly it did get cheaper despite the fact that they
announced a buyback only a few days after Price announced his
position.

I should say I have received a lot of flak for the OXHP story
and my subsequent change of opinion, and I don't really wish
to get into that all over again, in case readers are thinking they
want to discuss those aspects here. You can always e-mail me.

Re: MAXI

Funny, it had come up on a screen of mine just last week. Looks like
Nasgowitz has over 17% of it, up from just 11% in
September. 3 sell sides following it with basically sell recs.
At $300 per member and 1/4 sales, with $30 million in
cash compared to a 150M cap, this is one cheap HMO. That 10%
spread isn't too appealing, but it's no worse than another
Nasgowitz special, HYDEA/B. I gotta look into it more, but
it's growing fast, which means it can't reliably estimate it's
MLR going forward, and it's acquiring a bunch of Medi-Cal
biz - the same that Pacificare is dumping. Looks like upwards
of 75% is governmental, less than 25% commercial.

That'd be every journalist I know of who has looked at this stock or similar

earnings are subject to revision so easily, it's not reasonable to put any
faith in any of current or future earnings, and the sensible thing to do is to
pass by GNT and this ilk. So true. The stock has now hurt almost every long it

10+. An obvious avoid I thought. Was I wrong -g-! Stock hit 16.1/2 today.
Earnings coming in nicely; new stores opening as discussed on this thread. But
at 15-18X earnings and competition in this business and segment... I just don't
get why stock should be THIS high, didn't then either, and maybe I will never

Basically, I just see a lot of people overlooking a durable

both of which have nothing to do with operations long-term
and 4-5 years out will pass. At that point you will
all those cash flows flowing right to the bottom line rather
than debt repayment. Any stumble in cash flows due to Asia
will be more than made up in the future as they continue
their aggressive investment in Asia for cheap and as they
restructure heretofore very poorly managed Pizza Hut operations.

I see it as something of a near-guarantee long-term with
very little downside. As for the valuation, I would say
that it is fairly priced now only in a short-termer's eyes,
and I outlined some of the upside in the article.

Thanks for the feedback, Scott.

The amazing relative strength of the Nasdaq over the last two
weeks is a testament to the value in the sector. Despite the
number of times tech comes up, I'm frustrated because I just
don't know it.

On my site, I was preparing Speedfam (SFAM) as my pick of the month -
selling at 24 with 11 in cash. I decided against it on Feb 1
(it was 3/4 written) when I saw
the ballooning receivables coinciding with the Asian crisis.
My industry-insider friends say it makes a great semi equip
product. But I also saw that its cash flows are negative due
to high working capital requirement and immense investing/capital
expense that has been ongoing with no foreseeable stop given
the pace of change in the industry and their recent plant
expansion. So I said no - for the portfolio and the site.

Today? Up 27% out of nowhere. I'm out the opportunity cost
of the gain and I still haven't found a replacement pick of
the month. How should it be valued? Beats
me - I can't seem to figure it out with financial analysis.

I sympathize like crazy on SFAM. I have my own - DPMI. I did half my due
diligence on the stock and bought a starter position at $26 last week,
concluding it was probably mispriced. Now "what I don't know about the company
isn't worth knowing", I still have my starter position, and the stock is $39.
(It WAS mispriced, but fairly priced now.)

I agree with the poster who said that traditional valuation measures should be
used on tech stocks just like any others. In fact I have learned over the years
that you should, if anything, be tougher. The reason is that the R&D spending
is essential to these companies
survival. However, the results of such spending in these dynamic businesses are
not assured, which represents additional risk. Everyone looks at the homeruns,
but forgets that any portfolio of tech stocks will have its share of Apple's
and Novell's. Unfortunately, it is also true that a tech stock that looks like
a value stock is often there for a serious reason, which may be difficult to
solve. (It is more often true that traditional companies can have value pricing
because of disinterest and neglect, and not have serious problems.)

Paul, re HBI and Eagle... Eagle is moving into Cal and yes they are a great

has its hands full with HD building stores across the rd from them in the

The market is expanding, cheaper imports should increase margins and when I
compare HD,EAGL+HD, HD looks very pricy(of course I said the same about Coke).

Hi Michael,

It's me again. :-) Re: valuation of tech stocks.

I use PSR and requirement that the company is
a leader in its field. The "field" is loosely defined.
If I don't know the field, then I look for absolute leaders
(e.g. INTC-MSFT-CSCO). If I know the field, e.g. semi-equips,
I subdivide it into smaller subfields and look for leaders
there. I also avoid any commodities (DRAM, DD, etc.).

Going from there, the TOP THREE (INTC-MSFT-CSCO)
were never cheap enough. Let's look at the subfields though.

Software: ADBE - leader in PostScript, PDF, etc. Pricey
but getting there.
Hardware/peripherals:
APCC - leader in UPS, surge protection.
Was cheap in 1996. Pricey now.
ADPT - leader in DD controller cards. Still pricey.

Networking: LU - was cheap after spinoff. :-(((

Semi's: Non-commodity semis: XLNX, ALTR - pricey.

Semi-equips - my favorite area. You must
understand that semi-equips are growth-cyclicals and must
be handled as such. There's an absolute leader - AMAT.
Then there are subleaders: ASYT, CFMT, COHU, CYMI,
EGLS, ESIO, HELX, KLAC, KLIC, PRIA, SFAM, SMTL, TER,
UTEK.
Each of these companies have a good track record and
consistent growth in the up cycles. Most of them have
no long-term history though.
The strategy with semi-equips is to buy them
when everybody hates them - which was last week.
I also agree with your "double bottom" buying strategy.
They have to be sold as soon as they reach high
valuations, because the cycles are unpredictable and
each down cycle carries the whole group to the gutter.
Is there a sense of buying multiple stocks vs.
buying AMAT? Most of the time there is not though sometimes
other stocks get more mispriced than AMAT.
Finally, I think we might still see a big drop
in semi-equips. SEA is still uncertain, though is being
ignored more and more. You still may get SFAM @ < $24.

Good luck

Mike - great website!
I would like to put forward two ideas for the thread to evaluate and comment
on, the first a micro-micro cap, the second a large cap name with NONE of the
traditional "value" characteristics:
1) IPLS (IPL Systems) pops up on a PSR screen, but admittedly few others. IPL
soon will become Andataco in the post merger form. I am of the opinion that
with Andataco's marketing expertise and the recent hires from EMC Corp., this
company, with all its inherent risks as a micro cap turnaround situation, will
succeed in its niche in the data storage industry.
2) Rubbermaid, though having a PE ratio considerably above its norm of
historical growth, will benefit from decreasing raw material costs, and recent
strategic cost cutting measures. From a gut standpoint, I believe the
Rubbermaid franchise is worth more than the current stock price.
This being said about both stocks, they remain "show me" stocks, as can be
witnessed in their charts.
Any comments and discussion would be most appreciated.
Disclaimer: I have long positions in both stocks.

In the meantime, I'll propose BMC industries. It's a high
ROE firm that took a haircut in November and is going through
a rough time. It recently sharply increased capital expenditures
just as the Asian crisis hit. Bad timing. But 5 insiders (including
the CEO and Chairman) jumped in and massively increased the sizes
of their holdings. Moreover, the company just bought back 1 mill
shares and is about to buy back another 1 mill. Evidently, the
company has faith. Meanwhile the shares are meandering
a hair below the insiders' buy prices.

It's the pick of the month at my web site, and I have taken
a position.

BMC started ramping up capital investment in 1996 in the
face of surging demand and in order to
modernize operations in the hope that increased efficiency
and capacity would result in savings on the cost side as they
expanded. They accelerated investment in 1997 even more, which
hurt profits as Asian price competition heated up, but
now feel they have the capital improvements in place for greater
efficiency and possibly lower costs going forward. Management feels
any efficiencies will become especially apparent in the bottom
line going into the latter half of 1998, augmented by a pick-up
in top line growth.

That's their party line. My feeling is that the company really
started to grow recently and just had to pour a bunch of money into
capital investment programs to keep up. Now things have slowed down,
and the capital spending splurge is somewhat behind them. As a result,
comparisons should be good going forward. As it stands, I was
attracted by the sharp stock fall despite continued solid profitability,
consistently high ROE, a conservative balance sheet,
proven stock buybacks, and intense insider interest.

I'm satisfied, but as always, everything I post on my web site
is meant as a starting point for further research, not a
recommendation.

You have a made a good selection in BMC. I bot this in last week of Dec. The

We will get some more bad news in the next two quarters. However I consider

average down during the next six months.

I think that your point is well taken. I'd like to hear Mike's response to my
question and finish my due diligence. However, it sort of looks as if the "bid"
at the moment is helped a lot by the buyback.
The balance sheet won't look nearly so nice after spending $33 million on stock
at $10 above book. There are a lot of shares outstanding and
my hunch is that when they are done with the buyback and we have another
quarter or two of uninspiring results, the stock might head closer to $10. (I
have learned to be very wary of "capital improvements hurt the current quarter
and we will see the benefits in much better results a few quarters out" types
of statements.)

Jeffrey, Re: BMC

Let's see:

1) The buyback in January took place entirely in one week - the
price has been pretty stable both before and after that. It may
be supporting the bid now, I suppose.

2) They've been taking on LT debt at favorable rates (Eurodollar
or LIBOR + ~0.5%) to finance some of
1997's capital expense as well as (likely) the 1998 buyback. 1995-1996 capital
improvements were out of cash flow. I guess
we can be wary of "cap improvements have hurt us this year, but don't
worry" but then that's why the insider buying to me was significant -
most of it the very next day after the fall. Investments like the Hungarian
plant will lower costs in the future. But there are also
investments in current technologies and capacity that will
allow the company to supply future high definition markets
of many types without interupption.

3) I don't mind borrowing at today's interest rates to buy back
shares. More companies should be doing it. In BMC's case, its
earned ROE of 20%, 28%, 26%, 20%, 21%, 20%, 30% going back seven
years, which indicates to me its strong market positions in both
masks and lenses, good business economics and solid management. It
has ~20% of the market for these masks, and is the sole supplier
to non-Japanese visual display businesses.

4) If we take the management by its words and actions, we would
expect 1998's second half will see lower costs/increased unit
sales and 15% earnings growth "at least" over 1997 as the
capital expense tapers off.

The Asian problem will result in the sale of more imported
Asian TV's and monitors, so it's not a quick rebound. All 5 analysts following
it already hacked estimates (four of the five
set a low bar of less than 17 cents for this quarter) and 3 of them downgraded
the company. The stock was 80+% held by institutions so I expect a long dormant
period. The stock isn't moving like it's got
momentum players in it anymore.

Much like the car industry, the economics can sometimes be so
much better for the supplier than for the buyer. After all, how much
really extensive advertising does BMC have to do? Its margins can be
much better than Zeniths, as can its ROE.

10? Anything's possible. The Asian crisis lasting a long time or
even worsening. The economy contracting. The company appears very cheap
relative to its peers with insider buying and a logical
way out of its current disdained position, however.

Yes. I bought DPMI at 26 1/4, which at that price I like better that BMC in
every respect - p/e, price/book, market position, balance sheet, big brother
Dupont, outlook, etc. Basically flat to slightly lower recent sales and
earnings. Unfortunately, instead of being way early as usual, I had barely
gotten my feet wet (gradual buying being my style) when it took off on me.
"Glass half empty" suddenly switched to "glass half full" on this volatile,
institutional stock because of latest "DUV" announcement. It might be worth 20
minutes of your time just to look at this as what I regard as a lesson not to
degrade your standards since really good opportunities do come along.

The other stock I continue to buy, as recently as last week, is CALM.
Although I would buy more in the mid 6's or less, I am thoroughly wet on this
one and don't care if someone else sees my point of view and buys or not. I
have mentioned this previously on this thread, I believe.

It is the largest factor ($300 million sales) in the egg producing (commodity)
business. MIKL is the nearest much more expensive somewhat comparable public
company. The company has been building modern new facilities and buying smaller
farms in its territory for years (at book value, believing over time they can
be made to be worth 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 book). Last year it made about $1.25. This
year will be closer to $.75 because of lower egg prices in the first half (they
are up now) and lower export sales (strong dollar probably). Book today is
approaching $6.50 (no good will), or about the current price. Mgmt plans to
continue this strategy and looks for sales growth of perhaps 10-15% next year
from internal expansion and acquisitions.

So what is so hot about this company in an industry with no growth to speak of.
This is a conservative company with a sound strategy I believe. The whole
industry is consolidating gradually and as a result, in management's opinion,
becoming less volatile. The company
recently did a private debt financing with its primary lenders, insurance
companies, refinancing and raising more money, WITH AN INVESTMENT GRADE RATING
from Duff and Phelps. They just instituted a modest penny per quarter dividend.

In my opinion, it is starting to appear on some food analysts or institutions
screens and will be bought. If you feel as I do that the company can have a
book value of perhaps $10 in three years and because of some degree of
recognition sell at say 130% of book, you are talking about a double in 3 years
that you don't have to follow every day or lose any sleep over. Management (and
ESOP) owns most of the company and thinks they are worth $10-12 today, but I
always take those kinds of statements with a large grain of salt.

I also think SEMI is interesting, although it is a high debt load, much more
speculative, nationwide, semiconductor distribution company with $265 million
sales. Samsung is a major (15-20%?) supplier (which could be a problem if
Samsung added larger US distributors for its products). Book about $1.25, price
Friday $1.75. Seems to have turned around after some missteps resulting in a
poor 1996. Outlook for $300 million sales in 1998 which would mean $.25 -.30 in
earnings (fully taxed). A Director recently added 15,000 shares at around $2,
increasing position by material percentage, for first insider buy in years.
Small amount of money, but interesting. Own it as well.

Thanks for your input, Paul, always good to get multiple opinions. You are

so than IPLS due to its market cap). Actually, I think on an absolute basis,
RBD is more overvalued than the tiny IPLS. However, I feel that there is
substantial value to be unlocked in the RBD franchise. IMO either current mgmt.
will accomplish this or somebody else will do this for them. It is no secret
that "Chainsaw" Al Dunlap's name has been mentioned in regards to this stock.
On another matter, it appears that Speedfam (SFAM) will get smacked today. Just

it might be of interest to us value investors.

There are PLENTY of good stocks out there at good prices. Of course, if you run

high-volatility runups and pullbacks. I am in the futures industry as a job, so
don't think that I become scared of the volatility in the stock market! I don't
agree with the standard method of treating volatility as risk - you can often
predict an expected level of volatility. Risk is whether or not you lose money.

Paul, that was an outstanding post, with some excellent points. I tend to have
a concentrated portfolio, which I am coming to conclude is a mistake. I pass by
too many great ideas, looking for the super outstanding ones, which are rare.
An example. Solectron was a great idea under $30 recently, but I passed it by
because it was not great enough.

But even worse, you tend to fall in love with a concentrated portfolio and be
slow to react to fundamental changes that make one of your holdings less
wonderful. Being slow to kick out or reduce a bad situation can have a
materially negative impact on results, when compared with a less concentrated
portfolio.

Honest Abe: In a market downturn, Buffett mutual funds will go down yes. Those
funds are composed of individual stocks - they will go down too. Either way,
stocks go down and you lose - unless - based on recent 20 years or so past -
you hold on to fund or stock. My opinion is - from the nature of the question
you first posed to the thread - YOU are not prepared (yet)to beat Buffett or
mutual funds. (It's not about me and my personal situation vis-a-vis funds.)
Not saying that you are not good or the next Buffett. And I perfectly well
understand the attraction of the stock market.
Obviously, if one picks the few right stocks... that's all it takes. That's
what Buffett says, no? But there's only one Buffett and only a few Yacktmans,
etc. But Graham doesn't say this. This is a Graham thread -generally- and he
espoused a well-diversified portfolio. Something that works for the
"Intelligent Investor" (not implying you are not intelligent - or that I am
-g-). Therefore, I challenge the statement that "diversity is to protect money,
not make a lot of money".
What you bring to the party for me is this: a glimmer or idea that perhaps
(just perhaps) everyone who is trying to follow Buffett is starting from the
premise that what's needed is a proper screen to select stocks with certain
attributes so that further investigation could be undertaken on such a subset.
Based on MY experience with MY ONE Buffett stock (you can scroll up about 40
posts to see my story), this may not be the way to find the next Buffett stock.
Maybe another approach is needed. What that approach might be, I do not know.

I did not imply that the mutual fund would not rise and fall with the market. I
was referring to the tax implications of a mutual fund being forced to sell
because of investors or the market, but not because of the stock itself. This
is irrational behavior and I see no reason why I should subject myself to it.

"My opinion is - from the nature of the question you first
posed to the thread - YOU are not prepared (yet)to beat Buffett or mutual
funds."

I would appreciate a clarification of what I said that was so green or ignorant
to warrant this statement.

"What you bring to the party for me is this: a glimmer or idea that perhaps

perhaps) everyone who is trying to follow Buffett is starting from the premise
that

Once again, a miscommunication. First, I am in no way trying to speak for
'everyone who is trying to follow Buffett'. My ideas on how to invest like him
are solely mine. Second, I did not mean to imply anything about a stock screen.
We will set up spreadsheets that will aid in the financial analysis of a
company, as I'm sure in this day and age even Graham would have. There are no
plans for screening financial attributes to narrow down the list. You must pick
the stock first, and then see if the price is right. No screen can do that for
you.

I may have misunderstood the object of the group - Value Investing. I know the
first post mentions Graham, but since Buffett is Graham's most famous disciple,
is it wrong to bring his methods into the group?

Respectfully,

Honest

I have mentioned this to the thread before at lower prices, but I would like
some input in light of the recent acquisition announcement of Arbor Drugs
(ARBR).
The stock of Phar-Mor (PMOR) seems significantly value when one compares it to
Arbor in certain key statistical ratios:

P/B ARBR 3.9 PMOR 1.3
P/S ARBR 1.07 PMOR .1
CR ARBR 2.3/1 PMOR 2.9/1

PE ARBR 30 PMOR NM*
*PMOR reported its first profitable Q last report, I believe the company can
earn .60 this year.
PMOR certainly has significantly more debt on the books than ARBR. It also has
more cash assets, as well.
Both companies have approximately $1 bil. in sales.
It could be argued that ARBR is a much more seasoned company, dominating its
particular market (Detroit), while PMOR has the stigma of a company emerging
from a scandalous past.
That being said, I still don't think that PMOR should trade at such an extreme
discount to ARBR.

AOL valuation still makes me sick, with analysts upping their price targets at
will. 50, 75, 100 times earnings, who cares!

On a roll

HOUSTON (Feb. 9) BUSINESS WIRE -Feb. 9, 1998--Reliability Incorporated
(Nasdaq symbol REAL) today announced net income of $2,403,000, or $.40
per share, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 1997, on revenues
of $14,426,000. Net income for the same quarter in 1996 was $1,522,000
or $.18 per share on revenues of $10,789,000. Earnings per share for
all periods of 1996 and 1997 reflect the effect of a 2 for 1 stock
split that was effective on September 22, 1997.

Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 1997 was $8,132,000
or $1.25 per share on revenues of $47,220,000. Net income for the same
period in 1996 was $4,846,000 or $.57 per share on revenues of $35,760,
000. Net income per share increased $.22 for the fourth quarter of
1997 and increased $.68 for the year of 1997. The Company purchased 1,
270,000 shares of its common stock on March 12, 1997, resulting in a
decrease in the average shares outstanding for the 1997 periods.
Approximately $.12 and $.29 of the increases for the quarter and twelve
months, respectively, were due to a decrease in the average number of
shares outstanding. Backlog was $14.1 million at December 31, 1997, an
increase of 42% over the $9.9 million at December 31, 1996.

Larry Edwards, President and CEO commented,

"Our fourth quarter, with revenues up 34% and EPS up 122% over the
fourth quarter of 1996, was a great way to end a truly outstanding year
for Reliability. 1997 was a record year for bookings ($51.4 million),
revenues ($47.2 million), operating income ($12.3 million), net income
after tax ($8.1 million), and EPS which was 119% above EPS for 1996.
The business level throughout 1997 was very strong as bookings for new
orders remained above $12 million in each of the four quarters. In
fact, fourth quarter bookings of $13.9 million and revenue of $14.2
million were the highest of all the four quarters in 1997. Our $14.1
million backlog as of December 31, 1997 gives us an excellent start for
1998.

"Demand for the Company's latest Intersect(tm) functional memory tester
and our Criteria(R) 18-HD micrologic system remained very strong in
1997. Even though we increased revenue by 33% in 1997 to meet the
demand in the Testing Products Segment, the backlog increased by 64% to
$11.2 million at December 31, 1997. Our forward look at 1998 indicates
the demand for Testing Products should remain strong.

"The revenue level for our testing Services was at a record $6.3
million for the fourth quarter of 1997, and the unit demand for our
services in Singapore was up significantly. In North Carolina we
installed and qualified all of the equipment required to process 64 Meg
DRAMs. Production quantities were processed in November and December.
However, we were notified in January 1998 that Mitsubishi would be
significantly reducing its output of DRAMs in North Carolina and would
no longer require Reliability's testing services after the first
quarter of 1998. Reliability announced in January that the North
Carolina plant will be closed in April 1998. Although the plant
closure had no impact on 1997 revenues, we estimate we will record
approximately a $500,000 ($0.05 per share) reserve in the first quarter
of 1998, subject to several negotiations, to cover the cost of the
closure. The North Carolina facility accounted for approximately 10%
of our total revenue in 1997.

"The following statements are forward looking, based on our current
expectations, and actual results may differ materially. Although we are
cautiously optimistic about 1998, our current forecast still indicates
that Reliability will report revenue growth for 1998. To meet our
forecast, the demand for Testing Products must be sufficiently strong
to offset the loss in revenue from the closure of our North Carolina
facility. Our forward looking forecast indicates revenues for the
first quarter of 1998 to be approximately $10 million to $11 million,
compared to first quarter 1997 revenues of $6.7 million. We expect EPS
for the first quarter of 1998 to be approximately $0.16 vs. $0.09 for
the first quarter of 1997. We expect gross margins for 1998 as
compared to 1997 will decrease a few percentage points, to
approximately 47%, due to changes in product mix and competitive
pressures on sales prices. We expect R&D expense to increase a little
in 1998 as we invest in new product development, resulting in an
increase in total G&A expense for the full year of 1998 as compared to
1997."

Reliability Incorporated is based in Houston, Texas with operating
facilities in Durham, North Carolina; San Jose, Costa Rica; and
Singapore. Reliability and its subsidiaries manufacture burn-in and
test equipment, automatic loading and unloading equipment and other
peripherals for sale to manufacturers and volume users of integrated
circuits. The Company also manufactures a line of power sources,
including DC-to-DC power converters, and provides conditioning and
testing services for integrated circuits in Singapore and Durham.

"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995: Statements in this document regarding Reliability's
business which are not historical facts are "forward looking
statements" that involve risk and uncertainties, including, but not
limited to, market acceptance of our products and services, the effects
of general economic conditions, the impact of competition, product
development schedules, problems with technology, delivery schedules,
and supply and demand changes for our products and services and our
customers products and services. Actual results may materially differ
from projections.

This is an excellent point and, of course, I hope the answer is no. Nor is it
wrong to bring in the strategies of other investors who are called value
investors and there are many. A quick example would be Michael Price who seems
to specialize in "turn-around" situations and was recently reported to have
invested in nearly the entire HMO sector including Oxford Health Plans, causing
(perhaps) a nice run-up in the share-price from which I am benefiting. Clearly,
OXHP is not a Graham or Buffett stock and I readily agree with everything
Michael Burry has posted about it and yet one could still be called a value
investor for buying it. In fact, by going after such stocks Michael Price's
funds (which I own P.F.{Pre-Franklin})have managed to weather strong downturns
in the market.

I hope the thread will comment on some of the other flavors of value investing.

Wasn't it about 5 months ago that we had this same discussion? Didn't I recall
a few of you saying the same thing - market too high,
going to cash? Now the market is higher and what do I see? At least one person
is back to fully invested- I figured he couldn't stay
out -g-. 

That would be me ;-). The way I see it, the market is moving to
new highs as if Asia never happened. For 15 years now, when the
market has moved to new highs, it meant good things. Ultimately that
will change, and this is as good a time as any.

BUT many many stocks have been killed out of proportion. In the
last months I deployed most of my cash position in these beaten-down
stocks:
PHSYA (down 50%)
MSA (down 20%)
BMC (down 50%)
TBR (down 40%)
YUM (down 30%)
SJP (down 20%)

There are others out there. The net of it is I don't know who the
heck is paying for MSFT and Gilette and the like at these
prices, but if I keep my head out of that nosebleed netherland,
I see stocks to buy that weren't there 5 mos ago. As the nosebleeders
get stupid-happy for lack of O2 to their brains, so be it. Their
stupidity can't make me ignore the gold between their toes.

BTW, new posters to the thread should see Paul's initial
posts to me - "I kinda see you twisting in the wind" and
"You're a medical doctor, ipso facto a lousy investor."
Paul's quite an asset to the thread. If we were all drinking
buddies, the thread would simply suck. So steel yourselves
up and throw out those contrarian views.

I certainly entertain different styles of value investing
for my portfolios and I'd hope the thread does too.

Good Investing,
Mike

I wrote this once, but I don't think it posted. Mike, I say I don't market
time, but when I see stocks in my portfolio 5 points above my sell price and I
can't find anything in the market to buy, that's the time to raise cash. I've
got 20% now (sold Oxford and Tejon Ranch today - have you been watching Tejon)
and am looking to raise more.

The one thing I am buying is Greyhound (BUS) A super leveraged turnaround that
has turned around, but nobody has noticed. The kind of stock that could triple
in a year. Not for the faint of heart, but I am very comfortable with what I

Honest Abe: Okay, I am wrong on a couple of things. First, my last post
shouldn't have been addressed to you. I see that you have a model or models
which you are using. I see that you are actually a long term investor (well 3
years- that's good enough for 99% of the people who define long term). What
confused me - and maybe some others -is that you asked for a source for 10 year
history that others would recommend. Well of course, we all (just a guess here)
are familiar with and use VL. And so you are too - I see now. You would have to
be. But from that first(?) post I (too) inferred that although you were in the
investing business, you incongruously missed this source. Can't find Buffett
stocks if you don't have or aren't aware of the basic tools. Munger once said
(or maybe twice said -g-), "The Value line graphs, as short-form digests of
reality, company by company, are the best things of their kind that America
produces. The Value Line people have a sensationally good idea- put the data in
exactly the form they put it in and to put it in graph form."
That said, there is something else. As Barry Hall points out... don't use its
recommendations. A lesson I seem to have to keep relearning over and over -g-.
(Thanks Barry!) Based on what your strengths seem - this is not an issue for
you.
I would like to consider myself a superior investor. But I don't think the
facts support it. I've been at it a while, and I'm nowhere near my first
half-billion. My core belief is that if I want to succeed, I need to do the
things that have been proven to be successful - and that are comfortable -
reasonably - for my psyche. My opinion is, that value investing methods - in
the latter Graham methodology (circa '75 and '76), are demonstrable and
repeatable methods that an average, reasonable, dedicated person (not
necessarily me -g-) can use to increase wealth. It works for anybody (maybe).
Now Buffett. Buffett is not emulated for being a value investor . A value
investor buys undervalued and sells fair or full valued. Yes Buffett does this
too. But he has core holdings - never to sell. The people who follow, or try to
follow, Buffett aren't looking at the value aspect. They seem to focus on the
core, buy and forget - the big profit 8x-20x baggers. They are looking at this
"other" wealth generating activity. Again: Buffett concentrates. Graham value
players diversify. Again: Buffett's first and second rules: don't lose money.
Graham value players (IMO): there will be losers. It's a statistical approach.
Winners offset losers. Again: Buffett is unique- in spite of his folksy,
down-home, comfortable ole Warren schtick. Nobody has come close to duplicating
his success. Funds based on his work don't seem that great to me either. But
with Graham value: methods that work (sometimes -g-)for his many "intelligent
investors". Many disciples - they've become wealthy too.
Finally - my opinion is - and I speak for myself - if you've got something you
want to say regarding- Graham, Dodd, Buffett (Jimmy or Warren -g-), Van
Waggoner (sigh),or whatever -- SAY IT man. I certainly want all that good
information and skill and insight you've got. It's better for all of us to read
and think, than to have missed an opportunity that could have helped one or
more of us. And if you're a guy who can keep the same stocks for 3 years, you
do have a lot to offer!

I'm glad that you can see my point of view. I think we just had some

ALL:

If you have not read "Buffettology", I highly recommend it. I have read almost
all the books on Buffett, but this one addresses his investment methods FAR
better than any of the other books. If you are interested in his style, you
will gain something from the book.
