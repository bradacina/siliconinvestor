re FSR, RGA, FMR -
FSR catastrophe insurance is very different from RGA life reinsurance business
- the latter is more of a long tail risk. FMR is on my buy list too, I missed
it when it was close to 9$/share. I own RGA as well and would buy more if it
falls below 45$/share.

I agree that the insurers are cheap - it used to be that they became decent
buys around tangible book but nowdays, plenty can be bought at <80% tangible
book and decent earnings. I assume it is due to the soft insurance market and
to some extend low interest rates (good for book but not that great for
earnings on the float).

Anyways, I am buying a diversified bunch of these opportunistically as I see
fit.

I currently own: TRH, RGA, FSR,ASI, DL.AS (Delta Lloyd)

re CFW - this stock has been handed around in other stock threads I am
following. It looks cheap based on proved BOE/$ EV (I think it's around
3-4$/BOE) but the lease operating Expenses are 44$/BOE so it's an extremely
high cost producer. I think this is really like a call option on high crude
prices.

I passed on it when I calculed the lease operating expenses (there are other
expenses on top of that of course). I don't think they can make money below
100$/BRL crude.

For LT call option on crude play, oil sands stocks are better, imo.

Insurers are cheap. But insurers pretty much have to be in Buffett's hands or
they are destined to be (somewhat) cheap. Classical business is tough:
competition is high, the push to write business at any price is difficult to
resist and let's not talk about innovative ways to try to diworsify into
exotics like AIG did. ;)

The float is great only if you invest it at Buffett's returns or with Buffett's
acumen. Most of the insurers don't. In current situation, they are trapped. If
they invest the float into bonds now, they may see almost zero earnings now and
losses when bonds turn. If they chase yield, they may lose (as many of them did
in 2008) if junk market crashes. Very few of them have acumen to invest well in
stocks. Some of them get lucky on the big calls like FRFHF, but then you wonder
if they gonna continue being lucky.

Yeah, companies like FMR look very cheap. But operationally, I see pain. The
only consolation is that capital is cheap and plenty so catalyst for
acquisitions like AMPH's buyout are plenty too.

Caveat: I am not an insurance company expert at all. I still don't know if
there is a good way to decide what to buy in this sector apart from
good-management/faith investing. Some of the past numbers as well as book value
gives some indications, but it's not clear how much they can be relied no.

Some of the last posts brings back the old question of when do you sell a
stock? especially one that is going up.

Last week on Fast Money one of the guys recommended LVS at about $36. This was
a stock that someone at the street.com recommended selling shortly after I
bought it under $3. I had a huge profit in it and it was becoming a big chunk
of my portfolio and I sold it in the $13-$15 range as an offeset to short term
losses I had at the time. In retrospect that was a stupid decision but not as
stupid as the one to sell AAPL after they announced Itunes and the stock ralled
some 20-30% and seemed to be getting ahead of itself for a value player, that
was about 1200% ago. So in support of teaching this old dog some new tricks.
How do you guys decide when to sell?

Right now I seem to have a few criteria of when to sell a stock.
1. When a hope for event just doesnt materealize and when I become disappointed
with the company's prospects or management.

2. Portfolio consideration-stock just becomes to big a portion of my portfolio.

3. tax considerations

4. technical considerations- my technical indicator says sell.

5. I want to buy something else and need the money

When to sell? When something significant changes, I refresh due diligence and
ask myself, "If I didn't own it now, would I now buy it?" If I wouldn't, then I
sell it.

Changes I look for:
o price change
o earnings surprises
o M&A
o market/product changes (e.g. IPad impact on AAPL, DELL, ...)

I don't look at technical considerations (not that I'd know one if I stepped in
it)

Too big...hmmm...if AAPL keeps growing I'll slice off a piece, but it still has
nice valuation. I wouldn't want it over 20% of my portfolio. I hope this is a
problem soon.

Taxes are a minor consideration for me usually.

Madharry, fwiw, I generally sell:

1) "When a hoped for event just doesn't materialize". When a hoped for event
does materialize, and the stock doesn't move after 1 or 2 quarters have
elapsed.

2) "when I become disappointed with the company's prospects"

3) "when I become disappointed with the company's management"

4) When a stock hasn't moved and business or book value doesn't seem to have
improved after a 2-year holding.

5. When a net-net hasn't shown stock gain after about a two year holding. (I am
reducing my holding period from 3 years.)

6. When I am betting on a large-scale organizational change and I don't see any
business improvement after three years or stock improvement within five.

6. When I am betting on the jockey (CEO) and he (or she) leaves or makes big
stock sales.

7. When I am betting on a guru (value maven), and the guru sells.

I'll point out that for me, there are several things that are sell signals for
me as regards the market. This doesn't mean though that I necessarily will
reduce stock positions or sell out individual positions. I will sell based on
fear. Not sure what events drive that though. Usually some sudden news event or
a long drawn-out market drop.

Hi Paul -

When to Sell?

Does SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU) fit in with any of your criteria? Stock has had more
rumors that the company will go private. Huge volume last few days.

4) When a stock hasn't moved and business or book value doesn't seem to have
improved after a 2-year holding.

I still like the value proposition. I think $17.00 to $20.00 is a reasonable
"value" target.

If the private guys like it, they must see intrinsic value too.

So you are saying that when the materialized event occurs if the stock doesnt
move after two quarters you go ahead and sell the stock. I dont understand why
you would do that if the stock is still a good value play. I had a friend who
owned amgen and held it for 3 years before selling it. after that it went up
about 30 times in the ensuing 5 years. a long time ago i owned a stock called
subaru of america the stock i think was selling for about $6 the company was
projecting enormous growth in subaru shipments to the united states. I think i
owned the stock for two years, the projections were being met but the response
in share price was somewhat muted eventually i sold the shares. within two
years after i sold it the stock went from 7 or 8 and change to over $120. The
lesson I hope I learned from that is that as long as a company is performing to
expectation it makes sense to act like and owner rather than a speculator.

I thought you would list as reasons for selling something like the stock
appreciation had come to far too fast and that it was overvalued by your
criteria or that it had become too much of your portfolio. As it seems to me
when you do peel off shares that is the reason most of the time.

Madharry,

I pretty much only have two rules to sell:

1) I feel the stock is not as undervalued as another stock, so I sell one stock
to buy another.

Or

2) I feel the stock market has reached a peak and so I trim some shares of
various holdings which I feel are less undervalued than others.

That's pretty much it. If a stock has gotten to be too big a part of my
portfolio, then it generally falls into rule #1 above anyway and I rotate
shares to another stock.

re BAC - I owned a few shares too recently but then decided to get rid of them
in favor of some WFC.

The reason: If I put 1/2 my BAC allocation into WFC and the other half into GS,
i own the same business mix (investment banking and gambling (a. K proprietary
trading) + banking) at the same PE and with better focus and much stronger
management. Instead of middle of the road (BofA) or even bottom of the barrel
business ( Merrill Lynch) I could own best in class in either sector. Granted
BAC trades for 1.1x tangible book while GS goes for 1.2X and WFC for 1.5x, but
if I have the choice to go for low price/tangible book or better franchise
value and management I'd always go for the latter

Yeah, I missed Subaru back in the day. My error, esp. since I owned one of
their cars. Subaru turned out to be one of the stocks that cemented Lynch's
reputation, esp. if you read "One Up on Wall Street".

I'm saying if I buy a stock because of a business event and the event occurs,
I'll sell the stock if hasn't moved after a while after the event did occur. An
event -- a particular occurrence of something -- is different from normal
quarterly performance.

I'm saying if the company continues to produce results I'll hold the stock. It
is something I partly learned from Subaru. Note I said, "When a stock hasn't
moved and business or book value doesn't seem to have improved after a 2-year
holding", I will sell. Subaru business did improve. Hard to use bv for Japanese
companies, but my point is that if business improves and that's reflected in
the balance sheet (higher bv), I'll try to continue to hold, even if the stock
hasn't moved.

Yes, I'll sometimes sell if a stock pops really fast and strong. Something done
here by several people, and after seeing that so many times, I've succumbed
somewhat also. Theoretically I'm against it: I want to buy undervalued and sell
fully or fairly valued. But the market is volatile, I get scared, "a bird in
the hand", etc., so yes, sometimes I take profits when they come so abruptly.
(Figuring I can reenter for the sold shares if/when stock drops back down.)

Oh and i dont want to even think about merrill, i pretend it doesnt exist. haha

Ron,

Your thoughts could have come in questions instead of attacking me.

The stock to me is just a thing, you can pretend taking ownership in it or
however you want to look at it, but i'm not going to lose what little i do
sleep over it. I dont like to spend to much detailing the financials facts on
here, takes alot of time, everybody can see them on yahoo and are using alot of
the same metrics.

The stock can go lower actually... any time you make a decision to buy the
possibility of going lower is high especially in a really out of favor stock on
the breach of being back where it started in 2009. My point is trading at 1x
tang book and how out of favor it is, i will enter a starting position in some
leaps, same with wfc heading into earnings here. If it goes lower i am going to
be patient reevaluate and see what my options are.

I can look at financials all day and it still just comes down to a few things
whether i want to put my money where my mouth is. I am not really sure what
your trying to say with you quick wit there, but it could trade down to you
name it #x tang book on numerous factors, still has alot of fat hanging on the
side of it with countrywide, merrill, low interest rate environment, housing,
not executing as well as others etc. Any time you go into a stock like BAC,
even strong shareholders can get shaken out of it, still has some downside risk
i think that is fair to say.

I only mention that i talked to bankers because i think its interesting how
they think, i have alot of contacts in the industry and they love to chit chat
especially after a few drinks. If they are telling me whats happening, i wonder
if hedge funds have got the same chit chat.... obviously people already know.

Yes i could very well be a bozo, i am really ok with that, i like genuine
discussion on what goes into peoples decisions on why they are investing, this
forum has been a great outlet for me to not talk to myself all day but this
bozo has done decently well and has not lost a single dime on a yearly basis
since i made my first trade in natural gas futures 5 years ago at the age of
17, yes i was a bozo then too for starting there. : )

Historical BV...

Is there a good place to find the historical BV calculations? The other problem
with BV is it calculates Real estate assets at cost not Market Value.
Therefore, most BV figures would not change from year to year if the companies
real estate assets have increased/decreased substantially.

I am not too sure of the individual components YAHOO Finance uses when
calculating their BV statistics, the biggest factor IMO probably would be the
reduction/increase in company debt.

Do any other of the BV components stand out to you?

Finally, the Price to Sales Ratio is a good one to look at over time especially
if the PE and BV are in value territory. As long as the sales are not dying on
the vine, I will tend to hold on.

I have had many "value" buys where both the PE (<10) and Price/BV (<1.00)
stayed in value territory for many months (over 18). The turn was when sales
eventually stabilized (usually resulted in a falling PSR) and then began to
increase.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Your list of sell criteria is a good one. The other main thing in value
investing is having the patients to wait it out. Sometimes it takes the market
a long time to recognize the hidden value in a company.

Cwillyg,

In general, from my calculations large caps - including tech stocks - are still
somewhat cheap. That's why I don't buy the concern on this and other threads
that we may be at some kind of top. IMHO, both DOW (the lame index - I agree
with Ken Fisher) and SP500 can go up another 20% or more without being
overvalued - this is based on partial examination of the bigger components of
both. Of course, this assumes we don't go into a severe double dip where sales
and earnings plummet from current levels.

If we talk about big techs in specific, I don't think they are screaming buys.
Let's talk about concrete companies. MSFT - on one hand, it is cheap on PE
basis and even more on E/EV basis. On the other hand, MSFT has grown earnings
only about 7% annually for the last 10 years and I don't see how they can grow
more than that in the future. This severely limits upside (if we don't expect
tech bubble where PEs get astronomical). In case of CSCO, I also don't believe
they will achieve higher growth than 10% annual in next 10 years (they grew
only 2% income and 5% sales annual in last 3 years). Again, absent PE
expansion, the returns will not be great.

I don't follow HPQ and INTC closely, but HPQ growth for the last 10 years has
been in 6% range and I don't see that changing. INTC is even worse: they have
not grown much for the last 10 years at all. :(

I own a position in MSFT. I am not looking to buy any of the
four companies mentioned.

Hello Jurgis,

Yes, I see your reasoning. I mean, the way these stocks are currently priced, I
think the market is agreeing with you about future growth rates. If future
growth rates for these companies is really on the order of less than 5% a year,
then these stocks may be fairly priced today.

It's so tough for me to trust company and analyst earnings estimates these
days, but I'm more likely to give the benefit of the doubt to large global
companies than to small caps in the U.S. these days.

Tricky days. What's interesting to me on a macro basis is that the Nasdaq 100
is at least within shouting distance of the October 2008 highs, while these
large caps are languishing. I think AAPL is really powering that index these
days. So, I don't know, the market could pull back and these large cap stocks
could get cheaper than they already are.

Yes, INTC pulled off a good quarter. I actually pulled the trigger about an
hour before close as I had sold SGY today and wanted to roll it into one of the
four stocks we were talking about. So, I chose to up my position to 5% in INTC
instead of buying any HPQ or upping my position in MSFT or CSCO above 5%. That
being said, even on earnings beats, these stocks don't run much in a day, so
for the moment I bought at a decent time, but hopefully INTC goes up tomorrow,
which is a new world. :)

Good discussion today.

re Senea, OI - maybe we should invest in those business that make the cans
rather those that fill and sell them. I bought a starter in OI today, which
appears to be reasonably cheap.

What attracted me to OI it appears to be cheaper than peers (PE ~9x,
EV/EBITDA~5.7 - the latter indicates that even adjusted for it's leverage, OI
is cheaper than peers BLL or PXG for example. Another plus - about 30% of OI
revenues are coming from emerging markets (the profit contribution is even
higher), which should help growth in this fairly mature business/

Hi Madharry -

Property Title Insurers - A value Buy or a potential Liability?

Old Republic International Corp (NYSE: ORI)
First American Corporation (New(NYSE: FAF)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ORI,FAF&d=s

Is there a value opportunity in this foreclosure paperless trail mess? If title
might be clouded could title companies see a new revenue source by charging a
premium for providing title insurance on these properties?

What about a software company providing an integrated certified "electronic
title record" system that replaces the old paper system(s). It seems outdated
to require a "wet" signature on all documents. I wonder who might have such a
system available: Oracle, Microsoft, Xerox.

When I was buying foreclosure properties in the early 90's all of our title
record searches were done at the county office using microfiche readers. Many
of the title companies had their own proprietary quasi "electronic" systems but
nothing was integrated.

It was a pretty inefficient system which allowed us buyers an advantage when
buying properties at the court house steps. It was not uncommon to be the only
bidder on properties paying $0.60 on the dollar - all cash. We were able to
make a lot of excellent "value" buys.

It seems like there is an opportunity (especially if Congress mandated) for a
company to provide an integrated "certified" electronic title and document
system.

Refinance mortgage - Good time to do it. I did it earlier but had to overcome a
list of new restrictions for an investment property that I never had (I had
refinanced this property 3 times earlier). Now, after I refinanced, I found out
that the new lender requires me to jack up my previous fire insurance limit
minimum to a higher amount although I have a large equity in the property. This
cost me more money for insurance which I never expected or needed.

Also, as interest rate dropped, mortgage companies & lenders edge up the
fees/points to compensate for the reduced interest rates and lower payments. I
opted for slightly higher interest rates in lieu of higher fees (I actually got
a fee rebate at the end of the refinance for taking that program). I took this
approach because this is an investment property and I was looking for a no fee
loan so that I have no out-of-pocket cost to refinance (I got a fee rebate
instead to reduce cost). You might pick a different approach for your own
property since you plan to stay in it for a while. I, myself, don't know how
long I might keep the investment property so I picked the program with the
least up-front cost.

EPD. I'll average up on my position with a few more shares. This lp is very
expensive (ref: Spekulatius comments here), and the stock has now surpassed at
least one analyst's target goal; the distribution yield is now low at 5.5%.

If I understand correctly, some oil people believe Eagle Ford will be VERY
prolific given the new drilling techniques. (We have the Chinese as the latest
believers as they now come in to partner up with Chesapeake to spend $Billions
in the Eagle Ford .) The way I look at it is that EPD ranges over the e&p
companies that will be involved the Texas Eagle Ford oil/gas play. EPD with its
pipelines, processing and storage facilities, is going to profit regardless of
which e&p companies pull the oil/gas here.

It seems to me that EPD is almost guaranteed to do very well here, and for that
(assuming I'm correct), I am willing to pay up for my shares now. Over the next
few years, EPD stock "should" rise and the shareholder distributions "should"
increase.

I think that is a valid risk re RIM that businesses would migrate to other

earnings power they have demonstrated over >5 years now. If they lose customers
here and there (which I imagine will be unlikely given IT people's distaste for
change in the corporate world...the staying power of SAP, IBM and Microsoft
being a case in point) then growth in BRIC economy businesses is more than
likely to replace them as they move up the value chain and use BBerry-like

Hi Spekulatius

MLPs vs Holding Cash vs owning "other" income producing assets (like real
estate)

The Fed plans to start their QE2 program in early November which could last 11
months at $100 Billion per month. My credit union pays 1% and most liquid cash
holdings are generating less than that. So much money is flooding the world
markets that some analysts are looking at a possible "Green" Swan event where
the market spikes significantly higher.

I have been building up my cash reserves perhaps looking at moving some of the
proceeds into income producing real estate. After a brief trip (last weekend)
to view properties I have had my eye on for several years, I saw the most "For
Rent" signs ever. Prices are just getting down to where the cash flows begin to
work (as long as tenants can pay their rent). I still believe I can hold off
for another year and still see prices at the same or lower levels. It's a
little scary to hold vacant units.

MLPs are sort of the next best thing to owning the actual real property and
operating it. The key fundamental is the cash flow the asset generates and the
future increase in the income streams from their different operation(s). One
continuing growth area I see are the NG gathers, pipeline transportation &
storage operators. The good ones are definitely not cheap but IMO still have a
favorable niche growth profile especially in a generally slow growth US
economy.

There is a lot more work in managing a real property asset (ie duplex) than
completing the UBTI paperwork on an MLP (especially now that the reports can be
downloaded). MLPs are more liquid than an income producing real estate
investment and can provide more diversification too

I think there are a lot more investors that are looking for alternative
investments other than the stock market. They never want to experience another
market crash. Perhaps that is why you are seeing money finding it's way to
farmland and just sitting in a low yielding money funds.

Eventually the QE2 is going to tip the scale (never fight the FED) and either
(1) the market takes off to ridiculous valuation levels or (2) massive
inflation hits certain market sectors (we have seen this in gold and other
commodities and FINALLY (3) money fund & even Bond fund holders will give up on
their low yields and jump back into the stock market. MLPs should be an
attractive place for these investors to land because of their large
distribution pay outs (even though some of that is return of capital) and their
reoccurring revenue streams.

Largest Positions

BGEIX (10%) - American Century Large Cap Gold Miner Fund
TWEAX (9%) - Equity Income Fund

The asbestos liability issue got more attention in the media about ten years
ago, and so correspondingly, also here. At the time, the respected thread
contributor here, professional value analyst and then fund manager, Jim Clarke,
recommended to just avoid any stock with asbestos liability because it was
likely you couldn't quantify the risks (exposure costs). That advice served me
well, if I remember. Basically, if a hard-core analytical guy (Jim Clarke)
couldn't ascertain the risk/reward proposition, then that killed it for me.
Maybe issues/risks/numbers are more clear to analysts now, now that it's about
a decade later.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Apollo-Group-Inc-Reports-bw-1596225641.html?x=0&.
=1 Q4 is not that bad, the big bite is a goodwill writeoff.

However, if enrollment drops 40%+ and earnings drop accordingly, the company is
not really undervalued. Considering earning run rate at about 300M per year the
straightforward PE is about 17. If the company can grow at 20% from the drop to
300M, then it's a buy, if it only grows at about 15% from there, then it's not.
:)

300M might be conservative, however, I don't account for any lawsuits, fixed
overhead, additional regulations, loan losses, etc. So it might be also very
optimistic...

Anyone has other thoughts?

JOE: Some analysts have responded with contra-Einhorn arguments.

Ref. Barron's:

"INVESTOR BRUCE BERKOWITZ'S motto is, "Ignore the Crowd." On Wednesday, he did
just that, buying more shares of St. Joe even as the stock was plummeting.

Berkowitz's Fairholme Capital Management filed documents with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on Thursday revealing that the firm and offshoot
Fairholme Fund had purchased 135,600 shares in St. Joe (ticker: JOE) on
Wednesday. The shares cost Berkowitz $3 million, or about $22.16 each on
average. Berkowitz's buys were tiny in comparison to his total holdings in St.
Joe. He now owns 26.89 million shares, or 29% of the real-estate developer.

But the timing of the buys was conspicuous. Berkowitz's decision to raise his
stake came hours after David Einhorn of hedge fund Greenlight Capital made a
case at the Value Investing Congress conference in New York for shorting St.
Joe's stock..."

"...Some St. Joe analysts were likewise unmoved by Einhorn's presentation.
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Sheila McGrath wrote in a note on Thursday that
Einhorn's concerns about the company are "overblown." McGrath added, "We do not
believe there are accounting issues at St. Joe." She reiterated a Market
Perform rating and $30 price target.

Michael Gaiden, a Morningstar analyst with a $50 fair value for St. Joe,
likewise found Einhorn's presentation unpersuasive. He says in an interview
that St. Joe is facing problems similar to other Florida landowners.

"I think we're looking at trough valuations in real estate, particularly in the
panhandle," he says.

Gaiden took a trip down to Florida to visit some St. Joe properties in
September, and says he came away with a different impression from Einhorn. He
says the new local airport in Panama City Beach had a "healthy level of
activity" and the company's retail properties were "bustling."

"I don't think there was anything tremendously new in [Einhorn's]
presentation," he says."

2. Einhorn is known for doing his homework and so if I had to choose between
Einhorn's opinion and that of a Morningstar Analyst Im going with Einhorn.

3. The company's response to Einhorn's comments about owning lots of land in an

I'm not selling this short but I dont see incentive to purchase when there are

companies that will benefit over the coming years from Eagle Ford.

I play the Eagle Ford in several ways:

1. I took on a few shares of EOG. It's among the first movers into the area and
it has among the largest positions. EOG is big (relatively) and has positions
in other oil shales, so it is not a pure play Eagle Ford. Petrohawk is similar.

2. There are some multinationals that have interests in Eagle Ford. COP and
also STO are examples. Compared to Conoco, Statoil just because it's relatively
unknown to USA people (I assume) means it's somewhat overlooked. Again though,
Eagle Ford just a small part of STO. (I have a few shares of STO)

3. There are several small or mid-size e&p companies that have positions in
Eagle Ford. Some are: CRZO , GEOI, SFY, MHR, ROSE, CXPO. These are not pure
plays on Eagle Ford. I have positions in some of these.

4. There are a few pure plays; they seem to be very small e&p companies. I've
not looked at these yet.

Here's a summary article I like for Eagle Ford ideas:

Asset Manager stocks: I looked at Janus after seeing Barron's reported that a
presenter at the Value Investing Congress mentioned JNS (but apparently didn't
recommend it specifically). Janus seems to fit my criterion for a buy based on
the one metric I use -- enterprise value to aum. I'm in for a few shares this
morning.

My small asset manager basket now includes:

Hi Paul -

Samson Oil & Gas Limited Sponso (AMEX: SSN)

Does SSN report their earnings in $AU or $US ? I believe the $AU trades at
parody with the $US (based on today's quote - 1st time in 25 years!) and
thought with the potential of more QE2 and debasing of the $US, SSN might also
be a good currency hedge.

I am looking to start a position but did not know what percentage of their
assets were located in Australia. Also, I was not clear if any of their
domestic earnings would be subject to that natural resource tax the Aussie Gov
was proposing.

It seems that SSN could provide some additional value (as a currency hedge)
other than through their E&P operations.

Any thoughts?

Well at least you dont won cown! I dont know that much about the business of
asset managers but what I do know on a macro basis doesnt augur that well for
them. As a group I dont think they are generating enough alpha for even an
unsophisticated investor to own them and pay fees above combinations of index
funds and etfs. I have had oak intl through my wifes holdings for 11 years and
the net performance after fees and expenses are taken out has been mediocre at
a time when international was absolutely the place to be, the money market
funds and bond funds cant justify much in the way of fees now, so unless you
are a hedge fund manager fogget about it.

Maybe LM will work out as Miller does seem to be a cut above the rest and
technology should do well.

SSN. Reports in Australian $. All of their oil/gas holdings are in USA. There's
no currency play as far as I can tell, because all revenue and almost all
expenses are incurred in the USA (i.e. in US dollars). They've got A$ millions
in cash, but this will soon be spent, and unless the dollar declines quickly
and drastically, it won't make much difference to company net asset values.

Correction: I confused two oil plays. It's the Eagle Ford that's in South Texas
that has the broad geographical expanse. I wrongly wrote Three Forks - that's a
North Dakota Bakken play.

That was an interesting article thank you. I'm not sure that the dividend model
presented is one that I was use as being reflected as likely price of an index
7 years from now. it makes an assumption that the dividend will grow from 2% to
3.7% over the next seven years and that there will be no buybacks. Who know is
they will be valid assumptions. Im not an spy player but I think I can find
pockets of undervalued situations that will do better than the earnings yield
of spy 500.

re Hussman. As Madharry pointed out, the estimated return in Husman's article
is based on the assumption that the Dividend yield that is currently below the
historical mean will return to the LT mean of 3.7% and that it will take 7
years to do so.

There are a few problems - the payout ratio (ratio of Dividends/earnings) is
lower than it used to be decades ago. Also, competing bond yields are much
lower as well. I would argue that the earnings yield (reverse PE) is much more
important than dividend yield - either that or a lower payout ratio should
result in earnings growth above the LT growth rate.

Small changes cause huge deviations in the expected return. Overall I agree
that the market looks fairly valued and perhaps overvalued, but that I why we
get together here to sniff out better values and obtain better returns. If
anything, a possible strategy might be to hedge by shorting the market against
the value investments of choice.

I would also point out that Hussman doesnt analyze the makeup of the spy500
which is currently technology 22%, financials 15% vs only 3+% of utilities. the
financials have experienced severe cutbacks in dividends, and dividends in
technology have always been small. Energy which has been a good payer of
dividends is currently only 11% of the spy500. See sectorspdr.com for more
details.

Fair enough - all valid points. However two further points added to my position
on BBerry's dominance

1) I could not understand why teenagers liked them at all, considering the
lower ability to use music application and internet on them. Until one of them
told me that it was unlimited free texting through BBerry server, and that
everyone she knew had one for that reason alone. Android and iPhone can't beat
that and are essentially in a different market

2) BBerry server and the back-end processes are more sticky for bank and secure
application businesses - the security involved is so much greater than for
other solutions that I don't see banks - for example - switching. Granted, I
agree with you that iPhone is far better for many things (I have one, and
wouldn't trade it for the world), but my BBerry is not used for browsing, but
business connectivity. Given my firm is still on Lotus Notes, it will simply
not change from BBerry now it has selected and implemented it.

Finally, the balance sheet is safe, debt free and stable...I don't need the
growth, and I can afford a huge amount of switching as it is not priced as tech
boom companies were on their ascent...
