I gave Unifirst a close look two weeks ago. It looks very attractive. Read the
footnotes carefully, though. There is an accounting glitch here. But certainly
that doesn't affect the growth story if you're looking long term. I've got to
return to the financials and really model what the accounting glitch has done
to earnings. (look at the footnote for depreciation of uniforms)

Did anybody else have a huge week. Was this a value rally? I've been completely
out of touch the last two days on a business trip. I guess maybe it was just
coming to me - I had been getting absolutely creamed for the last six months.
Clayton and Ambac up 15%, Sara Lee up 10%, Amazon down big (yeah, I know - I
just can't cover this one - I covered Citigroup last week at 42 and change -
thank God.)

Mike, I will look with interest at your net-net screen. I thought I had the
only one, but I use software that only professionals can afford (i.e. I don't
pay for it). I still haven't filled my position - I bought about 1/3 of what I
want, then the price ran up on me. If you picked this one up on your screen
though, I'd be tempted to disclose it anyway. Not to promise that I will.

I bought St. Joe at the open today. Thanks for the heads up. I put in the order
last night right after I read Wright's post and then saw that the stock was
only up to 23.

If I had to put all my money on one stock and hold it for five years it would
be Clayton Homes. Even at 10. My conviction level has increased significantly.

Mike, that screen is incredible. Everyone on the thread is going to hate me for
saying this, but FIND A WAY TO CHARGE FOR IT. YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PRODUCT. NOBODY
ELSE DOES THIS.

Or are you holding out for the IPO of DrMike.com. In that case, just get me
1000 shares at the offering price, ok pal. I'll wash your car. I'll walk your
dog...there are some things I won't do, even for money.

You talk about the internet destroying opportunities. I start with the same raw
list you do, and then do the same weeding you do (but I don't have to publish
it, so its a lot less labor intensive - I cut out 2/3 of the list by sight -
i.e. is there any way I would ever invest in this company no matter what the
numbers - but I know the list you're starting with). The only way I know of
that this list could have been generated before Mike found this free thing was
with a VERY expensive product called Factset. Factset is a publicly traded
company you can short. Game over for those guys in the long run if free
screening is getting to this level.

It also tells you something else. The Pensobscots aren't going to be there any
more. This is market efficiency rearing its ugly head somewhere where it hurts
me - in $10 million net-nets. You may be happy about this development, but this
is not a good thing.

All credit to Mike, though. He has truly broken new ground here. Once again,
CHARGE FOR IT! A LOT. (I figure if you charge about $10,000 for your screen, I
might still be able to buy my Pensbcots at 6. You make money, I make money.
Win-win, right?) Or maybe the correct way to make money off this screen is to
make me pay for you NOT to post it publicly.

In all seriousness, this thread is going to go to new levels with that kind of
raw material for everybody to work with. I look forward to seeing the posts in
the next few weeks.

And yes, the mystery net-net is on your list.

Mike, re. your net-net screen using StockQuest,

I tried to duplicate your results using StockQuest data I downloaded today, but
I ended up with nearly 3X the stocks as you.

You said you found 47 under 66.67%.

I came up with 157 stocks under 66.67% with the mechanical screen, and this
dropped only to 133 when I added your extra criterion debt/equity < 0.5.

I noticed that none of your stocks had a market cap under $2.5 M, whereas 47 of
mine did. Eliminating those 47 super-tiny stocks reduced my list down to only
86 stocks, which is still nearly twice as many as yours.

I wonder if we did it differently?

I hadn't used StockQuest in a long time, so maybe I did something wrong. Would
you be kind enough to take a look at the following, and tell me if you did it
differently?

Here is the criterion I used:

{MktCap}<0.66667*({workingcap}-{LTDebt})

where the last two quantities are user-created variables that I defined as
follows:
{workingcap} = {CURASTQ}-{CURLIABQ}
{LTDebt} = {DBTLT2EQQ}*{MKTCAP}/{PR2BOOKQ}

note: all quantities that are not ratios are expressed by MarketGuide in
millions.

D,

Good observations. I did indeed set the minimum market cap at $2.5 million. I
changed the web site to reflect that error.

I used
1) Market Cap < (NWK * 2/3), where NWK is CA-CL
2) Total Debt/Equity <50

This gave me an exportable list of 99 names and values that I could put in
Excel and work with. Then I manually entered restricted cash, long-term debts,
long-term liabilities, and minority interest, and subtracted all that from the
NWK value to give a new column, net net value. Given that I was going to have
to manually check the market caps and share amounts anyway, I figured this was
feasible. Doing it your way - figuring out the LT debt variable with a
user-defined formula - is a good short cut, and in fact Graham's formula really
just uses LTD. I take it a step further. So your net is bigger, and hence you
catch more fish.

A lot of the valuations changed in a big way when I looked at the true
liabilities and true market caps. I eliminated several that were not currently
reporting, or had unreliable data. Nearly 30 turned out to have MK/NN ratios
greater than 1.

I would not be surprised if your method turned out to be the best quickie way
to find net nets on the net. The extra time spent screening your extra fish may
be less than my extra research time.

Good investing,
Mike

nobody will be charged for anything posted there, and there won't be any

all weekend, and then q3 in-house call next month...can you believe that I
haven't had a chance yet to look at my own list of net nets with a critical eye
for investment purposes? And I probably won't find that time for the next week
at least? I think your segment remains safe for now. DrMike.com? I'll check on
it - I tried to register whatsupdoc.com, and at first it appeared available (my
heart skipped a beat - i'd make millions), then it turns out it wasn't. C'est

From:Q.

Mike, you must have the patience of Job to open 99 filings on Edgar.

Considering that I am more impatient, and that I would only want to buy one or
two stocks from such a list anyway, I think I would apply additional criteria
to reduce the list to a dozen or so, and then open the filings.

I tried the following ideas, which reduced the list to 7 stocks before I opened
any filings:

Starting with your three criteria, market cap < 0.667 * netnet, debt/equity <
0.5, and market cap > $2.5 M, I have a list of 84 stocks.

Over a dozen of those are OTC:BB or pink sheets. I eliminate all of them, since
I would never buy a stock traded on these exchanges, unless it were an ADR of a
big foreign company (and such a stock would likely not be a net-net anyway).
Adding this criterion reduces my list from 84 to 70.

Since a lot of these tiny stocks are illiquid, I then eliminate those with a
monthly dollar volume under a certain threshold of, let's say, $250k. That
reduces the list to 45 stocks.

As another tradeability criterion, I set a lower bound on the stock price of
$2. That reduces the list to 19 stocks.

Stocks on nasdaq must meet listing requirements, and tiny stocks are in danger
of falling below those requirements and getting delisted. I would like to
eliminate those with net tangible assets close to the delisting threshold, but
I can't using StockQuest, so as a proxy for net tangible assets I'll use
shareholders equity, which I compute from the price/book ratio. I'll eliminate
those stocks with shareholders equity less than $5 M. This reduces the list to
11 stocks.

Tiny market cap stocks are always in danger of going out of business, if they
have liquidity problems, so I eliminated those with cashflow less than +0.2% of
working capital. (I computed the cashflow from the price/cashflow ratio.) This
reduced the list to 8 stocks.

The survivors at this point are:
data frdm holx istn pdkl wstna spa spor

I'll immediately ignore wstna, because the "a" at the end suggests that there
are more than one class of common stock, so maybe the market cap is likely
higher than MarketGuide shows.

That gives us 7 stocks.

Now we have a list that is short enough for me to open some filings. I can do
this in 5 minutes, if I take the following expediency: If I see restricted
cash, preferred stock, multiple classes of common, or a large amount of
goodwill, I drop the stock from the list. That's all I do in this first pass
through the filings. It is easier than extracting the numbers and putting them
into a calculation. Maybe I eliminate one stock that I would otherwise keep,
but it saves me a lot of time.

Doing this with the filings, I eliminate FRDM (multiple classes of common), and
PDKL (preferred stock).

This leaves me with 5 stocks, which is something that I could imagine actually
researching:

data holx istn wstna spa spor

Here's a link to Yahoo with charts etc for these 5 stocks:

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=data+holx+istn+spa+spor&d=b

Taking a look at the charts, I wouldn't be surprised to see some tax-loss
selling between now and December, so I would probably wait until year-end to
buy any of these.

Any thoughts on this stream-lined method?

re: DEFERRED CONTRACT REVENUE, my understanding is that they have already
received cash (or booked an A/R amount) for work that has not yet been
performed. The amount of this liability balances out the amount of the cash or
A/R item.

When the work is performed, no additional cash is received or A/R produced, the
liability is reduced by the amount of work performed, and that is recognized as
income at that time.

Microsoft does this. It is an attempt to smooth out product sales over the life
cycle of the product.

Clayton Link --

ftp://better-investing.org/pub/i-club-list-files/jimclayton.txt

It is worth a look. Here's a sample...

"Where does that leave Clayton Homes? We have seen industry downturns before.
From 1983 until 1991, industry shipments contracted 8% each year, yet we
managed to sell more homes each year by expanding geographically and by
prudently opening new plants and retail stores in promising areas. The last few
years have seen hyper growth in the industry. Companies were paying $11 million
for twenty year old plants as we built new, state of the art plants for $5
million. During the consolidation frenzy, companies were paying more than 20
times earnings for retail stores, while we refused to pay more than net asset
value. We were criticized then for not growing as rapidly as the others, but we
have no goodwill on our books.

Our President of Retail, David Booth, will not open a store until he has an
experienced manager who wants to live in that area. Others will open stores
without regard to staffing. Our President of Manufacturing, Rick Strachan,
conducts careful market studies before choosing the location of a new plant."

I understand why SNH is so tempting, with its extremely high yield, but after
reading the prospectus (available on the company website in .pdf format) I
decided to pass. With a number of its renters in deep financial trouble, the
yield is probably an illusion. The other half of the spinoff, HRP at less than
$9.50, has a great, though not as high, yield, and much better tenants:
Government, big companies like McDonalds and Federal Express. Average office
lease runs 7 years. And HRP was beaten down just like SNH after the split, just
the opposite of what you would think would happen. So I think it's the better
REIT of the two for an aggressive but prudent investor.

&#209; ISTN 'DEFERRED CONTRACT REVENUE' That one caught my eye too. My best
understanding is that they set up a reserve to cover claims against the
warrantees and this deferred revenue is that reserve. I believe they've played
it pretty conservatively so far. One check on accruals is cash flow from
operations. Here's a $26 million market cap that's on track to generate nearly
$13 million CFO this year.
Oh, and they not only sell cars on the web...they sell the warranties too [the

This web stuff, if it gets noticed, could be a catalyst.

Robert Hoefer: re HRP The whole idea of the split was to get HRP seen as an
office REIT and to trade at or near office REIT yield. Hasn't worked out that
way, partially because HRP still retains 50% of SNH but the net FFO/income
exposure is pretty small. If HRP were to trade at same yield as average office
REIT [based on 9/30 NAREIT data] it would have to jump about 75% in price.
There are some negatives like the SNH exposure, some conflicts of interest, and
management structure that weigh against that, but a solid jump from here is
certainly due.
I noticed in your profile you sometimes look at bankruptcies. What's your take
on the issue of whether rent seniority becomes a ball in the air if [when] one
of the SNH operators goes BK. I know it's supposed to work that way, but I'm
seeking experienced perspective.
With SNH it looks like EBITDAR coverage is solid on all but the Mariner [11% of
assets] and there the rent is 5% of pre-lease operating expenses so it would
seem they could cut costs enough keep payin rent on most of the properties. SNH
should be able to release a small number, IMO.

Bob, re. ISTN, I found the explanation in the 10k for "Deferred contract
revenue"

Revenues are deferred on vehicle service contracts in
those instances where the Company directly receives cash for that portion of
the
total service contract that is allocated to estimated claims reserves. Deferred
contract revenue is recorded as earned over the life of the service contract in
proportion to expected claims.

It seems to me that this is essentially a long-term liability, because the
company expects that it must pay this cash back, as claims come in.

So we should subtract it from the working capital to get the net-net value.
It's such a huge number for ISTN that it takes the net-net value way down from
$40 M way down to merely $8 M.

Thus, the stock trades at 3X net-net, rather than 65% of net-net. Big
difference.

This stock might still be a great buy for other reasons, but I wouldn't buy it
for the liquidation value of the company. It should be disqualified from a
net-net list.

&#209; Your are correct on all counts. I was just about to post a correction to

caught in you net net, though, cause the more I look at it the better I like
it. Most of the net nets I've seen have negative earnings Tsunami's headed at
their cash that would change the picture within a few quarters. ISTN is the
reverse. It's got very high levels of cash building from operations. A better
situation, IMO. It's just puzzling that the market isn't seeing it that
way...makes me wonder what I'm missing.
Speaking of recent net nets, I added to my OPTS position when it pulled back to

I define a net-net as net current assets minus ALL the other liabilities, not
just long term debt. Something like deferred revenue gets subtracted - no
question about it. I think it was Buffett that said spend your time thinking
about the assets - assume the liabilities are all real. Another thing - when
I'm doing net-nets, if the accounting is at all difficult to understand, I stop
right there. Just my way of doing things. It works for me.

among the net-nets, SPOR might be interesting. It is profitable, with positive
cashflow from operations.

SPOR is a golf-clothing designer. The stock has fallen, probably due to
declining revenues and margins, so you wouldn't want to buy it for growth, but
... the balance sheet really is strong.

It is selling at 59% of net-net.

The only item on the balance sheet that might be questionable is inventory --
they did write off $1 M of inventory in the last FY. If you were really radical
and assumed that all the remaining $13 M inventory was worthless, the stock
would still be only 1.2 X net-net.

The co. has done some share buy-backs, and there was insider buying after the
stock fell last spring.

I haven't done enough DD on SPOR yet, but my quick glance at the 10k says it
might be worth a longer look.

Bob, re: SNH. First of all, I am jumping in over my head since this discussion

place it outside the blue chip category, but it has to be worth more than the
current market. As to rent senority, I have no experience to guide me on that
issue, which is one reason I have to pass on the stock. My experience does tell
me never to get involved in something I don't understand. Someone with the
skills to determine SNH value to the penny, in the style of Michael Price,
might make a good return for the risk. But with so many better REITS
historically cheap right now, a novice like me does best to stick with the best

I sold all the REITs in my mother's account the other day to take a small tax

I have been buying a REIT mutual fund in my own retirement account as well (now
about 20% of my retirement money all bought in the last month - another 50% is
in Japan with a 25% gain since I started making that move in June. That has
been my investment home run for the year - sell virtually all of my S+P index

From:Daniel Chisholm

James, I'll admit that I am totally innocent on REITs. Part of your analysis of
Penobscot that intrigued me was that you were able to put a Graham-style
rock-bottom valuation on the real estate portion of the stock (IIRC you valued
it as a leaky flea ridden warehouse ;-).

As a result of the ongoing discussion here, I was discussing REITs with my
broker recently. He said that here in Canada REITs have been traditionally
targeted towards and accepted by income investors, and have therefore
historically been modestly priced and generous in yield (parenthetically, he
mentioned how Canadian REITs had been burned by high leverage in the past, and
are now remarkably light on leverage - like 20% or so). On the other hand, he
said that in the US REITs have been viewed more as speculative vehicles (an
opportunity to participate in rising real estate prices), and have therefore
been priced more as "growth" (read: expensive) than as an "income" asset. This
didn't jibe with all that I have read here about REITs, selling at huge (>>10%)
yields -- was what my broker telling me correct at some point in the near past,
but there has since been a bit of a meltdown in US REIT psychology, from
"go-go" to "deep value"?

I have nothing against buying $1.50 of assets for $1.00, but I am intrinsically
suspicious (perhaps cautious would be a less-paranoid word) of real estate
valuations. Tell me that REIT XYZ is trading at 67% of the value of its
holdings and I won't get too excited - what's the point of a 1/3 off sale if
the merchandise is priced 300% north of sanity?

Tell me an REIT is yielding 15-20% earnings or 20-25% cash flow, and I'll
certainly be interested enough to dig deeper and investigate sustainability,
leverage, downside (e.g. how much could SNH's rents drop), etc.

I guess determining "intrinsic value" of real estate is more difficult than
other things, since it is difficult to determine what another (greater fool?)
would be willing to take it off of your hands for when you need to sell. So I
suppose everyone must to a certain extent close their eyes to the price (ouch!
sounds dangerous!), and value properties on the basis of some multiple of the
or cash flow a property generates (which would be related to the level of rents
that the market will bear).

This is what I'd like to ask you. When you analyze an REIT, how do you develop
comfort in the value of the underlying assets and that there is a real margin
of safety in the book value? Or do you need to? I guess what I'm asking here is
that if this is the case of a high yielding long life asset -- in which case
return of original capital is not necessary in order for it to have been a good
investment.

(E.g., if you determine that they can sustain a certain level of cash flow
(dividends) to shareholders (say, 15% a year for 20 years), and have (say) a
98% chance of not going bankrupt in that period, then recovering value from the
properties or selling them at a profit 20 years down the road doesn't make too
much a difference Present-Value wise)

From:Q.

Daniel, while some investors focus on the most important multiple for a REIT is
price/FFO, where FFO = funds from operations, which is a non-GAAP number
peculiar to REITS; it is nearly the same thing as cash flow from operations in
GAAP accounting. FFO is the cash that is available for paying dividends, and
what is left over from that is available for funding growth. You can find it
mentioned in the SEC filings for the REIT.

Like a regular stock that has growth, a REIT will have a FFO growth rate, as
the firm raises rents and develops or acquires more property. A big part of
what you get, when you buy a REIT, is not just the yield, but also the growth.
That growth in FFO allows the REIT to raise dividends in the future. This
distinguishes it from true fixed-income investing.

It's not hard to find REITs that have a 7% yield and a 7% FFO growth rate,
giving you an expected total return of about 14%. If you think about it, this
might be more attractive than buying a REIT with a 14% yield. If you look only
at yields, you can get thrown off.

The yield basically reflects how the risk that the market see in the FFO and
dividend. If the firm has good steady growth, a strong balance sheet,
experienced management, and it operates in a sector that isn't getting
overbuilt, then it might trade at a high price and therefore a low yield.

mainly in the solid Calif market with a bit of Arizona and Texas. Their debt
load is typical but they are on the lower end of my capitalization size rannge

With a sharp bottom like that, there was probably no practical way of timing an

finished taking positions in these sectors today, buying KIM as a REIT and
following your suggestion with SPF as a homebuilder.

SPF as you mention is not the biggest homebuilder, so I probably would not
choose it as my only homebuilder, but since I already own most of the bigger

GAI is a debt-free, marginally profitable Hong Kong-based contract manufacturer
of small household appliances, which is selling at 80% of cash value and 45% of
book. (Best site for info is their homepage:
http://www.businesswire.com/cnn/gai.shtml Brands include Hamilton Beach(R),
Krups(R), Morphy Richards(R), Moulinex(R), Mr. Coffee(R), Oster(R),
Proctor-Silex(R), Remington(R), Sunbeam(R), Vidal Sassoon(R), and Welbilt(R).)

In brief, these guys were contracted by Al "Chainsaw" Dunlap to manufacture for
Sunbeam. They did an IPO during the spring of 1998 to finance factories. When
Al departed, GAI just put the cash into T-bills.

Largest shareholders are Baupost 12% (principal Seth Klarman wrote Margin of
Safety) and Brookside/Sankaty 8.7% (principal Mitt Romney currently pulling
together Salt Lake City Olympics). Klarman is pushing for sale or liquidation
of company.

GAI is looking to buy someone else. Or they may look to get bought. Or they may
continue to buy back shares. In any case, net-nets sell at net-net for
reason(s). Maybe something good will come along.

The other recent mention I found intriguing is VUL. I have followed up on the
securities. On the Yahoo board for VUL someone has posted them to the great
consternation of the company. The valuation appears to be accurate. I had
personal experience with the liquidation of American Controlled Industries
(ACI) which was run by the same folks. ACI was dismantled in a fashion that
appeared to be very favorable to shareholders. I would not be shocked if VUL
were to distribute these shares on a pro-rata basis as a return of capital as
part of the ultimate winding up of the business. The question would be when?
But with the principals in their 70's, it's can't be too far off. Meanwhile, I
don't mind betting on a basket containing midwestern banks, RBOC's, and
electric utilities. Even if the market cratered, the NAV should be above
current stock price on VUL. The Michigan forest land, Tennessee foam rubber

re. FRDM, it's a jewelry store chain in the South. I suppose only someone who's
lived there would have heard about it.

I feel uneasy investing in retail unless I can actually do the Peter Lynch
thing and visit a store.

Market cap is about 9% higher than indicated by MarketGuide, due to class B
stock.

Two issues I noticed in a quick glance at the 10Q:

1. The CEO is the controlling shareholder. With micro caps this is not
uncommon, but it still makes me nervous as you can have conflicts of interest.
Moreover, in this case the guy has done it in a particularly distasteful way:
he doesn't own that much, but he does own all the class B stock, which gets to
choose 75% of the directors. I don't like a governance structure that is
intended to defeat the common shareholder, and that's what this is.

2. There is an asset that you might question: The co. is owed money by another
firm controlled by the same CEO, and this other firm is in default. The 10Q
argues why it thinks this debt is collectable, but it doesn't sound very
encouraging to me. If you don't count this asset, the stock still sells below
100% net-net. Just the same, there's the prospect for some bad news.

And you have to wonder at management's wisdom, and conflicts of interest, in
borrowing money from a bank and then loaning it to a firm controlled by the
CEO, when that firm subsuquently defaults.

The PE to Growth (PEG) Ratio is defined as:

PE
PE to Growth (PEG) = ----------
EPS Growth

This ratio is based on the assumption that it is reasonable for the PE value of
a company that has rapidly growing earnings to be greater than the PE value of
a company that has slowly growing earnings. Intuitively that seems reasonable.
However, it is reasonable to ask: Is the relationship between PE and Growth
really this simple?

BACKGROUND A number of articles have been written concerning an appropriate
value for PEG (but I am not prepared to quote a specific example). I remember
reading one article that said a study of many companies over many years showed
that PEG averaged about 1.5 and seemed to range between 1 and 2. Another
article in the Wall Street Journal stated that "price hits a wall" when PEG
gets above 1.

Does anyone have any thoughts about this? I have tried to find an article
containing a derivation showing why PEG is a valid measure of value. So far I
have not been successful. Maybe PEG is a rule-of-thumb relationship supported
by historical data. I do not know.

The current "conventional wisdom" seems to be that it is desirable for PEG to
be less than 1.

USING PEG When you see a published value for PEG you should ask yourself: What
PE and Growth rate were used? The discussion of the PE ratio in part 5 pointed
out some of the uncertainty involved in the PE calculation. Also, the selection
of a future growth rate is often very subjective. The selected growth rate
could be selected based on historical data, the next full year estimate, the
next 5-year estimate, etc. As such, it is often possible to rationalize almost
any value of PEG you want. In order to calculate PEG, what judgment would you
utilize to select a PE value and Growth value?

Recently Jim Dickerson posted the following comment on the NAIC forum:"I think
the logic behind using PEG <= 1 as a basis for buying a stock is that you
should not pay at a higher current PE than a stock is projected to grow in the
future. I believe, historically, PE's usually match growth rates. The PEG ratio
is just a way of saying how much the market is willing to pay for the future
growth of a company. It should be highest for financially stable companies with
predictable earnings growth rates. Rather than using PEG<=1 as a broad rule of
thumb, IMO, it might be better to compare PEG ratios of companies with similar
prospects. "The term "similar prospects" means companies with approximately
equal earnings predictability and growth rate. Jim's comment sounds reasonable
to me.I tend to think that a high PEG value is a warning that PE values may
become lower in the future. The higher the value of PEG, the greater the
probability that the PE value will decrease. Hence the PEG value could
influence judgment used to select a high PE in Section 4A of a Stock Selection
Guide (SSG).

PEG is not a mathematical relationship (be very suspicious of any of these
rules of thumb which don't incorporate interest rates). It is often misused -
there is a VERY big difference in valuation between something expected to grow
15% next year and something that can grow 15% for the next 10 years.

When used right, PEG is a starting point for finding some interesting Peter
Lynch type stuff. It is also the starting point for finding some of the worst
investments you can make.

I no longer look at PEG per se - I tend to focus more on the relationship
between return on equity and price/book value. But that captures many of the
same names mas a PEG screen would.

re: PEG and re ratios. The poster who requested info regarding a definition of,
or how, a security is pegged to the Nikei, also wrongly got a response about
the "PEG" ratio. PEG is a ridiculous figure and an inappropriate metric for a
value investor. I think it's promulgated by the Fools, who themselves, imo, are
generally ridiculous -g-.

Note to Jim Clarke: Every once in a while there's a start of a discussion about
the importance of interest rates and a focus on "the relationship between ROE
and price/book value". I want to mention at this juncture that I agree with
you, but going further, I believe that there should be a way - and there is a
way (imo) - to link them. I've not seen any discussion of this linkage on the
Value thread. I myself do use an arithmetical ratio that combines in one number
a company's ROE, p/b, and a Cost of Capital factor. I then use this number to
provide a rough estimate of the "fair" value of a company. The purpose is to
provide a simple screening tool. It seems to work out well with established
companies where book value is important to profit generation (i.e manufacturing
companies vs. service/consulting companies.) Since I use the relationship as a
screening tool, my cost of capital is a multiple of the current interest rate.
Cost of capital varies from firm to firm of course, but it defeats the purpose
(screening) if such individual capital costs have to be calculated on a
stock-by-stock basis. Right now I just use about 8% or 9% or 10% (or all three
to get a range)depending on how I weight the importance of debt and/or book
value, both of which are easily seen on most internet stock databases. In this
way I can calculate, for any stock, a very rough range of estimates of "fair"
value (using Yahoo) and compare it to the current stock price - all in maybe 10
seconds.

I do something that's probably fairly similar in a screen, though I don't
incorporate a cost of capital factor - I guess perhaps because I think all
companies with the kind of balance sheets I am looking for have roughly the
same cost of capital at any given time. That cost of capital will vary as
interest rates move up or down, but that I incorporate in my second stage of
analysis. I am not going to go into what that screen is - I consider it
proprietary and although it is very simple in the end it took me three years to
get it to do what I wanted. Armed with this and my net-net screen, I can fish
both ends of the market - very good companies that are cheap and very bad
companies that are free. i.e. Buffett and Graham. These screens capture a
fraction of 1% of the stocks on the market, but I have little interest in the

Jim: more on screening ratio. Yes, seems to work on a number of these stocks.
Your CR for example. With an ROE by Yahoo about 23% and a book value of $10, I
can easily give you my screening opinion that this industrial manufacturer is
worth more than the current $19 price. And am able to confirm that with a
follow up to make sure the ROE in past years (18-21%) and book value figures
give the same conclusion.

There are two screening risks. The first risk is that we are wrong when we say
the stock is undervalued, i.e. selling at less than the calculated fair value.
We would likely catch this in doing further research before we make the buy. If
we have a number of these kinds of errors, we'll be doing excessive follow ups
on stocks we'll later discard (not buy) or perhaps actually buy for an
incorrect conclusion (namely that the stock is undervalued per the screen). The
other risk is that the screen says the stock is selling for more than fair
value, when in fact, the stock is actually undervalued. Here, to me the cost is
not so great. We wrongly believe the screen and go on to the next stock. All
we've done is incurred an opportunity cost. (Which yes, depending on what the
company was, could be very expensive- but not money out of pocket.)

As I say, I use this as a screening tool. There are some companies I find that
don't fit, but to me are good values anyway. TFX, another industrial
manufacturer, with a book value of $15 and a ROE of 15-17% is not worth $34 by
my formula even if it had a cost of capital of 8%. But given its great (imo)
past record and low relative pe, it's a bargain (to me) at $34. If I didn't
know about the company, I'd pass it right by. And some companies that do fit, I
pass on. I've passed on Crane for example, because I've already got a bunch of
these mid-cap, heartland industrial manufacturers, and I need a little time to
digest what I've been buying here.

the market disagrees with me - they are lumping it in with auto parts
manufacturers. Genuine Parts is NOT an auto parts manufacturer, though many
investors think it is. I'll throw this out to others too. Spend some time
evaluating the 75 year financial history on the back cover of GPC's annual

I myself do use an arithmetical ratio that combines in one number a company's
ROE, p/b, and a Cost of Capital factor.

Paul, Jim, others: Can you give me a back-of-the-envelope guess at what would
be a fair value for the following hypothetical (honest, it is!) company?

Let's say you have a traditional mid size industrial company (i.e. a proxy for
"traditional accounting is reasonably close to the truth") that has no debt and
makes 17% ROE (let's say it has made that it the past and will make that in the
future). Let's also say that they grow at or slightly above GNP growth rates.
Let's say that a fair cost of capital is 9%.

What is the company worth? (say, expressed as some multiple of book value)

(What I'm really trying to figure out with this question is how to value highly
profitable enterprises with moderate (perhaps I should say par) but reasonably
certain future prospects).

If I'm simplistic about it and see that the ROE is well in excess of the cost
of capital, I could say that any price is justified, since the company is
growing shareholder value at a rate of 8% in excess of its cost of capital. Pay
up, sit back, shut up, hold on, and let the magic of compounding catch up to
your entry price, and then power ahead.

However, though I could be easily convinced that it would be rational to pay a
premium to book value, I have not yet signed on to the "no price is too high"
school either.

(FWIW, "PEG" would say (assuming a 6% nominal annual growth rate) to pay a P/E
of 6, which IMHO is yet another data point on how out-to-lunch PEG is. Try
"PEG" on a long bond for something even more stupid - it says bonds are
worthless!).

Daniel,

One way to value your target would be to find "comprables," say five or six
that have similar characteristics. Dover would be one example, and maybe
grainger and GPC, there are many. See what the market is telling you. Compare
that to what your target is selling at. It may be in line but it also might not
be. Then start asking yourself why. Perhaps there is a reason ( check the
footnotes, etc.) Also, ask yourself, given the present level of interest rates,
why the comprables are trading where they are, and does THAT seem correct.
Getting the annual reports of comprables is also suggested. But I think this
exercise will give you a feel for valuations. Paying attention to transactions,
especially CASH, transactions, will help too.

a div. and add more if div. yield is higher than S&P div. yield. Etc. for more
"if"s.

Okay, maybe a top buy price is 3 x book or more depending on the "ifs".

Think maybe I'm being influenced a little though because I read Jim's post and
his figures. -g-

I know of no "traditional mid size industrial company" that fits your

I know of no "traditional mid size industrial company" that fits your
parameters.

Nor do I ;-) I really was telling the truth when I said it was hypothetical!
;-)

I have however seen various real companies that possess many of its attributes,
enough to make me think that I really ought to understand what a "perfect"
company "oughta" be worth.

Let's say I don't trust what the market is telling me for comparables (though I
appreciate the suggestion by twister to at least ask for Mr. Market's opinion).
Or if not trusting Mr. Market is too extreme a thought, let's say I would like
an independent sanity check. The point of this mental exercise (to me anyhow)
is to figure out how to make an absolute valuation judgement in the face of
certain facts/characteristics (high ROE, no debt, moderate but "assured"
growth).

Until and unless you or Jim reveal the inner workings of your models I won't be
able to understand "why" you value my hypothetical company at 2-3X book.
However I can understand that you *do* value it at that, so let me see if I
understand the implications of your thoughts.

James' "fair value" number of 2.8X book means buying the stock at a current P/E
of (2.8/17%) = 16.5. If the company grows its per share book value at 8% per
year over year above and beyond its cost of capital, then it will take
approximately 13.5 years for the today's book value to grow into today's
purchase price (charging them for cost of capital). Coincidentally (or not,
James?) that is the duration of the US long bond (13ish years), I think

James says it would be a "good deal" (i.e., show up on his screen) at 2.1X
book. It would take just under 10 years to grow into this rate.

Paul says fair value/highest buy price is at slightly under 2X book value. I'll
call this 1.8X -- this means Paul wants the company to "grow into" the purchase
price within 7.5 years.

Paul says that since this hypothetical company is perfectly wart-free in every
way, perhaps 3X book is the top buy price (let's call this the "Buffett
Limit"). That's about 14.5 years.

Does anyone else find these "grow-into" figures to be interesting to ponder?

This is the best sort of thinking I could come up with after reading about
2-stage "Buffett discount models" and becoming almost immediately disenchanted
with them (I.e., if we assume Coke grows at 15% per year forever then for an 8%
discount rate no price is too high -- since this is ridiculous let's assume 15%
growth for ten years and then 5% growth (conveniently close to but just under
the 8% discount rate) thereafter. That just seemed so artificial, contrived and
ad hoc, that it seemed to be an attempt to fit a result into a conclusion).
Also, I was shorting an overvalued low-ROE high P/B equity leveraging roll-up
type stock with no catalyst in sight, and I was trying to figure out under what
conditions they might actually grow into their stock market valuation, should
no catalyst appear.

On ROE, first and foremost we must recognize that any debt inflates ROE.
Returns on assets, capital, etc... are more conservative.

Further on ROE, is high ROE itself the goal? Not at all. A high ROE is only
worth something if it is sustainable, and only then as a marker that there
should be market power and hence pricing power in the business. What a high
return on equity/capital tells you is that there is an increased ability to
create something extra out of a given level of investment/assets, thanks to a
brand, moat, whathaveyou that allows either monopolist power when dealing with
customers or monopsonist power when dealing with suppliers. As an example,
WalMart's special attraction as an investment lies in its monopsonist rather
than monopolist features.

Whenever I see a high ROE that appears sustained, I need to identify the moat
before I get too comfortable. If the barrier isn't there, then that high ROE
should be a warning sign. The problem with the midwest industrials is that the
moat isn't readily identifiable. Hence, nearly by definition, a lot of their
super-high ROE's are cyclical, and we are near that peak. So there will be a
lot of favorable ROE vs. P/B comparisons as the stock price anticipates a
downside and the current earnings still represent the upside.

There's no two ways about it for me. Either a high ROE means something because
it is proven sustainable with an identifiable moat that gives it market power,
or a high ROE means something else. Only the former attracts my interest on the
long side, which is of course Buffettesque.

Finally, we have recently spoken here of costs of capital in the 8-10% range.
Well, if we are assuming that the high returns on equity are meaningful and
hence relatively unleveraged, then we should be assuming costs of capital quite
a bit higher, as equity is of course typically more expensive than debt.

Mike

"What I can't get a good analytical handle around is, how much of a premium

How do you define premium? With Buffett-like high and sustainable ROE
companies, I think looking upon it as a required and expected annualized
compounding return on investment above 20% is acceptable. On my ValueStocks.net
site, there's a Tools page that has a spreadsheet that does this calculation.
On a lot of the already-popular consumer stocks, you'd be surprised how many
come out with a ~10% annual expected return despite high ROE's because the
price is so high already - effectively, the market is pricing these stocks for
average performance. This aspect of the spreadsheet model tells me that it is

I am learning how "you know who" does that calculation in his head. My model is
about 30 cells on a spreadsheet with four inputs. The more times I plug
companies into that model the more I don't need the model. After a while, you
know what the answer is going to be.

It takes 30 seconds for me to value a certain type of company with one
critically important caveat, which takes all the laziness out of this game. The
calculation should be trivial to anybody who knows finance - the groundwork is
laid out clearly in the book "Buffetology".

But here's the caveat, which is the entire game:

- the company must be the type that fits the model, and there are very few that
do. It might take 30 hours - to really do it right it takes years of following
the company, which I usually don't have but "you know who" does - to understand
the company enough to have enough confidence in the integrity of those four
inputs to put your money on the table. And nine out of ten companies you would
follow for years and conclude that the DON'T fit the model.

Otherwise its garbage in, garbage out.

The value added is the research behind that trivial calculation, and that
homework is not at all trivial.

It sounds to me like if you can figure out which moat will weather the sands

poll and figuring out who will be earning above average rates of return on
equity 10 years from now and go on from there. If we get that part of it right
everything else falls into place. Having said that when I think of companies
that should retain an edge 10 years from now what comes to my mind are
companies like UPS and FEDEX. It is hard for me to imagine a new competitor to
them coming up. ALso they should continue to grow as well. Wallmart wold be
another. Any other candidates?

Mike, pricing some consumer stocks for a 10% expected annual return
might not be too dumb. A real non-cyclical, franchise stock could be expected
to maintain that ROE indefinitely -- that's the definition of one. Therefore,
to price it to give a return a few points over a bond yield makes some sense to
me.

It's not dumb. It's just fair. And I want more of a margin of safety than that.
If I'm buying something, I want it to still earn 15% annually for me if things
go to worst case. So that usually means above 20% in a reasonable case. As Coke
and Gilette have shown, things can go wrong even with the consumer
non-cyclicals.

Jim, October same store sales were pretty mediocre for EBSC. Does that change
your view at all of the stock, if the company being under obvious pressure to
deliver something is going nowhere? Since it is #1 on your net-net hit parade
and the price is heading back toward $6,
I thought I'd ask. If you assume that same store sales will be basically flat
indefinitely, my conservative scenario, what is the stock worth in your
opinion?

Some stuff about GPC:

http://www.bigcharts.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=gpc&sid=0&o_symb=gpc&fr
q=2&time=20

I've never liked GPC. Don't know why, but I consider GPC a bugaboo stock for
growth investors just as I do Genessee Beer for value investors. These seem to
be stocks everyone eventually stumbles across, everyone says looks like perfect
stocks for their category, but nobody ever reports that they've made any money
in them. (That's how it seems anyway- of course I realize plenty of people may
be doing just dandy with these investments- but they're companies that have
always looked attractive and for me, never seem to have delivered.)

Charles Allmon recommended GPC in his "Growth Stock Outlook" for years in the
late '60's, '70's and '80's, maybe even yet today. And the chart I've linked to
which shows how one share becomes more than 200 is terrific. That's what was.
But it's now now.

http://www.genpt.com/98_ann_rep_71years.htm

As I see it, GPC is not an industrial company. So the models we've just been
talking about probably won't work. The company is more a distributor. And by
the way I look at it, its fair value is closer to 13 than its current $26
price. But that can't be either, because the dividend -- now yielding about
4%-- would then be about 8%. (GPC would be way too cheap at $13)

Very important for me, I cannot comprehend how, if GPC is a distributor,

http://www.genpt.com/index.htm

they deliver the results they do (and pay the dividend they do). I see their
NAPA auto stores -- very dinky and dull compared to PBY. And PBY (Pep
Boys)itself is having much difficulty increasing overall sales - they are
closing stores, their stock is at stated book value. (aside to I2: PBY might be
a buy now. -g-) How can this very competitive business be so profitable for
GPC? GPC is in office products and furniture distribution (SP Richards)? Man,
with Staples, Office Max, Office Depot blanketing the country, not only do I
wonder how GPC can compete, but how can they possibly be reporting the results
they do report? Totally incomprehensible to me. And I'm not too thrilled that
they've increased ltd from almost nothing in '95 to $.7 Billion now. Yet ROE
seems to have stalled or decreased (19 to 17%?)

But there is still hope -g-. It's possible for me to take a "sausage" approach.
(I eat the things, just don't like thinking about how they are made).

http://www.genpt.com/investor.htm

If one relies on history (and I often do), then with 43 years of dividend
increases, and selling for a pe of 13 and a 4% dividend yield, this stock is a
buy now for long term, patient money. You are getting a stock selling for a
decent ROE, relatively low p/sales, and an excellent business history. This is
a stock to put in Mom's account(maybe).

GPC? I don't like thinking about it. Not one bit.

Your last sentence could have come out of Dr . Seuss. Speaking of stocks we do
not like. I cannot understand how people are willing to pay what they do for
General Electric. Which for the most part is a successful finance company ,
which manipulates earnings through its insurance units. A nice company but
35-40 times earnings?

For a company with a net-net valuation, I don't think "pretty mediocre" hurts
me. Of course if Walmart had come through with the same numbers the stock would
have been crushed.

Very thoughtful post. Genuine Parts is very difficult to explain, but you raise
the million dollar question. Recognizing the profitability and growth they have
achieved still leaves one wondering HOW they do it. It all starts with
cheapskate management. The next thing you have to recognize is that they don't
make their money competing with Pep Boys, although they are moving more and
more into that DIY retail market. Their franchise is a different market
(distributing to service stations, fleets). Autozone has been trying for five
years now to compete with NAPA in that business, and it just isn't working.

Picture this. There are something like 250,000 distinct auto parts on the road.
If I run a service station, I don't know which one the next car to enter my
shop is going to need. And I need it soon. A Pep Boys or Autozone might stock
30,000 SKUs. So I can't rely on them. NAPA has a nationwide hub-and-spoke
logistics and warehousing system, they are incredibly efficent operators, and
they have the experience to know how much of what to stock where. You really
want to compete with them?

The industrial parts and office products businesses are harder to understand
the profitability in because here there is no monopoly. They have direct
competitors in each and are not the biggest player. They are making twice the
profit margin of their competitors though, which tells me that here GPC has a
cost advantage.

Paul, I'd be interested in how you came up with $13 - or were you just pulling
my chain? The company earns about $2.

GPC@$13 Not sure I want to delve into a valuation method that doesn't work
here. Maybe a slightly better way is to look at psr/price. ODP is .4/12, PBY is
.3/12, OMX (no debt)is .15/5, GPC is .6/26. Roughly. Maybe by comparable value
GPC should go for $18-24. But imo, it's too superficial. I have to defer to
experts who will do comparables right.

The thing to fall back on is The Reason To Buy: Relatively high dividend that
consistently is increased on a stock with historically consistent growing
earnings and which now has a low pe and sells at a four year low. Whew.

Mike, ref. your post re REY and fwiw: I'm averaging down today in REY under
$18.

Record sales and earnings announced.

Still though the same plusses and minuses as we've discussed:

Sales are mostly now dependent on car dealers. That market is saturated. They
are branching out into health care info. systems.

They seem to be able to sustain a high ROE.

They are moving to e-commerce. There may be a kicker to the stock with the
Carpoint aspect of REY.

PE is 12 and stock is near a yearly low.

LauA: ref. your post re: GAI. Thanks for mentioning GAI here. Your post
provides excellent info which I failed to consider properly. Chinese companies,
Al Dunlop, and cash looking for a business are warts that do not engender
warmth, hope, or enthusiasm -g-

I calculate that at today's $4 3/8 price, GAI is selling less than 2/3 net
current assets.

I've taken a position, added it to my other net-nets, and will try to hold for
2 years or a 50% gain.

Holy cow, PHSY! Management found it an "irresistible" use of funds to
continue a large buyback program when the announcement was written in
the low forties. $31 to $59 in two weeks! I have got to be more attentive.

OT -- PHSY -- Holy cow is right.

I looked at PHSY again last week and declined due to the lawsuit threat. And
when then when newsweek featured "HMO HELL" on the cover this week I had no
regrets. Oh well...

I also passed on VECO a month ago. And I sold QCOM long ago. And other misses.
(But I did get TALX at 8 a couple of weeks ago.) But none of these are value

Office Depot and Pep Boys are not comparable to Genuine Parts. I don't know if
there is a comparable, but GPC is not a retailer. Maybe a Grainger. I didn't
use comps on this one because they are so much more profitable than their
competitors (like USTR). A competitor is not necessarily a comparable. For
example, I would never comp Nike against Reebok or Walmart against K-mart.

And for you guys looking at Pep Boys, there is reason for this valuation IMO.
AutoZone (and now NAPA)has been rolling over them, the market is oversaturated
and management is greedy and inept. The stock looked cheap at 20 too a couple
of years ago.

My experience is that if is on the cover of a news magazine go the other way.
Laser eye surgery was on the cover of TIME very recently,
and VISX hasn't seen a good day since. I think the theory is sound --
that by the time it catches the attention of the general press sufficiently to
rate a cover story, there is no one left to buy/sell
who hasn't already done so.

Here'a a pick...

Allmon type selection. Decently priced stock with great history.

1. Sales growth, 3 year 23%, 5 year 52%
2. EPS growth, 3 year 15%. Analysts expect 17% ongoing. But it's a zero sum
game, like most. Gotta take market share.
3. Operating margin 13%
4. ROE 20%
5. Debt - zero
6. Insider ownership 30%
7. Inventory turns - couple of days. :o)
8. P/E 15

Comparables --
1. PE 15 while the industry is 26. The company's 5 year high is 41, and the low
is 3.5 -- It is now at 5 year low PE!!!
2. P/Book 2.7 - industry 5
3. P/Cash Flow 11.6 - industry 19
4. Debt/Eq is zero - industry .62

Other
Stock price - 52 week range $40-$20, now at $23
($40 was ridiculous, $23 is quite decent!)

.......
What am I missing?

Grommit, Carrabba's Italian Grill is the hot new restaurant in our metropolitan
area. Has Outback hit on a new "theme" to replace the aging Outback model? Have
not ate there, but might try it this weekend to get a pulse on the buzz. From
the number of locations it looks as if they are still in the rollout phase of
this theme.
