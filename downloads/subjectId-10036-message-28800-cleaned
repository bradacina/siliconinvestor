Hi Kevyn - Many of the value investors here hold positions in shipping
companies as they typically traded with a low PE and paid good relative
dividends. Since the CRB index has traded much higher, the bulk shippers have
had a good run.
Check out this site http://investmenttools.com/futures/bdi_baltic_dry_index.htm
and look at the chart for the Baltic Exchange Dry Index (BDI)& CRB Index.

Jimmy Rogers is very bullish on commodities. He said everybody should be
invested in commodities including wheat, iron ore, coal, oil... because China's
growth is sustainable for a long long time to come.

As long as China's demand continues, I believe the bulk shippers should do
quite well and will generate huge free flow cash flows.

reading the WSJ over the weekend does not make me more optimistic about
financial stocks
per WSJ article, and index of AAA rated mortgages trades now at 79c on the
Dollar, down from 95c in August. if that is correct there is going to be a
tremendous amount of bloodletting for all participants.
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119396287130379934.html

Another datapoint: th Korean bank Woori wrote of 1/3 of the value of their
mortgage holdings (we do not know the rating of those). Now I am hearing that
Citi is holding 80B$ of those. that would mean that the 5B$ they wrote off so
far are only the beginning. i think they have to write off at least 20% of the
principle for high quality CDO's and more for others, which would mean 10-15B$

E*trade has 16B$ in mortgage papers AA or AAA rated. this would mean a writeoff
of at least 3B$ per above comps, which would remove ETFC entire tangible
equity. And this would not even address ETFC's home own equity loans and
mortgages which are certainly worth less as well.

Merril's attempt to remove commercial paper exposure from the books with help
of an hedge fund and a buy back provision is clearly balance sheet fraught. Are
all Enron lessons forgotten. Somebody should do time for this in my opinion.

Mortgage insurers: Wait for the credit downgrades. Once an insurance company
rating is below A they are toast (at least with long tail insurance like
mortgages) because who wants to do business with an insurer with junky credit
rating? They will have to raise capital in this case or they will go out of
business.

just read that lvs got hurt by abnormally low take from table bets this year.
not sure why that should have an impact on wynn per se. aruze down to $36.47 in
japan now. I may wait a couple of weeks to go hunting for bargains. I am
usually wrong but i somehow dont think that citibank deciding to take more
write downs even before a new ceo gets there can be very good for the market
next week. My guess is that there will be lots of people taking tax losses in
the financials sooner rather than later.
When do you usually take your losses for tax purposes? im thinking if its me i
take them in november and maybe buy them back in december, or even early
january. I seem to recall that oakmark had a huge position in washington
mutual. Once it was 18% of the portfolio. as of 9/30/07 it was down to 13%.
return on the portoflio is negative around -5% YTD, and I suspect that the $5.4
Billion of assets they had on hand at 9/30/07 will shrink by year end. OT im
surprised at how insular many americans are. I am in contact with a financial
guy in oklahoma who is pretty and a former bank examiner. He was totally
unaware that the canadian dollar was now higher than the US dollar and somewhat
mystified that that could possibly be the case. People going abroad are gonna

I've been selling more stocks for the tax losses in Oct. and recently. My
intent is to put myself in a position where I can buy back shares if I so
desire in this year, while still not running afoul of the 30-day wash-sale rule
for USA tax filers.

(I just prefer to sell and then buy back 31 days later, rather than double up
now and sell loser portion 31 days later. No reason. Just my preference.)
--------------------------------------------
That Citigroup is apparently writing off billions more in debt is a sign that
the worst may not even be reached yet for any of the companies involved. Looks
bad, real bad.

I'll call it an opportunity though to begin lagging into select financial
stocks. After all, there's nobody I see who is buying or admitting to buying or
advocating buying or suggesting buying any financials or anything related to
mortgage loans at current prices of the stocks. (Well, maybe pcyhuang or Marty
Whitman) That's too extreme - too one-sided - or so I am willing to bet anyway.
I have a few stocks in this sector, and I believe I can now increase commitment
to small positions already established, and/or I can begin to reenter others
for small amounts.

CFC could be bogged down in regulatory scrutiny for a long time.
Their ceo has sold around $400 million in stock over the years, and it sounds
to me that there was a lot of malfeasance in the way they conducted their
mortgage business. It seems to be the case that their salespeople were paid at
a different commision rate based upon the type of product sold, not just the
dollar amount sold. If this is the case some would argue that that needed to be
disclosed to consumers relying upon these salespeople to offer them the best

Re: Citi, snip from a Lehman Bros. report this morning: 

Investment Conclusion

C announced chairman/CEO Prince has retired. It named Rubin chairman and Sir
Win Bischoff as acting CEO. A search committee has been formed to find a new
CEO (we suspect it goes outside). C also announced a $8-$11B ($1.00-$1.40)
decline
since 9/30 in the fair value of its $55B in U.S. subprime
related direct exposures in its investment bank. It is also being reported the
SEC is investigating its SIV accounting.

On the positive front, Prince is leaving and it affirmed its dividend (yield
5.7%). It expects its capital ratios to return
to their targeted levels by the end of 2Q. This is sooner than our forecast
suggests implying either asset reductions or gains on the sale of businesses.

We put 4Q book value in the $24.75 area (down $0.75). With the shares pressured
of late, Prince gone and dividend affirmed, they could see some relief,
near-term. Still, we believe a
great deal of uncertainty still exists and it's hard to
argue for a sustained rally. 

I started a small position late last week, thinking I'd rather "date" C than
"marry" her at this point. There's lots of problems, yes, and more bad news is
surely going to come out. But I'm betting that most of the selling will be over
soon and that she will become more attractive over the next few months. Then
we'll kiss goodbye and I'll move on. ;>)

It's at a 52-week low. The herd is dropping C like a hot potato. It will be
telling if C drops below the support line from the lows of '98 and '02.

this is probably OT as it relates to this thread but maybe of interest to those
of us long/short financials. I just heard an interview with Benjamin Tal of
CIBC world markets. He impressed me as being a very sharp guy. He is saying
that we have just begun the defaults in the subprime area because we have only
seen the repricing of rates from 2005 in 2007. In 2008 we will see the
repricing of rates from 2006 and the default rates will soar. However this
might be already priced into the derivative markets which are projecting
default rates of 30% over the next 18 months. this level of projected defaults
is unheard of. So the question becomes is this level of defaults already priced
in the prices of financials? (My personal opinion is that they are not).

Mr. Tal anticipates that the fed will be easing rates at a .25 clip early next
year as the defaults rates increase.
(Either way i expect we are going to be seeing loan loss reserves go up
significantly over the next 12 months.)

emerging countries and markets. Two, LVS is focused on coupling gambling with
tremendous convention center operations. The combination of

about a year ago with their bond holdings and the note that they included in

"The recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected the liquidity of
our holdings in auction rate securities, as auctions have been unsuccessful,
but at the same time we continue to receive interest every 28 days. While our
investments are of high credit quality (AAA/Aaa), at this time we are uncertain
as to whether or when the liquidity issues relating to these investments will
worsen or improve. We do not believe that it is necessary at this time to
adjust the fair value of our portfolio of auction rate securities, but we have
decided to classify them as long-term marketable securities on our balance
sheet commencing in the third quarter of 2007. As of September 30, 2007, we

The average delinquency rate for subprime bonds sold from May 1999 through June
2006 is 19.3 percent as of yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Among the top 20 issuers that have more than $5 billion outstanding, Goldman's
GSAMP ranks ninth with 21.7 percent for delinquencies of 60 days or more,
foreclosures or real estate that has been taken away from borrowers.

Higher Delinquencies

That rate is higher than for JPMorgan, with 20.8, and Citigroup, with 19.9
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg through October. Goldman's
delinquency rate is lower than the 26.2 percent for bonds in Deutsche Bank AG's
ACE trust, as well as 25.1 percent for Barclays Capital's SABR and 23.8 percent
for Merrill Lynch's MLMI.

One of Goldman's bonds, GSAMP 2006-HE2 B2, is valued at 47 cents on the dollar,
to yield 14.5 percent, according to Merrill Lynch. The pool, which was sold
March 1, 2006, already has a delinquency rate of 16.4 percent. The bond was cut
five levels from investment-grade Baa2 to a junk rating of B1 on Oct. 11 by
Moody's Investors Service.

MNDO,

MNDO pays a nice dividend while you are waiting and has a solid cash hoard.

Auction rate preferred securities for the most part are relatively safe
investments that provide slightly higher yields than money market instruments.
The auction rate preferred market has firmed up from a couple months ago, so
unless the companies preferreds are backed by some terrible assets I wouldn't
worry too much.

The auction rate preferreds I know of are backed by closed-end fund assets and
are a legitimate AAA in my view versus say a sham AAA rating backed by subprime
paper. For example, a fund's NAV would have to go to 0 before the preferred
lose money, and before that happens the fund is forced to redeem the preferred
when the NAV starts dropping.

I haven't heard the call, yet, but looking forward to.

Best,

the expiration of the tax subsidies for synfuel and housing slowdown for their

of goodwill and intangible assets which push them into negative tangible asset
territory. On the bright side, the company continues to perform well and could
have possible positive news in their new areas. I hold a large position in HW

One thing that is difficult to judge is how much HWs business would be affected

i dont have much of an answer for you but my understanding briefly is that part
of the problem is that when they purchase a portfolio of problem loans, they
have to immediately take a loss reserve for the loans in default and severely
delinquent even though that has already been factored into the purchase
purchase price. there may be other issues as well. such as when they can record

resources and financials. And even if I wanted such concentration, I am not
sure Canada is the place to be. For natural resources it MIGHT be the place to
be, though the recent royalty tax increases are not very pro-business. Still
Canada has a LOT of natural resources and it is much more pro-business than
most other countries. For financials, I am not sure why I should want to be in
Canadian banks vs. any other country. Someone might tell me if I am wrong
there.

- Canadian manufacturing is mostly done for US market. With huge loonie
appreciation, this part of Canadian economy may be headed for rough times. Not
sure how this would affect other parts of the economy.

- Not sure how Canada will be affected by US recession. So far foreign markets
are heading much higher as US market stalls, but I am not sure that I buy the
decoupling of China/India/Canada/etc. from USA. IMHO quite a bit of all those
markets are based on healthy US economy, so the exuberance about their
companies with US stalling might be too cocky. (A friend suggested Brazil as
the market most decoupled from US, but EWZ has gone parabolic already, so I am
a bit afraid to invest in it now.)

So probably the way to go is to buy some kind of Canadian natural resource
index... if such trades in US market.

I would be interested in other thoughts about Canada. And Australia too. :)

Verifying Appraisal Values for Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac loans..

New York Probes Government Lenders
NY State Probe of Mortgage Conflicts Hits Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac
http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/apwire/c30fe3e6606dabfebb97d0a4e74
379d.htm
From the article:"...Our expanding investigation into the mortgage industry has
uncovered that Washington Mutual improperly pressured appraisers to provide
inflated values that best served the lender's interest," Cuomo said. "Knowing
this, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac cannot afford to continue buying Washington
Mutual mortgages unless they are sure these loans are based on reliable and
independent appraisals..."

---------------------------------------------------------------
I believe WM holds more of their loans as a "portfolio" lender, so this probe
may uncover several other banks that may be more exposed to this kind of
practice. By inflating the appraisal value, the lender obtains a higher loan
amount which is then sold to Fannie May and Freddie Mac transferring the
default risk. Banks guilty of this practice may have to purchase these loans
back and would be put on probation for selling future packaged loans.

Cuomo's Statement on Mortgage Probe (WM in the crosshairs)

November 7, 2007 12:53 p.m.

NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL CUOMO SENDS LETTERS OF NOTICE AND DEMAND TO FREDDIE
MAC AND FANNIE MAE

Issues Notice of Martin Act Subpoenas to Nation's Two Largest Mortgage
Financiers Expanding Industry-Wide Investigation

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Agree to Demand for Immediate Independent Examiner
to Review All Washington Mutual Appraisals

NEW YORK, NY (November 7, 2007) – Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo today
announced his office has sent Letters of Notice and Demand, providing notice of
the issuance of Martin Act subpoenas and a demand for an Independent Examiner,
to the nation's two largest financiers of home mortgages, Fannie Mae (NYSE:
FNM) and Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE). Cuomo also announced that Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac have agreed to the demand to retain an Independent Examiner,
subject to the Attorney General's approval, to conduct a total review of all
Washington Mutual (NYSE: WM) appraisals and mortgages purchased by the
companies.

The Martin Act subpoenas sent by Cuomo seek information on the mortgage loans
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased from banks, including Washington Mutual,
the nation's largest savings and loan. The subpoenas also seek information on
the due diligence practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and their valuations
of appraisals.

Today's announcement marks the latest expansion of Cuomo's industry-wide
investigation of mortgage fraud. Last week, Cuomo filed suit against First
American Corporation (NYSE: FAF), and its subsidiary eAppraiseIt, one of the
nation's largest real estate appraisal management companies, for colluding with
Washington Mutual to inflate the appraisal values of homes.

"In order to fulfill their duty to consumers and investors, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac must ensure that Washington Mutual's mortgages have not been
corrupted by inflated appraisals," said Attorney General Cuomo. "Our expanding
investigation into the mortgage industry has uncovered that Washington Mutual
improperly pressured appraisers to provide inflated values that best served the
lender's interest. Knowing this, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac cannot afford to
continue buying Washington Mutual mortgages unless they are sure these loans
are based on reliable and independent appraisals."

The subpoenas issued include requests for:

• Information about all of the mortgage loans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have
purchased from any bank, including Washington Mutual, and the mortgage-backed
securities associated with those loans;

• Information about due diligence practices of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac;

• Information about appraisals and valuations by the originating lenders;

• Policies and procedures related to valuing properties and appraisals.

Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association and Freddie Mac (Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation) are two of the largest financiers of home mortgages
in the country, and both purchase loans from Washington Mutual. Washington
Mutual is the third largest provider of loans to Fannie Mae, selling $24.7
billion in loans in 2007 alone. Washington Mutual is also the fourteenth
largest provider of loans to Freddie Mac, selling $7.8 billion in loans in
2007.

"The integrity of our mortgage system depends on independent appraisers," said
Cuomo. "Washington Mutual compromised the fairness of this system by illegally
pressuring appraisers to provide inflated values. Every company that buys loans
from Washington Mutual must be sure that the loans they purchased are not
corrupted by this systemic fraud."

The lawsuit filed last week details a scheme in numerous e-mails showing First
American and eAppraiseIT caved to pressure from Washington Mutual to use
appraisers who provided inflated appraisals on homes. E-mails also show that
executives at First American and eAppraiseIT knew their behavior was illegal,
but intentionally broke the law to secure future business with Washington
Mutual. Between April 2006 and October 2007, eAppraiseIT provided over 250,000
appraisals for Washington Mutual.

"I wish I could say I am shocked by the discoveries made by the Attorney
General and his staff. Sadly, what allegedly happened between First American
and Washington Mutual is not an isolated incident. Rather, it is symbolic of a
problem that has plagued the appraisal industry for years," said Terry Dunkin,
President of the Appraisal Institute. "As the allegations against First
American show, the mortgage industry's dirty secret has been that banks exert
tremendous pressure to extort appraisers."

Cuomo's office has been conducting a nine month investigation into the mortgage
industry, which has identified two key areas of concern: appraisals and
securitization. On Monday, November 5, Attorney General Cuomo traveled to
Washington, D.C. to endorse the Escrow, Appraisal, and Mortgage Servicing
Improvements Act (H.R. 3837), sponsored by Representative Paul E. Kanjorski
(D-PA). This bill will create new protections for consumers and investors and
prohibit the improper coercion of appraisers to meet target appraisals.

This investigation is under the direction Executive Deputy Attorney General for
Economic Justice Eric Corngold.

ADVNA, the interesting little credit card company went to hell in a hurry. I
did not own it after trading it around. today I decided to get back in. The way
I see it ADVNA is a binary play - it either works and should be a double or it
goes broke.

This is the situation as i see it:
Tangible book value 14.%$/share. last quarter ADVNA earned 0.5$/share
However, chargeoffs for their credit card portfolio went from 3% to 3.5%. This
is a significant increase, although 3.5% is still better than average inn the
credit card industry. ADVNA is a niche business as they only give out small
business credit cards.

Do they have problems to finance they receivables via securitization? I say no
- they last securitization (a few days ago) was at libor +0.5% for AAA rated
receivables. That is up from Libor +0.0X% securitizations from a year ago but
hardly sounds like a catastrophe. FWIW, DFS last securitization was only
slihgtly lower at prices at around Libor+0.35%. So I think they still should be
able to earn money from securitization besides the interest income of course.

So i think that ADVNA is unduly punished. There is no analyst covering it so I
am following my own logic here, which may be faulty since i am by no means a
financial wizard. A small bet anyways to reflect my lack of confidence in my
own arguments.

Insiders recently bought back some shares. i do not think it means much,
especially with financials since i often found that they often underestimate
the problems they have created themselves, but it does give me a little bit of
confidence that they see a bargain as well.

Total sales for the four weeks ended Nov 3 rose 17.3 percent to $116.4 million.

Initial reaction to holiday merchandise from its customers has been positive,

The company also raised its third-quarter earnings outlook to 46 cents to 47
cents a share, from its previous forecast of 43 cents to 45 cents a share.

"'If confirmed, the recoverable volumes of oil and gas will lift significantly
the quantity of existing oil in Brazilian basins, putting Brazil among the
countries with big reserves of oil and gas,' the company said in a statement."

One way or another Brazil is going to be attracting money. Money to build out
the field, money received from the oil. Where is this money going to go? Well,
imo, for starters, the banks. So the play now for speculating investors is to
the Brazilian banks. (Jmo of course)

So after your post I've started with a 1/4 position in BBD. It's already moved
up this year based on the growth and prospects for the Brazilian economy. Imo,
it can only get better given the PBR news.
