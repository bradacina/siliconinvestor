Dale - you have any opinion of UU. I haven't done much with overseas stuff.
This is for the part of my fixed income portfolio that I just leave alone for a
few years as opposed to the stuff I post about.

I'm just starting to do some DD on it and have limited knowledge of the local
political issues. I'm assuming that the slide in the dollar stops at some point
relatively soon and that we continue to have limited inflation and slowly
rising interest rates. I don't know how that comports with what is going on in
UK, but figure that it is probably close. UK does not have the trade and budge
balance problems that the US has.

Looking into two telecom cos- tickers CTL and MTA - both seem to have good
valuations but no apparent catalysts for appreciation. Scwab rates CTL "A".
Doing my DD at present.

Goldman on CTL:

CTL (IL/C): DISAPPOINTING `04 OUTLOOK PRODUCES LOWERED ESTIMATES January 30,
2004

CTL posted 4Q2003 results in line with our estimates. However, several
surprising negative factors for 2004 are expected to produce results materially
lower than our and consensus expectations. As a result, we are lowering our
forecasts and yesterday we downgraded CTL shares to In-Line/Cautious from
Outperform/Cautious. We have reduced our 2004 EPS forecast by $0.31 to $2.13,
due to: lower USF revenues (-$0.04), lower cost study adjustments (-$0.06),
higher taxes (-$0.05), lower intrastate toll revenues (-$0.07), slightly higher
access line erosion (-$0.02) and slightly lower LD subs and lower LD ARPU
(-$0.04) (the balance is due to others and rounding error). One of the key
reasons for our previous OP/C rating for CTL was an expectation of continued
solid operating performance throughout 2004, exceeding that of the Bells, which
now looks out of reach. Thus, despite the recent sharp share price decline we
don't see positive near-term catalysts that could make CTL shares outperform
the group in the near to medium term.

Schwab on MTA:

Matav Magyar Tavkozlesi( MTA )

mobile services, leased lines, data transmission services and corporate network

is a tip from Guy/Crossy with a better risk/reward ratio. The latest deal to
sell mineral rights for 45M$ (equivalent to TRGL's market cap) let's me believe

The Mechanisms of Market Inefficiency: An Introduction to the New Finance

LYNN A. STOUT
University of California, Los Angeles - School of Law

December 1, 2003

UCLA School of Law, Law & Econ. Research Paper No. 03-23

Abstract:
During the 1970s and early 1980s, the Efficient Capital Market Hypothesis
(ECMH) became one of the most widely-accepted and influential ideas in finance
economics. More recently, however, the idea of market efficiency has fallen
into disrepute as a result of market events and growing empirical evidence of
inefficiencies. This Article argues that the weaknesses of efficient market
theory are, and were, apparent from a careful inspection of its initial
premises, including the presumptions of homogeneous investor expectations,
effective arbitrage, and investor rationality. By the same token, a wide range
of market phenomena inconsistent with the ECHM can be explained using market
models that modify these three assumptions. In illustration, this Article
explores three important strands of today's finance literature: (1) the
expanding body of work on asset pricing when investors have heterogeneous
expectations; (2) recent theoretical and empirical scholarship on how and why
arbitrage may move certain types of publicly available information into price
more slowly and incompletely than earlier writings suggested; and (3) the
exploding literature in behavioral finance, which examines what happens to
prices when market participants do not all share rational expectations. Taken
together, these three bodies of work show signs of providing the essential
framework on which can be built a new and more powerful working model of
securities markets.

I bought MCK instead of ABC, although I might buy ABC if they hit my price.

MCK, ABC, and CAH have 93% of the business. I owned CAH several years ago and
rode it from the 30's to 60+. You are correct to say the organic growth rate is
13%. I am sure that you know the factors driving that. Demographics, new wave
of generics coming to market, Medicare prescription plan: all these make for
sailing with the wind.

You might try to pull up the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference where all three
companies made presentations. I bought MCK because I thought the comparisons
going forward would be easier, and I want to wait to see if another shoe drops
from the fallout of ABC losing the VA contract. I also checked the holdings of
Vanguard Health Care Fund. They own all three companies, but have more dollars
invested in McKesson.

All three companies strongly reiterated that they want margin expansion. With
future margin relief , increasing revenues and no foreign competition, I think
this a good place to stash cash, especially if the high fliers cool off and the
market becomes more defensive.

in between MCK and ABC. I prefer ABC because their earnings report was
"cleaner". GS really ripped MCK's earnings report apart and disputed the fact
that some of the charges were one time items and I tend to agree with them.
Overall MCK is grabbing market share, but there is not much left on the bottom
line from the incremental business. ABC is the low cost leader (2.4% operating
cost versus 2.8% for MCK).
Overall I believe that is a solid nicely growing business that can support 20x
P/E ratios once it's regarded more favorably by the investment community. I
plan on adding to ABC and buying back into MCK in the NT future.

Thanks for the info on the GS report. I will check it out.. MCK is not the
perfect investment. I don't like the high salaries paid to management, and the
quarterly report was very confusing. To be honest, ABC presents a clearer
business plan in their CCs. I suspect that ABC will have one time wrtie-offs
and charges with the unwinding of the VA account. Maybe I am being too
conservative, but I want to see where that goes.

That said, there are some interesting parts to MCK. Their IT side for hospitals
is a small, but growing business. I was very impressed with MCK's presentation
at the JP Morgan Health Care Conference. Check it out to see if it is still
offered online.

The CSCO report should bring back money to the more defensive stocks today.

A recent WaMu press release of nice recognition on the new retail layout
mentioned in my 11/2001 post. WM is one of only a handful of my stocks that are
up today.

FYI.

WaMu highlighted in special report on top 40 retail "stores," only financial
institution to be mentioned

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 28, 2004-- Washington Mutual's branch concept
was recently recognized by the Retail Industry Leaders Association as being one
of the Top 40 best retail "stores" in the world, and was the only financial
institution to make the ranking. The association is publishing a special report
that is expected to be released next month and which will highlight case
studies including one on Washington Mutual.

"Washington Mutual has transformed the banking experience with its signature
brand of retail banking," said Sandra Kennedy, president of the Retail Industry
Leaders Association (formerly named the International Mass Retail Association).
"Taking cues from top-notch retailers, Washington Mutual has created a retail
environment that is warm and inviting, and offers a high level of customer
service. As a result, its retail financial centers are places where people want
to go, rather than have to go."

Deanna Oppenheimer, president of the consumer group at Washington Mutual,
added, "This recognition from our peers in the retail industry confirms what
we've long recognized and what our customer research has indicated. Customers
like doing business in a comfortable setting with friendly, competent people,
and we designed our retail financial centers accordingly. While other banks in
recent years were directing customers out to their ATMs and out of the branch,
we were pioneering a new way to bring retail banking to the next level."

Dubbed internally as "Occasio," which is Latin for "favorable opportunity," the
signature brand of retail banking was first introduced by Washington Mutual in
April of 2000. Since then, the Seattle-based financial institution has
successfully opened or remodeled approximately 780 financial centers throughout
the United States, including the company's newest retail banking markets in
Chicago, New York, Las Vegas, Denver, Atlanta and Phoenix, with Tampa-St.
Petersburg, Fla. starting in 2004.

Kennedy noted that customer feedback indicates that Washington Mutual's
strategy is working, and customers have praised virtually every area and
function of the branch design - from the concierge who greets customers to the
teller "towers" which eliminate the higher counters and teller windows of
traditional branches. In addition, Internet access to wamu.com is available for
those who want to learn more about bank products independently. In many of the
retail financial centers, a "WaMu Kids" section features a play area with an
activity table, books, Gameboys and more.

"Washington Mutual has taken an industry that was once considered staid and has
successfully infused it with a customer-centric retail environment. It has
become the model for other financial institutions, as well as other retailers,"
added Kennedy.

Cendant beat estimates.

Cendant earnings rise in Q4 (4:45 PM ET) CHICAGO (CBS.MW) -- Cendant earned
$288 million, or 28 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, up from $247
million, or 24 cents, a year ago. The median estimate of analysts polled by
Thomson First Call was for the company to earn 27 cents per share. Revenue for
the New York-based travel and real estate services firm climbed to $4.4 billion
from $3.9 billion.

From PR:

The Company reiterated its projection of EPS from Continuing Operations for
full year 2004 of $1.55 - $1.62 and for first quarter 2004 of $0.27 - $0.28.
The Company also continues to forecast 2004 Net Cash Provided by Operating
Activities of approximately $5 billion and Free Cash Flow of more than $2
billion. These projections reflect continued strength in our residential real
estate franchise and brokerage businesses, cost savings from the integration of
Budget's car and truck rental operations, and modestly improving travel
activity, balanced by substantially lower mortgage refinancing volumes.

Cendant's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Henry R. Silverman,
stated: "During the full year 2003, we grew the revenue of our reportable
segments organically by 6%, produced record EPS, and exceeded our goals for
Free Cash Flow generation, corporate debt reduction and stock repurchases. We
generated $2.6 billion in Free Cash Flow and deployed that cash primarily to
reduce corporate debt, net of cash on the balance sheet, by $1.55 billion and
repurchase $644 million in common stock, net of proceeds from option exercises.
At the same time, we enhanced transparency by consolidating our significant
off-balance sheet affiliates, discontinued the reporting of adjusted earnings,
began to expense equity compensation, and implemented a variety of other
enhancements to corporate governance. Most importantly, we continued to invest
in our businesses to facilitate sustainable organic growth and competitive
advantages in the markets we serve.

"In 2004, we intend to continue to execute on the strategy laid out in 2003,
which should deliver 10% - 15% growth in EPS from Continuing Operations and in
excess of $2 billion of Free Cash Flow. We plan to deploy our Free Cash Flow
primarily to reduce corporate debt, repurchase common stock, invest in
strategic tuck-in acquisitions and, beginning in first quarter 2004, to pay our
first-ever cash dividend."

Its Web Traffic Gear Is Back In Fast Lane
Thursday February 5, 10:29 am ET
By Mike Angell

The lessons of the dot-com bubble aren't lost on F5 Networks Inc.
(NasdaqNM:FFIV - News)
The Seattle-based company makes hardware and software to speed Web traffic. Its
gear helped power Web pages for EToys.com and HomeGrocer.com, among other
firms.

Some of those businesses disappeared, and so did F5's profit.

So the company went into turnaround mode. It lowered costs for building and
selling its products and looked for new markets.

"It was difficult to get top-line growth," said F5 Chief Executive John McAdam.
"We spent the last two years cleaning up the business and . . . looking at cost
of product."

F5's hardware and software balances Web site traffic between different
computers. When too many people log on to one Web page, F5's switches put some
of that traffic onto other computers.

This was considered a hot market in 2000 - so hot that F5 found itself
competing against tech giants such as Cisco Systems Inc. and Nortel Networks
Corp.

F5 has still managed to gain market share. In the third quarter of 2003, it had
a 12.9% market share vs. 8.7% at the end of 2002, according to Synergy Research
Group.

Everyone hates Yellow (NasdaqNM:YELL - News) now that its merger with Roadway

Model turned short-term bullish 2/5/2004.
Covered all short positions, QQQ around 36.5, it was shorted at 38.2, not bad
for an index stock. Individual short positions did not do well, AWE did not
move, lost money on PCS and WWCA, made money on AMR and JNPR. Look like I
should stick to the index stock short (QQQ, IWM, SPY) since it is more
predictable. But the issue is QQQ moves slower than my long positions such as
ALVR and EONC. EONC really took a beating - that's the risk of those thinly
traded micro-cap stocks, I bought more around 3.1-3.2.

Also bought big position in ALVR around 11.8, expect ALVR bounce faster than
market.

Bought UTSI at 34.2-34.4, it is a low-cost China telecom equipment vendor. They
don't have the leading(bleeding) edge technology, but they have been able to

Spekulatius, yes my short-term model bullish/bearish signal changes pretty
quickly lately - maybe it is due to we are close to the top. My call on QQQ to
correct at least 5% was pretty accurate and I have covered the shorts. Waiting
the model to show a 10% correction signal maybe in the next couple months -
that would make a big difference if the model predict it correctly. I believe
the conservative ALVR management will deliver some real profit in the next
couple quarters, as they indicated in the earning release that they expect
about 40% revenue growth. Fund project is going fine and I will send you a

mea culpa,

JLMC was a very poor safe pick in retrospect, as it is a microcap and thinly
traded. Releasing a disappointing and uninformative earnings report, it is down
quite a bit, although i am still comfortable owning the business long-term.
However, I should have learned from previous experience --- if you don't know
why a stock is so cheap be careful before recommending it.

Some other recs ISRL, PARL, and KDUS seem to be doing ok (seems reasonable to
take some profits on ISRL and PARL), although the market as a whole is doing
well.

Spekulatius, did you get in to ALVR around 12 last week? That was the first 20%
correction in past 6 months while it zoomed from 5 to 15. I bought more trading
position on top of my large long-term holding picked up under $2 a year ago. I
recommended ALVR so many times on this thread since $1.86 when it became my
largest holding.

Today it is fast approaching the previous high of $15, once it break thru, 20
is in the sight. I still like it to be bought out by CSCO some day, since that
will remove a big uncertainty of its success (the risk of CSCO come in and
crash this new fast growing market), and I can take profit over the next 5-10
years to reduce the one time tax impact.

I bought more UTSI today at 34.7, it is a Forbes 25 Fastest Growing company 2
years in a row, and trading only at 20 P/E. If one thinks "growth" is part of a

I recently started a very small position in cigar butt FCP.

They're in the furniture business. That's risky. Because I, like several people
here who follow NTZ, suspect China is now THE player in all sectors of
furniture manufacturing.

Right now it even looks like an FCP plant in Mexico isn't competitive.

Another negative: FCP has expensive debt - a newly issued 12% convertible and a
15% interest rate on a "senior credit facility". The d/e ratio is a very high
3:1.

From what I can tell, in the past FCP's been a respected player in its niche
markets. I like FCP's low price to stated book, and its low p/sales. FCP is
trying to turn itself around it seems, and maybe - in the next 12-18 months -
they might be able to report some good news that will move the stock off
current lows. OTOH, the news could get progressively worse, and/or the stock

BEL: Q Revenues beat the consensus by almost 6% and are up nearly 17% according
to my quick calculation. Did US$.29 for the quarter, missed by US$.02, but were
up 16% Got hurt by weak dollar? Profit up 17%

Guidance of C$1.45 to $1.55 equates to about US$1.15 for next year, vs. US$.83
this year (would be an increase of 38%.)

Yearly revenue up 45%, profits up 54%, and earnings up 76% (US$.83 vs. US$.47)

I thought this was interesting: "Accounts receivable of $29,012,175 has
increased by $16,506,230 and reflects a high level of $19.0 million relating to
work completed for the Government of Canada as part of the negotiated payment
schedule on the Saglek Labrador project. This amount will be paid over the next
three quarters"

So we get about $1/share spread out over the next three quarters for work
already completed.

Also this: "Construction on the Belledune plant is progressing on schedule and
is more than 65% complete. Following successful source testing and an
operational permit, full production is anticipated by mid-year 2004."

Missed the first few minutes of the con call but heard they have $160mil(C) in
signed P.O.s and per some sensitive clients BEL was not allowed to talk about
some contracts.

Re: recent Bought Deal to raise cash when they earlier indicated they had the

Added a little more PERY to my small position.

They missed estimates:

"George Feldenkreis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commented: "While we
are pleased that we have been able to successfully integrate our recent
acquisition of Salant and that we will be reporting both a record 4th quarter
and fiscal year revenues and earnings, we are very disappointed that we were
unable to achieve our planned $2.50 diluted earnings per share."

Which won't stop them though from making another estimate:

"....Initiatives, along with a healthier retail environment, should allow us to
achieve an improved level of profitability for the coming fiscal year, we
believe it is prudent to reduce our previous guidance to approximately $600
million in total revenue and earnings per share in the range of approximately
$2.50 to $2.60 per fully diluted share."

Gee, as I write this, I'm not so sure about my decision now. Looks like even if
management makes these numbers, and if the historical p/e should rise to near
its upper area, the price (now about $22.23/sh would go to maybe $26-28/sh.
(Psr number would indicate a somewhat higher evaluation.) Positives are that
company is an aggressive acquirer, and Icahn is a major stockholder. Maybe
management's estimate will turn out to be on the conservative side this time.
(I would wish.)

Lot of iffs. And my record with these branded retailers isn't so great now
(c.f. TSIC).
I'm in now for more, so I'll stick for a bit, but as I write this, I sense that
PERY will not turn out to be a satisfactory investment in '04.

"Carl H. Lindner, AFG Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, "Our
shareholders' equity grew over 20% in 2003. The merger of our holding companies
during the fourth quarter improved financial leverage and simplified the
overall corporate structure. The sale of our remaining Infinity shares gave us
substantial cash, providing both liquidity at the holding company and growth
opportunities for our insurance operations. In addition, we have completed
several debt refinancing transactions, totaling over $300 million, with
proceeds being used primarily to retire higher coupon trust preferred
securities and bank lines of credit. We are optimistic about our ongoing
prospects for growth and profitability and remain comfortable with our 2004
core earnings guidance of $2.75 to $3.00 per share."

I don't trust Carl Lindner, and I don't trust that "core earnings" are what
investors will or should focus on. However, with the stock at about $17/sh.,
Mr. Lindner purchasing shares in the $15's, the bullish p.r., and a p/core

ISLE has some better numbers (p/e, psr) than other casino stocks I am

that explain this. I'm no expert in the sector.)

I have frequently found that "relative" investing is very, very dangerous. I
see in the current market environment that all the casino stocks I am familiar
with are up substantially from lows. It may be that the correct conclusion now
is that the casino stocks that are hitting new highs now are excessively
overvalued and that a stock like ISLE perhaps might be relatively attractive,
but it is overvalued and dangerous nonetheless.

Cendant announces dividend (1.2% yield) and possible buyback. Up nearly 4%
after hours.

NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Cendant Corp. (NYSE:CD - News), the travel,
lodging and real estate services company, on Wednesday declared its first
quarterly cash dividend, and said it may buy back an additional $750 million of
common stock.

New York-based Cendant, whose brands include Avis car rental, Century 21 real
estate and Days Inn hotels, said it will pay a 7 cents per share dividend on
March 16 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 23.

The payout corresponds to an annual 1.2 percent dividend yield based on current
share prices. Cendant had previously announced plans to pay its first dividend
this quarter.

Cendant said the increased stock repurchase authorization will allow it to
retire some convertible bonds.

On Feb. 4, Cendant said that to reduce debt, it plans on Friday to buy back
some zero-coupon senior convertible bonds that mature in 2021. It said if it
cannot do so because holders convert the bonds into stock, then it plans to use
cash to buy back up to 22 million common shares. Cendant said it bought back
$644 million of common stock in 2003.

Cendant said fourth-quarter profit rose more than 16 percent from a year
earlier to $288 million, or 28 cents per share, helped by strength in its

-FARO has not projected lower sales in 2004 and merely being profitable, but
substantial growth.

-FARO has projected that its market, of which it is the acknowledged leader,
may grow 10-fold within 10 years (from about $300M now).

-FARO has institutions buying the stock like crazy (a danger sign if the

KTEC notes from 1/29 CC and 10-Q. Highlights:

Two new products this quarter. The "KPI" inspection system for cigarette
packages is the first KTEC product in this area and was well received at
Barcleona show. Came out with the "ADR4C" upgrade kit for older defect removal
systems.

"Encouraged by tobacco orders, above expectations."

"Strong aftermarket business (upgrades and spares)"

Re: Mad Cow -- "Don't see impact in short term but hopeful for more
opportunities in future."

"Capex may be stronger than last year, particularly in Europe, Latin America,
and Asia. North America is more of a wild card. Impressed with the level of
projects in East Europe, particularly Poland. Level of quotes for optic systems
is encouraging."

"The Q backlog is approx. $1mil higher and makes me optimistic. Looking for
another strong Q for parts and service; together, we feel good about the short
term."

10-Q posted today. Highlights:

The Company reported net earnings of $505,000, or $0.10 per diluted share, for
the most recent quarter compared to net earnings of $221,000, or $0.04 per
diluted share, in the corresponding quarter last year.

The Company's results for the three-month period ending December 31, 2003 were
favorable compared to the corresponding quarter last year in both revenue and
net income. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 totaled $18.7
million, compared to $15.4 million recorded in the same quarter last year, and
net earnings for the quarter increased to $505,000 compared with net earnings
of $221,000 in the same period one year ago. Orders from international
customers during the first quarter were strong and totaled approximately 49% of
the total orders for the December 2003 quarter compared with 35% for the prior
year quarter.

The October through December period is typically when the Company's customers
in the food industry, particularly seasonal processors located in the northern
hemisphere, are between processing seasons and are planning for capital
projects for the upcoming year. New orders from these customers normally occur
during the Company's second and third fiscal quarters resulting in strong
shipments for those quarters. The Company's business in the first fiscal
quarter of 2004 reflected a seasonal pattern of lower net sales and orders
consistent with past years.

The Company's customer base is continuing to invest in capital equipment as it
has done for the last several quarters. The widely publicized shift in the food
industry away from french fries has not materially affected the Company's
business to date.

The balance sheet reflects growth in the Company's cash position, control over
credit and accounts receivable, emphasis on inventory management, and a further
reduction of debt. The Company is in compliance with all bank covenants. The
Company expects that cash flows from operations plus currently available
operating credit lines will be sufficient to fund the current year's cash
needs.

For the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Net sales increased 21.7%
to $18.7 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2003, up $3.3
million from $15.4 million recorded in the same quarter last year. The sales
mix for the first quarter contained fewer automated inspection systems, but
showed growth in process systems as well as stronger sales from the Company's
European location. Sales of tobacco sorters into Asia along with increased
parts and service business contributed to the quarter's sales growth.

The Company's backlog at the close of the December 31, 2003 quarter totaled
$19.5 million, a 4.9% increase from a backlog of $18.6 million at the same time
last year. Automated inspection systems represented 59% of the total backlog at

Charming teen quote of the week. This from my 15 year old "student" who bought
his first stock in October and whose parents paid me to teach him and his older
sister the basics of investing:

"P.S. thanks again. Another thing is I sold xxx which is a huge mistake in
buying it but that was way back when I didn’t know really what I was doing, but
now I know a lot more and Im continuing to learn."

I share it only because after nearly 20 years the market sometimes tells me I
don't know what I'm doing and I'm continuing to learn, too.

Yes, Madharry, I still have some SJR common from when it and the preferred were
discussed on Buffettology thread. I was willing to bet on the "undervaluedness"
of the company, but it's been difficult for me to figure the fair value of the
stock given its current price.

It seems to me I sold down the position too soon. Recently (2/'04) I've bought
back just a little. I don't like buying back in at higher prices, but in this
case, I suspect (guess) that the stock might still have legs.

--------
I see MLEA is the old Tokio Marine, and that Marty Whitman's firm still has a
large position. Seems like they've held the stock (and recommended it) forever.
The problem they seem to have had (imo, and just a guess), is that it's been
one of those Japanese companies that's really not managed for the benefit of
shareholders (i.e. the management reluctance to monetize assets). Stock's
performed well though this past year according to the chart I see.

I have a question about KTEC earnings.

Here is a clip from your previous report on this company:

<<<<The company did $1.15 last year and $.47 in 2002. KTEC does not give EPS
guidance, but Needham came out this week with a 2004 estimate of $1.40.
(Forward PE of 11.82) When I talked to the company they pointed out that they
have a goal to double their revenue in 5 years. Using that 15% growth rate for
EPS, I show a nice upside:
...............
...............
............... [elipsis indicate deleted content]

Last Q headline:

Key Technology Sales Rise 18% for FY2003 and 21% for Q4

Full Year Diluted EPS hits $1.15, Backlog up 33% >>>>

Here is the link to the full post:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=19695066

KTEC fiscal year ends in September. As you indicated in two places in this
post, their reported earnings in the year ended September 2003 was indeed $1.15
EPS. The Needham estimate of $1.40 for September 2004 was attractive to me and
represented significant earnings growth, especially in the context of the
company's projection of 15% going forward.

Now, in the post to which I am responding, you say:

<<<<Next year estimate raised .03 to $1.43 in last 7 days.>>>>

I take "next year" in that context to be the year ended September 2004, or,
actually, the current fiscal year.

However, the Yahoo! website to which you provided a link, under the tab
"Analyst Coverage: Analyst Estimates", now shows $1.21 Current year, $1.43 Next
year.

It would appear that Needham has, in fact, reduced their Sept. 2004 estimate
from $1.40 to $1.21, and now shows $1.43 for the fiscal year ended Sept. 2005.

That is a whole horse of a different color from the original projections.

Did Needham in fact reduce their expectations by that much, or was there
confusion about which year they were referring to?

J. Clarke, thanks for the alert on LENS. I'll check the proxy.

For other reasons, I'm already distrustful and suspicious of management as I've
looked over this company.

However, with the stock roughly at 2x cash and with no ltd and being a company
that's a quick responder in a business sector that's in flux, it's worth it to
me to take on a few shares to see if they can create and develop profitable
products for the market. In past, when they seemed like they might have been
able to do that, the stock has traded higher than currently. (OTOH, that was
then; times and the situation might be very different now.)

K, I completely agree with your student's statement - I made many mistakes too
and feel like learning all the time.

But the real challenge is what we learned from each instance. Sometimes I
thought I learned something from one mistake and that conclusion led to another
mistake, such as sold too early one time led to being too greedy to take profit
and that stock went back down and under. The individual stock situation and
market will never be the same.

I've seen this before, where different analyst organizations interpret fiscal
calendars differently. It can be confusing. The Needham forecast was from a
January 5 Briefing.com item, which now doesn't show any detail to verify. I was
referring to the Yahoo estimate page which shows a 3 cent increase for "next
year" to $1.43. The Fool's estimate page also gives $1.43 for "next year."
http://quotes.fool.com/custom/fool/html-estimates.asp?osymb=&osymbols=itg&symbo
s=ktec&currticker=KTEC

Yet, First Call shows a consensus of $1.43 for 2005.

For KTEC history, here's BW's earnings and revenue table going back to 1999:
http://research.businessweek.com/company_financials.asp?Button=Get+Report&Symbo
=ktec

So I was looking at KTEC growing earnings from .47 to 1.15 to an estimated
$1.21, then $1.43.

I think of it as one of the quirks of Wall Street, like some organizations use
"normalized" or "core" earnings and other do not.

Anyone else have any comments?

I said Next year estimate raised .03 to $1.43 in last 7 days which is found
here:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=KTEC

Needham is not attributed to this estimate, and 2 analysts are shown giving a
current year estimate. So to say I increased Needham's estimate is misleading.

The Yahoo link also shows EPS estimates for "current year" rising from $1.19
(about when I first posted) to $1.21 now, so anyone that would've checked that
would've seen it.

In my first post on KTEC, Jan. 15, I used the "next year's estimate" of $1.40
in my fair value calculation:

Company: KTEC
Date: 1/12/04
Next year's expected earnings: $1.40
Estimated EPS growth rate: 15
P/E maximum used for estimate: 15
Graham Fair Value: $44.35
Current Price: $16.55
$ difference: $27.80
Percent Growth to Fair Value: 167.9% 

In my last post I said the current Briefing.com link does not show any detail,
meaning it doesn't clarify whether Needham meant $1.40 for this year or next
year.

http://biz.yahoo.com/c/20040105/i.html?ktec

Yet my post does say 2004, which I had found in my analysis in early January
and can't find now. Perhaps the Needham announcement was misleading or I read
it wrong. I stand by my analysis, but if "2004" was incorrectly given in the
news item or interpreted to mean "next year" I apologize.

WM to open 250 new branches:

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 17, 2004--Washington Mutual (NYSE: WM, news),
America's leading retailer of financial services, announced plans to add 250
more financial center stores (branches) to its nationwide network of
approximately 1,800 in 2004.

Snips:

the company has opened more than 780 new stores in its long-standing markets,
such as Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles, while expanding into some of
America's largest cities such as New York, Chicago and Atlanta. Tampa-St.
Petersburg, Fla. will be the company's newest retail banking market in 2004.

WaMu's banking stores take a page from some of America's top retailers.
Specifically, the stores eliminate the high counters, button-down clerks and
impersonal service so often associated with the banking industry. Instead, a
Khaki-clad concierge greets customers and escorts them to the appropriate
service area. Gone are the teller windows, which instead are replaced with
teller "towers" that allow for easier transaction between the customers and
service representatives. Internet access to wamu.com is also available for
those who want to learn more about bank products independently. In many of the
retail financial centers, a "WaMu Kids" section features a play area with an
activity table, books, Gameboys and more.

"The end result is a retail model that represents a dramatic shift from
traditional bank branches in look, feel and service," said Amato. "We've
created a retail environment where people want to go, rather than have to go."

Am I right in reading that the reserve restatement and the tax benefit exceed

wouldn't be profitable now. Revenues are still declining on a year-to-year
basis, although it fluctuates Q-Q.

 The fourth quarter results include: (i) a $2.0 million reduction in unpaid
claim and claim settlement expenses resulting from favorable development of
reserves related to accidents occurring in 2002 and prior years; (ii) a $1.5

Sadly, its probably the worst site i have seen for a biotech company. It is
only one page and tells nothing about VIASTEM. they also have their email addy
bassackwards - it should read protide@protidepharma.com. Anyway - pathetic
website.

from the Yahoo Profile

Protide Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biotechnology company devoted to the
discovery, development and commercialization of technologies and processes in
clinical cell therapy and transfusion medicine, specifically in the areas of
cancer, genetic disorders, cell engineering and transplantation. The Company
provides products and contract services to companies and educational
institutions that are working in these areas. Through its subsidiary, Celox
Laboratories, Inc., Protide researches, develops, manufactures and markets cell
biology products that are used in the propagation of cells derived from
mammals, including humans and other species

PPMD is profiled on the Stem Cells and Cloning Club:
http://www.stemcellsclub.com/SCCC-homesite/Finance/finance-public-profiles-ppmd
html

Here is what they have to say:
The business of cell engineering and culturing is a small and young division of
the biotech industry, but is high in potential.

Although revenues have been slightly increasing, it is difficult to gauge
Protide Pharmaceuticals' future business potential as it is difficult to access
company information. It is a very small and highly risky company to invest in.

Independent analyst are available here:

You would think that if these analyst had anything positive to say it would be

It is my opinion that the company's home run potential lies in its patented
stem cell storage and transport media Viastem. Viastem is a bovine-sera (cow
blood)and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide - a widely used commercial solvent) free
storage media.

The reason you see so many posts on this thread about Mad Cow is to point out
the obvious danger of using mammalian blood products for the storage or
transport of precious biological substances - stem cells, bone marrow,
umbilical cords, etc.

In what i believe was the last press release the company issued:
http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m0EIN/2000_August_11/64061379/p1/article.jht
l

The following was stated:

the Company has received notice from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
that the clinical trial on ViaStem(TM) has been placed on clinical hold pending
further information. The Company intends to submit the additional requested
information to the FDA within the next several months.

It has been a few years since that press release and the doctor (Scott R.
Burger, M.D) who was leading the FDA work and the university that was involved
(University of Minnesota) are no longer part of the equation for PPMDs
completion its FDA submittal. The company is very tight-lipped about its future
plans, if any, to complete the work they have begun. It important also to note
the the FDA has no approved stem cell storage media.

With 4 million shares OS the market cap is about $1,000.000 at the current ask.
imo that market cap is very low relative to the potential that the company has
- particularly if they can get Viastem before the FDA and get it approved. Its
my opinion that the FDA should REQUIRE that stem cells and other biological
preperations be stored in medias that do not contain cow blood (bovine sera)
because of the potential risk of transmiting Mad Cow (otherwise known at BSE -
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ) If the FDA should ever happen to agree with
my opinion and PPMD's product was to receive their approval i might not look
like an idiot for accumulating this stock :)

I give up on EP. Exited the position today with my bruises and my long-term
losses after EP's announcement of sharp reductions in their reserves. (I WAS
warned here several times about the quality of the company.)

I've placed funds in HLSH - yet another company with iffy management or past
business practices that decent people consider appalling. With new management,
HLSH does seem to be making improvements. (And that may already be reflected in
the stock price.) Troubles for this company seem unending: there's a whiff now
of yet another scandal. OTOH, that Fidelity has upped its significant stake in
the company is a significant positive point for me.

Also I've added back a little to OXY today. Given that I believe I perceive new
positive changes, it's somewhat easier for me to rationalize buying back shares
at much higher prices from when I made my past sales. Uncomfortable though
nevertheless.
OXY, too, is a company whose management comes in for lots of criticism, esp.
the option-rich chairman, Ray Irani. OXY seem like they are showing some
improvements though- they say they've replaced 184% of their '03 oil and gas
production "at an average finding, development and acquisition cost of $4.27
per BOE"; they've recently raised the dividend (The now $1.10 div. was $1 for
years and years); and maybe there's hope now that their long-time Libyan

Steven:

I am interested in your thoughts on ANF. I am a long term holder and tend to
have mixed feelings about the company. I was hoping to sell covered calls
backed up by my holdings sometime soon if the share price trades at an
unreasonably high price. That hasn't happened for several years now, imo.

The company's clean balance sheet and large cash supply encourages me to keep
holding on. Despite the recession and other troubles the company has had good
earnings growth and sales growth. Management could be viewed as shareholder
friendly, although not completely so due to its stock option program. But
shares outstanding have reduced over the past several years through buybacks;
now the company is offering a $.50 dividend; and the company is a supurb net
cash generator and earns high returns on equity.

I listened to the conference call and it seems the company is slowing down its
store expansion and will be concentrating on generating higher store sales
through better marketing. I hope this is not a sign of concern if Jeffries can
no longer geographically expand the Abercrombie concept.

A further difficulty is visualizing what the company will be in five or ten
years, although I suppose there will always be a teen/college market and there
is no reason to believe Abercrombie will lose its advantage in marketing to
that segment although there is stiff competition and every gerneration of
teenagers brings new styles and fashion tastes. Seems a bit tricky to guage.
Abercrombie has proven capable though.

I would like to be in this stock at some point when the tailwinds are behind
it, a better economy, no marketing blunders, a better mens fashion trend. The
company seems to get hyped up quite a bit when its hitting on all cylinders.

Otherwise its a fairly consistent earner and posseses a good balance sheet and
seems to have somewhat of a marketing edge in its target market, perhaps
protecting the downside. The dividend might help out on that score too.

If you don't mind, could you let me know what you think is the downside and
whether you think the company is overpriced at this point and what caused you
to decide to sell.

Thanks.

GSM so far:

Negatives:
-shrinking market share (new market entrants)
-volatile Brazilian market
-potantial currency issues (Real devaluation)
- increased churn

I found the yahoo numbers to be somewhat off. TSU seems to me very profitable
wireless company with a very strong balance sheet. Their FCF is very strong
despite the outlays for the GSM upgrade and should be even stronger once the
major investments are done. I believe that TIM sooner or later will take over
the company, they control the majority of voting shares but only 23% of the
overall equity. Another Brazilian wireless company I like valuation wise is TND
but so far i only have a position in TSU.
