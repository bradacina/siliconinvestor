this is why they call them global capital markets and golobal markets in
general . if foreigner buy canadian stock they provide more access to capital
etc. dont kid yourself if they deny the trusts there will simply be more
leveraged buy outs all over the place. Makes more sense to raise the foreigner

the right thing to do and good to see that they had the nerve to actually do
it.. For canadians, they threw in income splitting in pension account so it is
not all negative.. And chances are they will reduce the capital gains some more
in next budget.. So for canadian investors this will gradually work out but no
question foreign investors are probably quite pissed.. and since there is a 4

From:Madharry
After converting to a trust in 2005, PWE was left holding more than 4 million
acres of this undeveloped land.

Although not a typical asset for a trust, this undeveloped land has huge
strategic value for Penn West. The company has been able to negotiate deals
with E&P firms to develop this land while taking little or no capital risk.
Specifically, Penn West allows E&P firms to explore and drill on this virgin
land in exchange for a royalty interest in any future production. These farm-in
partners take on all the expense of drilling, development, and production
processing. Meanwhile, PWE still gets a piece of any future oil and gas
revenues from this land. This is an excellent low-risk growth strategy.

In addition, PWE has a history of success with enhanced recovery techniques.
Enhanced recovery techniques include a process known as carbon dioxide (CO2)
flooding. Contrary to popular belief, oil in a reserve is not trapped in a
giant underground pool, but is instead held in tiny holes, cracks, and pores of
rock. Because oil is under pressure underground due to geologic forces, it will
flow easily to a newly spudded well. But over time, that geologic pressure
drops and production falls. When that happens, 60% to 70% of the total oil in
the field can be left trapped underground.

In CO2 flooding, a company pumps carbon dioxide gas through injection wells
into the edge of an oilfield. The gas is literally absorbed by the oil and
helps to re-pressurize the field. As anyone who has ever opened a can of shaken
Coca-Cola can attest, carbon dioxide bubbles will force the soda through the
top of the container, creating quite a mess. Similarly, carbon dioxide bubbles
in oil help push the oil up a well. PWE uses carbon dioxide flooding to push
more oil out of its existing wells. The result is both increased recovery and a
greatly enhanced reserve life.

For example, one of Penn West's key properties, the Weyburn field, currently
accounts for a large chunk of the firm's production. This field was discovered
in the 1950s and has already been peppered with 600 wells. But by using a
carbon dioxide flood to enhance recovery, PWE estimates that Weyburn will
deliver almost two decades of additional reserve life.

PWE also garners around 40% of its total production from mature light oil
fields in central Canada. Light oil is easier to refine than other forms of
crude and earns a premium price on the global market. Although these fields are
mature, PWE expects to garner steady production from the region using its
enhanced recovery techniques.

For the Value Investor, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of seeing
Sprott Asset Management take half the shares in this public company. Sprott is

CRYP. Madharry, I'm buying my few shares just on financial ratios I'm using to

Generally, I've found that when management moves headquarters, especially to a
new building complex, that turns out to be a negative for the stock.

Regarding "taking a position". For anybody who keeps a portfolio of 20-40
stocks, I'd say the person should not take a position (2-5%) in CRYP unless
they know more and do more than I'll glean and do with my looksee at CRYP. For

burning through cash for a while and may need more in '07, if they do it will
almost certainly dilute shareholders. Also, they are having a real problem with
second tier executives leaving for higher paying jobs.

I think this company is in a death spiral, but even if they manage to turn it
around, I think there will be plenty of time to get in at a good price once
they've demonstrated viability. To me this company is, at best, a crap shoot -

Bought some WLT -a conglomerate. Interests in Water infrastructure, Coal, some
gas and housing. The water infrastructure company (MWA) will be spun of to
existing shareholders and represents a good deal of WLT's market cap. MWA
appears to be doing fairly well. With 1.94 shares for each MWA shares that is
worth 27$ roughly. The valuation of the Stub (sans MWA) should be around 700M$.
For that WLT shareholder will own a profitable coal company (560M$ revenue
160M$ operating earnings) and a homebuilder that is in turnaround and mode 10M$
during the last quarter.

From the numbers above i conclude that WLT is substantially undervalued - the
coal business by itself is worth at least 1.0B$ so even if we discount the
homebuilding business totally the sum of parts is worth more than the current
market cap.

Why is the stock down? I believe Pirate Capital may have been a seller, due to

Stem Cell Stocks Rise as Democrat Wins Signal Support (Update1)

By John Lauerman

Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Advanced Cell Technology Inc., Geron Corp. and other stem
cell companies rallied as Democratic wins in the U.S. House of Representatives
and Senate raised hope for increased government funding for research.

Geron, based in Menlo Park, California, rose as much as 5 percent, and Alameda,
California-based Advanced Cell rose as much as 17 percent. Aastrom Biosciences
Inc., based in Ann Arbor, Michigan based rose as much as 11 percent.

President George W. Bush restricted funding for research on human embryonic
stem cells in 2001, saying he was against the destruction of human embryos.
Missouri voters countered by passing a constitutional amendment yesterday to
protect stem- cell research, and Democrats in other states campaigned against
the restrictions, pointing to stem cells' promise in treatments for diabetes,
Parkinson's disease, and other disorders.

``The key word is `cures,''' said William Caldwell, Advanced Cell's Chief
Executive Officer, in an e-mailed statement yesterday. ``That is the exciting
potential of this platform technology which heretofore has been a dream for
millions of people suffering with life-threatening afflictions.''

Aastrom shares rose 6 cents, or 4 percent, to $1.55 as of 10:44 a.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market composite trading. Geron shares rose 20 cents, or 2.4 percent, to
$8.58. Cytori Therapeutics Inc. shares gained 8 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$4.22. Advanced Cell's shares rose 7 cents, or 8.6 percent, to 88 cents in over
the counter trading.

Bush's Stance

Bush's stance on stem cells has been controversial since his 2001 announcement
of the restrictions. The Republican- controlled Senate voted 63 to 37 July 18
to overturn the Bush policy, which banned federal funding for research on
embryonic stem cell lines created before 2001.

Bush used the first veto of his administration to reject the legislation within
24 hours.

In Missouri, voters passed the stem cell amendment by a margin of 51 percent to
49 percent, with 98 percent of precincts counted, according to the Associated
Press. The legislation, also called the Missouri Stem Cell Research and Cures
Initiative, guarantees that any stem cell treatment and research allowed by the
U.S. government could occur in Missouri.

The amendment became an issue in the state's U.S. Senate race between Democrat
Claire McCaskill and Republican incumbent Jim Talent. Actor Michael J. Fox, who
suffers from Parkinson's Disease, appeared in a television commercial for
McCaskill, asking voters to support her because she favors the stem-cell
measure. McCaskill won.

$9 billion or so . they asked the guy in charge what happened to the money The

Comments:

Does Chapter 11 bankruptcy create zombie companies that live on, their bosses
able to run the businesses interest-free for years only to return with
manageable debts and a competitive advantage that drags hitherto healthier
rivals into their graves? Or does it offer otherwise sound companies a shot at
starting over?

Rather than shutting a firm because it cannot meet its obligations to
creditors, as happens in many other countries, Chapter 11 gives a firm
temporary protection from its creditors, as they work out if it has any value
left and who should have what stake, be it equity or debt, in the company that
eventually emerges from bankruptcy protection. It allows restructuring on three
main fronts. First, companies caught out by disaster or legal liabilities can
be forced to file for Chapter 11 out of desperation. But increasingly they can
work out a deal in advance, and use the bankruptcy courts tax and
creditor-voting advantages in some cases, approval is needed from only
two-thirds of the lenders to get the deal signed. Thirdly, Chapter 11s abundant
case law also encourages out-of-court restructurings by letting borrowers and
creditors know what to expect if they go to court. The reputation of Chapter 11
is not helped by the sight of lawyers, accountants and other restructuring
experts feeding off the carcass. But for salvaging ailing firms, the Chapter 11
model, with all its faults, is better than the alternatives.

Take $1.58 billion (market cap) Owens Corning (Ticker: OC), the Toledo,
OH-based building materials manufacturer whose insulation business fell foul of
virulent asbestos-related litigation that dragged the whole group into
bankruptcy. Last month it emerged from Chapter 11after creditors and
shareholders, including asbestos, bondholder and trade creditors as well as the
banks supported a plan under which OC segregated its asbestos liabilities in a
trust. The trust absorbs all past and future asbestos responsibility, clearing
the way for a clean reorganization of the company. In return, the trust
receives monies for asbestos claimants in the form of cash, stock, insurance
policies and profit-sharing plans. And OC receives a tax deduction on all
payments into the trust.

We are emerging from Chapter 11 in a strong operational and financial position,
said David Brown, CEO and President. During the past six years, we have
continued to grow our businesses around the world and have strengthened our
financial performance. We are pleased to be emerging as an investment-grade
company.

On Tuesday, Mr. Brown backed his optimism with his own money, spending over
$500,000 buying some 18,000 OC shares at $27.40 with Chairman and CFO Michael
Thaman doing the same. Clearly these key directors think OC has emerged from
bankruptcy refreshed and fit. Certainly its results for the first nine months
of 2006 suggest their right: sales were a record $4.984 billion compared with
$4.610 billion a year earlier, while after excluding items affecting
comparability, adjusted income from operations was $426 million against $395
million for the first nine months of last year.

Chapter 11 allowed OC to harness market forces to solve its asbestos litigation
mess. Lifting that cloud will now have huge benefits for OC. The stock, at
$28.50, is on a trailing p/e of just 2.35 (yes, 2.35). Insider Moves rates OC a
Strong Buy.

I bought more shares of HGYS, a candian fuel cell developer, who also provides
testing equipment for fuel cells, which was down 10% today on disappointing
revenues and projections. I listened to the conference call most of which was
incredibly boring until the Q&A period which I found facinating. I think its a
worthwhile speculation based on orders on hand, futuristic growth, market cap,
and cash in the bank. I thought it interesting that no one questioned whether
fuel cell industry might not get a lift from the recent political results. I

Both AAV and CNE have high dividends (like HTE). CNE has higher oil % than

of the trust uncertainty issue. I can easily see the chinese trying to buy

Below is an update and a reply to the post on stocks that I currently own

NPTH: I wasn't pleased with the latest 10-Q so I've sold 30% of my holdings
today.

CKSW: I continue to hold these shares but might take some profits when my long
term capital gains are established in December.

BEL: A major loss with my average price of 3.00. I continue to hold my shares
as I think their plant assets are worth more than the current enterprise value.

IMOS: I am still holding these shares and might buy more if the stock dips to
my average purchase price of 5.40. The company stated that they will cut back
on their capital expenditures, which should imprvoe margins.

FMD: I continue to hold my shares. A three for two split is planned and the
latest quarter was fabulous.

MEDX: Not a value stock, but I mentioned it in my previous post. The CEO has
resigned due to backdating of options and the stock has responded nicely. My
average price is in the low nines.

PTEN: Bought and sold for a small gain. I am more interested in some of the
Canroys mentioned on this board.

ISIS: I recently started a position in ISIS. It is not a value stock, but one
with great intellectual property. Yesterday's news was very encouraging.

IVGN: I recently have purchased this stock which is in the doghouse with Wall

Your picks too tough for me, gcrispin. Bwdik. I sold FMD at small loss when
they lost a customer, and that's just when the stock began to take off. I guess
because I didn't understand FMD business model, I had no faith.

I've held some IVGN for a couple of years. Just got tired of it, as it seems to
underperform even though media reports continue to be positive on the prospects
for their business. I closed my position recently. To me, it's not worth
holding given the high pe. That's high p/e in my opinion.

I'll continue to hold my shares of PTEN, although I'm not happy with it's
performance.

Syncrude and Paul,

Thanks for mentioning this stock HDL and the site valueinvestigator. I think
this is good for consideration as a contrarian investment and am glad the stock
was mentioned. I also appreciate the site mention and will bookmark it.

That being said, the company has had poor earnings the last two quarters, so I
don't view the dividend as necessarily positive, the reason being that it could
be attracting current investors that would dump if the dividend were cut due to
bad earnings.

Also, I'd take what valueinvestigator says with a grain salt on this one, since
they have recommended this dog the entire way down.

I bought some stock last year when it was cheap with a nice balance sheet and
then sold after a nice end-of-year run-up and an announcement that that they
would blow a bunch of money on an acquisition. For once in my life, I made a
good sale ...

Thanks for the response, Paul. Other than IVGN,I should have mentioned that the
one stock I am still buying is IMOS. Based on the numbers, I believe that it's
hard to argue that this stock isn't a value.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=IMOS

Of course, there are negatives with any stock selling at five times earnings
these days. IMOS has a complicated corporate structure and negative cash flow
due to high capital expenditures. There's a major holder who knocked down the
stock last summer and the company
has a dilutive convertible bond. Last but not least, it's also in a cyclical
business. But with long term contracts with its customers and the roll-out of
Vista, I believe this share price will see better days in 2007. Year over year,
revenues have continued to grow and I believe that trend will continue next
year. In the last CC, management stated that capital expenditures should
decrease, widening margins and increasing cash flow. On that news, the stock
sold off. Go figure. (And do your own DD)

I never have been able to figure out what I should do about OID. It's either
too expensive for me to subscribe to or else maybe I should look at it as it's
too expensive for me NOT to subscribe to and avail myself of the often terrific
interviews and stock suggestions.

Couple years back - the last time I looked at OID closely - the subject of the
issue was Japanese stocks - obscure ones where they only traded on Japanese
market. Not stocks I could/would be able to get info. on or buy at reasonable
commissions through my broker.

For people who aren't familiar with Outstanding Investor Digest, here's a link
to the current table of contents:

http://www.oid.com/public/html/excerpts/CenturyMgmt082006/CenturyMgmtExcerpt200

Nice interview with Arnold Van Den Berg. I liked reading how he approaches the
market and stocks. OTOH, there weren't any great insights - that I got anyway -
about his particular stock picks. KO, WMT, others have been discussed here; I
own some shares and am not likely to up position based on what I read in the
article. Back otoh though, it's comforting to see somebody of Mr. Van Den
Berg's stature recommending these stocks now.

OID is published only when the owner feels like it. Subscriptions are for
issues, not time periods. Looks like ten issues for $295. (That ten could be
over a couple/three/four years.)

Here's a link to the stocks mentioned in the current issue:

http://www.oid.com/public/html/OID0806companies.html

Again, for me,... conflicting. I've previously reviewed almost all the
companies on the list, and I either have established positions or passed on the
stocks. (Indian company Ranbaxy is new to me. And too obscure to me.) So unless
there were some compelling reason (not previously known to me) from the
interviewed person for buying any of his/her picks now, the value to me is in
the hand-holding of the stocks mentioned that I already have.

equiped to sell those regions, and also have better resources to withstand a
domestic slowdonw in spending. Anecdotally I think costs have skyrocketed in
the past year esepcially anything involving labor. Municipal taxes were up
