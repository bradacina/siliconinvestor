Looking at that list now because it's easier than the Bloomberg one.

I find nothing attractive on this list for a buy. (Of course. That's why I'm
just me, and he's great investor Jeffrey Gendell -g-)

I'm trimming NAV. He's a buyer now (?) or holder.
I'm considering reducing SGR. He's a buyer now(?) or holder.
I'm a holder of SUNW from the old old days. Why anybody would want to establish
a position now (or even hold it like I have -g-), I have no clue.

Almost all those stocks on the list are near highs. I can't understand why
they'd be value buys for somebody like Mr. Gendell now. Maybe with steel, an
industry in consolidation, it's expected that the fewer suppliers will have
better pricing control, profit margins. Still...my opinion is it's too late for
me for X.

Can't argue with success though, I guess, and Mr Gendell does have a successful
record apparently. For me, I can't see buying any of the stocks in that
Stockpickr listing.

I think the basic deal with Form 1116 for Foreign Tax Credit is you don't get
to take the full tax credit if your AGI after deductions is too small.

You get to deduct the <u>smaller</u> of:

1.) Your Foreign Tax paid;

2.) Foreign Income / AGI minus Deductions * IRS Tax before Tax Credit

Hi doug5y - RE: PEMBINA, PIF-UN

I have never bought a Canadian Trust and found this one to be quite
interesting. Here is a map of their pipeline operations and future projects
(http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=63581&p=irol-pipelines )

According to my brief review of their 2006 annual report, the trust
distributions are made up of both income and return of principle. You need to
account for the amount of principal return as it lowers your unit cost basis
thus affecting your long term capital gains. For US residents, the withholding
tax is 15 percent on trust income distributions. Their dividend is considered a
qualified dividend for US federal income tax purposes.

You avoid a lot of this extra accounting by holding the unit shares in a
non-taxable account like an IRA.

For your dividend unit trust distributions that are held in your IRA does
Canada withhold their 15% tax?

I am not sure what happens to the 15% amount that is withheld by Canada and if
you ever get that back. On some ADR's you can get a foreign tax credit.

http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=63581&p=irol-irhome#WhoWeAre

Based on their 2006 annual report the tanagable unit value is $13.28 Canadian
(assets/# of Trust Units). Enterprise value is $21.04 Canadian (Enterprise
Value/# of Trust Units). Based on Yahoo quotes, the PEMBINA PIPELINE INCOME FD
TR U (PIF-UN.TO) is priced at $15.83 Canadian.

Therefore, it appears that the units sell at 1.19 of their reported "actual"
asset valuation and at a 25% discount to their reported (non Gap) Enterprise
value.

In 2006 they distributed cash in the amount of $1.16/unit.

From their annual report:"...Of the total distribution of $1.165 per Trust Unit
declared in 2006, $0.8943 per Trust Unit, or 77 percent, is taxable “other
income” and $0.2707 per Trust Unit, or 23 percent, is non-taxable. For most
Unitholders, the non-taxable portion is considered a return of capital, which
will reduce the cost base of each Trust Unit. Pembina projects that these
proportions in 2007 will be approximately 90 percent of the total distribution
per Trust Unit being taxable “other income” and the remaining 10 percent as
nontaxable return of capital..."

Summary:

Therefore, for your $15.83 investment, you receive $0.8943 (less 15% Canadian
Tax $0.14) or $0.76 which equates to 4.8% plus $0.27 return of your capital.

Over the last five years the units have appreciated about 6% annualized.
Combined w/ the dividend that equates to a total return of 10% annualized.

When compared to the S&P over the last five years, these units have performed
slightly better.
http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=63581&p=irol-stockquotechart&contro
_javalowerindicator2=&control_javalowerindicator1=&control_javachartfunctions=&
ontrol_javaapplet=

The big impact on ones return would be the value of $US vs $Canadian dollar
which could reduce/increase depending on the strength of the U.S. dollar.
================================================

I guess if there was not all that extra accounting needed for calculating your
cost basis and the with holding by Canada of 15% on income distributed, these
units would be a good way to invest in the Canada pipeline industry.

I hold TRP (TransCanada Corp.) which pays a 3.5% dividend (no with holding by
Canada) and has appreciated at a 14% annualized rate over the last five years.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=trp

It's no real value at current prices but I sure would like to find other "pure
pipeline plays" like TRP.

The only one that comes close but pipelines are a very small component of their
business is COP. This new domestic pipeline was announced today
(http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070419/rockies_oil_pipeline.html?.v=2)
Three energy providers said Thursday the government has given regulatory
approval to begin work on a natural gas pipeline that would stretch from

PIF-un. "Over the last five years the units have appreciated about 6%
annualized. Combined w/ the dividend that equates to a total return of 10%
annualized."

I look at the current div AND the return of capital. That return of capital is
cash in my pocket. The annualized distribution (div. plus return of capital),
according to the Apr. 17 p.r. is $1.32C. Taking out the 15% Canadian
withholding, and the roughly 85% value of the dollar to the loonie, I can
expect (I hope) $.95 USA dollars for each share of PMBIF.pk I own. (And that's
if the distribution isn't increased sometime in future.) It would be a yield
----before USA taxes and before any USA credit/adjustment for the 15% Canadian
holding---- of .95/14.07 = .0675. And if the units continue to appreciate at
the 6% annualized rate you've calculated for past years EKS, that would give me
an overall pretax return of 6.75+6. = 12.75%. And if - IF - the distribution is
increased or the stock catches with investors (as company develops/opens new
pipelines and maybe does more business), the gains might even exceed
12.75%/annum.

12% likely not enough for bragging rights when people inevitably give their
overall yearly performance results, but it's a return on investment good enough
for me.
Jmo given my age/risk profile/talents/lifestyle/station in life/etc. etc.

EKS : RE PIF_UN Since I'm Canadian, and my ( tax free ) account is in Canada,
there is no 15% with holding tax. Foreign income from stocks in my taxable
account is taxed in the account. That tax is applicable to my stock income. The
exact details escape me at the moment.

Very nice summary of PIF, BTW.

I'm sorry now that I missed the TRP opportunity. I'm assuming you bought when
they reduce their dividend 5 years back or so.

After considering Paul's comments I may add to my position. PIF is a steady
performer. The one red flag is the current battle going on the Canadian Gov't
re changing the status of income trusts. I try not to think about it too much -

WNMLA used to generate some pretty nice profits from its trading portfolio, but
lately it has shown only losses...that may improve for Q4 of 2006 due to the
rebound of BXL, but all that does is make up for some of the losses in the
first three quarters

the mutual fund part of the business makes a few hundred thousand bucks a year

as such, you have a very low ROE on some cheap assets until some point when BXL
does something with their cash, and/or their trading portfolio starts to do

It is quite astonishing when you think about it. Using the formula from that
article yields a number less than 12 which is well under the 22 maximum as
follows.

Assume $4 billion US earnings in 2007 and 320 million ADR's we get a forward PE
of 8.16. They are steadily cancelling shares but I'll assume a static # to
allow for awards and incentives etc.

Looking at shareholder equity now of 23,374,000,000 US, it yields a $73 per ADR
Book value. Multiplying Price to book (1.397) by the forward PE of 8.16 yields
11.40, way under the 22 threshold. No wonder Buffet likes it after a 4 fold
run. With all of Asia as its main playground for growth, its likely a fantastic
investment at these seemingly lofty share prices.

I'm not getting the very low p/e number for PKX that the article states.

Additionally, I'm looking closer in "The Intelligent Investor" where I see the
22.5 as bogey. That number 22.5 looks to be calculated there by using p/e where
the "e" comes from averaging earnings over the past three years. And we see
this (the three-year averaged earnings) mentioned also and again by Validea.

At one point, Dr. Graham says in effect, don't pay more than 15 times earnings
and 1.5x b.v. (i.e. the 22.5 bogey) if you're a defensive investor. I am
inferring that he meant 15x those averaged earnings over the past three years.
Could it be stretched -maybe (?) - and interpreted as 15x current earnings (for
the "enterprising investor"?)? I don't know. I doubt though that Dr. Graham
would be using estimated or future earnings for p/e.

Still, this is not to say that PKX is not a value stock. It still could be
quite a value. And it still could fit the formula. (I didn't quickly find the
past three years' earnings history to check that.)

as merchant banking is pretty much what Smith does, so it seems like the

getting these valuable assets at good prices. Perhaps Ill be able to hold this

>>>"The problem in holding these trusts in an IRA is that the canadian
withholding of 15% is lost. So you lose 15% of the dividends to thin air. But
if held in a taxable account, that foreign tax withheld is a US tax credit."

For me, I've found that not to be true.<<<

I too have found this not to be true. I spent at least 60 hours this tax season
researching the unbelievably arcane regs relating to foreign tax credit claims
between US and Canada.

From my understanding, Paul is correct on several points he raised: you can
either claim the Canadian foreign tax as an expense or a credit. If an expense,
you claim it through a Schedule A deduction. Fairly easy, but you only get
cents on the dollar, depending on your tax bracket.

If you try to claim it as a foreign tax credit, God help you. For openers, I
have read that Turbotax will not handle it in most cases (above the threshold
of a "quick" form). Two other problems as I understand it: to claim the foreign
tax credit, you have to write it off against other foreign income, OF THE SAME
CATEGORY, of which there are something like six, such as "passive", "general
limitation", etc. Cross-border tax experts disagree on what types of income
fall into which category.

The other point, other than the Alternative Minimum Tax issue raised by
somebody else on the thread, is that the foreign tax credit, I believe (my eyes
had long since glazed over on the whole matter)the tax credit is also affected
by the ratio of your foreign income to world income.

I don't think it's my heart or gut. Simply said, for these stocks I haven't
found an acceptable exit strategy. I know what to do if company maintains an
acceptable ROE - keep until it is overvalued. I know what to do if a company
turns around and gets back to acceptable ROE - same thing: keep until it is
overvalued. I have not figured out what to do with companies that flounder for
3 years or so. First, I thought to give them unlimited time to recover.
However, some of them don't recover to previous glory at all and keeping them
long term leads nowhere. Then I decided to give them 3 years to turn around and
then sell no matter what. That's what I am doing now, but it seems that "no
matter what" means that the stocks start going up after I sold. ;)

I also want to encourage you to share your successes, even if others have lost
money on the stock. It's not gloating, it just shows the facts and possibly may
help others to learn - or to relook at the stock again.

Jurgis Bekepuris. It may indeed be a question of exit strategy. The sell
decision is never an easy one -- unless you're being bought out. And the
holding period is tough too.

If I recall correctly, Ben Graham said give it two years, then sell if no
improvement to stock price.

I'm going for three. I'd like to see some benefit to the stock price within
three years. Sometimes I'll go longer just because the position is so small.
(SUNW. Years and Years. A decade. Yikes.)

(How can somebody go three years with "dead money". Easy. The person must
develop the mindset that he/she is already a wealthy person, that he/she
doesn't have to be desperate to make a profit, that he/she can afford to wait
for the fruit of the investment.)

For companies undergoing business/cultural transformations, my reading
indicates that the timeframe can be five to seven years. That is awfully long
to be waiting and holding on to the company's stock! Usually we might expect to
see some fruits of the transformation within a few years, I hope. (like within
a couple/three years)

I have held stocks three/four years with nothing happening, and the very week I
sell, the stock makes a move. Times like that, I do believe that there must be
a lord of stocks who tweaks us poor humans.

I offer a couple of suggestions for deep value players:

1. Be diversified. It's easier to hold on that way (imo). Of course, otoh,
while the percentage gains may look great if something works out, the actual
dollar gains in a particular successful venture might not be awe inspiring if
one is very diversified. Still, imo, those gains do add to an increase in
portfolio value.

2. Do not, as is done on other value threads, set stop loss orders on value
stocks. Do not give yourself this excuse to get yourself out of a position once
you have determined a stock is a value buy.
Try to determine in advance whether you will average down on the stock if it
declines or if you will average up if it advances. As a rule, do not ever let
declining stock price (stop losses) overrule your judgement that got you to
purchase the stock in the first place. Especially if there's no news that
indicates changed circumstances.

3. Don't listen to me. It's possible I haven't a clue. -g-

Top Tech Takeover target

(James Altucher, founder and CEO of Stockpickr.com, author of the book, "Trade
Like Warren Buffett", and partner at Formula Capital)

UNTD mentioned in the article.

From the article:"...United Online (UNTD):

What!? A declining, old school, dial-up Internet service provider? Most people
don?t realize that United Online has quietly been building one of the largest
social networks around, Classmates.com. All of United?s profit growth comes
from Classmates.com. Also, United?s cash flows are immense. Let?s look at the
basic numbers: A $932 million market cap and $162 million cash in the bank with
no debt, giving it an enterprise value of $770 million. With operating earnings
of $154 million, United trades at just five times cash flows.

The situation reminds me of Ask Jeeves which was trading for seven times cash
flows right before Interactive Corp. (IACI) bought it for a 20% premium. The
Classmates.com asset is too huge to ignore with traffic doubling every year.
Consequently, United?s content and media division posted a 33% revenue increase
when compared to the year ago period in its most recent quarter. Additionally,
United pays out a 5.7% dividend, making it the highest yielding tech company
that I track...."

I guess after thinking a bit I should say that my exit strategy now is not
necessarily bad. I do sell if there is no business improvements after 3 years
of mediocre/bad results and possibly earlier if there is a reasonable risk of
bankruptcy. (BTW, this somewhat correlates to Marty Whitman's exit criteria
when there is capital or business impairment).

Yes, sometimes it's painful that the stock goes up immediately after selling,
but I realized that the same also happens on "valuation" sales, i.e. when I
sell a stock that has surpassed my fair value. I guess it's just
psychologically easier to see stock go up, when you had a gain than to see
stock gain when you lost or just treaded water.

So I guess I won't change my exit strategy. But I reserve the right to bitch on
this board when stocks go up after I sell. :)

Paul, what do you make of todays CBF news ?

Another REIT I own, for capital gains more than income, FUR, interestingly,
does more & more joint ventures. Their annual report says they intend to invest
with experienced real estate operators who have specialized skill sets in
particular markets which can provide the company with both compelling real
estate opportunities and the management expertise to maximize their value.
Accordingly, it is out intention to create more of these opportunities in the
near term"

The Chairman goes on to talk about the "frothy" investment environment and goes
on to say that such an environment is challenging for those that pursue an
"opportunistic investment strategy" such as FURs.

Im guessing FUR is a more aggressive operator while CBF may be more
conservative. Still, why the ousting of the president ?

CBRE Realty Finance Announces CEO Resignation And Confirms Earnings Guidance
Wednesday April 25, 4:32 pm ET

HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Board of Directors of CBRE Realty
Finance, Inc. (NYSE: CBF - News) today announced that Keith Gollenberg will
leave the positions of Chief Executive Officer and President and resign as a
Director effective immediately. Ray Wirta, Chairman, will assume the additional
responsibilities of Executive Chairman and interim CEO and President while the
Company recruits a permanent successor to Mr. Gollenberg.

"We want to thank Keith for his valuable contributions in helping to create and
launch the Company, and completing our initial pubic offering," Mr. Wirta said.
"However, the Board has decided that, at this time, the Company will benefit
from an infusion of new leadership to implement our business plan going
forward. Our key shareholder, CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE: CBG - News),
supports this decision. Our parting with Keith is amicable and we wish him well
in the future."

CBRE Realty Finance is undertaking a nationwide search for the new Chief
Executive Officer. Mr. Gollenberg has agreed to remain with the Company to
assist during the transition.

The Company also announced that for now it will no longer pursue equity real
estate investments through joint ventures, and will concentrate solely on the
fixed-income arena, where it continues to see attractive opportunities. The
existing equity real estate investments, which total $76 million, and represent
approximately 19% of the Company's equity are performing as expected. They will
continue to be managed in accordance with their original business plans,
subject to taking advantage of early opportunities to profitably exit them.

"We have confidence in our business model, and in our ability to build
shareholder value through a disciplined investment strategy, complemented by
our CBRE / Melody affiliation. These strengths provide a solid foundation on
which we can compete in our markets and produce results consistent with the
expectations we created at our IPO," Mr. Wirta said.

The Company reaffirms its expectation that it will generate AFFO per diluted
share and diluted GAAP earnings per share of between $1.10 and $1.20 and $0.86
and $0.96, respectively, for fiscal year 2007. The Company will announce its
first quarter 2007 financial results prior to open of the market on May 8,
2007.

I don't like the CBF news, a128. Company for some reason is changing direction
and with that, amicably apparently, the CEO is leaving. Which means a new ceo
and more stock option/salary expenses. Plus the cultural change that will
follow with a new boss.

Not to worry though. We can keep our investment here (imho). We've got the
roughly 6.5% div. yield and the relatively low (I am guessing) p/bk number.
That d/e number ain't so encouraging though. Back otoh, CBF is only a part of
our diversified portfolios (right?), so we're controlling some risk that way.
And you've got FUR, which might be a hedge or offset, because that company is
going in the direction just the opposite from that to be undertaken by CBF.

Besides the numbers, the key thing (imo) is that there are several apparent
value managers in this stock. (e.g. Dreman, Baron, Franklin, Wasatch) Unusual
to see that, especially so for a newly issued stock as CBF is.
In preparing my response to your post, I now spot that Wallace Weitz has a
position. And following up a hunch now I got when I bought the stock and I saw
a Douglas C. Eby who was buying "indirect buy" as an insider in March, I am now
going to surmise that that Douglas C. Eby is the same person who is partner
with Torray in the Torray funds (imo, a respected ltb&h growthie/value shop).
And a positive for me of course is that there's value player & patient investor
a128 who is in this stock as well.

I just hope at least one of you guys did some decent due diligence before you
bought and the rest of us were drawn into following along. -g-.

Summarizing my activity over the last year or so:
I still hold core positions in First Marblehead, Pepsi, Microsoft, ADP, First
American and Fidelity National, State Street, Ebay, Principal Financial and
McGraw Hill. They've done pretty well and I did trim some First Marblehead with
its big appreciation... my position is too big to add to based on the recent
JPMorgan proposed buy of Sallie Mae - unless FMD gets even cheaper. I sold
Diageo (bought in 2005 at $56) at $78 in December and just hold a stub.

The Travelocity I bought in 2006 in the low $20's got LBO'd recently at $32.75.
I bought some Expedia last year at an average cost of $15 which I hold at $24.

Although I believe the real estate bubble popping has yet to fully unfold, I
did go against the market and bought Ryland last year at $36 which I then sold
at $53. I also bought MDC Holding at an average cost of $48... I am selling
this and exchanging for "Building Materials Holding". This is a $17 stock that
is a supplier to the national homebuilders (who are consolidating the
industry). In 2006 they earned around $3.50 and in 2005 $4.50, so their
trailing ROA and ROE are great (but forward is just okay). Price-to-book is
.86. Forward PE is about 13. They grow by acquisition but without dilution,
using debt and cashflow. I just recently sold my remaining REIT stubs from
positions I started in 2001-3.

I closed my United Utilities position bought in 2003,4 in the high teens
selling last summer in the mid $20s.

I sold my remaining UST bought in 2/2006 at $38 at $57 in early 2007.

I still hold a small position in Pfizer but I have not added.

I have followed some name value managers into Washington Mutual and Wal-mart
over the last year. My cost is $43 and $47 respectively. These are big
positions but I don't consider them core.

I'm building a core position in Google (average cost $471). It smells like a
growing monopoly and it trades at 25x 2008 earnings.

I restarted a position in Valero at $50 in 1/2007 but I sold before the
earnings release this week at $70. I restarted a Conoco position at $71. In
December 2006 I started a bunch of Canroy positions (PWE, AAV, CNE, PEYUF,
VNGFF, PVX, HTE). Prices generally have appreciated and the dividend yields
were in the mid teens, but some of them cut their distributions this winter, so
I'm slowly getting out waiting for the 12 month capital gains period (except
for PEYUF which I will hold). I have a large position in Patterson UTI (average
cost $23) because I find the CEO credible and his thesis about the prospects
for contract drilling in the US credible. I bought and hold a small position in
Crossy pick Connacher, an oil sands company, at $2.97.

o I got hammered on Planetout (down 60% on a big position). I still have a

capital gains period.
o I got hammered on Cryptologic and sold when the US took acts to bar online
gaming last year. The stock has recovered but not to my benefit, because I'm
out.
o I sold Estee Lauder bought at $30 at $41.
o I sold FTD at $18 (bought at $11)

In the last month ...
I added to a small Bank of New York position (bought 9/2004 at $30) at around
$41. This is a GARP investment where I'm paying 16x next years earnings. It's
going through a merger-of-equals with Mellon, a process that frequently leads
to disappointments. In the long run, I like the merger so I'm looking to
increase my position on pullbacks.

I started a position in Digital River at $57. The 2008 PE is 21, so it's quite
expensive. There is $300 million of net cash on the balance sheet to soften the
nosebleed. The company provides electronic sales & distribution services to
software companies. I don't know the company well but I am ASSUMING (a) its
position vis-a-vis competitors is very strong and (b) that the switching costs
for customers are very high and thus (c) it can grow earnings in the mid teen
percentages for a long time. I have not looked at its earnings report from
today.

I started a position in Asta Funding at $40. The company collects consumer debt
that it buys, e.g., from credit card companies. ROA and ROE per yahoo are 17
and 27% respectively. I've been watching since the high $20s and decided to
nibble. I do not know whether the company would decline or prosper if the
consumer debt bubble bursts. The 2008 PE is around 11, and it has grown
earnings at 25% annually over the last five years.

I started a position in Amazon at $42. At this level it was trading at 1.6x
sales which I thought to low for a company growing sales as fast as Amazon.
Then in its earnings release the company reported an upturn in margins and I
just sold now at $62.74.

I started a position at $14 in Ituran Location and Control, an Israeli company.
It's earning around $1 but it's got a lot of cash on the balance sheet. ROA is
high teens and ROE is high twenties.

I started a position in ACA Holdings (credit to Crossy). Third Avenue has 12%
of the outstanding stock. This IPO'd late last year. It's a specialty finance
company that if you accept management's calculation of economic book value is
trading at .67 times book. It's growing at a double digit percentage. It's a
$15 stock which-- if you accept management's estimate of economic earnings--
has a single-digit PE.

A similar company I bought earlier at $10.65 (now $12) is Primus Guaranty.
Again if you accept this management's presentation of the economics, it's
trading at 9x earnings, 1.4x book, and is also growing at double digit
percentages. The company has a "AAA" rated sub.

Brendan W: Thanks for sharing those trades and ideas. There are some good
possibilities within your list.

I'm in several of the ones you've mentioned you're holding, so I certainly am
rooting with you for them. I'll look at your new mentions here to see if any
might fit my requirements.

Regarding the Canroys (in which we both hold some of the same companies), you
said, "I'm slowly getting out waiting for the 12 month capital gains period
(except for PEYUF which I will hold)". I don't know PEYUF. Is there any
particular reason why you'd be wanting to hold on to that one instead of
selling it like the others? Can I assume it's not dividend yield related?
Because I calculate the current annualized dividend yield (annualized current
monthly amount --- after deducting 15% Canadian withholding and about 15%
Canadian/USA dollar difference) to be about 7.3% based on today's PEYUF stock
price. That's good, but not superior to some of the Canroys you are intending
to exit.

Appreciate the Yahoo links. Makes looking into the stocks a little easier.

Thanks, and congratulations on your good investment gains.

OT I am re-reading " you can be a stock market genius" for the third time now,
and he is basically saying that if you own about 8 stocks you will have have
pretty much the same volatility as the market as a whole (-10% to +31%) 2 out
of 3 years vs. (-8% to +28%) for 2 out of 3 years but presumably because they
are your best ideas your average returns will be much better. Has anyone here
actually tested this out? If not would you be interested in putting out your 8
best ideas, tracking them for the next 12 months or until you decide to close
out the position and the comparing how those 8 stocks did to your portfolio as
a whole?
As an offshoot to this idea I am now considering as a strategy having 60% of my
portfolio in 8 best ideas, 15% in spinoffs, 15% in real estate, and 10% in

Hi Paul - How does PEYUF compare to Pembina Pipeline, PMBIF.pk? I have a hard
time digesting the details in the reports to compare relative performance (past
& present). It seems that the net asset value can change depending on (1) what
your payout is (2) how fast you add to your reserves and (3)the price of the
commodity over time and currency exchange rate.

Each management may have a different philosophy on their annual payouts. One
group may manage to optimize their long term return for the unit holder while
another may have a much shorter term perspective but a lot higher payout. They
may not be in business in the long term since they have not added new reserves
to match their high payout.

I guess the best way to invest in these Trusts are to hold a basket of them and
hope that your net ROI averages out w/ all the different payouts. Based on the
last few years, these natural gas Trusts have done quite well.

EKS, yes pretty difficult to weigh one Canroy against another unless a person
studies their different strategies, location differences, capital base,
acquisition policy, dividend policies, etc. That'd be a swot analysis.
(strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats). Too tough for me.

I have bought a package of Canroys. I'd consider adding PEYUF, although I'm
already in natural gas with some other Canroys. I like PMBIF because it's a
pipeline/storage/transport operator and not an e&p type Canroy like the others
I have. It's got the dividend, long-term commitments, new pipelines opening up,
and it's not a limited partnership like a lot of USA pipeline companies. (I
don't like limited partnership K-1 forms for taxes (USA).) Imo, okay to include
PMBIF if one is buying a diverse basket of Canroys.

It'd be one of my eight favorites (see Madharry post), if I had any favorites.
In general my latest purchases are my favorites (or else I wouldn't be buying
them). Of course, since PMBIF is a pipeline operator essentially, with PMBIF
I'm looking more for stability with this one and not quick gains or multibagger
performance.

FWIW Claymore offers a unit investment trust which has positions in a basket in
the Canroy sector. This has a high commission (as do most UITs). I believe one
can also purchase a closed end Claymore Canroy basket, which trades on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The closed end would, more than likely, cost less in
commission dollars.

Very little of what I read about this study makes any sense to me. Like is the
difference between an IQ 0f 105 vs. 110 even that consistent to be significant?

105 vs 110 - No I'm sure its not significant.

OTOH while IQ is associated with people doing well in school and getting
educations which lead to good incomes, achieving wealth may involve more
personality and character issues which aren't related to IQ.

Just thought it was interesting. I posted it here just to pick an investing
site and this is one I skim regularly.

Closed my exploratory position in MLI ("Mueller Industries, Inc. engages in the
manufacture and sale of copper, brass, plastic, and aluminum products.") today
at a loss.
(in 12/06 @ 34.64; out @ 32.72). I do feel just a tad better though now that I
know that loss might confirm my possible high IQ. -g-

Got scared with the big pop today in newspaper publisher Sun-Times Media, and
closed position today. (in 10/06 @ 6.07-6.04 & 11/06 @ 5.00; out @6.38.)
Made some sales in Alcoa today (in 1/07 29-31; out @36).

Just lucky with these last two. Does not confirm my occupancy in the low IQ
category...I hope.

I guess, I may have bought your CRYP shares. Bought them near the bottom,

Hi Jurgis - I continue to hold my 2/3 position in BMY but am still disappointed
in the progress management has made in the last 18 months. Perhaps they are
slowly turning things around especially with their recent announcement with
Pfizer.

I am over weighted with shares of PFE with an average price around current
levels. PFE pays a higher dividend at 4.5% than BMY which is now at 3.8%. PFE
has a historically low PE of 10 as the market has discounted the price because
of their limited drug pipe line looking forward.

Every portfolio should have some exposure to the drug sector. I also own JNJ
and have LLY on my watch list.

Here is an interesting chart. I have plotted the five year performance of BMY
vs the S&P (^GSPC), Drug Index (^RSX), and the Integrated Oil Index (^OIX).
http://finance.yahoo.com/charts#chart8:symbol=
^rxs;range=5y;compare=^gspc+^oix+bmy;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=
n;logscale=on;source=undefined
Even with the recent run higher, BMY has underperformed all indexes. The drug
sector in general has underperformed the S&P and the big winner has been the
Integrated Oils.

Lucky for my portfolio, I am also over weighted with Integrated Oils which has
helped me off set my non performing stocks.

Maybe the drug sector will get hot again and these low PE's will revert to
their historical mean PE somewhere in the low 30's.

I had the order entered to sell my CRYP today also. But I cancelled it and went
back to kicking myself for not doubling up in the low 20s when I told my friend
that CRYP has the best chance of doubling of all the stocks I hold. I recently
read someone's outrageous suggestion that the internet gambling market could
grow 20 % a year for the next 20 years. I don't put any stock in that specific
guess but the potential market growth is huge. Can CRYP continue to get their
piece of that growth? I'll try to hang on to find out.

EKS,

I also hold BSX, GSK, JNJ and UTMD in medical area (plus a bit of ISRG, but
that's definitely not a value play). I am not sure about drug sector's future
though. It might be that the future is mostly generics with very few patented
drugs in the middle that mostly come from gamble-money biotechs.

I have a lot of oil/gas stuff (APA, CHK, DVN, HTE, HW, IGE, TOT, XEC) and I
believe that we will continue to see high prices and OK profits for some time.
