Buffett Railroad Beats Coal Slump With 75% Gain in Oil: Freight
http://goo.gl/OcfKj

<blockquote>BNSF, Union Pacific and their peers are hauling in energy
producers' gear to extract crude oil and gas from shale, then shipping out
petroleum products. BNSF's petroleum carloads rose 75 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier while Union Pacific saw a 12 percent gain in the
unit where it groups fracking-related freight.</blockquote><blockquote> "This
is a whole industry that just sprung up on all the rail properties," Jeffrey
Kauffman, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., said in a telephone
interview. "It's a new growth source that helps to mitigate what's probably a
temporary dislocation of an old energy source." </blockquote>

GLW - numbers are good but outlook is still cloudy.

<blockquote>If you do a little bit of research on this thread and the other
value investment thread, a lot of arguments have been posted why GLW is a stand
out value Buy.</blockquote> In all fairness, I have provided arguments on the
contrary. Here's one.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27794589&srchtxt=LG

Looking at GLW now yes, management has done a wonderful job of increasing book
value. And the balance sheet looks fabulous. But, I have questioned
management's decision to ignore LG as a competitor in Korea and looking at it
now, there's no clear explanation as to why they are building a new plant in
China other than to accomodate their partner's interest.

GLW has different divisions. Specialty chemicals, enviromental, LCD and life
sciences. I just read their press conference including the q and a and there's
not a single catalyst other than hope that demand will pick up for any of their
products from any of their divisions.

GLW announced a buyback plan and increased their div. I would be a buyer if I
saw a catalyst that would indicate more demand other than to just call it a
cyclical play.

Hi Sergio -

I do not know how long you hold your stocks and for me, GLW is one I have held
a long time (just over 10 years). It's not one I have owned the longest, BHP
and CVX I have owned since the 90's and I even have some that I bought in the
80's (like AT&T).

The one thing I have noticed w/ GLW is their continued innovation of products
(similar to what Agilent did at HP or Lucent did for T). You may be too young
to remember the "old" HP or the "old" T (before they bought Comcast and before
they were the Bell companies broken up). Each of these companies had R&D
divisions that developed the transistor and the original semiconductor, Lucent
in NJ and HP in Silicon Valley.

I was originally attracted to GLW after the huge run up in 2000 when they were
developing some very unique fiber optic products. The company was run up in
value to over $100.00/share because of their new fiber optic "glass" cable that
was bendable.

So, I really do not look to GLW to move based on a "catalyst" but rather to
develop something new and innovative in one of their several R&D departments.
The company has proven that they can bring the product to market and ramp up
production to meet demand. During the 10 years I have owned them, LCD displays,
environmental diesel filters, Gorilla Glass and bendable fiber optic cable w/
back end digital optic amplifiers have been developed, factories built and
world markets served all accomplished out FCF and current earnings (little to
no LT debt used). To me, that's incredible and they continue to innovate YOY.

I have no idea where their next $1B product will be developed (probably in
their Life Science Division) but it will and it will be very profitable. There
is no catalyst that I see or follow but there are great minds at their R&D
divisions thinking out of the box for that next big product. That's what I am
buying into when I buy GLW. I suspect Paul Senior see the same thing. He was
very successful (and an early investor) with his IBM purchase. IBM is the
leader in building their patent library and probably has the best R&D division
in the world.

Is that value investing? In a small way it is to me because many companies
focus on the short term. It's the GLW's that create the "disruptive"
technologies like IBM and the "old" HP's and "old" T's. You will no longer get
this at HP (or even Agilent) and who knows about Lucent. However, the GLW
culture thrives and they continue to innovate since 1860. I really do not see
that changing very soon unless a Chinese company buys them out.

EKS, let's look at the two thing you posted on. New and innovative products and
IBM's turnaround.

When you say, "So, I really do not look to GLW to move based on a "catalyst"
but rather to develop something new and innovative in one of their several R&D
departments' you have to understand that something new and innovative is a
catalyst.

So, with all of their R & D and their different divisions why GLW has not come
up with something new and innovative or a catalyst is a negative.

Then you cite "I suspect Paul Senior see the same thing. He was very successful
(and an early investor) with his IBM purchase. IBM is the leader in building
their patent library and probably has the best R&D division in the world."

IBM's turnaround was not based on their patent libary or their R & D. They
turned a better profit by providing service rather than a product.

Company expects next year's (6/'13) earnings to come in at $3.35-$3.50

today's price. 2.4% dividend yield now isn't much. Otoh, Cardinal is a Dividend

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: UVIC, GLW, MSFT, MGDDY, MHR-D,

New positions: BAC, JOY
Positions increased: MAUXF, CYOU, NOK
Positions reduced: MHR-C, ARY
Positions eliminated: SNDK, IDCC
Flip-flop:

Sold more fixed income (MHR-C, ARY) as prices continue to climb above par. I
can't say I am good fixed income investor, so I did not find any good
alternatives for these now.

Sold SNDK on the runup after results. It may or may not be a good investment
longer term, but I am not confident enough to bet either way. They have
positive trend of increasing SSD use, however, they are in a very competitive
field and I am concerned that this will be similar to HDD sector before recent
consolidation. Companies may periodically flood the market with SSDs and flash
resulting in poor sales and margins. High-margin periods might be short lived
as consumers would be reluctant to pay much in sectors that experience
continuous price drops.

I sold IDCC on the court decision runup. Similarly to SNDK, I am not sure IDCC
is a good long term investment, since their future depends on court decisions
and patent-war pricing.

I added to MAUXF during stock pullback and to CYOU & NOK on stock drops.

I decided to dip in my toes back into BAC (pun intended). Small exploratory
position.
I bought a small position in JOY assuming that the cycle will turn sometime
again and the price paid might be reasonable.

I've followed WRLD for several years. I use my standard p/e, roe, p/stated
book, growth in stated bv, profit margin metrics for evaluation.

Too bad for me, I got scared out of the stock a couple years ago ---
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26876267&srchtxt=wrld
---for the reasons you've noted (possible government (Fed and states) crimping
of WRLD business, and the aspect of "earnings maintenance". Which is that
people keep rolling over their small loans, and in this scheme analysts have to
wonder how/when that ceases for the borrowers. Borrowers eventually default?
(Does WRLD care? Defaulters are replaced by other people? WRLD makes so much
money (%-wise) before the customer defaults, that it's worth it to WRLD even if
there is an ultimate default?) Government says/implies the continuing rollover
is a form of financial entrapment and therefore must be stopped/reduced/more
stringently regulated?.

--- Anyway, that possible crimping of WRLD by the government hasn't happened
yet, and WRLD's business and its stock keep moving forward. That new fed
consumer finance oversight operation is now in place though, where it wasn't
before. It's tbd politically how much bite it will have (Dem's for, Repub's not
so much so).

Company still looks very good or better on some metrics -- as you found from
your screen. I keep WRLD on my watch list -- to see how the relationship
between governments and WRLD plays out; to remind me that I should/coulda dint
keep a stub position; and finally, for a possible short term trade -- which
I've never had the confidence to make (too bad for me).

=============
My opinion is this: If you have to rely on what seems to me to be an arcane or
esoteric method for valuing this company or the finance subsector, and you're
not getting satisfactory answers to your questions, and you feel you need such
answers to value the company properly and to make a buy or pass decision ---
the decision would be to just pass.

Not that I'm right. WRLD's been a great stock -- a good ltb&h:

Re: GOV

Added to my GOV shares that I started in the IRA account. Through Vanguard
Brokerage, I sold 30% of my Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund (TIPs)
Fund (negative real rate of return) and moved the proceeds into GOV yielding
7.7%.

In this account, I believe I am early w/ TIPs, so eventually will move the
other 60% into other Funds, maybe into one or more corporate bonds selling at a
discount w/ a maturity of four years or less or other REIT and/or preferreds.

FWIW, this account started out as purely low cost Vanguard Funds. I linked one
of their brokerage accounts and have started to build a pretty good dividend
stock portfolio. Today, I learned that they have a pretty competitive bond desk
(and Web site) to purchase individual corporate bonds and/or treasuries. I plan
to build a bond latter w/ short maturities. At some time begin to add
Treasuries back into the mix (yields are too low now).

My take away, is Vanguard has a compelling service now w/ their low cost funds,
a very competitive brokerage service and a good bond desk (better book than
Schwab) where I got better quotes for a sample bond buy both at the Ask price
and at the Bid price. Their fee is $2.00/bond on the Web site or talking "live"
to a broker.

Schwab has large bond spreads (almost 1% higher on the ask for my sample buy)
but a slightly lower fee (when using their Web site) but a $25.00 surcharge
when order goes through a broker (any bond rated below B- must go through a
broker).

I plan to transfer my Treasury Direct Account to Vanguard. I have two bonds
left from a 10 year ladder I built that come due in 2013 and 2014.

I am finding some interesting values in discounted corporate bonds (sometimes
referred to as "junk" bonds) and have been moving some of my parked cash into
short maturity individual bonds.

Thanks for the bond info. I am interested in placing some cash into individual
bonds -- looking to have the ability to hold to maturity in order to ride out
bond volatility (and assuming the company still exists to pay on bonds and to
redeem them). Not sure what maturity I'd be looking at --- maybe five, possibly
ten year. If I have patience enough. Ideas/suggestions welcome.

I'll add more to my GOV position if/as it drops. Meanwhile, I decided I like
triple-net reit, LXP, and I've been acquiring shares now. On some comparisons
to other nnn's reits, it may not be so great (from some internet opinions).
I've not yet looked at those other nnn's. The yield on LXP is "only" 5.5%. Much
less than something like GOV. For me though, this reit provides some diversity
and yield to my portfolio. I've followed the company before, had not done well
with it. I believed it to be conservatively run, but it was over-leveraged, had
to cut the distribution, and the stock cratered (too bad for me). In reading
the company's latest presentation, they seem to indicate they have learned
their lesson, they have cut back leverage and are cutting back leverage, and
their current dividend is sustainable (they suggest or I infer).

OT - The Old Geiser

It's funny because as I was reading through his blog, I was thinking about you.
What I found interesting (and educational) is that he goes through and tracks
all of his trades, even the 1 and 2 bond buys 7 sells. I have limited
experience w/ individual bond buys but he lays out a pretty good argument(s)
for his buys and sells. That's what motivated me to look into buying individual
bonds ( at least while the stock market is close to all time highs).

I thought I could do some trolling in the not so liquid corporate bond market.
Let me know if you discover any potential values.

I started a position in the SVU 5/2016 8% bonds $1000 PAR. Got my first chunk
at $863.40/bond on 8/3/2012. I have followed http://goo.gl/dzd86 . Their recent
credit facility for $471M that closed last week got the 5/2016 9% Notes Yield
To Maturity over 13%. That's when I bought. The current ask is now around
$894.00/bond at Vanguard.

For me, it's a special situation rather than buying more common shares at least
for now.

So, maybe The Old Geiser can enlighten me with some fresh ideas as my SVU bonds
are already up 4%.

Remember that these corporate bonds are not liquid and depending on the
brokerage's "book" will determine the best price you can buy & sell. So far,
Vanguard seems to have a pretty active book (w/ institutional investors). Also,
on some of these, you can put in "low ball" GTC orders that over time may get
you a fill if there is an anxious seller.

I suppose this is another type of "Value Investing" but you really need to
understand the company and their debt exposure. It's all about the risk/reward
and you would probably want/expect to hold these positions to maturity.

FWIW my first investment was at 17 (National Semi Conductor and Southwest
Airlines) bought from proceeds from my paper routes (San Jose Mercury News).
Actually I had two different paper routes but only delivered papers on one of
them but did the collections on both. I could see w/ a basket of individual
bonds getting to 100 positions but I have now worked my stock positions down to
70 individual companies.

GOV. One aspect of GOV that might affect the stock price is that CWH still
holds 21% of GOV's shares. If CWH is in some difficulty (as reflected by the
stock price now), and if CWH wants to, or has to, raise cash or otherwise
dispose of its GOV shares, that could (or not) depress GOV's price. Enough to
get you your buy price.

Just making a comment. I've no idea of the likelihood of CWH's actions here or
what CWH's difficulties might or might not be.

I'm somewhat conflicted with the performance of these utilities. On the one
hand, there seems to be a rising tide of people who want safety and dividends
and dividend growth. Utilities have provided these. Even excluding this year's
good performance of utilities, utilities have been very good ltb&h performers
over many years (outdoing the S&P many, many times). So imo people have been
right to be in utilities and may very well be right to stay with them and maybe
continue investing or reinvesting (their dividends) in them.

It's just that if I look over my portfolio, the average p/e of my utilities is
higher than the average p/e's of my tech stocks or health care companies ---
sectors where I historically have seen and expect to see higher p/e's because
of the expectation or actuality of these being growth stocks, i.e. one pays up
(higher p/e) for higher growth.

It seems to be topsy-turvy now. Or can it be that the real growth is in
utilities, and that there's been and will continue to be, a lack of growth in
tech/health care,etc.? Maybe it's the new reality or maybe just the fashion of
the times.

I look at ATO. I'll call it a utility because it has its regulated component.
Current p/e is 18.7x and forward is projected at 14.9x (per Yahoo). The
dividend yield is about 3.8%. That p/e is higher than stocks like AMGN, ZMH,
GOOG, AAPL, and so many others that I hold. In my portfolio, the only tech
stock I have that has a higher forward p/e than ATO is QCOM at 15.0x.

I just can't get my mental arms around these utility p/e levels to sit still
for the situation. So for me, I take some ATO and others like it, off the
table. Just saying how I look at it, what I am doing given my investing
proclivities.

PetroFrontier Corp. provides "Owen-3" drilling update in Southern Georgina
Basin, Australia

Press Release: PetroFrontier Corp. – 3 hours ago

CALGARY , Aug. 9, 2012 /CNW/ - ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pfc.v ) -
PetroFrontier Corp. ("PetroFrontier") is very pleased to announce that the
vertical section of the "Owen-3" horizontal well has been drilled to a measured
depth of 1,180 metres. Drilling of the horizontal sidetrack is underway and is
expected to reach up to 1,000 metres in approximately three weeks. This will be
PetroFrontier's third horizontal exploration well in the Southern Georgina
Basin, Northern Territory, Australia .

A total of 32.5 metres of core was cut and retrieved from the Lower Arthur
Creek "Hot Shale" and Thorntonia Carbonate formations. <u>PetroFrontier is very
encouraged by the initial assessment of the cores which seeped oil upon
retrieval and had extensive florescence throughout.</u><u> </u>The well was
also wire line logged with equally encouraging results indicating over 25
metres total vertical depth ("TVD") of hydrocarbon bearing formation.

Completion operations are expected to commence later in August. PetroFrontier
intends to conduct ten-stage fracture stimulations at each of its three wells:
MacIntyre-2H, Baldwin-2Hst1 and Owen-3H. In order to maximize operational
efficiencies, the wells will then be flow tested after all wells have been
fracture stimulated.

PetroFrontier is encouraged by the results to date and the fact that there are
now three wells that have shown very encouraging oil and gas indications in the
Lower Arthur Creek "Hot Shale". These results have the potential to add
significant value for PetroFrontier shareholders.

About PetroFrontier Corp.

PetroFrontier is an international oil and gas company engaged in the
exploration, acquisition and development of both conventional and
unconventional onshore petroleum assets in Australia's Southern Georgina Basin.
Founded in 2009, PetroFrontier is one of the first companies to undertake
onshore exploration in the Southern Georgina Basin in Australia's Northern
Territory. PetroFrontier's head office is in Calgary , Alberta and its
operations office is in Adelaide , South Australia. PetroFrontier's common
shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol "PFC".

I don't understand, why GOV appears attractive to people in this thread. GOV is
a spinoff from HSP (which many here owned), which was a mediocre Reit managed
by RMR. GOV and CWH (HSP morphed into CWH, i think) which really means that an
asset manager/gatherer (RMR) manages these Reit's not a dedicated management.
think closed end fund. They get a fee based on the size of the assets , which
means that they will do a secondary or merger whenever they can to expand their
asset and fee base. You can see the pattern with CWH and GOV very clearly and
this will always put a lid on the NAV and the stock price. GOV was created
during the financial crises, because having the government having as a renter
seemed Golden and let them spinoff assets and gather more via subsequent
secondaries to finance more purchases.

Just read the last quarterly earnings transcript and Michael Bilermanns

RMR. RMR consists of greedy bastards. The compensation is too high and not
aligned with shareholder interests. RMR also conveniently took their
compensation in the form of stock at the market minimum in 2008. I own some GOV
hoping that the one degree of isolation from CWH would provide insulation from
the portnoys. I agree that one must be careful here. Thanks for posting.

Alpha has a write up which relates to this. I do not agree that their RMR
interests are aligned here because of their history of greed:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/790711-government-properties-income-trust-is-no
-cheap-enough?source=yahoo

GOV has no employees. It is managed by RMR, a company owned by Barry and Adam
Portnoy (father and son, respectively). Barry is a trustee of the REIT and his
company, RMR, receives management fees for running GOV, so RMR has an incentive
to increase its management fees, a potential agency problem. That is all well
and good, but it does not tell the whole tale. The Portnoys also own a company
called CWH, which owns 21% of GOV. The ownership interest and dividend income
from GOV far outstrip the management fees they receive, so this should put
future potential shareholders at ease that the incentive structure is still
more or less properly aligned with their own (always remember that it will
never be perfect in a company owned by some and managed by others).

I've also been feeling that its time to sell utes and I feel uneasy about
pharmaceuticals as well.

Out of curiousity, I took a quick look at the numbers comparing ATO with AMGN,
ZMH, GOOG and AAPL, the stocks you mentioned.

ATO is selling at 134% of its 5 year avg. P.E. AMGN is also above 100% in this
metric and the three other stocks are selling at a discount to their 5 yr. avg.
PE.

Then, I looked at their p/b and ATO comes in at the cheapest. Or the rest, only
ZMH had a p/b of >2.

I also looked at each stock's 5yr avg. net profit margin. ATO barely squeecks
out a profit while the other stocks ranged from 18-26%.

And for kickers, I looked at each stock's GN. ATO is selling at just about its
GN. ZMH just above its GN and the rest are selling at huge premiums to their
GN.

I should look at other metrics as well, debt particularly, but this is as far
as my curiosity will take me.

Conclusion: Same as yours. Based on al of the above metrics, ATO is not a
bargain. And the other stocks you mentioned may not qualify using GN, but based
on the other metrics may present a better value, noting that different sectors
are generally given different book value weight by the market.

I suspect that using EKS' GN method; applying expected EPS instead of reported
EPS might make a value case for GOOG or AAAPL but not for ATO. And if so, and
one happened to be inclined, it would be a good start for further evaluation.

I don't see why I'd want to bet on a turnaround when competitor stocks right

(Not that these Yahoo co's are the best competitor companies or best metrics to

I've read the Barron's positive write-up on NBR. Apparently on EV/Ebita or
price/cash flow, the stock is undervalued. I don't use those metrics usually,
and I've no comfort factor with them here. So I'm not willing to make a
purchase based on analysts' conclusions that the stock is a buy based on those
metrics. So this is likely to be one stock that if it continues to move up, it

maybe people are attracted to utilities because dividend and there are certain

Okay, how about I conclude the opposite.

"People are attracted to utilities because the dividend". Of course, the yield
is a consideration too. If somebody bought a utility that paid $4 on an $80
purchase, and the stock went to $120 with the dividend rising to $4.40, they
might be very happy. Especially if they look at current dividend on purchase
price ($4.40/$80). Now that the yield current yield though is $4.40 on $120 or
$3.6%, is that the point where maybe new purchases and new investors might
better consider non-utility dividend Aristocrats that pay in excess of 4%?

Employment pickup will benefit utilities. Okay. What about though the current
glut (I assume) of natural gas. Utilities are switching over to nat gas. What
happens if or when the populace realizes input costs to the utilities may be,
or are, going down and utility profits are going up -- maybe too much up?
Regulators and/or politicians pushing for rate decreases? Is this a possibility
or maybe even a real risk?

As I imply, after selling some, I still hold several utilities. I am cautiously
holding on . So far, stockholders in so many, many of these companies (I'd say
almost all, but I don't have enough knowledge of the subset) have done well
with buying and holding and reinvesting. That is so. Whether it continues and
for how long, I do not know. The higher the p/e's get though and the lower the
dividend yield becomes, the more the risk. Imo.

I'm trying to say I hold some stocks that I believe to be growth stocks. Or at
least that I believe others would say might be growth stocks. I'm not now
suggesting here about them (all the ones I mentioned) that they are value
stocks -- better value stocks than ATO.

I mean to say that since they are growth stocks presumably or at least I am
looking at them that way, I (and others presumably) would expect them to have
high p/e's and other "expensive" metrics.

So what's cockamamie to me, and I can't quite fathom, is-- why if they are
growth stocks, are their p/e's in general <u>lower</u> than the p/e's of so
many utility stocks? Can it be they are less growthie than utility stocks? Or
that utility stocks show more growth and as consequence garner the higher p/e's
? Or that it's a momentum thing: positive for ute's; not so much so for
drugs/tech/etc.?

I guess though that does get to the point, where is value in this market.

XIN summary,

Great quarter, 0.94 on a $2.88 stock. 0.36 was on a one-time tax reversal, but
0.58 is still fantastic. Great cash generation. Acquired some foreclosed lots
in the US that it will develop and market, this is small, but a diversification
away from China seems reasonable. Buyback starts again in 3 days after blackout
period.

Announced new internal cash audit procedures to supplement what E&Y is doing.
Non-deal roadshow in US in September to drum up interest.

Already went ex for 0.04 dividend, which it plans to continue for foreseeable
future -- buyback and dividend are showing me the money.

Chinese property sales in July stayed high according to government releases.
Thus even though I do not expect earnings to be as strong going forward, I do
not expect them falling off a cliff.

Before I start sounding like a pure pumper, XIN was more cautious about
guidance going forward. There are few areas riskier and with worse sentiment
than Chinese real estate (including significant country and regulatory risk)
and there is still a non-zero probability that it is a fraud.

One more consideration on utilities companies, not relevant to their P.E. but
to their book value, is the huge amount of land that they own. Some of these

Its seems, through your posts, that you remain an investor truly interested in
"value". You comment about buying shares as a stock drops and lighten the load
as they become over valued. Assumming that this strategy has worked for you
over the ages, your only risk seems to be "is it different this time?". In the
case of utilities you see that the historic valuations that you use are out of
kilter with your definitions of risk and reward.

Isnt that how you have defined overvalued? Look at it this way, how many
analysts, investors, newsletters etc. DON'T tout the value of dividends? Look
at REIT yields amazingly low, MTG REITs are popular again, Utilities paying 2%?
Remember when the NASDAQ was going to trade higher than the DOW? There will
ALWAYS be a reason that some industry or trading strategy is going to grow to
the moon. Is there anyone out there, (well other than Ahhaha), that thinks that
dividend paying stocks are NOT a good idea? Group think, Thats what keeps them
popular. Popular = pricey. unpopular = cheap. In all good consciencous I can't
see why you would keep any of these positions. You are correct IMHO the risk
reward versus "growth" stocks just isnt there. It is highly likely that the
"dividend " strategy will underperform for a number of years (starting when?
who knows). It is the hope of most that they will be able to get out in time
(or reallocate). It doesnt take much of a downtick in dividend paying stocks to
kill any chance of a decent Total rate of return.

You seem to have a very consistant style of investing. You actually HAVE an
escape plan. Value. You may be early by a couple of years, but why would you
want to ignore what has worked in the past. Is it different this time? NO. Sell
off a few shares from time to time just like you planned. Good Luck!

invest big (or maybe at all) in most shipping stocks. And although DHT made
money last Q I suspect only 3 of their ships make money currently (due to old
contracts at favorable rates), and next year that may reduce to only one ship.
So without a turnaround in shipping rates soon, the dividend is probably toast
and it goes lower.

OTOH: In the report, Global Hunter Securities writes, "We believe that dry bulk
is at the low point of an extreme boom-bust cycle, driven primarily by
oversupply. Shipping in general is a very cyclical industry characterized by
significant booms and busts. We note that this dynamic is driven by the fact
that vessels are long-lived assets that have a multi-year lead time from
ordering to delivery. Given this, an unexpected positive shock to demand can
lead to several years of high rates, as new deliveries don't enter the fleet in
sufficient quantities, which is essentially what the industry experienced
starting in 2003. However, at that time, the positive shock to demand from
China's voracious appetite for commodities led to an extreme spike in rates in
2006 through 2008, which also brought with it a surge in new orders for ships.
Since late-2008 the dry bulk industry has been suffering from a massive supply
hangover."

But it may be that investors have come to be too complacent about this
cyclicality, and that is why ship building has continued at too high a rate
such that the duration of this downturn may be extended. We shall see.

Fwiw, I'm holding shares in these shipping companies:

GASS: for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carriers

TGP: for liquefied nat gas (LNG) carriers

TOO: for offshore-to-shore carriers (FPSO/FSO/shuttle/etc.)

KEX: for inland and coastal transport

SBLK: for bulk carriers. @$.54/sh, I view it as an option with no expiry date.

XIN - If I had to choose cheap Chinese company to invest into, I would
definitely prefer non-RE related one. IMHO, RE is one of the riskiest places to
be in Chinese market, since IMHO there may be a bubble there and if it pops,
this can crash way low. I would prefer companies that might not be directly
affected by RE and infrastructure slowdown/drop.

This is part of the reason why I'd rather buy Chinese gaming companies or
advertising companies rather than XIN.

OTOH, there is value in diversification, so XIN might be a position in well
diversified Chinese stock portfolio.
I will skip it though.

Disclosure: I have large positions in CYOU, GAME, PWRD.

<blockquote>3 x the amount of debt (why having debt at all with so much
cash?)</blockquote>Funny, you don't ask this question about MSFT, GOOG, etc. :)

Companies with tons of cash have debt because:
- Debt is cheap now
- You cannot get debt on moment's notice - it's better to get it beforehand
- Debt might be covering levered assets (think mortgage)
- For multinationals, debt is usually in one country while cash is in another
and neither are easy to move. (Chinese companies get debt in USA to pay US
divvies, since exporting yuan cash is not so easy...).

For Chinese stocks there was an argument some time ago that they look more
credible if they have debt, since banks may do better DD than investors. Now
you are complaining about the opposite. So damned if you do, damned if you
don't? :)

I'm not saying XIN is not a fraud. It may be. However, there are tons of legit
reasons to have tons of cash and some debt. :)

Clownbuck,

XIN is in a cash-intensive business -- cash is required to bid for lots from
the government. Also, some of the debt (and there is one particularly high
interest debt that rolls off in one year) was taken when they thought they'd
need the further money to expand but decided to hold back. That particular debt
is hard to justify, but overall the debt seems reasonable to me. And of course
the company has done better than expected and generated a lot of cash recently.

The $425M revenue is 6-month, not quarterly revenue, quarterly is $253M in
revenue, some of which I attribute to a growth sales in Q2 as China lowered its
borrowing rates and there was a pick-up in sales countrywide.

They have spent $10 million on a buyback, plus significant money on dividends,
and have just started another $20 money on buyback, which will restart in 3
days. It doesn't make sense for me for a total fraud to be spending so much
money on its shareholders. Their auditor is Ernst & Young, and they have beefed
up their cash verfication procedures given the recent spectacular files such as
Longtop, but nothing over there is certain ...

Re XIN

GOOG and MSFT indeed can borrow cheaply and that is why they borrow, despite
having tons of cash already. XIN pays ~6.5% which I would not call terrible
cheap:

The rates of interest payable on our long-term bank loans are adjustable based
on the range of 95% to 120% of the PBOC benchmark rate, which were raised by
the PBOC four times from October 19, 2010 until April 5, 2012, and may be
raised in the future. The PBOC benchmark rate for a one year loan stands at
6.56% as of April 5, 2012.

But after reading the 20F, I do know why they are borrowing ;they have
significant funding requirements that are due within a year for their RE
projects...

I also found this one odd:

The note is secured by the mortgage of our shares in our wholly owned
subsidiary, Xinyuan Real Estate, Ltd., or Xinyuan Ltd., which indirectly holds
all of our assets and operations in China. If we default under the note in the
future, the holder may enforce its claims against these shares to satisfy our
obligations to it. In such an event, the holder of the note could gain
ownership of the shares of Xinyuan Ltd., and, as a result, own and control all
of our subsidiaries in China.

They basically mortgaged the stake in their main operating subsidary to obtain
a loan. I don't know, seems kind of iffy to me. If I have an operating sub, I
would have that sub loaning money on the assets of that sub, rather than having
the shares if that sub pledged -is this sort if like a margin loan? The sub is
not publicity trades (only XIN shares are), so I am not sure why this strange
construct was chosen.

XIN, the more I read, the more interesting it get's. One thing, is clear, the
yahoo numbers are very deceiving. This company is way more leveraged, than the
numbers suggest at a first look. For example, they seem to guarantee more and
more of their customers mortgages:

As of December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, our outstanding guarantees in respect
of our customers’ mortgage loans amounted to US$509.2 million, US$666.4 million
and US$709.5 million, respectively. If substantial defaults by our customers
occur and we are called upon to honor our guarantees, our financial condition
and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.

In a way, these diclosures make an outright fraud less likely.

SEH. I pass on it.

Erratic earnings and book value.. In ten years, in best year couldn't earn more
than 12% on equity.

I challenge The Street's timeframe and conclusions:

"The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue
growth, impressive record of earnings per share growth" ...

<li> "SPARTECH CORP has improved earnings per share by 33.3% in the most recent
quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a
pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past year. We feel that
this trend should continue. This trend suggests that the performance of the
business is improving. During the past fiscal year, SPARTECH CORP continued to
lose money by earning -$0.76 versus -$1.62 in the prior year. This year, the
market expects an improvement in earnings ($0.25 versus -$0.76)."</li>
They have what they feel is a trend; I have what I feel is a trend. My trend
isn't based on two or three data points of improvement for this ugly company.

I guess if you buy into the company, you buy into the strategic plan. Co says,
" "Our focus in the second half of the year remains on executing our strategic
initiatives. This includes implementing operational improvements to enhance
margins, accelerating growth in our specialty products and continuing to reduce
our cost structure".

I guess after ten mostly cruddy years, it's about time.

I don't know enough to buy into the plan and its results so far. So it's a pass
for me. Stock could rise again from current value. I don't see much margin of
safety though. Jmo

XIN - I think we mostly agree: the risk is in the RE business, its requirements
for cash (as you observed), and partially-invisible leverage of RE assets. They
might have entered some financing deals at subpar terms just to get growth and
capital. As I said before, I'll skip it. :)

is this is one of those chinese RTOs, i thought they were required to be
fraudulent, no? my personal experience with a couple of them and from watching
at a safe distance for a couple of others makes me think a 10 foot pole is not
nearly far enough to stay away. i have been in some where net cash pretty much
covered the market cap, but alas apparently they have a different definition of
cash than i do. buy out offers from the CEO also seem common. they just never
actually happen.

if it looks too good to be true....of course there will always be that one that

In the past. I've looked at this company extensively and have passed on it for
now. Some brief comments-FWTW. I think POL , SHLM, and EMN are eating their
lunch right now . Performance plastic player EMN also has a venture with POL.
It's Highly leveraged and more suited to the domestic market. I made some money
trading a company called WLM that was highly leveraged like this. I however
lost more as it filed chapter 11. Kind of left me with a bad taste. As I
notably like high risk situations. I'm not to say that you can't make money
here. Given the high sales level here at the expense of low profit margins. Any
setback in this company's strategy going forward. Will keep you on your toes.
That's if your just a buy hold type of player in this stock.

BTW-I've owned this company before, and exited with a nice profit. I sold it
when it was doing much better than it is now..

sold the NBR August $13 puts. I pick stocks that I would be happy to own if

I have CLF Sept. 35's. I'll take that yield and wait it out if it sells down
that far. FCX Sept. 31's. etc.

I sell the puts when the premiums are good, and since the majority of my
portfolio is in long term divvy stocks that are reinvesting, this is my living
money so to speak. Usually have about 10 option positions open per month.
Impossible to buy all the stocks, but the option leverage creates a decent
