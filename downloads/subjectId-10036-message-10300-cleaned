Starting a small position today in BankAtlantic Bancorp (BBX) which is "the
largest financial institution headquartered in the State of Florida".

Some negatives about BBX: two classes of stock-- some associated controversy in
how management deals with the stockholders; BBX may be too diversified for its
small size
("BankAtlantic's strategy focuses on providing a wide range of lending services
(commercial, small business, consumer, mortgage), deposit accounts, business
and individual checking accounts, and a growing array of non-interest income
and fee generating activities" (quotes from BBX website);
certainly for me it's near impossible to analyze the company given its complex
components; BBX is just one more small bank among many.

Positives include very low (relative) price to stated book value (.7), low
price to cash (according to stock screen I have), low p/e.

I've given up on Mellon(MEL)- sold out my position - the stock only rarely got
above the buyout price management rejected couple of years ago. I am betting my
prospects for a 50% gain in BBX (regression to mean) surpass likelihood of a
50% gain with MEL.

JMO, and I've been wrong many, many times.

Keith, now would be the time to consider ANAT, imo.

This would be a value stock for the really patient, buy-and-hold value investor
imo. A difficult stock for normal people -g-.

The Moody family controls and they have their agenda.

But a stock buyer now gets the stock 50% below a slowly growing book value, at
a relatively low price/sales, with no long term debt, some-but-not-much sales
growth, pe under 5 and dividend yield approaching 6% (which looks like it gets
bumped up every year).

I would say with ANAT - a "difficult" business (insurance- and maybe they're
not so alert or equipped to handle the internet) - there's still a good margin
of safety with the stock/company, albeit not a heck of a lot of prospects for
great capital gains.

Financials are well outside my circle of competence, though that is the
industry I've worked in since 1991, but we'll see how I do. I prefer analyzing
a widget maker any day.

If you can back up, concisely with facts, your assertion that Conseco is
financially stable I would be interested in hearing more. I have had this stock
pitched to me at every "bottom" for the last three years, mainly by people who
couldn't explain in a sentence what the company does. The Forbes article in
November cited a few posts ago convinced me to stay away one more time. So far
I have not been wrong. What convinces you you have a margin of safety here, or
are you playing odds (1 in 3 it goes bankrupt, 2 in 3 its a triple - that can
be a great investing strategy, but if thats what you're talking about tell us)?

Until I get really convinced to look hard at a Conseco, I'll just keep playing
my game with plain vanilla insurance and very selective financial stocks that I
understand (kind-of - financials are not my strength, but when they all go down
you've got to buy some). Mine are ABK, BRK and HMN. My favorite CMH is half
financial, too. The first two I was buying near the lows, HMN I don't know how
I missed it below 13 since I was a buyer at 20 and hadn't sold. I just got so
frustrated I forgot about it I guess.

As for banks, I was having a hard time finding one that didn't have exposure to
something I didn't want to have exposure to. MTB was probably the cleanest I
found (I am very worried about any bank that has done major acquisitions in the
last five years - it makes their financial statements unintelligible to me. I
also worry about residential real estate exposure in any West Coast market,
Texas, DC/Virginia, New York and Boston - that rules out a lot of banks -
common denominator is homes bought with stock options as collateral, and even
if the bank was lending responsibly, the home's price was set by some other
buyer buying with a loan guaranteed by stock option collateral. I liked First
Virginia FVB until I remembered where AOL is headquartered.) I get concerned
about the big money centers when I hear that one of the biggest of all, Chase,
has most of its book value in venture capital equity (and presumably loans to
these same companies). If you want to own Chase long-term, just put in a
good-til-canceled order at 40 and wait patiently for it to hit. Believe me,
when it does, you won't want it to. Why MTB? How much trouble can you get into
in upstate New York and Northern Pennsylvania. And Buffett has owned a big
chunk of the company for a while. I almost pulled the trigger at 410 when my
boss sold all the bank stocks in his personal account and put them into MTB.
This is my firm's bank analyst. Then I almost pulled the trigger again at 363
and bought Berkshire instead (something like 1450 on that trade - so I got the
same 20% or so off the bottom there). So I own no MTB and it is now back up to
446. Still worth a long look though I have a hard time buying something I
passed on 20% lower. There are many cheaper bank stocks out there in terms of
P/E and P/B ratios, but look at MTB's financials for a while - go back ten
years mindful that they haven't done the kind of acquisitions that make most
large banks' financials almost meaningless in my view- and think about the risk
level of their loans and I think you'll see what I saw.

My other pick in the financial sector would be United Asset Management (UAM).
Look at the cash flow statement. Look at the market cap. And recognize that
their revenues are a percentage of assets under management, which go up and
down arithmetically with the stock market - there's the risk. The company is
buying back 10% of its stock annually.

There is always something to worry about with banks and insurance companies.
What insurance worriers were worried about seems to have played out, and I
think the stocks have bottomed. What bank worriers were and still are worried
about has not happened yet. The stocks are down, but the negative catalyst is
still out there and nobody knows precisely what it is going to be. But it is
always something. Maybe my "recommendation" on MTB above, given that I do not
own it and am not planning to buy it, is more of an "if you must own a bank..."

Here's some ratio comparisons for CNC from Market Guide.

http://yahoo.marketguide.com/mgi/ratio/2194N.html

According to this, CNC has very strong cash flow, including a price/free cash
flow ratio
of 3. Strong free cash flow does not indicate a company choking in debt to me.

There is a considerable discrepancy between the price/book and price/tangible
book
ratios, which reflects carrying a lot of goodwill from acquisitions on the
books. However, the price/tangible book ratio is positive, and less than others
in the industry.

The tangible book will no doubt drop a lot with write-offs from GNT, but cash
flow
isn't affected by one time charges, and is a better indicator of a company's
short term financial health.

re: CNC
How much debt rolls in the next year? On what terms have they been able to
refinance recently? Have they been adding to reserves? What do the delinquency
ratios at Greentree look like? Have insiders been buying the stock? Is the
company buying back stock? How much of that free cash flow is from asset
liquidations? Those are the kinds of things I'd be looking for after reading

CNC did refinance recently, with an equity infusion from a private investor who
has a good track record in picking undervalued stocks. Insiders have been huge
open market buyers of the company's stock, and in fact now own around 20%, if I
remember correctly.

However, it turns out the company has been guaranteeing loans for employees to
buy stock, and the Street doesn't like that too much. Personally, to me a debt
is a debt and if insiders are willing to be massive buyers of stock on margin,
then that is bullish.

Free cash flow, by definition, is operating cash flow minus capital
expenditures and other similar commitments. Hence, asset liquidations, since
they are one time gains/losses, are subtracted out in determining operating
cash flow, would not increase free cash flow.

Trained as an actuary, I have a bias against investing in a bank or an
insurance company. The simple reason is that the liabilities are real and the
equity base is usually too small a percentage of the assets for me to feel
comfortable to "leave the driving to them", since I can never know enough about
the invested assets to be comfortable. I saw the 100-year large, old-line
Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company go down the tubes because of too
aggressive real estate investing.

On CNC, equity less good will is about $1.4B or 3+% of assets. In my opinion,
buying into such a leveraged business when there is turmoil is really asking
for trouble. It's for speculators only, not prudent investors.

Uncertantly and the war stories increase perceived risk and so deflate the
acquisition prices that great deals can be uncovered - if you can know what you

that most of their assets were in conservative bonds and mortgages. An

Folks, Don't Know If This Fits Or Not...

While certainly not new to SI--long-time WAVX holder and poster--this is my
first time over here. I've found what I think is a pretty strong value play
with a twist. The company is Billing Concepts (BILL).

Here's all I know. BILL is a profitable company with money in the bank that
happens to be the biggest brand name in a mature industry, Local Exchange
Carrier billing and transaction processing. Last year, they got into some
trouble with FTC "slamming and cramming" charges that have since been resolved.
Such penalties have haunted the LEC business for several years. But, this
created some downwards earnings surprises... which, of course, isn't good. In
addition to these woes, the company made some missteps, trying to spin out
their Aptis Software division which has 125 customers nationwide including IBM
Global Services and contemplating taking their holding in another company
public. Neither of these two events occurred.

So much for the bad news. Beyond profitability and cash in the bank, what's the
good news? They've taken a 51% stake in a leading Electronic Billing Payment
and Presentment company called Princeton eCom. CKFR is the leader, by far, in
the EBPP space. But, Princeton was the original pioneer of e-billing and has
been gaining momentum through alliances with MasterCard and CyberBills, etc. To
learn about Princeton eCom, one need go no further than www.billingworld.com
and do a keyword search for "Princeton." This company IS an industry leader.
And at BILL's recent shareholder meeting, the CEO made it plain that they would
be IPO-ing Princeton sometime later this year. This IPO will be a success...
given the space.

BILL has also just completed an "accretive to earnings" purchase of OSC
Teleservices, a company that specializes in customer relationship management
and directory assistance for CLEC and car-rental and other firms. This
acquisition will shore up their core "transaction processing" holdings and will
add something like $4 million to their coffers for acquisitions.

Last year, BILL acquired an online instant-loan approval engine called "FiData"
and is rolling that into a portal for the credit union industry called, I
think, www.good2CU.com. I suspect more developments along these lines in the
near future.

Bottom line: profitable company with a goodly amount of cash.Kaffman Fund is
one of its largest holders. An acquisitions plan that is taking the company
squarely into The New Economy. And a Princeton eCom IPO on the horizon.
At around $6.40--with a floor, I think, at $5--this looks like a good,
interesting, long-term hold.

Like I said earlier, I don't know if this fits the profile of the kinds of
stuff you folks invest in. But, I think it definitely qualifies as a value
stock.

I allege the following are value stocks:

Garan(GAN): Selling about 1.1x book value, no long term debt, ROE about 16%,
5.5x cash flow, 7.6% profit margin. "Excess"(?) profits paid out as extra
dividend (not reflected in Yahoo) Negatives: apparel mfger with vast majority
of sales to Wal Mart. Offset somewhat by possible consumer brand "garanimals"
Other negatives: a small float with strong insider/owner control.

Steel Technologies (STTX) 11.3% annualized growth in sales over past 5 years,
relatively low psr of .2, .6 price/bk, 2.8x cash flow. Negatives: small cap
steel co. with d/e .9, insider sales. Adding this one to my steel positions --
X, AKS, and steel suppliers UCR, CLF. I see a double in a couple of years --
although I have to wear glasses over my contact lenses -g-.

Cemex (CX): 3rd largest cement producer. Primarily focused on third world.
Everybody seems interested in the build-out of the internet/wireless/telephony
for third world. I'll go with the idea there's a bunch of third worlders who'd
like to upgrade their basics like having cement floors instead of dirt in their
houses. CX in Mexico, from what I read, specializes in marketing cement - one
bag at a time. P/e is 6 (all these cement/aggregate co's are at low p/e's), ROE
25%, p/bk 1.2.

GAN, STTX are selling near annual lows. CX is in a low part of what might be
its trading range.

A compelling value: Terex Corp. (TEX-NYSE) $14 3/8

Terex makes earthmoving equipment, giant cranes, and other heavy construction
machines. The company been growing very rapidly in recent years through
acquisition. Revenues have more than doubled in the last two years, from $842MM
in '97 to $1.85B in '99. The company has remained profitable throughout the
period. Concensus EPS (six analysts) is $3.90 for 2000, which would give TEX a
bona fide PE of 3.7.

The company's earnings reports are complicated by numerous one-time items,
special charges and changes in accounting treatment for income taxes, making
year over year comparison's difficult. Also, the company is highly leveraged
(2.6 to 1 debt to equity). These factors have undoubtedly contributed to the
investing public's discouragement with Terex over the past 6 months, during
which time the stock has declined 54%.

Now Terex trades below book value and at 21% of revenues. By comparison,
Caterpillar, which has shown zero growth and declining earnings in recent
years, trades at 2.7 times book value and 75% of revenues.

Two insiders have purchased $135,000 of TEX since February 2000.

Management has stated that the company will focus on improving its capital
structure in 2000. This, and some more easily understandable earnings reports,
should bring some renewed interest to TEX over the next 12 months.

jeff,peter,joan,armin - u may have seen my posts on Anthony@Pacific about
Conseco, CNC, and a few of the facts & best guesses as to the situation at/with
CNC.

1. Disagree with bank/ins co reason for not investing since:
(a) assets are not the only item to consider
(b) u can chk into the assets by reading the NAIC statement blank, AM Best,
S&P, etc publications
(c) u go long in a co b/c of the overall situation - most times there are both
+ve & -ve factors

2. Failures of ins co's such as Mutual Benefit, Executive Life, Confederation
Life, were due to a large extent LIQUIDITY crises. This takes into account both
assets and liabilities. The Liabilities and Assets were not well "matched".

Aggressive real estate investing is not necessarily a bad thing, but when there
is a heavy concentration of it in a particular area, a particular type, etc,
that can be a contributing factor.

On the liability side, these companies got into trouble with the GICs and other
"spread" savings products (ie short term liabilities) they sold. These products
have an implicit put option for the buyer (buyer of insurance product can
cancel at any time) and there may be few or no risk mitigating product features
such as MVA's and surrender charges. To the extent these products were sold by
brokers (vs career agents aka company emplyees) the cancellation risk could be
more significant.

Add it all up, if a customer wants their money the ins. co may need to sell
assets prematurely and if those assets are longer in term/duration than the
liabilities together with rising interest rates, the ins co will take a capital
loss.

If there is any hint of financial trouble, you can bet more of the ins. product
customers will want their money. Institutional investors are typically first to
request/put the ins contract back to the ins co. This could create a "run on
the bank".

So, why didn't the ins co's just buy some shorter term assets? B/c the yield
curve was "normal" shaped (yields for shorter term assets were smaller than for
longer term assets) for most of the period, the market was very competitive and
margins were shrinking so the only way to achieve profit goals and meet market
demand for higher rates for customers was to invest in higher yielding assets.

3. Good point on good will

4. CNC also has arrangements with potential investors whereby funds were lent
out and having a strike price near "$20" and a penalty CNC was to pay if price
below "$20". Guess what, price was below $20 in Dec.

5. Anyone rem PennCorp, which tried to be a CNC and grow by acquisition. PFE
made acquisitions but the businesses were (in hindsight) underevaluated,
requiring reserve increases, and not integrated that well ie less synergy, and
admin systems were poor, likely not noticing the underreserved problem for some
time.

6. CNC had been known as a good acquirer until the mobile home financing co
purchase. Admin systems likely better than PennCorp situation.

Prudent investment? Don't let me start ...

My thinking:

With banks it's the assets that are virtually unknowable.

With insurance, particularly Property/Casualty, it's the liabilities which are
unknowable.

Conseco has both assets and liabilities which are difficult to know - future
claims re insurance and consumer receivables of questionable quality.

I spent 6 months analyzing a P/C company that we eventually acquired. I watched
the liabilities mature. I can confidently say that the Statutory filings are
not sufficient information. The liabilities stated are based on estimates of
future claims. Very very difficult to know.

Made my first investment in awhile outside the Tech/biotech area- DPH- Delphi
Auto parts. which may have been discussed here in the past. Company reported
nice qarterly earnings, and very nice growth in subsectors of the company-It
has also annunced an agreement with Ericson to supply internet and wirless
access devices to cars which I think will be just huge. At 8.5 times earnings
seems hard to go wrong. Also technically the stock is just a couple of points
away from breaking a double or triple top and the could precipitate a very
strong short term rally. Unfortunately CEGE MRVC MADGF THQI continue to get
clobbered along with everyone else. Perhaps value and tech stocks is preceived
as an oxymoron.

James: Re: CNC. I live in Indianapolis, and the Sunday Indianapolis Star three
weeks ago printed an article detailing the process of insiders getting loans
from the company for $millions last year to buy stock at about $40/share. The
loans were co-signed by the company. When interest came due, and the
"investments" were worth less than the loan value, the company gave the
insiders more loans to pay the interest. When the stock price got down to about
$20, the company (i.e. the managers and directors, a.k.a. insiders) decided to
loan the insiders another round of $millions, again at no personal risk in the
case of default, to buy another round and "lower their average cost". Now that
the price is below $10, they collectively hold paper losses of over $8 million
(if I'm recalling correctly)--the difference between the loan value and the
stock value. (I've looked, but can't find a copy of the article on their
website, www.starnews.com.) If you look at the insider trading log on Yahoo!,
you'll see a list of these $millions and $millions in insider buying. To some
actual and potential outside minority shareholders, this has been an
encouraging sign of management and director confidence. Knowing the rest of the
story, that isn't the conclusion I draw.

Conseco is known for aggressive accounting, which makes it difficult for almost
anyone to determine the true value of their assets.

Their liabilities, includes at least five issues of preferred shares and
"Financing Trusts" that I know of. One of these (symbol CNC_pf on Yahoo!) is
the result of 4-5 "refinancings", i.e., shares have been bought up and replaced
with the proceeds from another preferred stock issue, in the past 10 years. In
other words, they use very complicated methods to finance their business, which
makes it difficult for almost anyone to determine their true liabilities. By
the way, these preferred stocks and "Financing Trusts" currently pay dividends
ranging from 16.6% to 29.1%. It doesn't look to me like Mr. Market thinks these
coupons are very predictable.

In summary, management consistently misrepresents to their partners (the
shareholders) the true value of the company's assets and liabilities, and has
borrowed $millions from their partners, with the deal being that if the price
goes up, management gets very rich, and if the price goes down, their partners
(the shareholders) will cover all their losses. (They tell the outside minority
shareholders this is good because owning a lot of stock aligns management's
interests with shareholders' interests.)

I've been watching this situation for entertainment and education, and because
it is a company people around here have always perceived as great local success
story. I never claimed to understand their business and so never invested in
it. I also have seen TV interviews with the CEO Hilbert. Just my opinion, of
course, but I would estimate that he takes over 95% of his business advice from
philosophical followers of Niccolo Machiavelli, and less than 5% from
philosophical followers of Warren Buffett.

I don't think I'd trust these guys with the job of mowing my lawn, much less
with the job of running any type of business I owned.

I personally wouldn't buy a piece of this company at any price, because I have
zero confidence that anyone, including management (people who live on
perceptions don't spend much time looking at reality), has any idea whether its
value is above or below $zero.

Just My Opinion,
Brendan

<<Congratulations on the good bet.>> re: my QQQ short, but you might want to
ask where I made the bet. I am about breakeven on that one, and very happy to
even be there. What just kills me though is that I got stopped out at 8 1/4 on
TGLO (now at 3) and at 93 on ASKJ (now 27) less than a month ago. I would have
had a GREAT day today if I had had the stomach to stick with those. Thanks for
all the advice about why not to short internet stocks. Turns out I was dead on
right, had the right names, and still managed to lose a fortune. You've got to
do it once to understand it, and everybody telling me not to had been through
this in a past life. Just like when somebody tells you not to do Tequila shots,
you've just got to find out for yourself.

I was looking to buy all afternoon, but was having trouble finding compelling
ideas. Tech isn't even close to where I would start bottom fishing. Not even
close. I've been predicting a 40% drop in the S&P for a long time now, and have
found my buys in the areas of the S&P that have already had that drop. The
techs were the last sector standing, and now they're not anymore, so maybe we
finally see it in the indices. The last three weeks seemed like maybe the techs
could go down leaving the stuff I own unscathed, or even up. But today's got to
shake that hypothesis.

What I like about this thread is we always look stock by stock. Did anybody
find anything compelling in the wreckage today? I bought RAL and GTSI, but I
would have expected a lot more, and a lot more compelling. Maybe after a few
more days like this. But on an afternoon with the market down 6%, I just had to
buy something.

After much thought at the end of trading today, I did not cover the Nasdaq
short. I was actually trying to short some low-quality internets that were
still in double digits this morning, but could not get through to a trader at
Fidelity.

Two sentiment indicators suggest that we are within days of a bottom:

* Today VIX reached its highest level since Oct. 98. Two views of this:
http://www.tscn.com/wsc/Corporate_Snapshot.html?Timespan=520&Symbol=vix.x&Times
an=260&TSym=VIX.X&PH=2

hdr2=0&hdr3=0&hdr1=vix.x,oex.x

* CBOE equity put/call ratio is unusually high

Both of these indicators point to a very high level or investor pessimism, and
they are historically good at indicating bottoms when they reach extreme
levels, as they did today.

I bought OEX calls at the close today. When you're in a hurry because you think
you're near the bottom, this is faster than shopping for stocks.

Thanks for your input. This feels and looks like October 1998 to me, aside from
the technical indicators. October 1998 started a new bull run of large
proportions. I am much more skeptical this time. There are too many open
questions:

How much will this effect the economy? I would not want to be a seller of
luxury housing at this time.

Will Greenspan stop raising rates? He should.

Does Greenspan care if Gore loses because of a crash?

My hunch is that we are close to a countertrend move lasting more than a day or
two, to work off the oversold condition, but that we will eventually make lower
lows, unless most of the open questions like those above are resolved
favorably.

What do you think?

I would add one more open question, perhaps the biggest. Is the Nasdaq at
anywhere close to the kind of valuation where the invisible hand steps in to
force a bottom. i.e. where companies take themselves private or where you get
cash takeover deals (or at least a plausible case for them) or at the very
least large share buybacks. I don't think we get there until the Nasdaq is well
below 2000, if not much lower. And I can't think of a sector that has bottomed
without those kinds of things happening.

I agree with you, next week we probably see a trading rally - whether its off
the current price or 10% below that remains to be seen. But that may be a rally
to short.

You're totally right. Everything's so overpriced,

Take a look at the insurance sector. Besides CNC, which is controversial but
beaten to a pulp recently and looking very cheap, there are ACL and UNM. All
three are cheap relative to their sector, and relative to the market in
general.

CNC made a controversial decision to buy Green Tree, and the stock has never
recovered. Now, management has decided to sell Green Tree, perhaps at a big
loss. Green Tree has had some accounting issues, but the insurance business is
solid. For those with patience, I think CNC could be a four to six bagger.

I am underwater with this one with an average price of $14, yet bullish enough
to sell some Jan 2002 $7-1/2 LEAPS recently. I think $7-1/2 is the bottom for
CNC, and I found the $3-1/8 premium too much to resist. My breakeven point for
the puts is $4-3/8, a price we'll never see.

ACL has a solid management team, but was beaten down along with other insurers,
due to claims from hurricanes, etc. The stock is cheap in almost every item of
comparison with the sector. There has been significant insider buying of the
stock. I think ACL is a double or better in 12 - 18 months.

UNM has had a couple of messy quarters since the merger of UNUM and Provident.
The merger has some pain, but the resultant company will dominate a number of
insurance areas. I see UNM as a double or triple in the next 12 - 18 months.

I like Terex (TEX), a construction equipment manufacturer. TEX was beaten down
after guiding analysts downward for FY00 earnings. Basically, FY00 earnings
were guided downward because management felt analysts were using too low a tax
rate, as NOL credits expired, and one division's sales were soft.

The stock got hammered as analysts lowered their estimates, but look at the
ratios! Trailing P/E is only 2.15 and FY00 P/E is only 3.8! This P/E of 3.8 is
in line with the guidance given by management, so the sell-off is way
overblown. This stock is worth $30+ IMHO, not the present $12-13.

The present management team took a company whose balance sheet was a wreck,
turned it around, and made a series of good acquisitions. There is still a fair
amount of debt on the balance sheet, and management says it will pay down $200
million in debt this year and buy back 2 million shares out of their strong
cash flow. I also think there will be somewhat of a pause in the string of
acquisitions, while the new acquisitions are digested, and also grown.

If you like this one, buy before earnings are out on 4/26. Management can't buy
any shares back right now, and they are sure to buy more after earnings are
released. I think the earnings should be pretty good.

<<<This feels and looks like October 1998>>>

More like March of 1997 when the Fed wanted to see a stronger Dollar against
the Yen. Or maybe it's like all of the artificially induced panics that hit the
market every 6-9 months including October 1998. This round was triggered by the
swarms of faithful investors who believed they could buy Microsoft at any price
and nothing bad would ever happen. It doesn't matter that Department of Justice
antitrust proceedings were in the news on an almost daily basis, the faithful
kept buying anyway.

No sane person could possibly believe raising the cost of oil and bumping
interest rates once a month is going to slow inflation. I can't think of any
two factors combined which would be more certain to increase consumer prices.
It raises everyone's cost of doing business and those cost increases are passed
on to the end users. In a tight labor market, raising costs to consumers is
absolutely certain to cause laborers to demand higher wages.

I've watched a number of Greenspan's speeches and my impression is that he's a
nice old duck that no one has the heart to fire because he's senile. As long as
he waffles on every issue enough to quote anything he says out of context, he
gets to keep his job. In the mean time the Fed wants to get the Yen back up in
the 110-115 range regardless of what it does to the economy or equity markets.
These panic sell offs also put a lot of liquidity back into circulation.

The usual cycle is profit taking, margin calls, bottom fishing, short covering,
and then the big short squeeze. Short term, I think the best bet is to raise
cash to do some bottom fishing later and maybe park some money in REIT's which
will be reporting earnings and dividends over the next few weeks. The REIT's
are less volatile than the rest of the market and most of the dividend pay outs
are substantially higher than money market rates. Earnings tend to benefit from
higher interest rates and a lot of them are trading at a discount to tangible
book.

Jurgis, Jim Clarke. Well, I agree with Jim C. in that I'm not seeing or
experiencing "compelling" buys. Which is a surprise to me. I would've expected
lots by this time.

But my view is very much different from your perception, Jurgis, that
"everything's so overpriced,that I did not find anything to buy after this 30%
drop."

(Assuming we're talking about value-type stocks.)
There are still many, many good value stocks out there that could be bought
now, and possibly should be now by value players. Although of course, it's
definitional also-- how we each define "value stock" or "compelling". Still, if
you are able to find and read the newest (4/13) issue of Barron's, there are
now articles mentioning the "undervalued-ness" of stocks that have been
discussed on this thread several times. For example, a full article devoted to
Fleetwood Enterprises (and mentioning some mobile home competitors like
Oakwood, et. al.), valuation estimates for American Airlines, and some others.
(aside: I have a tiny position in AMR, and added to FLE recently).

Jim, if I understand what you are saying, you are looking at a bottom kind of
signal when companies are being bought for cash or by insiders. I don't exactly
see that happening now, but I do see quite of bit more consolidation (buyouts
for stock or combo stock/cash) in a couple of industries. This would be food
especially. Also building supplies and some insurance. Perhaps a tad with home
builders. I take all this as a positive sign. JMO.

Maybe I was misunderstood. Sectors bottom when you see those signs. I was
pointing out that the tech sector is not even close to the point where you will
see share buybacks or insider buying. I would guess insider selling may
actually accelerate now that the game is over - many of these insiders paid
nothing for their shares, so if they can get $50 million instead of $500
million, it still buys a nice house.

I emphasize that in many many sectors we are well below the prices at which
cash transactions and insider purchases commenced. That is why I remain a fully
invested bear, short one sector of the market. I wasn't talking about a bottom
for the market where I would start buying - I'm buying now and have been fairly
aggressively for the last month. But I have no desire to bottom-fish in tech
land, because you don't bottom fish 100 feet above the water level.

I have been watching the financial news programs and reading the financial
press closely this weekend, and I see very little "buy the dip" talk. In one
sense, that makes me confident to stick with my short position. On the other
hand, my contrarian side is telling me if the techs are down Monday morning it
might be prudent to cover.

I am still waiting to hear the horror stories. Many many individual investors
margining these garbage internet stocks had to have been cleaned out completely
last week. We'll probably end up bailing out their retirement accounts with our
tax dollars when this is all over.

OOPS - wrong thread, or actually, I just got

So to explain myself. I was just answering to Jim.
My strategy is as follows. When market tanks, forget
about value stocks. Forget about net-nets, cigar butts,
low-market-cap-to-cash. Forget about
low PEs in boring businesses. When market tanks, it's
time to buy growth, gorillas, quality, whatever you
call it. No Mattels, ECIL's, CONVs, LHO's, GTSI's.
It's time to look for BRK, KO, PG, JNJ, MRK,
MSFT, CSCO, HWP, ORCL, ADBE and other super names.
And these names even after 30% correction are way
too high. So I am not buying anything. Does this
clarify my position?

I may buy RAL, DNB and more TSG, but at this time
I prefer to wait and see whether they or some
of the gorillas get into a low-low net.

have considered this question and probably go half and half - as extreme
bargains emerge, buy them, but keep some cash in reserve to buy the great ones
when they come in. I kind of look at my holdings in REITs, Homestake Mining,
and in Tice's Prudent Bear fund as "better than cash" - i.e. REITs and

Did anyone see TheStreet.com's TV show over the weekend? Cramer recommended a

Now Cramer is many things, but he's not a hypester. In fact, IMO he would have
to feel very strongly that TSCM is undervalued in order to make that call. Of
course it's possible that he lacks the proper perspective to be able to make a
good judgement on the stock's value.

He's certainly got me thinking. It's true that their business model is
questionable, and I haven't looked yet to see how bad their cash burn is.
However, even in light of last week's events, the brand has to be worth
something. I suspect that that "something" is far enough north of $1.00 to make

he bailed and went to an internet investment banking job three weeks ago. Ouch.
And I bet he didn't own REITs in his personal account. Double ouch. I've been
sadistically looking at message boards on stocks I rarely would look at unless
in short mode and am seeing some horrible margin call stories. "I took out a
second mortgage on my house..." That should be good for Clayton Homes.

I was thinking about making a wish list and throwing in limit orders on my
dream stocks. But when I look at my dream stocks, they are at least 30% above
where I would buy. Not that there won't be some screamers out there if the

oh how I wish I had pulled the trigger harder).

There is a story about Ben Baruch at the time of the crash in 1929. Somebody
saw him and said what a horrible market, and he replied, "Not if you're

Gary G. You have been right about Dial (DL), and I have been wrong. You (and
blankmind) apparently liked DL after the PG debacle, at about Dial's lows last
month (@10 1/2). It's now about 14 1/2. So a nice percentage gain there.
Congrats. (aide: -g- although you DO lose points - at least with me - if you
didn't actually buy the thing ---your posts here never directly stated that you
recommended buying, or had bought.) I had chosen Alberto-Culver, also in the
same industry (imo) and also near its lows, as a better buy than DL. It too
moved up, but not as much, percentagewise, as DL. I am taking profits in ACV

Hi I2. Well,if the market had gone down another 10% or more today, I would've
expected a third decline of at least 10% tomorrow, and so it would've been like
'87, where, sitting in one's office at the end of the third day, kind of frozen
like a deer caught by a car's headlights, one could think, gee just two or
three more days like the last 3, and anyone with any money could buy the whole
of GM, or LLY or IBM, etc. for mere pennies on the dollar. The stocks literally
looked like they were going to zero. But as I recall, the carnage ended by the
third day.

Today I don't see any 'gifts'. I've added to my position in IDTC today - it's
selling below what cash value might be if/when a deal with AT&T closes.

Perhaps people are breathing a sigh of relief today. I know I am. I'd rather
not have the market crash. I realize the Buffettologists and some value
investors are digging in their heals in anticipation of their turn to get the
perfect pitches they like. My experience with bear markets though is that
everybody I see (including me) gets hurt. People with money either don't invest
because the trend seems to be down (why buy today when stuff is cheaper
tomorrow?) or if they buy, the stock(s) drop soon after and they bail, or if
they buy after the bottom is hit, they take small profits in a bear rally &
still miss reinvesting or something else happens or doesn't happen. The upshot
is that when it's over people will say they were not satisfied or happy with
they way they dealt with their being in the bear market. Even short sellers.
Painful for everybody (98%). That's my opinion/experience anyway.

If the market goes down a lot tomorrow, it will be imo, because people are
using today's respite to lighten their positions or adjust their mutual funds.
This could continue on a daily basis, exacerbated by the realization that the
problem goes beyond "tax selling" - what the media/others reported/believed was
a prime reason for the sell off. I don't recall, but would such a drawn out
decline be more reminiscent of 1966? I believe so.

Meanwhile, I believe the economy is moving along, people as of last week anyway
-g-, still had money, bonds don't look so compelling as they did years ago when
bond yields were higher, I don't see people putting funds into real estate
ventures (spec. housing/partnerships) or oil and gas stuff. I'd say the stock
market is still the place where people want to be.

JMO, and I've been wrong many,many decades. What's your take on all that's been
happening, I2?

Nice post.

I'm leaning toward the idea that we are now entering a secular bear market,
similar to the 1966 to 1982 time period. The market has been getting narrower
for a couple of years now, with only a few good companies now supporting the
market. Plus, there's all of the graphs like these:

Mike,

I'm a long time listener to your plays, and a recent addition to SI as well as
a first time poster.

Your TSG buy (if you actually bought yesterday) intrigues me, and I don't think
I quite understand your reasoning. Here's what I see, let me know what I'm
missing:

The company is the leader in the travel agency software business. Their
financial ratios are all very nice, except price to book seems a little high,
but can be lived with.

But, they recently lost a sale to AAA (arguably one on the larger travel
agencies in the country) which switched from mixed systems to one called
Apollo. And because of the internet, many consumers are trying to make travel
plans by bypassing traditional agents. What are they doing to embrace the
internet? Maybe they are already there? I would also tend to believe that
consumer travel may be curtailed a little bit with airline prices so high
(although I'm not sure what % of travel is consumer vs business).

It also seems a bit risky jumping in days before their earnings announcement. I
think I will hold off from this one until it shows a little more stability.

Also, I'd like to extend thanks for the JBX pick, I got in a little after you
did at 20 7/16.

I'd like to extend my thanks to reminding me to look at CCG (posted around

and passed. I got in before going on vacation on 3/30 around 28. Incidentally,
I had an opportunity to take a peek at CCG's newest mall under construction in
Orlando. It looks like they may have another good property.

I believe you are also a holder of LHO? Do you or anybody else have any
expectations for the performance of LHO for the remainder of 2000 or 2001? I
was in around 11 1/2 in December and it's moved into territory where I
typically get itchy to sell. (Note: My history tends to be that I sell early
more times than I sell at the right time)

USM US Cellular seems to be an undervalued tech play. They have a nice profit
margin 20%, average return on equity 13%, a trailing PE of 17, their 2000
estimates would put the PE in the mid 20's, but as a matter of "relative"
value, USM is cheap compared to VOD. They've got a low debt to equity of .24
and they haven't gone nuts issuing additional stock like many other techs.

I'm not a holder right now, but am considering it. Also, I tend to think that
USM may be a good candidate for consolidation in the wireless market.

James, just catching up after having my Internet service down for a while. I
think your bearish comments on technology may reflect your investment position,
and looking at only the large tech stocks. Many non-Internet secondary tech
stocks are down 60-80% from their highs AND I have talked to a couple of CEOs
who did express interest in buying stock. However, I would agree that it will
be tough for them to make progress if the more expensive larger ones continue
dropping.

I also heard from a reliable source that there was huge institutional shorting
of QQQ and buying of puts on leading tech stocks yesterday (Monday) - which can
be taken two ways. My son and son-in-law, experienced technology investors, on
the other hand independently bought QQQ in the low 80's.

Having read a lot of posts all at once, I would add that I am struck by the
unanimity of bearishness on technology.

<<I am struck by the unanimity of bearishness on technology.>>

Maybe on this thread, but the true believers are still out there - I just got
run over by a herd of them yesterday afternoon.

It remains virtually unquestioned that if you have a three year time horizon
tech is the place to be. It remains unquestioned that tech earnings will grow
faster than the economy. It remains unquestioned that the big tech winners now
cannot be displaced. Business news reports are probably 60% on tech stocks most
days. That doesn't sound like a sector that is even out of favor, let alone a
"unanimity of bearishness".

Two stocks I'll mention:
Yellow Corp. (YELL) reported earning this AM which were about 14% above
estimates. Also came in higher than Value Line's revenue estimates. Estimates
are for earnings of about $2.50 this year (they will probably ratchet up with
this release), giving it a multiple of about 8. Projections on the $2.50
estimate show EPS gains well north of 20 this year. At $20, the stock trades
only slightly higher than BV. Today's PR also mentioned a .com type initiative.
Trading near a 52 week high, well off all time highs. Bid slightly higher
pre-market. I have a long position.
One which I don't own, but am looking at is Abercrombie and Fitch (ANF). Value
Line is looking at earnings growth to '03-'05 of 32%, and $1.40 in earnings
this year. Stock is at 11 3/4. Stock has gotten absolutely crushed from the
high 40's. No debt. Wall Street doesn't like the fact that the company gives no
guidance vis-a-vis monthly comps. Another risk is that this company is
certainly dependent on the whims of fashion, and the ANF look could be
yesterday's news (or vice-versa).

Nevertheless, they have proven high returns on equity achieved with no debt and
strong past and projected earnings growth. And the brand name has proved the

I say CNF and YELL are fairly valued within an out-of-favor sector. The

though. I've got positions in several smaller trucking companies, and their
prices are below, or hovering at, my purchase prices. Nevertheless, -g-, I've
started a small position in BOYD today - a very small niche player within the
trucking industry.

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=boyd

Although the company has been increasing its LTD, it looks like a reasonable
bet to me that there might be a stock price revision-to-mean given some of its
financial ratios - p/e and/or p/sales and/or p/book. Revenues have doubled
since '95, so it could happen. Which would result in at least a 50% move from
current 5 1/4 price. The stock's traded near 9, or higher than 9 every year
since 1994 (since publicly traded, I believe)

Aside: FWIW, as pointed out by me in an earlier post, TFH is selling below net
current assets (but is not at the 2/3 net-net price for a Ben Graham purchase).
Current Assets - Current Liabilities - LTD = 38.4-32.8-0.0=$5.6M. Divided by

Re: ANF, I've watched it fall since it hit 40. Around 20, I thought really
hard. Went to a store. Turned around and walked out immediately. Too trendy.

And therein is the key to its high ROE/ROA. It has been "in" fashion. The
problem with all these chains is that they can fall out of fashion. ANF is a
century-old name that decided to get trendy in 94-95. It has worked. But the
problem is the survivability of the trend and concept. So I discount the
ROE/ROA numbers very severely. Especially when I think how hard those numbers
will get hit in a recession.

That said, I think the company is no Merry Go Round. It produces cash at or
above earnings each quarter. The clothes are attractive, and if I could afford
them I'd like to own some. Management has really thumbed its nose at Wall
Street, which I like. They appeared to be very focused on the long-term, and
are terse with the Street out of spite for the Street's short-term focus. But
then this last fall they go and have an illegal private analysts' meeting that
basically blows any proof of this theory out of the water (along with the stock
price).

That all said, I am buying ANF. Not in the portfolio I run so visibly on my web
site - yet. But in several other portfolios. In the 11-12 range, I feel there
is a bottom. My interest perked when the stock jumped on two downgrades.
Finally, the downgrades came. My wife was the one who alerted me: "You always
say wait for the downgrades. Well, they came."

The company is miniscule relative to something like the Gap and has much room
to grow in terms of store numbers. It also may benefit from Gap's fashion
missteps for all I know. For now, the earnings yield just seems to great to
pass up. Especially with a growing coupon.

Today, I did buy Symantec as my first pure tech holding since Oracle and Apple.
Only in one of my portfolios, in which the owner wants to be more aggressive.
But I did buy it. The reason I am attracted to it is that they are not only a
growing tech company at a reasonable multiple well below their 5-year
sustainable growth rate, but like my Apple and Oracle picks last year, they are
not being recognized for two big things:
1)Many still think of Norton Utilities and its second-banana Antivirus product.
It has expanded into much more than that, and dominantly. There is much growth
left and it is not Y2K or PC dependent. It doesn't seem that this is priced
into the stock, for whatever reason.
2)Cost controls at the company are excellent. The company is just about the
only tech player in Silicon Valley who does not think money is water to be
thrown on every fire. Very little excess. The company works from a tight
working capital base, keeping minimal inventories and tight credit with
customers.

After I bought, the company beat estimates by 10 cents. I was hoping it would
fall lower so I could get a chance to add it in some other portfolios, but it
does not look like that will happen. Here's hoping for another Nasdaq crash.

This is the top of the cycle for CNF and its ilk.
Same goes for Maytag. So do you buy cyclicals at 9 times peak earnings? Or do
you wait for 4000 times trough earnings or N/A. Rather, how about Clayton
Homes, which trades at 9X earnings and just announced in its conference call
this past week that these might be trough earnings? I know CNF well, and of
course the idea of investing in it or Maytag + Hoover just sounds right to a

Hello Michael,

Just happened upon this thread and your website. Love both.

I was wondering what your current take on EBSC is. The chart looks like the
stock could be forming a base with 4.5-4.75 as a strong base. OTOH, the stock
could be just consolidating between 4.5 and 6 for another leg down. Who knows.

Fundamentally, the stock looks to be generating serious earnings compared to
its stock price. I hesitate to buy 'value' stocks that aren't growing, but I'm
pretty sure that the CEO predicted 10% growth in earnings for the coming fiscal
year (on a pre-tax basis). With the recent comparable store sales reports in
February and March, do you think the company is still on a growth path for this
year?

They had a sequential decrease in sales to business customers

The second there was a pregnant pause at the beginning. The CEO says things
were back on track by March. I don't worry. In fact, I bought it in one more
account at 59. This is still a tech stock, and it has momentum players that can
crash it quick if they don't like the minute-to-minute play-by-play. Long-term,
