capacitors --

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=kem+vsh+avx&d=0b

I own KEM and VSH. I like KEM more because they concentrate in tantalum
capacitors. All three companies probably have a pretty equal stock price
outlook; I certainly cannot predict which has more potential. I shied away from
AVX since they are closely tied to Kyocera, but I'm sure that that is an
irrational reason.

When I worked in electronics the tantalum capacitors were always hard to get. I
saw an article recently which mentioned that Tant caps had lead times
approaching one year or more. So I am sure they can pass on all pricing items
that they want to. And from KEM last press release --

`The tremendous growth of our industry this year has resulted in tight supplies
of tantalum raw material, and some tantalum powder suppliers have already
announced price increases of as much as 60%. We expect to negotiate a
pass-through of these increases to our customers. Meanwhile, we are exploring
all available avenues to increase our immediate supply of tantalum powder and
wire for the manufacture of tantalum capacitors. Some tantalum ore producers
are already initiating capacity expansions, which should correct the
supply/demand imbalance.

good luck,

Anyone familiar with HCM (Mortgage REIT)? HCM is currently priced at 0.5X book
and pays a hefty 14% dividend. Last four qtrs have shown positive and rising
earnings.

My IV calculations, based on current dividend with no growth, indicate this one
is a no brainer.

Have noticed that Wally Weitz owns 800,000 shares at a $10/share basis.

Management recently bought out a disgruntled share holder at $5.75 /share.

What's not to like here? Any other comments about the perils of Mortgage
REIT's? High debt levels?

I'm not familar with HCM, but your post made me do a few minutes of research in
to it. One reason for the low valuation might be that even though it is making
money now (in a good real estate market), it has lost money over the last 15
quarters and over any period with in that that goes back more then 4 quarters.
If the real estate market cools down it might start losing money again. On the
other hand the valuation is low the dividend is high it has had 4 consecutive
positive quarters with growing earnings and good analyst estimates for future
quarters. I would want to look at its balance sheet a little closer and see if
can find out anything about the quality of the real estate it deals with but if
you think the real estate market is not going to signifigantly cool down soon
then this company might be a good investment.

HCM is one I owned and/or followed for over a year. I closed the position a few
months ago to raise cash, but it wasn't because I don't like the company. I've
had a number of conversations with the CFO who is in charge of answering
investor questions, and always considered the professionalism and quality of
management to be a big plus. Their new MBS trading site just went online in
October and I suspect it will generate significant revenue going forward once
some of the start up costs have been absorbed. The only thing I didn't like
about HCM is that watching it trade is about like watching a tree grow. I think
it's just about as good a quality investment as a person could pick for an IRA
where you wanted to see a good yield and forget about it for 10-20 years, but
the low volume and slow movement makes it hard to watch for a more active
investor. I also think it looks a little like it's pointing toward a leveraged
buyout by insiders sometime in the next few years. With the float decreasing
substantially through stock repurchases, insiders already own most of the
outstanding shares. It wouldn't be all that hard for them to say, "Here's your
money, there's our stock, have a nice day.". I don't consider that to be a
downside risk, but it could take away the choice of when to sell. The Company
doesn't have analyst coverage, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does
leave it off everyone's radar screen for the big jumps caused by beating the
numbers. It's a company I happen to like a lot, and I don't see how it could be
a bad choice to add small position to a portfolio for a little diversity. The
value is there and management has done a good job of increasing earnings and
dividends over the past year after the missteps of two years ago. I also think
they've come a long way in reducing their exposure to market risk from where
they were at the end of 97.

If you're serious about looking into the Company, I think it's one which is
worth the time it takes to do the necessary DD, then give Tom Kaplan a call if
you have any questions. I didn't listen to the last CC, but the playback should
still be available. As I remember, they were using V-Call for the playbacks on
their quarterly CC's, so you can probably listen to all of them by downloading
the free version of RealPlayer and going to the site.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

In July 2000, as previously reported, the Company's Audit Committee recommended
that the Company's prior independent auditors be discharged and that the
Company retain a new independent public accountant to audit the Company's
financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2000. As a result of a review
initiated by senior management and conducted prior to completion of the audit
process for the Company's 2000 fiscal year, information was developed that
indicated certain accounting errors might exist in prior years' financial
statements that, when corrected, would result in a material impact on the
results of operations for the 2000 fiscal year and certain prior periods. At
the conclusion of the review, the Company determined that the financial
statements for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998 required restatement due
to accounting errors. The errors consisted primarily of the following: (i)
incorrect recording, classification and valuation of inventory work in process;
(ii) incorrect recording of certain prepaid and fixed assets; (iii) incorrect
accounting for the acquisition of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary (the
"Subsidiary") and the related minority interest in the loss of the Subsidiary;
(iv) incorrect recording of certain losses relating to discontinued operations;
and, (v) the income tax benefit from stock options exercised. See Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements.

SPORT-HALEY, INC.
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company retained a new independent accounting firm shortly after June 30,
2000. The Company engaged the new accounting firm to re-audit the previously
issued financial statements for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, which
the Company restated. The Audit Committee of the Company retained an
independent consultant to assist it in evaluating the restatements that were
necessary in order that the Company's financial statements, as restated and
taken as a whole, presented fairly in all material respects the Company's
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Audit Committee does not believe that the errors
that have been identified by the Company constitute irregularities. As a result
of recommendations made by the audit committee and the Company's senior
management, and concurred in by the independent consultant, the Company has
taken appropriate action to ensure that these errors do not reoccur in the
future.

The effects of significant financial statement adjustments related to the
restatements for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998 are set forth in the
Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, which was filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 3, 2000. The effects of
the restatements on the specific line items of the income statement and
earnings per share for the period ended September 30, 1999 is set forth in the
notes to the financial statements accompanying this quarterly report (Note 2).

The restatements described above may lead to litigation against the Company.
There is no litigation currently pending or threatened against the Company
concerning the restatements. However, if such litigation is initiated, it could
have a material adverse impact on the Company's income from continuing
operations.

None of the quarterly filings for fiscal years 2000, 1999 or 1998 have been
restated to give effect to these adjustments. The Company expects to restate
material quarterly financial information for the prior reporting periods of
fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998.

As previously reported, on October 16, 2000, The Nasdaq Stock Market(R)
("Nasdaq"), halted trading in the securities of the Company and requested
additional information from the Company. Nasdaq has advised the Company that
the trading halt was instituted because of the Company's alleged failure to
observe certain corporate governance requirements for ongoing listing of its
securities on the Nasdaq National Market. Nasdaq has advised the Company that
the trading halt will continue until the Company complies with Nasdaq's request
for additional information, which the Company has provided. Nasdaq has further
proposed to de-list the Company's securities from trading on the Nasdaq
National Market. The Company appeared at a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Panel on November 10, 2000 in order to address the proposed
de-listing of the Company's securities. While the Company believes that its
positions concerning observance of Nasdaq listing requirements are meritorious,
the Nasdaq Panel has not issued its decision.

SPORT-HALEY, INC.
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company was advised in a letter dated November 7, 2000 that the Securities
and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry into matters

Hello,
I feel your pain. Not involved in LHSPE, but have been involved in BK
proceedings with others.
This one seems mildly intriguing, what with assets of 2.37 bil., liabilities of
about .5 bil. I know there are big time rev. recognition issues, but enough to
wipe out the difference between assets and liabilities? That difference equates
to over $13/share.
I don't know the story very well, what with all the litigation going on here.
But, it seems there has to be some value here!

The easiest way out of this thing with SPOR(E?) is for management to just make
a semi-fair offer to shareholders to take the company private for 5 bucks. Of
course the premise for that statement is that the financial statements are
correct. Otherwise it winds up on the AMEX or pink sheets. I really don't worry
too much about this one. It will work itself out eventually. That's the
difference between buying a stock for its income statement (smooth earnings
growth) or for its balance sheet (net current assets well above the stock
price). In my mental accounting I've written my investment down to about 3
here.

Oh, Gateway warns. More fun for Nasdaq tomorrow. I recall on the Simpsons when
Homer watches a news story about a guy in some horrible accident and laughs.
Marge is horrified. "Its funny because I don't know him," says Homer. That's
kind of how I feel about the Nasdaq. I have bought a couple tech stocks, but I
still find very few that meet my standards, and nothing large cap except Apple.
Now we're going into auto-sell at a lot of these companies as their executives
margin calls force more selling whatever the price. This is starting to get
interesting.

Trouble is we are paying for their incompetence. Should have known. Really low

********************
Lanier Worldwide Inc. Signs Merger Agreement to Be Acquired By Ricoh

$3 Tender Offer to Be Made For Lanier Shares

ATLANTA, Nov. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Lanier Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: LR) today
announced that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with Ricoh Company,
Ltd., a leading provider of office automation solutions. Under the terms of
the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Ricoh will commence a cash tender offer
on or prior to December 13, 2000, for all the outstanding shares of common
stock of Lanier at a price of $3.00 per share. Following completion of the
tender offer and receipt of Lanier stockholder approval, if required, Lanier
will merge with a subsidiary of Ricoh and each share of Lanier common stock not
tendered in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive
$3.00 in cash. As a result of the merger, Lanier will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Ricoh.
The Board of Directors of Lanier has unanimously approved the merger agreement.
In addition, Harris Corporation, the owner of aproximately 10% of the
outstanding shares of Lanier common stock, has agreed to tender its shares
in the tender offer. Closing of the tender offer and merger are subject to the
completion of the sale of Lanier's voice products business discussed below and
to customary terms and conditions, including the tender of shares by Lanier
stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted
basis and receipt of all necessary government approvals, including expiration
or termination of the appropriate waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act and approval of European Union antitrust authorities.
Lanier also announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its voice
products business to Platinum Equity, LLC, a privately held information
technology company. To ensure a smooth transition, Lanier will provide
transition services to the new voice products company. All current Lanier voice
products employees will be offered employment with this new company, which will
be known as Lanier Health Care. The voice products sale is scheduled to close
upon government approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
"We are excited about the tremendous opportunity this merger creates for our
customers, employees, and stockholders," said Wesley E. Cantrell, Chairman of
the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Lanier. "Ricoh has been an outstanding
manufacturing partner for Lanier, providing us with excellent digital color and
black & white copier/printers. We believe we can leverage the quality products
and technology of Ricoh with the worldwide distribution, professional services
offerings, and customer service excellence of Lanier to provide our customers
with the very best in document management solutions."
"We are also excited that the voice products business has both excellent
financial backing by Platinum Equity and a quality management team in place.
We are confident that this new company will continue to bring outstanding
technology solutions and services to its customers," Cantrell added.
The Robinson-Humphrey Company, LLC is acting as financial advisor to Lanier in
connection with the merger. Wasserstein Perella & Co., Inc. and Nomura
Corporate Advisors Co., Ltd. are acting as financial advisors to Ricoh in
connection with the merger.

Don - Thanks for your thoughts and suggestions on HCM.

I agree that it is a good quality investment. Was aware of the new internet
site. Not sure that it will generate any new revenues. Did not factor it into
my evaluation. If it is revenue positive, all the better.

Wally Weitz owns over 800,000 shares of HCM or 17% of total shares outstanding.
As best as I can tell, from his Value fund prospectus, he paid $10 a share for
HCM. I doubt Wally would let HCM management buy him out for much less than
$10/share. Wally is an astute value investor. I suspect he bought HCM at what
he thought was a discount to IV. If a buy out occurred, greater than $10/share
is possible.

As for "The only thing I didn't like about HCM is that watching it trade is
about like watching a tree grow.",I'm not sure I agree. From what I can see,
HCM has gone from $3/share in March to current $5.5/share. Just an 83% increase
in 8 months. Trees like that I like to watch.
While I'm watching am happy to take the fat dividend payments.

Have started to accumulate.

Good luck on your investments.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 30, 2000--G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

period. Diluted earnings per share increased 29.7% to $1.31 per diluted share
from $1.01 per diluted share during the same period last year. Excluding the
results of the Company's BET Design Studio joint venture that was discontinued
in November 1999, the Company would have reported net income of $7.7 million,
or diluted earnings per share of $1.12, for the prior year's period.

have increased both our top- and bottom-line numbers. Operating profit
increased 24.4% to $17.1 million in the three months ended October 31, 2000,

a strong year, and we will strive to continue to grow our businesses in fiscal

opportunities that will enable G-III to move forward with its growth
strategy.''

CLRN: Never thought I would bring up this stock on value investing thread, but
it's almost there.

Main points:
Leader in voice over ip segment, may have a 50% market share next year. Current
competitors are Cisco and Lucent, which are still playing catch-up.
Revised estimates upward this past quarter, and for next year. Upward suprises
in the past 4 quarters.
Very close to breaking even, actually posted a small profit last quarter.
Has $286 million in cash, no long term debt
Trading at cash value, or close to cash value right now.
I don't believe a slowdown in economy will slow the company down. Voice over ip
is cheaper to deploy, and cheaper to use then current configurations. No reason
to deploy anything but voice over ip in developing nations, etc.

if it had spiked up a bit. In fact I had an order in to sell a large portion at
1.25. Luckily I got up early and saw the news and had a chance to close the
order before the market opened.

I'd like to thank you for your excellent analysis that originally gave me a
reason to look at the stock. I'm sorry you didn't get to profit more from it. I
can't begin to tell you how may times I've lost patience with "value" positions
and sold out before reaping any gains.

I have a hard time with being patient -- although sometimes I hold my losers
much, much too long. The old psychology bit. I hold onto losers hoping for them
to rise enough to break even but sell out of positions when they "aren't doing
anything". Stupid thing to do but there it is.

OT: Books I am attempting to read:

I keep starting (and stopping) "Value Investing" by Martin Whitman. Lot of
nuggets/ideas. Takes more disciplined reading skills than I have right now. (So
I'm reading as a reference -- not start to finish.)

I recently bought "The Single Best Investment - Creating Wealth with Dividend
Growth" by Lowell Miller. I do like the approach of selecting and holding
stocks of companies with a dividend growth approach -- it is one method that
seems to be working in this market -- so far.

"The Gorilla Game" again, by Geoffrey Moore, et. al. Still tough for me to read
through because it's still feels to me too difficult (for me) to apply. Great
to be concentrated in those market dominating tech stocks that go up 10 or 100
times. But I'm too old-value school. Too many stocks of these gorilla stocks
have already gone up too much for me, and there are now so many good tech
stocks (chimps maybe) that're down. Guess I'm just a person who looks down for
his stocks, not up.

OTOH, I am also picking up again my copy of "100 to 1 in the Stock Market", by
Thomas Phelps. I like that book because to me it opens wider the possibility of
other great opportunity stories besides tech. The drawback being it may take
several times longer - like decades longer - to get that 100:1 return.

Again, "Market Magic - Riding the Greatest Bull Market of the Century", Louise
Yamada. This person was VP of Tech Research At Solomon Smith Barney when she
wrote the book, and maybe that's why her book just beats me up with too many
graphs. The book reviewer in 1998 (or '99?)at Thestreet.com said it was one of
the best books he reviewed that year. ---Ridiculous. And it cost me $48. I have
trouble sitting through even one chapter. Looks like this book's going into my
library contribution pile.

I've bought "The Company You Keep - A Commonsense Guide to Value Investing" by
Patrick Terrion.

I'm looking around the house for my misplaced copy of "Do You Want to Make
Money or Would You Rather Fool Around?", by John Spooner. This is a book that
resonates with me, and I was in my second reread of it. Stories with nice
insights about making money through concentrating efforts and concentrating
stock selections. Authored by a money manager who has dealt with all kinds of
markets and clients.

I've been carrying my copy of "Influence -The Psychology of Persuasion" by R.
Cialdini with me to read on airplane trips. Good book -- I've been "influenced"
by many of the the "weapons" described. (I believe this is one of the books
recommended to investors by Charlie Munger.) Also I'm packing "Flow - The
Psychology of Optimal Experience" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. (Or was that a
cat that just walked across my keyboard -g-). Powerful stuff in that book, I
can only absorb a little at a time; been at it for a while too.

And fwiw here(not much), I also recently got "Southern Belly - The Ultimate
Food Lover's Companion to the South", "Conquering Casino Craps", and for my
wife: "Four Paws Five Directions - A Guide to Chinese Medicine for Cats and
Dogs".

"...how much lower can stock go? I will add 1000 share blocks (big spender)

Alan,

I want to commend you for your tremendous patience and ability to take the
'long view'. At the time you wrote this message, I though "how foolish, he's
going to miss the big upswing...why not just buy the whole position now and not
risk losing out?".

I have this tendency to jump in too soon, and then get impatient waiting for
the market to realize the value (or do something, anything - react in some
way.) I have the hardest time just being patient and waiting the weeks or
months for things to work out.

When they don't go my way, right away, I tend to get out and jump into the next
"best idea".

Thank you for the valuable lesson in "the long view".

Thanks also to Paul Senior for sharing similar examples too numerous to count.
I'm always knocked out by the disepline demonstrated in statements like "...in

about himself/herself and other players as well. Anyway --- I have a very small

Regarding Biloxi -- I have tossed dice in Tunica, don't know Biloxi. "Southern

following Biloxi places:

Old Biloxi Schooner, 139 Howard Street (gumbo for lunch)

Mary's Drive-In, 560 Division Street, "for a taste of Gulf Coast po-boys at
their best". (Apparently these "Gulf Coast" po-boys use a softer bread than the

The Bloomberg article doesn't quite cover the facts. The fact is that ANALysts
don't have to wait for a company to beat estimates to create a profit taking
situation. All they have to do is keep bumping the estimates on a regular basis
and sell into the rally. Setting up buying opportunities works the same way.
Just wait for the company to fall short of sky high estimates and invent some
kind of crisis to explain it away. Also by bumping the estimates, it tends to
goad companies into stuffing the channel or to use other accounting tricks that
sets them up for a major correction about once every 12-18 months. Gateway is a
great example. The EPS estimates were close to 50% higher than the Company's
historic best quarter ever. Of course once one company in a given sector
"misses" unrealistic numbers, the gloom and doom mongers jump all over it as
"proof" that the entire sector is about to go out of business. The most insane
part of the article was the hyping of retailers. "If" the economy is slowing,
retail would be just about the worst place to invest. People who are out of
work, or are paying an extra $100 a month to buy gas for the car, don't go on
shopping sprees. Was Gateway really counting on the Thanksgiving weekend to
produce profits 50% above their best quarter ever? Give me a break!!! My guess
is a fairly healthy chunk of the fund money being held in reserve to target a
bottom is flowing back into the market right about now.

Freedon of speech is a wonderful concept, but it loses something when financial
news services are allowed to yell "fire!" in a crowded theater. Especially
after spending months telling everyone what a great movie it is.

little if any debt. It is trading from $8-$9/share today.

I simply do not have time to do any research anymore but I thought I would pass

I'm buying PLL & ESR

Pall (PLL) manufactures fluid filtration systems for a variety of industries.
I'm starting a position because the stock fits a relative dividend model that I
like. PLL is in a growth business (maybe), has a relative (to itself) high
dividend yield, and a very good history of increasing its dividend every year.

Encompass Services Corp. (ESR)"provides a portfolio of
electrical/communications, mechanical, janitorial and maintenance management
services to commercial, industrial and residential customers nationwide" (per
Yahoo). I'd guess this is a very competitive business for the janitorial
aspect, since there's not much barrier to entry (except that mom 'n pops can't
get national contracts). I am going to presume that having a nationwide
presence and staff of electrical and mechanical construction people is a
valuable asset not easily duplicated, and that these people will be in short
supply and remain so as long as things don't get worse than a "soft landing". A
positive that I like, from their 2nd Q report: "Our expertise in providing
infrastructure for voice and data communications projects has been a strong
draw, pushing total backlog to $1.8B."

ESR's struggling (imo)with a merger. It has a stated (not tangible) book value
of about $12. IF they could just earn 8% on it (ROE), that'd give about a buck
a share on a stock that's selling at about 3 3/4. IF they could, then the stock
is cheap now. Imo, of course.

Also fwiw, I'm taking more profits in Abbott, starting to take profits in
Cadence Design, and taking some losses in CXSN (might be a buy here for others-
I've lost patience and also want tax losses). I've closed my exploratory
position in Delta Airlines at a slight loss. (still have positions in other
airlines though). I'm also slightly trimming some tech stock losers.

------
LR is a buy imo for those who will bet the deal closes and who will be happy
with 1/4 on 2 3/4 within a few months.

AAPL, @<15 after hours, will, I suspect, present multiple 'buying

combination of the downside of a 'fad/fashion' cycle coming together with
downside of computer buying cycle [saturation, plateauing]. The cash will be a
cushion, but it's prospective performance that will drive this. Kinda tough to
figure that when, according to reports, Jobs is keeping his cards close to the

Management: Sold HD this morning @45.5 [In at 35 on recent dip].It popped on
announcement that GE guru Nadali would be new CEO. I'm sure Nadali is an
excellent manager, but I'm reminded about what Phil Fisher said about going
outside vs promoting from within. Going outside shows there's something
wrong/missing within the organization. When a company promotes from within it
motivates the rest of the team - there's hope to get the top spot, it verifies
the internal training and culture, and it promotes a smooth transition - the
new guy knows the culture and the systems.
With HD, the case is made that Nardali will bring e-commerce capabilities to
take HD to the next level. Maybe, but his 29 years @ GE have ingrained a
different culture than he'll find @ GE and have not included near as I can
tell, any experience in retailing generally or with home centers specifically.

Matter of fact even if he did nothing the fundamentals and economics of HD are

Sell at 45? No sir. The single most important determinant of return is the

Paul, I tripled down on Friday. My best guess is that the odds of bankruptcy
are quite low (10-20%). From what I have been able to learn about their
asbestos risk, they are in a much more favorable position than Armstrong or
even USG which Buffet bought (lower payout per claiment and fewer claims).
They currently have the cash flow to cover their debt payments and even their
dividend of 27%(though I think the stock would pop nicely if they cut the
dividend).
Hopefully the delisting is giving us an artificially low entry price. There was
a market on close sell order Friday of over 4mm shares (average daily volume is
less than 1mm).
Lastly, their underlying business has been hurt by the extremely low Euro (60%
of sales)and extremely high oil price (a major input) both of which I think are
due to correct.

Any way, I have placed my bet.

Asbestos/Post S&P Delisting: I picked up WR Grace, GRA, Friday when it was
delisted from the S&P with asbestos concerns along with CCK. Now that the index
selling is out of the way, I expect a significant bounce. I got good play on
ACK with similar strategy - sold on the bounce. The key issue is bankruptcy
from asbestos: This from the 9/30/2000 10-Q <<The net present value of such net
liability (based on cash flow projections that span nearly 40 years -
inherently imprecise but representing management's best current estimate) is
approximately $270 million (discounted at 5.2% - estimated after-tax investment
rate) at September 30, 2000.>>
Investor relations, Friday, confirmed this meant that this was what they
expected and that they did not expect to file [couched in the usual 'nobody
knows future' CYA's]. IR also confirmed that their cash position was solid and
they had no problems with credit lines. This is in stark contrast to what
Armstrong was looking like prior to it's filing.
Anyway, if we consider the 270mm npv asbestos as debt and run an 'asbestos
adjusted' EV/EBITDA you get 1.6 [By comparison average EV/EBITDA of specialty
chemical sector is about 6.6 and it's depressed like many industrial areas].
Worse case scenario, if it did declare bankruptcy, the market seems to be
rather kndly towards the both OWC ACK, since both are and have traded over a
dollar - so downside appears to be somewhat limited based on current market
behavior. Here's a comparison showing last 3 months trading activity.
http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=CCK+OI+GRA+OWC+ACK&d=3m&c=GRA One other positive was
that Mutual Beacon fund [Former Michael Price crew] owns a chunk of GRA -
They're considered top notch in distressed securities and value investing - and

It looks to me as if techs have bottomed generally. For example, the
semiconductor stocks I follow have made higher lows and higher highs over the
last week or so. Does anyone have any tech stock that offers good value that
has not jumped a lot? I continue to watch ACLS for what happens after the huge
stock distribution as a dividend to Eaton shareholders occurs on 12/29. There

Semiconductor stocks look oversold on valuation basis, but I'm having a hard
time buying the idea that the sector turns on a dime based on Intel not having
collapsed in the face of the most widely expected earnings warning in history.
I like to buy contrary news moves, but this one was more of a non-news move.
Once the turn is in place they could take quite a run, however, based on past

Donaldson's stock is out of the blocks after three years of lack-luster
performance.Meanwhile, sales and profits continued to grow however, which gives
DCI a very decent p/e ratio in regard of its growth prospects.

All the fundamentals look good to me. Management did not alter its strategy in
any way, despite the hard times. It continued to raise the dividend and buy
back shares each year. It also concluded a few acquisitions, which are folding
well in the company's portfolio of pollution control businesses.

Marc Fortier, I've been watching DCI for a while, trying to get a fill near 20.
Meanwhile, I've been buying PLL. Sometimes (depending on starting point), these
stocks have tracked each other, although right now DCI is up, while PLL is down
relative.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PLL&d=2y&c=dci

My preference is PLL, because the stock is cheaper (relative to DCI). Although,
of course, that doesn't mean it is the better buy. DCI may have market segments
that have better growth or there may be more buyer interest in DCI now that
it's exhibited a breakout.

Paul, if you look at a long-term chart of DCI and PLL, you'll see which stock
(and company) has been the best performer in the past.

Of course, in investing, the idea is to guess which one will do best in the...
future. As for myself, I believe strongly in Donaldson's prospects.

PLL's profit margin is better than DCI's and still management wasn't able to
come up with better growth lately, otherwise the stock would have done better.

Dividend is raised every year, like DCI. But the pay out doesn't leave as much
to reinvest in the business for growth. That may be a problem. I recognize,
however, that the yield is attracting.

PLL is interesting anyway and I'll check it further, if only as a comparable to
DCI.

Thank you Paul.

Yeah, Marc, I saw that about DCI having the better stock price over longer time
frames. Also better revenue growth rates.
Plus, in terms of the important ROE factor, I note now that DCI has had
increasing ROE (past few years) and is pulling ahead of PLL.
(Maybe I will have to adjust up my buy price for DCI afterall -g-.)

I selected the 2-year period in the last post because I'm reluctant to go too
far back or forward with the comparisons. I don't know enough about the markets
each company services. I assume there's overlap, but also some special niches
for each -- for example PLL's strength in blood filtration. It looks to me like
DCI is going to catch PLL in revenue. But I don't know enough about the margins
for the market segments, so I'm not able to guess which company is going to be
more profitable and more deserving of a higher p/e.

Paradoxically, although I find myself reluctant to make long term comparisons
between DCI and PLL, I am willing to look back to compare PLL with itself and
DCI with itself. I'm willing to invest in either company based on this rear
view mirror look. (I say they've both been good performing companies for many
years, if not decades, and have a decent business for which I can see continued
demand.) For PLL, I can get a low relative (to itself) price for its good
historical performance (sales, earnings, dividend improvement), so I'm a buyer
now, and I'll continue to monitor DCI.

My history in choosing the best stock from a given category is that I pick the
wrong stock. (And I don't always chose what looks to me to be the cheapest
either.) I seem to do better if I pick a basket or all (i.e buy several
companies but buy fewer shares/co although same total $ commitment to the
category). Still, it's hard for me to step up now to DCI since I didn't when I
had many chances when DCI was lower. Just don't like to chase, even though, as
you point out, DCI right now could very well be a far better investment than
PLL at PLL's "lower" price.

We'll know more as time goes by. It would be nice, and it's very possible, that
we both could wind up satisfied with our respective investments here.

Jurgis, I don't have skills to evaluate these companies on their current
technology or how their skills might play out in the evolving technology
marketplace. So I can't place a big bet on one company, or even choose one
company over another. For me, I have a package of these beaten down companies -
all of which seem to me to have some resources (like $) which could enable them
to continue on.
And, I am hoping, until better times and better stock prices prevail.

TRID is a seemingly (now) profitable company selling at about net-net value.
Company is in transition, moving from graphic chips for notebooks to chips for
digital tv's for the Chinese market.

SBLU is involved with digital audio through their "Rio" business. It's moving
away from its core graphics chip business looking for potentially better
opportunities. Cash in search of a business.

I segment ATMI within the specialty chemical industry, not as a semi-equip
company (as I understand semi-equipment companies). That is, ATMI business is
not just selling capital equipment to semiconductor manufacturers. More
importantly to me, it sells consumables used in the manufacture of
semiconductors. I see ATMI business correlated to the volume of semi
production, not to the capital equipment cycle. At current low stock price (low
relative to its recent history, & to past p/sales), I view ATMI as a decent bet
given my expectation of good future demand for semiconductors, ATMI's range of
customers, and ATMI's potential to not only expand with semi's general growth,
but their opportunity to enter new, ancillary markets, as with their optical
materials manufacturing. I acknowledge that ATMI is having its best year (sales
and earnings)& that Mr. Market may be saying that that performance may not be
sustainable.

Hi Paul, Jurgis,

I used to follow both TRID and SBLU (known then as SIII) as comparables to
another company in the PC graphics segment named Cirrus Logic. I might have
brought it up here at one time or another but I no longer think it qualifies as
a value play. I do think it is undervalued as a growth play having just
converted all of its debt to equity, cash on the balance sheet and growing
revenues. It is no longer in PC graphics but is now in audio and internet
devices (with older divisions in mass storage). Ironically, SBLU appears to be
following in Cirrus' footsteps after their competitive rivalry played a role in
Cirrus needing to restructure. TRID was always the weaker of the three.

If SBLU can manage the same type of turn around as Cirrus then it should be a
very profitable investment.

JMHO,

Paul,

I own some. It's been a loser for me and I wish I never had anything to do with
it.

I think the company has some serious and short term problems.

The company has missed its earnings estimate for 9 straight quarters. It's
being squeezed by higher fuel, gas, utility bills in CA, union wages and health
care costs etc... There are also lingering effects from a recent strike.

The problem is that every time they raise prices in order to offset costs, they
lose units. It's not clear to me why other companies in the industry are
handling the problem better, but I don't follow all the competitors. It could
be because IBC isn't just a food company. It's also a distributor. It may also
be a marketing issue???

Management has consistently missed the mark by far in its projections of costs
and the effects of price increases.

The union people think management is totally incompetent. I take that with a
grain of salt.

That's all the bad stuff.

The good news is that they haven't been part of the recent food frenzy by
overpaying for acquisitions. I think there's a lot to work with in terms of
assets, brands etc...

I also think Wall St has had it with this management team. I sensed that during
the conference call. I think a restructuring (partial or total sale of assets)
is likely in the future. It's cheap, but I would advise against it unless you
like to be tortured and have no other ideas. :-)

DCI vs. PLL. I'm in a similar conundrum (if that is the correct word) as
regards Masco vs. U.S. Industries. MAS by far, is the dominant, powerful,
well-respected player - a sometime growth company that's made its investors
lots of money over the years. MAS just looks to me to be the better company.

http://www.quicken.com/investments/seceval/?symbol=MAS+USI&cmetric=rev&cmetric=
gmt

MAS aggressively pursues the opportunities it sees (lots of acquisitions, imo),
and it's big and strong enough to get institutional interest. OTOH, USI is
selling at a low p/e, and they are making efforts to divest themselves of
non-core assets.
I am guessing that both companies are down because of similar reasons (building
suppliers out of favor, recession fears), but it's possible, maybe likely, that
MAS will see a rebound before 2nd tier (imo) USI does.

Still, USI sells below stated book with a low pe (for now anyway--I assume
there will be an earnings decline which will jack up that pe ratio). I'll
follow Bill Nygren of Oakmark Select Fund into USI now, and if MAS drops a bit
to near its lows, I'll consider it also.

Re: ANF

Bob: I've been holding ANF since last February. The consistent increases in
earnings and growth accomplished with clean debt free balance sheet is what
attracts me.

Of big concern is the negative same store sales growth. ANF was hammered
because of negative 8% comps for November. (AEOS had extremely good comps -- I
think 10% or 15% increase).

For whatever reason the market perceives ANF's negative comps as extremely bad.

I view the AEOS valuation as encouraging. In the past ANF traded at the same
multiples and traded within the last several weeks at nearly $32.00 per share
(around 20 times earnings). Perhaps ANF will trade at a similar value to AEOS
soon.

I loaded up the boat back in February, March and April and intend to hold on.

What do you make of the same store sales problem? It seems that decreased same
store sales would eventually translate into lower margin sales and lower
returns, although that hasn't happened to any noticeable extent despite nearly
a year of weak and lower same store sales.

Their history supports this. If it does this for 3 years and you tack a 25

gets you a 47% annualized return. Half that return would be decent. An
interesting aspect of the ANF brand that supports higher than commodity
