OT to Suma: FYI and fwiw, P.F. Changâ€™s China Bistro is giving a 15 percent
discount today, April 15, in honor of the income tax filing deadline.

Also McCormick & Schmick's:

"Get tax relief with selections from their 10.40 (edit: 1040 ha ha, clever)
entree menu or their famous bar food menu.

Also, every tax payer gets a $10.40 tax relief certificate to use on a future

Their stocks need a discount though for me to get interested.

What I am trying to do is avoid a big loss trying to read the tealeaves of the
short term price action. I realize that im going to get frequently whipsawed
but I think thats preferable to being blindsided. I also dont expect that I
will always read the tealeaves correctly. reviewing yesterdays price action I
thought it signalled a probable equity offering in the near future at sub $18
pricing. I have no idea what happened today. Perhaps they pulled the offering
when they realized that the government may be unlikely to grant them Tarp
repayment privledges. I dont really know. at the moment the stock looks pretty
good but that could change tomorrow.

re WFC - i think you are spot on that they will do an equity offering. There is
a big cash grab going on with REITs, MLPs and now financials. I do not think
that they will be able to repay TARP until much later. The near term question
is about the outcome of the bank stress test results and the detailed numbers
behind WFC earnings numbers (details so far are very sparse). Don't know how to
handicap either one, it's a pure gamble. hold it or fold it or buy deep out of
the money puts for protection if you are concerned about a big loss.

I would disagree about "pure gamble". despite what the shorts are saying I
would be surprised if their preannouncement turns out to be misleading. I cant
see anything positive to be gained by doing that except for benfitting call
owners at the expense of call sellers. Also longer term wfc will be generating
tons of profits. so the question The uncertainties are more about how much
money are they gonna lose over the next couple of years and how much dillution
will occur, and of course how much of toxic assets are the taxpayers going to
absorb in one way or another.
The government seems to be committed to propping up all the big banks and i
figure wells fargo is no worse than 3rd on the list after C and BAC. The
government has finally put some money into supporting loan modifications. i was
calling for that like a year ago but better late than never. I really think
that will do a lot to stabilize the real estate market. Now its just commercial

This boards's about finding value stocks. The idea being that if everybody here
had a chance or a couple of chances to review a stock to see if it was suitable
for them, then after that, for those that bought, they could continue following
and/or discussing the stock on a board devoted to that stock or group of stocks
(e.g. a board that followed restaurant stocks or a CMG board). With CMG
specifically, everyone here ought now to have made their decision how they view
CMG as an investment.

Well, no question that "It" is not a value stock, definitely a growth story.
Even though this is a value thread, we can learn from this. Former Fidelity

On TOT, it doesn't appear to be a value at this price, but they do have some
decent earnings estimates going forward. It also is approaching an area on the
chart where it continually has resisted further decline in the 43 area. However
overall I'm not crazy about the chart. The stock keeps knocking on the door
near lows, eventually the door opens up. The pattern looks crummy. Immediate
gap at 45.80 a likely candidate for fill. Stocks with billions of shares out
rarely leave unfilled gaps.

Rail shipments lately off a cliff, however ARII plows along at reduced
production rates. They did $1.47 in 2008, but estimates are much less this
year, I believe 15 cents.

At a 40% discount to tangible assets it seems to have good support in the
recent area of $6.80 or so, where she got some interest 3 times. This last
time, buying interest has been sharply higher. On watch, but I haven't bitten
(or been bitten) yet. Just a thought.

A couple of others that look interesting which I already own are NGPC, PNSN.
Both look good to me and PNSN is a good candidate to ultimately fill the
October gap - which is 20 to 30% higher and shown on the chart below. Value,
earnings, and positive technicals are a nice triple cocktail usually.

A few of interest are USAP, MTG, LAD ( nice pop yesterday ), PSEC and LIZ. I'd
probably wait for a pullback on LIZ though. I did take some SKS very recently
and almost kicked it out on yesterdays pop. High end retailer currently losings
gobs of money, but chart indications and balance sheet data still indicate
significant undervaluation even considering forward looking losses. And who
knows if management takes the right steps to cut costs and improve efficiency
going forward. It's always a possibility.

After all the chit chat on Ruby Tuesdays ( RT) I got to looking at TUES. Took
some at $1.38, and it's been a wild % gainer recently but still at a 60%
discount to tangible worth, so I'm thinking may be more room in it.

Based on market action in individual names in the low priced stocks, I'd say
the unlikely is the likely. They have just gotten too cheap in an environment
where the FED will print whatever it takes - unlimited. Money sloshing around
is a big driver for sure. Next could be pressure on fund managers from clients
complaining about why they are missing the rally. That could force fund
managers sitting on cash to deploy some of that money.

No add for me at this time to my small losing TOT position. (Also we have a
little TOT tucked into Pargesa as you know.)

I am not understanding the upward movement in integrated oil stocks, domestic
(USA) nat gas stocks or the Canadian oil/gas/sands stuff. Plus oil service
stocks are moving up as well. Maybe the worst (shut down of gas wells, reduced
cap expenditures) is already absorbed by the market.

I have decided to close some small positions in oil service stocks and reduce
exposure to nat gas companies where forward p/e's seem relatively high. Selling
DVN, NBL, WFT, CPX, BJS, others.

Looking at TOT brought me to Shell. Looking at RDSB now, that one does look
attractive to me.
Problems with Nigeria; large capital expenditures (oil sands, lng stuff) means
Shell might be needing high oil prices to make them pay. And with these big
integrateds, there's always the issue of can they even maintain their reserves.
Still, with RDSB's p/e and low stock price,

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=RDS-B&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

Grommit, It's really difficult to pick only 3 favorites when so many good
companies are still selling at distressed prices, even after a big move off the
S and P lows. Many bargains exist now, and many of the bargains now look better
for buying due to the current favorable market conditions.

If my hand were forced to pick 2 or 3, I would maybe go with DFT, LNY, and NM.
But you might be better off looking at a broader brush that includes SBLK,
NGPC, LIZ, SKS, PNSN, ULTR, TUES, MPW, CDII, RCKY, NUHC, and others.

Since I have about 460 stocks in my value watch list, my tendency is to watch
them and try to pick them off at opportune times. With so many to choose from,
being right even 75% of the time in a broader more diverse portfolio of these
types of small caps should outperform. But a great deal of that assessment is
dependent on market conditions remaining positive, or at least not negative. In
a negative environment all the value in the world won't help as we have seen in
the recent past. So for me, its all about the market. Even junk goes up in
favorable markets, sometimes more than the good stuff. But I still feel safer
knowing the stocks I'm in are selling at significant discounts. Chasing the
momentum stocks of overvalued companies like the IBD 100 etc. is not for me.
Neither is chasing the money losing overvalued companies just because they have
gone vertical. I sense danger in those approaches. But a momentum stock in a
vertical trajectory that is still selling at a 30% or better discounts to
tangible net worth that has positive earnings and high rates of growth
estimates going forward doesn't give me any heartburn. Someone asked which
groups to be in long term. However I don't think group think is the way to look
at the market. It was a while ago when the only out performers were energy and
commodities. But today I think its different, more broad, and undervalued is
undervalued, be it in retail, tech, energy, automotive related, financial,
eateries, or what have you.

Lets just hope this is not another bear market rally that gives way after 8-12
weeks.

"favorite picks" "most confidence". Too tough for me to relate these words to
buys. As I say, the ones I seem to have confidence in seem to do more poorly
than the ones I am not confident in. My favorite picks are either the ones I
have orders in to buy -- my latest buys are always my favorites (-g-)-- or the
ones I have just sold (which of course seem to move up after they are sold). In
short, my "favorite picks" and "most confident" are not the stocks in which I
have the largest positions.

Since you are a thread reader here, I'll move away from stocks which have been
mentioned here before that I am currently buying (and which therefore, are my
current favorites), such as ABT, EIX, RDSB.

Instead, I'll mention a couple of stocks that I have that I've not mentioned
previously or recently and which might be value stocks and which might interest
you.

I have a small position in
BioMed Realty Trust, 7.375% Series A Cumul Redeem Preferred Stock

I've read there's a chunk of money in the USA stimulus package for
biomed/biotech research and I am guessing even during a recession, such
research will proceed regardless. To me, this is a nice preferred to offset
other preferreds in someone's portfolio where the other pfd's are mostly/all of
bank stocks or the general types of reits (shopping centers/commercial
buildings/etc). I have accumulated my BMRPRA position at prices $14.80 and
below, so at current price of $14.80/sh. I will say it's still worth a
consideration.

http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker=BMRPRA&fq=D&ezd=1Q&index=4

I have been following Banco Latin America SA on-and-off here since 1998 when I
mentioned it in a discussion with Madharry (aside: Geez, Madharry, 1998! Eons
ago). I've recently reacquired a full position in
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BLX (<span style='font-size:11px'>LAST</span>:
12.62<span style='font-size:11px'> 4/17/2009 4:02:14 PM</span>) - one of the
few stocks in which I do have a full position. (Again: an analogy-- If I were a
big player at the dice table and plunked down more money and placed more bets
than anyone else playing, that does not mean I know what I am doing or that I
can predict winning dice rolls any better or any worse than anybody else. Bet
size is not a predictor of success there or here. For me anyway, in my
experience.)

Anyway with BLX you get a bank stock apparently doing good business (with no
toxics afaik) trading at $12.62 with tangible book value of $15.88/sh and div
yield of about 7%. This is a bet on the viability of trade among Latin American
(and USA) countries. I started acquiring shares at $13.57, more in $12 range,
and more as stock fell. I would be a buyer now if I didn't already have shares.
(Not recommending a buy to anyone; only suggesting you/others might look at it
to see if it fits what you might be looking for now.)

I have more ideas-- enough for tonight though.
==================================
I'll be looking at AES and its preferred AES-PC with a view to buying shares in
one or the other on Monday in an ira. Lots of factors to consider affecting
them differently - rising inflation, increasing interest rates, lower commodity
prices, rising commodity prices, regulatory changes, no div vs almost 10%, and
presumed length of holding the position (I'm guessing for me short-term, maybe
about five years). Anybody with an opinion to share on one vs. the other,
please post.

today to my losing position.

From Barron's latest:

"One of Berwyn Income's biggest holdings is American Equity Investment Life
(AEL), an annuity and life-insurance outfit. The managers started buying the
convertible 5.25% due Dec. 6, 2024, in early 2008, and kept buying through the
autumn. "We were able to buy AEL bonds at a yield to put in excess of 20%,"
says George Cipolloni, 34, who manages the fund with Killen.

The yield shot up after the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that
indexed annuities should be treated as securities, not insurance products. That
raised fears that the West Des Moines, Iowa-based company would have to spend
to retrain its staff, or hire new staff licensed to sell securities. Investors
also fretted about potential losses in the company's investment portfolio. Like
Berwyn, American Equity considered the bonds a steal. It bought back $78
million last fall of the $260 million issue, at about a 40% discount to the
original issue price. That bolstered its equity when other life insurers'
equity was eroding.

The fund's managers like the insurer so much that they bought its stock as
well, at about $3.87 a share. Shares now trade at about $5, versus their
52-week high of 11.63. Analysts think American Equity will earn $1.52 a share
in 2009 and $1.62 in 2010."

=====================

Stock is still below tangible book value, pays about 1%, and there have been a
few small insider buys.

$177 million, or 47 cents a share, from $291 million, or 76 cents, a year ago.
Revenue for the railroad fell 22% to $1.94 billion from $2.5 billion, with coal

Analysts polled by FactSet Research had, on average, expected the Norfolk,

re utilities - AEP may be worth a look. They issued some stock that is needed
to keep the rating since they are cash flow negative this year due toe heavy
investment. Still the metric look good. they own a lot of coal generating
capacity but most of it operates under a regulatory umbrella which means that
the expected cost increases from carbon caps should be a flow through item
assuming a fair (ha ha) regulatory process for rate increases.

Compare this is EIX where most coal plan are operated within the IPP part of
the EIX. The IPP' with coal plants could be really hurting due to more
competition from cheap NG and the carbon caps going forward. I am not saying
that AEP is better than EIX at this point. EIX regulatory part has gotten
decent treatment by regulators so far and they are supposed to make 2.4$ /share
this year and only 50c or so are coming from EIX IPP business. So the regulated
part is where EIX value lies, I think. Still AEP is worth a look in a basket of
utilities stocks (hopefully not a basketcase like so many of my recommendations
here).

Generally i agree that utilities look good but I'd be careful with IPP's or
diversified utilities with IPP components.

SUPERVALU INC (NYSE: SVU) nudged into my top ten holdings based on it's recent
move higher. PBR and GLW got pushed back to #11 and #10. I am still heavy
weighted with oil companies (CVX, ERF, COP, XOM) as they represent 53% of the
value in my top ten core holdings. 35% of my top ten are represented by basic
material resource and mining companies and 6% each in Technology (GLW) and
Retail (SVU).

Supervalu Inc. reports earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday 4/23.
The 50 DMA has been coming down and is now around $15.40. OBV has been moving
higher since it reached it's low on the sell off on 3/2/2009. Analysts surveyed
by Thomson Reuters expect the company to earn 79 cents per share on revenue of
$10.86 billion for the quarter.

I am looking at consolidating some of my other fifty positions to up my %
holdings in the Technology Sector. I currently have positions in MSFT, INTC,
NOK, HPQ, JAVA, VRGY, MOT, and GLW.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MSFT,INTC,NOK,HPQ,VRGY,MOT,GLW&d=s

It could be but in general, I find that these class action suits yield almost 0
to the complainers. When you buy common stock, you are taking a gamble. When
they lose, they file a lawsuit. If management announced the issue of past
accounting for trade credits when the audit committee was certain of its impact
on past reports, then they did nothing wrong. It's a question of when they
found out and how long it took them to audit years of records.

In my view, I only care about going forward. The past 2007 and 3 quarters of
2008 mean little to me unless they would cost the Co $3 a share in tangible
book value adjustment.

I do view this and most of my holdings as trades though, not long term

up further. There is probably some short covering going on. Also FWIW, but I
checked, and see there are no shares available to short from my broker (Fido)
for PFCB PNRA and CMG. I suppose that could be seen as less selling power
available to potentially knock the stocks down.
Of the ones we have mentioned, it seems that just about only CMG isn't at or
near a 52 week high. From that perspective, I guess one could make an argument
it has more room to run than the others. I just can't pull the trigger on a 30+

If restaurant stocks hold up at current levels, I assume it's because people
believe sales will hold or improve (if I assume it's not about future
consolidation in the sector, or that commodity prices are falling such that if
rev's decline, costs decline faster, so there's still good restaurant profits).
Well if it is sales, then SYY is still attractive imo. As the biggest purveyor
or food and stuff to restaurants, it would have to benefit. Selling at p/e 12
now, often above 20x in better economic times, high roe, rising div's past more
than 35 years, yield now about 4.4% - I am holding my shares.

-g- Of course if somebody prefers to buy stocks based on their gut feeling and
gut stomach (where they go to eat) and so just sees what they look at on the
surface or follows stock price uptrends, it's possibly not a stock of interest.

Possibly and I defer to your moderator status and also
that you are a savvy investor. And by the way I have not bought on GUT feelings
although I probably would have done had I reacted to that feeling.

Lynch used to say and it was his maxim for investing. BUY what you like. Buy
what you use. Buy the stock that you have
confidence in because you like their product.

I happen to like PNRA and CMG as food to eat. Both are superior to some other
restaurants that I eat in. However, I do have a very touchy digestion problem
and have to be extremely careful WHAT I eat. IBS is my problem boarding on
Chrone's disease.

NO fried food and palatable food. Now the other day at PNRA's the girl
recommended.....chicken vegetable with rice and
a grilled chicken breast on whole wheat bread with an apple.
I ate that meal. It gave me no problems and it was healthy.

Tonight we go to Chipolte's where all the meat is organic.
One choose what spices to have put on one's meal. I
usually eat the bowl which has black beans,rice and
some organic pork pieces. I forgot the spicy salsa and
have simple tomato. I have a little sour cream and a lot of
lettuce... Some little.... one dictates the amount of
guacamole.... Those I am with have a lot more on their
plate that I am precluded from eating.

So those are why these restaurants are agreeable to me and
my gut.

As far as why the price keeps going up I dunno. I am not
a savvy investor. But I do not buy on gut feelings....
That is why I don't own either stock. I brought these two the board way back as
I do believe in the product but
both are astronomically high right now.

MCD is another place I can eat. Their ice cream... soft stuff
is not dairy. It is probably some inferior product but
I can eat it whereas I cannot eat good ice cream such as
Ben and Jerry's and other fine brands. I also drink their
new coffees and a friend who suffers with the same health problem as I do says
their chicken breast chicken agrees
with her.

Maybe I should start a restaurant thread.(G) I cannot eat Buffalo Wings... (:}

Electric Utility. Decided I like SO. Size, customer base, geographical
diversity. Dividend yield which is now increased for the eighth straight year
(about 5.9% yield). I can't see myself ever paying a 15 p/e for a utility
(exception: water utilities), and even now with a p/e of 12-13, that is to me,
uncomfortably high (almost growth-stockish). OTOH though, p/bk for SO is 1.7,
and the stock over the past ten years has mostly traded over 2x book. Book
value generally increasing only very slowly, if at all (as is typical with many
utilities).

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1y&s=SO&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=fpl

This stock, similar to many utilities I presume, trades in a narrow band.
Although the stock is down now in these troubled times, it hasn't fallen as
much as so many other stocks. And if/when the market improves, I won't expect
there be that much of a rise with SO either (I mean within the next few years.
Over the very long haul this stock has moved up and may continue to do so:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=SO&t=my&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

Still trying to up my exposure to commodities while they seem to be quiescent.
ADM down today: I have stub position which I've doubled up on today while I
consider if I want to build a position:

Relatively low p/b, low p/sales, current and forward p/e under 10 which
historically (past 10 years) is low for ADM. A Standard & Poor's Dividend
Aristocrat, ADM's yield is about 2.3%.

No compelling reason to buy this stock now -- there are so many, almost too
many, companies with characteristics as described in the previous two
sentences. And it doesn't help that the WSJ published a 4/15 article on Cargill
about which they began, "Cargill Inc. posted a 68% decline in its fiscal

I like Pauls approach to buy a basked of utility stocks. They are in fact
undervalued as a group (IMO) relative to the market, have less risk to a
failing economy and good upside. In fact many steady-Eddy stocks are still

Water utilities: Adding AWK to my holdings with a small buy now.

I have now: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WTR,CWT,AWR,PICO,MWA,VE,HOO,AWK&d=s

Positive AWK article here:

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Investing-in-Water-Utilities-twst-14997763.html?.
=1

Snippets:

"...the retail clients love water utility stocks because they are low risk,
because they pay a dividend, because they tend to raise their dividends every
year. And then the whole concept of water gives them confidence that they're
investing in something that's long-term sustainable." ===== I am somewhat
concerned that I am in this category and since so many others are in as well,
it is perhaps more risky than we blithely (?) assume.

"I think American Water Works looks very compelling at these prices. It trades
at 12.5 times 2010 numbers and 118% of book value versus the group, which is at
17 times forward numbers and 175% of book, so on a valuation perspective, it's
very, very attractive. The fundamentals of AWK are just as strong, and one
could argue stronger, than some of the others in the group, given that they are
in the process of filing rate increases for the neglected systems from the RWE
ownership days. So there is going to be some accelerated earnings growth over
the next couple of years. But over the long term, given their size, their
expertise, they're going to be one of the biggest consolidators and they're
going to be able to exploit the infrastructure needs of the country. So I think
that one is very attractive."
