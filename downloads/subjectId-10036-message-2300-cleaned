John,

OXHP seems to be a steel, i'm watching it for a few days now. The day it
crashed i heard a second-hand rumour (sorry!!): allegedly a broker said their
bookkeeping is "creative". Most likely this is not true, but maybe it's one of
the reasons for this spectacular crash.

I worked in the group health insurance business for nearly 30 years, including
work with HMO's (although I am not as close to it now as I used to be). The
health insurance business tends to run in several year cycles - of lean years
and tough years. A number of HMOs have been having earnings difficulties.
Enough that I have casually concluded that times are now tougher generally. It
is a tough problem to change quickly since there are usually one year price
guarantees.

Because of the exposure to government that most HMOs have, I have sort of
thought that they might eventually end up looking a bit like public utilities.

Because of the above I have felt that the industry's best days in the stock
market might be behind it and advising friends not to invest in the industry. I
would be even more careful about investing in a company in that industry that
seems to have additional serious special problems.

Mike,

I found that ROC had dropped to 11.75 or 20% against a 30% drop in the TWII.
The Taiwanese market has dropped in sympathy to Asia markets and not due to
weakness in Taiwan economy. The Taiwan dollar is also tied to the $US but they
haven't had the inflation of HongKong that's caused the current problems.

IMO - The TWII has moved up and should show recovery faster than the other
markets with very little weakening of the Taiwan currency. At least that seems
to be the general consensus of the material I've been reading. I've bought as a
market play. Picked up at 8-5/8 and it's up to 8-3/4 and moved off the 8-3/4
ask to 8-7/8. Will likely trade according to the TWII.

A possible 25-40% short term gainer with (IMO) minimal downside,

The falloff in overseas markets present better buys than US stocks after the
recent "correction". In many cases, the weaker currency would actually improve
the companies profit potential while for others the fall off is justified. (If
Taiwan currency weakens, ROC fund will decline sharply.) There's excellent buys
outside US, but we have to be careful of what we are buying.

For what it's worth,
Ron

that they will spend the $30 dollars/sh on something the market does not like,

Some education Victor got in one day last week. (Apparently $150,000,000 worth

I find that I am surprised still that supposedly sharp and savy guys can go

Still, for value investors with no or little margin debt, they should be okay -
that has been the case in the past anyway.

Terra Nitrogen certainly is interesting, but it seems all dependent

S.A. Smith: re BKS (Barnes and Noble): Right. It's not a "true" value. But it
is a "value" in a least two ways. First, it's down from its highs. So
"relatively" speaking, buyers now get a better price than buyers just a few
trading sessions ago. Secondly, when you compare BKS to what appears to be
their main competitor, BKS finance ratios look much better, once again in this
relative way. (Ignoring the possibility that Amazon might be way overvalued,
that the book business is generally very tough (low margin), very competitive,
and that sales can be(?) misleading (some consignment stuff by publishers).
I think anyone who convinces himself/herself that such relatively priced and
relatively valued stocks are ergo, relative buys, and then actually buys on
that basis - that person takes great risks (the relativeness of the thing
appears to soften the danger --- but that danger is there -g-)
Sir or Madam: you come to the value thread already knowing that BKS is not a
value stock; you might find more significant information by asking your BKS

I was wrong. The Taiwan $ is no longer tied to US but it free floating with

very interesting reading. Great location at:

John <<OXHP seems to be a steel ...>> Why do you say that? As an ex-OXHP s/h I
read the signals correctly and got out in time to net a nice profit: 1) many
HMO's (perhaps most) were under extreme cost pressures; 2) OXHP's accounting
system was inadequate to track it's expenses and payables; 3) There was heavy
insider selling following last quarter's earnings report. I interpreted this to
mean that much of OXHP's earnings were an illusion. Pending an audit of OXHP's
books there is no fundamental basis on which to judge this company. A valuation
at this point is impossible IMO.

OXHP had to make its announcement on 'grey monday', one might think wallstreet
reaction was clearly overdone. Many daytraders waited for a bounce during the
day when they bought around $30. The press release by no means justified a 63%
decrease.
That's why i said it "seems to be a steal". I didn't say it is a steel, because
i heard the rumor about agressive accounting and impact on former results right
after opening. Maybe it's just my poor english.
Congrats if you read the signals correctly. Analysts obviously didn't.

BTW, i disagree with your view about insider selling in generall. I wouldn't
expect a smart management to sell their stock at the lows. Insider selling when
the stock is down, that makes me think (see ASND)

OXHP debacle to attach any meaningful valuation to the stock. The markets may
have under-estimated the impact of the release -- we simply don't know, and
prudence dictates that I take a wait and see attitude.

On the plus side, it looks like there will be several years of 5% premium
growth. Whether this is sufficient to restore OXHP to profitability remains to
be seen. If it looks like OXHP can get it's costs under control I will

<<3) There was heavy insider selling following last quarter's earnings report.

Hi Paul:
I really do believe that OXHP is getting a bad rap on this one item. Take a
look at the specific insider activity and how much of it was option related; as
well, how the exercise of options in some cases did not result in a full
liquidation of positions; how this activity did not stand out apart from the
1996 activity. I am going on my recollection of the specifics as I looked at
them last week. If you like, I will dig up the specifics and post all the
activity that occurred this year. As I recall, it was not massive as some in
the financial press would have you believe.
I came to look at this stock last week because I am familiar with Steve Wiggins
through a third party. I am led to believe that he is not one to tolerate the
sort of "below the table" management activity that folks are accusing them of
right now.
In the heat of both the drubbing that the stock took on Monday and the
embarrassment from the expose' of the mishandling of the changeover to new
accounting computer systems, Wiggins steps up and says earnings should fall in
the 1.75 to 1.90 per share range in 1998. With shareholder lawsuits coming out
of his ears right now, I'd guess that he would have to be pretty conservative
on this number.

Caveat on the above: I am only half way through a full research of the merits
of this company as an investment.

tough to make a profit with these stocks. But yet... we've got people on this
thread who've locked in good dough with WHX (possibly though a special

a favorable report by Lehman on LTV. Lehman says LTV may actually be overfunded
on their pension liabilities (note: this IMO depends on what I call the
investment rate %, and it's subject to gameplaying by mgmt, again IMO) -- this
takes some pressure off the company finances.
My history is that I try to select the best values I see. Usually this means I

However, note that my basic thesis is that most investors have no

Re: "the risk is that they will spend the $30 dollars/sh on something the
market does not like, and then...not only does the safety margin disappear, but
also the stock plummets." JMO.

From the 1996 annual report: "Vigilance will be exercized in seeking
acquisition prospects, while recognizing that in the absence of a profound
reversal in attitudes by sellers and buyers alike, the closing of an acceptable
transaction remains unlikely."

After reading the 1996 annual report, I have great respect for the management
of National Presto. In contrast to the "glowing" reports one commonly reads,
National Presto's is extremely cautionary, almost to the point of negativism.
For example, "...disappointing occasions far exceeded rare moments of
celebration....degrees of acceptance ranging from indifference to total failure
of three new products introduced in 1996, each of which was regarded by
management, prior to market entry, as important....a logical conclusion
projects the industry continuing to be troubled, embattled, and under siege."

Yet, today, National Presto reported $.48 versus $.38 last year. Since cash in
the till hasn't changed, I must assume they found a way to squeeze more profit
out of their "tired" product line. No less a value investor than Martin Whitman
lists it as an investment for his private clients. I believe a careful analysis
reveals a well run business, with loads of cash, paying almost a 5% dividend.

Brad, the answer really depends on alternate investments available to you.
Calculate the risk-return on an alternate investment and compare that to the
expected forward return on FPR. In the next seven weeks you expect to earn
3.704%. If you anualize this (1.0374^(52/7)-1) you get 31% per annum. I've
assumed seven weeks left for the time horizon.

BTW, you underestimated the original return. Annualized it was actually 55.2%.
It should be calculated as follows (1.076^(6)-1).

best positioned HMO (after PacifiCare). Which means if they can run their
computers they will make money and if they can't, anybody who can is visiting
their investment banker this week to prepare a hostile bid. Scanning the
analyst reports today was stunning. Only a couple of analysts who had buys on
the company at 75 had the guts to say its still a buy at 25. Most of them are
shellshocked, which is the best buy signal you can get. Tomorrow the company
has its conference call and earnings release and everybody is on "Hold" until
then because they don't want to look stupid. If you are going to buy this one,
do it before the call. I have no idea what they are going to say on the call,
but the psychology of this one tells me that as soon as the analysts have a
number they will be more comfortable. This could easily go up 30% from 25 in

Hi Paul, you wrote......
<<Have read a favorable report by Lehman on LTV. Lehman says LTV may actually
be overfunded on their pension liabilities (note: this IMO depends on what I
call the investment rate %, and it's subject to gameplaying by mgmt, again IMO)
--this takes some pressure off the company finances.>>

I assume that you are either talking about the "discount rate" applied to
pension benefit funding or to the "projected rate of return" in funding a plan.
Both fall within FASB Statement No. 87 which establishes guidelines for
actuarial setting of maximum and minimum rates. Basically, the days of
monkeying around with your pension plan in relation to assisting your corporate
earnings are long gone.

But you are correct that there is leeway in a corporation being able to raise
the plan's "discount rate" as well as raise the plan's "projected rate of
return" in order to reduce the contribution for the current year(and succeeding
years) and thus increase earnings and cash flow. However, erratic changing of
rates is certainly not in the spirit of the rules set forth by FASB and would
probably not get past the actuary nor past the auditors to a standard
unqualified opinion on the 10-K.

As far as the status of a pension being "overfunded", such overfunding is
amortized over the average lives of the plan participants. So the push to
earnings may not be as great as you might expect; and even less so when taken
in conjunction with the limited range the above mentioned rates are allowed to
fluctuate. (BTW, I have not reviewed the financials for LTV.) Hope this helps.

It is almost impossible and it seems the company itself is not in control of it
- which happens far too often in the health insurance business. It
often is a matter of actuarial judgment as to the liabilities which should be
set up for unpaid claims - and these really can swing the bottom line around.
There often can be, and are, honest differences of opinion on the liabilities
which should be established

Furthermore, on banks and insurance companies generally, the net worth is
usually only a small percent (like 5%) of the liabilities, which means that you
have to really understand what the assets are invested in - which is also often
impossible to do. Poor quality (real estate) assets is why the S&L business
went down the tubes 10 years ago.

It is difficult. You have to evaluate it like any other company, but with more
attention to macro trends that could affect the industry, since the margin for

Paul (and thread)

I took at look at the MarketPlayer site last week (recommended here I believe).
They had the results of a "Warren Buffet screen" that was better than most
since it identified Dairy Queen as a potential investment, and Buffet bought
it.

That's a long intro to the following. I spent several hours checking each of
the 16 companies listed and found 1 that I am very interested in. The comapny
is NCI Building Systems, the ticker is BLDG and, did you guess?, they build
steel houses (and other buildings).

I wanted to put a good case together for this thread and the Super Stocks
thread but your comment is too inviting.

BLDG
Makes steel buildings including houses but mostly industrial.
PSR 0.8
LTD 1.5%
ROE 25%
PE 11 backwards, 9 forwards
Average annual return over past 5 years (compunded) - 41%
(has gone from $6 to $36 in 5 years)
Low PE on forward 12 months earnings estimates - 7.5
High PE on forward 12 months earnings estimates - 11.5

The PEs of 7.5 and 11.5 translate into prices of $29 and $44 based on estimates
for next 12 months. The companies earnings have been very stable. THey
continually acquire smaller businesses and do it without issuing stock or
incurring debt. Good cash flow.

I haven't bought because I am fully invested, but it is on my short list for
purchase as soon as I sell something else.

hundred); and for conservative investors, I'd bet anyone who owned a package of

They are positioned well for the future with respect to pension

20% job cuts, 10% share buyback in only one quarter, and
we're heading into the first full production quarter. As they
re-establish business ties and reconnect sales channels, the
profits will come, and we already know about the balance sheet.

Brad, the equations are different, and I believe mine to be correct. The point
behind mine is that you must look at the compounded interest rate -- not the
simple interest rate. When you are dealing with short time frames the
difference is quite substantial. For example, suppose you are calculating the
returns of two investments the first one yielding 26% in six months and the
second yielding 1% in a week. On a simple interest basis each will yield an
annualized return of 52%. But on a compounded basis the first will yield 58.8%,
while the second will yield 67.8% annualized.

The second point is that risk analysis is essential. From your comments on PFR
I gather that it is a risk-free investment, and I've assumed that your time for
receiving cash is correct. So, to compare that investment to others you should
be looking at short-term risk-free opportunities only -- like T-bills, CD's and
very short maturity corporate bonds.

You are right. There was no rally. The market is weaker than it was in the
earlier correction this year. Good example is NH. Posted a 55% increase in
earnings, 26% over estimates, and it barely moves. A month ago it would have
caused at least a 10% increase in price. Can give you a dozen similar cases.

Every increase in price brings sellers, what buyers there are look for bargains
and don't really care if the buy goes thru. You will have to change your

Interesting article in the Nov 3rd Forbes, which actually came
out before the market turned upside down. One of the columnists
outlines how the market is high , and proposes that Asia will
bring the markets down by way of their currency crisis introducing a
deflationary economy to the U.S. Part of his prediction has come
to pass - the decoupling of bonds and stocks by way of the threat
of a deflationary economy. He ends by noting how traditionally right
people like Buffett bought bonds at the first signs of the Asian
crisis.

If what he says comes to pass, for the first time in thirty
years bonds will no longer follow stocks and vice versa. The fear
of inflation, a phenomenon of the last 30 years, will be replaced
by a fear of deflation, which makes the relationship between bonds
and stocks the opposite of what we've been used to.

Value investors are always aware of the real return offered by bonds,
as they are the true alternative to stocks. In a deflationary
economy, add the deflation number to the yield and the potential
capital appreciation -- bonds would do very well.

Just something to think about.

Paul, thank you for your observations. I was finessing the all-important
compounding element because I was assuming the end-point (gain) was fixed. The
imputed interest rate would relate to length of time holding this position with
a possible blend from a switch to another "risk-free" position.

As you know this sort of thing is never risk-free. This one's as close as they
come, but things happen(?) The time I set because the tax change driving it
occurs Jan 1.

As you might have gathered I am lazy, so if I can get someone else to do my
calculations, great! On the other hand, I have transmitted several things to

so has the market in general -> the blind squirrel finds a nut<- Question is,
who is blind? Actually, my real value stuff hardly budged on this down draft.
The volume simply disappeared.

So my conundrum is that I construct a private market value - buy when below,
then when to sell? Frequently these are not super companies, just undervalued
ones. I guess if I were bold enough to run fully invested, it would be no
problem - just value each daily, and kick out the worst when something new
comes along. Not being bold enough, I simply raised arbitrary % of cash over

However, there is a much greater distance from here to zero on short term

Mike,

I've thought of Buffet many times over the past week. Uncanny how the man can
make the right moves. He's had at least 20% growth in bonds!!

I don't believe investors will continue to hold bonds as most are unwilling to
accept the low return. The low rates give opportunity to business and IMO we'll
see fewer IPOs and stock issues in favor of long term borrowing. Low interest
rates can be expected for many years to come with retirees seeking safe income
based investments.

Again, IMO, this market decline is running into the seasonal sell off discussed
earlier. We could be seeing even lower levels as the funds and others shift
positions in preparation for year end reports. Jumping in on what seems to be
good buys at this time may not be the thing to do.

TRAPS IN THE BARGAIN BASEMENT

Some excerpts from an article this A.M. on TheStreet.com:

At a breakfast in New York on Tuesday at the 11th annual Legg

under the value label said wild swings in stock prices can snag
unwary investors looking for a one-day sale.

William Miller, manager of the Legg Mason Value fund,
identified what he sees as traps in the bargain basement: basic
cyclicals like paper and steel. Boston Partners' Mark Donovan
says the technology sector is fraught with value traps. Ditto, the
big airlines, which Donovan called a "crummy business." Ark

singled out Pan Am (PAA:NYSE) as a particular black hole for
bargain hunters, and Jeffrey Ubben, managing director at
Richard C. Blum & Associates, says to look out for the HMOs.
"I see no added value in these big-cap stocks."

When asked about current out-of-favors, Oxford Health Plans

If something unexplainable happens blame El Nino.

Fla beats Cle - El Nino

Wallace,

> As to Fila, another positive would be a large presence
> and continued sales growth overseas.

In my opinion this a positive for NKE too, so
I am not sure it's an advantage of Fila.

HYDEA - does the company care about shareholders?
The price action in the last four years says no.
Two classes of shares confirms my negative sentiment.

I am not arguing that HYDEA has much lower PSR
than NKE. But I am wondering whether that is outweighed
by what companies are doing to improve shareholder
value. I don't know whether you guys followed RBK, but
its CEO totally compromised my willingness to invest in that
company by his inconsistent strategy. I wonder how much
of that can be expected from HYDEA.

Diclosure: No positions right now, but
contemplating buying NKE one of these days.

Good luck

> FLH - positive: low P/E, negative: foreign stock, no info.

I've been waiting on this one for a while. Management said in first quarter
(May) PR that they didn't see a turn around in U.S. sales around till after
Nov. (because of new B-Ball shoe intro). U.S. sales very dependant on B-Ball
shoe sales.

Book value around $15 (neglible intangibles), so it's trading at a P/B of 1.7
or so. Has traded traditionally with P/B around 3. Current ratio just under to
2. Cash+Equiv+AR to Current liabilities just under one. I have some concern
over growing inventories and long-term debt, but management has been candid
about order cancellations, etc.

Hurt on some EPS comparisons because of currency drop (>10% vs. last year for
Italian lire).

Continuing large growth in sales outside U.S. even during the current
slump. In U.S., sales started slumping after the beginning of this year. The
P/E is quite deceptive as a buying indicator since EPS for the last couple
quarters has been much than last year ($0.64 vs. $1.61
for latest quarter, $0.56 vs. $0.98 for previous). If the current trend in
earnings does not change substantially, I'd be surprised if they make $3 this
year, more likely $2.40 to $2.65. Their fourth
quarter is usually very weak ($0.44 last year) and they've made
$2.18 so far this year.

You can call the firm handling Fila's U.S. investor relations and ask for an
investor pack: Dewe Rogerson (212) 688-6840. I got this number from a quarterly
PR I found at their web site:

http://www.fila.com/about.html

Can't figure out why it's up today by such a large amount today. I am
looking to buy below 21 between now and December.

Just to give you another opinion on HYDEA

positive: cheap!

negative: negative growth, marketing

I wish they would take Adidas philopsopy because they are the hottest thing
around, but yet most of their shoes are unappealing. Once you get everyone
buying the shoes, the rest falls in place, i.e. t-shirts, hats, bags, etc.

Thank you S.A. Smith. It is amazing to check out the stocks you mentioned. The
number is real and the details are very complicated. KREN look like is being
eaten by the investors. paid 70 cents of a 50 cents stock? It is really
amazing. Remind me of Warren Buffet treating his cash cows. I need to spend a
lot more time to analyze the situation. I will let you know if I made a
conclusion. Thanks again for your ideas. Did you use any program search to get
these?

Best, Steve

Don't thank me too soon. See post #2344 responding to me. Apparently KREN is in
turmoil and RAY is in bankruptcy with potential liability lawsuits pending...
I ran a screen to come up with these. The devil is apparently in the
details...Guess I need to find some better research sites.
Any suggestions?

Ron - Buffett is great but not quite as great as you mention. Based on rumors,
he probably established his bond position at about 6.5% on the long bond, which
would give him a capital gain of about 4% today.

Mike,

Had CREAF last Spring and sold when the runup hit my value target. Thanks for
making me take another look at it. I had seen the price going up and didn't
realize it had been lagging behind value. If it weren't for the current SE Asia
scare the price would be near 40.

Look forward to your article. Will it have the earnings report date?

Thanx,
Ron
PS You should have gotten the ROC, up 17.5% in 3 days.

I think their time has come...
Beazer Homes BZH..Undervalued homebuilder,
1.Just announced pos earning surprise yday
2.Trades under book(buying back shares)land assets probably undervalued
3.P/Sr well under industry average at 0.15
4.If it can maintain its earnings will trade at a P/E of approx 6.
5. Good growth, came from nowhere in last 5 yrs to be 7th largest home
builder in USA..
6. management well regarded(pres is/was head of homebuilders association)

I have owned the convertible preferred for some time...

The only negative was one bad quarter in 97 when they ran into some tble with
their Nevada operation, this seems behind them.

Here's the article: http://investor.msn.com

Looking to get into Asia maybe tomorrow. If Telebras
falls though, I'll spend my money there. I here
the Asian markets are falling pretty steeply, so
there may be some significant bargains.

Mike,

Excellent article.

Found the earnings report. They've been making so many press releases it was
too far back on first look. Impressive.

I also decided to wait and see what happened in Asian markets and am certainly
glad I did. Likely will not buy today and may miss an opportunity, but I feel
there's more volatility to come out of Asia over next few weeks. Any negative
causes a major drop and a corresponding drop in the other markets.

IMO - CREAF is a decent value at current price, but likely can be bought
cheaper.

For what it's worth,
Ron
PS Got out of the ROC at right time. Will buy again if it drops to 8.5 range.
Taiwan economy too strong for it to stay there.

Hyde Athletics reports earnings

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/97/11/07/hydea_hyd_1.html

That they are growing sales when other shoe companies are
floundering is a testament to me sublime power of the Saucony
brand. To be growing sales at a 24% clip, have a tiny PSR,
and be a net-net, this has to be a stock value investors would
love. The only problem is management, but they seem to be
doing a better job, and I like the way they are refocusing.
I'll add more if the price dips, but it doesn't look like it
will. Instead, the stock simply doesn't trade on bad days
for the market.

Good Investing,
Mike

Actually, I just went ahead and bought more Hyde,
paying $5/share. At $5, the market cap is $31M, but
its net net value is $37M. I do believe it is worth at least
6 on the minimum. With growing revenues and the
management's new focus, it has the potential either
to be worth more or to be acquired by some firm with
more marketing expertise.

Good Investing,
Mike
