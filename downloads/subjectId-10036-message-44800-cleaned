(It's apparent to me what patterns we see depend on the time scale.)

Yes, time scale is appropriate and you can even use daily charts, or hourly or
even minute depending on your style of trading.

And what's the rationale/theory behind it?

Look for the simple trend. Is the stock, index or whatever going up, down or
moving sideways.

Is 3-6 months the right time scale when one looks at the charts?

For a value investor, it could be. If you see a stock that you are interested
in from a value perspective and it hit a trend low with volume, this may be an
excellent point to purchase.

EK was an excellent example earlier this week. But maybe that was just for
daytrading. Buying at that bottom was a great opportunity there, but what the
participants in this thread have in their tool chest affords an opportunity to
use technicals to find good buying opportunities and value analyses to find
stocks worth buying when the technicals are wrong.

Picked up nice chunk of shares of ROC at 30.70 today.

Here's some of my past research:

Polypore, Albemarle Lead Specialty Chemical Rebound

By JASON MA, IBD June 17, 2011

Polypore's membranes are key components in lithium ion batteries, which power
hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles (Chevy Volt pictured). A few years ago, a
handful of analysts forecast long-term declines in the U.S. petrochemical
sector as new capacity in Asia and the Middle East challenged the industry's
competitive verve.

But fortunes have turned. On June 6, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) announced plans
for its chemical division to build a "world class" ethylene refinery in the
Northeast. In April, Dow Chemical (DOW) said it planned a similar facility for
the Gulf Coast, and would restart idled ethylene plants in Louisiana and Texas.
A joint petrochemical venture between Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP)
plans an equally ambitious Gulf Coast facility.

Estimated to cost more than $1 billion each, the projects are just one among
many signals that the global chemical trade is rebounding hard from its 2008-09
slump, and that the U.S. segment figures prominently in the bounce. The most
profitable corner of the industry, specialty chemicals, is showing particular
strength. Specialty chemicals makers are raising prices, almost across the
board, in the face of rebounding industrial demand and rising raw materials
costs.

One example: Naphtha, a key chemical feedstock, averaged $525 a metric ton in
2009, $710 last year and passed $1,000 in April.

Pricier raw materials were one reason Dallas-based Kronos Worldwide (KRO)
raised prices on its titanium dioxide pigments, used in coatings, plastics and
paper, in May for the second time in several months.

Earlier, peer Rockwood (ROC) raised pigment prices by up to 10%, citing "the
rapid increase of ocean freight, raw material costs and energy prices."
Albemarle (ALB) boosted the price of certain flame retardants 3 times since
Feb.

But the industry is also seeing wider margins in some areas, as a broad range
of natural-gas-related feedstocks have fallen in price, due to the recent
surfeit of natural gas supplies.

Those supplies lifted U.S. ethane production by 25% in 2010, "providing a
significant feedstock cost advantage for U.S. petrochemical manufacturers,"
said Stephen Pryor, president of Exxon Mobil's (XOM) chemical division, at a
gathering of analysts in March.

Despite the price increases, manufacturers and industrial buyers haven't yet
started to push back, said Michael Sison, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital
Markets. Sales volumes have been growing in the mid to high-single-digit
percentage range, lifting profits despite the price hikes. "People are aware of
the (price) pressures," Sison said. "It makes increases more palatable."

1.Business

The sector encompasses a wide range of companies. Praxair (PX) manufactures and
distributes industrial gases. Solutia (SOA) makes specialty coatings. Polypore
International (PPO) makes filtration membranes. Sigma Aldrich (SIAL) makes
chemicals used in genetic research.

The industry differs from the basic chemicals trade, which produces
commoditized chemicals and materials in much larger quantities. Specialized
chemicals also have unique handling and transportation requirements. Many
chemical makers offer a portfolio of services to support those needs.

Praxair, for example, provides pipeline and storage tank services that include
cleaning, purging, leak detection and hydrotesting.

The value of such services can be as much as the value of the chemicals
themselves, said Ray Will, principal analyst with IHS Global Insight's SRI
Consulting.

The result helps further expand profit margins for specialty chemical companies
beyond those of the basic chemicals sector, he added. Those profits are, in
turn, attracting fresh interest as specialty and basic chemical companies
compete for market share. In 2009, Dow (DOW) bought specialty coatings firm
Rohm & Haas for $15 billion. DuPont (DD) is closing in on a $6.6 billion
takeover of ingredients and enzymes maker Danisco.

Late last month, Ashland (ASH) agreed to buy International Specialty Products
for $3.2 billion in cash.

Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) also grabbed a piece of the action,
buying lubricant maker Lubrizol (LZ) for $9 billion. Such consolidation is
reinforcing the industry's already-high barriers to entry.

• Name of the Game: Manufacturers can keep margins up by further specializing
their chemical products and offering unique services. Companies must stay ahead
of regulations and shifting preferences that favor more environmentally
friendly formulations.

2.Market

Specialty, or performance chemicals are generally produced in lower volumes
than basic chemicals. End markets include electronics, wastewater management,
oilfield services, flavor and fragrance design, rubber processing, papermaking
and solar panels.

The definition of specialty chemicals varies. So do estimates for the size of
the industry. Larry Sloan, chief executive of the Society of Chemical
Manufacturers and Affiliates, gauged the market at $400 billion to $650
billion, depending on what types of companies were included.

The higher-growth areas: chemicals used in electronics manufacturing, auto
emission control, cosmetics and so-called nutriceuticals, especially in
developing markets like China and India, he said. "There are specific sweet
spots we're finding," he added.

Those sweet spots helped boost global specialty chemical output 7.5% in 2010
compared with 2009. It is expected to rise 5.9% in 2011, according to
projections from the American Chemistry Council, with U.S. production seen
lagging that of developing countries.

Also, specialty chemical makers are generally less prone to cyclical downturns
than commodity chemical companies, said Will. For example, output of customized
chemicals, which generally are made in batches, is easier to scale down.
Producers of commoditized products rely more on large-scale plants running
nonstop just to maintain their thinner margins.

3.Climate

Specialty chemicals may be getting a tad greener, as industrial customers
demand compounds to help them use fewer resources and foster a better
environmental image, Sloan said. Chemical makers also anticipate the U.S. will
follow Europe's lead in adopting stricter environmental regulations. Many
companies are trying to get ahead of the curve, Will said, with some already
responding to tighter European rules. "There is pressure to reformulate to
adapt to regulations," Will said.

Another sweet spot: Demand is rising for chemical products derived from sugars
and other renewable sources to avoid paying for petroleum and natural gas
feedstocks, Sloan said.

But just as the pressure toward new chemical formulations is increasing, the
industry has been forced to pare spending on research and development to cut
costs. In addition, companies are lobbying hard against legislative proposals
to regulate chemical safety in ways that some see as potentially threatening to
innovation.

4.Technology

The specialty chemicals sector hasn't hit a real, technological home run
recently, said Sison. Instead, advances tend to come in increments. "They're
mostly singles and doubles," he explained.

The pace of technological growth may stay that way. Mergers often take place as
a means to acquire new products, rather than develop them in house. But after
companies merge, research departments get cut — a convenient way to maintain
profit margins.

W.R. Grace's R&D spending fell to $60.3 million in 2010 from $70.1 million the
year earlier. Albemarle's expenses edged down to $58.4 million in 2010 from
$60.9 million.

Will said cutting research dollars after an acquisition is a pattern,
especially among producers of lower-margin chemicals. "I really can't spin a
happy picture of R&D," he said. "We've seen a declining trend."

Some makers of higher-end products, however, are boosting research. Solutia and
Sigma-Aldrich slightly increased R&D spending in 2010. Dallas-based Kronos
Worldwide expects to increase its R&D budget between 35% and 54% this year.

5.Outlook

If the interest among nonspecialty chemical makers in acquiring companies in
the sector is any indication, specialty chemicals appear to be headed for more
deals. Sloan also expects worldwide growth this year and next, fueled by the
economies of China and India. Member companies, many of which are small- and
medium-size firms, are hiring and expressing more optimism. Still, he notes a
host of wild cards — inflation, a weak construction sector, persistent
unemployment, the Japanese economy and possible asset bubbles in China.
"There's just a lot of uncertainty right now," he said.

• Upside: Sison said overall demand is holding up and he remains positive on
the industry. The segment tends to outperform the rest of the economy, he said,
especially in the earlier stages of a recovery. The industry has been more
disciplined in its price increases vs. past rebounds, he said. Wider use of
enterprise resource management software has helped, giving more detail and
better clarity across company cost structure.

• Risk: Multiple indicators point to possible trouble ahead.

The Economic Cycle Research Institute sees a global slowdown in industrial
activity by this summer.

Japan's earthquake and tsunami disrupted supply chains and cut production in an
already fragile economy.

China's industrial pace has slowed more than expected amid efforts to contain
inflation. Recent surveys of purchasing managers there showed slower
manufacturing activity. Sloan is particularly wary of what he calls
"impractical" legislation that could hinder innovation and competitiveness.
"That's the big enchilada," he said.

Rockwood Holdings Inc. (ROC)
Credit Suisse June 17, 2011

Increasing Estimates, ROC Remains Top Pick

We are increasing our 2011 and 2012 EPS estimates on ROC to $3.57 and $4.38
respectively (from $3.41 and $3.96 respectively), to reflect:

&#166; Robust TiO2 prices – based on the major producers announced price
increases YTD, we now forecast TiO2 sales up 25% and 13% in 2011/12
respectively (vs. up 10% previously) with 50% falling to the bottom line in
2011 and 23% in 2012 (which may be conservative). Longer-term, TiO2 remains a
non-core business and we think mgmt may sell it in the future, which could be a
positive catalyst for the stock.

&#166; Higher lithium volumes/prices – lithium volumes are growing
double-digits, driven by strong demand from the power tools and electronics
markets. Additionally, ROC announced lithium price increases of up to 20%
across their lithium portfolio, with prices expected to return to the 2008
level (~$5,000/ton). We estimate this will add $0.11/0.22 to EPS in 2011/12. As
such, we forecast Specialty Chemicals sales growth of 16%/12% in 2011/12

(which will be conservative if the entire price hike holds).

&#166; Positive mix/margins in Advanced Ceramics – ROC is benefitting from
strong growth in the Medical segment (35%), which is a higher margin business.
As such we expect the positive mix to drive margin expansion. We believe our
2011 estimate of $3.57, which is roughly in line with the consensus, may be
conservative. Moreover, our 2012 estimate of $4.38 is solidly above consensus
of $4.15. Additionally, assuming all of the lithium price increases go through
and margins in Advanced Ceramics and Specialty Chemicals expand with operating
leverage and mix benefits, we believe ROC can do closer to $5.00 of earnings in
2012.

With the stock trading at 5.7X our 2012 estimates, we believe the street is
under appreciating the robust earnings potential and high quality of ROC’s
businesses. As such we reiterate our Outperform rating and $70 PT.

>>> Rockwood Holdings Inc. (ROC)
Credit Suisse Apr 27, 2011

Upward Earnings Revisions and Multiple - Expansion to Drive Stock; Remains Top
Pick

Following ROC’s much better than expected 1Q11 results, we are increasing our
2011/12 EPS estimates to $3.41/3.96, well above the street at $2.81/3.48
respectively and expect the street to come up towards our numbers.

Our revised estimates reflect 61%/16% EPS growth in 2011/12 respectively,
driven by continued strong demand/ pricing in ROC’s high value segments
(lithium, ceramics), robust pricing/mix benefits in TiO2 and ROC’s strong FCF
that mgmt will use to reduce debt/interest expense. Further, we believe that
there is solid upside potential in our numbers but want to remain cautious
given Japan and the macro environment.

Given the higher numbers, we are increasing our 12-month PT to $70 from $57,
which represents a 7.8X multiple on our 2012 EBITDA estimate (assuming FCF goes
toward reducing net debt). With ROC currently trading at 6.8X our 2012 EBITDA,
we believe ROC offers one of the most compelling risk/reward profiles in the
chemicals space and reiterate our Outperform rating.

&#166; Demand/Sales–ROC benefited from robust sales/demand growth in 1Q
(volumes/mix +9.5%) that was enjoyed by all of the segments and didn’t include
anyone one-time benefits. Looking ahead, we expect the positive trends to
continue, with our expectation for ROC to enjoy 7.6%/7.8% sales growth in
2011/12 respectively. This will be driven by: 1) robust pricing/positive mix in
TiO2 (~40% of sales tied to specialty applications and ROC continues to target
50-55%), 2) strong demand for lithium from the consumer electronics and
power-hand tools markets (demand currently growing at double digits rate) as
well as higher pricing of downstream lithium compounds, 3) robust demand in
Advanced Ceramics driven by the medical market as ceramic hip joints continue
to replace metal-to-metal hip joints (this is happening faster than we/ROC
expected) and 4) solid demand in surface treatment driven by increased demand
for autos in Europe.

&#166; Margins–ROC met/exceeded their longer-term margin targets in a number of
the businesses in 1Q and based on the robust top-line growth expected, we
believe margins have the potential to push higher from the current record
levels – that said, to be conservative, we are modeling slightly lower margins
for the remainder of 2011 (adjusted for season-ality) and 2012 in each business
but TiO2. As such, we expect operating margins to approximate 15.1% in 2011 and
15.6% in 2012. This will be driven by improved operating leverage off the
top-line growth as well as benefits from mix and pricing. Also, recall ROC is
largely immune to the raw material headwinds a number of the other specialty
chemical companies are facing, given they don’t rely on organic/crude-based
raws.

&#166; Debt/Cash–Upon receiving the $289 mil of net proceeds from the sale of
AlphaGary, ROC prepaid $409 mil of term debt and refinancing the $850 mil
senior secured debt. This resulted in net-debt/LTM adjusted EBITDA going from
2.44X (pro-forma for the proceeds from the sale of Alpha Gary) as of the end of
4Q10 to 2.32X as of the end of 1Q11. Going forward, management made it clear
that debt reduction remains a top priority and ROC will use its strong FCF to
continue paying down debt, unless a very attractive bolt-on opportunity
presents itself. We view this as positive and believe ROC can significantly
reduce its debt load without any impact to growth, which should transfer
significant value to equity holders.

ADVC - on first glance and second glance it looks good. Couple nitpicks:

- I don't particularly like software companies that have been around for 17
years and have not grown to big size. Last couple decades have been enormously
favorable for software companies, so anytime I see an old company at 15M market
cap, I imagine it to be run by incompetent old fogies and/or by a guy in a
basement for his own fun. (ADVC does have 67 employees, so it's not a guy in a
basement ;). Its CEO holds 54% of shares, so it might be that he is incompetent
and/or running it for his own fun.).
- They say that they only spend nominal amount for R&D. Does this mean that
they are not developing any new products? (It's tough to get real understanding
of their R&D due to funky SW development cost accounting.)
- I also wonder what their competition is and whether they are falling behind
in technology. 15M is a very small market cap, so obviously they don't have the
whole EDI field to themselves. Who is their competition and will they eat
ADVC's lunch tomorrow?
- I am somewhat concerned that large part of their revenue is "Maintenance
contracts ". If they are running subscription model, then they might be putting
subscriptions there.
- I don't understand 10:1 stock split in 2009. Why it was done and what it
accomplished?
- It is not particularly cheap for current time. E/EV is at 12%, P/book and PSR
are somewhat high for a micro cap. I understand that they have high margins,
but still. It would be a great buy for April 2011, but right now there are tons
of companies at low prices, so buying illiquid microcap becomes a tough choice.
It did not drop much yet, so it might not go up much either compared to some
potential V shaped recoveries.

Note that these are nitpicks. I am not being negative, I am raising some
potential questions. The company does look attractive otherwise. It would be
perfect investment for someone investigative, who would call the company, call
the customers, get scuttlebutt, etc. I'm not good at that. :)

Jurgis,

re: ADVC. Wow, many great points. I can answer a few of them:

- The company originally worked on desktop-based EDI connectors to allow
companies to connect to VAN-based EDI backbones. It nearly died in late 1990's
when everyone was moving their infrastructures to the web. In 2000 the CEO
backlisted to raise capital to bet on web-based EDI. So, in one sense, it's
core business has been around for 10 years.

- Information is sketchy. But I believe ADVC actually runs Kroger's EDI
backbone and this forms the core of its client base and it expanded from there.
ADVC formed a partnership with iSoft in early 2000's and iSoft implemented
Wal-Mart's EDI backbone. So I believe that's how ADVC got to connect to
Wal-Mart and get some of its EDI traffic.

- 20% of ADVC's business is in e-doc integrator. I think that's the
"maintenance contract" you referred to. That's low margin and cyclical
business. The CEO acquired the business from his brother in 2007. This fact
alone isn't very comforting. But it appears there is some synergy between the 2
businesses and they managed to cut cost over the years. It doesn't concern me
much because it's a small portion.

- It appears to me its recent R&D is on modernizing its software to "Web 2.0".
(For the tech savvy, it means AJAX.) and the project was completed last year.

- The whole EDI field is huge. Even the grocery EDI field alone is huge. (I got
the figures somewhere in my notes. I need to dig it out.) The web based EDI
business is highly fragmented. A lot of large organizations uses their own
systems to do document exchange. There are indeed many vendors that provide
services in the same space. My view is, ADVC focuses on small suppliers that
big competitors aren't going after.

<right now there are tons of companies at low prices, so buying illiquid
microcap becomes a tough choice. It did not drop much yet, so it might not go
up much either compared to some potential V shaped recoveries. > 

I can't argue against this.

re US chemicals - the cheap NG feedstocks create a windfall for US basic
chemical companies that puts them at an advantage to Asian or European
producers. The biggest beneficiaries are commodity producers like LYB, DOW and
probably others.

I remember 2006/2007 when the same producers were bitching about high NG prices
and they threatened to move their facilities elsewhere. The question for me is
how much better can it get? Also it seems like the Europeans are holding their
own (BASF has better technology imo and uses their Verbundchemie production
system to lower their cost) and low feedstocks may not stay low forever. The
extremely low NG prices (and the low Ethane/Propane liquid prices) area truly a
windfall and not a real moat. That said, I think some chemical companies like
CE (which has an interesting technology to produce ethanol) are looking very
cheap.

I believe specialty chemical companies like Albemarle are better LT buys than
LYB and Dow.

ADVC. Could work out very well. I'll pass on it though.

I agree with Jurgis Bekepuris's conclusions. If a person were to do the
research and get comfortable enough with this thinly-traded .ob stock, to
become confident and comfortable enough to hold on if the stock got slammed, it
might be a buy now. I would not be such a person. For me, in this market, I
want the big low-hanging fruit. There are so many, many of them. I don't want
the risk of being in another roach motel. I'm in several already.

==============
"A supplier typically pays a couple of hundred dollars per monthly. There is no
incentive for them to switch EDI vendor. (It's a bit like once you use an
accountant, you are reluctant to switch.) It increased price in 2010. That
shows the pricing power."

I don't understand this. A small grocery supplier? You mean a small grocer that
sells to folks? Or is it a small wholesale supplier who sells to grocery
stores? The margins in the grocery business are so small. And the big guys seem
to be beating up the little guys worse and worse. I have to assume that small
companies -- small grocers -- have to fight for each penny of profit. If I were
one of them I certainly would look at the benefits of switching my EDI to a
cheaper firm or doing business differently if I could, than just without
question routinely paying a couple hundred dollars a month to ADVC for its
services.

metrics: low d/e, higher roe. Now and over the past several years. With DOW,
much bigger company, much larger dividend yield. Maybe safer (??)

I might be better switching into ALB rather than holding my recently acquired
DOW shares.

OT? CDS.

I don't have a good explanation, just couple of thoughts.
CDS's are not accessible to small investors. Possibly the market is quite
illiquid in certain issues. The market distribution of risk hedgers vs.
speculators probably depends a lot on the issue. The pricing may be based on
models, but it's not clear how precise these models are since very few of the
companies have actually defaulted. So even a rumor can possibly swing the
prices a lot. I am not sure there is a workable way to arbitrage trade the CDS,
e.g. go long French bank CDS and short BRK or DOW CDS. There is also
counterparty risk.

You might make a killing by just going long French bank CDS, but then you
can't...

Hi Paul

Clownbuck posted the June 30, 2011 analyst report for Noble Group Ltd.
(NOBGF.PK). It's worth a read it's only 12 pages long.(
http://www.thisisnoble.com/images/documents/moodys20110630.pdf )

From the report:"...High growth appetite matched by prudent management Noble
has achieved tremendous growth in recent years, primarily due to the addition
of new products and capital investment in production and processing facilities.
Revenues and tonnage showed respective CAGRs of 37% (from USD11.7 billion in
2005 to USD56.7 billion in 2010) and 15% (from 90 million metric tons to 184
million metric tons) over the past five years. <u>Its goal is to double its
revenue in five years – from 2007 levels – and achieve a return on equity of
20%. </u>Such a high growth rate and diversification present opportunities and
challenges...."

-----------------------------------------------------

They confirm pretty much what you posted earlier: ROE=17%

One of the company's goals in order to achieve this growth: "<u>...Strategic
capital asset investments, focusing on storage terminals, port facilities,
inland distribution operations, and processing and refinery facilities...</u>."

I think Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR) would be a good fit especially that
they are selling at historical lows. There was a new senior convertible debt
issued from last year that provides the holder to convert their preferred into
common shares at $7.50/share. I think the issue was $200M and it paid 7 1/2%.

It might make an interesting speculation for NOBEL to acquire as much of the
ULTR preferred as possible and if those cash flows come in as expected to buy
the company by exercising their conversion option. It would be a $1B+
transaction.

After searching the archive, I find that the only common link is that both
companies had used J.P. Morgan as their investment banker for recent financing
needs. No other mention of either company regarding their shipping and/or
logistics business.

Corning Ups Dividend First Time In 5 Years, Sets $1.5B Buyback Plan
http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2011/10/05/corning-ups-dividend-first-
ime-in-5-years/?mod=yahoobarrons
From the article:"...Shares of Corning (GLW) rose 58 cents, almost 5%, in late
trading to $13.18 after the company said it would raise its dividend by 50%,
the first increase in five years, and authorized $1.5 billion in stock
repurchases.

Management warned that trends in the display glass business are also
challenging, however.

The new dividend, now 7.5 cents per share per quarter, will begin with the
December 16th payout to shareholders of record as of November 16th. That gives
GLW a roughly 2.3% yield.

The dividend has been at 5 cents since July of 2007, when Corning returned to
payouts after having shelved the dividend during a period of losses.

The company’s board authorized $1.5 billion in buybacks “from time to time,”
which should begin this quarter, said CFO James Flaws.

The company has not had a program for repurchase of its shares since the end of
2009, when its prior $1 billion program expired....".

re Tesco @18.4$- TSCDY.PK I decided to sell Tesco too today , based on
valuation. I agree it's a good outfit but I don't see any outsize gains in this
stock.

BEKB.BR @28.5Euro - I decided to buy some Bekaert BEKB.BR overnight. Bekaert is
a steel fabricator - (wires for tires, fencing and many other special and niche
application). I have watched this company for a while and they are quite nimble
but with world wide operation. They always remained profitable despite
significant revenues losses in the financial crises and they pay a decent
dividend (1.67 Euro). They buy back some shares if they consider them cheap.
The company operates with moderate gearing (net debt ~ 1/3 of equity) which
appears like their target value over the years. I believe a family owns 40% of
the shares,which explains why they rationally allocate capital.

http://www.bekaert.com/en/About%20us/Press/News.aspx

A few years ago, I had some contact through my work with the company with the
material division (recently sold to Saint Gobain). They were selling spray
coated materials for architectural glass coating lines, but not only that, they
sold a complete mechanical adapter kit to install their sputter targets in
various machines. According out mechanical engineer, those kids were much
better than the original ones supplied by the manufacturers and their upgrades.
I felt that this was impressive. Not that it matters much, especially since
they sold this division. However, if that is the way Bekaert operates in their
other business lines, they may be able to keep ahead of their competition.

This might well turn lower but I wanted a foot in the door. I did sell DVN at a
loss today because I felt my portfolio became too oily (I was dead wrong
assuming energy pricing would hold up in a downturn) and I wanted to keep my
good dividend payers E and TOT (european oils that trade at even larger
discounts to intrinsic value imo).

I added some AHL and AXS (Jurgis favorite) on the recent downdraft. I feel like
the insurance stocks have found a base at the current ridiculous discounts to
tangible book.

They don't have as much high cost but low royalty production in the US either

When viewed on a five year chart its not clear weather the bottom is in. The
Williams %R ( http://www.tradeology.com/williams.html )is a good measure of
Market Psychology and indicates the stock is way oversold. The current price
does indicate a good "value" entry point.

<u>Market Psychology</u>

Each price is a consensus of value among traders. The recent high range shows
the bulls or buyers maximum power. The low of the recent range reflects the
maximum power of the bears during that trading range. The most important
consensus is as always the closing price.

 Williams %R compares each closing price to the recent range indicating whether
bulls can close the price near the top of the range, or bears can close the
market at the bottom of the price.

 Price may be pushed higher or lower during the day but the Williams %R will
indicate which group is actually capable of closing the market. 

 If bulls cannot close the market near the top of a rally they are weaker than
they seem and this creates a shorting opportunity. If bears cannot close the
market near the lows during a decline then they are weaker than they appear and
this creates a buying opportunity.

I also track the <u>Volume By Price Frequency Bands</u>. The stock will
generally move back to the higher level band where most of the previous Buys &
Sells have occurred. For FWLT this is $22-$28 but I would only sell when the
Williams %R is around 0 and the price is at or near it's SMA. I would confirm
my sell by looking at the PE and Forward PE and their order book. Right now, I
am still in Buy and accumulate mode at any price below $18.00/share.

Hi Paul -

Seaboard Corp. (SEB)

Started a position in SEB. The Forbes article that Jurgis posted earlier today
(
http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/1024/investing-value-stocks-apple-cool-produc
s-bad-investment-greenwald-william-baldwin_2.html ) had SEB as a Buy. This is
one I wanted to own and looking at the recent price activity seemed like a good
entry point if I could get it below $1,700.00. I put an order in today and was
surprised to see I got my five shares at $1,695.00/share. I expect Thanks
Giving should provide some good sales for their Butterball subsidiary.

SEB recently bought the Butterball turkey brand.

The article goes onto discuss Professor's Greebwald's views on the company:

"...It's assets (SEB) include flour mills, container ships and pigsties. What
little press the company gets relates to unpleasant topics like sweatshops. It
is hard to imagine the chairman wowing an audience with a demo of a new poultry
line.

Bruce Greenwald, value maven and professor at Columbia Business School,
instinctively prefers Company B (SEB). Glamour stocks, he says, are overpriced
(AAPL). Stocks with unpleasant aromas are underpriced. You'll do better over
time owning the latter. 

The Butterball firm is more obscure: Seaboard Corp. ( SEB - news - people ) Why
does it attract Greenwald? Because it sits on a rising mountain of cash and
liquid securities, because its operating assets--the pigpens and the
like--would be expensive to replicate and because those assets generate good
returns in comparison with Seaboard's stock market value. 

<snip>

Greenwald, 65, came to value investing somewhat late in life. He got his Ph.D.
in economics at MIT at a time when academic dogma decreed that the stock market
is completely efficient and therefore unbeatable...".

Hi JMako

Re:SEB

According to my StreetSmart Edge Research module, SEB has $316.43 Cash/share.
There are 1.2M shares out which makes cash available $379.72M. This represent
18% cash per share. The other nice thing is they generate $375 cash
flow/share(ttm). Other stats include $5.2B in sales.

Their annual report is quite long. You can see a few of my comments from an
earlier post to Paul (
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27595108 ).

One item that did catch my eye was their 2012 Capex budget was large and would
use up a lot of their spare cash and/or require some LT debt financing (I think
they planned on doing both). The main use of these funds was for the upgrade of
their shipping fleet (ie new ships). This was the one part of the company I
really did not want but the subsidiary is well integrated with their other
businesses, is not leveraged w/ debt like so many of the other shippers and now
is the time to buy ships as they are very cheep relative to several years ago.

My buy was pretty small and only represents 5% of my AG basket.

I am betting on their new Butterball subsidiary (which they recently bought)
and sure their next quarter earnings will reflect a spike in sales due to all
the Thanksgiving day turkey sales. Turkey like pork is being sold as the
"healthy" white meat and SEB owns both types of farms.

<u>Agriculture commodity and the Infrastructure theme</u>

My thesis is that everybody needs to eat and in a slow growth (or even negative
growth) world economy food and the production of food will be first priority.
Profitable and efficient AG companies and/or companies that support the
production of AG crops (through more efficient means: harvesting equipment,
genetic seeds, new milling facilities that separate seed oils into their
components more efficiently (like BG is doing w/ Sollazyme in Brazil) or JIT
logistics scheduling & transportation (The Nobel Group is the leader here),
etc.).

The main thing is to find the small growing "value" integrator that is
diversified in their operations. There should be a minimum level of production
that allows favorable margins and efficient production. Combine this with
sustainable and integrated practices a much more efficient operation can be
achieved. With good management practices and diversification in operations one
should avoid much of the short term swings in commodity prices. Of course,
future population growth will increase overall world demand for food too.

Others may have a different view on the global market dynamics. <u> My thesis
is mainly to invest in companies that bring disruptive changes to the current
way things are done making production more sustainable and efficient.</u>

For example, SEB is accomplishing this by integrating their Pork farms
effluents & waste into a state-of-the-art bio-diesel operation at their
Colorado hog farm. The Nobel Group is the first company to utilize their sugar
milling bio-mas waste to produce electricity in a huge integrated bio-mas
generating facility in Brazil.

I decided that the market will drop for awhile longer. Duh, what took so long?
So I sold a lot of stocks to raise cash, and I will try my hardest not to buy
anything for at least a month. If I am wrong, that's OK.

I am starting to reduce my risk exposure, in particular oil stocks. This is not
a valuation call but a macro call - I do not feel that good about the market
either. We had a growth scare in 2010 but this time feels different. My
concerns:

Austerity moves in Europe and US will suppress growth
ECRI report points to recession (priced in?)
Europe (partly priced it but may get worse).
China - slowdown and possible credit crunch

The latter could become a big deal and is not priced in. A moderate slowdown
probably is but some reports seem to indicate problems in financial system that
could have serious consequences, imo. The problem is the shadow banking system
that seems to drive the hot real estate market and keeps companies alive that
would go into bankruptcy in other countries (China does not have a bankruptcy
as we know it). While this shadow banking system may not be a problem by
itself, it seems that the shadow banking system itself obtains it's funding
from the regular financial system via trusts that are owned by life insurance
companies and regular banks. The exposure at this point is unclear and that is
what scares me. If regular banks get associated with this and hold bad paper,
we could get into a 2008 post Lehman type situation starting from China.
Experience shows that it will probably radiate out from there and might be hard
to contain.

I am not stating that it is bound to happen but it's a significant probability
and will cause considerable downside. Looking at the supposedly safe Chinese
bank stocks it occurs to me that something does not smell right:
http://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/3988.HK,0939.HK

I am not selling indiscriminately, but I decided to reduce my exposure to the
energy sector on this upward move and particular those stocks that I have been
overweight in. I expect at least more of a See-Saw market with opportunities to
play volatility and in the worst case another leg down.

Hi Sergio -

What about the inverse correlation of the U.S. Dollar and the CRB Index. By
debasing the U.S. dollar through QE2 and QE3, the CRB index rose to new highs.
Is this trend going to continue as the FED maintains it's quantitative easing
policy?

I propose that the next decade will be similar to what occurred in the late 70'
and 80's. The U.S. dollar fell while the CRB rose to new highs which eventually
resulted in double digit inflation. Eventually, the CRB fell as the dollar
regained it's value.

Based on the articles below, one can come to the following conclusion: (1) A
rising dollar is bearish for the CRB Index, and a falling dollar is bullish for
the CRB Index. (2) Turns in the dollar occur before turns in the CRB Index.

What is the best way for the Value Investor to benefit from this trend
(assuming we are relatively early in the cycle)? Own undervalued commodity
related companies.

Quantitative Easing: Was It Worth The Money

Creating commodity inflation Quantitative easing has a significant impact on
the prices of the commodities. During the period of QE 2 the CRB Jefferies
index rose by around 13 percent whereas Dollar index showed a similar sort of
decline proving high degree of negative correlation between the two. <u>The
logic for the above behavior lies in the fact that all the commodities are
valued in dollar and debasing the dollar automatically leads to rise in the
price of commodities</u>

Prevented Deflationary fears: QE2 has put a lid to all the speculations leading
to the fact that US is going on the same lines as Japan whose economy suffered
during the 1990s, sighting deflationary fears in the economy. Federal reserve
was determined to prevent “Lost decade” and has pumped enough money into the
system ensuring that deflationary fears are over for the time to come.

Areas of Concern

Plummeting Dollar: The dollar index, which is a measure of its performance
against other currencies, has been plummeting since the Federal Reserve has
started expanding its balance sheet, which stands at a whopping 2.9 trillion
USD including the TARP program. <u>The increase in the prices of commodities
has lead to inflationary fears and also Fed is committed to keep interest rates
low for an extended period of time. Now it is proving as a double edged sword
as Feds’ action to raise interest rates to prevent inflation can again bring
recessionary fears in the economy and also it cannot allow prices to hit the
roof hurting consumer sentiments.</u>

<u>Looking back in history - The 1970's & 1980's</u>

Here is a paper I found that reviews the rise in the CRB and fall of the US
dollar during the 1970's and 1980's.
http://www.oatscream.com/
The Dollar Versus The CRB Index

The decade of the 1970s witnessed explosive commodity prices. One of the
driving forces behind that commodity price explosion was a falling U.S. dollar.
The entire decade saw the U.S. currency on the defensive.
The fall in the dollar accelerated in 1972, which was the year the commodity
explosion started. Another sharp selloff in the U.S. unit began in 1978, which
helped launch the final surge in commodity markets and led to double-digit
inflation by 1980. In 1980 the U.S. dollar bottomed out and started to rally in
a powerful ascent that lasted until the spring of 1985. This bullish turnaround
in the dollar in 1980 contributed to the major top in the commodity markets
that took place the same year and helped provide the low inflation environment
of the early 1980s, which launched spectacular bull markets in bonds and
stocks.

The 1985 peak in the dollar led to a bottom in the CRB Index one year later in
the summer of 1986. I'll begin analysis of the dollar and the CRB Index with
the descent in the dollar that began in 1985. However, bear in mind that in the
20 years from 1970 through the end of 1989, every important turn in the CRB
Index has been preceded by a turn in the U.S. dollar. In the past decade, the
dollar has made three significant trend changes which correspond with trend
changes in the CRB Index. The 1980 bottom in the dollar corresponded with a
major peak in the CRB Index the same year. The 1985 peak in the dollar
corresponded with a bottom in the CRB Index the following year. The bottom in
the dollar in December 1987 paved the way for a peak in the CRB Index a
half-year later in July of 1988. Figures 5.4 through 5.6 demonstrate the
inverse relationship between the commodity markets, represented by the CRB
Index, and the U.S. Dollar Index from 1985 to 1989. Figure 5.4 shows the entire
five years from 1985 through the third quarter of 1989. Figures 5.5 and 5.6
zero in on more recent time periods. The charts demonstrate two important
points.<u> First, a rising dollar is bearish for the CRB Index, and a falling
dollar is bullish for the CRB Index. The second important point is that turns
in the dollar occur before turns in the CRB Index. </u>

1989. A FALLING DOLLAR WILL EVENTUALLY PUSH THE CRB INDEX HIGHER. CONVERSELY, A
RISING DOLLAR WILL EVENTUALLY PUSH THE CRB INDEX LOWER. THE 1986 BOTTOM IN THE
CRB INDEX OCCURRED A YEAR AFTER THE 1985 PEAK IN THE DOLLAR. THE 1988 PEAK IN
THE CRB INDEX TOOK PLACE A HALF YEAR AFTER THE 1988 BOTTOM IN THE DOLLAR.

Good afternoon EKS.

There is certainly more than the correlation between the dollar affecting
commodity prices, as I am sure you know. Demand from emerging economies had
something to do with the rise in commodity prices, but let's just look at the
dollar and a couple of commodities that have been red hot and cooled off, while
the dollar is forming a trend reversal after a long drop.

>>There is certainly more than the correlation between the dollar affecting

I a fear driven environment (like Oct 2008 and to a less extend August 20110
various asset classes become much more correlated or anti-correlation. Yen up
AUD down is a classical correlation. Basic material and energy prices become
correlated with currencies like AUD, stocks become correlated around the world
in different market and to energy prices like crude.

That is why some say that value investing does not work in a fear driven
environment and for the most part they are correct, imo. However even in a bear
market, when stock prices go down overall but in a more controlled manner,
dispersion sets in and stocks become less correlated, since investors weigh the
individual fundamentals that become clearer (even though they often become
worse too). Then value investing starts to work again. It works even better
when the market turns it it become really clear what is temporarily impaired
and who has permanently been impacted. The financials post Y2009 are a good
example as permanent impaired stocks like BAC, C HIG never even came close to
their pre-crises levels while many industrials were reaching Y2007 or at least
came close.

I expect the same to happen now but at this point it's hard to determine the
permanent impaired business.

Pretty good article, imo. I don't agree with some statements though:

>>The asset class at the heart of this phase of the financial crisis—sovereign
debt—is far easier to value than the securitised subprime mortgages that caused
the trouble last time.<<

This is not the case. Greeks debt is not easy to value, it is almost entirely
depend on political decisions and the willingness of the Greek people to pay
up. If they decide they are not going to pay, the debt is worth exactly zero -
because what are the creditors to do - invade the country to seize assets?

Since I assume the latter is not feasible, I don't think that anyone can value
Greek debt, it could be worth anything from 0-80% of the nominal value.

Europes debt crisis is not easy to solve - it depends on the willingness of
prudent members of he EU to pay for the imprudent ones - how can this be easy?
If for example, Mexico goes down a cliff, would the US be guaranteeing their
debt? Well they have done this in the past to some extend but that help had
limits. Many prudent members of the EU feel that they have done already way
more than they are obliged to do. Bystanders that don't have to pay like the US
and other feel that they should stand by their imprudent members. These again
are political decisions that cannot be easily handicapped.

>>I'm not worried about Greek debt. Its in Germany's interest to bail out
Greece, why aren't they doing it? Germany had gained from being involved in the
eurozone, look at their exports...<<

Germany export surplus in 2010 was about 6.5B Euro net - how can guaranteeing
~500B Euro in public debt to Save 6.5B Euro in net exports be a good deal for
the Germans?

And these 6.5B Euro in net exports will not go away suddenly either way - those
Greeks with money will buy the Mercedes or BMW be there a crisis or not.

Geithner and co have not right to tell the Europeans what to do.

Getting back to the investment topic, I strongly recommend to stay away from
European banks. iI the worst case scenario occurs (a mess default of Greece and
Portugal - Ireland will be fine) the French and German banks will be
recapitalized. it is actually not that big of a deal for Germany because a lot
of the banking apparatus (Landesbanken,Sparkassen and to some extend
Commerzbank) is already directly owned by the states or the "Bund"
Nationalizing banks in Europe is not that big of a deal you would expect, it
occurred in France in the 80's, in Sweden in the 90's and Germany took some
over in the 2008. Creditors have been know to take haircuts too but my guess is
not equity related senior debt will be fine.

I think cheap mutinationals in Europe are the way to invest - Bayer, BASF,
Schneider Electric, Siemens, Alsthom, Total, Eni, Michelin and others. They are
truly multinationals and just happen to be located in Europe.

As for your contest, I select AA. Rationale - hopefully good earnings report -
if earnings are bad ,it probably goes to last but who cares?

FWIW, I think AA is a decent LT story and restructuring play.

Germany export surplus in 2010 was about 6.5B Euro net

Is this perhaps a monthly number? According to the CIA World Factbook the
German current account surplus in 2010 was $188 billion, second only to China.

https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2187rank.

Moreover, because Germany imports all of its oil and natural gas from outside
the Euro area (mostly from Russia and the ME), the surplus it runs with other
European countries and in particular with the Southern Europeans is gargantuan.
The German surplus with tiny Greece, for example, is more than 7 billion euros
per annum.

This is the annual German net export number to Greece alone -8.5B in exports
and 2B$ in imports in 2010.I suspect total trade balance with Greece is a
little more balanced because services (tourism) out to be in Greece's favor.

Again, looking at Greece alone, it does not seem worthwhile to shoulder 500B
Euro in debt to make 6.5B Euro in net exports. It's cheaper for the Germans to
kick in 10-20B Euro in equity for their banks, if needed. I suspect however,
Merkel is going to push forward forcing a recapitalization by private means,
which may not cost the German taxpayer anything.

Clownbuck,

I don't believe they will let Greece pay nothing. They cannot invade them, but
they can shut them down for some time for them to see how they will feel
better, paying a little or being shut down. How will the German taxpayers feel
paying the lunch for people who don't pay taxes bribe, get pension at 57 etc.
etc. If they decide not to pay why would Portugal pay or Spain and Italy. I
read that Ireland is going to pay everything and they are going according to
their plan. Iceland is not paying anything, but I don't believe it. What I
don't understand is why they continue giving them money when they obviously
cannot pay. Probably they are gaining time to create the mechanism for
containing the crisis (saving the banks that will not receive their money).And
giving them just enough to keep them afloat. There is a lot to see...

I added Charoen Pokphand Foods Public Co. Ltd. (CPOKY.PK) to my watch list. The
company has paid their dividend (twice a year) since 2002. It has been
increased and cut during that period.

The Key Statistics (from Yahoo) look good:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=CPOKY.PK+Key+Statistics
Debit profile is good (LT Debt/annual earnings = 3.3). P/BV=3.10 (This is quite
high) PE 12.89 (Both seem a bit high to me). ROA= 11.1% ROE=23.4% w/ typical
low AG margins of 7 %.

The company operates livestock (Chicken, Duck & Swine) and aquaculture (shrimp
& fish) operations. They own a feed operation (creates blended feed from raw
materials) and operate food processing & ready meal packaging subsidiaries. The
company must purchase the raw materials that go into producing their own feed
blends (they use a lot of soybeans) to meet their different growing operations.
They are still price sensitive to their raw commodity costs as they have no
subsidiary that actually grow these raw materials.

Their annual report:can be downloaded here:
http://www.cpfworldwide.com/cpd/en/page/ir/investor.aspx

<u>On a first look, they appear to be a bit expensive (based on their PE) when
compared to BG and/or ADM.</u> <u> Both BG & ADM sell at or below their BV.
</u> I like to find some type of competitive advantage in their operation(s)
when compared to some of the other large scale operators. Do they have certain
efficiencies they can implement or currently use that give them an operational
edge? These are things that I look for in their annual reports.

I do like their European exposure (operations in Sweden, Turkey & United
Kingdom). They grow chickens at their Turkey facility which supplies Europe.
Therefore, depending what I see in their annual report, they may have some
competitive advantages here. This could take the form of favorable distribution
channels for their packaged meals and/or integrated efficiencies through
developing their own breeding stock (specifically bred for each growing
operation) and/or locating their chicken/swine farms close to their end
markets.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------

My preference is to buy at a 10PE or lower, BV close to 1.0 (unless they have a
significant competitive advantage in one or more of their operations) and have
shown that management can reduce the wild cyclical spikes in raw materials
inputs.

Hi J Mako -

Maintaining Watch Lists -

I use<u> Schwab's Street Smart Edge</u> platform. In the program you can create
multiple watch lists defined by Tab names. Within each watch list I can track
up to 100 companies. My watch lists cover sectors, themes, trading baskets I
have created: E&P and Ag,REITs, Preferred stocks, pending Buys and several
others.

The nice part with these watch lists, I can add other data for each company in
my list. Other data includes PE, Dividend yield, BV, and other value/financial
metrics. The watch lists allows me to sort the list based on any one of the
fields too. Each company in the list gets tagged with news as it is announced
daily so I can monitor significant events.

Therefore, as long as my theme(s) are working, I can monitor my lists compare
how the companies are tracking vs BV, PE's, dividend yields etc. I initially
buy a tracking position when the company comes into my value range,

Finally, I also have one of the Tabs set to "My Positions" which is a watch
list that have all of my active positions along with cost basis data. Much of
the same company financial data is loaded in this watch list including PE,
dividend yield etc. I can sort this by position size to arrive at my top 10
positions or sort by dividend yield to find my top dividend payers or even a PE
sort gives a quick look at what % of the portfolio is priced at 10 PE or lower
(my fast look at value).

I also use this SI thread as an archive for previous ideas and value
thoughts.<u> I try to index each post I make with the company name and stock
symbol along with one or two key words.</u> I can use the "advanced search"
feature to call up the post and read the replies. I also find it helpful to
track other Buy's and Sell's posted. For example, when Paul Senior makes a buy
on a company in my active watch list, I can easily pull the date of the post
and look at the Yahoo Finance "Historical Price" tab to see the approximate
price paid. This is helpful when I believe there is a good entry point for a
Buy. I will first scan the value investing thread w/ the stock symbol find out
who made recent buys (w/i the last year) and see what they paid (by scanning
the Yahoo historical price for that date). If I can get in at a lower price, I
generally start a tracking position or add more shares to my current position.

We can both be wrong on our entry points, but more often than not I have
noticed that the group here is more right than wrong when a "value" stock comes
into Buy range.

I use a similar approach when selling and/or peeling off shares. Selling seems
to be a much more personal thing than strictly "value". I tend to hold my
position(s) a lot longer. Others play the revision to the mean and sell at or
near this range. There are some who will also take the quick 2-3 day swing
trade gain.

That's the strategy I have been using with watch lists. I also have set up some
Google Doc spreadsheets specifically when tracking my two stock baskets: E&P
and AG. When you use the CHROME browser, it works quite well (especially w/ the
new changes made by Google). The real time updating is a bit slow but still
acceptable.

Gas Natural Inc. (EGAS)

I was thinking of peeling off some shares of this one from the IRA. I was going
to wait for it to go ex dividend on Oct 12 but more importantly I wanted my new
Buy stock to go down first. Glad to see EGAS make your sell list.

In the taxable account EGAS is in the top 25% of my dividend payers so I would
like to see it yield below 5% first before I start selling. The monthly
distribution is nice too. As it is trading near it's all time high of
$11.99/share, their PE is still in OK value range at 12.69. The forward PE from
the analysts is higher at 13.5 (you really want this to trend lower).

I have been selling other utilities with PE's around 15 but keeping those that
continue to pay a 4% or more dividend, provide infrastructure for expanding NG
supplies (storage, liquidfication processing, transportation) and have future
growth potential. EGAS does not really meet these characteristics.

Dominion Resources, Inc. (D) is one I sold too early (10% lower) and I closed
out my CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP) at a 7% lower level (@ $19.00/share). I
really like both of these companies for their NG assets and infrastructure
build out potential. D owns the only LNG East Coast port terminal called
Dominion Cove Point terminal.

I like LAD. It sells/services cars. In smaller communities. Somewhat isolated.
What's a local to do do -- travel hundred miles for better deal or for

Hi Sergio,

TGS has kind of a sentimental value to me as I was doing a lot of research at
the time over gas companies and is the only one that I have kept from that
time. The reason I started buying it was for its balance sheet and the
expansion of natural gas usage in the region. Also, if you remember, nat. gas
was around $14 per mmbtu at the time, which was substantially higher from
historic and current prices. I remember analyzing the ownership structure (the
shares trading in the US are restricted) and also the relationship between the
USD vs the Argentine peso - if you have time take a look at the major owners
and I think that might give a clue why they paid out the dividend (I'm just
guessing). One thing I have found a little bit frustrating with companies like
TGS is the timeliness of their financial reporting, which is another reason I
haven't been following it as passionately as once had. Let me know if you find
something - I'll dig a bit myself, but I would qualify this investment in the
same category as Paul Senior's Kodak shares - more of sentimental value than
economic one.

The article in seeking alpha says:

"...it has an inconsistent dividend record, however, it paid out $1.505 per
share in May – quite substantial considering the stock price was $3.71 at the
time..."

Watching 600 stocks!

You won't be monitoring all of them at the same time, right? Do you use any
kind of alerts? (e.g. "when a watched stock hit 52 weeks low")

Hi EKS,

How do you do the indexing?

I do the same, just as an example here is a link to the google spread sheet
that I am using:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmMINTtvsasBdGM5NGdpcF9KS3kxSUQ3Rm
0UkdxblE&hl=en_US

Google are adding functionality to their finance service very fast. When they
add options to it and display of all parameters of the balance sheet, then I
will have everything that I need.
I prefer google spreadsheets because you have automatic update of the current
price and all other parameters. I am working on a way to put conditions and be
alert if they are met. For example if the PE becomes less than 4 display the
line in red...

I am afraid that you mean something specific with watching/monitoring. Let me
try to explain.

I do not watch/monitor the price changes. This is something that would be good
to automate, but I did not get to it yet. For a subset of stocks (~100) that
are close to buy points, I have active limit orders or "prepared" orders that
are not submitted, but that I can look at for price changes.

On the fundamental side, I update fundamentals in the spreadsheets about once a
year for the whole set (600). For a subset of stocks I own/watch more closely,
I update them once a quarter/half year.

I have a Firefox add-on that tells me short info about the stock (the whole
3800+600=4400 set) when the ticker appears on any webpage including SI. Then I
can decide to skip it, update the info, add to the info, etc.

Let me know if this is not very clear or if you have any other questions about
what I do. ;)
