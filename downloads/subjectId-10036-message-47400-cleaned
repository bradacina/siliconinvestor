Hi - KyrosL

Re: SVU

Two items pop out to me in their review:

(1) Supply Chain Services EBITDA was down 13.3% YoY, vs. down 5.7% in Q2. I
think the YoY comparison is a better measure. It is worth looking at these
revenues excluding those from SVU's company owned stores. Is this side of their
business growing? Is management looking to grow this side of their business
(ie. excluding sales generated from servicing SVU owned stores).

I still need to review their annual report(s) to see exactly how much this
division has/will grow excluding servicing SVU's owned stores. This is
important especially if they plan to spin off this division and/or sell to an
interested buyer (like Sysco).

There was discussion last year that their logistic division may bid on
servicing Target's expansion into Canada. That expansion has been put on hold
by Target but could resurface in 2013-2014. This division has excellent
warehouse resources that borders Canada and would fit in nicely w/ Target's
original expansion plans.

(2) Management disclosed their estimated share of underfunded MEPP liabilities
at approximately $1.68 billion pre-tax as of year-end. Investors should note
that this is based on a market value of assets and actuarial value of
liabilities. We estimate the fair value of the underfunded liability to be
significantly higher.

I believe Clownbuck raised this as a concern in one of his post. That was a
good find as I overlooked this completely in my review. It's a huge potential
liability.

Otherwise, it was a pretty good report w/ really no new surprises other than
MAYBE that their same store sales slide has slowed and/or reversed.

---------------------------------------------------

It's item #2 that is a deal breaker for me. Their unfunded liability represents
upwards of $7.50/share. That (to me) is not a manageable number and I have not
seen any explanation by management how they plan to make up this deficit. GM
resolved their unfunded liabilities by entering into a a pre arranged
bankruptcy. This was the solution for the airlines too.

So what is the exit strategy? Spin off the logistic business to shareholders
and move the rest of the business into a pre arranged bankruptcy to discharge
their huge unfunded pension liabilities?

KyrosL, what's your exist strategy on your recent buys? Are you holding shares
for an eventual long term play. If so, what's your value target price? I still
own a position in the company but am not sure how to play it. My avg cost is in
the mid $7's so I could sell out w/ a minimal loss.

My target price is $7.50 before next earnings call. I try to keep my exposure
at 2%, so today I sold some to bring it down to 2%. The pension liability is a
lot (good thing they provided the total number in the call), but the LT debt at
$6+ billion is a lot more on a per share basis. So, it's essential that we can
see a clear inflection point sometime this year in terms of sales, IMO. Until
then it is a trader's stock.

I'll retry Molson Coors (TAP) now at a lower entry price. P/e is better (lower)
at 10-11x, which is usually about my max for a food or beverage company.

Not much growth in TAP, although larger/better capitalized BUD seems to be
doing very well. Maybe also not much growth in the beer market in general. TAP

Chattanooga: VW's Next Stand
http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2012/04/chattanooga-vws-next-stand.html

From the article"...With a brand-new plant now open in Chattanooga and
producing more than 600 Passats a day, Volkswagen officials say they have
learned from the painful lessons of Westmoreland. They've used that knowledge
to build a plant they believe will be a force in U.S. automotive manufacturing
for years to come.

<clip>

The plant was designed to make employees more efficient and the plant itself
greener. The basics:

VW has made a $1 billion investment into the plant.
The plant sits on 1,400 acres northeast of downtown Chattanooga.
Roughly 2,200 jobs were created when the plant opened, and another 800 jobs are
being added.
As it sits now, the plant has a capacity for 150,000 Passats a year, but the
site's footprint can be doubled, allowing for more production if demand calls
for it.
It's a plant of "short distances," which means all the manufacturing areas come
together in a smaller area, making communication better and more frequent.
There's a focus on quality assurance, with portions of the plant devoted to
testing so continual improvements can be made. In addition, VW gets feedback
from consumers and dealers and works quickly to identify and fix problems.
There are many aspects to the plant that make it environmentally friendly;
these efforts won the plant the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
Platinum certification in December 2011. It is the only auto manufacturing
plant in the world to win that designation, VW says...."

=====================================================================

Maybe they got it right this time.

I own a 2005 Passat diesel that I bought used back East on EBay and had shipped
to CA. At that time you could only buy a used diesel (must have over 9K miles)
and bring into CA because of the states EPA diesel regulations. VW now builds
the Jetta diesel in Mexico and is EPA approved to sell new in CA. Both cars get
over 40 MPG freeway and 35 MPG City, are one of the most energy efficient
designs in the industry and are affordable. You pay a slight premium for a
diesel engine but you make it back in better fuel mileage and longer engine
life. For me a better option than a hybrid.

VW is one of the only main stream manufacturers that builds an affordable,
reliable and now high performance diesel offered in Ca.. My car runs a
Bio-diesel blend that is similar in price to unleaded gasoline.

does not show up in most Enterprise value calculation even though in my opinion
it should. Management downplays the issue, imo (and this is putting it mildly).

GMXR,

Take this with a grain of salt, since I know little about GMXR. However, I do
see the convertible bonds due in 2013 are yielding 49% to maturity as of today.
This lack of confidence would make me antsy buying the stock or the preferred.
I'd especially much rather own the bonds than the preferred, as the preferred
likely will not get anything in a bankruptcy.

The stock is harder to tell. The stock has the same downside risk as the
preferred, but has more upside if the company survives.

That being said, I will not be taking a position in this one.

Thanks for the thoughts. Seems like many have given up on GMXR (and for some

that spells disaster, but they have taken significant steps to reposition to

Thanks for the heads up on their bonds. I closed out my losing equity position

GMXR bonds,

The CUSIP is 38011MAB4. The maturity is 2/1/13. I'd be interested to know if
you were able to buy them.

The reason I noticed the GMXR bond prices, by the way, is that NGPC owned the
bonds and took a big writedown. NGPC is a BDC trading at a big discount to NAV,
so it might be another way to participate, but they have a bunch of loans to
other energy companies too.

Gerdau S.A. Common Stock (NYSE: GGB) - closed out position
SuperValu Inc. Common Stock (NYSE: SVU) - peeled off higher priced shares
E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Com (NYSE: DD) - closed out position
Seaboard Corporation Common Sto (AMEX: SEB) - closed out position

Want to deploy the cash into other sector(s). I continue to hold shares in CAG
w/ also goes xdividend next week. ADM is still a good value play but I believe
I can start a position at a lower price. ADM dividend is not very good either.
SEB very good value but pays no dividend. Will start another position below
$1,700.00 on any sell off. Just did not want to see the profit disappear.

Closed out my DD position which is my last lot originally bought 1/14/2009 at
$23.89. DD's relative dividend is not as good now. Their solar business is
finding more competition and therefore less profitable but their AG business
still provides a good value. I think I can establish a new tracking position at
a lower level, perhaps around $44.

I had SVU in my AG food basket. Peeled off some of my high priced shares.
Closed out GGB (Brazil steel maker) as I believe a lower entry point may be
possible if the $US gets stronger. Booked those profits on my small position.

Today's sells reduced my AG basket holdings by 20%.

EKS, How about a Twizy?

http://www.renault.com/en/Vehicules/renault/Pages/twizy.aspx

A review:http://www.carkeys.co.uk/launch-review/renault-twizy-0

I've been buying SEV, although it takes a while to build a position. They were
selected to provide the control for the Renault Twizy which recently went on
sale.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/sevcon-hits-automotive-milestone-selection-123000
43.html

Servcon sells controls for electric vehicles of all types and they have
subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. They are HQd in the U.K. but have facilities
in the U.S. as well as in Japan and have made inroads into the Chinese market.
Their sales are recorded in U.S. Dollars, as well as Euros and the British
Pound.

No analyst follows SEV and although it has a small float made more illiquid by
insiders holding more than half the shares, institutional investors hold about
25% of the float. Gabelli made a large purchase in Feb.

Servcon has concentrated its sales efforts on off road and industrial vehicles
in the past, but due to the recession, has been targeting other markets.
Besides the Renault deal, they also have an agreement with Flextronics.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/sevcon-flextronics-automotive-join-forces-1400006
4.html

They have retained their off road and industrial clients and added new clients
to make up for the reduced sales. Their last q indicated a huge improvement
over the prior year.

I would expect the stock to gain more attention at some point, specially if
Gabelli offers his insight on this stock in Barron's Roundtable.

My concern is that it is a new IPO without a real dividend record of stability
much less increases. Also, looking at the chart, anyone would have some
concerns. http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=INN+Basic+Chart&t=3m

For 5.89 yield, you can buy NNN, with a chart like this:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=NNN+Basic+Chart&t=1y and they have paid a
dividend for about 15 years, so the track record is better.

NNN vs INN

>Granted, different sectors, but maybe a little more safety in NNN?

I don't think so.
-- NNN FFO is expected to be flat thru 2013. INN growing.
-- NNN PE is 16, INN is significantly lower.
-- insiders selling NNN; buying INN
-- NNN sector prob safer than hotels however.
-- for a PE of 16, I'd buy COR before NNN.

PS to those selling COR. I don't mind holding for awhile longer. I've already
sold > 1/2 my shares, and have moved from super-sized position to 80% position.
I prob sell a few more now, but cannot handle any more ST gains this year. I
think it is still an easy hold, but other things might be better.

This is not my read of the transaction. Inbev acquired BUD in 2009 and incurred
significant leverage due to this deal, so they shed a bunch of non-core assets.
One of those assets was Starbev apparently, which was sold to a private equity
outfit for ~3B$. Now TAP buys the Starbev for ~15% more. Given the market
development and the sharp reduction in financing cost since 2009, and the
decent EBITDA multiple (~11), the acquisition cost looks on the cheap side.

My take is that the market valuation for companies in Europe are somewhat
depressed due to the European issues and TAP got a lower price than otherwise
possible.

Fido shows 38011MAB4 just fine. This does not guarantee that you'd be able to
buy it though.

From what I understand ~50% yield is yield-to-maturity. The coupon is 5% and
the price is ~70 right now, so it's not current yield. And there's only a
single coupon left on 8/1/2012. So really the ~50% yield comes from the coupon
+ expectation that the bond is redeemed at par on 02/01/2013.

Whether it's a great value, depends on the probabilities of GMXR going bust by
the maturity date. If you assume over 80% chance of GMXR surviving, then it's
an OK deal. Otherwise, not really. :) In either case better than prefs... :)

Positives:
+Excellent balance sheet with ~ 200M$ in net cash
+Valuation PE around 10x, EV/EBITDA ~4.5, P/B ~ 1.1
+earnings expected to grow ~ 10% in 2012 relative to 2011
+good long term growth record
+nice dividend (~12Euro/share)
+resilient business
+ family controlled (via Klein holding)

- earnings pressured by material cost and below peak earnings (~ 60Euro/share)
- European contagion risk
- 2 tier share structure (KSB.DE and KSB3.DE - the latter have no voting
rights)

I like the pump business because the economics have improved over the years,
cyclicality is reduced since i watched that company in the 1980's. I suspect
that it is due to increased consolidation and the important of the resilient
and profitable service business. I think this trend is likely continue

OT - Cell Phone shared by the village

Paul - I have made KIVA loans to a few village ladies that provide the use of
their cell phone to their village. It's the only way for the group to afford
the use of a phone w/o having to walk 50 miles to the next village to use a
phone.

The phone allows them to communicate outside their village. Usually they
arrange the sale of their food stuff not consumed. One small farmer sells his
coffee bean crop through a co-op located in the next village. He coordinates
his harvest using the village cell phone based on when the co-op will be
sending their harvest to the local buyer.

When the cell tower infrastructure gets built out around the world and the cost
of use falls in price, this technology (w/ the smartphone) will help leapfrog
the third world into the mainstream. Commerce, education, medical consulting
can now be available to the small village.

I can see where a large developed country approaches a third world village and
offers to build out their cell infrastructure and provide free or a very
subsidized wireless service in exchange for much of their natural resources. It
could be a win/win for everybody if that increases the living standards and the
health of the village.

My long term bet would be owning Siemens AG (SI). They are partners w/ NOK on
their cell tower design and infrastructure division. They usually build to
specification of the local agency and the state agency operates the system
(this is what they are doing in China). SI also has lots of exposure into all
the other infrastructure equipment required to bring these small villages into
a better standard of living.

My SI EK$ value is right around the current price of $94.00/share. The company
yields 3% and has excellent growth prospects all over the world. I plan to
start another tracking position on any sell off into the $80's. My last buys
were in the high $60's and I sold that position starting at lots over $100. I
was out of the stock early by July 2010.

A wild card bet might be to nibble as some shares of NOK, in hopes they spin
off and/or sell their cell tower design infrastructure division to SI. I think
that division alone is worth around $2.00/share last I looked. NOK hit a new
all time low this week of $4.02/share.

With some of these stocks, I find myself trading around the position, and with
others I'm just holding on. Began adding to my position in LSB Industries (LXU)
today. Business is a little hodgepodge - climate control (pumps, etc) and
ammonium nitrate production (fertilizer). Climate control segment is doing
poorly; fertilizer at record. (Although that nitrate sales are going great that
might mean it's time to sell stock--not buy-- if one assumes cyclicality of
this chemical business.) P/e is reasonable -- hard though to make a case for
LSB as a value stock, because of volatility of metrics (roe, p/bk) over past
years, and relatively high p/sales now. Also insider controlling family members
are cashing in their options quite heavily, it seems to me. Increasing stated

I love your basket approach to these companies. And been considering the same
kind of positioning in my portfolio

For me, Its hard for me to explain... and i have had this theory on the E&P
companies.... IF you are going to invest in a tech company (or E&P) you have to
extend your investments across a wide moat, you cant just be selective and
choosing one.... you have to essentially spread your risk out while at the same
time hoping that one or two of the investments pays so exponentially large that
it pays for your duds that didnt work out, if you only invest in one or two
your risk increases exponentially but your return profile doesn't match the
risk.....

That is why i have been hesitant for to invest in the tech companies, instead
of investing in a couple of E&P companies because of the risk i would rather
spread the same dollar amount across 10-15 companies.

The value is in the sector and certain regions, not in the names - it is just
to difficult to pick a couple and hope for the best.

extent that funding cuts wipe out the for-profit schools' ability to be

re Japanese net-net - most (if any) of these don't even at the Tokyo stock

Also (because of the above), even Interactive Brokers won't let you buy any of

Authors choice of rating Excel first, since this name has the smallest EBITDA
margins and is in the very competitive field of LCD manufacturing. I probably
would have picked out Natoco from the lot.

FWIW, for japanese companies, i prefer those with some export exposure, since
they have a chance tom grow, even if the Japanese domestic economy continues to
falter. There are plenty of names to choose from, that trade on the Tokyo stock

Paul,

I have followed this sector very closely, and i think you bring a viable point.

I go back and forth on this more than you know and there is not much certainty
on any level, but i suppose that's part of investing and maybe provide adamant
opportunity.

I could see it going either way honestly. Maybe Devry and Univ of Phoenix will
make it, also Bridgepoint Education BPI (maybe best of the breed) but the
others in the sector i have less of a good feeling for (even Strayer). I have
shorted many of these names circa 2010 - seemed like years ago

The issue for me is these companies are invested as if the government will
continue to spend a certain amount of money into the foreseeable future (while
understanding that alot of this has been discounted considering the value they
are trading at). When this happens.... CapEX and FCF/returns on investment do
not correlate and (generally) significant losses and write downs have to
happen. The fear is that this potential relationship is a toxic one.

The valuations and numbers hardly matter at this point, its more of a
relationship play between government and for profit edu.

Another Note: insiders are still bailing out of these ships sailing huge
amounts of shares, i dont see a single person buying.

For profits might adapt to changes. What's not clear is whether they are going
to report boom-year profits anytime soon or ever. If you look at APOL or DV and
you assume a 50% earnings cut, the stocks are no longer cheap. Actually for DV
it's not cheap assuming current 6 months earnings annualized or 2009 earnings.
Are you expecting that DV is going back to 2010-2011 earnings very soon? If so,
why?

My guess is that the earnings will drop even more from current level. I am also
concerned about off-balance-sheet entities that Clownbuck's article referred
to. These things can blow up. It's possible that the better for-profits will
avoid some of the fallout though.

I agree with Matt that it might go either way. Government might get
distracted/sidelined/lobbied into allowing the for profits to continue the
merry game for some time. Stocks might bounce back to higher valuations. I'll
probably skip this sector though.

Earnings estimates are all over the place for DV and APOL. DV had a recent
large impairment charge, so annualizing 1H earnings might not give a realistic
estimate of the year's performance.

APOL: I look for earnings to be down next year. I don't see big demand falloff
though or oversupply of schools to meet that demand. Nor demand destruction as
a result of government funding cuts. When looking past next year, I expect the
p/e to reflect better times again, and that p/e to revert sometime then to 15+
area.
That should result in a stock that trades more than $45 share within 18 months.

Yesterday I saw an article, that Rogers are closing their DVD rental business.
So it will be only Coinstar in Canada. It was about 80 million revenue for
Rogers. If coinstar can get half you should expect 40 million more income for
them in the next year coming from canada.

Shorting any high flier, especially one that has a heavy short position is a
recipe for the greatest loss ever theory.
Just look at Whitney Tilson who is a pretty sophisticated and usually "right
on" short seller.

Whitney Tilson and Glenn Tongue's hedge fund T2 Partners covered their major
short of Netflix (NFLX) last February, almost at it's high. They ultimately
would have made a bundle, but no one is immune from short squeeze after short
squeeze. My guess and hope is that Chanos has a super small position, and is
hoping he can goose it higher before taking a decent sized position.

Shorting is a blood sport.... so i hear

I had my issues shorting netflix, im tired of messing with technology shorts to
be honest - though currently looking at Pandora (p). Guess i cant help it.

Chanos portfolio is a diversified short portfolio with the occasional long.

Even his largest "bets of the decade" shorting china he only had 5-10% of his
portfolio exposed.

I also have a feeling he is able to not have to cover like majority of us -
just a feeling

I am also currently short VALE, EWA, BHP fwiw:

- Vale since 2010, March 2011, July 2011
-BHP since July/Aug 2011
-EWA since July/Aug 2011

Gogo - its 40M in revenues which does not translate into income. Anyhow, you do
have a point, however, the other side of the story is - Why is Rogers closing
its DVD business? I mean thats a question I will love to get a "real" answer
to. what do you think?

Possibly OT.

Shorting VALE, BHP, EWA - I assume this is China collapse bet? Or world
collapse bet?

I currently don't hold any of these, but I hold long positions in RIO, FCX,
SLT, so I guess I am on the other side of your bet. ;)

I'm with Einhorn on this. IMHO, the death of PCs is vastly exaggerated.
Especially for company such as Dell.

I'd be more concerned about possible Mac inroads into enterprise PC market than
about tablets replacing PCs.

Still, it's tough to decide whether MSFT, INTC or DELL are best/cheapest
investment. I hold all 3 with MSFT being largest position by huge margin.

Sorry, 40 mil revenue. Rogers have on demand service. you can rent a movie and
watch it from your cable. This is one more reason to have Rogers cable at home.
I don't see any other reason. They used to rent their dvds in the same offices
they use for subscribers of Rogers cable. The same stuff that subscribe you
would rent you the DVD. So they will not save money on that. I really don't
understand why they would close it.

Jurgis,

OT OT: Yes this is possibly off topic, that is why i havnt posted much here
about my findings. I have wrote post here on and off about vale/china since
2010.

Getting direct exposure has been difficult, its not as easy as someone say
Chanos going and owning Chinese banks on Hong Kong exchanges, which i have
looked but shorting is expensive for me and i have to play it a bit differently
with the access i have.

I also have been looking at japanese industrial to short as a semi play on
china, i love the relationship that they are spending huge amounts of capex and
yielding nominal cash flow barely earning cost of capital (even with low
interest rates which might not hold forever there anyhow) - that is a
relationship that has worked for me in the past.

But Yes! this is a play on the massive fraud that is the emperor that wears no
clothes China and Australia who is addicted to her like ************ on crack
cocaine.

You have definitely positioned yourself the opposite of me. Maybe there is
value there over the long run.

I wouldnt touch rio, fcx with ten foot poll. After some wreckage for these
stocks i might get my 11 foot pool out

Fine by me, i have done ok on the positions and i don't plan on owning these
forever and i am usually early to both sides of the party leaving and exiting.

Oh and btw i dont believe in world endings, not really my thing : )
