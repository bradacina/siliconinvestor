I remember someone on a different thread liking mgam when it was in the 4-5

some. tech up. OT is there a discount broker that lets you buy canadian listed
stocks on line? I was looking into buying a canadian stock today and I wasted
half an hour with ameritrade trying to buy it with a limit price- I called 3
minutes before it opened got a bid ask . put my order in at the ask-got
nothing. later on had a lengthy talk with the broker, got quoted a higher
offer-asked him to find out how much was available at that price and it turned
out to be a third of what i wanted. asked him how many canadian dealers they
use. answer-1.

About restaurant stocks. I see where price of beef -steak- is rising very
quickly to new multi-year highs. There must be a humongous number of people on
Akkins or South Beach -g-

I just wonder if the price rise is so high that it will reduce steak chains'
reported profits in upcoming quarters. I assume there's some hedging and
quantity buys by the big chains, but hedges eventually get redone.

So once again, I'll pass on RYAN and STAR --- about the 15th time in past five
years I've come close but not bought. I do have CKR, SWRG, one or two more
meaty stocks -- not sure what I'll do with those.
LNY, I'll continue to hold. Prices for seafood might go up if enough meat
eaters switch, but maybe seafood will still be a relative bargain.
Anyone here spot any value opportunities to play the rising meat prices?

By the way, he also mentioned CSTR, which I chose instead of MGAM (I liked it

category than the Value. I sold IBA and WPL to buy them. Don't know if it's a

Paul,
Expect meat prices to drop again once Canadian beef is allowed back into the
U.S. market (within weeks). Canada is a major beef exporter, but a single case
of mad cow disease shut down the border. That case also caused Japan, etc. to
buy more from the U.S., further shifting the supply /demand balance.

IMO, The only two things that could increase meat prices long term are
increasing demand from China or a reduction in U.S. agricultural subsidies.
Neither seems likely, short-term.

Godot, I've not been following trucking companies for a while, and I've not

is trucked into the US)
---------------------
Fwiw, I summarize the discussion of stocks of sea borne vessels that have been
discussed here, as follows:

Several posters have mentioned their particular favorites over the past years.
There are several ways to slice the sector: oil transporters vs. bulk carriers;
size of ship (e.g. oil tankers built for cross continent, oil tankers built for
Panama canal--- the size of the ship determines which oil producers (countries)
and which oil companies are customers); ships contracted long-term vs. ships
contracted based on spot-market; age of ships (single hull vs.double-hull
requirements). There's been no consensus among posters here about which
shipping company or companies are the better buys; posters seem divergent in
their selections.

It seems to me at this point, it doesn't make much difference which company was
chosen; the stocks seem to have moved in tandem or at least got to the same
spot now. They sell near highs but at low p/e's to the market (not necessarily
to their own history). I just sense (and I've been wrong many, many times) that
anyone interested in the sector now could buy one or two stocks in the sector,
and that'd be getting roughly the same % upside (or downside) that any of the
stocks might see.

Comments from board please. I am curious about market cap and enterprise value
from multex as shown in yahoo. Enterprise value obviously factors in debt and
maybe someone can give me an opinion on how multex makes this calculation. Here
is what I find interesting:

Stock Market cap / Ent value
amr 2.15 / 13.33
dal 1.6 / 11.07
luv 14.67 / 14.46

aes 5.48 / 24.23
ep 4.37 / 27.07
xom 242.51 / 241.06

The heavy debt load of major airlines has resulted in the sector being severely
punished(rightfully so in my opinion).

Similarly the heavy debt load of the energy sector(traders) has caused a severe
sell off in their stocks. Here I think the public is wrong. In any case I have
been accumulating aes and ep for the past half year and think that these stocks
have a way to go.

Bennett Environmental Announces Q3 Results
Thursday, October 23
Revenues and Profits Significantly Increase From Prior Quarters

OAKVILLE, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 23, 2003--Bennett Environmental Inc.,
a North American leader in the high temperature treatment of contaminated
soils, announces Q3 revenue of $22,402,772 and net after tax profits of
$6,796,616 or $0.39 per fully diluted share ($0.28 US). Compared to the same
quarter last year, the Company more than doubled its revenues and nearly
tripled its profits from $9,057,125 and $2,306,240 respectively as the
Company's treatment facilities continue to increase capacity utilization. On a
year to date basis, revenues of $47,822,472 have generated profit of
$12,975,183 or $0.74 ($0.52 US) per fully diluted share. Demand for the
Company's services remains high with good visibility on shipments well into
next year. Construction on the new plant in Belledune, New Brunswick is
underway and on schedule with full production expected by mid-year 2004.

The Company announced on September 9, 2003 that after a thorough and
comprehensive review of its permit application, the Government of New Brunswick
had approved construction of a new thermal oxidation soil treatment facility.
The plant will be a key partner in the Renviro environmental industrial park
located near Belledune in northeastern New Brunswick. The proposed facility
will be capable of treating 100,000 tonnes of hydrocarbon and creosote impacted
soil. It will use the same proprietary, state of the art technology, which has
been safely and successfully employed for six years at Bennett's facility in
Saint Ambroise, Quebec. Construction on the new plant is well underway and the
foundations are nearing completion. Design and tendering for the equipment is
progressing on schedule and the facility is on track for start-up and
commissioning in Spring 2004. Following successful source testing, an
operational permit and full production is expected by mid-year 2004.
Results of Operations

Bennett Environmental had a Q3 profit of $6,796,616 or $0.39 per fully diluted
share versus a profit of $2,306,240 or $0.13 per share in the corresponding
period last year. Revenues were $22,402,772 in the quarter versus $9,057,125
for Q3 2002. On a year to date basis, revenues of $47,822,472 have generated
profit of $12,975,183 or $0.74 ($0.52 US) per fully diluted share. Compared to
the first nine months of last year, revenues of $29,295,904 generated profit of
$7,086,491 or $0.41 per share.

The Company's operating costs of $9,966,464 for the third quarter, were higher
than the $3,889,954 for the same period last year and reflect the higher plant
utilization in the quarter. In total, 23,000 tonnes of soil was processed in
the quarter compared to 11,000 tonnes for the same period last year. So far
nearly 52,000 tonnes have been thermally treated this year. Administrative and
business development costs of $1,647,182 for the quarter were in line with
$1,689,207 from the same period last year.

The Company's cash position has increased in the quarter by $1,967,262 to
$12,472,444. Compared to the same period last year, cash reserves have
increased by $2,913,271 from $9,559,173 at September 30, 2002. In the quarter,
cash provided from Operations of $7,717,446 was offset by increases in working
capital and investing activities. Receivables of $26,492,613 reflect a high
level of $16,694,305 due from the Government of Canada as part of the
negotiated payment schedule on the Saglek Labrador project. This amount will be
paid over the next three quarters. The Company's net working capital position
at September 30, 2003 has increased to $28,395,756 from the net working capital
position of $18,206,207 at December 31, 2002. During the quarter the Company
invested $1,695,832 in permitting and construction activities associated with
the Belledune, New Brunswick plant.

BEL - Bennet looks like a good pick to me. I'm looking into it some more, but
bought some while I do, because it looks like the dip is temporary.

(Your company financial numbers seem to be CAN$, but your stcok price looks
like US$... Am I right?)

The expansion plans and inventory position (backlog) are quite impressive. They
made US$0.28 in the qtr and with the capacity coming online with backlog
growing, it looks like they could be using the new capacity quite profitably.
So maybe over $1.10+ US$ base plus expansion profitability. You say the conf
call said "the Quebec plant could add $1-2 EPS". So maybe $2.00 US$ EPS? Is
that your thinking?

US$ stock price $17.32.

Near the end of the CC management was asked if Quebec would add $2, according
to the analyst's calculations, and my notes don't clarify if the analyst meant
US or Canadian. Sorry. But management did downplay that possibility and
positioned the benefit anywhere from $1 to $2, I recall.

I do have in my notes that they expect to meet or exceed $1.14 Canadian, maybe
$1.20.

When I heard of the backlog, the Quebec boost, and the possibility of being

Steve,

I have not experienced more cycles than you. :) Here's my personal opinion
anyway, for what it's worth. :)

I don't think the market is richly overvalued. There are numerous stocks that
are in reasonable "hold" range. For some people, this may even be a buy range
due to lack of alternatives - interest rates are loooowww. I looked at S&P and
decided to hold my index fund investments for now. It's a tough call though,
since evaluating an index is much harder than evaluating a company. And I also
tend to "hold" rather than sell with indices and mutuals.

On the other hand, Nasdaq and tech seem to be reaching high valuations again.
They may be warranted if the tech upturn with growth begins again. I would not
be very sure about it. QQQ puts may be a reasonable hedge here - I don't have a
clue, since I don't play short side. Remember that tech sometimes runs to
outrageous valuations before collapsing.

Unfortunately, as you note, there is not much to buy right now. I have some
cash and I'm looking at a couple of tentative candidates that have moved up
since my previous buys (or considerations). Drugs is one interesting area, but
I am not sure current prices discount possible deluge of generics plus
el-cheapo Canadian and Indian drugs. I'm holding a rather large position of
BMY. If I wasn't, I would probably buy a piece of MRK.

I would be slow to assume that tech stocks are way overvalued. Here is an
example. Let's assume that in tough times a tech company that was not paying
taxes because of NOL's was making $5 on $100 of decreased sales, with gross
margins of 50%. Because of infrastructure in place, an entirely plausible
increase in sales of $10 might bring close to an extra $5 to the bottom line,
nearly doubling EPS. This example is merely meant to demonstrate that tech
P/E's might shrink quite rapidly in the right environment.

Jeff,

What you are saying here is that techs are cyclical - your claim also applies
to any smokestack cyclical industry. The $10M question is whether techs are
still *growth* cyclical as they were for last decade. I.e. is there growth in
there for CSCO, INTC, etc. Because if they will only achieve and never surpass
the EPS of 1997, then they should be valued as cyclicals with PEs at the top of
the cycle in single digits. And they are overvalued by this measure.

If, on the other hand, they remain growth cyclicals, then higher valuations are
justified. Of course, this can be only estimated company-by-company, so a
blanket statement that all techs are overvalued is wrong. For me though, I
don't see any bargains in tech and the companies I looked at are either sells
or weak holds - in other words, overvalued.

I took a starter position in JNJ at $48.99. Reasons: think most of the bad news
is priced in; 1.96% yield with steady history of rising dividends; payout ratio
of 40%; declining debt since 1999, now very low; rising net profit margins
since 1998; history of EPS growth; recently saw a Stock Selection Guide (NAIC)
with conservative estimates, and it was a "buy;" ugly chart but think there is
some support around $48-$49.

Brinks,

FTI Consulting looks interesting. Thanks for the recommendation.

You might look at PARL. It is selling well below net tangible assets and has a
low PE with recent positive earnings and news announcements. It also had a
buyback in place and may recontinue the buyback in the future. It had traded up
intra-day after the recent earnings and news announcements, but some sellers
have stepped in.

PARL has some governance issues outlined in Motley Fool a while back that may
cause some to avoid the stock completely. I wouldn't necessarily blame them.
The Chairman is shady, and there are some inter-company dealings that may be of
concern. For example, a management-led buyout offer at 4.00 was cancelled early
this year. However, the chairman has continued to buy stock, and the stock is
cheap on a fundamentals basis in my opinion.

Is anyone looking at LAB? On one hand, the lawsuits, investigations and overall
atmosphere is quite negative. On the other hand, the price seems quite low.
E.g. if we can expect ~13% ROE in the future (can we?), the expected return
would be very high.

I am somewhat interested, though I dislike stocks in this area. From my
experience, the future profits are very difficult to estimate.

I took a starter position in National Oilwell (NOI) today.

Good quarter reported. Stock still relatively low based on past p/sales and
p/bk numbers. Company should do okay (imo)as a broad-based supplier of oilfield
equipment and services (both land and offshore). Opportunities for stock price
improvement might occur if drilling acreage or depth are increased, and/or as
oilfield equipment is upgraded. I look for the stock (now about $19) to
once-again trade $25-28, say maybe within two years.

I also added a bit again to my small exploratory position in VIA.b. Here I
expect advertising rev's to pick up as the economy improves (I am hoping). Also
next year are the US presidential election and the olympics, which should add
to VIA.b's advertising revenues. Although some of Viacom's financial numbers
aren't so attractive (e.g. high p/e), Viacom is just so strong in so many areas
of the entertainment business that it's hard for me to see the stock cratering
(but it could!). The stock, now under $40, I will bet will be nearer $50, and
maybe better than that, by the end of '04.

Jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

I've trimmed back just a little on my NTZ position. Just for rebalancing.

I cut back on TFS. Although TFS has good p/sales and p/book numbers, I've
wanted to step back a little and evaluate why I'm holding my shares. There's
been the spin-off, the stock's no longer selling below cash value, and I'm not
sure exactly what their business is.

Several years ago I mentioned a potential asset play in a company named Alico

Hello again, Wayne Crimi. You had a couple of good value suggestions here a few
years ago.

I recently started an exploratory position in ALCO. Can't tell you though
anything more definitive than what's gossiped on Yahoo, and what might be in
company reports. For me ALCO is a "faith-based" investment. The big investors
(e.g. Marty Whitman's real estate fund) still hold big positions. I don't know
how he evaluates this company. He says (Barron's, 11/10/03), "We can buy into
an awful lot of well-financed, high-quality companies that are selling at
substantial discounts from readily ascertainable net asset values... (Real
Estate)is easy for us." I don't see how he applies this to ALCO because I don't
see where the data are to make concrete determinations.

The stock "seems" undervalued, but then again, its adherents have always have
always believed that. Possibly the inherent values (land prices) keep
increasing ahead of the stock price.

If I recall correctly, in past, companies like CTO and ALCO have gone for years
at relatively flat prices or very slowly rising prices, then there's been a
very positive piece coming from Barron's whereupon the stock has moved up 50%
or more within a couple of days. (And stayed up). This year we've seen real
estate operating companies (which is how I characterize ALCO) move up more
positively with the market.
There's a sleepy REOC thread which was started by mrcjmoney.

TALK looks too difficult for me.

Company says they'll have 34-36M net income next year. That looks like a very
attractive forward p/e of 7.8 on today's price.

That good number is offset imo by TALK's size and business model.

They are small relative to competitors. Multex says of TALK, "The major
carriers, including AT&T, Sprint Corporation, MCI/Worldcom, Inc. and the RBOCs,
have targeted price plans at residential customers (the Company's primary
target market) and compete with the Company." Plus, these land-line
companies--some people believe they'll go the way of dodo birds.

Might there be a key factor that I'm missing here?

Hi Paul,

Thanks a lot.

I still own my core position in Berkshire Hathaway.

Other than that, I've been doing a lot of selling.

I own a position in ABC (drug distribution) for awhile. I think the price is
still reasonable.

I own a small position in Velcro (Velcf) for a couple of years that I am only
very slightly positive on. It's been a disappointment to me. Earnings and sales
have been down for a couple of years and I can't really tell how much of that
is cyclical and how much is related to competition. Plus they had a portfolio
of stocks and bonds worth over $4 per share that shrank a little when the stock
bubble burst. I'm still holding, but I'm not too enthusiastic any more.

I own a position in LVLT in which I am under water about 30% in total (even
more on some shares). I moved outside my circle of competence (assuming I
really have one, ho ho) and it cost me. I like the story a real lot, but
telecom has been in complete meltdown for a couple of years and the company is
close to impossible to value.

I just made a very big score in RCNC junk bonds. Just sold them a few days ago.

I hate to admit this, but I've been putting some of my excess cash in gold and
silver. I became bearish on the US Dollar before Warren made his recent
announcement, but I wasn't sure which foreign currency or foreign currency fund
to invest in. So I bought some gold coins and some CEF.

I am searching for ideas too. Someone on another board mentioned farmland and
that made me recall Alico.

Re: TALK. While I agree with your concerns, I think the numbers that TALK
produces speak for themselves. While the local phone and LD market as a whole
is shrinking it is not going away for a long time and my bet is that a small
nimble company like TALK can thrive even in a very competitive environment.
Apparently it is thriving now and with the free cash flow number as they are I

Current p/e is under 14, with forward p/e now estimated (by Yahoo) about 11.4.
In past, stock has often sold at higher p/sales than current .13. I look for

Roy,

I'm struggling for ideas also. Someone on another board mentioned the PIMCO
fund to me also, but I haven't looked at it closely yet. I had some thoughts
about building a list of "big name" foreign companies to take a look at, but
most do a lot of business in the US. So I don't there's any huge advantage to
going that route. Maybe if I can find some small ones it would be OK, but
that's tougher.

KO, does a lot of business overseas, but it never seems cheap enough for me to
get involved.

There are also some foreign bond funds out there, but I'm not sure which

Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. But that was 30% or so ago.

This article - "Rules will shut up to 20 U.S. refineries - executives (say)" -

If true, these new rules could herald the way refinery stocks are valued by
investors looking to capitalize on the changes. Further, oil transport stocks
might gain (from additional imports from Europe, according to the article), and
so might some construction firms (refinery upgraders), as well as ethanol maker
ADM.

I presume people here who've bought stocks in these businesses when they were
discussed here are now holding profits on them. The article suggests to me that
there's still some reason to guess that additional gains might come with time.

I just havent went through the balance sheet or anything.

I mean, clearly they were under-reserving. Thats why I avoided the stock years

"Mr Jones, Please pay for your jewelry or please bring it back so we can try to
get 25% of what you owe us on it".

I have concerns about their Morgan Shiff connection and the conflicts therin. I
have concerns about just what a reasonable reserve would be. (Lots more than
14-17%)

The thing to do, I guess would be to figure out what various reserve levels
would have done to EPS and book value going back 5 years.

Then factor in a FORMAL SEC investigation, a suspended CFO and the dozens of
lawsuits related to their recent secondary at $15 and its clear they have a lot
of PAIN ahead.

Its just impossible to tell how much. All we can do is spend hours studying and
trying to make reasonable wild-assed guesses and then throw down our $$ and

Biomarin is a Biotech trying to find its niche in enzyme replacement therapies

BMRN has a drug already launched which is marketed with GENZ and several others

St. Paul to Buy Travelers in Stock Deal
Monday November 17, 5:06 pm ET
By Tom Johnson

NEW YORK (Reuters) - St. Paul Cos. (NYSE:SPC - News) on Monday agreed to buy
larger rival Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (NYSE:TAPa - News; NYSE:TAPb -
News) for $16.4 billion in stock, creating the second largest commercial
property insurer in the country.

The new company will have an unmatched presence among commercial line insurers
in nearly half of all U.S. states and boast more than $100 billion in assets
and $15.6 billion in combined premiums. Only American International Group Inc.
(NYSE:AIG - News) will be larger.

The deal also represents a homecoming of sorts for St. Paul Chairman and CEO
Jay Fishman, who once served as Travelers' top executive when it was still a
unit of Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C - News).

He has spent the last two years refocusing St. Paul on its core commercial
insurance business and bailing out of unprofitable lines like medical
malpractice. With the addition of Travelers, St. Paul will nearly double its
premiums generated from general and commercial underwriting.

St. Paul will retain the corporate headquarters and Fishman will serve as CEO,
while Travelers will gain a slight control of the combined company's board and
hold the chairman's position for the next two years.

"We're taking this opportunity to create really an extraordinary company which
exceeds the opportunities we'd have on our own," Fishman said in a conference
call with analysts and investors. "I can't think of any company that brings the
breadth of products of these two companies.

The combined company would instantly become the leading provider of commercial
insurance lines in 22 states and a top three provider in 43. The deal
essentially combines Traveler's strength in underwriting small- to mid-sized
general commercial companies with St. Paul's concentration in specialty lines
used by construction and oil and gasoline firms.

"Basically, what they are doing here is ... giving Jay Fishman and his team a
bigger, more dynamic vehicle to play with in the property and casualty arena
and doing it on a cost- efficient basis," said Michael Lewis, a UBS analyst.

Their results are impressive. Worth noting, however, that they have a team of
people for the 375 stocks they actually own and the 1100 they follow.

I agree 100% with their general approach - not dissecting companies down to the
last molecule to decide if they are worth holding. Number crunching seems to
take on a life of its own.

SM: You have 375 companies in the Al Frank fund. Is it difficult to keep track
of them all?

JB: No. We have three people who do research. We follow 1,100 companies in
total. I used to follow 900 companies, and it was just me. It's not that
difficult when you're doing the kind of research that we do. It's not rocket
science. So many people think you need to publish a 50 page research document
and visit the company and talk to suppliers and customers and all that stuff.
We don't do that. We don't need to. Those who actually do those things don't
perform as well as we do. If you take a view from afar and you don't get too
close to the situation, you can eliminate a lot of the emotion from the
equation and focus on the numbers. Our approach is based on what has worked
historically for equity investors, and that's buying undervalued stocks trading
at low P/E ratios, low price/sales ratios and low price/book-value ratios. It's
not as if we've discovered the magic formula and nobody else knows about it. We
have the patience and discipline to implement the strategy. The majority of

SPC looks attractive to me as well. In addition to the numbers you mentioned,
apparently the dealmaker and CEO, Mr. Fishman, is well-regarded by insiders.
And it looks like he's a good story for media reporters as an up-and-comer
Greenberg or Weill. That hype/image might add a glow to the stock- at least for
a while.

Since the deal is designed to be a "marriage of equals" and there's not much
arbitrage opportunity, I'll concentrate on SPC because I like that there's a
special extra cash dividend that will be paid to SPC holders to compensate them
for lowered dividend when merger is done.

I don't like stepping up for stock today, on a day when the market is strongly
up. Perhaps in a day or so SPC will digest some of today's gain and again be at
a more attractive entry point. That's just my personal nature speaking. The
stock's either undervalued with some decent margin or it is not. Up .8 or 2.3%
today shouldn't be enough to close a valuation gap that one perceives in
analyzing the stock. So at current price, the stock ought still be in bargain
territory. (One hopes.)

Paul et all,

Hope all is well going into Thanksgiving. Picked up some MRK recently as
valuations in pharma seem low despite the fact that I would contend that
earning growth will have to continue to decelerate across the long-term given
that all the big hitter chronic diseases have been sufficiently addressed.
Perhaps JnJ with its strong consumer product presence is a good bet as well.
Any thoughts on Big Pharma?

Sticking within healthcare, the genomics revolution continues despite the fact
that the stocks have gotten sizable haircuts. Companies like CRA and MLNM and
AFFX still stir some good volume, but the best play may be with INCY- with the
million dollar question being how valuable its extensive patent portfolio may
be (and can it monetize it in time).

Tough to find pure Warren B. plays at good prices in this market at present.

Keeping an eye on Colgate, INVN and FDP as well for what it's worth.

By the way, anyone ever hear of LandAmerica Financial Group (LFG)? Thanks.

Hi hoyasaxa.

About big pharma. I was and am buying based on rear-view mirror numbers
regarding p/e, price/dividend, profit margins. This has not served me well in
past couple-three years. I'm not competent to ascertain pipelines of these
companies; I'm not even sure that drug company analysts can evaluate the
pipelines. I have positions in PFE, MRK, BMY, JNJ, NVS in this area. Regarding:
"given that all the big hitter chronic diseases have been sufficiently
addressed", I'd say there are plenty of sick people who will strongly disagree.

Given the problems I have with drug pipelines and the relative lack of history
of genomics companies, I have generally avoided this area. I mentioned PKI a
year or so ago when they had some problems - they supply materials to this
sector - I still have my small position. I have a speculative holding in CEGE.
Also still holding some drug stocks that might be in the genomics/research area
that were mentioned here as below-cash plays (although they are now above cash
value).

And fwiw also, I hold small positions in Colgate, INVN and FDP as well. My most
recent purchase of INVN was $27+ at the beginning of the year; the stock's
another that's not participated in this year's market rally.

I don't follow LFG. I have CTGI, which I like because they operate in a booming
regional area, and they are a small enough player that they might be an
acquisition target. Apparently re-fi's are expected to diminish next year, so
CTGI, as well as LFG are expected to wear higher p/e's next year.

I still have LH which you mentioned here. The company is performing as you
suggested it might. I see no reason to sell the stock at this time.

RE: Companies trading below cash - have a good link to a screener for that
(they don't have that criteria when creating a screener through Schwab)?

Regarding the drugs, let me reiterate my position in a different manner. When I
write about the big ticket chronic conditions being addressed, I mean that
virtually all the big drugs have already been created. Conditions that effect a
lot of people- like heart disease, cholesterol, etc. - have there drugs
already. New drugs addressing these areas only and will only offer minor,
marginal improvement - or will offer one shot rather then ongoing revenue
streams, removing the 'chronic' from the condition. Now, drugs treating
smaller, niche markets will continue to proliferate. And new devices and
delivery mechanisms to treat older conditions will continue to be created. But
what will be the next Lipitors -- will there be enough of them be created by
these large pharmas to enable continued strong growth rates?

Appreciate your thoughts, as always.

I'll add a few more shares of SXT here.

Although the stock is trading at its historical low p/e level, SXT earnings
have fluctuated over the years (although up on average). So a down earnings
year could send stock price lower while still keeping the p/e within historical
ranges.

I'll close out shares of SLR held in a taxable account since bubble years. My
reason: to take tax losses to offset gains elsewhere.

It has been very costly to sell stocks in this market. So many stocks have
continued to move higher on investors after they have taken profits in their
positions. Opportunity losses might not be real losses, but as dollars
foregone, they hurt.

I doubled my BEL position on this dip caused by a rumor. Press release snip:

John Bennett, the Company's CEO and founder, said he was "surprised" by the
reports.

"We have no reason to leave New Brunswick," said Mr. Bennett. "Our project has
been subjected to intense scrutiny already through an Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) and what is being described as a full EIA by protest groups
would yield no additional information. We are proud of the local community
support and will never let them down."

Mr. Bennett also noted that the Company couldn't simply change its mind and
expand in Quebec. "If we want to expand the Saint Ambroise facility we will
have to go through the Ministry of the Environment and conduct whatever studies
it requires under the province's regulations as we did in the past and we would
be prepared to do that in the future."

The CEO concluded "it is ridiculous and irresponsible for anyone to suggest
that we can simply walk into any province and set up shop without meeting very
stringent regulations and scrutiny."

Real Estate Taxes in New York City ...

I am curious of the differences of real estate tax rates between different
states. Could everyone share what the rates are in their state and what the
rules are for re-assessments.

I live in California, so I will quickly summarize my state below.

We have something called Prop 13. So, if you purchased a home for $500,000 your
yearly tax rate will be approximately 1.2% of $500,000, or $6,000 per year.

After this initial amount is determined your tax will go up by 2% per year. So,
the following year it will be $6,120. The 3rd year it will be $6,242. Etc...

Your property will not be re-assessed until it's sold or if you put a new house
up on your land.

Please let me know the rules in your state.

I am particularly interested in the rates & rules in New York City.

Thank you in advance.

Paul -- Thanks for posting the link. It is reassuring to have someone with a
good track record agree with a less rigorous financial analysis methodology. I
have around 80 stocks (35 stocks and the rest REITs and preferred) and know
that I have too many to follow very closely. I also look at key ratios and
historical earnings trends and company outlooks without much critical review on
my part. I just try to pick cheap stocks that won't collapse with an economic
dip. Stocks that make something to sell or sell something tangible.

to "- with a K": I've looked more at BEL and am comfortable with my quick-buy
holdings. And I may add a bit more also. The company sent me copies of all the
analyst reports and it was more than I could handle. One report was 35 pages
but mercifully, only 10% numbers. They had three financial pro formas base
case, downside and best case. In US dollars -- base is $1.87 in 2005, best case
is $5.12 in 2007. Other analysts had the same in 2005 ($1.75 or so) so I think
the company is leading and helping them closely. I think there may be some
upside to the 2005 numbers based on the tone of the latest earnings
announcement and the solid backlog. I agree with the analyst who writes "the
market opportunities are enormous, while barriers to entry are huge..."

This weighty analysis pkg I rec'd in the mail on BEL relates to the link by
Paul, describing mind numbing analysis as overkill. (And I've been burned
relying on anaylsts, company IR departments, and even CFOs in the past (who
told me one thing on the phone and had a press release the next day describing
otherwise). No one knows what will happen and some people lie or are deceived.)
So an investor really needs to do his own analysis, but, is it really worth the
effort?...

Anyone riding the MAXS bubble? MAXS has taken quite a climb lately.

These are my rambling thoughts.

Several days ago there was a curious large one day surge in volume -- over
250,000 shares traded I believe.

I never was sold on the business or industry that MAXS operates in. But, MAXS
seems to operate well despite these drawbacks and despite a difficult economic
environment over the past several years.

I was cranking through a few numbers trying to determine what the real return
on assets and equity might be given the large amount of cash on the balance
sheet in hopes to estimate a value for the going concern*. I backed out $69
million in cash (they ought to be able to live on $77 million in working
capital) and $1.3 million in interest earnings and came up with $13 million in
earnings from core operations over $96 million in adjusted assets (excluding
the surpluss case). That results in a return on assets of about 13.5%.

I adjusted the equity (removing $69 mill in cash - that would be a nice
dividend!) and came up with roe of 15.6%.

Glass half full analysis: we haven't really seen yet what MAXS can do with the
tailwinds of economic growth behind them and, perhaps, another acquisition of
the like of Jones and David.

Glass half empty analysis: Management was really lucky through these difficult
times; Mgt makes an acquisition misstep and blows a large portion of
shareholder value; stock-option dilution continues at the rapid pace that it
has in the past; The economy tanks and people stop buying shoes.

Plusses: strong balance sheet; decent ROE and ROA on underlying business

*I ran out of time for now to estimate a range of values for the company.
Hopefully the stock price will continue rising while I try to figure out what
to do here.

Going through Harry Lew screens of stocks below cash, I find a few that have
some cigar-butt appeal to me.

As I've done before, I'll try to go for a package. And for Very small amounts
in each stock. If I get to understand the companies a little better I might be
willing to add shares -or close the positions if adverse information surfaces.
So far, I'm getting all my data from Yahoo, whose numbers sometimes are wrong
or mislead me.

Here are two stocks that I have small fills in this morning:

MTON. The company provides directory assistance services for telephone
companies. I believe the stock was mentioned on the Value Thread after MTON
lost a big contract when Sprint decided to do this service in-house. They may
have lost other contracts as well. I see now that within the past couple of
days MTON has been mentioned by several SI posters on other threads as a
(speculative) buy.

Stock price: <$2.00 and sinking
Cash/sh: 2.18
p/sales: .23
p/book: .31
p/e: na

Not really selling enough below cash to make me enthusiastic. (I've rejected
other stocks on Harry Lew's lists for this reason.) However, if MTON's business
model can be modified, the stock might recover. The company, with 5900
employees, might have the management talent and resources to do this.

AIK: "holds government-insured mortgage investments primarily on multi-family
housing properties, and distributes the payments of principal and interest on
such mortgage investments." From a cursory look, it seems they have about 12
investments, they've sold at least one recently, and they paid a large dividend
to stockholders. Perhaps the company is slowly liquidating itself. Looks like
the business is structured as a limited partnership. That means additional tax
paperwork for US investors. (ugh)

Stock price: $1.30
Cash/sh: 1.57
p/sales: 4.74
p/book: .33

Company pays a dividend. Apparently 1-cent monthly. Perhaps has some safety: "
The Partnership's investment in insured mortgages is comprised of participation
certificates, evidencing a 100% undivided beneficial interest in
government-insured multi-family mortgages issued or sold, pursuant to the
Federal Housing Administration programs, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed
by the Government National Mortgage Association and FHA-Insured mortgage
loans."

JMO, and I've been wrong many, many times.

A couple of microcap value stocks for those who dabble in such things

JLMC --- Maker of wedding accessories. Trading just above book. PE around 8.5.
No debt. Lack of trading interest (+ve contrary indicator in my opinion).

ISRL --- Oil/gas producer. An Israeli company, but majority of reserves in US.
Strong balance sheet/earnings I think, even factoring in related-party
investments/earnings that are questionable (lots of cash, marketable securities
plus decent cash flows from wells in US).

Negatives: Had recent unsuccessful well in Israel (see Yahoo board) that I am

Some stocks mentioned here that I put on my watch list and kept watching when I
shoulda been buying or holding. Any current opinions on these stocks now?

BAX. (I sold at 25, it's now 27.82). Mistake to sell? Stock still seems
overpriced to me based on historical numbers I looked at. But too much focus by
me on past years' performance, not enough on future??

ICPT. I'm still out. Earnings disappointment reported, but Chair./CEO is
planning to submit a bid to take company private. Stock ($10.57) has moved up
from the press release date(price was under $9)

SNV. I sold about $23; stock has climbed to $28.

SGH. A Wallace Rivers pick, I believe. Stock's maybe doubled since mentioned
here, but mostly flat since June; still provides a div yield over 11% though
per Yahoo. (Who says good capital gains and high dividends are incompatible?
-g- )

IBC. Have it on my list for couple years maybe. Wouldn't spring for shares when
price was much lower. Anyone with an opinion on the company/stock now?

IAL. A Buffet type. I sold my exploratory position. Stock now near annual high.
If US economic recovery on track, possible that IAL could see all time highs
of$30-35 or more again.

VC. A TimbaBear selection. In early Nov. Ford reported it was changing some
agreements with its spinoff, VC, to increase VC's potential competitiveness.
About a week ago stock popped substantially on brokerage upgrade. Stock down
today on news that CEO-elect won't take job. Still a nice gain from late Aug.
when stock was mentioned here (~6.45 to 8.43 now)

LVB: I'd guess this stock ought to be topping by now. There's got to be a
limited market for their piano's. (Or so I guessed when the stock was about
half its current $23/sh)

OSTK: This internet retailer of close-out merchandise really fluctuates on
news. CEO- Byrne the Younger- bought more in August. Stock up today on his TV
interview. (I am guessing this is the reason) Once again I look at the stock,
and it still looks too expensive.

TJX. A Grommit suggestion. From memory, I believe the stock's now up about 18%
since mentioned here. Strong company, forward p/e about 15-16. Might still be
worth a buy at current price, although it still seems expensive to me.
(Aside: I see HUG, also mentioned by Grommit at that time and others, has moved
up very strongly recently. Looks roughly like about 20 to 45 with last 10
points coming since October.)

KFT. (A Larry S. buy). Stock has moved away from me. If no surprise news and if
I can get it under $30 (now $31.67), I might start a small buy.

NWL. Several of us saying we're looking at this one. I'd still like to buy my
first shares around 20 or better. Stock is up only about 1 1/2 points from its
52-week low on 9/26. If next quarterly report is negative, I may get a chance
to buy at lower price. If report positive, I may have to raise my buy price if
I want shares.

XOM. Mentioned here, but no real interest. Maybe Exxon isn't a bargain, but
given its size (dominance) and current p/e and div. yield, it might still be
okay at current price for a conservative bet in the oil sector.

FIT. I mentioned it, but I was too hesitant. I missed my first price and
wouldn't step up a bit (15c more to $4.90) Dag-nabbit! Stock now at $5.61,
still below cash. I'm still watching for my price.

TE. Mentioned by Grommit last year. I'm out now, but would consider a return.
Difficult company to evaluate especially because they're in transition. In my
first foray I assumed dividend would not be cut further. Not so sure now. Stock
below stated book value (which maybe is meaningless).

Any comments about these stocks are welcome.

VC-- I'm still holding. Decent yield, cash flow seems to support the ability to
pay the dividend, still selling well below book value. I view this as a long
term hold (long enough to get to the top of the next auto cycle).

TE-- I'm out of TE as I did not like either the numbers nor the tone of their
last quarterly press release. It suddenly shifted the field for me to where I
expect the next major news story to be some major negative....defaulting on big
debt and/or stopping the dividend.

hi, paul prior to your post I added a package of stocks to increase my equity
exposure: KFT, NWL, SVM, RYN, RIG, DO and added to existing positions in CX, C.
Monday I'm adding to PFE, starting BMY and UU. I continue to trim the REITs but
not fast enough given their continued appreciation.

These moves reflect my belief that the global recovery seems real and
sustainable and that I should move in the direction of my normal investment
posture which is to be fully invested in common stock. Currently, I have
sizable positions in short-term bonds and cash. I too would prefer better
prices on these purchases, but I don't think I'm going to get them. I wasn't
jumping up and down at the purchase possibilities 1-2 years ago when I was
buying, and one can hardly be excited now with prices up 30+ percent.

I've exited my electric utility positions in AEP and TE purchased in 10/2002 at
52% and 12% total returns respectively. I will exit my 3/2003 buy of DUK as
well in 4/2004... currently, I'm sitting on a total return of 35% there. The
economic outlooks look just as bad now as then for these companies, and their
credit ratings have deteriorated since then.

I'm still holding and not adding to Safeway (SWY) which I have large losses in
(38%). I'm getting weary of betting against Walmart, but I'm not getting out at
these valuations. I've cut my expected earnings growth to 3% on it, so I may
lighten on price bounces.

With regard to my buys:
I added Rayonier to Plum Creek. RYN is REITing at the end of the year, dividend
yield should be comparable to PCL's. These are starter positions for me. I
would like to have substantially more money invested because I like the
businesses, but their recent economic performance is puzzling, and the
valuations seem miserly from a buyer's perspective.

I added United Utilities PLC, a regulated UK water and electric company. Senior
debt is rated a3/bbb+ by moody's/s&p. My dividend expection is $1.50 for a
yield of 8.7%. The company had a substantial rights offering early in 2003, so
beware.

I added Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol Myers (BMY). BMY yields 4.3% and I'm expecting
12% earnings growth at PFE. I accept the widely held belief that the pharmas
are priced reasonably. We'll see.

I added the drillers Transocean (RIG) and Diamond Offshore (DO). They have
pretty good balance sheets, but economic performance recently hasn't been good.
They are trading near 5 year lows. DO allegedly has mostly finished a
substantial CAPEX program freeing up future cash flow.

Regarding Kraft Foods (KFT): this seems okay to buy at with an earnings yield
of 6% if you accept management's expectation of 8% earnings growth and senior
debt rated a3. It's less appealing when you consider that earnings are only
supposed to grow 1.5 percent in 2004 and you're buying into a minority
ownership position to Philip Morris and you are vulnerable to Walmart squeezing
supplier margins further.

Regarding (Newell Rubbermaid) NWL: I don't quite get why earnings are supposed
to be flattish in 2004. For me this is somewhat of a faith investment in the
CEO, Joe Galli. Earnings yield is about 7%, dividend yield about 3.7%.

That's all for now. Again, these buys are more of a macro call on my part. I
don't really like the prices... I just can't find stuff I like better.

Hi, Brendan Watt. Thanks for the update. It's interesting, because I've been a
seller of some of the stocks you are buying. That makes me nervous.

Within the past year, I've sold out my substantial (for me) large and long-held
position in SVM. Imo, through several changes of poor management the company
has failed to capitalize on its strengths and its good cash flows. This has
caught up with the stock - it's not done much in the past three years. I
finally got tired of waiting, and I exited. For its strengths, the company does
have a business with possibly steady revenue and good cash flows from its
repeat customers, esp. w/lawn care. I've been hoping to re-enter the stock if
it drops ($11.20 now) to under $10 again.

Although I've substantially sold the majority of my out-size position in BMY
during the past 12 months, I still have a good position. I'm holding those
shares.

I trimmed my position in CX earlier this year. Quite possibly an error. Company
remains an aggressive, world-wide, very-profitable competitor. I will consider
adding if the stock drops.

I recently cut my position in SWY by about 2/3. I'm still holding all ABS and
KR shares (as well as VLGEA). Just don't like Mr. Burd's (SWY's Chair,CEO, &
Pres) hard-nose attitude against unions. Especially after his fiasco with
Dominick's acquisition, where he was responsible for losing so much SWY wealth.
Not a real logical reason for selling the stock now, during a strike, but I'm
selling down to a better comfort level for me. A sale for anger-reduction -g-.

I've recently seen RYN and PCL mentioned by some professional value investors.
(Oakmark??) I looked at both companies but I'm not enthusiastic. PCL is a large
landowner, and its timberlands will be more valuable over time, I expect. In
past, this stock has mostly traded on its dividend; so when they cut the
dividend last year, the stock dropped. I don't like abrupt dividend policy
changes, and when this happened I left. RYN, now trading near highs, didn't
look attractive to me. I'll re-look, and maybe I can ascertain if its
conversion to REIT status might further benefit the stockholders.

I'm looking at PFE again with a view to upping my small position if stock drops
some. Very positive PFE article in Barron's this weekend suggests to me the
stock will pop up - if only temporarily - on Monday.

In addition to large pharmas, the oil drilling sector, esp. offshore, is an
area that hasn't participated in the market rally. I have small positions in
TDW and DO (and recently added equipment supplier NOI). I'm considering adding
to DO which is at multi-year lows. (ref: Spekulatius' post here (15394)) I'll
look again at TDW. The three stocks' trading patterns appear to be correlated,
with TDW seeming to have less fluctuation, according Yahoo's %change graphs:

Forgot to mention that I took SPC off my watch list last week when I opened an
exploratory position.

RE Oil service:
The oil service group have been poor performers despite high oil prices, mostly
due to overcapacity from Capex programs dating back from 1999-2002, IMO. I do
not like DO that much any more, because of the fact that they will use a less
aggresive depreciation rates going forward. RIG seems a little better but even
more so I like GSF.

XOM is a boring but reasonable bet, IMO. The valuation is not really that
attractive for what I consider peak upstream earnings but the dividend is safe
and should support the stock.

Fool story on JNJ:

No Break for J&J

By Alyce Lomax
December 1, 2003

The Thanksgiving holiday didn't give Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) a break from
bad news. While many of us were stumbling about in a tryptophan stupor, word
broke that the pharmaceutical giant had to pull the plug on clinical trials of
its drug Procrit due to more blood clotting in patients than expected.

The trials were investigating the use of Procrit, which is already marketed as
an anemia drug, to elevate hemoglobin levels to get better results from
radiation and chemotherapy for cancer patients.

While clotting may seem like an alarming side effect of an anemia drug --
indeed, the news alarmed some analysts regarding Amgen's (Nasdaq: AMGN) rival
anemia medication as well -- the normal dosages used for anemia treatment
apparently haven't shown the same negative result.

However, finding another clinical use for Procrit might have helped boost
flagging sales, which have suffered due to competition from Amgen's and Roche's
anemia treatments.

Earlier last week, the company's stock was dragged down by the similarity of
its schizophrenia drug Risperdal to that of Eli Lilly's (NYSE: LLY) Zyprexa.
Lilly's drug (and J&J's, by association) was revealed to be about as effective
as an old drug for the disease, haloperidol, which is produced by generic
drugmakers at reduced prices. And we all know how insurance companies feel
about cheaper versions of drugs that are just as effective as the pricey ones.

All this bad news comes on the heels of an advisory letter issued by the Food
and Drug Administration in October that notified physicians about blood
clotting and deaths associated with J&J's Cypher drug-coated stent. While Dow
Jones said Tuesday that the FDA stated that blood clotting is a common side
effect of stents of all kinds, the deaths remain unsettling.

Also on Tuesday, Mylan Laboratories (NYSE: MYL) said it plans to launch a
generic version of J&J's Duragesic pain medication in July.

While investors may be tempted by J&J's recent low stock prices, the flurry of
news last week and in the recent past might warrant some pause. Procrit,
Risperdal, and the Cypher stent all represent major products for the company.
Procrit alone represented 11.8% of 2002 sales. These developments could shake
confidence in the sales potential of these products -- and in J&J's stock.
