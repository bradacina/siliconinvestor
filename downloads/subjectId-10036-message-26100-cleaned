Pricing pressure for sure. NOK market share leader, but losing some of it. If I
am correct, MOT is being overwhelmed by the number of new product introductions
from Nokia. MOT not doing too well with products coming out after RAZR.

With rapid product obsolescence and expanding third world cell phone users, IF
MOT engineers/product planners/marketeers can come up with some good product,
there ought to be enough room for MOT and NOK both to do okay.

(I currently have a few shares of NOK as well. My preference being to go with
market share leader.)

(I see AAPL iPhone as an expensive niche thing not much hurting NOK or MOT, but
I'm no expert in the sector.)

The shrinking ASPs are well known, and pretty much factored into the price IMHO

Thanks back to you, Carl, for your posting of TGB which I made some money on
last year based on your recommendation (not in it now, but thinking about it if
it falls again to the low 2's).

CET obviously has a concentrated portfolio, but as you point out they've made
money on that portfolio and are continuing to do so. Lots of long-term
money-makers.

I generally park money in SPY when I don't have enough other ideas, but CET
with the discount and strong record looks like another good diversification
play to put portions of money into regularly going forward. We'll see how it
does...

I had AHM on my watch list when I saw a 5000 share insider buy by a director.

Saw this on the yahoo board...

Friedman Billings notes that last night subprime originator NovaStar Financial
(NFI) reported disappointing 4Q results, which they say has weighed on the
stock performance of AHM in today's trading. The firm maintains that AHM is a
different story than NFI, due to: 1) AHM's prime / Alt-A portfolio; 2) lack of
REMIC securitizations; and 3) the fact that AHM already reported in-line 4Q06
earnings. However, firm says, investors should be prepared for the volatility
that they expect will come with owning mortgage-related stocks over the next
few quarters.

I looked at CET a while back although probably not as indepth as you.

What bothered me is the discount to NAV has been there for a number of years.

And they are SO damn concentrated. With ONE non-public company acccounting for
over 20% of their value.

But even after that one, they have a bunch of what I consider overconcentrated
positions.

Apparently Plymouth Rock gets yearly "valuations" from a someone supposedly
independent but I wouldnt put much faith in them. (They know who pays their
fee)

Apparently last year they valued it at 2.4 x book value even after a 20%
liquidity discount. I submit that since CET owns 20+% they would need to
further discount it.

The other possible issue is it seems it might not be good tax wise so buying in
an IRA might be the way to go.

Where did you read that Plymouth had a PE of 6-7 ?

I read a letter where they were earning less than 5% on their assets.

All their managers & directors are pretty old too.

The best thing is the long term track record and low expenses but they are just

Hello a128,

First of all, just to clarify, I don't think CET is a raging buy, but just a
good value to add to my IRA to achieve above market returns. So, to answer your
questions:

Yes, I'm aware the discount has been there for a while and has stayed pretty
steady. I guess that doesn't bother me given that the strong historical
performance of the fund has been maintained with this discount. It would be a
nice bonus if the discount was narrowed to zero or to a premium, but then I'd
probably sell and be out as it would be less of a value play.

Well, I'm less concerned with the Plymouth Rock investment because it seems to
have a solid earnings record and to be reasonably valued, in my view. Here's my
calculations:

From the 2006 CET annual report, it had $50 million in net income. From the
2005 Plymouth annual report it had cash flow from operations of $83 million and
a book value of close to $200 million on 182,911 shares outstanding.

From 2006 CET annual report, 70,000 shares valued at $133 million out of a
total 182,911 shares gives a value for the whole company at ~$350 million,
which is a market to book of 1.75 or so and a p/e of around 7. And that's using
2005 book which should be lower than 2006 book given the income generated.

So, that's why I'm not concerned about the concentration. I think this is
reasonable and the 2006 CET annual report seems to be aiming for $50 million
more income from Plymouth next year, which gives a $20 million share of
earnings (not that they will get this in a dividend, but still means something)
to CET or around $1/share for CET based on it's 20% investment.

So, that's why I bought a position, but it may not work out for me. We'll see.
I'm pretty diversified so I'm willing to take what I perceive to be good
risk/rewards which I think this one is. But, I appreciate the comments and
please point anything out that you think is wrong from my calculations.

Thanks,

cw

I Love Headwaters
By Jack Uldrich

February 9, 2007

Maybe it's because I live in Minnesota, home of the headwaters of the mighty
Mississippi River, that I am so smitten with Headwaters (NYSE: HW). The river
starts out small but quickly gains in size, and Headwaters has done the same.
In 1999, the company had only $7 million in annual revenue; by 2005, that
figure had swollen to more than $1 billion.

Like the Mississippi, which gathers strength from alternative sources such as
the Ohio, Missouri, and Arkansas rivers, I believe Headwaters will also begin
tapping into some nice revenue flows from different sources and gathering
similar strength.

Over the past few years, company management has done an excellent job of
diversifying itself away from its synfuel business, which has traditionally
provided the bulk of its revenues.

Its constructional materials business now accounts for 45% of its revenues. As
I explained in this piece last week, I don't think that portion of its business
will slow down anytime soon, as the environmental benefits of its products come
to be better understood by the market. And even if there is a slowdown,
Headwaters, which sports a very down-to-earth P/E ratio of a shade more than
11, should be able to remain competitive with the other large cement firms such
as Cemex (NYSE: CX) and Lafarge (NYSE: LR).

I also like Headwaters as an alternative energy play. Later this quarter, the
company is expected to bring an ethanol plant online in partnership with Great
River Energy. Ethanol is a risky play that has taken its toll on companies such
as Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE: ADM) and MGP Ingredients (Nasdaq: MGPI) since
last summer, but Headwaters has a slight advantage over these producers because
its plant doesn't rely on natural gas. Instead, it uses excess heat generated
from a neighboring coal-burning facility. This nifty little trick should allow
Headwaters to maintain a leg up on those other ethanol producers.

The real reason I am attracted to Headwaters, however, is because of its
involvement with nanotechnology. Like a small tributary flowing into a big
river, this emerging "science of the small" isn't yet contributing much in the
way of revenue to the company, but I suspect this will soon change.

According to company officials, a couple of major oil refineries are
investigating its proprietary nanocatalysts to help them convert heavy
bottom-of-the-barrel oil into lighter and more valuable crude. If the
technology is successful, it will keep revenues and profits flowing for a good
long time.

What's sending Fools' hearts aflutter? Go back to our intro page to see what
else we have a crush on.

Fool contributor Jack Uldrich owns stock in Headwaters, which is a Motley Fool
Rule Breakers recommendation. Cemex is a Stock Advisor pick. The Fool's

There are couple possibilities:
- Insiders paying out themselves a nice cash wad without releasing control of
their shares. Maybe mildly bullish, maybe not.
- Anti takeover. Neutral.
- Getting leveraged to the industry norm, so the company can be more easily
compared to others. Neutral to bearish.
- They had bad quarter, but they expect good things in the future, so smart
management telegraphs this by saying: "we pay $15 from credit, but we know that
we can pay back the credit facility easily in the future"
- Management are idiots, scumbags, etc.

Thanks, I've been wondering about SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies)
and why they're so attractive to value people like Seth Klarman, others.

I still don't get it, but from what you linked, there are some nice links and
stock ideas in there.

These dry bulk shippers seem to be on a role. I missed BULK (a/o today symbol
NM), some others.

Mr. Klarman apparently holds SEA. If this is a typical SPAC (if there is such a
thing as typical), there was a warrant attached to the stock. So maybe original
investors have the better of it compared to people coming in now (who don't
automatically get the warrant)??

Difficult for me to understand. But I'm interested in these: SEA (for bulk
shipping), SHA (I'm looking to put money into Shanghai), and IGC (ditto for
India).

Anyone here with info regarding these companies (if that's what they are) and

re CHK - not much positives beyond the headline earnings number

1) Cash flow negative yet again.
2) Please note that based on CHK PV10 valuation of 10B$ and adding noncore
assets of 2.8B$, the company is substantially overvalued with an EP value of
22.8B$.
3) Why more and more noncore assets?
4) Reserves per share are down YoY (18MCFE/2006 versus 18.75MCFE/2005)
5) Sharecount up increased from 400M shares to 490M shares YoY
6) Finding costs are understated. how can they have finding costs of 2MCFE when
they have 2.4$/Mcfe DDA expense?

This company capitalizes costs, nothing else. This is an example where the
headline earnings are meaningless, IMO. Management is empire building with no

SPAC. Okay, I can see where one buys the expertise of the management team.

They are compensated by the cheap warrants they get (20% of investors' money),
and the deals they do have to be approved by shareholders.

I'm still not sure how aligned their interests are with small shareholders.
Perhaps the checks/balances make them aligned very well indeed. Just seems like
they take lots off the top with little of their own money in the game, and
investors still absorb a lot of risk.

To me, it's not so much who does the deals. I don't know much of Michael Gross
of the management team. I watch George Soros stock trades occasionally, and I
dismissively describe them as trades, ----in-out in dozens of stocks at a time.
I don't know what he's doing or how he does it now, but his trading 'schemes'
do not look all that profitable to me. (But they may be.)
In any case, these guys are pretty smart and savvy. I am getting the feeling
I'm going in with them in a poker game and I'm the one looking around wondering
who the patsy is. (Buffett has that answer. -gg-)

The way I look at it, if these deals are good, who are the value investors who
are actually buying the stock and when? Are they getting IPO prices, or, like
me, are they buying later? On the one hand, some of these deals must (maybe) be
okay: Seth Klarman has taken sizeable positions in several, if not many. I'm
looking at SEA --- perhaps wrongly though in that I'm looking at the sector
where the purchase will be made (bulk shipping) vs. who is doing the deal ---
and I see Marty Whitman (of 'safe and cheap') is an owner of shares. But 23.5K
shares worth maybe $225k doesn't seem like much of a conviction. Well, there
are other institutional buyers, but I don't recognize them.
----------
Thanks for your opinion and stock ideas.
At this point I'm still way too ignorant to be making any SPAC bets. Jmo; these
things could work out very well for an astute/lucky buyer. I don't feel that's
me.

Based on my research on Marathon, the downside risk (i.e. no deal is
culminated, the warrants are worthless, and the shareholders are redeemed) is
between 10 and 15%, while the potential upside is on the order of 100% in an 18
month timeframe. Because of these payout odds, and the fact that the stocks
don't move much prior to a deal being announced, many hedge fund managers see
SPAC units as a form of "enhanced cash" (I know, people always put adjectives
in front of "cash" at the height of a bubble). You are correct-this is a
speculation rather than value investing per se. MAQ/U is a small position for
me.

One of the things I looked at is the underwriter. Underwriters get a share of
units of a SPAC. Most SPACs seem to be underwritten by small firms that also
sponsor OTCBB stocks, which seems a bit shady to me. MAQ, on the other hand,
was underwritten by Citigroup, Dekania was underwritten by Merrill, and Union
Street was underwritten by BoA. Again, no guarantee of success, but I am
willing to speculate that the bulge bracket firms are less likely to underwrite
something with little chance of success.

what would be the purpose of GMR borrowing more money from their credit
facility to pay a one time dividend? anti-takeover? not sure what other purpose
this would serve.

I'm still thinking about your question. It is a great question that I don't
have a ready answer to.

Listening to the questions posed and answered at the end of their conference
call I came away thinking that they would sell the company if they had the
right (to them) offer, so I don't believe the dividend was a form of
anti-takeover.

I also don't see the buying back of 18% of their stock in 2006 coupled with
paying better than $3.00/share in dividends as being anything that I as a
shareholder object to.

The unanswered question is why the borrowing of the money needed to pay the big
one-time dividend and, sadly, I must admit I am unable to answer the "why" of
it just yet. Somewhere in the back of my mind is something niggling at me
regarding a valuation technique for buying a company that is a combination of
debt and equity and an argument I read long ago regarding the logic of higher
debt in those situations......

I'll give it more thought and if I come up with anything I think holds merit as
an answer, I'll share it here.

I thought about it and I thought it was a bit antitakeover, since the existing
shareholders get a lot of money, while the remaining company is less
attractive.

But, on the other hand, the valuation will drop by $15 per share after
dividend, so takeover could be done at a lower valuation (theoretically), so
maybe it's not anti-takeover at at all. Maybe that's what you are thinking
about: If pre-dividend the company is valued at (let's say) 40 per share and
takeover would have to happen at (let's say) 45 per share, then after dividend
the company would be valued at 25 per share and takeover would have to happen
at only 30 per share. Yes, the buyer will have to assume GMR's debt, but for
stock/control they are paying $15 per share LESS. So maybe it actually
ENCOURAGES the takeover?

My head is starting to spin... :)

a128,

Regarding FSP --- it has seemed like a good value versus other REITs, and it
continues to get cheaper relative to other REITs, with REIT index skyrocketing
and this not making any headway. Looking at a chart, I see 15-18%
underperformance vis-a-vis the REIT ETF IYR this year.

Is the yahoo earnings estimate of 0.85 correct? Does anyone have an FFO or AFFO
estimate for next year? If a dividend cut ever gets into the works this
potentially moves from a value to a value trap. The press release indicated
continued growth, but I worry somewhat when capital gains are necessary to
partially cover the dividend. I will listen to the call when I get a chance.

Im not sure FSP is cheap based on an AFFO multiple compared to other REITS.

Their dividend is higher than most.

And their lack of debt makes it more conservative.

The 2 things that bother me are in an investor presentation last year, mgmt
tried to convince listeners than their gains should be considered in addition
to AFFO but apparently, the street doesnt like one time gains...even if they
recur pretty much every year.

The other thing is....Im afraid they may be shooting themselves in the foot
with every new private placement securitization. Apparently, they have a really
large % of investors in these syndications that buy again & again.

And later on when FSP buys them out for stock, Im afraid they SELL their FSP
stock to invest in the syndications. (Apparently higher risk deals, untill FSP
buys them for their own portfolio)

As Paul mentioned, the insider buying is a positive here but mgmt sounded a bit
frustrated that the stock wasnt getting the valuation they expected.

I feel pretty confident their current dividend will not be decreased. (I was
hoping it would be increased but it doesnt sound like it)

Not sure where you got 85 cents from. They earned $1.65 versus $1.32 the prior
year.

They said to look more at FULL year over year earnings (as opposed to
quarterly) because they never know which quarter gains on sale might occur.

regarding CHK the PV valuation is based on 5.65$ NYMEX price. At this price the
PV10 value of CHK reserves is 10B$ after tax. i do not care what they state in
their presentation, this is what is is, their CFO and CEO has signed the 10K.
They are stating in their earnings release that 0.1$ NG price differential is
equivalent to 350M$ (I assume pre tax). So if we concur that NG now is 2$
higher than it was on 12/31) than we can 7B$ pre tax to the NPV which is at
most 5B$ post tax. So if we add those 5B$ to the 10B$(12/31) NPV plus other
assets 2.8B$ I arrive at 17.8B$ which is still substantially less than 22.8B$
EV value.

Regarding spending 2.4B$ and selling for 7.75B$ - this again is managements
math and does not match the cash flow statement and the balance sheet. CHK has
embedded cost of 2.5$$/mcfe in the ground, that is their historical finding
cost, mow you need to add production cost (0.81$/mcfe) and mnay other expense
that add up to about 2.15$/mcfe. So it means that they have a total cost of
4.65$/mcfe.

Anyways, i do not want to go into too much detail but my point is that you need
to cross check what management says with what's going on with the balance sheet
and the income statement.

For me at least the verdict is that the numbers don't add up, that why i don't
own CHK.

The numbers dont add up to me either. I think the stock is going higher in 12
months, as they increase their proved reserves to satisfy skeptics like you.
You are also assuming pretax if not
you are looking at 19.8 vs 22.8 without given them credit for all the time
,effort, and resources spent acquiring acerage that they havent drilled yet.
Lastly you give them no credit for hedging, management savvy, size , or proven
ability to grow this business.

With regard to their margins, they have choices to produce more or less gas
dependent upon current pricing and hedging.

The FSP analyst estimate summary is here

It may be FFO an estimate (as opposed to earnings), since FFO seems to be the
key metric for REITs. Yahoo is not the best source for these things (although
you can't beat the price).

I'd love to get a copy of the Oppenheimer research report on them.

OT: John Carragher. regarding: 2M or more COSI shares held by Alydar people
under various entities. I see that, although I'm not sure if that's the point
of your post.

Alydar doesn't give me much confidence. They're a successor to a failed hedge
fund from what I see. Maybe they learned from earlier mistakes; maybe some of
the same people have just continued on in new entity. I don't know.

I see from Alydar filings they own pages of stocks. Difficult to access from
that their best ideas or tactics. COSI apparently one of hundreds within a
diversified portfolio. Okay. Same as me.

I bought my shares after seeing it recommended by one of the Tocqueville fund
managers. These guys, imo, specialize in buying way-out-of-favor, cheap stocks.
Apparently, COSI fits enough of their buy parameters. Hard for me to see that
though-- stock looks very iffy to me: never a full year profit, always losses;
not enough balance sheet assets to give a margin of safety. It's a bet that the
new management team can build the company. Since I don't know COSI management,
stock can't be a value play to me. Only a very speculative buy.

OT: Secretive defense contractor company SAIC (SAI) recommended in an interview
in this week's Barron's:

"Our ratio of short sales to long ideas is about 3 to 1, but we like to do long
ideas. We published a report on SAIC (SAI) in January. SAIC is the largest
pure-play federal information technology services company. It has about $8.1
billion in revenue. Until recently it was 100% employee-owned, and it went
public in October at $15 a share. It's four times the size of its nearest
pure-play competitor. It has huge expertise and more than half of its 44,000
employees have security clearances. Security clearances are extremely valuable.
They are very hard to get and this creates a very high barrier to entry for
companies competing with SAIC. As a result, SAIC wins many contracts with the
Department of Defense and the U.S. Intelligence community. It has a very nice
business model because it has very low capital spending requirements and
generates lots of cash flow.

Why did it go public?
It gives the employees a chance to cash out, which is one of the problems with
the stock: there is going to be an overhang weighing on the shares as employees
sell the stock. However, this is a company with 37 consecutive years of revenue
growth and profitability and it wins about two-thirds of the contracts it bids
on and wins about 90% of its re-bids. As a public company, they have an
opportunity to substantially increase their Ebit (earnings before interest and
taxes) margins, which have run about 6.8% whereas the other players in the
industry have margins more like 8% or 9%. There is a strong incentive to drive
the margins higher. We project that Ebit margins should reach about 8 1/2% in
the next three years.

Is there more to the story?
It also has about $600 million worth of real estate on the books. It has a $14
billion backlog. We think they'll earn about $1.02 a share for this year and
about $1.30 in free cash flow. Next year they'll show a decline in earnings
because of dilution from stock options. We estimate they'll earn 90 cents a
share for the year ending January 2008 and then the following year $1.17 a
share in earnings. It has extremely stable growth characteristics and it should
get a premium."
--------
Still looks like an iffy gamble to me though. Their size and clout (with their
secret clearances and record of winning repeat orders) may already be
adequately reflected by the current p/e (i.e. it's no obvious bargain stock.)
I'll hold on to my recently purchased few shares though for a while longer.

UCTT hit 12.24 on 2/13. Here we are 7 trading days later and that swing from
high to low was over 30%. New all time high Friday. One reason I think that
some of the picks are OK, but that type of volatility is tuff for most to play.
Overall, at less than 1X sales, and over 500% growth comparison year to year on
a quarterly basis its tuff to say its a bad one. But the IBD monicker makes it
alot less interesting for me because the traders are constantly chewing and
chomping at them. Nothing wrong with the quarterly numbers and progressive

Aruze has been dropping like a rock in tokyo. its still worth less than its
interest in WYNN but management has some real credibility issues. They recently
released a revised forecast for the 3/31/07 fiscal year and they are now
estimating revenues almost 50% less than what they forecast in 11/07 about 8
months into the fiscal year. I just found that incredible and sent them an

Basing buys on analysts' estimates is very dangerous. I am hoping even if

prior to them being actually earned from the sale of assets. Some of the profit

prepaid and of course loan loss reserves and hedging of interest rate risk
enter into it too. I thought about selling my small stake this a.m. but I have
