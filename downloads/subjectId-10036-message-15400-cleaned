Regarding Fleming:

"...I'm not letting the amateur short sellers scare me out of this one. Be
brave, own Fleming!..."

Longleaf management repeatedly has stated that the Kmart issue is already (pre
9/6/02) reflected in the stock price. The 9/6/02 WSJ Front Page paints a very
ugly picture about Fleming the company. Customers are leaving due to management
business practices. It appears to me that the short-sellers -- and net sellers
-- were quite competent in selling Fleming. I am definately not brave -- rather
cautious -- in my stock selections. The WSJ article is a must read for Fleming
shareholders.

Fleming Takes Hefty Deductions From Grocery Suppliers' Bills

"...Fleming's vendors complain that the grocery distributor is taking what they
say are exaggerated deductions from their bills, spotlighting the tug-of-war
that goes on in the low-margin businesses of manufacturing, distributing and
selling grocery products to independent supermarkets..."

I did read the WSJ article, and don't think there is anything new or shocking
about their assertions. Fleming is in a highly competitive business, and the
arcane deduction system seems to be an industry standard. When your net profit
margin is less than one percent, you have to play a tough game. It's true the
company lost some customers, but it gained others, and sometimes resumed
business with the formerly estranged customers or suppliers. Sales have
increased over previous years every Q since 2Q 2001. Fleming recently released
letters from Solo and Unilever stating that the article did not represent those
companies current satisfactory relationship with Fleming. Keep in mind they
supply 12,000 outlets. How could they not lose some customers every quarter?
When you have 18 billion in annual sales, losing 100M of business is not much,
especially when you replace more than you lose. As for suppliers, anyone
remember the conflict between Rubbermaid and Wal-Mart? There was some very
tough talk as I recall as WMT pressured for lower prices and Rubbermaid made
counterthreats. It's interesting that WSJ had to dip into the past and mine old
news to come up with a sufficiently negative article. Perhaps someone told the
reporter that FLM's stock was down, so find some reasons why. Some shorts have
indeed made money, and I don't begrudge them. Same thing in Allied Capital
(ALD) stock. Good company getting a trashing by the shorts. I think it only
works well in a bear market, where fear and uncertainty help the cause, and
only in the short run. When general confidence returns the longs will profit.

FLM had a very unfavorable article in the WSJ about unjustified cash deductions
it charges its supplies. it is interpreted as the action of a company in
distress resorting to unfair business practises. Some food producers started to
sue them. Sorry i have access to the print version only. Someone with access to
the WSJ online version maybe a able to find the article.

After reading this article FLM does not sound like a company I would invest in

re: Fleming

"Good company getting a trashing by the shorts."

Hopefully Fleming goes up to $40 as you suggested. I respect Longleaf and they
are/were (who knows if they still own it today?) comfortable with the holding a
few months ago.

I have my own opinion on the issue of "shorts" destroying good stocks. Shorts
don't destroy a stock on other than a very short-term basis. Shorts are short a
stock for a specific reason. Shorts create a future-buyer and require the sale
at an uptick.

If someone tells me that short-sellers are causing a price decline, I am
inclined to short the stock myself assuming this is what longs believe. I have
no position in Fleming so I wish you the best.

http://www.asensio.com/SolvExCorp/solution.html

"...Short sellers have none of the disadvantages of regulators or plaintiff
attorneys. Short sellers possess, or have an incentive and ability to obtain,
highly detailed industry and company specific information. There is no
substitute for the profit incentive. However, by imposing much-outdated rules
our capital markets restrain short selling unnecessarily. Short sellers are
obligated to borrow shares and sell them only on up-tick trades. This often
creates situations where short sellers are forced to borrow shares directly
from the stock promoters and sometimes have to sell their borrowed shares right
back to the very same stock promoters. In effect, the short selling borrowing
requirement creates a monopoly for the illegitimate stock promotion.

There is a large and clear economic basis supporting the argument in favor of
equal rights for short sellers. Stock promoters have no limits on the amount of
stock or price they can pay to buy shares. Stock promoters are free to buy
stock at higher and higher prices without regard to up-ticks. Short sellers
should have the same rights. Short Sellers must be allowed to sell as much
stock as they want and at any price as long as they are financially
responsible. The short seller borrowing requirement and up-tick rule must be
abolished in the interest of better, more efficient markets..."

Correction to Fleming volume figure I gave earlier. Looks like I added a zero
in my haste. Volume for last week should have been about 16 million shares, not
160. That makes more sense, though it's still more volume than in a typical
month and the market was closed Monday. And volume has been much heavier this
year and last than it was in the decade preceding. Sorry, I'll try to get my
figures straight in the future. Also, I don't mean to come across as one who
believes short selling should not be allowed. It's a free market, so let the
shorts have at it. There's no need for long term owners to be disturbed by
their activity. The shorts may even create a nice buying opportunity. Thanks

re: grocers and food distributors: 
As regards FLM, for me right now, the only question is do I just hold or do I
add more? For now I'll hold.

I have a bunch of food retailer stocks and they mostly seem to be in a funk.
ABS, SWY, KR, SMF, SPTN, couple others. In past years I would've guessed that
in a recession, food stocks would do better than they have been. However,
there's been so much competition among small and large -- we now have
overstored locations it seems. And significantly, the business has been
Wal-Marted too.

The only related business I see that I find really attractive is Costco. The
stock's on my watch list, and even though I can envision the business's
continuing growth, that already seems built into the high (imo) price of the
stock. The stock's come down, but it's still expensive, imo. I am considering
buying a bit though if it drops a few more points.

Don Earl, A very difficult question you asked: an opinion on the most solid,
most beat up, most undervalued. I don't know that I can pick them out or limit
it to five choices. Not sure I even want to try.

Did you not say, or perhaps I am inferring, that you use this site for ideas
for shorting? If so, does this not mean, since I'm posting the most stock
ideas, you're using me for a source for buying puts? (Sigh), That could be
working out quite well now for you.

Not the purpose I'm intending to serve, but at least somebody might be using
stock picks here to make money -g-.

-------

I'm adding to my position in URS today. It's beat up plenty (But not most
beat-up to me--I'm adding today at new annual low price, but that's still
higher than my first purchase price); it's pretty undervalued (The p/e is low,
as is p/sales and p/book); it's not most solid though, because d/e is 1.7. My
dilemma is that I own URS, I'm buying more today, yet I'm reluctant to include
it in a list of most beat up, undervalued, and solid. So either I'm foolish to
buy such a stock which I can't say with certainty is even in my own top five,
or else, there's maybe nothing that I can mention - they all have warts that
would keep them off such a list.

I've also added a bit today to my losing position in BAY. Given its size and
business history, relatively little debt, being a pharma/chem below stated
book,at a new low, I'll guess and place it on the list. (There's your put
candidate! -g-)

Paul,

<<<Did you not say, or perhaps I am inferring, that you use this site for ideas

I think the only company where I've actually bought puts after seeing it
mentioned here was PHSY. Otherwise, any comment was probably an observation
that most of the "value" picks I was seeing for awhile kept getting to be
better values after they were mentioned. At the same time, I've seen a few
companies mentioned that really did strike me as seriously under valued. I know
you follow a lot of different companies, and that your strategy is basically
value oriented. I guess I was curious if you had a handfull of favorites, or if
you had a few where the current price didn't make sense based on fundamentals.

There are a lot of things about the market and the economy that have me more
than a little bearish at present. For example, today's report on consumer debt
levels has me scratching my head in pure wonder that the Dow didn't drop
several hundred points. Add that to a 5.7% unemployment rate, record level
bankruptcies, defaults, delinquencies and foreclosures, and well... I just
can't get too excited about owning stock right now. At the same time I'm
bookmarking a few things for a wish list if the market eventually forms a
bottom.

Don Earl, I don't really have favorites right now. And as you point out some of
these value stocks are becoming even better value stocks. So maybe the prices
do make sense if it's the fundamentals that are wrong. And I can get those
fundamentals very wrong: I continue to hold several that that have become
pennies away from bankruptcy. Not to mention the ones I believed to be
fundamentally undervalued that have subsequently already gone under (bankrupt).

Scanning through my holdings, here's my list of five. (-g-) If I didn't already
have positions in them, I'd be a buyer of them at current price. (and I am

Hi Paul

OK...my list is pretty boring, I've only added one since last time (which
supports my theory that this market is still way over valued
generally)....TRCI, TUG, XNR, FRD, CCL, GLG(the new kid).

TRCI and TUG and FRD are undervalued, good management and good cash flow
selections, which pay dividends while I wait for Mr. Market's attention to come
around to them.

XNR is a management play.

CCL is the largest and most profitable cruise ship operation. They pay a
dividend and also give $50/person/cabin on-board credit for each cruise a
shareholder takes. With my wife, that's like a big extra dividend! (We just got
back Sunday from another cruise...this one on the MS Maasdam, a Holland America
ship)

GLG is my play on gold. They are US-based, so I'm familiar with the GAAP, and
they have nice free cash flow.

OT: Costco and my wife are giving me tsures (trouble)

Given that I own the big three grocery retailers KR, SWY, ABS, plus a couple of
dink regionals, plus food distributor FLM, and with NAFC on one of my watch
lists,

My wife and I seem to be mostly patronizing (by $$ spent) Costco. Recently it
seems even for just cakes, it's been Costco rather than any local bakery or
grocery retailer.

Also getting to me is that when I go to Costco, even in non prime-time hours,
the number of shoppers is still much greater than my neighborhood ABS or SWY
stores during their prime times. (Of course the COST warehouse is so much
larger and draws from a greater distance, and this is all anecdotal evidence
anyway.)

Still,

I... have... succumbed.

I've started a position in Costco. It's no value stock. I'll mention it here,
then if need be, move discussion over to the Buffettology thread. (Mr. Munger
is on the BOD of Costco, someone has said??).

Stock's trading about where it was three years ago. Sales and earnings have
risen:

http://quicken.com/investments/seceval/?cmetric=rev&p=cost

D/e which had been trending down, is up this year, but at .23 (per Yahoo),
seems reasonable to me for a company still very much in an expansion phase.
(Maybe that's why ROE is 'only' about 13%.)

Looks to be the old story: what's attractive is expensive.
I'll step up to COST at current price. Just has become very difficult
psychologically for me to be holding on to the grocery retailers I have without
having Costco. That siren of Costco's growth and profit and our shopping
experiences there are just too enticing.

Nice comparison charts on oil service stocks, Spekulatius.

I'm still trying to sort through. I'm trying to weigh RIG against DO. DO with
its more aggressive depreciation might have a book value closer to real value.
It's selling for 2x book. RIG on the other hand, at $20/sh, is below its stated
book value of $30/sh.

Doesn't seem to make much difference regarding the trend in their stock prices.
Looking at the Yahoo charts for RIG and TO, they seem to be very correlated. If

Oil service stocks-
Paul you are right, timing is everything with oilservice stocks, the fortunes
of the stocks in this sector are closely correlated. Right now the price of oil
is high but nevertheless the oil service stocks are near lows. This is because
the oil companies are spending only reluctantly maybe in expectation of lower
prices in the future. Given the current economic climate this is a reasonable
assumption.
Disclosure: I sold my small DO trading position today.

However LT management does make a difference. I like the fact that DO's
management accepts the business reality that their business is cyclical. I also
like the fact that they are conservatively managed with net cash in the bank,
and a big chunk of the debt is due in 30 years and carries a 1.5% interest
rate. This company is very unlikely to have negative headline use due to funky
accounting etc. Their net assets would very likely fetch more than book value
if liquidated due to aggressive depreciation (they sold one rig in 1999 with a
gain). I also believe that they have the financial strenght to profit from
distressed market conditions by buying assets on the cheap (as they have done
in 1998).
RIG on the other hand is very acquisitive, and has a sizeable debt (even though
it appears very manageable right now). So this is why i believe that DO is the
better bet given the current bear stock market that we have right now.

* LEHMAN: Expect Negative July/Aug Global Comps (-2 to -3%) w/ US -2 to -3% (vs
guidance for Up), Europe up +1-2%, Asia/Pac -8 to -10%, Canada; Flat & LatAm;
-3 to -5%
* MERRILL: 3Q update is scheduled to be announced on September 17. We expect it
to include another slight comp decline in the U.S. for the first two months
(reminder, 3Q is the last quarter of comparison challenges) continued success
in Europe and SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN ASIA. Although the company bested
Street expectations the last two quarters, investors have remained on the
sidelines due to concerns about the soft U.S. comps.

If both of the above are true, then compared to last year, they're down 9%, but
they're flat with last quarter. I recall something about lower prices in Japan
stimulating sales, after ``mad-cow'' concerns had hurt saies there [now
recovering from that issue in Europe].

Do you agree with the idea that they are sacrificing speed of service, a
critical element in customer preference, IMO, for less important differentiated
offerings?

I agree absolutely. Not only that, they are instituting systems which
marginally improve food quality but are much more prone to breakdowns. The new
shake machines are a good example. They do make a better shake, but half the
time they're not working. When they are working, the flavors from the last
shake tend to bleed into the new one, meaning the shake has to be thrown out
and a new one made.

One common suggestion is that MCD should offer "breakfast all day", which
sounds like a great idea. The response has supposedly been that breakfast
requires a different grill which has to be broken down before they can do the
rest of the day's offerings. That is probably true, but if they had spent all
their time and money coming up with a solution to that problem instead of that
Rube Goldberg inspired "Made for You" system, they would have actually improved
the operation instead of throwing sand into the gears of a money machine.

MCD has no problems that couldn't be solved if we could get Ray Kroc's ghost to
return for about a week.

''Philippine fast food chain Jollibee is another good example of how flexibly
adapting a Western model to Asian tastes can reap outstanding success.
Jollibee's founders copied the McDonalds format religiously, but modified the
menu to take into account the local penchant for sweeter and spicier
hamburgers,
and offered non-burger choices such as chicken and Filipino dishes. Jollibee
has beaten McDonalds at its own game, and is now the country's largest fast

chain, with sales of more than US$300 million and over 550 outlets.''

I'll suggest there are two issues:

1. Is this business or reit sector cyclical? I'll say yes, the hotel business
has had ups and downs over the past many, many years. I am guessing that
although 9/11 has affected all kinds of travel, the cycle for hotels has
neither been repudiated nor irreparably damaged.

2. If we're in a cycle, are we near lows, ie. low for a value stock buyer? I do
not know, but at current price, FCH sells well below stated book and pays a
reinstated 4% annualized dividend yield. At a price of $14.35/sh, the stock is

For those who believe that valuations are presently low the following is from
Rap's thestreet article:

"Turning to the other side of the balance sheet, rather than look at P/E ratios
when considering the big sweep of things, I have often preferred to talk about
market cap compared with GDP. For those not familiar with that ratio, at the
peak in 1929, it was 75% to 80%, and it never rose above 100% until 1996. In
fact, this ratio had only surpassed the high 70%s for one quarter, briefly, in
1968. (This information also comes from the most recent monthly piece by the
Leuthold Group.) Where we stand today is that market cap to GDP is about 100%,
down from a peak of 160%, plus or minus, in March of 2000. Obviously, one could
look at a chart and see in some cases that the market has corrected to 1996
levels. But one should remember that on this basis, there was nothing cheap
about 1996.

Of Median Strips and Accidental Reports: People sometimes like to take the tack
of asking, what is the median for the market-cap-to-GDP level? Since 1926, that
is about 51%. So if we were to trade back to the median, the market would get
cut in half. Now if one looks at a chart of this, as I have over the years, one
sees that the market only accidentally trades at the median. It tends to trade
way above it, or way below it. My gut feeling is that considering our recent
period of insane overvaluation, we could have a period of quite cheap stocks,
but it doesn't have to work like that. In any case, there's the math. Based on
this ratio, stocks could become far cheaper, which is obviously what I believe
and have been saying."

I also bought a starter position in GENZ. I have owned thos stock several times

On the other hand AZ seems to be sinking like a stone after their announcment

believe that insurance will come back after the 9/11 disaster and AZ should
profit from a rebound. My gut feeling prevented me from putting any dollars

Yes, PBI debt is troubling.

Not so much because the d/e ratio is high (3.9). Equity is only $913M
(6/30/02), so it's not the absolute value of that debt that's troubling either.

I just don't like that the debt keeps increasing:

http://quicken.com/investments/seceval/?p=PBI&cmetric=health

I suppose this can be explained positively (somewhat) by the the on-going stock
buybacks and acquisitions.

The most troubling aspect is that PBI has a lease/finance division that leases
big ticket items like planes, trucks, railcars. I can readily imagine a couple
of airlines defaulting on their obligations. So many planes have been taken out
of service already. So it's possible that PBI could be "stuck". Although this
division is supposedly small, when I look at the asset side of the balance
sheet, I see "finance receivables" ($1.8B) and "investment in leveraged assets
($1.4B). I realize there's plenty of postage equipment that's being financed.
But still, if a couple of big jets (assuming these are the kinds of planes
PBI's involved with) get turned back, THAT will hurt PBI. I'm guessing here-- I
don't know how the loans are structured or how the risks might be hedged. (Rail
car leasing business isn't doing well now either. Not sure about truckers, but
CF - 15,000 employees - just went bk)

That $1.4B expression "leveraged assets", just doesn't put me at ease. I'd
really be more comfortable if PBI were not so diversified away from their
primary business, the mail room arena.

Paul,

I have only bought 2 US based stocks during the last year. I bought MRK and
sold covered calls. Also bought some out of the money crash puts and took
profits on them during the July sell off as these covered my loss plus a little
more on the value in the stock as it marched south. MRK has debt, but the debt
is still rated AAA. I was able to do a set up on the stock with the covered
call and dividends of 10% per year which I can live with in this market.

I did buy some SFD as a speculation. I do not like the debt they are carrying.
The reason I bought them is there are a ton of co-ops that are insolvent and
they are picking them up for 10 cents on the dollar. One other stock in the
food business is MWGP - they will have to figure out how to complete with EU
products entering our shores - but there was a blow up at one of their plants
on Friday and this could be an opportunity. The US government is giving
companies in this industry grants for research, marketing, etc. to complete
with the EU dumping and if the US dollar goes where I think it is going - down
- this could be a good investment.

Right now I am watching foreign stocks in the basic materials business. I
bought AAUK and am close to buying a second third position. I am watching
SASOY, IMPAY, and AAPTS for entries. Some other companies I am doing research
on at the moment are: BHP, WMC, RTP and CEO. If we get a sell off in the oil
stocks I will be a buyer. I will not buy unless these stocks are cheap - real
cheap, as I am looking for 1998 price levels for entry points.

assets and generating wealth for the stockholders. I would like to see them
eliminate some of the debt, but every time they turn around a company is in

Sorry, I miss-interpreted your Wal-Mart discussion as it related to SFD.

On the side, I know that Wal-Mart has a history of delaying payments to their
vendors to enhance their cash flow. In other words Wal-Mart uses their vendors
capital to pay for their inventory. It will be interesting to see what kind of
a deal SFD can make with Wal-Mart on this front.

I agree with staying away from other supermarket companies, but I do not think
the Wal-Mart's distribution system is good for perishable food items.
Prepackaged foods should work ok with their system. One thing that is
interesting is the Sam's clubs are not doing all that well but this could be a
Costco competition problem. We have both here and the Costco stores look clean
and the Sam's clubs look dirty. For me buying food in a place that looks dirty

Paul, you got a good price on FLM last week. I have been poring over it this
weekend, and still don't see any serious problems other than a transparent
short attack. They've done an effective job of manipulating the news wires and
scaring less sophisticated or committed investors, but they can't change the
fundamentals. I assume FLM can earn $2.00 this year, and after that, I will
subtract .50 or .60 to account for a possible KM liquidation. So conservatively
I will estimate $2.50 for 2003. If we can get a p/e of 5 to 10 it's a good buy
at less than $6.00. And if KM lives another year the upside is even higher.
Current ratio and other liquidity measures look okay and should improve. The
company's slideshow presentation is informative and is on their website at
www.fleming.com. The conference calls are there, too. Assuming that we know the
value of what we are buying, as the price goes down, the margin of safety goes
up, and this becomes a safer and safer investment. But psychologically, it
doesn't feel that way if you are looking at paper losses.

The idea-writeup is old (5/22/01), but there is an interesting (including some

$300 - $700 million and a debt load of $2.2 billion.

My thoughts on FLM: I have a concentrated portfolio. I have learned the hard
way that this type of debt level can put me in a financially embarrassing
situation. Looking back upon FLM's balance sheet, the company has rarely used
cash to reduce debt but always for expansion. I would need to see a focus (not
words but actions) on paying down debt, insider buying of common stock,
resolution on customer lawsuits, and an increase in ROE.

General Nanotechnology Investment Thesis

"Nanotechnology will replace our entire manufacturing base with a new,
radically more precise, radically less expensive, and radically more flexible
way of making products."

"The anticipated payoff for mastering this technology is beyond any human
accomplishment thus far."

Rarely does a new field of science and technology emerge that is not merely
evolutionary, but promises revolution in many aspects of our lives.
NANOTECNOLOGY is emerging as a new field that has the potential to transform
health care and medicine, biotechnology, manufacturing, energy, and information
processing. The essence of nanotechnology is the creation or utilization of
materials and devices at the level of atoms and molecules and the exploitation
of unique properties and phenomena at the nanoscale level.

Quotes about Nanotechnology:
http://www.zyvex.com/Papers/MNT_paper.html

Nobel Laureate Dr. Richard Smalley, testifying before Congress during a hearing
on nanotechnology on June 22, 1999, said:

"The impact of nanotechnology on health, wealth, and lives of people will be at
least the equivalent of the combined influences of microelectronics, medical
imaging, computer-aided engineering, and man-made polymers developed in this
century."

Dr. Ralph Merkle, then with Xerox PARC, now Principal Fellow at Zyvex, also
testified, stating:

"Nanotechnology will replace our entire manufacturing base with a new,
radically more precise, radically less expensive, and radically more flexible
way of making products."

Dr. Eugene Wong, Assistant Director of the Engineering Directorate at National
Science Foundation, told the committee:

"Recent discoveries at this scale are promising to revolutionize biology,
electronics, materials, and all their applications. We're seeing inventions and
discoveries that were unimaginable only a short time ago."

The Chair of this subcommittee, Congressman Nick Smith (R-Michigan) stated:

"Nanotechnology holds great promise for breakthroughs in health, manufacturing,
agriculture, energy use, and national security." Congressman Smith also noted
that the United States does not dominate nanotechnology, saying: "A significant
amount of research is underway in Europe, and, especially, Japan."

"Mankind is close to having the technology to take the next step to true
molecular nanotechnology; atomically precise manufacturing using arrays of
billions of molecular machines. It is an understatement to say this will
transform the world more than the semiconductor revolution."

President Clinton announced in January his National Nanotechnology Initiative,
including $500 million for nanotechnology research and education in his 2000
fiscal budget.

"Imagine the possibilities: Materials with 10 times the strength of steel and
only a small fraction of the weight, shrinking all the information housed at
the Library of Congress into a device the size of a sugar cube," Clinton said
at the California Institute of Technology when announcing the plan.

SUMMATION:

NANOTECHNOLOGY is the true paradigm that will shift all segments of society and
marks a departure from all historic economic, societal and political
relationships creating tremendous changes across all sectors of life!
Commercial applications are now being rolled out at this moment!

When approaching any area of industry from the nano-particle level, any product
or device generated from the molecular or atomic level sets a brand new
paradigm for that industry. Imagine the tremendous paradigm shift that
nanotechnology is going to cause to ALL industries.

NATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FRIDAY, JANUARY 21, 2000

PRESIDENT CLINTON'S BUDGET MAKES INVESTMENTS IN NATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY
INITIATIVE: LEADING TO THE NEXT INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION January 21, 2000

WHITE HOUSE NEWS March 14, 2000

"A new $495 million National Nanotechnology Initiative. Nanotechnology - the
ability to manipulate individual atoms and molecules - could revolutionize the
21st century in the same way that the transistor and the Internet led to the
Information Age. Increased investments in nanotechnology could lead to
breakthroughs such as molecular computers that can store the contents of the
Library of Congress in a device the size of a sugar cube, and new materials as
strong as steel but ten times lighter. "

"...still don't see any serious problems other than a transparent short attack.
They've done an effective job of manipulating the news wires and scaring less
sophisticated or committed investors, but they can't change the fundamentals."

Have you looked at FLM's cash flows?

Just using the cash flow tab at Yahoo "financials"
http://biz.yahoo.com/fin/l/f/flm_qc.html I calculate cash flow over these four
quarters appears to me to be a minus $136.76 Million (of course I work from the
bottom up on the SCF). Apparently the only positive cash flow they've had is
from borrowing money. If I were to take a position (which I don't have or
intend to have), I would be among the shorts.

Call me a skeptic, but relying on the income statement, or projections from
those numbers, or company slide-shows isn't currently prone to giving me a
reliable basis from which to determine value.

Anyone own/considering F, which we've discussed here at higher prices?
My gut feeling (and that really is all this is), is that there is a substantial
amount of upside in this stock, plus, if the already reduced dividend holds,
you get paid while you wait.
I just think Bill Ford will turn this company around.

I haven't looked very deeply at F for quite a while. If I believed the economy
was at the bottom of a cycle, I think I'd have more urgency perhaps.

I agree that the current management changes appear to have been a positive for
the company. What concerns me is that I have not thought through the notion of
whether it is possible to move future sales into current sales as would be the
case maybe with zero percent financing. If it is possible (and I suspect it is
to some degree), then how would that manifest itself in the future?

FWIW, buying SGP each time it dips below $22 has been a major winner for
me..they have no debt and a decent yield plus the buy out rumors always surface
which gives you a chance to sell for profit.

SGP is selling @ 1998 levels which I know you are interested in.

Allen - No, I don't own any Jollibee. I hadn't followed the stock
before - I recognized the description of Jollibee from a food discussion
elsewhere. I haven't reached a decision on the stock yet.

(I didn't intend my posting as a 'buy' recommendation, but only as

have been clearer about that.)

<<<Anyone own/considering F>>>

After a quick look at the Yahoo profile (not the same thing as DD), my first
impression is with out the dividend, it looks a lot like a pink sheet stock.
Debt to equity at 16 to 1 and losing money by the truck load. Whatever business
decision is associated with floating bonds to pay out $700 million in dividends
doesn't strike me as being very bright. I think at a certain point an investor
has to ask the question, "Would I run a company that way if I were doing it
with my own money?". Somewhere along the line I've become disgusted with the
concept of buying stock in order to support rich life styles for middle aged
party animals, whose business decisions look like they come from the wrong end
of a rolled up $100 bill.

About Wade Cook.

Yes, there's some schadenfreude (joy in somebody else's misfortune) on my part.
Still, I find the article a bit scary too. Here's a guy with methods that
apparently worked (at least for a while); if a person with the talents to
develop those models could not himself or with his staff make changes to adapt
to today's market, then it's hard to see how the average investor can or
should. I'm certainly having a very difficult time currently.

I realize that Mr Cook's got business problems, legal problems, and maybe
employee or personal problems all commingled. Still, from the article, I'm
guessing his use of calls or puts or short-term trading or hedging has not
enabled him to have successful trading years (last year or this year). On
further consideration, I would like to see SOMEBODY, even Wade Cook (alas),
beating this market, even as I would certainly moan and groan and tear out what
little hair I have left if it were Mr. Cook or some other non-investor type who
uses short term trades or options to do it.

jmo,
I'm not a follower of his methods. Apologies if I've made incorrect assumptions
about his techniques or uses thereof.

Wade Cook - I suspect the fortunes of Wade Cook's company and Wade Cook himself
diverge in significant ways. It's likely that the company was yet another way
to mine the suckers and that former cab driver Cook has an ample stash
somewhere known for privacy and an aversion to inquiries from tax authorities
[Unless high living and expensive habits (consider earlier thread comments
about rolled-up bills), have dissipated his gains].

Paul, I have no idea of what Wade Cook's strategy is. However the use of puts
and calls can be a very conservative investment venue. Today I sold amgn
uncovered April 65 calls for 60 cents each. Amgn is more than fairly priced at
42 and with wyeth selling off shares over next several quarters I assess the
probability of amgn rising to 65 by April as being very very slim. If I am
correct the annualized yield on this trade will be about 25%. Selling covered
calls can reduce risk. Selling naked puts can be useful way to acquire stock(If
I decide to take a shot at hrc it will probably be with a sale of a 2.5 put).
So if you use puts and calls from a conservative value investor oriented
viewpoint the overall results can be better than buy and hold. Just my two
bits.

It's pride/shame scale has got to have moved way over to total shame. Difficult
for anyone to admit they own it or are buying it, I'd say.

Still, for anybody with a 2-3 year outlook, a buy here might work out. Assuming

somewhat.

Off topic Iraq.

Once upon a time there was a little country named Kuwait. The folks in Kuwait
had lots of oil, but decided they could have even more by drilling diagonal
wells to tap into Iraqi reserves. Back in those days Iraq was sort of friends
with the US (as much as the US is friends with anyone in the Middle East).
Saddam Hussein met with folks in Washington to find out if the US would
interfere if Iraq were to use force against Kuwait to eliminate the theft of
Iraqi oil. Iraq was told the US would leave them alone to deal with the problem
in their own way. The rest is history.

You see, Iraq has this totally unacceptable attitude that the oil under the
surface of Iraq belongs to Iraq, and if anyone is going to turn a profit on
exploiting the resource, it's going to be Iraq. Not exactly the kind of
attitude likely to endear one to Texas oil men.

When I was a kid in school, I was taught America was the land of the free and
the home of the brave. America was a country steeped in justice and the
champion of free people everywhere. When the cause was to be left alone in
peace, America was like everyone's big brother.

Somehow, the current situation doesn't have that kind of flavor. The US has
been invading Iraqi air space for months and bombing hell out of it. The so
called "no fly zone" was never sanctioned by the UN and I'm fairly certain most
folks would shoot back at anyone flying bombing missions over their land. I
don't know if Iraq has weapons of mass destruction or not, but I do know I
haven't seen a signal fact in the news to support the accusation. Iraq offered
to allow the US to inspect for weapons of mass destruction, but for some reason
the US wasn't interested in the offer. Iraq has offered to allow UN inspectors
back into the country and for some reason that seems to have Bush madder than
ever.

I suppose in a round about way Bush should be admired for his absolute loyalty
to the Texas oil money which put him in office, and his willingness to see as
many people die as it takes to open Iraq to Texas oil interests. Personally, I
can't think of anything more alarming than having a crazy person in charge of
the country with the largest arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in the
world. If George wants to kill Saddam, give the wacko a Saturday night special
and drop him in the no fly zone, but don't sign America's name to his private
war.

Thanks, Timba, I thought FLM's cash flow was sufficient to pay off 100M of debt
ny the end of the year, but only because management and Value Line seemed to be
saying that. The cash flow statement is a little complex for me. Since we're at
$4.50 now and dropping .50 a day, I guess Fleming will trade at zero in 10
days. There does not seem to be any news out that would justify that, everyone
just seems to want to sell. Maybe I'm not as informed as I thought, or there is
insider knowledge circulating that I don't have access to. If they sell or
close most of their retail stores (announcement due end of Sept.), would that
not generate some cash to pay down debt? Or would charges for closing stores
mean negative cash flow? Mr. Hansen said that store disposition would be
"earnings neutral". Anyone care to interpret that?

Out of ALL and moving funds to MBI. Seems like many on SI have been shorting
MBI and others. Many insurers are being targeted because of perceived (maybe
actual?) problems with macro economic issues and company specific issues
related to easy credit, over lending, possible or probable defaults, recession,
debt bubble.

Short term I'd say the shorts will control the stock. I intend to buy more MBI
if/as stock drops. Baring some severe shock to the financial system or some
very bad news specific to MBI (perhaps with one of their ancillary businesses
or overseas operations), the company should rebound from current wave of
pessimism, as they have in past.

I'll look again at adding to RDN too. Same sort of issues.

Timba agree with your fundamental analysis of jpm but not your strategy. Unless
you expect a complete collapse the trade is likely to be a loss. Some time ago
I wrote a 27.5/22.5 December put spread at cost of 2.4. Do you expect the huge
30 trillion of notional derivative exposure to blow up in their face? In the
next 8 weeks??

I am extremely nervous about what might occur in the market between now and the
end of October. Given that nervousness, if I were going to buy a put, I figure
that I might as well do it now. My total dollar exposure is minimal (<$500).

Do I expect their huge derivative exposure to blow up in their face? Perhaps
not all of it. But I've read some (unverified) reports that some of covenants
used to back that exposure were dependent, in part, on JPM price not going
below 20. I have also read that JPM has a large exposure to gold, and if the
metal has any sudden increase they could suffer major problems. Given the watch
level increase that has been put on by one of the credit rating agencies
(Fitch?), and given my own analysis of their cash flow and having these other
tidbits of potential floating around out there, I can see the potential for
much more downside to their stock price.

How long did it take Enron's price to go down the tubes once the credit started
getting downgraded?

I'm not betting on JPM to go to zero by Nov. expiration, just betting that I
can get out of the position by the end of October with a nice profit.
