Thanks for looking at it. I see the company more as a global diversified
financial service company with a strong emphasis in Europe, more like a
Citibank or global Travelers, with a significant asset in the money management
field. I am giving the company an addiitonal markup of 5% of their money
management business, but this could be too high. My concern is more with a
possible exposure to emerging market debt. There is an interesting FOrbes
article from a year ago that you can access on the ING thread. WIth the
contemplated acquisition of the third largest Belgian Bank they also gain a
presence in Africa

I don't see any value in LUKN - although I suppose that everything has value at
some price.

LUKN appears to be a tiny player in a commodity market (sutures and sharps).
The company isn't growing, and offers little more than cheaper prices.

I don't know what the market is for people who ask that their heart valves be
sewn with cheap thread. It's comforting that one of the three directors on the
BOD is a founder of ValuJet. (And I haven't even gotten to the fact that a
recent S-3 offering included sales by someone I consider to be a corporate
earwig.)

Michael,

Let me list my four concerns about QNTM/DD makers:

1. In my opinion, the margins on the DLT drives could eventually be under
pressure. Here is some pricing information on Seagate's AIT tape drive (a Sony
design):

http://www.uvision.com/prdct/983/361.html

And here's the price of a comparable DLT tape drive from Quantum:

http://www.uvision.com/prdct/628/751.html

As I said before, there are good/bad points for each type of drive, but the
Quantum is priced considerably higher, and after some research, I believe the
AIT drive to be technically a better choice for most enterprises. I will take
back what I said previously about the DLT drives perhaps not being able to grow
to higher capacities. I learned that this is not true.

That said, organizations already using DLT will not simply abandon the
technology (for backward-compatability reasons). And it will also take some
time before vendors to make tape libraries incorporating AIT drives and for AIT
to become popular. But, I still have to question the ability to sustain the
high margins on DLT.

2. I see the possiblity that the drive makers have been doing some channel
stuffing. Perhaps not Quantum or Seagate, but I am almost certain that WDC has
done it (admittedly a rough estimate: 25% year-over-year revenue growth in
recent quarter, and an empirically-derived 20% drop in entry-level drive prices
would suggest over 50% unit growth - which seems high). My question is, do any
of these companies have policies about inventory levels, etc.? Or do any of
them reveal information about unit sales? Or can you tell this information from
their reports?

If this was so, it would almost certainly have a short-term (6 month). But it
could also have a medium-term (6 month - 2 year) effect. For example, consumers
would probably no longer willing to pay higher prices for drives.

3. What I feel is a poor longer term (e.g. 2-5 year) outlook, which we have
discussed previously.

4. Finally, I don't see the disk drive makers trading at an exceptionally low
valuations relative to historical numbers. Compared to their 1994 lows, SEG and
QNTM are arguably about 1 1/2 times as expensive (in terms of P/B, P/S) and WDC
is about 1 1/4 times. Certainly, they are well off this year's highs, but the
businesses are not exceptionally cheap.

All in all, I don't question that there is potential for appreciation, but I
question the short- and long-term downside.

Paul, why are you buying WDC and not Quantum and Seagate? I'd like to invest in
WDC but I can't come up with a basis for doing so ... the forward and trailing
PE's are worthless; the PSR has a ways to go before it reaches Quantum's of 18
months ago (.25); it seems to be behind on technology (i.e., the MR transition)
and product positioning (too low GB); it has no technological
partnerships/backers that I'm aware of; it seems more vulnerable to Asian
competition, it has no other business units to fill the profit gap (e.g.,
software, DLT).

I have been buying metals companies ... ANGLY, PD, RTP, VAALY, MSB, ... but
what qualities are you looking for? I'm interest in modest PEs, supporting
dividend yields, modest debt, competitive advantage, large low-cost ore bodies,
liquidity, large scale, etc.

For the benefit of those on the thread that appreciate your posts... would you

I guess "Oxford is really not different" (my post #2690). After the latest
charge, retained earnings are approaching zero. This means that
in their core market they have, in effect, not made money. In fact, losses have
been characteristic of the difficult NY/NJ HMO market for years.

Note also what I have posted over on the Oxford thread regarding their growth
prospects.

I have seen time and time again in the group health business companies who
charged too low rates and set up too little reserves. They are able to grow the
business to quite remarkable sizes with good (phony) financial results before
the music stops. At this point, because of the comment in the first paragraph
above, I would not consider OXHP
(after tomorrow's drop) a value stock. I still recommend avoiding it, except
possibly for a trading rally - if it has a large short position and drops a lot
tomorrow.

I will address your question as best as I can.

There is a long history in the Multiple Employer Trust (MET) market
of very loose affinity groups being set up by shady characters who charge too
low rates and set up too low reserves. Huge volumes of business get written
before they get caught. These kinds of outfits
usually go out of business, only to appear under some other name somewhere
else.

I believe that OXHP is a real company that (based only on reading the thread)
has doctor/supplier networks that patients like. They have an advantage of size
that their competitors do not. Assuming that they
do not pay their networks much different amounts than their peers,
they should be able, with competent mgmt and actuarial staff, to develop a
pricing structure that is higher than they now charge but still less than their
peers. They need to also do some intelligent damage control to help retain
existing customers and do the best they can with new ones (as I noted on OXHP
thread).

If the premises in the preceeding paragraph are correct, which they may not be,
and if mgmt executes well (a tough assumption to make
under the circumstances), and was just stupid (not crooked), I would expect the
company to survive. It might well be a smaller company, depending on how many
customers are moved by brokers/consultants and how much new business falls off.
I doubt that OXHP would make over $1 per share any time soon (unless they
overstated the reserve increase and feed back the eventual excess into
earnings) or carry a rich P/E. I also am skeptical that anyone would be
interested in buying the business at this time, when I would consider it to be
unstable.

When I threw out an expected $200M hit yesterday

This puts the company on shaky ground financially
with respect to its balance sheet. IMO, it has about
another $200M to give before it starts getting in trouble
in the bankruptcy sense.

Chapter 11 for Oxford? Let me go out on a limb and just speculate that the
company, however unpopular, is not going to go bankrupt SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY DEBT.

Another reality check. You don't scare a value investor off by pointing out
that a stock that has fallen from 80 and change to 20 in two months has some
serious flaws. I don't want to ruin the family tone of this site, but my verbal
response would be "No s__t" (sorry Mike) Reading between the lines of the Wall
Street Journal article the other day, I saw that they are still retaining
customers. Thats what matters to me. I'm not betting that earnings are going to
meet the old Wall Street estimates. I'm just betting that the franchise is
still somewhat intact.

I'm not going to promise anything or mortgage the house to buy more of Oxford,
but this has every characteristic of a winning value investment. If they can't
capitalize on their East Coast franchise because they can't work a computer,
Pacificare or Aetna will be happy to do it for them.

OK, I'm testy. I lost money today...

Brendan Watt: Ah,um..I have no good reason for buying WDC at this point over
SEG or Quantum. I originally chose WDC because they are more a pure play than
Quantum and they outsource more than SEG (which is more vertically integrated).
I also like WDC because they've done some very good work in the past few years
to increase manufacturing throughput (implemented cycle time reduction). I felt
that this would be a competitive strengh for WDC (assuming competitors did not
also revamp their processes--probably not a good assumption). My intent was to
lag into a very small position. So I've been averaging down a little. (Still,
even with a very small entry amount @ about $24... it hurts.) Someone
committing funds (and their sanity -g-)to the DD sector has about 2 reasonable
options in dealing with these 3 main players: 1)pick the best and invest in
that one only, 2)select them all - they may all be presumed to be undervalued.
And I guess I came up with a third choice-pick one as a surrogate - they're all
tarred with the same brush. My $ position is small & I'm averaging down. I also
own APM a supplier to WDC- and here my position is larger and I am also
averaging down.
As these stocks continue to drop, it may well be beneficial to take the time to
determine which is the best investment. Time and falling prices would be on the
side of the patient researcher. Right now the outlook does not look very good
at all. Very scary for DD bus. Seems like there are better opportunities
elsewhere - maybe where vision is much clearer. Paul Senior

Not having debt does not prevent OXHP from going bankrupt. Increasing

Oxford - I was on the road today, so I hadn't read the latest news when I
posted my thoughts on Oxford ten minutes ago. I'll stand by most of it, but I
deserve what I get for posting a "holier than thou" post without being up to
date. Mea culpa. Thanks Mike for notifying me of the new developments - I
didn't want to sleep tonight!

My read of it is that there is a lot of new information. I don't worry about
non cash charges unless they tell me something about future cash flows. The
admission that government payments for Medicare don't cover costs was
astounding to me. You've got to be an idiot to lose money in that market.
Congress has given the HMOs a virtual licence to steal.

But the last paragraph of the news release was very positive. One of the big
concerns is that Oxford would have to restate past earnings. KPMG's blessing of
their past financials is a dodged bullet. That's value investing. A company
tells you that the past financials were correct and you consider that a
positive.

James, Re: OXHP

I've been posting the positives over on the OXHP thread the last
few days. I agree that the WSJ article wasn't that bad - the
last half of the article was very positive (doctors not fleeing,
patients not fleeing, adding 400,000 net next year). And the
NY Times article this morning was interesting but not entirely
accurate.

This was a huge hit though the 164M. I think that the price
reflects that, but a losing stock in December will see a hit
on news like that. And add in $28M for non-NY subsidiaries. The
loss of 120M means that operations are still profitable.
Right, but... Wiggins even now is trying to play the analysts.
He admitted only on further questioning that he was including
an $18M one-time gain on the sale of a subsidiary in that
loss. My biggest worry is management integrity.

They had 1.006 billion in premiums receivable and cash (ok'd
by KPMG). They had about 565M in claims payable. That gives
them say $450M in play. Then you take back $192M in 4th Q
charges. So now they have like $200-250M in liquidity on
their balance sheet. Not bad for a 1.6B company. But they
still have fines, lawsuits above their insurance cap,
and the "restructuring charges" that will inevitably come
down the pipe as they shut down and restructure various Medicare
operations.

Now, the patients still like them. The patients chose them
Number 1 in NJ just in September. And the patients chose them
among the top two in NY in May. And the providers aren't fleeing
(yet, at least). As a physician, I can't express how impressed
I am with that.

But now their financial stability is threatened, and the big
boys in NY (WSJ, NYT) are
reporting it. Can they keep their franchise in customer
satisfaction in New York? This is an open question. Like you say,
value investors should not be surprised that there is bad
news behind a 70 point fall from 90.

I feel duped by the company, but now the trick is to keep a level
head and figure out what I'm going to do tomorrow.

Currently I am looking to buy: UHAL (avging down), ION (adding to a new

I've also been averaging down on KMET (but losing my confidence for it as it
drops faster and further than I expected). These stocks are not necessarily

PD gets analyzed by Peter Lynch in Beating the Street.

I have a friend who works there and was trying to get
me to buy it up near 80. Evidently he's new and didn't
understand cyclicals.I've continued to track it, but
I'm not sure I do either.

It produces 1.5 billion pounds of copper, so every 1
cent change in price/lb transmits 15 million in net
profit/loss right to the bottom line - not insignificant
with a market cap less than 4 billion. It has a plan to sell
off non-core operations, and has already started
doing so, but copper is the tail that wags this dog.

I don't know quite when to jump in. Going by Lynch's
methods, the Equity - Debts of 1.8 billion should
make us feel safe that they can survive the next
downturn. I think that's a given. But when to pull
the trigger. Down again today. Any opinion here

Current market strategy.
Recently, my theme has mostly been to buy low and not worry about the market
too much. Sounds simple, but it can be hard to remember amidst today's
volatility. Many small-cap stocks are down a lot, despite the S&P 500 being
near record highs.
------

My largest weighting (20-25%) is in utilities that have strong cash flow and
4-8% dividend yields. Although they've been strong recently, a lot of utilities
havne't done much over the last 5-10 years. My utility portfolio is
geographically diversified, with market caps ranging from $3-17 billion.

According to PG&E's CEO, a new wave of deregulation is coming which will
"ultimately overshadow previous deregulation of the telecommunications,
airline, rail and trucking industries." "To put the coming change in proper
perspective, consider that the natural gas and electricity market is roughly
the same size as the nation's long-distance telephone market PLUS the domestic
airline market PLUS the computer software market!"
http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/971209/pg_e_1.html

In the future, utilties companies could well become enterprise-wide service
providers, perhaps much like today's telecom giants. For instance, instead of
being locked into the California market, PG&E is now providing nationwide
energy solutions to Neiman-Marcus. In another package deal, it's doing the same
for 800+ McDonald's restaurants in California. Perhaps it could be all
restaurants nationwide in the future; the reason for a trend towards larger
contracts is that huge bulk purchases reduce unit costs. Nationwide or
region-wide economies of scale and scope will be crucial competitive factors;
as a result, M&A activity should be brisk, increasing the valuations of many
companies.
-------

Internet companies comprise about a 10% weighting, since I see Internet growth
continuing. 1997 Internet online ad revenue will reach $1 billion this year,
triple 1996's numbers. http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,17011,00.html A lot of
my Interet stocks comprise the top-trafficked sites. For the top 25 sites in
November, see http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/971208/relevant_knowledge_1.html

When bandwidth finally reaches critical mass, Internet search engine companies
could become the broadcasters of tomorrow to more affluent, highly specified
target audiences.
------

I've also started positions in Southeast Asian stocks and closed-end funds,
some of which are down 75% from their peaks. I have a 5% weighting in some of
the larger, more blue-chip Year2000 service providers, and may expand this
somewhat. Presently have a 5% weighting in depressed disk drive leaders, and
2-3% weighting in the lowest cash-cost gold producers.
-------

For core long-term holdings I have a good-sized percentage in very large
blue-chips, including financials, drugs, telecom equipment, consumer
electronics, and semiconductor leaders with excellent R&D departments.

happy investing,
Philip

thing is that when I started writing professionally, I
maintained talking to the company in any but face-to-face
situations colored my analysis of the numbers, so I didn't do it. But
this is journalism, not buy-side analysis - it's my job to get
quotes from the company and the analysts. And guess what, it colored
my analysis. When you have Creative's head Tech engineer
telling you how "incredible" the products are, it's hard say
wait, how about these inventories...

Down the slippery slope of cynicism. It's one
thing when you read about others getting lied to, but
when they mislead you to your own face...
I think I might add the "Lie" factor to any further analysis
I do - the more analysts in bed with management, the greater
the likelihood of funny business in the financial statements. GNT's

Look at MVSI and MVSIW. The stock and warrant are starting a rebound from the
lows following a warrant call stock drop.
The warrant call is over on Dec 15 and some warrant holders don't have the
necesary
$4 to exercise, which has driven down the stock with the help of mm's and
shorts.
The warrant can increase faster, but I wouldn't buy it without thinking I may
have to
exercise it if things go bad.
However, I believe the stock will be back to old highs around $8 or $9 this
year and
maybe $12 to 15 in the first Q.
No change in great fundamentals - growing 350%.
Go and surf the wave to the top.

All IMHO! Do your own research and buy!

More on OXHP

I'm reposting this from the OXHP thread for comments here
by people that may see an error in my accounting.

The way I see it (and remember my worry is a
short-term liquidity criis, so I'm not looking
at things like plant and LT assets - if it
gets to the point that they are selling property
and equipment to pay off people, the battle is
lost anyway - bankruptcy would be preferable):

568M reserves as of 3Q end
+ 164M NY reserves
+36M NJ and CT reserves
= 768M in reserves expected at 4Q
+ 97M trade accounts payable
= 865M due in less than 6 mos

On the asset side,
659M cash and shrt term investments
354M premiums receivable (certified by KPMG)
= 1013M

So there is 148M in ST liq before charges for Medicare
restructuring/closing operations, lawsuit costs, fines
by regulators/NY Attorney General. If they are profitable,
and IF these additional charges are less than $148M or
so that is a good thing.

But are they profitable?

Est -120M loss (including one time gain of $18M)
+ 164M + 38M
gives 62 M in operating profits. But it is not clear
whether that extra 38M is included in the 120M loss
projection. In fact, when pressed in the conference,
Wiggins said he didn't know, but that the press release
says 120M so "Let's just go with that." Sheesh.

If that 38M is not included, we're looking at another
disappointment and an operating profit of only 18M (and
a total loss of $158M).
This is only half of last 4Q operating profit.
And they will be raising rates, closing certain operations,
and probably cutting back on expansion plans, so further
profit expansion is really up in the air.

So where is Wiggins getting 500M in equity (and
you can be sure he's rounding up)?
Well, plant and equipment is included there. That
is 145M less than equity at the end of 3Q.
So he really is looking at a loss of about $145M or more
all told (greater than the 120 in the press release -
again, sheesh). This is in line with the discussion
in the paragraph above that adds the 38M to the
already announced loss of 120M.

The net of it is management wasn't even realy honest
in its press release - it was more candid with the
analysts in the conference, but only on much prodding.
I'll admit it - I feel burned. Other views more
than welcome.

Mike,

Your comments about talking with the company is a major concern. One does
research on a stock and the numbers look good so you go into the call wanting
to hear good things. When the company person gives the good info, it's what you
are wanting to hear. They have a vested interest in making you believe things
are good and you have an inclination to believe it.

However, if you don't make the call, you are missing an important part of the
analysis. Finding that the company has made an unreported expansion in the
current quarter or that they are running at full capacity can often be a good
indicators. It often isn't the overall comments made that become important, but
the little things that are a part of the conversation.

I believe you should make the calls, but remember the 'lie factor'. If you
don't, you end up with conclusions based on the same information available to
everyone.

For what it's worth,
Ron

Paul,

I haven't taken the time to look at GNT's footnotes but suspect what you may be
missing is some very agressive accounting techniques. This is second hand, so
do your own investigation. As I understand it, when they originate and then
later securitize a mortgage GNT takes a very agressive stance in their
treatment of the spread between the underlying mortgage and the securitized
instrument. This essentially amounts to accelerating future revenues to the
present accounting period. Of course, when those mortgages get paid back sooner
than expected the chickens come home to roost and the previously accelerated
revenues must be reversed. Hope this adds something. -JLF

Dow Jones Newswires -- December 10, 1997

Finance Cos. Fall On Concerns Over Accounting Technique

By Gaston F. Ceron

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Shares of specialty finance companies fell Wednesday, and
an analyst attributed the drop to concerns over the use of an accounting
technique that some charge inflates earnings projections.

Among finance houses, Green Tree Financial Corp. (GNT) closed down 2 1/8, or
7.3%, to 27. IMC Mortgage Co. (IMCC) fell 1 1/4, or 8.8%, to 13. Delta
Financial Corp. (DFC) ended down 3/4, or 4.6%, to 15 9/16. First Alliance Corp.
(FACO) dropped 7/8, or 4.3%, to finish at 19 1/2.

Robert Napoli, an analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp., said the stocks retreated
due to investors questioning the use of gain-on-sale accounting, a method that
allows lenders to immediately record expected future profit from loans they
sell. He said Green Tree, IMC Mortgage, Delta Financial and First Alliance all
use gain-on-sale.

As reported, critics have said the technique gives management too much leeway
when making assumptions about future interest rates, prepayments and defaults.
Gain-on-sale accounting is said to artificially inflate a company's earnings
prospects.

Worries have mounted since Firstplus Financial Group Inc. (FPFG) said it may
eliminate its use of gain-on-sale, casting doubt on the companies that continue
to utilize it.

Napoli said many lenders may stop using gain-on-sale, or at least use it with
assumptions that are conservative enough to appease Wall Street.

Green Tree, IMC Mortgage and Delta Financial officials did not immediately
return phone calls seeking comment.

Mark Mason, First Alliance's chief financial officer, said he feels comfortable
with the assumptions his company makes when using gain-on-sale. First Alliance
has been conservative when making its assumptions and has good cushion against
performance not being what the company expected, he said.

BHPanalysts see no Christmas joy in profit

Reuters Story - December 10, 1997 19:27
%AU %JP %US %GB %MET %STL %ENR %RESF %CL %PG %FCAST BHPX FBGX V%REUTER P%RTR

By Mark Bendeich
MELBOURNE, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Australian steel, mining and
oil giant The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP) faces a bleak
Christmas with investors expecting it to announce another steep
fall in half-year profit next week.
BHP, which could once be counted upon to fill investors
Christmas stockings with strong earnings and a growing share
price, is tipped to report net profit before abnormals of around
A$600 million for the half-year ended November 30.
The expected result compares with A$683 million a year ago
and could include a second-quarter loss for the group's troubled
copper division, the world's second-biggest copper producer.
"The macro environment is going against them at the moment
with the Asian slowdown and the copper price heading south and
domestic demand still pretty flat," a fund manager said.
"I can't see much joy anywhere."
Apart from copper, BHP's divisions should actually report a
stronger second quarter, with a weaker Australian dollar coming
to their aid, BHP analysts told Reuters on Wednesday.
Analysts' half-year forecasts range from A$580 million to
A$620 million, the fund manager said. A result of A$600 million
would be 12 percent down on a year ago, but imply that, overall,
second-quarter earnings were ahead of the first quarter.
BHP reported first-quarter earnings of A$284 million before
an abnormal gain of A$73 million from the sale of shares it held
in Foster's Brewing Group .
The group will book as an abnormal gain another A$25 million
in the second quarter from the sale of its remaining Foster's
stake, said Merrill Lynch analyst Elaine Prior.
Prior forecast BHP to report half-year earnings of A$581
million before the abnormal gains. She sees the copper division
breaking even in the second quarter.
"It could make a loss. It's a struggle," Prior said. She
declined to give forecasts for each of the BHP divisions.
BHP's copper business includes 57.5 percent of the low-cost
Escondida mine in Chile, but is struggling with high operating
costs at its North American operations.
Its Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea has been crippled by
drought since August 11, and three-month copper fell to 85 U.S.
cents per pound from almost US$1 over BHP's half-year.
A Sydney-based analyst said he expected copper division's
half-year earnings to collapse to A$58 million, including a A$4
million second-quarter loss. Ok Tedi alone lost the division
about A$50 million in earnings in the second quarter.
The best performer in the second quarter was the petroleum
division, he said, forecasting a 31 percent profit surge in the
final three months to reach a half-year total of A$358 million.
"There will be improvements (in second-quarter earnings) in
all of the divisions apart from copper at the end of the day,"
the analyst said.
The average of analysts' full-year forecasts for BHP
suggests a flat result of about A$1.3 billion in 1997/98, rising
to A$1.64 billion in 1998/99, the fund manager said.
BHP's bottom-line profit and share price have mainly fallen
for the past 18 months, raising serious doubts among investors
about the ability of management to turn its performance around.
BHP's share price has suffered more than most in the recent
sell-off of resources stocks in the Australian market.
It came under attack again on Wednesday, closing 37 cents
lower at A$13.95.
"Unless you see some more convincing numbers and that
returns are lifting across the board, the market is still going
to be sceptical," the fund manager said.
"For the first time there's recognisable value there (in the
share price) but no-one's prepared to step up to the plate yet."

Mike, re GNT's accounting. I'm not sure if this accounting is standard
throughout the securitized lending business. However, based on the info in the
WSJ article referred to by another poster, that looks to be the case. My
info/understanding of the technique arose when researching the manufactured
housing companies, some of whom also originate and securitize mortgages. In
that group Oakwood Homes (OH) used the most conservative accounting at the time
of my review. Others were quite agressive. It is an important distinction when
comparing these companies since the more conservative treatment has either
understated their earnings or created an asset (an annuity- like stream of
future earnings) that is unrecorded. To the degree this is misunderstood or
underappreciated by the street there is a good chance for mispricing the
stocks.

Disclosure-- I hold a sizeable position in Oakwood Homes. -JLF

one that has a low barrier to entry. They have operations in

pressures might not be so bad? They recently announced about
a 5% share buyback. They are currently not profitable, but
if you believe in the growth of the semiconductor industry, they
should become profitable soon, particularly with their aggressive

Re: ZLG

Here are my opinions...

As far as financials, Texas Pacific Group, the acquirers, specialize in
turnarounds, out-of-favour industries, etc. They've bought a couple tech.
companies previously (Paradyne from AT&T ($175mm) and Globespan Technologies
from Lucent). They have made numerous other acquisition and investments in
other industries (the lead of the group was involved in the re-financing of
Continental airlines after bankrupcy). They manage over $3 billion in capital.
ZLG is a profitable company with over $4 in cash on their balance sheet. They
shouldn't have any problems with financing.

As far as judging whether their "heart" is still in the deal (e.g. whether they
would just outright cancel), their track record on completion of deals is quite
good (I haven't been able to find any that fell through). That's about all that
I can evaluate.

As far as lowering price below say my $17 1/2 price... given a book value just
below $17, it would be a little insulting, but, I'd take the loss. Also, there
were better terms regarding ZLG performance in the amended deal.

Here's the last week's worth of activity:

Bought 9% more UWW @ $15
Bought 21% more VLSI @ $20
Sold 5% of ASND @ $32
Sold 8% of SDS @ $27-7/8

Bought 5% more GENE @ $7-1/8
Bought 10% more VLSI @ $19-5/16
Bought 10% more SFR @ $10-1/2

As you can see, the buying has heavily outweighed the selling recently. The
stocks that I'm buying have improved in fundamental value relative to their
price/share in this most recent market bashing. All but ASND I have owned for
many years and make small adjustments to my holdings to limit risk. ASND I
first bought at $32+ after its collapse from $80. I was a bit too early. I then
continued to average down to the $23+ range. With the speculative pop that we

Hi Paul, Once you get buying in AIM, the buys start comming faster and faster.
AIM acts like a proportional controller - like cruise control, for instance.
Little hills, no need for any adjustments; Big Hills, Big Adjustments!

For me, AIM has returned to me the time for good fundamental analysis. I had a
pretty serious Ticker Addiction before I started AIM 10 years ago. It turned
out to be much more flexible than Mr. L's book made it sound. Some of that
flexibility is probably what he'd call cheating, but I've always been fond of
breaking rules!

VLSI has been in my portfolio since 1990. My initial position was 1/2 in the
common stock and 1/2 in their conv. bond. A few years ago the darned bond got
so valuable that I finally sold them at about $1.20 on the dollar. Since then
it's all been in the common. I haven't checked Value Line to see what VLSI's
present Book Value is, but I believe it's around $12 a share or so.

If you would like to see how AIM's been treating me with VLSI, it's my feature
stock right now. Take a look at

To anyone who views Matria Healthcare (MATR) as a value play, IMO it just

Zilog pre-announced a substantial earnings/revenue shortfall on Sept. 28. Zilog
stated in the original merger agreement that they expected Q3 to be
substantially the same as Q2. However, revenues fell from over $70mm to approx
$60mm. The pre-announcement resulted in the fall (and subsequent change in the
merger agreement).

Mike - any opinion on WHX's hostile bid on Handy & Harmon? I'm lost. Even at a
35% premium it only represents 13x earnings. But I think of the alternative of
dividending $10 of cash to shareholders... LaBow owns a lot of stock, so I
can't imagine he's just being reckless, but this is not what I expected to be
seeing. I sure wish I had 20% of my portfolio in HNH today rather than in WHX.

Let's look at HNH

It's in the same type of biz as DYA was. DYA was around 30
when it was brought up here on this thread. Moved to 45 with
WHX's original bid, and eventually hit 90. That accounts
for HNH's premium to the bid.

HNH provides diversification, is cyclical but
has solid earnings of about $2 share pretty consistently with good
ROE. To the 360M price you have to add the 120M in LT debt net of
cash. Is it a good deal for WHX? The CEO seems to be pursuing
some sort of acquisition strategy - he didn't get Teledyne
or DYA and turns to others in the general industry and
sees HNH. Looks good, so let's float some debt and buy
this sucker. That explains the senior notes (I couldn't
figure out why they were taking on more debt with their
liquidity - in retrospect we should've been looking ourselves
for the next likely acquisition - <g>).

How about WHX shareholders? Well, obviously the CEO knows
value when he sees it, buying back a bunch of WHX at less
than $10, and we know Teledyne and DYA ultimately were
worth much more than they were when WHX first showed interest.
Is HNH another example of value revealed to the world?
The market thinks so, with shares over $2 over the offer.
Will WHX get its prize finally? We'll see, but it appears
that the market has said, "We want a better price."

Is this deal accretive? It's financing the $480M
price at 9%, which is 43 million in interest per year.
1996 EBIT is 68M. So am I correct in saying it's mildly
accretive? And if the price goes up to say $40 share,
are we breaking the threshold? Where oh where has
my margin of safety gone?

Them's my thoughts.

James,

What an individual decision for a value investor!
My goal is to own a little DD (Quantum), a little
semi (Intel, Speedfam at the right price), a little
software (?). That way I won't miss it when tech runs and
I won't be hurt too much when it stumbles. I won't resist the urge
to invest in them if only because my hometown is Silly
Valley and they are so easy to investigate there (plus
my high school buddies,inlaws and my brother are always feeding me
ideas). Dataquest is like two blocks from my house. It ain't Nebraska
and I ain't Warren Buffett, so there'll always be tech in my
portfolio. But having dealt with some of them on the inside
as a contractor and an IBM employee, it's easy to see that
many of them are rotten and you can't glean it from the balance
sheet.

"Buns of Steel": re IAD. That's maybe what it takes to sit with stocks in this
industry. I still like LTV. Rather than average down at today's low, I've
bought Inland (also at a low). Inland holds some interest for me: They've got
an apparently very good distribution business; there's an investment firm
that's active and wants to see IAD restructure to free up that value; the value
ratios look relatively (to past years)good; the business is receiving some
airplay - Lukins buyout by BS (that's Bethlehem Steel -g-)and there's that WHX
purchase. So maybe a little consolidation. On the other hand....
Lots of bad stuff too. It's steel, it's cyclical, every S.East Asian steel co.
will be REALLY exporting now -- probably there's more ugly that I don't know
about. But I bet I will see this stock up 50% from where it is now within a
couple of years - if I can hold on (and if I am right --which I've not been so
far with the past 8 consecutive stocks I've bought). Paul Senior

Paul,

You may have touched on the biggest problem facing US steel companies -SE Asia
competition. Most of my research lately has been in the region. China companies
are ramping up production with strong backing from the PRC, other countries
have sharply devalued currencies. This could depress steel prices over the next
few years and make it difficult for the unionized US companies that are trying
to comply with stricter government regulations.

Just my 2 cents,
Ron

How does the small investor analyse the consumer finance sector? SEC filings
certainly do not provide sufficient detail on loan quality. Looking at yahoo
business summary I immediately want to know how GNT can make 318 million on 937
million in revenues? Is there really a tooth fairy? I recently initiated a
small position of AAC with a stock purchase and ratio write of out of the money
calls only because the stock seemed undervalued relative to past performance
and so called book value. But I am certain that such parameters are not
sufficient to classify a stock as a value play. The entire sector seems
relatively inexpensive based on these parameters but such thinking is contrary
to the value investors rule of truly understanding the business of the
purchase.

Re: loan quality, you can look up ratings on the securitized

Allen Furlan: re: GNT and loans: For me, it is not possible to analyze the
quality of the loans. And it seems the loans are always being downgraded after
the stock declines or upgraded after the stocks hit new highs -g-. My
assumption is this: it is not possible nor necessary for value investors to
"truly understand the business" before investing in a particular company. One
tries of course, but key variables like management, new situations (like WHX
purchase of H&H), always seem to be constraints or boundary issues. Therefore,
to overcome this: 1) One looks for a margin of safety. With GNT you have a
strong niche business employing more than 3000 people, whose special expertise
is the growing mobile home market; 2) One buys a package of these finance
companies (maybe) and is well diversified (certainly) in holding stocks in
other industries; 3) One allows the time for the current situation to resolve
itself. They might earn 200M this year or maybe 300M in the next couple- even
if they switched to more conservative accounting practices. This will provide a
very good relative pe IMO.
We shall have to wait and see. Today, I've added to my position in GNT. Paul

Very helpful comments on consumer finance. Helps explain gnt large profit for
revenue stream. Comapnies which rely on securitizations, which deal in sub
prime markets, and which may use dubious accounting practices are high risk
IMO. I will take my loss on ctys this month, sold 5 puts at 3 and will buy back
at 4 1/4 or more. S&P rated their debt as B with negative implications 2 months
ago, but the company is in much more dire straights. Also will probably own aac
at 5 1/4 when my calls expire. Bottom line is that typical criteria such as
book value and revenue growth are very deceptive for this sector. The S&P
negative implications rating for gnt will keep me out of this one.
P.S Good web site. Per write up on REITs an interesting play in this sector are
company bonds backed by hard assets. I recently bought ACH January 2001 7%
convertibles at par. Low risk with a possible conversion kicker.

I'm looking at a telecom infrastructure stock called
Spectrian (SPCT). I have a limit order at 20 tomorrow.
The stock is at 19 1/2, has 9 in cash, basically no debt,
has been killed down from above 60 but still should
make 2/share this coming year and the year after. Solid
ROE and a margin of safety in all that cash. Wish I had
seen it earlier, since it is up 2 today alone. Looks
like it got hit in October with some order cancellations
and has been subject to tax-loss selling the last month
or so.

I'd also like to bring up Deswell Industries again here.
A summary is over on my web site, but in brief, it's
a single digit PE stock with a solid balance sheet that
is well positioned to benefit from the telecom boom in
China as it operates in US dollars out of Hong Kong. It's
been brought up here before, and there's a great thread
run by Ron Bower here on SI. The MM's control it, but
long term I don't see how it can lose.

Anyone willing to give an opinion on Seagram (VO)

Interesting story that I'm trying to grasp. The Buffettology
book reveals it as a Buffett stock though it doesn't seem
to have Buffett-like ROE. There are a lot of hidden assets
and earnings power here though, and it is buying back loads
of stock with its cash flow. No use though - the stock is
at 52 week lows with no break in the trend in sight. Holds
$2 billion in TimeWarner stock plus a lot of cash which
makes for a strong balance sheet if not a bargain balance sheet.
Holds a consumer monopoly of sorts which is hidden by
acquisitions, depreciation etc. that makes accounting
earnings look bad.

This VO reminds me of Buffett and Pepsico. He bought KO instead of Pepsico(I

Since you are such a good guy Michael I will tell you the absolute true gen
about Seagram.

Once upon a time I knew the man who really built the profit center of Seagram.
He in fact was their CEO after the demise of the Senior Bronfman. In the 1950's
this man urged the senior Bronfman to buy a Texas oil company and get the
family into the oil business. The oil company they bought was eventually sold
to Marvin Davis and with the proceedes the company tried to buy Conoco and stay
in the oil business. Dupont bought Conoco, however, and Seagram wound up with
25% of Dupont... in a swap for the Conoco position amassed by the Bronfman's.

Do you follow this so far?

Now, the important point about Seagrams is that the liquor business is a dying
business IMHO. The dividends of Dupont were providing the major profits of
Seagram.

So, now what to do it you were a genuis businessman? Edgar, Jr. sells the
Dupont position and then buys 80% of Universal. No more dividends from oil
companies or Dupont. Dupont goes to a triple in the mkt from where they sold
it. Edgar Jr. composes music for Universal movies. The $8 billion Edgar paid
for Universal stays about $8 billion. The Dupont position is now worth about
$21 billion.

Hope your still here with me.

When I last looked the FAMILYowned something like 40% of Seagram. The reason
nothing will ever happen to Seagram is because the FAMILY will never give up
control. The stock will always be undervalued. Seagram was Edgar Snr's toy and
is now Edgar Jrs. toy.

THIS IS NOT A VALUE STOCK. I'm not sure its even a stock.

NB in financial circles in New York Edgar Jr's. nickname is "Twinkie".
I don't know where he got this name.

Doesnt look like comany has any present intent to call since warrants first
became callable in February this year. Also about 30 % of the days since
becoming callable the warrants actually traded at discount to stock. Since
warants are not very liquid an astute trader might wish to initiate a position
