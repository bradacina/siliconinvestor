I'm well aware of tyc's patterns over the past few years. I am also well aware
of other similar patterns of companies that grew recklessly through
acquisitions. The end results are not good. I know its hard for most credit
card mentality investors to understand, but the bill does come due eventually.
When you have $50 billion in debt and are borrowing with a credit card to fund
operations you can't prolong the inevitable for more than a few months....and
you certainly can't go back to the equity markets to try and pay off that debt.
If their cash flow is so unbelievable, then why are they going to the local
bookie for money? It smacks of desperation to me.

Tyco Offers Proof It Is Healthy, Yet It Faces a Huge Debt in 2003

By JOHN HECHINGER
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Tyco International Ltd., seeking to raise its credibility with investors,
released detailed quarterly financial projections showing strong cash flow from
its operations, enough money to pay its debts and a $2.15 billion cash balance
at the end of 2002.

J. Brad McGee, a Tyco executive vice president, said the big industrial and
financial-services concern took the unusual step to make a strong case it
wasn't in financial distress. "We wanted to make sure questions about liquidity
were off the table," he said.

Analysts noted, however, that Tyco still faces as much as $12 billion in debt
coming due in 2003 and the company is under intense pressure to execute quickly
a recently announced plan to break into four pieces.

Tyco disclosed its quarterly projections in a filing late Thursday with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. As of 4 p.m. Friday, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, Tyco's shares rose $1.83 to $29.88 each. But the
shares remain 49% below where they started the year. Concern over Tyco's
complicated accounting, which started the decline, has evolved into deeper
scrutiny of its debts and liquidity.

"People said we need more data; they said 'Fine, we're happy to supply it,' "
said Darcy MacLaren, director of equity research at Safeco Asset Management,
which holds about one million Tyco shares. "As people gain comfort with the
numbers, they'll step back from the panic and look at the cash flow and say,
this thing is ridiculously cheap."

Tyco reversed its highly acquisitive strategy this past month and said it would
break itself up in an effort to increase shareholder value and simplify its
financial statements.

Stock and bondholders were spooked this past week when the company and its
finance unit, Tyco Capital, borrowed $14.4 billion through backup bank credit
lines because they feared they wouldn't be able to access their normal source
of short-term credit in the commercial-paper market. Companies usually reserve
such bank lines for emergencies. The company earlier borrowed $1.5 billion to
tide it through the breakup plan. Standard & Poor's downgraded Tyco's debt this
past week by three notches to triple-B from single-A. The latest rating remains
investment grade.

The new financial projections, which excluded the company's big Tyco Capital
finance unit, showed Tyco starting out the calendar year, the beginning of its
current fiscal second quarter, with $1.87 billion in cash. The company expects
to generate a hefty $4.6 billion in free cash flow -- which it defines as cash
generated from operations, minus capital spending and dividends -- in the four
quarters to the end of the calendar year.

Borrowings, repayments of short-term debt and $2.9 billion in anticipated
expenditures on acquisitions -- some already agreed to, some not -- were also
detailed in the filing, bringing the company to the $2.15 billion figure at
Dec. 31 of this year.

But Tyco reported negative cash flow of $215 million its fiscal first quarter
ended Dec. 31, 2001. Given that, and Tyco's recent acknowledgment of softness
in its electronics business, Albert J. Meyer, an analyst with David W. Tice &
Associates, called the cash-flow projections "very aggressive." The firm
publishes a newsletter for institutional investors and also manages Prudent
Bear Fund, which is short Tyco shares, meaning it is betting that the stock
price will fall.

Tyco's Mr. McGee said the fiscal first-quarter cash flow tends to be weak
because of bonuses and, calling the 2002 projections "conservative," said they
take into account the electronics weakness.

Some analysts also said the picture looks far less rosy in 2003, when Tyco
could face about $12 billion in debt payments coming due.

These analysts say that debt may be a reason why Tyco this week said it would
accelerate the breakup plan. One of Tyco's bank lines, for $3.9 billion, must
be paid back or renegotiated in February 2003. And Tyco may have to come up
with about $5.9 billion in 2003 under a complex arrangement with its
convertible bondholders. Of that amount, Tyco could be forced to come up with
$3.6 billion in cash in November 2003. The rest could be repaid in stock.

But Mr. McGee and some analysts say those deadlines would become moot if Tyco
manages to execute its breakup plan effectively. Under the plan, which calls
for an early sale of Tyco Capital and the company's plastics business, Tyco
would restructure its debt, paying down some $11 billion. Tyco bonds, which had
fallen to distressed levels early last week after Tyco tapped its bank lines,
had rallied sharply by week's end.

Glenn Reynolds, chief executive at CreditSights Inc., a New York bond-research
firm, said investors aren't focused on 2003 because Tyco , having lost the
market's confidence, has no choice but to pull off its breakup plan long before
its other debts come due. "There is a timeline here," he said. "They have a gun
aimed at their head. They have to execute."

Earlier this week, Tyco Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski, said the
electronics weakness and higher borrowing costs could cut 45 cents, or $900
million, from Tyco's previous estimate of the company's fiscal 2002 earnings of
$7.4 billion or $3.70 a share.

TSCM: Tyco

In my November column on Tyco TYC , when the stock was trading at $57.55, I
said that "after taking a peek behind the numbers at Tyco, you'll want to run,
not walk, away from this stock." It closed Thursday at $28.

I'm puzzled by the aggressive foray into this stock by so-called value
investors. And I'm not sure which financial statements Wall Street analysts are
reading (or not reading) because some of them are holding fast to projections
of Tyco stock at $65 or higher.

With top executives cashing in on stock options without reasonable disclosure,
an eight-figure payment to a director for "help" in an acquisition, unreported
acquisitions, credit problems, changed business strategy and numerous
misleading statements, I can't be confident in the numbers provided by Tyco. I
don't trust management, and I don't trust the accounting.

My educated guess is that Tyco is teetering on a precipice. Based on the way I
measure cash flow and the debt burden, I think the company is closer to
unraveling than people think.

TSCM: Convertible Bond Worries Come to the Fore
By Justin Lahart
02/22/2002 11:03

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mass of convertible debt that got brought to market in the last two years
may be coming home to roost.

Companies have been issuing so-called converts, or bonds that turn into stock
at a predetermined price, as never before. After growing by 45% in 2000,
convertible issuance doubled last year, reaching $102 billion. With the stock
market sputtering and lenders turning conservative, converts enticed issuers by
dangling a juicy stock payout -- down the road, meaning the deals weren't
immediately dilutive to shareholders.

But with the economy stagnant and the tech-spending bubble long deflated, debt
of all kinds has become a losing proposition. In the wake of the failures of
debt-heavy Enron and Global Crossing , risk-averse stock and bond investors
have been distancing themselves from practically any company with big interest
payments ahead; even seemingly solid companies, including Sprint , are facing
the prospect of being shut out of the market for low-cost short-term commercial
paper financing.

Many of the companies that issued converts last year were risky propositions
that have lately fallen on hard times. As a result, some convertible investors
have suffered -- losses in the convert market recently forced two hedge funds
run by Kenneth Lipper to cut their portfolios' value by about $315 million,
according to The Wall Street Journal .

Those losses could damage the issuers as well: Many of the companies that
brought convertible bonds to market last year agreed to unusually aggressive
terms that give investors the right to sell the bonds back to the companies if
the underlying stock doesn't perform well. In many cases the company has the
option of issuing more stock rather than paying cash, but issuers worry that
doing so can flood the market, further depressing their shares. The upshot is
that a device companies used only a year or two ago to raise cash now threatens
to drain their coffers just as greenbacks grow scarce.
Rust Belt?

The company that's had the worst problem with convertibles lately is Tyco TYC .
Tyco has issued some $7.7 billion in so-called zero-coupon convertibles, which
give investors the right to sell the bond back to the company, or "put" it, at
certain times.

Even though its zero-coupon converts don't start to become putable until next
year, the slide in Tyco's stock and worries about its bookkeeping have unnerved
convertible investors. As a hedge, many funds that owned Tyco's converts had
shorted the stock to limit risk. Typically a fund that had made this hedge
would cover the short as Tyco's convert fell through the price at which it was
putable.

But convertible holders became concerned about Tyco's credit quality as its
stock and bonds slid and accounting rumors swirled. Damaged credit quality
would make it harder for Tyco to raise the cash it would need if investors put
its converts to it. To hedge against this possibility, according to ABN Amro
convertible analyst Richard Nelson, funds that held Tyco converts shorted even
more Tyco. That sent Tyco's stock down even further.

Tyco may have had the biggest headache with its converts, but it certainly
isn't alone. According to ConvertBond.com, Cox Enterprises , the majority
investor in Cox Communications COX , got $454.5 million worth of a convertible
issue -- some 99% of the outstanding bonds -- put back to it on Feb. 15. Cox
Communications has an additional convert with a put date today; Cox said
Tuesday it would toss some extra cash to investors who continue to hold past
the put date. Cox shares, already down 23% this year, slid 3%. The company's
cash position appears sound. But even in the best-case scenario, in which all
the convertible investors take it up on its offer, it will have around $13
million less to play with.
New Era?

Cox's convertible, brought to market a year ago, was one of a new breed.
Whereas in the past, put dates on convertibles typically came along several
years after issuance, in 2001, explains Advent Capital Management portfolio
manager Barry Nelson, many issuers opted to have a put date after the first
year. In many cases the bonds also offered extremely high conversion yields. So
if a company's stock didn't perform well, it risked having its convert put back
to it in short order. Cox didn't return calls for comment by publication time.

"I'm surprised companies made such big bets on their stocks going up," says
Nelson. "It's as though issuers thought the euphoria in the stock market would
return."

A number of converts look like they could get cashed in on their put dates over
the coming months. Janus parent Stilwell Financial's SV zero-coupon convert
issued April last year was structured in a way that if its stock didn't rise
significantly over the next 12 months, investors could easily justify putting
the convert back to it. Stilwell's stock has fallen 20% since then, and the
company could be on the hook for up to $697 million worth of cash or stock come
April 30. A Stilwell spokeswoman says the company expects to the have cash and
credit facilities in place to pay investors if its convert gets put to it. The
company may also consider other options, like Cox did, as the put date
appoaches.

In similar straits, hotelier Marriott MAR has seen its stock fall 19% since it
issued its convert in April last year. It could have $411 million put to it May
5. The stock of semiconductor equipment maker Novellus Systems NVLS has dropped
15% since it issued its convert last July. It could get put to the tune of $862
million. Neither company returned calls for comment by publication time.

As with Cox, such companies will work to find some way to manage. Calpine CPN ,
for example, sold $1 billion in new convertible debt in December, partly so it
could buy back some of the mass of converts that will likely get put back to it
April 30. And while both Cox and Calpine were able to steer away from trouble,
it's clear that the underwater convertibles became just one more hazard to deal
with.

These days, that's another hazard companies don't need.

Softechie, blankmind, etc.,

Respectfully, I would invite you to move any discussion of Tyco to the Tyco
Thread. I realize that it is not my place to tell people where to post but IMHO
Tyco does not fit the type of value model that this thread prefers. Plus, the
amount of discussion is such that it could quickly swamp any other topic.

I could be wrong and, if so, so much the better. But the stock has been
mentioned several times already.

JMHO,
Terrapin

PS:
The stock options were reported according to the rules of the day.
The payment was admitted to be a mistake and corrective measures have been
taken to prevent a recurrence.
The acquisitions were reported and the articles claiming that they weren't have
been retracted.
The credit problems were precipitated by rumors of accounting problems that
simply haven't been proved despite increased disclosure, weekly conference
calls, and heightened scrutiny.
Changed business strategy? They didn't like it as a conglomerate but they can
criticize it for breaking up?
Please post any misleading statements that have been made.
Tyco's accounting has been approved by their analysts (I know, I know), a
reputable accounting firm, the S&P, and the SEC. I do not know why I should
trust TheStreet.Com over the SEC.

Sorry thread, but I couldn't keep my mouth shut.

There's always been a "rule" that when we've gone past 20 posts on an
individual stock, the discussion should be taken to the specific stock thread.
(If I recall correctly, that was requested by Mike Burry when he created this
thread and supported by him when he was active here.)

The rule's good imo, because it does tie the stock comments to the specific
thread and yet by a 20 post discussion here, value investors will have become
acquainted with the stock and some aspects of it. And by then, people here
either have decided they have no interest in the stock, or else they can go to
the specific stock thread. Further, the people on the specific thread (who
might not be reading this value thread) will, imo, benefit from reading the
viewpoints of value investors on their thread.

The stated purpose of this thread is to look for value plays. It seems to me by
about 20 posts on a specific stock, the play's been identified. While there's a
lot more to learn about some of these stocks like Tyco (e.g convertible bond
dangers), that too gets brought to thread's attention by 20 posts.

It's a good rule and has worked well for this thread.

though I think I have a pretty accurate idea <g>).

Discussion has become a bit emotional at times. The issues have basically
boiled down to whether or not management has committed fraud. This suspicion
has caused the bond market to close its doors thus exacerbating an already
tight debt situation.

As long as somebody promises to let me know when the 20 post limit has been

I don't know how many read the "High-Tech Strategist" newsletter, but the March
2002 issue was simply amazing. It was Fred's mention to the NY Times regarding
IBM that started the concern about the recent IBM accounting issues.

As a firm believer in balance sheet & income statement issues, this newsletter
is the best value out there. He is openly pessimistic when appropriate (taking
short positions & long puts).

The March 2002 issue was a -- simply put -- scathing fact- based quantitative
analysis of IBM. If the sell-side couldn't identify these issues of one of the
biggest firms in the world, then they have zero credibility (still).

The issue for investors, as I see it, isn't that employees are compensated with
options, but that the compensation isn't accounted for on the income statement.
This causes compensation expenses to be understated, earnings to be overstated
and comparability suffers.
Another business issue, though, is whether option awards are an appropriate
motivator. For someone with company-wide responsibilities, it would be. But for
lower level business sub-unit and middle managers, compensation targeted
directly at the performance of the business unit or area of responsibility
would probably give more bank for the buck since they can't significantly
impact the total business. It's probably the lack of expense impact that shifts
a lot of compensation towards options that do little to motivate unit specific
performance.

I've started looking at Tyson (TSN) as my next purchase. Their acquisition of
IBP is going well. Their cash flow is strong, so they can pay down the debt
they assumed in the IBP deal. The dark cloud is the tangle with US Gov't over
immigration law violations. This won't impact the company over the short haul.

Compared to the Food Processing Industry their PE is lower than average, but
that may be due to their relatively low net margins (1.5% vs 6.2%) and ROE

If I'm not mistaken, foreign issuers are still required to file reports with

<<<Don, how do you evaluate non recourse debt in your deliberations.>>>

To be honest, I don't recall running across the term before. I did pull up some
filings as I remember looking at AES as a possibility for short play with
options. From what I could puzzle out of the filings, "non recourse" debt means
the individual subsidiaries guarantee the debt rather than the parent company.
It also looks like there are covenants on this type of debt which prohibits
distributions of earnings from the subs to the parent company. The set up looks
like it's intended as damage control in case they want to bankrupt one of the
subs separately from the rest of the company. It also looks like they've had to
issue additional debt against their subs which is guaranteed by the parent
company.

Maybe someone else can offer some insight into "non recourse" debt, since it
isn't an issue I know much about. For the time being, I'll probably stick to my
theory that an honestly profitable company should have a debt to equity ratio
below .20. Leveraging assets to invest in the future of the company is probably
good business in a lot of cases, but it seems to me there is a break point
where it stops being an investment in the future of the company and becomes a
gamble on the future of the company. There are so many companies out there that
will never repay their debt that it's scary, and most of those are only able to
service their debt through borrowing more money. They can get away with it as
long as business conditions are perfect, but one misstep or wobble in their
market and the whole thing comes crashing down.

Allen,

You might find this from Zacks interesting:

http://my.zacks.com/reports/reports.php3?HLITE1=6699BC&HLITE2=DEDEC5&ticker=ALU
session=TMP.JEFFREY&type=3

I honestly don't know how accurate their numbers are or if their calculations
are realistic. As close as I can tell, it's a ballpark guess what assets are
typically worth in a liquidation, and I'd be willing to bet it's a computer
generated model which doesn't include any kind of "human" analysis. I'm sure
there are as many concepts of what constitutes value as there are value
investors. Book value is one of the places I screen for value on the theory
that if the stock represents real assets, it should be worth more. The flip
side is if the assets are maxed out on leverage, book value becomes meaningless
because the creditors own the assets, not the shareholders.

It seems to me that an established, profitable company should show a pattern of
decreasing debt. Instead what I see on a large percentage of these companies is
a steady pattern of increasing debt every single quarter. If these companies
are so profitable, why can't they pay their bills without borrowing more money?
When a company is reporting losses, the consensus seems to be to look at cash
burn as a way to establish value, but when a company is reporting profits,
somehow the whole concept of cash burn goes right out the window. Maybe I'm
suffering from tunnel vision, but I want to see something tangible behind my
share of stock and not just bookkeeping entries. Jumping in the back of a long
line of creditors and watching the line get longer in front of me every quarter
isn't my idea of value.

Being that you've beaten Forbes to the punch with your pick of ALU, and given
that I didn't see any other stocks in article that looked interesting to me,
I'd say a special trip to the library for Forbes reading is not necessary. OTOH
(there's always an otoh with me -g-), Forbes is worth reading for me when I
come across it at libraries, bookstores, decent supermarket magazine counters.
After all, if there's even one stock in one article that the reader gloms on
to, and if that stock works out, then it was very profitable and
cost-effective. I'm a library user all my life after I began reading, so I
can't really be comfortable saying to somebody, "Don't go to the library."
(Might be different if I knew your local library was hundreds of miles from
your home though.) For me, I'm lucky my local library is near where I live, so
it's a nice walk for me.

Here's something I found in Forbes.com (I didn't see the Ben Graham article

I'll toss one out as a possibility. I mentioned it back in September when it
was trading a little above $1. It went as high as $3 and is currently trading
at $1.90. INLD is what used to be Micron Electronics (MUEI) before they
divested their PC operations to focus on web hosting. One of the things I
didn't like about the stock is their former parent company, Micron Technology,
held something like 50 million shares on INLD and everything in the filings
suggested they could hardly wait to get rid of it. That stock has since found
its way into the hands of institutional investors who supposedly intend to keep
it as a longer term investment.

One of the things I still don't like about the company is when they divested
the PC business, there were no "hold harmless" agreements to indemnify
Interland against suits left over from Micron Electronics. Those suits are
still pending and I don't know of any way to assess a risk factor to the
eventual outcome.

So far the company is still burning cash and is not likely to stop for at least
another 3 quarters.

Their current strategy is growth through acquisitions. It appears to be a
buyers market and so far it looks like their targets are focused on value. Book
value is $2.02 which is about half cash and half goodwill. The company is
basically debt free with a debt to equity ratio of .13.

There was one "strong buy" rating on the stock and Kaufman Bros initiated
coverage yesterday with a "buy" rating. I've been in and out of this one a few
times with fairly small positions and just started a new position. In my
experience, it's fairly rare for analysts to show much interest in the under $5
stocks and I'm not sure if I've ever seen a brokerage start coverage with a buy
rating on a stock trading under $2.

To be honest, I still can't quite decide if this one is a diamond in the rough
or a dog that needs to be put down. It has the kind of balance sheet I like,
but as Bob puts it, it has a few warts. There's a potential cup and handle
pattern forming, but so far no breakout off the handle to confirm a reversal.
I've been watching this one for awhile and still can't make up my mind if it's
a good value or just cheap.

At any rate, I figured I'd mention it. If nothing else, it seemed fair to pick
apart one of my own picks instead of just everyone elses.

Allen,

Start on the Zacks home page and use the pull down menu for "the whole
enchalada".

FWIW, I don't think the "bankruptcy risk" section of Zacks represents any
immediate danger of bankruptcy in the majority of companies. What it does do is
give some kind of an indication of what the assets would be worth were the
company to be liquidated. A LOT of these companies will go for many years
borrowing money and reporting profits. I doubt you'll find any company with a
debt to equity ratio much over .5 that shows a liquidation value above zero.
I'm not trying to start a panic, but I do think debt ratios need to be
considered as part of the picture when evaluating book value. I also believe
those companies with high debt levels are the most vulnerable to accounting
changes to plug up the holes in GAAP. I sincerely doubt there will be any firm
proposals on accounting changes before the end of this year. I also suspect
there will be plenty of lobbying against the changes for quite awhile after
they are proposed. There's a lot of big money that stands to loose if they
can't cook the books. As bearish as I am, I find it hard to imagine much of
anything affecting the quarterly reports sooner than 2 years out.

What I think that will mean to value investors is a shift in focus away from PE
and book value, toward a focus on debt levels and cash flow. I also think
there's some benefit to be had from looking at places to raise cash in the mean
time to: 1) reduce exposure, and, 2) be prepared for bargain hunting.

I think I've seen just about every investing mistake ever made mentioned on the
message boards at one time or another except for one. The mistake I've made
that has always caused me the most harm is to let cash in my trading account
burn a hole in my pocket. When I finally got it through my thick head to
concentrate on protecting cash rather constantly looking for something to buy,
my fortunes seemed to change quite a bit. For example, on September 11th, my
trading account was 80% cash. I don't know what everyone else was doing for the
4 days the market was closed, but I was running a lot of screens and reading a
lot of filings. A week after the market reopened, I was buying stocks that
already looked dirt cheap at a 30-50% discount to their pre September 11
closing prices. It let me take profits and return to mostly cash at a time
where I normally would have been sweating to get back to even. I think the end
result is I've kind of fallen in love with the idea of cash as an investment.
At least I have a lot better idea what my account is worth if I wake up and
find the excrement has hit the whirly blade.

One brief comment on options that I did not see made. In at least the
technology area, there is only one way that a small company could attract a
senior level management person from a successful company to be CEO - OPTIONS.

XICO is an example, where Lou DiNardo left a high level job at LLTC (and a load
of goodies) for the opportunity to run his own company as CEO, plus 600,000
options at the prevailing price of $3.75. Boy am I pleased with the job he has

Bob,

As close as I can tell on INLD it's a situation where it costs as much to host
300K accounts as it does to host 500K accounts. Their strategy so far looks to
be mainly purchasing accounts and hosting those accounts on existing
facilities. In theory they should eventually reach a point where the customer
base is large enough to support the cost of the facilities.

I agree the cash burn is higher than I would like to see. The only thing good
about it is that there does seem to be a pattern of the burn rate decreasing,
although a best guess is they will probably use another $60 million before (if)
they hit a break even point.

This is one I more or less planned to watch for another 6-12 months to see how
they perform before taking anything like a longer term position in the stock. I
still consider INLD more of a trading stock than an investing stock. "IF" they
execute, $2 is cheap, if they don't, $1 would be expensive. I was half
expecting to see better entry levels as a result of the Micron held shares
hitting the market, but since those shares have changed hands, it seems like
there might be some motivation on the part of the new institutional holders to
promote the stock.

I think there is fundamental value behind the stock, but my current position is
probably based more on technical reasons than anything else. It looks to be
coming out of an oversold condition on a retest of the last support level,
which can be a good entry point for trading positions. As a buy and hold play,
it probably makes sense to wait a few more quarters to see what kind of numbers
they turn in. I don't think it's a bad one to put on a watch list to see what
it does.

Options for the CEO makes sense...rewards from growth in value of stock matches
CEO's enterprise wide responsibilities. But the accounting rules should be
changed so the economic value of those options is reflected as compensation
expense on the income statement. With such a change the results would be more
comparable to a company that chose to compensate it's CEO strictly in cash or
with a greater or lesser portion of options.
Would generally agree with Jim Clark and others that repricing options is a bad
idea...with possible exception of share price hits totally unrelated to
management performance [911 events, earthquake], but these would be very rare
since dealing with risks is also a management responsibility.

<<<But the accounting rules should be changed so the economic value of those

I guess I still don't follow the reasoning that options should be treated as
basically what amounts to a cash charge against EPS. Options already affect EPS
in the form of dilution and taking a second hit on some theoretical pricing
model doesn't make sense to me.

Capitalizing operating costs to pad the numbers is an accounting issue.
Depreciating capital equipment that wears out in 5 years on 10 year basis is an
accounting issue. Taking one time charges to pad the numbers backward or
forward is an accounting issue. Taking a hit for a non cash item that is
already accounted for as dilution to EPS and shareholder equity is not.

I think the issue is based more on the abuse of options many of us have seen
and lumping any kind of abuse in with accounting abuse. As an owner, or
potential owner, in a company's stock, I certainly don't want to see my stock
overly diluted. I also don't want to make buying decisions based on fantasy
numbers cooked up by accountants. At the same time I can't imagine why anyone
would want to see additional charges, which don't cost the company anything,
affect the earnings and market value of my holdings any more than it already
does in the form of dilution.

If options are an accounting issue at all, it would be a matter of more
disclosure on when and how they are issued. I'd love to see a table in the
quarterly reports showing how many options were issued, to whom, the exercise
dates and strikes. Arbitrarily assigning costs to non cash entries is more
likely to cause abuse than cure it. How do you treat options that expire out of
the money? Count it as income? Do you issue options every quarter? Or take a
hit once a year? Or maybe issue them when there is some advantage to be gained
by taking the charge?

Personally I think we have enough real problems with accounting issues without
opening a whole new can of worms.

FUTURE MAY BE MORE UNCERTAIN FOR TECHNOLOGY
June 20, 2001 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON NYT

With the Nasdaq composite index up 23 percent from its April lows, investors
are clearly betting that the worst is over for technology stocks. But according
to an extensive new report from Merrill Lynch that examines the financial
results of 37 technology favorites, those bets may be premature.

The study shows that even at their current depressed levels, TECHNOLOGY SHARES
REMAIN EXPENSIVE. That is because long before the economy turned south and even
as their reported earnings soared, technology stocks' true earnings had begun
deteriorating.

"On average, REAL TECH EARNINGS ARE LESS THAN THEY APPEAR," said Steve
Milunovich, technology strategist at Merrill Lynch. "As a result, VALUATIONS
ARE HIGHER THAN INVESTORS THINK."

The EARNINGS SLIDE AMONG TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES STARTED THREE YEARS AGO, BUT THE
DETERIORATION WAS HIDDEN FROM MANY INVESTORS' VIEWS BY ACCOUNTING GIMMICKRY AND
A ROARING STOCK MARKET.

Everybody knows that a rising stock market lifts all boats. But as Mr.
Milunovich's study shows, the market's big surge that began three years ago
lifted the largest technology stocks far higher than it did other sectors. Now,
with the overall market in the doldrums, technology companies' earnings in
future quarters will lack a lot of the juice that made them seem so
superpowered in the recent past.

Perhaps the SINGLE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO TECHNOLOGY STOCK EARNINGS DURING THE
MANIA WAS THE USE OF STOCK OPTIONS, which these companies BESTOWED ON EMPLOYEES
IN LIEU OF HIGHER SALARIES. Technology companies BENEFITED TWO WAYS FROM
OPTIONS. FIRST, because the COST OF STOCK OPTION GRANTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED A
WAGE EXPENSE, the EARNINGS AT COMPANIES GIVING OUT LARGE OPTION GRANTS LOOKED
BETTER THAN THE RESULTS AT COMPANIES THAT PAID CASH TO WORKERS.

In ADDITION, companies RECEIVE SIZABLE TAX DEDUCTIONS FROM STOCK OPTIONS WHEN
THEY ARE EXERCISED. That is BECAUSE EMPLOYEES WHO EXERCISE THEIR OPTIONS MUST
PAY INCOME TAX ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OPTION'S STRIKE PRICE AND THE
CURRENT MARKET PRICE, AND COMPANIES RECEIVE A TAX DEDUCTION IN THAT AMOUNT.
THESE TAX BENEFITS SHOW UP IN A COMPANY'S OPERATING CASH FLOW.

Mr. Milunovich and Gary Schieneman, an accounting analyst at Merrill Lynch,
computed what these two benefits contributed to earnings at the technology
companies they studied, including America Online, now AOL Time Warner; Applied
Materials; Microsoft; Sun Microsystems; Juniper Networks; and Qualcomm.

Had the companies considered their options a wage cost, their 2000 earnings
would have been reduced an average of 60 percent. More specifically, earnings
would have been 49 percent lower at America Online, 40 percent lower at Nortel
Networks and 63 percent less at Lucent Technologies if options had been
accounted for as an expense.

The tax deductions associated with employee option grants also gave these
companies a big boost, on average accounting for 48 percent of their operating
cash flows. That is double the contribution made by option grants in 1999.

For instance, stock option tax benefits made up 67 percent of operating cash
flow at Sun Microsystems, 41 percent at Cisco Systems, 34 percent at Yahoo and
30 percent at Juniper Networks.

Mr. Milunovich said that these tax benefits helped mask a severe deterioration
in technology companies' cash flows that began three years ago. When he
compared cash flows to earnings, he found the ratio fell from 2.2 to 1 in 1998
to 1.2 to 1 last year. But when he excluded the tax benefits owing to option
exercise, cash flows declined to roughly equal the level of earnings. When a
company's cash flow falls below its earnings, it indicates the inclusion of
significant noncash items in a company's income.

Thanks to the desultory stock market, both stock option benefits are now
becoming banes. Falling share prices have made many employees' options
worthless; as of late March, Mr. Milunovich estimated that 41 percent of the
options handed out by the companies he studied were underwater.

Mr. Milunovich suspects that the companies with large numbers of underwater
options will reprice them in coming months to reflect depressed stock levels.
As a result, he says he thinks some managements may have an incentive to keep
their stocks' prices depressed until the period — six months and one day —
passes that repricings can occur without a company taking a hit to its earnings
under accounting rules.

According to Mr. Milunovich, it is more important than ever for investors in
technology stocks to look closely at these companies to assess their earnings.
"Cash is king," he said. "Tech investors who haven't focused on cash flow have
to start looking at it." And for now, anyway, they may not like what they see.
<<Personally I think we have enough real problems with accounting issues
without opening a whole new can of worms.>>The can is already open. There's
been heated debate over recognizing options on the income statement for quite
awhile. And yes, there will be some impact on tech companies that have relied
heavily on the practice once their real earnings are revealed. We are going to
go towards the point where GAAP reported earnings are meaningfull. Enron is the
catalyst. It's going to happen, IMO. So as a value investor, if you have
holdings in something that's not going to have such great earnings if options
are reflected as compensation, you may wish take a hard look at it.

Bob and Don, your posts are worth commenting on (based on my long ago
accounting training).

Options should be counted as compensation and it easy to account for. The
reason they should is easy to see with a simple example. Let's say a CEO
chooses to take all options instead of cash salary - he sure isn't being paid
nothing.

The accounting is simple. At date of issuance, a liability is charged to the
compensation account for the Black-Scholes value of the option based on price
of stock, exercise price and duration. This liability account (and related
partial tax liability offset) constantly changes as the parameters change. When
the option expires, the liability account with respect to the expiring option
is credited and the cash compensation account is debited (with little effect on
the income statement at that moment with respect to the expiring option).

On the other hand, I believe that these articles such as you posted border on
hysterical, to make some academic's point. If you had a stable stock market, I
suspect (but do not know) the option expense for most large, profitable
companies would not be a material percent of earnings. Furthermore, if this had
been in effect, earnings reported right now are severely understated - because
the large option liability at the stock market peak would have been shrinking
like crazy, enhancing reported earnings.

Since the option value compensation at exercise eventually hits the income
statement, this is more a matter of properly allocating expense to time periods
than avoiding it altogether.

In my opinion, the values of options should either be directly accounted for or
included in a footnote, but not ignored. I tend to favor the latter as I am not
nuts about the idea of making reported earnings fly all over the place with the
stock market.

I am neither an accountant nor 1/10th the stock analyst that guys like Bob and
Don are but I won't let that stop me from chiming in on this issue.

To me, there is a huge practical issue with accounting for options in the
earnings calculation. Why would you want to include a charge based on any
theoretical model - much less one that is krap regardless of how many prizes
have been awarded? I don't say that based on personal analysis but rather I'm
merely listening to the market.

Today, one can get Jan 2004 INTC $55 leaps for 1.35 despite the BS model saying
they are worth 1.96. Would you charge Intel 1.96 on earnings for something they
can purchase in the open market for 1.35?

OTOH, one must pay 0.90 for Jan 2004 MSFT $120 leaps although BS says they are
only worth 0.37. So Microsoft gets away with subtracting only 0.37 when their
true market cost would be more than twice that.

So I'm with Don on this one, require better disclosure of option compensation
because it is important to know about it. But don't include (even more) bad,
made-up numbers in the earnings calculations.

<<<The accounting is simple.>>>

I've been reading SEC filings for 6 years and I still get lost in places. Math
is simple, accounting isn't. At least with math there is only one right
solution to a problem.

If I buy a $10 stock and sell calls for $2 with a $10 strike, I've made $2
which I get to keep no matter what happens. If I get called on the stock, I get
my $10 back and the $2 is profit. If I were able to print up shares for free
and sell calls with a $10 strike for $2, my profit would be $12 cash if the
options were exercised.

If I were able to print up shares for free and trade $2 worth of options for $2
worth of labor, and the options are exercised, I make $10 cash profit, plus $2
worth of labor for a $12 profit. It doesn't matter how much or how little the
person receiving the options in exchange for labor is able to make on the
options, as that is a transaction with third parties not related to either of
us.

I could almost make sense out of an argument that my $12 gain on the sale of
stock and options should be recorded as other income and treated as capital
gains, but it's a mystery to me how taking profits on something that didn't
cost me a dime is an expense. Even if the $2 were to be considered
compensation, the flip side of the exchange is I've received $2 worth of labor
as compensation for the options which still didn't cost me anything. Maybe it's
a barter transaction, but I don't see how it could be an expense. At least
that's the way it would look if it were a math problem.

As an accounting problem, I'd treat the $2 as income and capitalize the options
as an asset to be depreciated over the life of the contract. Then I'd issue a
bunch of press releases about how great the cash flow is from all the stock
sales, although I probably wouldn't mention that was where the cash was coming
from.

<<I guess I still don't follow the reasoning that options should be treated as

You are correct later in your post that the biggest problem is what value to
use, what is an option worth not knowing the future and any smart value
investor will tell you a Black Scholes theoretical valuation is garbage.

But the reason this is THE MOST IMPORTANT accounting distortion is twofold:
1) the scale - EVERY company does this. Its rare now to find a company with
less than 5% of its shares outstanding diluted by options and issuing less than
1% more a year. Most I look at its 10 and 2. 2% a year dilution given that long
term returns from capital appreciation are in the order of 6% is a HUGE number.
2) Income statement accounting is based on expenses being matched with
revenues. Saying options show up in dilution doesn't cut it, because that shows
up years later. Take a very clear example. I got paid last year. That showed up
on my public company employer's income statement. I also got bonuses. That
showed up on its income statement. (Don't worry, I'm not even a rounding
error!). But they also gave me options. That was something of value paid to me
for work I did last year, but it shows up nowhere on the company's financial
statements. Whats the difference bewteen that and cash compensation IF THE
INCOME STATEMENT IS SUPPOSED TO REFLECT WHAT IT COSTS TO COMPENSATE EMPLOYEES
FOR THEIR SERVICES. Thats the problem.

But it costs nothing. The options only cost the company a small amount to
administer the options program. Yes they do have a cost to the shareholders in
terms of dilution but that isn't a cost to the company it is just devideing the
same company over more shares. But if you do decide to count that as a cost the
cost of the dilution doesn't show up until and unless the stock is diluted. If
they are never exercised there is no cost to the shareholders. If they are
exercised the cost is the dilution and shouldn't be double counted by lowering
earnings and spreading out the lower figure among more shares when you
calculate EPS.

It's been close to 20 years since I studied Black-Scholes, but the one thing I
remember about it is that a key assumption is that there be a liquid market for
the option.

This has never been the case for employee stock options. BS is meant for freely
tradable options. It is applied to ISO's only because GAAP says that's how you
do it, not because Black or Scholes ever thought it made sense. The bean
counters said "we have to count them somehow" and BS was the only way they
could find, I guess.

I have seen a lot of cases where the BS value was far less than the value
imputed by the optionee. This can occur because the optionee often has inside
information about the company (or at least thinks he/she does). Options grants
tend to be largest when there is a perception that the stock price is going to
rise. Whether these perceptions are right or not is beside the issue; the
optionee values the receipt of the options based on those perceptions, and
that's one of the best measure of the value that I can come up with.

Obviously there's no "right" way to value ISO's and NSOs objectively. I'd much
rather have them laid out in a table in the 10Ks and 10Qs, quarter by quarter
-- grantee (at least for officers, directors, and non-employees--a lump sum for
everyone else), grant date, strike price, stock price on grant date, expiration
date. I'd also require an 8-K whenever an option grant is made that is greater
than a certain percentage of the outstanding stock, probably around 1%.

I've constructed this information many times from K's, Q's, and proxy
statements, and you would be amazed at how often companies conveniently
"forget" to tell you about the options they granted. It's exceedingly difficult
to get a good picture of just how much of the store they are giving away to get
the services of key employees. This is particularly true of companies who post
negative net income, where nobody ever looks at the fully diluted share count
because it isn't used in the EPS calculation.

I could care less whether they have to expense a fair market value, because
whatever number they come up is ultimately arbitrary. I care a lot that option
compensation be clearly disclosed, so that any investor can decide for him or
herself whether it's justified.

Just my two cents.

When discussing how earnings can be (or are) manipulated by management to

flow per share) might be a better representation of company performance or be a
better metric to use by analysts in determining the value of a company. The

I think the problem is that any substitute for compensation has to be looked at
as an ongoing process rather than as the one-time dilution it is usually
assumed as. A company that inflates its shares by 5% a year will, over the
course of 14 years, double its share count, so halving any original investment.

Given that the stock market as a whole is diluting at a rate of 2% a year and
that the long term real growth rate in eps is between 1% and 2%, something has

On the off topic topic.

<<<Somebody ought to do jail time for putting them through the

Agree. Unfortunately, people with money never do jail time. If a burglar breaks
into your house, leaves finger prints all over the place, and the police catch
him watching a ballgame on your TV; the burglar is in jail within a matter of
minutes, the investigation takes a matter of days, and the burglar is in prison
within a matter of months. When the amounts stolen start reaching the multi
million range, the police wouldn't think of putting the thief in jail, the
investigation takes years, and the penalties end up amounting to a commission
on the ill gotten gains and a slap on the wrist.

If anyone wants a real wake up call, go to the SEC site and have a look through
their settlements for fraud actions. Why on Earth would anyone even pretend to
be honest when there is virtually no punishment whatsoever even if you do get
caught? For some reason stealing a $300 TV is a more serious crime than
stealing someone's life savings. If our justice system treated burglary the
same way it treats fraud, you'd be spending 20 grand a year to put your kids
through burglary college.

That FLE is revisiting lows while some pretty junky stuff is recovering nicely,

Blankmind/SOFN: 6-7 Bagger?

I was interested, as a person with no position in sofn, to see how it played
out. On 2/15 you indicated that sofn had a value of "$13 + intangibles" vs. a
current price of $1.96. Does your current pick (esref) have more upside than a
6-7 bagger?

I was a little surprised to see the switch -- based upon your prior comments.

3/6/02

- sold my softnet (sofn) & put the proceeds into ESG Re (ESREF)

2/15/02

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/msg_multireplies.gsp?msgid=17068021

mrcj, "3/31/02" is just the date Softnet (SOFN) plans on making the
announcement on a buyer - but as far as valuations - i'd like to say $13 - but
i'll be happy with half that amount
total curr assets: $79.5 mill
- restricted cash & other non-curr assets: $8 mill
- total liabil: $11 mill
- shs o/s: 25.2 mill
- therefore: $76.5 mill/25.2 = $3.04/share

- then there's the $400 mill in loss carry-forwards; which at 40% federeal is
equivalent to $160 mill; divided by 25.2 mill shs is $6.35/share

- then you have the broadband satellite segment which appears to be doing very
well & can hopefully fetch $100 mill; which is $4 share

- then you have certain intangibles, like the fact that SOFN is NASDAQ listed
company

- if you add up each of these, you get $3+6+4=$13+ intangibles

Walllace: Speaking about drug store chains, I'm considering buying RAD.

Do you or anybody else here who's interested in this sector have an opinion on
it at current price? I just don't see a margin of safety, yet if the sector is
moving, RAD might have more room too. (It already has moved up, but price only
has moved from $1.85 to $3.05/sh. Perhaps I am fooling myself here, because
with 500M sh. out. that small move (only $1.20 move in the stock price) has
already added lots to market capitalization.)

There's some insider buying. I still see plenty of cars in RAD parking lots in
my area. Nice fixtures/displays upgrade in my local store too.

Hi, Paul:

I wish I could provide some insight on RAD other than the standard....high debt
load, troubled company, management turmoil, etc.
It's my least favorite of the "big three" to shop at (not surprisingly, CVS is
my favorite).
Not being bright enough to sift through the voluminous financials, I'll pass.
You are right, that the stock may have some interest from a risk/reward
perspective.
I was pleased with the move in CVS today, it far outperformed its peers (most
of which were down in a strong market).
I'm torn what to do, the stock has had a great move, but yesterday's comps.
were better than estimates, and, as I said, I kind of think there may be an
upgrade in the works.
That's the market, should I buy or sell!:>)

Wallace, I want to thank you for the information and support you provided me
here with your posts in '99 and '00 about RBMG. I never did add to my position
(@ $9+ to 10+) when the stock started to crater or during its trough.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RBMG&d=c&t=5y&l=on&z=b&q=l

I just did not have the confidence to add more when things looked so bleak.
Perhaps I should have asked for more assistance here!

Today I received NTBK shares in exchange for RBMG. NetBank (an internet savings
bank) will now be much more cost-effective in their ability to secure mortgage
loans for their customers. I plan to try to hold NTBK shares to see how the
company performs with their RBMG resources. (I am not suggesting NTBK as a
buy.)

Anyway, I suspect you've forgotten about your posts to me on RBMG, but I have
not. They have been helpful!

Thanks,

Paul Senior

Boy, Paul - RBMG, a real flash from the past for me. Made some $$$$ trading it
pre-crash, when Mr. G started ratcheting up rates. Never got back in, but
anyone who did really coined some $$$$.
Congrats on your win!
Speaking of ratcheting up rates, I and it seems like most others think that is
the most likely direction of interest rates in the near future.
To hedge against this, I've taken a small position in a closed end fund which I
mentioned here before - VVR (Van Kampen Senior Income Trust). This is
essentially a junk bond fund, consisting of relatively short term senior loans
(IMHO by being senior they are less "junky"). The dividend has been cut several
times recently, and may be cut again. However, I feel that the dividend will
uptick if and when rates start to back up, and the credit quality of the
underlying loans will improve were the economy to improve. Trades at a
significant discount to NAV - one of the issues with these loan participation
funds has been the quality of NAV; in the July '01 annual, it is stated that
97% of the loans are priced by an independent pricing agency, so I think
pricing is fair.
This one won't make anyone a hero, but I think it's a pretty good place to be
in this environment.

PGO. Thread: If anyone here is interested in reviewing a stock that seems to be
garnering strong interest on several S.I. threads, while at the same time still
being a stock that might actually (-g-) be a value stock for people here, then
PGO is that stock.

Seitel, a stock in the seismic data business similar to PGO, was discussed here
a couple of years back, and as I recall, posters who bought then did see decent
profits.

I don't own SEI (missed it back then too), but I have started a small position
in PGO. Company could have revenue accounting issues (barter agreements
recognized as sales ala SEI which is dissed in current Forbes for such "sales"
issues and management issues.)

I like PGO because it seems to be a standard value stock - low p/book, low
p/sales, and low current price compared to past prices in the oil/gas business
cycle.

I'll want to extra alert if I add to my position and how much I ultimately
take:
It's those bullish views by many apparently knowledgeable and successful and
confident S.I. posters who have been buying PGO - and buying very heavily, it
seems. For me, I can get caught up in the psychological issues related to all
that. Pride/shame factors, inclusion needs vs. exclusion fears, getting on
board the boat vs. missing the boat -- all that stuff that Ben Grahamers might
ignore -g-.

Paul,

PGO is in the process of being bought out by VTS at an exchange rate of .47 to
1. Assuming the price of VTS holds up that would make PGO worth about $6.90 in
the merger. Veritas is not a bad company, but I believe it's worth paying
attention to the fact the newly merged company will be incorporated in the
Cayman Islands. As far as PGO being a value stock, I don't see it. The company
has an unholy amount of debt and I was more than a little surprised Veritas
would consider the partnership. The only reason to buy PGO would be as a
potentially lower entry price on VTS, assuming the merger goes through which I
don't see any reason why it won't.

As far as Seitel is concerned, it's a bankruptcy waiting to happen, and
probably within the next 6 months. It's been downgraded twice in the last month
and received write ups in both Forbes and the WSJ on accounting issues. $39.4
million of Seitel's revenue for the last 9 months are non cash barter
transactions. The company also capitalizes around $4 million per year in
interest expenses and wages as assets to keep the costs off reported earnings.
They also depreciate their costs at about half the rate of the rest of the
sector. Seitel makes Enron look good by comparison. Put options on SEI are a
good value, but a person would have to have a death wish to hold the stock long
overnight.

Mrcjmoney - couple things on selling Softnet:

- it's one of the few stocks that I've consistently sold @ around $2 & bought
back; done several times; for 25% or so profit each time

- then the fact I'm looking more & more at the stock I put the proceeds into -
ESREF - ESG Re - which by all accounts is very undervaled - given that their
writign profitably; $9 book value; upgraded by rating agency

- also, on SOFN, I'm a bit nervous, as we're supposed to be 23 days away from a
buyer-related announcemnt; & no news. Also, they are burning thru cash so the
longer the delay, the worse.

Paul,

At least with headquarters in Houston, you get to watch the Senate
investigations on TV.

Seriously though, I do follow seismic and any company with over exposure to the
North American market probably has some downside risk over the next 12 months
or so. Veritas is fairly well diversified throughout the world and they do tend
to benefit from a backlog of business that tends to carry them through sector
weakness. It's very much a cyclic market and runs about 6-12 months behind oil
and natural gas prices. Close to 80% of the drilling activity in North America
is for natural gas. BHI publishes rig count numbers every Friday and historical
monthly figures are available on the BHI website. Exploration activity in North
America has been on a steady decline since last Summer. Partly due to lower
commodity prices, partly due to cutbacks in capital spending and partly due to
weather conditions in the Arctic areas where if the ground isn't frozen, they
can't move the equipment.

Veritas is fundamentally a reasonably sound company, but they don't have
anything close to the resources necessary to carry PGO if it gets in trouble,
and PGO is bring a lot of debt to the table even with the recent asset sales.
The Cayman Islands angle makes me a little leery, partly from personal
prejudice, and partly from watching how money tends to vanish when it hits the
money laundering capitol of the world. Also, as a general rule, I've found it
prudent to watch a company after anything like a merger of equals for at least
2 quarters before considering a position in the stock. The consolidation
process always takes at least that long, and I've found a lot of companies that
no longer look attractive once they've had a chance to mess things up. It also
seems like a lot of the excitement over the merger tends to wear off once it's
a done deal and all the one time charges start hitting the balance sheet. I
suspect it will be a situation where the first person to pull the trigger at
$6.90 wins, and everyone else gets what the littlest pig got. The combined
company has the potential to be a real powerhouse, but the consolidation
process is going to be taking place at near the bottom of the market cycle.

From reading your posts over the years my impression is you are more of an
investor than a short term trader. I think the merged company 'could' be worthy
of investment 6 months from now after the bugs have been worked out, but I also
think PGO is currently more appropriate for someone looking for a 15%-20% gain
on a short term trade and who is willing to take whatever is on the table
without getting greedy while playing with tight stops.

- ESREF - ESG Re-Insurance - incredible value provided they’re not hiding
something.

- best of all - they got upgraded by S&P

- I’m hoping the depressed stock price is due to one mutual fund or something;
& not more serious

- stock price is moving totally in opposite direction as the results they’ve
reported:

- stock price: $3.05

- book value: $9

- - profitable for the latest quarter; which hopefully is the start of a trend

Estimated 12/31/01 book value of $4.88 (not including insurance due from WTC

Based upon the above link & reply, I think it is fair to say that certain
comments were "disingenuous". I don't trust anyone -- so I am more inclined to
believe that certain comments were simply a blatant "hype" of sofn.

There is, in my opinion, no other way to explain how someone can post
repeatedly about a company -- selling for $2 that is worth $13 -- is now a sell
@ $2 because of "profit taking" by the individual.

Contrast that to someone like a Paul Senior, who lays it on the line in his
posts with honesty and humility.

I have found the "ignore" function to be very useful to weed out the fiction
posters from the nonfiction posters.
