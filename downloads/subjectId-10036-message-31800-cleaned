Penny stock Namoi Cotton looks good to me as well. I've made a very small buy.

Company has paid a dividend every year (going back several years). Now company
has some difficulty (earnings): Management says company is affected by drought.
So stock is down, I presume for this weather issue. I'll bet on weather
reversion by next year (Company is forecasting a doubling of total Australian
cotton production in '09); I'll bet on the company's sustainability, and so the
stock's reversion as well.

Couple other items:
I'm not sure how or if the current "1 Australian dollar = 0.8688 U.S. dollars"
relationship will affect Namoi's business/stock price. (Australian dollar has
been strong against the US dollar.)

It's a Weitz holding, and he's gotten absolutely hammered on it. However, they

hold to maturity.

They also produce a quarterly "Redwood Review" that does an excellent job of

Added to oil service provider (helicopters) Bristow Group.

A little expensive (p/e 11 now, with 3/'10 estimate about 10) compared to some
other oil service providers (e.g. RIG, NE). As off-shore developments are built
and maintained, I'll surmise demand for http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BRS 's
services will continue to be strong. The company is refocusing on deep-water
drilling.

"Our strong revenue increase this quarter reflects continued growth by both the
addition of new aircraft and improved pricing," William E. Chiles, president
and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
He added, "Although oil and natural gas prices have come off their historic
highs in recent weeks, we continue to expect customer demand to exceed the
supply of high-quality helicopters that customers want most over the next
several years."

"That's why Bristow chose to raise new capital and remains well positioned with
manufacturers for new helicopters, which will ensure that we can take advantage
of these strong market conditions."

Sjemmeri, here's one that seems to me to a good value and a good bet. Jumping
up my position substantially today, but not so much that I'm going for a
significant portfolio position: I'm too unsure of what I've got with this stock
and too concerned I've missed considering significant stuff that other people
("the market") know, that I don't.

Deswell has been mentioned here for many years. A favorite discussion topic in
1998. At that time, several respected people here were buying it.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=6065110&srchtxt=deswell

I saw the company as basically a injection molding shop - worth a single digit
multiple at most, and the company not having any proprietary assets. The stock
performed well subsequently though - despite my scoffings. Ten years later the
situation is different.

DSWL.

The stock at $4.80+- is at about an 8 year low.

It sells at a p/bk of .63. Stated bk has increased every year since '99.

There's no ltd (per Yahoo).

The company has about $1.22/sh in cash + cash equivalents.

Current p/e under 8; p/sales is .5. Average p/sales ratio for each year since
'99 has been higher than .5.

With the current dividend rate of .48/sh, that's a 10% annualized dividend
yield on current stock price.

Yearly average roe and profit margins have come down from numbers in '99-'03.
ROE is now 8% ---not so good. Some of this maybe can be explained in that DSWL
has diversified into assembling electronic devices - a business where
competition abounds and margins are low. Also, there are several other factors:
From the July quarterly report,

"Mr. Franki Tse, chief executive officer, commented, “We are encouraged by the
sales increase we reported in the fourth quarter driven by strong sales in our
plastics division. That being said, our manufacturing costs are still being
impacted by crude oil price increases, RMB appreciation, resin cost increases,
labor/electricity rate increases, as well as the American economic situation
and inflation in China.”

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/080703/20080703005300.html?.v=1
===================
To me, DSWL seems like a well-capitalized, consistently profitable company,
selling at an attractive price point. Not a great business at an attractive
price --- more the okay/mediocre business at a cheap price. It's in a very
competitive sector, but for which I expect DSWL to get its share of customers.
Worth it to me have a position and to hold on to see if stock will improve.

DSWL - I'll comment on that to explain my investment thought processes.

DSWL falls into a black hole between two areas where I invest.

On one hand, there are high margin, high ROE companies, which DSWL was at one
time. It is not anymore.

On the other hand, I look for profitable companies selling below NCAV/cash.
DSWL does not fit into that either. They are selling below book, but most of
the book is capital equipment, which is always less attractive. There is also
an issue of inventories + AR being about 2x quarter sales. A bit high.

Finally, I am not sure I see bright future for DSWL in terms of what could go
right so it would become a better company in terms of sales, ROE, etc.

So I will skip.

1) DSWL continues to pay the current dividend. Business stays ho-hum (10% yield
is an Ok financial return)

2) Stock spikes up due to improved general sentiment and I'll get out. (most

3) Business improves and everything is great.

CX has more issues than the housing downturn and Venezuela. Below is an excerpt
from an WSJ article than outlines the complicated debt structure to their
takeover of Rinker.

Like other cement makers, Cemex faces an obvious problem: Demand for its
products is crumbling due to the housing crisis and a global economic slowdown.
This week brought the extra headache of Venezuela nationalizing the company's
small business there.

But investors should be more worried by the Mexican company's large, complex
and, some fear, overly engineered debt. This exposes shareholders to risks
associated with things like movements in the Japanese yen and changes in
Cemex's own share price.

Those aren't typical cement-company worries. That could lead its shares to fall
further and cause them to stay under pressure even when economic headwinds
subside.

Cemex's debt load largely springs from its $15.3 billion acquisition last
spring of Australia's Rinker, a construction-supply company. Cemex paid dearly
for the company -- which is focused on Florida, Nevada and Arizona -- just
before the housing market imploded.

Chief Financial Officer Rodrigo Trevi&#241;o counters that Rinker's operations
are cash-flow positive even in this dismal environment. The executive also
rebuffs talk of an overly complex financial structure, saying derivatives have
saved about $300 million in interest costs and bolstered short-term cash flow.

Still, Cemex is selling assets to pare down debt. And its success with
derivatives could quickly be reversed. In the second quarter, Cemex took a $159
million charge due to a change in yen-exchange rates. While Cemex doesn't do
much business in Japan, it links interest rates on some debt to the yen and
uses derivatives to protect against currency or interest-rate moves. Mr.
Trevi&#241;o says the trades are positive on a long-term basis. Yet the size of
Cemex's derivatives book -- it had about $16 billion in foreign-exchange and
interest-rate swaps -- makes it hard for investors to gauge overall risks
versus benefits.

A recent $500 million financing arrangement also underlines the complexity of
Cemex's finances. If, in three years, Cemex's stock is equal to or above
$32.92, the company won't face costs for the financing. Otherwise, the cost
could be as high as 11.2% in total. Its American depositary receipts rose 13
cents, or 0.6%, to $20.78, Wednesday in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.

The risk is offset because Cemex doesn't pay interest for three years, Mr.
Trevi&#241;o says.

Even gauging the company's debt is tricky. Cemex's stated net debt of $17.6
billion doesn't include about $4 billion in securities viewed as equity under
Mexican accounting rules and debt under U.S. standards.

In addition, low, fixed rates for the first two years of these securities give
way to floating rates afterward. Mr. Trevi&#241;o says Cemex can use
derivatives to continue locking in low rates, so it won't get caught by
interest-rate changes.

Perhaps, but the securities sound like an adjustable-rate mortgage. Investors
know how easy it was for borrowers to misjudge the risks associated with those
loans.

Cemex may well fare better. But investors have to ask whether a straightforward
business such as cement should be this complex.

Almost all of the financials I own or watch are down today.

Which enabled me to get a fill on a small entry amount of Irish bank, AIB.

As mentioned here, some analysts are predicting large AIB loan defaults in '09
as Irish economy slows and housing values there remain down or continue to
decline.

That's possibly already reflected in AIB's stock price. Stock is at about a
five year low.

Dividend yield - as of now - in future who knows? - looks like $2.54/24.20 =
about 10%. Latest (Aug. 6) div. was an increase from corresponding prior year's
dividend. Company has raised dividends every year since 1998 (except it was
kept constant 1999-2000).

Looking couple-three years out, it seems to me people are still going to want
the services banks provide, and AIB is positioned okay (it being part of a
duopoly) for the Irish market (with ancillary business in Poland and USA). P/bk
is now .77. (Has averaged over 2.0 every year in past ten.) Buying the stock
now, I would be expecting a reversion-to-mean by 2011. Meanwhile, dividend (if
it holds) is nice.

July 15 seems to have been capitulation day - many finance stock charts show

About: "AIB divvie looks to have been cut in future". It does look that way,
but that is not the correct view. Imo. Because AIB pays a dividend twice per
year and because the amounts are different, "somebody's" computer program that
a lot of companies apparently use, can't correctly annualize payments based on
one period's number, or can't correctly add both semi-annual distributions.

Therein lies a benefit to those who perceive the correct dividend. What is
skipped over when somebody scans for stocks - 7.96% yield (which is very good
albeit maybe just okay vs. other dividend-payers) - gets more focused on when
it turns out the dividend yield is closer to 10-11%, with a history of no-cuts.

I'll clarify my comment, "looks like $2.54/24.20 = about 10%",

Unfortunately I can't for certainty say what the true dividend amount is to USA
taxpayers from the data I see. There's a surprising difference among data
reporters. Perhaps some report the euro dividend in US $ as of ex-dividend day.
Perhaps somebody else reports the euro dividend when the euro is converted and
received on the dividend receipt date: latest dividend shows about six weeks
after ex-div day (8/6/'08) to scheduled receipt (9/26/'08). (Also to be
considered, there's likely some Irish withholding tax. (I've not checked that
yet.))

I can offer these numbers and before-tax yields:

From Yahoo. (Look at "historical prices" and check "dividends" box)

8/08: .953
2/08: 1.501
8/07: .761

So that's the source of my .953 + 1.501 = $2.45/sh. Sorry I transposed .45 in
my previous post. Still, the yield % remains as I said: 2.45/24.20 = 10%.
(before some Irish withholding tax, I presume)

Now if I look at S&P report for AIB, I get

8/08: .953
2/08: 1.609
8/07: .769

So based on S&P, the current annualized dividend yield is (.953+1.609)/24.20 =
2.562/24.20 = 10.6%. Maybe a tad higher if AIB's closing price of $23.97 is
used.

The stock dropped under $24 today. If I can buy the stock somewhere closer to
$23, I'll up my position. However I look at it, I'll be figuring - if the
dividend doesn't get cut, and if we're near a low for the stock - the dividend
yield before Irish withholding should be somewhere around 10.5% -11%. Pretty
good for a bank stock that still seemingly has a franchise.
Jmo, but I've been wrong many, many times.

AIB -the problem with AIB and IRE is that the Irish boom was partly build on
the RE boom which is now faltering. In fact in some respects Irish RE problems
are worse than the US since the whole economy has been driven much more by RE
than was the US.

I think the same is true for GB and Spain. Banks in those countries might (and
in some cases are already) seeing problems similar to US banks. Germany never
had a RE boom and in many areas (Berlin) prices have been depressed since the
early 90's. There is very little risk that German banks have problems because
of domestic RE borrowings , which of course does not mean that they manage to
avoid losses on foreign loans.

Bottom line is i would be very careful with Irish, British and Spanish banks.
We might see a few bank wipeouts in those countries.

Yes, possible AIB, other banks could crater because of real estate loans. My
limited understanding of the r.e. market in Ireland is that subprime is/was a
very small component of overall loans, and that Irish banks had somewhat
stringent(?) requirements (lower loan-to-capital ) which meant borrower has had
to put up more of a downpayment compared to what happened in later stages of
USA r.e. euphoria, i.e. 0% down. So some cushion there now for the Irish banks.
But of course we don't what will happen if such cushion is removed with further
housing/economic declines in Ireland.

==================
How does one "be careful with Irish, British and Spanish banks"? If one
can't/won't do the proper due diligence, then maybe one should stay away. How
can a person even do such due diligence? - difficulty in getting info. like
access to paperwork on all the key loans or businesses, understanding
legal/accounting differences, obtaining current knowledge of local
economic/legal issues. These difficulties remain another reason to stay away.

Maybe one can find a brokerage firm tracking these businesses and have some
faith in their analysts' determinations of value. Which firms, and who are the
trustworthy analysts? -- another problem.
=========================
My opinion is that yes, some of these banks may get wiped out. Some will come
out of this though, and their stocks will do well. Maybe they'll do well from
current levels. Maybe the market's too optimistic still, and the stocks will
come back all right, but only up from a level far below where they are now.
Those rewards to the winners --- that seems to attract me, so I want to be in.
But which stocks and how to be careful?

For me I will attempt to control risk by limiting position size and by
selecting a package of stocks. On the assumption my winners will win more than
my losers lose. And I'll control risk by limiting $ bets in any one, and also
limiting total $ invested in the sector.

For now, I'm just with http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AIB and

FWIW, DB is the primary seller of RE in the county where I live. According to
the Morningstar excerpt below, they still have a ways to go.

"Deutsche Bank reduced its remaining exposure to key risky assets to EUR 44.6
billion, from EUR 55.2 billion in the first quarter; more than half of its
remaining exposure is to leveraged loans, which have been marked down to about
91 cents on the dollar."

I was in East Berlin last summer. There is quite a transformation occurring
there. I didn't think prices were inexpensive, but that could have been

UBS Upgrades Brazil Steel Cos To Buy After Correction
8/26/2008
DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

SAO PAULO (Dow Jones)--UBS Pactual upgraded Brazilian steelmakers to buy after
a sharp decline in prices based on an overly pessimistic view, it said in a
report Tuesday.

"Our stress test indicates current prices imply steel prices as much as 35%
lower than current, which we view as unlikely due to scarcity of new steel
capacity and tight raw material supply," it said.

In the long term, UBS believes Brazilian steel stocks will continue to generate
strong cash flows backed by high steel prices.

UBS raised Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (SID), or CSN, and Usiminas
(USIM5.BR) to buy from neutral, while it reiterated its buy rating and industry
top pick status for Gerdau (GGB).

The Gerdau target price is 47.50 Brazilian reals ($29.14). The stock was down
0.5% at BRL28.65 in early trade.

The target price for CSN is BRL75.00. The stock was down 1.5% at BRL52.63 in
early trade.

Usiminas' target price is BRL83.33. The stock was down BRL54.50 at the start of
trade.

AIB - yes I owned it but sold it shortly thereafter. For me being careful means
that indeed i avoid bank stocks from the US, GB, IRE and Spain for now. My
strategy with bank stocks is to wait until RE bottom out and then buy the best
(or least worst) of he pack. That may not give me the best entry prices but I
think it will be a decent entry. Right now we are nowhere near the bottoming
point in all those countries.

Psyching Yourself Up to Let Losers Go
Selling Can Hurt; Here Are Some Ways To Ease the Pain
Jason Zweig / WSJ August 23, 2008; Page B1

[A rather timely column from the Wall St Journal. - A]

When you buy and hold, you don't have to use a death grip.

Of course, you never should sell a stock or fund purely because its price has
gone down. If your original reasons for buying turn out to be wrong, however,
you should consider selling.

Yet letting go is much easier said than done. Sell a stock or fund at a loss
and your pride goes with it, trailing in its wake a stream of regrets about
what might have been.

If you've ever found it difficult to let go of a lousy investment, WSJ's
personal finance columnist Jason Zweig has some tips for you. He tells Cybele
Weisser why it's hard to part ways and what you can do to break that
attachment. (Aug. 23)

Individual and professional investors alike struggle with selling. Berkeley
finance professor Terrance Odean has found that investors are at least 50% more
likely to sell their winners than their losers. Among the money managers
surveyed by Cabot Research, a Boston consulting firm, fewer than 30% base their
sell decisions on "extensive research." The rest concede they basically sell by
the seat of their pants.

All too often, investors are prisoners of the past. Did you buy General Motors
last year at 42? Dump it now, around 10, and you abandon all hope that it will
recover its former glory. Hold on, however, and you can tell yourself that you
weren't wrong; you just haven't yet been proved right.

The longer you've owned a stock and the more you've lost on it, the harder it
can be to sell. "Once you start thinking about how much pain a stock has caused
you," says Columbia University psychologist Eric Johnson, "that emotion blocks
you from thinking about the advantages you could get from selling." You may
think you own a stock, but the stock may own you.

Then there's the haunting belief that your portfolio is ruled by a version of
Murphy's Law: Whatever can go up will go up, but only after you sell it.
Cornell University psychologist Thomas Gilovich explains, "People tell
themselves, 'If I sell, and it goes up, I know I'll kick myself,' because it's
so easy to imagine having hung on to it instead." Over the years, I've heard
dozens of fund managers say they made a stock go up just by selling it.

Fortunately, there are techniques that can take some of the emotion out of
selling at a loss.

Use stop-look orders. I am not a fan of stop-loss orders, which automatically
sell you out of a stock when it drops below a preset limit -- and tend to fill
both your portfolio, and your broker's pocket, with cash. But I do believe in
what I call "stop look" orders: Whenever a stock drops, say, 25% below what you
paid, automatically review your original top three reasons for buying to see
whether they are still valid. That will prevent you from selling without
thinking first.

Don't go far afield. Minimize your risk of future regret by replacing what you
sell with something similar. If, for instance, you want to unload Beazer Homes
because you underestimated how risky its inventory was, you could move the
proceeds into SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF or iShares Dow Jones U.S. Home
Construction Index Fund.

Shop before you drop. Ask yourself: Which stock or fund would I most like to
own? Then view your losers as a source of funding to reduce the amount of cash
you would otherwise need to raise. "Thinking about possibilities instead of
pain," says Prof. Johnson of Columbia, "will make selling a lot easier."
(Remember, too, that once you sell, you can deduct up to $3,000 of your losses
from your taxable income.)

Get over it. Robin Hogarth, a management professor at Pompeu Fabra University
in Barcelona, advises changing the log-on for your brokerage account to
something like "dumpmylosers." Repeatedly typing such a phrase will soften your
resistance to selling.

Reprice it. Let's say you bought Citigroup three years ago for 43.50. Divide
your original purchase price by 10. Imagining that you paid 4.35 should help
you see today's price (around 17) in a new light. If you can't justify why
Citigroup is still cheap after quadrupling from what you "paid" for it, you
should sell.

Follow your sales. Using an online portfolio tracker, monitor the returns of
all the stocks you sell after you sell them. Studying the aftermath of your
mistakes will enable you to learn which you sold too soon and which too late.
You cannot improve what you do not measure.

I dont understand much of this article. divide the price of what you paid for
the stock by 10. look at your big profit and decide if you still want to hold
on to it? give me a break. Similarly dont understand why you would switch from
owning a homebuilder to a homebuilder index. Only thing I can understand is
either bailing out automatically when something drops a certain amount or
reasessing at this point.

Yeah, those reasons/methods for selling seem odd to me too -- divide the stock
by 10 to make a sell decision or to make a sale palatable? And to overcome
reluctance to sell a homebuilder by making a buy of a homebuilder etf
concomitantly with the sale of the stock? That's weak.

For me, columnist Zweig could've just left it at: "Of course, you never should
sell a stock or fund purely because its price has gone down. If your original
reasons for buying turn out to be wrong, however, you should consider selling".
But then of course, if he stopped there he wouldn't have a column -gg-.
==================
So many, many stocks I have bought have declined in price after I bought them
and then have gone on to rally and become big percentage gainers for me. So I
often incorporate this - my perceived experience - in my buys - buying small
starter positions, expecting the stock to fall, maybe adding more to the
position on no adverse news (i.e. Zweig's "original reasons for buying" are
still valid). So for me, I don't want to facilitate or encourage my selling by
having something like a login with the title "dumpmylosers" as some "management
consultant" suggested in the article.

And I'm not with this other person either: "...View your losers as a source of
funding to reduce the amount of cash you would otherwise need to raise." So now
you have to be right in two ways -- right in your sale of the downtrodden stock
and right in your choice of the redeployed monies.

"Thinking about possibilities instead of pain," says Prof. Johnson of Columbia,
"will make selling a lot easier."

This is a value board - it's not a growth board where we routinely see or
expect increased quarter over quarter sales, increasing earnings, analysts
giving favorable reviews, forum stockholders applauding themselves for being in
the stock and why are they and you not buying even more because prospects seem
good, and because past/current results have been so good too. No, this is a
value board: We buy companies and stocks that have problems- sometimes serious
enough or so disheartenly intractable enough to seemingly jeopardize the
existence of the company itself - or at least keep the stock price down "for
eons". We are the owners of out-of-favor or obscure companies/stocks that
aren't fun to talk about at parties. It certainly doesn't help that we buy
stocks when they're down or on their way to falling even further. Unlike growth
investors who buy and then see their stock rise after its bought, it's we who
often see our stocks decline after we buy them. Not only are some of our stocks
depressed, but some of us can ourselves get depressed too just owning the
things -g-. So as regards the professor's attempt to help alleviate or avoid
investors' pain, that's almost misguided: We value investors get paid to take
pain. It's part of the deal.

hey paul I like profitable positive ops cash flow stocks under tangible book
stocks with good management, SNS is all of those only not as profitable a I
would like.

DDS I have mentioned here before as a 3X ops cash flow business trading at 33%
of book (Mostly Dillards Store locations as 80% are owned by the company) so in
asset value terms we have $2,400,000,000 of Equity and a market cap of
$880,000,000..... very very cheap stock

That's my take on these.... SNS is more a call on Biglari's capital allocation
skills, but I would rather invest with a deep value manager managing a company
below NAV than about anything else because if he is as good as I think he is it
is like buying Berkshire Hathaway, Markel, Danaher, etc... but at just 5X
operating cash flows, plus I think the franchise is pretty tasty.

HAST is my favorite place to shop (really the only place) and I love the
stores. Trading at 69% of forward book value and 7X earnings this is the best
US below book value EPS and cash flow cheapie out there....

I bought some DSWL, but I think Hastings has a better business model, higher
ROE, more cash flow and its US regulated.... have lost money before in foreign
stocks...

One other foreign value stock I am looking closely at is BHO
its a liberian company so caveat emptor but I like the numbers and management
owns a big chunk (its private but on a stock exchange....?)

Actually, the rotation within a sector ("overcome reluctance to sell a
homebuilder by making a buy of a homebuilder etf") makes a lot of sense. It is
always possible and sometimes very good idea to sell one company in sector and
buy another one. First, you can write off your tax losses, second, you can
switch from weaker to stronger competitors perhaps at positive price
differential.

And I'm not with this other person either: "...View your losers as a source of
funding to reduce the amount of cash you would otherwise need to raise." So now
you have to be right in two ways -- right in your sale of the downtrodden stock
and right in your choice of the redeployed monies.

I hear what you are saying, but he is right too. If there is a company which
prospects are unclear like ASFI or ACAS nowadays, you can hold it assuming the
prospects will improve. But if other better prospects appear, then it's
worthwhile to sell such stock even if it's way down.

No, this is a value board: We buy companies and stocks that have problems

Actually, ummm, no. :) The best buys for me were the companies that did not
have problems and yet were trading at value prices. GSIT at NCAV or cash when
they explicitly told everyone that they will report record earnings. That's the
greatest value buy there can be. Sure, such opportunities are very rare, but I
think I would make more money just taking them than going into a lot of
"problems- sometimes serious enough or so disheartenly intractable enough"
companies. I think this is a huge value investing fallacy: buying companies
with problems thinking that you know better than others. And then watching them
collapse much more. Sure, I do it too, but it's much better when you don't.
Most of the time. :)

DDS, SNS and HAST - the drawback of retailers below book value is that it's
unclear how much are the assets really worth. Sure, buildings/locations can be
worth more than they are listed on balance sheet, but the inventory/furnishings
could be worth much less. And even some buildings may be worth less than the
price used on balance sheet. It might be possible to calculate what DDS is
gaining on store closures, but right now it seems to be less than 2.5M per
store net of impairments. Not much. :(

I am also not very happy when these companies (DDS and HAST) are buying back
shares and taking on more debt while their balance sheets are not very great.
Sure, buying back shares below book is great investment if the company will
survive. Kmart example though shows that weakening a balance sheet in weak
retail environment is risky.

Out of these 3, SNS is interesting due to Biglari, HAST is interesting since it
is profitable. I'll think about them.

About the Zweig article.

Selling one downtrodden stock in a sector and then buying another stock in the
sector presumably with better prospects is different imo from what Zweig
suggested. His comment is what I was referring to when I said, "sell(ing) a
homebuilder by making a buy of a homebuilder etf...is weak".

"...if other better prospects appear, then it's worthwhile to sell such stock
even if it's way down." For me, I find that since I am almost always in the
market looking, I am almost always finding something with better prospects than
something I already have. So, if I have a stock like ACAS that's way down, but
has intact the reason for my buying it in the first place, then I will not sell
to buy something else that shows the appearance of better prospects. To do so
would be chaos - hopping and hoping from one stock to another. Now if I have a
stock that's in some nether region - up from where I may have bought it, where
I'm not willing to add to it, where it's not yet fairly valued though - I might
peel off shares.

I am looking to increase my portfolio value and looking too to minimize risk.
If "best buys" are rare opportunities like a "no problem" company like GSIT, to
capitalize on making "best buys" like GSIT a cornerstone of my strategy, I'd
have to take a relatively huge position in such a company when the opportunity
presented itself. That is too risky for me.

"I think this is a huge value investing fallacy: buying companies with problems
thinking that you know better than others." I don't see it as knowing better
than the market. I see it as about willingness to have patience in buying and
holding the problem company. It's this way for me: I am buying now for
2010-2011. Auto-related, banks, financials, defense -- I can position my
portfolios in these. And while they have problems now (and so others will avoid
these) - and where the stocks look punk (where people see 'dead money'), I will
buy to hold where others will not.

"sell(ing) a homebuilder by making a buy of a homebuilder etf...is weak" - I
still think this is worthwhile sometimes. I have done this with both
homebuilders and financials. Reasoning would be that you want to diversify
within the sector instead of having a company risk.

Better prospects - OK, sometimes I do what you do and hold and sometimes I
trade into the new idea. I would agree that usually I trade into a new idea if
the old one's story has deteriorated (like I think is the case with ACAS). So
for me there are strong-holds (hold and buy more if it drops) and weak-holds
(hold and perhaps sell if better opportunities appear). Someone may argue that
I should sell weak-holds immediately, but I don't do it for all weak-holds.

OK, I know your attitude against large concentrated positions. I disagree. :)
It is very tough to have discipline for concentrated infrequent sure bets
though. Means holding a lot of cash for a lot of time.

"I think this is a huge value investing fallacy: buying companies with problems
thinking that you know better than others." I don't see it as knowing better
than the market. 

I think you still assume that you know better than the market that autos will
not go BK (which I disagree, I think that autos may go BK nicely), banks will
not go BK (this one is very tough to decide, but perhaps Buffett banks are
safe). I would agree on defense, since most companies there are just cyclical
and well capitalized, so yeah it's a waiting game there.

I think it is very much dependent on what kind of problems we are talking
about. Is it "new Coke" kind of a problem or is it Indymac kind of a problem.
You assume that your holdings have "new Coke" kind of problems, while market
may be assuming Indymac. You have to be more right than wrong against the
market. ;) (Note, that I have a bunch of troubled holdings too, so I am not
really following the "buy only companies with no trouble at value prices"
discipline either :)).

-------------------------------
Here are some musings not necessarily related to above.

I guess the cornerstone of value investing is saying that there is some kind of
assurance like book value, business moat, margins, ROE, clean balance sheet or
something else that makes it highly likely that it's not an Indymac kind of a
problem. Then investing into a company with a problem may be worthwhile and
just a waiting game.

On the other hand, CROX is a great example of a stock that could have been
bought and held down from $40 (if not higher) with all kind of great value
assurances and assumptions of knowing better than the market. Great ROE, great
margins, clean balance sheet, book value, possibly patent-protected moat, etc.
Still not clear whether it's worth anything. :/

Maybe CROX is an exception though. :)

"I think you still assume that you know better than the market that autos will

I'll specify my "auto-related" comment:

I'm out of all auto manufacturers.

My thesis is that USA people will likely hold on to cars much longer before
trading in or up; there's still a world-wide demand for cars; people in USA
will still be buying cars. If a couple of car manufacturers go bankrupt, the
remaining will take up their business.

Whose ever brand people buy, there will be manufacturers of the components. So
I have, as mentioned before, beatdown LEA, ALV, ETN. (Buying more - small - as
stocks drop)

I have a little PRTS - "U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc. operates as an online
retailer of aftermarket auto parts and accessories" - which fits my book value
model.

Cars will still be bought at dealerships. And plenty of people will want the
assurance of the factory/dealership "guarantee" which dealerships can provide
for their later model used cars. My package of dealership stocks is GPI SAH LAD
PAG AN ABG. (It's been said that auto dealerships make their biggest profits on
parts/service and used cars - not new cars.)

Holding NICK, ACF which specialize in auto loans.

Also holding stocks in commercial/military vehicle manufacturers (e.g. OSK) and
parts makers for them.

However, here are the "problems".

First, the company is fairly valued for current growth and ROE. You may think
differently, but for me it's not a value buy.

Second, I have previously invested in Cap Eq stocks in various sectors and if
downturn occurs (which I don't predict for oil, but IF ;)) "backlog" disappears
faster than you can say "$60 dollar oil" :P. And company is left with a bunch
of iron on their hands that they can't do crap about. ;) Look at something like

Isn't the same problem encountered in any sector? Downturns, new technology,
etc?

Good question. My answer would be "partially".

Old Buffett stocks (as compared to new Buffett stocks ;)) were usually in
sectors and positions where there was no downturns and no new technology. Coke,
Pepsi, maybe chocolate were such beasts and perhaps still are somewhat. Still
there are very few such companies and you could argue that even KO and PEP now
have the commodity cost issue + new competition from non-carbonated drinks.

Another view would be that Cap Equip sectors are notoriously cyclical,
sometimes much more than non Cap Equip sectors. Again, this time it may be
different for oil Cap Equips, but in general it was mostly better to buy the
widget makers and not the widget maker makers. ;) Although there are some
exceptions. ;)

Third view would be to acknowledge that almost every company (except for KO and
PEP maybe) faces downturns and new technology or what we can call "problems".
And then we are back to my discussion with Paul: can you and me and Paul figure
out when the "problem" is temporary with no (or little) permanent destruction
of shareholder value ("new Coke") and when the problem may lead to big and
permanent destruction of invested capital. The first kind of problems are
really opportunities, the second kind are not.

There is also a question of timing, mentioned in passing by Paul. If the
"problem" or down cycle lasts 1 year, then the possible return is higher than
when the down cycle lasts 3 or 5 years. So even if the problem is a "new Coke"
some of the investors run away, since it is possible that the recovery will
take too long. Unfortunately if we as value investors don't know how long the
down cycle will last, we can suffer from subpar returns even if we correctly
identify that the problem is not really terminal to the company.

Tough job? ;)

Investors have to anticipate how long they will be willing to hold a stock if
it becomes a non-performer after their buy.

My preference is to go with a general, generic number. It's too hard for me to
figure when a stock of a company with problems might recover.

Sometimes it's easy or easier to hold a stock when quarterly reports give
indication of progress. At least the business is improving even if there's
frustration the improvement is not reflected yet in the stock price.

I believe (my memory could be wrong) that Dr. Graham said if you didn't see
improvement in the stock (or the business and stock) (like net-net stocks) in
two years, then sell and move on.

If there's no indication of progress from the company, the holding period I try
for is three years. (And so as I say, I'm buying now for 2010-2011). If I'm
looking for a full large-scale organizational change (mergers/total new
management team), I don't expect such a change to be complete for seven years
(based on my study of lsoc literature back in the 'mid 1990's.)

It's easier for me to hold "dead money" stocks than it is for most people.
First, my positions are broad, so I'm not hit in the face every day with a
non-performing dullard that I would be if I only held 15-30 positions. Secondly
I don't mind a few or bunch of stocks that go nowhere for a while -- it beats
stocks that keep declining. And in this market, at least do-nothing stocks
don't add to emotionalism brought by volatility. Thirdly, my goals perhaps are
not as lofty as some. OTOH, some of these stocks - when the businesses have
turned around - have become multibaggers, well worth having been tucked away
for a couple/three years.

Jmo and what I do or try to do.

Looking for website.

Quicken/Intuit decided to revamp their stock evaluator website. This is the new
version http://investing.quicken.com/research/evaluator.asp?symbol=nov

The old version had a window with 10 year ROE/ROIC/ROA numbers as text + some
graphs. The new version only has graph that does not even show the numbers,
which makes it very hard to read.

SI financials http://si.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&symbol=NOV have only 5
year data in a graph. They provide numbers, but the numbers cannot be
cut/pasted.

So I am looking for a website that still provides a table of 10 year
ROE/ROIC/ROA numbers as text that can be cut/pasted.

Anyone know such a beast?

"at some point i wil have to take a tax loss in aib i guess; what should i
switch to?". That'd be a question for the board, so let's see some replies.

Mine:
If I am to assume you want a replacement bank stock for AIB for your income
portfolio, I've no good suggestions regarding good-yielding bank stocks. I got
scared out of BAC at lows - so missed that run up. Others I see have moved up
too. Have bought BBV recently and am adding to it if it drops. BBV pays a
decent dividend. (Of course, the Spanish company/Spanish economy has its
problems as cautioned by Speculatius.)

Moving from banks to insurers, I'll add to my UTR position if stock will drop
again. (Note current div. yield, other positives mentioned here previously)

Couple of articles to peruse, maybe relevant, maybe not:

turmoil these companies have seen ---price changes, and dividend reductions---

ytd in my retirement portfolio -17.8%. not so good, as metals and energy have
really taken it on the chin of late. This has been a year of unusual volatility
even by my standards. Picked a lot of 2008 losers and few winners at the
moment. If I were running a hedgefund it would be liquidated. fortunately Im
not and can wait it out. Im sure there are areas in the market that have done
well this quarter I just dont think I have holdings in any of them. I am very
hopeful that over the next 18 months my portfolio will rebound nicely. The
canadian jr market has just been obliterated, and on top of that the canadian
dollar went from a peak of $1.10 to $94. this weakness is amazing to me
considering that canadian government has been running at a surplus. I wonder
how many margin players are just toast now.

Madharry, you're right. The solutions the author, Jason Zweig
offered, for getting around the emotional difficulty of hanging
onto a loser, are pretty nutty. I'm still puzzling over the divide
by 10 thing too. That was just plain weird. Then telling the
investor to repeatedly type 'dumpmylosers' in order to
psychologically motivate themselves to sell - is a sure sign to
me that person shouldn't even be involved in buying individual
stocks.

While I'm sorry I posted such a poor article, I'm not above still
learning, and I'm thankful for the discussion it triggered.

Jurgis Bekepuris, et. al.: Here's something that could help us: A new feature
at GuruFocus that gives ten year history. See if it meets some of your
requirements.

numbers as text that can be cut/pasted."

(I'm just using AIB because it was mentioned in prior post. I see I can get
stock info (they don't cover every stock though) by replacing the "aib" in the
above http link with a different stock symbol. Or at the website, at top of
page, where it says SYMBC, replacing that with the appropriate stock symbol.

I would not bet for huge growth, but the company is still trading at 1.3 book

Sold my entire lot of HD as it has run too far too fast. Lots of $27.5 Sept
Puts traded today. It looks like some are betting big on a pull back for HD. I
may reestablish a small position on a check back below $27.

Bought back the INTC sold 31 days ago. I now have a much lower cost basis and I
like the current prospects for global productivity improvement w/ PC and smart
phones which all use INTC chips.

Peeled off a few shares of VVUS my long term speculative bio tech. Bought
original position around $2.30 in 2005. Not really a value play but they have
avoided burning cash while developing new products. They have issued new stock
from time to time to finance their operation. Time to take my seed money off
the table.

Some pretty good moves in my basket of REITs. Hopefully we have seen the bottom
in this group. My favorites include BDN, FR and HRP
(http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BDN,HRP,FR&d=s ).

I would like to see a climax sell off in both the oil and commodity sectors so
I can average some new long term money into new positions. When you hear about
hedge funds throwing in the towel with forced liquidations is music to my ears.
Do you have any favorites in this sector that have made your watch list?

EKS. I'm a little shell-shocked with all my positions in the oil sector.

I added substantially (for me) to CVX yesterday. If CVX will drop further I
want to continue to add aggressively to pump up my shares to a full position
(But, otoh, I may scare myself from doing this-- these oil stocks are so
volatile and the press is so negative about where oil prices are going.)

I added to TLM today. It's a one-stop for several oil shale plays - New
Brunswick, Fayetteville, Montney.

IF oil will stay above say $85-$90 barrel, and IF Lula (Brazilian President)
doesn't choke Petrobras with onerous tax laws-- or worse, confiscation - 'we
want our fair share' stuff -- then imo, if anybody wants an oil stock to buy
for 2 year or more holding, and if the person doesn't already own Petrobras,
then NOW would be the time to begin accumulating this stock.

All jmo, and I have been wrong many, many times. Especially recently.
