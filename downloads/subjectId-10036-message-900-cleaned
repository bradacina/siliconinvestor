James - OK, I've been sidelined long enough on this bantering about MSFT and
INTC. Mike and I are both value investors but we use different approaches.
You've heard his argument against MSFT and INTC as value plays, here is mine:

1. Nobody can question that both companies are market leaders in rapidly
growing industries and that managements are excellent.
2. Based upon Fisher's SUPER STOCK book which includes about 30 years of
historical research to support his conclusions, the high PSR values of MSFT and
INTC are probably not maintainable. Reasonable PSRs for companies of that size
are 2-4 and their PSRs are 2x to 3x these numbers. Based upon his value
approach, these stocks are very overvalued. And if history repeats itself when
the next bear market or major correction does hit, these stocks will tumble and
never again achieve their lofty valuations.
3. You can make some very good arguments that they are both good stocks to own
but I don't think you can make a case using a value approach. My livlihood is
built around computers and I use a lot of their products but I wouldn't own
either of them at these valuations. :-)

I hate to help you make money on your value evaluation program for
$10,000/seat. But, here it is. Your value evaluation is incorrect because you
leave out, the standard on bond yields as a comparison, which standard all
analysts use. The P/E of 15 as a value, for current economy, is to compete with
bond yields. Stock market has to compete for cash investments against bond
market. When cash bond (not 30 year futures) yield goes up, the P/E value has
to go down, also. The value play, therefore changes all the time, but can be
calculated all the time, also.

Since you ask about other views about SGI. Here it is.

TA analysis of trending and breakout expectation, should be included. Also, the
short interest published to establish overbought condition, which takes time to
recover. The time of 3 years, can be estimated by the decrease in short
interest in shares each month divided by daily volume traded times an emperical
constant. Granted sometimes the daily 1 minute interval intraday charts may
show you, that overbought condition got worse. Value investors still need TA or

WHX is indeed interesting, though not a net-net by Graham's more rigorous
definition. (He said take out ALL the long term liabilities, not just long term
debt. But the relaxed approach is fine in today's market. Just recognize there
is a big ol' pension liability there - all old steels have one)

The strike doesn't look like it will end anytime soon. The two sides hate each
other. But with over $400 million cash, the Company can hold out for a long
long time.

Also interesting is that they just finished a big modernization of all its
plants. I noticed today that a coke facility just sold for over $200 million,
so there is some liquidation value there (not counted of course in the net-net
calculation).

I agree with Mike. With the stoc at $6 1/2, if you're willing to wait a while
there are two possibilities I see. First, the strike could be settled, and the
stock goes to $12 or so. Or things could get worse and management chooses to
liquidate. That should be at least $10 to shareholders. Either way you win.

I take this one over Microsoft any day. (don't tell my wife that)

Reginald,

Actually, I'd rather move on than go over it tick by tick. One of my degrees is
economics and I do understand what you are talking about, and I agree it is
logical, and may indeed be viable over the long term. I just don't see the
Margin of Safety built into the prices of those stocks you selected to
demonstrate your model. Not that I think this is wrong by any means-- I'm
certainly not one to say this or that approach is wrong.

As you say, I agree that "high-ranking" investors lurk here, since I get e-mail
from them every so often. However, I don't get the feeling that their positions
necessarily mean they are any more sophisticated than Jeff, Paul, Scott, and
several others on this thread. Admittedly, I'm a hack, but whether someone is
willing to lay out $10,000 for a software program that tells them a stock is
overvalued or not certainly doesn't validate the program for me.

Good luck.

< Your value evaluation is incorrect because you leave out, the standard on

This is not true. Sell side analysts may use this figure as a standalone
comparison, but not necessarily the buy side (and Buffet & Co. are buyside
people). In addition, the bond yield is incorporated in both the cost of debt
capital calulculation (the yield that the market actually prices the corporate
debt plus an adjustment for cash) and the cost of equity capital (deleveraged
beta plus the 10 year risk free rate). Henceforth you are incorrect in your
assertions. Look at the cost of capital calculator. I suggest you go through
the model slowly and inquire about the portions you do not completely
understand. To all, the larger model is a very, very advanced tool - actually
more advanced than many currently used on the Street (I have looked and
compared, I am just shy of walking distance from the Wall Street).

<When cash bond (not 30 year futures) yield goes up, the P/E value has to go
down, also. The value play, therefore changes all the time, but can be
calculated all the time, also.>

P/E does not necessarily go down when bond yields go up. You are quoting theory
and not necessarily historical fact. MSFT is a perfect example, hasn't MSFT's
P/E risen along with bond yields. Remember that theory is only just theory
unitl it is consistently proven to be fact.

My model ignores standard accounting earnings, therefore P/E as you are using
is meaningless in the context of my model.

The model calculates value in real time, therefore the actual values change on
a tick by tcik basis (real time), contingent opon projections, risk free rated,
money rates, dividend yields, beta, stock prices, etc.

Where do you get P/E of 12 from? What is the relevance. The choice of
investment is implicit in the valuation process. Do you not understand what I
said in my previous post regarding the inclusion of the risk free rate in
equity valuation? Once the equity is valued, then you compare to other asset

We are I believe talking about Value for investment. Junk bonds have high
yields if you actually ever get paid. Stock P/E ratios do not give you
dividends; unless dividends are announced. But, treasury bonds may yield 6.8%
very safe. P/E ratio of 12 yields 8.05% if dividends are paid. P/E ratios may
change quarter to quarter. So, value investing has to compare treasury bond
yields to stock P/E ratio and risks.

PSR, IMO, is successful more because it is corrollary (if that is the right

the accurate barometer that many think it is. That is not bad, as long as that
correlation does not change. If it does, than you are bound for surprises.
Things are likely to change as the industry paradigm shifts into its next mode
(ex. the debunking of the classical economic theory of dimishing returns).

<We are I believe talking about Value for investment. Junk bonds have high
yields if you actually ever get paid. >

Mr. Tang, i have a strong feeling that you are not in the financial industry.
You seem to be harboring some highly misleading concepts regarding money and
value. Value does not mean "cheap," nor devoid of risk. It is the ratio of risk
and return as compared to the price you pay for that ratio. Therefore, junk
bonds have historically been a more valuable investment than US treasuries and
AAA corporate bonds, for even after being adjusted for risk, they still
ouperformed the higher rated debt. That is how Michael Milken made so much
money in junk bonds (initially, at least).

<Stock P/E ratios do not give you dividends; unless dividends are announced.
But, treasury bonds may yield 6.8% very safe>

The majority of wealth in the fast paced equity markets such as technology (in
terms of total returns) are to be had in the non-dividend paying companies for
they tend to reinvest cash more efficiently than shareholders. Treasury bond
yields at 6.8% are very dangerous, not very safe. Let's assume you are a middle
income worker making $75,000 per year in a 34% tax bracket with inflation at
4.8%. You invest $100,000 in a 1 year T-bill at 6.8% You will be guaranteed a
profit of 6.8%*$100,000=$6,800 (interest) less inlation @4.8%=$2,000 less taxes
@ 34% of interest income ($2,312) = negative $312 dollars. Now, according to
the technical defintition, this is only slightly risky, for even though you do
not know what inflation will be for the next year, you do know the other
factors (barring tax legilsation at mid-year). The problem with that slight
risk is that it is SIGNIFICANT. Notive that you actually took a loss on your
money. Would you consider this a "deveiation from your expected return"?

T-bonds are not "very safe" investments for they cannot track the pace of
inflation and often do not offer a "real" yeiled that compensate for the
inherent risks of investment such as legislative risk and inflation. You are
only characterizing market risk which is but a piece of the pie.

<P/E ratio of 12 yields 8.05% if dividends are paid.>

This means practically nothing. Let us assume that you are correct and a stock
at a P/E of 12 yeilds 8.5%. The stock costs $10, but it was formerly a stock
with a P/E of 24 but dropped in price by 50% (from $20). So you know have a
yield of 8.5% of $10 (85 cents) and a capital loss of ten dollars. How do you
compare this to a bond whose risk is measured in convexity and duration without
doing the same? When you measure assets from different classes, you use a
discounted cash flow analysis, not a P/E - yield model, or else you will be
comparing apples and oranges in reagrds to both risk and return.

PS
It is possible to measure the duration of cash flows for equitites, but that is
much to complicated and especially time consuming for the average investor.

Reginald,

You appear to be arguing that junk bonds and technology equity
investments have more value because they have been yielding higher returns over
the last 7-10 years, thus counterbalancing the risk
to a sufficient degree to call these value plays. This is the logic of a growth
investor. What if you buy junk bonds just before the next crisis? Or if you buy
A junk bond and the company deteriorates or is cannibalized by the people that
sold it to you? You'll be sitting on a big fat capital loss. This risk is high,
hence the name.

How about the Nifty Fifty and the 72-74 crash? Good companies that
didn't see a return to their previous levels for over 10 years.
In the inflationary environment of the mid 70's to early 80's this
was devastating for holders of these growth stocks (which had
been deemed "safe" due to their previous returns during the 60's bull and
size/history).

This is why we use AAA corporate bonds and gov't securities as benchmarks for a
safe return. Hold until maturity and you
are guaranteed (as best as can be expected -- if you don't trust
the gov't, check out AAA bonds oneself) at least a modicrum of insurance
against inflation. I am not arguing that your model
doesn't do this implicitly.

In sum, if you buy at the top, where's the value? This is what Margin of Safety
is meant to address, and why many people distinguish value investing from
growth investing.

Mike

P.S. Diminishing returns have been debunked because of industry
paradigm shifts? That's not what UCLA taught me about paradigm
shifts and economics. Milken made his money by investing in junk bonds? My
understanding is he structured and sold them fraudulently and ruthlessly. Even
initially, his expertise was structuring, not investing in them.

No, when I say historically, I mean over the last 50 to 100 years. 7 to 10
years is not a sufficient sampling to make an accurate determination. The
amount of the yield is not the measure, it is the risk adjusted return as
compared to the price paid to achieve that risk adjusted return. Please
remember that formula as I have stated it, I feel that I will be returning
there soon. As for your junk bond scenarios, they do not mesh with historical
reality. There is lot of academic study regarding the value of high yield debt
as compared to that of AAA corp. and govt., high yield has been historically
underpriced. You MUST bother to research the financial facts BEFORE you make
assertions that will guide you to erroneous decision making in regards to
investing.

<This risk is high, hence the name. >

No, the name is a marketing moniker used to make an impression by the bond
salesman when these vehicles started to become popular. Again, the facts.

<In the inflationary environment of the mid 70's to early 80's this was
devastating for holders of these growth stocks (which had been deemed "safe"
due to their previous returns during the 60's bull and size/history)>

Not to offend you, so don't take this personally, but that is an amateurs
argument. Equity analysis deals with forward looking projections, hence anyone
who deemed an investment safe due to historical performance was simply not a
learned financial professional.

<This is why we use AAA corporate bonds and gov't securities as benchmarks for

expected -- if you don't trust the gov't, check out AAA bonds oneself) at least

This is absolutely false and you should try to avoid that train of thought
until you look into it a little further. Reference my previous post which
illustrates a guaranteed loss from investing in a US government debt security.
It is very important that investors know how to price financial assets, and it
is the inability to price that causes losses and underperformance (ex.
irrational exuberance), to a much greater extent than market risk. False
assumptions such as the one I just excerpted are preyed upon by astute
institutional investors for profit.

<In sum, if you buy at the top, where's the value?>

The point is that you have to know where the top is. Many on this thead do not
understand concepts of risk and financial asset valuation. Remember, I do not
intend to offend anyone, but I do want to make my point clear. Many of my
colleagues have advanced degrees in financial engineering, economics, etc and
have spent 10 to 20 years designing, underwriting and marketing securites and
consulting services from straight debt and equity to highly structured binary
knock-in embedded swaps and swaptions . They are very ruthless (well, alot of
them are anyway), highly educated and practiced in thier profession. Assuming
this is true, do you think that a lay person with a full time job can read a
book or two and post on a discussion group in order to somehow defeat these
guys in the competition for capital. It just isn't that easy. Yet many smalll
investors are convinced they can do it without learning the rules first.
Imagine if I were to read a book about a great old surgeon and attend a few
seminars, then commence to operate (open heart surgery) on fragile patients.
Potentially devastating results? Finance is a science, just like biology or
electrical engineering.

<Diminishing returns have been debunked because of industry

shifts and economics. >

Well he should have. According to your professor, MSFT can only make but so
much money selling Windows, for after a certain level, the returns diminish per
unit item sold. This is not true. MSFT can post Windows on its web site and
sell the 10 millionth copy at the same cost and for a larger return than it
sold the first copy (copy 100,001 would have recouped all R&D costs, yet
.distribution and marketing RELATIVE costs would be reduce due to economies of
scale . This is an interesting topic and is well worth investigating.

< Milken made his money by investing in junk bonds? My understanding is he

Milken made a FORTUNE investing in junk bonds. years later, even his
lieutenenants made a fortune by investing in junk bonds. This is another topic
you should investigate, it is quite interesting. The reason Milken and Leon
Black made so much money is the same topic that i have been ranting about for
the last few posts. Too many investors do not know how to value securitires or
risk, hence they leave themselves open to get virtualy robbed. He bought them
very cheap since no one knew waht thery were worth (they just called them junk
- sound familiar?) and used the bond covenants embedded in them to use the debt
in a very equity like fashion.

<My understanding is he structured and sold them fraudulently and ruthlessly.

You really shoud read up on Milken. not through authors that would benefit from
his downfall either, for that would be a VERY biased accoutning. Milken is

are overvalued sometimes and undervalued sometimes.

I'm an institutional buy-side analyst and we own LTUS for our clients.
Statistically, it seems inexpensive vs. its growth. The price (and valuation)
has suffered because the results of its nearest competitor, Fresh Choice

managed, and in markets where both companies have competing restaurants, LTUS
has the better operation. In fact, as SALD retrenches due to poor results
(losing money), that opens up things for LTUS. LTUS can buy sites that SALD is
leaving, for example. LTUS is on a September FY, and 1st call consensus
estimates are $.87 and $1.03 for FY 97 and 98. If you look at price vs. ebitda,

Hi Reginald, since my email to you is still stuck in MSN, I decided to post my

I just went through Part I of your "Professional Investment Evaluation Series"

finance and economics, so please bear with me if I sounded naive:

Q1: On the 2nd "income statement" of company X (pg 9), the stated revenue is
129. You explained this number was obtained as follow: "100 revenue pius $14
yield from $20 of R&D plus 15% return of advertising and marketing." However,
in the 1st "income statement" of company X, the R&D spending is only $10, not
$20. So, is there a mistake some where or I misunderstood something?

Q2: If I understood your intention correctly, you're simply adding 70% of the
costs spent on R&D in the 1st year to the revenue of the 2nd year (this is how
I came up with 108.5 for the revenue of company Y for the 2nd year). Adding the
cost of successful products (70% of R&D) from the previous year to current year
revenue doesn't make sense to me. To be more realistic, shouldn't you make an
additional assumption on how much useful products came out of R&D will add to
next year's revenue? For instance, new products will generate additional
revenue equals to 2 X the cost to develope them? JMHO.

Thanks. Hope to hear from you soon.

You are absolutely right. I implicitly added the R&D yield to the revenue
without explaining it. This was an oversimplification that I used to illustrate
the concept, and not a numerically realistic example.

Being a scientist has little to do with understanding the numbers (actually,
you were the only one to pick up the inconsistency), it is much more a matter
of paying attention to the details, in my opinion. That is what I was so
fervently trying ot communicate over this thread. If one does not bother to
study the details and the methodolgy behind them, one is easily taken advantage
of.

If you want to see numerically accurate numbers, download the INTC model from
my site. start with the summary on the worksheets tab, then proceed to the
income statement then to the economic matrices tab, and you will see the
logical progession of the anlaysis. The historical information is laid out
slightly different, but it is all contained on one page which may make it
easier. If also shows graphs which illustrate the trade-off between investment
growth and investment efficiency in the pursuit of value.

It is possible, though unlikely (I'll have to run the numbers). Think of a
company with a strong brand name, no real competition in its markets (due to
significant barriers to entry), heavy capital expenditures with mgmt using
aggressive amortization schedules, acquistion happy management that is forced
to eat a lot of goodwill, wide gross margins that defers large amounts of
revenue into reserves and invests the marjority of the rest of net revenue in
marketing and R&D. That effectively:

1.) increases cash flow in two ways by lowering the level of taxation (less net
taxes for that year), yet the company still gets to enjoy the investment income
from the cash reciepts.

2.) increases potential value through massive investment in revenue generating
activities such as marketing, advertising and research and development while
simultaneously increasing relative cash flow by reducing the level of taxation
by investing those funds in revenue generating activities instead of paying it
to the tax man.

3.) reduces accounting earnings significantly due to depreciation and
amortiation from the capital expenditures (such as fab plants) and
uncapitalized leases - although true economic earnings have not changed a bit.

4.) further reduces accounting earnings though the amortizationof goodwill,
although real economic earnigns (the stuff they put in the bank) have not
changed a bit. This all serves to raise PE and lower accounting earnings
without effecting any real cash or earnings. PB is really a worthless measure
if used as a standalone measure for many assets aren't reflected in book value.

P/S can be thrown off if the investments do not generate an immediate return by
the next accounting period, eventhough the return is obvious and is seen and
understood by the street, as in the case with some</ib> biotechs.

were bought out in the last year, I feel I have a good feel for finding value.
One look at numbers in my earlier post and I'd be on to the next company. Not

Thread,

I apologize for my hotheadedness recently. My thoughts:

As we know, there is a certain type of value investing born out of the
Depression and modified by others that subscribes to the safety of capital
above all else. Hence, the term "margin of safety" as it
has been popularized in value circles and on this thread. While most investors
say they seek value, they do not all seek value in this vein.

We also know the analysts, institutions, and most money managers
describe value differently, adjusted for future growth/discounted
future cash flows. As we know, the further in the future, the
more optimistic becomes the conjecture that goes into these models.

A model that values MSFT at 525 at these market valuations seems to fit in this
latter category. I do not find the margin of safety
as I understand it. I do not find a floor. What did this model value Citrix at
the day before MSFT's announcement cut it in half?
Or 3Com late last year, before Intel's announcements.

I did not start this thread as a growth stock thread. If we
want to know what the most sophisticated growth models output,
we can look at the price targets put out by the analysts.

Value investing that seeks a floor and a margin of safety is
hard, and doesn't fit into models easily. Even Graham dismissed
his own intrinsic value formula, saying it lies somewhere
between net assets and the calculated intrinsic value.

Do value investors really subscribe to the belief that Wall Street knows
better? I sure don't. IMO, there is a limit to what books
can teach you, but unlike a lot of professions, you can jump right
into hands-on experience with investing.

I can describe a fracture in so much funny orthopedic terminology
that "laypeople" wouldn't know if I was talking about my last vacation
or not. But it doesn't change the fact that he/she would know exactly
which way it is angled and whether it broke the skin and how
many pieces there were, etc. If I've learned anything from medicine,
it's that the terminology is as much to create the professional aura
as it is practical. Every MBA and JD friend of mine says the same
thing.

Professionals welcome, but let's try to keep in line with the
goal of the thread, which doesn't start with stratospheric
base values of the most popular stocks on the market and then call
it safe or a value.

The problem is never the model and certainly never with the model's creator.
The problem is always in the inputs. And one assumes one can make adjustments
before reality is reflected in the stock price.

re: Duration and convexity. Ah, that duration part would be past calculus and
into differential equations would it? Not too many references to it in Graham,
Dodd, Lynch, Rodriguez, Davis brothers, Spears, Whitman, Mr.Womek etc.

Read FAF Journal for many years. (That's Financial Analyst Federation to others
reading this.) Gave up when I realized that most never seemed to make money in
the market themselves. Maybe things have changed.

Also used to work with people, who, when all else failed in an argument, would
pull themselves up to their full height and say, "Well I have a Ph.D.and you do
not. That's why." These people were eventually put away where they could do no
harm.

Here's why I think somebody else's models are not applicable. Take MFST. When
(okay maybe if) MFST drops and people are basing their investment decisions on
your model (I think that is what you are suggesting?), then in looking for an
explanation, or a reason to hold on, or to keep the faith (and I mean after
seeing the drop highlighted in the media, with correct or incorrect assessments
of its demise (as was reported with DEC, IBM, etc), it comes down to believing
in the correctness and validity and worth of the model. If the model (and
implicitly the creator) cannot generate these responses in the user, then IMO,
the user will give up. (The model could of course, remain a perfect predictor
long term). I believe most people are themselves aware a priori of this
behavior in them; therefore the vast majority will never give your model a
chance. They will do just fine without it.

Mike, I took a look at the 10-K for China Resource Development. It is indeed a
net-net buy. (Current assets less all liabilities > share price). When Graham
was investing, things like Microsoft were net-net buys. This puppy is no
Microsoft. Its kind of funny when you read Graham today. He says you should
only buy - not net-nets, but net-nets with a 33% margin of safety (current
assets less all liabilities > 2/3 of the share price). And, he says, you should
rule out any low quality companies. That dog don't hunt today! Although I have
heard stocks like this were out there as recently as 1973. What you need to
take from Graham today is the logic behind the methodology, not necessarily the
exact formulas. The logic is timeless, the formulas are dated.

OK - I owe you a thumbnail sketch of CHRB. I'll give them this, they're unique.
What you're buying is a U.S. shell corporation which owns a Chinese entity in

Just looked at Ingram Micro too. (Not getting much sleep these days)

Give the computer that gave you this one a kick. Not even close to a net-net
buy. I think your screening may have been tripped up by class B shares or
something. This is why I'll always have a job - computers can screen, but you
still need an analyst. IM is a big company covered by Wall Street trading at
about 7 times book value. Looks like the kind of thing a guy like you would
short. Not even close.

Keep 'em coming. My favorite step in investing is doing this. Taking the
results of a screen and weeding out losers. It takes about 10 minutes if you
know what you're looking for. Of course that does not mean you invest in it,
but it is a way to take a screen of 50 companies and narrow it down to five or
ten for deeper research.

WHX is one that deserves further research.

I am going to close every post I write with this until somebody responds. "LOOK

It won't show up on any of your screens, because the cheapness of the stock is

perfect timing from a large portion of

understand of transnational business
with China, I'd rather real Chinese were

recent strategic maneuvering shows a

I definitely don't like that they are
in with the PLA, however necessary it

Paul, the competitor (SALD) is scrambling to stay alive. Part of that effort is
actually the closing of some sites, some of these closures are in markets where
LTUS is doing just fine, so the effect of that particular aspect of "trying to
stay alive" is positive for LTUS. The 2 companies don't directly overlap in
every market, either. So, in theory, both companies can be successful. It's
just that one keeps stubbing their toe. When I last looked at LTUS's ebitda, it
was clear that they would be a good candidate for an LBO - their cash flow is
very strong. But for now, they are growing at about 20% a year, so buying back
stock or a total LBO doesn't seem to be in their plans - at least for now. My
only fear is that some other restaurant company goes public with the symbol

Found two pearls from Buffett relevant to
the recent discussions here:

Re: Margin of Safety, he said, "There is
simply no precision to the process---and if
you think so you are kidding yourself. There
should be such a margin of safety that you
don't need to carry it out to three decimal
places."

Re: Intrinsic value, he said, "Intrinsic
value is importantly influenced by what you
do with captital over time. Intrinsic value
is more than simply adding up the pieces at
the time.

A related quote from Charles Brandes,"A
value standpoint requires that the investor
pay only for what is seen, not what is hoped."

These are from Janet Lowe's 1996 book on
value investing.

What do people here feel is the best measure
in today's numbers of management's ability
to invest capital wisely in the future?

Return on Capital? ROE? Growth? Use of
Cash flows? What else and why? Are there
minimums or maximums you like to use in
this endeavor?

for one would be curious if someone offered a method for valuing an asset,
whether it be correct or incorrect.

As for the correctness of the model, not ONE person actually downloaded the

ROE is probably the best measure, but its tricky. Many value investors would
rather see LOW return on equity than HIGH in the stocks they buy. I'm not

All,

Re: medical value, update, and another valuation model

Quite a while ago I was asked what medical stocks I liked
on a value basis. I posted I didn't really like any, but
it would have to be one that provides a product or a
health service (not management or insurance) and that it
would have to somehow stay above the fray of managed care,
perhaps a cosmetic application. All while keeping its
value ratios in line with an undervalued stock.

Bob Davis, who distributes the excellent Napeague Letter,
brought up Candela Corporation (CLZR) as the focus of one of
the NL issues. This company produces the candela laser,
cryo-techniques, and is starting up a day-spa concept
for outpatient cosmetic surgery and health rejuvenation using
its minimally invasive techniques. This appeals to the
wealthier among us and is therefore not as affected by
the managed care belt-tightening.

After evaluating it for several months, today I purchased
it at 6. This company looks like a good value
for its industry, with strong management, cash flows, and below the industry
averages in just about all valuation areas. It has good market makers and a 30%
institutional ownership.

Update on Numerex (NMRX): the company has bought back 470,000 of its
11M shares and yesterday it announced it is extending its
buyback based on its perception the shares remain extremely
undervalued. This is a turnaround play that was brought up
very early on the thread. Disclaimer -- I also purchased
this one today.

Just two ideas.

I think Ken Fisher suggests that we simply *avoid* high PSR stocks. Period. And

Besides, from what little I know about shorting -- 1. It is a kind of a
short-term "bet" that the stock price will go down, and 2. The potential for

And then hold for a while. This is just so against
my nature, if not all human nature.

I screened for negative sales growth plus
LT Debt>>equity, and PSR>20. The screen
works, in a sense -- you get all kinds
of companies trading for less than a buck,
and a lot of low cap oil&gas explorers.
Nothing marginable, so hence they
are not shortable. If you leave out
the balance sheet problems you get
a bunch of development stage cos,
esp. biotech. But it seems to be
on the right track. I'll keep trying.

As long as you put tight stops on the
shorts, there's no unlimited risk. Problem
is, how much do you believe the stock
will go down? I'm only aiming for 10% in
a bull market (which usually happens either quickly
or not at all given my technical entry)
so I need tight stops. Got stopped
out of all mine today except IBM. This
is why I'm looking for a value-based
alternative.

Good investing,

I believe there's no time limit on shorts, but you can
only short marginable stocks (right
off the bat many of the best shorts
are unavailable to you). Also, if insufficient
investors hold the stock on the margin
side of their account, then there may
be a short squeeze, in which you
are forced to buy the stock back
whether you want to or not. There
are other ways to squeeze shorts as well.
If the stock has a lot of outstanding
short interest (which a lot of the
marginable but shaky companies do),
then good news can send us all
scrambling to cover, causing a
gap up or a large loss in a small
period of time.

I don't feel it is unreasonable that
value investors could short. Given
the latest study, they may even be the
best at it.

If I come up with an interesting prospect
or a good screen, I'll post it here.
In the meantime, does anyone remember

method for shorting? It came out mid-late

Shorting isn't that much differnt than going long IMHO. If the stock moves in
the direction you are looking for you make a profit. I've heard talk about
unlimited losses with shorting, sure if you short a stock and refuse to cover
for a loss, but that makes as much sense as holding onto a stock you paid
$50.00 for and watching it go to 0.
Here are the basics of how shorting works.

You contact your broker telling him the stock you want to short.
He/she finds (if avalible) shares to borrow so you can sell them.
While short you have to pay any dividends that are paid the stock.
If the stock moves up too much you will get a margin call.
if the person,inst,etc. that the stock was borrowed from decides to sell it and
additional shares can't be found to replace the ones you borrowed you will be
forced to buy back(cover your short position reguardless of the price at the
time.
Here is a bonus from the IRS on shorting, if the comapany goes under making the
the stock you shorted worth 0.00 you get all the profit and don't have to pay
tax on it because you never have to close the position : )

While the risks are greater in shorting, the rewards can also be greater, in
that stock usaly fall faster than they rise. Just look at some of the wrecks of
late and you can see what I mean.

I primaraly trade long, but have made some of my best killings on shorting.
Shorting is a part of investingthat I feel everyone should take the time to
look into. Being short in a brea market can be just as rewarding as being long
in a bull market.

As far as stratagy for shorting the high flyers are the best IMHO stocks like
IOM,AOL,PRST were good examples as when the bubble bursts the fall is fast.

Two centuries of research:

From the latest Forbes' story, "Runup? Or Catch-up?"

"...tracks the valuation of the stock market in
real, inflation-adjusted returns. By this measure, the
market only recovered its 1968 peak in 1989...The
runup that took the Dow from around 1000 to 700 was in
good part catch-up. The market seems to have been working
off the real anomaly: its prolonged underperformance
in the inflationary late 1970's and early 1980's."

"It suggests the market did not fully repair the damage
of the 1970's bear market until 1995."

They charted 200 years of stock market value against
200 years of real GDP. I wish I could post it because

long, but to me it's like telling someone, walking backward is the mirror of
walking forward. From what I see, people don't do it (shorting) well.* Have to
allocate funds between long and short and also face getting whipsawed.
Man, it is really just like at the craps table. Dice turn cold, people bet

Re: stops and shorting

Effectively, you need to use technical
analysis. My shorts, though fewer
in number by far, have been more successful
than my longs -- what that says about me
I don't know. Alternatively, you could
just use percentages, but to me that's
a shot in the dark. Or if you know the
company intimately, you could just wait
because you know it's going down.

Using TA, you can find, say, when a company
is bumping up agains some significant
overhead resistance, hitting a trend
channel boundary, or hitting
a Fibonacci number on a retracement during
a downtrend. There are lots of other
examples. Then, you just set a mental
stop to get out if the scenario doesn't
play out technically. My futures experience
led me to study TA intensely. I can't
help but use it for position entry in
stocks.

To answer someone's question, shorts do
not free up cash. They are always borrowed
(you are shorting stock that your brokerage
borrowed for you from another investors
margin account), and hence in your margin account.
But it's not like you can keep 100% shorts
and then still have 100% cash to play with.

BUT this is TA. Stops are not a part
of value investing as I understand it.
Hence my search for a value-based strategy.
Shorts take a lot of maintenance as I
practice it.

I may have found something, and am currently
researching it.

Re: Beta

I second (or third or...) your thoughts.

Beta (the covariance of a stock's price movement
w.r.t the market as a whole )as a measure
of risk is derived from the Efficient Market Hypothesis
(though it existed long before EMT, IMU),
which is something that value investors typically shun.
Buffett said something like "if markets were efficient
I'd be a bum on the street with at tin cup" or words

Since Mr. Rammaport asked me to stay on the thread (and since I have calmed

inexpensive capital if they don't care about volatility or beta. A high beta
restircts access to reasonably priced equity capital, and high volatility
restricts access to reasonably priced debt capital. Therefore (with all things

path to capital. This is especially important for young companies in capital

1.) software having a higher cost of capital - MSFT has a lower beta than the

debt capitaliztion.

2.) you don't use a three month t-bill unless you are looking at a three month

and selecting a sampling that is statistically insignifant. Ten years is the

Re Shorting:
My experience with shorting is primarily hedging of convertible bonds,
otherwise I find the odds are not favorable (1. Maximum Gain 100% vrs max
loss ???% and 2. long term the market has trended up), however I have account
at 3 differant brokerage houses and find their rules all differ.

Observations
1. Make sure where you deal with they have access to a good inventory.
(some places I've been called frequently or just could not borrow the
Stock)
2. Usually shorts are kept in a separate account with no interest, as well
funds are xferred between my margin account and short account on a
weekly basis depending on value of short.
One account I have lets me add the money from the short to my margin account
reducing my margin interest and charges a "borrowing fee" of
approx 1.5% (good deal), however this full service accounts brokerage fees
are a killer.
3. Any time an interesting situation developes I've either been unable to
"borrow" stock to short, or have been called just prior. IMHO the big money has
first call on these.
4. There are some interesting variations of shorting with options, E.G. covered
puts when you have short in place.

5. As mentioned most of my shorting is with covertibles, half hedges etc which
reduce risk and can increase gains.

I see your point, but I am talking about investing, not raising capital. One
interesting characteristic of most value stocks is that they do not need to
raise equity capital. And I do not think volatility of the stock price has much
to do with the cost of debt capital. Volatility of cash flow, yes - stock
price, no.

Then you said <<Therefore (with all things remaining the same), two comanies

Once again, a good theoretical point, but if two companies with the same
prospects could have highly disparate betas, wouldn't that tend to undermine
the concept of beta?

Beta may be useful in valuing long term forecasts. But two things on that
point. First, i think Beta is the least of the uncertainties in a long term
forecast. I rarely buy off forecasts of more than a year. And second, as an
investor - not a threoretician, think of what you are doing when you discount,
say, Philip Morris's equity cash flow projections at 9% (based on beta of .43).
Even if you are 100% right, you will only earn 9% long term unless you buy at
some margin of safety. I'm looking for a little more than that, so I will
generally use a discount rate of 12% or higher no matter what Beta is. Call it
built in conservatism.

Philip Morris is perhaps the most interesting illustration of what Beta is, and
what it is not. MO's Beta is only .43, because it has a low correlation with
the market. I smoke a pack a day in a boom, and I smoke a pack a day in a
recession. But it is a very volatile stock in the short term. And there is a
good degree of uncertainty in the long term. Would anybody call tobaccos low
risk today?

I disagree. Investing must encompass raising capital, for that is part of doing
business. For instance, you used Philip morris as an example. Does MO use stock
option plans to compensate executives? If they do then "that" capital is very
succeptible to volatility (re: option pricing). Projected cash flow volatility
is the primary source of equity volatility. If a "value" stock uses an
executive stock option plan, its investors must consider volatility.

<Once again, a good theoretical point, but if two companies with the same
prospects could have highly disparate betas, wouldn't that tend to undermine
the concept of beta?>

Not at all. Beta, put simply, is the standard deviation from the mean
volatility of the S&P 500. The fact that one company uses debt and the other
doesn't can cause two very similar companies to have disparate beta (debt
increases the uncertainty of anticipated cashflows = risk = deviation form
expected return). That is why you must deleverage beta when calculation the
cost of equityu capital. Here I mean oppurtnuty cost, a direct measure of risk
the way the market measures it, and not some independant firm.

< I rarely buy off forecasts of more than a year.>

Equities are priced with projections ranging form 3 to 10 years. One year worth
or cash flows are practically meaningless since most companies are considered
to be perpetual entities. Look at it from a more personal perspective. If am
insurance salesman were to sell you a 10 year annuity with a face value of
$100,000 and a price of $78,000, would you judge the value of that annuity
according to the cash flows of 3 months (a fiscal quarter), one year (the
horizon you stated) or a full ten years. Using 3 months or one year will most
likely give you such an erroneous result that you'll come a lot closer to
ascertaining whether it was a good value even it you wre 80% off in your ten
year projection (bringing everything back to the present value - DCF). The same
concept can be used for any financial asset, it is just that the calculations
get more complex as cash flows take on different characteristics (such as
contingent cash flows).

<And second, as an investor - not a threoretician, think of what you are doing
when you discount, say, Philip Morris's equity cash flow projections at 9%

than that, so I will generally use a discount rate of 12% or higher no matter
what Beta is. Call it built in conservatism.>

That method doesn't make sense. You discount the cash flows at a rate that
represents total firmwide risk, not what you think the equity will throw off in
cash flows. If the discounting factor (the cost of capital as dictated by the
market) of MO is truly 9% which it probably isn't if you used straight beta to
do the calculations (you must delevarage beta in order to remove the embedded
risk of debt capitalization inherent in beta when the original calculation of
the beta was made), you still have to include all the other significant forms
of capital that constitute MO's capital structure. This can get complicated,
for some companies such as MO hedge aggresively with derivates that have those
contingent cash flows that I referred to earlier such as convetible bonds,
swaps, caps, etc. You must also include, and capitalize, non-capitalized
leases. Leases, swaps, caps, and structured products are located off
balancesheet, therefore you must search the foot notes for them. Then you have
to take into consideration the stratight debt that exeists, whether they be
bonds or bank loans, or both. Once you have a cost (risk factor) for the major
sources of capital , you then must add weights to them in order to come up with
a single number in which to use a discounting factor. That number is known as
the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). IT is wiht this number that you
use to discount the projected cash flows of Philip Morris. The major reason
being, that if you just use the equity risk weight, you are skewering your
results do to the fact that much more than equity capital could have went in to
the production fo those cash flows, or to put simply, you must compare apples
to apples.

Now (to make a long story short) after you have found the appropriate
discounting number, any return on capital above that number is considered
VALUE. In other words, MO has 9% return on capital yet has a WACC of 12%,
therefore it is destroying economic value at approximately 3% per annum. The
same goes for hte inverse (these are simply illustrative niumbers). Now, the
insitutional investor (or layperson) can go through all of these calculations
by hand (if they know what calculations to go throught) or they can just plug
them into a fincancial model (which serves as a big, intelligent calculator
that knows the rules).

In using DCF to project these values, you now know what price the stock is
actually worth from an economic value perspective. Knowing this, you also know
whether it is currnetly selling at a dicsount or a premium to the cumulative
value generated by its anticipated cash flows.

You're missing my point. I know theoretical finance as well as you do, but I am
making some very conscious choices to ignore it in some ways.

1) I do not like to forecast. That does not mean that I value something off of
just the first year's cash flows. What it means is that I like things that
trade very cheap on assets. Of course, you'd say, the asset valuations are
based on cash flows. Maybe, but I'm not talking theory here. If Red Roof Inns
trades at a discount to the price its hotels are worth in the real estate
market, that's a buy. Beta or DCF analysis is a waste of time in this case. Why
introduce all kinds of forecasting errors when you know exactly what the
company owns? Granted, this will not work for a Microsoft or Intel, which is
one of the reasons I stay away from those.

Forecasts of cash flows may look really scientific on the computer screen, but
how much confidence do you really have in those numbers 2, 5, or 10 years out.
Let alone the "terminal value", which often makes up 70 or 80% of the valuation
of a growth stock. For the vast majority of companies, I cannot imagine you
could have much confidence in those forecasts. So why not look for situations
where you don't need to forecast? For most of the companies I own, the value is
right there on the balance sheet and/or in current earnings.

2) On the Philip Morris example I presented, you dodged the argument. 0.43 is
the beta for the stock. Even if you deleveraged, it would still be very low -
debt is not high. You pointed out that Philip Morris has need to raise equity
capital. I would suggest you take a look at the company. They pay out virtually
all their net income in the form of dividends or share buybacks. Of course,
there are stock options, but that is trivial compared to the size of the
company. My challenge to the theory was simply this. If you invest in Philip
Morris using the Beta theory, you are only demanding a 9% return. I would find
that totally inadequate to compensate for the risk. If you disagee with that,
forget Microsoft - you should be backing up the truck to buy Philip Morris.

I would love to engage these issues further. Reginald and I seem to have 100%
different views here, although let me say it clearly - I am not saying he is
misinformed or anything. If this argument is boring or anything, feel free to
call us off. Otherwise, maybe we can come to some interesting conclusions. Join
in - there are all kinds of angles on this debate - and, as Reginald said, it
is at the core of investment logic.

Respectfully,

Jim

I forgot this one. I said I use a 12% or higher discount rate when I forecast,
and Reginald had a big problem with that. But I didn't make my logic clear.

That is not theoretical finance. What is a discount rate? It is WHAT YOU WANT
TO EARN ON YOUR INVESTMENT. That may be much higher than the market expects to
earn, if they are using Beta. So be it. You don't have to buy the stock. I
understand the theory thoroughly, so I feel very comfortable adjusting it.

There are two ways of deciding on your discount rate IF you are going to
forecast. First, you could go the theoretical route and plug Beta into the CAPM
equation. Not hard. That's what Reginald is arguing, and it is totally sound in
terms of theoretical finance. OR you can say, what do I want to earn off this
stock over the long term. If that's 9%, use 9%. If its 15%, use 15%. I'm not
looking for the theoretical value of the stock - I m looking for the price at
which I would invest in it and sleep well.

Another way of doing the same thing is Ben Graham's concept of margin of
safety. Use the theoretical discount rate, but then buy at 60% of the value
that kicks out. If you do it my way, you are effectively building in the margin
of safety.

< Granted, this will not work for a Microsoft or Intel, which is one of the

You will have a serious problem valuing companies as we move into an
information and services driven economy and away from the remnants of an
industrial economy, with the balance sheet method. Two of the three companies
with the largest capitalization on the US markets have value that rests
primairly off balance sheet, and it is getting more pervasive as time goes on.

<Forecasts of cash flows may look really scientific on the computer screen, but

Refer to my insurance annuity example.

<On the Philip Morris example I presented, you dodged the argument. 0.43 is the

Yes I did, because you are using beta for the wrong purpose. I stated that the
oppurtunity cost of capital (in terms of equity, derived from deleveraged beta)
is the hurdle rate, or breakeven point, that a company must srupaas in order to
start to create value. You are using it as a benchmark for return. On top of
that, you are failing to include the risk inherent in all other sources of
capital that MO employs to generate its cash flows. Debt may not be high, but
it is there and does affect oppurtuntiy costs (therefore risk, imagine if they
somehow missed two consecutive payments and the bond covenant allows for a take
over of board three board seats - hypothetical long shot, but quite possible,
that is how Milken gained control of companies that were far from bankrupt).
Thes are also a plethora of other forms of off balance sheet capital that I am
sure MO uses, such as uncapitalized leases and swaps (which are often used as
off balance sheet financing to convert a variable rate bond to a synthetic
fixed rated note when management feels rates have bottomed out, like now).

<You pointed out that Philip Morris has need to raise equity capital>

I never said that.

<My challenge to the theory was simply this. If you invest in Philip Morris
using the Beta theory, you are only demanding a 9% return. I would find that
totally inadequate to compensate for the risk.>

Using DCF, you are demanding a minimum of 9.1% to get an economic return of
.1%. This is not unacceptable (again, I am using your number of 9%, I don't
know how accurate it is without calculating it myself). If you are demanding a
ten percent economic return on your investment, you are expecting a 19% net
return on MO's invested capital. If you are looking for a 20% return, MO must
bang out numbers amounting to 29%.

Actually, MO is a well run company, i just hate cigarettes.
