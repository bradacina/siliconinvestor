Mike, Armin, are you all concerned about the inability of ABC/ESPN to win the
NASCAR lottery or the NCAA basketball lottery? ESPN has by far the best race
coverage of the networks and I am disheartened that NBC won the contract.
NASCAR races are some of the highest rated programming for ESPN. The only thing
ABC/ESPN has left is college football and that excludes some conferences namely
the SEC. I know that this is only a portion of DIS but those are MAJOR deals
(NASCAR-4 Billion, NCAA-6 Billion) and I was concerned about the loss in
advertising revenue. Any opinions?

Paul, I joined you in NWPX this AM.

I also noticed that the price is below book value ($14.47), in fact at the
present price of $11.50, it is close to net tangible BV of $10.50. But this is
more than an asset play.

(1) EPS should be around $2.00 this year. PE of 5.8
(2) Long term PE range is usually between 7.8 and 13 for the company.
(3) Analyst's have EPS for 2000 at $2.54 - 27% increase. Probably not.
(4) Debt/Equity at .80

I chatted with IR for a bit before buying.

(5) Next year outlook not solidified yet. Should be good earnings, but would
not call $2.50 level the most likely. But it is possible. I'd be happy to see
it within 2 years. If possible in one, that's gravy.
(6) Long term outlook very promising with infractructure replacement
expectations. And safe drinking water act supposed to force the issue(?). I'm
getting literature in the mail.

(7) The focus next year is to reduce debt. That was to be the focus this year,
but the opportunity to acquire Saginaw (N. Am. Pipe) and others was quite
compelling. Notice Saginaw had revenue of $18 million and purchase price of $5
million.

(8) They do not understand the stock price. No ugly news pending.

relatively (to the market) low p/e's, are close to book value, and sometimes
even pay a dividend. Given that it's a tough competitive and cyclical industry
- maybe very cyclical (the earnings go poof?)--- and it almost seems like it
could be like the out-of-favor-the-boom-is-over housing stocks -- maybe it's

Thanks Crow, for the insurance list. And the food tip (Sounds awful, but I will

because the companies looked fundamentally good (cheap) to me, not because of
merger possibilities. It's too difficult for me to scope out which companies
might likely be takeovers. Something will happen - that I agree with. I leave
it to others here who might be more astute in ascertaining the future of the
insurance/banking/brokerage industry(industries).

As a brief recap for you, on this thread there have been on-going discussions
about the bond insurers (ABK vs. MBI) and with the plusses/minuses of title
companies (FAF, FNF, and CTZ). Also Allstate (ALL) has been discussed as it has
dropped to its lows. Occasionally some mention of reinsurers (Bermuda based,
also Buffett's Berkshire.) Also, at least one person has posted he likes
(bought?) CNA.

Right now, I'd guess there might be some interest still in CTZ because of its
price vs. the price it's received in a buyout offer. Also perhaps ABK and MBI.

For me, I'm monitoring SAFC and trying to add to added to a small position I
have in ESREF. I want to mention now also that I like insurers with reasonable
records and which sell with "good" dividend yields. I have long term positions
in HSB and CGI and a couple of months ago posted that I bought OCAS. (and I
also have CTZ, FAF, FNF, and MBI.)

re. REITs, it is completely untrue that "in most cases the dividends offered

re. how to pick them, if you don't know where else to start, try looking at the
REITs with the biggest market caps.

To name just one, EQR is one of the very biggest. It has a dividend of $2.84,
with cash flow from operations (FFO) that was $4 last year and expected to be
$4.47 this year. You will note that the dividend is easily covered by the
cashflow.

EQR is a good and steady performer, with a 7.6% yield, and an 9% growth rate on
FFO, as estimated by Salomon Smith Barney. Adding these two numbers gives you a
total expected return of >16%.

There are many other REITs you can pick that have yields and growth rates
similar to those of EQR.

When I read Armin's comment, I had the same reaction you and Jim did. As far as
REITs go, the biggest problem facing them is not the unit trusts or the
possible cyclical downturn in certain sectors. Rather, IMO it's that the
required return on equities for most investors these days is somewhere north of
25%. Per week. So what does a guaranteed taxable 14-18% offer an investor with
such a high discount rate? Nada. A lot of my favorite REITS have absolutely
fallen off a cliff in the last month, and I'm looking to move in with more
capital. If the markets really take a dive, I expect the REIT sector (and not
the net nets) to be one of the few true safe havens.

Craig Bartels: re: MO. I will look at your decision from a different way.

We know the pundits have two extremely divergent views on MO. It is either very
undervalued based on its components and/or based on the fact that any potential
legal awards or agreements will either be "reasonable" or tied up in courts or
appealed. On the other side, "they say" it's not possible to scope out in
advance what the various judges/juries/lawmakers' decisions/effects will
ultimately be. The government bodies seem to be intent on taking the present,
maybe also past profits of MO for themselves. It is possible that MO could seek
bankruptcy protection or otherwise cause shareholders much pain and grief.

Therefore, I ask, why are you trying to make a buy or pass decision on the
stock of this company? What additional information that is not already
generally known do you have or ruling reason would you have to tilt your
decision to a buy? Your profile says you are 23 years old with 6 years
investing experience, using an aggressive style- part long term and part day
trading. And you want to have a million dollars in 7 years. So I wonder why you
would ever be interested in a stock like MO. To day trade for a few points?
That might very well work - esp. from these levels - but then why would you
care about the opinions of value investors here? On the other hand, if you were
to be a long term holder-- do you really think a stock like MO--where you would
be investing without having any way of putting the odds in your favor (you're
not an attorney or in the tobacco business or financial analyst)and where (I am
guessing here) you would have to put up some relatively big money from your
portfolio (I am assuming here too) --- is a suitable stock for you? That is, I
am guessing that if you were to buy MO, it'd be for more than a dinky number of
shares, since I assume your portfolio has to grow substantially and rather
quickly if you are to achieve your goal. If the decision to buy is for a few
shares only or few dollars only, why bother.

From what I can see (and I admit I might not be able to see too much -g-), it's
not just a question of what's ultimately going to happen with MO at current
stock levels, it's more an issue of whether this stock is suitable for someone
who has the investment style and goals you've stated.

My guess is the (long term) risk/reward and timeframe for MO to work out for
you -- does not favor you. Pass on MO and go on.

All imo, and I've been wrong many, many times before.

Agree with other poster who said asbestos = bankruptcy. In this case, I fully
expect the lawyers to pile on the judgements to the tobacco companies. I also
fully expect those judgements to far exceed the expected earnings of those
companies. Once this becomes proveable, which in my opinion is a matter of
time, they declare bankruptcy, reorganize, wipe out the liabilities, and move
offshore where most of their sales and profits are anyway.

the past 7 years. If I buy a stock and 9 months later it's completely
overvalued, I will get rid of it.

I havn't made a decision one way or the other with MO. I have never followed
the company, the stock, etc. The only thing that even got me thinking about MO
was the article in Business Week I was reading yesterday. Of course, that's
probably why I should stay away from it.

>>it's more an issue of whether this stock is suitable for >>someone who has

I do hold long term at times, depending on the stock. Examples would be Merck
and Mcdonalds held over a 5 year period, so the holding period is not an issue.
I believe some stocks are great for day trading, others better for long term
investments. I try to keep a combination of these in my portfolio. And yes, if
I did take a position, it wouldn't be for a small # of shares.

>>All imo, and I've been wrong many, many times before.

Re: asbestos and bankruptcy; OWC. Looks to me like the only asbestos related
company still standing is Owens Corning. And it looks pretty wobbly. Some
settlement reached but apparently many new lawsuits and/or question of how many
plaintiffs will opt out of settlement. Financials- earnings, book value, debt
increases-- seem impossible (for me) to understand, yet alone analyze. Plus,
co. is in housing - a cyclical business. Very ugly situation overall. Not a
company or stock I could recommend to anybody.

Yet price to sales is low, expected p/e looks low, and the stock is hitting new
lows. They seem to have an active R&D section which delivers new products.

The asbestos concerns for OWC have been around for many years. Still, in the
past 5 years, the stock price has traded over twice the current $16+ figure. To
me, I see it like I see MO: Either OWC is going to return to some substantially
higher stock price than the current $16+ or else the market is saying the
company is soon going to go into bankruptcy. I'll place a small bet (buy) on
OWC at this time. (But I won't go for MO.)

I'll monitor ILFO same store sales. You are possibly very correct in your

Re: retail

Raise your hand if you are spending at least 1/3 of your Xmas shopping on the
internet. I'd ask you to raise your hand if you are getting outrageous deals,
but I already know it's 100% of those with hands raised.

I'm not sure how the net will play out, but the current valuation of any stock
assumes an effective earnings stream that goes out 20-30 years. Knock out the
last 20 years of that stream and really the stock quite rightly loses a lot of
its value. That said, what will the retail environment look like in 10 years?
It's hard to say, but there's a good chance that with the onset of the internet
the world of retail becomes much, much much more competitive. You don't need to
be an economist to know what that means. Returns come down.

IOW, retail is now a worse business in terms of potential market power,
margins, and returns on capital than it was just 10 years ago. Lower those
barriers to entry and put a mouse in everyone's hand, and that's what you get.
JCP, Sears, Kmart. They are in for some rough times, and frankly, some
contracting market share and the loss of whatever pricing or purchasing power
they now possess IMO.

Any valuation then has to look at liquidating value, takeover value (whatever
that is), or a very speculative and downtrodden approximation of discounted PV
of cash flows. Difficult, difficult.

Expressing no opinion on the stock whatsover, I'd just point out that you might

Jim, OWC. Yes, it's about that "value of that liability" that might indeed be
the cause of that decline in stock price. (Or maybe it's the expected housing
downturn.) If I knew what the current dollar figure of the liability exposure
might be -- some $ figure multiplied by some range of probabilities of the
event occurring - then I might know better what's what.

Maybe we're approaching some sort of inflection point now with these lawsuits.
After all, the risks were known and investors could have bailed out of the
stock anytime in the past few years at prices much higher than now. So what has
changed? More certainty that bankruptcy is a possibility? I do not know.
Meanwhile - and I am reluctant to use this, but I will -g-, 8 of 10 analysts

In terms of retail, I find your arguments persuasive but respectfully disagree.
Just as papers are still delivered and read, people will continue to shop at
the malls, etc. They do so for social as much as any other reason.
Your comment about people raising there hands if they do 1/3 shopping on
internet is misplaced. The question is really how many people will do there
shopping on the internet. I have seen estimates as high as 12billion, out of
about 200billion expected to be spent. Looking at our family, I would
anticipate we will spend about 5% on the internet. Mostly books/cds/electronics
as we can usually get those at or below cost through use of the
"coupons"/closeout sights.
Loss of pricing flexibility (certainly for mfgs & distributors) has been
occuring over the past couple of years and has more to do with global
overcapacity than anything the internet has done (imo)
Anyone involved in an industry which is not plagued by overcapacity (building

John Lacelle: re tax loss peak sell point.

I have no facts as to when that might be. "They say", I believe, that it occurs
in December, around Christmas time(?).

I just wonder. If "everyone" knows that there's tax loss selling in December
and a January Effect, then I would assume rational people who want to take a
tax loss would have already mostly sold, 1) to get a better price than would be
got in December, 2) to free up funds for a Nov.-Dec. rally in better stocks, 3)
to allow some time to figure, adjust, and ensure that enough sales(and the
right kind) are made to minimize taxes, 4) to avoid a wash sale if they are
going to play the January Effect.

My general operating style is to buy value when I find it. So my opinion would
be, if you've got a value stock now at current price, buy now (i.e. at your
'next week sale price'). At least buy some now and lag in later if the price is
still attractive.

I suspect these opinions are different from the majority; You may benefit from
other posters' ideas here.

Just as papers are still delivered and read, people will continue to shop at
the malls, etc. They do so for social as much as any other reason. 

My argument isn't that people will stop going to malls, but that it will become
an even more competitive, and hence low-return, business activity. A lot of
retail businesses will go from being good businesses to poor yet still
marginally profitable businesses.

Your comment about people raising there hands if they do 1/3 shopping on
internet is misplaced. 

All told, now of total Xmas sales, about 2-3% will be over the internet this
year, and that's like 10X last year's. I see no reason why this won't continue
to explode upward. That's coming right out of the hide of traditional
retailers. And if you look 20-30 years out, boy it gets bloody. Here in Silicon
Valley, malls are trying to ban their tenants from advertising their web sites.

I do want to say that the new emphasis on P/S ratios in the press is an obvious
ploy to cater to the outrageous valuations of internet retailers. Here on the
value thread, we've looked at a lot of retailers over the last few years,and we
know that retailers often get sub-1 PSR's for a reason - big margins are the
exception.

It's just basic economics - inject more competition into a market and the
margins and returns shrivel. I realy wonder as to the achievement and
maintenance of any market power in the retail segment as more and more people
become familiar with the mouse. Any valuation of JCP or other retailers will
have to take a somewhat speculative look at maybe a 3 or 4 or 10 stage dividend
discount model to estimate this impact.

There are lots of potential scenarios. If and when the capital markets stop
funding the .com's losses, traditional retailers with cash flow will no doubt
regain an edge to a degree. It's all just very hard to estimate, IMO, and
playing JCP for its contrarian virtues may not be the way to go.

During this time of year, buy value as you find it if it looks like it has been
hit by tax-loss selling. Especially in the small caps, the last few years have
been very kind to me following this strategy. Trying to estimate the tax-loss
trough is difficult. Last year I had some rallying in November and others
waiting until January. This year, HealthSouth appears to be a prime candidate
for a move up, as does the entire REIT sector.

From:Q.

re. the timing for tax-loss selling and the January effect:

I've looked into this, because I often short broken stocks during tax loss
selling, and then cover them and play the January effect. To make a long story
short, if you short broken stocks for the tax loss selling, you want to cover
them right around Christmas. Then if you want to go long some beaten-down
stocks, you want to do it during the week between Christmas and New Year's.

A chart of historical data that I have shows week-by-week performance of a
low-priced stock index, averaged over many years. This chart shows that the
second half of the year is, on average, a bad time to hold low-priced stocks.
Then things change, and they change fast.

The last week of December is generally a strong up week for low-priced stocks,
with an average return that week of +1.5%. The first week of January is the
best week of the year, by far, with an average return of +4%, followed by 5
consecutive weeks of >1% average weekly returns. Things get less exciting after
that, but you don't get a loosing week, on average, until week 13 of the year.
Returns are generally positive for the remaining first half of the year. Then
they go to pot.

So, this the period during the year that you want to be into beaten-down
low-priced stocks: 7 weeks from Christmas through mid February. If you do that,
you will get 7 of the 11 best weeks of the year for low-priced stocks.

Hope that helps.

I lurk here a lot for the good thinking and exchange of ideas. Retailing
strikes me as an industry having to undergo revolutionary change with most of
the players not having the ability to change rapidly enough to meet the
e-commerce challenge. I too think that people will continue to go to malls but
they will, more and more, go for social rather than purchasing reasons-the "new
Main Street" Mall retailers may evolve into showcases where folks can touch and
feel the merchandise, order and get it shipped the next day or sooner. To stay
in business the entertainment function of almost all retail will have to be
emphasized over the immediate impulse purchase as e-tailing becomes more
familiar and more impulse driven itself. The challenge is how to make money at
it. I live in a town which has a revitalized downtown and the old Main Street
is very much a competitor of the new. And that competition is NOT retail but
for the entertainment dollar.
Like Paul I have been wrong many times before and in this case, because the
only new stuff I buy is food, I am more likely to misread the whole megillah.
But the arguments against bricks and mortar and B and M thinking seem pretty
compelling to me. Psssst, wanna buy a mall cheap, maybe put up a UPS
distribution center or picnic ground?

liability. Armstrong World took a similar action last year. I don't follow it
that closely - for me this bottomless liability makes a security unanalyzable,

If MO could have magically spun off their liability, they would have done it
years ago. It can't be done. If you spun off the food company, it would still
be liable if the tobacco company filed for bankruptcy. Thats why Nabisco
Holdings trades at such a discount to Nabisco, leading one to question whether
the financial maneuvering created any value at all.

Value investing cheapskates want to save some money and help bankrupt and
internet company at the same time? Buy.com is offering free shipping through
midnight tonight (Sunday). An order Amazon would have charged me $91 for cost
me only $76 on Buy.com. Wonderful business model...if you're a customer. Though
the way Amazon loses money, part of me thinks my short position in Amazon would
be better served by giving them the order.

There's another $100 or more of retailer sales that disappeared - this was not
an incremental purchase. In a sector where the difference between 0% and 4%
same store sales growth is life or death to the stock, this will be meaningful,
because I'm surely not the only one that is doing 1/3 of my holiday spending or

Probably shorting QQQ (Nasdaq 100) tomorrow at the open. (Friday close - 155)
Given my track record of shorting, if you want to make money you should
probably buy call options on it.

What I see is an index that has had a parabolic rise in the last month on top
of a parabolic rise in the last year, which built on top of a big run for the
last five years. That's what the mother of all tops looks like to me. The
largest components of the index trade at P/E multiples ranging from 50 to
infinity. The largest component of the index is being hit hard by the
government, but the stock price has yet to react (or maybe its down an eighth).
And EVERY institutional investor I know of thinks if you don't own these
stocks, you cannot outperform the market, which means they are not potential
buyers, they're potential sellers. Potential buyers are what makes prices rise,
potential sellers are what makes them fall. And interest rates are now back to
6 1/4 and rising.

Every television pundit is just bubbling with enthisiasm about this sector.
You'd have to be an idiot to short it when all the momentum is against you.

I should short Qualcom or Intel or Cisco or Microsoft you say? Yeah. That's
what I'm doing. This is a way to get all of them at once, without putting all
my eggs in one basket. Because in this world one high growth technology concept
stock with a business model egg can go from trading at twice what its worth to
four times what it is worth very quickly if the big fund managers decide they
have to own it. An index isn't going to do that to me, but I've still got my
50% downside. There ain't no value stocks in the Nasdaq 100.

much sales as possible. Compare this to WalMart, which held off its site launch
in order to make sure everything would be A-OK smooth. I'm looking forward to
the day when WalMart gets its online act together and does it right. For now,

James,

Another indication that your "short 'em all, let God sort 'em out" strategy
might actually work out for you:

I am going to be a significant buyer this Monday morning, of a number of stocks
that you probably wouldn't (I hope!) have very much respect for. Seems that my
trading portfolio (consisting entirely of shorts and cash) has been whacked
about 40% since its pre-October high point and my decision at that time to
lever up my shorts in preparation for the very real possibility of a meltdown
that every fool and his dog knew about. Sound familiar? ;-) Prudence now
demands that I cover a bit over half of my shorts.

I've read about people suffering 35-40% drawdowns, and I've thought to myself
"boy, that's gotta hurt". It turns out I didn't even know the half of it.

So am I capitulating, and is this yet another signal of the top? Perhaps. But
there may yet be quite a bit more craziness to go - any time I am honest with
myself, the only answer I can come up with is "I don't know". I guess when you
cover your Amazon short, that might turn out to be this market's last ever
buyer of fluff.... there will be no one left to short then.

I'm still going to continue to short stocks, hold cash and buy the occasional
value stock (how about more of that USU, eh? ;-). It's just that I'll be doing
so with a smaller capital base... :-(

Shorting? Again? Arrgh. So frustrating to see people lose money this way.
Insidious device, shorting. Fall for it myself sometimes. So available, so

But not sustainable profits.
No way to tell, teach or explain it though.

You may be right in what you are doing. You may be wrong. My opinion is that
QQQ is just one more play, a different shorting technique, that ultimately
(profitable or not) will divert most people from their True Purpose. One more
way for people to short without confronting basic issues. IMO.

I don't know if you have skills to short or not. (I do not, I short anyway, and
I lose. I am not immune to the disease. -g-) Since shorting is not the reverse
of buying low and selling high - as you well know - profits here depend on a
number of other factors - more important often than an analytical study of
financial aspects (which skills you do seem to have in abundance).

I'll just look you straight in the face and say this: Stop playing the other

Mike Burry, interesting way you have of managing portfolios. I don't get it,

if they have US based assets. They have no real good legal or geopolitical
responsibilities to capitalist investors. That's all okay. No reason not to
invest a reasonable amount in particular companies there.

But you put 1/3 DSWL into your Mom's account and 80% in a private trust????
Since I know you're not stupid, I assume that your Mom must have, in addition
to the 3 total individual stocks, perhaps a bunch of mutual funds/bonds/money
market funds. And 80% in a private trust? I assume there must be some
diversification there too. (If not, Holy Cow!)

Jeez. What's the point though with only so few individual stocks? Unless you're
just doing it for you - why not just put it ALL in mutual funds and be done
with it? And of all the stocks mentioned by all the people on this thread, it
boils down to basically DSWL. That's the best and almost only thing that you

Whenever I am asked about buying a certain stock, I always recommend initial

had a tremendous margin of safety below 10 that warranted doubling and tripling
and quintupling of positions. This was thanks to many things, not the least of
which was the due diligence Ron Bower shared with us online in different
forums.

Armin, to me Deswell's rise is measured from where it's followers really loaded
up - 10 and below. And while 70-100% is something to sneeze at in relative
terms today (did you get the guy on CNBC today saying risk premiums are now
negative?), I see the chart as starting to have a parabolic slope, and from a
safe, safe level in the first place.

Well there were risks and there still are. MITA had curtailed production
requirements, impact on possible devaluation of Chinese currency, lack of
liquidity in shares, etc. All I am saying is three years the company seemed
well managed and cheap for a growth company, not much has really changed except
that people probably collected at 30% in dividends. So I would not refer to the
rise as parabolic. I do not own the stock now myself, but that is mostly
because I have US investments pretty much and with the returns I am getting I
am not looking to add international risk myself. If I were looking for yield
though I would probably look to one or more of the REITs that you have written
about at your excellent website.
OT I went to yahoo and read many of the comments on USU. It is illuminating to
realize how many risks appear when you invest in a commodity type business, and
the price of that commodity drops. I keep asking myself why would anyone want
to own that as opposed to a REIT right now. My call is that there will be more
tax selling in this issue before Christmas and at some point it may be worth an
investment but I want a firesale price.

Hi, I am new to this board. WAK seems to be a good value play with the stock
continuing to be sold off in spite of good fundamentals. Revenues rose 26% to
$1.03 Billion. Net income rose 34% to $8.7 Million. WAK has little debt and
approximately $4.33 cash per share. Float is very small at 1.7M. PE is 11.28.
Is this a buy at this level of $14? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank
you in advance.

Mike, I just read your analysis on Disney at your website. I agree
wholeheartedly with your analysis and think you hit the nail on the head.

I was surprised to see that you had also purchased ANF. I too have watched it
since last year when every kid in the mall was carrying a ANF bag. At the time,
it had ran way up and I decided it was too overvalued for me. Now that it has
dropped, I have considered it, but have been weary of all the class action
suits stemming from the leak. What's your take on the lawsuits. Also, now I am
favoring AEOS which carries the similar clothing as ANF but sells a little
cheaper. This year, the teens I have spoke with say it is the hot store. Last
year I read that ANF had tried to sue them for copying their market. On what
basis I have no idea. It had dropped along with ANF and is now recovering. Do
you have any opinion on it?

Mike,

Because of the price increase, I'm about 30% DSWL, 10% various, and 60% cash.
After being fully invested for years, even to margin limit at times, I've been
cashing in the last 3-4 months. Not projecting a correction, just comfortable
with cash.

I just don't see much out there with risk/reward enough to pull away from the
interest I'm getting. (DSWL- like the dividend and taxes would kill me if I
sold). I'm considering REITs with good debt/equity and decent dividend return.

Luck to all. Outta here.

TwoBear,

Re: ANF, that was a clear, clear overreaction for the retailer with the top
turns/returns in the industry. When it hit the 22's, I just thanked God that
the momentum players bought it in the first place so that they could do such a
concentrated sell, and then gobbled it up.

Re: AEOS, it's a clear copycatter of ANF. Yet when I go to ANF, I like the
clothes. When I go to AEOS, I don't like them. And this is reflected in the
ROA, ROE, margins. When I bought ANF at 22 and change, AEOS was more expensive.
ANF should command a significant premium. If ever the sector is down again, I'd
go with ANF unless AEOS was just much, much more undervalued.

Re: the lawsuits, here's my understanding. ANF generally does not communicate
with the Street well. ANF as a whole is very equitable, treating its individual
smaller shareholders well by holding insider info close to the chest (as
indicated by its quarterly SSS reports). Unlike the rest of the companies on
the Street. This pisses the Street off. The purpose of the Street is to come
off as smarter and hence retain client assets. When they are not allowed that
luxury (through chummy and illegal meetings with CFO's, CEO's, and IR
personnel), their purpose is defeated.

So along comes ANF, and they slip. An insider leaked to an analyst. WHICH
HAPPENS EVERY DAY IN THE BIGGEST COMPANIES ON THE STREET. But oooh, now the
Street has something on ANF. All that time sitting on their hands with nothing
to offer their clients, and then they get a chance to downgrade. It was quite
an impressive slew. Many of the downgrades the day after the news broke have
since been reversed. But hey, nothing says "the Street" like "churning client
accounts."

Now, how about the lawsuits? Well, insider leaks, downgrades, depressed share
price. Heck, it just had to happen. Nothing a rising share price and continued
positive earnings comparisons won't cure. And nothing that would have hurt the
company anyway. Actually, I'm surprised that prnnewswire and businesswire allow
their services to be abused by the law firms like this - it's basically just
advertising for clients to make enough of a class to be certified. Yahoo! Quote
should unsubscribe or block these law firm announcements, IMO.

Good investing,
Mike

Re: USU, US Enrichment,

Besides having my head handed to me from my shorting, I also enjoy having my
value stocks beaten down ;-)

After reading the Barron's article, this press release seems to say that USU
has totally backed off and caved in. They'll eat their losses under the Russian
deal, they hope that the Russians will change to a market pricing formula after
the end of 2001.

Clive G.: Looking at WAK, it may very well be a value stock.
Analysis is a little complicated - for me anyway. With three associated stocks:
WHC, WAK, WAKB. Lot of offsetting factors. WAKB trades less, but looks like it
might be more of a value than WAK. Wakenhut family controls. They cut out the
dividend? I haven't checked yet to see how much WHC is in WAK. (Buy WAK, get
WHC for free?) Business grows. But contracts can be iffy - Not much barrier to
entry (I'd guess) during renewals. On the other hand, with labor market (e.g.
guards/temps) tight, profitability for WAK might be affected. (Did they give up
Travis County TX business for this reason?). ROE looks relatively (to other
businesses) poor. Stock though is trading at book value and at maybe a 3 year
low. Revenues are growing, but it's a business that rev's may be determined at
contract time, but costs maybe not so fixed over life of contract. (I can't
tell.) Co. has no debt; cash about $3 per share ($45M) if I read the latest SEC
correctly.

On balance, right now, after a few minutes looking at it, based on a business
future I can't scope, but on historicals that look pretty fair, I'd say WAKB
@$10 is a value.

Clive G. Been thinking about WAKB some more. Even thinking about placing an
order at this point, 9 13/16. But I dropped the ball. Had an imaginary
conversation with the person ahead of me on this thread, Twister, who asked me
in my mind, just how is this a business that I can make money on? As a
stockholder, there's some claim to assets that I have. (That's maybe also only
in my mind -g-). But with WAK, WAKB... man, I give up a lot. It's not an easy
business to understand or evaluate (imho), there's no dividend, there's no
stock buyback, there's no chance that the company can be taken over, there's
little possibility that stockholders (other than the controlling family) could
effect a change of control. I guess I don't like that. The only thing is, is
that the stock has traded at a higher price and I believe it will do so again.
Maybe after the first of the year. And that may be enough reason to buy the
stock now. But this means I'm buying a piece of paper that I'm only expecting
someone else to take off my hands at a higher price. Right now, I don't at all
feel like I would be buying part of a going business whose profits or value
somehow would eventually be shared with me and the other stockholders. Seems
like it's a value stock where I can't see how the value could be released.
Perhaps though, -g-, if/when the stock price rises, that's good enough. It'd be
the next guy's worry then.

I'll have to think on it some more.

Paul,

Checked back to see if anyone had looked at WAK. I've been doing DD and took a
small position in WAKB today with intentions of adding if it still looks good
after I go deeper into it.

I looked at WAK's 52+% ownership of WHC ($12+) - equals over $9.00 per WAK
share. Added over $4.00 cash and other assets, deducted goodwill. Ends up well
above the -$10 price.

Also influenced by consistent 20-30% rev and earnings growth for both
companies, their plans for expanding into related sectors, and the
international growth. $1.29 projected for '99, $1.50 for 2000.

I felt this to be a good sector. Outsourcing security and related has been a
trend that should continue.

According to Schwab, analysts on WAK = 4/SB, 7 on WHC =4/SB & 3/B. No insider
selling.

Why the sell off from $30 to $10?

Ron

Ron Bower: LOL! And I thought you were getting out of the market. Didn't take

Okay WAKB. I need a little help with the numbers. I see the cash and
equivalents as "Cash and cash equivalents at October 3, 1999 of $43.5 million
was the same at January 3, 1999." per latest SEC. That's under $3/sh.

I can't find a good history of WAK's earnings. This is the best I can
see:
http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=wakb

Rev's growing all right. But not earnings. (from what I see) And above site
says there're dividends. I don't think that's right (Can't find any other
record of dividends).

This all does not give me a comfortable feeling. However, it's not about
comfort. If you are in this stock, I will certainly go back and think about it
still and again. Can you provide any additional information on WAK, WAKB??

Ron, Looking at a 2 year chart, it looks as tho somebody spiked it then shorted
the heck out of WAK. With such a small float it would be easy to manipulate.
Bottom line, you'd better get on well with Ruth & Richard!-g- YHOO profile
shows $16 in cash(!?) and a 1.7 million float. 1/10 of that traded today alone!
An interesting stock but something is definitely going on with it at the
moment. James Rowan, the VP, was selling at the top, as was Richard Wackenhut,
the President. Ruth Wackenhut(the listed Secretary) owns over 50% of the total
stock(!).

Papaya King. I'll share with you my experience. I've found Yahoo only reports
one class of stock when there are two classes. The divisor for WAKB for per
share stuff like bookvalue (equity/sh), and all the other important stuff like
cash/sh -- should be the combined WAK and WAKB number which is about 15M sh.
outstanding. Although your point about float - for the WAKB shares - is well
taken. Trading volume is much smaller with WAKB than for WAK.

Let's see, if I buy this stock then I've got to hope for more and more crime.
Or else that more of the criminals are caught and punished. Or that just what's
caught gets sent to prison --what Wakenhut calls their "beds" (aside: "beds"
