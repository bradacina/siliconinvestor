Paul Senior. Thanks for the reference to Value Line I'll give that a trial run.
I've also come across a program called First Class Trader that looks promising
and looks to take company by company, metric by metric.

In regards to the Sector performance, I agree it may be hard to draw
conclusions out of different Sector comparisons in the same index. But was more
interested in an approach for example to take the Australian Materials sector
and compare that to similar cap Materials companies in the U.S. to quantify if
the mining boom that has happened recently in Australia has inflated prices or
are some company's still quite reasonably priced.

ATPG -

Is anyone else like me and really hoping for a bad earnings report for ATPG,
but a great report on Telemark and other production numbers/progress.

If that were to happen, and ATPG were to go down, for potentially the last
time, based on earnings, I'm going to need someone to talk me down from making
ATPG too big a portion of my portfolio. I've got a decent position now, but I'm
holding off buying more on the risk of Telemark and other projects missing
deadlines.

A couple of IF's in the above, but definitely a possibility...

re CELM looked like the best of the bunch initially until I read this:

 Corporate Information

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 11, 2007. We were
originally organized as a “blank check” shell company to investigate and
acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being
a publicly held corporation. On May 6, 2009, we (i) closed a share exchange
transaction, described below, pursuant to which we became the 100% parent of
Attainment Holdings, (ii) assumed the operations of Attainment Holdings and its
subsidiaries, including Shenzhen YPC, and (iii) changed our name from SRKP 21,
Inc. to China Electric Motor, Inc. Shenzhen YPC was incorporated in November
1999 in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, PRC. Luck Loyal is primarily a
holding company and was founded in Hong Kong in October 2004. Attainment
Holdings is primarily a holding company founded in the British Virgin Islands
in July 2008.

Why does a dinky 100M$ market cap company need to go through a holding company
in the Virgin Islands, another holding company in Hongkong to run their
electric motor business?

Then there is this

 Li Conversion
Jianrong Li, one of our directors, agreed to convert approximately $1.3 million
owed to her by Attainment Holdings into shares of the Company’s common stock on
the effective date of the public offering contemplated herein, the conversion
price of such to be equal to the per share price of the shares sold in this
public offering (the conversion shall be known has the “Li Conversion”).

Hmm, a director lent the holding company in the Virgin Island money and got
paid back via IPO. Good for him. There is some more - 600k to acquire a shell
company ia mentioned somewhere in the 424B . I can't help but this IPO has the
smelly stench of self enrichment allover it.

From:Jim P.
APL's report was not as good as I was hoping with the increase in NGL prices.
Analyst are not expecting distributions to start this year but to be in the
$2.50 range in 2011 and $3.00 in 2012.
The 4th Q had about 65 cents a share in cash flow that could have been
available for distributions if you add back hedge losses and capital expansion.
This was not too bad as the liquids price jump really did not occur until 1/2
way through the Q.
Hedges are pretty much done as they bought out most of the painful ones in
February. They have hedged out by adding calls on natural gas and puts on
product.
The 1st Q will be good and the next 3 after will quickly increase cash flow.
They did say there would be $70 million in capex this year when a short while
ago they were talking about maintenance capex of only 20 million. This is due
to well connects so very bullish.
ATLS is planning on 500 million to a billion cubic feet of natural gas
production but cannot tell the time frame.
ATLS has negotiated 100 million firm take away this year and in talks for
another 100 million.
APL is building with a partner 500 million in pipeline capacity for ATLS's gas
and the POP on the pipeline is %16.
If you do the math it works out to well over $1 per share to APL in gross
profit on their portion of the pipeline when at 1/2 billion per day flow rates.
I believe APL needs to lock in about 3 more quarters of cash flow and they will
be at a place of stability with debt and then resume distributions.
They are actually turning into a growth story so less and less risk with each
passing day.
The sector itself, NGL processing and fractionation, particularly for propane
and ethane are hot as products are being exported. The u.s. has a competitive
advantage for the time being so product prices should mirror oil price trends
with margins expanding account natural gas prices in dollars vs petroleum
products in dollars.
I think because APL is not diversified in its revenue stream the upside could
be dramatic but the dollars of cash flow will not have as high a multiple as
other MLP's
Conservatively I would discount distributable cash 2 years out a a $3 per share
per year at 8 times instead of the 10 to 12 times for the less cyclical
players.
So a $24 stock price within about 18 months if there are no changes to NGL
pricing in the interim.
That is my low return scenario as I would not view the $24 price as a sell. It
would depend on what kind of dividend growth can be expected at that time with
the Marcellus being a great low risk kicker.
I hope this helps. The negatives I have for ATLS is not paying a dividend and
they are not producing any meaningful liquids in the Marcellus. This will allow
them to scale up quickly as they do not have to add processing but makes the
gas way less valuable than the area of wet gas that Range Resources is in.
Still hard to argue with potentially 30 years reserves at 500 million cubic
feet per day.
I hope this helps.

Hi Rllee -

Re:Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB)

I guess it depends on your income and tax situation. I am using money from a
GNMA account and want to maintain my effective dividend income. I have no
earned income and generate all of my income from dividends and interest. For
me, GNMA income is not deemed a qualified dividend where the KMB dividend is
considered qualified and taxed at a lower rate.

More importantly, I am working on increasing my total portfolio dividend income
but also want to have stocks that can provide a "growth" kicker. KMB provides a
good compromise and is not subject to foreign tax with holdings too like
several of my foreign ADRs.

Finally, I look at the PE and my different MA levels to find an acceptable
entry "buy" point. I use three 50 period MA levels (days, weeks & months). On
my Daily chart KMB is 2% below its 50 day MA, 5% above it's 50 week MA and 2%
below it's 50 month MA. The forward PE is 11.3 within my "value" buy range. I
like to buy when the stock sells below it's MA. On two of my three MA measures,
KMB is still below the MA (ie. Day & Month levels).

I have been watching the stock in the $59 area when Paul Senior recommended it
(on the Dividend Investment for Retirement board
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26322757&srchtxt=kmb ). He
provided a compelling reason to buy the stock and I really did not want it to
run much higher w/o me having at least a small position.

listening to the conference call on gfre now. questions being asked so far are
excellent. Based on what I am hearing so far, I think than minimum $1.20 per
share earnings in 2010 are much more likely than not, based upon 15% increase
in bromine pricing frm December 2009 which was 2340 per metric ton, and water
treatment production line assuming it does go on line in july 2010. to clarify
the press release the $9 million would be for a full year so that for 2010 it
would contribute $4.5 million in earnings. It also sounded like there was a 4th
quarter increase on bromine prices world wide most of which was not passed on
to customers in 2009 because of the 1-2 month time lag in passing on increases
to customers. listening to the call makes me want to learn chinese, as
everything has to be translated. The company plans to uses the cash to buy more

In the 0.60's, that was about as close to a no-brainer as I have seen in some

On MNDO,

This is an Israeli tech company with a spotty record, but decent cash flows. It
is definitely no longer a buy on a book value basis (ARPs settlement has
already been paid to company and distributed to shareholders) --- we will have
to see how well the underlying business generates cash. The potential 0.20
dividend has investors excited, but I am inclined to take more profits as the
stock continues to rise. I don't whether they can continue that level of
dividend indefinitely.

I sold a little more today, but still have a fair-sized position left. I will

OT. Ha. I remember it VERY well. -g- Yeah, Dr. Burry was pretty incensed. Of
course, now he's worth $100M+, and I...uh...am not.

My point was that it's "generally accepted" -g- that doctors make lousy
investors. People say because they're gullible or maybe not so business-savvy -
that they fall prey to various glib-talking advisers. My opinion has been that
the docs are so darn successful - multi-talent success and maybe even standouts
in everything they do in school, and getting the accolades for that, that they
naturally assume they're going to be good stock market players/investors. A
continuation of their successful history. Succeeding in the market should be
pretty straightforward. I mean how hard can can it be... not brain surgery
surely. The thing about investing or playing the market is that you really have
little control over the environment: You can buy, sell, hold. You can determine
the quantities you can bet. You can take out some insurance that maybe will
protect or maybe that will give some psychological comfort (insurance as with
hedging through options). But what you can't do as a small investor is work
harder to change the company you've invested in. And - there are varying
opinions on this here - there's no correlation between the more in-depth
research made, the more successful the investment selection. So, imo, hard work
and brains don't necessarily lead to success.

Mike Burry (and others here) would surely disagree. Mike Burry from the article
appears to be hard-wired very differently from most people. So maybe he's an
exception.

my advice to you is to start reading all of buffetts letters to shareholders as
well this thread and dale's 50%. I dont use screens at all myself. i read a lot
of postings on the internet and if something catches my interest i will start
reading the sec documents and press releases. unfortunately a lot of companies
seem cheap for a very good reason. either their management is dishonest or
there business is going down the tubes. sometimes their sales are increasing
but they are not collecting on their receivables for whatever reason. I think
its very important to have some confidence in the manager and to try to
understand the business and how the business translates into the numbers. If
you dont really understand how the company generates revenues and the balance
sheet items represent you are best off staying away. We all have different
approaches. I dont have the capacity to own several hundreds of stocks and to
follow them. I am lucky to remember why I own 20-35 particular stocks, and i
probably focus on about 10 of them. a company usually doesnt have just one bad
problem. For example I will be surprised if it turns out there is nothing else
wrong with toyota. Therefore it usually makes sense to flee when you find one
thing wrong with a company that you did not expect to find.
I also like to see after a company's share price has tanked that insiders are
stepping in and buying. I remember having discussions on the Crossy thread
about ALY that looked really cheap except that even though the share price had
dropped from the high teens to single digits, insiders were still selling
rather than buying. the shares eventually dropped to a buck before rebounding
some.

another company i just looked at but cant remember the name, it seems like only
the ceo owns shares, everyone else seems to be exercising their options and not
retaining any shares. the number 2 guy in the company owns a grand total of 75

Dr Ipsofacto. Of course, this being a Ben Graham type of thread, you might want
to read Graham's "The Intelligent Investor".

One of the biggest issues you will face as a medical doctor who tries value
investing --- and I may very well be talking to myself about myself as well
here --- is the issue of patience.

Obviously I don't know your specific personality, so I only surmise a general
case. Doctors and med students lead busy lives. The feedback from what they do
is quick or relatively quick. Students take tests; the results are posted (or
however results are disseminated these days -g-). The solution to a medical
problem might be a drug or surgery. Quickly the results are known. On to the
next patient.

A process for finding stocks is developed. A stock that falls within the screen
is studied. Studied -- whatever that means: annual reports read, the 10k and
quarterlies and company presentations poured over and maybe management is
called (Mike Burry way??); or perhaps it's less time-consuming: just a few
minutes for just a few numbers (roe, p/bk, couple quarterly reports, ten-year
history in addition to the screen (Paul Senior way?) The stock is bought. Now
THE PROBLEM: It becomes, "C'mon, why doesn't the rest of the world see what I
see, and why doesn't this stock move up?" ... Soon kibitzers in the stock
market bring up a most dreaded condition... "Dead Money". "It is just too
boring to hold a stock that does nothing." "You don't have enough money to be
tying up cash like this." Other things show up on screens. Other guys' other
stocks are MOVING. Your stock goes down! So the feeling is you must sell and
try another stock or another way.

Well, jmo on why it's tough for young MD's to be value investors.

-----
I don't know where to get patience, but I do know that patience is a big
component of value investing. You're going to find plenty of value stocks that
meet your criteria. Owning them from undervalued state through to near
fully-valued will be your problem (maybe is still mine) -- especially so though
for you guys that have personalities that are used to quick results, being

debt but with high expectations, are hungry for money.
--------------------------------
For screens, I have several brokerage accounts, and all but one have preset
"value" screens that are updated frequently. And they also have screens where
the customer can select from various parameters. Microsoft, I'm told has a good
free screen. I've used Kiplinger's free screen. They're all a bit different in
what they allow or what they include or exclude.

I'm not a fan of PEG. The reason is it requires estimates of future growth (Is
it five years out?). Similarly I don't use discounted cash flows.

I like price/sales but only to compare the company to itself or to its
competitors. So I don't screen for p/sales. Some companies that are hugely
profitable for each dollar of sales they generate, don't have large sales. So
doing a p/sales ratio, their price/low sales might not show up. Whereas some
stocks such as grocers, with their thin profits on each sales dollar - but with
huge sales, might show up on a low p/sales screen. That's okay, but maybe
misleading or distracting.

I'll screen for p/b and roe. I'd say always, but I guess there must be some
exceptions.
----------------

I own FLY and HUM.
FLY: Sometimes the stocks in a sector move together. When the sector is down, I
like to buy a package. I find it too hard to determine "the best" downtrodden
stock. Buying a package reduces gains compared to if money were able to be
concentrated only in the one that later becomes the best mover. OTOH, a package
mitigates business-risk with any one particular stock (company). (But doesn't
reduce market risk-- the package of stocks can still decline in a market or
sector decline). My point: I have FLY, WLFC, GLS. So when you find one stock
that meets your criteria, you might check others in the sector. You might find
one (or more) that you like better.

===============
We have found on this thread that we hold varying opinions on what a value
stock is. On some things we agree, but on the process of finding a value stock,
or what we define for a value stock we buy for ourselves, we do not agree. I
have concluded that if three people post here that they are buying a stock that
they believe is a value stock, then that stock has a good shot of being a
winner. The reason is that three people come at it from three different
perspectives with maybe three different criteria and yet make the same
conclusion, and put their money on it.

Also, as moderator I welcome you to the thread. Your stock ideas are
encouraged. After all, it is possible you could turn out to be another Dr.
Burry. Man, we would welcome that!

Brean Murray raises their GFRE tgt to $17 from $14 following earnings and on
substantial growth and attractive valuation . The firm believes the company is
being conservative in providing its guidance, which is based on 75% utilization
of current bromine production capacity and bromine prices of $2,350 realized in

Dr. Ipsofacto. If you want to learn about one sector of value investing -
investing in the stocks of growing-dividend payers, then reading Steve Felix's
"Dividend investing for retirement" thread is very good. Lots of people have
done excellently buying, holding and reinvesting dividends back into such
stocks over a long time frame. I mention it because you fall into the category
of somebody who has the time (30-40 years) to accumulate wealth in such a way.
This investing style requires the temperament for a deferred gratification,
slow-go, set-and-mostly-forget approach. (Very dull in beginning years.)

Dr. Ipsofacto:

Running a stock screener or looking at recommended stocks is just a beginning.

To invest in any stock you should have a decent idea of the industry and the
specific stock. Once you have learned an industry you can more easily evaluate
other stocks in the industry.

Some industries we all have some familiarity with: retail stocks and
supermarkets. At least there you can have some direct experience of the
company.

There are many industries I stay out of because I do not understand them. For
instance drug development stocks. Now you might have a better understanding,
but those stocks are always quite speculative.

For myself I would never own an airline. Never have. I doubt I will. Unions,
regulation, competition and the fact that jet fuel will soon enough be ever
more expensive.

I've always favored stocks that pay at least some dividend. For instance I
would not buy a Cisco. Big, been around, but still pays no dividend. Paying a
dividend is some indication that management understands that they work for the
shareholders.

And on that point, I tend to check whether management is getting too much for
itself and is being honest. there are a lot of management cadres who seek to
enrich themselves first and foremost. Also, be aware that management can
outright lie in their press releases. Not so much on hard items like revenue,
but on softer items like progress on certain goals,expected dates of
completion, pick-up in business interest, etc.. On these types of items they
cover themselves with a blanket preamble that all such statements are estimates
and are not firm.

Look at many stocks for every one you buy.

Always read the most recent 10K before buying a stock.

Hi Paul -

I cashed out of my BRCD late last year after holding on for over eight years.
My last buy was around $3.00/share and they had over $1.80/share cash. I sold
at prices ranging from $7.50/share - $9.50/share hoping to see the stock become
a teenager again. It never did even though management was always optimistic
about the future. The problem is that you could never trust management. Every
quarter included another "one time" hit to earnings. They focused on Non GAAP
earnings which was silly as there were so many of these one time hits to
earnings quarter after quarter and year after year. The actual GAAP earnings
(and losses) were terrible but it was like they were the ugly red headed sister
which they never talked about. In hind sight these were the numbers you really
wanted to focus on.

The X-CEO was finally convicted of back dating stock options (currently on
appeal) and all the while the company paid his litigation costs per their
employment contract (there was an indemnification clause provided for both the
BOD and company executives including the CEO). The accumulated legal expenses
over the years charged to earnings (as one time expenses) was well north of $20
million! Not to mention the $160 million class action civil action that the
company paid (another one of those one time expenses).

Even in their most recent 10Q there is still discussion on these expenses. This
is after four years from the original event when the CEO and VP HR were charged
by the SEC (6/21/2006)! http://biz.yahoo.com/e/100302/brcd10-q.html
From their most recent 10Q:"...Legal fees associated with indemnification
obligations and other related costs, net. These expenses consist of legal fees
for various matters, including applicable indemnification obligations, defense
of the Company in legal proceedings, and actions to pursue claims by the
Special Litigation Committee of the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the
Company's charter documents and indemnification agreements, we have certain
indemnification obligations to our directors, officers and employees, as well
as certain former directors, officers and employees. As a result of such
obligations and claims filed by the Special Litigation Committee of the Board
of Directors, we incurred expenses related to amounts paid to certain former
directors, officers and employees of the Company who have been and/or are
subject to ongoing SEC, civil actions and/or criminal proceedings in connection
with Brocade's historical stock option granting practices.

Legal fees associated with indemnification obligations and other related costs,
net, are summarized as follows (in thousands, except percentages):
<pre>
January 30, % of Net January 24, % of Net Increase/ %
2010 Revenues 2009 Revenues (Decrease) Change
Three months ended $ 301 0.1 % $ 19,299 4.5 % $ (18,998 ) (98.4 )% ..."</pre>
The whole thing left me with a very sour taste in my mouth and management never
put the shareholder's interest above that of the board, CEO or even a few of
the VP's.

On the positive side, they now have a new CEO now but I am not too sure about
the BOD. I think there are better plays than Brocade Communications Systems,
(NasdaqGS: BRCD) considering their past history.

I am looking at Oracle Corporation (NasdaqGS: ORCL) even though it is near a
52wk high. If YAHOO is right the forward PE is very reasonable at 13. I used to
own shares I purchased in the 90's and sold for more than a double in 2005 at
$17.50. They recently bought my SUNW position for all cash. Do you think ORACLE
has some "value" at current prices especially based on Larry Ellison's track
record? ORCL ROE= 23.05% and ROA=11.47% appears to be very good considering
that the company has an enterprise value of $118 Billion. I wonder if they can
maintain these types of returns for the next $100 Billion in EV.

Yes, I've liked ORCL at p/e of 13 also. I bought shares 4/06 and 9/08 (note my
post), and as far I recall, I have not sold any of my few shares.

Although Yahoo shows only 4% sales growth, I see that ORCL's profit margins
continue and remain strong: In the past few years, between 1/5 and 1/4 of all
sales dollars have dropped to the bottom line, which is very good, imo.

I don't like stepping up and making adds near 12 month highs, so I guess I
won't add now.

Otoh, low p/e coupled with high roe (always above 20%, but down somewhat from
the great growth years) means this stock might qualify for a Greenblatt ("Magic
Formula") buy. As might be expected with the high roe, the price-to-book ratio
is high too.

Hmmm. ORCL may be one of these stocks where since I'm already in, I'm not so
interested in adding more shares. But if I didn't own it, I'd be tempted to
start up with a few shares. Somewhat illogical, if not emotional, on my part.

I also liked the story. I had no clue what kind of person Mike is and it gave
me a perspective into his thinking or how he is wired differently. I believe a
contrarian value investor must be wired differently, more analytical, less
emotional in his decision making, looking in odd places that no-one else is
looking at.

I liked the story how this thread was created, even that he went on his own

I liked how he set alone at the lunch table at this investment while the
efficient market/asset allocator. I loved the tale how Goldman created the
vehicles to bet against the mortgage bonds, how the first marked them down at
the end of each month to make their numbers appear better (and Mike's worse of

Grommit. Hotel reits. I recently bought a few shares of DRH.

I'm not so confident that I understand the complex (to me) accounting involved
with hotel reits. Or the other issues that hotel reits face. So I'm not so sure
I'm talking about a value stock with DRH.

The hotel business is still suffering. I presume there's some bottom (We seem
to have reached it, and we may be moving up), and that at some time, the hotel
reits will be back in some favor.

I've wanted to position myself in a hotel reit. As a tracking stock. Something
that seems to have all its debt issues under control and at a level which will
allow the company survive now and grow later.

I have chosen DRH.

DRH has no debt maturing until Q4 2014.

DRH has no floating debt.

DRH has no corporate debt.

DRH has $787M in non-recourse, property-specific debt.

Management seems to be operating the company with the same view that I'm
looking for from a hotel reit. (i.e. deleverage, preserve liquidity, survive,
get set now for opportunistic activities later)

This is far different from what I have looked for from hotel reits in past ---
growing revpar, AFFO per share, distribution yield, and so on.

I'll look at HPT; it might be the better buy. For me now though, I'm okay with
just the little DRH I have.

Charsay. Yes, Mike Burry could analyze companies very quickly and in detail and
could spot anomalies. And he seemed to me to back up his decisions with a
concentrated portfolio.

He was a student of value investing who was VERY quick to absorb and to
incorporate ideas. He was quite entrepreneurial. First (that I know about)
beginning this thread and the Buffettology thread, then his own website, and
his willingness to put himself out for media interviews (quoted in BusinessWeek
or Fortune and writing for MSNMoney.) And then of course, starting his own
hedge fund. After a while I came to sense that he had a lot of contacts in the
investment community (pro investors) and these folks may have supplied him with
some of his investment ideas. (And he they.)

All his stock picks that I remember were based on his idea of fundamental value
investing. No momentum stuff, or idea stocks. I followed him into several of
his picks, and it worked out well for me.
Since among the regulars who post here there's no consensus on what exactly a
value stock is, for me, I did view many of his stocks as not at a value buy
when I considered them. Other readers saw it differently. He had a big fan base
here. He did his homework and could articulate the reasons for his buying (or
selling or avoiding). He made some very good picks, but he made mistakes too, I
believe. Certainly it is not so clear that he was the best value investor on
the thread.

"...were his picks easy for you to agree with or was he picking companies were
the value was not so obvious?" That's surprisingly difficult for me to answer.
If you mean, "If I(Charshay) were there with you and Burry and the others, and
if Burry said he was buying XYZ for reasons A, B, C, would we see that as so
compelling that we also take positions in XYZ.?" For some of us, yes. On the
facts or logic (A,B,C) of it. Some people bet on the jockey though too: Mike
had the cred and so he was avidly followed. For me and maybe some others, his
picks may not have been easy to plunk money down on. Value stocks show up all
the time, and we have our individual likes and dislikes. Mike might like a
maybe-profitable net-net (was it BAMM back then?); some people would say
forgetaboutit - no crappy dink stocks for me.
Charshay, I come to it now about mentioning my baggage. That has something to
do with my world-view and the bad side of my ego. I consider myself a
journeyman in the land of investing. Along comes a "kid" with very little money
or investing experience: what does such a person know about investing in the
real world and how can such a person get a following on a website and in the
media? (The same point made by John Bogle of Vanguard funds.) So I've had to
watch myself with Mike's picks and try to separate my ego from the facts.
That's been hard. So I say, for me, his picks were not easy for me to follow up
with. Not knowing anything about you at all, I will guess if you were on the
thread at the time and carried no baggage, you would find his picks if not
appealing, at least easier to accept. And I'm trying to learn too. If for
example, Dr. Ipsofacto turns out to be not the apprentice he appears, but
rather a master like Doc B., then I want to accept that quickly and benefit
from an objective look at his (or anyone else's) stock ideas here.

TA is a rent slave for HPT. i think the posters in the Yahoo thread have it
about right when they state that TA cash should last until 2011. At this point
TA would fold and HPT would have to run those stations by themselves or rent
them out to somebody else, supposedly at a lower rent. if somebody else takes
them over, I would expect quite a few locations closures.

I think if we value HPT, you need to look at normalized rents (which I think
are going to be quite a bit lower than the current ones that TA is paying). HPT
trades at 10x EBTIDA versus DRH's 13.5x. 13,5x EBITDA is certainly not cheap so
if you are betting on Hotel stocks, you bet on a quick recovery of room rates
and demand, otherwise it's hard to justify being in this sector right now.

Has anyone looked at the Commercial RE debt REIT's STWD and ARI? I own a little
ARI and used to own some STWD as well but sold out when they spiked a bit.
Business model looks decent with the cheap financing but the management fees
bother me. I do think that both vehicles should pay 10%+ when they have their

Now that I am grappling with trying to manage taxes in a taxable account I can

on these observations I have seem to have a choice of conclusions. 1. Berkshire
Hathaway is still way undervalued. 2. The expectation that stock market should
return an average of 10% p.a. seems ridiculous when the best capital allocator
in the world only returned 11% if one was fortunate to buy shares at a decade
low. 3. stocks during that 1998-2000 period were way overpriced. 4. the

HPT. Thanks for the posts!! I'll sell my few shares. I kick myself because I
did not look too closely at this one. There are issues with some hotel minimum
payments too. Too many issues here. I won't put any faith in this either:

...can you just assure us that you’re current on TA and that they’ve paid
interest on their deferred rent balance.

Mark Kleifges

Yes TA rents are current. They did take, the January rent that was due February
1 they did take advantage of the $5 million rent deferral and they also paid us
$900,000 of interest for January.

David Loeb – Robert W. Baird

And just looking at their financials, they’ve got about $155 million of cash as
of 12/31. It looks like they’re probably burning cash at least in the kind of
quarter they had in the fourth quarter, and by the end of the year if they
continue to defer they’ll have $150 million of deferred rent. What are your
thoughts about what 2011 will look like for your investment in TA and what do
you think happens on June 30 of 2011.

John Murray

We’re still hopeful that the economy is going to recover as we move through
this year and that trucking is going to pick up. Trucking has been a leading
indicator in the past and a wildcard is certainly where fuel prices are and
that impacts TA’s business but we do believe that over the course of this year
that fuel volumes which have already started to trend up will pick up and so
we’re hopeful that TA gradually works themselves into a better financial
position and that we’re hopeful that they’re able to repay us next year.

Charshay,

IMHO, Mike's activity on SI reveals much more entrepreneurial and media savvy
person than the recent Vanity Fair article presents. I have no doubt he has
some reservations on buttering up people (a lot of people do), but I agree with
Paul that Mike did tremendous job of getting himself seen on the web when web
was rather new and there were only a handful of investing gurus on the web. I
wish I had an attitude to do what he did in the day. :) (I am much worse in
networking-selling than even article-Mike is portrayed ;)).

Regarding his posts. You read them. I'll just comment that the atmosphere was
different on the thread at the time IMHO. We were all younger and trying to
learn the ropes and trying to figure out great companies to invest into. I
think there was more heated debates about companies being or not being value
investments. Now almost everyone has their own idea of what value investment is
and - at least I personally - don't try to persuade others why X is or is not a
buy.

IMHO, Mike was not much better contributor than others here. But you see, it is
tough to judge person's forum contributions vs his or her investment
performance. For example, I never liked his TA rules like selling on new lows.
I am not sure if he continues to use them or not. I did not always agree with
his picks. I disagree with Paul that Mike never brought up "story" stocks.
IMHO, it was almost the other way, he suggested a bunch of story stocks, though
perhaps not mainstream story. Was it things like GPS and ANF at the time?

Anyway, not sure if this is helpful. :)

into the T rent component and get the EBITDA numbers for each part. Then take
the TA EBITDA number and apply a discount (pick you number - I'd say 30%) and
calculate what the "normalized EBITDA number for HPT would look like.. if yopu
like this noe "normalized " valuation there is no reason to sell.

Both HPT and HRP (and spinoff GOV) are run by and outside management company.
They take their cut based on managed assets so they have an incentive to issue
more equity. What they did not do is load up the their entities with too much
debt - their kept the 1L1 Debt/Euqity ratio pretty much constant. That really
helped through the credit crunch. other than that, i think they are mediocre
managers - just look at HRP LT record before 2008.

ALl, imo. It would be great if you could post the numbers on this board. It
will take probably 1h to get and double check it - if I had more interest in
HPT, I would do it myself.

the reason why he left. Posting on a public forum in fact could easily get him

I actually got a kick out of that quote.

Another thing, now that Michael has closed down Scion, is it possible that he
comes back to this thread? He know only manages his own money so no conflict of

Paul & Jurgis,

thank you for your comments, it can difficult when you are in the life process
of a situation that actually turns into something more familiar, you would have
to go back to re-analyze what you experienced to find out more, if you were so
inclined.

I played football (soccer to you) at school, 4 went pro, 4 went semi-pro the
other 3 choose different paths. The most successful player, played for
Manchester United. We were determined, ambitious, dedicated, worked very very
hard! This I would argue is the single most common point in any subject.

Company valuation is not so difficult, the numbers are on the statements for
all to read, what is harder is to spot financial trickery and to put yourself
out their by calling Investor relations, speak to CFO/CEO's, the ability to
spot Catalysts that could unlock value in a company, by reading the reports.

Extreme hard work is very important, hence the hard work and talent MB pulled
out of subprime and his determination to study two subjects at once, doctor and
Investor in the beginning.
Most people simply do not have the energy for this and time especially if they
have a family.

Madharry -
1. Berkshire Hathaway is still way undervalued.
I don't think so. based on P/B and PE (especially after the BNI merger) BRK
does not look extremely undervalued.

2. The expectation that stock market should return an average of 10% p.a. seems
ridiculous when the best capital allocator in the world only returned 11% if
one was fortunate to buy shares at a decade low.

I think WEB was predicting mid single digit returns for the stock market at
about that time.

 3. stocks during that 1998-2000 period were way overpriced.
No doubt here. most stocks were extremely overvalued but this thread did find
stock that were not.

 4. the efficient market hypothesis is bunk.
The efficient market hypothesis is one of the most faulty hypothesis about
investing that I am aware off. Amazing that so many people still follow that
teaching. it's sort of like Karl Marx theory in "Das Kapital" ; his prediction
about the future of society turned out to be vastly wrong but that di not
hinder the progression of his teachings for a long time.

Let me add on more:
5)The next Ten years won't be much better for the overall market but we will
continue to find value stocks to beat the index.

MD, I have seen a 10,000 hour interview and would agree with this concept
though would state extreme hard work, determination and focus upon subject,
will pay off in a certain time period depending on your learning curve.

To say this individual was wiling to put all his eggs in one basket I am not
sure about this being correct from my point of view, although the eggs were
mostly put into the CD contracts that is true.

If you take the subprime research that was performed this was quite incredible
amount of detail that was absorbed and enacted on.

The catalyst was pulled out that within 2 years on a certain group of mortgages
rates would jump from 6-11%, CDS contracts have fixed amount costs in this case
the first one was I believe $20,000 premium for Millions worth of insurance
(without looking at the article not sure how many millions, but many)
Catalyst: Non payment of certain class mortgages due to large coming increase
in interest rates on very high value RE.

Risk to Reward % very large

Risk factors would have been (among others as always), non payment of
insurance(eggs in one basket). I would like to hear his comment on the risk
side.

Some say that his Amex investment during the salad oil scandal counts as a big
gamble. People who are smarter than I have run through the numbers and made the
case that he was all in, and significantly leveraged.

As to whether this really was a gamble, the old W. C. Fields line does come to
mind:

I was not aware of this, thanks for giving the info. It was probably a rational
thing for him to do. Investing his own money may lead to less headaches than
investing someone else's. :)

He has posted some of his old investor letters at http://www.scioncapital.com/

Although I respect Mike and his investment prowess, I would not have been happy
with his investor letters if I had money in his fund. :) They are very opaque.
Apparently he tried to keep the concrete positions secret for whatever reason.

DCP looks indeed cheap with their 6B$ backlog. However 35% of its revenues are
from IRaq and another 26% from Afganistan. I seems to me there is quite a bit
of vulnerability to cuts there. there is also a fair amount of debt to service
(>2x EBITDA)

ES appears to get a 20% from stimulus but i wonder of course what happens if
this runs out.

That said, negatives for both seem reflected in the shares already, so i think
they are a reasonable bet.

does anyone know of a calculator that would indicate when its better to buy a
closed end fund or an etf? I would imagine that there should be a formula based
upon discount, and difference in annual fund expenses. for example does a 13%
discount justify a 1% annual cost as opposed to .5% for an etf? My guess would
be that if you are ahead for 5 years, you are better off buying the cef but
that is just off the top of my head. right now i own a cef thats at a discount
of over 30% to nav, but mgmt takes 2% cut of nav and on top of that as a
performance bonus 20% of all improvement after an 8% cutoff. so for me without
the bonus that equates to a fee of over 2.8% pa.

Based upon past experience in other countries,--and without passing

anticipates. It also seems that the security, stabilization, transition and

Yes, this is a great question. I think your formula primarily depends on how
long you plan to hold the cef. There's a big difference between holding it for
1 year vs. 10 years and the associated decision.

Now, to take this another step further, instead of holding 20-50 stocks, I tend
to take large positions in closed-end funds selling at a discount. Then, I buy
between 5 & 10 individual value stocks that I hope to double within the year.
So, my constant question is, should I continue to do this? Or should I expand
my stocks even though I'd have to go to less promising value stocks. Or does it
make more sense to continue the way I've been doing things. Decisions,
decisions...

your statement made my jaw drop open= 5-10 that you hope will double in a year?
That seems awfully hard to predict. My experience over 15 years of serious
investing tells me that you can either predict a short term price movement of
10-15% or so , or you can buy a deeply undervalued stock that you hope will
yield a large profit down the road. More often that not when i buy a deeply
undervalued stock it usually keeps going down before turning upward which puts
me in the awkward position of wondering whether i am committing more funds to a
dog, or is this just an incredible bargain that keeps getting better? I cant
remember the last time i found a deeply undervalued situation where i had any
confidence that i would double my money within one year. My own goal is to try
to return 16% a year I feel thats a lofty enough goal to shoot for. I guess I
should be bookmarking you. I'm willing to steal ideas from anyone.

Ha! :) Yes, well the operative word is 'hope' that the stocks would double
within a year. Do you think that if you wittled your stocks down to 5, you
could find 5 that you think could double in a year?

That being said, I've been keeping track of my portfolio performance since
11/28/2000. I haven't been a value investor this whole time, but in general
I've had at least 60% of my portfolio in cef's/mutual funds and 40% in stocks
attempting to double. I have had several double and several do poorly. I'm
beating the S&P/Dow/Nasdaq over that period, but not with a solid annual return
as the Index's are down over that period also. If I could do 16% a year, I
would be happy. I would hope to do that if the index's could go back to 10% a
year, but I haven't been able to do that so far. If your strategy is getting
you 16% a year over the same time period, I should be bookmarking you! :)

That question on closed end funds is one I have pondered myself.

To simplify, assume an IRA where there are no tax issues. If not for this
simplification, be concerned about any mutual fund throwing off capital gains
to be reported even when the price has dropped for the individual investor.

Then, again to simplify, assume an average rate of 10% return (dividends and
capital appreciation). So with a 13% discount, the fund earns that exta 1.3%
(10% x 13% discount), covering the 1% of costs. But if you assume a 5% return
for the market, then you need a 20% discount to cover 1% of management costs.

Looking at it this way I have rarely seen a CEF that makes sense. One that I
have on my watch list that may make it is ADX at 16% discount and fairly low
costs.

Now if you compare to actively managed mutual funds then CEF's might make more
sense, but I see no point in those. Either diversify yourself or get a low cost
ETF.

that is an excellent point. in the universe of funds that have ever existed i
wonder if that 10% roi is even realistic. or whether that number is generated
because of over optimistic investors who buy the highs and pessimistic investor
who sell at the lows. your distinguishing between taxable and non taxable
accounts is also worth investigating furthur. I am still trying to figure out
how to run my taxable portfolio. right now im tending toward a mix of berkshire
hathaway, mlps, qualified dividend payers, and berkshire like stocks that i
could hold for decades and borrow against to generate cash flow without having
to pay taxes. other wise between fed and state long term capital taxes in the
future will likely exceed 25%, which really puts the kabosh on extensive
portfolio turnover in my view.

 how to run my taxable portfolio. ... qualified dividend payers,

You are aware that qualified dividend tax reduction expires on Jan 1, 2011?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_tax

I would give about snowball's chance in hell for it to be extended.

Running taxable portfolio is hard. I used up all my cap loss carryovers from
2008 in 2009 taxes and so far 2010 is looking like another cap gain year - not
that I am complaining. ;)

Long-term cap gains face the same fate as dividends - the tax rates are going
UP UP UP in 2011 (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Increase_Prevention_and_Reconciliation_Act_of_
005 ), so I am pretty much taking all long term cap gains this year. The only
thing left for me in taxable portfolio is pretty much "berkshire like stocks".
The problem is that most of them become overvalued really fast (PEP, KO, BRK
itself) and then one has to choose: sell and pay taxes or hold for subpar
returns. :/

Decided I will up my risk exposure with HUM, and I upped my few shares a bit
more today.

HUM shows ten years of increasing book value. And imo, a relatively (to itself)
low p/e (8-9x).

Stock possibly beat down with Pres. Obama speech and concern over what will
happen to health insurers with any passage of health care reform.

ROE's averaged about 15% with profit margins 2-3%. ROE's up now to about 20%
(per Yahoo) which is about it's best year. I don't see from these numbers (15%
and 2-3%) where HUM is making outrageous amounts of profits, if that's what
politicians are claiming of insurers.

In a better market, this stock has traded for >2x book value. Now it's 1.4x.

I wouldn't call HUM a greatly undervalued stock: It's already moved up from
it's lows. I bought a few shares of HUM in '04, and added small in '05, '08,
'09. I figuring now (a little late perhaps -g-), that since I'm likely going to
hold on for a year or so more to see how things play out, that I ought to have
more than just a measly few shares. So now I have a few shares. -g-

(I'm trying to imply this stock will work for me, I hope. For others, with
different timeframes (patience levels), or analyses or goals or risk levels or
whatever, it may not.)

re CEG do you realize that WEB wanted to buy CEG for 4.7B$ when they almost run
the ship aground due to their trading business. Current market cap is 7.3B$.

What happened is that they got hit with credit downgrades, forcing them to post
collateral in the worst of the liquidity crisis in Sept 2008. this almost
tanked the company. WEB bailed them out and later retreated , for a high price
(breakup fee). So i don't think that management is all that great to put it
mildly and neither do I think they are stronger now than before.

Interesting how CEG purged their website with all press releases from this
ordeal.

There are quite a few good power company around - form a start I would look
into AYE (buyout offer from FE), PEG, EXC (think nu-cu-lar), NRG (The wild
bunch from Texas) for a start.

All these have somewhat capable management which is not something that I would
dare to say about CEG.
