 Any reason it went nowhere for last 4 years? . PVD's earnings were stagnating
from 2000 to 2003/4. one of the reason was that the pension fee were lowered
from 2.66% to 2.25% (they have stayed there for the last couple of years). I
also think that the recession has to do with it. Also PVD is majority owned
952%) by BBV and there is no institutional coverage.
I was buying the stock basically as dividend play almost a year ago, but then i
learned that there is potentially a growth story. think about it, the
contribution to pension plans for workers in Chile is mandatory. PVD is the
largest player (stable 33% market share with the lowest cost, per SEC filings).
They basically collect a fee from workers salary and their pension investment,
so if employment numbers are OK and salaries are rising and the Chilean stock
market is doing alright, PVD should be OK as well.

CKSW announced another contract win that includes a software license and
service agreement.

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060505/ukf005.html?.v=56

In addition to the six contract wins announced in the third and fourth quarter
of last year, CKSW announced wins with EON, the large European utility corp and
Chubb Insurance at the CC call. Yesterday's PR and at least two more wins that
have yet to be announced shows that this company is gaining traction in the
scheduling software space. One compelling factor driving contract wins is
greater productivity of workers and cutting the cost of transportation,
something that every compnay is focusing on with high gas prices. Forward
guidance by the company is at least fifteen percent top line growth in 06

Something that I look for in a stock like this is institutional support. With
the Special Situations fund and Acorn International being the top two holders
of the small-cap play, I feel more comfortable.

The company was cash flow positive last quarter and increased their cash
balance to 14 million dollars. They essentially have fifty cents a share in
cash, which isn't bad for a stock that is selling for 1.73. The company has
little to no debt. I added to my position in the first quarter and expect this
company to be trading above the 2.00 mark by the end of the year.

CKSW

Year-end: Cash and Short Term Investments:

03 11,089,000
04 11,729,000
05 13,800,000
First Quarter of 06: 14,000,000

From the first quarter PR:

"As of March 31, 2006, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short and
long-term investments of $14.0 million, up by $0.2 million from $13.8 million
as of December 31, 2005. Net cash provided from operating activities was $0.2
million during the first quarter of 2006."

I think it is best to view this company on a Q to Q basis as the positive
outlook for its products has improved due to increased cost of energy. This is
evidenced by the recently announced contract wins. I view the wins as the
leading indicator for future earnings. All contracts will include support
services revenue, which was up strongly in the first quarter. It should be
noted that the company has no goodwill or intangible assets. In terms of market
value, I think it is instructive to look at the price ARDI paid for Vidus, a
scheduling software competitor. I recently sold a majority of my shares in
ARDI. One reason--including the fact that ARDI is overvalued--was that Vidus
has only publicly announced one contract win. I continued to buy shares of CKSW
in the first quarter.

The company is a leader in its field and has alliances with IBM and SAP. I will
provide the quarterly updates for 06 so cash flow and balance sheet
improvements can be tracked. Disclosure: Long 1.58 per share.

The convergence of the 50, 100, and 200 day moving averages suggest that the SP
is building a base, which, because of the contract wins, I believe will result
in a breakout to the upside.

Well, gcrispin, thanx for your comments.

One can’t fault your numbers regarding CKSW’s Cash and Short Term Investments.
I have, however, to question the relevance of those numbers with regard to the
ongoing performance of the company.
Needless to say, it’s certainly far better to have cash then not have it, but
it’s a question of whether or not it should be sitting on the Balance Sheet
earning +/- 6% to 8%, or rather having been spent on the purchase or upgrading
of assets, an acquisition of a company to complement its business etc.. etc..
Maybe CKSW sees this cash as a "war chest" to do some acquiring in the future
.... we’ll have to wait and see.

You say it’s best to view this company on a Quarter to Quarter basis. I would
agree, but then isn’t this the basis on how one should view and analyse ANY
company, without exception. After all, on what other logical and factual basis
can one draw conclusions about the current Fundamentals of a company, other
than to regularly scrutinize its Financial Statements ?

The fact that CKSW has been successful with contract wins is good news. However
it’s now a question of whether or not the company can make decent Turnover AND
Profits from these contracts. But judging by its past financial performance
this may not be "a given".

CKSW lost money in 2001 and 2002. It managed a profit in 2003, but it went
backwards in 2004 and only managed to make 50% of its previous Bottom Line.
Things got worse in 2005 where its Bottom Line deteriorated to the tune of
–300%.

IMO CKSW’s problem area lies at the Turnover level. It’s just not currently
producing enough Revenue to compensate its ongoing increase in Cost of Sales
and Running Expenses. Hence my previous comments regarding the fact that it’s
losing money at the EBITDA level, and has a poor Return on Capital Employed.

The question now is, "Will CKSW be able to improve on its previous
performances, having obtained these new contracts ?"
As usual, its future Financial Results will answer that question. Anything
else, IMHO, is speculation.
And personally, I wouldn’t be buying its stock until such time as it confirmed
its ability to make ongoing Bottom Line profits and provided value for its
shareholders.

Thanks for your comments, bruin.

A couple of points:

Yes, I do speculate on the market. I try to back my speculations with
reasonable assumptions that I have made from trading over the last twenty-five
years. The types of stocks that I like are small to micro-caps, underfollowed,
at times, somewhat controversial. There is a higher risk/reward ratio with
these companies that I am willing to accept.

As much as you have correctly pointed out CKSW's checkered past, the reason I
emphasized Q to Q comparisons is because the company showed great progress with
first quarter results.

"For the first quarter ended March 31, 2006, total revenues were $6.5 million,
with a net loss of $161,000, or $0.01 per share. This compares with revenues of
$6.0 million and a net loss of $639,000, or $0.02 per share, for the same
period last year, and revenues of $5.9 million and a net loss of $740,000, or
$0.03 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding the effects of
share-based compensation expenses related to the adoption of SFAS-123R, net
loss this quarter was $64,000, or $0.00 cents per share."

Since SFAS-123R is a non-cash expense, the company basically broke even with a
loss of $64,000 or 0.00 cents a share, a great improvement with the reported Y
to Y and Q to Q comparisons. Since it was reported in the CC that their EON win
was not part of their current backlog, I am "speculating" that their quarterly
results for 06 will steadily improve.

I do agree with your comments that they must improve their turnover level.

Thanks for your analysis and good luck with your investments.

Good luck with your investments as well, gcrispin.

From what you say, CKSW appears to show improvement on its past loss making
record, albeit in the shorter term.
One hopes that this will continue over the longer term, and that they gain
maximum financial benefit from their latest contract wins.

Unlike yourself, I prefer not to ‘speculate’ on the Market. It comes, I guess,
from being risk averse !
My preference is to target companies that meet and exceed critical financial
target ratios and other specific criteria.
The better they do in this regard, the less the risk.

As long as they continue to do that, as measured by ongoing scrutiny of their
Financial Reports, experience has shown me that they continue to perform well.

the analysts however, since FFH barley made a cummulated profit during the last

it's quite low? Everything below A- is a problem for insurance companies since
it raises their cost of capital and deters customers.

Analysts dont seem to like bad news very much and there has been lots of bad
news surrounding this company of late. I read the COBs annual letter to
shareholders, which seemed pretty candid. He acknowledged that the company has
had seven very lean years as a result of digesting a couple of acquisitions as
well as sustaining huricane losses over the past two years. In addition the
company has been served by the SEC with regards to finite reinsurance stuff so
there is an ongoing investigation. On the other side a lot of value investors
have substantial positions here. So I though some regulars had reviewed this
thoroughly.

I followed somebody in to PVD today, and bought some L as well.

Since I have been posting quite a bit about edv in the past here I should
mention that I sold off close to 2/3s of my stake today when I read in a filing
that the management contract had been ammended, offering management a bigger
piece of the pie going forward. Details are in the edv thread.

I still hold a good size position but I have lost a great deal of confidence in
mgmt and am no longer willing to overweight them to the extent I did in the
past. Still I have to remember that its been a great ride and a very profitable

re FFH

Latest Note from Morningstar:

Analyst Note 04-27-2006

Fairfax Financial Holdings FFH on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings of
$9.10 per share, which was stronger than our expectations. Fairfax's results
were driven by the solid 96% combined ratio in its ongoing insurance operations
and $268 million of realized gains from its equity portfolio. The majority of
these gains are related to Fairfax's investment arm, Hamblin Watsa, deciding to
sell the remainder of its stake in California workers' compensation underwriter
Zenith National ZNT in early 2006. In addition, while Fairfax's run-off
(discontinued) operations produced positive earnings, they still required a
capital contribution of $83 million in the quarter. We're somewhat pleased by
Fairfax's overall results, but since we don't think they are sustainable
throughout 2006, we're holding our fair value estimate at $266 per share. We
continue to believe that Fairfax's underwriting profitability will modestly
deteriorate in the coming months and that its European run-off operation will
require at least $150 million of additional capital by the end of the year.
That said, given the recent sell-off of the shares, we continue to propound
that the margin of safety has increased to an extent that provides potential
investors with a very favorable risk/return scenario.

decent earnings report by DYSL - Dynasil this a.m.

Dynasil Announces Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2006 Results

Well Lazarus, it goes without saying that you can mention and say whatever you
wish to say on this thread (within the 'rules', of course !). It certainly has
nothing to do with me.

From a Fundamental point of view, I could see no current value in a company
such as PSCO. However, it may meet your own investment criteria.

I had a look at DYSL and it's certainly an improvement on PSCO ... at least
it's not currently Insolvent !
This is a relatively small company and not one I'd personally consider, until
such time as it had a bit more going for it.

According to my own criteria it's not a stock I'd currently invest in because
...
1)Its Operating Margin is too low.
2)Its pre-tax Return on Capital Employed is too low.
3)Its Debt/Equity ratio is too high, costing it relatively too much on its
Income Statement.

According to the comments in your attachment, DYSL’s fundamentals seem to be
improving. Therefore, IMO, it’s a stock which one should keep an eye on in case
its future financial results reverse the ratios in (1) to (3) above.

Welcome to the thread.

If I wanted a list of ALL stocks that pay dividends, I'd go to a screener
program. For US stocks I guess I'd start with maybe Kiplinger's (only because
I'm a little familiar with it):

http://www.kiplinger.com/personalfinance/tools/stockfinder/

There's also a dividend thread on Silicon Investor. You might ask there also.
------------
A different question would be what are the best dividend-paying stocks? The
answer depends on one's definition of "best", i.e how and to what extent to
rate consistency of dividend amount, dividend increases (dividend growth),
dividend yield, total return (dividend plus capital appreciation), risk, etc.

Fwiw, my latest dividend investing book is Mergent's "Dividend Achievers" (TM),
Winter 2006 edit. (Aside: And unusual for me, since I couldn't find a copy at
my library or used (like a good value investor might normally seek to do -
imo), I was "forced" to pay full price for the thing. -g-) These guys are
pretty proud of their record - their indices (picks) beating (by total return:
div.+cap. apprec.) the major averages. I didn't find any new stocks that I
bought as a result of going through their rankings or reading their reports on
individual companies; maybe I'll review the book again this weekend to see if
anything appeals. (I may have added to a position I already had based on their
recommendation, but I don't recall.)

i like the way the new management came in and made positive, decisive moves.

i like the the chart: http://tinyurl.com/lozn4

so - its a matter of whether or not im willing to risk some capital at these
levels or wait the company to mature further.

im comfortable here with the risk/reward.

all we can do is watch it for a couple of years and see how they do.

ill be honest with you - i dont know how to evaluate the complex financial

also a page that list earnings (estimate, actual and EPS for the year).

http://www.fulldisclosure.com/dividend.asp?client=cb

It's a good resource to use to scan those companies that will be paying their
quarterly dividend soon. You can then go to Yahoo Finance and look at more of
the company specific items. Yahoo finance is also good for viewing industry and
sector comparisons too.

The maximum Federal dividend tax rate of 15% was extended to 2010 yesterday by
Congress. Be sure that the dividend paid is "qualified".

Remember that your total return on any investment is the amount you eventually
keep after all your taxes are paid. A well managed portfolio has a steady
stream of dividend income. I am happy if I can achieve aa 10% total return year
in and year out. With this in mind, you portfolio will double every 7.2 years.

(OTCBB:OPCO - News): a growing designer, developer, producer, and marketer of
accessory and consumable pet products, today reported financial results for its
first quarter ended March 31, 2006.

Net revenues for the 2006 first quarter increased 33.8 percent to $2,107,441
from $1,574,959 in the same period a year ago. The recent Pet Zone acquisition
added $371,240 to sales in the 2006 first quarter. Gross margin as a percent of
sales for the 2006 first quarter declined slightly to 26.5 percent from 27.2
percent in the 2005 first quarter as a result of lower gross margins on certain
Pet Zone products. Net income for the 2006 first quarter increased 5.8 percent
to $55,619, from $52,556 in the 2005 first quarter. Earnings, before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), for the 2006 first quarter was
$178,213 compared to $136,194 for the 2005 first quarter.

Dr. Steven Tsengas, President and CEO stated, "We are very pleased with our
sales and earnings momentum going into the second quarter, even though net
revenues for the quarter were negatively impacted by mold delivery delays for
our Signature Series Feeder product line. In addition, revenues in the first
quarter were also affected by a product launch delay by a major retail
customer. We expect sales to accelerate in the second quarter as these delays
are now behind us. The Pet Zone acquisition is becoming more integrated into
the Company. During the quarter, there was a $55,292 expense for acquisition
charges, which going forward is expected to be minimal."

Dr. Tsengas concluded, "We are continuing to work on developing new innovative
pet products and believe we will end the year with over 250 products increasing
from 150 last year. We are encouraged with how the year is starting out and are
optimistic that 2006 will be another record year in terms of revenues and net
income."

OPCO : Apart from the CEO's "encouraging" comments, you may want to cast a
glance at OPCO's 10 fold increase of Long Term Debt on the Balance Sheet and
the effect it's having on its Income Statement, which is currently the
equivalent of 29% of its Operating Margin, and 62% (pre-tax) of its Bottom
Line.

And what if Mr. Bernanke continues to raise interest rates ?

fair enuf...

i dont know how to analyze a balance sheet and am not seeing what you are
seeing so i cant extrapolate the information.

i would say investing is something akin to the TV game Deal or No Deal where
the banker continually calculates the odds as the game progresses.

so --- my bottom line questions to you are:

1] what do you estimate are the odds of the company succeeding with its
business plans.

2] what would it be worth to pay for those odds - ie at what price would you
buy the stock?

Hi Lazarus. The way I see it, whether or not a company will succeed with its
business plan is, in my opinion, not a question one could answer with any great
degree of certainty.
However ... what one can do, with a far greater degree of certainty, is to
interrogate certain areas of that company’s Income Statement and Balance Sheet
and look for those signs/results/ratios etc.., which will tell us whether or
not a company is doing well and providing value for its shareholders.

To put it into a nutshell, so to speak, we interrogate seven specific areas
within those Financial Statements (of Industrial companies) and calculate eight
ratios which we then compare to set target percentages. If a company meets, or
exceeds ALL these targets, simultaneously, then it must be doing well,
financially .... and therefore, by inference, it’s very likely succeeding with
its "business plan".

In some way it could be seen as similar to your contention regarding "Deal" or
"No Deal". One is constantly monitoring a company’s published Financial results
and when those results reach a certain standard of Quality, the risk of losing
money becomes far smaller.

But that’s only the first of three steps in the process. The next one is
related to your second question regarding the price to pay for a stock. In this
regard we use the P/E ratio as our prime yardstick. In calculating the P/E we
remove any Extraordinary items which may appear in the Income Statement in
order to get a Bottom Line, and "E", which represents, as close as possible,
the normal running of the business.
It's a question of buying when the P/E shows the company's price to be
relatively cheap.

You can also, in fact, get a far more accurate idea of what a company’s P/E
should be if that company pays a Dividend. My good friend, Dr.Karl Posel,
combined finance with a bit of math and came up with a formula which helps in
that regard.

The third step in the process is to interrogate that short list of companies
which one has arrived at after the above screening process. Those couple of
companies which show the greatest potential for medium term price increase are
the ones we would consider buying.

The way we see it, it’s not a case of building a portfolio of dozens of stocks,
but rather to narrow it down to a far smaller number of really Quality
companies, which, needless to say, "don’t fall off trees" !
A good example, in this regard, has been HANS whose price has increased over
470% in the last 12 months.

At this stage, I wouldn’t know what price to pay for OPCO because, to be
brutally honest, I couldn’t care, seeing as its current Financials don’t meet
the required criteria, so it doesn’t pass first base !
However, that’s not to say that I wouldn’t be interested at some time in the
future, if OPCO’s numbers warranted it.

You say you don’t know how to analyse a Balance Sheet (and, I presume, an
Income Statement). Well, I’m sure the majority of Board members would probably
encourage you to learn the basics. It’s certainly not "rocket science" and it
will go a long way to assisting you in determining what to buy and, often more
importantly, what NOT to buy !

Well ... based on the "founding statement" of this Forum, I'd guess that it's
primarily populated by Value Investors who use Fundamental Analysis as the
basis for their stock analysis.

If you haven't, in any way, considered the current Fundamentals of NWC, it
would be interesting to know on what basis you have come to the conclusion that
it’s "good for 4 points on the upside" ?

I'm far more comfortable with the structure and content of the Income Statement
for Industrial type companies compared to those of Banks. I have my own views
with regard to the income streams of Banks and Financial Institutions and how
reliable these numbers are and what degree of risk they may contain.

Well ... the Yahoo article may be interesting, but, personally, I prefer to
interrogate the numbers for myself.

For one thing there's very little growth in NWS's Turnover. You can only do so
much to improve efficiency etc.. in the business, but ultimately you have to
have growth in Gross Turnover. MSFT is currently in the same boat, in this
regard (if you're one for reading articles you can check out page 54 in the May
15 edition of FORTUNE magazine).

Secondly, IMO, NWS is carrying too much debt, which is costing it too much on
its Income Statement. If it wasn't for this, it could have added another 30% to
its Bottom Line in its last Quarterly. I'm sure the shareholders would have
appreciated an addition to their dividend.

And finally, its low 6% pre-tax Return on Capital Employed is not, IMO,
anything "to write home about".

... and sorry about the "could be". Reading it again, it could have relevance.

bruwin, i admit im not that savy when it comes to the financial statements. im
totally lost with big caps and ok with micro-caps provided they dont have
preferreds or cds.

here is why i originally bot the stock:

they have a good distribution channel:
http://www.ourpets.com/wheretobuy.html

which expanded with the aquisition of PETZONE

also in a previous press release they stated:

OurPet's also announced that it has begun plans expand its facility from 28,000
square feet to approximately 60,000 square feet to accommodate the Pet Zone
acquisition and provide for anticipated growth over the next few years.

which indicates to me that they are serious about growing this business

and earlier this year they made an addition to the BOD:

Mr. James D. Ireland, Chairman and Managing Director of
Capital One Partners and Early Stage Partners (www.esplp.com),
Cleveland-based private equity investment firms that
specialize in early stage and middle market companies. Mr.
Ireland has served as Chairman of Pet Zone and is a director
of Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF - News) and other private-held
companies funded by Capital One and Early Stage Partners.
Prior to founding Capital One and Early Stage Partners in
1993, he served as Vice President in the Corporate Finance
Department of Salomon Brothers, Inc. and partner or managing
director of several investment firms. Mr. Ireland is actively
involved with numerous civic activities, including serving as
President of The Cleveland Orchestra.

Cleveland-Cliffs was rated by Forbes as being among Americas Best Big
Companies.

i like what i see in terms of a small company aligning itself for future growth
and i like to be invested in these companies when they are defining themselves
so that if i am correct in my assesment i can ride them from pennies to
dollars.

Yes Lazarus, from what one reads in your thread, one could certainly be
encouraged about the possible future potential of OPCO, as a business.
And I’m sure you’re also comfortable with your own investment strategy, which
is as it should be. Although I would always encourage folk to be on the lookout
for any other aspect of stock analysis which may enhance their existing
investment strategy.

From my own perspective, I’ll just throw two sayings into the arena, viz. (1)
"the proof of the pudding is in the eating", and (2) "there’s many a slip
between cup and lip" !

By that I mean I’d personally rather wait and see the success, OR OTHERWISE, of
OPCO’s business and management plan manifest itself in the future numbers that
appear in their Financial Statements, i.e. (1) above.
Because one can often read "glowing reports", "encouraging Analyst’s comments"
etc.. etc.. which don’t always come up to expectations in the longer term, and
fail to produce ongoing profits and value for shareholders, i.e. (2) above.

However, that may not be the case with OPCO. And if it isn’t, those who got in
early, as I presume you have, should benefit more than the more cautious
individuals such as myself.
In the "grand scheme of things" it’s often about one’s appetite for Risk.

Bought some more EBAY and a position in MXIM. Both are at reasonable valuations
for a GAAP investor, IMO. MXIM's earnings are depressed by hefty option grants

one needs to keep in mind that current accounting overstates the economic

Hi Paul Senior - I nibbled at a few shares of Home Depot. Their PE is low at
13. Management has positioned the company quite well to become more efficient
with several of their recent company purchases. Their same store "retail" sales
may not grow as fast in the past but I believe many of their service businesses
will make up the difference.

I recently had Home Depot install a new furnace, filtration and air condition
system in my home. The install was out sourced to a small local company and the
job was done very professionally at a very competitive price (HD was the low
bidder on the three quotes I obtained).

I will add more shares on any further sell off.

Are their any other home improvement companies on your value list? Much of the
current housing stock is aging and will need to be remodeled or upgraded soon.
My old furnace (22 years old) still worked but was inefficient. I believe in
preventive maintenance.

Got some for my Mom's account a couple months back. On my own account, had a

thanks paul, MPW has been a nice gainer and i think it has a long way to go on
the upside...i was at a presentation they gave at the vegas money show on
tuesday, and spoke to the CFO during and after that talk...i'm now even more
confident of this company/stock, and the dividend increase is further
confirmation of their progress

the way MPW trades, i would guess you will be able to buy it around 11 or a bit
lower in the next few weeks, or perhaps .25 lower than that after it goes ex
dividend...each time it looks like it is ready to take off, it seems to pull
back before moving higher again...i certainly wouldn't chase it based on its
past trading pattern, though of course you never know when it could just take
off and keep going

one further item to watch for, they have a loan to a company called vibra which
totals about 40M at this point...due to various agreements surrounding that
loan, the effective yield on that money to MPW is about 23%...it is to vibra's
advantage to pay that loan off as quickly as possible, and MPW has been
expecting vibra to pay off part of that loan at some point in the near
future...when that happens, MPW will earn less going forward on the repaid
money, as they will reinvest it into one of their other projects, which
normally start out earning a yield of around 10.3%...as such, it may cause them
to adjust their FFO for 2006 from the current 1.15 or so down to perhaps 1.05
(my guess, they haven't given a number for this since they don't know if or
when the loan will be partially or fully prepaid)...obviously the more time
that passes before this prepayment is made, the less it will affect 2006 FFO,
and there is always the chance they will make up the difference from other
projects anyway

in any event, when they release the news that vibra has made a partial
prepayment on that loan, the stock may dip due to uninformed sellers, and that
may be a chance to buy or add as well...clearly i don't see it as a long term
issue, and it won't be a surprise to anyone who has followed the company's
progress, as they note it in every presentation they make, and along with any
guidance they give, but news like this always seems to shake out the
uninformed, and provide an opportunity for the well informed, so there's a good
chance it will do the same this time

ITU trades at 4x book value. It is very profitable (35% ROE) which I don't

3%+ ROA will be gone. What I like about BCH is that Chile as a country and BCH

A bit unrelated, but my take is that there is an unquantifiable risk to

below, reducing the "high commissions" will be part of the reform they will be
seeking.

"It's not at all clear, however, that Bachelet is willing to break with the

strategy--the Washington Consensus--to a new model of development," says
economist Manuel Riesco of the Center of National Studies for Alternative
Development. "We have to wait and see if Bachelet also takes steps in that
direction, but at least the composition of her cabinet doesn't indicate any
changes in that regard. The cabinet seems to reflect continuity of the previous
Concertaci&#243;n governments." Indeed, an unexpectedly high number of new
ministers (seven of twenty) come from the most conservative wing of her
coalition. Economics minister Ingrid Antonijevic is a favorite of the
ultraconservative associations of bankers and industrialists.

One of Bachelet's immediate challenges is to reform the pension fund system,
privatized by Pinochet in 1981. Among the system's many faults is that while
the companies that invest workers' contributions in the stock market (and
charge extraordinarily high commissions) are making record profits, about
three-fourths of retirees now receive less than the minimum monthly pension of
$140. Bachelet's response: a plan to appoint a commission charged with drawing
up a reform bill. "Pension reform will seek to improve the system, not replace
it," is how Bachelet's official program puts it."

LOW vs. HD.

I've not been able to discern if they're zero sum competitors, i.e. if LOW's
gain is HD's loss or vice versa. At one point HD chairman said there was room
for growth for both companies, Lowes' growth was not HD's loss, and that they'd
both grow by taking business from mom-n-pop hardware stores. Recently there may
be a shift in HD business emphasis from retail to professional contractors and
to service/installation. HD has made some small acquisitions for that.

I've bought HD. In retrospect, LOW would've been the better buy - it's had the
better stock performance.

I'm not a follower of PEG numbers, and I've no opinion on growth prospects
(sales and/or earnings estimates) for one company vs. the other.
Compared to LOW, HD has the lower p/e, the lower p/sales, the lower p/book, the
higher profit margins. Given those metrics, I like HD better. There's been
insider sales though, with some reported by Warren Buffett recently. That's
somewhat disconcerting to me, esp. since his partner, C. Munger, was or is on
HD's BOD.

i've found PEG to be a very useful metric in terms of evaluating long term
expectations for an investment, especially in terms of comparing two companies
to determine which one i would rather own for the long term

simply put, if company A is trading at 10x earnings and growing at 10% a year,
it is reasonable to expect that a year from now, the stock price will be 10%
higher...if company B is trading at 12x earnings, but growing their earnings at
15% a year, it is reasonable to expect that the stock price will be 15% higher
in a year, since the higher growth warrants the stock continuing to trade at
the higher multiple

extrapolating this to 5 years of performance has company A's stock trading 61%
higher while company B's stock will have more than doubled

as such, whereas company A may appear more attractive at the current time based
on a lower P/E ratio (and perhaps lower P/B, P/S, etc), company B's growth
makes it a far superior long term investment

it's great to pay a low multiple of sales, earnings, book, etc., but the main
thing that drives the price of a company's stock higher is the growth of their
revenues and earnings, so leaving growth out of the equation would seem to be a
huge disadvantage in analysis

Isn't that basically what Munger taught Buffet? And it ain't so easy to teach
Warren much.....

Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA:NYSE - commentary -
research - Cramer's Take), revealed a 17.9 million-share stake in
ConocoPhillips (COP:NYSE - commentary - research - Cramer's Take) in its
quarterly regulatory filing on Monday. The investment comes from the world's
preeminent value investor, even after shares of the oil company have rocketed
13% so far this year, after adding a whopping 52% last year.

"I doubt that [Buffett] thinks ConocoPhillips is a screamingly cheap company,"
says Glenn Tongue, managing partner with T2 Partners. "He probably thinks it's
a predictable asset-rich company that will grow in value far in excess of what
his costs of financing are. That rationale goes along with some of Berkshire's
previous investments like Wal-Mart (WMT:NYSE - commentary - research - Cramer's
Take) and Wells Fargo (WFC:NYSE - commentary - research - Cramer's Take)."

The issue for investors about HD and LOW as regards growth, is: who is
predicting what those growth rates are and what is his/her record for
predictions? (or their records - plural - if you're using consensus estimates.)
I'll give anybody the point that using financial records is using historical
stuff, and the way I often use them (current numbers compared to past) is
subject to too much rear-view mirror investing. OTOH, extrapolating growth
rates five years out has its problems too.

Buffett may pay up for growth, but I don't see where he quantifies it. (Perhaps
he has or does though.) Having a moat which will deliver "enough" growth with
"enough" assurance is perhaps good enough for him.

Perhaps he actually might like LOW better than HD because LOW has greater
growth potential (if it really does), but he is trapped into his HD position
because of Mr. Munger's involvement with HD. Perhaps either company has good
enough growth at current p/e, etc. to be worth a buy. Perhaps if homebuilders
drop more, housing prices fall, and economy heads to recession then neither
company is a buy now.

Somewhere in here is another issue for investors regarding growth. It is the
always-to-be-asked question: "How long are you in for?" Perhaps HD and LOW will
both do okay vis-a-vis the market or other large-caps if one buys now and holds
for five or more years.

Positive article in this week's Barron's on Yahoo.

This is one of those stocks that to call it a 'value' stock you have to have
some specifics in your definition of value. I make a case for it for me based
on profit margins and sales growth rates vs. price paid for what you get. Those
who are more classical will disagree about basing purchases on these metrics
and/or prices to be paid.

As regards YHOO, there aren't that many giant internet companies that are also
profitable. The risk is that they are dominant in their sector now, but the
history of technology leads one to believe upstarts come in to decimate them.
I'm assuming these companies' size and financial strength will carry them
through. Perhaps an assumption not supported by facts.

I picked up some of these stocks in the past few months as they hit near lows.
I'm still in: YHOO, GOOG, EBAY. I'll include IACI here. One I've not come to
any conclusion on is AMZN.

I'm intending to add more YHOO to my few shares once the Barron's effect
dissipates, if it does.

Hi Carl - There are two specific reasons I have bought into Home Depot. Their
(1) real estate holdings and (2) their new revenue streams from their service
businesses. I have not done the equivalent analysis for LOW but I believe there
are more hidden low cost assets available in HD.

The following is a dated article from 2003 but is still relevant for my HD
analysis.

http://www.buildings.com/Articles/detail.asp?ArticleID=1525

Notice the ranking of the real estate holdings for the companies listed. Look
at those companies that have (1) deleveraged their assets (i.e. JC Penny
selling their drug division), (2) have been bought out or merged w/ other
companies (Sears merger w/ K-Mart) and (3) have been sold or split into pieces
(ABS real estate sold and prime assets merged w/ SuperValue).

Other than Walmart, Home Depot is the only company on the list that is still
growing their businesses, adding new sources of revenue streams through retail
and wholesale services and have invested billions of dollars acquiring vertical
business enterprises that make their entire operation more efficient.

Low's growth comes from expanding stores and increasing their same store sales.
HD's management stated that their business model going forward will not have
ever increasing same store sales but expect new stores to be marginally more
profitable but combined w/ older stores their growth rate s/b in the low teens.

HD's business plan is to make their operations more efficient and generate a
better operating margin for all sales. New revenue streams are also being added
through Services (which includes carpet care, installation of flooring,
furnace, roof, kitchen & bath remodeling etc.). From a conference call last
week, HD should generate 10% of their revenues from these new services (it's
growing from less than 1% a few years back).

As a value investor, the biggest hidden asset is in their real estate that HD
has acquired over the last 30 years. It's similar to Sears but twenty years
later. HD has also been integrating their efficient distribution system with
their Internet offering. You can order specialty items and have them delivered
to your nearest HD store location at no additional shipping fee to the
customer.

I had a Cherry door manufactured in Costa Rica and shipped to my local Home
Depot at wholesale w/ no additional shipping fee. All the other quotes I
obtained were 20% higher in price plus charged a $300 shipping fee.

My point is that both LOW and HD are very efficient "retail/wholesale"
distribution companies and with their buying power (and HD's vertically owned
companies) can beat any U.S. manufacturer on customer service and price. This
competitive advantage is not reflective in either the PEG, PE or P/S ratio.

Therefore, I believe both companies are probably good investments but I like HD
better for the reasons stated above.

From:Carl Worth
i'm certainly not one to put a whole lot of faith in analysts, but given the
performance of the two companies over the past many years, the fact that LOW
has a smaller store base and thus can grow more rapidly by percentage even if
they only add the same number of stores as HD does, and the fact that the
companies themselves are guiding to numbers that show superior growth for LOW
over HD, it would appear that it's reasonable to believe the estimates that
show greater growth for LOW than HD

if the whole sector turns down, it will affect both companies, and the P/B, P/S
and other ratios are not sufficiently different to make HD a better play in
that scenario, so i don't think that is material to a comparison

i find it hard to imagine that mr. buffett is ever "trapped" into any
investment...i'm quite sure that if he decided he didn't want to own the stock
anymore, and sold it, mr. munger would still be his friend <g>

i agree that HD has the better potential for "hidden assets," but i wonder if
that will do much for the stock price in the short to intermediate term

with real estate out of favor at the current time, it would seem to me to be
less likely that investors will be looking for asset plays with hidden value in
real estate, such as they were over the past few years, so while that asset may
be there, it may continue to go unrecognized for quite a while

it's not that i think HD is a bad investment, the original thesis of what i
posted was simply to compare it to LOW, and i think it has generated a good
discussion, which is always beneficial on these boards

Have you looked at GAIN as well as GLAD (I gather they are related companies as
both carry the GLadstone name)? GAIN is trading at slightly less than book
value and only had about 1/4 of their capital deployed in BDC type loans at the
last report (I'm going from memory so I may be off).

Adrian Day's assessment was that " (GAIN) is less conservative than GLAD, but
has much more appreciation potential.

mr. gladstone spoke at the vegas money show and i was quite impressed with his

i would agree that GAIN has the best potential for appreciation as well as
dividend increases from here, since it is the newest and as you noted, has only
deployed about 1/2 of its capital as of the presentation the other day

one further advantage of GAIN is that it often has an equity position in the
companies in its portfolio, so if and when they are bought out or taken public,
it benefits from that as well

FWIW I turned around and sold my position in yahoo. Its probably silly but I
hate being involved in a company where the ceo sells millions of dollars worth
of shares. Also as a consumer their current internet search engine i find to be
useless compared to that of google.
Of course I seem to have just made several wrong decisions in a row so its
probably a strong buy now. I also repurchased shares that I sold in qee (.37)
at higher levels. At the time I made my initial purchase around .18 I said that
the play was long term option on the price of gold. With gold over $600 this in
my estimation is a value /concept stock. This company has an operational mine
in Nevada with a mill. Its a producer ! On top of that NEM recently made a
$10MM private investment in the company and is sending them stuff to mill which
should improve operating margins. I expect the Mongolian mining bill to be
vetoed and that should help IVN. I added Cresy on the drop yesteday. Another
long term hold. I also added a little ME.
I am just astounded that copper shares have fallen as much as they have. Most
of the feasibility studies for mines are done with copper at about half today's
levels anyway. In that space
I own NTO arg.to tgb ivn. all of which have been crushed. My stance continues

Argh. Seems like Greenblatt's record gets better and better with every report.
Come on now, 40% CAGR sustained over 20 years? That percentage would be what,
about twice as good as W. Buffett? And with the compound effect, enormously
better. I've read media reports about Greenblatt that say 20%. No
documentation, no quoted source, no audit reports - and imo without supporting
facts, it's just hype in my opinion.

Still, I'm a fan of the methodology. There's a Greenblatt's Little Book thread
on SI where there's been a discussion and/or links to pro's and con's and
definitions (i.e. regarding return on capital, how is it calculated and how
should it be defined?).

----
As regards the stocks on the current list, fwiw, I just today sold a little NSS
bought 9/'04; I like refiners and recently (oops)started an exploratory
position in refiner FTO; I still have KSWS on my watch list and am considering
a small buy; I'm holding shares of EGY since it was mentioned here in '05; I
too(like several others here or on Buffett thread) am holding AEOS. I like
cosmetic surgery stocks, and I have a small exploratory position in ELOS, down
now about 29% since mentioned here in January; I have a tiny stub of Earthlink
(ELNK) which has gone up and down over the past few years.

An issue with Greenblatt's screen (or maybe any list of this type) is that
sometimes the financial data for a company are not current or there are special
circumstances (e.g. non-recurring events) which when discovered or realized by
the investigator, actually make the stock an obvious non-candidate for
purchase.

I read with interest, Paul, your comments regarding Greenblatt’s investment
theory and methodology.
You say you’re a "fan of the methodology". This doesn’t surprise me, especially
when one of the criteria is based on Return on Capital (pre-tax, I might add
!).

There has been a fair amount of discussion on Greenblatt’s Little Book thread
regarding 'definitions' etc.. I took part in several of them. However, I would
suggest to others "not to sweat the details" or get too involved in the nitty
gritty of Capital definitions et al ... From our experience it doesn’t make
that much of a difference. A basic calculation of Capital Employed will
generally suffice.

You say you’re sceptical of a sustainable 40% return that apparently was
achieved over a 20 year period.
Well, I might also be inclined to see it that way. Not because I don’t think it
can be done, but because the way I see it, Greenblatt does not target a
sufficient number of criteria and financial ratios within a company’s Financial
Statements. We also regard the ratio of Pre-tax Income to Capital Employed as
one of the most important ratios to consider. However, in our opinion, this
must be combined with a consideration of other relevant aspects in order to get
a far more complete picture of the Financial State of an Industrial company.

If a company can SIMULTANEOUSLY satisfy ALL these criteria, then it’s very
likely that it’s currently making consistent profits and providing value for
its shareholders.
And, needless to say, if it’s doing that then it will attract informed
investors, create demand for its stock, and provide above average Capital gain.

You make a very valid point with regard to "non-recurring events" in the Income
Statement. In our opinion this has to be excluded if one wants to get a far
more comprehensive answer regarding the nature of its Bottom Line earnings
relative to the general, day-to-day business activity of the company.
In my part of the world, the Stock Exchange requires that companies report not
only Earnings Per Share (EPS), but also, what they refer to as, Headline
Earnings Per Share (HEPS). This latter number excludes Extra-Ordinary Items in
the Income Statement such as a once-off sale of an asset etc.., which can
distort the Bottom Line.

E_K_S expressed surprise that a component of the formula was to regularly sell
your group of stocks every year and re-invest in the new top 25 companies.
Personally I’m surprised that one would have as many as 25 "top companies" in a
portfolio !
By having a comprehensive list of Fundamental criteria by which to assess
companies, and incorporating a target percentage for the majority of these
criteria, the nature of this process is such that the list of "top companies"
is more likely to be 6 to 10 rather than 25 or more.

The way we see it, there’s no real reason to sell as long as the company
continues to meet the required criteria and no better opportunity presents
itself.
Therefore it doesn’t surprise me that some of E_K_S’s best gains have been
derived from stocks he held for extended periods of time.
