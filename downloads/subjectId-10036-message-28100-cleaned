Interesting, but that is only a short-term trading opportunity for NFI, not a
reason for a value investment IMO.

More relevant would be an in-depth discussion on the (1) prospects for NFI's
ability to originate loans in current environment and more importantly (2) the
degradation of the collateral on their books in light of continued expected
weakness in housing/lending market and large number of ARM resets coming up and
(3) ability to stay solvent.

Here is an excerpt from a recent press release:
In view of the impacts to the Company, Deloitte & Touche LLP, NovaStar's
independent auditors, advised NovaStar in the last week of August 2007 that it
was not willing to issue a consent or otherwise be associated with the rights
offering unless the Company reissued its 2006 financial statements to include
footnote disclosures regarding these matters. In addition, Deloitte further
advised NovaStar that its reissued report on such financial statements would
include an explanatory paragraph about the uncertainty of NovaStar's ability to
continue as a "going concern".

So we have "going concern" issues. A mortgage-savvy investor might be able to
make a lot of money on this, but I don't think my idol Benjamin Graham would
touch it with a 10 foot pole. Please let me know where you disagree with my
points above.

Best,
MC

Insurers,

Junglekings et al. SUAI, SAFT, NAHC all look interesting to me. NAHC is in a
niche market and has an shaky history, so I have been buying/selling that one
at much lower price-to-book ratios than the others. SAFT seems better managed
to me (with a nice buyback and yield), so I would buy and sell it at a premium
to the others.

I am concerned about exposure to Alt-A and subprime paper (though these
companies mostly claim low exposure to subprime) and increasing competition.
However, I have tended to do well buying sound and profitable financial
companies near or below book values.

I must admit however that I wish I were better versed in the insurance
business.

By the way, PTA is another possibility for the strong of heart. They were
delisted due to delays in SEC financial filings but are trading well below book
and hopefully will be relisted. Their is definitely hair on that one, though.

From the falling knife file...unloved, oversold, and with management that has
generated spotty results, to be generous.

As a contrarian play, DDS is IMHO one of the best ideas presented to this
thread in the large to mid cap space in quite a while. To be able to acquire
this one at .6 BV presents an attractive entry point. I have not done anything
resembling extensive due diligence, but DDS has been around a long time, and
the stated BV is most likely the real deal, and might be understated (as Paul
mentioned, I also seem to recall some talk of this).
SSS are poor and inventories are up, and that may pressure results in the near

management to maximize shareholder value.

Pcyhuang,

One of my pet peeves is people who post their ideas, but then don't really
listen or respond to others. These boards should be about dialog IMO.

You didn't respond to my points or to Wallace Rivers. Since you raised NFI on
this board to begin with, I think you should consider doing so. Referring us to
you contrarian board is not as helpful to me unless you can refer to specific
links that responds to my points.

I do see on your board a link showing that NFI paper has been performing better
than some of the other subprime paper issuers. That is good to know, but will
that continue? Defaults moved up from 2.62% in July to 4.41% in August.
How about the fact that the current NFI loan balances are now greater than the
original loan balance (option arms???, higher future defaults???).

Also, could NFI be subject to margin calls and a liquidity crunch even if its
loans are not that bad? That is what happened to AHM. What about the fact that
the auditors question whether it will be a "going concern." For a stock like
this, this kind of fundamental analysis is much important than technical
indicators IMO.

Best of luck,
MC

PS: Looks like NFI is down 10-20% aftermarket on loss of REIT status. Pure
coincidence, but just another example of why this stock is too risky for my
blood.

4:01PM Novastar Fin will not distribute REIT dividend after market changes make
new issue of preferred securities not possible (NFI) 8.20 +0.10 : Co announces
it will not proceed with declaring a dividend dividend on its common stock, as
previously planned. NovaStar announced on July 16 that it intended to declare a
dividend on its common stock, in the form of convertible preferred securities,
to satisfy requirements to distribute approximately $157 million in 2006
taxable income to preserve its status as a Real Estate Investment Trust under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. NovaStar said the decision not to declare a
dividend related to 2006 taxable income will cause the Company's REIT status to
be terminated, retroactive to January 1, 2006. As a result, NovaStar said it
will file a consolidated tax return for the 2006 tax year today, in a timely
manner, as a general C Corporation rather than as a REIT. The Company also will
file a request for extension of time to pay its 2006 C Corporation tax
liability, which is statutorily allowed under the Code. NovaStar said it
expects that the termination of its REIT status for the 2006 tax year will have
a significant adverse impact on its financial statements for the third quarter
of 2007, which will include a period expense in the third quarter for the 2006
tax provision. As a result of NovaStar's change in corporate structure, the
Company is currently reviewing the applicable New York Stock Exchange listing
requirements and is engaged in continuing discussions with the NYSE.

Corporation rather than as a REIT.

EKS: Payment of a dividend on the common was never in the Company's best
interests. Now it will pay a little interest to the IRS and move forward with
its capital structure intact.

Yes, the Company will have to book a large provision for 2006 income taxes in
the third quarter of 2007 since the liability was not previously recorded under
the REIT structure. But not to worry, because that 2006 tax liability will be
offset dollar-for-dollar by the benefit of carrying back the 2007 NOL. I
believe there's no reason that the 2007 tax benefit cannot also be recorded in
the tirrd quarter since they should have a pretty good handle on the 2007 NOL
by now.

Since NFI is retroactively a "C" corp., the NFI charter provision preventing
anyone from acquiring over 10% of the company is no longer valid.

The value of the cash flow from the portfolio, after deducting taxes,
judgements, and other writeoffs should still exceed $25 per share, and MM/J
does not have enough shares to block a takeover.

AAV. valueminded> They have cut the dividend(distribution), and the stock
trades on the high dividend yield (imo). I don't have any other Canroys that I
know that have cut, so AAV seems unusual to me, and the suspicion-and-danger
meter lights up.

After the dividend cut of last year, I waited to see if further AAV bad news
was forthcoming. None that I see. See some disgruntled AAV posters on Yahoo
though.

Looks like one or more others here also have this stock, but as part of a
package of Canroys they hold. That's me as well.
For me with this one, okay maybe for a small bet, but only a small bet at this
time.

Edit: Correction: holding couple of driller/service Canadian trusts (different
from AAV which is an oil/gasser), and they have cut their distributions too,
e.g. PDS. Not sure whether such stocks are correctly called Canroys, although
they are trusts and taxed similiarly to AAV, others. Afaik.
I have expected these service stocks to possibly cut as gas drilling/servicing
has slowed in Canada. I've not expected "regular" Canroys to cut. Just based on
an uninformed opinion. A guess. No facts.
And I've been wrong many, many times.

>traditional value matrices" would be the way to go.

Mark:

The quote you cited: "Since many value stocks are trading near their 52-wk
lows, we need to add certain matrices, other than the traditional value ones,
in finding the right candidates to be the truly big winners. (The bold letters
are intentionally added). Please also note that I have nothing against the
traditional value matrices, but I am only suggesting the addition of several
other ones at this juncture of the market cycle.

One process that is useful in identifying such potentially big winners is to
ask yourself "how is this stock unique versus its peers?"

For example, NFI's unique qualities include the following:

1. It is the only company in the depressed mortgage industry that has done a
4:1 reverse split. So a put with a strike price at $10 is really a put on
pre-split NFI at $2.50.

2. More than 90% of NFI's float has been sold short by the pessimistic players.

3. NFI has been on the NYSE "Threshold Securities" list for more than 30
consecutive days. Starting Oct. 15, the SEC's new regulations dealing with
"Threshold Securities" will cause a forced covering of all such naked short
sales.

4. NFI is backed by the Wachovia Bank and Massachusetts Financial.

5. In recent sessions, the trading volume of NFI ranges between 10 - 20% of the
total number of share outstanding.
This type of heavy turnover usually signify some important developments.

Thinking about the uniqueness of a situation would allow the investor to limit
the number of issues in his portfolio without bulging into hundreds or even
thousands of issues.
The overly large number of issues in a portfolio will just result in mediocre
performance.

Wallace: The significance of a reverse split is that it increases the beta
value of a stock. In the case of NFI, instead of the pre-split 38 million
shares outstanding, it now has only 9.5 million shares. This fewer number of
shares outstanding puts the pressure on the short sellers, and it increases the
potential upside volatility of the stock.

>what price target you might have on NFI

Wallace:

The short sellers and other media bashers have predicted that NFI's downside is
zero.

However, there is also a realistic upside should NFI survive which I think is
extremely likely as recent events on the company unfold. I believe that it is
realistic to believe that NFI, in a better operating environment, can make at
least 25% of its 2006 profits. We already know that 2006 profits were
approximately $5.50 per share pre-split. Post split, that equates to $22 a
share. So on extrapolation, I seriously believe the new NFI has the potential
to make $5.50 a share again, but on the new float of 10M shares which would
have been $1.38 on the former float of 40M shares.

Assigning a conservative multiple of 6x - 8x earnings, we reach an estimated
potential valuation of $34 to $44 per share. This is not a pipe-dream but a
very realistic estimate based on historical performance. With a further slight
expansion of the multiple or earnings, or both, we have a potential 10 bagger.

Now let us put this in terms of the odds of playing a hand of black jack. You
have a 11 count and the dealer has a face card up. The odds are slightly in
your favor to double down for a single hit. The difference here is that the
case of NFI could be a 10 bagger instead of just a simple double.

What's the basis for determining that the Wachovia action solved the going
concern issues? It would appear to resolve only the "additional concern" bolded
below. Deloitte references several other items as well. And, if I read the Sept
4th release correctly, Deloitte said that anything they signed off on would
have to have the going concern footnote. I don't see how anyone can say with
confidence that this has changed.

From the 8-k:

As disclosed in NovaStar's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007,
several conditions and events have adversely impacted the subprime mortgage
industry and NovaStar's operations, liquidity and financial condition during
2007. Subsequent to the filing of that report additional events have also
occurred which further impacted NovaStar's operations, liquidity and financial
condition. For example, as previously disclosed, Moody's Investor Services
downgraded NovaStar Mortgage, Inc.'s servicer quality rating and additional
concerns have developed about NovaStar's ability to remain in compliance with
certain covenants contained in its financing agreements. Further, on August 20,
2007, motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial were
denied in the previously disclosed California case in which NovaStar's
subsidiary, NovaStar Home Mortgage, Inc., had a $46.1 million judgment entered
against it. Further, due to the overall deterioration in the subprime mortgage
industry and the secondary capital markets for subprime mortgage loans during
2007 NovaStar made the decision to suspend its wholesale originations and
curtail its retail originations to preserve liquidity.

In view of the impact to the Company of the items discussed above, Deloitte &
Touche LLP, NovaStar's independent auditors ("Deloitte"), advised NovaStar in
the last week of August 2007 that it was not willing to issue a consent or
otherwise be associated with the rights offering unless the Company reissued
its 2006 financial statements to include footnote disclosures regarding these
matters. In addition, Deloitte further advised NovaStar that its reissued

Paul, AAV is 75% NG and NG prices are low right now in in particular in Canada.
They only made 0.04 Can$ last quarter which is way more than the dividend. This
means that the 15% dividend is mostly a return of capital in my opinion- With
Oil&Gas companies most of the cash flow needs to flow back into operations to
keep reserves constant and what AAV is fueling back is not enough. So
reserves/share are shrinking which is why AAV resorted to an acquisition. This
does not help NAV/share but is does keep management employed.

I don't mean to pick on NFI so much. They are best of breed. Most of their

you're looking to win a stock picking contest, NFI is a good pick. If you're
looking for positive risk-adjusted returns not so much IMO. That said I bought
some (a small amount) of the preffered yesterday (as suspending the dividend
doesn't really hurt the prefered IMO it shouldn't have been down a larger
percent than the common early yesterday). But there isn't much margin for error

Looking for a bounce, yesterday I started positions in AIB and IRE. The selling

FT.com snip: 

Emer Lang, analyst with Davy, the largest independent broker, says AIB, Bank of
Ireland and Anglo Irish bank depend less on wholesale funding for their lending
book than other European banks.

For AIB the figure is around 44 per cent, Bank of Ireland 46 per cent and Anglo
36 per cent. Irish Life & Permanent is the only institution that appears out of
step, with two-thirds of its loan book funded by wholesale lending.

This compares with 50 per cent at French banks, an average of 66 per cent for
German banks and 45 per cent for UK banks, according to DBRS rating agency.

Paul, I nibbled at a starter position in AAV. This is for the IRA account as I
am seeking income. First, I believe natural gas prices are low relative to the
current price of oil. NG prices should move higher over time as large consumers
switch from heating oil and coal to NG. Second, The benefits of Canadian NG
when used for the production of domestic electricity are many. It's a much
cleaner fuel, the distribution is less per KW than coal especially with the
current and planned network of pipelines being built to deliver the fuel to
many points in the US (west coast & mid-west) and finally it's a domestic
source and not subject to many of the issues found in the middle east.

The kicker for me is that the income distribution is paid out in Canadian
dollars each month and then converted into U.S. equivalent dollars. AAV
provides a nice hedge against a falling dollar which I believe will loose up to
40% of its value over the next 3-4 years. My "Return of Capital" is paid back
over time in Canadian dollars then converted back into lesser valued U.S.
dollars.

This small investment works well for my IRA as it generates a monthly stream of
income is nicely hedged against a falling U.S. dollar and owns NG resources
that I feel are currently undervalued.

I hope you are right because I have a position in a NG driller with good

I think the future bodes well for natural gas and expect that usage will rise
both for power and transportation. I mentioned on this board that I bought GW.
I also purchased CLNE, which isn't a value stock. Nevertheless it has has
growth characteristics that I like. The Lehman Conference presentation sums up
the advantages of price and environmental friendliness that should propel NG
usage for transportation higher.

That's an interesting chart Kirk. I did not realize there was such a large
spread between oil and NG. What's your list of favorite NG companies including
drillers, consolidators and pipeline companies? Many of the integrated oil
companies I own do have exposure to LNG and are developing distribution
infrastructure but it still is a very small percentage of their business.

I recently purchased TRGL which is a NG driller with active wells located in
Europe and Turkey. It is still a very speculative play and will only do well if
they can develop more active wells from their exploratory efforts.

I am always looking for more "pure" natural gas players at a value price. These
are the ones I currently own:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=trp%2cugi%2caav%2ctrgl

Both TRP and UGI have been excellent performers for the few years I have owned
them. I should buy more TRP but it has more than doubled since I have owned it
and looks expensive at current prices. At 17 PE, it's priced well above many of
the integrated oil companies. It does pay a 3.5% dividend and has excellent
free flow cash flow but carries a lot of debt.

Hi Madharry - It looks like RAS will pay their 3rd quarter dividend.
http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/070910/20070910006490.html?.v=1
From the article:"...On September 10, 2007, the Board of Trustees of RAIT
Financial Trust ("RAIT") (NYSE:RAS - News) declared its third quarter 2007 cash
dividend on its common shares of $0.46 per common share. The dividend will be
paid on October 12, 2007 to holders of record on September 21, 2007. The
ex-dividend date is September 19, 2007...."

That's almost 5% for the quarter! I kept a stub position from my earlier trade
this month hoping that their large distributions continue. I think this stock
could eventually trade higher once their sub-prime issues get resolved and more
clarity is provided to investors as to the actual assets RAS holds in their
portfolio. There is however a class action suit pending that may distract
management (and perhaps affect future distributions) which might prolong the
stock price recovery.

Not sure I'd say Best Buy is a value stock, but I like BBY around current
price, and I have a few shares bought recently.

This is not going to be a good Christmas for retailers perhaps:

"Retailers may have worst holiday in five years, NRF says"

http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/retailers-may-have-worst-holiday/story.as
x?guid=%7BDCC364CC%2D8E38%2D4E7F%2D9638%2DF83C486B7363%7D&siteid=yhoof

It's just that historically BBY has put up good numbers; they're still growing
- overseas too; they apparently sell stuff that people want; they are reported
to be taking market share from competitors (i.e. CC).

In the July 23,2007 Barron's article on Best Buy and other retailers, two
strong reasons for the BBY case were given: the growing video game software
business (and my opinion is that these could be things that people might afford
and will want during the holiday shopping season); and the legislated
transition to digital television in Feb. 2009.

Retail stocks I am following seem to be taking a beating: recession coming
and/or consumer is finally tapped out? (no more money from home equity;
mortgage rates going up; jobs disappearing).

I don't know. I'm hoping for a muddle-through. Economy - from my narrow view of
my little environment - doesn't look that bad to me. So far anyway. I continue
to hold BBY, BBBY, others that I've mentioned. I see a few fund managers I like
buying into BBY or holding shares (I hope they are still in.): Capital
Research, Leon Cooperman, Bill Nygren, etc.

For a pessimistic perspective, Bill Wexler's thread seems to have that covered.

BBY is taking share from CC...granted, but the entire pie is shrinking rapidly.

The TV market is keeling over, and the exposure to the mortgage equity
withdrawal treadmill is frightening. It's no accident that a running joke among
the bloggers following the real estate bubble collapse involves borrowers who
went overboard to buy Hummers and big TVs.

And don't forget one important economic point. All these gadgets are made in
Asia...and prices at wholesale are bouncing off the bottom as inflation
percolates, further exacerbated by the fact that costs at every point along the
supply chain are also skyrocketing due to expensive oil. BBY will have
difficulty passing along price increases to consumers, and margins will suffer.

Video games may have some traction - even in a recession. But then - why not go
to the source and buy ERTS and ATVI?

Well - we're now at a point where we have too much capacity, coupled with
rising inflation (don't believe what the government reports, use your own eyes

consumers flush with cash from mortgage equity withdrawals.

Bill Wexler. What concerns me is that I see some of your points, and I can come
up with countervailing points, but I don't really understand your points at
deep enough level to really "get" it.

I mean it's like Texas hold-em or something where you've concluded you're now
ALL in. More correctly, all out --per your website:

"As of 9/19/2007 ..and for the first time in 25 years, I have liquidated every
one of my long positions in U.S. stocks, using the 50bps rate cut inspired
rally on 9/18 as an opportunity to get out. I am now net short, with a long
position in GLD (proxy ETF for gold bullion) as a currency hedge."

For someone with your stock market experience, time on SI, (and good looks
(according to the website) -g-), to make this kind of move --- this is somebody
who has really, really got a strong opinion. Scary strong. Scary to me that you
might be right, not only right about this sector (retail), but maybe right
about the market in total. As I say though, my concern is that I just don't
"get" it, don't have such strong an opinion or view or understanding that
things are, or are going to be, so bleak such that the most beneficial or
reasonable bet is to be entirely out of the market or short.

-------------
I've now glanced at ERTS and ATVI. Also Gamestop (GME). The stocks are very
expensive - near highs. Too expensive for me to buy. High valuation says to me
though that investors are betting video games will do well, perhaps during the
big holiday selling season. And so that encourages me to stick with BBY who I
expect will get a good share of the business.

These big tv's are coming down in price, it seems to me. And they're at all
different sizes and price points, thus broadening the market for them. They
almost seem to be must have items. Well, for people who have jobs and can pay
their mortgages. The mortgage money tappers who bought Hummers and flat panels
have already bought and are done. It's the rest of country now. (I hope.)

It doesn't seem to be that these retailers have trapped themselves. BBY, BBBY
have little debt, lots of cash. That could mean special dividends, stock
buybacks. I assume these managements have some sense where if they see or
suspect they are overbuilding, they stop. Of course, jmo, and I've been wrong

Hi Bill - You state: "...Explain how you deflate roughly $15 trillion out of

going in an economy with a GDP that is 3/4 dependent on consumer spending...".

It's simple in my mind. The US dollar will fall in value relative to many of
the other world currencies. The safe investment is to use your valuable U.S.
dollars now and buy natural resource companies and foreign assets. I believe
the US dollar will fall 40% in the next three to five years, I have been buying
foreign company's ADRs. I specifically like Brazil but I own ADRs in Australia,
South Africa, Canada and Europe.

If you cash out into US dollars and hold your proceeds in a money market fund,
it will loose value relative to the other world currencies.

For the first time that I can remember world oil purchases in Euros exceed
those priced in US dollars.

The value take here is that the world economy is discounting all assets that
are pegged to the U.S. dollar. If you assume current cash flows and earnings
from companies that generate U.S. dollars, in three to five years these assets
will be priced less relative to other foreign currencies (perhaps up to 40%
less) because the U.S. dollar will not have the same purchasing power.

This is the easiest way for the FED to spread the pain for the huge U.S.
deficits accumulated. The IRAQ "off book" expenditures ($200 Billion next
year), social security and medicare unfunded liabilities just add to this
problem. I believe that a 40% or 50% devaluation of the dollar is going to be
the way Mr Market fixes this problem.

CC's stores, at least the ones I've been to, IMHO aren't laid out nearly as

ceilings at CC don't do it for me, I much prefer BBY's ceilings which extend to

every time I have been to CC. From waiting in a line of 2 for 15 minutes to pay
for an item while the only cashier took her break (South Houston) to waiting
for approx 15 minutes to have a sales person explain some laptop features
(Raleigh). To wandering through the store for about a half hour to find
someone. Not enough sales people.

I have no doubt why CC is having problems.

I decided to buy some MECA yesterday and have bids in at lower prices. This
company has been a dog of a stock, but owns several valuable properties. The
deciding factor for me to purchase is the fact that Frank Stronbach is
investing 20 million dollars of family money at this point of the game. The
price of the private placement will be average of the share price in the ten
days of trading after the reorganization announcement. The twenty million
investment is a good indication that the Strombach family is serious about
extracting a higher value from the company.

From the press release:

arranging $100 million of funding to address immediate liquidity concerns and
provide sufficient time to implement the plan, comprised of: (i) a $20 million
private placement of MEC Class A Subordinate Voting Stock ("Class A Stock") to
Fair Enterprise Limited ("Fair Enterprise"), a company that forms part of an
estate planning vehicle for the family of Mr. Frank Stronach, the Chairman and
Interim Chief Executive Officer of MEC; and (ii) an $80 million short-term
bridge loan from a subsidiary (the "MID Lender") of MI Developments Inc.
("MID"), MEC's controlling shareholder

The company is going to look at everything, except for Golden Gate Fields,
which is a valuable property.

Here is an example of a property that will go on the auction block.

Bill, I found the evidence posted on ascensioexposed.com indicating a
relationship between you and Asensio pretty weak, but that's not why I posted
this link. I did find a a note on the website that you are known for "Dire
predictions etc." and some of you posts in SI indicate this as well. So I am
guessing that you are playing the short side quite often.

 You're an institutional money manager holding a million share block of BBY.
You've been watching the bond market over the past few days, and the activity
in PG, BUD, and MO. 

I fail to see the relationship between BBY and the stocks you mentioned above
except that they are in the consumer space. Physicists are no better than
economicst to predict the stock market. The greatest Physicists of all, Isaac
Newton, lost of lot of money in the South Sea Bubble.

Hence I try to avoid bubbles but i do look at numbers. BBY's numbers are good
while the competition is bankrupting itself. That is bullish using my simple
logic and I have a small bet in that I am right. If not I hope that some of my
other bets using the same simple logic may be right.

I am not smart enough to dig too deeply on the macro side. IMHO, as should be
obvious, on the micro side I'm bullish on BBY. I've traded BBY multiple times,
all to the plus side. Some were nothing more than short term scalps.
I'm underwater very slightly now, but I think BBY will be a winner this holiday
season.
Like Mr. Senior, I've been wrong many, many times before. Might I add, I'm sure
I will be in the future.

One I've avoided (so far) is TLB. Anyone with an opinion on this falling knife?

Anything is possible, but listening to the previous ceo call only to see him

properties maybe valuable but may not be so readily salable in this market. I
somehow could see the properties being sold for a less than adequate price to
other Stronach controlled entities under the pretext of these sales were
neccessary to pay off debt. I just dont want to be involved in this one going

Not yet, though I'm sure you can short it here and do well. In developing a

"hit list" of retailers starting at the top with those that are most
susceptible to the housing bubble collapse...example: BBBY, I then go down the
list.

By the way, i should also note that margin levels are in nosebleed territory,
and short interest is relatively low. I've had absolutely no problems finding

 Recession, recession, recession. Thats your call (it seems). Raw materials
drop, energy drop, inflation drop, gold drop, competition up, retail destroyed.
A more normal yield curve makes long bonds a tough buy. New adminstration makes
drugs a tough buy. Foods I think ADM, MON, CAG, your commodies market......INTL
I dont think so. Maybe the dollar would bail you out. 

I can't speak for Bill but effectively I view being short retailers and long
commodities as being roughly equivalent to being short the US and long the
developing world. Consider that China 15 years ago was net oil exporter and is
now the second largest importer of oil after the US. China's growth in copper
consumption last year exceeded the all of the copper consumed in the US in the
same period.

I believe it is now possible for the US to have a mild recession without the
rest of the world joining it (save for perhaps Mexico) There is a tremendous
change occurring globally in terms of shift of economic and political power. If
we have a severe global recession I don't see why food producers (and companies
that supply that market..) would not also be affected. Much of the growth in
grain consumption is tied to an increase in consumption of ethanol and the
greater consumption of meat in developing countries. Consumption for both would
decline with a global recession.

'I can't speak for Bill"

LOL, like he would let you...

" I view being short retailers and long commodities as being roughly equivalent

somewhat simplistic but OK.

"I believe it is now possible for the US to have a mild recession without the
rest of the world joining it"

guess that depends on your definition of "mild". In most things I read here on
SI, people consider US the consumption engine of the world. thats why the trade
inbalance, weak dollar, etc. Our market seems to panick if GDP only rasies 1%
Imagine how we would react if it fell 5%. Seems mild, is it? If we are the
engine and one piston misfires things will run, just not smoothly. Now if you
are not of the opinion that we are a major force of consumption well then you
and I would be disagrreeing on the basic thought, unable for either of us to
move forward.

"If we have a severe global recession I don't see why food producers (and
companies that supply that market..) would not also be affected."

this is a valid point, based on my writing, consider...

"There is a tremendous change occurring globally in terms of shift of economic
and political power."

As standard of living increases people will buy food and better food. Hopefully
savings and some credit would have been established. Just becasue your laid off
or downsized or get less hours, the last cutback is likely food. IF the
duration of the reseccesion is long and extended I think your right, food
ultimatly would suffer. In a mild or short duration, I think food would hold up
well.

remember the orginal statement bill made was hiding places. With the
historically high oil inventories (especially the US) Oil will plummet as
should most raw materials. Im thinking GOld would suffer as well, but I fully
admit to not being a gold bug. Taking all you money out of the market and
shorting is a call. throwing a bunch of money into gold? more of a hedge, not
worth it in my view. Going INTL? hisorically swings more then the US, not the
right move IMHO. Maybe INTL drug cos. may even benifit if hillery gets in the
white house.

I know from one U.K based macro fund that it tried shorting the EUR and
shorting European stock indices a long time ago. While the trade was a disaster
(as the indices rose even when the EUR corrected as desired) as it was about 3
years too early, the underlying thought may have some merit.

Why it could work out:

Demographics:
European baby boomers are at the zenith of their personal earnings power. At
the same time they hiked their savings but the higher life expectancy takes its
toll. There is a decline in births to be felt in a lack of young employees now.
The latest indication is the huge shortfall in public social security finances
of France. Someone has to pay this kind of tax, too.

The "convergence" trade comes slowly to an end. The conversion of western and
central Europe fuelled growth where western Europe alone didnt. With the
integration nearly completed and after 10 years of heavy investments we
approach a maintenance period.

Last and most important the effect of a EUR ahead of $1.40 combined with high
commodities and factor costs (not deflating in Euro terms) will take its toll
on the economies, remarkably cooling them down in terms of exports. This was so
far inhibited by an "accomodative" ECB policy which boosted the monetary base
by not less than 20% in two years.

The Euro zone was always 2 or 3 quarters behind the US cycle. The currency will
itself correct to a lower level if and when the ECB makes clear that it wont
hike but rather cut rates thanks to the perceived weakness. (The UK is done
hiking rates and the next event is a cut).

The devils advocate would say:
A debtor nation like the US isnt calling the shots. The EUR is a result of
market forces and partly underlying economics with positive capital and trade
balances. There is no harm done as Europe remains competitive for a prolonged
period because there is, I repeat, NO factor cost inflation.

The integration goes further (Ukraine, Turkey, ...) and the wealth effects are
for years to come. CEE is a bit of mini China, with cheap labor, better
demographics and immense demand. The old Europe is a consumer nation, right,
but since when is private consumption something evil? European individuals have
the means to boost their consumption because they are not indebted, on average.
They can and will bear the creeping inflation more easily.

Both sales profitable, but as I said, I am not an expert with cigar butts, so I
may be leaving money on the table.

- Bought more SPF on today's crash. IMHO, dividend elimination is positive, the
convertible issue is tough to value - it definitely dilutes, but may be a good
step to secure funding. Will hold it lightly though - may trade on any reversal
to $9 or so.

To me, WSC at current price to book value doesn't look like such a value as to
justify a supersize position. I see where book value grows in most years, but
in scanning numbers, growth in book value (roe), looks like under 5% in most
years. Way I look at it, stock trades sometimes higher than current p/bv;
sometimes lower. (looking at avg. p/bk for past ten years). Crapshoot short
term imo if someone is just trading it.
Over time, you get Munger and a rising stock price. That stock price rise
though doesn't look its been so great over the past few years. Maybe from $300
to $450 and back under $400 in four plus years. It's okay, but nothing I see to
change that the mediocre return. Lousy revenue growth now per Yahoo; joke
dividend. Summary: not enough positives to justify a supersize position.

All jmo. I've been wrong many, many times.
