Paul: <<point where AMZN should be shorted if we intended to short Can we
identify that point?? >>
Probably not. Picking tops in high flyers is like trying to pick the exact
bottom of a downtrend. That's why the strategy of averaging in with amounts
small enough such that the entire trading plan won't put you to the point where
you're forced to cover is the best I could come up with.
That said, here are a few thoughts on identifying the top:
Since this thing is emotionally driven, the top will appear in the technicals
well before the fundamentals..Exhibits top formation
When it starts to act differently in the face of good news..stays flat or sells
off in response to positive news development or some silly prediction.

>>I don't know Wayne, I used to be in your camp, but when people like Abby
Joseph Cohen, who was bearish in 1990 and Byron Wien, who's no Polyanna,

500 I'm not sure that p/e s as a whole are totally outrageous. P/Es of
small caps aren't that high, are they?<<

To the best of my understanding they are using what I would call snapshot
valuation models. That is, they value the present earnings and present interest
rates. They were bearish in 1990 at a time when I was wildly bullish. I knew
things were not going to remain as bad as they were at that time. The reverse
is now true. So I guess I disagree strongly with their definition of fair
value. I think "value" is a normalized number. An average expectation for
business activity going forward. I also think that they could be
misunderstanding the sustainability of the low cost of capital and a high
return on capital we have at present. How can aggregate U.S. business be worth
2.5x-3x the replacement cost of its assets? Many individual businesses can.
That's called goodwill. But there is also such a thing as illwill. Those are
companies that are earning less than a satisfactory return on their capital.
For every "above average" company there must be below average companies also.
"Aggregate Replacement Cost" has been mean reverting for 125 years in multiple
countries where the data was available to test it. Even if the data are
slightly wrong because of mismeasurment of R&D, software and the like, it can't
be that wrong.
Can it?

I agree with your point about PEs as a whole and small caps in particular. Not
all stocks are equally overvalued or even overvalued at all. My problem, (and
this is strictly my own thoughts) is that I don't trust the income streams for
a lot of companies any more. Experience tells us that when bubbles burst, all
sorts of income streams are not sustained. It happen in Japan, SE Asia, US in
the 20s etc...How can I value a company when I don't know if they can sustain
their earnings when the bubble bursts. Of course this assumes I am right about
the bubble. My only solution is to require a greater margin of safety.

I2: Actually I think a key point underlying the discussion is: Does valuation
work? Here's a quote from street.com today..an interview with Blodgett that
called AMZN @400 pre-split [=133 today] as a 1 year target:
"Blodget: It's a long-term buy. I'm not going to whip it around. There's a good
chance that maybe the stock will come back next month and then the 400 target
will look okay again. By any normal valuation model, these are the most
expensive stocks in history. And what history has told you about these stocks
is that valuation is a lousy tool for valuing stocks. Stocks don't go down
because they are overvalued. Arguably Yahoo ( (Nasdaq:YHOO - news) ) was
overvalued when it went public, but there was so much potential."
Is "Valuation a lousy tool for valuing stocks"?
The theme of this thread is that valuation and fundamentals matter and that
when share prices are out of line with the fundamentals, they will regress and
the investor who is willing to endure some pain if prices get further out of
line will eventually profit. Sometimes this means buying out of favor, beaten
down stocks where fundamentals are better than price reflects. Sometimes it
means shorting overvalued high fliers. The recent discussion is about how to do
this and stay within risk tolerance parameters.
I don't think short selling should or will dominate the discussion on this
thread very long, but most long side buyers can benefit by using short side
analysis tools...it improves perspective IMO. Also discussion about how not to
trade outside risk tolerance can be constructive as well.

I just read another interesting tidbit about aggregate market levels. The
Nasdaq is trading at over 100x earnings. I can't vouch for that number, but I
believe it is correct based on other things I read in the past. Some of that
may be due to the same things you were talking about like very specific
companies being overvalued, but it still is a scary number. MSFT, Intel, and
other big name tech high fliers are actually selling at a discount to the
Nasdaq so they don't account for it. They are actually helping to reduce the PE

RE: Buffet and AMZN

Buffet once told a story, in response to "Tell us about a big mistake." When he
was still very green(hard to believe), he had six thousand dollars to invest.
He split it evenly between three investments. One third of his money went to a
friend who had a gas station at a very good location. The business failed and
he lost $2,000. At the time he was telling the story, Buffet's net worth was
around $30 bil. His next comment was that the mistake cost him $15 bil. He is a
big believer in compounding.

A colleague of mine knows AMZN better than me. He explained that they buy a
book, sell it within 15 days on ave, and pay for it within 30 days on average.
So they have 15 days of float which they can use to finance the business. A
traditional bookseller sells the book after 100 days but pays for it after 30
days. So they have to finance inventory.

My response was: AMZN pays shipping charges. This has to eat a lot of the
margin. That is why SG&A is so high. It seems to me average order size would be
more important than lots of small transactions each with a shipping charge. So
it is not just a matter of building sales of any kind, but reducing shipping
charges per order.

Do we know what we are talking about?

In any case, AMZN will have to show a trend towards profitability someday.
Looking at the financial statements alone, I would value the business in the
single digits. Maybe the "AMAZON" franchise is worth something even without
earnings. I don't believe it. They will probably do a secondary. Look for
another chance to short it.

A Financial Fairy Tale

The following story is fictional, written in the style of a Tom Wolfe novel. If
the events or individuals discussed seem plausible, it is purely because, in
today's marketplace, anything is believable!

The unintended consequences of flawed government and regulatory policy are
starting to seep through the seams of the implied safety nets. The leaks are so
numerous that desperate actions are being taken to plug the “too many” holes in
the financial dike. This fact has brought together the public and private
sector together in a duplicitous manner that only a Pecora Commission will be
able to unveil. But as always, the discovery process will come after the fact.

This particular story revolves around a product set and marketplace called
“derivatives.” This is a product set and a marketplace that was developed by
the private sector with the prodding and facilitation of the New York federal
regulators. And this was a product set and marketplace that was developed
during the 1980s as a way for the New York banking system to generate revenues
to offset losses in their LDC portfolios and as a way to transfer credit risk
to third parties.

Because of the complicitous nature of the regulatory involvement in the
development of this market, the growth has been stupendous (see Chart 1). And
because of the implied safety nets, the risks taken have been “systemic” in
size. This past summer, the immense size of these risks was exposed through the
near failure of Let's Trust Computers More (LTCM). However, because of the
quick efforts of the New York Fed to broker a bailout of LTCM, derivative
portfolios were never truly marked to market. You see, bank managements knew
that regulators would have to turn a blind eye. A true accounting of derivative
contracts would be counter to the regulators' desire to see calm come back into
the capital markets. As a result, deep losses remain embedded in the derivative
portfolios of many of the financial institutions around the world.

Regulators have been turning a blind eye ever since the first devaluation took
place in the currency markets in the fall of 1997. In fact, the cumulative
credit losses (from the trillions of dollars of derivative exposures) can still
be measured in the tens of millions of dollars per institution, not in the
hundreds of millions of dollars (see Chart 2). This low level of losses is only
incredulous when one considers the large standard deviation moves that
currencies, interest rates and economies have experienced since the fall of
1997. I laugh every time I hear U.S. regulators preach to foreign governments
about the need for greater transparency and market value accounting. And so, in
the absence of regulatory, accounting and market disciplines, what would cause
a true accounting of portfolio values to take place? How about an internal
power struggle.

Such a struggle recently occurred at Nations Bank America (NBA). Due to stern
disagreements during the attempted union of managements, one side was locked
out when it was exposed that large losses were housed in an affiliate called
D.(isclose) E.(very) Flaw. Another
such situation may exist as I speak. At a foreign firm called Credit Swims
Free, so Borrow (CSFB), the board is in the process of trying to separate the
Wheat from the staff. One of the ways of accomplishing this ouster would be to
expose some of those embedded losses in their large derivatives book. These
losses have been hanging around ever since the Russian default this past fall,
but until now there has been little incentive to realize them. In fact, to give
the process some legitimacy, a fairly extensive audit of the portfolio is
currently being conducted. Pending the completion of this audit, the payment of
bonuses has been postponed.

The brotherhood of derivative purveyors are feeling somewhat threatened by this
internal management power struggle. The last thing that this club wants is a
precedent setting mark-to-market accounting of the same derivative positions
that they also carry. After all, this was what the rescue effort of Let's Trust
Computers More was all about. No member of the brotherhood could have withstood
the liquidation of LTCM's positions given that they carried the exact same
inventory. Fortunately, the brotherhood has within its membership a player
whose ambitions of grandeur are immense. In fact, this company, called Big
Merger Coming (BMC), has been trying to differentiate itself from the pack all
year. Why, you ask? So that it might gain a P/E high enough to afford a major
acquisition.

Due to a significant bet on the domestic fixed income markets, BMC was able to
differentiate itself from the pack during the fourth quarter of 1998. While
other members were reporting fourth quarter shortfalls, BMC decided to book
large gains on the sale of mortgage loans, significant credit card
securitization income, sizable debt security gains and robust loan syndication
revenues. Management decided to take these discretionary gains in early
December when they heard of the brewing troubles at CSFB. You see, there is
nothing like a good internal management struggle to put a company in play. And
Big Merger Coming had been wanting to expand both geographically and product
wise (particularly into equity underwriting). What better way than to buy CSFB.
It may surprise some to learn that BMC and CSFB had actually held merger
discussions previously, even to the point of having drawn up an organization
chart. Of course, if BMC were to buy CSFB, it may pre-empt the need to mark to
market the derivatives portfolio, a prospect that no doubt would please the
brotherhood of derivative purveyors. Any necessary valuation adjustments could
come later in the form of a “meaning less” merger restructuring charge.

In the event that a behind-the-scenes solution to CSFB's derivatives problem
does not emerge, the brotherhood has decided to take preemptive action geared
toward deflecting any potential political criticism or regulation. The
brotherhood has announced the creation of a “Counterparty Risk Management
Policy Group.” This group was formed at the urging of the SEC and Treasury
Dept. but with the approval of the federal banking regulators. Its goal is to
write a set of industry guidelines that would govern everything from trading
practices to lending standards to disclosure requirements. Its members are 12
leading domestic and international

investment or commercial banks, most of who were the primary financiers of
Let's Trust Computers More. The co-chairmen of this self-proclaimed,
self-regulatory body are Mr. Corrugated of Sacs of Gold and Mr. Thick of P. J.
Morgue.

This is the point that this financial fairy tale comes full circle. I started
off this tale by noting that the creation of the derivatives market was done in
partnership with the New York Fed. Well, it just so happens that, during the
very early and critical stages of the development of derivatives as a profit
center, Mr. Corrugated was president of the New York Fed and Mr. Thick was his
key right hand man. We now have the fox guarding the chicken coop. But then
again this wouldn't be a fairy tale if it didn't include a wily fox and a
vulnerable hen house!

Shorting an immensely overvalued stock is not simply speculation,
IMO. Amazon.com in no way deserves its current valuation, and not
just by 30%, but on the order of 1000-10000% overvaluation. The
business model is horrible, and the industry is commodity at best.
Recognizing this and committing to a short position until the
fundamentals play out is not speculation. Of course, that is not
what I did when I tried to cover last week. But now that I have

Here's another opinion on the subject of internet stocks. I did not write this,
but it deserves some thought.

"Let me try again. Wall Street cannot effectively measure the value of a
company that grows at 300% annually, and is expected to be able to continue
nearly that pace for years to come. Yahoo! may well have sales of $600 million
in 1999, and profits of 200 million. If we use a standard measure of a pe
equaling the growth rate, we get 200m x 300 = 60 billion, or 610 per share,
about. Unbelievable, huh?

I shorted this stock in April and made a profit. Seriously.If I would have sunk
all my money in a long position by the time I understood, as I should have, I
would have 8 figures now. It took me getting pissed off last week to completely
see what was happening: Wall street cannot tolerate this type of growth.

For the other side of the coin, look at psft in the last year. When you go from
100% growth to 35%, expect to be bludgeoned. The stock price collapses that
occur on slowing growth may be even more amazing than these run ups, especially
since by the time it happens, a lot of these companies will be very profitable.
It will boggle the mind of the public when it happens."

So this is worth $220 million in cash to Compaq:

For the nine months ended 10/31/98, net sales totalled $4 million, up from $377
thousand. Net loss totalled $18.9 million, up from $2.4 million. 

That's shopping.com. One would presume that Compaq sees something we all don't
see. Makes me wonder if Compaq wasn't just paying that much for the web
address. If altavista.com is worth $3 million to Compaq, well then one has to
wonder how much of the valuation of the internet companies is simply web
address.

This becomes even more absurd the more I think about it. Compaq values
shopping.com at $220 million, but the fact Compaq is buying shopping.com makes
Compaq worth $5.1 billion more in the stock market. Absurdity. But Compaq can't
be that bright. By simply announcing this, Compaq becomes an internet stock.
And internet stocks are worth at least $400/share no matter the shares
outstanding. In Compaq's case, that makes it an additional $550 billion or so.
Compaq should've bought with stock.

Meanwhile, I'm clinging to that Amazon.com short. I will be right someday
(FLW). And I'm buying Callaway Golf and Brazil (UBB, TCP). Callaway Golf may be
having a rough time, but it's a premier name in a growing industry, with no
debt, low ratios (P/B 1.4, P/S 1.0), and tons of insider buying at prices
higher than this. It's not going bankrupt, and at this price even its dividend
becomes competitive. And there's tremendous support in the 9-10 area. TCP - the
cellular co for Brazil's most populated area - was highlighted in Barron's this
week as being 4X cash flow for a 35% grower. Well, ok, but I know the private
market paid a price about 50% higher than the current price back during the
privatization, so I figure on that simple measure it is at least 33%
undervalued. And then you have the fact that the Brazilian market is undergoing
such a crisis that liquidity has dried up completely on the local exchanges.
People are sick of Brazilian stocks to the point of avoiding the exchanges
altogether. And TCP has repeated bounced off a low just below the current
price. Hard to see how this can go wrong if one holds for a few years, though I
suspect it will jump on any hint of recovery. I started a small position hoping
to see it get cheaper.

Irony of ironies, Amazon.com just sent me a high-quality T-shirt with
Amazon.com and a neat logo for being such a good Associate.

That whole P/E = growth rate is being bastardized now. Peter Lynch meant it to
be for growth rates in the 10-30% range. Clearly a 300% growth rate is not
sustainable for any length of time. Once you get above 30%, you're playing with
fire using a formula like that. Because once the growth rate goes down from
say, 50% to 30%, you're meat. Look at CATP over the last year if you want to
see that dynamic in action.

The key is for a formula like that to work, the growth rate has got to be
sustainable for a while. 3-5 years minimum. AND THE MARKET HAS GOT TO BELIEVE
IT IS SUSTAINABLE FOR A WHILE. Yahoo and these internet stocks are a special
case because there is no rhyme or reason to their valuation. I read the analyst
reports - the analyst with buy recommendations on the stocks are laughing at
the valuations now. I have never ever seen an analyst (Blodgett at Oppenheimer)
keep a strong buy on a stock which he predicts 50% downside in, and admits that
it is the most expensive stock he's ever seen in his life.

What does this have to do with value investing? I made a big mistake here
playing games with these things when the guy on the other side of the trade
doesn't care what the valuation is. And this guy is kicking my ass right now.

These stocks are going to die a spectacular death, probably within six months.
And there are people who will do jail time when that happens. But they could
triple before that. Treat them like something you got in the mail that has a
return address you think you've heard of, but is ticking and has wires sticking

I2,

It only takes 6 years for a $300 dollar stock earning $1/share and
owning a 300% growth rate to surpass $700/share/yr in earnings. So there is
power in the PEG. I think we all realize that. Lynch first proposed the idea I
think, and the Gardners took it as their own and popularized it.

My problem with the PEG is that a lot of people use it, and when it really
looks good, then usually something is happening behind the scenes that is bad,
and I don't know about it.

In any case, PEG is entirely theoretical for most internet companies, since
most, including Amazon.com, are only posting wider losses despite their sales
gains. This is because a commodity is being sold and competition is occurring
on price. If a steel maker came out and sold steel at 30% below the market, it
would grab market share like crazy. And people would dump the stock into the
toilet. But add .com and make it books and look what happens.

This is not true of Yahoo or AOL. I would never short an internet company that
has shown it can profit at all. Even Ebay. But many,
to me, don't have a model for profit, or for sustainable ultra-high
profit growth once profitability occurs.

Good investing,

Jim, All:

Re:

These stocks are going to die a spectacular death, probably within six
months.....

The trouble is they may take the entire market down with them. If the market
value of these crazy stocks is, say, $500 billion at the peak, then nearly that
much will be lost by individual investors.

If this be the case, the appetite for buying ANYTHING will be suppressed for
some years to come. Almost no one will do well.

For years, before during and after WWII, a career on Wall St. was not sought
after at all by business school types. No future!!

What is the total market capitalization of US publicly traded stocks? What
percent are internets and high techs now?

a spectacular death, probably within six months. And there are people who will
do jail time when that happens. But they could triple before that. Treat them

Excellent point.

I've heard commentators say things like "90% of the market capitalization is in
the ten largest stocks..." I'm exaggerating but their point is clear: the
nation itself is not diversified.

As for AMZN, my wife and I talked about shorting it but this is what I decided.
The downside risk (for one who shorts the stock) is wholly characterized by the
irrationality of the uninformed, over-zealous Mob (I thank Ayn Rand for the
term). They are wrong and I know it but their size and energy makes them
formidable. This isn't true for a long position in a value stock where I've
done some research, see potential and then wait for other reasonable people to
see what I see. I just don't have the guts. I do wish luck to everybody that
tries it.

In the meantime I watch as the January effect puts a little bump in the beaten
up sectors I was watching for values. Perhaps that is best. I'll get back to
raising cash.

James:

As a value investor, you ought to know better than shorting an internet stock.
Internet stocks have long ago separated themselves from valuation models -
which is probably why value investors do not understand why they get killed
shorting overpriced stocks. I see no rational for Amazon to be where it is -
but, it does not fit a valuation model, (no earnings and no near term
forseeable earnings) So take sales. Maybe a billion this year, problem is it
appears the more they sell, the more they lose. If they try to increase margins
(ie prices), I go to barnesandnoble.com or any of a handful of other book
retailers. It appears to be a difficult problem. So maybe the model suggests a
p/s of 1. Assume they take all of barnes and nobles sales ~ approx 3 billion.
Price would be 1/6 of where it is. This is nothing new to Anyone - and that is
my point. You are much better buying waaay out of money puts on these things
then shorting. Limited downside, and you know where value should be. (imo)

Shane: Good point on hiring Wal-mart execs, but the effectiveness of an
organization depends on the team as well as the coaches. Besides, hiring those
execs has put AMZN in a legal battle with big Wally.
Timing: The whole point of my averaging in with small increments is that I'm
NOT trying to pick a top, only establish a position at prices that differ
greatly from intrinsic value. I don't know how far the "Rubber band" can be
stretched before this thing snaps back to some realistic valuation based on the
present value of real earnings appropriately discounted for risk. I don't know
when it returns. I know a lot of real smart folks have tried to nail that top
and have gotten nailed instead by being forced to cover due to excess exposure.
My positions are small enough..under any scenario I can imagine that this won't
occur. The only thing that would get me to cover would be if Bezos uses his
overpriced stock to buy assets of real value, well priced, that fit his
business model well enough that earnings will eventually be generated to
justify the cap...and the market lets him do it, without penalizing share price
for mixing his internet play.

Have you confirmed with your broker the ease of borrowing AMZN shares.
Your strategy is fine on paper but if the stock continues to go up and shorts
increase your risk of automatically being bought in would increase. It is not
within your control and a real risk of shorting with too much company.

(I was short SUBM this year, as part of a hedge, which I expected to go to zero

I think it may be tough to say that the market is "overvalued" because none of
us can follow all the thousands of stocks out there.

For me, I do stock screens looking for new companies and I look through the

PEs and Growth Rates

THere is another problem with that whole concept. The market itself has EPS
growth of between 5.2%-6.5% on a peak to peak basis depending where your
starting point is.

Does anyone think the market should sell at 6 times earnings?

Would anyone out there not pay 16-17 times earnings for Coca Cola even though
it's long term growth rate might be slipping below that?

The examples are endless. I think the whole concept is faulty. It comes down to
discounting those future earnings in some way. It just so happens that higher
growth rates equal higher PEs but there is no real correlation from a value
perspective except coincidence.

The Internet Stocks

I have a few thoughts about this topic. Essentially, most of the retail,
advertising, and trading being done on the net is just substitution. Meaning
that if there was no net, it would be happening anyway in its prior form. At
bookstores, standard retail outlets, other forms of advertising, via telephone
to brokers etc... So no matter how you slice it, if the net stocks are really
worth a lot, then somebody else out there is worth much less than they are
currently trading for. Somebody is very overvalued. The net's gain is somebody
elses loss.

My guess is that if the world is going to change that much, and I think it is,
the Walmarts, ATTs, Merrill Lynchs and the media giants etc...of the world are
not going to stand idly by and get destroyed by a few upstart capital short
businesses.

I am in data processing. The creation of a web page is very cheap. It is the
advertising to build the reputation that is expensive. But if these companies
sell for 20-80 billion dollars and it would only cost a few million to develop
the best possible web page and other resources you need, that would leave 19.99
- 79.99 billion for advertising to duplicate the best net business on earth and
knock the upstarts off.

Somehow I can't see anyone paying 20-80 billion for a business that can be
duplicated for a few million and another 'x' million in advertising to gain the
same business position.

The biggest guys have the resources if the business is there. They are not
going to pay 20-80 billion for something that they can duplicate for millions.
And they certainly aren't going to throw in the towel to a bunch of companies
that are dependent on capital markets for cash since they make little or
nothing from their operations. My bet is that practically all of them are going
to go down the tubes until the prices get to a level where it makes sense for
the big guys to buy one.

Bob,

I'm trying to learn options currently too - primarily so I can find ways to
profit/hedge myself in a down market and make some money when the bubble
bursts. Up to now now my primary strategy has been to raise cash levels, but
capital gains are just too much. I'm trying to hold stocks longer now.
I'm going to consider options "play money" until I learn how to utilize them
properly, but like yourself I plan to buy deep out of the money puts on a
company such as Ebay or AMZN provided I can get a decent price.

Am going to keep the proportion of money in options very small too. To me this
is gambling so I have put restriction on how much I'll commit. I'm not going to
limit shorts to the internuts either though. Am also looking at shorting some
techs that seem overvalued but which still have investors which try to look at
the fundamentals. MU is one, along with other high priced commodity producers,
such as HTCH. Am going to try to adopt a strategy that allows me to keep on
put'in until the cows come home. This bubble may last for several years, so I
can't risk too much on any given strike date. But when it does I want to be
there.

The site you mention is a good one for option quotes. Also, there is an ad link
on that site to a company called Investrade that has some of the cheapest
option executions I've seen for small sized orders. $1.75 per contract with a
$14.95 minimum.

Paul Senior, thnx for responding. The true Value here is created thru the

in sales that quarter.

But here's what TFFI get's from the sale
- TFFI drops 5 million in debt with a savings of over $500k in interest
expense.
- TFFI also drops it's only real drag on margins (which was the seasonings
division).

So while still maintaining $15-17 million in base revs they can now allow those
revs and earnings to fall to the company without dilution from a losing asset -
not to mention the debt they wont have to service.

Now they add the president of HAIN and the senior investment banker in DLJ's
chemical division to their BOD. Also a PR firm announced today.

I'd say TFFI's gotten lean and mean and now they are gettin ready to rumble.

I like that it is on the AMEX (seems that is a backwater for discovered

government and science. Merrimac components are today found in applications as
diverse as satellites, combat and commercial aircraft, cellular radio systems,
magnetic resonance medical diagnostic instruments, personal communications
systems (PCS) and wireless internet connectivity."

Their sales are growing.

Sales for 1996 $14,152,970
Sales for 1997 $18,659,106
Sales for 1998 $16,500,000 (9 months)

They are proud of a new Multi-Mix device. I got one of their mailers. Our
fighter planes used to have a 15 pound box to filter out transmissions; now it
is this small stacked chip device that weights like 8 ounces or so. So this may
be a winner for them.

"Multi-Mix™ Microtechnology, a proprietary 3-dimensional microwave packaging
technology, has recently appeared in important electronics industry trade
publication articles and is featured on the cover
of the November issue of Microwave Journal, a leading RF/Microwave industry
publication. Customer response to our new products has been extremely
positive."

Oh, yes, they make money. But the satellite business is not so good lately.
This is the fly in the ointment now:

"The Company entered the fourth quarter of 1998 with a backlog of $6.4 million,
a decrease of $3.7 million or 37% from the same time last year. Major satellite
and defense customers continued to defer purchases as a result of delays in
certain programs. Management of the
Company believes that many of the satellite constellation programs that have
been delayed may resume and translate into orders during the remainder of 1998
and continue positively into 1999."

Still there is a lot positive about the company. I'm in for a small position.

As for the AMZN discussion I have noticed a drastic increase in my informal

Re: I'm trying to learn options currently too - primarily so I can find ways to
profit/hedge myself in a down market and make some money when the bubble bursts

The simplest way to do that IMO is selling in-the-money covered calls. Example:
You own 200 shares of ABC you bought @ 10, now it is 15 but you do not want to
sell. Suppose you see June ABC calls, strike price 12 1/2, selling at, say 4
(the option is already in the money by 2 1/2 so of course it will sell for more
than that).

If you sell 2 of those calls, you keep the $ from the sale of course. If come
June (3rd Friday I think?) ABC is trading below 12 1/2 the calls you sold
expire worthless and you keep the stock and the proceeds from the calls; you
have just hedged your position quite nicely. Your basis in the stock is now
only 6 bucks ($10-4)! If it exceeds 12 1/2 your stock will be sold to cover
your calls. But in this case it was like selling at 16 1/2 (12 1/2 strike + 4
on selling call)-not bad. IMO the only thing to avoid is ratcheting up your
option position to keep your stock if it goes much higher (ie, buy back the
calls at a loss and sell another one at a higher price, longer expiration
date). Instead, be mentally ready to let the stock go if the calls you sell
remain in the money. Hope this helps...

A Short Caveat -
Let me relate a sad experience of mine that you might find relevant: Several
years ago I became convinced that CUC was cooking its books. So I took a modest
short position, that grew and grew, just like Jack's beanstalk. Every quarter I
would rummage around and make a checklist - same old accounting tricks, same
old crooks running the place. When they started using watered stock to buy real
software companies, I bailed - earning a six figure tax loss. Then they merged
to form Cendant. The rest is history. (Am I allowed to join in on that
shareholder suit as a jilted short?)

My caution would be that stock prices can run far ahead of rational valuation.
Using rational observers as an indicator of how big the bubble can get is
flawed -> it seems that it will keep going until no one cares any more. The
final price drive seems to occur when the shorts capitulate, and cover. The
ever present risk is that the company will use cheap stock to buy real
companies. Now what do you do?

EXTRA CREDIT QUESTION: Compaq is paying $220 million to buy Shopping.com (a
failing online mall with a 12 month loss of $18 million on $4 million of

would recommend:

A. buy Shopping.com
B. start over, and hire 2200 software engineers for one year
C. hire 220 software engineers for 10 years

The ever present risk is that the company will use cheap stock to buy real

I've thought of that. Amazon.com, for being such a crummy business,
has an amazing amount of spending power in its immensely inflated
shares. It could do 10 $1 billion dollar stock acquisitions of real
companies that needed to earn their way to $1 billion market cap,
and AMZN stock would hardly suffer. It's added $10 billion in
market cap in just the last few weeks. No sweat. If Amazon started
to do that, or did a second offering at these prices, I'd have
to cover. But as I understand it Bezos is trying to stay close
to home and be a retailer, keep doing what he's doing. So be it,
and I'll short it.

buffet and munger had a little experiment with shorting the fluff on NASDAQ. It
stands to reason that the best "value-ers" of corportate assets could tell when
a company was vastly overpriced, and they could. THAT was not the problem.
Their expeirment was largely unrewarding and altogether frustrating. They even
said Graham tried it for a while and got four out of five right, but got WIPED
OUT on the fifth!

My read from this is that web and cm finally realized that OWNING businesses
was what they wanted to do, and was what WORKED over the long haul when taxes
and transaction costs were added back. The best investors are, above all else,
businesslike in their investing. A corporate allocator of capital would
scarcely be sitting in his office allocating precious corporate capital to his
five best short ideas. WEB would argue that neither should the individual
allocating his OWN capital.

The more businesslike an investor is, the LESS he will likely be sidetracked by
BETS, GUESSES, or SPECULATIONS on the DIRECTION of individual securities,
which, ultimatley, is what shorting is ALL about. Not to mention that the EGO
seems more intimately involved when shorting.

It would not suffer from dilution. It would suffer
from unpredictable changes of investor psychology.
I.e. investors seeing AMZN buy a "slow grower" would decide
that the 100% growth days are over and it's time
to bail. The stock would crash in a day. Of course they
could buy another bubble stock but such purchase would not
improve their situation.

Secondaries are also dangerous to bubble stocks.
They increase the float and raise uncomfortable questions

Order strategies on the net [For those that use web based brokers]: When trying
to buy a value stock in a diving market or sell into a spike on a volatile
issue, various types of orders may be entered. A live broker will usually
understand what you want to do and implement it accordingly. Unfortunately web
broker software is only as smart as the guy who programmed it and if you don't
understand how your particular program works, you may not get the results you
want. For example, today I tried to cover my modest short on AMZN near the open
with a limit order of $130 [Not because I think it's worth that, but if someone
hands me 60 points within 6 days, I'm gonna grab it and reshort on the
reaction]. Because AMZN was trading below my buy to cover limit, the computer
kicked out an error [A live broker would have seen the situation and
implemented the trade]. By the time I fiddle-faddled around with it and
re-entered the order AMZN was well above my take the money and run level so the
opportunity was missed. I talked to several folks at the firm about this issue
and was told that "That's what the software does" and that I should have
entered and buy stop limit order..which this particular software won't do on
Nasdaq orders.
My point here is not to get into specifics about my software or the firm
involved, but just to give a HEADS-UP on unexpected limitations and
misuderstandings that can occur using software to enter trades.

On those very fast movers such as AMZN, I believe one gets the best executions
by (1) being on the phone with a broker who can execute in milli-seconds, or
(2) using Real-Tick with MB Trading or such-like and executing the trade
oneself in milliseconds.

The web-based trading at brokers such as E-Trade, Schwab, Webstreet, DLJ,

Value investing and shorting internet stocks

I have to agree with others on this board that I do not see
much of a link between value investing and shorting "over-valued"
stocks. Yes, they both involve a contrarian point of view,
but the underlying strategies and risk profiles are totally
different.

I think shorting stocks (especially internet) may be an
interesting and exciting topic, but it is purely speculation
and not in the spirit of value investing.

RealTick software shows you active quotes and market maker bids in realtime and
by a single click of the mouse you can execute an order which hits the
marketmaker screens immediately.

http://www.mbtrader.com

Bob, it sounds like your broker's software doesn't allow a limit bid above the
current price, which is really bad software. They don't all do that. (I have
had accounts at 6 on-line brokers)

Nevertheless, on fast movers such as AMZN, all rules are off. Market orders
with web brokers can take 15 minutes to execute. Even on the phone, sometimes
the firm's own in-house software slows executions, or the market maker to which
the firm sells its order flow is overwhelmed or intentionally not executing.

In fact, the slow executions of market orders are a scandal on fast moving
stocks. The normal NASDAQ rules regarding the MM's obligation to execute in a
timely fashion are relaxed when a stock is declared fast-moving.

MM's, who are supposed to provide liquidity, stop executing, collect inventory
of a stock, and sell it to you only after the price has risen. If it's not
higher, they don't sell, and therefore the price rises.

Collusion among MM's is not a myth, as recent settlements attest.

In any case, I am sure that most people did not have their limit orders
executed at this morning's prices. Simply not enough supply, which is why the
prices went back up so quickly.

For more coherent discussion on this stuff, a couple of threads are useful.

No question that your points are valid re: rational

investors are paying so much more attention to $/share

massive dilution without hurting the stock. I don't

Re: TBH, I sold out oh around 120, thankfully. My intent was to await a retreat
and buy the individual spin-offs as they hit value levels. Wow, have they - but
not for the reasons I thought. You can use http://www.adr.com for more
information. I started buying TCP when it hit 18 1/2 this Monday, then bought
more at 15 3/4 the next day, then more at 13 5/8 the next day. So as usual, I'm
pretty good at catching falling knives - with my feet.

TCP is the cellular spin off for the most populous, wealthiest state in Brazil,
and includes its financial center. Now at less than 7 times earnings and about
three times cash flow. The kicker is it will grow. On CNBC today a
communications fund PM was pointing out how telcomm was an integral part of
Brazil's growth plans, and devaluation or no, he didn't see the Telebras
spin-offs' plans being inhibited or cut back in anyway. The guy didn't have a
position in it because of the devaluation uncertainty, so I doubt he was
hyping. Plus I can see the same thing, since foreign investment is already
committed into these things. For TCP, that means targeted growth in the 20%
range/year. And there's a nice dividend. So that's my favorite now, and the
only one I'm buying, but a lot of them look good, just not with as much growth
potential, and TCP's only a tiny bit more xpensive, if you can call 7 X
earnings expensive. I figure you only need one of the spin-offs, since they'll
all participate in any rebound. IMO TCP will lead the way when it happens. If
capital outflows this week come in less than expected (we're off to a good
start - Wednesday's outflows slowed to about 33% less than expected), Brazil
will rebound quickly. Don't underestimate the risk in Brazil though- the strong
currency was very very important to its economic health, and it really is
between a rock and a hard place. My bet is that is what Cardoso wanted - to
force Congress into his reforms, pension being the most critical. He knew a
limited devaluation would put a big scare into the politicians - I can't see
any other reason for a limited devaluation.

I also bought UBB at 14 9/16 back when Armin brought it up. As the guy in
Barron's pointed out this weekend, UBB has not been a risk- taker, and a large
portion of its assets are govt paper. But I didn't see the devaluation. The
bank is much riskier than the telcos but still I bought more UBB in the 10's,
and I'll buy more at 7 when it gets there. UBB was already less than 90% of
tangible book at 14 and, so I figured a devaluation has already been in the
stock price. Wrongo. As with everything, though, I root my holdings lower so I
can get them even cheaper.

Shorting Overvalued Stocks

I have just a few insights into shorting overvalued stocks. The first is that
overvalued stocks tend to become more overvalued. If you look at the charts of
former high flyers that eventually busted, they almost always bust when the
fundamentals clearly deteriorate. Before that, they are driven up by momentum
players. In some cases that can be years. Sort of a situation where the stock
moves from 40x earnings to 50x earnings all the way to 80x rapidly rising
earning. (Being on the short side of this is a total bloodbath even if you are
eventually vindicated.) Eventually the growth stops or the fundamental reason
you saw for shorting the company comes to pass and the company blows up.

So the key to successful shorting is more than just valuation. It is timing the
trigger that will expose the fundamental flaw. And you better be right about
the flaw, because losses are unlimited if you misunderstood the business.

If you use puts and have the timing wrong it's the same story. You can be in
the hole so much in premiums before you are right, that when you are right you
are struggling to break even.

I like the following strategy for entering a short position.

I sell naked out of the money calls. If the stock remains out of the money I
keep collecting premiums. If it gets into the money, I roll the calls out and
sometimes up (depending on the premiums). So I effectively become short the
stock because the options are in the money and can be rolled down if the stock
price falls. But unlike the short seller, I have collected at least some
premiums and missed out on some of the move up because they were originally out
of the money. The annualized premium collection can sometimes be as high as
20%-50%. I can be dead wrong about the stock and still break even. The downside
to the strategy is if the stock plummets rapidly you only get your accumulated
premiums and may not fully participate. I still like this idea better. It
limits losses to some degree.

But with naked calls, you could still get murdered if the stock gaps up on you.
Please elaborate, you've got me very interested and I've got a couple stocks in

re: REITS

Barton Biggs, a Morgan Stanley strategist you should always at least listen to,
focused on REITs in the Barrons Roundtable published today. Forget which ones
he picked, when Barrons grilled him on the stocks it was clear he doesn't know
one from the other. But what he is saying is that as a bear on the market, I
want something with a yield above treasuries and with asset value.

[My background is in real estate, and thus it is no coincidence that my best
picks on this thread were real estate oriented (SJP, TRC), though I also posted
a REIT as one of my favorite picks a year ago. It went up precisely zero for
the year, which means it was a top performer among REITS. Which is like being
the most truthful statement in Clinton's grand jury testimony. I cover REITs
institutionally for my firm, and in full disclosure, the first three are
positions my firm owns. But also in full disclosure, my firm owns six other
REITs. These are the ones I would buy now.]

Colonial Properties (CLP) very conservative, excellent management, dominate
Alabama (who's going to bother them?), 8.5% yield. This is a management that
has grown earnings (FFO) at about 12% since its IPO in 1994 and has increased
its dividend every year but the stock has gone from 23 to 27. This is the most
honest, conservative mangement team you could ever hope to meet. You want to
buy this under 27. Don't expect excitement, but you'll make a more than fair
return given the limited risk involved.

Chelsea Realty (CCG) - Without question the best company in the factory outlet
sector. They have the best locations and it follows that the get the best
tenants. You will find traffic jams entering some of their properties. Yields
8.1%. Buy it under 35.

Public Storage (PSA) - Without question the leader in consumer warehouse
storage real estate. Their national branding strategy is introducing economies
of scale into a mom+pop business. Their occupancy and especially rental rate
increase numbers have been stellar. But the stock has not moved. This is not a
dividend play like the others because PSA management has skirted the REIT rules
a bit to reinvest the maximum of retained earnings. Which they should. If you
look at this one, don't think REIT, think McDonalds circa 1972. I consider this
a buy under 30.

Eastgroup Properties (EGP) - An excellent company in the industrial (warehouse)
sector. Their track record is excellent and I can vouch for management's
honesty. These guys have a good track record and they are good people. The
properties are worth 20+, so if you get a shot at 18, its a buy considering its
8% yield. And remember, warehouse is probably the most conservative class of
real estate property.

And, the least conservative class of real estate, and the most beat up,
hotels...There is risk here. duh. My money is on LaSalle Properties (LHO - $13
1/2). It ran big on Friday, so be careful. My target price is about 16. If
you're considering an investment in this one, wait a few days and you might get
it closer to 12. Even at the spike price at Friday's close, the dividend yield
is north of 12%. And this is another one where I can personally vouch for
management's honesty. I wish I could vouch for the hotel sector's growth in
1999, though things look a lot better now than they did six months ago when
LaSalle went public at 18.

>>I'm not familiar with your terminology. What do mean when you say "roll

selling calls and the stock continues to rocket up why would you still
not get killed?<<

I WILL be losing some money, but not as much as a short seller of the same
security. I'm going to make up some numbers here just to demonstrate.

Let's say I hate "xyz" stock at $50 a share. In January, I sell March 50 calls
for $3. If the stock goes to $57 by March, I am losing $4. ($7 - $3 = $4) A
short seller would be losing $7. In March I can then sell May 55 calls for
$4.25 after buying back the March calls for $7 ("rolling out" to May and "up"
to a strike price of 55). If the stock goes to $55, I lost 4 bucks on the first
transaction and made $4.25 on the second. With commissions and spreads I broke
out about even give or take. So the stock went against me for $5 bucks yet I
still broke approximately even. The short seller lost $5.

On the downside, if the stock immediately went to $45, I could buy back the $50
calls and net a profit (although not as much as the short seller)...end of
story. Or I could buy back the 50s (and profit) and then sell 45 calls and get
another 3 bucks.

What this process does is eliminate some of the downside of short selling if
you are wrong and allows you to make some money if you are right.

It isn't low risk. I'm sorry if my post suggested that. The losses can be huge
if you are very wrong about the stock. The favorable thing about it is this, if
you were going to short the stock anyway and you turn out to be very wrong, you
will lose a lot less with the options approach because you are receiving
premiums. And if the stock keeps moving sideways you can still make money. My
idea on the strategy is this. Don't under any circumstances do this unless you
were going to short the stock anyway. If you are not a short seller, stay away.

<Shorting overvalued stocks..selling calls> Glad to see ideas on how to capture
widest spreads between intrinsic value and price. However, 90% of option
players lose. The ones that win usually are selling rather than buying premium
[like your suggested strategy] and are full-time professionals with real-time
info - quotes and arbitrage model calculations & access to lowest bid-asked
spreads. Occasional players dabbling in strategies are their lunch.
Occasionally 5 sigma events blow the pro's out of the water when something that
can't happen does [Crash of 87 produced lots of this, also collapse of Long
term Capital Management]. Highfliers like net stocks can and do gap up beyond
reason or estimation. Premium expansion in response to these moves can be
unpredictable [A bad thing when you're short premium]. Any strategy involving
selling puts or calls should IMO, be preceded by calculation of maximum adverse
move impact..and adjustment of position size or use of spreads to limit risk.
I think the CBOE offers info on basic option strategies to provide
overview..for more in depth treatment, Larry McMillan has authored some of the
most highly regarded books on option strategies.
I don't do options for many of the reasons listed above..prior exploration lead
to those observations.
BTW: Since many on this board consider the subject of shorting high-fliers..and
