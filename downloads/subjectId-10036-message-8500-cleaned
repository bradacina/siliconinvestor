More on FLO:

It appears that the market now values FLO ex-KBL stock at about 19M. This for
an enterprise that brought in 1.55 billion in sales last year, and possesses
quite a few brand as well as distribution advantages.

The catch: Flowers ex-Keebler is responsible for about $550M - or about 5 1/2
bucks per share -in debt, and must come up with somewhat above $40M each year
in order to make its interest payments. It cannot access Keebler's cash flow,
which brings us to problem number 2 - Keebler has supplied virtually all the
operating cash flow reported by Flowers in the first six months this year. Take
a more normal year, like say 98, and FLO ex-KBL EBITDA is about $178 million.
Cap ex is somewhere around $100 million - reading back through Flowers SEC
stuff, it appears to be capital intensive business. Surprise, surprise. The
coverage is there, but it really is not a wonderful business for equity
holders. ROA is no better than industry averages if you don't count Keebler.
For 99, there's nada.

Earthgrains trades at a PSR of 0.49, and Interstate Bakeries trades at a PSR of
0.49. Both have debt/equity ratios of about 1/2 of Flowers ex-Keebler. Allowing
for the debt, my estimate is that Flowers equity should trade around $200
million. I get this by applying a 1/2 sales multiple to 1.55 billion, then
subracting out the debt of $550M, and reconciling this with an industry P/B of
about 2 when not depressed- which would give a total market value of about 720
million - and again subtracting out the debt. Also I looked at free cash flows
of about about 40 million available to shareholders after interest and taxes in
a typical year, and put a 5-6 multiple on that. This tells me that Flowers
equity ex-Keebler should trade for somewhere between 170 and 240 million.
Compared to 19M now.

So properly executed, an arbitrage could be very profitable if the market
cooperates. One just has to get over the idea of shorting the fastest-growing
portion of Flowers, and be confident that Flowers won't face any kind of
liquidity crisis that would cause the company to sell out its equity holders.

Lesson learned: Initially I missed the fact that Keebler is little more than a
share price floor for Flowers shareholders, as its cash flow is really not
accessible. I underestimated the risk of FLO equity going to zero and
overestimated the margin of safety as a result. What I thought was a 10-minute
no-brainer wasn't.

Well I think the verdict re Jill's open market buy was either (1) a proactive
move to save her bacon or (2) she was surprised by the numbers in September
like the rest of us. Possibility #1 suggests IMHO Jill's key motive in her
stock purchase was self-preservation and possibility #2 indicates simply being
asleep at the switch. That's what I call a Hobson's choice. Count me among
those in the ever-growing "Dump Jill" camp.

The Learning Company was supposed to be a transforming event. There is no
excuse why TLC is losing money. And regarding this debacle on the TLC side,
"what did Jill know and when did she know it"?!

A blurb on CNBC re MAT cratering today was the remark that "Many other
issues seen by analysts as significant in the shortfall as well." See:

James, re: Mattel.

They have ~$1.1B of debt, and about $1.4B of goodwill + "Other Assets". Book
value is $1.7B. Sales are a bit north of $5B, so if they generate any sort of
positive margin they really ought to be able to keep their creditors happy (I
think??).

Paying ~$13 per share (~$5.5B) for $1.7B accounting book value still seems
expensive (it seems even more expensive if you look at it as paying $5.5B for
about $0.3B of tangible book --- yikes!!). There doesn't seem to be a
Graham-type margin of safety here at all (which is OK with me, but it really
ought to be acknowledged for the record), rather, we'd have to be assured of a
Buffett-type situation wherein there exists a large intangible value
off-balance sheet. But gosh, even at these "distress" prices premium brands
sure seem to cost a lot...

Provided that we are *assured* of the company not running into liquidity
problems and being forced into bankruptcy, I can certainly see and follow all
of the very good reasons for buying Mattel at these prices. It would seem to me
to be a Buffett-type of "pay up for a good company", once one has a good handle
on the long term value of the company (I don't yet).

I haven't dug into MAT, so I don't know if the terms of their debt and the size
of their interest payments are a worry or not. Have you? Do you have lots of
confidence that there's no prospect of bankruptcy for them? Or are you going to
make me do my own damn work... ;-)

I'm starting a position in MAT today also.

MAT has a history of increasing sales every year (until now?). For the first
time (that I can tell) price/sales is now below one. This is a ruling reason to
buy the stock imo.

Lot not to like also. Which, because the stock has crashed, people will focus
much more on now. Debt seems to be increasing rapidly. And the number of shares
outstanding is increasing. Return on assets peaked in '95. So it looks to me
like MAT is a consumer of capital and and also a poor allocator of it.

Because earnings fluctuate and best earnings year was '96 (at $1.23), I have
trouble seeing MAT as a $40 stock. But given MAT's franchise(s), size,
strength, and some time for management to make some changes, I will bet the
stock can recover to 18-20 within 2 years.

Aside to myself (given prior readings of MAT here and on Buffettology): I sure
hope I am not being sucked into this stock just due to the
interest/enthusiasm/excitement that Value posters are generating (I sense) now
that the stock has suddenly dropped. I just wonder how much this is a factor
for me when so many "respectable" investors (well, investors for whom I have
some modicum of respect, anyway) are involved with this stock.

Another aside: I never did understand The Learning Co. Unfortunately for me,
even when somebody posted on it here @$5 in 1997 (?) just before it scooted to
$20 (if I recall) and was then bought out (@about $28? I think)

I never understood The Learning Company either. That was my big mistake on
Mattel. At $12 though I don't think The Learning Company has to be worth
anything for Mattel's core business to be cheap. Jill has got to go, and I
think it will be soon. The acquisition gave away 31% of a pretty darned good
company for a business of dubious value. Then management proceeded to disclose
very little about The Learning Company's business for about six months before
it blew up in their face. In hindsight, I probably should have seen it coming.
But if I could invest with 20/20 hindsight, I would be a lot richer. For me
Mattel was just the last nail in the coffin of my portfolio. This year, and
especially the last three months, have been an unmitigated disaster. I have not
even updated the value of my holdings in the last 3 weeks the damage has been
so bad. My big winners in the summer (LKI, JRC) roundtripped and then some, and
meanwhile I've got these internet shorts that have just added insult to injury.
Fortunately I've been doing a little better professionally with other peoples
money, with the glaring exception of Mattel. If my professional portfolio
looked like my personal portfolio I'd have worse problems. Its just been a
really really bad year, and my one forecast I can be sure of is that it will
end in three months.

Why is it we can seemingly invest better for our parents than we can for
ourselves?

If this is so, it might be important to know why -g-.

1. Invest other peoples money by playing to our strengths. If our strength is
value stock picking, we will put value stocks in the portfolio. There's no
pressure to add CISCO, YAHOO, LUCENT, etc. for people who don't possibly know
such companies exist, let alone what their products/services are. And our
parents know us real well. We don't smart-ass 'em by picking smart-ass stocks
(Unless of course we have that personality. But then our parents wouldn't be
trusting us with their money (I hope.)

2. We will try to accommodate objectives of parent based on our strengths, and
subtly knowing we might have to answer for every investment that we make that
goes bad and that could be seen as odd. Like buying internet stocks for parents
who don't use a computer, or shorting stocks for people who don't know what
shorting means. Or making abrupt portfolio changes - like suddenly selling 50%
of the portfolio.

3. So that we don't look like total idiots, we will give investments time to
work out. And when they go up in value, we won't sell be so quick to sell. Like
closing a position @$11 on a stock bought at $10 two weeks ago and jumping
right into another stock because it looks even better.

4. Since the old folks likely had to work for their money, we know we'll have
to answer for high turnover (lots of commissions). So we won't be day trading.
Also, since our folks trust us, they aren't going to be asking us (we hope)
every day about each stock or maybe even about the total portfolio value. So
we'll have a little breathing room. So we don't watch each stock each hour of
each day and panic ourselves out of, or into, a position. If we're lucky, our
parents aren't at a point where they're trying to get rich. (They aren't trying
to make a decent retirement on $40,000 portfolio.) Whatever level they got to,
that's it. We can think about managing the money as if we're business people -
able to take some fluctuations and business risk-- not desperately trying to
jack up performance or beat some index that our folks could care less about.
We're like.... prudent.

Without understanding exactly why or how, we will give the managed stock
portfolio every chance to succeed. And avoid doing things that we like to do
(take a flyer here and there, couple of shorts, a few options, gold anyone?,
paired trades, etc.) but intuitively know just wouldn't be right for Mom and
Dad's account.

From:Q.

new earnings estimates for MAT:

excerpts from two articles at CBS Marketwatch:

The Learning Company accounts for 15 percent of Mattel's sales, said Beth
Burnson, an analyst at ABN Amro. As a result, she cut her 1999 earnings
estimates for Mattel to $1.18 from $1.50. Burnson maintained the toy maker's
"buy" rating.

Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jill Krutick ... slashed her 1999 earnings
estimate to 76 cents a share from $1.35 a share and 2000 estimate to $1 a share
from $1.70 a share after a talk with management indicated the problems "touch
all product areas."

Today's stock price of 11 7/8 looks like a p/e of 10 or 16 based on 1999 eps,
depending on which analyst you choose.

I nibbled today at the close after I visited a toy store and saw that they did
indeed still have a big aisle of Barbie, and a bunch of HotWheels too. Just the
same, I'm not fully convinced that an earnings multiple of 10-16 is a
tremendous bargain for a company that looks like it might be stagnant at best.

Jeffrey Bash: re: "A 50% gain in 2 years isn't enough for me to buy a stock".
Well if such stocks buys are available and if that is not good enough for you,
I must conclude you are someone who requires extreme results of his portfolio.
Given that the best investors cannot make 25% on their money consistently, nor,
I think, even inconsistently but on average, what is it that you do to achieve
such results? (Or are you saying you just shoot for the stars to expect
something a lot less?) Is it a concentrated portfolio? I don't recall seeing
any studies (they may exist and be generally available, I just don't know)which
show that value investors can expect such favorable results. I've seen stories
of people who have specific investments that do about 25%/yr. for many years
(somebody on this thread in Tyco for a dozen years; somebody on the Abbott
(ABT) thread whose base cost is under $1/sh.; a drip investor in AFLAC since
1985, etc.) But these seem to be isolated investments that went roaringly well
- unexpectedly and unplanned well. Graham's idea I thought was that value
investing was a place to invest, not necessarily to become roaringly rich.

We're all different. To me, if I had 4 stocks that I thought would go up 50% in
two years, and two of them actually did and I was on board, that'd be about 12
1/2 % annual return before taxes. Given where I am, that's not bad, especially
if that performance could be replicated every year. Or if the gains came before
two years, which sometimes seems to have occurred in this market.

Jeffrey, I don't know that MAT deserves a pe of more than 10-12. But then
again, I'm one who has trouble paying more than 12 pe for any stock. Don't mean
to be a relativist about it, but I do want to invest. So I have to, I think,
relax absolute standards sometimes to try to get what I think will work in
today's/tomorrow's environment.

The way MAT jumps around on earnings, I'm more comfortable going with price to
sales. If sales can hold steady or continue to rise as they have in past years,
MAYBE there's a shot they can bring some profits in. (With the franchise and
dominance MAT has, they ought to at some point earn some decent money and/or
return to investors' good graces.) For MAT, the PSR is generally about 1.4,
sometimes 1.9 or higher (yearly average). So at psr below 1.0 now, there's lot
of potential (imo) for this stock to move higher.

New Holland (NH) is a wonderful example of my style. The stock did not hit me
over the head until it got to $10, despite several folks buying it quite a bit
higher. I bought it then for a few points and sold it because I got
uncomfortable about something. I bought it back again at an average cost of $9
and sold it at $17.

One thing I have learned in 35 years of investing is, to paraphrase Buffett,
there will always be another "pitch". I have usually found that if I buy before
a stock is screaming "buy me" I make a mistake. Waiting means I miss a lot of
stocks (like CAV at 3 3/4 last week, which might not see that price again). But
so what. I am waiting with some interest on EBSC.

When I buy, I think I have a potential 50+% in one year which, since I have no
compunction about buying a stock like CAV, I need to offset the volatility of
lower quality stocks/companies and the fact that I am a poor seller - despite
being pretty accurate on NH (thanks to responding properly to specific news).

When stocks are screaming "sell me" I too often ignore it as I generally look
to hold it for a 2-3 year time period and much higher prices. That keeps me in
a stock like CCUR which I bought under 2 a couple of years ago and is now 7,
but has also gotten me into trouble on some cyclical stock round trips (either
because the business was cyclical/changing, like the electronics distributors,
or the stock price tended to have wide swings around fair valuation, which I
did not pay enough attention to, like the ECM stocks).

I believe in concentration, no more than 10-15 stocks, as I do not believe I
can properly manage any more than that number of companies.
Proper management for me means reading everything public on the company that I
can find including the filings, the threads, as well as talking with mgmt. In
my opinion, if I couldn't write an analyst report I don't know the company well
enough.

I'm with Jeff on this one Paul (though your argument on Mattel hits the nail on
the head). You buy when you think you have a screamer - a 50% gain. As we all
know, half of them (if you're lucky) work. And that gives you a decent return.
The key is avoiding the falling knives like Mattel. 50% potential with no
downside risk - they're out there, and when you find one you usually know it,
but they're rare. Where I've found those consistently is net-nets (with my
added criteria). One of these days I'm just going to conclude I should only
invest in those. But getting back to Paul's earlier post about investing for
your mother, I just put about a tenth of my mother's portfolio into LKI, EBSC
and MAXS. Those might be the least risky stocks in her portfolio, but every
time I talk to her those are the ones she bugs me about. If Disney's down a
couple points, no big deal. If LKI is down an eighth I get a call. We'll see
how she takes Mattel - on that one I'm more worried about my boss - and my
wife. I own that in every account I am associated with.

For those interested in insurance companies review HGIC.

This has been a favorite of Allmon, who was a value investor but also an
extreme bear. I say was because I have not heard anything about him for several
years after he sold out his Allmon Funds. I owned HGIC several years ago and
took a small profit because the stock languished from lack of attention. This
may happen again but the company is so cheap relative to its peers that with an

Paul, interesting views on investing for our parents. I am a senior but
invested for my Dad for several years when he was in his 90's and only had his
lifetime savings of about $40,000 and social security to live on. (You can live
on that in Cleveland where rent in a decent apartment is $250 and you can
afford to go bowling 3 times a week besides). My approach was to buy value
stocks with options and to write covered slightly in the money calls Overall I
was able to generate 6-7 thousand per year without depleting his capital.
That is why I like to invest in stocks with options, for example my last two
trades include ali and avl, both with options that permitted me to enter with
approximately 20% downside protection but limited upside.
I still think such form of investing is worthy of consideration especially when
a bear market is still a distinct possibility. Of course an investment in a go
go fund would have been many times better during the past bull market, but the
risks would have been intolerable.

FWIW, General Cigar, a favorite of mine and Mario Gabelli and a net net at that
just blew past analysts' estimates 0.20 vs. 0.08 for the third quarter. They
didn't provide a balance sheet, but the news was announced 20 min before the
close and the stock barely moved. There still might be time to get in.

Speaking of moms, I just got mine into General Cigar at 6 1/16 today. Also
added about 33% to my position at 6 1/8. Also moved here into Mattel at 12 3/8.
If I were patient enough to wait for these kinds of opportunities all the time,
I'd never care what the market did.

But I'm not. I also bought back Tidewater today and feel fortunate that it has
come back this far. I started a smallish position on principle, and hope it
goes lower - just like I hope and pray Deswell will go to 8 one last time!

You're probably right about 'One Up on Wall Street', but I don't recall that he
expressed concerns about the business plan at the time.

IMHO, SRV has a very simple business plan to start with. The corner stone of it
is the finality of us human beings. Since we have no escape what so ever from
it, and that humanity is growing at a tremendous rate all over the world, one
day or an other we'll be a customer... and there will be lot's of guys to keep
us company.

Of course, SRV is facing some difficulties, to say the least, right now. The
race to consolidate -- which has already driven Canadian competitor Loewen
Group to bankruptcy -- is probably the main reason why the balance sheet have
deteriorated. Of course, there's some 'weakness' on the mortality front, but I
guess that no one believes that the situation will last forever...

This being said, the business model remains the same. They are the industry
leader and I don't see it change any time soon. I don't have a position on this
stock yet, but my interest is growing as I see the price going South every day.

Of course, it would be interesting to hear other participants express their
opinion. What about you guys?

I think you'll find that inventory is suspect in just about any serious net net
candidate, and General Cigar is no different. MPP is working through a catch 22
between soft demand for its final product and commitments to buy raw tobacco.
Its unfinished product inventory grew and its finished product inventory
shrank. Overall, there is a glut to be worked through, but it's pretty
understandable how the glut came about.

That Russian bond deal is something from left field. Gabelli's a big holder

One problem TOY has is getting people in the stores. Pokemon clubs may

On the other hand,the stock rise today could just a delayed reaction to the

Hi Armin,

Re: Xerox

Throwing out the baby with the bath-water? It sure looks like it. But the
reasons given by management also sound pretty ominous: increased competition,
unfavorable product mix, restructuring. Increased competition, well, what can
you do. But the last two sound like management's responsibility. (plus a pretty
high debt level)

If I am to buy this stock as a growth-stock-at-value-prices then I am going to
have to have some reason to suspect that management can overcome these
obstacles. I do not watch this company so I'll leave it to the thread to
comment on that.

If I am to buy this stock as a market-overreaction-value stock then your guess
is probably better than mine. I have not done too well with these since the
ones that I buy tend to continue lower in fits and starts. If anybody has any
tips on doing this successfully I am more than willing to listen! :)

I agree. This strategy also benefits from dealing with stocks that I already

the material. Not too long ago my positions were not large enough to trade

Re Home builders
From Bloomberg Magazine. John Neff, retired manager of Windsor Fund says he
thinks "home builder stocks are undervalued now" No kidding! His rationale is
interesting. Stocks are reflecting the conventional wisdom that you shouldn't
buy late in the business cycle. But for exactly that reason "investors can make
a mint" when the P/E returns to normal levels during the next up cycle.
How about oil service stocks as discussed in this thread.
Also of interest in Bloomberg is an article by Richard Bernstein of Merrill
Lynch. Last April value stocks(lowest P/B of the S&P 500) rose by 27% from
previous year and beat the 500 by 15%. A retrospective review going back to 86
showed"value strategies never provided a negative absolute return nor under
performed the S&P 500 during the 12 months after the outstanding month"

The net-nets are still out there - actually more of them than I've seen before.
I run a screen every month or so that captures all net-nets on the market -
usually it runs 2 1/2 pages, and the last six months have been all the same
names I've already rejected. I ran it today - bingo - 4 pages, new names. I
guess that's what 300 new 52 week lows per day for a week creates.

From there I cull the list down to about 15 based on 1) Have I seen this name
here before? and 2) has anything changed with one I considered interesting but
not interesting enough to buy before? i.e. has the price fallen another 25%? I
found one that looks fantastic. Very very small, but it looks like another
Penobscot. Give me two weeks to do a little more homework and buy my shares
(its not the most liquid thing in the world), and I'll get back to you.
Hopefully Net-net X won't be like the last time I posted something like this,
six months ago, when net-net X was Concord Fabrics. I was never able to buy any
shares because I wouldn't pay the 1/8 spread, then the thing got taken over for
a huge premium.

As for my live net-net picks - further developments on two of them.
1) Elder Beerman. Same store sales up 6% in September. Same store sales had
been falling the last few months. That's a big number for such a low valuation.
So now I count four catalysts on this net-net ($~7.50 net/net vs. $6 3/8 stock
price). Two large holders of the stock pressuring management and providing a
floor on the price, a recently announced share buyback, the sale of a business
two weeks ago, and now improving fundamentals. It doesn't get any better than
this in my book, especially because the shares are liquid enough for
institutions to buy and there is an analyst out there pounding the table to buy
it. And the stock is only about an eighth above where I first bought it - and
three of these four catalysts have developed since then. I've been adding
steadily, and still am.
2) Lazare Kaplan (not a net-net any more, but close enough) - showed a little
strength this week off the bottom, reports earnings next week I think. These
guys are middlemen in the diamond industry. Tiffany is on one side, DeBeers is
on the other. Both stocks are in strong uptrends. You want to watch this
quarter very very closely if you own the stock or are looking to buy it. The
last quarter was not pretty at all.

re:"A better strategy I have found by watching stocks I own is to add/buy ones
with a positive surprise if the price is still reasonable... "

For cratered stocks not already owned where a person is thinking of
establishing a position:

There are at least two essential questions that might be asked when a stock
tanks as Xerox has:

1. Will the stock price recover in a reasonable enough period of time to allow
a decent profit from an investment now? Or perhaps, is the stock price now well
enough below intrinsic value?

2. Will the stock continue to decline? Either through general selling or the
discovery of more "cockroaches" in the company's business.

If the answer to both is the affirmative, and a person's tolerance for pain is
low and experience and confidence with these types of buys are also low, then
the person will just naturally want to refrain from buying. Until there's some
confidence and some evidence that the stock has bottomed. Which assumes the
person will monitor the stock and will have a decent buy-in point when/if a
positive event occurs.

For me, a basic premise is to buy value when value shows. If Xerox at 31 is a
buy because it it undervalued and offers a margin of safety and is a good/great
opportunity, then buy. Buy some. Lag in. When Xerox drops to 28, buy a little
more. A little more at 25. So when the positive event occurs and everyone has
figured it out, and the stock is back to 29-31, you're already on your way with
a profit. And of course, do this within a diversified portfolio. Perhaps one
drawback to all this though is that, imo, the investor has to have enough
capital--- to be diversified and to be patient and tolerate temporary price
drops.

In my opinion, making it a practice to refuse to buy well situated value stocks
(#1) because they might drop further in price (#2), incorrectly focuses way too
much on temporary price drops to the exclusion of very good profit
opportunities.

EBSC came public about two years ago, then did a secondary - both offerings at

just seeing these shareholders dumping a bad investment, a tax loss is all the
more reason. At some point, this selling has got to dry up, given that big
buyers (including the company itself) have emerged to absorb the shares at 6 or
so. By January, barring a MAJOR earnings disappointment, I think this stock
will be set for a big move (i.e. it will all be held by investors who aren't

I wonder if Reidman Corp. will make a tender offer for the rest of Penobscot.
I'm not all that eager to sell at the $11.75 price.

I think they must get more shares to force a merger and take it private. 75%
maybe?

So Penobscot did turn out to be a double in about 18 months. I think it had
brushed 11 or 12 once in between as well. I wound up buying at six and selling
at about 8 twice, so I can't complain. That's generally all I try to do with
these net-nets.

I run a customized screen on a professional system called Factset. It works
very very well to provide a starting point for research. (Then as I've said
before I run a labor intensive process to take 100 names down to one or two
with the strongest investment merit.) I don't know of another way to screen
precisely for net-nets. You'd figure somebody would start posting a screen on
the internet one of these days.

I took a quick look at XRX on Friday and it reminds me of Kodak. No interest
unless I'm missing something big. What I see is limited free cash generation,
steady deterioration of book value, and a leveraged balance sheet. I do not
believe their franchise is particularly strong, either.

On XRX, I have felt for some years a bit about them the way I have posted on
the greeting card companies. (Current technology really cuts into the greeting
card market.)

On XRX, every one of us is to some extent our own printing/publishing company
needing less in the way of duplication than we used to. One simple example:
Before the Internet, if I needed a tax form at the
last minute I would go to the Library and Xerox a copy from their master book.
Now I go to the IRS on line and print a copy off my own PC printer.

XRX: I used to follow the stock and the business. I think you got it right. And
the article in the NY Times is close too. Earnings have been growing but, for
an alleged growth company, sales are not growing so rapidly. Earnings have
improved due to financial "things" and downsizing (imo). The excuse for poor
sales in the past has been (I recall), Brazil. The hype has been (imo), Xerox
is digitized and networked and that that business segment for Xerox is
expanding (rev's & profits) greatly. But, Xerox has a tremendous base of
installed copiers and duplicators and that big business is not growing and
dwarfs the networking part that is. (I think of Xerox now more like a cash cow.
And Xerox, imo, should have been valued as such - not with the multiple it
had.)

I remember a few years back seeing survey results of asking business consumers
(buyers & users) what their favorite computer printers were. HP by far, number
one. For one or two survey categories, (not sure what it was now) say 15 pages
and 30 pages per minute machines, number one choice of respondents was HP.
Xerox ranked 2nd or 3rd. Pretty funny actually. Because HP didn't even make
printers in those categories. Which tells you of the domination and reputation
of HP. I should have bought HP stock then. Ah well. We learn too late
sometimes.

I'm surprised to see so much insider buying now on stocks that have been
mentioned here. I don't recall amounts being so heavy and among such a wide
variety of stocks. Maybe I've just not been aware of it, or maybe the prices
have come down now enough to attract the insiders, or maybe there's something
structural happening (like the companies are giving incentives to insiders to
buy). Or maybe it's just a random thing that I now see.

Prices insiders say they are buying might now be below prices that have been
recently posted here. Which I think could be expected. Value investors imo tend
to be a bit early. Occupational hazard -g-.

Here's a list of some heavy (imo) insider buys recently of stocks mentioned on
this thread):

Conseco (CNC) $62M worth. Wow. I must not understand what I am reading. Perhaps
it's some arbitrage play. (I don't know what it could be though. I have a
position and I know of no recent acquisitions.)

Health South (HRC). $35M worth of buys after Mike Burry's recommendation!

CNA $10.7M. A Mike Burry mention as I recall.

NWL $4M. (@$32/sh.) I2 brought it to the thread recently.

MBI. $4M. Mentioned and discussed by Jim Clarke and me.

Saks (SKS) $2.3M. Not mentioned here. But I've been thinking about it for a
couple of weeks. Anyone else?

Chicago Pizza (CHGO) $2M. Post 8578. Larry Newman. Until now, I'd thought I'd
rather eat the product than buy the stock. (Think I will pass again on CHGO
stock though.)

VAR $1.9M. Mike Burry again? Here or on Buffettology thread?

JBHT $1.7. Trucker JB Hunt. I forgot who knows this stock&company. Jim Clarke I
think?

Stewart (STEI). $0.7M buying of this buried funeral home company.

IGL. $0.4M of this fertilizer company.

Harleysville (HGIC). 0.3M A recent "look at" suggestion from Allen Furlan for
insurance investors.

(Just mentioning all this for conversational purposes. Not trying to hype
anybody/any stock. Also, I realize "heavy" insider buying - open market
purchases - must be analyzed situationally. That is, importance and
significance relate to shares outstanding and market price as well as number
and type of insiders making the buys. And the frequency or pattern of buys
perhaps. So a couple of $.05M buys by both the CFO and CEO on a $10 stock with
a 2M sh. float might be considered "heavy" or significant. Or it might not be.
And for large caps, multimillions of dollars might not be significant. Or maybe
it is. For this post, I just used absolute dollar amounts.)

Paul - among the things to check with insider buying is whether the company
loans the insider the cash to make such a buy. If so, what are the terms?
Conseco has been singled out recently as a company that does this. Another
caveat on HealthSouth - their CEO was Chairman of MedPartners and bought 1
million shares in the $11-12 range. Following which the stock went to $3. My
sense was that he was trying to send a message rather than make an investment.

Paul, for those of us who have been around a while perhaps the following
analogy will mean something:

Hewlett Packard is to Xerox as Xerox is to Addressograph Multigraph.

What multiple should a "cash-cow" sell at?

All, has anyone noticed that for this thread to take notice of a company like
XRX, the company first has to step in dogsh*t? If XRX executed and performed
well and as expected, it's stock would not have been wounded and never would
have been up for consideration by "value" investors. More and more I feel like
"value investing" (or my value investing anyway) is more like a spendthrift at
the grocery store, who dotes over the damaged goods corner, buys a dented can
of food that is selling at a discount, calling it a "value"...only to end up in
the ER for samonella! FWIW...hope this is not flame bait

You are addressing the price side of the business. The price gets our attention
enough to evaluate the business strength IMO. Your damaged can could be a name
brand, the house brand or generic label to continue your analogy. It is the
damage and the resulting drop in price that brings it to the radar screen of
the value investor.

Jeffrey, LOL! Apt analogy. Well, in this market, for those of us who have been
around a while -g-, "should" as in what pe multiple should a cash cow sell for,
that is a tough question. I'll say 10-12, which would give an earnings/price
ratio 8-10%, somewhere maybe around an 8% gov't bond. I'd prefer a multiple
closer to 6-8, but then that would mean that the cash cows are way overpriced
for this market.

For Xerox, if it's a cash cow, Xerox managers don't see it that way. Sales
increased only about 20% over 6 years or so, while managers doubled the long
term debt, (And they let shares outstanding increase a little too.)

If I put a multiple of 10 on recent best year's earnings I see ($2.02 in '97),
I would pay mayb $21 per share. Also then,the current .80 div. would give a
yield of about 4%. To me, that's pretty fair in this market for investors in a
"cash cow". Good thing for Xerox stockholders that not many investors see it
like I do. (i.e. that the stock @$31 is still overvalued by 1/3)

I'll bite.

I do not disagree with how we discover "value" candidates. However, the trick
is to distinguish ones which are within our purview which are there for
temporary reasons rather than for permanent ones. In other words, is the dent
in the can of long run importance or not.

In my opinion, in the case of the greeting card companies, and perhaps for XRX,
there have been structural changes in their businesses that are important and
of long term significance. Even in those kinds of
companies where there have been structural changes of importance, like an EBSC
where the flagship downtown store model is not where it is at,
we still have the opportunity to judge whether the problem is lethal
or not-fatal and way over-discounted in the stock price.

For what it is worth, I consider the greeting card company problems more
serious than those of XRX. However, I think that XRX situation has not been
adequately discounted by the market for us value investors, and may never be
since it is a large cap stock.
