CRMT - Interesting how the the numbers have improved on this one in recent
months. I would have expected the opposite but it appears that they are getting
their act together once again. I'm not sure what it is. Good mgmt? Locations in
the heartland? Demand for fuel efficient used cars? Lack of alternative
financing? Whatever it is, they hit another 52 week high today.

Earnings were released yesterday:

Highlights of fourth quarter operating results:

* Net income of $6.048 million ($.51 per diluted share) vs. $2.1 million or
$.17 per diluted share for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2007
* Overall revenue increase of 29.1% with same store revenue growth of 30.3%
* Retail unit sales increase of 25.3%
* Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables of 5.9%
compared to 8.5% for the fourth quarter of 2007
* Provision for credit losses of 20.0% of sales compared to 26.6% for the
fourth quarter of 2007
* Gross margin of 43% of sales compared to 41.5% of sales for the fourth
quarter of 2007
* Accounts over 30 days past due down to 3.1% at April 30, 2008 compared to

Paul -- congrats on BIG. Prob a good time to sell, you rode it up quite a ways.
Jurgis, I looked at your post on AEO, and that looks tempting. But I caught
myself...

I am so frightened that things are unraveling, that I am going to follow a
strategy of fear. I have been semi-following this strategy for a while, but now
it is complete. Unless there is a very compelling and clear reason to hold
anything, I am only keeping energy and dividend stocks.

dividends -- I think reits and ACAS have been overly punished, that their
dividends are mostly secure (unless things really unravel, and then all bets
are off). (And I live on the dividends.) I have a small amount of recently
purchased MCGC and am nervous about that one -- will sell as it climbs back up.
And I am holding energy -- for obvious reasons.

so I sold OSK yesterday at the open, and was happy to get out at $27 (I had a
small position). I sold TRN and CMI today, each at a nice profit. I will sell
PSS soon, because I just noticed that I am at breakeven on my recent purchase.
(I sold others earlier in the year, like TM, VLO, hotel Reits and such.)

The few "other category" stocks I own are railroad and miners. BTU BNI CNI BHP
RIO FCX. But smaller potatoes, in my bag. No airlines, automobile, autoparts,
retail, jewelery, housing, appliances, electronics, software, services,
trucking, restaurants,...

The problem with that strategy is that you never know when to get out of it. ;)
And by the time you have a cheery consensus that things are great once again,
all the prices will be way higher.

I am buying and will continue buying. Actually the more we drop, the better it
is for me. I am generating pretty good FCF from my salary/etc, so to have a
severe downturn to buy things is the best that could happen. If we turn around
in 5-10 years or so, I could potentially retire if I buy the correct things
here. ;)

Holding energy is not a bad approach though. At least so far. Though I will
change my tune if energy stocks continue running up and/or oil gets to ~$200.

In at $3.50 (Carmart changed name and symbol: symbol was previously CNGR in

I believe I was still selling off some of those shares in '05 or '06 at around
$16 or more (and that was after after the 3:2 stock split).

If we're talking other auto dealerships, then now I am a suffering holder and
still a buyer. I have GPI SAH LAD PAG AN ABG. I'm considering adding to Penske
(PAG). It might be the best well-run (Mr. Penske being an astute businessman)
although the p/e, p/sales are higher for the company than others I have. Some
plusses and minuses with each. LAD, for example, has a decent dividend yield,
but its franchises include many domestic, especially Chrysler. (Domestic and/or
Chrysler not as desirable apparently as foreign)

Interesting list you've made of industries and their performance in the last
recession. Of course that was the recession then, this is the now recession.
Hard to see that #3, Music and Video Stores, can even exist in future as a
retail business or as a stock. I have several stocks in the industries

i agree with the skepticism. and i hope i am not too pessimistic, but the
future may not be at all like the past. this especially applies to energy and
transportation. the airlines are obvious. as another example -- the auto
bubble:

a clipping (link below):

The report by CIBC World Markets also predicts there will be 10 million fewer
cars on the road in the United States by 2012.
“Over the next four years, we are likely to witness the greatest mass exodus of
vehicles off America's highways in history,” Jeffrey Rubin, the lead author,
wrote in Thursday's report...Overall vehicle sales will drop from 14 million to
11 million by 2012 – the lowest level since the early 1980s.

............
i would bet that the displacements are going to be very significant in certain
industries -- very non linear.

and the study is just trying to take into account gas costs -- what about cost
inflation in steel, energy, and transportation? and then the auto industry
tries to spread the fixed costs over lower volumes...

I don't argue that even the best value managers have pretty bad results in this

are much more difficult to calculate (compared to straightforward TAVFX, LMVTX
prices + distributions). I still like to see correct numbers, since otherwise
they are misleading a lot of people about Marty. ;)

IMHO, the only large-ish value managers who succeeded in these 6 months were
overweight in energy. My 401k has Allianz NFJ Small-Cap Value Fund and they are
approximately flat with 16% energy, 24% materials weightings. Of course, small
managers, like you, may find other venues, but the positive stuff was mostly
energy I think. Now, the question is when energy becomes a bubble? ;)

Edit: Apparently CGMFX is also chasing materials and energy. At least according

Whether or not energy stocks can hold up in a market where the indexes continue

Remember Mirant? When they BK'd the next day of trading on the pink sheets the
pension fund was required to liquidate all pension fund stock and it sold at
around 18 or twenty cents I think. Employees' pensions were vaporized.

preferred eventually did well. it took three years. MIR made history as a few
guys I met through the yahoo board started up a petition online and got enough
pledged stock to form a stockholders committee that battled and won a seat in
the BK proceedings. It took over 3 years but those that are still holding made
out OK.

 I dont presume to know bankruptcy law but as a layperson with a little court
experience i dont see how the court will favor preferred shareholders over
employee pensions. people familiar with gm and or pension law feel free to
comment. .

I don't either. The pension liabilities in the case of bankruptcy will be cut
to some extend and I think that senior debt will recover at least some value.
Also the senior debt will pay interest long after GM dividend is cut to zero. I
would not want to own GM senior debt but i would vastly prefer it over owning
GM stock.

Very scary to be in these bdc's. It's so hard to value their underlying
investments and the deals that the bdc's make.

I'm still in the several I've bought -- losses with them all.

I had bought these things because I believed that the dividends were mostly
okay because of the bdc's stream of business opportunities, and that the bdc
stocks would provide some stability to my portfolio to reduce its volatility. A
package of bdc's being safer than just choosing one, I figured. Instead, I
found the possibility of dividend (distribution) cuts to be very worrisome.
Problematical for each and all of the bdc's. Further, I've found the bdc stocks
add great volatility to the portfolio, not reduce it.

Achhh.

Grommit -
the rapid fall of OSK is very disconcerning and a warning to holder of highly
leveraged companies.Everything with large debt is vulnerable.

I suppose that TEX is next. they are way more international than OSK which was
75% domestic but still - with a hardstop in the US and Europe my guess is that
it's a matter of time until China and friends hit the brakes to some extend as
well.

I think i stick with my MLP pipeline macro theme. I like the gassy one most.
their service to move energy is much in demand, prices are index to inflation
and to some extend to crude and gas and there is a lot of work to do to replump
the US and open up new supplies from new gas fields. there are nice and growing
distribution yields and debt loads are reasonable 950:50 equity). Their
Achilles heal is that they have to issue equity from time to time which can
bring unit prices under pressure for a while. I see this sector surviving and

When I spent a few minutes looking at his data, the only thing i could infer
from the data is that delinquency rate of 31-60 days continues to be over 5%.
anecdotally, i somehow missed a bill for my HELOC and my bank called me 4 days
after the payment was due to ask if there was a problem. I had never in my life
been called 4 days after a due date about anything. The point being that I am
sure that banks are much more dilligent now about following up early on past
due mortgages so that the 31-60 day delinquencies are real problems. To me this
could represent about 20% of such loans going into foreclosure annually.

I think the best argument for owning MBI might be the legal defense that loan
originator in making many of these loans perpetrated fraud and therefore the
MBI guaranty is not enforcable. However, there is also something called being a
holder in due course which might apply to this. for example if A sells B a good
fraudulently and takes back a note, and A then sells that note to C, B is still
obligated to pay C on the note despite the fraud because C is considered a
holder in due course- an innocent bystander in this fraud. I wonder if anyone
who reads this has researched the legal aspects of the MBI and ABK gtys in any
detail.

"We would not be buyers of Oshkosh on weakness this morning as the downturn in

Due to the current dislocation of the CLO market, which we believe may continue
for an extended period of time, we and other companies in the commercial
finance sector will have to access alternative debt markets in order to grow.
The debt capital that will be available will most likely be at a higher cost,
and terms and conditions may be less favorable. This has resulted and will
continue to result in significant slowing of our origination activity during
2008.

In the event that the United States economy enters into an extended downturn or
a recession, it is possible that the results of some of the middle market
companies similar to those in which we invest could experience deterioration
which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting debt service requirements
and an increase in defaults. While we are not seeing signs of an overall
deterioration in the operating results of our portfolio companies at this time,
there can be no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio
companies will not be affected adversely by economic conditions, which could
have a negative impact on our future results.

LM. Looks like my valuations of asset managers has been wrong. I'm still

I gave up on LM for several reasons. One being I got tired of losing money in
the stock. Some justification with LM not having much exposure to managing
European stocks - an area of growing interest to USA people; with Bill Miller's
losses driving exits from this LM flagship fund; from LM's poor management of
money market funds wherein they had to put money into the fund to keep net
asset/sh. from going below the key $1/sh. price. Irritating to me, and telling
to me, that LM management felt they had to be so competitive with money market
yields that they strove for higher yields with stuff they didn't understand. Is
what happens when marketing or greed or something overrule analysts (or they
have incompetent or inattentive analysts). That killed LM for me.

I confess that I am at a loss to understand how all these value guys got so
many stocks wrong with their vast experience and cadre of analysts. Reading
Einhorn's book is a bit revealing and makes me think I need to be much more
rigorous in my own review of information and no longer relying that a position
is vetted because a respected value guy owns it. One of his astute comments is
that he assumes that the person or entity selling the stock to you probably
knows a lot more about the stock than you do as they have owned it awhile, so
if they are selling you
need to have some very compelling reason to buy it.

there were two many mutual fund managers that have been burned by the
financials to give me much comfort in their analytical skills and access to
senior management. I remember some guy being quoted in Barrons how Countrywide
was an amazing company and should be at $70 when it was $33, and how Bill
Miller thought it was worth at least in the $20s when it was in the low teens.
He also though yahoo was worth more than Microsoft offered. Wonder what he
feels now. Bill Nygren at one point had 18% of oakmark select in WM. I thought
that was overly confident.

Certainly the recent anti-oil sands and drilling postures by various and sundry
politicians, when we are being held hostage by our dependency on oil, and the
havoc wreaked across the board by a poorly thought out ethanol plan which is
really going to hurt all consumers makes me yearn for political candidates with
more intelligence than we are seeing now. I particularly love the arguments of
how drilling for oil isnt going to help us now, ignoring the fact that they
said the same thing 5 years ago, when it could have helped us now, and could
help us in 5 years had they approved it now.

Some of the things value guys got wrong, but for most of them (not counting
Countrywide and Bear) the jury is really out. It is quite possible that Miller
and Marty and Buffett will make huge returns in coming 5 years on their current
positions. Judging their performance by 6 months to 1 year holdings is really
not smart. MOST of value plays go down after they are bought, since no one is
so smart as to catch the bottom. Let's revisit this in 5 years and see then
which investments were great and which ones were foolish.

Of course there is always a risk of a take-under for undervalued investments
and there is also always a risk of BK. Unfortunately for financials both of

beating the SP500 for a long time but the last two years wrecked the most

UNH -
 Health insurers (e.g. UNH) downgraded: "Health insurers tumble after analyst
issues dire note" 

Uugh. this stock really cost me. I made at least 3 mistakes and i can trace it
back to breaking my trading/investing rules

Rule #1. When unexpected bad news hits sell. Don't ask questions and try to be
smart about the exit point, just sell. this rule applies to unexpected turns in
business performance, things that get put into 10Q/10k filings and it applies
more to large caps than small caps. The reason: you are not the only one that
want's out but as a small investor you can get out before the large
institutions that hold millions of shares get out. use your advantage and wait
for the carnage to unfold before getting in. The bad news hit with WLP first
but later UNH was hit as well.

There were certain exit points that I did not use once the bad news kept
coming. the stock continued to trickle down more. Even worse I switched some
funds from WLP to UNH to harvest tax losses with WLP (assuming recovery of the
sector). this made matters worse.
The last exit point was when UNH revised earnings, which first did not sound to
bad but when analyst took the numbers apart the selling pressure continued.

What to do know. I sold my highest cost shares today. I also sold my highest
cost shares in RYCEY (Rolls Royce) as well and used the proceeds to buy
something else - BWP another pipeline MLP, more about that later.

Date:7/4/2008 2:36:47 AM
From:Spekulatius
I purchased some stocks today. They are in very different business but are
cheap and have one thing in common that becomes more and more important going
forward - pricing power:

BWP - pipeline company. A recent unit offering at 25.3$ trashed the MLP and the
units hit their march lows in the 21$ range again. The march decline was caused
by news of a 800M$ cost overrun at BWP huge expansion project initially valued
at 3.7B$ but which now costs 4.5B$. Initially this project was calculated at
7-7.5x EBITDA/ Capex which now due to cost overruns is closer to 9x EBITDA.
Still with this multiple the projects are mildy accreditive and addon projects
(assuming there are no more cost overruns) may get the total multiple even
lower.
Since this dreaded CC in March things have been looking up.

1) No more cost overruns relative to revised plans
2) All FERC approvals granted
3) The GP Loews group acquired 28M units @30$ each a substantial premium to
support BWP. Even better those units will receive reduced distributions for 5
years. With the recent capital raise of 250M$(10M units) there are only about
300M$ equity raises left (this year or next) to conclude the financing for the
Capex program
4) Insider buys from the Tisch family
5) The pipeline capacity seems to sell out quickly after it becomes online (see
the recent announcements)

The pipelines itself is FERC regulated meaning that tariffs are indexed to CPI
+1.3%. The contracts are LT with about 6-10 years duration on fixed terms,
independent of gas prices or volumes. It's a simple fee business. I also
noticed that BWP's main backbone pipe as well as the recent East Texas to
Mississippi expansion runs right through the Haynesville shale, so there may be
opportunities for nice incremental business in a few years.

UHR.VX - the Swatch group - the largest watch maker (by revenue in the world).
The business in the top end has been humming along well especially in Asia and
Arabia. PE based on Y2007 numbers i around 12 and the balance sheet it
ironclad.I think the luxury business will hold together in this recession and
the brand equity that Swatch owns is impossible to duplicate.

I am also looking at a couple of liquor companies. DEO, RI.PA, RCO.PA and
luxury company MC.PA I think all those companies have demonstrated pricing
power which might be a very valuable asset in the stagflationary climate I am
envisioning.

One of my general concerns right now about stocks is that one can buy preferred

That would seem to me to be very competitive with stocks and less risky. There
is a real big concern with many of the reigional and community banks that they
are heavily into construction loans as a percentage of risk capital. I wonder
if anyone has a table about that. There is some acreage for sale in my
neighborhood that is very choice but I would think that whoever bought it would
have to hold it for 4-5 years before building on it as there is a glut of
houses here on the market already and this is primarily a 2nd home owners
market. I have just started to ask about potential financing for it and one
bank i spoke to told me that the most they will lend on is 10 acres, and that
most banks are not making lot loans at all anymore. would anyone else like to
share their experience about this? also from another thread apparently the fdic
put out a news release outline to what extent they provide insurance on bank
accounts. the writer then goes on to say that they have never seen the fdic put

Madharry, what are some of these companies that have such preferred yields, and
do they have reasonable call provisions for investors?

Would seem to me that if yields on preferreds are much higher than debt (bond)
interest, that companies would want to call in or buy in their preferreds, and
issue bonds instead. Especially as bond interest is a deductible item, whereas
preferred payments are made with aftertax money.

So there's the risk of the preferred being called away that has to be
considered, I presume (?).

in plain text that his goal is 10% annualized gain independent of what market
does. And Buffett said numerous times that people expecting 15-20% gains are
deluded. I think he does not expect even 10% gains in broad market going
forward. Last couple years the huge gains were mostly in energy and developing
markets (BRIC, etc.). Now looking at macro level it's not even clear if BRIC or
energy will have such great gains as before.

Sure, it's still possible for small portfolios to outperform. And with current
market drop, a lot of opportunities are starting to appear both in big
well-known names and in international stocks. So IMHO it may be possible to get
good gains from current level.

Brazilian ETF - I believe it's an issue of float/cap. I was at a talk with a
guy who ran Scudder's Brazil fund and made huge gains. He pretty much said that
most Latin America stocks have too small float or cap for funds to invest. He
said that was the reason there were very no country funds except Brazil and
most Latin America funds are very overweight in Brazil compared to other LA
countries.

Not sure if that is also the reason for EWZ having so few "unknown" stocks.
Maybe they are just market-cap weighed for Bovespa.

Imo, one thing that's assumed by the vast majority of fund investors is that
the funds' performance numbers are accurate or "truthful".

I assume many funds lie or exaggerate their performance. There's too much money
involved for them not to shade their numbers.

The gains funds say they get over time "with dividends reinvested" are more
than what an investor in their funds will see.

I've no facts. Just my opinion only.

I would doubt this happens, since this is somewhat easily calculated and would
lead to a huge bad publicity if deception was shown. Might also lead to
lawsuit. Considering someone even cracked down on Beardstown Ladies, I'm pretty
sure there are a lot of people who would love to write an article about fund
XXXXX fudging their reported results.

Funds do not subtract taxes though, so in reality you will have lower return
than stated unless your investment is in tax deferred account. Some funds may
also assume minimum load/fees that won't be true for some investors. Although
they do usually account correctly for different share classes, e.g. normal with
1.5% management fee and institutional with 0.5% or something. The reported
numbers usually have a correct discrepancy based on that.

If I owned hedge funds, I would probably be much more investigative into their
numbers, since these are not publicly disclosed and the number of people
doublechecking the results would be very small.

We don't really know what stocks are sold when with mutual funds.

"Everyone" attributes quarterly swings of stock prices sometimes to funds that
sell their losing stocks at end-of-quarter or buy more of winning, popular
stocks so they can report most favorable results.

Which funds, and what stocks? I've never seen any fund announce that they do
this or have done this. "Window Dressing". Yet "everybody" says it's a
not-uncommon occurrence.

Gamesmanship, misleading, misdirecting, cutting corners, -- call it what you
want. It's only one way mutual funds can skew results to their favor. I say,
why should I assume they are rigorous in fairly reporting their performance
numbers. I believe these "window dressers" would view it - changing purchase
dates, using averages inappropriately, "ignoring" some losses or expenses - all
are just another way to report results most favorably.

Paul regarding MLP's - the biggest disadvantage of those funds is their poor
performance relative to what i think can be done by an astute investor. Times
like these open up many opportunities due to indiscriminate selling. For
example BWP dived from 28$ peak to 21.3$ in the bottom in the matter of 4
weeks. I was watching the tape after the secondary and could tell that somebody
was trying to support BWP buying up millions of shares at 25.4$, 25$, 24$ -
then all of a sudden the support was gone and the units went on yet another
scary dive. I bought some at 21.5$. there are no fundamental changes that i am
aware of other than the fact that the secondary units were placed in one of the
worst possible times.

Those are opportunities that I want to exploit. BWP currently yields 8.3% and I
think the distribution will be lifted going forward. Funds do not offer chances
like this.

I agree with you. I have been investing in MLP's for years and this appears to

"...regarding MLP's - the biggest disadvantage of those funds is their poor

Yes, I'll agree. I don't view it as an either/or thing though. That's just me.
I've got no problem (I hope) picking a few MLP's that show easy tax filings and
that I like because I believe they might be okay performers for me and/or
better performers than the MLP funds I have. I'll take the MLP funds too for
diversification into the MLP arena. Tradeoff being more diversification among a
bunch of MLP's (held in the fund/funds) and less paperwork, but not as good
yield or potential capital gains as with individual picks.

I don't like funds. I'd rather pick my own stocks and create my own fund. There
are just some funds I have wanted because they provide me with some
diversification into areas where I want to go but have no expertise or cannot
make purchases in the USA.

I own these other funds, for example:

AGC. Convertible securities

TRAMX. Middle East (and Africa)

IF. Indonesia

EWY. Korea

IIF/INP India

I'm in losing positions with AGC, TRAMX, and IF. IIF/INP have dropped more than
50% from their highs, and I seem to be very wrong in not having sold at those
better times. At this point then, given results that I've got, moving money
into these areas/these funds has not been a successful way for me to diversify.

>I'm in losing positions with AGC, TRAMX, and IF. IIF/INP have dropped 50% from

The problem with funds is that it's pretty much impossible to value them. Yeah,
sure, you could potentially look at holdings, P/Es and P/Ss, but still that
would be very general and perhaps wrong numbers, since holdings change and
their prices + ratios change too.

So one is stuck with either holding them forever or buying/selling on macro
picture. I am mostly in "hold forever" camp though, like you, I missed great
opportunity to sell IIF at the toppish valuations. I am trying to minimize the
number of funds I hold though because of the reasons above. I only have small
positions in Third Avenue funds for Marty's letters and his deep-shit (pardon
my french) value investing. I hold some IIF and some TDF. I may actually exit
TDF, since nowadays I have quite a bit of China exposure directly and I don't
like Mobius that much. I sold EWZ. I am getting out of IGE and converting into
direct energy holdings or exiting totally. I have very small positions in coal
KOL and nuclear NLR funds, since I did not see what companies to buy in those
areas. Mostly for sniffing though. ;)

I may get some TRAMX if I can get it with no fee - I think Fidelity charged a
fee to get it when I looked. I thought about Korea and Indonesia, but I don't
see very strong macro reasons to buy them, so I'll skip IF and EWY.

I have to hold mutuals in some of the family retirement plans and it is a
constant headache since it is very difficult to find great funds, especially
given a limited choice imposed by the plan. Maybe buying S&P500 index now is
not that bad, since it has been falling a lot.

I own APL, TCLP, BBEP, CEP, DPM, EROC, TLP, NS, MMLP, MMP, MWE, and NRGY. Some
of these I purchased based on stock price and others I purchased based on
distribution growth. I'm currently watching XTEX, NGLS, BWP, EPD, PAA, PSE, and

favorite and would purchased more if it continues to fall near 30.

I'll up my position in bdc CODI a little now.

CODI is different from most other bdc's of course in that it takes controlling
interest in the companies in which it makes investments. Which gives them
another way to make money other than by lending it to the companies. That is,
they can control if/when the companies themselves are sold. Which they seem to
be doing successfully.

I'll add a little to my losing position in Trident Microsystems now.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TRID is selling close to cash value (3.88
cash/cash equivalent, with no ltd, per Yahoo; $3.50/sh net cash per Barron's)

Per Barron's, 7/2/08:

"Sales are expected to fall 30% in the fiscal year ending next June, and profit
could fall from 79 cents this year to just seven cents.

Catastrophic, to be sure, and perhaps already stimulating buyers of Trident
stock.

If Trident's new graphics processor can win back some business at manufacturers
such as Samsung and Sony, the appreciation in the stock price would show up
long before any of that turns into sales growth, even while profit is still in
decline.

Meantime, there's a floor for the stock at the current price, says Quinn
Bolton, who follows Trident for Needham & Co.

"The stock is trading in line with cash on the books," he says. "It should be
worth about one times next year's sales, or $6.50, a level typical of depressed
semiconductor company stocks.""

TRID - I guess this is where knowledge of the industry is not necessarily
positive. IMHO, TRID does not have a chance. On the high end, you have NVDA and
ATI/AMD and no one can displace them. They are also pushing into low cost
solutions too, where their name/brand will be quite a cachet. On the low side
you have Intel and no-name-integrated-chip manufacturers. I guess Trident plays
in this sandbox, but Intel can pretty much dump their chips together with their
CPUs, chipsets, etc. Not an area I would want to be in as a company.

I don't have knowledge about their position in the TV chip market though.

That being said, buying profitable (?) company at cash can be a good
investment. I will pass though.
