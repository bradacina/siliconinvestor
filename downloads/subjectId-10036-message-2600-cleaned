Oh yes he does. Now, how about a new pick:

ANK (Atlantic-Tele Network)

Owns Virgin Islands telecom network. The chairman is an interesting
businessman who also has interests in the main newspaper.
This is an interesting stock, trading at about a PE of 7.5
with pretty stable earnings of $1.60/year, but not growing.
Company is using its cash flows to pay off its LT debt. ROE is
up there though, and equity is steadily growing. Now at
a discount to book value. Capital expenditures are a little
high year-in year-out. Anyone want to weigh in a view?

TimbaBear: re TASA. Looks too risky for me. Earnings are relatively poor over
past years, generally steady rev. at about 2M. Now big 66% jump to 3M, but they
are losing money. 22 employees. Can't easily see any reason for anyone to buy
this stock from me at higher than current price I'd be buying now. Also, with
these dollar stocks, I have real trouble trying to sell. Stock goes up 1/2 pt.,
I'm 50% ahead and thinking to get out. Yet, it's only 1/2 point, so I'm tempted
to stay longer. Too long sometimes.
If Napeague guy recommends it, it may be a plus, as he seems to follow his
picks long term and in detail. And yet if you've read some of my other posts
you know I disagree with his methods and almost all of his choices - although I
did like - and shoulda bot - Kaneb year or so ago :>( .
I think you have purchased too much of this co. given what I see as your
portfolio in your profile. Too few stocks means too big a commitment in TASA.
Again my opinion only, and there are other dissenting opinions being presented
on this thread.
TimbaBear: in your analyses and travels, have you ever come across
POSNY? I am trying to get more info. on this company. This is what I have -from
11/03/97 Forbes: "(Lyon's) fund also owns...Peninsular & Oriental. (This
company) owns Princess Cruise Lines, a vast real estate portfolio in the US and
England and one of the world's largest container shipping lines." I like that
"vast real estate" part -g-. But I can't locate any more info. Any help

Re: POSNY

Here's the web site:

Interesting company, but boy it has high ongoing
capital expenditures (exceeding operating net
cash flows for several years now). It looks like
it is selling off its land in North America, which
for now at least is allowing it to get near break
even on its CF after investing cash flows are
accounted for.

Went searching for POSNY web site and got it but Mike beat me to it....have
book-marked it and will look at it a bit later.

We like Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL) for investment purposes....my wife is a
cruise addict and we go on several a year.....I like the cruises but not so
many, it de-focuses me and it takes me a long time to get the ball rolling
again when I get back.....she has found a fellow cruise-a-holic in her mother
and so they are now going to go on some of those together and I will stay home
and work.

Obviously, I drew different conclusions from the TASA data....I think they have
turned the corner and I also believe that a big push is going to be made over
the next few years to raise the literacy levels of our children....will be
timed for the presidential campaign, probably......if I'm right, then literacy
testing will be important.

I think we will see clearer signs of direction when the quarterly report comes
out....should be out by mid-December.....quarter ended on October 31.....will
let you know when I find out

Maybe my position is too large, I don't think it is. It doesn't represent a
huge portion of my retirement planning.....However, I am targeting a very large
rate of return for my portfolio performance....and therefore am willing to
accept some risk.....I feel that risk can be largely affected by diligent
homework.....Berkshire Hathaway doesn't average 20+%/year return by playing the
game super conservatively, they get that kind of return by doing their homework
and then taking large positions based on their findings.....a 10 Billion dollar
investment in the bond market is a lot of eggs :)

I feel that TASA can easily move to $2/share. and probably will do so within
the next 12 months.....I will start taking profits when I feel that they are
fairly valued or when another analysis of the financials leads me to change my
outlook.....I have no problem taking profits, that's the only reason I'm in
this game.

Thank you for taking your time and looking at this company, I will keep you
posted if you want.

TimbaBear and Wink: One thing that stuck with me about "The Intelligent
Investor" is the discussion about stock market effort and the results thereof.
Graham points out something about in any endeavor of work, the more effort, the
greater the expected return. But this is not necessarily true regarding stock
market investing he says. So my comments to you gentlemen or ladies:

1. It's not high school. Doing homework won't necessarily get the grade or
protect you from failing the course here. Although one supposes that doing lots
of research/homework is the way to play the game -- as I've posted before -
I've seen no evidence to show that one's in depth research correlates to one's
stock market gains.

2. Security Analysis -the Book- is just about useless. It's called the Bible of
Security Analysis - and like the Bible, more talked about than read. Regarding
this book (Graham's).... pass. Just my opinion, and I believe I am in the
minority in this position also.

Paul, I appreciate the feedback, and I also have enjoyed your past posts. I
concur that too much work and no play is bad, but at the same time we must do a
certian level of due dilligence. I have invested in the past in just this way.
I find a stock, do my due dilligence and then buy or not. I do this in a "few
days" and don't spend a lot of time researching (I'm not looking to get rich
and have a modest long term goal of 15%). On the other hand, I have very little
knowledge of people such as Graham and Buffet and wish to educate myself, if
only for the purpose of casual conversation (and who knows I might learn
something usefull)! Any suggested readings?

1. "Intelligent Investor"

2. "The Tao (not a typo) Jones Averages - A Guide to Whole-Brained Investing"

3. "Investment Gurus" by Peter Tanous

That's enough to get you started. Mike Burry's thread also mentions a basic
book by somebody I think from Columbia. That would work too.
Then you can branch into niches:
Plenty of Books on Buffett. More and More. Which says something, but I don't
know what.
Dividend Investing: "The Dividend Rich Investor" by Tiger.
Guys who won in '29-34: "48 Years in the Stock Market" (secret book which
nobody knows about -g-. Not in print anymore... sorry couldn't resist
mentioning though.)
Any books by John Train: esp. "The Craft of Investing"
Pring's "Investment Psychology Explained"
Grey: "A Thousand Miles from Wall Street" - easy read. Like Lynch. Only maybe
better.

My opinion: If you are starting out. Learn from people what will work for the
average investor. Because you are an average investor. Therefore emphasis on
what Graham or Train say. Deemphasize anything which average investor would
lose at: no options, no day trading, no trading at all -g-. No genius stuff
that can't be replicated by others. IMO deemphasize (for now) Buffett and
maybe, maybe Lynch too. You will be able to tell more about direction you
should take - in reading and investing -after you've read first 3 books.

Although I was an excellent student when I wanted to be, it took discipline for
me to also be good when I didn't want to be.......Homework in investing, for
me, included 5 years of paper-trading, reading incredible amounts of thoughts,
strategies, money management techniques, etc., etc., etc.......all to get
myself to the point where I was ready to confuse myself!!!!

As I indicated in one of my posts, the ultimate test of research and theory,
for me in this arena, is what are the results??? I don't feel the pressure of
fear, anxiety, nervousness and trepidation because it's only my lifestyle in
retirement ( or lack thereof ) that's at stake here!!!!

I call it a "game" because that's the way I speak but believe me, I am no less
concerned about results than anyone who may call it "investing"

I feel that we are in a market unlike any that I have seen as far the rates of
return that are achievable for the astute stock picker. I want to "make hay
while the sun shines" in this market and gain higher returns, so that when it
turns and I'm unable to achieve other than single digit returns, the average
over time will still be impressive.....lofty goals which make me feel kind of
like some kind of upstart, brash young kid!!! I haven't felt that way in a lot

Paul - there is a book about the history of UHAL. Current management makes
sense after you read it. My 'best' investments have always come in 'hometown'
companies, because I can find better information than money center analysts can
provide. The beauty of the net is that it should enable you to enlarge the
boundaries of your hometown. For instance with UHAL, someone on here from
Phoenix should be able to shed light on Shoen. I giggle every time I go to an
annual meeting where I'm the only one asking questions of management. If you go
prepared, it's amazing how many times these folks will lay out the future for
you. But you need to have done your homework to interpret their answers.

For those who think they can't match the genius of a Peter Lynch, try opening a
$100 savings account at your local mutual S+L. How many years has it been since
someone lost money investing in a converted mutual? BTW, all of them in
California are gone, except for one.

I prefer Graham-Dodd 1940 and 1951. 1934 has been reprinted, the one with
Cottle is useless. Buffett plays in a different league. His information sources
and access to capital are infinitely better than mine. These days he gets
companies to do things his way. I always ask CEO's why they can't write an
annual report like BH or Wesco. Usually I get a blank stare!!!

Re: books

To get started, I'd suggest the following four books:

The Intelligent Investor by Graham
Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Fisher
Why Stocks Go Up and Down By Pike
Buffettology by Buffett and Clark

If you read these books thoroughly and in that order and
never touch another book, you'll have all you need to know.
Another book you might want to consider is Value Investing
Made Easy by Janet Lowe - a quick read. I have
a fairly extensive listing of books on my site, with my

My problem is I've read way too much. One book stated, "If
you're not a voracious reader, you'll probably never be
a great investor." But sometimes I wish I had a more
focused knowledge base so that my investment strategy wouldn't
get all cluttered up.

Re: Security Analysis you can get a lot of the same info
in a more accessible format elsewhere, but everyone says
that Buffett's favorite version is the 1951 edition. Yes
there are differences, and the current version has a lot
of non-Graham like stuff in it.

IMO - ANK will be taken over by someone, likely CWP.

CWP and HKT are well worth looking at for telecoms. CWP has a major interest in
HKT. CWP has management problems but strong possibles for a merger with ATT or
Sprint. HKT selling at a good PE, have huge cash reserves, and big potential in
mainland. Some say their investment in Taiwan might be a problem, but Taiwan is
investing in the mainland so I discount this concern. CWP has little risk as
they are well diversified, but I think the long term investment would be the
HKT. Off it's highs and fairly attractive at <15PE. If it'll just stay there
until I can find some cash!

Re: starter books

My problem with Lynch's books is that he didn't use those
techniques, near as I can tell, when he was leading Magellan
to those winning years.

He relied on personal visits with CEOs of major firms, a
direct line to anyone he wanted, a massive Fidelity research
group, and the last thing on his mind was value. His turnover
was incredibly high, and he often made decisions without
he himself having fully analyzed the situation. He describes
himself as patient with a turnover of 110%. But that's better
than his initial 300%.

He was very good at it, but to say buy restaurants because you
like the sandwich they serve is misleading and dangerous advice to a
beginner. Especially for someone who doesn't first understand Graham
and Buffett ultra-conservative long-term fundamental analysis.

After reading the first four books, I think Lynch's books are good for
those that want to know why they shouldn't just throw out the
auto stocks or airlines or other things that Buffett for instance
dislikes. They are also very good reading, and I think everyone
should ultimately read at least one (my fav is Beating the Street).

Just my opinion,

Also, don't forget to read every word by WB's alterego and co-chairman, Charlie

On December 2nd, Touchstone Applied Sciences (NASDAQ:TASA)
announced that its children's reading web site is now operational. This
web site is the core of an exciting new Internet product called
BookMatch(TM).

TASA's new product seems to have many of the elements needed for
success:

- There appears to be a high level of "consumer demand" for a
product of this type.

- The Internet is becoming more accepted as a method of
distributing specialized services to consumers.

- BookMatch is known to be effective - TASA is already
successfully marketing its various elements to to the educational
community.

- The product is competitively priced versus the other alternatives
available to parents.

- It is highly likely that BookMatch will be a quite profitable for the
Company.

Each of these points is discussed in a bit more depth on the Napeague
web site at http://www.napeague.com . It is clear that if BookMatch
is successful it will have a major impact on the Company's earnings.

TASA offers its customers a very impressive core product line - a
series of sophisticated standardized reading tests and supporting tools.
There is strong evidence that indicates that these tools are dramatic
improvements over those offered by competitors. These measurement
tools are very well accepted by educators at all levels, and are even
used at the college level, by universities such as Old Dominion and
Purdue.

In addition, the Company has just made two acquisitions which appear
to make sense; they were completed at the right price and they both fit
into TASA's core business. Since this basic industry is highly
fragmented, if TASA maintains a sufficiently strong balance sheet, it
can make additional beneficial acquisitions, especially if its stock price
rises to reflect its underlying value. As a result, TASA could continue
to grow quite rapidly.

It appears that its management has confidence in TASA, since there
has been a substantial amount of insider buying during the last several
months. According to Form 4s filed with the Securities &
Exchange Commission, in late June a member of the Board of
Directors purchased 42,000 shares and in July the Chairman and one
of the Company's Vice Presidents purchased a total of almost 41,000
shares.

An in-depth Analysis of TASA can be found on the Napeague Web
Site at http://www.napeague.com . I encourage you to read the entire
Analysis as well as the Company's investor relations information and

Marlton Technologies (AMEX:MTY) is a financially strong and
rapidly growing Company, which has just announced the latest in a
long series of strong quarterly results, and a key acquisition which
could accelerate its growth and carry it to $100 million in revenues by
1998.

To quote the press release announcing MTY's third quarter financial
results, "Operating profit rose to $406,925 for the third quarter of
1997 as compared to $212,221, an increase of 90%. While earnings
per share on net income of $322,021 was $0.06 as compared to net
income of $163,478 or $0.03 per share, an increase of 100%. The
Company also noted that its backlog at the end of the third quarter was
more than double the prior year's backlog."

MTY has been on a rapid growth track for several years, yet its stock
is still undervalued by the market. While the Business Services
segment currently has a PE multiple of 36, MTY is at a PE of 20
although its profits are growing three times as rapidly as those of the
segment as a whole.

On Thursday, June 26th MTY announced its planned acquisition of
DMS Store Fixtures, one of the larger companies in this segment. The
Napeague Letter has carried out a preliminary Analysis of this deal
which indicates that it may be quite beneficial to MTY shareholders.

These two businesses are quite similar in many ways and should lead
to a strong partnership. They both use similar technologies and skill
bases, and many of their products are quite similar. DMS could
provide MTY with entry into an industry with strong growth
opportunities, and MTY can provide DMS with greater geographic
distribution.

Marlton Technologies, Inc.(AMEX:MTY)custom designs and
manufactures sophisticated trade show exhibits, displays, architectural
and museum interiors, graphics and signage, and provides trade show
services under the name "Sparks Exhibits".

An in-depth Analysis of MTY can be found on the Napeague Web Site

John Harris: thought some more about Phil Fisher's books. I have read them all.
I guess I'll have to review them again. I say now his books are not useful for
the beginner here on SI. Because:
1. He recommends very thorough research including knowledge of management.
2. He recommends or advocates holding the chosen stock "forever".
3. This means the investor can only understand and own a few companies.
4. His record is not public. He's had some excellent results of course with TI
and MOT, but I'm not so sure of his FMC.

Yes, this method works for Fisher and maybe for others and maybe the body of
knowledge of investing is based on some of his work, but for somebody starting
out... these methods are not really how the average investor wants to invest
or, given that there are other methodologies, needs to invest. JMO, Paul Senior

How about De Beers (NASDAQ:DBRSY) - South African Diamond monopoly? They are
selling very close to or below book value (I believe). Aside from the normal
foreign investment problems (currency, politics, etc.), there are two concerns.

The first concern is Southeast Asia. Japan and other Southeast Asia are large
consumers of industrial diamonds used for manufacturing. Also, Japan is also a
large consumer of diamonds used in jewelry. This problem is clearly temporary.

The second concern is that "cracks" are showing up in their control over their
monopoly. Recently, diamonds from Russia have been sold on the open market (not
through their marketing organization, called the CSO) and some Australian mines
have elected to sell their directly. There has also been a big discovery of
diamonds found in northern Canada - it has been estimated that this source
could provide upto 20% of the worlds diamonds in 2002. How these diamonds will
be sold remains to be decided. However, it's pretty clear that a price war
won't benefit anyone - think of the attraction of a $100 wedding ring. So, its
unlikely that selling prices will dramatically change in any event. And the CSO
has been challenged before.

Unique position. Track record. Reasonable dividend. Brand name. I'd really like
a second opinion. For information, try starting at:

It was constantly choking my modem/browser. The problem happened at another

same results. Maybe I have a Windows glitch. Went to a new, faster modem, and
the problem just occurred faster and more often. Too bad, too. I liked the

Re: CREAF

I don't see anything to worry about. I still haven't bought it
but I'm tempted. After buying Cambridge, it still has $4.25/sh
($400M), which means the enterprise is trading at only 6.8
times the run rate on last quarter's earnings, and the company
is now in its strongest quarter of the year. The company has
been very positive with me in my discussions. There is no
debt, and cash flows are very strong. There is a franchise
in the Soundblaster brand, and it has a new line of merchandise
based on the latest chip. Heck, if the company can simply
maintain it's current level of sales and earnings, the
earnings yield is over 15%.

Everyone is talking about the computer makers trying to speed
up the development of a media chip that does sound in order
to make ever cheaper systems. But most people I know like
the upgradability of separate cards in their system. I feel
the media chips will be useful mostly in laptops.

Soundblaster brand is on the block for only about 1.2B, which
is roughly sales despite 50% ROE.

QNTM, which is getting absolutely massacred for no reason,
now at about 24. It has the world supply on the next gen
MR head componentry, has a potent product in its DLT line,
and is now at a PE under 10, with a high amount of its
expenses in R&D. ROE about 30%.

OXHP, which is getting massacred as well, now down another
10+% today because the CEO didn't show for an analysts'
meeting. At $21, it is steal by every measure
I can come up with except management credibility, which
is getting thin.

Green Tree (GNT), which has been very successful, now is
getting slammed because customers prepaid too many loans.
IOW, the loans are higher quality than we thought, so
let's slam the stock. Doesn't make sense, but now the
stock is back at $30 from $50.

DSWLF, which Ron has been researching a lot, is also at
a single digit PE, albeit that is its historic norm. But
it is growing now, generating cash, and seems pretty well

I didn't get onto the web until now, so I just now read your post from this
morning.

I have done some thinking about gold and about mining companies and about
owning one or the other......

The first thing I would say is that I think the market's approach to gold is
shifting. The old paradigm was that gold provided asset security in uncertain
political/economic times. Central banks used gold reserves to bolster
confidence in their currencies. Gold also provided one with a sign of affluence
when used in jewelery and coins, etc.

I don't think that paradigm is still completely intact.

I think the globalization of the financial sectors has resulted in a
standardization that is beginning to exert it's own pressure toward a feeling
of security.....for example, when the IMF steps in and has their loan accepted,
they impose world-wide standards on the country involved and the rest of the
financial markets breathe a sigh of relief.....I know that this is a very
simplified version of the events,but I believe it captures the essence of what
I am trying to say.

This standardization has served to decrease the reliance on gold as a backdrop
for currencies, and I think that CB selling of reserves is confirmation of this
thinking.

There is still a steady, to increasing, demand for gold, but I think the
emphasis has shifted more toward being a commodity.

Central bank selling has masked, to some extent, the increase in demand because
they are flooding the market with their supplies. This has created a bit of
oversupply which has driven price down. This is resulting in smaller, less
efficient companies being consolidated and more costly mines being closed. It
is also resulting in more cost-effective measures being implemented at the
remaining mines. So what has been happening is a decreasing supply from mining
and a lowering in the cost per ounce to produce.

If I'm right with my thinking, then the question, for me, becomes: " Is the
timing right to buy now?"

I don't think so.......I still think there is oversupply from central bank
selling and I want to wait and see how Japan finances their way out of their
current problems.....they could sell US Treasuries.....or they could sell
gold.....if they sell gold, we have not come close to seeing the bottom yet.

However, I still think that I want to invest in the stock of a good company
when I think the timing is right......my research has led me to think that
Barrick (ABX) is the way I will choose.....they have the lowest production cost
per ounce in the Western Hemisphere, they are making money at these levels,
they are increasing sales in these conditions and they are beginning to look
real attractively priced.

My opinions and 40 cents will get you a cup of coffee.......in some places!

Maybe I looked at the DD industry for too long,
but the current picture is far from pretty. The industry
is commodity cyclical, and we are in the down cycle.
It's not clear how long the down cycle will last.
Assuming persisting overcapacity, and price war, some
companies may even go out of business. That is the worst
case. The best case is a quick rebound. I do not see
a way to check whether a bottom has been reached and
whether the cycle is going to turn soon. As you realize,
PE for cyclical companies at the beginning of a down cycle
is meaningless. One might argue that low PSRs indicate
value, but it's far from obvious.

Regarding QNTM, the only reasonable suggestion
that I saw, was to value its DLT business as separate
entity and to subtract the foreseeable losses in DD
business. That might give an indication of "bottom"
value.

Anyway, I am always leery to invest in
commodities. You know the disadvantages...
And it's always difficult to figure out the
strongest of the pack. Having said that,
I am gambling a bit on WFR - another cyclical
commodity company. WFR trades at book and
looks like its closer to the upturn in the cycle.
The negative is that all competitors are foreign - no
info available. Also WFR has quite a bit of leverage.
Do your own research.

Good luck

Commodity base metal companies have always sold at P/E's that made traditional

P/E's as a measure of how cheap they are.

Raimondas,

My feeling on Quantum is that long-term, it is no longer just
a DD company. In fact, already 40% of earnings are DLT and
that is growing at a 100% rate. This moves it out of the
commodity category, IMO. Note that it did not disappoint at
all last quarter, when both WDC and SEG were very disappointing.
IR has communicated to me that they feel no need to offer
additional earnings guidance - they just had an analysts meeting
at Comdex and could've done it there if it was overly bad.
In any case, I expect them to miss by a bit, and if they do,
I'll buy more. Then again, I have a bit of inside indusry
knowledge that is making me a little cocky here.

But his point about paying for DLT and subtracting for DD is well taken. It is
like buying a house which you may tear down on a nice piece of land. You pay
the value of the land less the cost of tearing the house down.

I would appreciate your analysis of the value of QNTM if done on that
basis. Is it cheap yet by that standard. How would you compare the valuation
with SEG?

From:Michael Burry

Sales of DLT - 1.4 billion
Profits from DLT - 240 million
Current Market Cap - 3.25 billion

So it is selling at 13.5 times this year'searnings of the DLT
business and 2.3 times sales. This is very reasonable, when you
consider they have a near monopoly on the product and the media,
and that those sales have gone from $100M to 1.4 billion in
less than 3 years. A tech company growing that quickly with
that type of market dominance might conservatively command a
market value of 20 times earnings, or 4.8 billion ($35/share).
This is also what several analysts have projected for the
DLT business, which tells me I'm not too far off.

But you have the DD too. Even if I give you that the business
is cyclical, it is still 5 billion in sales for the company,
which at a bare minimum has got to be worth .25 of sales, or
1.2B, so add that to the DLT business, and you get 6 billion
or $44/share.

I understand Quantum's management to be the best and the
most forward-looking among the dd's, and it roped in this
exclusive deal with MKE for MR technology. Quantum believes
it is 6-8 mos ahead of the competition in the MR arena.
So I would assign it's dd business a premium over SEG and
WDC.

Now, my contact is a former SEG VP who likes SEG, but grudgingly
says QNTM is better positioned now. SEG has $7 in cash, but
is fully exposed to the DD cycle. It has interesting investments
and I certainly like it too, but I don't know how to value it
given QNTM's lead in DD technology now.

So IMO, QNTM's high in the low 40's was around fair value for
the company. There will be charges of around 35M, but the market
has overreacted. Short-term, it may go lower on tax-loss selling
and institutional window-dressing (I certainly wouldn't want a
"DD" in my end-of-the-year portfolio if I was using that portfolio
as a marketing tool). But long-term, it is at nearly a 50%
discount currently, which will widen with greater contribution
and diversification of products along the high-end backup lines.

But, is there anything that says the DD industry will cycle back in some
reasonable fashion?

It used to be that a typical home user would need more disk than came with a
machine. Now with a fast CD-ROM and 2GB+ being the standard "shipped"
configuration, the home user is rarely going to run out and buy a new disk
drive at any time some. No need for me to put everything on my disk - large
data files stay on the CD-ROM, or I better still, I pull info off the net.

So then, you have the corporate users who are still buying high-end drives
(e.g. 2 Gb+, SCSI). This is the area where QNTM and SEG compete and WDC
doesn't. In my opinion, there is inevitably going to be a shift to thin clients
in the corporate arena. Networks are getting faster, and maintenence costs of
traditional clients are too expensive. That definitely cuts a lot of disk
drives out. Sure I have my 200GB server - say 20 disks in an array - but I've
eliminated say 300 disk drives on everyone's workstation (storing the same 300
copies of Windows!). Let's see - where I would've bought 300 drives, I now need
only 20. How will that affect profit-margins and competition? The same argument
goes for tape drives.

Granted, these changes will occur slowly, but I think that the long-term
outlook for this industry is really poor. These businesses are not really
"cheap" for a low-margin, shrinking, commodity businesses - they have just come
down from a point of being over-valued. All these stocks are still thought of
as "technology" stocks. But, none of the companies actually has too much in the
way of a defensible technology position with which other's cannot compete. I
believe at some point that the industry will stablize, but I can't predict who
will come out on top, what the margins will be, and what a reasonable industry
P/E will be.

FWIW, IMHO facts fly in the face of reason: retailers will tell you that the
<1K PC's are what are pushing market penetration today. (And BTW the Presario

capturing bloated code, the subzero buyer returns for a new HD. Prices are
coming down, volumes will continue to climb. Hierarchical storage is an
interesting concept, but it ain't here yet.

The DLT market is also interesting. It's dominating the tape backup segment,
and is controlled by QNTM. However as the storage goes toward library format, I
wonder about its very design - ie, as it is being read, the tape is removed
from its spool. How long do you think it will take for other 8mm competitors to
figure out that in a library configuration it is much faster to be able to
enter and exit the tape mid-stream? Sony seems to have picked up the idea in
AIT. IMHO the big time storage world will be very different 12 mo from now.

Yes, I do agree that Quantum is the pick of the bunch. And I'll admit that the
shift to thin clients will actually be much slower than many expect (anyone
buying into a thin client company can attest to that). I'm not saying that hard
drives will fall off the earth - just that it has the potential to become a
negative growth industry in terms of revenue/net income.

The Forbes article seems to imply that Quantum is the only source of media.
That's not true - Maxell, Fuji among others supply product. A little deceptive
is the capacity (70 GB is probably the compressed format - 35 GB is native). In
this respect, the current DLT technology is more of a medium-size backup media.
Sony's AIT tape drives should compete with Quantum's DLT, and Sony's technology
is more advanced in some areas. Also, Sony has published a long term plan to
increase capacity.

Still, the market for tape products should remain robust. I've heard estimates
in excess of 30% CAGR for this type of tape drive. And Quantum is certainly
well positioned. But the question remains whether a disk drive business
shrinking at say 5 to 10% a year, can be overcome by a tape drive business
expanding at 30% a year.

Don't get me wrong, there's a price at which Quantum would be attractive to me,
and it's not too far below the current price. I just see a lot of uncertainty,
and think that the mutiple at which I would sell would be lower.

Jeffery,

Thanks for the compliment. I see two simple trends.

The first is that GaAs (galium arsenide) technology companies have better long
term growth prospects (operation at higher speeds), and experience less
dramatic changes in demand due to their exclusivity. Smaller companies involved
in this area include Vitesse (VTSS), Anadigics (ANAD) and Triquint (TQNT).

The second trend is toward more highly integrated chips ("System-on-a-chip").
Inevitable because it reduces cost of product so dramatically. I think that it
may take some time to actually become popular because of the engineering skills
required (perhaps picking up toward the end of 1998). LSI Logic (LSI) is well
positioned in this area. If I recall correctly, VLSI Technology (VLSI) also has
some technology. Toshiba & some other large Japanese companies are also heavily
involved.

I don't see any pure Graham-style value plays at this point, but I haven't
really been looking hard. I have very little experience with regard to
accurately timing the market. You may be able to look for a pickup in the EDA
vendor Synopsis' (SNPS) market should system-on-a-chip take off.

A "junk" convertible preferred stock yielding 14.5%

I have followed Family Bargains preferred over two years, and over this time
the company has paid regular cash dividends on the preferred even though
reporting losses quarter after quarter.

The company owns a chain of retail apparel outlets in the West, SW & Texas.

Two things going for this preferred-FBARP.

An investor group poured in millions in cash in the last year (and took
control) in exchange for another class of preferred stock with lesser priority.

Second, the company finally reported a profitable quarter (after preferred
dividends). So it may be ready to turn around.

This ain't no blue chip or high tech, but 14.5% yield in cash does not seem too
bad. Sage opinions sought.

Michael,

Thanks for your QNTM DLT analysis. I don't
disagree with your approach, though I would
not add anything for QNTMs DD business at this time.
I would caution that 50-100% DLT growth won't continue
indefinitely. Do you follow other tape drive companies
(EXBT?, HWP?, MMM?) and their progress in the area?

I will be watching the DD companies and might buy at some
point. If you follow QNTM thread, you'll find enough bulls
there. I think that you have one of the better approaches
to the DD area. The mindless approaches: "It's going out of
business - SELL!", or "It's WAY undervalued - BUY!"
do not work.

I've been through semiequip downcycle, where
ASYT and AMAT yielded 4-5 baggers while TRKN and
SUBM were victims. I've looked at the networker drop this
spring where BAY and CSCO came back, but
SHVA did not. Finding winners in a cyclical drop
is difficult, unless you buy acknowledged leaders that
are almost never cheap (CSCO, AMAT, INTC, MSFT).

I am a little frustrated with the monthly trading
necessary with tech stocks. I am starting to
appreciate Buffett's buy-and-hold of great companies.
The tech stocks are no buy-and-holds - with
very few exceptions like CSCO, INTC, MSFT.

Here is my latest tech stock investing approach:

If you ask yourself, "Should I sell?" - You should.
If you ask yourself, "Should I buy?" - You shouldn't.

:-))))

It works even better if you elaborate:

If you ask yourself, "Should I sell to take a profit?"
- You should.

But what if I miss the BIG run-up?

- You won't.
- Leave 50 shares in a sock.

If you ask yourself, "Should I buy?"
- You should... 20 points lower.

But what if I miss the GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY?

- You won't.
- Wait. Even GREATER BUYING OPPORTUNITY will happen
in... 3 months
- Buy 50 shares and get a night's sleep.

:-)))

Good luck

re: highly integrated chip companies

Do you have an opinion on Cirrus Logic (CRUS)? They recently announced a shift
of focus for their PC products division toward <$1K computers with chips that
contain integrated audio, graphics and modem capabilities:
http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/971117/cirrus_logic_2_1.html

They have missed earnings in the past and have restructured shuffling division,
laying off employees and changing board members. It looks like they might have
turned a corner and are well-positioned for 1998. There is much focus on the PC
products division but the other three divisions have been growing nicely. Any
comments welcome. I own CRUS at avg price of ~$12.

Mike, James, etc., I also made use of this time to avg down my price of OXHP to
~$22. Looking forward to some good numbers from that one.

Finally, my question regarding when to sell: I own a company named Tyco (TYC) a
diversified manufacturing, home safety, undersea cable company (try to find a
core business in there! <g>). They have recently completed four major
acquisitions (accretive to earnings) and some smaller ones. I have made a nice
profit in less than a year but feel that the management is capable and will
grow the company in years to come. However, it is now a bit too large for me to
comfortably evaluate. Granted, I wish all my problems were of his sort but I am
open to advice.

John,

I really don't have an opinion on CRUS. The chipset/reference design looks
interesting and it targets a reasonable pricepoint. But, I can't really tell
whether it's going to be a success without comparing it with everyone else's
chipsets.

What I meant, when I mentioned companies like LSI, was to try avoid companies
that depend on the acceptance of "pre-packaged" design chips, and to look at
companies that are able to partner with customers to supply larger ASIC designs
(>1,000,000 gates). This is the logical next step after FPGAs and simpler
ASICs. This means that ASIC engineers are going to be able to create their own
chips that include a custom processor, RAM, Flash, and specialized peripherals
all on one chip. Once an infrastructure is setup to do this easily, the process
should really should save money in end products. The costs of developing the
ASIC are NRE, and every dollar saved in hardware (over designs with separate
process, RAM, etc.) can translate into $3 to $6 in consumer cost savings for a
companies with reasonable margins. A fully-integrated ASIC design can save you
$20-$50 in a design for a device like a set-top box.

Some of them do. I think that current bull
market was extremely helpful for tech companies.
All of them IPO'ed or refinanced their debt
through secondaries, tertiaries, etc. So most of
them have healthy balance sheets and almost
none of them face an immediate threat of bankruptcy.
In a less healthy market, some companies would be
already under.

Let's agree that QNTM seems to have brighter
future than the rest of DD pack. It's everybody's
own call at which price and when to buy it.

To change the topic, did you ever look at UM.
It has incredible margins and free cash flows. Even
running on two-and-a-half legs after Baxter pullout they
repurchased 25% (?) of their shares. The annual
reports are very well written. If the company
gets back on three or four legs, the upside should be good.
Do you have any opinion about them?

Thank you. Maybe we could also add DSP to your short list. I was especially
interested in your view of overall semiconductor industry
revenue growth. (I should have been more specific.) We see these projections of
continued substantial industry growth. That is certainly supported by the two
comments I made about increasing penetration of all products and expanded use
by China type countries.
However, we also have the trend of combining several chips into one and
declining prices. Also, we may eventually reach a point where most home
computer users have met their needs for the forseeable future.
(I just took a quantum leap with my cable modem service and do not see any
other unmet needs for quite a while.) I do not have the knowledge base to
assess the credibility of what I read. You seem to.

Could you speculate as to why ARW and AVT (the leading electronics

Jeffrey,

One of the best places for information about the semiconductor industries is
the EETimes (http://www.eetimes.com). I saw their estimate for CAGR of 18.6%
(1996 through 2002) in the following article:

http://www.techweb.com/se/directlink.cgi?EET19970630S0038

which seems to be reasonable. I'm generally a bottom-up investor and look more
at specific companies. I understand that you see more integrated chips,
decreasing costs, etc. But don't forget that there's going to be a real
increase in complexity of devices and there are going to be changes in consumer
demand. I bought a $200 1200baud modem in 1985 - it now sells for maybe $1 -
but a 56K modem costs about $100 too, and more people bought the 56K's than the
1200 baud. Also, the semiconductor industry is larger that the PC. If PCs slow,
there'll be an interactive set-top box, or a collision detector for your car,
or a wristwatch with the built-in telephone, or something else.

I like DSPs (hey, I even programmed DSP's a few years ago). But I don't see a
real way to invest directly in DSP. In consumer electronics, standalone,
general-purpose DSPs are becoming less common. More often, they're included as
a core in an specialized IC (for example, you modem probably contains a DSP).
The people who design the core get some royalties/fee but most likely these
people are Texas Instruments, Motorola, or Analog Devices. Big companies, so
there is no real pure play. There have been some niche players in the DSP core
business, but with the competition from the big companies, I don't see anything
compelling.

As far as ARW and AVT, I can only guess. These companies are quite diversified
in terms of what, where, and to whom they sell. So they can probably weather
minor down turns in any individual areas quite well. Also, as long as they can
signup enough new suppliers, they can continue to grow the business. Look at
ARW for the past 6 years - profit margins fixed at 2%-3%, its the top line that
provides all the growth. I suspect that they actually might benefit somewhat
from a drop in the prices of parts that they import from Southeast Asia (I
suspect that these companies would be net importers from SE Asia). AVT also set
a stock buyback.

Thanks Stew -

I have been trying to figure out how a domestic seller of imported parts from
Asia would do. Would, or would not, the units sold increase
faster than the price went down - leading to a net revenue/margin
increase? A desperate Asian exporter, whose costs have gone down a lot in
dollar terms (whereas the US importer's have not) can afford to cut the price
of a dollar priced product a lot and still come out ahead. The US importer is
not so fortunate and I am not sure they would benefit.

I believe the concern over domestic tech mfrs is that exports to Asia would be
expected to drop and margins on products sold in US would be squeezed by
competition from lower priced imports. (However, I was only addressing above
the situation of a domestic importer.)

From:GREATMOOD

To All:
I'm posting this here because I believe Matria Healthcare (MATR) to be a
value/growth story for the following reasons.

Matria Healthcare just completed a major restructuring, and the new management
is very concerned about maximizing shareholder value.

Up until recently, Matria's focus has been on administering the Fetal
Fibronectin (fFn) test to identify women with a high risk for premature birth
and then monitoring them through their pregnancy and administering tocolytic
therapy (trying to bring the baby to full term inside the mother by delaying
premature labor.)

Physicians never really adopted the practice of routinely prescribing the fFn
test, and then Adeza sued Matria for not trying hard enough to get physicians
to routinely prescribe the test. The lawsuit didn't help the marketing effort,
and as it stands now, Fetal Fibronectin accounts for only approximately 2% of
Matria's 1997 revenues! This is why I believe that in the worst case scenario,
the Adeza lawsuit is no longer the significant event that it was once perceived
to be!

The only drug on the market that underwent FDA testing to delay intra-uterine
contractions is Ritrodine. Doctor's have discovered that another drug
Terbutaline, usually prescribed for asthma patients, had the effect of
inhibiting labor with less serious side effects than Ritrodine. For about 15
years, Terbutaline has been the medical profession's drug of choice for
tocolytic therapy, and Matria administers the drug when the woman's physician
prescribes it. By the way, when Matria administers Terbutaline in the mother's
home, they use a "pump" system that has FDA approval. The pump allows a smaller
dosage of the drug to be delivered to the patient than if she was to take it
orally. It is widely known that Ritrodine and Terbutaline have side effects.
Matria monitors these patients by telephonically connecting them to a nursing
station.

The above story is basically what the "Street" knows about Matria. The
analyst's estimates of $0.41 this year, $0.55 next year, and $0.71 in 1999 are
conservative estimates based upon the status quo of Matria's current
operations. If there were to be no new sources of additional revenue, Matria is
still cheap because they generate free cash flow from ongoing operations. It is
estimated that in 1998 they will have $1.00/ share in cash!

Now let's look at some potential opportunies for revenue growth and share price
appreciation.

1) There are over 400,000 pre-term births every year, and Matria only services
24,000 (6%), leaving a large untapped potential market.

2) There is a new Tocolytic drug awaiting FDA approval that can to a large
extent replace Terbutaline as the treatment of choice. The drug is manufactured
by Johnson & Johnson. The drug's name is Antocin (formerly Atosiban). It will
have fewer side effects than either Ritrodine or the more commonly prescribed
Terbutaline. Approval could come as early as the first quarter of 98.

This could be a huge growth story for Matria. Prematurity is a major
contributor to infant illness and death. If the Johnson & Johnson product
receives approval, physicians would have a much safer way to prescribe
tocolytic therapy, and Matria would benifit greatly. Antocin will have behind
it the marketing power of Johnson & Johnson which is comparable to having the
Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. Women at risk and their physicians would
then have a much better option to delay premature labor for the health of their
unborn child. Furthermore, the relative safety of the new therapy could further
validate the maternal homecare industry.

3) Management has begun to turn Matria from a "one trick pony" into a
diversified business that derives revenues from several different sources. In a
November 26,1997 Wall Street Journal article, Matria was mentioned favorably as
a player in the emerging $2 billion dollar a year Fertility Industry! Matria is
the 3rd largest fertility provider in the U.S. In 1997 it is estimated that 11%
of revenues will come from their fertility business! Matria plans on opening
2-3 new fertility centers next year, and this emerging growth industry can
substantially add to future revenues. One approach to fertility service is to
use fertility drugs that can result in multiple births. Matria doesn't do that.
Matria provides those couples who don't want to have quadruplets, quintuplets,
etc., with an approach that results in the birth of one child. In addition,
Matria is the first fertility company that offers a money -back guarantee.

4) Matria will be entering a brand new high margin business that offers great
synergy with their maternity monitoring business. Matria will be providing
insulin therapy homecare to women with acute gestational diabetes. Matria spent
over 2 years to develop a proprietary system to manage gestational diabetes.
The initial test program was successful and the service will be available
nationwide in all 70 of their markets by March of next year. Gestational
diabetes is a very serious condition that must be aggressively managed.
Currently this $100 million dollar market is owned by hospitals. Matria is in a
position to capture a significant share of this market.

5) Another significant catalyst to drive the share price higher is the
expression of management to be in favor of instituting a significant share
buy-back program with their excess cash flow. The CEO and COO both support this
form of maximizing shareholder value because they view the stock price as being
significantly undervalued. This will be discussed at the February 98 board
meeting and it is anticipated that an announcement about the share buy-back
program will be forthcoming.

To sum up, the earnings estimates going forward do not include any additional
potential revenues form Antocin. This product can contribute substantially to
Matria's topline revenues, and because Matria's infrastructure is already
largely in place, go straight to the bottom line earnings!

Matria now has $20 million dollars in cash and by next year they will have $36
million dollars in cash. With 36 million shares outstanding, that means that if
you buy Matria at 5 1/2, by next year you will get $1.00/share in cash. In
other words you will be paying $4 1/2 dollars for a stock that will
conservatively earn $0.55 cents in 98. What I'm saying is that you can buy a
growth company with a forward looking 1998 P/E of 8 !!!! The P/E gets even
lower as the above potential revenue "drivers" kick in. This undervalued stock,
in my opinion, can be a home run!

I hope you find this information useful,
Happy Investing

The actual price of flash chips is probably going to fall somewhat like DRAM.
The Japanese manufacturers are going to shift resources away from lower margin
DRAM:

http://www.techweb.com/se/directlink.cgi?EET19970120S0037

That said, one would think that a flash card manufacturer, link SanDisk, should
be independant of those price drops. I would think it would remain robust for
some years because of the consumer demand for non-volatile storage. Look at
their recent release for Compaq:

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/971117/sandisk_compaq_1.html

There's no reason that a consumer buying a 10Mb flash disk won't want higher
capacity disks as the handheld and their applications improve in usability and
flexibility.

FLSHF is interesting, because it stresses the larger capacity flash disks. It
talks about capacities beyond 50Mb, but if you look at the cost of those
devices right now, you're talking about a lot of money, if their 8 Mb chip goes
for $56, what are those higher capacity chips going for. Don't get me wrong,
they have definite market in some mission critical applications where cost is
not an object and the MTBF of a mechanical disk is too low. And they seem to
have some very good embedded motherboard manufacturers signed up. For the
longer term, I'd really look carefully at how they're business would change if
flash producers dropped prices to a 1/4 of what they are today.

I bumped into to a friend of mine in the HMO/Health Insurance industry
today. As I said before, I still recommend avoiding Oxford. Colossal
mismanagement and the ethical questions regarding insider selling would be
enough for me. But add on top the fact that premium rate guarantees cause it to
take quite some time to get all of your prices to where they need to be. That's
assuming you know where they need to be, which I would not assume is the case
here, because they lost control of the data (as a consequence of their not
billing and collecting premiums properly as well as serious claims problems).

With 30 years of experience in this industry, I am telling the folks on this
thread that if you lose control of the data you have a real problem. What
happens most often is that you find out you need an oversized rate increase.
Your future then becomes very difficult to predict. Whenever, you put in larger
rate increases than your peers, an increased number of your customers will shop
around. It is difficult to predict who you will lose, but on average it tends
to be companies with better than average claims experience recently. That can
leave you with a book of business where the rate increase you got is not enough
- and with those rates guaranteed for a year you have another year of
inadequate pricing.

I would not trust any earnings projection. I know for a fact that the NY/NJ
market has been a difficult one for some competitors for years.

Jeffrey, re: OXHP

<<I am telling the folks on this thread that if you lose control of the
data you have a real problem. >>

Yes, but we already know they had a real problem to the tune of
>$90M hit to the balance sheet. Rather than a rate increase,
Oxford charged it off the balance sheet. Check with Oxford -
their rates are still among the most reasonable in the area,
and they have no plans to increase rates to make up the AR
charge or the AP charge. They've just swallowed it, however
painful.
This contrasts directlly with, say Aetna's attempts to force
contracts of adhesion on its doctors. When many doctors have
a real problem with a plan, the AMA knows about it, and hence
I should know about it. The Oxford mess was not a big issue at the
AMA as far as I know.

Just from the physician feedback I've received, Oxford seems
to have had a better reputation than most of being attuned
to doctor's needs than most. In the last year this has been
tainted by the claims delays, but in general physicians have
found Oxford to be understanding and innovative in their plans.
And they did advance up to $270 million as an open checkbook to
try to keep physicians happy, which most others would not have
done. This drastically reduced the anger providers would otherwise
have felt. Most importantly, the patients have been extremely
happy with Oxford.

Management, with its Freedom Plan which allows choice, its
Alternative Health rider which allows coverage of acupuncture
and the like and helped it win contracts with big "alternative
health"-employee-rich employers like Donna Karan, and its
specialty management services which is the first plan to directly
distribute some power to specialist groups; all of these
have established that management is innovative and competent.

Oxford is also moving ahead with its Florida expansion. Many
had thought that they would delay this, but their position is
that they have their IS problems under control and they are
now financially strong, so there is no reason to not expand
as planned. This will introduce their excellent management and
innovative plans into another market which does not any
claims bias.

Once again, I'll disagree and say that in the low-mid20's
OXHP has most of its problems discounted, with possible over-
allotment of reserves for claims, conservative AR numbers,
a strong balance sheet, and the likelihood of
mediocre but very positive earnings >$1 share next year,
going up from there.

I see $6 billion in revenues next year on sale for less than
one third that now. The risks are further disclosures by management,
which would be truly criminal, and Clinton, who recently
recommended further federal oversight of HMO's.

Good Investing,
Mike

Quantum analyst opinion

This is from Lehman from a downgrade on 12/3

"While drive stock prices have collapsed to what might be viewed as compelling
levels
of valuation, we remain unconvinced that we have yet reached an inflection
point in the
fundamentals which will serve as the catalyst for a recovery in the group. Due
to lack
of visability into improving market conditions, and a corresponding lack of
substantial
improvement in the supply/demand fundamentals and related pricing
aggressiveness,
we believe
the group will continue to underperform near-tearm"

"Correspondingly, we readily admit that it is too early to re-enter the group
at this time.
Even Quantum's shares - which we believe are severely under-valued at current
levels
( with the tape business alone valued at approx. $40) - will likely remain
under
pressure until both sentiment and earnings visability for the group improves."

"However, as soon as we see evidence that the environment has stabilized, we
would
aggressively recommend purchase of the shares in the HDD sector with the
expectation of strong gains in 1998."

"Quantum remains our favorite stock in this space."

*************

IMO, the downgrade reflects analysts' preoccupation with short
term appreciation, and the rest of the wording confirms my
own analysis of the stock and the cyclicality here. Looks
like a long-term buy to me. That DLT business is like an
undiscovered asset which, unlike land, has a defined payoff
timetable (no offense to land investors).

Paul,

>re ING. Where can I access the financials?

They have a pretty good web site at that includes annual reports, press
releases, financial statements, shareholder communications, etc.:

http://www.ing.nl/

They also filed a form F-4/A (> 2.0 Mb, for a merger with an American company)
with the SEC that includes historical numbers:

http://www.edgar-online.com/quotecom/gdoc/?choice=2-797727

They have recently proposed a merger with a large Belgium bank that will affect
the book value. Details can be found on their web site.

Thanks. just spent time reviewing proposed merger transaction. Although it
appears to dillute book value, acquisiiton will increase size of assets under
management significantly as well as afford entry into africa, and probably
allow for operationg efficiencies. I like the deal a lot. If anyone has a
warrant valuation model i would appreciate a valuation on the warrant that is
being offered as part of the transaction. it is a 10 year warrant with an
exercise price of 112 the closing price was 88.10 these numbers are in gulder.
thanks

I consider General Magic GMGC ($1.90) as a value investment with $6 price
target, here is why:

1. Basic Data: 26.8 mil O/S, 40 mil cash or $1.50 cash, no debt, tax loss carry
forward $138 mil, market cap $51 mil.

2. Buying a stock near its cash value is generally a bargain. It is
exceptionally so in case of General Magic if we consider its tremendous
potential --- if its network service Serengeti archives some degree of success
(5% of the mobile market). Secondly, how often we could buy a $1.90 stock with
5 top American CEOs sitting on the board and $165 mil R&D money already
invested?

3. CEO Markman has assembled an impressive board that included: CEO of Bell
Atlantic Mobile, the largest wireless service provider on the East Coast); CEO
of Cellular One, the AT&T Wireless and AirTouch Corporation joint venture; CEO
of Triton Communications; CEO of Tandem and CEO of Visa USA.

4. It raises an interesting question: Why are these Telecom Heavy Weights
Sitting on the Board of this Little Unknown Company? The answer perhaps lies
with General Magic's visionary new product code named Serengeti, a powerful,
Internet-based application that will allow people to use one point (phone) to
access all network information and communications activities (voice mail,
email, fax, calendar, address book and stock quotes).

5. General Magic designed Serengeti to be transparent to the carriers that will
be offering it. The backbone of General Magic's service is a series of
high-tech server centers with redundancy built in. These regional centers
provide all of the General Magic services. Carriers are not required to install
any additional equipment in their own switching centers or anywhere else.

6. When Serengeti launches early next year, wireless carriers are likely to be
aggressive marketers of the service because it helps them to sell more air
time. It makes wireless essential to many mobile users --- hence, it transforms
wireless carriers from being "just a wireless wire" to being mobile
communications services providers. This is such an exciting new revenue stream,
which probably explains why there are 3 wireless CEOs sitting on General
Magic's board.

7. General Magic may have to share subscriber revenues with wireless carriers,
however the market potential is very big, according to Roberta Wiggins at the
Yankee Group in Boston. "Serengeti should appeal to many of the estimated 43
million workers who spend a significant portion of their workweek on the road.
And That number will grow to 63 million by 2001".

8, If Serengeti succeeds in signing up 5% of the 50 mil mobile workers (and
growing) at $30 per month, that will give the company an annual revenue of $900
mil. With wireless companies sharing 40% of the revenue (on top of selling a
lot of more air time for themselves), General Magic's sharing of revenue is
still a significant $540 mil. Of course, that's years away and there is a big
IF.

9. Given the annuity nature of the service and the lead time General Magic has
(according to Andew Seybold, Magic is serveral generations ahead), and as more
and more mobile workers sign up the service as they sign up internet today, one
could make a case for General Magic to be valued on a subscriber basis, much
like the way AOL or cellular companies being valued today.

10. So what are the revenue opportunities?? $540 mil per year (?? after
reaching 2.5 mil subscribers), assuming a 5% penetration of the 50 mil Mobil
market; a $30 monthly subscription for the service with wireless carriers
getting 40% of the potential $900 mil annual revenue). This is likely a
too-good-to be true #, however, if GMGC achieves 1/10 of the $540, it is still
a great annuity.

11. So How Much Should The Magic Be Worth?
A lot more than $1.90 or the current market cap of $51 mil.
Let's see What we are getting for $51 mil?
1. Cash: $40 mil ( as of Sept30) or $1.50
2. R&D invested: $165 mil
3. Tax Loss Carry forward: $139 mil
4. Subscriber Revenue Potential: $540 mil per year ???
5. Intellectual Property: three key communication technologies
1) patented agent technology; 2) integrated communications appls
and 3) Natural user-interface designs.
6. A Collection of Talented People such as developers of Arpanet and
co-designer of Telescript, patent holder of wireless data packet protocols and
...
7. An intriguingly well-connnectedl board.

Alternatively, a more conservative and simplistic approach yielded a $6 price
target based on what's known today:
Cash $40 mil + $14 mil tax loss carry forward (10c on a $1, based on $139 mil
loss)
+ technology $1.50 per share (based on $165 mil invested)
+ future $1.50 per share (based on the $540 mil potential revenue)
+ 50c per share for its Handheld Mobile Solutions for vertical markets
+ 50c per share for the people and the board
===== $6

Armin S.: re ING. Man, these Dutch companies are on the move! ING, AHold, ABN.
Buying up lots of good USA companies. Never thought to grap hold of AHold, but
I'm still flyin' with KLM. Pretty hard to go wrong with ING for a long term
investment. I've always thought Equitable of Iowa was a premier insurance co.,
so having them in the ING fold lends credibility to ING for me.
Some aspects make me cautious here though. First, the price is fair at 1.5 book
and okay div yield. Fair -- but not great. Second, ING is going like
gangbusters. But pleeze. It's an insurance co. with tons of competitors. The
growth is coming from buying other companies--yes I see that; maybe from going
into new markets (I can't tell), maybe from cost efficiencies (I don't see why
they are better than many other insurance companies - even if they are Dutch
-g-), maybe from increased GIC sales. Oops. I don't think I like that. You
guarantee the purchaser a payoff % and you assume/think/expect to make a profit
on the higher % you assume/think/expect. Very risky IMO. Misprice those
insurance contracts too low, pump 'em out the door - all the sales guys pushing
'em to make their bonuses -- eventually write-offs follow. Not saying this is
being done or that any bad consequence would happen --I'd believe ING is too
smart to let this occur. But for me, I'd pick other insurance companies to
invest in at this time and price point (and those other companies have problems
too -g-) Good investing, Paul Senior

Maya: interesting way you have of valuing companies. Technology dollars
invested (spent) become an asset. Somebody else - one of those medical
technology letter writers or portfolio managers I think - does it based on
technology spending over 5 years. Well why not? Those companies don't have any
sales or earnings mostly. Now the added twist is that you value the people and
the board at 50c per share. I like that. Looks like 180 people per Yahoo
report. Let's see. With 5 top American CEO's on the board, how can I apportion
the 50c per share? How about 2c for all the people and 48c for all the CEO's
and the others on the board? No that can't be right. I want it allocated so
that the more people they hire the more the 50c grows. No, it's probably better
if I do it for a stock I own like APM. I'll just calculate all the money they
put into R&D and add it back to book value. Surely too, I could add a few c per
share for all the people they've got on their board too. I like it -g-.
