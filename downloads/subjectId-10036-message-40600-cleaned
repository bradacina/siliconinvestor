Senior loan funds like FRA and VVR benefit from rising short rates, since they
are long more floating rate exposure than they are exposed to on the borrowing
side (although there may be a reset lag).

FFC and FLC are preferred funds that definitely would be hurt by rising short
rates.

The footnote that I saw in their financial statements dealt with Enron's
transactions with small companies set up by Andrew Fastow that were based in
the Caribbean (I think it was the Cayman Islands). I watched that footnote show
up in two consecutive financial statements and decided that since the auditor
knew about the transactions and only included them as a footnote without
changing their opinion, then the amounts involved were probably very small and
immaterial.

I struggled with the decision but ultimately decided to make a VERY small
investment. I put $500 in their dividend reinvestment program. I was really
interested in this new energy trading business and Enron appeared to be hitting
on all cylinders.

Their next financial statement still had the footnote and the language still
implied that the transaction amounts were immaterial. So hesitantly, I put
another $500 into their DRIP. I limited the amounts that I invested in Enron to
a level that I was begrudgingly willing to put at risk. Overall I guess that it
was a small price to pay to learn these things the hard way. The information
was there, hidden in the footnotes (the devil is in the details), but I choose
not to give it proper heed. Hopefully I am a little wiser now.

What really upset me was that the auditors were aware of the situation but
apparently did not expand the scope of their audit to include a more thorough
review of those dealings. Having been an auditor back in the 70's, I should
have known better. Auditors want repeat business, so they tend to satisfy the
client rather than investors. Even if it means bending a few rules or just
turning their heads.

Here is an excerpt from Wikipedia that further explains how Fastow bullied
banks:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Fastow

 Fastow designed a complex web of companies that solely did business with
Enron, with the dual purpose of raising money for the company, and also hiding
its massive losses in their quarterly balance sheets. This effectively allowed
Enron's audited balance sheet to appear debt free, while in reality it owed
more than 30 billion dollars at the height of its debt. While presented to the
outside world as being independent entities, the funds Fastow created were to
take write-downs off Enron's books and guaranteed not to lose money. Yet,
Fastow himself had a personal financial stake in these funds, either directly
or through a partner. Fastow made tens of millions of dollars defrauding Enron
in this way, while also neglecting basic financial practices such as reporting
the 'cash on hand' and total liabilities. Fastow pressured some of the largest
investment banks in the United States, such as Merrill Lynch, Citibank, and
others to invest in his funds, threatening to cause them to lose Enron's future
business if they did not. Fastow also reportedly got these firms to fire their
analysts who dared to rate Enron negative ratings. (see Conspiracy of Fools)

I the the scope that you referenced regarding audits is too narrow. Auditing
financial statements is definitely more than just adding up numbers that
Management supplied to you. Check GM's 10k for example:

You said:
 (1) they double check the math to see whether everything has been added and
subtracted correctly; and (2) they make sure that Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP) have been correctly applied. That may not sound like much,
but that is what audits are. Audits were never designed to detect fraud.

From Gm's 10k

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of GMAC Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of GMAC Inc. and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
Consolidated Statements of Income, Changes in Equity, and Cash Flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2009
and 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

You are of course correct. There is much more to an audit than just double
checking the math and verifying that the reporting is in accordance with GAAP,
but the detection of fraud is not part of the audit. And the most basis
objective is still to check the math and verify that the results are reported
in accordance with GAAP.

from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_auditor

The primary role of external auditors is to express an opinion on whether an
entity's financial statements are free of material misstatements. Some people
confuse auditors with people who detect fraud but auditors have nothing to do
with fraud detection exclusively. Auditors just want to make sure that
company's financial statements are true and fair representation of its actual
position. If they come across any fraud related information, it is their
responsibility to bring it to the management's attention and consider
withdrawing from the engagement if management does not take appropriate
actions. Normally, external auditors review the entity's information technology
control procedures when assessing its overall internal controls. They must also
investigate any material issues raised by inquiries from professional or
regulatory authorities, such as the local taxing authority. For public
companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States, the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act (SOX) has imposed stringent requirements on external auditors in their
evaluation of internal controls and financial reporting.

The steps taken by the auditor to achieve those very basic objectives is
defined by Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS).

from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Auditing_Standards

U.S. GAAS are ten auditing standards, developed by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, consisting of general standards, standards of
field work, and standards of reporting, along with interpretations. They were
developed by the AICPA in 1947 and have undergone minor changes since then.

The US GAAS are as follows:

General Standards
1. The auditor must have adequate technical training and proficiency to perform
the audit.
2. The auditor must maintain independence in mental attitude in all matters
related to the audit.
3. The auditor must use due professional care during the performance of the
audit and the preparation of the report.

Standards of Field Work
1. The auditor must adequately plan the work and must properly supervise any
assistants.
2. The auditor must obtain a sufficient understanding of the entity and its
environment, including its internal control, to assess the risk of material
misstatement of the financial statements whether due to error or fraud, and to
design the nature, timing, and extent of further audit procedures.
3. The auditor must obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence by performing
audit procedures to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding the
financial statements under audit.

Standards of Reporting
1. The auditor must state in the auditor's report whether the financial
statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
2. The auditor must identify in the auditor's report those circumstances in
which such principles have not been consistently observed in the current period
in relation to the preceding period.
3. When the auditor determines that informative disclosures are not reasonably
adequate, the auditor must so state in the auditor's report.
4. The auditor must either express an opinion regarding the financial
statements, taken as a whole, or state that an opinion cannot be expressed, in
the auditor's report. When the auditor cannot express an overall opinion, the
auditor should state the reasons therefore in the auditor's report. In all
cases where an auditor's name is associated with financial statements, the
auditor should clearly indicate the character of the auditor's work, if any,
and the degree of responsibility the auditor is taking, in the auditor's
report.

"selling spikes" - I agree with you partially. I only sell spikes when stocks
become overvalued or high-fairly valued for Graham stocks. I also sell event
spikes, like announcement of possible sale, newsletter recommendation that
causes momo pileup etc. I don't sell runups for stocks that I still consider
undervalued.

GRMN - yeah, it has become disappointing stock. I am in positive land with it,
but then I bought most of it at $20 and I could have bought multibagger stocks
at that time instead... :/ I am not sure it's a great stock going forward
unless somebody acquires them. They have tons of cash and cashflow, but they

I was reading through Greenblatt's website and there is an awful lot about 1 yr
holding period in the studies he uses and it is core to what is posted there.

It took me a while but I finally dug up the article where Marc Gerstein
performed some studies using what he called an enhanced Greenblatt which is
what I guess is closer to what I'm doing. This study uses a 4 week refresh
which is probably where I locked in that more frequent refresh might be
desirable.

You all are right though. Official Greenblatt is 12mo holding period. (I'm

I'm out of them now. I just list them of examples that I tend to like and get
top heavy in. Like Garmin they start off looking cheap and gradually grow and
before you know it they can become a very large part of portfolio without
active rebalancing. And compounding the problem is my tendency to add to a
position on good news (which these kinds of companies tend to have over time).
Garmin is one I just didn't understand what had happened until it was too late.
I didn't understand what the smart phones were bringing to the table until it
was too late. But lesson learned - ease out of these growers as valuations get
excessive. DECK definitely started as a value stock to me with nice growth and
recently got quite expensive. CTSH was similar.

It would be interesting to see a study that compares returns (before tax) on a
4 week turnover vs. a 1 year turnover. My gut says that one year would work
better, but I've got nothing to back that up with other than my gut. In my
experience, value plays usually take longer than 4 weeks to play out. Also,
they often don't stop moving up once they break out of value territory - you
can lose a lot of momentum if you sell them after four weeks.

The big question on a 4 week cycle is what do you do with stocks that remain on
the list after four weeks? Do you automatically hold them and rebalance, or if
not how do you decide whether to hold or kick them out? This actually comes up
often enough over a 12 month cycle (and according to the MF FAQ, the decision
on this one is completely up to you), but I suspect it's an even bigger factor
in a four week cycle. It's a double edged sword. If you automatically sell
after four weeks, you'll avoid the value traps but it means you'll miss the
ones that you haven't timed more or less perfectly. If you automatically hold,
you are going to cling to value traps but potentially miss a lot of up side on
the ones that turn into momentum stocks.

Mark, all good questions. I think the Marc Gerstein study was an attempt to
build a fully automatable process using approx 1 mo holding periods just to see
what would happen and the 4wk empirical holding periods had good results in his
test. He has better trading approaches and doesn't necessarily recommend this
one, but it was interesting to me that the hypothetical shorter term results
were good and got me to thinking about how I approached value stocks in
general. 1 mo? 12mo? something in between? something longer?

Based on what I've seen of the screens, I would never be comfortable going with
the autopilot approach. Some of the stocks that rank at the top have clear
issues that I'd prefer to stay away from. Most of my picks are in the top
100-150 or so, but I'd never just take the top 15 no questions asked.

- Alot of the issues in some of the MF stocks are being discussed on the thread
right now - alot of Chinese companies at the top which have accounting
concerns.
-Some sectors I want to avoid like the for profit educators which are all over
the list. (Jurgis for example I think says he prefers avoiding the home health
sector right now which has several MFstocks at the top.)
-A single irregular blip in quarterly earnings can move a company into the top,
so I keep an eye out for those (MICC is example).
-Some are just company specific. Some think PPD is pyramid scheme. Some co's
are dependent on govt contracts.
- ARO Aeropostale is near the top but just warned of expected very weak quarter
so I just sold and am holding off for air to clear before reentering.
- GRMN and RIMM - can they last in world of iphone/Android?

I saw video clip where Greenblatt discusses how it's easy to pretty much come
up with good reasons to avoid most of the stocks at the top of the list and
advise maybe it's just best to hold your nose and buy - in aggregate it works
out. I just can't quite do that though even though it might be self defeating.
Just want to try to improve my odds if I can, and it's kindof fun to try! :-)

Hello Shane,

I like your portfolio, and I like the discussion points you've brought up. I
have been a big fan of MSFT and NE in the past few months, though as MSFT is
approaching my valuation targets I trimmed my position today to a more
reasonable level (I added to SVU and I'm considering adding to CSCO which I
like better from a valuation basis these days than MSFT).

In regards to short-term trading, I tend to buy companies for the long-term,
but I'm also quick to sell if a company bounces up 20% in a month or two (which
doesn't happen too often for me, unfortunately). :)

tax or not. I suspect not. I'll just chop off 35% from the total to get
$1.07/sh. And a some of the land hasn't been drilled or tested enough to have
any estimates. I'm hopeful there.
=======================
Somehow I suspect there's one alleged pro analyst out there who has calculated
his/her one year target (ending '11) to be about a dollar, and the other guys
just follow. More likely though, the ceo, who is trying to talk up the company
to get joint venture partners or to make land sales, has bullishly said the
stock might be at $1/sh in a year. And now every other analyst and report says,
sure, $1.00/sh for next year.

... so me too. Fair value >$1/sh. Maybe we might see $1/sh in a year. Or not.

armi, I was in BBY once or twice in the past decade, but it's been a long time.
I think they'll be back on my watchlist after this drop - although I try to
stay away from gaps down.

I have no special insight into BBY but do view them as somewhat a unique
destination in retail and wouldn't mind investing again at the right price, but
I'm trying to think what the next big ticket upgrade item might be. Consumer's
pretty tapped out right now so there's probably room for a major re-valuation
in shares at which point they might become attractive again. I just haven't
looked into yet. The big screen phenom might be a once in lifetime event
though.

cwillyg,

I almost bought CSCO last Friday at work but resisted. I've started
incorporating some very simple technicals into what I do and I come to realize
gaps down like CSCO generally don't start marching right back up. On top of
that I keep reminding myself CSCO's conf.call was cautious looking forward -
the reason for the gap down.

I'm definitely interested - just trying to control myself and not get buyer's
remorse.

Money seems to be moving MSFT's way this week. It's shown surprising strength
recently after playing dead after it's last quarterly earning announcement
(which I thought was very strong). I'm was looking for $30 price target on MSFT
if it'll get there. I think it's worth a more (I could easily see multiples of
13-15 for MSFT) but not sure what the market thinks. Do you care if I ask your
price target on MSFT?

BTW, I probably should follow your lead and sell half of my MSFT as it nears
target just to lower the bet I have on the table. It's my biggest position
right now but other decent ideas are out there too.

Hello Shane,

My price target for a year right now on MSFT is about 31. That's conservative,
but I was at about 8% of my portfolio in MSFT, so I want to aim at conservative
targets with such a big position. That target was based on projected earnings
in at least a year, a p/e of 10, + cash. Now that I'm at about 2-3% of my
portfolio in MSFT, I'll let the rest go for a potentially higher target. I
still like the company and valuation.

I've owned CSCO for a while, buying on the way down, but I'm waiting until the
18's (if we get there) to buy more, assuming there aren't better values at the
time.

Thanks,

Yeah, I've been revisiting SVU and added my 2nd leg of a position today. I
agree that the calls aren't at a high enough premium yet compared to the
potential bounce back to a reasonable valuation in the common stock in the
short and medium-term.

I'm just surprised this company has revisited lows. I guess there's a
possibility of bankruptcy, as in any company, but it seems like with such
strong cash flow, lines of credit, and assets to sell, that they have a wide
margin of safety compared to their stock price drop.

armi, I by no means have any special insight on CSCO or industry dynamics. From
what I've read though, it sounds like CSCO and Juniper are pretty much own
their tech space and the big dogs tend to have some sustainable competitive
advantage that should help insulate from competition.

That said, CSCO is a little like INTC to me - why aren't they doing better than
they are? The reason to own these shouldn't be because they're cheap - that's
not the way of a gorilla - but for whatever reason the market has them in the
cheap bin. Maybe we're just entering an era where these maturing techs earnings
aren't worth quite as much as other company earnings due to factor X
(uncertainty?). I don't know. Maybe it's right to look at them and say "it
looks undervalued - lets buy". I don't know - but it is odd to me that so many
big name techs are near doormat valuations right now. I never thought I'd see
it.

To speak directly to your question - whatever is good for the internet should
be good for CSCO - or at least that's my limited read of the situation. The
good thing is that some investing thesis don't have to be very complicated :-)

I saw video clip where Greenblatt discusses how it's easy to pretty much come
up with good reasons to avoid most of the stocks at the top of the list and
advise maybe it's just best to hold your nose and buy - in aggregate it works
out. I just can't quite do that though even though it might be self defeating.
Just want to try to improve my odds if I can, and it's kindof fun to try!

After applying the MF system for a few years, I've come to a few conclusions:

- It works really well if you just follow it the way Greenblatt laid it out.
- It's a great screener for good ideas to follow up on your own.
- If you try to both of the above at the same time, you will probably impair
your results.

I've come to think of my mechanical MF stocks as being like a mutual fund. Look
at it this way - if you own a mutual fund, do you have to agree with every
decision the manager makes? For example Dr. Burry, the founder of this thread,
was a pounding of the table supporter of OSTK, a stock I believed then, and
continue to believe now, was a piece of crap. I would still invest with Dr.
Burry in a heartbeat, if given the opportunity.

It's the same with MF. Sure, some of the stocks won't work out, but it's not
like I'm infallible. Early on in my MF career, I tried to add value. For
example, when Biovail showed up on the screen I immediately rejected it because
of all the issues surrounding it (which were arguably legit). Meanwhile, in the
next year Biovail outperformed three out of the four picks I made in that
cycle.

The beauty of MF is that it's like a mutual fund manager who picks out of favor
value stocks but has a *really* low expense ratio and is not subject to
redemption risk. At this point, I've decided to let it do its thing, and I just
pick random stocks (though I do try to distribute them across a range of market
caps).

Having said that, I do also use MF as a screener, and I will exclude stocks
where I think I have an edge. In those cases I'll do my own analysis and make
my own buy decisions. Even then, it's more for practical reasons than anything
else that I leave them out of my MF group. It would be too confusing to keep
track of which is which if I start buying the same stocks for the MF piece of
my portfolio and the actively managed piece of my portfolio. Maybe some day
I'll just set up a completely separate MF account, but so far I've been too
lazy.

Mark, Thanks for the perspective on MF - I appreciate you sharing your thoughts
on it.

Since you've been using it for a few years I have a quick question. Do you find
there are periods in time when the companies on the list change alot, or do you
tend to see the same names persist? I've only been working with this method
intensively for the past 3-4 months and the list of cos seems pretty stable to
me over the entire period. At first it was a new list for me to familiarize
myself with, but now like with some other methods I find the same familiar cos
hanging out with me each month.

I wonder how you rebalance? You are holding each stock one year, is that
correct? If you started all at once, then the year's holding would come up at
the same time for each stock, and you'd rebalance all at the same time? So
maybe you bought your stocks over several different months, so the rebalancing
period comes up several times a year, and you are selling/buying a few stocks
every month or every few months, is this correct?

A little bit of both. Some stocks seem to be perennials. For example, while it
would go on and off, it seemed like King Pharmaceuticals was on there forever.
There are others like that. Over time the list will change but when sectors are
beaten down (like the education stocks right now) you can expect to see a lot
of those names over and over again. On the other hand, some stocks can get
beaten down temporarily and then disappear once they recover (or when
subsequent events justify the beaten down price).

Rebalancing:

I do it once a quarter, with four stocks each quarter and rebalance on the
quarter anniversary. I am doing this in a non taxable account, so I'm not
obsessive on doing it at exactly one year, but it's always within a couple of
days one way or the other. When I hold a stock in one quarter's cycle, I don't
buy it in another cycle (though, much to my chagrin, I did screw up on that one
in a recent quarter).

I looked at both INTC and TSM again. They have the same issue in my view. They
have great 2010 results so far, but this comes after very lackluster 10 years.
Obviously 2000 was a great year for semis, but INTC only exceeded 2000 EPS this
year. Looking 2000-2009 there is pretty much no EPS growth and I'm not sure if
there will be much going from 2010. I am afraid 2010 may be a toppy year again
and we will go down to flat from there.

Like you say, TSM has better numbers, but higher valuation. For now, I am not
sure I want to buy either. Although there is a chance that I am missing a great
bargain if tech gets love again.

I guess it is a huge question whether we can do better than auto-MF. My guess
would be that we can do better when we step outside MF universe and invest (or
choose not to invest) in something different. E.g. if I decide that E&Ps are
the way to go due to Peak Oil and low POI (like it was in 2009), I may
outperform auto-MF, because I compete outside its universe. Or similarly, if I
decide that stocks are overpriced and I should hold cash, I may outperform by
being outside the universe again. (Obviously, I can also underperform if my
calls are bad).

IMHO, it is very hard to outperform MF by adding adjustments inside the
universe. I saw the same video you mention and Greenblatt mentions
adding/changing a bunch of criteria and most things backtested worse than
original MF. If we start picking and choosing, we risk to lose the turnarounds
of our hated sectors like for-profit education or home healthcare or Chinese
stocks or RIMM/GRMN.

I'm still in a picker and chooser camp, but more because I look for value in
various other places and I run my own valuation. If I only chose from MF
stocks, I'd probably go with auto-MF.

From the stocks you mentioned:
- MICC is actually a good company, I missed it when it went cheap in 2009
crash.
- PPD. I don't think it's a pyramid scheme, since the revenues (and income)
have not grown for four years. The issue is more that the revenues and income
have not grown, so perhaps the pool of people who would buy prepaid legal
services has been exhausted. That's not a positive, since it's unclear if they
can diversify into something else without diworsifying. It's also unclear if
there would be a price war at some point (probably not, but I'm not sure).
Worth watching IMO, but good price has been missed. :/
- I own some ARO, but I'd like a better price before buying more.
- GRMN/RIMM - I own token positions. GRMN may survive on vertical markets. It's
unclear how profitable they will be with only that. RIMM is still in pretty
good position due to their email/texting franchise, though long-term they may
have problems. Tough to see either of them prosper a lot.

Looking at prices of big 3: INTC, MSFT, CSCO, it has been a lost decade for
them. I guess part of the reason was that "conventional" tech sales topped in
2000 and these Gorillas or Kings did not manage to find new markets to spread
into since then. All of them tried and are still trying:

MSFT - internet business (so so), healthcare (success), mobile (mostly
failure), gaming (success)
CSCO - video conferencing (success?)
INTC - wireless and mobile (so so)

None of the successes were big enough to matter. So they are still stuck in
their main domains that are much more cyclical than growth. Which means that
maybe we should treat their good 2010 results with cyclical caution. :/

We can't tell whether we can do better or worse than auto MF unless we know
what auto MF performance results are. I guess auto-MF results are at least
somewhat dependent on the results obtained from the sample chosen from the
stocks that fit at the time. And the person's inclination to select their maybe
unique sample in the same way each time the stocks need rebalancing. So people
will get a range of results. Still, when I quickly Googled, I didn't see any
percentage compounding claims from users.

Here's the only thing that I found:

Jurgis, again thanks for your perspective. It helps balance me out quite a bit
when I look at these.

FWIW, I actually think Greenblatt's website is filtering out many of the China
stocks currently. I regularly go to his official site
https://www.magicformulainvesting.com/stock_screener.html
and check the picks to make sure my list/method is in the ballpark, and very
few of the China stocks that hit my list show up on any of the lists from the
site. China stocks: GFRE, SCLX, CBP, CPHI, HRBN all don't show when I run
cursory scans and they're all in the top 40 on my sort. The only China stock
that is on his list is NEWN - so they're not all 100% filtered, but I wonder if
some filtering has been done since so many others seem passed up. (either that
or NEWN made it in via oversight?)

Agree on MICC- really liked it when I looked at it, but then I realized it
wasn't really a MF stock due to irregular earnings quarter I presume. (It's not
on website either).

Paul,

Official Formula Investing results are here:

https://www.formulainvesting.com/actualperformance_MFT.htm

I am pretty sure that Dale outperformed that and I may have outperformed that
too, but then neither of us used MF universe for investing. I like MF universe
though and I have quite a bit of my portfolio in stocks from it (even though I
did not start with MF screen). That's why I am pursuing this extended
discussion here.

I wonder - which will remain an unanswered question I think - whether people
cherry picking from just MF universe would have outperformed auto-MF within the
same time period. ;)

There is also model performance, which is not real, so has to be taken with a
grain of salt:

https://www.formulainvesting.com/modelperformance_MFT.htm

It has pretty impressive 10 year annual 14.5% returns.

Note: I don't like comparing short term (1-2 year) performance of different
funds/people/etc, since I believe it's not very informative, scientific and
leads to ego trips. I did this rather casually here, but I do not intend to
promote or disparage different approaches. I suggest that people do not put a

It looks like the actual results were from buys in May '09 just off the lows in
'09. (not sure: the inception date and range dates are confusing,) And so a 45%
gain, that's achievable by most people who bought a portfolio of almost
anything at that time. Bond funds even have made 50% moves.

Now the model portfolio, that's pretty impressive. That is, the gain is a move
from 100K to 388K over 11 years. As stated, maybe about 14% compounded. Which
to me also seems very impressive especially after you look and see that the
average annual gain of the portfolio is 288% over 11 years: It's 26% per year.

This percentage certainly beats my portfolios' performance over the past 11
years. Then again, in my defense to myself, I'm not and wasn't just somebody
starting out with a relatively few bucks then. Risk/reward has played some role
for me. It's my same knock against numbers put up by Tilson, Burry, others. You
start off in your garage (Tilson) or apartment and push $10k or maybe less, to
20K in 18 months and incorporate that percentage gain for the next many years
to show how successful you are. (And those early gains are not confirmed by any
independent auditor.) Result: Everybody shows they can meet or beat Buffett on
the percentage gain. Or here, where it's a "model". Seems to work great. Just
isn't so easy (at least for me) when big dollars are involved. Jmo.

I try to keep competitiveness out of investing (but I get caught up in it). If
people were to just invest and keep doing it for decades and just get "average"
results, they'd do okay or well. Again jmo.

Aberdeen Reports Shareholders' Equity of $1.33 per Share and Third Quarter
Financial Results

TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 12/16/10 -- ABERDEEN INTERNATIONAL INC.
("Aberdeen", or the "Company") (TSX: AAB) is pleased to announce that it has
released its financial results for the third fiscal quarter of 2011, ending
October 31, 2010. For more information please see the Company's quarterly
financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") posted
on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

As at October 31, 2010, Aberdeen's Shareholders' Equity (or Net Asset Value,
"NAV") was $115.5 million, or $1.33 per share. Aberdeen's shareholders' equity
increased by $17.5 MM from $98.0 million at the end of Q2 2011. The increase in
shareholders' equity was due largely to exceptional performance of Aberdeen's
investment portfolio in the third quarter, which increased in value by 40% (see
press release of November 9, 2010). The Company enjoyed very good market
performance for small capitalization mining and resource stocks which make of
the bulk of its investment portfolio. In addition several holdings enjoyed
exceptional company-specific gains during the quarter, in particular Sulliden
Gold (TSX: SUE), Avion Gold (TSX VENTURE: AVR), Belo Sun (TSX VENTURE: BSX),
Crocodile Gold (TSX: CRK) and Apogee Minerals (TSX VENTURE: APE). On a
year-over-year basis, Aberdeen's shareholders' equity increased by $21.1
million or 22.3%. Note that the reference to shareholders' equity is similar to
previous references to Net Asset Value or "NAV" by Aberdeen.

Aberdeen reported net earnings of $17.7 million or $0.21 per share for the
third quarter from total revenue of $25.8 million ($25.1 million from net
investment gains, 0.5 million from royalties, $0.3 million from interest,
advisory and other income). For the nine months ending October 31, 2010,
Aberdeen report net earnings of $12.1 million or $0.15 per share from total
revenue of $21.9 million ($19.4 million from net investment gains, $1.5 million
from royalties, $1.0 million from interest, advisory and other income).

Aberdeen received royalty revenue of $503,585 from 38,014 ounces of gold sold
at Simmer & Jack's Buffelsfontein Mine and First Uranium's Mine Waste Solutions
Tailings Recovery Operations during the quarter ending October 31, 2010,
compared to $439,715 in the previous quarter.

Normal Course Issuer Bid

During the quarter ending October 31, 2010, 836,500 shares were purchased for
cancellation at an average cost of $0.41. As of the time that Aberdeen's Q3
financial statements were prepared, 6,698,500 shares remain eligible for
purchase and cancellation under Aberdeen's Normal Course Issuer Bid ("NCIB").
Aberdeen's current NCIB expires on February 4, 2011. Aberdeen expects to
continue to purchase shares over the remainder of the fiscal year, depending on
market conditions and other investment opportunities that may be available.

Management Changes

In addition the Company is pleased to announce that Ryan Ptolemy has been
appointed as the Corporate Secretary of Aberdeen effective December 13, 2010.
Mr. Ptolemy replaces Mr. G. Scott Moore who resigned from his position as
Corporate Secretary of the Company. The Company would like to thank Mr. Moore
for his efforts and wish him the best on future endeavours.

Jurgis, re: lost decade

I agree with your point wrt Price, and cyclicality could be reason for severe
multiple compression we see on these right now. I've been interpreting these -
esp MSFT - through more of an ongoing growth story lens up to now, but based on
your comment I agree cyclicality could be a big part of why the earnings
multiple is so compressed right now. I guess the thing to me is not to say
these companies don't have issues/concerns, but have they been discounted too
far? To me they're stocks that could easily deserve a market multiple, or close
to it - and that's a large basis of my interest. And I'm not even targeting for
them to get to market multiple. Just trying to pick up 15-20% of the
potential/possible increase in value.

I gotta admit though - cyclicality could very well make today's relatively low

XCO. I'm in now for the possible buyout.

Stock at $19. Management buyout offer at $20.50.

CEO has history of going private and he and "associates" control 40% of XCO.
From the WSJ:

"Mr. Miller, who is also Exco's chairman, has twice taken the companies he has
headed private. In 2003 he led a buyout of Exco shareholders and took the
company public again in 2006. Prior to that he took Coda Energy Inc., a Dallas
oil and gas explorer, private.

In his Nov. 1 letter to Exco's board, Mr. Miller said he had discussed the
latest bid with private-equity firms Oaktree Capital Management LP and Ares
Management LLC, as well as billionaire oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens, who is on
the Exco board.

Together Oaktree, Ares and Mr. Pickens owned more than 27% of shares, while Mr.
Miller and his management team control 13%, according to FactSet Research. Mr.
Miller owned more than 2% of Exco's stock at the end of the third quarter."

And recently another billionaire makes his appearance AFTER the deal is
proposed. According to the WSJ:

"Billionaire turnaround investor Wilbur Ross has built up a 7.5% stake in Exco
Resources Inc. nearly all of it since the Fort Worth company's chief executive
announced he would try to take the natural-gas producer private."

There are just too many deal makers and aggressive funds and billionaires
heavily involved with XCO (by their 40+ % share holdings) not to have a deal
get done. If it's for $20.5 and it's consummated in six months, that's %1.5/19
= 7.9% or about 16% annualized. If Mr. Ross is willing to come in at around
18.50 (my guess) for about 11% return (assuming it's done at $20.50 in six
months), which might be 22% annualized, I'm willing to take 16% for what seems
to me to be his affirmation of the close certainty of the deal: A deal will get
done for at least $20.5. I see the bigger risk being the time frame, and my
predicting inside of six months seems reasonable to me. Plus there's a possible
upside too: Mr. Ross and/or the BOD may be able to get Mr. Miller and backers
to up their offer.

re MA, V -
>>how low do you think it can go?<< If this comes to pass, maybe 50% lower. A
~90% haircut of revenues in the main growth business is very material.

I do think that this proposal is very draconian but I think something material
is going to stock. MA and V have been overplaying the power of their oligopoly
too much to juixce earnings - instead of passing on some of the cost savings
due to technology evolution, which enables cheaper transactions, to their
customers, they raised prices instead.

I think they overdone it and there is a significant chance that they are facing
substantial pushback.

Hi Paul -

Re: EXCO Resources Inc. (XCO)

Didn't know about the prior history of the CEO but Wilbur Ross's recent buy
supports my view that this one is a hold up to a fair value price of
$29.00/share. I remember reading somewhere that an argument could be made for a
$29.00/share buy out price which would be at the high end IMO. That's 40%
higher than the $20.50/share buy out offer.

I also like GMX Resources Inc. (GMXR) below $5.00/share for the various reasons
I posted earlier. The tie in with XCO is that GMXR owns several parcels
contiguous to XCO parcel(s) and has one or more JV's with them ranging from
drilling ventures, shared gathering facilities and other well development
projects.

If a new buyer bids on XCO (or the private buy out occurs), the new XCO
owner(s) may also acquire some or all of GMXR as this company's properties are
also undervalued when compared to XCO's buyout offer. If the new buyer is a
very large integrated Oil company, they may just want both companies.

goldman on MA and Visa: i dont have either but am thinking ...
i was in V at ipo and was thinking of getting back in either few days ago.
Clearly, now have to re-think. any opinion on which one?

Goldman analysts pulled their “conviction buy” call from Visa after the Federal
Reserve on Thursday proposed a set of new debit-card restrictions that were
more aggressive than many expected:

Although the headlines on the proposed interchange reduction appear ominous, we
continue to
emphasize that interchange is not a source of revenue for MA and V; therefore
its reduction does not change our models. The bigger issue, and where we are
most disappointed, is the lack of clarity on the Fed’s final view regarding
exclusivity. While we think that the market sell-off on MA and V shares is
overdone, we acknowledge that the near-term uncertainty on signature
exclusivity keeps the wall of worry on these stocks in place until the final
rules are made available in April 2011. Our longer-term view on MA and V is
unchanged.

Since Goldman first added Visa to its conviction buy list on July 9, 2009, the
shares have underperformed the broader indexes. Even before the big stumble
this week, the shares were up about 29%, versus the 40% gain seen in the S&P
500 over the same period. With the recent falloff, Visa is up 14% since
Goldman’s “conviction buy” call. Goldman is now neutral on Visa.

how can they say the interchange is not a source of revenue? that makes no

they dont make money, and if the banks who incur credit risk, dont make enought

FBR Capital on Financial Institutions: The Durbin Debit Downer--Making Sense of
the Federal Reserve's Proposal

FBR analyst says, "The Federal Reserve’s proposed rule on debit card
interchange fees and routing was generally more onerous than expected: (1) the
proposed reduction in interchange was larger than expected—a 75%, on average,
transaction, versus a high-end expectation of a 60% reduction; and (2) the
debit interchange fee was set as a flat fee of $0.07–$0.12 per transaction,
regardless of the dollar volume of the transaction. Given the substantial
reduction in debit fees, the question of exclusivity, which may end up
requiring unaffiliated PIN and signature debit cards, is less of an issue.
There is still considerable uncertainty about major portions of the proposal,
as the Federal Reserve has released a variety of options on each of the key
provisions. With that said, we do not anticipate a significant departure from
the draft rules to the final."

"We expect the issuers (banks) to bear the brunt of the reduced debit
economics, particularly the regional banks, as they have less diversified
earnings; but, over time, we expect the banks to recoup the majority of
revenues via new/increased fees. Most exposed among the banks is TCF Financial
(NYSE: TCB)(Market Perform), which would have experienced an estimated 6% loss
of revenue in 2010 had the proposal been in effect."

"With regard to payment networks, while investor sentiment will remain negative
in the near term, given the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate impact of the
new economics, we do not believe lower network fees are a foregone conclusion,
as we believe the proposal provides some flexibility for networks to shift
costs among payment network participants. With both payment network stocks down
substantially, we reiterate our Outperform ratings on both Visa (NYSE:
V)(Outperform) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA)(Outperform), with a preference for
MasterCard in the near term, given its lower debit exposure."

I will repost this for those who may want to read it.

May 9, 2010
Mastercard (nyse: MA, $223.09). Priced by Fear, Rather Than Success

MA shares outstanding: 131 million.
MA net liabilities (as of 03/30/2010): $1.34 billion.

MA enterprise value: $30.8 billion.

MA 2010 est. EBITDA: $2.8 billion.
MA 2011 est. EBITDA: $3.3 billion.

Est. 2010 closing EV/EBITDA ratio: 10.5X
Est. 2011 closing EV/EBITDA ratio: 8.5X

Mastercard's global growth rates seem to be unappreciated by North American
investors.

Q1, 2010 revenues came in a $1.31 billion, up by 13.1%. This surpassed the
highest view of $1.28 billion for Q1 and the analyst consensus of $1.27
billion. Earnings came in at $3.46 US per share, ABOVE the highest view of
$3.40, ABOVE the whisper number of $3.35 per share and 10% above the consensus
estimates of $3.14 per share for the quarter.

EBITDA in the quarter was $735 million, or 55.8% of net revenues, a record
since inception. Net liabilities fell by $568 million in the quarter.

click here to download the company's press release

click here to see the transcript of the company's earnings call

Mastercard has little respect from a "US centric" North American analyst
community.

Mastercard became a publicly traded company in May 2006. At year-end 2005, the
firm reported total revenues of $2.937 billion and EBITDA of $592.4 million, a
margin of 20.1%.

At the end of fiscal 2010, Mastercard revenues may exceed $5.75 billion, with
EBITDA surpassing $2.8 billion, a margin of 48.7%. Should this be proven
correct, on an absolute basis, EBITDA will grow by approximately 472%, on
revenue gains of 96%, during a five year period.

EBITDA increases of this magnitude occur at companies with largely fixed costs.
Mastercard has proven an ability to keep costs in check throughout the past
five years, while expanding revenue at a 14.5% compounded annual clip.

Despite a share price gain of more than 540% since issue, Mastercard is selling
for roughly the same forward relative valuation, as in 2006. EBITDA growth has
risen, virtually lock-step, with share price appreciation. The balance sheet
improvements are equally notable. At the end of 2010, Mastercard's balance
sheet will have moved from a position of net liabilities, in the range of $2
billion, to what looks to be a totally debt free position and a modest net cash
balance. 4 million outstanding shares will have been retired through share
repurchase since IPO.

Subsequent to IPOissue, MA has beaten analyst views on revenues and earnings
EACH and EVERY quarter, sometimes by amounts sufficiently high, so as to call
into question, the modelling systems adopted by various analysts. Q1 2010
proved, yet again, that analysts do not seem to be able to accurately compile
various components of the international revenue streams. Visa, the larger
competitor, did not beat consensus expectations on revenues and earnings by
analysts. This represents a paradox for analysts. One can easily and logically
conclude a confirmation bias exists in favour of Visa, and against Mastercard.

Mastercard is a larger issuer of credit cards than debit cards. Analysts are
bullish on the outlook for debit, less so for credit. Mastercard's historic
emphasis on credit, rather than debit, represents another point of contention
with analysts. Many are of the opinion that Mastercard will not be able to
fully participate in a secular trend towards debit.

Analysts and individual investors alike often report that Visa is more than 2X
the size of Mastercard in the US, and extrapolate this market share on a global
basis. Such a view represents a fallacy. Globally, Mastercard's business is
roughly 67% the size of Visa.

Mastercard derives more than 55% of revenues outside of the United States, and
has key strengths in emerging markets such as Brazil, Asia and Mexico. 66% of
the total number of cards, carrying the various Mastercard brands, are outside
of the United States. 60% of gross dollar volumes (GDV) processed by Mastercard
are generated outside of the United States.

http://phx.corporateir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MjY5NTMzOHxDaGlsZElEP
M2ODM5MHxUeXBlPTI=&t=1

The Asia Pacific region is Mastercard's fastest growing market. In Q1, 2010,
GDV in this region represented 22% of total volumes, up by 20.9% year over
year. In 2009, Asia Pacific GDV represented 18.7% of the total.

http://phx.corporateir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9Mjk3NzAyOXxDaGlsZElEP
M4MDQxNHxUeXBlPTI=&t=1

Latin America GDV accounts for 7.8% of Mastercard's total. A year ago, Latin
American GDV was 6.7% of the total.

In aggregate, Asia and Latin America are Mastercard's second largest overall
market, ahead of Europe and behind the US. Should present trends continue, by
mid- 2011, Asia and Latin America will become Mastercard's largest market, as
measured by GDV.

While Visa and Mastercard represent a de-facto duopoly in global credit/debit,
there is a substantial difference in valuation, between the two firms.

Visa (V-NYSE, $83) has 737 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis
and currently has net liabilities of $3.52 billion. This represents an
enterprise value of $64.9 billion. Visa should report 2010 EBITDA of $4.7
billion. Visa has currently made a dilutive purchase (Cybersource) to be
completed later this year; total liabilities should remain unchanged through
the 2010. Visa's 2010 year end EV/EBITDA looks to be in the range of 13.9X.

Mastercard has a current enterprise value of $30.8 billion and should report
2010 EBITDA in the range of $2.8 billion. The year-end EV/EBITDA ratio looks to
be 10.5X.

Mastercard generates less than 67% the revenue of Visa and produces 62% of
Visa's EBITDA. As an offset, Mastercard sells for roughly 44.6% of Visa's 2010
year end EV/EBITDA ratio.

Both Mastercard and Visa are well positioned to capture the secular global move
to a cashless society.

As processors, Mastercard and Visa remain immunized from direct credit risk.
They generate revenues from license fees, cross border assessments and a modest
percentage of the interchange fee charged to merchants who rely on their global
payment systems.

There has been periodic upheaval in the share price of Mastercard throughout
the years 2008-2010. At first, criticism was levied regarding the earnings
reliability throughout the global slowdown in 2008-2009. Such fears of earnings
compression proved to be wholly unfounded.

In the case of Mastercard, revenues have grown by a solid 25.3% from 2007 to
year-end 2009. Processed transactions were up 19.5% over the same period.
Operating expenses have not changed significantly in the last several years.
Almost all of the increase in revenues fell directly to EBITDA, and
subsequently to the bottom line.

Capital expenditures to support and grow the Mastercard network have
approximated $162 million per annum, for the last 3 years. This is
approximately 3% of annual revenues.

The initial fixed costs of setting up competing businesses are extremely high,
which is a key barrier to entry. Fees paid to processors are miniscule on a per
transaction basis. Economies of scale are therefore almost impossible to
achieve for new entrants to the business, which represents the other barrier to
entry. For these reasons, I do not own the smaller processors, which include
American Express and Discover. Visa and Mastercard produce some of the highest
non-cyclical profit margins on the planet. With fixed costs in check and
rapidly declining interest charges, future revenue gains may produce
disproportionately high bottom line profits. Frankly, they both operate
terrific businesses that are virtually impossible to replicate, in scope and
scale.

Two banks are attempting to set up a credit and debit processing partnership in
Brazil, which will report start up assets in the range of $8.5 billion, before
adding in debts. The partnership hopes to generate roughly $600 million of
total profits in the next five years, ($120 million per year), a modest 1.4%
annual return on invested capital. Such a start-up cost certainly reinforces
the current value of highly profitable businesses operated by Visa and
Mastercard.

Visa is certainly more advanced in the debit card market.

US consumers completed more debit transactions than credit transactions in
2009. Analysts reported this as a tipping point. Whether or not the emphasis on
the use of debit vs credit can be considered a permanent trend remains to be
seen. It is my contention that at least a portion of the debit increase in the
US, and to a lesser extent Canada, is largely cyclical. Should the US economic
recovery continue, it is my belief that credit trends will revert to the norm.
Debit usage will continue to increase, but credit could recover very quickly.

Globally at Visa, debit card use accounted for approximately 57% of gross
dollar volume

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Visa-Inc-Posts-Strong-Fiscal-prnews-1476842592.ht
l?x=0&.v=1

Mastercard's perceived current weakness in US markets are not nessarily
reflective of a global trend.

Insofar as debit is concerned, Mastercard's international operations
represented 17% of gross dollar volumes for Q1. Total debit (including US)
represented 33.7% of gross dollar volumes for the quarter. As with Visa,
Mastercard also reported US that debit usage surpassed the use of credit in Q1,
2010.

Internationally, Mastercard reported debit volumes were up by 33.2% in Q1. On
an absolute basis, Mastercard debit is smaller both domestically and globally,
than Visa. However, Mastercard's growth rates in debit are quite comparable to
that of Visa.

http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MzgwNDA5fENoaWxkSUQ9
zgwMzc1fFR5cGU9MQ==&t=1

Recent criticisms impacting Mastercard's share price, as well as that of Visa,
reflect the possibility of interchange fees moving towards a regulated
structure, in the US.

Retailers continue to try to have US congress cap the interchange fees. The
implication put forth by mainstream media is that the lobby group of Visa and
Mastercard is weaker than the lobby groups of retailers, and will therefore
lose out in some sort of regulatory end run.

http://www.reuters.com/article/idCNN0511837420100505?rpc=44

http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d1045.pdf

What media outlets fail to take into account, is that a full 85% of interchange
assessments go to the member banks of the credit and debit card systems. Almost
$40 billion of total interchange fees were paid to the issuing banks in 2009.
Retailers are really fighting banks. Mastercard and Visa, as partners with the
banks, are certainly exposed, but represent more peripheral players.

Banks and financial services presently account for more than 2X the amount of
US GDP, when compared to retailers. Banks are an incredibly powerful lobby
group (some argue too powerful) and will neither willingly give up either
current fees, nor will they give away potential fee growth, without a fight.
Both banks, V and MA argue that assessments are made against merchants, not
consumers; the issue in their mind is one of "business to business" and need
not be regulated.

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704905704574622722184163510.html

In a worst case scenario for Visa and Mastercard, any potential cap on
interchange fees could, in all likelihood, simply be replaced by a new type of
fee which would be levied, so as to offset interchange caps. Such a fee could
be similar to the dreaded "system access fees" consumers pay for mobile cell
services in certain parts of the world.

What businesses are doing, essentially, is attempting to shift the burden of
the interchange payments off of their backs, and directly to the backs of
consumers. There is no free lunch. Consumers are already indirectly paying the
interchange fees; merchants build into merchandise selling prices an amount
equal or greater than, the current assessments. In the event that interchange
fees are capped or reduced, it is highly doubtful that merchants will then
reduce product prices by an amount equal to interchange fee reductions. What is
attempting to be accomplished, is simply a lateral transfer of profit away from
card issuers to merchants.

Since the earnings report of May 4th, 2010. Mastercard shares have fallen by
12.1%, far greater than the average decline of US equity markets as a whole.

Visa shares have also fallen by approximately 12.5% since the release of their
last quarterly financial report. It would appear that a portion of the pullback
may be attributable to the potential for some regulatory fee cap being imposed
at a congressional level. Whether or not this comes to pass, or whether it will
have an impact on the business remains to be seen. Interchange fees are now
regulated in Australia; according to financial reports ay Visa and Mastercard,
no material challenges to the business model or profitability in that market
occurred. Many of Mastercard's primary markets already carry higher degrees of
regulation than the US. With a larger US business, Visa will be potentially
impacted to a greater degree than Mastercard, should punitive regulations go
into effect.

Investment markets have generally been weakened by a key national issue coming
from Europe.

The current risks of a default in the national debts of Greece are cause for
concern but are possibly very overblown. Greece is not a substantial economic
power. With a population of just 10.8 million persons, Greece is the 34th
largest economy on the globe, but is the 17th largest external debtor. It is a
government heavy nation; more than 40% of GDP comes from public sector
employment. Some government employees are paid bonuses simply for showing up to
work on time. Direct EU aid represents about 3.3% of Greek GDP per annum. GDP
is about 2/3 per capita that of leading Eurozone nations. National tax policies
are lax, collections are uneven and the cash economy is rampant.

https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html

Through direct subsidy, Greece has been effectively "propped up" by EU aid for
many years now, and will continue to be afforded substantial aid in the future.

A country of 10.7 million people is simply is too small to have meaningful
negative impacts upon forecast global growth. However, investors are now
becoming preoccupied with a fear that Greek "contagion" will spread to other
nations in the EU. Three nations have come under increased scrutiny of late,
Spain, Portugal and Italy.

Spain has a 20% official unemployment rate, to be sure. This is not a new
phenomenon; in fact Spanish unemployment rates have been structurally high for
more than 20 years.

http://www.allbusiness.com/public-administration/national-security-internationa
/524124-1.html

High unemployment rates in Spain are a more or less permanent paradox. Many of
the officially unemployed in Spain are actually "double dipping"; they generate
tax free cash incomes in Spain's large underground economy, while
simultaneously obtaining tax assisted government benefits, or "Paro". It is
widely assumed that the black market economy now equals 25% of reported Spanish
GDP per year.

Portugal has a more diversified economy, a lower budget deficit and workers
willing and able to be work for wages roughly 2/3 that of Greeks. Spain, Italy
and Portugal are less dependent upon EU aid, and are not in the same leaky boat
as Greece.

Italy has the largest black market, or "shadow" economy in all of Europe.

http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=1262

In my view, the risks of a Greek domestic capital crisis spreading throughout
the rest of Europe are as likely today, as was the likelihood of the swine flu
becoming a true pandemic last year; not likely. However, a common underlying
thread of Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece is the absolute size of their
underground cash economies. Reform is required to "out" these substantial
shadow economies, so that tax revenues can be paid. Some external shock is

A greater blow to the credibility of North American markets recently came about
from the VERY recent disclosure of Goldman Sachs discussing an SEC settlement
on their mortgage securitization issuance activities.

Such a settlement, if reached, will confirm long held suspicions by investors
at large that we operate at a considerable disadvantage to a select number of
financial institutions.

It is equally important to note that true financial reform cannot occur, when
those who are supposedly overseeing the financial firms, find themselves in a
position to earn outsized financial benefits by trading on material non-public
information.

Key government officials have clearly demonstrated their abilities to drive
down the shares of Mastercard and Visa by more than 6%, over and above normal
market fluctuations. This was effectively accomplished simply through
discussing the placing of an addendum to a bill. Competing bank lobby groups
will now go to work on lawmakers. Nevertheless, negative media attention has
been generated. Unfortunately for investors holding securities other than Visa
and Mastercard, such negative government pronouncements for index stocks
created a ripple effect one that spilled over into other securities. So long as
officials are also in a personal position to sell shares short, without the
requirement of disclosure, their motivations for spreading rumour may certainly
be called into question. I estimate that more than $8.6 billion of the market
cap decline in Visa and Mastercard is directly attributable to potential
interchange proposal. Quis Custodiet ipsos custodes?

http://rightsoup.com/insider-trading-illegal-for-you-but-not-for-congress-hr-68
/

Trading volumes and selling pressures for Visa and Mastercard spiked VERY
dramatically for 2 days, immediately prior to the announcement that a
government official is considering adding an interchange fee amendment, to a
forthcoming bill.

Pundits may shortly discuss potential negative impacts of a spending slowdown
in the Mediterranean Eurozone nations.

Some have already concluded that Greece will fall into a period of economic
malaise that will require a decade or more to recover. More worry that Italy,
Spain and Portugal will soon follow suit. An inference might be made that
conclude Mastercard and Visa will experience sharp reductions in European
processing. This is unlikely.

What the mass media will inevitably fail to take into account, and what this
article has pointed out earlier, are that Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal
represent the four largest "cash" economies in the EU. Even should all four
nations fall into an economic recession, payment processing rates are likely to
be unaffected. Those who pay with cash don't generate a dime of revenue for V
and MA. Credit and debit volumes, according to Visa and Mastercard, in Q1,2010,
grew by rates significantly above that of the US. Most of this growth came from
the northern and central regions of Europe. Recent declines in the Euro will
make these nations, which are the key "producing" economies of Europe, even
more competitive going forward. In fact, there may be longer term unintended
benefits of PIGS (Portugal, Italy Greece and Spain) reform for V and MA. Any
substantial reforms in these cash economies will create more non-cash
processing, down the road.

Mastercard represents one part of a duopoly presently benefitting from one of
the planet's defining secular trends; a move from cash to electronic payments.

The business model of Mastercard and Visa proved itself out during a period of
below average global growth. At less than 10X my 2011 forward EV/EBITDA
estimate, shares of Mastercard now look to be about as cheap, on a forward
basis, as they were shortly after the IPO.

I feel that Mastercard has significant earnings leverage, should credit use
increase in a more broadly based economic recovery. The secular trend towards
increased debit use will continue; Mastercard seems well positioned to grow the
debit business as well.

After several years of holding shares of Mastercard, without either buying or
selling, RMG#1 has recently moved to add some shares of Mastercard to the
account.

At the current price, it is my view that Mastercard is presently valued as a
broken growth stock. Mastercard is the more international investment in the
card processing market, as compared to Visa. In about a year, Asian and Latin
American processing by Mastercard will surpass that of the US.

Mastercard's growth story, which never abated during the economic slowdown, is
likely to accelerate in the near to mid-term. Interchange fees improve for
Mastercard and Visa when average ticket size increases. Purchases on credit are
historically much higher than purchases on debit. Mastercard's revenue stream
is credit oriented. Only modest growth in the use of credit cards is necessary
in order to produce a material revenue "shock" to the top line.

By the end of 2010, even using my conservative determination of EV, Mastercard
should boast a net cash balance. Significant forecast net cash balances, in the
years to come, may be used to repurchase stock, raise the dividend and be
invested for organic growth.

Opportunities to invest in a strong, highly profitable and non-cyclical
company, for less than 9X 2011 EV/EBITDA, generally only present themselves
during bouts of fear. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down for the
year, as of the close of business on Friday, May 7th, 2010. Clearly, this
appears to be such a time.

Visa is also currently selling for a valuation well below its growth rates in
revenue, EBITDA and earnings. I consider the shares of Visa to be attractively
valued. Visa has recently increased their merchant assessment rates, to be
effective July, 2010. Q3, 2010 earnings for Visa could surprise to the upside.
I will seek to increase the RMG#1 position in Visa shortly.

On Friday, May 7th, 2010, I added to my personal position in Mastercard.

Mr. Gogo,

Several of my friends and I were talking about this at lunch the other day.
Ages from 30-43 or so. I'm 40. The folks younger than me both wished they could
already use it, and were excited that so many of the new phones in developement
were planning for this feature. Me (40) and my older friend(43) weren't really
as in the loop, but apparently there is buzz in the younger generation and they
have no attachment to V/MC cards themselves if the phone will do the trick.

One had seen it work and said you just push a button on your phone when
checking out and you're done.

I asked them about the underlying tech/who the companies were and they didn't
know if it was the banks, the charge cards, or some other player involved, but
the feature itself was highly desirable. They could care less how it was
provided as long as it worked. I got the impression most smart phone users will
immediately start using it in place of traditional debit/credit transactions as
soon as they can.

anyhow, fwiw.

Some activity today - mostly raising cash for some new positions:

MSFT - scaled back my position today by half to a more normal size.
Conversations on the thread helped me realize I should probably take some off
the table. It was over 10% of portfolio and I was thinking about it too much.
Back to normal size position now.

LLY - sold. Decided I'm leaving pharmaceutical exposure to the Fidelity sector
mutual fund. I clearly have no advantage here and need to stay away.

WDC - doubled up position after it dropped considerably in the past few days on
no news. W/ rest of tech holding in pretty well seemed reasonable.

AFAM - took some off the table.

Will look to redeploy into a new positions in near future.

Do these sales complete your year end tax loss selling?

With the new tax bill now passed, I completed my year end tax loss selling
today. I do want to add to some of my positions I sold but will have to wait 31
days to re-enter.

I have noticed that several of these very low priced stocks (ie penny stocks
and several of those below $2.00/share especially those sold in the pink
sheets) can be scooped up at significant discounts to their typical trading
range. I suspect this is due to tax loss sellers taking the bid price on "at
the market" orders. I will be watching these closely and setting my GTC BUY
orders just below these prices and may get lucky.

It's not a very efficient market (ie the Pink Sheets) and one's persons loss
can be another's gain

Phone payments: users may want it - only if it's painless and secure though!

The big problem with adoption is point-of-sale infrastructure. It's difficult
to persuade retailers to add anything at the POS. Look how chip cards failed in
US and that was perhaps smaller change than phones. How often have you used
Blink, Paypass or Paywave? Almost nobody even heard about them even though they
are Chase's, MasterCard's and Visa's technologies. Europe and I think Japan are
somewhat better about this, but retailer adoption is the real threshold for any
pay innovation. Companies have tried to push phone payments for almost ten
years now with very little success. It might be that some app on iPhone will
break the market someday, but I wouldn't hold my breath for massive adoption.

Hi Mr. Gogo -

Harvesting Tax losses

Several of my positions include a few higher priced shares that are under
water. Since the new tax bill was signed into law today, I did not need to save
these losses for next year but rather use them now to off set some of my gains
for this year. Many times I will re-enter the position in 31 days if I feel the
company is still undervalued. I continue to build my core position(s) to lower
my overall cost basis.

Some of these include:

RAS*, Drys, SVU, ERF, BDN, NOK, PBR

(* might be a candidate for closing out the position)

I match my lot sales and am always harvesting losses through out the year when
appropriate. This is different from portfolio re-balancing and/or closing out a
position.

The only one I closed out today was DEEP DOWN, INC. (OTC BB: DPDW.OB ) which
really never worked out. I needed to book the loss as I had larger than
expected booked profits for the year.

I try to complete my tax loss selling early in December hopefully front running
the other sellers that tend to do their selling at the end of the month. I
typically do a lot more buying in the last week of December cherry picking the
bargains that investors are selling for their losses.

With a portfolio of around 90 positions and establishing a position with
several buys over time, there are always gains and losses I can book during the
year. The key for me is end of year efficient tax management, maintaining low
overall costs basis on my long term core positions, being disciplined to peel
off shares from my winners and recognizing when I am wrong and closing out
those positions.

Thanks for the reply. The ones I can think of are BYD(Boyd Gaming) and CMT
(Compton petroleum). I will add to my call options position in NOK and if he
price drops nicely I will buy the stock, but I doubt it will go too much down
because of the dividend.

Why would DRYS be a tax sale?

Re: Drys

I still have some very high priced shares from 2006 & 2008 that have a cost
basis in the $18.00/share range. I recently bought an equivalent number of
shares earlier this year in the $4.10/share range. I was going to book my loss
on the higher priced shares next year but w/ the new tax bill, I decided to do
it this year. When the dust settles, I will have my position established with a
much lower cost basis.

I still think DRYS could be valued in the $14.00/share range if (1) their deep
ocean drilling subsidiary is able to lock in some long term lease contracts for
their new rigs under construction and (2) BDI rates increase w/ economic
expansion.

The company still has tons of debt, the stock has been diluted over 400% w/
three different special stock offerings but the company is well positioned to
take advantage of any extended uptrend in their business.

My new position represents less than .5% of the portfolio but now with my new
cost basis it provides me good exposure in this sector.

Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR) is another shipper in the portfolio. It's a
much larger position than DRYS. I have been building my position since 2008. My
cost basis is quite low as I was lucky to add shares in the $2.00/share range
in late 2008. My price target is $15.00/share by 2011-2012 as the company
continues to benefit from their capital investments made in 2009-2010. Their
three different business operations should do quite well as Brazil leads the
world economic recovery. If you scan the thread for ULTR you can read my posts
over the years.

As you can see, I am patient w/ my investments and will continue to add shares
over time if the company story remains compelling. My timing was a bit off on
ULTR w/ my first buys occurring in early 2008 around $10.00/share. My high
priced shares have been written down and the value proposition has improved
significantly. This one will be a 4-5 year hold and I hope to sell my last
shares in the $15/share-$18.00/share range.

Every stock has it's own story and value proposition. I am working on cutting
down my average holding period to 36 months.

re smartphone payment system -

I consider the current credit card/ debit card system antiquated and I think we
will see a massive change in the next five years. The catalyst will be adoption
of the smartphones. They have build in just about everything needed to make a
design a save transaction process - a powerful computer, sensors (camera,
microphone), they are instantly connected and most importantly - the younger
generation (ha, I am not one of them) lives with these things.

But I agree there are infrastructure hurdles and many participants (merchants
etc.) are not tech savy. So somebody has to come up with an indigenous solution
to generate a large enough user base. I believe that this might well involve,
V&M (they have a network, customer relationships etc. in place) but those may
not want to endanger their existing business. Somebody like GOOG or Paypal
(works already on PC's) could well be involved or a large bank , or the major
wireless providers (again they have infrastructure but are not particular tech
savy). Who know? But I think it will be done because it makes sense.

Having a bunch of plastic around with simple magnetic coding based on 70's
technology does not make sense, if you have a powerful computer in your pocket
that can transmit 10 MBIT/sec of data (4G speed).

I think with the shipping companies you will have to wait a bit longer for the
following two reasons.

China has to slow down.

Over capacity in the shipping business. By 2007 many ships were ordered for
construction.

What worries me a lot is that the BDI index is going steadily down since
September, from almost 3000 to 2000.

Good luck with it.
