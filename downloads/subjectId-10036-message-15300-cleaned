PALM: Stepped to the sidelines @.96. This spike appears based on rumors of
potential takeover by either Dell, Apple or Sony. All would be credible
purchasers with 4 to 6 Billion in cash apeice...[PALM even at $2 would have an
EV <$1B]and all are either in [SNE] or have indicated an interest in getting
in[DELL & AAPL], the handheld biz...but I'm just real suspicious of one day 35%
spikes. Even if one or more of the above is sniffing around, I'd expect some
denials. Also the CEO bought 250k shares on 8/9...a definite positive...but, if
there had been DD contacts, he would be leaving himself open to insider trading
charges if deal were announced.
It wouldn't surprise me if they do get taken out, but I would expect some
pullbacks from todays speculative run-up. If I'm wrong, I'm still happy with
the 35% since 8/9.

I'll swap a little of BL for more BFCFB.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=bl+bfcfb.ob++bbx&d=t

Both undervalued imo. I'm less comfortable with BL's business (catalog clothes)
than I am with BBX's business. BL seems stuck in a rut, and I'm able to take
some profits in BL.

Those are the surface reasons. Digging a bit deeper there's this too though:

1. Selling an undervalued stock to buy one that is presumed to be even more
undervalued is, imo, a poor way to make investment decisions. For me, I've
found it does not work. It should, but it does not. Because...

1a. I really can't evaluate either company well enough to balance prospects of
one company against another.

1b. There's no telling if/when either of these stocks will have some surprise
catalyst to pop the stock.

2. Once I notice that I'm selling for "comfort" reasons, that's when I know
there's a psychological component. Value stocks like BL and BBX (BFCFB) ought
to work by the numbers. Comfort should have nothing to do with it.

all just my opinion and bs.

taking a loss under those circumstances makes no sense and there aren't many
screaming buys to jump into instead (I have pretty full positions in the value

DXT. Well, an analysis of DXT similar to yours was actually used by Dr. Graham

So it's nice to see 'ole Dixon mentioned here.

Your post shows total long term debt as: 32.6M + 1.9M.

The Co.'s Aug. 14 filing lists long term debt as $47.2M.

I'm not understanding that apparent discrepancy.

There's also in that 8/14 filing, capital lease obligations of $5M. Dr. Graham
has said to subtract that out too for the net-net calculations.

this co were in growth portion of lifecycle, but not so ok in mature/declining

Low Price/sales is often a trap when looking at high debt companies.
From a business standpoint...pencil manufacture hits me like textiles or broom
making, something where it's going to be tough to compete with low labor cost
economies. Yesterday, I bought a pack of 4 mechanical pencils at a dollar store

fwiw: The company may be moving towards utilizing low cost overseas labor as it

Pencils seem like a competitive market and a tough business, but Dixon
Ticonderoga must be good at it by now <g>. Curious whether established customer
base over the past (several hundred?) years with school districts and others
might provide some advantage for Dixon compared to newer entrants. Many
memories of chewing a Dixon and Ticonderoga during school days (some
Faber/Castells too). Perhaps their art supply line and a Warner Bros. licensed
Looney Tunes and Scooby Doo lines might distinguish them from no-name
competitors.

Past earnings seem to average around $1.5 million per year (excluding $9
million gain on sale of sale of its U.S. Graphite and Lubricants division in
1999) (the average, however, does not account for any Graphite Lubricants
division earnings). Seems if things are turned around a bit the company could
be trading at higher levels. What could make it trade at much lower levels?
Obsolete inventories? Failure to restructure debt.

(An aside: Recall reading a story about Armand Hammer owning a pencil factory
in Russia at one time back in the 1920s. Not sure it was too successful a
venture for him).

Dixon had $ 90 million of revenues last year. Pencils were but one of its many
products. See below. Company has been moving a lot of their operations to
Mexico.

The Company manufactures its leading brand Ticonderoga(R) and a full line
of pencils in Versailles, Missouri. The Company manufactures and markets
advertising specialty pencils, pens and markers through its promotional
products
division. The Company also manufactures and markets Wearever(R) and Dixon(R)
pen
writing products as well as Prang(R) and Ticonderoga(R) lines of markers,
mechanical pencils and allied products.

In Sandusky, Ohio, the Company manufactures (mainly for wholesale school
suppliers and retailers) its Prang(R) brand of soy-bean based and wax crayons,
chalks, dry and liquid tempera, water colors and art materials. This division
also manufactures special markers for industrial use, all of which are marketed
and sold together with the products discussed above, by the U.S. Consumer
division.

Under an agreement with Warner Bros. Consumer Products, the Company also
markets in Canada and Mexico a line of pencils, pens and related products
featuring the famous Looney Tunes(R) and Scooby Doo(R) characters.

Dixon Ticonderoga Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary with a distribution
center in Newmarket, Ontario, and a manufacturing plant in Acton Vale, Quebec,
Canada, is engaged in the sale in Canada of black and color writing and drawing
pencils, pens, lumber crayons, correction materials, erasers, rubber bands and
allied products. It also distributes certain of the school product lines. The
Acton Vale plant also produces eraser products and correction materials for
distribution by the U.S. Consumer group.

Grupo Dixon, S.A. de C.V., a majority-owned subsidiary (97%), is engaged,
through its subsidiaries, in the manufacture and sale in Mexico of black and
color writing and drawing pencils, correction materials, lumber crayons and
allied products. Grupo Dixon also manufactures and sells in Mexico, under its

Beijing Dixon Ticonderoga Stationery Company, Ltd., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, is engaged in the manufacture of wood slats for
pencil manufacturing and the sourcing and distribution of certain consumer
products for international sale by the Company.

The Company's international operations are subject to certain risks
inherent in carrying on business abroad, including the risk of currency
fluctuations, currency remittance restrictions and unfavorable political
conditions. It is the Company's opinion that there are presently no material
political risks involved in doing business in the foreign countries (i.e.

You made a couple of astute observations:

1)The company has been moving towards utilizing low cost overseas labor as it
owns facilities in Mexico.

2) They do have great relationships with school districts.

The senior lenders put a "squeeze" on the subordinated debt holders since they
did not like the terms of the subordinated debt. Go look at stock chart where
price was
around $ 4 in August 2001 when this problem arose.

I ask if the debt is now being restructured should not the price rise to prior
levels? Note that book value is approximately twice the $ 4.

As previously stated the stock is selling at approximately
20% of book value now.

The major shareholder is 73 years old. He bought a substantial block a couple

Dixon is clearly not a net-net stock, a margin of safety stock, or a common
stock holding worth the price of admission. Dixon has a high debt level and
loan covenants which will -- in time imo -- turn ownership over to bond
holders. Debt being refinanced at a 12% level -- as with DXT -- is not a

I think "brinks" is onto something in Dixon common stock. Although "brinks"

following reasons:

1) high margin of safety
2) excellent balance sheet
3) top manager is old
4) debt is refinanced at a reasonable level of 12%
5) pencil business offers high ROE
6) investment firm is seeking "strategic" partners (possible buyout by GE)
7) consistent earnings
8) a high cash to debt level
9) insider buying of common
10) auditors feel company is really a mover-and-shaker

DXT: When I made original comments on this, I had not run across the 'going
concern' warning. This pretty much means, 'Stick a fork in it, it's done.'
Analysts and auditors are suffering lack of credibility for assymetric reads on
companies: Their analysis tends to be positively biased by relationships and
financial incentives. This doesn't necessarily mean they are stupid or
incompetent, just paid to express a more positve view than is sometimes
warranted. So...when an analyst says 'sell' or an auditor issues a 'going
concern' warning, they are swimming AGAINST the tide of bias based on
considerably more information than the average investor will have at hand. Both
are rare calls and should be given considerably more weight than positive
takes. That said, there are times when the price overdiscounts even the most
negative opinion. I just don't think that's the case with DXT based on debt

because of the contingency pertaining to the subordinated debt renegotiation.
Nothing more nothing less. I already explained this was due to senior debt

Just exactly what is it that you want to point out on the 13D filings of NIAG?
That form is not really for commentary. The most recent 13D shows that Schloss
has divested himself of all ownership, and it looks to me like they did so at a
loss. The $2.50 sale price is much lower than the $3.00+ average they posted
when they filed the 13D 6 months or so earlier.

How do you see this relating to Dixon? The message I would get is that if one
were to buy Dixon now, they could sell in 6 months or so and experience a 20%
or so loss. I suspect that is not the message you were trying to convey, hence

<<As a CPA a qualified opinion such as Dixon's does not mean 'Stick a fork in

bankruptcy...considering 'it's done' to mean bankruptcy. Studies have shown
only 20 to 25% of firms with 'going concern' opinions subsequently file. Just
for funsies, I plugged DXT's numbers into a spreadsheet with several bankruptcy
prediction models [Altman, Beaver, Springate...] 5 of 5 predicted bankruptcy. A
6th model, Altman modified for non-manufacturing co's only showed it as 'weak'
but since DXT is a manufacturing co. I didn't see it as relevant.
So does the combination of the GCO and 5 model predictions mean that DXT is
'done'...nope...all models and methods have significant error rates in
forecasting bankruptcy of firms that don't file. The models are significantly
more accurate than the GCO's though:
http://www.westga.edu/~bquest/2000/bankrupt.html
Despite the current unfreindly view of the credit markets towards risky
borrowers, DXT may yet wiggle out of trouble.
That said, I don't see debt adjusted [EV] multiples that reflect the risk or
justify even a speculative bet at current price levels....but I've been wrong

SWRG <<little ltd>>Unless you count Op leases: From Q 'As of July 1, 2002, our
future minimum lease payments of our headquarters and restaurants are as
follows: 2002--$2.5 million; 2003--$5.2 million; 2004--$5.3 million; and
thereafter--$66.7 million' This ~80mm is over 2x the 32mm market cap.
None of the above should be construed as a negative take on SWRG, just food for
thought when investing in restaurants and other businesses with lot's of
buildings.
I'm frankly not sure just how to incorporate off balance sheet obligations,
like Op leases, but I'm pretty sure it's a mistake to ignore them. So far, I'm
incorporating them in EV multiples as if they were LTD, but either putting
lease payments in the denominator or discounting the Op lease total by 33% to
adjust for interest. From a strictly balance sheet perspective, it may be
improper to just plug them in as debt since they are a form of financing...If
the buildings were conventionally owned and financed, the buildings would be
shown as assets offset by the mortgage debt liabilities. So if the Op leases
are considered a liability, some sort of offsetting 'asset plug' would seem
appropriate so it approximated the owned asset/mortgage approach. Not sure what
to use for this, but just dropping the op lease total in without some sort of
balancing adjustment doesn't sound right.

Thanks for your interesting comments.

DXT is a mystery trying to quantify downside risk. The inventory is troubling,
but not so much the receivables, and there isn't much cash. Might be difficult
finding a margin of safety from these current assets as espoused by Graham.

Pencils have been around for many years and I expect will continue being around
for many more years to come, at least over the horizon of the next ten years.
Its a business, not a great business, a competitive business. Not sure the
industry is in the dire straights of the buggy whip business. At last count,
DXT sells $90 million worth of pencils per year - albeit on recently declining
sales. Seems there might be continued need for pencils but also on a declining
basis.

I remember similar thoughts when I purchased General Cigar Holdings (very
little cash;lots of tobacco inventory, tobacco lawsuits hitting hard at the
time) and FIT (lots of textile inventory and I believe sizably more cash) and a
few other net nets brought up on the board here (Blair, EBSC, SCNY (lots of
sneaker inventory, little cash), SPOR (lots of cash); GTSI, BAMM, FRD, ISTN,
MAXS. Holding true to Graham theory, a diversified mix of these worked out
pretty well.

My feeling is, and what I gather from reading Graham, safety is found in the
assets. On that basis there might not be much safety here. However, adding to a
diversified portfolio of companies trading 2/3s below cash assets might make
the risk tolerable, although if you can't quantify downside risk why bother or
rather don't bother. Discounting the inventory by half and the receivables by
1/3 leaves insufficient debt coverage. However, maybe I am discounting those
assets too much.

However, perhaps the liquidity crisis precipitated an unusual opportunity --
purchasing net current assets at below 2/3s their value. In the past the
company exhibited fairly strong cash flows. I believe they are on target
generating approximately $3 million free cash flow this year and did about the
same in 2001 and the debt/equity ratio has also been on the decline.

Still on the fence with this one.

Bob Rudd, you're right, I should be taking account of operating leases somehow
in my evaluation. There should be some consideration of the leases on the asset
side too because the leases provide an economic benefit; here I'm also not sure
what to use for an appropriate "capitalization".

As those numbers you provided show, lease expenses are expected to more than
double next year, an increase of $2.7M. That's about a 29 cent additional hit
to the pre-tax bottom line. Not so insignificant an amount, it would seem.

Funny you should ask. I sold just before they announced their proposed
liquidation. I came across them again recently and saw they were trading
between $7 to $8 per share and began looking at the financials.

As of May, 2002 they had $90 million cash and short term investments. Total
debt $9 million. FIT caps out at $41million on today's price per yahoo. Looks
like its trading roughly 51percent to cash assets not including inventory or
receivables (totaling a combined $18 million),

"On March 1, 2002, Fab Industries, Inc. announced its Board of Directors'
approval of a plan to pursue a sale of its business in the context of a
corporate liquidation." (per 8k).

The currently pay a 5% dividend.

I thought I read somewhere that they paid a special dividend but their balance
sheet looks almost the same for December 2001 and May 2002.

Seems like this could be a nice special situation.

This is from June 1, 2002: " On May 30, 2002, the Company filed a report on

Timba: <<what is a sure-fire bankruptcy score, according to each
formula?>>There is no sure-fire method of predicting bankruptcy...although some
of the models tested over 80% accuracy, I suspect that's an exaggeration. Here
are scores:
Altman's Bankruptcy Predictor (or Z-score) calculation.
Z = (1.2*X1)+(1.4*X2)+(3.3*X3)+(0.6*X4)+(1.0*X5)
X1= Working capital/ Total Assets = WC/TA
X2= Retained Earnings/ Total Assets = RE/TA
X3= EBIT/ Total Assets = EBIT/TA
X4= Market Value of Equity/ Book Value of Liabilities = MVE/ BVTL
X5= Total Sales/ Total Assets = TS/TA
The Altman Z-score is used to determine a company's short-term outlook or
future viability, where,
>3.0 ... Strong; 1.8-3.0 ..... In Danger & <1.8 ..... Near death
Notes: USE ANNUALIZED FIGURES for EBIT and Total Sales when using data from a
quarterly report.
Market Value of Equity is the combined market value (market price X shares
outstanding) of all shares of stock, including common and preferred

ALTMAN modified for Non-Manufacturing & Service Firms The X.sub.5 (Sales/Total
Assets) ratio is believed to vary significantly by industry. It is likely to be
higher for merchandising and service firms than for manufacturers, since the
former are typically less capital intensive. Consequently, non manufacturers
would have significantly higher asset turnover and Z scores. The model is thus
likely to underpredict certain sorts of bankruptcy. To correct for this
potential defect, Altman recommends the following correction that eliminates
the X.sub.5 ratio:
Z.sub.11 = 6.56 X.sub.1 + 3.26 X.sub.2 + 6.72 X.sub.3 + 1.05 X.sub.4
The predetermined cutoffs for the Z score are as follows:
Bankrupt BK? less than 1.1 Weak 1.1-2.6 Strong greater than 2.6
The Zmijewski model is a weighted probit bankruptcy prediction model. The X
statistic is purportedly a surrogate for the probability of bankruptcy.
X = - 4.3 - 4.5 X1 + 5.7 X2 - .004 X3 (1)
X1 = net income/total assets;
X2 = total debt/total assets;
X3 = current assets/current liabilities;
X = overall index est of probability of bankruptcy
<<I don't have Altman's book (although it is now on my list)>>I asked Prof.
Altman which of his books he'd recommend for distressed investing...his
response was to recommend 'Bankruptcy Investing' by Branch and Ray [I found it
on EBAY for ~5, but that was luck - it's out of print] My favorite on the
topic, though, is Principles of Corporate Renewal by Platt, which is considered
the 'textbook' of the turnaround industry.

Since I'm long RYL, I'm glad you don't have another car with plates that say

I don't understand the paired trade, long BZH and short RYL. They look like
they're positively correlated, up together and down together.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BZH&d=c&k=c1&c=ryl&a=v&p=s&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l

I've got BZH on my watch list, and many times I have considered starting a
position. I've always concluded that there's no advantage in adding BZH to my
portfolios because I'm already covered in the sector with several stick
builders, and all these companies seem to rise and fall together. Of course the
advantage would have been -- and maybe for now as well -- is that had I bought
BZH I would've made additional profits.

At current prices, the stock is attractive. I may nibble yet.

I haven't taken profits out of any of the home builders I own for a while. I've
bought a little more DHI recently because of its multi-decade increase in sales
and earnings growth, its low p/e, and its estimates of sales and earnings
increases this year.

I have sold or trimmed what I call ancillary stocks though. Out of WHR months
ago, and have cut back just a bit of BMHC and USI. I'm still holding others: I
own GFF, and like it at current price. I have FAF; sorry I am that I was too
slow to pick up CCR when it hit lows couple of weeks ago.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=whr+bmhc+usi+faf+ccr&d=t

I don't know anything about hedges as regards home builders. Maybe short
apartment REITs. (Increasing vacancies? People moving out of apartments to buy
homes, given the low interest rates, or moving because of unfortunate financial
circumstances?) Short MYG or WHR? I sold my PLD because I believed there'd be
excess distribution space with their Northern California properties (Problems
in Silicon Valley). Maybe so, but the stock has moved up nevertheless.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=myg+whr+pld&d=t

I'm not one for hedges. (Or shorting.) If the stock can't stand by itself as a
value play, then it shouldn't be bought. If it is a value play, then on this
thread, it's a buy without having to have it hedged.

* The timing of this given the weak sales environment has led some to add one

* We think the stock represents exceptional value especially at these prices

Dreman's latest column on Forbes.com:

The Contrarian
The Time to Buy
David Dreman, 09.02.02, 12:00 AM ET

Bear market or no, there are superb opportunities too enticing to pass up.
While a recovery likely is far off, the current carnage has left fine stocks
undervalued.

Buy stocks when blood flows in the streets. That old maxim is still true--up to
a point. You also must pay attention to valuations. This summer we're awash in
gore. The tech-loaded Nasdaq 100 is down 45% this year and 81% from its March
2000 high, almost what the Dow dropped from its 1929 high to its 1932 low. The
S&P 500 has lost 23% in 2002 and 44% since March 2000. This year's second
quarter was the second worst (after 2001's third quarter) since the bear market
bottom in the July-September quarter of 1990. The way things are going, the
current quarter could make them all look mild. This bear market has evaporated
$7 trillion in U.S. equity values. Note that the 1987 crash cost investors only
$1 trillion.

Accounting scandals, conflict-ridden analysts, weak economic statistics and
rotten earnings aren't exactly laying the foundation for a turnaround soon. The
decline in investor savings has a double-barreled effect. It restricts the flow
of funds going into equities, and it reduces consumer spending as awareness
spreads that the great bubble stocks of the late 1990s aren't coming back
quickly.

Now look at the valuations. Stocks are a lot cheaper than they used to be, but
they're not exactly cheap. Companies in the S&P 500 index are supposed to earn
a composite $34 per index unit this year (after writeoffs), making the forward
price/earnings ratio equal to 25. That's high, relative to past market P/Es.
The Nasdaq 100, built on recklessly optimistic forecasts, has an estimated P/E
for 2002 of 35, near a bubble multiple, with no sign that tech spending is
increasing and that the 45% earnings gains forecast for next year will
materialize.

What many investors and Wall Streeters forget is that the bubble, particularly
in tech stocks, was the largest in market history. The broad averages quite
possibly will go nowhere for several years as companies struggle to get "real"
earnings back to their 2000 levels.

This market reminds me a lot of the period from the mid-1970s to 1982. Back
then stocks trailed gold, diamonds, collectibles, stamps, bonds and even T
bills. But as bleak as the picture was, value stocks thrived as investors
returned to fundamentals such as good earnings growth, strong balance sheets,
high dividend yields, low P/Es and trustworthy accounting.

In today's panicky environment many good stocks get trashed along with the
dogs. Now is the time to load up on the good ones at cut-rate prices. Once
investor confidence returns, you will be rewarded. Here are several to look at:

Tobacco stocks have been massacred lately by some nasty jury verdicts (for
example, the $105 million Boeken award for a single smoker, in a California
case). These verdicts have a way of being overturned. Note, too, that even the
staggering $250 billion settlement with the states in 1998 didn't kill
earnings; the cigarette companies just passed their legal costs along in price
increases. So I recommend RJR (nyse: RJR - news - people ) (58), whose stock is
down 18% since mid-June. RJR should earn $8.04 a share this year and $8.71
next. It has a trailing P/E of 8 and provides a well-covered 6.5% yield.

Philip Morris (nyse: MO - news - people ) (49), down 18% from its 2002 high,
should see a 20% increase in earnings this year and 12% next. The company (P/E,
11) has increased its dividend in every year of the post-World War II era and
currently yields 4.7%.

Fannie Mae (nyse: FNM - news - people ) (74) has grown at a 15% clip for three
decades and is likely to continue to maintain this rate. So why does the stock
change hands at a mere 13 times trailing earnings? Investor fears that Fannie's
(and partner Freddie Mac's) earnings will be severely curtailed by new
restrictions from its supervisory agency, the Office of Federal Housing
Enterprise Oversight. The regulations have not been proposed yet. At worst,
they will clip only a percentage point or two off Fannie's growth rate. The
stock yields 1.9%.

Another Wall Street leper is Bristol-Myers Squibb (nyse: BMY - news - people )
(24). This stock has tumbled from an alltime high of 76 in October 1999.
Bristol has been hit by a number of problems--mostly of its own doing--from

in ImClone, to allowing an embarrassing gap to develop between the expiration
of patents and the introduction of the next generation of blockbusters.

All the same, Bristol's earnings should be up 32% from 2002's depressed levels
and continue to grow at 11% to 12% over time. At its current depressed price
the company is ripe for a takeover offer. Bristol's price/earnings ratio is an
affordable 12 and it yields 4.7%.

Dreman may be an astute investor - in fact I hold his KDHAX in my 401(k) - but
his analyses in the article are on the soundbyte level. For example, the thing
that concerns me with FNM and FRE is not the regulatory restrictions, but their
very high and increasing exposure to loan losses. I am no expert, but it seems
that they are mortgaging the farm (pun intended) to obtain more and more
mortgage loans on smaller and smaller asset coverage. It is very hard to
understand what is exactly their exposure, and it makes me nervous that company
may fall like a house of cards. It may work out fine, but like Buffett
mentioned in his decision to sell FRE, it makes one uncomfortable. Of course,
one could argue that FRE/FNM may be bailed out by government in case of
failure. It may not help the shareholders though.

There's a balancing act between interest rates, equities, the dollar, consumer

relationships and where they are today. Jim

http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/latest-digest.html

".. If the USD (US Dollar) is indeed an endogenous variable reflecting the
economic fundamentals of the US and not an exogenous policy tool, as the US
Treasury claims, then a ‘strong USD policy’ makes as much sense as a ‘strong
stock market policy’ or a ‘strong property market policy.’ Not only could the
strong USD policy have outlived its usefulness, it may have contributed to the
financial bubble in the US.. "

Thanks for posting the Dreman column. Like Jurgis, I'm a long time Dreman fan
with several of his books on my shelf. Nevertheless, I'm going to take some
potshots at themes in this column. <<Companies in the S&P 500 index are
supposed to earn a composite $34 per index unit this year (after writeoffs),
making the forward price/earnings ratio equal to 25. That's high, relative to
past market P/Es.>>The problem is looking at a year when earnings are
cyclically depressed to value the market. Based on 76 yr data, veteran
strategist and historian Steven Leuthold says current 5yr normalized PE of 19.3
is close to markets Avg 5yr normalized PE of 18.3, I suspect lower than avg
rates would more than offset the higher multiple...the key to this is that 5 yr
average earnings smooth out the cyclical dips. Dreman likely looks more to
similar measures of earnings power when buying companies suffering a temporary
earnings misses.
Tobacco stocks: I've yet to see a value investor explain how to bracket
litigation risk. Everybody thought asbestos was no longer a threat 5 years ago,
then it jumped up and bankrupted a slew of companies. The tobacco companies
will offer interesting speculative trades at moments of maximum pessimism and
shorts when everyone thinks litigation is no longer a threat, but over the
longer term I suspect plaintiffs and lawyers will own the cashflow of these
companies.
BMY [& MRK, SGP..et al]: What Dreman describes as a temporary gap between
expirations and the next blockbusters, may be more a matter of the peaking of a
method...the approach big pharma's take in developing 'new' drugs may no longer
be able to do much more than replace expirations even when viewed over longer
time frames that iron out gaps. The FDA is taking an increasingly dim view of
attempts to wring extra years out of old formulas by tweaking them [a sign the
development well is becoming depleted]. The future of development probably lies
with biotechs where big pharma plays more of a distribution & marketing
role...at lower margins than come from patents. The longer term result will be
mid single digit earnings growth and the market multiple that generally
produces, not a return to 2x market multiples that soaring growth from new
blockbusters produces, as Dreman implies.

Bob,

I don't own tobacco companies for reasons you gave, except through KDHAX.

Given your comments on pharmas (BMY, MRK, SGP), I would be interested to hear
your more detailed valuation of them. Would you buy here? If not, at what
level? Or not at all? Any other thoughts?

I own BMY and SGP using a model that assumes forward going ROE at 25% and
predicts ~17% annualized return. If ROE drops to 20%, the return drops to 11%,
if ROE 15% - return 5%. This seems to say that I would beat market (6-7%
according to Buffett :-))) if pharma ROE does not drop below 17%, which seems
achievable for me. 17% is more than 2 times lower than their 10 year average
ROE...

Jurgis - but Buffett still does not buy pharmas...

Jurgis - Pharma's: I've owned a small position in SGP bought based on cheap
multiples [historically and compared to group] that is about 20% under water.
The preceding post was a synthesis of some of the tentative answers I've come
across to the questions: What's going wrong? and Should I buy more? I really
haven't spent much time doing the kind of quant work you refer to. Your
assessment sounds reasonable in that it takes considerable slowdown into
account. The risk would be an overshoot to the downside as greater recognition
that the game has changed comes about. My guess is that Buffett has stayed away
for 2 reasons: 1) He's well aware of how difficult it is to match prior success
of substantial size...the pharma's have to replace huge revenue streams that
will evaporate with patent expirations, before they can show growth market
expects, 2) He's well aware of his limitations [which I share] when it comes to
evaluating and forecasting the science, technology and cashflows
therefrom...indeed, humility in this regard is the best course given the
difficulty the 'experts' have predicting a blockbuster. I sure can't call em,
but I do see evidence that it's getting tougher....and the market see's it too.
In regard to buying more, I definitely would, but not at these levels. I
haven't settled on specific targets because when those targets would get hit,
the situation would have changed...but anything that knocks them down >20% from
here gets me sniffing around.
To summarize, I'm cautious on the group because I suspect there's secular
change in prospects that might not be fully discounted.

Be careful with using ROE with pharmas; to quote from an 1984 academic study:
"ROE is not meaningful because of necessary intangible investments (such as
staff I presume) and is overstated by at least 20-25%".

A ROE nominally of 25% would then be adjusted downward to around 19-20.

Looking at Israeli Telecom service/software co TTIL I have no position...and

Insiders reportedly own ~46%. Selling off on rumors of bad quarter. 25% of

Software...especially contract software, has been prone to book cooking.
Similar[?] OCH.L has gone from 700 to 2.5 GBX in 2 yr with recent 'aggressive

local and long-distance carriers, cellular/PCS providers, and equipment sellers

argue that TTI's products offer very rapid cost saving payback that enables
them to post gains while others are suffering. The market is clearly skeptical
of that claim despite a long, successful operating history. Israel base
increases risk and decreases reporting transparency...can't get a 20-f

One of the nasty lessons from the bear market - when the herd swamps a value
stock with selling, it's hard to fight the tide at a minimum and could be
suicidal if the selling is masking some serious bad news that the company
hasn't put out yet.

I would rather stock up on little favorites like MAXF where I have a pretty
good idea how their business is progressing. Grabbing a falling knife because a
company looks like a value but the forward earnings are suspect....very risky.

Consolidated Freightways filed for bankruptcy this week; I believe this will

PAUL - NCR: The jewel here is Teradata data warehousing where they are gaining
share and improving margins...looking forward to 10-15% growth over next 2
years in that area. Teradat may at some point be spun to monetize value. Rest
of it is pretty sluggish. An upgrade cycle in Europe to adapt to Euro 1-2 years
ago is slowing atm products. Retail automation is driven by retail capex which
in turn is driven by retail profits...sluggish: MRQ -22%.
Worrisome is this excerpt I came across in a broker report: "Pension income was
down in 2Q from $33 million a year ago to $19 million, but that was still **40%
of pretax income**." Pension income is driven by strong market performance or
playing games with assumptions...neither of which looks promising going
forward. Also, share buybacks just offset options. NCR is selling at 'value
multiples'..but it usually does. I've owned it before but currently have no
position...may buy some on a dip. Meanwhile, a bit more digging into that
pension stuff may be in order. Sorry to be late responding.

Oil service stock discussion
I have been looking at oils service stocks from time to
time. They never seem to be an extremely good value and I
am the first to admit that right now they don't seem to fit
in most value criteria either. However they are tremendous
cyclical plays and at multi-year lows and with the current
healthy oil prices, they are well worth a look, IMO.

Looking at Oil service from a value perspective, i think
that the P/E ratio does not provide an adequate measure.
The reason for this is that the earning quality differs
quite a bit from company to company, depending on what
depreciation rates is being used for the equipment. For a
capital intense business like Oil service, the depreciation
is a very significant expense. I have created a small
spreadsheet to illustrate this. Since I believe that
similar company own similar equipment, the depreciation
rates for oilservice company's should be similar, but they
are not:
DO RIG GSF(2002*) NBR
Revenue (mil$) 885 2820 2000 2225
Net assets (mil$) 2002 8368 4002 2433
Depreciation (mil$) 186 621 254 190
Depreciation time 10.7 13.8 15.8 12.8
Rev/net assets 0.44 0.34 0.50 0.91
Gross margin 49.30% 43% 34.00% 41.71%

As it turns out, DO has the most aggresive depreciation
(they write of their equipment in 10.7 years average) with
GSF being much less conservative (15.8 years). Since DO has
been doing so for years, their equipment is undervalued on
the balance sheet, so they should be able to achieve higher
gross margins a better Revenue/net assets ratio and better
return on net assets - as it turns out the spreadsheet sort
of confirms this.
NBR sort of stands out with a very high Rev/net asset ratio
but in my opinion this is because they are mainly land
driller rather than deep water driller. Land driller is a
mature business, uses simple equipment, is probably more
cyclical and has lower gross margins. This is why I am not
interested in NBR as an investment (it might be a good
speculation though).

I believe that DO is the best company amongst the drillers
also because of other factors, like anticylical investment
strategy (they upgrade their rigs when they are idle and
can afford to do so, because of their very health balance
sheet). Well i hoped i made some valid points here, i would
very much like to see other points of view!

I wonder if you noticed the figure for volume in FLM this week. 161,852,000
shares, on about 50M outstanding. Every share in the company traded more than
three times over in one week. Add that to the short interest of more than 30%,
and it would seem that daytraders are in speculative mode, creating their own
price decline. Just like bidding the price up beyond reason, the game has to
end eventually, only sooner. While a stock can go up indefinitely, there is a
kind of floor on the downside. Buyers will always step in at some price. As far
as fundamentals, looks good. About 3.5 times earnings of about $2.00 this year.
2003 earnings of say, $3.00 gives a p/e of a tad over 2. Nice earnings yield.
About one times next years cash flow (Value Line). If K Mart folds, earnings
hit of fifty cents, but that's priced in at this point, wouldn't you say?
Finances are okay and should improve. Company will announce fate of retail
stores end of this month. I predict they close the worst stores and sell the
ones they can. If they close businesses with a negative profit margin, that
helps next year's margin. No other problems I see except integration of recent
acquisitions, but it seems to be going okay so far. At the recent price perhaps
this is the kind of "cheap hamburger" Warren Buffet rejoices in buying. And
knowing Southeastern Asset Management(Longleaf Partners's Funds)is long is a
