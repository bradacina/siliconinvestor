Good fill Wallace. I had some from before so my averaged cost is 44.86. I'm
showing 96mm shares traded so far...not far from the 79.4 I guesstimated the
indexers would sell + the normal volume of 13.3. Today's price is about where
WMT closed the first day of trading after 911 and about $2.00 above the
intraday low that day....so it takes extraordinary pressure to push it this far
down...and when that pressure dissipates, mayhaps, we be seeing some upside.

Paul, you KNOW I been wrong a bunch of times. Be sure and read that March

SIZING UP SMALL CAPS

Still Decorating

What has always intrigued us about this company is how the devil it has managed
over the years to earn a decent return on equity, and in some years a darn good
one, when any guy with a shed and a few sewing machines can set up shop and
compete.

The company is Decorator Industries. It's small, with a stock-market value of
$25 million, but has been around for more than 50 years and today is far and
away the largest supplier of interior furnishings -- stuff like draperies,
curtains, blinds, bedspreads, comforters and cushions -- to the makers of
manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. It also sells to a growing list
of motels and hotels.

Now no one, obviously, ever mistook this for a sexy business. Yet during the
seven-year span from 1992 through 1998, when shipments of factory-built homes
were humming right along, this Florida-based company earned an average return
on equity of a sparkling 24%, and with very modest debt.

And when the pre-fab housing market fell apart and shipments cratered 65%,
plunging from some 373,000 in 1998 to a mere 130,802 last year, Decorator
Industries, thanks in part to its thriving RV business (which chipped in 60% of
sales last year), stayed solidly in the black.
<img src='http://

Chief Exec Bill Bassett, 68, who owns 12% of the firm and has been running the
show since he took over as president in 1980, credits Decorator's success to a
decentralized team of managers -- entrepreneurs, is how he describes them --
who call the shots at a dozen far-flung facilities in places like Haleyville,
Ala., and Goshen, Ind., and "get rewarded like entrepreneurs."

Service is key. "The orders we're taking over the phone right now," says
Bassett, "75%-90% of them will be shipped or delivered tomorrow." Many orders
are trucked daily some 20 to 50 miles to customers' plants.

Decorator boasts about a third of the market for window treatments and
furnishings for RVs, serving customers like Fleetwood, Thor, Winnebago,
R-Vision and Forest River. And its share of the market for furnishings for
factory-built homes is an even larger 45%. Big customers include Fleetwood and
Champion, as well as companies like Palm Harbor, Cavalier and Southern Energy
Homes.

Bassett is unyielding in keeping a tight rein on expenses. "We're the low-cost
producer," he insists. "I didn't say we charged the lowest price, but we have
the lowest costs."

Decorator's no-frills corporate headquarters in Pembroke Pines, Fla.[near
MIAMI], is in a "pinkish colored strip mall," reported one money manager we
know who visited a few years back. "Inside, it looks like a converted dentist's
office. You walk in and see this little window where you stick your head in and
say, 'I'm here.' "

Bassett cheerfully concedes the place isn't exactly lavish -- "just offices,
desks, chairs, 11 people" -- and the decor did bother Decorator's founder, Earl
Rappaport, who more than once asked, "Bill, why don't you decorate this place?"

But keeping a sharp eye on costs, obviously, hasn't hurt the bottom line and it
also allowed Decorator to briskly expand operations last year. The company
enlarged capacity 50% at its plant in Elkhart, Ind.; bought a new manufacturing
facility in Phoenix, with an eye to sharply expanding into the western U.S.,
and acquired the sewing operations of Fleetwood, its largest customer -- a move
that boosted sales for manufactured homes a hefty 36% in '04. In the bargain,
Decorator inked a six-year agreement to become Fleetwood's exclusive supplier
for both RVs and prefab houses, a pact that can be extended to nine years.

In case you're wondering, margins on the Fleetwood business are as good as any.
"It's the same as for anybody," Bassett reports. "No better, no worse."

Even with factory-built homes in their fifth year of a major recession, on
sales of $50 million, Decorator last year netted $1.7 million, or 58 cents a
share, up modestly from 55 cents in 2003. Thus, with long-term debt at only
9.8% of capitalization, return on equity topped 11%.

Worth noting, however, is that the brisk addition of capacity hurt reported
earnings, not only by increasing start-up expenses but also by boosting larger
noncash charges for depreciation and amortization. Without such charges, before
taxes and interest expense, profits rose an impressive 30% in '04, to nearly
$1.60 a share, up from $1.20 the year before.

At around 8, the stock is going for a modest 1.5 times book, half of sales and
about 14 times depressed earnings. But what's neat to contemplate is what the
company might earn if RV sales kept chugging along and demand for manufactured
homes finally rebounded.

Although it's unlikely RV sales this year will match last year's 370,100 units,
the most shipped since 1978, any decline is expected to be modest. And even if
shipments slip the 3% projected by the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association,
Bassett figures Decorator's RV sales at worst will be flat. While Fleetwood's
RV biz may struggle for a spell, Decorator is gaining share of the total market
as it picks up business from other customers.

As for manufactured housing -- which accounted for a meager 20% of Decorator's
sales last year, a far cry from the 55%-60% it has contributed in the past --
Bassett is cautious about forecasting a vigorous rebound.

But he's firmly convinced the worst is over and notes that Decorator, with
OPERATIONS NOW RUNNING AT A MERE 25%-30% OF CAPACITY, is LEVERAGED TO PROFIT
SHARPLY FROM ANY UPTURN, BE IT GRADUAL OR DRAMATIC[Caps are mine - They can
handle the increased business, and it goes to the bottom line].

When and if the industry does rebound -- if units shipped eventually doubled
from current levels (to get back to the last peak, they'd have to triple) -- on
sales of $70 million or so, Decorator could be earning on the order of $1.50 a
share.

Maybe more.

So reckons hedge-fund manager Bob Robotti of Manhattan-based Robotti & Co., who
believes the cycle is poised to turn and has slowly accumulated almost 20% of
Decorator.

The bottom line: Decorator is a nifty little company, and within a couple of
years, its stock could wind up in the high teens.

The fact is MHCO has had positive earnings most of the last 5 years and with
Katrina, I dont expect that to stop.

Its my impression that MHCO is very competitve with co-op prices.

I am confident that MHCO is a long term survivor either alone or after a
merger/buyout.

The only concern I have is that some of the shares are held by what I consider
"weak" hands. The folks that jumped in merely because the price has increased
dramatically. That could lead to price flucuations which is compounded by the
fact that its a pinksheeter.

Still, in the long run, their increased sales & earnings & book value should
drive the price of the stock higher.

Maybe not dramatically higher, but I feel fairly confident the stock will
appreciate at LEAST 10-15% annualized 2-3 years from now. Obviously, I hope it
would be better than that.

At this point, Im pretty much playing with "house" money as I have sold a
portion and own the rest "free".

As for SPOR....

I am hopeful that now that the "crooks" are gone, things will go better for
them. Their balance sheet is pristine and the fact that they earned 23 cents in
a quarter makes one wonder if that earnings rate is sustainable. IF it is, then
I can easily see an $8-10 shareprice or a buyout at a higher prices especially
if the buying firm can create some merger efficincies.

Its just a little hard to be totally confident that only positive earnings are
ahead given the history of the company and the low insider ownership.

I sold a little but retain most. At the very least, I think low float
speculators & pump & dumpers could continue buying next week which may lead to
higher prices if only temporary.

Im a little disapointed that they didnt even mention their "strategic
alternatives" progress or current status in the press release.

I probably need to call over there. In the past, i dont think I could get
anyone to return my calls. Maybe the new CEO will do so.

DII<<will it ever move- such scant volume - will it be hard to exit the
stock?>> It jumped initially on Katrina so someone knows it's leveraged to
storm related activity. Possible catalysts...Barrons could mention it again.
Prior to the article I posted, Scott Black picked it [@6.74] in early 2004 for
Barron's roundtable. Here's his discussion [2/1/04]:
Scott Black: "We stick to Benjamin Graham's idea of a margin of safety, so we
don't overpay for fads."
Q: What does Decorator Industries do?
Black: They sell drapes, curtains, blinds, pillows, all kinds of furnishings,
primarily for recreational vehicles, which account for 60% of the business.
Customers include Fleetwood Enterprises, Thor Industries, Winnebago Industries
and Monaco Coach. Thor and Winnebago now sell at 20 to 30 times earnings.
Another 20% of the business is manufactured housing. Since 1985 they have also
been selling to the hospitality market. From 1994 to 1998, they made over 20%
on book every year, with no debt. The thing that killed them more recently is
manufactured housing, which fell from a peak of 373,000 units in 1998 to
130,000 at the end of 2003. But the industry is revving up again and is
forecast to produce 155,000 units this year. The company has $3.4 million of
cash and $2 million of debt, so the debt-to-equity ratio is basically zero,
which I like in small companies. You live to fight another day. Stated book
value is $5.07 a share. Minus a little goodwill, it's $4.16, so the stock is
trading for 1.6 times tangible book.

For '03 we expect them to earn 54 cents a share on $42 million in revenue. For
'04, conservatively, if they get a 10% revenue hike with 6.1% operating
margins, fully taxed at 39.6%, they will make 60 cents a share. If they do a
little better because manufactured housing comes back, revenues will be up 14%
to $47.7 million. With 6.4% margins, they earn 65 cents. The stock sells for 10
to 11 times forward earnings. It's close to book value, and the company
generates over a million dollars a year in free cash. I think the stock can get
back to 10.
..........................
When Scott talks about RV's being 80% of the market...you should understant
that this is due to the post 1998 shift in the market from MH to RV's.
Fleetwood was historically more of a MH manufacturer...MH are so similer to
towable mid-size RV' that the two are interchangeable from a manufacturing
standpoint. FEMA is buying both...whatever they can get.
..........................
The key to DII nearterm, though, is really the thesis that MH's & RV's will be
used to house large numbers of Katrina homeless. If new MH's & RV's are used,
DII gets the interior biz. Many MH's & RV's are being bought by FEMA from
dealer inventories...when the dealer replaces that inventory, DII gets the
interior biz. I would also expect that if they recycle FEMA trailers from
Hurricane Charley and/or use repo's, the interiors will need a redo...again
that's DII. And when/if these trailers are eventually resold [I expect these
trailers to get beat like rented mules] an interior redo will be needed. If
these themes play out, then earnings will be the catalyst. As to trading
volumes, that depends on how much money you're pushing around. I would
certainly not suggest taking a huge positon in this or any other microcap.
Daily trading volume averages about 4000 shares which should be enough for most
individuals to get a nibble.
Sorry about the long post.

McSweet:

My SPOR position is quite large given the nature of the company's past
operating performance. Therefore, I have not been a buyer.

I am glad the limit order at $6.25 did not go through. That was a bit of
attempted panic selling. I would rather see how this thing plays out a little.
I think the upside could be pretty good. In 1996 the company earned $2.5
million on sales of $20 million. I believe sales are at about that level again.
Could history repeat itself?

I was tempted to purchase more shares after it dropped off to $5.45 and below
yesterday, but held off for now. I see we broke $5.00 today and perhaps I might
pick some up if it goes a little lower. The highest price I paid for shares was
last November where I picked up shares at $4.50 and $4.75 after the company
announced that they were going to hire an investment banking firm to look into
strategic alternatives for enhancing shareholder value.

The balance sheet should protect downside risk and there may be a terrific
upside now that many of the company's past problems have been resolved and
written off. I've made out well on a few of these turnaround situations --
Bamm, Wlsn, JOB, SCNY. It would be nice to add SPOR to the list.

Net current assets are $5.80 per share based upon the recent 8-K release of
unaudited results. The company carries no long term debt. The price that it
trades presently is quite tempting.

Novartis Hedges Its Bets
Robert Langreth, 09.23.05, 12:00 PM ET

NEW YORK - Over the last few years, the drug industry has gone into a funk,
beset by patent expirations, empty research pipelines and safety scandals. But
Swiss drug firm Novartis seems to keep rolling along.

Led by the cerebral Chief Executive Daniel Vasella, the company has introduced
more drugs in the United States since 2000 than any other drug firm, according
to A.G. Edwards. It has few big patent expirations coming up soon, and
double-digit sales growth. And now it says it has an impressive 52 new drugs in
mid-to-late-stage trials, four of which could be submitted for approval next
year. The company's shares have produced steady if unspectacular returns,
rising over 20% in the last two years, although the stock is basically flat
this year.

Most important, the company has two potential big sellers that it expects to
submit for consideration by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next year.
One, called vildagliptin or LAF237, is a new type of diabetes drug (see:
"Diabetes Drugs To Watch"). The other, aliskiren (formerly known as SPP100),
could be the first in a totally new class of blood pressure drugs called renin
inhibitors (see: "Cardiovascular Drugs To Watch"). The diabetes drug faces
competition from Merck (nyse: MRK - news - people ), which plans to submit a
similar drug in 2006. However, the Novartis (nyse: NVS - news - people ) blood
pressure drug appears to be well ahead of a similar compound in early tests at
Merck and Actelion. Novartis says it has finished trials on over 8,500
patients, with no signs of any serious side effects.

"It looks better than Diovan" in terms of efficacy, Vasella says of aliskiren,
comparing it with the company's big-selling Diovan hypertension drug. "If the
drug proves to be as good as it looks now, it certainly would be a
multibillion-dollar product."

In a clue as to how Novartis might market the drug, Vasella emphasized that the
compound appeared to be particularly good at keeping blood pressure down in the
predawn hours, when it tends to spike. Still, the drug will face tremendous
competition from numerous existing drugs, such as Norvasc from Pfizer (nyse:
PFE - news - people ), as well as various generic compounds. "The road to
success...is likely to be a long and arduous one if for no other reason than
that the hypertension market is well-satisfied," said Prudential analyst Tim
Anderson in a research note this week.

Like a savvy hedge fund manager, Dr. Vasella is constantly adjusting his
research portfolio to ensure profitable output, no matter what types of drugs
end up being the new hot growth areas. Long before it became fashionable,
Vasella established separate specialty- and cancer-drug units to make
biotech-style bets on less common but more severe diseases, supplementing the
traditional big pharma focus on primary care. While these areas might be
smaller in terms of numbers of patients, breakthrough drugs for severe diseases
can command premium prices.

"We have tried to get a portfolio where we have some really breakthrough drugs,
but at the same time we have less risky projects where we know the mechanism,"
Vasella says. Noting the ever-increasing market share for copycat generics,
Vasella has vastly increased Novartis' presence in this area as well.

One of Novartis' more promising cancer drugs is AMN107 for chronic myeloid
leukemia, a successor to the firms' breakthrough drug, Gleevec. Initial trials
showed that the drug could help many patients whose leukemia has become
resistant to Gleevec. Pivotal second-stage trials are underway, and the drug
could be submitted for approval in 2007. Novartis is in a race with
Bristol-Myers Squibb (nyse: BMY - news - people ), which has a similar drug in
testing.

Under the direction of research honcho Mark Fishman, Novartis is also moving
into a number of surprising new areas, including spinal cord injury, cystic
fibrosis and a rare immune system disorder called Muckle-Wells syndrome. His
novel concept is that by testing drugs on less common diseases first, Novartis
can conduct a relatively small clinical trial and quickly get a good idea
whether a new drug is hitting its intended target. This could then pave the way
for longer, more difficult trials for common diseases.

Separately, Dr. Vasella said that purchasing Chiron (nasdaq: CHIR - news -
people ) is not crucial for the Swiss drug firm, and that he would not wait
forever to come to a merger agreement with the biotech firm. The two companies
have been mired in a stalemate ever since Chiron's independent directors
rejected Novartis' offer to acquire the Chiron shares it doesn't already own,
for $40 per share--or $4.5 billion. Chiron's independent directors called that
amount "inadequate" in a statement.

"Everything is possible. We have made our offer, we stand by it, and we wait,"
said Vasella. He added that while it "would be nice" to do the deal, it "is not
a necessity, it is not critical for Novartis." Chiron shares were recently
trading above $43, indicating the market expects a modestly higher bid to
eventually emerge.

I have PFE at a high after split and it has gone down hill from that time on. I
have dollar averaged but reading the post prior to this one about MRK, PFE is
going to certainly face law suits too. How big are their coffers.... to fulfill

<PFE is going to certainly face law suits too.>

Suma,

I don't know on what basis you have come to that conclusion. I think the
decline in PFE is a result of expiring patents and the possible loss of the
Lipitor patent. Also, much new money is going to biotech (ala DNA) rather than
the traditional pharma companies. That said, PFE has some interesting
prospects, including drug candidates from their acquisition of Esperion. I
think the HDL market could greatly enhance its Lipitor franchise.

I only own PFE through multi-year long-term holdings in Vanguard Health. I
might consider buying it at the end of this year.

When VIOX was removed because of allegations of causing heart attacks I thought
PFE had a drug too that was taken off the market for some irregularities...

The price fell about 5 points in one day. That is when I bought more. Then it
recovered to about 27 or a point higher and has been on the decline ever since.

Someone once said dollar averaging was a no no. Maybe Canslim board.However,
friends who have done it have eventually come up smelling like a rose.

You are correct. Focusing on Celebrex, I forgot about Bextra. Even though there
is a risk of litigation, I don't think it will be in the range of what Merck
will face. But obviously that is for the courts to decide. Below is an excerpt
concerning Bextra.

The memo states emphatically--and up-front--that Vioxx, Bextra and Celebrex all
appear to be linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. However,
bucking the arguments made by some experts at the advisory panel that
considered the risks of these drugs, Jenkins and Seligman argue that there is
no way to tell which of the drugs has the biggest risk. The data are murky, and
all OTC painkillers may pose some heart risk, although naproxen--the active
ingredient in Bayer's (nyse: BAY - news - people ) Aleve--is at least easier on
the heart than these three drugs.

Bextra, then, wasn't pulled for its heart risk. It was pulled because it also
has a serious risk of potentially lethal skin reactions. The memo states that
in its relatively short time on the market, there have been seven reports of
deaths as a result of skin reactions to Bextra. These reactions seem to be
reported more often than for other drugs, the FDA officials wrote. The addition
of the cardiovascular risk to the skin side effects convinced the FDA to ask
Pfizer to pull the drug. The authors advised that if Pfizer did not agree,
formal withdrawal proceedings be started.

PFE vs. BMY: I like neither. I own both. I'll hold but not add. (I've already
substantially cut back BMY and PFE holdings over past couple of years.)

I'm not able to assess current or future prospects for these companies. I don't
like BMY management - they've presided over too many screw ups. BMY,PFE current
p/e's etc. would indicate that on an historical basis the stocks are in bargain
territory. The sector seems so very out of favor. Maybe rightly so. Who knows?

I'm adding to Home Depot at current price this a.m. Seem to me to have a
clearer future and at its current p/e, psr may be a better or safer bet for
investing funds now vs. PFE/BMY. OTOH, a couple of new blockbuster drug
possibilities could turn investor psychology quickly favorable for the pharmas.

Hi Paul - My most recent buy was a few shares of BMY last month. All of the
drug stocks are out of favor now but this is the time you really want to buy
them (if you do not own any), when everybody else is selling them. I have
previously owned BMY but it was called away as I had (and continue) to write
cover calls on the stock. My strategy is to sell covered calls through March
'06 as I believe it will be another year before the earnings and share price go
higher. My target is $25-$30 in three to five years along with a good dividend.

I also own PFE and recently sold MRK and JnJ. I am a buyer of JnJ below $55 and
it is the best of the group today. I believe any diversified portfolio should
have some drug company exposure especially as the baby boomer group gets older.

==========================================================
Do you have any opinion on Cypress Semiconductor, their stock value and what
they are doing in solar cell development?

I have been studying the auto sector and believe that the soon to be released
"plug-In" Hybrids will be a hot product if fuel remains above $3.00 per gallon.
Toyota will probably be the first company to release such a "specialized"
product (18 to 24 months). I also heard that Ford will have over 60% of their
products w/ some form of Hybrid technology built in by 2010.

The concept is to "plug-in" your auto over night, run it using the battery
"only" (up to 70 miles round trip at a max speed of 40 mph) and only use fuel
when travel trips are longer and require faster speeds. The electricity for
over night charging would come from the (1) power grid, (2) cost effective
solar cells built in your roof (that's why I like CY) or (3) off grid home fuel
cells.

Toyota is the leader in the NIcad battery technology and can now produce cost
effective long life batteries and are currently having a hard time meeting
present demand.

My only auto holding is GM but I think the better "value & growth" play is in
the components that make this hybrid plug-in strategy work.

P/sales has dropped (I see decreasing rev. growth per Yahoo), and psr ratio is
not attractive now. Basing purchases on forward p/e is risky. CY can be seen to
be an example of this. If I believed it was a value stock, I was wrong. I do
not believe it's a value stock now.

It might be possible to view Toyota as a growth stock story rather than a value

most of my shares. Sorry I did not add at as stock moved up - that was my
original intent, but I guess I've been too surprised to act.

I'm not interested in GM; I may though restart a small position in BMW. Their
sales are strong, and the German economy seems to be doing better now.

My favorite way to play the autos is through the USA retailers: they're pretty
diversified - geographically as well with different brands - and they don't
have the capital requirements of the manufacturers. I hold small positions in
most.

Hi Paul - My longer term price target on BMY is conservative. They do have some
very good potential block buster drugs in their pipe line but it will be mid
2006 before we will really know more. We do know that other drugs they now have
do come off patent so I feel the market has discounted the worse case scenario.
Management may be suspect as you stated but that can be fixed.

So my strategy by collecting the dividend and writing the covered call will net
me just over 8% (per year) while I wait. This is in the IRA account so dividend
and option income compound tax free. A $35-$40 price range is possible in three
years but it really depends on these new drugs in development. I have not built
it into my expectations. I plan to stop writing covered calls next year and
reevaluate my position.

My preferred drug company is JnJ but I recently sold it at $65. I purchased it
in the low $50's about two years ago.

SGP is also an interesting company. They really had management and production
problems which made the stock trade in the low teens. I wanted to buy some
shares but they paid a low dividend and after many months their production
issues were not getting resolved. It looks like they may now have many of these
issues behind them and with the potential of new drugs they have under
development the stock has moved higher. On any sell off below $20, I may pick
up a few shares.

Many of the drug companies are definitely trading near "value" ranges. PE's are
at multi year lows (mid teens) when just a few years ago they were as high 30!
Sometimes you just have to hold your nose and nibble at a few shares.

From:Paul Senior
I2, you always seem to find some challenging stocks to analyze. -g- I recall
RPM & NWL both of which I was wrong on (passed on them), and that you were
right about.

DBD is worth a small bite at current price, imo.

I base this on:
Chairman and Chief Exec. O'Dell who led the company to its success by
international focus. Seems like he is one tough cookie - not going to tolerate
current bad performance. (I suspect he may have not objected strenuously to
resignation of president/coo. -gg-)

Lowest p/sales ratio in ten years. Relatively low p/b (now 2.1 --- avg. in 1999
was 1.98; other years mostly over 3). Increasing book value every year. No ltd.
S&P shows increasing revenue every year of past ten; also increasing dividend
every year.

Initial reaction is that ATM's are everywhere - aren't we saturated yet?. But
reading DBD's site, I see that DBD which is number two behind NCR and these two
companies dominate - the business is 1/2 install of equip. and half service. So
I assume the service business is sustainable even if placements decrease.
(There's also an argument that might be made that there is not saturation of
the US market or foreign, esp. China, India.)

OTOH,
Given what I see as the historical profit margins of the company, I'd be leery
of paying more than 16x earnings for the company. (And many people here would
be leery paying 16x no matter what the company. -g-). Earnings expected to be
about $1.90-2.00. If this proves to be an unusually poor year, then okay. But
if business prospects and results don't seem to quickly improve, then most I'd
want to pay for the stock is $32 vs. current price of about $36.

Scary now for a buyer here as regards apparent perceptions of the company.
Analyst downgrades. Media reports of the stock in a "freefall". Nothing that I
see about the company's prospects or about the balance sheet to keep the stock
from falling further.

I'm interested around current price though. But only for a very small amount,
expecting to hold 18 months or more. And buying with the expectation I might be
fooling myself and hurting myself if I added even more shares should the stock
continue to drop.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=DBD&t=3m&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

I'll put the stock on my watch list.

it appears they have sold all their land. this is a perfect example of a penny
stock with hidden assets. if you look back at their last K you will see their
mining claims listed at just over $7,000 -- however they describe them at
length and the avg investor could easily guess that the land assets were/are
worth considerably more.

bottom line the company netted over 2 million on the sale [land sold for 5.5
million and THMG had 50% interest]. assuming Ron Yankes shares are retired or
put into treasury my math shows around 25 - 27 cents per share in cash for the
company.

dont know what they will do with it -- this company has been around a LONG
time. Ron Yanke -- its largest shareholder was one of the first 3 original
investors in Mircron Technology - Idaho's largest employer.

i added a few shares today on speculation --- like --- it would be nice if they

Hi Paul - These all go in cycles. I finally had a recovery high breakout today
for a company I have been holding just over 24 months. I noticed I started
acquiting shares at $4.50 and more at $7.00/share and $7.50/share. I decided to
take some off the table by selling some April $15 calls.

What stock is this??? El Paso electric EP. Stock got clobbered in 2003 and I
started buying in April 2003. The company has (or had) a lot of assets which
they have been selling to reduce debt. I guess the recent run reflects the
value in their natural gas holdings. Lots of talk on the street that natural
gas prices will be quite higher in the months to come.

I am seeing equivalent moves in the other natural gas and distribution
companies I have been acquiring in early 2003.

This is the nature of value stocks. You buy them when they are out of favor, as
they hit multi year lows and still have a core holding of undervalued assets.
If you wait long enough, the street will come back again and see these stock as
a "must have".

My EP, GLW, HAL,XOM,MRO & CVX are but a few that are the "must have" companies
now. I am sure your basket of undervalue companies will be on the "must have"
list soon. I also think many of the drug companies should be acquired at these
low levels as they are trading at multi year lows too.

FWIW, the term "exchanged gifts" strongly suggests that this isn't a case of
bribery. In my mind it was also important that Meyers, the CEO, resigned. In
other words, no investigation or Inquiries just being reported. Additionally,
something that I have always liked about the company was the following 10-K
description of their business practices.

"The barriers to exit for our lender and marketer clients are high as a result
of the long product life cycles in this market, our unique database, our
specialized processing capabilities, our market knowledge, and our
non-participation in the Federal student loan business. All these factors also
represent substantial barriers to entry for new competitors. Indeed, we have
never lost a lender or marketer client to a competitor, nor has a bank client
ever chosen to end their relationship with us to take their program in-house."

It's hard to find a company, without patents, that still has a wide moat. The
company had a couple of PRs that suggested increased business ties apart from
their core participants. So we'll see.

Paul - I too like HD but I am not convinced we have seen the low. I used to own
this stock which I bought in the low 30's and had it called away at $40 last
year. One way I buy stocks is to sell a few naked puts at a strike price where
I would like to own shares. Today they will pay almost a $1.00/share if you buy
shares at $35 strike price in January. I may sell a few naked puts.

Here is a link to an article dated 2003 (but still relevant today) which shows
those fortune 500 companies that own the most real estate. Home Depot is on
this list and that is one of the reasons why I like this company.
(http://www.buildings.com/Articles/detail.asp?ArticleID=1525)
From the article:...
The Home Depot Inc. (142)
Atlanta, GA
Operates a total of 1,532 stores, including 1,370 Home Depot stores in the
United States and Puerto Rico, which collectively consist of about 137 million
square feet; Home Depot owns approximately 82 percent of them. The company’s
executive, corporate staff, and financial office occupies approximately 1.77
million square feet of leased and owned space in Atlanta. Home Depot also
occupies an aggregate of about 3.3 million square feet for divisional store
support centers, subsidiary support centers, and subsidiary customer support
centers...."

Paul - look at this article and notice the companies that have been merged,
bought out and those that are leaders in their field. What do you think of
Boeing?

Finally, I think Home Depot is doing a good job and is still very competitive.
I have been remodeling my home and buying most everything over the Internet or
through Home Depot. Many of my special order items are still processed through
the Home Depot special order desk. HD is getting better on integrating their
Web portal between the manufacturer, distributor, and the end user. It still
needs work so it can be one click from end user to manufacturer. Home Depot has
the distribution and delivery advantage over every internet seller out there. I
might find an item $5.00 cheaper from an Internet vendor but after delivery
costs, HD beats them hands down. My cherry wood door from Costa Rica was not
only $20 cheaper than my online Internet supplier but I did not have to pay the
$300.00 delivery charge. HD's delivery fee was $0.00 as long as I picked it up
at my local store.

Therefore, I believe their business model works well now and will even work
better once they integrate their Web portal with their manufactures for one
click estimates, ordering and delivery. Contractors will be able to order any
"special order" item from any vendor in the world that can be picked up (or
returned) from their local Home Depot store.

HD corporate needs to work on better electronic billing. They are not able to
link their customer credit card payments to auto pay through client's checking.
You still must cut a paper check or initiate a bill pay request each invoice
period. It's still sloppy and can be improved. They have however implemented an
electronic credit/debit voucher for all items that are returned. No need to
bring in those paper invoices anymore. Just use the tracking on your customer
or corporate HD charge card. Every transaction is encoded in their system and
returns are credited accordingly.

Many of these changes were made in the last 12 months and were driven by their
large IT investments made last year. The company will be using the new RF tags
for inventory control like Wall Mart. This should further help them manage
their store inventory levels.

I like Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) in the retailing sector. HD at 15 PE
and with a dividend of 1% beats out TGT at 19 PE and a 0.8% dividend.

(Like maybe a $500,000 signing bonus if he spends it on stock or a higher
salary to pay him for buying it)

I would like to see some of the other VPs and directors step up before I would
be interested.

I bought some BAMME back at $7.56. Had sold at $9.99. Its back to $9.00

Took an initial position in MEAD based on Paul Sonkins buying and the fact that
its trading at or near net current assets.

Sonkin wrote the book on value investing and he followed me into STRZ. I also
followed him into WSZZ.

Im disapointed in SPOR and myself for my poor trading of the situation.

MHCO is also a little weak but I still feel good about the longer term there.

Wanted to mention EDIN.PK for any of you willing to delve into a cheap

Educational Insights Reports 2004 Year-End Results

Rancho Dominguez, CA - May 5, 2005 - Educational Insights, Inc. (OTC Pink
Sheets: EDIN) announced today that revenue was $25,631,000 for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 20.9% or $4,433,000 compared to
$21,198,000 for the prior fiscal year. The primary reason for the increase was
growth in its core school market which has been the focus of the Company's
strategic efforts for the past four years.

The Company reported an operating profit of $972,000 for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004 and a net loss of $52,000 or $0.00 per share - diluted for
the year as compared to an operating loss of $658,000 and a net loss of
$597,000 or $0.05 per share - diluted in 2003. The net loss in 2004 was due to
a $1 million charge to write-down the carrying value of its option to purchase
The Amazing Live Sea-Monkeys(R) intellectual property. The resulting pre-tax
loss was partially offset by a tax benefit of approximately $540,000 that was
recorded during the fourth quarter to increase the Company's deferred tax
assets to their estimated realizable value.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 46.1% in fiscal year 2004
from 44.6% in 2003. The increase in the gross profit margin percentage is
principally due to proportionally higher sales to the school market in 2004 as
compared to 2003. Gross margins of products sold in the school market are
typically higher than those experienced in the Company's specialty retail and
mass markets.

Total operating expenses increased $724,000 to $10,836,000 for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2004, compared to $10,112,000 for the prior fiscal year.
This increase was primarily a result of increased expenses in the sales and
marketing department stemming from the aforementioned increase in revenue.

Reid Calcott, the Company's President and CEO, stated that he believes that the
Company's operating profit of $972,000, which is an improvement of $1,630,000
over the operating loss of $658,000 incurred in 2003, demonstrates that the
Company's turn around strategy is producing the desired results. He further
stated, "Revenues are up in our core markets and margins are improving overall.
We are gradually returning to the Company's historical business model which
provides for both continued growth and profitability."

He added, "The Company's top priority in 2005 is to solidify our position of
leadership in the supplemental educational materials and educational toys and
game businesses in order to increase shareholder value and strengthen our
ability to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in the near future."

Educational Insights Affirms Continuation of Strategic Focus

Rancho Dominguez, CA - January 14, 2005 - Educational Insights, Inc. (OTC Pink
Sheets: EDIN), in response to inquiries made by several of the Company's
shareholders, announced today that it is not currently engaged in any active
discussions concerning the possible sale or merger of the Company. Reid
Calcott, the Company's President and CEO, reported that from time to time
during the past two years the Company has had discussions with potential
investors in its effort to increase shareholder value. He said that although
the Company has, over the past few years, had preliminary discussions regarding
possible transactions, no such discussions resulted in what the Board of
Directors believed to be fair and viable offers.

Mr. Calcott went on to explain that he believes that, in the near future, the
Company's best strategy for increasing shareholder value is to continue its
current strategy of emphasizing its core education products as this strategy is
producing positive results.

Mr. Calcott stated, "Revenue for 2004 was up approximately 20% over 2003,
making this year the second consecutive year in which the Company's turnaround
strategy has produced an increase in domestic sales volume. In addition, the
Company expects to report an operating profit for the first time in five
years." The Company's formal report on its results of operations for 2004 is
expected to be released at end of the first quarter.

He added that the Company has renewed its license to market Classroom
Jeopardy!? for another five years. Classroom Jeopardy! permits teachers to
present material in the entertaining Jeopardy! format and makes classroom
presentations more interesting for both teachers and students. The Classroom
Jeopardy! product has been enthusiastically received by teachers throughout the
country and positive sales momentum is expected to continue.

Mr. Calcott stated, "All things considered, I believe the Company's turnaround
can now be considered a success. I expect both revenue and earnings to improve
in 2005 which I believe will ultimately increase shareholder value."

He further stated, "Although we will, of course, continue seeking ways to
increase shareholder liquidity, our priorities in the near term are to increase
profitability and to finalize the Company's return to a position of leadership
in the supplemental educational materials and educational toys and game
businesses."

Educational Insights, Inc. designs, develops and markets a variety of
educational products, including electronic learning aids, electronic games,
activity books, science and nature products, board games and other materials
for use in both schools and homes. The Company's product lines, including its
popular GeoSafari? branded products, its classroom version of Jeopardy!? , and
The Amazing Live Sea-Monkeys? product line, appeal to children as well as
students ranging mainly from pre-kindergarten to eighth grade and is designed
to make learning fun.

JOB

For anyone holding JOB, an interesting 13d filing from Daniel Zeff was filed on
September 28, 2005:

Exhibit 2 Expression of Interest

[Zeff Capital Partners Letterhead]

September 23, 2005

Mr. Herbert Imhoff Jr. Chairman & CEO
General Employment Enterprises, Inc.
One Tower Lane, Suite 2100
Oakbrook Terrace, IL 60181

Dear Mr. Imhoff:

As you know, Zeff Capital Partners, LLC ("Zeff Capital") currently owns 511,680
shares of General Employment Enterprises ("JOB") which represents approximately
9.94% of JOB's outstanding stock. We believe that JOB's stock is undervalued
and will remain so until JOB engages in a strategic transaction.

Accordingly, Zeff Capital, on behalf of affiliated investment funds, requests
that the Board of Directors of JOB either increase its poison-pill threshold to
20% to allow Zeff Capital to purchase more shares, or explore a sale of the
company to Zeff Capital or another larger institution. We are committed to
helping shareholders realize the increased value that would result from such a
transaction and hope to work with JOB's board for the benefit of all
shareholders. I also want to let you know that we are subject to applicable
securities disclosure requirements.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Very truly yours,

Daniel Zeff Managing Member

I continue holding JOB and may purchase more shares if the price settles down a
bit.

For any holders of ELSE, Daniel Zeff has been a purchaser of that company as
well:

Paul K. Blakely FLE <<Gulf Stream getting a very big <snip> contract to provide
<RV's> <snip> FEMA was buying up available RVs, but no specific mention of
FLE.<snip> It made me wonder whether "all boats will rise" in the RV
manufacturing business>>
Paul, FEMA's goal is to house homeless ASAP. I may be mistaken, but I believe
Gulfstream makes more upscale RV's than FLE. Analogy: GulfStream = Mercedes,
FLE = Chevy. The purchase of Gulfstream RV's leads me to think that FEMA's
buying anything available...even if it means going further upscale than
necessary to meet the basic objective. FLE is among the most efficient
manufacturers of both RV's and MH's due to economies of scale. They have
several manufacturing facilities near the area [see my post
21978]<transportation is a key cost componant>.
The main concern with my thesis on FLE is not whether FEMA will buy bunches of
MH/RV's made by FLE. It is whether, longer term, the impact of high gas prices
on RV sales and the purchasing capacity of MH downscale consumers, outweighs
this surge in demand. The demographic trend towards RV's is quite strong and a
fall back strategy for consumers who want the RV experience [cameraderie that
doesn't occur in hotels, etc], is to choose closer destinations. Still, it's a
risk IF oil/gas prices stay high [A tough call - I can still rememder the
Economist cover on oil saying it was going much lower - it was @$12/bbl]. As to
MH's, I think we've turned the corner on a long credit-driven drought---Since
most population growth is among a less affluent demographic, the demand for
affordable housing should rise...if zoning laws permit siting.

The following article outlines the upcoming legal decision concerning Lipitor
that I mentioned earlier.

Pfizer Is Expected to Be Active

By MOHAMMED HADI
DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
October 4, 2005

NEW YORK -- Investors expecting an upcoming legal decision to move Pfizer
Inc.'s shares took positions in the drug giant's options.

Pfizer's patents on cholesterol drug Lipitor are being challenged by Indian
generic drug maker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. in the U.S. and abroad. With sales
of Lipitor passing the $10 billion mark in 2004, the importance of the
challenge is self-evident.

One of these cases was heard in the U.K. In a note to clients yesterday, UBS
analysts Carl Seiden and Roopesh Patel said a ruling is expected on Oct. 11.,
and should move Pfizer's shares about $2 in one direction or the other.

Investors who agreed bought October 25 straddles. By buying the October 25
calls and also the October 25 puts, this crowd will benefit regardless of which
direction the shares move as long as that move is more than the cost of the
options.

As Pfizer's shares rose 32 cents, or 1.3%, to $25.29 in 4 p.m. New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the October 25 calls traded 24,318 contracts and
rose 49 cents to $1.05 on the International Securities Exchange. The October 25
puts traded 48,850 contracts and were at 60 cents on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange.

Based on ask prices, the strangle cost was $1.80. A buyer at that price will be
profitable if the stock moves above $26.80 or below $23.20 by the October
expiration date.

Those feeling a little bolder targeted strangles. By buying the October 27.50
calls and the October 22.50 puts, some speculated that the move in Pfizer's
shares will be even greater than the $2 that Messrs. Seiden and Patel predict.

Pfizer's October 27.50 calls traded 19,894 contracts and rose 10 cents to 20
cents, while the October 22.50 puts traded 27,964 contracts and rose 15 cents
to 20 cents, both on the ISE. For a combined cost of 40 cents, based on ask
prices, the strangle is a relatively cheap way to bet on a sharp move.

This activity left Pfizer's implied volatility at 28%, up from 25% on Friday,
according to Track Data.

re EXPE, TSG. I doubled up on EXPE on recent weakness and still hold my 1/2
position in TSG. I have not looked much more into EXPE numbers but i believe
that it trades at 10x EV/EBITDA and about 16x operating earnings - a fairly
moderate valuation for a high quality Web business like EXPE. TSG has done well
recently despite guiding down, a sure sign that the valuation is very low.

Steve's concern that airlines and hotels my go the direct route and promote
their own websites is a valid one and it has indeed happened for quite some
time. But if you put together a more complex travel arrangement (with hotels
,airline tickets etc.) Expedia was the way to go for us. I also believe that
business travel is a big growth opportunity for EXPE and more than likely will
have good margins. in any case, I believe that some weakness in the travel
sector will actually play in EXPE hands as it will allow them to get better
wholesale deals (same happened in 2001).

re PFE, i believe that PFE has a much better chance than 50% to win this case,
so i am holding. PFE is compelling if you assume even minimal growth going
forward. I can see 30$ without any stretch of imagination. Another plus for PFE
is that it's business is fairly insensitive to an economic slowdown, a fact
which could be important going forward.

Masco is down today, as are other home building/remodeling stocks. Higher
interst rate threats and profit taking (or loss-taking) have sharply dropped
many of these stocks lately.

I'll up my position in MAS for reasons stated in prior post.

Stock a little expensive for the returns you get on p/bk. Still, on a p/e,
p/sales, p/bk and maybe (I haven't checked) on a relative dividend yield - the
stock is inexpensive (if one assumes demand for Masco's products will not
diminish).

UCIA.OB - sliding down on no news
OFG - cratering due to collateral damage from other Puerto Rican banks (DRL,
RGF etc.) I expect bad earnings as the yield curve has flattened even more,
however the stock is no close to book. no sceletons found in the basement yet.
Without writeoff's, this stock is undervalued IMO. i am still with my starter
position - don't dare to add yet.

Sold some CLE and NSRGY. Both stocks have done well in the recent selloff.
looking for some solid stocks to add. The energy sector has been selling of
hard recently - the correction was overdue. tomorrow could be a bounce day,
judging from the recent price action and crude spot prices. But LT I am not

An interesting comment. I think that to some extent an increase in interest
rates on the deposit side might at some point impact gold stocks negatively.
Certainly if short term bank deposits offered returns in excess of of true
inflation, I would have to reassess my stance. However we are far from that
point. Also bear in mind that in it is worldwide interest rates that are
relevant and not so much us dollar interest rates. I am in the camp of those
who believe that the price of gold and silver has been manipulated, and that
sooner or later the dam bursts. There have been recently been reports of
extended delivery times for silver . I dare say many central bankers are more
fearful of selling gold now than they have been in the past, as they would like
to keep their jobs. I also see precious metal investing as a China/India play.
As those economies grow demand will increase,
If central banks cut down on their selling, and consumers take physical
delivery, where does the increased supply come from?

UTSI,

Another learning experience?

I wish I had looked at this 4 days later. I picked up 1000 shares after reading
this and another article saying that UTSI was NOT a value trap.

I noticed today in retrospect that there was a lot of short interest in this
stock. That is not a good sign --- shorts are pretty smart, and I don't like to
buy stocks with poor price behavior and large short interest (OCA, SUP
examples), since the shorts must have some reason to stay in their position ---
i.e., seeing something fundamentally wrong with the company that is not in the
current financials.

Also, I have not had good luck with DEEP value stocks with a wide following.
Maybe I should stay away from them, as it seems a lot of people more
knowledgeable than I am have found good reason to bid them down. Better to
stick with my stocks that either no one knows about or are basically
uninteresting.

Anyone else have thoughts?
