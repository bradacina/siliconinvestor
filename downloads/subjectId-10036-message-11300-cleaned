Yes, I saw the article. My reaction was that I was both shocked and scared to
see such an apparently successful investor take such an outlier position
compared to what I understand to be sensible investing (long ONLY 3 companies
(!) with so many undervalued stocks out there now??). And those three stocks -
they made no impression on me, can't even remember 'em. Delphi? Big deal. If
Delphi moves, the other auto parts stocks mentioned here (on this thread) will
also be pulled from their trough too.

The problem with very intelligent people is sometimes they think too much. The
man builds a very articulate case that stocks are overvalued. And maybe he will
indeed call the the market correctly. But if we here (on the Graham value
thread) want to follow Dr Graham's version of intelligent methodology, we will
be diversified and not be less than 25% in stocks (75% in bonds) when the
market is high. And imo it is arguable that with so many sectors in the
doldrums, that "the market" is high.

Paul, and thread, this is a bear market in my opinion. There is no such thing
as a value stock in a bear market. A stock that is at 10 times earnings can
just as easily sell at 8 times or 6 times, even if the fundamentals are fine.
This is because the issue is NOT fundamentals but lack of demand for stocks in
the face of too much supply.

Look at my SEMI. The last 6 quarters' EPS are 6, 13, 22, 30, 71, and $1.10 (the
last on a 72% sales increase). The stock is trading at ..... you guess and then

Jeffrey, that there are decisive drops in so many stocks, this I find to be
disheartening and frightening.

It is painful to see companies report good earnings now, only to see their
stocks drop. (Like SEMI.) And the ones that report lower earnings - they seem
to get killed even if they were killed once earlier if they preannounced.
People believe regardless of what's happening now, good news isn't going to be
in the future. Adding it up.... I call it a bear market too - with no end in
sight.

But that is no reason for value investors to sell out now or remain transfixed
like a deer in headlights. I'm with rjm. About now should be the time to lower
one's cost basis in some of these stocks or pick up new bargains.

One must play the odds (based on our stock market's short history) and screw up
one's courage and buy these value stocks while they are down. And then hold on
as best one can for the upturn that, in the past, has inevitably followed.

From:James Clarke
Allen and Paul lead me to express what I'm thinking about and have been
thinking about for a while. I am fully invested for the first time in a while.
There are just too many stocks out there 30% below my price not to be there.

At the same time, I have to keep reminding myself that the real once in a
generation bear markets, which tend to follow the once in a generation bull
markets, last a long time. Five years, ten years, twenty years even. Company by
company I can buy stocks, but I don't feel like I need to call bottoms now. If
the historical pattern fits, the dominos are finally falling and will continue
to fall for a long time. The economy hasn't broken yet - it will. Everybody is
still convinced stocks are the only way to go - that will change too. We are
still early in the denial stage - everybody who bought Microsoft at 110 still
thinks its going to come back if they are patient (meaning a year). To follow
will be the anger stage, then the "I will never buy a stock again" stage, and
the final stage where we should be at our best. I remember I think it was Seth
Klarman's description of what life was like for a value investor in the worst
(best?) of the 1970s bear market. He described pacing around the Tiffany
building on Fifth Avenue and measuring the acreage, calculating the the entire
franchise at Tiffany was trading for the value of the land under this one owned
building. We're not there yet.

So why am I fully invested? Because we are kind of there with a number of
stocks, and I think those are the ones I own (don't I always?). But more
importantly, because I am 31 years old and have positive savings every month to
accumulate. I think I have saved less than 1/10 as much as I will have
accumulated ten years from now. There could be nothing better for my long-term
net worth than an ten year bear market, even if it takes everything I own now
down 50% more.

This is not a market call - I have learned not to call the short term - the
next move may very well be up. I have learned to go company by company (I
always knew that, but sometimes forgot and Paul Senior would beat the crap out
of me and the first time I got to gloat and the second time I sold weeks before
everything I sold went up 50%), but I can't ignore history. History doesn't
repeat, but it rhymes (-Mark Twain), and if this history rhymes we'll be
watching news reports in 2010 cheering that the Dow broke 10,000 and the Nasdaq
broke 3000. The next ten years are pretty clear to me. That doesn't mean sell -
smart value investors made a lot of money in the 70s, and if they held onto the
positions they accumulated they made a fortune later. That's my thinking now
(but professionally I've still got to think of how to beat some random index of
stocks in the next quarter - you sure you want a job in this industry?)

I've got to agree that we're starting to see some pretty incredible values out
there - as always with the caveat that they could get cheaper. For instance, EK

I know this is a "value" thread, but we're starting to see some values in the
not so usual places - possibly MSFT, INTC, MOT, ad nauseum. Not in the
traditional sense, but in a relative sense.
The poorer the market performs prior to election day, IMHO, the more likely it
will be that "W" wins IMHO. I don't know what that portends for the markets.
I do think that Mr. G's next move should be to ease - we're getting too many
poor reports from major companies, and the wealth effect created from stock
appreciation has almost completely dried up. Higher prices at the pump, lower
prices in the stock markets = less spending and a softer economy. IMHO Mr. G

I would be especially wary of "relative" value. That only makes sense if the
thing you are comparing it to has a rational foundation. It would seem to me
that if we are in fact in the "recovery stage" of an irrationally overpriced
market, then we might not yet be able to trust stock prices relative to their
past prices or relative to the current stock prices of their peers or
comparables.

"Relative" investing may have worked very well in the bull market we've had,
but I would suggest that beginning to think "absolutely" here would perhaps
lend a bit of safety to one's analysis.

After all, isn't "rational absolute" analysis what Graham (tangible balance
sheet liquidation value vs. market cap) and Buffett (long term actual operating
free cash flows vs market cap) are all about?

Well put Daniel. Those of us who have the 1973-74 bear market to write home

Unfortunately, that has sometimes led to problems in the tech area, where often
the best looking values are older companies with decent balance sheets but with
second-rate market/product positions - which is hard to tell if you do not have
a tech background.

Re: Sturm Ruger (RGR)

Negatives:

1) Gun sales in a lull relative to the end of 1999 because a lot of people
bought in Q4 1999 expecting stiffer background checks, etc. starting Jan. 1,
2000.
2) Investor concern about lawsuits. RGR should be one of gun manufacturers
least affected by lawsuits. In fact, in the long run, they should gain some
market share relative to manufacturers who have relied on "more aggressive
marketing policies" in the past.
3) The other-than-firearms casting business is profitable enough, but growth is
way down relative to some investors expectations a couple of years ago
regarding golf club demand.
4) Last quarter's earnings were right at the $.20 dividend per share and the 6-
to 12-month trend is down, although there's still good cash flow covering the
dividend.
5) I don't expect much growth for the next 3-5 years.

Positives:

1) I expect firearm and casting sales to bottom before the dividend is in
jeopardy of being cut.
2) Management is very conservative and are very prudent allocators of capital.
The last thing I expect them to do is blow excess cash flow on a bad
acquisition. I expect that if the cash flow improves significantly, they'll
either make a very good investment or increase the dividend.
3) Bill Ruane, of Sequoia Fund fame and friend of Warren (Buffett) holds RGR in
Sequoia fund, is on the Board of Directors of RGR, and bought a small amount
last fall at $9.00/share.

Disclosure: I own shares of RGR in my personal account. I consider the dividend
safe, and I think there's a strong market bias right now for growth and against
income, which has, along with the above negatives, contributed to the price
decline.

Re: Cedar Fair (FUN)

Two things that weren't mentioned about FUN:

1) A couple of years ago, their tax status as a partnership was changed and
they went from paying zero corporate income tax to (I think) 15%. This is
better than the standard 38%, but it means that that money is not available for
investment in growth. They have been getting a pretty consistent return on
reinvested retained earnings both before and after the tax law change. But
there are now fewer dollars of retained earnings to invest and their growth
rate has slowed accordingly. Roughly, you can assume they'll grow about as fast
as their percentage retained earnings (after dividend payments). This growth
rate used to be about 12-14% and now it is more like 8-9%. 8% growth plus the 8
1/2% dividend still gives you about a 15-17% expected total return, but not the
22-25% total return they had been achieving.
2) The shareholders were recently asked to approve a new compensation plan for
the general partners/managers. The new plan is much better for the managers.
They sold it to the shareholders based on the theory that all the stock options
they'll be getting in lieu of cash, performance-based compensation will better
align their interests with the limited partners (we've heard that one before).
They also took a one-time cash bonus to compensate them for the "lower present
value" of the new plan. I totally disagree that the new plan has lower present
value to them. There's some chance they'll make less, but only if future share
prices remain unreasonably low for a long time. I don't consider the dollar
value of the change in the compensation plan to be highly significant for the
limited partners, but I don't like the trend. I voted against it, but the
limited partners approved it. (For those not familiar with FUN, it is a
partnership--the shares traded on the exchange are limited partnership shares
not common stock shares.)

I still expect about a 15% annual return on FUN bought at prices between $17
and $19.

Disclosure: I own shares of FUN in my personal account.

Yes, now may be a time to diversify away from "pure value". OTOH, just because
growth stocks have come down in price and are now a relative value-- that can
be a dangerous way to invest. (as pointed out by D. Chisholm, and as you know
too.) MSFT might work out very well though - it may have been washed down as
far as it's going to drop with today's market fall, and may now be a decent bet
to rebound when the market recovers and individuals and institutions look to
deploy funds.

For me, I've added today to these downtrodden-that-might-recover (I hope):
American Airlines (AMR), which is the number 2 carrier, Cemex (CX) which will
be the number 3 cement producer, and Dollar Thrifty Auto (DTG), which is the
number 3 or 4 auto rental co. I tossed in the towel and will take my losses in
AKLM, AVS, ESCC, IGL, VII. (And, as with a prior post - these clunkers too are

Apparently SKO's debt is something to think/worry about:

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Fitch Thursday has changed its rating outlook on Shopko
(SKO, news, msgs) to negative from stable. The BBB rating on Shopko's $475
million bank credit agreement and $340 million senior notes is affirmed.

Fitch said, "The company recently announced that earnings for the third quarter
and full year would be below expectations as a result of weakening conditions
of the retail environment. As part of the company's announcement, SKO plans to
reduce capital spending by approximately $80-$100 million next year, reduce
overall costs by $15-$20 million and continue to aggressively manage
inventories. Cost savings will likely be used to retire long-term debt.

"While these cost saving measures are positive, there is still uncertainty
surrounding the retail environment. Fitch's change in outlook reflects SKO's
competitive environment, deteriorating credit fundamentals and higher debt
balances. Reduced leverage should improve interest expense, however, increasing
competition and the potential for price reductions could affect operating
margins. Finally, like most retailers, Shopko generates a substantial portion
of its operating income during the fourth quarter, thus the ability to maintain
margins over the next three months will be a key indicator to overall EBITDA,"
the rating agency said.

Quote for referenced ticker symbols: SKO

&#169; 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday confirmed the Baa3
senior unsecured rating of Shopko Stores, Inc. (SKO, news, msgs), but changed
the rating outlook from positive to stable. The revision in the outlook is
based on an expectation of continued sluggish comparable store sales growth and
the likelihood that Shopko's announced reduction in new store construction will
limit overall sales growth, Moody's said. The rating confirmation reflects the
company's strong management and its stated intention to use free cash flow for
the purposes of further debt reductions, it added.

Ratings confirmed: Senior unsecured debt at Baa3; $200 million revolving credit
agreement, due 2002, and $175 million revolving credit agreement, due 2001, at
Baa3; senior unsecured shelf registration at (P, news, msgs) Baa3.

Hi Wallace,

My personal opinion is that if there's a rational argument to be made for an
investment, it belongs here (or at least a post or two, before migrating off to
a more specific thread if applicable). Obviously you and everyone else here
realizes that just because XYZ.com is off 60% from its highs does not mean that
it is necessarily cheap.

Now MSFT, they sure are interesting to think of in the sense of a value
investment. It's not as if any of the following is likely to be news to anyone
here, but here are my thoughts on it, and why I have been unable so far to "get
it" as a rational investment:

They are (excluding stock option compensation) remarkably conservative in their
accounting (deferring revs and earnings over a product cycle). I think that
their revenues and earnings can be trusted more than most companies out there.

They are a very large company now. The law of large numbers makes their future
growth more difficult than their past growth (of course there is also the
antitrust suit).

Their great success was coincident with their stock price soaring over an
extended period of time, combined with large stock options grants to their
employees. Not only has the cost of compensating these very hard working
employees extraordinarily well not been incorporated into the company's
historical statement of earnings, it is also hard to predict how the company
might perform operationally if their stock price does not continue its
exceptional historical growth. If they can't continue to overpay their
employees (at little apparent cost), how will their productivity be affected?
One could blithely say that this is a coupled system with a bit of positive
feedback, and therefore doomed to blow up -- however the correct answer is
likely to be subtler than this...

They are an "intangible intellectual property" story writ large -- while they
are not a (financial) capital intensive industry (and all the hidden long term
benefits that that implies - inflation resistance, the possibility of
sustainable long term cash flows being greater than accounting earnings, etc),
they are very "intellectual capital" intensive. This is a (relatively) new
thing, so we analysts might be missing key parts of the long term picture of
how the true economy of such a company operates (e.g. is there an equivalent
"intellectual capital depreciation" allowance or expense? Perhaps this is what
some of the hidden cost of generous stock option wealth transfer to employees
actually is?)

Back of the envelope, I can't see MSFT being cheap. $270B (indicated,
non-diluted) mkt. cap, $23B in sales, $10-ishB in (earnings / cash flow /
EBITDA). With margins like this, margin expansion won't give you much. As far
as sales growth goes, you just can't grow $23B in sales at a 30% annual rate
for very long before the predictions start to look pretty silly. Buying back
$12 worth of stock in order to "purchase" $1 of your own sales (and fifty-ish
cents of your own earnings) for your remaining stockholders doesn't seem to
make much sense either (or if it does, I'm missing the key insight).

What I just can't see is that at a mkt. cap of $270B (that's 27X cash
flow/earnings/EBITDA), how can this investment ever earn itself out?

downgrade from Pru (per Yahoo board, so caveat emptor), even though the company
beat estimates. Top line was weaker than anticipated, a great deal due to the
Euro, and the guidance on rev. growth was taken down from 20% to 15-16%. Still,
this company is growing at a most significant clip, has a phenomenal PEG ratio,
low PE and pristine balance sheet. So, Pru downgrades...

Correction on RGR:

Richard Cunniff, Bill Ruane's partner at Sequoia is on the Sturm Ruger board.

According to Yahoo "insider trades", Cunniff bought 30,000 shares at
$9.00/share on 29 Oct 1999. At that time he reported owning/controlling a total
of 40,500 shares.

According to Yahoo "institutional holders", Ruane, Cunniff & Co. own 310,463
shares of RGR, which at $7.25/share is about $2.25 million. This is about .07%
(note this is .07%, not 7%) of their $3.24 billion Sequoia Fund.

Grommit, I've added more to my WNC position today.

I see in the latest edition of "Worth", p.97, that value investor Steven Romick
of FPA Crescent, has picked WNC as a "stock to avoid". The article indicates
that Mr. Romick believes WNC (now about 8), has a "fair value" of $5 and that
WNC shows that it is making money because it is not writing down enough excess
inventory and has let debt "soar from $145 million to 321 million." Really
don't like seeing that analysis - it scares me because he does do excellent
work and has a very respectable record both for his stock picks and, according
to "Worth" for his previous pans in their magazine. He's chosen IBM in the same
article at $122 and his "fair value" number for it is $75. And we have
experienced a tremendous cleaving of IBM price recently.

I hate going up against guys like Romick. Nevertheless, I am betting that in 18
months, WNC will be at a higher price than it is now now. In addition to their
"high tech" trailer business, they have Fruehauf, so sales and service of this
brand are important contributors. (I point this out to thread readers who are
are unfamiliar with Wabash.) There's some insider buying, debt/eq. is .71 ,
p/sales are low, stock price is near an 8 year low, price less than half of
book value.

WNC stock could surely go lower. But I say we're right that the stock will
recover from its current and depressed level.

Re: that old saw, the difference is that I like to look at others' opinions!

Can EK be considered to be something other than an old line industrial concern,
which will (relatively) soon fade away (here we can see the likely reason:
digital photography), trying without success to make the transition to the
successor technology?

If this is the case, then I'd be tempted to value it on the present value of
its free cash flow for the next ten years, minus some discount (based on the
assumption that management will fritter away cash flow that ought to have been
"free", on an unsuccessful succession plan). In others words, not very much.

Am I being too pessimistic here? The thing that concerns me is that they might
have too much bureaucratic bulk and inertia to succeed beyond the digital
photography transition, and that their proud heritage will likely prove a
liability w.r.t. shareholder value (in that they won't admit that they should
gracefully wind up the company and get the most possible cash back to
shareholders).

There you have it, my opinion, if you care to look at it ;-)

Re: SPOR

My time horizon is very long and I will probably buy at two. But first I have
to be convinced that management is honest.

The cash on hand and receivables should support the stock somewhat. And the
business entity looked viable enough to justify making the purchase -- so long
as the reported figures were not fraudulent . . .

The company press release was sure confusing. It sounds like income was
overstated in one year and understated in the next because of improper
accounting of the inventory, and that there was no real economic change. I hope
that's all there is to it. I always doubted the inventory anyway, although from
the sounds of the press release it doesn't sound like the assets are misstated,
just timing of expenses.

I am still hopeful and will likely continue to buy.

For those who might be looking for a growth value stock, I propose TXT as one
you won't want to purchase (especially if you can't handle falling knives -g-).

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=txt&B1=Enter

From their web site (and with my update notes):

"Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) is one of America's largest and best-performing
multi-industry companies. Headquartered in Providence, R.I., Textron ranks
154th on the FORTUNE 500 list of largest U.S. companies, and is among FORTUNE's
"Global Most Admired Companies". (Update: and TXT has has been selected by
IndustryWeek Magazine as one of the ``World's 100 Best-Managed Companies'' in
the manufacturing industry)

Textron has achieved an average annual earnings-per-share growth rate of 23
percent since 1992, and has reported 10 consecutive years of quarter-over
-year-ago-quarter earnings growth. (Update: now with recent quarter it's 44
consecutive quarters, or eleven years.) Familiar brand names in our family of
companies include: Bell Helicopter, Cessna Aircraft, E-Z-GO and Ransomes.

Since the founding of our company in 1923, Textron has grown to become a
successful, tightly-managed multi-industry company with revenues of $11.6
billion (update $12.4B); 68,000 employees; and a diverse, global customer base.
Today, we continue to expand our leadership positions in four core business
segments..."

----
Stock is at a four year low. Div yield is 3%, dividend amt. has almost doubled
over past 6 years, shares outstanding are being reduced, ltd is being reduced,
analysts expect continued profit improvement next year, pe is at a multi-year
low.

I started to nibble today. TXT seems like it might work out profitably if given
enough time. Not quite a standard value play, and perhaps too much conglomerate
to be considered a growth stock. Still, it's come down enough in price to be
appropriate for review by value seekers. Also it is large, strong, and
consistent enough to be a suitable candidate at current price for inclusion in
a patient Mom portfolio.

all imo, of course.

Help !
The chairman & 60% owner of DIYH recently filed a 13g. It appears as if he
moved his ownership from one trust to another.
Can one read something into that ?

"This Statement is being filed by the following persons:

(1) Fred A. Erb, or his successor, as trustee u/t/a dated 10/30/80, as amended
and restated, Fred A. Erb, Grantor (the "Trust") ; and

(2) Fred A. Erb.

The shares of Common Stock were originally owned by 375 South Eaton Limited
Partnership. Mr. Erb is the sole general partner of 375 South Eaton Limited
Partnership. The shares were then transferred to the Trust. Mr. Erb is the
grantor of the Trust. As a result, pursuant to Rule 13d-3(a), Mr. Erb is deemed
to be the beneficial owner of the Common Stock owned by the Trust for the
purposes of this Statement. Nevertheless, Mr. Erb specifically disclaims
beneficial ownership of the Common Stock owned by the Trust except to the
extent of his pecuniary interest in such Common Stock.

(b) The 4,410,000 shares of Common Stock owned by the Trust represent
approximately sixty and six tenths percent (60.6%) of the issued and
outstanding Common Stock.

As the Trustee of the Trust, Mr. Erb has the power to vote or direct the vote
of 4,410,000 shares of Common Stock."

It appears the prior trust was nearly 20 years old.

Is this just normal tax planning or setting the stage for some kind of
extraordinary transaction ?

Buys & Sells over last quarter
I lurk on this thread... this is an attempt to contribute.

Over the last quarter, I've invested mostly in three themes: retail, real
estate, and consumer stocks. My dispositions are mixed.

RETAIL

BKS - Barnes and Noble. I bought around $16. The forward PE is under 10.

KM - Kmart. My average cost is about $5.50. The forward PE is under 6, the PSR
is around .08, and I spend more money at Kmart than I do at Walmart because its
stores are more accessible.

OMX - Officemax. My average cost is around $6. At $2.38, the PSR is about .05.
I believe Grupo Carso owns a large stake at higher prices. This Mexican company
bought me out of Compusa at $10.10 where I had a cost of $7.

PBY - Pep Boys. My average cost is around $6. At 4 3/8, the PSR is around .10.
The do-it-yourself-auto-parts business has not impressed lately. However, I
like its national auto service business. Earlier this year the company bought
stock in a dutch auction in the teens.

SKO - Shopko. My cost is $7. At $6, its PSR is .05, P/B is .25. It's hard to
get enthused about the business, but the numbers are compelling. Also, I
believe its debt is still rated investment grade.

YUM - Tricon Global. My cost is $24. I bought it because I thought is was
valued at 4 on a P/CF basis.

CONSUMER

DL - Dial. My cost is $11. $1 billion of market cap plus $500 million LTD for
the maker of Dial, Purex, Renuzit.

PYX - Playtex. My cost is $10. $600 million of market cap and $900 million LTD
for the maker of feminine care products and infant care products. Brands
include PLAYTEX, BANANA BOAT sun care, PLAYTEX, WOOLITE, CHUBS, WET ONES,
BINKY, MR. BUBBLE, BINACA, OGILVIE, DENTAX oral care products, DIAPER GENIE
diaper pails, BABY MAGIC lotion.

SRV - Service Corp. I started buying this at $16. It's at $2 and change. I've
managed to trade this so that I am even on it. This is the largest deathcare
company I know of … it has $3.3 billion in LTD, $3 billion in sales, market cap
of $600 million. The forward PE is around 4 but there is a risk of bankruptcy
so take it with a grain of salt.

SVM - Servicemaster. The forward PE is around 12. The stock price is around a
five year low. Yields around 4.4 percent.

REAL ESTATE

I generally buy and hold the large REITs. I don't have any particular strategy
(so no commentary) outside of diversifying and trying to buy stock at a
discount to previous prices. I've added modest amounts of REITs this year. This
year has been good... the previous two years were educational. Over the past
year, I made investment in the homebuilders on a price-to-book basis which
worked out well... namely RYL - Ryland, PHM - Pulte, and ENGL - Engle Homes.
I'm still holding with approximately 100% absolute gains.

OTHER
ALLR - Allaire Corp. I bought around $7. This company "...develops, markets and
supports Internet software products for companies building their businesses on
the Web....". Allaire products are ColdFusion, JRun, Homesite and Spectra. Look
here for more information: http://biz.yahoo.com/e/l/a/allr.html . The things
that interest me about this company are: (a) 2x trailing Sales, (b) just
reported YOY sales gain of 100%, (c) cash per share around $4.60 with de
minimus LTD, (d) large short position, and (e) the market cap is under $200
million. I've spent about 1 hour researching this so caveat emptor. Obviously,
the market thinks their product future is iffy.

CCK - Crown, Cork and Seal. My average cost is around $19 so I've lost a lot of
principal. The forward PE is under 10 with a PSR of about .15, but there's a
large amount of debt and the company has been sputtering the last couple
quarters.

CCR - Countrywide Credit. I added at $31 to a lower-cost position. The forward
PE is around 10. P/B is around 1.3. My investment thesis is the market is not
properly valuing the company's core origination competency, nor the recurring
nature of the mortgage servicing business, nor the opportunities stemming from
a large number of customer relationships.

PX - Praxair. I added around $31 to a higher cost position. The forward PE is
around 10. My investment thesis here is that the chemical companies will earn
high rates of return where distribution capabilities can't be separated from
production and where a global footprint is required.

TSG - Sabre Group. I bought around $24. My investment thesis is that around
1.5X sales and a forward PE of around 13 is that the market doesn't properly
value the complexity "moat" that the travel reservation business represents.

WCOM - Worldcom. I bought at $25. I have almost no investment in tech so this
is an effort to gain some. I'm buying on faith because I don't understand the
business. The forward PE is around 10 and I'm hoping that the company has some
durable position in its internet business to offset the economics of the
long-distance business.

Dispositions:
AVP - Avon Products. Sold at $44 bought at $26 with a holding period of 9
months making 98% annualized.

BPP - Burnham Pacific. I made a little money on this only because I offset
large long-term losses with short-term trading.

Insurance ... sold XL at $65, bought at $54, held 12 months, about 18%
annualized ... sold ACL at $33, bought at $26, held 18 months, about 16%
annualized. I'm still holding UNUM, Allstate, MONY, and Safeco with annualized
gains around 40%.

PETC - Petco. Bought out at $22 with a two year holding period. Average cost
was $8 making about 60% annualized.

RHI - Robert Half. Sold at $34, cost was around $13 with a 14 month holding
period making about 125% annualized.

THC - Tenet Healthcare. Sold at $27, cost was around $19 with a 17 month
holding period making for 28% annualized.

USG - tax loss selling of $45 stock at $17 with a two year holding period
making for an absolute loss of 60%. I'm still long and looking to go longer.
I've been hurt badly by the asbestos litigation on ACK, OI, and USG but am
still long.

XRAY - Dentsply Int'l. Sold at $34, bought at $21, held 22 months making 29%
annualized.

The market humbles me with 50% haircuts on a regular basis so please rely on
your own research.

I also own SKO, as does Paul Senior. The debt is Baaa (he said, sheepishly

isn't much) has it as a 15% grower if I recall rightly. Yet the stock doesn't
seem to want to stop going down. Is there much/any chance that it'll go
bankrupt? If it doesn't, I can't see it not getting a higher p/e ratio, as it's
p/e is less than 2 now, I think. I think their CEO was something like "Discount

why the price continues to fall and what it'll take to get it to reverse

Just looking at the performance of PX - lousy sales growth recently, but very
good ROE (it was better in prior years), good earnings and dividend growth,
relatively low p/book and p/e -- it is, imo, selling now at a very attractive
price. I'll look further into it.

Brendan...USG: I got back in during recent asbestos debacle with current
average cost around 18.50 after having bought and sold profitably at far higher
levels. Catalyst for improvement might be an estimate for asbestos risk coming
in q4 or more likely q1. They stressed on CC that this risk is far different
and more managable than OWC's due to the nature of product sold. I have,
nevertheless, a low confidence level about this position because of asbestos
uncertainty. [As an aside, I recently read a piece that distinguished risk from
uncertainty by defining risk as a range of outcomes where probabilities could
be reasonably assigned, uncertainty is more like not knowing what the hell

MSFT<<Everyone sounds thrilled with earnings, but it looked like operating
earnings were flat and gains came from non-operating>> Barrons' Andrew Bary is
saying similar and then some about MSFT earnings quality. I recall a prior CFO
responding to question about when MSFT might be a sell by saying, essentially,
when they moved from conservative to aggressive accounting. Relatively
speaking, I believe that move is underway. That's why I treated this as a
trade.
On a similar note, Abraham Briloff piece on Cisco in Barrons is a 'don't miss'
if you're interested in accounting analysis. Related to that, if Cisco takes a
share price hit, it will also show up as reduced cash flow because the
difference between share price and employee stock option strike price is a tax
deductible, non-cash expense that kicks out a cash tax benefit equal to the
expense x marginal tax rate. Lower share price means lower expense and lower
tax benefit. I think about 44% of Cisco's FY 2000 Cash flow can be traced to
this, so it might be material to those that use cash flow based valuation
approaches.

Wallace,

T swap to WCOM. It's a question impossible to answer.
T has wireless assets, cable assets and overall asset
infra-structure that may be very valuable.
However, some of the infrastructure is old and needs
to be constantly renovated.
It is not clear where T will make money
(except of dying long-distance cash cow) and where
will it grow (business services? wireless?).
Four way division is not very exciting,
because each of divisions will have its own
share of problems. Which one
of them would you like to hold? I am also uncertain
whether separating a wireline and wireless assets is
smart.

WCOM has more modern infrastructure, profitable Internet
backbone business. However, they lack wireless assets and
may have to buy them or spin-off wireline long distance.
Both are tricky propositions.

You may want to reread Mike Burry's writeups on both
companies. His insight is pretty much on the point.

In the end, it's a gamble. Either of them may be two-three
bagger in a year, and both could hover around current
lows. Toss a coin.

I don't know if swapping out of T is a wise move or not.

I'm holding on to my T (at a loss now) because they may -or will- announce a
restructuring and the stock has begun to react to that (or maybe the stock has
now finished reacting to it ??). Compared to some of my other losers, T has
tremendous visibility and interest (from media and investors). It's possible
that many are selling for the reason as you are now, but it's also possible
that the stock could rise quickly from its current level. So I'm holding.

I'm playing WCOM by ICIX. --- would rather make the speculative bet that the
merger will go through than purchase WCOM outright. It's a bet.

IMHO and not owning either of these companies, I think it is a wise move. I am
far from being a technical expert but the scuttlebutt that I read is that T has
a somewhat dated infrastructure. I have not been impressed with the way
management seems to make a habit of overpaying for strategic assets and Long
distance service, which t has a major stake in is just going to have decining
margins for the forseeable future. Its a new ball game and I am not convinced T
is going to be a future player. WCOM has state of the art systems. So if it
were me I would switch and feel I was moving my assets to a more solid base. Of
course free advice is usually worth exactly what you pay for it.
OT I have today started to repurchase shares in an old favorite of mine ICGE.
The stock has now fallen about 90% or so from its high and has now bounced off
the $10 levels. We all know the internet and B2B is dead. so I see this is as a
very nice contrarian play just in case all the pundits are wrong.
This is bar none the biggest player in the space and I see it as a long term
survivor. No doubt many of its investments will prove to be worthless but
business model makes sense.
Focus on developing the B2B space provide consulting services to your
subsidiaries and participate in the inevitable boom. This stock IPoed at $12 in
the Summer of 99 and split 2 for one after soaring to over $300. Now it can be
had for something less than that.

BFRE had a wonderful one day bounce the day I afte I added to my position and

SOFN sells for less than its cash value.
ALSC is selling for about 1/2 of what its worth.
LDP is lightly traded but very exciting. a long term buy.
I guess it is under the radar screen because the principal owns a vast number
of shares and the ipo market is presumed dead. Meanwhile the portfolio of
marketable securities and their private investments at cost are less than the
market cap. so its insuranve and asset management business are free. Its
private portfolio includes investments in 4-5 optical /networking companies. I
am counting on 2-3 more home runs of the scope of NUFO.
SFE is slowly rebounding along with ICGE which it continues to have a major
stake in.

Yeah, I watch TER and GEN as I am somewhat familiar with both companies- having
used their products in a previous life. Sorry I didn't buy TER when it dropped
recently -- now I'm not so sure I want to step up. OTOH, I picked up GEN when
it was lower, so I've got a position in the industry. TER's a major force -
stock will likely recover further from here - my guess, if I had to guess.

Wallace,

TER - VERY different from SYMC. I don't have it, but
I have KLIC+ASYT. There are couple of truths in
semi-equip investing:

1. All semi-equips move in unison - so you may
as well buy best: AMAT, TER, ASYT, KLIC, KLAC.
Or the cheapest: COHU, EGLS, etc.
2. They all follow the semi cycle but more violently.
3. Nobody knows when the cycle will end and when it
will begin.
4. Buy very low, sell high. If you think you are buying
low, wait for "ridiculously low". Don't buy high,
don't sell on 20-50% bounces.

This year is an anomaly because the business is still
fine, but the stocks dropped to cycle lows.
Either the business bottom will drop out, or the
stocks will recover. Reasonable thing would be to
wait until the next real cycle bottom. Risky thing
is to buy now.

Jurgis - No, SYMC is not cyclical

Re: T
I don't think either stock is going to recover enough to warrant a purchase of

One thing I don't understand about T is that no matter how many ways you slice

from T's board/mgmt has been to spin off/tracking stk/split up the company.
Damn it don't you see that by giving shareholders 4 different holdings, the
market will adjust the garbage entities (i.e. long-distance) accordingly
(down).

I just don't understand why they don't use all that brain power to IMPROVE

this. Using the pie as analogy, if T were a combination blueberry, cherry,
strawberry, and lemon pie. Those that favored any one of those flavors and
disfavored the others would pay a suboptimal price for the less favored
flavors. But when separated, those preferring each individual flavor would bid
up the price of that flavor without reducing thier bids for what they didn't
want. In addition, some spun off portions may outperform when unencumbered by
corporate bureacracy [Lexmark, post IBM, is poster child for this].
The above is about general advantages of split ups, and really not specific to

Bob, and others interested in T. Now that the BOD of T has supported the
breakup, what are the likely relative values of the four parts?
AWE has current market cap of 50+ billion, but since the float is only 1/7 of
the total shares, does this mean that T has the remaining shares and if so what
does a breakup do to AWE. Then the cable assets cost T about 100 billion and
those assets may be worth only half of the exorbitant price paid. Let's say
that consumer and business long distance are worth 50 each(no way Jose). The
sum of four parts is 200 billion or twice the current T capitalization. I do
not have any factual info for any of these numbers except for cap of AWE, but
my point is that something is drastically wrong here. I have hated T for a year
now but am intrigued as to how the pies will viewed and moreover am trying to
conceptualize how T and AWE will react relative to each other when the breakup
occurs. If you go to Yahoo and do a comparison chart you will see a very tight
correlation in price action and yet T is much more valuable on a relative
basis.
My bottom line is how could one play this as an arbitrage situation.

I hope I'm not the only one jumping for joy reading Barrons this weekend.
They've got a full page article on SYM that reminds me of the one that doubled
Tejon Ranch three years ago. Remember the discussion we had on SYM several
months ago. It was a buy under 4 with a value of at least 7. Apparently I was
being a little conservative. While I valued the buildings, I just realized that
I had assigned no value to the land. They own the land under their store in
lower Manhattan! Management has just stated clearly and publicly in Barrons
that THEIR OWNED LAND ALONE is worth $10 a share. Then you've got a net-net
valuation and the buildings on top of that. No debt. I think Monday's going to

and somebody's mention here of Meditrust (debt). Federated Department Stores
was discussed here too in referencing possible Blair problems after FD's
Fingerhut troubles were announced, if I recall correctly. Apparently, Mutual
Fund bought FD at its lows. FD is mentioned in another Barron's article today
as possibly still undervalued.

I also liked the Barron's dividend section article about S&P's list of long

Lawndale increases filing position in Oroamerica (O-OROA)

Trades around 50% of book and 6x earnings, actively buying back stock and
focussed on growing via new products and expanded distribution channel.

In a filing with the SEC on October 30, 2000, San Francisco, CA-based Lawndale
Capital Mgmt filed a 13-D/A increasing its position to 7.1% of the shares of
Oroamerica (O-OROA), a manufacturer and distributor of karat gold jewelry the
United States.

summarizing ITEM 4 of our filing:

Lawndale acquired the Stock solely for investment purposes because it believes
that the value of the Stock in the public market, currently trading far below
Oroamerica's book value, is undervalued by not adequately reflecting the value
of Oroamerica's underlying businesses and assets and the potential value from
its new product and distribution channel initiatives.

Lawndale has been and may continue to be in contact with Oroamerica's
management, members of Oroamerica's Board of Directors, other significant
shareholders, and others regarding alternatives Oroamerica can employ to
maximize shareholder value, including, but not limited to, its recently
expanded stock buyback program.

One of Oroamerica's new product initiatives can be found at

going to nail intermediate bottom. The ratios are way into the the deep value
range, but financial flexibility is tight and nearterm SSS won't be pretty
because there hasn't been a winter yet...and winter drives a lot of the
business in Shopko's neck of the woods. But winter defferred is not winter

Although they have been profitable every year, their ROE has been pitiful.

From their website: "SOLA Optical USA is the largest manufacturer of spectacle

Lot of negatives. Earnings have disappeared as sales in N. America (prime

outstanding. (Inventories and A/R also have increased somewhat.)

Offsetting these negatives are a stock at its lows; the psr figure is very low

There's some insider buying. In the past the company seems to have been
technically innovative. If they can focus on the business aspects a little

to consolidate the industry. Many of these tiny internet advertising firms were
able to go public at the tail end of the "mania." I noticed that DCLK ALREADY
owns a chunk of VCLK, and intended to buy more. I just figured they'd probably
want the entire thing now, and since it IS selling below the cash on the books,
it might be an interesting speculation. VCLK might figure that now is a great

MOVI & NICH both seem to be darn compelling values.

MOVI has a lot of intangibles on their books. Take it away and Take we have a
$4.30 book value with $1.50 per share in earnings for the year. Even with it,
they will earn 85 cents.
This HAS to be worth more than $3.50.

NICH earned $1.77 this year, up from 52 cents the prior year. Stock trades at
$6 for a pe of about 3.4.
This one has been paying out special dividends every quarter, about $1.90 over
the last 5 quarters. The reason for this is the president took out a loan to
buy other directors stock and this way he can pay it off. Also, they never give
any kind of forward looking talk. Blandest PRs I have ever read.
Clearly the market doesnt expect the earnings to continue but we have a solid
book value most of it in current assets as downside support.
I bought this one as a net-net and now its an earnings play.
