re: NSI. Here's a pretty decent value stock, imo.

National Service Industries (NSI) is a conglomerate composed of Lithonia
Lighting, National Linen Service, Atlantic Envelope, and other mundane stuff.
(Apologies if I've unintentionally insulted anyone - but this is SI and lights
and envelopes and linens don't get much respect - unless you're looking for
one)

Company sells for .5 times revenue, about 2 times book value and maybe 10 times
recent earnings. The dividend yield is 4.3%. Debt/equity has jumped up from .13
to .7. Management originally said they would use the debt for acquisitions and
stock repurchases (and they did buy 1.2M shares). They suspended the
repurchases until d/e is below about .6. Over the past four years, eps has
grown at a 12% rate. Four analysts follow the stock: One strong buy, one
moderate, two holds.

Okay, here's a strong reason to consider this stock: from their 12/98 press
release: "NSI has reported increased income and earnings per share in 35 of the
last 37 years. Dividends have been increased for 36 consecutive years and paid
for the past 62 years without a decrease." 1999 looks to me to be another
record year.

I don't know how they do it. Envelopes are profitable??? People are talking
about the internet doing away with the post office.

Still... I have been waiting to add to my position if stock hit new lows. Today
I added.

fwiw,

Paul,

"If you are in this stock, I will certainly go back and think about it still
and again" You forget - I gave you the info that prompted you to sell METH at
18 - now 27.

I suppose I did prompt a LOL. I had no intentions of getting out of the market.
I started taking profits and building cash for a December tax selloff (has
worked well last couple of years), then when I decided it was time to start
looking, I couldn't find anything I liked. Clive mentioned WAK so I took a
quick look, became a harder look, and I'm still looking.

Don't need to explain anything. Your site shows cash of $64.6M = $4.28 /share.
Shows revenue and earnings growth - exclude the one time adjustment - I think
this may have prompted the selloff.

WHC has grown revs from $105.5M in '94 to $404.4 in '99 with earnings from
$2.2M to $20.5M. WAK owns at least 52.1% of WHC.

Analysts - WAK-4 w/SB, 7 on WHC 4/SB, 3/B.

SEC filing - cash flow in 1998 shows $4.4M paid out in dividends - 30 cents?

WHC is 'corrections'. WAK is 'security' - everything from airports to personal.
They are also adding related businesses like food service for prisons and
expanding the security international (As I get it, they are providing 55% of
the privatized security outside of the US) I think this will be a fast growing
sector. IMO Low margin is due to labor intensive business and costs related to
growth.

Appreciate anything you find as I'm looking to add.

Hope it's right, moving kinda fast on it.

There often exist many inside deals using a strange tangle of corporate

You put 1/3 of somebody's portfolio and 80% of another's
into a Chinese micocap. A company that per Yahoo is an injection molding shop
that does about 50M-60M in sales and has a four year public history. A company
with a lot of cash on its books. You say from your knowledge of the management
and business there's no or minimal risk.

I'm saying, I don't care if you speak fluent Chinese and have a desk in the
CEO's office. Or that there's a dollar in the till for each dollar of sales. In
making this one investment such a substantial portion of somebody's stock
portfolio the portfolio itself was put at risk. Maybe it was necessary to meet
the requirement/goal of the portfolio. Maybe not. But there was risk. Sorry you

system that imposes real consequences on violators. That said, it's important
to recognize that a company is going to work within that system, and sometimes
a bit beyond to maximize share price and lower cost of capital. And no matter
how good the system, there will be outright frauds like Cendant's CUC division

small position in Federal Mogul. Selling at a pe under 5 (based on this year's
est. earnings), with a psr of .28. That's a low psr for the company. FMO has
powered increased sales by acquisitions (the industry is consolidating), which
means debt has soared. Perhaps a concern to investors. The stock, at little
under 20 today, goes for about 70% of book value. But book would include lots

That may be what Abby said but I don;t agree. The reason that US stocks are
popular is because the risk of expropriation is nil, there is liberal financing
for stock speculation and a well organized structure in place to encourage
investment in US securities. Furthermore many large caps in other countries
have either minority or majority government controlled stakes, which may
prevent them from acting in the best interests of their shareholders. Yes
problems sometimes can be ferreted out from intense scrutiny of the financials
and supplementary information but this is beyond the grasp of all but the most
sophisticated and resourceful investors. That is far from being a fair game in

Paul, you were hounding Mike about shady financial disclosure, and then you
invest in Federal Mogul because its P/E is 5x. I have looked at Federal Mogul
pretty carefully myself, and all I could really conclude about their earning
power is that I have no idea what it is. This is a company that did something
like 15 acquisitions in 2 years using an overvalued stock as currency, and now
has all the stuff they bought, a fallen stock, and a mountain of debt. Does
that .28 price/sales ratio include the debt? I don't think it does. The book
value is goodwill. If the auto cycle turns, is there any margin of safety like
you might have with a Dana? How do you have any confidence in the earnings
power of this company? I'm not just beating on you - I'd be interested in
knowing if I missed something in my own analysis.

From:Paul Senior

Hounding? I certainly didn't intend to. Sorry if the discussion read that way
to you.

You missed nothing in your analysis.

I certainly can't determine the "earning power" of this company. And you stated
the negatives too. You could've also added their potential asbestos liability.

They are selling "non-core" assets of $700M in rev. There is some insider
buying starting to show up. 7 of 10 analysts rate it a buy.
Their consensus earnings for this year and next year (12/99, per Yahoo)are
$4.20 and $4.66. I'll just lop off about 15% for their '00 earnings, on the
assumption that if you can't calculate earnings, then they can't either. Still,
at $4.00 if it were to happen, that's a pe of 5.

You're maybe right about PSR. Before all the debt accumulation and before all
the acquisitions, the stock was right around it's current price. And psr was
.38 or .34. Now, psr at.22, -- while it's the lowest figure I've seen, perhaps,
as you point out, I haven't well enough factored in the outstanding $3-4
billion in debt. Maybe about .15 (just a guess) on $73/sh in sales (assumes
$740M revs. lost in divestitures) That makes it about $11/sh = fair value. (Lot
different from $19-20). But $11 seems too low to me.

I just don't know what to pay for a dollar of sales. The business is getting
more competitive it seems, and the large car companies are consolidating. And
in turn, they want their suppliers to be big, global, and provide much more
engineering/design capabilities than in earlier years (imo). This has forced
supplier companies to broaden their scope of work but concentrate on areas
where they might sustain some competitive advantage (e.g. design, develop,
manufacture everything related to suspensions but not be a number 3 player in
trim.) Again, all imo. The benefits are closer and longer worker relationships
with the car companies, but perhaps being more tied-in even closer to the
sector's ups and downs.

You look at the financials and conclude they're too messed up to be able to
determine earnings or scope out what happens when the auto cycle turns down. So
you've moved on. Which is fine. My way is different.

I look at FMO and see a $6 billion sales/yr company with a hundred year
history. It employs more than 50,000 people in plants worldwide. To manage,
they are using (or they say they are) EVA, of which I am a big believer. The
management is a scrappy bunch (as with the large number of acquisitions). But
they overextended themselves. Now they apparently realize this and are trying
to extricate the company from this predicament. Its stock is selling at a
multiyear low. (As are some other comparable stocks in the sector.) I don't see
that there's a cyclical downturn coming. Coming it may, but I don't see it. I
assume that the company will not spin into oblivion in the next few years. I
assume at some point the selling will stop and at some point perceptions will
change. I'm willing to make a small bet now that I will see $30 in 18 months. I
see it also as hedging my Dana bet a little. If Dana rises I'll bet that FMO
will too. Maybe there's a problem with FMO and it won't. But rather than jump
up my bet on Dana, I'd rather diversify a little and start with a small amount
in another company.

Okay, Ron Bower, I'm following you into WAKB today.

Stock is a buy at today's price, imo.

Has some aspects of a growth stock (increasing revenues, investor interest in
its business (outsourcing), diversifies its competencies - e.g. starting a
staffing service). To this are coupled value metrics (cash plus WHC holding,
low pe, low psr, little ltd). These positives are offset by: a complicated
capital structure (relatively hard to find WAKB sh.), Wackenhut family totally
controls, erratic (from what I can tell) earnings and dividends, and just
"moderate" roe)

WAK & WAKB stock prices are declining almost daily and WAKB is now at its
initial 1995 point (according to Yahoo chart). Since I can't find any reason
for such a decline, and the future looks pretty attractive imo for the
business, the management appears (to me) to be on top of things, and there's
all that cash and WHC shares, I'll call the stock mispriced at current levels.

(I chose the B shares over WAK because the B tracks the WAK, is cheaper, and
the only difference is it's non-voting.)

I suspect that the current earnings streams in part reflect
the enormous bull market we've had.

1. Capital gains taxes to state and federal governments.
2. Pension funding issues.
3. Trading, underwriting, and commissions.
4. Higher levels of consumption.
5. High levels of borrowing.

So I am less trustworthy of the environment in general and valuations based on

Armin: I believe Mike's performance supports the thesis that a small investor
that learns the tools and methods of analysis and applies them well has
substantial advantages over similarly well-informed and capable fund managers:
The small investor, because of smaller positions, has a vastly broader
investable universe - The fund manager with 100's of millions or billions must
play in larger cap or experience excessive slippage acquiring and selling low
liquidity positions
For the same reason, a small investor can more effectively 'trade around [buy
dips, sell surges] a low-liquidity position to lower average cost and improve
returns [though most don't do this well]
The small investor is no longer as relatively disadvantaged verses the
professional, due to wide variety of tools and information on the net -
screeners info that used to cost institutions big time are now free.
The message boards give small investors access to what Phil Fisher called
scuttlebut - perspectives of customers, employees, and individuals that have
followed the companies and provide insights {Mike mentioned Ron Bower's
extensive due dilligence in Deswell for example} I doubt that many professional
analysts actively mine this resource [JJC being an exception]
The smaller investor isn't generally following or holding 100's of issues and
can thus better focus
The small investor often has real world access and experience in certain
sectors or industries that give advantage over institutional types [As has been
cited by Peter Lynch]
The small investor isn't under the gun to perform quarterly and thus chase hot
sectors and ignore cool ones that contain the better values - sometimes
out-of-favor investing looks bad in the short run, but manias do end badly and
contrarian value strategies have stood the test of time
The small investor has more flexibility to short than do fund managers
The small investor can step away from the market or sectors that are
overheated, but this is when the fund manager has the most money pouring in,
and the small investor doesn't have to contend with redemptions when his chosen
sectors are out of favor, but values are most favorable.

I was just taking the reverse side. We've had better disclosure in the U.S. for

To me, the present value of "more real" income streams like we have in the US
does not enhance the value of the businesses. The lack of them decreases the
value. So rather than argue for higher prices in the US than we have seen in
the past, I would argue for lower prices overseas relative to the US as the
fairer case. Some very smart people think earnings quality in the US is
declining at present.

share price as yield adjusts are potential rewards *If you're right about
operator health & rent coverage* I haven't looked at HR specifically other than
a brief glance as I already have exposure to the sector with ETT & HRP.

Daniel,

I believe your observations about the pain on the short side of your portfolio
is exactly what's causing the meltup. If you look at the market on an
individual company basis, it appears that the bear market continues among many
"value stocks" and the melt up is happening in the overvalued momentum area
where all the shorts are getting killed and covering. Even in yesterday's 250
point rally the breath was not too good.

Mike. Since you started this board and the arbitrage board you might be
interested in amcol, ACO. Company has definitive agreement to sell their
polymers unit and will receive sufficient cash to pass 14-14.5 to shareholders
and to also pay off considerable debt. A patient investor should be able to buy
now at between 16 and 16.5. My judgement is that the deal will go through and
that the residual company after partial liquidation(about 1/2 of the assets)
will fetch between 4 and 6. So investment might return 10-20 % in 3-4 months.
Lots of unknowns but also a low risk IMHO.

My situation is different, perhaps, so I will consider going long QQQ.

We have here on the value thread, very few investors who are actually buying
and holding value stocks, imo. It seems to me that when anyone posts of a value
stock, there's generally, not always - but mostly, indifference. With good
reason. If I just look at the value stocks I am buying, I find it hard to see
why general investors would want to have positions in them. Mundane, dull
businesses (compared to QQQ). And if some or all of these value stocks provide
a margin of safety for investors-- big deal. I can't imagine anyone in their
twenties or thirties even wanting to work in these businesses, let alone invest
in them. (Regardless of salaries paid. Come in at high pay, get 4% raises and
dinky stock matches that go nowhere. Phooey.) Value stocks - companies that
manufacture, companies that rely on physical assets, they are the to-be history
for Mexico, Thailand, China. The future of the US is in the QQQ companies.
Intellectual based. Desirable places for the best and brightest to work, to
compete, to add value.

Stories of internet billionaires created in 3 years and people in their 20's
with multimillions in stock. For people who want to participate in the heart of
their '90's world, they need to dance the current dance, not the minuet, the
waltz, or the twist. Anybody will seek out what's meaningful to them. If not
through their own work, then through their investments. People will take money
from traditional funds, from traditional investments, and shift them to stocks
promising, and for right now, delivering, winning/winner's performance. The QQQ
will continue to increase, imo, at the expense of stocks that value investors
think are good investments.

I see reports now of funds up 100% this year. The bogey we've talked about on
this thread -- beat that S&P 500 -- that's almost passe. If your mutual funds
can't even beat that index - when the NASDQ is up what, over 50%, just sell
those funds (and so make the managers get out of garp stocks, reit stocks,
bricks and mortar stocks, dividend stocks, etc.) Seems pretty rational to me,
even if QQQ is at insane heights.
For fund managers, large cap, value, whatever-- I can certainly see that they
are doing what they are paid to do - find the best stocks within their working
boundary. But I guess too, that every person reading this post personally knows
of at least one individual who is making millions by holding stocks of internet
companies or QQQ companies. Therefore, to me, it is somewhat reasonable to look
at these fund managers and say, you boxed yourselves into a corner, or you were
so stubborn in your stock selections, you never bought any or enough QQQ
stocks? When there are people, regular folk, all over the country who are
making millions of dollars buying and holding QQQ stocks, you guys did too
little to late.

Could QQQ stocks be the new S&P stocks for fund managers? They buy and sell
within the QQQ universe - trying for an advantage by overweighting or
underweighting. But mostly always staying within the QQQ universe. Could there
thus be the reality of the NASDAQ (now at 3000+) within a few years overtaking
the DOW (at 11000+)?

I don't know what will happen. I suspect that those who are shorting (or
buying) QQQ are basing their decisions on what the Japanese call KKD
-experience, intuition, and guts. That might work. It might not.

Jim I will politely remind you of something I previously said on this thread, I
believe when Mike was shorting Amazon early this year. You never short
overvaluation as that is something that has no inherent limit. You short stocks
with visibly deteriorating fundamentals, that is recognized by the Street and
confirmed by a chart pattern - at a price well above where you believe it is
heading if the current trend continues. By those criteria, most of current
highflyers are not shorts.

One little example, if you were to look at the XICO chart (up 10 times this
year from the low), its earnings record and its balance sheet, many people
would conclude that this price is crazy. They would be dead wrong. The
technology business is so dynamic that the fundamentals for a company can
change faster than we can possibly imagine for traditional value companies.

I would agree that the risk/ reward ratio has changed somewhat. The
fundamentals for ORTL, and ALSC have not changed much but they have gone from
20 to 60 and from 2 to 15, on the other hand my strategy for investment is can
I double my money in a year or make 40% in a 3 month period of time and from
that point of view I am still 100% invested in tech stocks, except for THQI
which I guess is not really a tech stock. it just grows like one VBG. The
fiber-optic , storage, wireless telecom areas will just grow tremendously over
the next decade, and there are many companies that will participate in that
growth, and many of these companies will generate earnings that justify higher
share prices. I have never been a good seller of stocks so if anything I tend
to exit early. I have for awhile pondered how I would diversify out of tech and
I do not have an answer yet as the greatest returns seem to me to be in that
category.

Paul, that was an unexpected and thought provoking comment. I just got my fund
statement for my international value fund and it has had almost no appreciation
in a year and a half. I was doubly dissappointed that there was not a letter of
apology from the fund manager offering to rebate his fee for the past year and
a half. The truth is that most fund managers have to own the qqq stocks
otherwise if they don't they leave themselves open to get buried just like my
fund manager has done. I am sure that with this kind of performance the fund
must be experiencing a hugh outflow of investment dollars into international
growth funds if nothing else. Therefore the tendency will be for the
risk/return ratios to continue to improve for the value stocks. But there may
not be an price appreciation until the tech exhuberance ends. When will that
be? Don;t know but I do not think we are there yet.

Well, with ADSP, there was no increase in sales, they actually had less sales
this year than last. Lost more money, also mentioned in a statement that they
would be out of cash in 9 months. They were hyped up on CNBC as a "wireless
play" which is a hot area right now. Unfortuntaly, the idiots at CNBC think
that a "remote access device" is wireless, when it isn't. I know the computer
field, as I am a computer consultant, and could see what was being hyped up.

I would be scared to death to short something like Amazon. I have never owned
Amazon stock, and probably never will. I think they have a viable business
model for future earnings, unlike what many on this thread think. I buy a lot
from Amazon.com, and I can guarantee you, even if they did up the prices, I
would still buy from them. They are a trusted name, get orders processed
quickly, and make me a happy customer. I would gladly pay a little more for the

Craig Bartels's post is one of the more useful that I've seen on this thread.

Using his personal experience as a 'value detection device' he describes Amazon
as follows: <<I think they have a viable business model for future earnings,
unlike what many on this thread think. I buy a lot from Amazon.com, and I can
guarantee you, even if they did up the prices, I would still buy from them.
They are a trusted name, get orders processed quickly, and make me a happy
customer. I would gladly pay a little more for the convenience. >>

What Bartels doesn't understand is that Value Investors recognize that the
current price of a stock should equal the net present value of future free cash
flow for that company. In Amazon's case, to justify the current stock price in
10 years it will need to have $100 billion in sales and still be growing at 40%
per year with an after tax 10% operating profit margin.

Since this result would be a 5 or 6 sigma event, investors on this thread are
betting against it. They hope that they can hold that short until facts align
with reason. Bartels as a daytrader can only hold until the end of a session.

Sort of a match of attrition between rational capital allocators and the
go-with-the-glands crowd. Can reason outlast hormones?

I guess let me explain more. All I said was they have a viable business model.
I didn't say their stock was anything close to something a value investor would
buy. What I'm saying is, why short something that could conceivably double
again in 3 months? Unless someone has the $$$ to hold a short position when
it's 2x out of the money. I would rather short something that isn't so much in
favor. How would it have felt to have shorted a couple thousand shares of
Redhat at 50, when it was seriously overpriced? Now they are 5x out of the
money and still short? I sure don't want to be in that position...I agree they
will come back to earth, but it is worth it to have all your money tied up for
3 years to wait for them to come back to earth when the money could be used in
other stocks that actually have good fundamentals and are undervalued?

Maybe I should change my profile, because I do buy for value, but day trade
some stocks as well. As I've said in the past, I have held on to stocks for 4-5
years at a time, as well as held stocks for less than a day. This has worked
out great for me, as I have been up over 100% each year over the past 6 years.
I don't think protraying me as a "day trader" has anything to do with it. As
hard as it is to comprehend, you can day trade a stock as well as hold other
stocks long term and be a value investor.

Good article on value investing.

VALUE INVESTING CARRIED OFF BY TECH-STOCK TIDE

Bill Barnhart
December 5, 1999
This fall's rebound in mutual fund cash flow has been little comfort to
Chicago-based Skyline Funds.

Faced with poor investment performance and shareholder redemptions, officials
of the respected investment boutique have asked shareholders to merge two of
the three Skyline funds into the flagship Special Equities Fund.

The Skyline Contrarian and Small-Cap Value Plus funds would disappear into
Special Equities, which, according to manager William Dutton, has had "a very
tough year."

Special Equities, with an enviable 10-year average annual rate of return of 14
percent, is down about 13 percent so far this year. The fund was reopened to
new investors in October to generate cash.

Dutton, one of the best-known specialists in value investing--buying stocks at
prices that are low in relation to such things as earnings, sales and
assets--said the move is being recommended to focus Skyline's investment
research on a single portfolio and "bring all hands on deck."

Not exactly all hands: Kenneth Kailin, manager of Value Plus, will join the
Special Equities team; Daren Heitman, manager of Contrarian, is leaving the
firm.

Despite the bull market, many funds are unable to swim against today's
prevailing tide of investor preference for hot technology stocks.

With substantial sectors of fund investing--notably diversified small-company
funds and value funds--being shunned, and with no relief in sight, fund
companies come under great pressure to cast the losers overboard.

So far this year, 306 equity mutual funds have been liquidated or merged into
other funds, up from 289 funds for all of 1998, according to Chicago-based fund
researcher Morningstar Inc.

The consequences may produce unwanted capital gains in taxable accounts and
consternation for shareholders of disappearing funds.

Fund managers find especially galling the apparent belief among many amateur
investors that diversified stock-picking by professionals--the essence of many
mutual fund strategies--doesn't work and that the best mutual funds are merely
vessels for hot stocks.

The estrangement between professional investors, including such notables as
Warren Buffett and Dutton, and the public has never been greater.

In the November issue of Fortune magazine, Buffett inveighs against ordinary
investors, saying they have their eyes focused exclusively on the rear-view
mirror and foolishly expect the recent glorious stock market gains to last.

"Once a bull market gets under way, and once you reach the point where
everybody has made money, no matter what system he or she has followed, a crowd
is attracted into the game that is responding not to interest rates and profits
but simply to the fact that it seems to be a mistake to be out of stocks,"
Buffett wrote. "Like Pavlov's dog, these `investors' learn that when the bell
rings--in this case, the one that opens the New York Stock Exchange at 9:30
a.m.--they get fed."

Buffett errs in at least one important respect: Investors who follow the system
he advocates, known generically as value investing, are not being fed.
Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, is down 18 percent so far this
year and 29 percent from its peak in March.

Dutton dates the beginning of the Special Equities Fund's downturn to the
summer of 1998. This year's rise in interest rates has eroded many
small-company stocks, he added. But Dutton, too, cites individual investors as
part of the problem.

Asked why the value approach to investing has fallen so far out of favor,
despite convincing historical evidence of the strategy's merit, he said: "It's
hard to know exactly why that's happening. Generally, the individual investor
is not concerned with valuation. They are concerned with growth stories and
concepts. The stocks we invest in don't tend to be concepts."

Stocks he owns include such un-techie Chicago-area names as Chicago Bridge and
Iron, industrial-pump maker Idex, insurance broker Arthur J. Gallagher and
Heller Financial.

"They tend to be more mundane businesses where we think there are interesting
things going on, but they are not the stuff that captures the interest of
individual investors," he said.

These stocks may advance, as all boats rise with the tide of greater
productivity.

"The fact is that markets behave in ways, sometimes for a very long stretch,
that are not linked to [company] value," Buffett said. "Sooner or later,
though, value counts."

Dutton put it this way: "Somehow, I have faith that [the abandonment of value
stocks] won't persist for a long time, because much of what's happening today
doesn't make any sense from a financial point of view. You have to go back to
the issue of, What are we really doing here? Are we really buying a piece of a
business, or are we just trading pieces of paper?"

You can't fault the logic of value investors such as Buffett and Dutton. But,
to put things in historical terms, when employers and politicians decided years
ago to hand off responsibility for the nation's retirement savings to workers,
through 401(k) plans and the like, they created the risk that the stock market
would tilt away from traditional investment practices.

Empowering individual investors has spawned a more chaotic, daring stock market
that, by the way, has been more receptive than more conventional investment
analysis to financing the useful technology innovations now being employed
profitably by traditional "value" companies.

No one can put individual investors back onto the reservation. Chances are slim
that a sell-off in aggressive growth stocks, even if it lasts for years, will
create many converts to value investing.

Dumb question: Do global/international funds report returns in local currencies
only?

No. International (non-U.S.) and global (U.S. plus international) funds report
returns in dollars. As a result, the gains or losses these funds report often
reflect changing currency values rather than intrinsic investment values
measured in the local currency.

Allen,

ACO would've been great cheaper, but now I'm just thinking that I'm being
compensated for my risk as an arbitrageur. I think I'll pass based on the scope
of the unknowns. It's interesting that they're being careful to quote the sales
of the remaining enterprise, while we know what they're selling is their
higher-margin business. I'll put it on my list of things to investigate.

Now, if I could find a company that was where ACO was at last Jan-Feb, with a
liquidatable $14 dollar asset, a remaining dominant business worth $4-5, and
selling at $8 1/2, then I'd be in it like Flynn.

As far as arbitrage, I held the Case position in my mom's account all the way
until the close. Looks like about 5 months for $7.75 on a 47.25 base. That's
about 39% annualized. The tech focus of the market will let these types of
yields happen. ACO may be another one. But with good utilities at 5-8% and
REITs at 10-15% and an industrial company or two at 10-11%, there's more
competition out there for my income/crash resistant money.

Wallace,

Goodyear popped up in my universe as a contrarian, what with the share price
falling off a cliff and it getting booted from the Dow and all.

But from a value standpoint, I'm not convinced. It's a leader in the field
maybe but it's not a true growth company. It remains priced quite high when I
look at the huge maintenance cap ex. This is mature and I don't expect it to
grow out of its hole. Looks like the stock quadrupled over two decades early
70's to early 90's. Long-term growth rate around 7% - and that may be coming
down. And with Dogs of Dow selling coming at year-end. For a PE 16 stock, I
still see a lot of downside. For this multiple, I'd rather be in Ralph Lauren.

And the yield to me seems 1)not protected and 2)decent at nearly 4% but
practically something to sneeze at given the yields that can be found on
equities in this market.

ABM I like, but it seems decently priced now. I think it is a relatively safe
after-tax annualized rate of return of about 12%, but I don't see it as a
bargain. The positives are its consistency, with rising ROA, ROE in an industry
that will not be rocked by tech changes. Negatives are that from current
valuations by my calculation, one can only expect 11.66% on average over the
next 10 years if held that long. Given that it is making new 52 week lows, it
may reach a PE in the mid-high single digits, which would drastically improve
its potential return. Oh yeah - I'm looking at it from a Buffett perspective
rather than an asset-based Grahamian one. Interestingly, if it gets to old
support around 15, it's expected annual return jumps to 15.26%. At that point I
would consider buying. Insider buying at those levels (less than 1/2 old highs)
would help too.

Re: shorts,

So far this year, shorting has been nicely profitable for me. Yes, even AMZN,
which I recently re-shorted at 84 and change. I've got a list of potential
shorts on Yahoo that is simply exploding upward. New highs and all. Keeping my
powder dry and as far as I'm concerned those are analogues to undervalued
depressed stocks. There will be a glorious opportunity to short them. I've
taken some profits, had a good year now with some cash, and watching for short
opportunities as well as buy opportunities (I've got 6 I want to buy now but
why not wait for better prices). There's some merit to what J. Bash has to say.
I don't think shorting the QQQ is the answer. But to give up on shorting when
short candidates are as omnipresent now as undervalued stocks were at the
bottom of the '74 bear, or to buy the QQQ isn't the answer either. There's
still room for intelligent investing, IMO.

maintain a diversified portfolio, and value stocks - or what I perceive to be
value stocks anyway - are the biggest component by dollar value in most of my
portfolios, then I want to look around for ways to diversify. One way would be
to buy QQQ. Another would be to buy a relatively small amount of
internet/telecommunications stocks. (I'm doing this.) Another way would be to
short apparently overvalued stocks (I do this but don't have any success.) Or
short a basket of stocks using options. (I don't have any success with
options.)

If you will look real, real closely you will find, imo, that most people do not
make consistent profits or a lot of profits from shorting stocks. There aren't
so many people who've quit their day jobs- from what I can see, based on
profits from selling short. But there many who have profited immensely by being
long.
There are some successful short sellers sure.... Anthony, Mr. Pink, and perhaps
a bunch of their followers. On this thread, Peter M. comes to mind and might be
another. You will notice that Mike Burry argues for short selling as a very
good opportunity in today's or tomorrow's market, and his actual short position
is very small compared to his overall portfolio and is used as a hedge,
according to his site notes. This seems reasonable to me.

Switching back-and-forth between long and short positions or having large short
positions (in dollar amounts)-- that, from what I can tell and from what I read
of successful investors - is best left to professionals. That my opinion,
anyway. I want to say also, that I hope I am basing my opinion on what I see
and experts say, and NOT on my own experience. That is, just because I can't
short well, I'm not saying shorting doesn't work and people shouldn't short.

opportunity in today's or tomorrow's market, and his actual short position is
very small compared to his overall portfolio and is used as a hedge, according
to his site notes. 

To me, this seems the only logical way. The traditional argument is that only
those with enough capital to short for the long term can consistently make
money. Ok, but if so, then what is the actual return on the at-risk TOTAL
capital. If one must have "enough capital" to tolerate a 300% loss on a short
position without hurting too much - and being able to maintain the position-
then the 100% maximum profit on that position won't amount to much more than an
incremental percentage return on actual available capital even if it does
occur.

Where is that excess capital (the capital that allows you to maintain a
long-term short position) best deployed to maximize the total return on
capital? IMO, assuming that none of us can time markets well (an assumption
that I feel is very valid), the best place for that capital is in long
positions. At least then you're hedged with the odds of your own good
fundamental analysis with you on both sides.

Interestingly, I've found that even a small short hedge (I've been up to 10%)
position against a long portfolio can be amazingly effective during a general
downturn - along with an obligatory gold position and a solid oil position.

Good investing,
Mike

Hi Paul,

If you will look real, real closely you will find, imo, that most people do not
make consistent profits or a lot of profits from shorting stocks.

... Until recently, I did :-(.

Until recently, I was a lot smarter then than I am now ;-)

...or having large short positions .... is best left to professionals.

Until recently, I was smart enough to do this ;-)

Do this math:

Year 1: Up 40% (gosh I'm smart... Soros only compounded 35%)
Year 2: Up 40% (Guess I really am smart!...)
Year 3: Down 40% (Niederhoffer!)

Net: Up 17% over three years. That's half a percent better than T-Bills!

Now I am a real smart (until recently! ;-) guy who understands the risks, who
is grown up and can "handle it", who only "invests" (speculates with) what he
can afford to lose, who knows the downsides, who appreciates that you really
can lose in this game, and that it is real money. And let me tell you, -40%
hurts the ego and confidence more than I could have imagined, even though I
thought I understood the psychology and the numbers behind this.

Now before you start feeling badly for me, can you imagine how much a 40% hit
will hurt the pocketbook, ego and animal spirits of today's investors? It
strikes me that this could be very depressing (pun intended). It hurts me to
think about how most people I know will be moderately to seriously hurt by such
an "event", and that I don't see anything that I can do to help them avoid
getting hurt.

Paul, I agree with you that shorting is not for most people. Aside from the
reasons that I have previously posted that most people are shorting entirely
the wrong stocks at the wrong times and are only lucky to make money - since
most stocks shorted are merely overvalued stocks, not busted stocks with busted
fundamentals - there are two other important reasons.

There is plenty of opportunity to make a fortune by being long the right
stocks. Finding the right ones is difficult and more than a full time job, for
people who by and large have day jobs. Shorting is a distraction from finding
stocks that can double and triple. I own 4 tech stocks that have doubled in the
last 3 months, that I watch like a hawk. Why should I spent one minute looking
for something that has far less than 100% potential over even a medium time
frame? I don't.

In my opinion, shorting is not a solution for underperforming value investors.
Tinkering with your stock selection process is, to include
additional value criteria. Every one of the 4 stocks I alluded to above was
bought for value considerations, including new mgmt, low PSR, and participation
in a dynamic new industry that was given away for nothing in the price. All
four had new mgmt over the last year or two plus low PSR, one had the new
technology participation being given away for nothing. (All had visible
blemishes which are shrinking under the new mgmt).

By the way, I do not limit myself to tech stocks at all. As you folks know I
was a strong proponent of NH and COO at low prices earlier in the year.

Mike, the best short is a stock of a company on the way to bankruptcy.
That is a 100% return that might take years to achieve. Anything short of that
usually means a much smaller return over a still considerable time frame.

As far as "the end must be near" goes, don't bet on it from my statements. I do
not now and NEVER HAVE invested in any stock where I did not think I could make
at least 100%, over a couple of years. This is not a passbook savings type of
risk we are dealing with in the stock market. I was trained as an actuary,
where assessing risks was my business. In my opinion, if you shoot for smaller
returns you won't cover well the emotional and intellectual errors you will
make yourself in buying or selling, AND the deviations from expected
performance even when you execute perfectly with a great analysis, but the
company underperforms for a myriad of reasons.

In conclusion, since shorting is most of the time a less than 100%
game, I won't play.

Just stopped by to hype SPRI a little bit. Book value is $4.48 with $3.93 of
that in cash. The company provides IT services to fortune 1000 companies but
got clobbered this year due to so much of the IT budgets going toward Y2K bug
fixing. The company earned .77 in 1998 and was trading in the low 20s at the
beginning of the year. Currently trading at $5 and is trending upward off a
long flat double bottom. EPS consensus for 2000 is .05 which leaves plenty of
room for surprises and upgrades if business returns to normal. I don't think
they'll hit 1998 numbers but .05 is too low.

My take on this is to each his own- Bash is not running a mutual fund he is

twister, I respectfully disagree with your interpretation of my remarks. Let me
clarify my post. I did not say that my expectation was to achieve 100% returns
from my portfolio over 2 years. I said that I would not buy an individual stock
that I did not think I could make 100% on in 2 years because of the errors I
described that tend to reduce returns. I do not expect to make 100% over 2
years for my total portfolio, nor do I make it.

Having that standard for adding an individual stock excludes a LOT of stocks,
but does not necessarily leave me with having to buy pieces of junk. Two
examples ON WHICH I HAVE NOT DONE MUCH DUE DILIGENCE are
HRC and EBSC, which have been mentioned here. I can tell you right now that
100% over two years on those stocks is POSSIBLE. However, my job as an investor
is to determine how PROBABLE that is. If I do not think the odds are good I
won't buy.

I might add that this strategy gives me at least a couple of ideas a month,
many of which are not as good as what I own, so I may do nothing, as I also do
not believe that you can properly follow a large portfolio of stocks -- which
for me means a lot of work, including talking to management by email or
otherwise, etc. (My turnover is low, probably too low.)

OT: Anyone look at RHAT on short side - makes AMZN look like value play. They
package Linux [Freeware essentially] with their own tools and helps and offer
consulting services. This year they'll do $15 - $20 million annual revenues
with no profits when analyst concensus calls for 5 year growth of 'profits' @
25%.
If revenues grew at 50% annually [twice analyst projected 'earnings' growth
rate], in 5 years RHAT would be selling at 126 times projected revenue [not
profit, revenue] based on todays closing market cap of $19.5 Billion.
And it appears that, other than brand name recognition, there's nothing to stop
competitors from offering the software and a bunch of help stuff in a box.
Consulting isn't scalable like software, so growth there is tethered to ability
hire linux guys. There are new competitors Corel and 2 coming IPO's and I bet a
bunch more are looking at coming in.
Today it added a mere $3.6 Billion in market cap rising 53 to 284. With this
kind of momentum, it would be nearly suicidal to short with anything other than
wee tiny % of equity, but I post it here as my candidate for POSTER CHILD of
