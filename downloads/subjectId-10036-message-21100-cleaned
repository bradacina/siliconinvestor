Rainy_Day_Woman: About FRS: I'll take an exploratory position.

Their Golden Corral which "is expanding and taking off" looks to me like it's
flubbing. Same-store comps are down, but mgmt. must be positive because they
are increasing the number of units.

Positives for me are FRS's relatively low p/e and increasing book value. Price
has been lot lower though on a p/sales, p/book basis. Back otoh, a positive is
that profit margins have been slowly increasing.

Worth a tiny bet to me.

I own KO - at a profit, what a novelty;>)! I believe it reports next week, I
think there is a good chance it will meet or beat, and trade higher.
I could be all wet (and note, like Paul S., I've been wrong many, many times
before), but I think we could have a market reversal next week, given the
magnitude of the drop this week.
I've gotten killed on SYMC, still like it. I think AMAT is a buy at these
levels, unfortunately I was a buyer in the 15-16 range. Looking at HDI,
probably won't bite.
Repurchased FRB today at 18.41 after offing it at 19.62 on March 9 (got a
little over a point plus the div.). I think this is a good entry point, this is
a "loan participation" floating rate fund, where the div. will float depending
on the payout of the underlying credits. It has raised the monthly div. within
the last three months. Is trading at a discount to NAV of about 6.5%, which is
historically low in its short trading history. I think it was sold off today as
people perceive that the Fed will be less aggressive in raising interest rates
for the foreseeable future (IMHO a debatable premise).
Repurchased CSCO today, think that is a good speculation.

re FII & AVZ - Funny how one analyst downgrades FII because he thinks that
investors will move money out of Money market funds (which is 705 of FII
managed assets) into riskier investments. If there ever is a triple play on a
falling stock market and rising ST interest rates and narrowing yield gap
between St and LT interest rates, FII should be it. Nevertheless the stock is
down for now trading at a forward PE of 13. If i believe the analyst forecast
that's a pretty good price for an asset manager which typically does not need
much capital to growth the business. Ditto with somewhat battered AVZ, which
trades at a PE of 12.5. I am tempted to buy back half of my position i sold

OT: Madharry. If I had one stock I preferred over all others, I'd be plenty

Largest buy position amount would be maybe 5% with that position likely lagged
into over time. As regards holding vs. buying, in some smaller portfolios, I've
been willing to hold all of a position even as that one position has increased
to maybe about 14% of the portfolio's value. At some point though, I will scare
myself into believing that it's prudent to trim and move on. (Which differs
from the Buffett, et. al. approach which says - if you've picked the right
stock, why sell? Or -- even if the stock is moderately overvalued, if it's a
good moat stock with good future, again - such stocks are hard to find, and so
once more - why sell?)

Perhaps it's a matter of purpose and goals. I am not looking for one stock upon
which to place my future - I don't need a do or die bet. It's not necessary for
me to find the one stock, the profit from which will enable a lifestyle change
for me. I see investing as a long term process, so I don't feel I need to make
a big bet on any one particular stock. Plus, given that I am wrong a lot,
especially where I initially believed I was so right, I am leery of big bets.

re largest position. With taking a big position, the downside matters for me
more so than the upside. this means that it is quite unlikely that I establish
a huge position in stock just because it is cheap because cheap means that
there are typically issues with the stock. With a large cap stock with very low
perceived risk like NSRGY, i would probably go up to 8% with an individual
position, for a dangerous stock with issues like AIG it's more like 2.5% and
for a microcap 1%. I am a dedicated bottom fisher and have been tempted to
average down loosing position in stock that i perceive to be cheap. Sometimes
it works out and sometimes it doesn't. It's important not to dig oneself into a

If I do find an outstanding value, which happens very rarely, I buy as much as
I can. Otherwise, I don't buy. When I've found a company that I've thoroughly
researched in a business I understand, at a low price against my valuation
model, the risk factor is small and I feel confident in the purchase. I mean,
why put the money somewhere worse? ;-) In real terms, this can be up to 25% of
my portfolio, although it's typically around 10%. It won't ever be 100% because
I do reserve about 25% cash for when the market tanks and I want to buy, and of
course I have existing investments I don't want to sell. In my experience,
taking meaningful positions in a company forces me to do my homework and also
forces me to play for as large a margin of safety as possible, e.g. waiting
patiently for a good price. There is a broad diversity component in my
decision-making across economic sectors. This approach isn't for everyone
naturally, but if I didn't do it, the next best thing in my opinion would be
the other extreme, e.g. a cheap index fund.

To me, that's low enough of a p/e for a small buy.

Hasn't seemed to have affected business or the stock price (which recovered
from abrupt lows from last year when shenanigans were discovered). Third Avenue

More Oil Sands.

I bought Canadian Oil Sands this week (some on monday at a great price, and
some on wednesday). Similar to SU. A good hedge against oil prices going to
$70/bbl.

http://www.cos-trust.com/

Their outlook for 2005 (it's in this presentation link below) is CAN$6.29 and
is based on US$40 oil. A bit conservative, I would think. $1 higher oil per bbl
adds 41 cents per share. So US$55 oil would add CAN$6 per share -- almost
double the cash flow.

Plus 50% capacity expansion ramp up in 2006. More expansion mapped beyond that.
Should go from 220,000 b/d now to 500,000 b/d in 10 years. 2.3% dividend until
then.

PS -- Anyone here have an opinion on NTY?

Volsi Mimir: Forgot about EXPO. I've been out of that one for about a year.
About SEB. I remember it well - because I never bought when I asked about it
here, and the stock's done very well since. If you bought when it was mentioned
here, you've done okay, imo. Stock was about $206 2/17/03. Closed yesterday at
$1122 down $65. Hard to miss those big numbers when the infrequently traded
stock zips by on a financial news tv networks screen. (aside: I see the p/e is
only about 8 according to Yahoo.)

----
I'll pass on FMC. Looks too expensive for me based on past p/sales, etc.

I continue to hold URS, but I'm not willing to add more. Seems to me it might
be too late to buy JEC, GVA. I bought CUB recently for the highway bill.
(There'll be more toll roads, and one part of CUB's business is the ticket
dispensers, toll booth stuff.)

Grommit, I like NTY, and imo, it's a buy a current price. (We'll know better
though on Tues. when they report -g-) Company (and sector) is in a difficult
vitamin market at this time.

Nice interview with Mr. Kamil, Pres. and CFO, in Dec. 8 Wall Street Transcript.

In addition to holding a few shares of the company, I also have a few shares of
NUTR, fwiw.

Grommit, why CMI now? To me, CMI is now too far up the curve in what in past
has been very cyclical businesses. I'd want to buy when p/sales or p/bk are
near past lows. For me, maybe a consideration at 1.5x book, but not at 2.1. ROE
seems unusually high, so one has to wonder about its sustainability.

Not saying the stock won't or can't move up to highs, just that for me, I don't
see it as a buy.

Hey Suma,

CLE is interesting especially given the fact that they compete against
everyone, but have no "direct" competitors.

Teenage fashion and, in general, apparel retailers become loved and/or hated
due to fashion trends. Of course, Claire's Stores strategy is to sell the
accessories.

Interesting company that caters to the teens and is moving up the age bracket
to cater to the 20s.

Check it out. It hasn't moved much just hanging in at the price of $ 22.00 but
it is moving up today and there is a nice article under the stock symbol on

It might be a relatively "safe" play on consumption since teenagers have a bit

Howdy Paul,
FMC --bot more after durables report brought the market down,
Fed may wait now--- if not I believe FMC has a good mix-- potash, health and
agriculture. just my humble (often wrong) opinion-- I am NOT a BIOtech picker
that is for sure.

if you want to listen to a good conference call on LPG, oil--
and related engineering for it, CBI had a great one this morn,
real quick with the numbers and the questions were more general related than
company specific.
http://www.cbiepc.com/ir/presentations/default.aspx

this isn't a recommend on this stock, company has legal issues,
mid high multiples but in a great sweet spot in what they do.

About CMI. Grommit & others - if you're looking at Cummins, how about Navistar?
Seems like it's now beat up enough to maybe be looked at.

re CLE - this stock was talked about on this thread a while ago, first
mentioned by Grommit. I own some. The LT track record suggest tha the business
i more stable then most investors assume. I own some from about 20$ and i think
it's still a nice GAARP stock.

re OSHC - first earnings out. 9c/share for the quarter fully diluted which
counts the shares at the MHC (55%) as well. if one were to count only the
issued shares (45%) then earnings are 20c/share or 80c annualized. This is a PE
of 12.5 for a stock with an "effective" book value of around 13$.

As i mentioned before, OSHC is one of the better mutual thrifts in that it
gives you more bank for the money: 500M$ in assets for 8.7M shares is less than
most comparative conversions which issue about 12M shares at a comparative
size. Seems like a good start, now OSHC needs to deploy their excessive capital
- they intend to grow their branches from 6 to 8 - seems OK to me.

FWIW, i sold my small position in BVFL for a small gain. Thinking about adding
to OSHC or starting BFSB which appears OK on some metric and also is below IPO
price.

The Q1 release for OSHC is showing Stk. Equity of $60 million with 8.44 million
shares outstanding. That is a book value of around $7.1/share.

I'm wondering why the difference with your effective $13 book number? Perhaps
it is something with the MHC conversion - but it would seem if there was a need
to account for that much difference the management would at least make mention
of it in yesterdays PR to help the investing public evaluate their company?
