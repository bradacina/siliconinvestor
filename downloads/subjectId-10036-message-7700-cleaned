re: WMI

I agree on deeper problems. There is probably a thread dedicated to this type
of "broken value" situation. I would be looking for fundamental changes such as
new management, a new, large outside investor to shake up the board, greater
contact with analysts... This one doesn't look as dismal as some that I have
watched but if you can't trust the management then anything can happen. Witness
the former CCA, now PZN.

Patience on the buy decision has served me well in these cases but I'm not sure
if I'm going to bite on this one.

Terrapin [John?] Part of the issue is self-dealing management, but a deeper
look into the history of the industry revealed a long string of restructurings
and financial gaming. Buffett said that when an industry with a reputation for
bad fundamentals meets a management with a reputation for superior performance,
it's the industry that retains it's reputation. He also said it's good to have

These guys are like Lynch wrote about. Took a coop public, selling shares to

What's the catalyst? Company just finished buying back shares, and I suspect
they'll buy back more.

Way off topic

Jim, I guess I still watch the charts a bit. After all, I cut my teeth trading
coffee futures. About 8 trading days ago it broke a significant downtrend on
decent volume when it moved to the high 40s. At the point, I wished I had
bought more in the low 40s. Today it just popped its 200 day, after trending
along it for a few days after trendline breakout. This all occurred in a
setting in which the years-long stock chart tested a years-long uptrend and the
support held. Maybe TA is only useful because others use it. I don't know. But
it's interesting to watch, and I believe in it to the degree it reflects crowd
psychology. Despite SLOT's volatility, I'd be surprised if it goes back to
sub-50 now.

And yes, I'm waiting for the 80's at least before I sell, no matter what the

Some -ve on SLOT:

Anchor Gaming hit a bump in 1997 and 1998, when it was hit with five lawsuits
brought by shareholders alleging that the company artificially inflated its
stock price so that insiders could sell off their holdings at a profit. (The
Fulton family reduced its ownership interests from 52% to 37% in late 1997.)
The lawsuits, however, did not hamper the company's introduction of new
machines. In 1998 the company introduced its CashBall, Keno Bucks, and Big
Bucks Bingo games and teamed with IGT to refurbish traditional slot machines.
The next year Anchor bought Powerhouse Technologies, a maker of video poker
machines.

Thanks, Allen, but don't forget that it still has the artificial selling from

I have a buying strategy slightly different
than yours -- add to an initial position bought at whatever price over time,
but only under $4. I want that extra margin of protection that I think that
price gives.

At this price level I could see an outside buyer going to GENZ and offering $9,
and buying the business for its cash. However, this is not an independent
company and GENZ would certainly not accept (as they surely do not think the
$100 million sales surgical products business is worthless, even if the
Seprafilm and biotherapeutics business is of questionable value) -- which I
guess has positive longer term implications for us at $4.

Maxwell Shoe (MAXS), in the tradition of Penobscot (PSO at 6) and Hyde (SCNYA

(MAXS) looks like a no-brainer. I don't know what it is about shoe companies,
but those two and Nike have been wonderful investments for me in what is
usually an awful business - except for Nike. If anybody can find anything wrong
with Maxwell, let me know. It is a net-net if you add to current assets the $25
million they are going to get from Jones NY. The company is profitable and has
been profitable consistently. And unlike the other garbage I find in net-net
land, this one trades. 427,000 shares today.

The net-net I was hinting about a month ago was Concord Fabrics (CIS) - that
one traded about every third day, and I was unable to buy even a few hundred
shares at my limit prices in the 4 5/8 range. It closed at 5 3/4 today. I had
limit orders on the stock for about two weeks at the middle of the spread and
the broker never filled them. Stupid in hindsight - this was a no-brainer value
I should have just paid 4 3/4 for. A number of you have been asking me
privately what the net-net I was referring to was - now you know. I do not own
it, and am not interested in buying it now. But net-net value is something like
$8.50 a share, so it may be attractive still. I am just so frustrated about
missing the no-risk 20% move that I am not going to chase it up.

OT re: futures position trading

No personal experience with this, but I do find it interesting and have read
about it, studied it a bit, and thought about it a lot.

Two points:

1 - Many contracts have a "cost of carry", in which later-dated contracts trade
at a premium to closer-dated contracts or the spot market. This frequently
represents the cost of storage and/or the interest costs that a corresponding
"physical" buy and hold transaction would cost. An annual 2% or 9% cost of
carry might not invalidate the ability to earn a profit through eventual
mean-reversion, however it is a cost you must factor into your analysis. Cost
of storage (and therefore carry cost of the futures contracts) is lower for
gold than say, wheat or oil.

2 - Even if mean reversion eventually occurs, it could take surprisingly long,
and the price might decline quite a bit more in the meantime (this might make
it difficult, psychologically, to stick with the trade). Two or three years ago
when copper fell to 80 or 75 cents, it was noted that this would be a good
entry point since that was below production cost. As far as I know (I haven't
traded it and therefore haven't followed it real closely) copper is still lower
than that today.

And I hear that 10, 15 or 20 years ago there was an absolute annihilation in
sugar. World sugar now trades at about 10 cents (I think that level is more or
less historically correct), however it did fall a while ago to under (??) 1
cent. I don't know if it would have been profitable to enter a mean-reversion
position trade, say, at for or five cents before this happened, and hold out
until a profit was reached. To say nothing of the psychological difficulty of
actually carrying through with something that we can see in hindsight to have
been a difficult though nonetheless eventually profitable (?) trade.

- Daniel

P.S. Gosh Mike B, you mention TA and look what happens to the thread... ;-)

P.P.S. to Mike B, glad to hear your futures tuition was so cheap. For me, every
single trade I made (Yen and CAD shorts) was profitable at some point, yet
every single trade was eventually closed out at a loss. My Yen short lost me
more money that any other trade I have ever made, including my
second-largest-ever loser, my SBUX short(!). To have been right (I still think)
and to have lost so much, I think that there is a lesson there trying to teach
itself to me... Hopefully I'll figure out the lesson -- the tuition was so
expensive!

Futures position trading w/o leverage. I think that is sound way to do it.
However, I think that buying the best managed copper company, for example, at a
cyclical low in the copper price is a better strategy
(but you can't do that with all commodities).

You will get a safe increase in the leverage with the leading stock. You have
no time limit on the correctness of your judgment. You do not have to pay for
any forward contract premium to the spot price.

Speaking of buying well-managed commodity companies at lows, I was struck
recently when I read that only 14% of investors were bullish on gold, and that
the prices had hit levels that hadn't been seen since 1979. So of course I
think "historic opportunity." Homestake Mining was brought up here by Paul I
think. They produce gold at a cost just under 200/ounce. Even at current levels
they are producing about breakeven results. A decent balance sheet - strong if
you compare to others. Evidently everybody's short gold. Well, here's hoping
for a squeeze. I just bought some Homestake at 7 5/8. Eegad, sold my Midway to

If price keeps dropping I'm thinking maybe some uses that were perhaps off
limits become feasible.

Thanks for any comments

Actually a good question Shane. I don't know of any meaningful uses for gold
besides jewelry. The only one I know of (now here is the dumb part) is
gold-lined permanent coffee filters instead of paper refills. Gold as a mineral
provides no biological benefit or harm. Hey that reminds me...there is
Goldschlager too! :-)

I'm sure there are other uses for gold...or is there? So gold is worth more
around ones neck or finger etc. than anywhere else. And if the demand for gold
jewelry in this era of massive consumption is not enough to help buoy the gold
industry, when will it ever?

I feel pretty lucky. I bought a put on INTC this morning. I was really just
looking for a general position to protect against a market downdraft, but a
company specific problem will do just nicely.

Seems to be quite a bit of debate on INTC's "other revenue" which is up

The Economist Magazine had a story a week (perhaps two weeks)
ago wherein they predicted declining earnings for all chip makers.
Primarily driven by two factors

1) the cost to provide a given computational ability (in MIPS:
millions of instructions per second) has and continues to decline.
(This has been the single constant throughout the history of computer
design: cost per MIP drops around 28%/year ... all the way back
to IBM 360 series.)
2) a re emergent asia .. more than willing and able to drive prices
down.

[GM struggles against Texas dealers' resistance to "DELL" model]

"Texas throws a wrench in GM's online plans"

By Kim Girard
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
July 7, 1999, 1:50 p.m. PT

Auto giant General Motor's plan to sell used cars and trucks in Houston via the
Web has hit a stop
sign.

As reported in this morning's Houston Chronicle, the Texas department of
transportation denied
Detroit-based GM's application for a license to sell used cars and trucks in
Texas. Regulators cited a new
law that strengthens a prohibition against manufacturers having an ownership
interest in local
dealerships.

The transportation department will give GM a chance to appeal the ruling,
though regulators say chances of
overturning the decision are slim, the paper reported.

For GM, the ruling will bar the opening of its first online-linked used-vehicle
store, which was planned
within the next two weeks, according to GM spokesman Donn Walker.

Through the new GM DriverSite program, consumers were supposed to be able to
search online from a
database of select used cars that are returned to GM dealers after leases
terminate. After picking a car,
potential buyers were to head to the Houston-based GM DriverSite store to
test-drive the car. DriverSite
is not related to GM BuyPower, the company's other online initiative for
marketing its new vehicles.

Houston was chosen as a test site for a planned national DriverSite program,
which GM intends to use to
help sell its used vehicles, Walker said. GM chose Houston because it has a
huge used-car market, and its
population is technologically savvy, he added.

Asked why GM didn't get regulatory approval before building the Houston store,
he said, "No one should
underestimate government bureaucracies, and how long it takes to get things
done." He continued,
"DriverSite was and hopefully still will be how we market and sell used cars."

"I am fairly confident that this will become a reality," he said.

GM officials did not comment on whether the company planned to appeal the
decision.

James McQuivey, analyst at Forrester Research said dealer franchise laws in
Texas are particularly
stringent. GM could face two choices: create a subsidiary that could sell the
used cars or set up a used
car superstore in which the automaker would hold a 49-percent stake, McQuivey
said.

"Basically GM could possibly rearchitect this thing so they're not the owner of
the used car dealership
themselves," McQuivey said.

He said other companies, including Hertz and Ford (at Fordpreowned.com), have
managed to set up online
sites to sell used cars. Ford, which is testing its program in four cities,
asks that customers pay $300
to order a vehicle, which is delivered to a nearby dealership, where a dealer
makes the sale and takes a
commission.

James, on gold, I think that there are still plenty of people who think it is
cheap because of prices that prevailed in the recent past - $800, $500, $300,
etc. How about prices that prevailed in the more distant past, like less than
$35 per ounce?

Absent another disastrous inflation episode like we had in the late 70's, gold
may well perform like any other commodity. If it does
and enough production is driven out of business permanently (bankrupt)
to balance supply, including central bank reserve selling, and demand, it might
be of interest as an investment vehicle to me. I suspect we are still pretty
far from that point.

I will admit that gold should carry some premium to its pure commodity value
for the small probability of a future inflation catastrophe
and the increased price it would have under those circumstances.

 Cause seems unrelated to effect on predicted decline in chip earnings. ... Am
I missing something here? 

IMO perhaps yes

Until we have a major technology insertion in the form of
very fast communications bandwidth ... e.g., fast cable across
the country or fiber , current cpu speeds are fast enough
(within PC's) for

a) anything coming in over the "wire"
b) all current sw applications

(not really all: flight sims (games)
and simulations could use more MIPs --
but they are hardly large markets.)

So there is no trading up ... (any of you need a 500 Mhertz CPU?)
and therefore future marketing efforts require expanding the base
-- selling existing and new products to new people

sell current products -- -- -- selling new products
to existing customers -- -- -- to existing customers
(easiest "cash cows") - -- -- (best growth position)

selling current products -- -- -- selling new products
to new found customers - -- -- to new customers
(mrk & sales cost more - -- -- the dreams of which IPO's are made

given that the market is saturated for existing customers
you must expand in the harder (more costly) new customer sectors.
-- where in the computer industry making money (in these
expansion sectors) requires a growth rate (historically) of
30+/yr merely to offset sales and manufacturing start up costs.)

Further (as Intel), you must do this with a product that costs
less each passing day and against a re emerging competition that
has neither the need nor the desire to make the same margins
required of you.

Further, you have history against you. No one has ever been
able to move their organizations as fast as the decline line
required. I give witness to the demise of Digital (DEC) and
the near demise of IBM (re branded as a service company)

And if the history of computing is insufficient. Consider the
advent of previous "civilization changing" technologies ..
airplanes, rail, autos .. and refer to the comments of no
less an authority than Buffett on their lessons and the
similarities to today.

Finally you have to fight against god (whatever that means) --
in the world of the future computers will always cost less
(CPU functions can be replicated today in protein molecules)
and bandwidth will be free.

Gold uses. Gold fillings. Used to see it on high rise building windows, as a
way to make the window reflect the sunlight out. Makes Venetian glass red. The
latter two are pretty minor uses, I am sure. There is such a massive hoard of
gold, in national banks, in hoards (especially in India, where even now the
gifts at weddings are largely gold items), and in collections (all those
Krugerrands, etc.) that it is hard to argue for much of a floor to pricing. I
think if I were to buy something as an inflation/catastrophe hedge, I would get
platinum or silver or high quality diamonds (just don't pay retail!!). Platinum
and silver are more heavily used in industry, and the overhang of supply is

I see a resurgent Asia as a plus for semiconductors, and declining costs per

horrible capital-intensive business to be in. Very poor for long-term investors
unless you've grabbed on to the biggest and baddest, whose capital and research
expenditures dwarf even the revenues of its nearest competitor. Peripheral
players in design (Xilinx, Altera) and patentable tech (Rambus) are the only

 and declining costs per MIPS as irrelevant. 

au contraire - as prices drop you gotta sell more to stay
even. sorta like the red queen in "through the looking glass"

All the harder if you gotta sell these more and more to

I am interested in an HMO, Pacificare. Bought FHP, which caused some digestion
probs and causes net income to underestimate substantial free cash flow. Gov't
and Commercial ratios are stable to improving, with the commercial ratio at the
same rate as 1995. Paying down debt. About 7X 1998's free cash flow. Net income
also artificially depressed by ultrahigh temporary tax rates. Looks to earn
6+/share this year, and 7+/share next year. CEO sold, but only a tiny fraction
of his shares, and at prices $30 north of here. Near lows, with a propensity to
move quickly. Risks are that it is huge in Medicare.

Unfortunately it is up a good amount today. If I were going to buy it
I would run a SI comparative chart on it and its peers. I spent a career in

Well, I went and bought it, got 63 1/8. I don't really care one way or another
about a few points. Even 3 is just over 5%. I did a comparison of 8 different
HMOs and came up with Pacificare as the best one as a value investment. Trigon
and Wellpoint also scored well, but Pacificare was the best value (with one of
the worst charts). Pacificare is more Medicare-dependent than most. I
especially like that it is solidly profitable and firmly in control of its
ratios despite a huge commercial exposure to California. I first bought and
sold Pacificare in 1992. I traded it from about 48 to 72 a year or two ago.
Looks like another good entry to me. And they have emerged as a leader. BTW, I
like the HMOs as an investment better than the hospitals, practice management
groups, and even practices. The insurers are the ones most firmly in control of
their numbers in a difficult environment. I think their information advantage
over just about everyone will stead them well. And reading through Pacificare's
10K tells me they are one of the best at keeping dibs on their stats.
Management has already said both the gov't and commercial ratios will be stable
over the next year. The commercial ratio is getting below 1995's level. A lot
of insurers just keep seeing that number rise.

BTW, I sold the last of my Oracle at 38 15/16 to buy the Pacificare at
63 1/8. Reason being too many people love Oracle now, and even a Morgan Stanley
dinner in Oracle's honor couldn't pump the stock any higher. 60% in 2 mos was a
steep climb. As for fellow climber Apple, a case can still be made that it's a
value stock IMO. A dip would be a buying opportunity. I'm still holding 60% of
that position.

I mentioned it over on the Buffettology thread, but I bought Reuters yesterday.
My reasoning is over there, and some might consider it a value stock. It did
jump today though.

Is anyone else still in Tidewater? That one looks ready to rumble. It's already
been rocking the boat a bit, now over 32. I really should have just put my
whole portfolio in that one at 17. Timberland's another one, up 12+ today.

Some possible investments in Taiwan

Hi, Count de Monie:

Here are some possible investments for your consideration:

1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM, an ADR listed on the NYSE) is the
largest semiconductor company in Taiwan and the largest company in terms of
market capitalization of issues listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

2. Macronix Electronics (MXICY, an ADR listed on the Nasdaq)

3. The ROC Fund (ROC, a closed end fund listed on the NYSE)

4. Trend Micro (TMIC) a Taiwanese company, worldwide leader in anti-virus
software, just migrated from Japan to the U.S. Nasdaq market.

I hope that the above will start your investigations.

I am not really familiar with the products of either company. I have owned ALSC
for awhile now and I like the fact that I now know that at least two of the
company's investments have done extremely well. Even if ALSC's products turn
out to be complete failures, the company is undervalued based upon its
investments. Alsc currently owns 500,00 share of Broadcom, which it received
when another company they made a small investment in was purchased by Broadcom.
My understanding is that the company is moving away from commodity type chips
towards proprietary communication type chips, which those technologically less
challenged than I feel have merit. The last time I ran the numbers I came up
with $18-$20 of book before taking into account taxes to be paid on the gains,
but this was before the price of UMC dropped about 14%.

The only thing I really know about SIII is that there new CEO came from Maxwell
where he did an excellent job at boosting the share price. I am unfamiliar with
the company and its competitors so I am sticking with ALSC which I know better,
as I would not own both anyway. I am not suggesting that ALSC IS a better
investment than DIMD and I wish you much success with your purchase.

Yes, I briefly looked at Stewart. I chose CTZ because I fell for the received

which will happen because business will fall off as interest rates increase
and/or the housing boom ends. I figured there might be some protection because
of CTZ's relatively high dividend. I also looked at FAF which is (or was) a big
holding by Marty Whitman's fund. The Barron's investor likes STC because it is
more a pure play in title insurance. I like CTZ because it is actually becoming
more like FAF - diversified in home warranty, etc.

Allen: FWIW, I also looked at the other companies mentioned. I think those
insurance companies are too expensive now to initiate a buy position (although
I'm no expert of course). Only company/stock I like is Gleason (GLE), but it
was mentioned in two separate Barron's articles, so there's a Monday morning
pop to the stock. I'll put GLE on my watch list. Paul.

Chained GDP

Here's a couple of posts on the GDP measurement changes that were made in 1995
that account for a lot the favorable numbers that the government is "making up"
these days. At a minimum we can be sure that current U.S. economic statistics
are not anywhere near comparable to past data or data supplied by other
nations. The 'new era' is mostly a new statistical adjustment.

Any opinions on DPH (Delphi Automotive)?

GM spun it off a few months ago.

It's my recollection that big spinoffs like this generally outperform the
market, although I don't have an article that I can cite right now.

The forward p/e based on 1999 estimates is about 10 or 11. For comparison,
Market Guide shows that the industry average p/e for trailing 12 mos is 18.

And, of course, it is big, with a market cap of $11 B.

Large stock. More and more players in this industry. I don't think it will move
as much as the smaller stocks. Take a look at SWW. Very interesting chart
pattern.

Paul, GRO had an interesting day today. Up 1/2 on good volume. Has everyone
looked at the insider buying on this one? Chart looks good. I may have to take
a small position tomorrow. Thanks again Paul for bringing to attention

Just a coincident?

Hi, Paul:

It is perhaps just a coincident that CTZ, FAF and STC are three of the
eighteen stocks produced by my computerized weekly stock screen which
combines the factors of growth, value and momentum -- using a data
base of more than 11000 securities. If anyone would like like to see a
list of the other fifteen stocks, just drop me a note. Thanks!

I am not really very knowledgeable about the company (DPH). My partner owns
some shares that he purchased at the IPO upon the suggestion of an engineer
that works at Delphi.

They are a very large employer in Rochester, NY and seem to be doing well, no
layoffs etc. Also, the engineer seems to think that there is a lot of world
wide business that is now attainable that wasn't before the spin off.

Sorry I'm not much more help.

Yours, etc.

Well, GIBG blew up today, and I breathed a sigh of relief that I had the good
sense to trade it for a nice short term gain in May - they should all work out
that well!! Posted my sell via PM to the only one on the thread who, it
appeared to me, was foolish enough to have interest! <vbg>
They made a pre-announcement of a huge loss, much larger than anticipated,
which doesn't bode well for the company's business position.
Nonetheless, Mr. Lebow still has a substantial position as far as a I know, and
the man at the Turnaround Letter put it on his radar screen in the spring.
I am again looking at this falling knife, but with a great deal of caution.
Comments anyone?

GM Reports Record Earnings

Tuesday July 20 8:36 AM ET

DETROIT (AP) - General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM - news), benefitting
from increased sales of light trucks in the hot North American
market, said today that it posted a record $1.7 billion operating
profit in the second quarter - a more than five-fold increase over
strike-depressed earnings a year ago.

The world's No. 1 automaker earned $2.66 a share, compared with $306
million, or 40 cents a share, for the April-through-June period of
1998 after excluding earnings from GM's former parts unit, Delphi
Automotive Systems. Delphi was made independent from GM in May.

Sales totaled $45.1 billion, compared with adjusted revenue of $37.3
billion a year ago.

GM's earnings exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations. The average
estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. was $2.56 a
share.

As was the case with Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F - news), which reported
strong North American results last week, GM earned the bulk of its
profit from strong sales in the United States.

''In one of the most intensely competitive markets in recent history,
our North American automotive operations took advantage of the strong
demand and recorded net income of $1.5 billion, despite the extremely
tough pricing environment in this key region,'' Chairman Jack Smith
said.

GM also showed improvement in Europe, where operating earnings of $187
million represented a 51 percent improvement over the $124 million
earned a year ago. GM credited strong sales of its new Opel and
Vauxhall Zafira minivan and redesigned Opel Astra subcompact.

Elsewhere, GM lost money.

In the Asia-Pacific region, GM's red ink totaled $81 million, compared
with a $36 million loss in the same period of 1998. In Latin America,
Africa and the Mideast, GM lost $38 million, compared with a $48
million profit a year ago.

For the first half of the year, GM's worldwide operating earnings
totaled nearly $4 billion, or $5.33 a share, double the $2 billion, or
$2.33 a share, in the first half of 1998. Revenue totaled $87.5
billion, up 13 percent from $77.3 billion a year ago.

GM's earnings in the second quarter of 1998 were affected by strikes
at two parts plants in Flint, Mich., which cost the company an
estimated $890 million, or $1.32 a share, after taxes.   

My previously stated view of greeting card stocks has not changed -- AVOID!

As Peter Lynch has said look around you for investment ideas (to buy).
He could also have said to look around you for ones to sell. Example, we just
celebrated my inlaws wedding anniversary. We provided one card purchased in the
store and 2 prepared by my teenagers over the computer. In the past, the kids
would have given one store bought card together. Decline in card purchases for
this event = 50%, combined with an increase in end user satisfaction - 3 cards
versus 2. This is a dreadful combination for the industry.
