IAR has a new captain (slightly off topic because not value investing -g-)

http://biz.yahoo.com/e/080602/iar8-k.html

he receives a nice sign up bonus and other goodies on entering this floating
coffin.
The vast sums thrown at Mr. Klein clearly show how risky this venture is; begs
the question for how many months the employment agreement is designed...

Under the agreement, Mr. Klein's annual <u>base salary will be no less than
$1,000,000 and he will be eligible to earn a target annual short-term incentive
award of no less than 100% of his base salary. For 2008, Mr. Klein is
guaranteed a minimum short-term incentive award of $500,000 and received a
one-time cash award of $400,000 upon joining the Company. </u>
Under his agreement, Mr. Klein is entitled to a target annual long-term
incentive award opportunity of no less than 300% of his base salary. For 2008,
his long-term incentive award will be in the form of performance share units
(70%) and restricted stock (30%), prorated based upon his number of months of
service with the Company during 2008.
Mr. Klein will also receive stock options to purchase 250,000 shares of the
Company's common stock. The stock options will have a per-share exercise price
equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on June 2, 2008, the
first trading day of the month following Mr. Klein joining the Company.

COl & GR i have both been watching. COL is an airline supplier with substantial
defense business - a similar situation than GR. COL looks relatively cheap but
the potential troubles with the airline business loom large. i cannot help but
think that 130$ crude means bad things for the airline sector and a disruption
similar to 9/11/2001 with the difference that we have a slow motion crash.

COL is a nice business, with relatively little Capex, nice ROE and a good
management. It's a GARP price stock but i am worried that the growth part of
the story is going to be a problem, so i am passing.

That said, i own quite a bit of RR.L (Rolls Royce) in the same business. I
think the aircraft engines are probably a larger moat than COL electronics and
it also has more gearing towards fuel savings. Also RR does have a turbine as
well as a ship engine business which are growing nicely.

It is a conglomerate, so it is tough to see whether its various businesses will

Like old ex-girlfriends who surprise you occasionally by coming back into your

Aircraft fuel supplier INT has dropped to where its price/sales ratio is .04.
Which is very low imo.

After an absence of several years, I'll start up a few shares again. For INT,
stated bv has increased every year since '99. Cash exceeds ltd (Yahoo numbers).

INT provides fuel services to the aircraft, marine, and ground transportation
sector. Primarily though to aircraft.
Possible that with announcement of major carriers cutting back routes and
flights, that there will be less demand for INT's refueling services. OTOH, imo
INT excels at supplying 2nd (and 3rd) tier airlines with fuel, and these
companies will still be flying as much as possible. INT's competitive strength
is that it is able to assess the payment ability of these carriers and cater to
them ("Our services range from fuel supply, credit and fuel-price risk
management services to ground handling arrangements, overflight and landing
permits, flight planning and weather information." ) Such proper assessment is
important because several of these lower tier carriers seem to go bk each year.

whether they get a ruling from Revenue Canada or not.. Only reason she might
consider delaying it by a week or two is if they get a definite date for
Revenue Canada ruling but she does not particularly worry about that..

She also thought that the exploration portion with Ghana might trade around .40
or so but could be sold off by people who don't care about that end of the
business although 1m share of DGC there will give some support.. They
definitely have high hopes for Ghana and as the drilling progresses, they

Buckingham Research sees Higher GM Cash Burn, Risk To Dividend.

Buckingham Research Analyst Joseph Amaturo cut his stock price target to $10
from $13, and reiterated his underperform rating, saying production declines
are likely to widen loss expectations and accelerate the drain on liquidity.

GM's stock, a component of the Dow industrials, shed 0.6% to $16.02, and has
now lost 31% since the end of April. It hit a low of $15.76 earlier in the
session, the lowest price seen since August 1982.

Amaturo said he now expects a 2008 loss of $6.53 a share and a 2009 loss of
$7.73 a share, wider than his previous forecasts of a 2008 loss of $4.57 a
share and a 2009 loss of $6.14 a share.

He also said the automaker's cash and equivalents balance is expected to fall
below $20 billion by the end of the second quarter, and raised his 2009 cash
burn projection to $17 billion from $14 billion.

"We believe it is becoming evermore likely that GM's current cash dividend
could be eliminated or cut as the company likely has to raise capital to remain
solvent beyond 2008," Amaturo said in a research note. "We believe management
could raise capital as much as $7 billion to $10 billion, which will result in
significant dilution for the current equity holder, in our opinion."

Separately, Credit Suisse Analyst Chistopher Ceraso said GM's third-quarter
production schedule appears to be "way to aggressive," and could leave trucks
about 50% overstocked at the end of September.

GM missed a golden opportunity to raise cash when Captain Kirk Kerkorian
temporarily lost his mind attempting to be a "white Knight" in rescuing GM (see
What is GM worth?, July 2006). GM managed to hit $37 when that love affair was
on and more amazingly approached $42 after Captain Kirk bailed.

GM could have raise money at $40, $35, $30, $25, or $20. This is a slow replay
of Ambac (ABK) that had uncountable chances to raise money at $80, $70, $60,
$50 etc, but now sits at $2.14 on its way to zero.

Some might argue that I am making this seem easier than it is. Not really.
Credit conditions were extremely easy a year ago. The opportunity was there,
then. Now, is another matter. Right now it is costing Citigroup and Lehman 9%+
to raise cash. Perhaps it would cost GM 15% or more.

Furthermore, I do not think Citigroup goes bankrupt. It could, but I think the
Fed would force it to be busted into pieces or taken over first. All
bondholders care about is if they get paid back. They do not care one iota if
the share price plunges 90% or more as Bear Stearns did from the top. On the
other hand, GM is far less likely to survive. One should expect its bonds to be
priced accordingly.

The most interesting thing about GM is the fact that there is $1 trillion in
credit default swaps speculating on the demise or lack thereof of this dog. To
put things into perspective, the market cap of GM is $9 Billion and over $1
trillion is bet on whether or not it survives. Anyone who tells me these bets
are hedged, please tell me how. There is not enough stock or bonds to hedge
with. By the way, that $1T figure is over a year old. Anyone with a more
current number, please send it my way.

Assuming Buckingham Research is correct about GM's cash burn rate, GM will be
out of cash in 18 months. However, please remember that GM is a company that
has had 27 lives. I thought it would go bankrupt six years ago. Yet, somehow it
has repeatedly been able to go back to the bond markets and raise cash. That is
the only reason why it exists today. The difference this time is that GM blew a
golden opportunity to raise cash a year ago or so. It also blew a golden
opportunity to unload GMAC and Ditech.

With credit conditions being what they are now, I suspect GM will delay raising
capital. This will be another mistake in a long series of serious mistakes at
GM. Credit conditions will likely be worse a year from now, just as GM will be
down to its last few billion. This means it's increasingly likely that GM has
made its last fatal mistake. And with all those swaps, someone has to be on the
losing end of a huge bet, regardless of what happens.

I spent a little time looking at these companies. It appears that BP and TOT
have >70% of sales in refining. E has ~40%. OXY is pure (?) E&P company. So I
guess BP/TOT investing would assume a recovery or at least not a total collapse
of refining. Not necessarily a bet I want to make beyond my current "refining"
holdings (I already have some COP, TOT, E). So, so far I think OXY is most
attractive of this bunch. I want to look a bit more at SSL, PTR and maybe even

Bought back some BMY below $20. I previously sold it in 4/07 at $32. Looking to
collect the 6% dividend if it holds. This is in the IRA account, so the high
dividend income is important. There was some small insider buying recently (in
May 2008) at prices between $21-$22.

Peeled off some shares of CMCSA.

Excluding the mutual fund component, my IRA has 22 different stocks and 2 bonds
(U.S Treasury strips). It is weighted pretty heavy with Oil, NG and energy
infrastructure stocks. The sector break down is as follows: 20% Integrated Oil
& Oil Services, 14% drug & Health Care companies, 12% energy pipeline &
distribution, 10% conglomerate & technology, 9% diversified utility, 9% US
Treasury Strips, 8% financials, 7% shipping (oil tankers), 5% REIT (land &
office buildings), 4% media (TV & radio) and 2% Automotive.

The heavy energy component has helped the portfolio value appreciation and the
drug company component has generated good dividend income. I think BMY below
$20 is a good addition to the mix.

Large integrated oils don't seem to have moved much given that we have seen
such large increases in oil prices and so many new highs in e&p companies.
Perhaps that's due to the refinery operations of these integrateds and perhaps
somewhat because they may've been too slow in deploying assets into
exploration. They are so big there's the argument that they cannot replenish
their proved/probable reserves. (Too much nationalism/expropriation now where
the big fields are and where the integrateds have historically wanted to
operate)

I am hoping that that is already all reflected in the stock prices, and that
given current valuations compared to previous years, the stocks will eventually
see a rise.

OTOH, for me, this is only one subsector of the oil/gas/related area in which I
hold positions and not where I am making my largest bets or most current bets.

Paul,

I agree with you. IMHO, most of large oils seem cheaper mostly because of the
large refining segment that is not really contributing much to profits so far +
lousy replacement rates. On the other hand, most of the smaller E&P companies
seem to be either fully valued or speculative or both. That's why I am somewhat
careful about putting new money in energy sector. I don't think we are in
energy bubble, but I do think that valuations are not fantastically attractive.
It might be true that refining for (super)majors will improve. It might be true
that (most) speculative small plays will become viable companies. But the risk
right now is IMHO higher than what we had even at the beginning of this year.
For most companies at least.

That said, I will probably buy some things in energy space still. After looking
more today, OXY, SSL and E remain on my possible buy list of larger companies.

E_K_S, I think we talked about pharmas before. I am really conflicted about
this sector. On one hand, I still think there are a lot of things to be
improved in global drug/medicine market. So I would want to participate.
Perhaps even feel well on the social side of investing in medicine for people.

On the other hand, it seems that the patent-protected side of the business is
flat or declining with unclear long term consequences for the large pharmas. I
looked at FRX, which showed up as a possible attractive play, and it's the same
story as other pharmas: patent expirations with unclear drug replacement. Sure,
you are getting dividends, but what if the stocks continue declining as the
drugs are not replaced?

My play now is the China pharma distributors and minors (AOB, CHME, LTUS). Not
that they are good replacement for drug majors, but there at least I see growth
that may be sustainable for couple years at least. There are issues though like
very huge receivables and up to 12-month bill collection times + some dubious

Because as a short you are always "on margin" unless you invest like 50% of
your available capital. 10-20% swing in a wrong direction and you have a margin
call. What do you do then? Good if you're a nimble trader, but if not, you're
screwed really really fast. You may be screwed even if ultimately you are
right. And by the way there were a lot of people screwed shorting tech in the
bubble and then housing in the bubble. Even Mike Burry had to limit withdrawals
from his hedge fund when his short positions were all under water. So he won,
but another year or so and he would have been history.

For longs this is not true. You can hold most of the companies forever and they
will recover if they were sound businesses. So, sure there are examples of
overvalued and phony companies that will never recover, but your opportunity
lies in years and years of possible compound growth. For short this is not
true.

And by the way, I do not share your doom and gloom on US banks. But you are
welcome to short them if you like. I see such a proliferation of shorting gloom
and doomers that in some cases their shorting becomes a self fulfilling
prophecy, but they are also becoming more and more cavalier as were longs in

Yes, I am never on margin and I would not suggest using margin to anyone.

"Whether you accept my hypothesis about banks or not , it looks like you can

them cheaper on Monday"

It does not matter. You cannot buy stocks at absolute bottom or sell at
absolute top. The thing that matters is that longs investing in strong
businesses build to survive do not care about the temporary swings up and down.
Actually they welcome such swings to add to their positions. Shorts? As you say
yourself, if you don't time your short, you are toast. And you need to time it
in months or days and not in years as longs.

Show me consistent gains by shorting for 10 years or so and then I will believe
it is valid investment approach. What the heck, show me ANYONE who made gains
shorting for 10 years and I will change my mind. Situational shorters like Mike
Burry and Whitney Tilson do not really count, since 1 good guess does not a

"I dont know how anyone can look at the banks and say they are great
investments when its all so murkey."

I agree that they are murkey and that it's tough to know how much they are
worth. It is also true that anything with significant debt load can go BK. One
approach would be never to buy companies that have to rely on overleveraged
balance sheets or high liabilities to operate. That would exclude banks,
insurance companies, BDCs, most housing stocks. Still leaves a lot of companies
to invest into. ;) There are tons of companies with clean balance sheets and
cash on hands (not invested into some murky CDOs).

But on the same vein, if longs don't know what banks are worth, the shorters
don't know it either. The rescues and turnarounds can be swift and brutal.

"I dont know what they are worth and I doubt anyone else does."

Buffett thinks to know what they are worth on the long side - he is still
buying WFC and USB. Some shorters think that they know what banks are worth on
the short side. I would go with Buffett. ;) This is somewhat faith-based
investing, so I will never go over ~10% of portfolio in this area. And I won't
claim to have a very deep insight into the banks.

M&T sell-off would boost AIB position, say analysts June 21, 2008
By Joe Brennan / Irish Independent

Allied Irish Banks (AIB) could boost its capital position and prompt the market
to re-rate its stock, if it sold off its 24 % stake in its American associate
M&T Bank, according to analysts at NCB Stockbrokers.

In a 20-page study on AIB, the brokerage said the sale of the M&T holding at
current prices would generate €1.35bn. "A sale of its M&T stake at current
prices would boost forecast [core tier one capital ratios by 0.5 percentage
points] to 6.2pc, while diluting earnings by just 4pc," said NCB analysts John
Cantwell and Ciaran Callaghan.

Banks' core tier one capital ratios, a key measure of their financial
stability, have been a major concern among investors in recent times. A raft of
UK lenders, including Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Bradford & Bingley, have
had to launch equity fundraisings, as the credit crunch continues erode balance
sheets across the sector.

Unemployment

Irish banks have largely avoided US subprime-induced writedowns. But analysts
see them incurring massive bad loan impairment charges over the coming years,
amid the declining property market and rising unemployment.

NCB expects AIB's loan loss impairment charge to increase from 0.9pc, or €106m,
of loans in 2007, to 3.0 pc (€393m) this year and 4.5pc (€693m) in 2009.

"However, we believe there is a risk that loan impairment could be higher than
expected, should the Irish and UK economies continue to deteriorate or the cost
of credit continues to rise," the analysts said.

They added: "AIB has indicated its interest in M&T is considered non-core [to
the group] and discussed the capital impact of a sale at its results
presentation in February 2008."

The analysts suggested US market guru Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
investment fund may be interested in the stake, given that it holds a further
6pc of M&T.

A sale of the M&T stake for €1.35bn would require AIB to book a loss of about
€50m, given that AIB has the holding valued at €1.4bn on its books.

However, at the time of AIB's annual results in February, finance director John
O'Donnell said the group would be able to write back €900m in goodwill that it
deducted at the time it acquired the M&T stake in 2003.

This writeback would boost AIB's core tier one equity from 5.7pc to 6.2pc, said
NCB.

AIB is less likely to dispose its 70pc stake in Polish bank Bank Zachodni WBK,
it said, even though its 8pc share of that fast-growing market "would represent
an attractive asset to one of the large international banks vying for a
position in that market."

Citi's analyst commented positively on the stock merger this morning. The
investor presentation made a strong case for the merger and pointed out the
differences from the previous leveraged buy-outs in the industry.

Citi analyst says, "RSG Weakness Presents Opportunity " Since news of Republic
Services and Allied Waste s merger agreement leaked a week ago Friday both
stocks have reacted negatively, with RSG down roughly 8% and AW down 11%. With
the formal announcement and greater color that came out yesterday on the
follow-up conference call, we believe several investor concerns were addressed,
and we remain confident that the transaction will create significant value over
time. Thus, although we have seen some investor base churn that may continue
over the short term, we remain buyers of RSG on current weakness and,
consequently, of Allied."

Hi Paul - Hedged a small portion of my ELP shares that are in my IRA by writing
Jan 2009 $20 covered calls for $2.50. The company is near an all time high and
has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. The recent break out in the stock
price is on better than average volume which is bullish.

ce=undefined

The company pays an annual dividend each April, so by selling a few covered
calls, I protect a portion of my 33% gain YTD. The $2.50 call price is a 12.5%
premium to the current price.

Brazil has recently raised their interest rates while the FED has left rates
unchanged. I suspect the $/Real will continue to remain weak for the
foreseeable future but once U.S. rates start to increase, it may impact the
relative share price due to lower foreign currency gains.

It looks like COSAN (CZZ) is now finding it profitable to export their ethanol

DJ Ethanol Dominates Brazil Sugar Market This Week

SAO PAULO (Dow Jones)--Ethanol is the talk of the town in Brazil's sugarcane
business market this week, with export prices continuing to rise on U.S.
demand, brokers said.

A few weeks ago, one could buy Brazilian anhydrous ethanol, a gasoline mixture,
for around $480 per 1,000 liters. On Wednesday, those prices were averaging
around $550 per 1,000 liters, "with many traders and end-users willing to pay
even more," said a broker at Terra Futuros.

On Wednesday, Brazil's largest ethanol company, Cosan (CZZ), together with
NovAmerica, Grupo Guarani and Alcoeste, announced a deal with Swedish ethanol
company SEKAB, to import 115 million liters between June and March 2009. No
value was put on the contract because the price of the ethanol will vary from
month to month.

"A couple of weeks ago, everyone was calling for price references, but now they
are calling to close orders," said Tarcilo Rodrigues, director of Bioagencia,
an ethanol brokerage firm.

Rodrigues said that the biggest buyers were trading companies like Morgan
Stanley Capital Partners, Valero (VLO), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) unit Shell Oil
U.S. and Chevron (CVX).

"The list is long and getting longer all the time," Rodrigues said.

High corn ethanol prices have put corn ethanol producers at break-even profit
margins, or worse. Recent flooding in the mid-west has made it impossible for
ethanol to be shipped out of the region by truck to the coastal U.S.

With heated export demand, ethanol remains a winner when it comes to deciding
whether to produce sugar or ethanol at the mills as the harvest keeps coming in
this week.

Sugar prices were 11.48 cents per pound for the July contract on the ICE
Futures U.S. exchange, still far from the 14.50 to 15 cents per pound parity
between sugar and ethanol, according to Archer Consulting. At those prices,
sugar, too, becomes profitable for many mills who are facing heavy debt burdens
due to big expansion moves in 2006 and 2007 followed by falling sugar prices.

The sugar market has picked up these days, too, however. Demand is back from
Russia and the Middle East, and raw sugar prices are now trading at premiums
instead of discounts.

Freight costs also fell, making it easier for importers to pay for the merchant
marine vessels to make the trans-Atlantic shipments to Black Sea and Middle
Eastern ports.

"One of the reasons freight costs have fallen is because Argentina's ports are
basically closed, so there are more vessels available. That's helped attract
buyers, too," said Guilherme Correa, a trader at sugar exporter Coimex.

Correa said premiums for September sugar deliveries were 10 points over the
July raw sugar contract on the ICE. A few weeks ago, sugar was priced as steep
discounts of nearly 100 points.

According to a Sao Paulo broker, export premiums out of Santos for July and
August shipments were 10 over the July raw sugar contract on the ICE and 15
over July for September shipments of Brazilian raw sugar, or VHP.

Arnaldo Correia, a consultant at Archer Consulting, told a group of sugar
brokers at the Brazil Commodities & Futures Exchange Agrobusiness Scenarios
meeting in Sao Paulo on Tuesday that the firm sees sugar futures hitting 17
cents per pound this year for 2009 contracts, making it easier for sugar
milling companies in Brazil to invest in expansion.

"When you look at the prices today, it's only a 20% increase, and that's not
that extraordinary," he said.

Carlos Mello, commercial director for Cosan, said 17 cents is doable; maybe not
this year, but certainly next.

"Seventeen is the magic number for sugarcane companies to start investing. By
2009-2010, the world sugar market will enter into a deficit, so our logic is
that prices will hit 17 cents by next year," Mello said.

Brazil is the world's leading producer and exporter of sugarcane products.

CZZ is an interesting situation. On one hand, the company is arguably cheap.
There is a possibility of the further increases in ethanol sales and profits.
On the other hand, sugar sales are in the dumps and company is losing money on
every ton sold. This may or may not turn around. I am not sure that all sugar
production can be converted into ethanol production for higher profits. From
what I read, I don't think this is easily possible.

The past history and PE is very misleading, since company has losses YTD 2008.
It also had losses in 2006, so 2007 is the only year with positive income.
There is also some distortion due to sugar price hedging using futures (the
hedge resulted in 2008 losses).

Also I am not sure if CZZs purchase of XOM distribution operations in Brazil is
positive. I have looked at distribution and refining margins globally (just to
compare with the current refiner fall in USA) and it's not much better
anywhere. Companies like PBR have substantial sales in distribution area and
very low profits.

Overall, I decided that I am not interested in CZZ here. I may be totally wrong
if sugar prices follow the increases of other agro commodities or if CZZ gets
great price and sales for ethanol.

Hi Jurgis - I would have to agree with you. Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR) may be a
more conservative play for ethanol & biofuel production than CZZ.

PBR is researching the economics of a large-scale cellulosic ethanol plant and
stated they could be in operation in three to five years. In Brazil, the
feedstock would be sugarcane bagasse, a residue from ethanol and sugar
production, as well as other parts of the sugar cane plant.

PBR announced yesterday that they will complete its first of two ethanol-only
pipelines and first ethanol mill in 2009. They also plan to build a second
pipeline between the center-west state of Mato Grosso do Sul and Paranagua
port, in the southern state of Parana.

The pipelines aim to improve efficiency and reduce producers' costs in
transporting ethanol to the ports from Brazil's countryside.

I have added to PBR recently as they have the best overall growth opportunities
for oil, NG & biofuel(s) development & distribution (w/ company owned
pipelines). You do pay a premium for this at 19x PE when you can buy other
integrated oils for 10-12 PE.

The most recent McDep report (May 2008) values PBR at a 11% discount to its
current price of $67.50/share.

http://www.mcdep.com/pbr80522.pdf

The McDep summary report still shows the other major integrated oils selling at
a 20% to their NPV. I tend to use their McDep ratio as a gauge to measure
"realative" value.

Buffett was still accumulating IR recently in addition to what he received in

Posted recently on Big Dog's thread by well-respected (well-respected by me

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=24704260

Good dividend yield, apparently to be increased over time; long-lived assets
also, I am led to believe. Negatives include attack on oil sands as significant
polluter by USA politicians/environmentalists; possible Canadian tax changes to
trusts; and possibly some future limitations on how much of the trust the
management will allow non-Canadians to hold.

I have been a holder of COSWF.pk for a few years. Have been adding shares
recently (including today). I am betting the stock should move up if/as other
oil producer stocks increase. If stock doesn't move, but oil prices remain
high, I am assuming somebody (if not USA) will buy company's production
(assuming Canadian authorities continue to allow oil sands production), and
that consequently company profits and company dividend will increase. That
should be satisfactory for me.

Bwdik. I'm also buying GE today. And am in a losing position on those bdc's you
are buying now.

IR - For what it is worth, IR is right at a 5-year support trend line. Critical
if it stays at support or breaks down from here. We will all know in the
fullness of time.

Upped my small position in HD. Stock seems attractive below $25 but there still
seems to be more sellers than buyers at this level. I am hoping that as the
3qtr begins next week, there will be some large institutional "value" buyers
that will find this stock attractive. The stock yields 3.6% which is better
than my money fund.

I am waiting for those rebate checks to get spent and some of that money ($106
Billion) should find its way to HD.

HD does look pretty attractive at 24.66. One of the directors other than
Batchelder bought 10000 shares on June 19 for 26.64. There are several that
look better than they did in early May. Couple of directors (other than CEO
Immelt) buying GE too at prices higher than today's close.

I'm kind of gun-shy at the moment, especially after getting faked out for the
second time on nuclear sector. Still like the fundamentals there, but I've now
seen two false breakouts.

Lazarus, I looked at insurer UVE and will pass. I don't understand how it does
so well, so I'm suspicious of the numbers. Also, with their business being one
of the top five insurers of Florida homes, and going into the hurricane season,
I'm not comfortable with holding shares.

That said, I do hold a somewhat similar, http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TCHC .
Only a few shares for a tracking position. It has not been a good performer for
me.
-----------------------------------
So many insurance companies are beat down now. Maybe it's because of their bond
holdings, the competition in property and casualty, the economy in general, or
their exposure direct or indirect to the huge problem of flooding in the
midwest.

I expect the bigger names to eventually come off their lows which I am hoping
aren't much below current levels. I have initiated very small buys now of
Travelers and Horace Mann while maintaining positions in others (Allstate,
Chubb, Hartford, and others in life and specialty.)

Hi anialzer - Peeled off some of my material and mining shares (BHP & AAUK) and
moved the money into domestic REITs (BDN & HRP). These REITs are selling below
BV and have good FFO that more than cover their debt obligation.

Hate to sell any of the mining, natural resource or oil shares as they seem to
be the only things that are working now. However it is import to take some
profits from time to time and rebalance the portfolio. My mining stocks
represent almost 20% of the portfolio and this move represents only a 1% change
in this sector position.

I noticed you also like the shipping sector as do I. 12% of my portfolio is
made up of dry bulk and rail shipping companies. I am thinking of peeling off a
few shares there too. They have all benefited from the movement of commodities
around the world. I wonder if this growth can be sustained in a global
inflationary environment?

Have you done any rebalancing and do you still prefer your foreign sector
weighting? Based on your 10/14/07 posting you were in many of the right
sectors. Your heavy foreign weighting has probably paid off in spades.

Yes, I saw such low numbers for PBR. Going to be very profitable for PBR, I
expect.

I wouldn't sell PBR to buy oil sands or sell oil sands to buy PBR. (I have
both.). Issue for PBR is when (what year) will the oil come up and in what
volumes. PBR seems constrained in that there are not a lot of deep water rigs
and other infrastructure right now. Whereas with some of the oil sands
producers, they are already up and running and increasing production.
