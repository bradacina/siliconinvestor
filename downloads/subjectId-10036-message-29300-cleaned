AYR. First time I've come across a Passive Foreign Investment Company (a
"PFIC") for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. I'll have to check with my tax
guy as to what I will do. If it's a mandatory bunch of paperwork and as complex
as limited partnership rigmarole, I'm not going to like it. Might be worth it
though for the potential and opportunity these stocks I hope provide.

I don't believe I'll care about whether the dividend is qualified or not. I'm
likely to have to pay the amt, and so I'm not going to get the "benefit" of the
low 15% tax rate.

OT (maybe): I used to consider American cars to be junk compared to imports.
Recently I read in AAA magazine that they think that the quality differential
of American cars to imports has narrowed. Do you see this to be the case? I.e.
have American cars become better compared to imports recently?

OTOH, I think that the next car I want to buy is a hybrid and for that Toyota
seem to be the frontrunner. Probably, Prius. Although I am

From:SI Bob
OT (somewhat): I worked as a mechanic in an Import repair shop in the mid to
late 80's and once refused to work on a particular car that came in because it
was American, a particularly bad example of an American car, and my toolchest
was metric-only. I called the car "junk".

I'll never forget what my boss said to me. "They're all junk, Bob. Foreign and
domestic. That's why you and I have jobs."

His point being that no matter how good a car is, it's an imperfect machine. To
someone like me who really has intimate knowledge of how an internal combustion
engine works, it's a minor miracle that they work at all, and mind-boggling
that so many of them work so reliably.

Regarding whether or not I think the American manufacturers have narrowed the
quality gap since the 80's, most definitely! There's still a gap, but it's more
of a crack where it used to be an abyss.

Unfortunately, some (but only a very small part) of this narrowing is because
so many "foreign" cars are made in the US now. To cite an example from personal
experience, I used to own a 2003 Honda Gold Wing motorcycle and it nearly
became two unicycles because of defective frame welds. It spent 4 months in the
shop during prime riding season because it had to not only go back to the
factory to be re-assembled on a new frame, but make its way through a morass of
paperwork and coordination that likely wouldn't have happened in Japan.

Regarding hybrids, I own a pair of them (Honda Civic and Toyota Camry) mostly
because I'm so fascinated with the technology. I'm somewhat of a tree-hugger,
but that's not why I bought these cars. I just think they're really cool. And
it's like a video game trying to get the best MPG out of them each time I drive
them. Setting a new "high score". Best I've done so far is 55 mpg in 40 miles
in the Camry.

There are a host of reasons to avoid them, though, a few of which are:

1. The technology itself only yields marginal improvements in economy. You have
to drive them very differently from gas-only cars to get the best efficiency
out of them.

2. None are plug-in yet. The cost of charging the electric motor's batteries
would be MUCH lower from the grid than it is using the gas engine and regen
braking (which is just another way of using the gas engine -- recapturing some
of the energy the fuel created).

3. It's nothing short of insanity, IMO, that these things use gasoline engines
rather than turbo-diesels. Some turbo-diesels are so good (nearly anything from
VW, for example) that they achieve better economy than hybrids yet have tons
more torque when you need it.

The Prius would be similar to the Civic except that I consider the Prius'
technology superior. The gas and electric powerplants are two distinct units
that can operate independently. The Civic always uses both at the same time
because the electric motor is simply sandwiched between the gas engine and the
transaxle.

Power-wise, they're comparable.

The Camry Hybrid ("TCH"), on the other hand, is far from simply being the
Prius' big sibling. The technology is the same, but both the gas engine and
electric motor are much more powerful. If memory serves, it makes a whopping
340 ftlbs of torque at low speeds. In other words, neck-snapping acceleration
from 0 to about 44, where the hugely-torquey (199 ftlbs) electric motor starts
being taken out of the loop. Its peak torque exceeds what my Subaru WRX STi
makes, and it's considered a VERY fast car.

Turn off the traction control and it can do a massive burn-out. Yet still get
excellent fuel economy when driven properly.

Still, without plug-in ability and diesel engines, hybrids currently give only
a fraction of the benefit they could.

If you're considering a Toyota Prius, you should just as strongly consider a VW
Jetta TDI unless most of your driving is stop-and-go city. On the highway in
the real world, Jetta's are smoking Prius's in terms of economy, plus they're
quite comfortable and solidly-built.

I'm not into retail stocks, but if I was to buy one, it would be ROST. Compare
the metrics to CWTR.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=ROST

For a slightly higher valuation, you're are getting a company with rising
earnings, increased Nov. sales comps, an expanding national footprint, and a
dividend. Ross's ROE dwarfs CWTRs. Check out the short interest in both stocks.
Where is the value in a stock where 24% of the float is short? Just like Pier
One, I believe CWTR is a value trap. In my opinion, ROST is the safer pick.

Using the Peter Lynch "shopping" test, recently, my wife went to Macy's to buy
a household item. She couldn't find anybody in the department to help her, so
she left and stopped off at Ross. She found the identical item at a much
cheaper price.

Hi rllee - RE: AYR, GLS - Would the tax complications be minimize if the stocks
are bought within an IRA?
============================
I did not see any foreign taxes withheld by the company, so as an IRA
investment, this might be a good choice. The key is as long as the company
makes their dividend, the return is quite attractive. I also noticed that you
could also do a buy and write strategy where you could write covered calls on
your position to increase the total return.

There was a posting up thread that discussed the large depreciation expense on
their aircraft. I am not too sure how the accounting by the company treats
their depreciation expense and if sufficient funds are reserved from current
cash flow to buy new aircraft. Management usually manages this income stream so
older aircraft is replaced with newer models. That is why I look at the %
dividend Payout and it needs to be under 100% (or lower). A dividend payout
greater than 100%, signals to me that the company is not putting enough money
aside to replace their working assets.

I own a few shipping companies and their cash flow is huge compared to the
useful life and expenses of maintaining their fleet. What has happened in the
last two years, the company has sold their old ships for a profit and bought
new ones. Their fleet has actually appreciated in value because of the supply
and demand for new ships.

I am also looking at REITs for income and one point was made that over time
real estate should appreciate. At this point in the cycle, real estate may
actually depreciate in value over the next two years.

My long term concern is inflation. During a period of high inflation, you want
to own fixed assets as they generally will appreciate in value at the same rate
as the core inflation rate. Aircrafts have some technological obsolescence and
are usually depreciated at a faster rate than dry bulk carrier ships.

It all comes back to management and how conservative or aggressive they are in
their accounting. AYR was founded in 2004 and GLS was founded in 2006, so both
companies have a limited track record. Management expertise would be my main
concern in such an investment.

Dunno about Chicos and Talbots, but I ruled out

fell to $15 and change, to 24% today. Last two earnings
reports were atrocious which is why the stock is down
71% in last 6 months. Management went from forecasting
a small profit, to flat earnings, to forecast a 11-12
per share loss, which they beat in their earnings
report on Nov 28 with a loss of only 7 cents. I don't
think you should get points for beating your own low ball
guidance from 3 months prior.

Dennis Pence, the guiding hand over the company since
it's founding retired on Oct 30. Don't know much about
the new guy, Griesmer, except that he's got some years
on him in retail.

An old article in the Spokane Spokesman-Review describes
Coldwater Creeks’s humble beginnings:

“Pence and his former wife, Ann Pence, founded Coldwater Creek
in 1984, after making a quality-of-life move to Sandpoint from
New Jersey. He was a former marketing manager for Sony Corp.
She was a freelance advertising copywriter. . . . The couple
arrived in Sandpoint on Christmas Eve in 1983 with $40,000 in
savings. They launched a small mail-order business from their
apartment, exhausting their savings and a line of credit before
Coldwater Creek finally turned a profit in 1985.”

They built CWTR into a $1 billion dollar company...before this
latest downturn. How many people can say they've done something
like that?

Well, they were making a lot of money last year. So the stock was way
overpriced. When it was mentioned for the first time on this thread, I said so.
You are right that it fell 71%, but you're on "Value investing" thread. And at
the 71% haircut, it is attractive whether you have 24% shorts or not. It has
been said that shorts are smarter than longs because they do their homework.
Actually, shorts that go around shorting stocks way into decline are as stupid
as longs buying stocks into stratosphere. Of course, they all have their
justification now: "This is going to 0", "Recession is imminent", "The world
will end on Friday", "Ha ha I made 15K you stupid longs".

No, I can't guarantee that CWTR will go up from here and I won't encourage you
to buy it. I might even not buy it myself, since there are a lot of
opportunities. However, basing the decision not to buy on the stock decline
percentage and short interest is IMHO not very smart.

OTOH, management change from the founder is not a good sign. Thanks for that.

I looked at CWTR when I saw the insider buying cluster.

GRIESEMERs buy is the only one thats significant and I believe he broke federal
securities laws by buying within 6 months of his last sale.

I believe that by law he is supposed to return the excess profits to the
company. (On shares he bought back within 6 months of selling)

While CWTR mildly interesting, I like to buy retail stocks at a discount to
book value and CWTR, according to yahoo, trades at a premium.

At this time of the year, buying beaten down stocks is usually a good idea.

When tax loss selling abates, the lack of selling can drive the stocks up a
good % on little volume.

I think the chances are better than CWTR sees $8 before it sees $5 but, with
tax loss selling, cheap often becomes cheaper. Ive learned never to be
surprised at how low stocks will go when people want out this time of the year.

With all due respect, Jurgis, my anecdote was not to show how they make a
profit. My anecdote was to show how they attract new customers. Believe me, my
wife is not your typical Ross shopper, but she was shocked that the service was
so poor at Macys and that she could find the same item at Ross. She even said
the service was better.

If you want to talk about profitability, ROST beats WMT and COST hands-down in
operating and profit margins. How do they do it? I don't know. Clearly, they
have a model that works and is reasonably priced in terms of their share price,
in my opinion.

You didn't make a case why they can't continue to make 20% ROE. I believe they
probably will because this is a mediocre Christmas season and there will be
plenty of close-outs to choose from. Also, a slowing economy will help the
close-out stores.

When dealing with retail stocks, perhaps it's better not to tie yourself to a
particular brand. As Heidi Klum says on Project Runway, "One day you're in and
the next day you're out." Purchasing CWTR is a bet that they will be in again.
At least that is what this excerpt from the most recent CC sounds like.

"To summarize, with clothing playing such an important part in her identity and
lifestyle, it is key for Coldwater Creek to offer compelling merchandise not
found elsewhere by introducing fresh, new product, designed to keep the brand
absolutely relevant to this customer. And as I mentioned during our recent
investor day, we are working diligently on new strategic initiatives for the
merchandising area. We have identified the opportunities and we are confident
in our abilities to deliver compelling, differentiated and exciting merchandise
to this customer."

Please. Sounds like a shot in the dark to me. In short, I'm not smart enough to
know when they will turn it around and attract new customers to their stores.
I'll take a close-out store with ROST's numbers any day.

Hmmm, it might be time to take another look at ROST. I looked at both them and
TJX a few years back and went with TJX because I thought TJX was better
managed. At the time I was right, as ROST's disastrous implementation of their
new IT systems proved (they actually had no idea what was in inventory for a
number of months).

At least something like CWTR or CHS or TLB have brands that may be worth
something. ROST? ROST is not a brand. It's the same as TJ Max or Marshall's or
whatever other closeout discounter you take. It's probably better managed but
that's it.

I disagree that these retailers don't have brand identity. I assume you're
aware that TJ Maxx and Marshall's are owned by the same company (TJX). If the
name doesn't matter, why use two names? Branding concepts for ROST or TJX may
be different than, say CHS or TLB, but they still matter.

When I do look at ROST, the most important thing for me will be their inventory
management. This is always extremely important in retail, but I believe it is
the key differentiator for discounters. When I last looked at them, their
inventory management was very weak, and I thought their extreme reliance on
packaway put them at a disadvantage. At a 20% ROE, it certainly looks like they
might have gotten past their IT problems and are using their systems to more
effectively manage their business.

Re Macy's service - imho almost all retailers suck at service, especially
around holidays. Except perhaps Saks Fifth Avenue. ;)

Re ROST - no, I was not going to make the case that they can't sustain 20% ROE.
I find it amazing that they can but, cool - more power to them. I do buy some
retailers like AEO with expectations of ~20% ROE, so I may buy ROST too. I was
just indicating why they also may crash in the future.

Re brands - you have something there, but I am not sure you are totally right.
Most brands do have a loyal customer base. There are two problems that may
happen: there is a general slowdown in spending and the loyal customers shop
less frequently (or for smaller amounts). This is temporary and the brand may
recover without any changes when the slowdown passes. But there is also a side
risk: the brand may decide that the slowdown is not general but due to its
product line and decide to change the products alienating the loyal core. (They
may do that even without slowdown.) This can kill the brand. So there is
definitely risk whenever slowdown occurs. :)

Re concretely CWTR, from what I've seen anecdotally they do have a loyal
customer core. They are somewhat mid-upscale priced, which is potentially the
reason of their slowdown in current economy. They have been offering pretty
good quality merchandise, so the brand is not all hot air. But will they
recover... who knows. If they decided to sacrifice quality to change the image,
they would lose their core customers. Hopefully they won't.

either management thinks that their shares are overpriced, so there's no point
to buy them; or the company is in trouble to raise capital and then there is no
point to buy the stock either. Of course, they always have explanation that
they will use money for spectacular opportunities and this may be a bit closer
to truth with ACAS who cannot borrow for those opportunities, but still it all
comes at expense of existing shareholder dilution. And apparently it's not the
first time either - their share count has increased from 150M to 180M since

Yes, that's why some people have said these are Ponzi schemes. Dividends are
paid to shareholders from proceeds from new stock that's issued. So it is
alleged/assumed/stated by some.

Stock issuance is a way of life for ACAS, ALD, other bdc's. It's the business
model, and it's the way these companies grow. Periodic issuance of stock is not
dilutive because the stock is issued above stated book value - not below stated
book value (which would be dilutive). The money they get from the stock
issuance is put to work: it's levered and the returns on that money increase
earnings (and book value) over all the outstanding shares.

these rigs can generate when out on lease.

It looks like you discovered a good one in SeaDrill (SDRLF.PK).

Here is a recent article I discovered in my research on this sector.
Deep Sea Drilling: A Risk Worth Taking?
posted on: May 03, 2007 | about stocks: GSF / NBL / PDE / SDRLF.PK
http://seekingalpha.com/article/34414-deep-sea-drilling-a-risk-worth-taking
From the article:"...As long as the rigs are in demand and users are willing to
sign five year contracts that don't even start for several years, it's
certainly worth it to buy one for over $500 million, even if you won't see it
hit the water until mid-2010. Phew. Crazy business, but it is one with massive
cash flows, and if SeaDrill continues along this track without major
acquisitions I'd expect it to begin paying a significant dividend of those cash
flows to shareholders within the next couple years, just as Fredriksen did with
his Frontline tanker business (perhaps in part by selling the rigs off to Ship
Finance, which is also riding high, and getting relatively generous lease-back
deals). It should be a very interesting company and space to watch, at least

National Oilwell Varco, Incorporated (NOV) is another one that seems to be a
play in the sector but it already has had a big run YTD and it seems to be a
bit overvalued to me at this point.

Any opinion on NOV?

National Oilwell Varco, Inc. engages in the design, construction, manufacture,
and sale of systems, components, and products to the oil and gas industry
worldwide. It operates in three segments: Rig Technology, Petroleum Services &

Thanks for the explanation and article. I understand the dilemma: they pay out
80%+ as dividends, so they need secondaries to grow. But then we can't really
call it growth, since they essentially are creating a new part of the company
through the offering that then potentially benefits the old part of the company
shareholders too, but only partially. I have to think how to account for that,
since IMHO straightforward metrics all get distorted by this business scheme.
I.e. ROE is not really applicable. Yield is not really affected, P/E maybe not
either. Maybe, like someone said, you want to buy them at NAV or below... Not
sure, have to think more. :)

Further, maybe the new G37 Infinity is moving closer to knocking the 3 series
cars down from top of the public perception of price/performance/value in this
segment.

That's tough to do. As some of you may know, my main avocation is Performance
Driving Instructor. I teach people how to hustle their car around a road course
quickly and safely, making the kinds of reactions that steer you around a deer
rather than skidding into it involuntary habits. In return, the car clubs let
us instructors have our own sessions to flail on our poor cars.

I get exposed to a lot of cars on a regular basis when the weather's warm.
Especially German cars since it's primarily the BMW, Audi, and Porsche clubs
that hold these events. Though all makes are welcome.

That said, even as exposed to cars as I am, and in tune with what's what
especially in the area of "performance" or "driver's" cars, I'm quite
brain-washed when it comes to BMW's.

And with my intense car exposure, I can only assume that I'm about the least
brain-washed person around.

But I can't imagine anything that can shake my perception that BMW's 3 series
is the unassailable performance/quality champion in its price range. And I've
instructed in G35's twice and found them absolutely wonderful cars.

Heck, I'm so convinced that Bimmers are expensive high-quality cars that it
wasn't until after a friend mentioned it that I even considered that for what
I'm paying for the new Subaru, I could've gotten a pretty hot Bimmer. Aside
from the old 94 530i that I have as my main daily driver, my perception is that
BMW's are expensive and worth every penny.

If that notion can't be shaken out of my head, I wouldn't bet money on it being
shaken from the heads of others.

Hi Spekulatius - My strategy for AMAT is to slowly build my position over the
next 6 months and I wanted to start a position before year end to take
advantage of any tax loss selling.

With the run up in a lot of these solar development companies, there is rapid
speculation and it is difficult to pick a winner especially at a value price.
This is a 3-5 year play so I wanted to make sure I had at least some seed money
planted in this emerging sector.

As I stated in my earlier post AMAT seemed like a good value oriented play that
allowed some long term participation in this sector, specifically the equipment
manufacturing.

I also own Corning Inc. (GLW) which is a play in Polycrystalline Silicon
(polysilicon) a major material component in photovoltaic solar cells. They own
a 32% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor which is a major manufacturer of
polysilicon. Management recently approved a $1 billion expansion in May that
will double the site's silicon output to 36,000 metric tons by 2010.

http://www.dowcorning.com/content/news/hemlock_expansion.asp

Currently at Hemlock Semiconductor about 60 percent of the company's silicon
goes into the electronics market and 40 percent is sold to the solar panel
market. The electronics market continues to grow at about 10 percent annually,
but the solar panel market is growing between 35 to 40 percent per year.

Spot prices for polysilicon are approaching $400 per kilogram. Hemlock will be
increasing their production in early 2008 by about 4,500 metric tons (30%
increase to 16,000 metric tons) and by 2010 they should be able to manufacture
32,000 metric tons. According to management, their 2008 production is already
pre-sold.

========================================================
It looks like the solar business is beginning to take traction and by 2010
should be in a new long term growth market especially if oil stays above $100.
Both AMAT and GLW seem like good value investments that should participate in
the potential long term growth of this emerging sector.

I sort of wonder what happens if the mortgage insurer get downgraded from AAA
to AA or less. Nobody (except the ratings agencies )believes that MBIA and
peers are AAA any more despite the capital infusions.

If MBIA and peers get downgrades there is going to be an enormous amount of
bonds that need to be regraded on a standalone (just based on the value of
their underlying assets) basis. Since the amount of bonds is so large it could
take weeks and month for the ratings agencies to get through the mess.

So the holders of such bonds won't know what the real rating is going to be
like. I think that is a scenario where I can see a disaster in the bond market
coming with everybody running to the exits before the other guy does. While
some bonds may be find on a standalone base, you as a holder won't know for a
long time.

This maybe the reason why the credit agency don't downgrade - they just are not
able to handle to work (besides the CDO mess where there are in knee deep
also).

"This mess is so big And so Deep and so tall,
we cannot pick it up. There is no way at all!"

Not good times for Trident Microsystems: CFO resigns. Earlier there've been
analyst downgrades apparently because TRID's chips for LCD tv's are high-end,
and consumers are finding low-end sets a better price/value proposition
compared to producers' expensive/feature-rich sets.

No matter (to me, -g-). With minimal ltd and $200M in cash/cash equivalents
($3.4/sh.), a stated b.v. of $3.7/sh. (i.e. company does not have capital tied
up in manufacturing assets), and a stock price now of $5.54/sh., I'm a buyer of
TRID today. To me, it seems worth being in and waiting to see if co. can use
talent and money for new successful projects. That they have done in past.
Upside is a double or triple or more again. Downside is time-value-of-money

But Barneys New York (a unit of Dubai World) and Nordstrom Inc., in particular,
have kicked it up a notch by stationing concierges at several of their
highest-profile branches to fulfill an array of customer requests that have
nothing to with shopping -- for example, obtaining seats at the best
restaurants or arranging admission to the hottest clubs. In return, the stores
say they gain new customers and foster deeper loyalty in their old ones. It is
another way for retailers to set themselves apart in a world where even the
best stores often carry similar brands.

Seattle-based Nordstrom, for instance, has concierge desks in eight of its 101
stores. They are in stores in the largest cities and serve in part as a local
chamber of commerce, providing information about the city's sites, best
restaurants and other areas of interest. Among other tasks, they also deliver
merchandise to people's homes or hotels at no charge.

I'll up my CIT position a little.

Barron's has a Tueday article headlined "The CIT Value Trap"

"GFI analysts David Kelly and Chris Parkinson advised clients in a Monday
advisory that CIT shares look cheap as they trade near the 52-week low, but
that things are not what they seem.

The two analysts pointed out that Wall Street has lowered earnings estimates
and thus the ongoing risks are not accurately reflected, which suggests a "high
risk of a value trap."

"We would need to see a material tightening in CIT CDS spreads before turning
positive on CIT shares," Kelly and Parkinson said.

Many options traders believe there is a strong correlation between CDS spreads
and options volatility. Implied volatility is driven by put buying, and put
prices would increase on credit concerns."

I sold my CIT recently as I simply lost confidence (probably at the worst
possible time). Here is my reasoning:

CIT has pledged 7.2B$ in mortgages for 5.1B$ in cash. this is a non recourse
deal which means that the worst case scenario is that CIT keeps the cash it has
already but looses all economic will loose all mortgage assets. this of course
would mean that CIT will have to write off another 2.1B$ in equity.

Besides that CIT still holds 2.5B$ in mortgage receivable. I suspect that those
are lower quality than the ones mentioned in the pool above. I think we have
quite a bit of additional writeoffs for those mortgage assets ahead of us. My
best guess is 2B$. This would reduce CIT book value/share by roughly 10$/share.
After that they would have an 78B$ balance sheet with only 4.5B$ in equity,
which looks undercapitalized. So very likely they will turn around and find an
rich Uncle in the far east who kicks back the lost 2B$ (a 30% dilution for
current owners) just like UBS, ETFC, MS or C did to replace the lost capital
and keep a decent rating.

Not a very enticing scenario and it will not be pretty for current equity
holders but i think it's fairly reasonable based on what we see unfolding at
UBS and MS recently.

It SHOULD be a straight-forward company, I would hope. Make/facilitate student

Reaching for yield (??), they got tied up in the subprime/CMO mess?

Now the new guy:

"SLM's new chief executive officer, Albert Lord, said on a conference call to
investors that his first goal for the company, known as Sallie Mae, is to
strengthen its balance sheet.

"We will need to add capital," said Lord, who took over as CEO last Friday. "In
this market, capital is king. The company needs to diversify its funding base."

Lord turned testy at times on the conference call, and toward the end said he
would take more questions at a meeting in January. He recommended that
participants arrive early "because I can assure, you will be going through a
metal detector."

At the end of the call, according to a transcript, Lord said, "There's no
questions, let's get the (expletive) out of here." That segment was removed
from the rebroadcast on the company's Web site."

Switched out of half of my SVU (SUPERVALU Inc.) and into TESCO PLC SPONS ADR
(TSCDY.PK). Tesco Foods has outperformed SuperValue in the last two years and
began to open new stores in Southern CA, NV and AZ. Their new local retail
concept is to provide quality at low prices using local producers (for both
meat & produce). Their store inventory is of high quality with less duplicate
items that allows them to keep prices low. This is a similar concept COSCO
uses. Their transportation and distribution costs are kept low as they focus on
providing local produced foods. This should help them compete if food inflation
becomes a problem.

Tesco Foods as an international retailer provides diversification with stores
around the world. Their move into "niche" U.S. markets, provides excellent
growth opportunities for this company. Same store sales and profit margins
continue to beat the large U.S. retailers.

http://finance.google.com/finance?q=OTC:TSCDY

They pay a similar dividend as SVU but in Euros that is converted into U.S.
dollars. Therefore they should do well in a weal U.S. dollar environment.

New innovations in the food retail group has been slow to develop in the U.S.
but with Tesco, their concept is new and different. They have been very
successful in Europe and I believe they should do quite well in the U.S..

JBL. That should/could work.

Company has been profitable past ten years. Some competitors have not been.

D/e ratio seems to be increasing, and roe is (still) very low. That's not good.

Still not quite sure how to look at these companies, I'll go with p/sales since
I consider them contract manufacturers, mostly assemblers (ecm = electronics
contract manufacturers), so more sales/sh = more profits/sh, and
should/could/might better off at a low stock price paid for each sales dollar.
This in spite of the companies diversifying by providing lots of design
expertise for their customers. And I understand analysts look at product lines
of customers and the industry the ecm's specialize in, for specific buy/sell
recommendations. For example if an ecm specializes in telecom equip. and that's
considered a booming area in '08-'09 (vs. assembling computers), or say
assembles the latest iPods - such an ecm is likely to be favorably viewed by
the analysts (imo).

Anyway, for me, the key p/sales ratio is low (relative to past years),
company's been profitable, stock is at lows, company is big and diverse (65000
employees), so as I say, stock could work out from here.

I occasionally check FLEX and BHE, and couple of the other small printed
circuit board manufacturers and assemblers, but I'm not so enthusiastic about
the sector. Oh for 1998-2001: now those were the days for many of these
companies.

TBAC - a maybe. I don't like inventory net-nets, since inventory can always be
discounted at least 20%.

NWLIA - The reason I don't invest in insurers is that you cannot know what the
heck are their assets and liabilities. NWLIA 10Q is a good test case for anyone
interested in investing in insurers:

If you can tell me what the heck are their assets and are they really worth
what they claim + whether their liabilities are not understated, you can be an
insurance investor. Otherwise, run the other way. Sorry, but I will be running.

I've really changed up my investing/trading approach in my trading account so
I'm a bit more conservative, and it seems to be working well. I'm basically
trading stocks I already hold in my long-term account, but getting in and out
of them for relatively small gains, which so far are adding up.

At the risk of jinxing them (as so often happens with my Options trading, which
I'm limiting to 10% of that account's value), I lightened up on
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ELN and http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ACAS today
(actually flipped a small amoung of ACAS a couple of times), rebought
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WPL with just one partial flip, and bought Jan
17.5 calls on http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ADCT and Jun 5's on
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FMT , neither of which I have in my long-term
account. They're specifically trades.

I missed out bad on FMT yesterday/today. Bought it yesterday, expecting to do a
20-cent flip on it, sold it at a 5-cent loss, and today it closed about $1.45
above where that happened, or just over 50%.

Getting back on-topic, I'm really liking both ACAS and WPL here, though ACAS's
volatility begs to be day-traded. WPL, dunno. Volume is improving on it, but it
really seems to be largely forgotten. Can reliably trade it for 40-50 cents if
it's timed right (70 cents if I were actually any good) and the trade is for
days rather than hours, but I guess it's going to be a while before it starts
getting respect again. And I'm holding onto it in the LT account for that day.

Hi Madharry - Here is an article that describes Tesco's Fresh & Easy store
concept for the U.S....Its a combination of fresh food and convenience. Their
stores are also smaller - at around 10,000 square feet they are about the size
of a Walgreen's.
http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1217/p03s03-ussc.html
From the article:"...offering organic, locally grown produce, fresh sandwiches
and smoothies, and other prepared meals at a quality and price somewhere
between the bargain-basement prices of Wal-Mart and the posher-end outlets such
as Whole Foods and Bristol Farms. It also means cheaper prices – but fewer
"peripheral" items such as dog food and prescription drugs. The shopping floor
is several times the size of a corner convenience store, but perhaps less than
half the size of a typical supermarket....."

==========================================================
Buffett's supermarket sweep
http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/mar/02/usnews.supermarkets
I did not realize that Warren Buffet is a big investor in Tesco too. In March
of 2006, he disclosed that he had built his Tesco investment to over $1 billion
and now owns about 3% of the company. His cost is around $25.50 per TSCDY ADR
share.

The stock trades as an ADR on the OTC pink sheets (TSCDY). Each share of TSCDY
equals three shares of the common that trades in London.

It will be interesting to see what becomes of TESCO's venture into the US and
how the stock fairs in 3-5 years.

valuing insurers: NWLIA.

Knowing this about any company is possibly good and maybe sufficient:
"what...their assets and are they really worth what they claim + whether their
liabilities are not understated".

I've not found it necessary though for insurance companies. Book value (the
growth of)is the standard metric used by analysts and the companies themselves
in evaluating insurance company performance.

On that basis NWLIA is cheap. Because it has almost always sold below book
value. As it does now. Which means for the past several years it's almost
always been cheap by my reasoning, because it's almost always sold under bv.
Could you make money in this stock? Yes, because book value has increased every
year and and the stock price has mostly followed it (up) too. Is the stock a
great buy now? There've been years when the the p/bk has been .7 or lower; it's
now .8. Although I've been in the stock since '02, I made my first small add
recently @ $190.

Nobody seemed to be interested in the stock when I was posting on it here in
'02. I made several buys then in a taxable and in an ira account. I still have
all these shares (because the stock is still undervalued, imo). One discussion
point back then was that the stock was iffy because patriarch Moody and his
family --the controlling sharesholders ---might not be running the company for
the good of all shareholders. Over time, for me, I don't have much of those
concerns now, given the growth in bv that the company's produced and my cursory
reading of the annual reports.

It's the same regarding Moody-controlled ANAT. I've been in since '01 with
dividends reinvested, and I made my first small add in Aug. this year with the
stock at $120/sh.

When someone is in a company for several years, over time, one gets to have
some comfort, understanding, and knowledge of how the business is run and its
issues and problems and strengths.

My opinion is that rather than "running from NWLIA", an investor ought to look
closer at it, and maybe pick a point where the stock might make for a small
buying opportunity. (.7 p/bk? Now at .8 p/bk?)

I continue to look for and buy and hold several other insurance companies that
sell below p/bk.

I disagree. If you have no clue what the heck they hold on the long side and
whether they reserve enough on the liability side, you are open to the blowup.
Maybe does not matter to you with your 300 positions, but matters to anyone who
invests more than 1% of their wealth. So - I will repeat: if you don't know
what insurer carries on their assets and if they reserve enough, you should not
be investing in it. Except perhaps in BRK/WSC.
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:12/21/2007 10:58:02 PM
From:Paul Senior
The only difference with BRK/WSC is that you trust Buffett/Munger. Or trust
their insurance rating expert. Nobody outside the company knows exactly what or
how they have rated the long-tail insurance risks - those big risks - that they
insure.

We're all different. I'd rather have 1/4 percent of my assets in a group of
under book-value insurance companies, than 5% in BRK. There's more safety in
that imo, than in BRK that's near highs and that also has exposure to markets
that are in difficulty (housing/construction).

To the extent that somebody is investing a chunk of their assets, say 5% in
something, then to say "if you don't know what insurer carries on their assets
and if they reserve enough, you should not be investing in it," then if that's
so, then my opinion is nobody should be investing in these companies, because
nobody outside the company will ever know the assets well enough to actually
and factually know if the company reserved enough. To me, it's the same as
reading any 10k where they list all the potential bad things that could happen
to the company. Somebody starts reading that stuff, they could be scared out of
investing 5% in any company.

Put another way, if you feel your circle of competence excludes insurance
companies or specifically NWLIA, than okay, sure, don't invest in them or it. I
feel my circle of competence does include insurance companies, so I am buying
the ones that meet my criteria. Or - as regards NWLIA specifically - if you are
convinced there's no margin of safety there for you - okay, pass on it. And as
you say, since my exposure to NWLIA in my accounts would be smaller percentage
than most, which is a way I control risk, I feel my margin of safety with NWLIA
is adequate. It seems to have worked out to my satisfaction in the past six
years that way.

You see that's exactly the situation where book value is not important while
trust is. And you are being disingenuous comparing well known issue of
nontransparency of financial/insurance balance sheets to "reading any 10k where
they list all the potential bad things that could happen to the company". Most
of those are really remote or possible to evaluate while we are sitting in the
middle of one of the largest blowups of the financials throughout history. And
you have the chutzpah to claim that it's not a big deal. Brushing off very
legitimate concerns is not competence whatever you claim.

my opinion is nobody should be investing in these companies, because nobody
outside the company will ever know the assets well enough to actually and
factually know if the company reserved enough - amen to that. Unless you really

Clarification on my http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ADCT position: Though I
usually buy calls as nothing more than a highly leveraged trade, in this
particular instance it's a little bit of that, but also more along the lines of
what I think is the true spirit of a call contract. While it's relatively
inexpensive to do so, I'm getting myself the right to buy the stock at a
specific price if it does well in the next month, so this is one of those rare
(for me) situations where my inclination is to later exercise the call rather
than sell it. If it does well, I'll likely take the stock and if it doesn't do
well, I'll take the smallish loss on the contract.

I lightened up on http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ELN simply because it gave me a
trading profit opportunity. I was oblivious until last night why that
opportunity presented itself. Phase 3 testing of an Alzheimer's compound has
started (it's the drug that's kept me long this stock for ages, with Tysabri as
a safety net) and the results of Phase 2 will be out in the near future. An
event I've really been anticipating.

And they announced the start of Phase 2 on yet another Alzheimer's compound.

Had I not put in a triggered trailing stop and gotten filled and actually
noticed that it was up and why, I likely would've added instead.

It's easily my fave pharma. Tysabri (for MS), two AD compounds, and nanocrystal
technology, which has had some adoption but not a lot yet and allows a compound
to be reformulated to stave off generic competition longer.

After thinking about it a bit more, I guess there are couple points that I may
not have expressed clearly, so let's try again:

- What's on the asset side of financial companies. IMHO, investor should at
least try to understand this. It might be easier for some companies (WSC and
BRKa fall there, btw, since a lot of their assets are publicly traded equities
fully disclosed) and harder for others (NWLIA is IMO harder case). I disagree
with your approach that you mentioned couple times: "do not dig deep, since
it's hard or impossible or takes too much time and diversify instead".
Information is the most important thing to have in investing and deliberately
refusing to go for it is IMHO not acceptable.

- Insurance premiums, risks and reserves - i.e. how much the company got paid
for what. This part we can agree that it is pretty much unknown and should be
taken by trust or a person should not invest in company at all. It is similar
for banks and credit card companies although maybe more transparent and shorter
term: we don't know who the bank lends to and at what rates, so that part we
have to take by trust. Banks may report part of this, insurance companies
pretty much escape this IMO since they use proprietary models that would be
tough to understand anyway.

- Valuation matters. Sorry if I seemed to argue against. At half book value any
company is less risky than the same company at full book or two times book.

- Trust is very important. IMHO much more in financials and insurers than in
other companies, but perhaps it is not much of a difference.

- Buying a basket of companies or index on sector valuation or macro thesis.
This may work. IMHO, it's not the best way to invest, but well, you pay your
money and you make your choices.

Good luck and sorry if this became more heated than needed. :)

Regarding http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NWLIA and the notion of trust:

Well, whether or not you get unanimous agreement on your reasoning, it's
difficult to argue with the fact that you're up well in excess of 100% on that
position and aside from a downturn in recent months, it's a chart that's simply
on a slow, reliable climb for a long time. You got respectable appreciation.

Was the expectation that it might someday trade at full book value or a small
premium over it why you initially bought it at .7bk? Or was it observing that
book value kept increasing?

Personally, I don't look at the balance sheet or price/book until pretty late
in my DD cycle. I've noticed that in the UK, the balance sheet is king, but I
have to like the P&L before I'll even take a peek and assume most Yanks do the
same.

NWLIA is definitely outside my sphere of competence, and it doesn't meet my
less-conservative/more-risk approach of having to either like the dividend or
the story.

Hmmmm... The chart is quite similar to http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SRE , which
pays a 2% dividend and has much higher average daily volume. I don't own it but
traded it long and short several years ago.

But if one's horizon is as long-haul as yours apparently is, it probably
doesn't matter as much what the average volume is. It's pretty important to me,
at least in my trading account, because I don't like to own enough of any
company that I can move it myself as happened recently with
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WPL . I put in what I thought was a limit sell
order, not realizing it was actually a buy order, and it effectively being a
market buy order took the price up 20 cents.

Getting back to NWLIA, if it's trading at .8bk right now, but was 25% higher
earlier in the year (just a few months ago, actually), did it get past book
value? Do you think that's part of why it's pulled back?

I'm mildly curious about this industry, and especially the notion of
perpetually trading at less than book value. I'm more accustomed to looking at
that situation and seeing it as either a buying opportunity or a red flag.
Neither of which applies, IMO, in a historied company like NWLIA.

That said, http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BME , which trades at .9bk, is in my
long-haul portfolio. My broker and I disagree about the p/bk. He thinks it'll
reach book and is currently undervalued. I think it'll always stay around .9bk
but I trust management to grow the book value in the same way you do with
NWLIA. Oh, but I have it mainly because of the 5.9% dividend.

So I have to agree with you about it being okay to invest based on trusting
management, and it's often the only way to go when you just don't have a lot of
visibility into the numbers. But in my case, my trust (unless I really like the
story) needs at least a 5% dividend.

Oh, and just in case there are any readers who are into penny stocks, I should
emphasize that trust shouldn't be given lightly. I've been burned in the past
and sheeple are always in the process of being led to slaughter by misplacing
their trust. It's only okay to trust a company if their past performance proves
that you can.

Regarding analyst optimism about http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AMAT based on
entry into solar-panel field:

I personally place zero value on solar panels being a reason to buy a company
until some breakthrough technology is invented that drops the price of the
panels. Dramatically.

With solar panels priced at $5/watt, they're only viable to a pretty small
market. Assuming a grid price of $0.10 per KwH (I pay $0.075), and peak solar
panel output an average of 5 hours per day, let's look at the math.

Panel cost: $835
Wattage: 170
Cost per Watt: $5

Daily output: 835 watt-hours (.84KwH) or enough to power a 60-watt lightbulb
for 14 hours.

Annual output: 305KwH

Cost of 305KwH from grid: $30.50

Panel payback period: 27 years

That's assuming the panel lasts that long and continues to produce the same
amount of juice over the whole timeframe and doesn't take into account the cost
of batteries (which have to be replaced at least a few times in that 27 years)
and an inverter/charge-controller.

Granted, in some locations it's possible to get more like an average of 10
hours per day of peak output using readily available technology that
continuously aims the panels for maximum output, but most of the country/world
isn't those areas. And even in those areas, you're looking at 13 years to get
your money back. I used 5 hours per day to assume static rooftop mounting and
to take overcast days into account, so I think my 5-hour estimate is generous.

Personally, I'm planning to get a few panels for my RV and my car hauler when
I've got the cash and time to burn on a couple of projects that interest me and
have minor usefulness, but I hate the ROI at current prices. Prices have only
barely come down in the 5+ years I've been watching them.

I don't think solar panels will be much of a big deal until they're priced low
enough to make it worthwhile for builders to make it a common practice to put
them on the roofs of new houses or add them to existing ones.

I'd personally love to have a bunch of panels and am more motivated than most
people because of my fascination with alternative energy, but I won't buy any
real quantities until they're below $3 per watt. And I think it's going to take
$2 per watt before solar panels move from utilities in deserts and the fringe
element and into the mainstream.

So I disagree with the analyst about solar being a reason to buy AMAT. Nearly
everyone who discusses the topic overvalues solar and overestimates the demand
for it at anywhere near its current cost.

Give me a company that can dramatically reduce the prices either through
innovation or economy of scale. I was initially optimistic about it when Honda
announced their intentions to enter the foray, since they're a very inventive
(and, of course, very large) company, but no joy yet. To me, solar is just a
buzzword right now whose overuse is getting long in the tooth.

NWLIA

I originally bought NWLIA because the p/bk at the time was lower than the
average p/bk. Something like .6 vs. avg. .7 or more (I don't recall), and
because the p/bk rose every year that I saw. P/bk on any day that I've held the
stock never reached 1.0 until this year. When it dropped to about .8, I just
decided I'd add a few more shares on the assumption if it could trade finally
at 1x once, it can (and maybe will) do it again. Perhaps wrong logic.
Reversion-to-top instead of reversion-to-mean. haha. Maybe too, I was feeling
sorry for myself that I didn't make any sells when stock hit p/bk =1 . So I
added a bit in hopes that stock would see those days again. Same story for me
this year for the other Moody-family dominated insurer ANAT, which also
surpassed p/bk =1 for the first time in years I've held it.

With insurers, I always check p/bk first thing. Several insurers come right out
and say increasing book value is a goal for them and that is how they want to
be measured. In private market valuations - takeovers - it's often seen that
the price paid is reported as a multiple of bv, e.g. a takeover at 1.5xbv. or
2xbv.

I like to look at historical p/bk figures to see how these stocks might trade.
You could say (and be right)that my add this year of NWLIA was expensively
bought at p/bv of maybe .8 or slightly less. With an insurer like MKL
though,(which I hold), the stock price is about $476, and I'm looking to add at
about $460/sh where the p/bk would be about 1.6-1.7xp/bv (on some reasonable
estimate of forward earnings and associated higher bv. next year). Such a price
($460) would suggest to me that for MKL, a p/bk of 1.6-1.7 is relatively low
compared to MKL's historical average. (ie. whereas .8 is historically
relatively high for NWLIA)

Earnings (eps) come into the picture too. A lot of these insurers/reinsurers
are trading at low p/e's and that ought to be factored into a buy decision as
well. ENH is one for me.

I'm just saying what I do and giving my opinion. Others should be doing what
works for them.

I think it may be time to look at the financial stocks with an eye to their
fundamentals and the reason a free capitalist society needs financial
companies.

To channel savings to profitable investments.

The current messy environment of subprime-ARM-AltA, bankrupting mortgage resets
(President Bush is being presidential here), unrealistic debt ratings, and
feared cascading defaults will surely pass. As will the current managements of
some sloppily ran financial companies.

We are living through a financial panic similar to 1893, 1907, 1929 - 32, 1989.
Put your trust in the Cash Account, Long Term debt coverage ratio, book value,
free cash flow ratio, capitalization ratios (the less debt the better). And the
trends of these fundamentals and ratios over an entire business cycle. These
ancient concepts from Investing 101 will serve you well during this panic.
Also, the old testament story of Joseph and his interpretation of the Pharoah's

Yes, JWN debt has gone up since it announced an additional $1.0 billion in
share repurchase to bring the total authorization to $2.5 billion. Some will
feel it is a risky move and JWN needs to be careful with its debt ratios.
Operating margins declined last quarter but operating cash flow remains
positive. Demand for the company’s products and services has been strong as
sales for the last quarter grew 5.25% rising to $1.97 billion.

S&P: Annual earnings at JWN were positive for the last five years and
consistently increased through the period.

JWN employs a capital structure that appears to be appropriate for companies in
the Department Stores group and has no problem servicing debt payments. Its
capital resources total $2.8B, of which 77.5% is equity and 22.5% is attributed
to debt. JWN does a better job of collecting its accounts receivable than any
other company in the Department Stores group. In 2007, the average number of
days its accounts receivable were outstanding was 46. However, this was 0.8
days slower than the accounts receivables collection during the previous year.
JWN generates more sales from the use of its assets than nearly any other
company in the Department Stores group. This is evidenced by its 2007 Total
Asset Turnover of 1.8x. During Fiscal Year 2007, JWN spent $264.4M on capital
expenditures. This amount represented a steady decrease in spending over the
last four years. During 2007, JWN earned $962.5M from its investing activities.

News Snips:

Going against the grain of currently gloomy forecasts for the economy,
Nordstrom said on Monday that it plans to add "a moderate amount of leverage"
in advance of increasing its share-repurchase program by $1 billion.

The upscale department store chain asserted that it has a greater capacity for
debt, citing its strong credit-card business and the generally under-leveraged
position of its balance sheet relative to operating cash flows.

In less forboding economic times, of course, it's widely considered a good idea
for companies with little debt to take on some additional borrowing if they can
handle it. But with some economists forecasting a recession in the early part
of next year, this is a curious time for a cyclical company to consider adding
debt.

Nordstrom, however, is planning to set up a new balance-sheet leverage target.
It believes the new target will lower its weighted average cost of capital and
still support its credit rating.

Interesting timing. Was just talking with someone in another thread about
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FMT .

I traded it a lot during the initial subprime carnage, had ignored it for a
while, and recently started trading it again, and bought some calls on it
Friday. Am considering making a long-termer out of it since they appear to be
fundamentally strong and are starting to gain a perception of being a subprime
survivor with the worst behind them.

Thoughts?

Edit: LOL. Just double-checked and it was you with whom I was having the FMT
conversation. Okay, I know your thoughts. Anyone else? A possible Value
Investing play? Personally, I think it's a rare opportuniy to just casually
pick up a knife that finished falling long ago.

Potash One Bulls.... Good thread !!

I expect Sprott to make their entry shortly into Potash One.
Pinetree and Sprott are tight....

Don't count PNP out yet...

Our thoughts are there are bigger fish than Pinetree and Longview that are
going to be interested in KCL and friends down the road. If the potash and
phosphate bull unwinds like other commodity plays, the majors will make a move
on them at some point if the project is at all viable.

Home is where the heart is.

Upping my losing position in PFN now as I notice Bill Gross adds to his
position.

I wouldn't be surprised to see him mention this one again in Barron's upcoming
2008 Roundtable (assuming he's a guest).

Dividend yield is >11%, and p/bk < .9

surprisingly enough im still having a positive quarter ahead of my target goal,
too bad it used to be a monster quarter, sigh.I tried to add to my oversize SIL
position today but failed to hit my limit bid. Perhaps 1008 will be its year.

I was reading something somewhere about Hovanian. Im glad I dont own it. I
thought I might buy the preferred and then I found out that not only is there
no maturity period but the dividends are no cumulative and the only penalty for
not paying dividends aside from priority in a bankruptcy is that after 6
quarters the preferred holder may appoint 2 members to the board in a
non-voting advisory capacity. Why anyone would buy such a security to begin
with is beyond me. Then I was reading how The builders were pretty much able to
dictate the approval and mortgage terms or they would yank their territories
away and give it to another mortgage company. This probably means that many of
the mortgage loans that were made on re company sold properties are worse than
the normal ones.

I can't speak to muni bonds directly, but in a related area (and for similar
reasons) there are pretty good deals right now on "trust preferred" issues.
These are issues that are above common stock but below other debt.

In the past, many trust preferred issues were not available on retail market,
but because of the current credit squeeze even solid companies e.g. utilities,
etc are forced to seek wider money, making these available to a wider circle of
investors AND the interest rates are very good considering the reasonable risk:
perhaps 2% higher than just a few years ago in some cases, many around 7 to 8%
or higher. A few trust preferreds are traded publicly,(e.g. On NYSE Red Lion
Hotels has one paying out at 9.5%. Not recommending, just an example. I would
probably stick with utility companies myself.). For others I would go through
my banker.

If I may ask, what is the attractiveness of SIL in general and for SIL now for
a buy?

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=SIL

I hold a few share stub from 9/06. I cannot find a good reason now why I should
continue to keep it.
