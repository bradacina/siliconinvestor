Paul BARRONS ON AMD [In my notes, I large cap stuff for emphasis and inserted a
comment]: >>10/6/02 BARRONS TRADER By ERIC J. SAVITZ But, hey, all was not
gloom and gloom. Thanks to cost cutting and market share gains, Dell Computer
boosted its earnings and revenue expectations for the current quarter, and the
stock ticked up 46 cents, or 1.9%, to 24.76.

But let's be clear: Dell is a market share story. PC demand remains lifeless.
That was made clear by Advanced Micro Devices, which pre-announced that
revenues for the September quarter totaled about $500 million, more than $100
million below Street expectations. AMD HAS BEEN HAMMERED BY THE LATE LAUNCH OF
THE HAMMER, A NEW MICROPROCESSOR ORIGINALLY EXPECTED LATE THIS YEAR AND NOW
SCHEDULED FOR SOMETIME IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2003. According to several
analysts, the SHARP REVENUE MISS RESULTED IN PART FROM SOME CUSTOMERS SHIPPING
BACK TO AMD PROCESSORS SOLD IN PREVIOUS QUARTERS -- NEGATIVE REVENUES, IN
ESSENCE.

One-Day Wonder: After starting the quarter with a blast Tuesday, the market was
felled by earnings warnings that sent it back into its swoon, ensuring a sixth
straight losing week.

And that's not the least of it. There are GROWING FEARS THAT AMD'S BALANCE
SHEET ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THE ROUGH ENVIRONMENT. While the COMPANY
HAD ABOUT $1.1 BILLION IN CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT JUNE 30, THAT CASH
IS QUICKLY EVAPORATING. Tim Mahon, chip analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston,
EXPECTS THE COMPANY TO BE CASH FLOW NEGATIVE OVER THE NEXT SIX QUARTERS -- he
FIGURES THE COMPANY'S CASH POSITION WILL GO NEGATIVE IN NEXT YEAR'S SECOND
QUARTER, necessitating new financing to fund operations.

Dan Niles, chip analyst at Lehman Brothers, figures AMD HAS ABOUT $800 MILLION
IN CASH LEFT -- NOT A LOT, GIVEN IT IS BURNING $300 MILLION A QUARTER. He sees
a "MASSIVE RESTRUCTURING" AHEAD. Merrill Lynch analyst Joseph Osha points out
in a research note that AMD FACES ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY PRESSURES FROM LOANS
RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S DRESDEN CHIP FAB -- HE SAYS $160 MILLION IN LOANS ARE
DUE NEXT YEAR. (Overall, the company had $1.1 billion in long-term debt at June
30, plus another $367 million in short-term borrowings.)

Niles notes that INTEL, MEANWHILE, HAS PULLED AHEAD OF AMD IN PROCESSOR SPEED.
AND IT WILL BE ROUGH FOR AMD TO CATCH UP. As Niles notes, INTEL WILL SPEND MORE
ON R&D THIS YEAR -- ABOUT $4 BILLION -- THAN AMD WILL HAVE IN REVENUE -- ABOUT
$2.6 BILLION. And that's nOT COUNTING ANOTHER $5 BILLION-PLUS INTEL WILL SPEND
ON CUTTING-EDGE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT THAT NILES SAYS WILL REDUCE THE CHIPMAKER'S
PRODUCTION COSTS BY 20% TO 25%. AMD, meanwhile, could be forced to outsource
production -- which would save them some money in capital expenses, but require
them to pay a middleman like UMC or Taiwan Semiconductor. "They're BETWEEN A
ROCK AND A HARD PLACE," says Niles. [Mytake: Key Intel Competitive Adv is
volume/share that enables them to spend more on r&d & equip without blowing
costs out of sight cause they allocate those expenses over way more units.]

Niles, we hasten to add, doesn't see AMD disappearing. At some point, he says,
the company will become an appealing acquisition target. Hard to know who would
buy them, though. IBM, maybe. Or a Taiwanese chipmaker like Via, which once
bought the Intel-clone maker Cyrix. Perhaps Micron or Samsung would like AMD's
flash memory business. But with PC fundamentals continuing to erode, and a
potentially soft Christmas season ahead, the stock may need to move even lower
before the vultures descend. For the week, AMD tumbled 2.23, or 38.9%, to 2.23,
while Intel -- itself the subject of estimate cuts by Niles and others -- eased
91 cents, or 6.2%, to 13.71.

Paul,

My first PC had an INTC processor and I've been using AMD processors ever
since. Semis seem to go through a regular love hate cycle that I've never been
able to relate to any real underlying fundamentals. As Timba mentioned, they're
losing money, but I have a hard time picturing that as being a permanent
condition. Who knows. The days when people would pay three grand for a faster
system every 6 months are long gone, but the sell off in techs over the past
several years looks to me as being over done at recent levels. I suppose if it
comes right down to it, my AMD buy is probably as much of a gut play as
anything. The fundamentals are okay, at least I don't see anything in the way
of a near term cash crunch, and maybe the recent announcement of write offs
will set the stage for a turn around. I think I'd have a hard time viewing the
stock as being seriously over valued in the $10-$12 range in a market with a
little less panic selling. Trying to second guess this market is next to
impossible, so closing my eyes and hoping my account doesn't look too screwed
up 6 months from now is about the best plan I can come up with right now.

Not doing well at all in ANY of my several ADRs. Doesn't seem to make much
difference what businesses or countries they are in. All are down from my buy
price. ouch.

I'll try an exploratory position in PY today. This company is big in aluminum.
Perhaps though, not big enough.

http://biz.yahoo.com/p/p/py.html

Would this be a typical time to buy an apparent cyclical (which PY appears to
me to be)? I don't expect PY to have a losing year this year, and analysts say
next year will have positive earnings too. So perhaps it is not the time to buy
this presumed cyclical.

Buying now based on usual stuff for me. Price decently below book value,
(Although bv isn't growing, the stock often has traded above book value), low
p/s relative to past years, dividend, fairly large (esp. for a French co.)
conglomerate. Price hitting new lows.

--------
Also adding a very little to my teeny position in CIT.

I have been adding to my position in CGI as it has come down.

Fwiw, I closed the remainder of my position in BL. I consider BL a decent value
stock. However, in this market, I'd rather have retail stocks that are big and
well-known that also seem to be value stocks, even if not so close to net-net
numbers as BL. For example, I'm considering buying AEOS again, and I'm looking
at similar. Also I might add to my losing position in GADZ.

Although PPE is the largest casino operator, the better sector investments in

I buy PPE on its price/book given its "unique" Las Vegas properties and its

1974 Redux: Why Bear Market May Be Over
candals abound, and once-powerful men are negotiating plea bargains. The stock
market has lost nearly half its value and has just endured its most volatile —
and worst — quarter in more than a decade.

In other words, it feels like late 1974. And that was a fine time to buy
stocks.

It was in the third quarter of 1974 that the stock market, already battered,
was knocked out. Nearly every stock went down, regardless of quality.
Volatility climbed to levels not seen since the Great Depression. Inflation,
recession and Watergate combined to depress investors.

And then the bear market ended.

The quarter just ended was not quite as bad as the one in 1974 — the Standard &
Poor's 500-stock index fell 18 percent, not 26 percent — but volatility was
even higher, and more than 90 percent of the stocks in the S.& P. 500 declined.

None of that proves, of course, that the bottom has been reached. In 1974, it
was reached in early October, then tested in December. This year's low came in
late July, then was tested in September. In each year, the Dow Jones
industrials set new lows during the later test, but the S.& P. did not.

Stocks are nowhere near as cheap now as they were in 1974, when single-digit
price-to-earnings ratios were common. But Steven Leuthold of Leuthold &
Company, a longtime market watcher, says that valuations are back to the median
level of markets over the last 45 years and that most bear markets end near
that median.

As for scandals, it may be noted that the final plunge in 1974, of 23 percent,
came in the 55 days after President Richard M. Nixon resigned. This year, the
final decline, of 23 percent, came in the 50 days after L. Dennis Kozlowski,
whose greed may come to symbolize this era, was forced out of Tyco. At the low
in July, as at the 1974 bottom, the S.& P. was off 48 percent from its previous
peak.

Bear markets often end before the economy hits bottom. Share prices turned up
months before the 1974-75 recession ended, and years before it was clear that
the economic concerns of that era would be dealt with effectively. And the
market advances that followed differed from those that preceded the peak. The
Nifty Fifty growth stocks — which some had thought could be bought at any price
because their outlook was so good — did not do well. The winners in a market
recovery now are not likely to be the technology companies that investors once
expected to grow to the sky.

Now there are fears of a double-dip recession. The economic data are mixed, but
the market action makes it clear that a slowdown is expected. Cash is flowing
into safe bonds paying low interest rates, simply because investors fear more
stock plunges. The risks of rising interest rates have been forgotten.

In 1974, investors rightly feared that the coming years would not be nearly as
good as the 1950's and 1960's had been. But that did not keep stocks from
recovering. "It was not that the anxieties about a difficult economic period
were wrong," said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig. "It was
that they had already been discounted."

There is, of course, no assurance that a worldwide recession — or a bad result
from an Iraqi war — would not send prices plunging again. But stock prices do
not indicate, as they did in early 2000, that investors are confident that
everything will go right. This is the kind of environment in which stocks can
exceed expectations. The great bear market could be over.

My recollection of market prior to and during Iraq 90-91:
When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the market sold off sharply for weeks.
Many stocks were halved in a matter of a few months, especially when the TV
news showed oil well after oil well on fire. People were scared and the market
reflected it. During that time I slowly bought stocks at depressed prices only
to see them drop further. By December of 1990, my portfolio was down $25+k. I
attended an Individual Investors Association meeting in Philadelphia near the
end of November and heard the evenings speaker Elaine Garzarelli talk about
here indicators (With Lehman Brothers then). She went through all indicators
and talked about how each quarter she locked herself in her home for 3 days and
ran the numbers. Her assessment was very very very bullish indicators and urged
listeners to buy. You could hear the groans all through the audience. Most
didnt believe it, didnt want to hear that...they were miserable..loosing money
and just knew she was wrong very wrong. I was a novice at the time and being
down so far just said screw it and decided to put my balance of funds into the
market. The pre-war intensified...you could cut the fear with a knife. I took
antacids and bought more..yes..averaging down. I got to the point of being
about 95% invested by January 91. My loss was now around $32k in the portfolio
and I was nervous doubting every day that I had any sanity and started to look
at the help wanted ads..even took 1 interview. It was bleak and bad..it sucked
bad. Then it happened. Mid January of 91, I was very depressed, turned on TV at
night and saw on every channel the skys over Iraq lit up. Missles flying
everywhere. Explosions all over Bagdad. Anti-aircraft fire all over the sky. I
was elated we finally attacked, but I was scared sh__less about the market the
next day. I didnt sleep that night...watched TV all night. The next day the
market opened weak but not a disaster. Within 3 days the market started to move
up and started really gain steam. Within a 9 market day period my loss went to
a $13k gain then within another 3 days a $27k gain and it rolled on for months.
So did my gains until I started to scale out in April of that year. It was my
best period ever.

Will that happen again? I have no idea. I do suspect that it may and thats why
I am involved with my strategy now.
We shall see how things play out this time. There are differences and new
threats....so no one knows.
Just though I would share that with all of you.

<<1974 Redux: Why Bear Market May Be Over>>

I just posted this on a semi-conducter equipment board, but it applies here as
well, perhaps more so. Everyone is comparing this downturn to the 70's. I do
not disagree, but also think investors should at least be aware of the '29
crash.

History does repeat itself. I highly recommend everyone currently in the market
read "The Great Crash: The anatomy of financial disaster" by the famed
economist John Kenneth Galbraith. Small book, and easy reading. Same story,
different years. The part about embezzlement has particular parallels with
ENRON, WorldComm, Global Crossing, etc. The greed that led to inflation of
assets, the belief that everyone who invested in the market was a geniuos and
would make money, and a complete disregard for company and economic
fundamentals --- well, as I said, same story, different years.

Not to say it is exactly the same, or that the downturn will last as long, or
that a great depression will follow, but it is eerily akin to the current
situation.

ADRs; US Investors repatriate dollars

In the end, the rush to exits in the US has not transpired. And looking
forward, the relapse in global growth in the third quarter of this year
suggests that more net selling by US investors of foreign securities could be
in the cards. On an annualized basis, US investors are on course to be net
sellers of foreign securities, which would mark only the second time since 1980
that US investors have actually backed out of the global financial markets. The
only other time was in 1999 -- or near the peak of the US bull market when US
investors were enticed to reallocate capital to the US. Then, greed was the
primary motivation for US overseas selling; this time around, it’s fear.

re: UNM
hi, paul. i sold all of my UNUMProvident at $22 (save a taxable $15 lot bought
2/2000) last month figuring i would have opportunities to add later. i am flat
on UNM since i started talking about it, ahead if you count the dividends. i
think i'll wait for the $15s on it. $15.50 would put it at 61% of book. First
Call PE is about 7 on 12/2002 estimates as i write.

i've been buying this week.

Wind River Systems (WIND) at $3+. Current trailing market cap to sales is .72.
I believe it's the leader in embedded real-time operating system software and
it seems like an important technology to me. Balance sheet seems okay. I've
made money on WIND by buying and selling at higher levels.

Siebel Systems (SEBL) at $5.5. The leader in CRM software. If you take away $1
billion in surplus cash from the market cap, the trailing market cap to sales
is about 1x.

FYI, on both these software companies the forward sales are falling.

I added to United Rentals (URI) at $7. I've lost money on this one but I sold a
bunch at $27. The company rents equipment so it's pretty cyclical. Moody's
rates the senior debt ba3 so the balance sheet is weak. However, price to book
is .37 and price to sales is .25. It's supposed to earn over $1. I don't know
how much of that is cash, though. The company's growth history and prospects
are excellent. Renting instead of buying equipment in order to reduce capital
intensity on the part of customers seems to be a trend.

I added to Valero Energy (VLO) at $24. I liked it at $40, so.... Moody's rates
the debt baa2. I hope whoever said that US refinery capacity is very limited in
the long run is right. Right now there's a glut and VLO is making a small
percentage of what they did in years past ($8.83 in 2001, $5.60 in 2000).

For the sake of completeness, I'll mention that I added to State Street, Morgan
Stanley, and ADP, but I don't consider them value picks so I won't elaborate.

I started a position in Orthodontic Centers of America (OCA) at $9.30. OCA's
accounting is controversial and there's some executive inbreeding. P/B is just
over 1x. OCA is supposed to earn $1.54 but it's controversial how much of that
is cash. The company is much bigger than any of its competitors in a market
that has low penetration of big players so growth prospects seem good.

I bought CIT at $16. It's currently under $15. It's supposed to earn over $3.
Price to book is under .75.

I added to Stilwell Financial (SV) at $10. It's supposed to earn over $1.

I added substantially at $15.50 to the Sabre Group (TSG), the global leader in
travel distribution. TSG is supposed to earn $1.86 per First Call. First Call
states expectations of 15% earnings growth over the next five years. I'm hoping
for 12%.

I added to Safeway at $22. This is the now my biggest absolute loser ever. It's
supposed to earn $2.81. I'm taking the contrarian position that the Wal-mart
grocery push won't have the effect the market expects. I've taken my contrarian
lumps right now.

I started a position in Diamond Offshore (DO) at $18.50. It's below its five
year low. Moody's rates its debt a3.

I re-entered MONY Group (MNY) at $22 after selling at $47 in 12/2000. It's
price to book is under 50%.

I started a position in Ralph Lauren (RL) at $17.50. The forward PE is under
10. I read an article about their business in the last year which made a vague
but favorable impression. How's that for rigor?

I re-entered Robert Half (RHI) at about $12. This is below the price I paid in
1999. I sold that position for $34. Currently, the earnings are very weak. I
started a small position hoping to add.

Finally, I started a position in Milacron (MZ) at $3.50. I believe this is a
former s&P500 component. Yahoo: "Milacron Inc. is a global supplier of
machines, tooling, supplies and services to a broad spectrum of plastics
processing and metalworking industries." The company has not seen its stock
price this low since before 1985 (as far back as yahoo goes). Price to trailing
sales is .13, price to book .29. Moody's rates the debt ba3.

Regarding AFCO you mentioned and TFS. I've got a small plateful of TFS. It's
now selling almost 55% of cash (with no debt). This company's been around a
while, and sometimes it's even been profitable.

http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/invsub/results/compare.asp?Page=TenYearSum
ary&Symbol=tfs

I'm not touting the stock or even recommending it. (I'm too shell-shocked in
this market to make any suggestions.) Regarding TFS, on the one hand, perhaps I
have made a mistake with the numbers or my calculations or assumptions. Perhaps
there are off-book deals, or crooked managers, or horrific bad news to be
forthcoming. On the other hand, if I didn't make a mistake (other than buying
the stock -g-), then I'm shocked because if this dollar bill keeps going for
50c or even less, then imo, there's no telling how low other stocks will go -
the bigger and better mid and large caps - if investors turn away from stocks
at almost any price.

Ah well...

About AFCO. I took a small starter position today. Yahoo shows $7.50 sh/cash
with no debt. The stock closed at $8.40. They're selling off a part of their
business. I'll assume that this is a positive, that they are trying to focus.
The company is expected to be profitable this year and next (per Yahoo
research). There's that kicker you mentioned regarding the beverage labeling
possibilities. In every year in the past decade or more, except 2002, these
factors might have been enough to qualify it for a buy.

lower operating cashflow due to a big jump in working capital. Bought back 60%
of the position at lower price after the call when the issue was addressed on
the call...WC had dropped dramatically last year in a substantial improvement
over prior year which was too high, the return to normal level was reflected as
a q/q jump that hit cashflow. Didn't reinstate the full position because this
is a market that is very generous with 'buying opportunities' in case anyone
hadn't noticed.

steve h: In many ways this market IS more like 1929 than the 70's in that the
combination of a speculative bubble and corporate chicanery were the key drives
in 29 & now, unlike 74 where rising inflation and rates were more important

It looks like bad timing.

Applied Films is down 9% this morning. I think that in this market, you can
afford to be picky and only buy companies that have a profitable history. There
doesn’t seem to much interest here, so send any comments over to the AFCO
thread. Why speculate when so many good companies are available cheap?

You can triple your money in the next year in Safeway or Kroger, so that’s a
better bet for people who don’t have the time to research tech stocks in
complex businesses. I live in a city of 120,000 people, and Wal-Mart’s
competitors are now reacting by starting the development process earlier. It
took Wal-Mart 4 years to complete the process for their supermarket, so I think
the others learned a lesson.

Most people don’t see a lot of difference between supermarkets, so they buy
food at the closest location. I think Wal-Mart’s market share gains will stop
soon because competitors are now anticipating population growth as early as
Wal-Mart.

well as international business. There currently appears to be a perfect storm
of low weather, cyclical and credit capacity problems, but electricity demand
is inelastic so as the economy comes back, weather is less friendly and the
power guys get liquid[When the brown-outs hit, funding will come out of the

back into the 30's based on a reasonable multiple of normal earnings

Are there any ideas anyone has now regarding thread pick of BAMM?

1. I am getting tired of holding it in this market!

Those on the thread who bought near lows (under 2) have had a chance to sell at
much higher prices. At current $3.30, the stock is still around 9/'01 levels.
It just doesn't seem to be going anywhere. (-g- That might be a positive - so
many stocks are much lower than last Sept.)

It's still a value stock (imo). Might even have a kicker potential with their
newsstand businesses. Maybe the stock could/might pop to 5 level again.

2. It just seems like other beat up stocks that are more widely-followed, and
maybe more respected, might do better (have better chance of share price rise)
if the market ever recovers.

3. For example, in looking to sell BAMM, I checked Barnes & Noble.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=bks&d=c&k=c1&t=2y&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

To me here is a bookseller, where if there's a recovery in stock prices, most
stock buyers would look at it much before BAMM. Foremost because BKS is much
larger and so, better-known.

Also there are some attractive aspects to BKS:
Margins are lousy (as one would expect from such a retailer), but revenue
increases keep cranking along:

http://quicken.com/investments/seceval/?cmetric=rev&p=bks

The chairman, Mr. Riggio, owns at least 15% of the company and is very
responsible for its growth. Apparently he is a good asset allocator,
judiciously creating and spinning off the dotcom Barnes & Noble and creating
and ipoing 37% of GameStop. According to an S&P report, this latter company is
"the largest U.S. video game and PC entertainment software specialty retailer".
I rushed a calculation that shows there's about $10/sh of GameStop in BKS share
price.

I'm tempted to swap BAMM for BKS. To me it almost seems like it could be a
tug-of-war between the young Buffett and Munger. Go with the value stock or go
with the stock where management seems to be very competent in growing the
business?

Anybody got any opinions on a course of action here?

BKS looks good on a valuation basis - less than 10 times next years

10% of the float. I wouldn't buy it until I found out why it was so heavily
shorted. Also a "strong sell" appeared this month which could also be
significant as that's still unusual.

Mr Money,

I found this passage

"The results of this estimation indicate that most of the variables are
significantly associated with
one-year returns (results not tabulated). After controlling for the other
variables, only ROA,
&#8710;ROA and CFO lacked statistical significance. All other variables were
significant in the
predicted direction, with &#8710;TURN, &#8710;LEVER and EQ_OFFER displaying the
strongest
association with future returns."

a little confusing when compared with the correlations with returns in Table 2
which showed almost the opposite. I know that significance and correlation are
not the same thing but they shouldn't be 180 degrees from each other.

About that report, mrcjmoney: Reads to me like a thesis submitted in
fulfillment of a master's degree. Enough F-scores there to sate any
statistician. -g-.

Nevertheless, there are some interesting conclusions. I admit to just glancing
through Mr. Piotroski's 63-pager, so my understanding of the report or the
significance of its conclusions may be very wrong.

Unlike what we talk about around here - price/book - the report uses the
inverse: Book value to Market price at year-end. That ratio is called BM. High
BM stocks are of interest to the author and to value investors. (A high BM
number equates to standard value criterion: low price-to-book.)
From what I can tell, the study is of high BM stocks grouped into several
categories to see which categories and relationships subsequently show the
better stock market performance.

p. 25: "Consistent with the findings of Lee and Swaminanthan (2000), this
analysis shows that the majority of the high BM portfolio's "winners" are in
the low share portfolio turnover.

p.38 (You have to look closely to find the conclusions section!) Apparently the
best stocks to search out and study (candidates for financial analysis) are the
high BM stocks of small and medium size firms with low share turnover and no
analyst following.

It seems that the strategy producing the greatest results is "buying expected
winners and shorting expected losers". (p.38) (I missed something, because I
didn't see how that conclusion follows from the tables and numbers and
calculations.)

While low price/book effect has been known for a long time, Fama (he's an
efficient-market type professor/researcher) has written that using the effect
as a basis for stock selection is risky because there is evidence that such
companies are selling the way they are (with low p/book) because they are the
very companies that have problems. (If I understand the argument correctly).
Anyway... Piotroski seems to take issue with that, at least in some instances
(p. 39).

There's also a discussion of how earnings announcements don't get factored
quickly into the stock price.

That's it...running out of steam for 2nite...

re: Arne Alsin

I will post what I feel Arne's investment ideas focus upon:

1) an extreme focus upon balance sheet issues (i.e., identifying Tyco's
leveraged balance sheet prior to the collapse)

2) a focus upon mid-cap firms (i.e., $750 million to $2 billion) in terms of
market cap

3) firms that offer a safe and adequate dividend (2-4%)

4) firms that are trading at an industry-specific trough and recognizing what
typical earnings will be when the industry has any improvement (industries
range from tech, apparel, machinery, -- any given industry)

5) a focus upon investment metrics (sales/xxxxx vs. industry peers: xxxxx = an
analysis that can be industry specific or a common tool that Arne uses for all
industries); he will post new comparisons on any given day

Arne provides a spreadsheet, commonly, showing his analysis, assumptions, and
rationale.

spade is a spade. Arne is one of the top value money managers, financial
(income statement, balance sheet, cash flow analysis) analysts out there. I

Arne Alsin Philosophy:
http://www.alsincapital.com/philosophy.html
I buy solid companies where there is a wide disparity between the stock price
and the value of the underlying company.

And I leave it at that. Predicting macro economic trends, technical analysis,
active trading, forecasting the direction of the market are beyond my ken -
and, in my opinion, a waste of time.

I have often said that there are only two kinds of companies - companies that
have problems, and companies that are going to have problems. Since I am
singularly interested in bargains, most of the companies I invest in are
struggling with problems. In my view, there are several advantages to this
value strategy:

Terrific stock prices: Too many investors project problems into the future in a
linear fashion, assuming they will never go away. Stocks of such companies are
generally heavily discounted.

Safety: To the extent the problems of a company are disclosed, the risk of a
negative surprise declines. And to the extent company problems enable an
investor to acquire a stock at a large discount, capital risk also declines.

Measurable Problems: Problems that are revealed can be analyzed and quantified.
You can't measure what is hidden. Companies that are struggling tend to put
everything on the table - it is an ideal time for management to clear the deck.

While I am the portfolio manager on all accounts, I am lucky to be able to work
with Glenn Surowiec, our senior analyst. It's rare to find the combination of a
natural instinct for value with an abundance of analytic talent - prior to
joining ACM, Glenn was a top quantitative analyst, specializing in derivatives,
for a Fortune 500 company.

Some nice moves in many stocks just suggested on this thread in the last few

cogitate. Guess that happens when opportunities seemingly abound.

Not a great day be buying imo (most stocks are being marked up), but I'll open
my wallet for a couple:

I'll start an exploratory position in DO today. I see DO as undervalued at
current price, but maybe due for a pullback because it's already quickly moved
up from its low a decent percentage (but only about 2-3 points). That's a small
number though compared to where the stock has been and can maybe go again (I
expect to hold it for 18 months or more to find out.)

Am I the third thread poster and buyer on DO?

I also will add a little here to my losing position in SWY.
Wal-Mart may stop the larger grocers' growth, but at SWY's p/e of 8, that seems
to me to be fully reflected in its price.

From:Paul Senior
Yes, UHAL never worked out for me. I believed in its potential, and I posted a
least a few times that I owned it. I held my shares for several years until
recently. Last week or so, I eliminated the dredges of my position.

There are a couple of lessons for me. One is that potential is okay, but
eventually results have to be forthcoming. A limit on patience is required.
I'll generalize here although it's always difficult to generalize from one
specific case - I've seen stocks do nothing for years as the companies behind
them went about their business until one day -- a big stock move. U-haul ranks
among the very, very top companies in brand recognition. They have or had many
opportunities to build on that with their self-storage facilities, insurance
tie-ins, and with other companies interested in finding U-Haul's customers. In
the last few years not much ever dropped to the bottom line from any of their
activities, including core truck rental. So perhaps I should have set a time
limit to how long I was willing to tie funds up in this stock while waiting.

But THE lesson I take away is this: When insiders are perceived to be
self-dealing, be VERY and EXCEPTIONALLY wary of investing in their company. The
deck is stacked against you. Perhaps I am misstating the situation. Management
either by bad luck or incompetence has made some business decisions that have
quickly, this year, drained their wonderful franchise of its value. Maybe
permanently (as the bad news and market decline seem to suggest) or maybe only
temporarily.

OTOH, as I understand the business activities of the controlling family, there
are many separate dealings with the company. It's something like this (I may
have some facts wrong here): one family member has the large contract with
Amerco (UHAL) for vehicle maintenance. One family member routinely buys real
estate from UHAL or sells real estate to UHAL. Or is the real-estate consultant
to UHAL. One family member has a printing business which counts UHAL as a big
customer. And of course, family members are employed in the top management
positions of UHAL. So if all this is true (which it might not be) and I knew
it, I have no excuse. The lesson is that no matter how good the business, when
you bet on owners who certainly don't seem to have the same interests as you
do, they can destroy shareholder value and your investment no matter how good
the potential is for the business. And of course - sigh - this was pointed out
to me people here when I posted here about UHAL.

Brendan Watt: again, nice move in some of the stocks you've mentioned just

I'm not comfortable with the business model as it appears to me: roll up of
individual orthodontic practices. Managing dentists is like managing medical
docs, I suspect, and there have been several companies that tried to do that
that have ultimately faired very poorly in the stock market. And the red flags
were similar to what you mentioned for OCA (accounting and management issues).

Still, it's my opinion that although the practice and techniques of the
orthodontia business might very well change, people will still see a need for
it. My poor parents scrimped for my sister and me. I see others doing similar.
Given OCA size and resources, it's possible that it might survive and thrive in
this business. Or maybe just fool everybody for a couple of more years -g-.

Sears and the Competition:

The WSJ had an interesting Sears article in the "Money and Investing Section"
today -- front page.

"S is for Sears -- and Subprime" by Jesse Eisinger

Summary of article is: Sears is a value trap despite the cheap 6.6x P/E
multiple. The article addresses the L.E. acquisition, Sear's ability to compete
against Kohls and others in the field, Sear's appliance division losing ability
to compete due to competition, cost structure of S, and the fact/implications
of 60% of Sears pre-tax earnings coming from its credit card division -- and
how the credit card holders are paying their Sears debt.

Who knows if it is a screaming bargain or a value trap? Surely not I. I know I
haven't shopped there for 20-years because I become severly depressed every
time I enter the store, I can find better prices elsewhere, and customer
service is lousy.

I don't know if you followed Al Frank (you did mention his passing a while
back), but today I was doing a little cleaning and came across his book "Al
Frank's New Prudent Speculator". I enjoyed the book and always enjoyed reading
his analysis.

Praise by Kenneth L. Fisher on book's back cover:

"Al Frank is one of the few truly fundamental thinkers on the financial scene.
Although often irreverent, his analysis of individual stocks is first rate and
his ideas are always worth any time you give them. I'd recommend this book to
anyone."

Paul: I looked at IPG, but the combination of totally blindsiding analysts,
lack of confidence in management and the numbers, insider selling,
liquidity/credit ratings concerns, and enterprise multiples that even before
the EPS cuts weren't in bargain territory keeps me on the sidelines.
From Lehman report: DOWNGRADING TO 3-UNDERWEIGHT BASED ON
1) continuous EPS misses and LIMITED CONFIDENCE IN ESTS;
2) further potential BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS;
3) probable credit rating downgrades; and
4) meaningful share price downside on new ests.
Lehman also questioned cash flow & cash flow trends.
Merrill: "Interpublic's pre-announcement last night went beyond our
imagination."
There were several comments to the effect of 'We don't think they face a
liquidity crisis' or 'We think they can survive' that imply there's some
serious ugliness on the the credit front...and we all know how that can play
out.
If one takes PE on today's revised est's, you get 13.4 on 02 and ~11 on
03...looks attractive...but there's little confidence in those estimates or the
management providing them. Running enterprise multiples that take into account
the 2.44 Billion net debt and you get 50x EBITDA, Negative EV/(EBITDA-CAPEX) &
EV/FCF ~25...combine that with cash flow trend concerns and liquidity
issues...looks like another 'value trap' to me & I've already jumped into too
many of those snake pits this year.

mrcjmoney: I have the same feelings about Sears as you. I do like their
Craftsman tools though. But the very few times I go there, I go there
reluctantly. I don't even buy my car batteries there anymore.

Company is profitable. Stock is selling at a low p/e. It's always come back
from lows. Everybody knows Sears. OTOH, knowing of Sears and shopping there are
different. Perhaps Sears should sell at low p/e's as do other subprime lenders
if S is indeed also one of them. (60% of pre-tax earnings from credit cards.)
Maybe the stock will recover from this point, but it's not clear to me that the
future of Sears is all that rosy.

Aren't there ANY catastrophe's of the day out there worth buying?? -g-

OTOH, I could say, "Why bother"? There seem to be a large enough number of very
excellent companies with decent to excellent prospects whose stocks are still
selling near multi-year lows. Perhaps THESE are the stocks to place bets on.
There'll always be third tier stuff, but the good stocks go on sale much less
frequently, it appears to me.

Paul -- re ruminations

"...but the good stocks go on sale much less frequently, it appears to me...."

I agree with this point. In the past couple of weeks, however, I have had some
luck with -- what I consider quality companies! (subject to my interpretation,
of course :) ). I've bought AIG in the $52 range, PEP in the $36 range, PFE in
the $28.50 range, WL in the $26 range, CINF in the low $30's range. I was very
comfortable with these companies, know them well, sit & collect the dividends,
and did not have any second thoughts about buying these companies. They,
amongst almost every other company in recent days, have had a tremendous run.

I have had, over the years, better luck waiting for the quality companies to
reach reasonable (not dirt cheap but trading at realistic P/E levels) prices
and buy. When I go for the cheap companies, they typically get cheaper and it
gets a little frustrating. This, however, does limit my chance for the big pay
day. My sleeping patterns have improved though.

Good to hear from you.

UHAL I looked at many times 3-5 years ago and passed (fortunately). I was very
close to buying it several times. What kept me away wasn't the corporate
governance, it was the balance sheet. Debt. Which brings on a thought I'd like
to share.

I was giving a speech yesterday and a business school student asked me why the
two companies I was highlighting have no debt. She pointed out that her finance
class taught her that debt provides a tax shield, so they're leaving money on
the table by being debt free. I responded something like, "Great, you saved $20
million in taxes. But you're bankrupt. Congratulations."

I do not like debt, and I like managements that don't like debt. Its not just
the financial leverage. I just find that managements that hate debt as much as
I do also have other characteristics I like, and managements willing to take on
massive amounts of debt have other characteristics I don't like.

Jim Clarke, thanks for those thoughts. There is a lot to be said for the mind
set of managers who disdain debt vs. those managers who pile on large or
massive amounts. That mind set difference rather than the debt itself, might,
as you suggest, be a very good reason for choosing no or low debt companies.

Interest rates are low; if a company could borrow and if they could earn above
their cost of capital, maybe they should borrow. On the one hand, the low
interest rate suggests a lower hurdle rate. OTOH, trying to make increased
sales and more profits in this economy is darn difficult. Borrowing presupposes
only a guess that the company will have those favorable earnings on those
borrowings.

I wonder. Perhaps I would be doing much better if I excluded high debt
companies from my consideration. They are often troubled companies, but value
stocks thereby. Ever diversified, the result for me is that I likely have more
bankrupt companies in my portfolio than any three other people here. (And they
weren't bk when I bought them.) Reason for almost all the bankruptcies: too
much hubris. (maybe by the companies, maybe (sigh) by me as an investor).
Corporate hubris is often exhibited and exacerbated by too much debt.

Fwiw, here are some companies on my watch list with very little debt. Sorry I
missed so many --- CINF, CMH (Drat. Again I missed it.), couple of clothing
companies and a couple of other stocks mentioned here. Sometimes it takes me
too long to make a decision. Perhaps there's still time as these companies
continue to move up from recent lows. (OTOH, maybe they'll retest.) I have NSI,
a small company with zero debt but it has some (if that is a word to use)
asbestos exposure. I am tempted to add just a little more at current low.

Paul,
Likely the only reason you have more bk companies is that you own more stocks
than most (maybe all) of us. The proportion is probably the same or close.

That's not to say zero debt companies might not be better investments -
although I've seen nothing but anecdotal evidence on the topic. Last year, I
tracked 2 portfolios of stocks that otherwise met an O'Shaughnessy screen. I
was expecting to prove to myself that a low debt to equity parameter would
improve the screen. Unfortunately, the opposite happened. Maybe it was just a
coincidence - no statistical significance?. Maybe it doesn't help in
conjunction with the other parameters of the screen (low P/S and high relative
strength)? Maybe the dropping interest rate environment was good for the high
debt companies? Maybe low debt doesn't matter but zero debt does? More
questions than answers.

After considering MLI more, I decided that I can't foresee the effect of a

re: Arne Alsin

i should mention that my comments were not on Arne as an investor, but on
whether i would pay attention to his "picks" in a venue like RealMoney.com.
when i see a low-beta value stock pop 10% in one day because it was somebody's
pick, then i know there is a heavy premium built into that "pick".

presumably, these kind of pops would not occur in his managed acct picks, so my
comments do not apply to his managed accts.

Average Return: Top-10 Turnarounds 2002 -19.96%
Average Return: S&P 500 -26.19%

i have noticed that a lot of value managers in recent years (since March 2000)
like to compare themselves to the SPX. whereas in 1999 they did not like to
make this comparison--presumably because the SPX kicked their butts.

any value manager with a pulse should have outperformed the SPX since March
2000. it does not say anything about their skill. it is simply asset
allocation.

value managers should not compare themselves to the SPX, since the SPX is a
large growth index. instead, they should compare themselves to either a large
value or small value index, as appropriate (or even a midcap value index).

another point i would make is that two or three years of "market-beating"
results say nothing regarding the persistence of an active investor's alpha.
moreover, it is fine to cherry-pick in hindsight the best past performers, but
as the prospecti say, "past performance is no guarantee of future performance".
this is the one statement you can know is true about any prospectus. so it
comes down to whether you can cherry-pick on an ex-ante basis. can you pick
tomorrow's Warren Buffett today? prolly not.

if you answered, "Just pick the REAL Buffett," then let me again refer you to
the clause about the past not predicting the future. also, i do not believe
hamburgers, Cherry Cokes, and ice cream are the diet i would choose to live a
long life.

hindsight cherry-picking is only of value if you can teleport your money back
to when the guy got his ball rolling (please send my capital to Warren Buffett
circa 1956), or if you believe the past predicts the future, which it does not.

of course, you can't blame an active manager for trying to look good. how else
are they going to earn their vig? the vig, or the management fee, is also as
certain as death and taxes. a 1% fee over a 30-year investment horizon adds up
to 30%. that is a lot of alpha to make up just to get back to square one.
transferring 30% of capital to management sounds like a good deal...for
somebody!

so if all that is certain is that the past does not predict the future and that
active managers will charge their (high, very high--especially in this
low-return environment) fees, what's a body to do?

thank God for Jack Bogle.

Scratch Tyco's Surface and You Might Not Like What You See

By Arne Alsin
Special to TheStreet.com
11/15/2001 07:31 AM EST

"At first glance, investing in Tyco (TYC:NYSE - news - commentary - research -
analysis) stock looks like a wonderful idea. It's hard not to salivate when
looking at Tyco's historical growth in earnings and cash flow, which are both
up an average of 30% a year over the past few years. The prudent investor,
however, knows better than to take such impressive numbers at face value.

After taking a peek behind the numbers at Tyco, you'll want to run, not walk,
away from this stock. 

The Business Model

Growth via acquisitions is generally a loser's game -- and Tyco is growing
principally through acquisitions. Last quarter, for instance, it boasted 29%
year-over-year growth, but this growth was almost entirely due to acquisitions.
Without acquisitions, Tyco's growth was a paltry 1%.

Why do I say growth via acquisitions is a loser's game? Because problems always
develop, generally on multiple levels. It could be a simple case of overpaying,
or integration problems or maybe an unforeseeable downturn in business.
Whatever the reason, history is replete with examples of giant companies --
AT&T (T:NYSE - news - commentary - research - analysis), Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq -
news - commentary - research - analysis) and Lucent (LU:NYSE - news -
commentary - research - analysis) to name a few -- that were humbled after
squandering billions to pursue growth via acquisitions.

Another reason to avoid Tyco stock is that this strategy of growing by
acquisitions is, by definition, only possible if the acquiring company has a
cheap currency to employ in acquiring companies.

In other words, either Tyco has an overvalued stock that it can use to acquire
other companies, or Tyco has an undervalued stock that can't be used for
acquisitions because it would be dilutive. If you look at the hundreds of
acquisitions recently made using Tyco's stock, it's apparent that Tyco's
management believes its stock is at least fully valued and certainly not
undervalued, and investors should take notice.

A final point: Investors should be careful not to look exclusively at earnings
growth at companies such as Tyco that subscribe to a robust acquisition
strategy for growth. A better way to evaluate Tyco's strategy is through an
ROIC (return on invested capital) analysis. This calculation looks at earnings
growth relative to balance-sheet growth. By my calculation, Tyco's average
four-year ROIC is less than 10%, well below its cost of capital.

How Financially Strong Is Tyco?

To the extent you can find a reasonable margin of safety supporting the stock
of Tyco -- and I certainly can't -- you aren't going to find it in the balance
sheet.

A close examination of its balance sheet reveals there's not much "there"
there. Assets are dominated by goodwill, which has ballooned fourfold between
1998 and today (from roughly $7 billion to $28 billion), because of all the
acquisitions the company has made.

The problem with goodwill is that it is a phantom asset. You can't sell it, you
can't spend it and you can't borrow against it. There is nothing there except
an accounting entry to back up the asset that we call goodwill.

Tyco commands an enterprise value of about $131 billion (market cap of $105
billion plus net debt of $26 billion), but how much is backed up by tangible
assets? Here it gets embarrassing. After deduction for goodwill, this $131
billion company has a tangible net book value of $3.5 billion, not much of a
cushion for the prudent investor.

Only time will tell if Tyco is the exception to the growth-through-acquisition
rule. Most of its acquisitions occurred in the last bull market, at the height
of asset price inflation, meaning it probably overpaid for most of them. That
fact alone, apart from all the other points I've raised, makes Tyco equity a
gamble not worth taking."

If you want to argue against that type of person, please be my guest.

i hope to set things off on a better foot this time.
i think you may have misinterpreted my message, or perhaps i wasn't clear. i
have nothing against Alsin--i was talking about my opinion of a certain venue
for picks. i further made other statements that are almost truisms of modern
portfolio theory (namely, that value managers exist in a value universe, not
the SPX universe). but these things are not arguing "against that type of
person".

actually, your posts on Alsin have intrigued me to read more of his stuff on
Realmoney (though not the pay-per-view stuff), so it wasn't wasted breath.

i would need to see his record over his entire career, benchmarked against the
relevant value index to comment on his record. but i agree with you that safety
and dividends are "good things".

And I don't know anyone who has done better than Arne-- long-only and
non-leveraged -- 

i'm not sure what period of time you're talking about--do you mean just this
year? and i'm not sure who's being included or excluded. do you want to include
long-only bond funds? if so, may i introduce you to the $68BILLION Pimco fund
and the always entertaining Bill Gross.

if we allow value managers to be benchmarked against the SPX, then we might as
well let bond managers benchmark against it as well.

i am curious about the qualifier "long-only and non-leveraged". is it to
exclude others who did better?

in my opinion, either one should talk about managers within their particular
asset classes, or one opens up the floodgates.

w/r/t his prescient comments on Tyco, that could have been valuable information
for an active manager, but not very valuable for one who is "long-only".
(assuming that we are talking about managers smart enough to screen out TYC as
a long pick last year, as Arne obviously was).

basically, an active manager screens out a lot of stocks anyway. an active
value manager could exclude MSFT because its PSR is too high. and TYC doesn't
make the cut either. just another filter.

practically speaking, the only reason to drill down past the screening stage
(to the point of uncovering some potential bombs like Arne seemed to have done)
is if one is considering a short candidate.

based on the TYC share prices you listed, it seems Arne could've done quite
well for his clients by shorting TYC at 57.55 on 11/15/2001. i imagine the
return would have rivaled his better long picks.

speaking of which, there have been a lot of good short candidates this year. i
have found it much easier to make money on the short side than the long side
(surprise, surprise). so why would one exclude short/long as a valid strategy?

i can better comprehend excluding leveraged portfolios (although my best
results came from very heavy leveraging on the long side in 99), because that
is a very risky strategy.

but right now, where i have an unleveraged portfolio and consider 1% to be a
"full" position and 2% to be "huge", i don't see how being short 5% against 25%
long is greatly increasing my risk. in fact, i think it decreases my risk
because there is considerable negative covariance between the shorts and the
longs in my portfolio. obviously a personal decision for each investor, but i
don't consider that kind of short/long approach to be incomparable to a
long-only portfolio.

which brings me to a bigger issue: we critique equity managers for whether they
have a positive or negative alpha or whatever, over a given time span, but
naturally the greater determinant of results is what the equity allocation is
in the first place.

in my opinion, even many "smart" active managers really take a conventional
approach to equity allocation, and do not take it nearly as seriously as they
take the act of choosing their picks. however, imho, the mark of a truly
valuable manager is one who does a good job at the bond/equity ratio setting
juncture, as this will have the largest impact on client returns. 

conventional wisdom holds that equity allocation be 110 minus your age or
something. in my case (mid 30s), that would mean my equity allocation would be
around 75%, and bonds 25% (maybe a little cash on the side). if i had followed
this strategy, then it is highly likely i would have had bad returns this year,
regardless of the equities i picked.

however, simply by having a low equity allocation, i have been able to do OK
despite the bear market. in fact, i could have lost ALL my money on my longs
and i still would be better than the market.

so obviously, the equity/bond ratio is much more important to the returns one
gets than the particular equities one picks. sometimes i feel investors lose
the forest for the trees. they get caught up in the intricacies of this or that
system--whether it is technical analysis or some type of fundamental
analysis--without stepping back to look at the big picture.

personally, i find different equity analysis approaches quite intellectually
interesting. even TA! and even though i admit that indexing is probably the
intellectually correct choice. but i try to keep the big picture in mind as
well. because it seems we are in a "big picture" kind of market.

and the big picture has been telling me for a couple years now that the
greatest bull market in US history is over, and valuations remain higher than
at the PEAKS of past bull markets. smart people like Jeremy Grantham have shown
that every bubble gives back EVERYTHING that was gained in the mania.

the farther i zoom out in history, the less i feel that our correction is
"over". every past bubble has ended in a negative 10yr return, whereas our own
trailing 10yr return is still in the high single-digits. having a megabear end
with 10yr trailing returns as high as they are would be like ending a bear
market with a PE of 25, in my opinion.

meanwhile, all the pension fund stuff is just starting to hit the fan. what
does that say about quality of earnings on the market? people keep saying the
SPX will make $59 next year or whatever, so the forward PE is low. but if you
look at several other ways to do the accounting, earnings will be in the $35
range.

that implies a PE of around 25, and that's before all the pension stuff, which
the CSFB guy says could cost US corporations an enormous sum. i think earnings
will continue to come down in this environment.

meanwhile, demand for stocks is likely to wane, imo, as Joe 6P realizes his
401k has been slaughtered and takes a look at all the scam artists populating
corporate America.

so i think about those kind of things. perhaps they aren't as interesting as
some innovative cash-flow model or dividend discount formula, but i think they
matter more in a "big picture" market.

I would care to review/critique a Kevin Landis, a Munder fund, anyone long
wcom/ene/flm/lhsp 

as i recall you are an admirer of Longleaf, so i assume you are familiar with
their championing of FLM. it appears Longleaf is standing by their pick. here
is what they wrote in their just-released third-quarter review:

"Fleming is by far the most controversial
company we hold, with the largest short position in it that we have ever
experienced as an owner. Whether the shorts end up being right or wrong, their
actions are also unprecedented. Their influence in the press, their activism in
spreading negative stories, and their personal attacks on Fleming executives
represent a level of aggressiveness that is fairly unusual in normal markets."

i would be interested in your take on Longleaf's continued support of FLM.

Read their latest press release. They mention sales growth slowing and give a

The company says, "we would expect to see substantially slower sales growth
next year while continuing to generate profits comparable to 2002."

Of course, thestreet.con , has entered the ring with an opinion,
" The beginning of the end for any one-hit wonder, especially in the world of
exercise equipment, comes when it has to spend more money to sell each unit.
Investors learned that lesson with Nordic Track maker CML Group, which
subsequently filed for bankruptcy."

The research report mentions that the ASPs for the bowflex increased in the

No debt. Insiders not selling. I think perhaps the stock's been beaten up too
much, so I took a small position awaiting further looking. Inventory not out of
line, receivable OK too. I don't see any black marks, except the reliance on
the bowflex line. But with no debt, BK is not looming. Maybe thestreet took a
short position before the article?

Any opinions and deep, probing, analysis would be appreciated. :o)

Bob, have you listened to the MCD CC? I have mixed feelings. What they're
talking about doing sounds sensible, but it worries me that they're describing
it as a "short term" strategy (i.e. set the core business right so they can
afford once again to invest in idiotic non core ventures). The US guy sounds
like he's competent, and we're being promised great things for the dollar menu
program. Management is also implying that the MFY kinks have been worked out
(though for the MCD's around me, the shake machines are still a major problem.
I talked to one manager who said she had to have them come in at least once a
week to fix the thing).

The big news was their announcement that they were cutting back in many
overseas areas, esp. Asia Pacific (excluding China), and Latin America, and
redirecting capital to upgrading U.S stores, both company owned and franchised.
In broad strokes it all made sense, but the details are murky, and I certainly
do not trust management to get it right.

Also, maybe I'm just prejudiced, but Greenberg's opening statement really
bothered me. Referring to last month he said "To our people, [last month] feels
like the longest month in our history. The stock market's reaction... has been
painful and upsetting." He makes it sound like management errors had nothing to
do with it, and that the real problem was the drop in stock price. He later
goes on to say "[for the past two years] cyclical factors have negatively
affected us". Give me a break. I guess Wendy's and Yum exist in an alternate
universe. He also, rather wistfully, noted at the end of the call that no one
had asked about the new "3 in 1" concept which they're testing in Lincoln,
Nebraska. From the description, it sounds like they're trying to combine a
Boston Market and McDonalds in a single store and adding a dessert section.
Maybe it makes sense, maybe it doesn't, but I certainly wouldn't look for it to
save the company. The fact that Greenburg felt compelled to mention it just
shows me, once again, that he will never be happy just running a fast food
hamburger chain - which means he is the wrong man for this job.

Despite my distrust of management, I did like most of what they said they were
going to do next year, though I think they're doing the right things for the
wrong reasons. It still remains to be seen if they can walk the talk.

Mark: Haven't listened to CC yet, but read some analyst reports: LEH negative,
thinks street is too high. JP Morgan is so so: Likes operational improvements
but sees some challenges, Merrill is, as always on MCD, positive looking for
return to premium multiples as visibility increases. 137k mystery shopper and
other measures to improve quality were mentioned...but no measurable increase
in sales have resulted. Burger Kings .99 menu isn't negatively impacting nearby
stores. Merrill favorably mentions some new salads coming. That and other
premium sandwich offerings will probably help offset margin erosion form $1
menu.
No mention of my central quandry: Is speed of service a real & pervasive
problem? The survey's I posted here indicate, IMO, it's really not...except for
WEN which has improved dramatically, they're in line. But anecdotal experience
and comments indicate it's a big problem. The article linked below discusses
the shift to 'made fresh' from anticipating demand, which would imply a
substantial slowdown.
Greenberg is a former Arthur Andersen accountant, not a restaurant guy....which
is ok IF he can hire really good restaurant guys to run operations in the MCD
tradition. I don't see this to be the case, unfortunately. This looks like a
'treading water' story until Europe and Japan forget 'Mad cow' and Latin
America revives, IMO. The quality moves won't drive growth...they'll just
prevent further decline. Pinning a revival on fat price cuts, the new $1 menu,
isn't the answer...competitors will just match it...as they have.

Refineries: generally have been lousy businesses for the past 20 years or so.
For investors in the sector, they have always been wrong (it seems to me) if
they bought because they believed rising demand finally caught up with a
limited but overhanging supply of refining capacity.

I find the sector attractive at current price. In addition to small positions
in HOC and TSO, I have a little VLO. Brendan Watt, as you likely know about
VLO, after you mentioned it here two weeks ago it's moved up a good percentage
(up 33%, from about 24 to 32), but is still a distance from where it was
trading earlier this year.

At current price, I've decided to buy ASH. The new CEO seems to talk strongly
about focusing on core business and on stockholder returns. The stock has sold
at higher levels than current every year in the past decade. There's a $1.10
sh. dividend (4%+) that's been in place for the last 8 or 9 years.
I started a tiny position; I'll add more if stock will drop with no
accompanying adverse news.

Bob, I'm not necessarily looking for growth. If they can just manage the
business properly and pay me a nice fat dividend, I'll be very happy. I'm not
convinced that McDonald's growth days are over, but the wrong kind of growth is
worse than no growth. MCD's core competency is (or should be) burgers, drinks,
and fries. If they focus on that, growth opportunities will either come or not
come, and either way the business will be fine. All the other stuff is a
distraction. That's why it drives me crazy to hear them describe their
refocusing as a "short term strategy". That's the way they should be running
the business in perpetuity.

I swear they should take Pret a Manger, Chipotle's, Boston Market, etc., spin
them off as a unit, and put Greenberg in charge of the whole shebang. He'd
probably be happier that way, and MCD would certainly be a much better company.
Heck, if they did spin it off they should probably keep an equity stake, it
might end up being a pretty good company.

I stuck with SOFN as well (I don't think blankmind did), and it is approaching
my original price estimates. I would like to hold on for some long-term gains
(and defer my taxes to next year) in addition to I am curious how the venture

Some other stocks I have mentioned, VCNT, ISTN, PRTS have done quite well,

Jim Clarke: Thanks for alerting me to ASH's asbestos issue. I've gone back and
relooked:

9/7/2 filing:

"The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to accurately
predict the results of the ultimate resolution of asbestos claims. However,
considering the foregoing and amounts already provided for, and given our
historical litigation experience on resolved asbestos claims, the substantial
amount of insurance coverage that Ashland has available from its insurance
carriers and expected contributions from other responsible parties, Ashland
does not believe that any liability resulting from environmental remediation,
open asbestos-related claims or other legal proceedings will have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, cash flows or
liquidity."

1. They say they have a "significant number" of claims.

2. The above quote refers to "open" claims. I suspect new claims continue to be
filed. How ASH might be affected by these, is unknown.

3. The above blurb may be ASH's most favorable guess about "the uncertainties
of asbestos claim litigation".

4. "Expected contributions from other responsible parties"? Ha. I'd just like
to see those other guys' opinions about that.
==========================================

About $27 is a wonderful buy price for this company. Sigh... except for that
one issue. On balance, it's not worth it to me. I leave it for more courageous
or more knowledgeable folk. Sold my exploratory position this am.
=================================
I've come to agree with you on these asbestos problems. I bought (and still
have) NSI figuring the asbestos issue was adequately reserved for. NSI stock
has declined, a worsening asbestos issue being a contributing factor. Somebody
here (you?) also warned me about CBE's asbestos exposure, and I was able to get
out before the company announced additional claims which sent their stock down
sharply. (And it hasn't recovered). For me, it seems the most fitting equation
is: Asbestos=Avoid

Restarted WMI today @20.55. Management is solid. Several initiatives are in
place to increase efficiencies...though there's some execution risk on IT
projects. A jump in fuel costs [Iraq], further reduction in recycled paper
prices, continued economic weakness are potential negatives. The flip side of
those would be positive and all will occur over time. With enterprise multiples
on free cash flow a bit above 13, this looks like a decent entry point,
although the nearterm chart is negative.

"several stocks trading near or below net cash"

Good morning gcrispin,

It was an interesting article. But I still take issue with a good cash balance
and a significant burn rate. If a company doesn't have a profitable business
model, or even a a break cash flow -- then I have to pass.

"...The companies of the Riley Cash-Rich Tech Stock index were chosen because
of their cheap valuations, strong balance sheets and core technologies. But
after meeting with many management teams, the research firm has found
management and board leadership all over the map...

...In 2001, management (of Stamps.com) concentrated on getting its burn rate
under control by cutting costs. The quarterly burn is now about $700,000..."

I second that notion, on ALSC!

How much would you pay for a $138M savings account (current assets minus all
liabilities) that is losing $80M per year? They are losing $20M a quarter on
$4M sales, with hugely negative gross margins. In my opinion, the company is in
disastrous shape - MUCH worse than ATML which the market took down to 60 cents
(before a major rally) because of concerns they won't be able to pay off their
debt coming due over the next several years.

TIBX which I publicly recommended elsewhere before its recent rally was a sound
speculation of this type, with a mountain of cash, a clear leadership position
in its niche, and not losing money. I also think that LTBG is a similar
situation at recent prices in the $5's.

http://messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&action=m&board=7082814&tid=ltbg&sid=708281
&mid=2789

The key thing these articles do not address is that you have to consider the
value of the business relative to the cash. For example, why would you want to
consider a stock with $10 per share of cash and a business worth $1, even if it
was selling below cash and not losing money, unless it had stated plans to
liquidate. You are buying a large risk as to what they will do with the cash. I
don't like odds like that. A better way to look at these companies is to look
for ones selling at the value of the business with major excess cash thrown in
for free. That is the LTBG situation, in my opinion.

....................

A comment on companies with debt, which was discussed earlier. Debt makes no
sense with a highly cyclical business, like airlines, electronic contract
manufacturers, semiconductor equipment, steel, etc. As far as I am concerned, a
company in those industries with a lot of debt has both a bad business strategy
and bad management - as they are constantly betting the company on never having
a major recession in their industry. However, I see nothing wrong with
reasonable amounts of debt in non-cyclical businesses, with decent gross
margins and cash flow.

Apparently the increase in Other Assets was associated with a euro hedge closed
