The thing about TMA is it very much reminds of LUM.

Which made The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week

Lights Out at Luminent

Luminent Mortgage Capital spoke too soon.
Luminent shares lost three-quarters of their value Tuesday after the San
Francisco-based real estate investment trust suspended its quarterly dividend.
The company had claimed only a week earlier that it would pay the dividend.

"The mortgage industry, and the financing methods that the mortgage industry
relies upon, have deteriorated significantly and in an unprecedented fashion,"
Luminent said in a press release Monday evening. "Effectively, the secondary
market for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities has seized-up."

If that's unusually colorful language for a press release, consider Luminent's
predicament. The company now finds itself "considering the full range of
strategic alternatives," Wall Street-speak for trying to find a buyer. Luminent
got default notices Wednesday from two lenders.

It wasn't long ago that Luminent was promising to rise above the mortgage mess.
Back on July 30, Luminent responded almost archly to a distress signal from
rival mortgage player American Home Mortgage. When American Mortgage announced
plans to conserve cash in the face of margin calls, Luminent responded by
claiming that its own dividend "is secure and will not be canceled."

"Luminent is not subject to the loan repurchase risk that is currently
impacting certain loan originators," the company sniffed. "Instead, Luminent
purchases high quality mortgage loans from originators, and only after Luminent
conducts exhaustive due diligence on each and every loan."

A lot of good that did them.

Dumb-o-Meter score: 82. Maybe the company was just all tuckered out after all
that due diligence

(Id like to take a position but after my 100% loss in AHM, my big loss in CBF
and watching luminent tank 90%, Im just plain out chicken)

Added to my MOT position at $16.60. It seems that I keep buying at lower
prices. I now have 1/2 of my position established. Hopefully the stock will
stabilize and next year MOT will be selling in the $20's. The dividend pays
1.2% which is better than nothing. Most tech companies pay nothing. I own NOK,
PLT Intc, MOT, BRCD,LSI,VRGY, HWP,SUNW and A as my basket of high tech stocks.
They make up about 10% of the taxable portfolio.

I plan to peel off shares of my NOK which I bought in 2005 (around $13) that is
now trading at the upper end of its value range (over $30). Before I sell, I
want to add some other international stocks to maintain my foreign stock
exposure.

Any suggestions on a pure international play? I have been adding ABB but it
really is not a true value proposition. I have been thinking of GE as it has a
large percentage of its sales outside the U.S.. I do not particularly need a
high tech company but thought there might be an international player that
participates in the global infrastructure build out.

EKS

FWIW, I doubled up on WON at $2.95 as the sell off was not warranted. Their
sales are down as expected and management maybe sees them stabilize by Q4. They
are still free cash flow positive (about $1.00/share) and if you discount this
over the next several years, its worth between $6-$8 per share. The key is if
things have stabilized or not at these much lower revenue numbers.

Once the sub-prime problem works its way through the system, I believe
investors will be focused on international growth again. The U.S. dollar will
continue to lag the other currencies.

GE. Always an issue of how long somebody would be in for. Forward p/e is very

and long term.

I have GE. I'll hold, and I'd add closer to $30 than I would be a buyer now (at
$38.27).

I have a Vanguard annuity that holds a Vanguard International Fund. I'm
satisfied with this Fund's performance over the few years it's been in the
annuity. (I'm not saying it's a super duper fund compared to other

I looked at CRMT after it was mentioned here some time ago and/or I saw some
insider buying.

Im not confident that their model is sustainable. I believe their reserve for
losses is too small and their customer is EXACTLY the kind of folks that have
subprime mortgages...or worse. Probably worse.

The buy here pay here car business does not work well as a chain. It needs the
HANDS ON of an owner or family. Otherwise, too many people have a vested
interest in getting people into cars without regard to their ability to pay for
it.
Also, corporate car buyers are often "on the take". The car auctions often have
$100 or $200 CASH sales whereas whenever you buy one of their cars, they hand
the buyer cash.

That just means they overpaid for the car and the buyer stole money from the
company but its a regular occurance on the auction scene.

A long time ago, it was tried on a grand scale.... called Urcarco. They failed
bigtime and later morphed itself into Americredit. And, suprisingly, it didnt
do too bad.

Apparently, they used their data from all their losses in the buy here pay here
car business to construct a good model and then got into loaning only...to
subprime borrowers.

Did pretty well once they got the heck out of the car business and strickly
into the paper business.

Its at a 2 year low by the way.

UNTD,

I usually don't give in to these wild speculations, but I have heard rumours
from several sources (including WSJ) about quant funds having to unwind
positions. I think quant funds may have been invested in UNTD (for example
Rennaissance Tech has been a holder) and were liquidating the past few days.
Once the liquidation pressure let off, the stock rebounded.

I have noticed some huge volatility in several of my stocks (SFN another one),
which tend to be lower Price/Book and/or high dividend and/or high Price/Cash
Flow, which typically quant funds like to buy. They were way up today and down
the prior few days.

However, this could be largely my imagination.

EKS, FWIW, The Schwab Equity Rating for GE since Aug 3 is a grade of D, meaning
Sell. (Schwab Equity rating system has performed very well relative to other
systems in the last few years.)

The system is based on several criteria for Fundamentals, Valuation, Momentum
and Risk. For this week and last, GE got poor scores on the following
fundamentals that are given a high priority: Free cash flow generation and
growth; efficient mgmt of capital; and ability to fund capital.

In the valuation section, high importance is attributed to balance sheet
valuation, for which GE received a Neutral rating.
However, there have been recent purchases by informed investors, another
valuation category ranked as Medium in importance. GE received a high score
there. (So you seem to be thinking along the same lines as other good informed
investors here!)

In the momentum category, I read you as not too interested in that category,
but, FWIW, GE gets a mixed review there.

In the Risk category, defined as Company size and stability, and weighed as
Medium in importance, GE gets high marks the last couple of weeks.

I had entered GE a month ago for the very reasons you had mentioned: blue chip
with great international exposure. And I believe a positive Barrons article.
Got spooked this week during the downdraft and sold off after checking the
Schwab rating.

GE got poor scores on "ability to fund capital"? I'm under the impression a
strength of GE is its excellent ability to get capital at low rates. It's a
competitive advantage I am to believe. If "ability to fund the capital" means
what they do with the capital after they get it, maybe that's so. Mr. Immelt
though is selling what he perceives to be poorer growth businesses, and
allocating to areas where he/they believe growth prospects are better -
aircraft engines/water infrastructure/etc.

Agree though that Schwab rating system seems to give very good results. Maybe
tops. I just don't agree with or understand, the GE rating of "sell".

the viability (growth) of that business just seems so iffy now. (And the people

There will ALWAYS be a market for BHPH cars.

Its just the low cost operators that make the money at it.

That means you cant have a $75,000 a year general manager for each location.
You cant have a few $60,000 + all you can steal buyers. You cant have
commissioned sales people who only get paid on the sale rather than with each
payment.

You cant pay a repo service the same rates that GMAC does, you do it yourself
or have some low waged folks doing it for you.

You've also got to have affordable mechanics. You cant pay guys $40-50k a year
to work on your cars.

The keys with BHPH is the car HAS TO LAST. When it stops running, the customer
stops paying. The customer also stops paying when he loses his job or his kid
gets sick and has to go to the hospital and so on and so forth.

The problem is you just cant expand to multiple locations & keep expenses in
check. Oh, sure, maybe a guy can manage 3-4 locations with the help of friends,
family & employees he has had for years in a city but on a grander scale, its
almost impossible to do it right because doing it right eats all the profit up.

Its HARD too. Most of the people get paid weekly. A few every 2 weeks. Thats
how you HAVE to get them to pay. Every payday.

These people cannot save up and pay once a month. (except fixed income folks
that get monthly checks) Impossible. Too many competing places for that money
to go.

That being said, I own shares in STEN which is pretty much trying to get into
both the BHPH business and financing business.

They are willing to pay 13-15% on notes. I think they overpaid bigtime to get
into the business and I think they are overpaying for borrowing. Im just not
sure he knows what he is doing. What is STENs competitve advantage ? I cant
tell you.There are dozens of firms that have been buying subprime paper for
years. They have experience. Why would someone use STEN ? Only reason I can
think of is because they might be willing to buy paper others wouldnt.
Supposedly, they can put back the repos to the dealer but they are also
floor-planning the dealers which makes me wonder if their reserve isnt
painfully low.

Im afraid to ask the CEO because Im afraid he doesnt know and has visions of
grandeur regarding the profit potential.

But, the CEO buys everytime the stock pulls back and he offered some pretty big
forecasts for a $4 stock...

"Given the current expectation for growth at STEN Credit, the company is
projecting an overall 2008 net earnings per share in the $.30-$.50 per share
range, and under current assumptions for fiscal 2009, STEN earnings are
expected to grow more than 100% from this level in the 2009 fiscal year."

They also raised cash in a private placement with Lyle Berman & another guy who
owns a chain of payday loan places. They each bought a bunch at $4.50 over a
year ago. Before this new business was bought into & started up.

I made a bunch following Berman into LACO years ago.

If STEN goes belly-up, Im going to be able to say I saw it coming. I guess Im
hoping he knows what he is going despite no experience. Maybe I'll dump it if
we get a pump & dump. These low float stocks are good for occasional pump &
dumps.

Of course, the SEC cracked down on some of the scammers so theres less of it
now.

He owns about a million worth of stock so he has more skin in the game that I
do. As do Berman and the other guy. (A million each - 222,222 shares at $4.50
each.)

such huge financing operations, they act like banks, but without the regulatory

Hi Mark - I was looking at other infrastructure plays but many of them have
already had huge moves in the last 18-24 months. I hate to buy at the top.
Pollution control is an area that may see growing demand especially from these
countries that are installing new coal fired plants. China in particular will
need this technology.

It appears I am late to this theme too. FTEK is a US company that has some very
interesting technology that allows coal burning generators to burn cleaner.
http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/20/magazines/fsb/FSB100_fuel_tech.fsb/index.htm
Their technology is used in the U.S. and there is speculation that China is
interested. The stock is no value play, earns very little, revenue growth is
actually down (YOY) but the company carries no long term debt.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/co?s=FTEK

Foster Wheeler is another name that came up that is in the same industry
according to Yahoo. The stock is already up over 400% since 2005 but YAHOO
shows a 15 forward PE.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=FWLT

They have had excellent quarterly revenue growth and only $3/share debt.

I do not own any of these companies other than starting a position in ABB.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=abb
Their forward PE is 15, have only $1.00/share long term debt and are generating
almost $2.00/share EBITDA. As long as business remains strong (according to
last conference call they have 18 months backlog), they should generate higher
profits.

I will have to study MTW. It has had a huge run too, up from $10 in 2003 to
over $70. I would have to agree with you that buying now is probably closer to
the top of the current cycle than the low.

re FRE I wonder if the real winner could be capital strong Banks that can
afford to keep loans on their book. While you can still get a FNM/FRE loan for
up to 417K for 6.7% (30 year) you have to pay 7.6% if you go beyond that
amount. So i think FNM?FRE is underpricing risk while the interest rates for
the JUMBO ought to be attractive. I think the borrowers who qualify today are
fairly good risks. This bank that sells jumbos need to keep the mortgages on

Thornburg Mortgage Announces Change of Second Quarter Dividend Payment Date to
September 17
Tuesday August 14, 4:04 pm ET

SANTA FE, N.M.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Thornburg Mortgage, Inc. (NYSE: TMA), a
leading single-family prime residential mortgage lender focused principally on
the jumbo segment of the adjustable rate mortgage market, announced today that
its Board of Directors has rescheduled the payment date of the company's second
quarter common dividend of $0.68 per share to September 17, 2007. By September
17, the company will receive its scheduled monthly mortgage payments for August
and will have had more opportunity to manage through this difficult
environment. The dividend was originally scheduled to be paid on August 15,
2007 to shareholders of record on August 3, 2007, as previously noted in the
company's second quarter earnings announcement on July 19, 2007.

The Board of Directors said it took this action in response to significant
disruptions in the mortgage market which resulted in the sudden and
unprecedented decline in the market prices of its AAA-rated mortgage securities
that began on August 9, 2007 and subsequent increase in margin calls related to
its repurchase agreement financings on those securities. There have also been
disruptions in the company's ability to fund its mortgage assets in the
commercial paper and the asset-backed securities markets. To date, the company
has successfully met all of its commercial paper obligations. Finally, the
company has also experienced delays in its ability to fund mortgage loans to
its lending partners.

Commenting on the Board's decision, Larry Goldstone, the company's president
and chief operating officer, said, "After extensive deliberation, and
acknowledging the severity of the situation, the Board determined that the best
way to preserve shareholder value in the near term and grow it over time is to
retain our cash to enhance our ability to work with our lenders and weather
this tumultuous environment. We will continue to monitor the situation."

Mr. Goldstone continued, "After careful analysis of the current value of our
mortgage securities portfolio, we believe that our book value, which includes
recent changes in the market value of our mortgage securities and liabilities
is $14.28 per share as of August 13, 2007 versus $19.38 per share as of June
30, 2007. The majority of that book value decline has occurred over the past
week, and is not a reflection of a change in the credit quality of our mortgage
assets. As such, and barring substantial additional decline in the market value
of mortgage-backed securities, we will continue to originate and invest in
high-quality mortgage assets once we get through this environment. While this
market event represents a disappointing setback for us and our shareholders, we
will rebuild when the environment stabilizes."

"Thornburg Mortgage has successfully managed through challenging market
environments in the past, and we are applying our experience to preserve as
much shareholder value as we can. We are exploring a variety of strategies to
help preserve shareholder value, including the opportunistic sale of our
mortgage assets. Despite the uncertainty of the current market environment, we
believe that the future profitability of the mortgage business is likely to be
far superior to what we've experienced over the last several years, as this
environment has eliminated substantial market competition from numerous
mortgage originators and investors. As evidence of our confidence in the
long-term success of the company, management has purchased over 500,000 shares
over the past three weeks. Nonetheless, the company remains affected by the
industry-wide liquidity squeeze, and unfortunately, we cannot predict when
stability and rational behavior will be restored in the mortgage markets."

Mr. Goldstone continued, "Our credit quality is among the highest in the
industry, our assets among the most liquid of any financial institution, and
our client orientation is without parallel in the mortgage industry. We take
great pride in the integrity with which we operate, we have developed a strong
mortgage lending franchise, and we fully expect to emerge from this
unprecedented environment well positioned to continue building on our strengths
as a lean, nimble operating company that benefits all of our constituents."

!

I had a buy order at $8.01 that I cancelled when I heard the bonds fell from
82.5 cents to 61.5 cents on the dollar.

They talk as if they expect to be around. They may be, but the new shareholder
may be the current debtholders.

Another 2 weeks like the last one and their book value could disapear.

The dividend is toast. Maybe they pay out a penny or two if they havent went
bankrupt by then.

Not sure what they mean by an aaa mortgage security. I wonder how they compute
a book value if there is no market for stuff they own. That is certainly an
unusual pr. Looks like Helmers comments about repo margin calls were dead on.
When I spoke to ras investor relations, one of the concerns they expressed to
me was making sure they had sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls on repos.
What I wonder about is : do the companies that survive this thrive or is this

Back of the envelope calculus shows that like others TMA uses a leverage of
about 21x and has a balance sheet of nearly 54B in bonds. After the write off,
the leverage reaches nearly LTCMish 30x.

If they write down their book by 26% (from 19.38 to 14.28) then they marked
down their portfolio overall by 1.17%.
This doesn't sound very much of a revaluation, except if they have the best
rated pieces of MBS which in turn have the best underlying assets. In this
case, one percent is a lot.
If they had worse tranches then they would likely not survive.

In absolute terms the liquidity amounts or potential margin calls are still
staggering.
a 1.2% loss in equity would mean that equity was reduced by 630MM.
It also means that lenders would require significant liquidity if they asked
TMA to post required cash margin to a level that a certain lower leverage or
coverage is restored.
I have no idea how much lenders would require from TMA.

KKR Sells $5.1 Billion Mortgage Loans
Wednesday August 15, 9:17 am ET
KKR Records $40 Million Loss to Sell Off Nearly Half of Its Residential
Mortgage Portfolio

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Specialty finance firm KKR Financial Holdings LLC said
Wednesday it sold about $5.1 billion in residential mortgage loans as it
continues to divest residential real estate assets.

The sale of the mortgages and related interest rate swaps held for hedging
purposes will result in a $40 million loss for KKR.

KKR Financial operated as a real estate investment trust until May 2007, which
required it to derive at least 75 percent of the company's gross income from
real estate assets. Since transforming to a limited liability company, KKR has
moved to divest itself of all residential mortgage holdings.

KKR still owns about $5.8 billion in mortgage loans, most of which are held as
mortgage-backed securities. KKR will continue to sell off its mortgage
portfolio while also allowing some of the loans to come off the books through
regular principal payments.

Investors have been shying away from mortgages in recent months as delinquency
and default rates rise, especially among subprime loans -- mortgages given to
customers with poor credit history. Dozens of mortgage lenders, including some
that operated as real estate investment trusts, have gone out of business as
liquidity in the market has disappeared.

I relooked at ABK and realized that I have no clue what kind of "financial

book value now, but I am not confident at all I can analyze this company or
expect that they won't have significant losses in the current debacle. They may
be very smart and only win, or they might have been aggressive and lose a lot.
Impossible to say for me. So I am removing it from my stock universe.

OK, so now I will turn around and ask: anyone has opinion about COF? This one
is also trading around book value. Anyone knows its exposure to mortgages? Is
it just being shot due to the debt market tightening? Seemed like a great
company for quite a while, so I wonder if this is an opportunity to get it
cheap.

EDIT: With a deeper look, I think I will not go with this one either. If you
subtract goodwill, it is not really trading at book value. And the leverage is
quite huge, which again means that you would have to understand how well it is
managed, since it could kill the company if it's not managed well.

Moody's Warns of Potential LTCM-Scale Fund Collapse (Update5)

``I'm certain there is at least one major hedge fund out there at least as
rightly concerned about a collapse in Moody's as the other way around,' said
Colin Negrych, a principal at Barclay Investments Inc., a broker-dealer in New
York. ``To see Moody's make forward-looking negative statements about hedge
funds, who may well be suffering in large part as a result of their reliance on
Moody's now evidently worthless ratings, is to witness the height of chutzpah.'

Moody's, Fitch and S&P worked with the sellers or packagers of those mortgage
bundles to determine the ratings. they obviously got paid for their efforts by
the sellers.

Also, it was S&P who decided that a 2nd lien (piggyback) on a house would not
impact the creditworthiness of the 1st lien in Y2000 and changed they obviously
false and nonsensical stance in 2006.

All three credit rating agencies are deep into this and i think it is quite
likely that lawsuits will follow. this could become really expensive
considering how many mortgage buyers were hurt and the astronomical damage that
has caused.

That sounds like what occurred with the "independent" auditors that signed off
of Enron's books and the like. A lot of those corporate auditors had a conflict
of interest and were quick to over look troubled accounting entries like
"special entity" assets.

I wonder how much liability these rating agencies have and if any 3rd party
insurance firms backed their ratings. I guess it is for all the lawyers to
figure out.

I believe one of Warren Buffets firms provides high risk insurance (it
generates high fees) and had to pay off on several asbestos liability policies.

It's going to be interesting to see who is at fault and the amount of the
damages. None of the money will ever see the original mortgage borrower.

You will find that they have several years of minimum locked in rates for their
hydro and geo-thermal generating units which can be escalated higher in the
forward years. I believe their current rates are based on a 5.8% annual growth
which is excellent for a utility company.

The hidden value for the company appears on page 15 which breaks out their
"special entity" partnerships. Many of these companies generate positive new
growing income streams. The range of these business cover gas distribution,
Sanitation, Telecommunications and even coal mining.

On page 12 they show their fiber optic cable network which now serves over 170
cities. Presently they have lots of capacity which should become a valuable
asset when new customer and services are added to the system. This assets alone
will generate a lot of free flow cash when they lock in long term customer
contracts for their excess capacity.

They pay an annual dividend every April which is currently around 2.5%.
