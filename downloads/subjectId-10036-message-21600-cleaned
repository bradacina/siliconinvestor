Bruwin,

Several OTC stocks qualify as value stocks. Paul has recommended MHCO.PK, and
it has done quite well (more than doubled for me).

In the case of VELTEX (VLXC.PK), I think the stock is a scam. However, there
are occasional opportunities in these type of stocks, and Paul is not pumping
and dumping the stock, so I think it is ok to mention here. I just wouldn't
recommend anyone buy this particular one.

Second, book value is book value --- value of assets/liabilities at historical
cost with trading assets at current market value (inventories lower of cost or
value). Study some basic accounting for a definition. The only real twist is
that some people use tangible book value, which subtracts things like goodwill.

Read classic value books by Benjamin Graham, David Dreman, etc for the
relevance of Price/Book, but the bottom line is that Price/Book is one of the
best-performing value attributes to use for screening stocks.

VLXC.pk. Given apparent lack of audited statements and that I'm not able now to
visit the company (a reasonable suggestion by LauA though), it boils down to
whether I believe management about their good upcoming earnings projections, or
else whether the concerns/negative opinions expressed here are likely to be
correct.

Some of the guys posting here about VLXC have been around quite a while, so
I've had a chance to see how they operate and how some of their picks and
suggestions have worked out. Consequently, I have more faith in each and all of
the several people responding about VLXC than I do with a corporate officer's
opinion issued in a press release by Veltex, a company I've only recently
become aware of.

I guess I just have too much respect for the consensus here: I've closed my
VLXC position today at a small loss.

Appreciate all the assistance and opinions expressed.

Thanks.

P/book:

I use price to book value or p/bk or p/b.v. because it has been proven to work,
and value investor professionals who seem successful to me use it.

Dreman, Frank, Dorfman, and an army of other value investors and researchers
have done study after study on this subject.

Here are two internet related sites:

http://www.tweedybrowne.com/content.asp?pageref=investment

http://books.global-investor.com/pages/book.htm?BookCode=9641&ginPtrCode=00000&
dentifier=

I use stated book value/sh. It is generally the stockholder equity part in the
eqation divided by outstanding shares. I generally do not use tangible book
value. Tangible book value is often (depending on one's definitions of
tangible) a more conservative number because it does not include goodwill. Many
people believe tangible book value is a better number and a more realistic or
solid number to use when looking at what should comprise book value.

I use stated book value/sh. because it's an easy number to screen for. Also,
I'm interested in comparatives, for example, year over year changes. So as long
as book value definition is consistent, I find for my purposes, stated book
value is okay. I don't ignore tangible book value if I come across it - it can
provide additional information about margin of safety. Similarly, if I become
aware of off-sheet liabilities (some types of leases, special purpose entities,
etc.), I'll qualitatively consider such in my overal evaluation of the company.
I usually don't search through 10K's though for such items.

And as you imply, bruwin, we'd be talking industrial companies and the like.
For service companies, tech companies, etc., book values and p/bk numbers may
not be significant as value determinants.

MKC: I looked at it recently, and it seemed too expensive for me. For a buy,
I'd like the current price/sales figure (1.7)to be a bit lower and more in line
with most previous years (under 1.5). OTOH, I see that profit margins have been
improving year-over-year. New products - sauces, etc. are helping, I assume.

Also, the stock's already come down in price to near lows for the last 18
months. (That's a positive for me, given McCormick's steady and good business
performance.)

I'll put MKC on my watch list for now.

Hi MCsweet, It wasn’t the fact that VLXC was an OTC stock that prompted my
comments, but rather the fact that a stock had been considered without the
means of sensibly analysing it through its financial statements. In my opinion,
the "cornerstone" of Value Analysis or Fundamental Analysis is the adequate
study of a company’s Financial Statements. It often happens, though, that one
cannot find financial statement info for OTC stocks, compared to those on the
NYSE and AMEX.
Good to see you doubled your investment with MHCO.
However, why investors should currently want to buy this stock escapes me.
Apart from modest percentage T/O increases of 4.1% between 2002 & 2003, and
4.3% between 2003 & 2004, this company has, in my opinion, below standard
fundamentals. It’s Operating Margin is a very low 1.6%, it has a massive long
term debt to S.H.I. ratio of 1.57, which is eating away at it’s Bottom Line
such that its Net Finance Cost to EBIDTA is a huge 38.5%. And it’s only earning
a poor 4.8% on its Capital Employed with its Pretax profit. It doesn't surprise
me to see it's down from a 3 year high of $4.75 to its current price of $3.60.
Anyway, maybe things will improve.
Thanx for the reading tips. Actually I own Security Analysis, The Intelligent
Investor and The Interpretation of Financial Statements by Ben Graham and
others. Other works which I own and prize are Philip A. Fisher’s ‘Common Stocks
and Uncommon Profits’, and Peter Lynch’s ‘Beating the Street’ and ‘One Up On
Wall Street’. I haven’t read anything by Dreman. I must look him up.
I can’t say I entirely agree with your contention that Price/Book is one of the
best performing value attributes for stocks. However, I’ll be replying to Paul
Senior’s message in this regard.

MHCO is cheap by most measures.

Price/book
Price/sales
Price/earnings
Price/Net current assets

Insiders own the vast majority and they continue to buyback shares. (Notice the
sharecount has been declining for years)

I wouldnt be suprised if the company is sold because of the age of the
chairman, the president and board members.

The fact that its down from its 52 week high of $4.75 is simply the liquidity
or lack thereof.

That and the last quarter was a little disapointing.

But MHCO runs the business for the long term, not for quarter to quarter
expectations.

I first bought the stock at $1.03 and have averaged up over the years as all
the evidence suggests they continue to build shareholder value.

I expect at some point in the future, MHCO will trade at or very near its book
value.

And that book value increases every year.

$8.724 book value at 3/31

Diluted book value was $8.316

From shareholders letter 4/18:

*Entered into a new 4 year contract with warehouse & delivery associates -will
provide them with substaintial wage and benefit increases.
Substatial contining investment in equipment,along with intensive job training
and clear incentives, have enabled us to control our unit logistics costs while
making MHCO a better place to work thereby reducing turnover.

*Strengthened our "hardware house" brands by adding seasoned import exectutive
who is responsible for global sourcing. Brought with him an experienced team on
the ground in the far east.

*Hired a seasoned sales executive to establish rep organizations nationwide for
Hardware House products, to accelerate national penetration with these brands.
Expect 2005 to show first results from this effort.

--

Sounds like they are investing for the longer term. Which I guess is why first
quarter EPS were below last years.

How many $3.50 stocks earned 11 cents last quarter while investing for the
longer term ?

Finally, although I never buy a stock soley for a pump & dump, the fact that
its a "low float" stock that COULD get it pumped & dumped. Even pinksheeters
are getting pumped & dumped it seems.

Look at CDEN.PK today. From $3.55 yesterday to $9 today.

Bruwin,

Thanks for looking at MHCO. I was not touting MHCO as a current buy (although I
do still hold a few shares), but as an example of a Paul Senior recommendation
that I made some money on. However, itilis2003 seems to have this stock down
cold --- I have nothing to add to his analysis.

Several academic studies have shown Price/Book does quite well --- it is not
just my opinion. "What Works on Wall Street" found that Price/Sales did best,
but that book overall has not seemed to have stood the test of time. Read
Dreman's "Contrarian Investing" or Haugen's "New Finance" or read CFA study
materials (I just took level 3 in June). I believe all of these resources
demonstrate that Price/Book holds up best or close-to-best among screening
criteria. However, I have seen it so many times I tend to get my sources
confused.

I would think a Graham expert would be already be taking an asset-driven spin
on things --- looking at a owning the company as a real business, you would
want to buy it for its assets in addition to earnings power. Sure, Graham
emphasized current assets, but overall he has an a book-value driven mindset
IMO.

Good to see you made a healthy profit with MHCO. Fortunately you bought it
during, or before, mid 2001. Had you purchased in the 1st. half of 2002, 2nd.
half of 2003 or the 2nd. half of 2004 you could be currently only breaking even
or down on your purchase.
Yes, Common Shares Outstanding are down by 17%. But had they not declined, the
EPS would be lower than the 11c you mentioned for the last Quarter. Glancing at
the volumes traded over the last few years, I don’t see that much change in the
average volumes traded recently.
Anyway, we probably have our own ways of analysing companies and drawing
conclusions.
The critical financial ratios I look at tell me that MHCO would not be top of
my list.
As far as I’m concerned, comments made in Shareholders Letters or by Analysts,
are all very well. But the "proof of the pudding" will be seen in a company’s
future Financial Statements. Comments and/or promises need to be translated
into regular Bottom Line profits. It’s my opinion that those numbers determine
a stock’s price in the medium to longer term.
But, as usual, time will tell.

Hi Paul - It was discussed upthread that small cap stocks generally provide the
best overall return because they are undiscovered and overlooked by a lot of
investors.

Can you define what your definition is for a "value" small cap company?
Specifically, what is the market capitalization threshold and are there any
other "small cap" attributes you look for (like sales, p/s, p/b, pe and
others)?.

Our friend Cramer (although not a value investor) does look at company
fundamentals. I thought his rational for PE was interesting. He will NEVER pay
anymore than twice the expected growth rate. So if a company is growing at 10%
and has a trailing PE of 10, he would pay as high as a forward PE of 20 if he
thought there were other company specific events that would lead to accelerated
growth.

After looking at many of my trades over the years, my multi baggers have been
with emerging small cap companies. However, my most recent multi baggers since
FY 2000 have been with high flyer large caps that flamed out as a result of (1)
caught in the high tech boom or (2) a good company that experienced bad
management decisions (merger, acquisition etc). Specifically GLW (Corning), S
(Sears), JCP (JC Penny) and EP (El Paso Electric) were some of my current large
cap winners.

E_K_S. Nice moves in those stocks. In retrospect, looks like they were good
bets, maybe even reasonable if not obvious. Always in retrospect though -g-.
Sorry I didn't buy and hold even a few shares of any of them. I passed on Sears
many times, GLW when it sold below cash value, and had JCP but lost patience
and sold at a loss.

I've no operating definition of "small cap". I've heard some use under $1B. I'd
be more at under $200M. Seems to me that I just call a large cap a "large cap"
when I feel like it, and anything under maybe 50-75M "dinky". Probably I'm not
consistent.

I'm one who likes to use past history - in many cases more so than future
prospects. I rarely use future estimated earnings growth - it's too judgmental
and iffy imo. That forward estimate (e.g. five-year forward growth rate) in
conjunction with current p/e gives the PEG ratio - the number Cramer, et. al.
like - and I do not. I'd rather use other ratios. I like the standard value
stuff - p/bk, p/e, p/sales. I also like avg. roe, average profit margin. I use
the same measures for all stocks, but vary how I weight them depending on the
business. For stocks with no book value, I might look at p/sales. For stocks
with high p/sales, I might want to emphasize profit margins. (Good stocks here
would be ones that sell at high price to sales, yet the profits from those
sales are terrifically large - e.g. large profit margins.)

I'll often check past revenue growth (average over past few years) - I've found
this number less helpful to me though in picking and holding stocks.

I understand there's academic and practical evidence that relative strength is
a helpful factor in selecting stocks (Cornerstone funds, one of the first to
emphasize this, if I recall). My preference in buying a stock is to lag in
if/as the stock drops. As a result, I'm just not attuned to this factor, which
seems to be buying as the crowd buys. Perhaps I am wrong, and I should be using
relative strength. Anybody here who uses this component, please chime in with
your opinion.

Well ... with regard to the ratio of Price to Book , let me give you my opinion
and assessment, with particular emphasis on "Book Value".
Briefly, we have the Balance Sheet equation which says :-
Share Capital + Reserves + L.T.Debt + Deferred Tax = Fixed Assets + Current
Assets - Current Liabilities, i.e.
Capital Employed = Employment of Capital.
For the purposes of the exercise, let’s consider a company with no L.T.Debt and
nothing set aside for Deferred Tax. Hence we have,
Share Cap. + Reserves = F.A. + C.A. – C.L. ...(A)
Now, even though C.A. and C.L. will change month to month, their amounts as
shown in the Balance Sheet are a Cost as of a particular date. A sort of
"current Book Value". More importantly, in my opinion, is the amount for Fixed
Assets which is the ORIGINAL Purchase Price of the items contained, and which
is, more often than not, the largest number on the right hand side of equation
(A). By their very nature, Fixed Assets are in at Book Value. That original
monetary amount cannot be increased by a possible increase in asset value.
Therefore, as I’m sure you’re aware, the right hand side of (A) indicates the
magnitude of the Book Value of the company’s Net Assets. Therefore, because
things must "balance", we have ...
Share Capital + Reserves = "Book Value of Company’s Net Assets".
So if one divides "Share Capital + Reserves" by the number of ordinary shares
in issue, we get Book Value per share (bearing in mind we’ve ignored L.T.Debt
and Def. Tax).
Sorry if I’ve gone through stuff which you are probably well aware of, but I
wanted to arrive at the denominator of the Price/Book ratio, in order to
discuss my opinion regarding its relevance.
If we now consider a company whose Share Capital remains constant for a long
period of time, the only VARIABLE, apart from "Price" in the P/BK, is
"Reserves". But where do "Reserves" come from ... from the algebraic addition,
OVER TIME, of the Bottom Line of the Income Statement. And the concept, OVER
TIME, means that Profits could have been added, or LOSSES subtracted. Logically
speaking, it infers that the number in "Reserves" was influenced by past events
which may not necessarily reflect the current state and "business plan" of the
company.
In addition, I was considering a company with ‘constant’ Share Capital. But
this may not always be the case. A company may need to increase its Share
Capital for several reasons. One reason could be that, because of ongoing
Losses, it may be heading towards Insolvency because Total Liabilities are
nearly exceeding Total Assets. We come back to equation (A) which can also be
written ...
Share Cap. + Reserves = Total Assets – Total Liabilities.
Therefore, increasing Share Capital will obviously affect the denominator of
P/BK, for the wrong reasons, i.e. the company ain’t doing too well !
However, there is another ratio which contains Price and whose denominator is
much more current and reflects the latest state of affairs with regard to the
Bottom Line. After all, that’s where it comes from ! I, personally, prefer to
use the P/E ratio, and regard it as most relevant when calculated within a
short period AFTER a company presents its latest set of Financial Results.
In your previous reply, you referred me to a link of Tweedy Browne, presumably,
because of the work they had done regarding company performance as related to
P/BK. Well, not knowing the details of their research data etc.., I obviously
can’t comment. However, when visiting their site I had a look at the
performance of one of the two Funds they advertised, viz. American Value Fund.
Here we have a company of supposed "experts" who can only manage to beat the
performance of the S&P 500 Index in 4 out of 13 years ! They are currently
performing nearly twice as badly as the S&P 500. Their 10 year annualized
return, after taxes, was only 9.88%. Hardly anything to write home about !
Needless to say, this is not unusual in the world of Fund Managers. In my part
of the world I could have made over 40% capital gain over the last 12 months by
buying Index shares. I’d have to look long and hard to find local Fund Managers
who would have given one that return AFTER deducting their "Management Fees" !
It wouldn't surprise me if the same holds true in other parts of the world.

Hi Paul - I looked at the history you posted on your PHS investment and it
looked like it was quite a ride. Was there any one indicator over that time
span that convinced you that this stock was going to turn around? Could you see
anything from the insider trades?

I owned one stock that is in a very cyclical business that went from $10 to $70
and back down to $5 over a six year period. My best indicator was that the CEO
always loaded up the truck and bought shares at or near the low. He used real
money not stock obtained from options.

I find it extremely helpful to go back through my trades (both good and bad) to
see what I did right, what went wrong and if I could learn anything for future
investments. A lot of it always seems to come back to management which is very
difficult to quantify. In the case of PHS, that problem was fixed by another
company buying them out and using their very successful management to return
better value to the shareholder.

I have owned a few value propositions where management just ran the company
(and their assets) into the ground. By the time the shareholders revolted and
installed a new management group it was too late or the eventual turnaround
took much longer.

What I have learned is if the "management" problem is not nipped in the bud
quickly and a new team is installed (or the company is broken up and sold),
it's going to be a looser and you must sell and cut your losses.

I commend you with your patience on PHS. If you ever come up with an answer on
how to quantify a successful management team please share. I know that it is
not the amount they get paid. The best I can tell is past history but this test
goes bad too. Remember "Chain Saw Al" at Sunbeam.

My hope is that I'll have some winners, and the winners will outweigh the

Actually this company isn't too bad. At least it's profitable - and for each of
the past eight years. The p/e is high, and I don't see where the high earnings
growth is going to occur next year that somebody suggests who has predicted a
very low forward p/e based on current price. Profit margins seem to be

I first bought MHCO in late Oct of 2000 at $1 1/32, (They traded in fractions
back then). The next day I doubled up at $1.00.

About a year later I added shares at $2.07. (Its rare for me to average up)

In March and June of 2002 I sold some at $3.25 and $4.19.

In Oct 2003 I was buying again around $2.

Added more in late April of 2004 at $1.76

And in Mid July of 2004 I bought more at $1.75. This was just prior to when it
jumped because of good results and the hurricane.

The "proof in the pudding" for me is that MHCO has earned money most years
since I bought it and both its book value and its shareprice have increased
substaintially. And its done that in a period of time where the nasdaq has lost
about half its value. Also, MHCO went from the nasdaq to the pinksheets. And
its STILL significantly undervalued. Certainly at the bid.

Please be sure to alert me when you find stocks with the following
characteristics....

Low price/book
Low price/sales
Low price/net current assets
Ongoing company stock buyback
Low P/E ratio
Long history of increasing book value
Insider buying

These are MY KIND OF STOCKS.

Sadly, I just havent found many of them in recent years.

I was a heavy buyer of PURW in the $1.50-2.00 range in the 6-8 months leading
up to their recent buyout at $4.30. (I was also a buyer years ago in the 41-70
cent range)

I was a buyer of GIII late last year at an average of just over $6. The stocks
$10 now.

I have substantially liquidated positions in
BAMM ($1.56 to over $10)
COHT ($1.01 to over $12, I got out below $10)
BONT (From the $2s to over $20
GIII (Was actually a $2 stock years ago when I first bought)
EZPW (Was as low as $1.56, I sold out at $19.97)
SPAN (Owned it about $3.10 avg. went to nearly $15)

Still own a bunch of TGIS which I was buying in the 25 cent range. Its around
$3 and going higher I believe. Although I have sold a whole bunch as can be
expected.

PLEASE send me a list of stocks with MHCOs characteristics when I was buying.
Since they dont fit your criteria, I can buy them and even send you a bird-dog

I get the impression you havent been investing in stocks very long.

Were you around after the 87 crash when there were bargains all around ? I went

also mean a mediocre management team is running a wonderful franchise.

current buy candidates I offer that maybe Dendy Young's GTSI (which is not
doing well now) and Malone's L and/or LBTYA, and Spekulatius's pick here of VIA
(Redstone)might be worth investigating. (I hold shares in all.). I'm adding to
Mexican-domiciled Cemex, in part because I like what I've read of the
leadership. (Not sure I'd call it a value play though at current high price.)
Some oil and gas exploration companies too, where the head man and maybe his
team have built one company, sold it succesfully, and gone on to start another
company in the same sector. NFX may be an example now. (Can't find my records
on this, so not totally sure.)

Sometimes family control indicates a successful management team. Perhaps they
are collectively not as competent as a hungry entrepreneurial group/leader
might be, but otoh, perhaps their being controlling stockholders sometimes
makes them aligned with small stockholders to see the company succeed. Hard to
make firm conclusions.

Anyone here have any thoughts on coal?

I looked at it about 1 year or so ago. Couldn't find anything that I considered
a value, so I ended up settling for playing it via BNI. I used to live in
Wyoming and saw the mile-long coal trains BNI was running out of there.

I figure (probably as you do) that coal usage will increase as it looks like
high energy prices are here for a while.

Warren Buffet once said something to the effect that he looks for companies

Looking at the quality of management can be tricky. Dennis Koslowski of Tyco or
Al Dunlap both had reputations as being good managers. Also, I have read that
when executives reach a certain degree of fame as managers, the stock usually
underperform. The explanation given was that these guys become too busy with

re Good management - the problem with good management teams is that they are
obvious in the rear view window. As an investor, one would obviously trying to
find good management before others do and the results are obvious in the
valuation.

I do know quite a few examples of good management , internationally Novartis is
very well management by Vasella, BMW turned around and prospert under Dr. von
Kuenheim, Microsoft under Bill Gates etvc.Other well managed companies are
AMAT. MXIM, LLTC in technology, AIG in insurance under Greenberg (despite his
downfall he did build a great company), Nestle under Maucher, Canon under
Mitarai...

It is probably easier to identify bad management. Bad management typically
tries to obscure it's performance by constantly changing objectives,
reorganising business, buying and selling companies. Good management will be
candid with shareholders in good times and bad, show it's performance and will
point out what is due to macroeconomic factors and due to it's own efforts.

A good way to track management is to look at the annual reports from the recent
years and find out if management has send out a consistent message. Did they
accomplish the objectives set in earlier years? Do they present results in a
consistent manner? A good management will always try to make things simple, a
bad one makes the business appear complicated so that nobody but themselves
appear to be able to run it.

You guys bring up good points about management.

OT:

In my long, varied, and generally undistinguished career in business, somewhere
after the first or second decade I found two issues that have interested me for
the remaining decades. They are the questions I ask business people and
consultants whom I see off-line - after work, in bars, on air planes, parties
-- when the time and subject get close enough:

1. Are good salesmen made or born? (Rephrased as, are the better/best salesmen
just naturally that way and/or can salesmanship really be taught?)

2. Do you believe a good manager can manage most any business? That is, is top
management generally transferable?

What success could be expected of of Carly Firoina and her vision coming cold
into the Hewlett Packard culture? Or for example, what is it about GE veterans
moving on to other companies, e.g. Nardelli arriving to run Home Depot? Why is
it that so often that the outsider looks better (to the BOD) than any insider?
In general, is it that it's sufficient that the leader manage managers and
that's enough to run the business because it's these company veterans and
functional managers who are the people who provide the operations oversight and
strategic insights and planning?

I've reached some conclusions, but perhaps a person who is concerned with these
things has to come to his/her own view based on their own perspectives and
experience.

Yes, I’d agree with the sentiments expressed in your last paragraph.
Good managers operating successful companies seem to present their Financial
Results in a clear and concise manner. They have nothing to hide. There’s
generally very little in the way of "smoke and mirrors", which is more often
the case when below par companies present their numbers.
In my opinion, an example of a good manager in recent times was Louis V.
Gerstner who managed to save IBM from impending disaster in 1993. Those that
finally persuaded him to take on the job fortunately realised that what IBM
needed was an effective mangager and not a skilled technician, since Louis was
the first to admit that he lacked the technical background. He was correct when
he stated, early on, that "the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision." The
rise of IBM's stock price from $12.72 to $120 during his tenure, indicates that
he knew what he was talking about.

There are two value companies I have been eyeing for quite sometime Albertsons
(ABS) and Disney (DIS).
(http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=ABS&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=dis,%5EGSPC) Both
companies have underperformed vs. the S&P over the past three years. I have
been accumulating stock in one of them (ABS) and may begin to accumulate in the
other (DIS). Both have excellent assets but have struggled in their industry
recently. The BOD of each company has decided to bring in a new CEO. Will this
help?

Albertsons hired Larry Johnson as their new CEO who came from GE several years
ago. Here the BOD’s strategy was to bring over the “best of breed” managers
(they paid him very well too) to restructure Albertsons. Larry was mentored by
Jack Welch and seems to have the necessary skill set to run an operation like
Albertsons. It’s been more than 36 month’s and I am still waiting for the
company to regain their growth & profitability potential.

Disney on the other hand decided to promote from within and announced Robert
Iger who will officially replace Eisner in 2006.
Disney: What Kind of Boss Will Bob Iger Be?
(http://www.mutualofamerica.com/articles/Fortune/March2005/Fortune.asp)

Each company has their own unique set of problems. The common thread with these
two companies are that (1) they are very large, (2) were top performers in
their industry but now are out of favor, (3) have under utilized or wasted
assets that need to be polished and (4) their BOD’s have hired a new CEO to
build an effective management team for the future.

Execution : The Discipline of Getting Things Done by Larry Bossidy and Ram
Charan with Charles Burc summarizes many of the important skills that today’s
CEOs must have. (Larry Bossidy was also a former GE manager mentored by Jack
Welsh and went on to become CEO of Allied Signal in 1991. He successfully
completed the merger of AlliedSignal and Honywell in June 1999.)

From the book “Execution”: “...The leader’s most important job—selecting and
appraising people—is one that should never be delegated. With the right people
in the right jobs, there’s a leadership gene pool that conceives and selects
strategies that can be executed. People then work together to create a strategy
building block by building block, a strategy in sync with the realities of the
marketplace, the economy, and the competition. Once the right people and
strategy are in place, they are then linked to an operating process that
results in the implementation of specific programs and actions and that assigns
accountability. This kind of effective operating process goes way beyond the
typical budget exercise that looks into a rearview mirror to set its goals. It
puts reality behind the numbers and is where the rubber meets the road....”

Steve Jobs comes to mind as someone who brings passion to his leadership role
and has inspired a "new way" of corporate thinking that achieved excellent
results.

Many of my most profitable investments have been where a new CEO was hired to
“turn around” a beaten down value company. It usually takes 36 months for the
new management to get all the changes made. Eventually if everything works
right, sales growth returns and profit accelerate.

Bruwin noted another excellent long term turnaround with IBM. There are many.
They key is to find the next one, and get lucky that the BOD finds the right
CEO to make the necessary changes happen.

If anybody have some candidates for “value” companies that have recently
brought in new management or need a new CEO to make changes, please share.
Maybe there is a hidden diamond in the rough.

Well itilis, how much you made on MHCO in recent times may make interesting
reading for some. Looking at MHCO’s Financial Statements, especially its Income
Statements, in the period 1995 to 2000, it’s clear why there was some
enthusiasm for its stock. However, in my opinion, these positive aspects have
been falling away. Hence its price fall off from $4.80 to $3.60 recently, and
its general sideways move since 2002. I’m sure you can identify them for
yourself.

I also don’t put much store in what Indexes are doing in relation to what
individual stocks are doing. The Dow is a favourite for many. I could never
understand what the average performance of 30 large cap stocks had to do with
an individual company’s performance. Unless, of course, that company’s business
was very much dependent on one of those 30 Dow stocks.

You give a list of your favourite "stock criteria" by which you evaluate
stocks.
Well, have you ever considered the fact that those criteria may represent the
"effect" and not the "cause" as to why a stock’s price may be attractive ? To
find the "cause", I suggest you look into a company’s Income Statement and
Balance Sheet and study Turnover, EBIDTA, Net Finance Cost, Pretax Profit,
Capital Employed, Long Term Debt, EPS and Dividend. If you studied these items,
the relationship between them, and compared these to target values, you’d soon
determine whether or not you had a QUALITY company. It’s the quality, or lack
of it, of these components which drive a stock’s price in the medium to longer
term. That’s why my stock screens involve these items.
Price to Book, or Price to Sales etc.. etc.., are, in my opinion, the after
effects, not the prime cause.
You also stated, "I get the impression you haven’t been investing in stocks
very long." Can we presume that you have your own "proprietary system" for
judging an investor’s time spent investing on stock markets ? Some may regard
your comment as presumptuous.

I'd agree that ABS has quite a good dividend yield, currently, at about 3.6%.
Better than most US banks !
With a P/E of 15.3 it's also, in my opinion, undervalued. I calculate its fair
value P/E to be in the low 20's.
However, being in the grocery stores/retail business, its Operating Margin is a
fairly low 5.8%. Not much room for manoeuvre should Cost of Sales or Running
Expenses rise dramatically. Also ABS is only currently earning about 6% with
its available Capital. Would be nice if this was three times bigger. I see the
stock's been moving sideways for the last 2 1/2 years.
Personally, the biggest negative is its Long Term debt. This debt is larger
than the company's Total Equity, and is costing ABS the equivalent of over 70%
of it's Bottom Line, after tax !
$320 million would contribute a lot more to shareholder's dividends, instead of
going to the banks.

The grocery business is competitive too. We have an Albertsons, Kash and Karry

Up here Harris Teeter competes well with Lowes...Both are native N.C . stores..
Winn Dixie formerly a front runner in the South is closing all of it's stores
in NC... They are in bankruptcy.

Food Lion is a third to the big two and Harris Teeter does a lot of specialty
items . Then there is Earth Fare, a newcomer that has only organics foods.

It's all real competitive. I know Kroger and some of the other big stores have
not done well and stocks prices are down. Walmart's Super Centers take the
blame but I can say from being an ardent shopper( I love food shopping) that
price wise they beat all the stores hands down. It's just not a great
environment to shop in and selection is modest. However, let's say for a qt. of

Hi Suma - What is interesting about Albertsons is since the new CEO arrived
there were two huge acquisitions; (1) Shaws (April 30, 2004 for $2.5 Billion)
and (2)Bristol Farms (a high end specialty food store). These moves added
almost $1.5 billion in new long term debt that bruwin has noted. However,
almost $650 million of the financing for the Shaws investment was done using a
"Hybrid Bond" which is bond like debt that converts to common stock in May
2007.

I am not sure how all of this is recorded in the balance sheet but in May 2007,
a good chuck of this long term debt turns into common shares. There will be a
dilution in earnings per share due to the new shares issued with an equal
reduction in the long term debt. Therefore, some of the ratios used to measure
value and profitability will be off once this debt is converted into common
shares.

I believe the Bristol Farms purchase (11 stores) will allow ABS to gain
experience operating a high end grocery business (w/ high margins) similar to
the Whole Foods concept. ABS's biggest value is in their real estate holdings
and it is up to management to devise a scheme to maximize their ROI using these
land assets.

The other value component in the ABS vault are their Osco and Save-On drug
stores. It's a huge growth business compared to the grocery business especially
as the baby boomers get older. Again management is the key in how they develop
this business. These drug stores can utilize many of the same land assets now
used for the grocery business (using the store w/i the store concept) but they
must develop the separate "store" identity.

That is why I see this as a value play (huge undervalued real estate holdings)
but the key to success is how well management develops their different lines of
business (pharmacy, high end grocery and main stream grocery/retail). Each
business segment has different margins and growth rates. When evaluated as a
whole, the potential PE should be higher and two of the divisions (Pharmacy and
High-End grocery) should have excellent growth in the future.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Like Spekulatius noted upthread "...find out if management has send out a
consistent message. Did they accomplish the objectives set in earlier
years?...". I would like to add that you need to understand management's theme
for the "turnaround". The investor must make sure as the company achieves new
milestones or acquire other companies) that they fit in with the overall
"turnaround" theme stated by management. I have been blind sided by management
doing something out of left field. This is when I get worried and bail on the
investment.

Finally, these turnarounds take time so the smart investor must have a lot of
patients.

Well ... one of the first things I look at is a company's Bottom Line. In WIN's
case, we have the following "history" ..

QUARTERLIES :-
3/2004 : Bottom Line = $0.6mil.
6/2004 : Bottom Line = -$22.7mil.
9/2004 : Bottom Line = -$153.1mil.
10/2004 : Bottom Line= -$399.7mil.
ANNUALS :-
6/2003 = Bottom Line = $239.2mil.
6/2004 : Bottom Line = -$100.4mil.

I'm sure you'll agree that's not very impressive. And it just seems to get
worse.
Another thing ... they only have $364.8 mil. in Total Equity. If they continue
to make Bottom Line losses equal to the latest LOSS of -$399.7 mil., they'll be
Insolvent in 3 month's time. To avoid that happening they'll need to sell stock
to the public to increase Share Capital. The question is, will folk want to buy
that stock ?
If Win-Dixie is currently trying to improve matters, that's a good thing.
Personally, I'd want to see those improvements start coming through in the
numbers appearing in their future Financial Statements before I'd invest in
their stock.

I remember you mentioned ABS preferred back in March and I put it on my watch
list. It was yielding about 8.25% at the time and sitting around $20.

Unfortunately I just watched...as it now sits at close to 23, based, if I
recall, on good progress during their last quarter. I was talked out of the
purchase because of the concerns mentioned earlier about Walmart killing these
grocery chains with their discount prices and aggressive moves into retail
food.

I live in Chicago and Jewel Foods (Albertsons) has this market sewn up pretty
well, especially with Dominick's (Safeway) continuing to slide in this market.

Anyway, ABS-P still looks like a pretty good pick, especially if they continue
to execute the game plan well. By the way, do you know why finance.yahoo.com no

Hi Paul - Here is the Yahoo link for the ABS preferred hybrid shares. (
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=abs_p ).
You can see that the preferred tracks the common.
The difference in price is due to the larger dividend paid out by the
preferred. By May 2007, the two prices should be equal.
(http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1d&s=ABS-P&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=abs )

The preferred security began trading 4th qtr 2003 and traded as high as $26 and
got as low as $22 in Jan 2005.

Remember this asset has two components (1) a bond type income stream and (2) an
equity conversion component. Each unit can be converted into common shares
(based on the exchange conversion ratio) which is determined by the 20 day MA
price of the common stock.

This investment strategy only works if you think ABS's management can complete
their restructure and both sales and earnings begin to grow. The common stock
price must be greater than $22.50 to break-even. You earn close to an 8%
dividend yield ($0.45/qtr) which is “qualified” (double that of the common)
while you wait. In May 2007 all units convert into common shares at a small
discount to the market price.

There are six quarterly payments left on the hybrid bonds and then the premium
to the common stock approaches zero.
==============================================================

I have been wrong in the past and will be wrong in the future so it is possible
that this strategy may not work as expected. I realized that "IF" a turnaround
works, it would take time (more than 24 months). Here you get a large qualified
dividend while you wait and lock in a common equity conversion option at or
near 10 year lows.

If you want to invest with options - not trade - go far out in time, at least 6
months and up to two years. Choose options that are already "in the money",
i.e. if AIG is at $60 now, buy calls with a strike of 60 or lower. It's a cheap
way to own an expensive stock, and your downside is limited to the amount you
put into the call.

The price you pay is the time premium. But you can never suffer a huge loss if

Highly recommend visiting http://www.cboe.com/ for their educational materials
and tools.

Options posses a property "delta", among other "greeks". It relates to the rate
of change in option price as the underlying security moves towards, to, and
through the strike price. A delta of 1 means the moves will be (theoretically)
100% correlated to movement in the underlying security. This would be seen in
deep in the money options, where the premium is pretty much gone.

I would echo the sentiment that options are speculative in nature by definition
-- but they can be used as part of an investment strategy.

Buys 7 Sells: Sold HUM, bought starter positions in SNP and WSH.

HUM has exceeded all my expectations since I bought last year at around 16$ - I
decided to sell at 42$ after the holder reached LT gains status. i feel the
stock is overvalued right now but with all the merger frenzy it could be taken
out at a premium - who nows?

SNP - cheapest oil stock i could find:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=SNP
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123658/000095017205002037/hkg120768.txt

Cheap based on P/E, P/B,P/S metrics. With good but not great earnings, this
company has lagged behind other chinese oil companies like CEO and PTR. The
reason: SNP is more of staid company and is stronger in the refining and
petrochemical business which has been lagging in margins due to governement
imposed price controls. SNP currently only lifts enough oil to meet 20% of it's
refining capacity and Upstream oil is less tham 50% of earnings. Still with 3.7
Billion BOE and 45B$ market cap a barrel is valued at 12$, which is not unlike
the valuation for US E&P's but those don't have any refining and petrochemical
assets!. I also think that the downstream and chemistry assets will stabilize
earnings in case oil prices will fall. By any metric SNP looks like a good buy
if you don't mind owning stock in a company controlled by a communist
governement (but this applies to CEO and PTR as well),

WHS is an insurance broker - i found it looking though Thornburgs stock
holdings (a good read!) Main investment thesis: WSH has a great opportunity to
gain market share from MMC, which was deeply entangled into the insurance
scandal. Valuation is reasonable with a PE of 12 for a company that may grow
earnings 15% a year (at least that is managements objective) in an attractive
business.

I have tended to dismiss 13D buyers such as this one has unless there is other
insider buying on top of it.

Why ?

Because a beneficial owner isnt really an insider and as such doesnt have any
insider knowledge.

Sure, he is "deemed" one by his large position, but that brings us back to him
and his track record.

Without any reason to believe the guy has a fantastic track record, I dismiss
these kind of filings.

As for SPOR, I hold my position from years ago.

To say I have lost confidence in the board is an understatement.

Watching them spend millions defending the Tomlinsons and then letting the
tomlimnsons parachute out with severences well above even what was stated in
the proxy is hard to fathom.

The fact that they hired a banker many months ago and we havent heard anything
and the stock has gone down suggests to me they are going to try and screw us
since the Tomlinsons showed them how its done.

I fear they will go dark on us and pilfer whats left.

I hope Im wrong, but none of the directors has a significant stake and not one
has a backbone from what I can tell.

Id say our upside might be $4-4.50 in a buyout...if anyone wants it.

Our downside ? $2.00 bid, $2.50 offer on the pinksheets perhaps followed by a
reverse split to force out small holders at unfavorable prices.

As for BAMM, I sold half of my small remaining position at $9.99 the day they
announced the tender.

The fact that insiders werent selling was bullish. The fact that an insider
sold a bunch in the open market a few days later was bearish. So its a split
decision for me.

But with my cost basis so low, I feel like I should hold a small position out
of gratitude.

RE: SPOR

There were some unbelievable buying opportunities recently -- under $3.00 per
share -- and it still appears to be a bargain. A large holder was dumping and I
was able to pick up a sizable position between $2.90 and $3.17 per share. But
the volume dried up for now.

SPOR is a $15 million to $20 million per year business that you can pick up for
around $2.5 million net of cash (that's even before considering inventory and
receivables).

I hope their one-time expenditures i.e. Tomlison pay-offs, inventory write
downs and SEC expenses, have cleared. Ten years ago the company made money on
$15 million sales revenue (I think around $1.5 million. If they can return to
profitability this is quite a bargain priced company.

The current manager graduated from the ranks and may have been a Tomlison pick,
and I have concerns about his abilities in turning the company around.

The company also annouced that the board authorized hiring an investment
banking firm to look into enhancing shareholder value and mentioned a possible
de-listing senario -- which I am not in favor of.

Nevertheless, the company, from a balance sheet perspective,looks like a real
bargain.

SPOR,

I own some SPOR and picked some more up at recent lows. Unfortunately, I own
some from higher prices as well.

Looks like a good value to me. I didn't back up the truck on the dip as I

challenged --- been burned a few times already. Still, good enough value there

re Annual report - shareholders letter -
Speaking of shareholders letters, how d would you rate ABS shareholders letter
for Y2004? I rate it a C. My Reasons:

1) The shareholder letter conveniently overlooks the fact that earnings/share
are down 20.5% Instead it touts revenue and cash flow increases which are due
to acquisitions. No word of the 1B$ increase in debt either

2) Despite the 1B$ in "savings" but SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues
are up.

3) No financial summary of the last 5 years (or similar)

I think this is simply a case where management is presenting the few selected
good numbers and leaving the real important metrics in the 10k. I am not saying
that ABS is a bad investment at this point ( I think E K S play on the
preferred is pretty interesting) but it's not a plain talk that I expect from a
strong management.

Hi Spekulatius - I am not convinced that management at Albertsons is "A1" but I
do believe they are trying to effect a positive turnaround. Management does not
seem to be providing the leadership down to the line worker (yet) like Steve
Jobs at Apple. In fact, today at my local Albertsons, I discussed the recent
acquisition of Bristol Farms with a line worker and that was news to him. What
was interesting is that he was very interested in what management was trying to
do, especially with their purchase of this higher end food store. In fact he
even showed me where they recently included a special isle for "All organic
food" items (as requested by customers). Before the settlement of the union
strike (early this year), ABS line employees did not care what the cutomer
wanted or needed and were worried if they even had a job.

Therefore, it only goes to show that until management get their "line workers"
involved with the "turnaround" plan, it's only a higher up plan.

Can you think of another turnaround situation where the line worker is involved
with the customer? What about Ford or GM?

The best turn around story ends with where the company employee understands the
customer needs and is empowered to help them. I have only seen a few cases
where this has occurred and in each case the company went on to generate higher
sales and profits.

The moral is . . . Does the Company listen to the Customer and can the "line
employee" make it happen?

E K S - re ABS. Interesting information about ABS lineworkers. I don't think
that ABS managements is particulary bad but i don't think that a 6 Sigma in the
annual report and a CEO from GE makes a strong management per se. The Unions
will probably know that the CEO cashed in 50M$ in restricted stock before they
go into labor negotiations. Who can blame them to resist salary cuts when the
CEO and it's board do the merry go round while the company is struggling. Maybe
the management is indeed trying hard but they sure are not leading by example,
or communicating with shareholders (or employees) in a straightforward manner.
This makes me think that ABS has only a so-so chance of succeeding with their
business plan (which is the same plan that every other middle of the road
supermarket chain has anyways).

The US Dollar vs. The Rest ... I thought I'd put the following forward for
those who are interested in the Currency Market and the fortunes of the US
Dollar. This is not "my own work", but comes from an Investment Letter I
receive.
"Three of the major currencies, viz. Euro, UK Pound and Yen, have been losing
strength relative to the Dollar at compound annual rates of 20.8%, 11% and
13.9% respectively.
This is due, to a large extent, because of stagnation in many of the world
economies, with the exception of the USA in recent times. GDP in the USA has
been rising at an annual rate of 3.5% at a time when Europe and Japan are
limping along at about 1%. The US, faced with a deepening recession in 2000,
made worse by 9/11, primed its economic pumps by cutting to the bone, both
Government taxes and its domestic interest rates. The economy responded as
expected.
Having decided that the recovery was entrenched, the Federal Reserve began
raising interest rates again. Across the Atlantic, however, where Britain and
Europe are experiencing a steadily deepening recession, interest rate cuts are
only now coming into play. As a result, European investors, seeking a better
return for their capital, have been attracted by the US yields. That is why
money is flowing out of the UK, Germany, France etc.., and heading for the US.
This is strengthening the Dollar and helping to fund a record US trade deficit.
The question is, "When will those investment flows end ?". The logical answer
seems to be, "When US interest rates are no longer attractive to foreign
investors." And judging by relative strengths between the US Dollar and other
major currencies, it appears that those flows may have begun to dry up as the
graphs are now moving sideways.
There are those who are of the opinion that this will continue for the balance
of 2005, and who even go so far as to speculate that there could be a "reverse
flow" of Dollars to the UK and Japan towards the end of 2005."

Storm Cat according to Brinks...

When Scott Zimmerman joined Storm Cat (SME.V or SMEFF) as President in October
2004 I was one of the investors coming on board because of him.

Here is my proof with this extensive overview:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=20765427&srchtxt=<font%20colo
=

I originally talked to CEO Scott Zimmerman when he first joined the company. I
also talked with newsletter writer Michael Schaefer at the same time. I have
not talked to either one since.

I pretty much nailed Zimmerman perfectly in that early November 2004 summary:

"He has worked in every CBM environment imaginable. I talked with Scott's
references who stated he was the: "Best CBM Operator in Country." This is key!
His references tell me he moves very quickly and has built infrastructure time
and time again. His strategy is to first purchase underutilized producing
properties in the United States and Canada. Zimmerman will use his vast
experience in this first strategy. Thus expect revenues which will enable the
company to list on the Toronto stock exchange. They will also seek a U.S.
listing at some point.

They will also look for JV opportunities to leverage Zimmerman's expertise.
Zimmerman has overseen the drilling of thousands of CBM holes. I asked about
his CBM success rate: 99%." END

I have been told that Zimmerman eats, sleeps and dreams Storm Cat Energy. I had
predicted based upon his age and experience that he had to be pretty hungry to
build his own public company. What I did not know until recently is that his
wife worked 24 years for JM Huber Corporation. Come on this is incredible! She
recently joined Storm Cat. J.M. Huber Corporation is one of the premier private
CBM operators in the country.

When Scott Zimmerman came on board in October, 2004 this company only had
Mongolia to talk about. Scott had yet to put his imprint on the company. I have
been blown away at what Scott Zimmerman has been able to accomplish in but a
few months on board Storm Cat. It is absolutely breathtaking. They are now even
seeking AMEX listing. Mongolia has truly become merely a sideshow. Storm Cat
now has a much bigger fish to fry as described below in the JV with Encana. I
always thought they would JV the Mongolia properties.

Storm Cat recently announced a JV with ENCANA---here is my summary:

FOLKS Canadian ENCANA is a 38 BILLION $ Market Cap Company !!

Look what Encana said in May about finding partners with "ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL
EXPERTISE." They then turned to Storm Cat with a tiny market cap.

WHY???

Storm Cat has assembled one of the very best technical team their is. The team
has "145 years of geo-technical experience exploring and developing large
resource-rich, and unconventional, natural gas projects." ONE HUNDRED and
FOURTY FIVE Years !!!!!

The United States has been pursuing coalbed methane for the last twenty years
while Canada has only been pursuing coalbed methane for about five years.
Americans made a ton of mistakes in the early days of CBM. A TON !!! The
learning curve cost millions and millions of $$$$.

The Canadians are making some of the same mistakes now. The Encana property has
all the infrastructure build in and Encana spent millions and millions and
could not get it right.

Heck the target is 7 TRILLION CUBIC FEET OF natural gas. For each Trillion
cubic feet in reserves means ONE BILLION of market cap !!!!!

FOLKS you can count on your one hand the number of public companies that have a
TRILLION CUBIC FEET of natural gas from COALBED METHANE as their target !!!
Read this last sentence again.

An excerpt from an article titled "Harnessing the Natural gas" May 2005 by
Geodrilling international. www.galaxyenergy.com/Media_Coverage/GeoDrilling.htm

Quote: "However, the British Columbia government’s scheme for massive CBM
extraction in the Rocky Mountains suffered a minor setback late last year with
the announcement that Encana is backing away from its exploratory five-year
pilot project north of Elkford, pending recruitment of a financial and
technology partner.

Only one of its 17 wells produced commercial flows of methane and the company
considers horizontal drilling may be the answer to extracting commercial
quantities of gas. One diagonal hole would send spurs horizontally into the
layered coalbeds.

At press time, Encana told GDI that the pilot is still ‘shut-In; adding:
“Evaluation is ongoing and we continue to look for partners who can bring
additional technical expertise.”

Press Release:

Storm Cat Energy Signs Farm-in and Joint Venture Agreement on a 77,775 Acre
Coal Bed Methane Deal in Southeast British Columbia, Canada

Thursday June 9, 3:01 am ET

Company Files for Listing on American Stock Exchange

Scott Zimmerman, Storm Cat President and Chief Executive Officer said: "This
transaction provides Storm Cat with another high quality natural gas resource
opportunity and is consistent with our focused business plan of expanding our
operations in Canada utilizing Storm Cat's proven drilling and completions
expertise in the development and extraction of natural gas from coals.

This transaction brings our total Canadian company acreage exposure to
approximately 300 thousand gross acres with an estimated gross unrisked
resource potential of more than 7 TCF.

This resource estimate reflects our best approximation of Storm Cat's upside
and is based on our more than 145 years of geo-technical experience exploring
and developing large resource-rich, and unconventional, natural gas projects."

Ask yourself: Where can one find a company with such potential and expertise as
with Storm Cat. You can't !!! 145 years of geo-technical
expertise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Storm Cat is leveraging this expertise.

Our 401(k) right now has Vanguard Windsor II in its offerings. I got their

great recent results. The negative is its size (I guess a lot of 401(k)s and
similar are invested there), complex investment structure - they have 5!!!!
teams who invest funds money with 58% going to one of them (James Barrow) and
the rest to others. Also I am not sure I like what Barrow reports in their

re CBH - earnings look good after the first glance. Deposits are up nicely but
earnings growth lags asset growth, because interest cost rise much faster than
interest income. on the negative side, we have CBH's high leverage (equity is
only 6.2% of total assets and 5% are needed for well capitalized status) and
the fact that CBH has moved about 8B$ from "securities available for sale" to
"securities held to maturity" status. I believe the reason for that is that
future LT interest rate would lead to losses for "securities held for sale"
which are valued market to market, while "securities held to maturity" are
simply valued at cost. This could become a big deal withy CBH's high leverage.

UCBH and "pricey"

Analyst evaluation metrics for banks do not focus on p/e or p/s. On the metrics
analysts generally use, I suspect UCBH is pricey.

OTOH, if one looks at UCBH as a being in a consolidating subsector (which it
is) - Chinese-immigrant-American or even Asian-immigrant-American (here I'd
include the several Korean-American banks and any Vietnamese-American banks
(I'm on the lookout for any)- then the the stock of UCBH would be less pricey
because UCBH, as a sector member, has strategic value to an acquirer. Here the
metric is based on past acquisitions, and I believe (I can't find my notes)
that the metric guideline is dollars paid for the bank divided by the bank's
total assets.

Sorry I missed the excellent run up in the these (Chinese-Am.) banks when they
were first discussed here. East West Bancorp comes to mind.

Regarding: FMD

Wow, Mr. Daniel Maxwell Meyers , 42 Chairman, Chief Exec. Officer and Pres $
3.15M compensation! Maxwell must be a genius. Unadulterated sticker shock after
reading about Costco's CEO in NYT this past weekend. Wow. (of course, I own ANF
and the CEO just cashed in $100 million worth of stock options).

Short public operating history. I will have to dig into this one when I have
more time.

Yahooo figures: Forward P/E not too high; P/B = 5.45 that seems a bit rich and
leaves little margin for safety.

What is the value behind this value stock?

FMD. Value is iffy, imo, because of lack of operating history (public history).

I'm usually against buying companies with high p/sales, p/bk. And this stock is
VERY high on both.

These metrics have to be put in some perspective. There are always exceptions.
For one, p/bk might not be such a good measure for financial companies like
FMD. Secondly, it's not so much about p/bk, but what can the company earn on
that book value? Here we have very high ROE (51%) per Yahoo. Perhaps too high
to be sustainable.

Given a very high ROE, the next issue is, what would I be willing to pay for
it? Based on the metrics I use, I'm willing to buy at current price.

I'm one who will also use profit margins as an indicator too. And here we have
very high profit margins, so to some extent a high p/sales number is justified.
(The 41% profit margins reported by Yahoo are likely not sustainable at such a
high level though, I would guess.)

re Citicorp - new chance to add under 45$ soon. Earnings have been sucking wind
this quarter but the global franchise in retail banking and credit cards is
still intact. I like Prince efforts to simplify C's business (he sold Life
insurance, transport finance and fund management for about 18B$). C can use the
proceeds to add to it's stronger business, buy back stock and improve it's
capital ratio (which has increased slowly over the years anyways). I like the
high ROA and think C will overcome the current difficulties, which are at least
partly caused by the stronger US$. I consider buying more below 44$.

Despite BAC stronger looking earnings, I favor C over BAC as I think that the
dilutive purchases (Fleet, MBNA) are destroying shareholder value.

I still suspect both BAC and C are buys.

At this point, I'm probably going to add to my smaller position in BAC.
Certainly lots of media concern about BAC's acquisitions and complaints by
retail bank customers about BAC's service (after acquiring Fleet, for example).

C might be the better value here, maybe the better performer going forward. But
in past, BAC's been the better one:

I believe I like BAC better for one of my conservative portfolios because I'm
looking at BAC's pretty good dividend yield and the yearly div. increases. (In
a prior post, I said they increased div. every year for past 12. That's so, but
the better factoid is that they've increased the dividend every year for at
least the past 25 years (according to S&P).

(Fleet, MBNA) are destroying shareholder value. What happens after they cut out
all the overhead of fleet and mbna. after all they have to have duplicate
overhead.

I own both and will continue to add. Dividend is good and both banks are
growing substantially by acquiring. No brainer here I hope..

On my last purchase of C, I hedged the purchase by writing a straddle selling
in the money covered calls (December $47.5) and out of the money naked Puts
(Jan $42.5). My plan is to buy back the covered calls and then rewrite them
once the stock rebounds.

It's a bit unfortunate that my last purchase was closer to the recent highs
rather than near the annual lows. Hopefully, everybody who wants out of the
stock will finish their selling soon and the value buyers will step up.
