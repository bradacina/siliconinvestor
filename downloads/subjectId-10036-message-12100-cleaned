re CCRT

analytical techniques, including sophisticated computer models, to target a
consumer credit market that the Company believes has been underserved by
traditional grantors of credit. 

Is this a nice way to say 'percieved high risk' card holders?

The Company markets unsecured Aspire Visa credit cards through direct mail,
telemarketing and the Internet. The Company also markets to Aspire Visa
cardholders other fee-based products including card registration, memberships
in preferred buying clubs, travel services and credit life, disability and
unemployment insurance.

This is an area I avoid, especially during a suspected economic downturn.

I need a short to show me what I'm overlooking

I'm not a short, but I agonized over IDTC before passing; instead, I took an
entry position in LMG.A (AT&T Liberty Media Group) for my wife's IRA. Some say
John Malone has lost his touch. I'm happy to invest alongside him. I got
interested in LMG.A because Wally Weitz believed the LMG baby undeservedly got
thrown out with the telecom bath water. FWIW, Malone owns 10% of IDTC. Of
course, he also bought a big stake (although on the cheap) in Priceline.com.

Good luck.

Took a look at Boulder. Two things popped up- they employ leverage, and they
have near 10% of assets invested in something I'm trying to nail down.

"INVESTMENT COMPANIES - 9.5%"

ACM Government Securities Fund
Kemper Multi-Market Income Trust
MFS Charter Income Trust
MFS Multimarket Income Trust
MSDW Emerging Market Debt Fund
Oppenheimer Multi-Sector Income Trust
Putnam Master Income Trust
Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust
Putnam Premier Income Trust
RCM Stategic Global Government Fund

These are fairly obscure and thus far I've not found too much out about their
holdings. The first is ACG, a bond fund.

I like to understand Boulders philosphy, and think understanding what they pick
and why helps. Perhaps because these investments are obscure they represent

I'll wait and do an updated analysis on CEGE when the new 10Q is filed. Like I
said in my previous post on this issue, there will be tax benefits from writing
down the value of marketable securities and I want to see the net impact before
changing anything. Remember that this is a research company and will often have
losses because of that. As of the last 10Q CEGE was FCF positive. I think there
is huge value in their cancer vaccines that are in various stages of clinical
trials.

I'll play the short advocate on IDTC. To me, they have a negative NetNet value
of -$3.04/share. I don't buy companies with negative NetNet value, especially
in a hostile market. Although they show a positive net income on the income
statement, when non-cash and non-operational revenues and costs are adjusted
for, they are FCF negative. So they are losing money at what they do, and have
a negative NetNet worth. In this time of so many stocks getting hammered, I
think there are better, safer, employments of investment capital for my dollar.

All of this is one person's opinion and no investment decisions should be based
on that opinion because it could be totally incorrect as it is not prepared by
a professionally trained investment analyst.

I, too, am always suspicious of how a company might be expanding business. They
might be moving into riskier client base. That isn't, of itself, a
disqualification. It depends on whether the interest charges compensate them
adequately for the assumed risks(and increased subsequent losses), they have
the appropriate policies and experienced personnel in the collections
department, and whether they have adequate loss provisions listed in their
financials.

One of the reasons I stay away from banks and finance companies is because it
is almost impossible for the average investor to discover underwriting quality
and collection efficiency until it is too late.

Malone just did a deal with Murdoch: he swapped his holding in, I think, a dish
TV outfit in exchange for another chunk of Newscorp (giving Malone 18%, I
believe). Also holds 9% of AOL Time Warner.

As for T, I still don't know why the board hasn't taken Armstrong out and shot

To the thread. What is value? In my mind it is when potential return
significantly exceeds risk. Repeat the situation many times and you have value
even though the situations may focus on stocks which on their own merits are
not worthy of a value rating.
Two examples. High probability of success but moderate overall returns, Example
arbitrage. Usually works out but kicks you hard when there is a failure. Second
example, leveraged ratio writes of options against stock. This week I bought
3000 shares of waxs and sold 60 Jan 2003 5 calls. Net cost $75 cash and margin
set aside of $300. No downside risk and very small upside risk since this
company is so highly leveraged that it has almost zero chance of being bought
out. If stock stands still for 2 years this is a 30 bagger.

60 calls suggest you sold 1/2 naked. That's risk that must be considered and
watched closely. Margin requirements would increase as the stock price rose, so
you almost have to keep cash to meet potential calls available to keep from
being forced out of the position. If the stock goes to zero, you imply you'll
be out $75- yet that barely would cover commission. The guys buying your calls-
what is their view of the world? Speculate, if you will..

In my mind, this thread isn't so much interested in all value plays, but value
plays defined as real assets underpriced by the market. Such things happen
despite the efficient market hypothesis, especially so during sell offs. The
trick is to find things the market overlooks, like depreciated assets that are
worth far more than book.

Of course, a catalyst always helps, like business rationalization that causes
such assets to be revalued closer to market.

While I'm not an expert at this, writing calls is starting to play more in my
thinking. That seems to be a viable strategy in a range bound market,
especially if it becomes moribound in despair.

Writing uncovered calls is an easy way to earn a good income stream on a fairly
consistent basis and then get hit one time with a huge price spike and lose
your entire net worth.

In addition bid-asks spreads on options are pretty wide.

I wouldn't recommend this strategy unless you are an expert in options, such as
a market-maker who knows how to maintain a delta-hedged position and has an
idea what kind of implied volatilities present a good buying or selling
opportunity.

If you don't know what the above gobbledly-gook means, you should probably

"...To the thread. What is value? In my mind it is when potential return
significantly exceeds risk...."

Interesting question! I went to the investing books and looked for a clear
definition to give you. And didn't find just one. Under "Value" in the index of
Security Analysis I found: appraised, book, current-asset, going-concern,
intangible factors of, liquidating, market; Value vs. price, relation to market
price, standards of, stated.

On p.123 of the same book, it says: "The value of a business as an entity is
most often entirely determined by its earning power."

So, I guess the definition of value changes depending on the context.

I used to be in the mortgage business and the "value" of a home was different
for each of following entities: the real estate agents, the seller, the buyer,
the appraiser, and the lender. For they were each approaching the issue from
different perspectives.

In a hostile market(which is what I consider the current one to be), the
definition of value, (as it applies to my investments) must include the element
"margin of safety".

I don't know the merits or problems of the strategy you outline with WAXS. I
did a NetNet analysis on it and arrived at a NetNet valuation of $6.06/share,
with a negative FCF of -$1.53/share for a 9 month period. So, lets say WAXS
went to $6.00 within your option time frame. You would deliver the 3000 shares
at $5.00(strike price) making(lets use round numbers and say you bought the
shares for $1.00) $4/share X 3000 = $12,000. You would have to buy 3000 shares
at $6.00/share to deliver them on the naked calls, so that would cost $18,000.
Therefore, on that transaction you would net lose $6,000. Assuming( for
simplicity sake) that all other costs are a wash, then if I did this, the
question I would want to know the answer to would be: " OK, that's the risk,
what's the reward?" You say: "...Net cost $75 cash and margin set aside of
$300.....".... If stock stands still for 2 years this is a 30 bagger...." 30
bagger of what money? If the stock stands still, you sell the stock for what
you bought it for, less commissions, and you get to keep the options premiums,
so were the options premiums 30 X 75 = $2,250? if so, is risking $6,000 to gain
$2,250 a good risk? It wouldn't be for me. I would invest $6,000 to gain $2,250
on that investment, but I would insist on firmer fundamentals.

It's an interesting play, but not for me.

I have 100 shares of T, at $24. This is down from 300 at year end, sold during
the Jan bounce. I bought for the splitup- but from what I read it may not go
the way I would prefer. For example, I think it was Barrons that reported the
AWE spinoff would likely be structured in a swap similar to what was done with
Hughes and GM- ie you can swap your T for AWE, maybe with a small premium.

For small shareholders, keeping track of the tax basis may be a challenge- so
I've got this in an IRA were everything is taxed at the highest possible rate,
but minimal record keeping requirements. <g>

LMGa in the news re 2Billion purchase in europe. I don't like the single digit
ROA/ROE, but Merrill has it Buy/Buy and figures its 20%+ below net asset value.
Since it's a big concern, it takes more effort to understand, at least for me.
Media and Entertainment should do well during a slowdown I'd think.

One more thing about T- since I got in last fall, I've started noticing more
how they give money away by the billions. If that doesn't stop- they will

Hi Mark,

Holding T in your IRA is probably a good idea if you plan to hold your 100
shares through the break-up. Assuming that you will make a few trades to drop
what you dislike and maybe add to what you do like the combination of taxes and
commissions will eat into your position.

You are braver than I if you calculate ROA/ROE for LMGa! The balance sheet for
that one is beyond my abilities so I simply read through the list of holdings
and think of it as a mutual fund.

Here's a general question for the thread: As people take most of their money
out of the stock market and feel no urge to put it back anytime soon what will
they do with it? Retail and consumer electronics? Can anybody that worked
through the '73-'74 bear market shed some insight? As I recall we experienced
high energy prices then as well. Sorry if it is OT so if you would rather PM me

Timba,Mark and McSweet.
I brought subject of risk/reward up with objective to get very analytical board
to think out of the box. Selling naked calls is extremely risky, but rewards
can be worth the risk. Personally I do ratio writes which requires a portion of
the transaction to be naked and the risk to be less than a purely naked
strategy.
Timba re waxs. In your example, ie $6 at expiration, My short requires me to
deliver 6000 shares for which I receive $30,000. However I will have to buy in
3000 shares for $18,000. Since original position was virtually zero my profit
would be $12,000. In fact position is breakeven at 10.
When I do these positions I intend to acquire more shares on the way up.
Biggest risk is whipsaw. A spike in price is very large risk, that is why I
would not choose position which has significant probability of buyout. Mark,
idea behind these positions is partially money management, just like at the
track. When you hold marginable stock in your account the buying power of your
account is magnified. For example buy a $6 stock and sell 10 strike leap at 2
and your out of pocket is 4 but your margin buying power is 3. McSweet,as to
implied volatility, the idea implies that option strategies are dependent on
your ability to be smarter than the market maker. I ain't that smart. In my
opinion the strategies have to be more focused on the uniqueness of the
situation, thereby right up the alley for analytical thinkers. For example, I
bought bche April 32 1/2 calls and sold April 37 1/2 calls for out of pocket of
$100 for each 2/1 ratio position. This is merger situation with a collar price
on the acquirer ,shpgy, of $37. In my opinion the upside and downside risks are
small and hopefully I will net out 4.5 back for each position. I hope this post
might induce other "vulture" investors to share their ideas.

Alan, Thank you for correcting my thinking regarding your strategy with WAXS.

I don't usually like options because of the ticking clock. It seems as though
my timing is usually off when it comes to options.

Usually, I don't think of options and the phrase "margin of safety" in the same
thought stream. However, on the surface, your arguments seem to indicate
situations where decent profits might be available with adequate protection of
principal. With options, however, I have learned that what appears to be "easy
money" often has hidden risks that I need to be more aware of(i.e. volatility
and the time limit of the option period). I think I would need to educate (and
re-educate) myself on the option strategy merits before having any confidence
in my awareness of the risk factors.

I know that McMillan's "Options as a Strategic Investment" is a classic in
options education, and I have the book and have read parts of it. Are there any
other books you would recommend on the topic?

Thanks for that post, Grommit.

Grommit, I've started a position in BTH today. This maker of candles and
"potpurri" has a very good history of increasing sales and translating that
into increasing EBIT, earnings, and book value. (LTD which seems manageable,
has also increased over the years.) The stock's at a relatively low price, so
BTH's p/sales and p/book are relatively low now also. At some point, I expect
that revenue growth has to taper off. The key point for me though is that ROE
is consistently very high (usually >20%).

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BTH&d=2y

I'd say that at current price BTH is a decent GARP play.

Also, I've taken just an exploratory position in AVNT. Avant! Corporation is in
the same chip design business as Cadence and Synopsis (imo, although I'm not
industry knowledgeable). These latter two stocks have been profitable
investments for people who bought when they were mentioned on this thread
(aside: thanks for SNPS, 7/'00, cpabobp!). Two aspects of AVNT I don't like
are: a lingering odor (imo) with CDN's lawsuit for software piracy against
AVNT, and secondly that I'm coming a little late into AVNT because it's already
also moved up quite a bit from its lows. Still, compared to CDN and SNPS, AVNT
could be a bargain and GARP cheap at a p/e of 10 with 7 years of increasing
revenues (but lots of stock issued for acquisitions),no LTD, and mostly
increasing earnings.

still owning it or letting it get called. The other is when the issue has had a
big run-up and I write an out-of-the-money call and, if it's exercized, I'm OK
if the stock is called away, because I've made more than I thought I would when
I entered the long position.

I haven't done any options for over a year now. I just don't like that ticking
clock!

CEGE cost basis before the call was about 16 3/4. So the after call basis is
closer to $14 than $13. If called, the return is 21% after commissions,
annualizes to >50%. I added a second 50 shares to bring it to a round lot at 15
5/8 a couple of days ago. The weakness in the shares prompted me to look more
closely at their cash position. That brought the cost basis down on the first
50 shares.

I'd like to see rich premiums and high volatilities before writing calls. I'm
finding that on many issues, the downtrend has minimized vols on stable mature
stocks that I prefer to hold. Something like CEGE is awarded an Implied V of
>90%, but even that is down from 180% last year.

I saw the move in ABGX, quite impressive. Shame CEGE not moving on it's own
merit. I was about to dump CEGE due to the revelation of the real net cash
numbers at breakeven, but decided to write the call instead. It's not the only
companey working the anti-cancer angle (GERN, AVII and probably others) and I
believe I'm exposed to it through the HQH closed end biotech fund.

I'm not qualified to evaluate biotech efforts, so it makes sense to let a fund
manger (HQH) help out. Plus, they are exposed to private placements in
companies not public yet, which I couldn't play if I wanted to. Being not
qualified doesn't prevent me from playing favorites in the sector anyway, but I
try to limit my exposure.

fwiw, I've started a position in DVI Inc (DVI).

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=dvi&B1=Enter

Revenues have been up every year (I have only a six year history to review),
and earnings have climbed higher most years. Since this is a medical equipment
and medical receivables financing company, the debt/eq ratio is high. And that
debt has marched higher every year. Shares outstanding have increased too.
Furthermore, with an ROE roughly between 9-11, DVI is not, imo, a very
profitable-wonderful business. P/sales and p/e are relatively low compared to
past years. The stock is about midway in its 12 month trading range: I'm not
compelled to call today's stock price a great buying opportunity.

Still, given the company's past performance, and President Bush's desire to
increase spending "for priorities like education, scientific research and
Medicare", DVI might possibly (I am betting) extend its trend of increasing
earnings. The fed's lowering of interest rates (affecting cost of money to DVI)
might also help DVI's profits.

Of significance to me, I notice that Baron Asset Fund and Liberty Acorn Fund
are the two largest mutual fund shareholders in DVI.

Timba, shame on me, I have never read McMillan. There is a wealth of
educational material on the cboe web site(all free). Also they conduct seminars
throughout the year and throughout the country. I really don't subscribe to the
notion that a trader can beat the system. You will notice that almost all of
the literature is focused on technical trading techniques. Rather I use options
for risk diminishment. I think that ratio writes make sense when the out of the
money options seem mis-priced relative to the outcome if the stock rises to the
strike price(waxs position). Also ratio of option to option sometimes makes
sense. For example I did a 20/10 on cmgi, selling 35 stike leaps and buying 10
strike at zero cost. I wouldn't normally touch cmgi with a ten foot pole. Also
selling in the money puts is an economical way to make a bet on a stock rising
in price. I sold 30 wacra(May 5) at average of 1.6 because I would consider
warnaco at 3.4 to be a good investment. As Paul Senior can tell you there are
many good opportunities in arbitrage and quite often the most economical way to
invest in these is by doing call spreads or put sales. Bottom line is that I
believe options are a tool to take advantage of unique situations which arise
from time to time and do NOT subscribe to use of beta and volatility
gobbleydook.

I'll pass. I get nervous over companies that I do not fully understand. And I
get real nervous with companies that finance receivables because, well, they
have huge receivables on the books. We can never be too sure of the quality and
therefore the likelihood of future write downs. (I have been burned in the past
with companies financing their own sales, let alone financing others' sales.)

Also, insiders are selling, and there's not a large analyst following. Paul, I
do not see a compelling reason to buy this one. You are right in that their

they do not have a very large range of historical prices. Of course, I am not

Paul, I just noticed this portfolio you have set up. I have a recommendation.
Reconstruct the portfolio to buy $10,000 of each stock rather than 1,000
shares. You want equal dollar amounts not equal shares. Otherwise the highest
priced stock has undue influence on the overall results versus the lowest, as
you can see with the actual portfolio (where KEM has 10 times as much invested
as BAMM). Furthermore, the 3 buyer rule suggests that a stock meeting that
criterion got the same actual cash from a buyer as another one.

Trying it your way,Jeffrey, we get:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/portfolio/detail.gsp?pid=9256347

Equal dollar weighting would have enabled purchase of more shares of "our" big
winner, low price stock GTSI. So the dollar gain is bigger (than with a 1000
sh. purchase); and this dollar gain overcomes less dollar profit on fewer
shares that would've been purchased of ICIX and KEM.

Net result is that the portfolio shows a greater gain on invested capital (5
stocks x 10K/ea = $50k)

Personally, my belief is that we have several types of value picks in that
portfolio, so I would not be using equal dollar weightings here. GTSI and BAMM
were net/nets. I'd want to invest fewer $ in each of these selections than I
would in stocks like KEM or LDP that I believe (rightly or wrongly) that I
understand better. My original purpose in setting up the list was just to keep
track of stocks 3 people here selected and to see if such selections continued
to be winners. And maybe to quantify results by number of issues and percentage
gain or loss. Having a portfolio and tracking its performance is difficult here
because in every case, the 3 people who said they bought, bought at different
prices. There is also more arbitrariness when one of the 3 people says he's
selling. I have no rule to close out the position. I'm not even sure SI
portfolios can show closed out position results.

Jeffrey, with your method of undertaking in-depth research and concentrating

To me, characterizing investment ideas as inferior (or superior) is an ex post
facto exercise. Some of my "best" ides turn out to be terrible losers. Some of
my worst ideas prove to be excellent investments.

I just will try to select stocks if they fit within my purchase criteria. I'll
adjust the amount I buy by my estimate of the risk vs. reward and my estimate
for the timeframe to see profits. Also whether I will expect to lag into the
purchase over time and/or by price; whether I will reinvest any dividends; and
whether the stock is a in an industry in which I already have funds committed.

In short, just as I try to diversify by factors such as industry,
capitalization, growth vs. value, and so on, ... I will diversify with amount
of funds committed to a purchase.

Added today to my small but losing position in Boyd Gaming (BYD). Several
gaming stocks have been issuing warnings, and BYD does have its problems.

I believe the competition in the Las Vegas market (Boyd's major area) will only
increase over time. Still, I see Boyd as an experienced operator. If they can
get their fair share of the business, the stock eventually ought to recover
from lows.

Boyd's joint venture with MGM in a huge casino in Atlantic City is scheduled to
open in 2003. I will bet (-g-, sorry) that the publicity surrounding that could
help propel BYD to at least a 50% gain from current price. ($3.52 to $5.28)
within maybe 18 -24 months. $5.28 is not an unreasonable number: the stock's
sold over $5 at some point every year in its trading history; the stock's
traded above its book value in several years (bv now is $5.37); and at some
point, cash flows (arguably the chief aspect in evaluating gaming stocks) might
be expected to improve as capital drain diminishes.

Saturday ramble: I'm still interested in "entertainment" businesses, but my
results are mixed.

In electronic gaming, I've sold almost all my THQI; I still have most of my
Midway (MWY) which has been a loser for me since last April. (I took some
profits when the stock, now 7+, was in the twenties.) I sold my loser AKLM for
tax losses at the end of 2000. I continue to hold RCOT (gaming accessories
among other businesses), which moved up since it was mentioned it here.

In the movie business, I still have MGM which is up a bit since I posted on it
here in December. Sorry I didn't get MOVI. Nice double, rjm!!

As posted previously, I'm swimming underwater with Boyd (BYD) in the casino
business, but adding to my position.
I was surprised by the nice run up IGT started last April. Sorry I wasn't in
there for it. And I sold profitably, but too soon, my position in SLOT. It was
a stock mentioned here favorably by several people (two anyway) several times.
Very irritating for me to sell out at 40 or so, keep the stock on my watch
list, and see it inexorably march up - without me! - all the way to the $100
range (now $50 post split).

I still have Huffy (HUF). I took some profits when the stock was higher, but
now, at $7, I'm underwater for most of my position. Although the scooter craze
has ceased (imo), HUF's in much better shape financially now also, and it has a
number of new products as well as their bicycle lines that might support the
stock at these levels. I am holding on.

I still have a position in TOY. (I've held various amounts of Toys-R-Us since
'95, and I've posted on it several times.) Right now, the stock's a 'hold' I'd
say -- too expensive to add to positions, but it's also not the time I'd want
to sell.

In auto racing, I still have TRK, which is up from my purchase price. MPH, with
no ltd, selling at $16 with $7+, in cash & marketable securities, is close to a
buy, imo.

I have MAT and HAS on my watch list. I did not at all expect MAT to recover,
certainly not so quickly, so I missed Mattel's very nice rise from September as
the stock has moved to 18 from 10 (roughly). (Likely a nice winner for some
here and on Buffetology thread) Hasbro has had a decent move recently too, imo.
I wouldn't go for it before; I keep reviewing it, and I can't go for it now
either. The stock IS a buy imo, if one believes that it will return to p/e,
p/sales, p/book multiples it's had in the past. I believe the stock's very
expensive though on an absolute basis, plus they've taken on a lot more debt. I
just haven't been able to step up for this one. My error and my problem, I
guess.

I maintain a very small position in Kodak (EK). (Sometimes inherited stock is
very difficult to part with.) I added a smidge when the stock touched new lows.

My congratulations to people here who've held CCL. I sold my position too soon
in the low twenties, after buying it near lows. However, Carnival may be coming
down into the twenties again, and if so, I will begin to lag in at that level.

Other: I still have, and expect to hold on to, newspaper stocks (Are they
entertainment?)and cable content provider Scripp's (SSP). (Thanks, Twister!) My
selection of DISH (Echostar) has been very bad indeed. Not a value stock and
apparently not a growth stock either. It's a goof stock. -g-. I also still have
positions in a couple of stocks of radio stations which I mentioned last year.

Yesterday I started a small position in WWF. Company founders are strange
people (to me) who are adept at capitalizing and exploiting the wrestling
franchise they've established. Stock's at a low, problems with XFL perhaps.
Cash flow from wrestling business with its product licensing opportunities
ought to be good enough to eventually help the stock to recover.

I've been wrong many, many times.

I haven't done much in the last month. Moved some money into money center
financials (AXP, MER, MWD, STT). I keep looking at tech without much luck. The
average forward PE on the names I want is 48! I did buy some KEMET at $17 on a
PE basis.. it's supposed to earn $3.95 in 2001. Also, I bought some ADC Telecom
(ADCT) on a PEG basis at $12. I heard it described as the hardware store for
the telecom industry with an inventory of 30,000 parts. I think historical and
estimated eps growth is > 20 percent.

I bought some United Rentals (URI) at $17 on a free cash flow basis. This is an
equipment rental company with a $1.3 billion market cap. The CEO estimates $390
million in 2001 FCF from operations. The company has a lot of low-grade debt
(Moody's b3). I'm hoping the company benefits from long-term secular trends
towards equipment rentals.

I bought an Austrian ADR, Head N.V. (HED) at $4.71 on a PE basis. The company
has forecasted 2001 eps of 82 cents. Currently, it has $182 market cap, $400
million in trailing sales, $72 million in debt, book value of $230 million. Per
Morgan Stanley research the company has leading market share in ski bindings
(tyrolia), diving equipment (mares), and tennis balls (Penn).

I took a large position in Holderbank. Similar story to Cemex but a much higher

Two ideas you may have looked at already - LPAC in entertainment and ALLY in

my spin in advance.
%EOM----------------------

Date:3/11/2001 3:33:06 PM
From:Paul Senior
My opinions on ALLY and LPAC need a preface and disclaimer.

I've looked at both stocks. Of course value investors differ, and all have
their own methods and will make their own conclusions. For readers here looking
at ALLY and/or LPAC and considering the opinions presented, my suggestion would
be to discount my take on these stocks and weigh much more heavily the opinions
of Dale. (I'd say he likely knows what he is doing, and I often... miss a few
things.)

LPAC:
http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=lpac

From 1994 to present, the revenues for this company have been between
28-32M/yr. It's a profitable little business (good ROE, ROA). It ought to be a
fairly easy mom&pop company to analyze (17M market cap and 225 people). But I
am having my troubles. I know we might do a discounted cash flow, etc., but I'm
going to assume that this company is in a very stable business (consistent
revenues) so that what people have paid for the stock in the past 5-6 years
might be a good indicator of the range of values for the small investor (as
opposed to controlling shareholder(s)). Unless I am missing something here
about the future. For example, any new business opportunities with digital
downloads direct to movie theaters (??) or the potential of their new joint
venture, digital video effects business. So unless informed otherwise, I have
to look backward here and the analysis becomes a pick-your-spot-on-the-graph.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LPAC&d=5y

Imo, the stock seems fairly valued (for a non-controlling shareholder) - no
great bargain - at about 2 1/4. OTOH, the stock has traded higher, and at some
point, a price of 3 1/2 could easily be achieved. (50% gain). This brings up
two further aspects. If one buys now expecting to wait for a 50% gain, how long
would one be willing to be in that stock for that gain? Secondly, regarding
risk/reward, is the glass half full or half empty? Given my proclivities at
this time (the current market and my current holdings), I see the possibility
(which I might very wrongly translate to likelihood) that the stock goes lower
before it trades higher. I will put this stock on my watch list now,betting
that I can enter at a lower price than now and that it will regress higher once
again. More confident investors who are willing to take on a microcap, might
consider a purchase now.

ALLY. Some people have said that the airlines exist for the purpose of enabling
Boeing to make a profit. Perhaps with gambling, the casinos exist primarily to
provide profits for the slot manufacturers. I'd say ALLY's current stock price
already reflects ALLY's strong presence in many aspects of the slot and gaming
business. To me, the way some of these slot manufactures try to design their
games and equipment, it is similar to the electronic games business. Which
means a hit product can catapult the stock. Similarly, although it appears that
ALLY has a very good installed base, it's possible (maybe not likely-- I just
do not know) that their units can become obsolete.
The best investment,imo, has generally been the dominant player (ERTS in games,
IGT in slots). While ALLY might be undervalued relative to IGT or SLOT, I'm
uncomfortable with making an investment here on a "relative undervaluation".
(Relative-to-similar-company buys are always dangerous, imo.) With ALLY, I ask
myself, "How long would I be in for?" I believe here, I'd see a problem I have,
which is that I would fail to sell promptly if/when the stock were to drop.
This stock already has had a terrific run up. It's recently got an analyst's
strong buy recommendation. I notice that you (as opposed to me) are very good
and quick about cutting your losses and moving on. Probably very good about
capturing gains too. I see that Dreihous is in this stock. They are imo,
excellent momentum players, maybe value momentum. And they are VERY quick to
eliminate their positions. For me then, I see it this way: I'm coming late to
the party, and I'm playing somebody else's game. The odds have to be against me
on this one.

If anyone else here can add some insight or information or analysis relating to
these two stocks or my perception thereof, now would be a good time.

KNT Kent Electronics

A close friend of mine recommended this company, and I had to take a look.
Rather than posting a positive message, I'd like to take the opposite angle.

The company has reported positive earnings, sequential growth, and appears on
the surface to be appealing...but.

One of my big sticky points is in the A/R & inventory area. The company, while
being profitable, has not been able to turn positive cash from operations for
at least 5 quarters. As I understand their business, they have no customers
with >5% of their A/R or sales composition...so what's the problem? Why are
they paying A/P down so quickly when A/R is going up?

I have been wrong before, but would warn against purchasing KNT because they
failed the smell test, I just can't accept negative cash flow from operations
on a consistent basis.

I would stay away from KNT for another reason. They have a large cash position
which got much larger from recent sale of their ECM business. I believe that
they have stated they are interested in acquisitions. With so much cash that
adds a lot of risk to the equation - of a bad, large deal. (If you really knew
mgmt was outstanding, the cash would be a plus in this market, as they could
build their business inexpensively.)

Hi Twister. Almost too late to sell some of these stocks. But I say that every
day, and growth and tech go lower and lower. Also high priced stuff: I was
expecting a 500 DJ loss today ala 1987.

Started a position in COMS today. High cash to price.

Gave up on ICOC, a stock I've held for a couple of years and posted on then. I
succumbed to the risk of being in a stock where the controlling shareholder
family runs the business for their gain and to the detriment of other
shareholders (imo).

Paul and thread,

While I read this thread daily, I rarely post.
I do want to voice my support for COMS.
In this market environment, I have been avoiding anything except stocks with
high price
to cash ratios. I feel it gives them a firmer "floor" for the price.
While I follow many stocks that sell for around half of the cash on the balance
sheet,
those companies are in most cases small and have not been profitable. For a
company
the size (and with the history) of COMS to be selling now slightly less than
the cash level
is rare. Some here may recall late 1998 when the semiconductor capital
equipment sector had bookings almost dry up and some of the companies were
selling for
around net cash. That turned out to be a great buying opportunity. The news
couldn't be
much worse for COMS (and its sector) now, and I think that also contributes to
the makings
of a bottom. While I certainly do not claim to know when or at what price the
bottom of
COMS will be, I do think that at the current price, the risk/reward is
favorable for starting a
position.

Count me in, and good luck!

Eric.

Hi Guys,

We have our three but I wanted to say that I still hold 2/3 of the position I
bought the last time it hit these levels. I posted it here at the time.

Although I regret not selling more I can't complain about profits (can I?). I
still see it as a cash play with an outside shot at some very nice growth if
they happen to hit the right button with one of their consumer electronic
devices. In a time when everything tech is going down I see the cash as their
get-out-of-jail-free card.

COMS no longer owns PALM in any substantial amount. Unfortunately, I do.

Another rough day for stockholders. I am surprised that I am not seeing bargain

seeing bargains in the stocks which I already own. Wasn't it Peter Lynch who
said sometimes the best bargains are the stocks you already own? I don't like
seeing so many bargains here though!!

I gave up on my long term holding of Bank One today. I just cannot see the
light at tunnel's end for this one.

I sold half my position in Panamco (PB) which has had a decent move since I
last posted on it. PB is a key KO bottler, and as I have said, imo a surrogate
for a Buffett stock. I've just lost some confidence - it's hard for me to
analyze this one and hold on to it at its relatively high price. PB's a bit
different stock from the ones I buy based on the standard criteria I usually
use, and that's affected my decision as well.

I added to my position in LDP.

I started a position in MPH. Although Championship Auto Racing (MPH) is
embroiled in a dispute with its marketing agent, and MPH might also be limited
by some long term TV contracts (I am guessing- have no facts), CART racing is
an international activity that has very good demographics for advertisers and
for continuing to garner fans to the sport. (all imo) Long term this stock
could/should/might recover. Selling at a price twice cash and with no LTD, the
operation provides some margin of safety. (That's a maybe and only my hope and
guess.)

Thoughts on Spherion. I noticed it has come up on this thread as a possible
value play. My questions:

Did you note in the latest 13g's filed on sfn that ruane (value investor) has
liquidated about 30% of his position in spherion.

Also, what do you make of G. Milner continuing to sell as the stock breaks to
new lows. His latest sell of 1.7mil shares coming at about 8.8/share.

Finally, I made a small purchase at 9 and change based on the spinoff
potential, but it seems clear that something may be leaking on the spinoff
viability. Although you have to wonder how the director could continue to sell
shares (Guy Millner) if that were the case.

Finally, Do you like this stock better now ?

SFN: Thanks, Chris. I hadn't seen the recent 13G. Looks like for the 3/9 filing
Ruane C. dropped their position from 6.2M shares to under 3M. That is not a
good sign at all. Especially selling near lows.

Regarding "Do you like this stock better now", for me, because of the Ruane
sale, I do not. Now I'm very uncomfortable with SFN. I'm going to try to hold
on though not because of the spin off potential, but because the stock is
hitting multiyear lows, the value metrics - p/sales, p/e, etc. look good
relative to past years, and SFN SEEMs to have been able to grow earnings
(through acquisitions). (I say "SEEM" because I wouldn't trust the numbers of
any company that is headquartered in Ft. Lauderdale, FL.)

I defer to others, such as W. Crimi, who likely have done dd on this stock and

SFN

I own a position in SFN, but I am becoming very uneasy about it.

It seems to me that if SFN can get the price for MP that has been talked about,
the company can pay down most/all of its debt and still have some cash left
over.

That would put it in a OK position to weather the economic storm and any
downturn in business.

So it makes no sense to me at all that Millner keeps selling his stake at these
prices when we are less than 2 weeks away from the MP IPO.

I also agree that it was less than comforting to see Bill Ruane unloading his
position too. Ouch!

The whole thing would make more sense if the IPO wasn't so close or wasn't
going to happen and MP's business was also starting to weaken. Then I could at
least understand some investors being spooked by the slowdown, poor 4th
quarter, debt load etc...

I am still searching for answers, but unfortunately I have none. I am unsure
what to do from here.

COMS no longer owns any PALM.

Discontinued Operations

On September 13, 1999, 3Com announced a plan to conduct an initial
public offering ("IPO") of its Palm, Inc. ("Palm") subsidiary. On March
2, 2000, 3Com sold 4.7% of Palm's stock to the public and 1.0% of
Palm's stock in private placements, resulting in net proceeds of $1.2
billion, which were retained by Palm. On May 8, 2000, 3Com's Board of
Directors declared a special dividend of 3Com's remaining interest in
Palm to 3Com's shareholders of record on July 27, 2000. On July 27,
2000, 3Com distributed its Palm common stock to 3Com shareholders. The
distribution ratio was 1.4832 shares of Palm for each outstanding share
of 3Com common stock. 

That's from the latest 10Q.

Chris,

I tend to agree with you about the IPO unless markets really crater in the next
week or two. But that would have little to do with why Millner is selling
etc... It would just be bad luck.

If the IPO is a go in the price range that the company is projecting, then
there are only two ways to account for the selling. (Millner's and Ruane's)

1. The rest of the operations are getting killed in the slowdown as a result of
layoffs etc... (especially tech?)

2. Millner has personal financial problems and is being forced to liquidate.

Nothing else makes sense to me. I am really clueless and uncertain about what
to do at this point. I may punt some but not all. That way I can live with
either outcome - good or bad.

Jurgis....Would you share your thoughts regarding ORCL?

I just did my own analysis on it and have some concerns after reading the 10Q
filing covering the most recent 6 months of operations. First, I get a negative
Free Cash Flow of -.082/share, so they are losing money doing what they do.
Second, they reported negative Cash from Operations of -$265.836M about which,
in their "Management's Discussion" they say:"...The negative cash flows from
operations incurred during the first six months of fiscal 2001 primarily
reflect the payment of taxes related to the gain on sale of Oracle Japan stock
that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, partially offset by
improved profitability and a decrease in trade receivables....." The problem I
have with this statement is that it appears to be intentionally clouding the
issue. After all, their income before adjustments to cash flow wouldn't have
been nearly as high if it weren't for the gain on the sale of assets, therefore
the tax which was deducted from operating results was due to non-operational
activity and therefore rightly deducted and the resultant operating cash flow
loss shown reflects operating performance and still hasn't been addressed. I
don't like it when management blows smoke and this has damaged their
credibility in my eyes.

Third, I get a NetNet valuation of $.61/share.

Now, I do like that their revenues have grown 14% and that they have maintained
their 10% level of R&D spending. But they went from a reserve for doubtful
accounts of $40 million a year ago to $94 million for the period just reported
and that period was over before this latest downturn has happened.

Unless you can give me some insight (and I admire your thinking on
investments), I think ORCL still has a ways to drop.

Hiya AD!

regarding: "Have you used any standard metrics, or online resources, for

No, I have not. These are one of the categories that I would like to get to in

The cruise was delightful! Snorkled off of St. Lucia and Nassau, had wonderful,

Haven't run any new value screens since I'm back. I have a list of software
stocks that I want to finish evaluating, but I'm having a hard time marshalling
the discipline, my mind is still on Holiday!

On the general list of stocks that I've already evaluated, when I plugged in
the current prices, CMGI, CNET, COOL and CEGE have now reached NetNet status.
CMGI is suspect because I think a lot of their former asset holdings value has
declined sharply, so they may not be a NetNet when that is factored in,
additionally, they are cash flow negative, so I won't be looking at them again
while I'm pressed for time. I would think that CEGE and CNET might offer some
promise, but I would have to go back through my notes to verify that, and I
haven't done so yet.

The carnage in the wireless-equipment sector has grabbed the attention of Marty

companies that make cell-phone components, realizing he may have to hold them
three to five years. His favorites: AVX which, at 17.29, is down from a 52-week
high of 50, Kemet, which closed Friday at 17.71, down from a high of 44.23, and
Vishay Intertechnology, which was once at 50 but now stands at 18.01. All three
are flush with cash and have good long-term growth outlooks, Whitman contends.
And they trade at just seven-to-eight times expected 2001 calendar year

Timba,

I did not dig into the financials of ORCL as deep as you did, so I think that
your concerns may be very true.

Why did I buy ORCL? Because I still see it as a leading company in database
field, which has achieved ~30%ROE
in the last ten years. It is also rather attractively priced. In my opinion,
they are well positioned for the future - though nothing is certain. There is a
question whether they will win applications war against SEBL, etc. and whether
they - or MSFT - will be winners with "apps over the net" initiatives. I
partially own ORCL as a hedge for my MSFT position.

Sorry, but it's more "brand-with-moat-highROE-ARP" approach than pure value
investing.

Good luck

Eventually the end users are going to start buying these products again.

The three stocks mentioned in that article (avx kem vsh) are manufacturers of

I had already picked another in the sector, AHAA, which is smaller cap which

others, it has a nice balance sheet with lots of cash.

Of all 4 stocks, AHAA and VSH are the only two where analysts are still

One of my current fav's is AREM Selling at less than 15x '01 expected earnings
[They've recently reassured] They do ERP software to smaller companies globally

that labor is based in India where software engineers work for about 10k/year.
Saw this about AREM on Raging Bull - summarizes the case well:
"SG COWEN REITERATES STRONG BUY, "CONSERVATIVE" $32 TARGET
Key Points:
1) Stock Down 32% over last two trading sessions versus 11% decline for NAZ
2) Strong performer unduly penalized in tech-slide and offers buying
opportunity
3) Positive management comments on Q1 and outlook for '01 strengthn our view of
continued operational strength
4) We exoect another strong quarter and upcoming industry conferences to raise
investor interest.

...stock is trading at PE of 7.4 times 2002 estimates, compared to S&P trading
at 18.4 2002 estimates. PEG for AREM is 0.22 compared with S&P 3.1. We believe
that Aremisoft is significantly undervalued. Using the above, this implies that
the company's shares are trading at more than a 90% discount to the S&P's
out-year PEG estimate. Furthermore, our $32 12-month price target represents a
PEG of only 0.5 times and a PE of 17.5 times, both at a discount to the S&P. In
the current environment, we believe that a PEG of about 1.0 times is fair value
for many software players that we follow, and at a 0.5 time PEG, that our
12-month price target is conservative. We reiterate our 1 (Strong Buy) rating
and 12-month price target of $32."
