Nice going. Points deducted though for not mentioning it here when you first
bought it. Coulda been/woulda been/was a value stock back then had anyone
noticed it. (That was in 2001 when you must have bought. When first discussed
here though (by with-a-K in Jan. '04), to me the stock looked at least
fairly-valued (and not undervalued). Too you too, I'd guess, if you were
selling it then (in '04).

I read your comments about ABY and have begun looking at the stock (as well as

makes sense and raises some interesting possibilities considering the new

POP. I still have shares bought average down from 11/05 (~$7.05) to 4/06

while in past the stock/business has always recovered, POP is just marginal,
and this is the one time it just may not turn itself around. If it doesn't, I
could be averaging down more and just following the thing into its bankruptcy.
... My tendency though is to add...maybe once more anyway. -g-

1) Weak US$

3) Demand from private equity investors etc.

Treasury rates should go up less than corporate bond yields since the premiums

Ah, these stocks that will revolutionize the sector they're in.

Let's see for me, five years ago there was the insulin test device that one

that developed this thingamajig that was to be reasonably priced and that one
only had to buy special coated paper for that the company supplied (money to be
made off the blades-not-the-razor-model.) Failed with customers. Never did find
out why. Company went bankrupt, and I held the stock into it.

Anyone care for high-powered, electronically controlled, rapid-fire machine
guns? I'm still holding a losing position in Metal Storm which supposedly
can/will/might change the way and the scope of how munitions are delivered on
the battlefield. (MTSX)

Monogen? Sure. I'll go for some of this one too. And even add a little more to
my losing position. Just a little until I see more positives ---like the
company actually selling something (intellectual property or actual product)
and maybe being able to make a profit on it.

Tough call, short term is down, long term will be steady to up imo. I expect an

Clearly, medical, food and energy costs are significantly higher year over
year. Now that rents are rising (even though house prices are flat to small
declind), the cpi will show inflation. The FED will be constrained however due
to the weakness in the economy.

I have followed this from when you first mentioned it at <$1 to its rise to

Went and looked at the website. Here are my questions:

Only 8 employees - How are they going to roll out revenues to support a 150
million market cap with only 8 employees ?
180 million shares outstanding - seems like a lot
Yearly revenues decline from 2004 to 2007.
I thought the monoprep had already been released. Is that incorrect ?
They indicate that it is not well accepted in Europe due to cost ?
What is the cost of a Monoprep unit ? They indicate it can run 160000 tests
annually per machine and that there are 120,000,000 test run annually. If they
own the entire market that only seems like 700 machines. So presumably they get
a reoccuring revenue model with this machine somehow. What is it and do they
get a certain $$ per test ?

Re mog those are all very good questions. Off the top of my head I can tell you
that Cardinal Health will be the distibutor and The machines themselves are
contracted out to a manufacturer whose owner is I believe now the second
largest holder of MOG shares.
The owner decided they were better off owning shares and getting a lower share
of the profits from each machine. This is of course highly speculative but the
people backing this venture are not lacking in confidence. BTW I believe that
some of the price weakness was due to to a decision to sell a relatively small
amount of units to institutions at prices far below the prevailing market
prices at the time. I believe these institutions shorted the shares or sold
them and then held on to to the warrants. It was easy money.

machines sell for ? or the competitive machines ?

Without some fundamental answers to the revenue question, it would seem like

The man buys one stock at a time? He has a big problem multi-tasking? -g-
Yeah, if I had only one stock, I guess my life would be much simplified. I'd be
a nervous wreck though. Maybe bored a bit too.

One assumes his dd is very in depth. Please don't tell me this is the only
stock he's bought in the past 10 years though, or that he only bought because
he's the father-in-law of the president or something. And I hope he's not a
medical doctor. (Uh oh. Here's where Mike Burry steps back in to take the
thread away from me.) They are notoriously, uh, not-good investors.

About the one-stock-at-a-time-guy: Assuming with his position size, he wouldn't
just be holding for a few days (although he might be trading around a core
position at any time). What I find interesting is that it seems to be a large
$$ commitment by somebody apparently wealthy, who for somebody age 65, I would
assume doesn't really need the money or lifestyle change. I would expect the
person would be considering retirement and conservatism. That he is making such
a large bet (well $10M is large to most of us, esp. if it becomes a loss of
$10M or more), at that age (having to face
wife/children/grandkids/friends/business partners if it doesn't work out),
well, that kind of dollar commitment is very positive for the
stock/company/concept actually working out.

And of course, if you're in the stock, with your sterling record, Brinks, that
is a positive too. (Well, for me, anyway -gg-).

I'm certainly not an expert, I would just add my two cents. You probably
already know this, but if rates back up (as bond "guru" Bill Gross thinks they
will), that magnifies the chance that the REIT sector will decline IMHO.

Both of your choices are relatively alike; if you paste one over the other on a
five year chart FPO is a better performer, on a two year basis BDN slightly
outperforms. I like BDN's bigger size and price to book better.
BDN is better diversified geographically than FPO, though not by a large
degree. That would help in a geographic specific downturn.

REITs

I agree that MPW is now overpriced, but I still own some. Actually almost all
reits are overpriced right now.

One simple thing to look at is Price/FFO. I used to do a lot of studying of
Yield vs. Payout Ratio -- graphs and mathematical analysis. It has served me
well. But then, silly me, I realized that when you get down to it, Payout Ratio
/ Yield is equal to Price / FFO.

1. Payout Ratio = Dividend / FFO
2. Yield = Dividend / Price
So Payout Ratio / Yield = Price / FFO.

So, among other things, look for a high yield and a nice low Price/FFO. Four
particularly good REITs right now are FR HPT HRP SUI. I check around 80 reits
every few months, looking for deals.

I like FPO because it's in that Washington DC corridor, and with government

Advisers is a holder (according to Yahoo), there are some small recent insider

Time-share Titan Wyndham: Underfollowed and Underappreciated - Barron's
Sunday June 10, 8:11 am ET

Eli Hoffmann submits: Annotated article summary from this weekend's Barron's.
Receive all our Barron's summaries by signing up here:

Hospitality Sweet by Leslie P. Norton

Summary: Wyndham Worldwide Corp. (NYSE: WYN - News) makes the lion's share of
its cash flow (74%) from the time-share industry, in the form of hotel bookings
(41%) and a vacation exchange which facilitates time-share trading for its 3.4M
members. Once considered a shady business, time-share is now used by industry
giants like Marriott International Inc. (NYSE: MAR - News) and Walt Disney
Company (NYSE: DIS - News). The industry has posted double-digit growth for
most of the last twenty years. Since becoming its own entity last August (it
was spun out from Cendant) at $32, share are up only $3, and its
trailing-earnings ratio is just 20x, vs. 24x for Starwood Hotels & Resorts
Worldwide (NYSE: HOT - News) and 28x for Marriott. Possible reasons: an
under-appreciation of the time-share model; its hotel properties are low-priced
and geared towards leisure travellers, while industry strength is perceived in
the luxury and business segments; the average time-share client (income
$85,000, age 58) is seen as 'uncomfortably stretched' in today's economy. CEO
Stephen Holmes counters that defaults on time-share finance payments have
remained stable due to their relatively small size, and says a recent $600M
note offering backed by time-share receivables was "way oversubscribed."
Earnings tripled in Q1 2007 on an increase in room revenue, strong
vacation-ownership demand, and an acquisition. The company upped its 2007
guidance from $1.98 to $2.17 (vs. $1.70 in 2006), announced a $0.04 cash
dividend to begin in Q3, and is repurchasing shares. Gabelli & Co.'s Amit
Kapoor says the overrated concerns make Wyndham an "exceptionally cheap" stock.
Using 12x 2007 cash flow minus net debt, he puts shares at $58, 66% above
current prices.

I hate restaurant stocks in general. "Step up" fast good chains in particular.
COSI saturated NYC a few summers ago and then closed a lot of them. Went to
Panera once- not impressed. Think chains w/o brand = lame - and brand takes a
long time to build and cultivate. For every SBUX a zillion Bos Chix. The real
estate is what would get me excited and most of these jokers lease, over grow,
and lose.

All that said- if you buy that rates are going up and the consumer will have to
cut back it might be worth looking at the cheap/poor person stores that will
maintain or grow revenues in that environment - but study those assets as
chances are many of them wont be able to take advantage of this imminent
downsizing.

My two cents.

Business Strategy(Taken from MonoGen's 2006 Annual Report)

MonoGen’s goal is to become the leading provider of a fully integrated
automated platform for cytology and molecular diagnostics. Key elements in the
Corporation’s strategy to achieve this goal include:

• Establishing the MonoPrep Processor as the leading cytology specimen
processing system, especially in the large established gynecological market for
cervical cancer screening;

• Launching new products to complete the SLS, a fully integrated automated
platform for cytology and molecular diagnostics. Initially, MonoGen will be
launching the MonoPrep Processor for non-gynecological and gynecological
applications. MonoGen intends to introduce additional products to expand the
SLS, including a MonoPrep Imaging System and BioSight Pathology Workstation;
and

• Pursuing discussions with molecular diagnostics companies to allow these
companies’ assays to be used with specimens collected in MonoPrep vials, such
as HPV assays, in addition to potentially licensing the further development of
lung and other cancer panel assays for which the Corporation has developed
intellectual property.

Upping my exposure to bulk shippers today. Possibly very dangerous this point

Going for a few shares of OCNF to add to other sector stocks already held. Very

Hi Paul - Glad to see that you are bullish on the bulk shippers. I have begun
to sell a few of the shares I hold in DRYs and SFL as they are up significantly
from my original purchase 18 months ago. Each company holds a top five position
in my portfolio and I have been peeling off shares so I can rebalance my
holdings.

As you can see both are well above the S%P 500.
http://finance.yahoo.com/charts#chart3:symbol=drys;range=2y;compare=sfl+
^gspc;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;logscale=on;source=undefined

At current prices I like SFL as their current dividend w/ profit sharing is now
around 8%. They do not have the exposure to the change in the daily rates and
continue to make good money financing tankers and offshore drilling rigs.

My DRYs position is currently a four bagger and my best performing investment
in the portfolio over this time period. If current daily charter rates can hold
for the remaining of the year (this is a huge assumption), then DRYs profits
should double next year and their forward PE will be less than 5.

DRYS is one of the most leveraged dry ship bulkers w/ very short term charters
in their fleet. It works great as the daily charter rates increase but the
company can loose a lot of money if these rates tank.

I plan to sell more DRYs on prices between $45-$50 which could occur if the
company can lock in longer term charters next quarter at these high daily
rates.
======================================================

With the recent interest rate news, I have been looking at capitalizing on the
utility company sell off. I picked up more ELP (Companhia Paranaense de
Energia) at $14.10 with the strategy of writing some covered calls on any snap
back rally. The stock has rallied over 10% in the last two days. Perhaps this
is due to Brazil lowering the rate on the Real.

Have you noticed any bargains in the utility sector? There might have been some
over reation to the interest rate chatter and the baby got thrown out with the
bath water. Any special situations show up on your watch list?

EKS. You are tough to have SFL (and DRYS) as top holdings,imo. I've had SFL for
several years (not that big a position), haven't sold any, but have considered
it many, many times. Missed DRYS. Also ELP. With ELP I seem to be away every
time it's down and reluctant to buy when I see it's up.

I've been looking through utility sector, and finding nothing that appeals to
me. Stocks are up (domestic utilities), and with many showing p/e of 15x or
more, that seems too high a p/e, imo, for a buy. (Of course, interests rates
are down now from the bad old days, so utility stock dividend yields and p/e
might be more in synch with that. I still don't find the high p/e's attractive
now though, regardless of prospects of individual companies.)

Meanwhile predictably same store sales seem to be declining. I conclude that

Ive never been to a friendlys.

I did read this from last month....
Apparently the current president met his future wife at one.

George Condos met his future wife at a Friendly’s restaurant, one he hung out
at while growing up in Webster. His parents love the chain, he said, and so do
his children. This generational aspect of the Wilbraham-based icon is one of
the things that appealed to Condos as he mulled a job opportunity he eventually
accepted — president and CEO of the company — as well as a stern challenge: to
re-energize a somewhat tired brand.

George Condos was asked for a current copy of Friendly’s lunch/dinner menu for
a quick read of its contents.

“Have you got half an hour?” he joked, implying that he wouldn’t put ‘quick’
and this menu together in the same sentence.

Indeed, as he flipped through the menu, and flipped, and flipped, he passed by
traditional items like burgers, wraps, baskets, and salads, and eventually
reached grilled flounder, steaks, and ‘homestyle meatloaf.’

“This is not what we’re really about — it takes the focus away from what makes
Friendly’s great,” he said of those last few items, adding that they are far
removed from the company’s core of hand-held food items, the signature Fribble
milkshake, and ice cream. They serve largely as a distraction to the customers,
but also to managers and kitchen staff who must order and prepare foods that
are ordered infrequently at best.

“And this is just one of our menus,” said Condos, fanning out different models
for breakfast, desserts, and children. Simplifying and shortening them are just
a few facets of a very broad plan that Condos, who took the role of president
and CEO at Friendly’s in mid-January, has for re-energizing and contemporizing
the 72-year-old chain that has been in the news lately — but for mostly the
wrong reasons.

There have been many stories in publications ranging from the Wall Street
Journal to the Boston Globe that have chronicled an ongoing proxy fight
involving the company’s largest shareholder, lawsuits filed by 93-year-old
co-founder S. Prestley Blake against its current chairman alleging
self-dealing, and, most recently, the commissioning of Goldman Sachs to explore
options for the company moving forward, including a possible sale.

All of the above has become a “distraction” (that’s a word Condos would use
often) for the new CEO, who came to Friendly’s after a lengthy stay at Dunkin’
Donuts, where, among other things, he led a repositioning and brand-development
effort that more than tripled the number of stores in the Northeast and took
sales from $400 million to more than $2 billion.

Just five months into his assignment at Friendly’s, Condos sees several signs
of progress. Sales are improving, franchisees are, by his account, expressing
more confidence in the chain, and steps are being taken to simplify the menu
while adding new products.

These include an Angus beef burger now being tested; iced lattes, with flavors
ranging from French vanilla to caramel, which will be private-labeled in most
markets, but sold in the Albany area under the name Seattle’s Best Coffee, the
company owned by Starbucks; some new cold beverages called tropical chillers to
be ready for summer; and a planned new chocolate/chocolate chip ice cream
featuring Ghirardelli chocolate.

Co-branding with companies like Ghirardelli and Seattle’s Best is one of the
many strategies moving forward, said Condos, adding that marketing efforts will
be retooled to reflect the many changes within the chain. They will still
emphasize the family aspect of the business, but also focus on the younger
audience that is driving many trends in the hospitality sector and society in
general.

“We want to increase our relevance with young adults by adding contemporary
cold beverages and healthy menu items,” he explained, “and we also intend to
improve quality by phasing out low-volume, high-complexity items.”

In this issue, BusinessWest looks at the many things Condos has on his plate as
he tries to provide a needed spark for a chain with a glorious past but an
uncertain future.

Shaking Things Up

Condos told BusinessWest that he’s probably eating at Friendly’s three or four
times a week these days.

He’s now well-known at the restaurant next door to the company’s headquarters
on Boston Road in Wilbraham, but, outwardly, just another customer at the many
other locations he’s visited. However, he’s not interested in undercover work.

He makes a point of introducing himself and seeking out the manager of every
Friendly’s he visits, and comes ready with a long list of questions. These are
information-gathering sessions, and to date they’ve been quite eye-opening,
with informal reviews running the gamut when it comes to overall grades.

“We have some excellent restaurants, but there is some inconsistency,” he said,
adding that bringing all of the chain’s 500 or so restaurants up to the same
high level of quality, in terms of food, service, and appearance, would be his
broad job description. And this was an assignment that appealed to him when he
was approached by a recruiter last fall and asked to consider taking the helm
of a chain to which he had both a personal attachment and some professional
curiosity.

After all, Condos met his wife, Laurie, at a Friendly’s in the Worcester suburb
of Webster. The two were among the many neighborhood teenagers who liked
hanging out at the eatery — a tableau repeated in countless communities across
the Northeast over the past seven decades.

Indeed, there are now at least four generations that have grown up with
Friendly’s. Some of these constituencies have specific needs and tastes, said
Condos, adding that the chain’s mission moving forward is to properly address
these preferences (lattes, for example) — but without trying to be all things
to all people.

This may sound confusing, but for Condos, it’s rather simple. The plan is to
focus on core products — ones that appeal to all generations, from those that
blog to the one that fought World War II. Meanwhile, he wants to add some new
products to the menu that appeal to what he called “young people” without
elaborating.
Condos will bring to this assignment some extensive experience with both
restaurants and brands. He started acquiring it at Dairy Queen soon after
graduating from the University of Vermont with a degree in Business
Administration and Management.

“That’s where I learned how to run a restaurant,” he said of his stint with the
company, where he eventually assumed the role of regional manager of Operations
and Development.

At Dunkin’ Donuts, which he joined in 1986, Condos held a number of positions,
including area vice president for the Northeast, U.S., Canada, Europe, and the
Middle East, as well as vice president of Marketing, Development, and
Operations, and, most recently, brand officer for the chain. In that capacity,
he was lead executive for Dunkin’ Donuts in the U.S., and responsible for
developing brand strategy and execution for the nearly 5,000 franchised stores,
which generated more than $4.3 billion in sales when he left, voluntarily, last
year following the second of two ownership changes.

Condos said he wasn’t looking for work — his intention was to begin a career
serving on corporate boards — when he was called by the recruiter last fall.
He met several times with the Friendly’s board, and became intrigued with the
opportunity to breathe some life into the chain that he knew so well as a
customer.

“I believed that Friendly’s had some great opportunity that was not being
leveraged,” he said. “I saw a brand that has a unique emotional attachment with
its customers that was similar to the two brands I had worked with previously;
there are certain brands in the world where the consumer loves the brand, and
Friendly’s is one of them.

“As a consumer and an executive within the industry,” he continued, “I saw a
number of opportunities where I believed my experience could significantly help
the Friendly’s brand.”

The Company’s Bread and Butter

When asked about the board controversy and other matters he lumped in a
category of “things beyond my control,” Condos feigned turning off the tape
recorder on the table in front of him.

As it continued running, he spoke again of distractions, but how ultimately
they weren’t keeping him from his appointed rounds. “It’s a distraction from a
time standpoint, but also a distraction for the brand in the marketplace. That
said, I was hired to re-energize the brand, and that’s where my primary focus
lies.”

Condos said he spoke at length with Prestley Blake — still one of the largest
shareholders and one who many say simply can’t let go of the venture he started
— soon after he arrived at the company, and talked with him again recently,
when the discussion included Blake’s positive review of a visit to a Friendly’s
in Florida.
As for the proxy fight, Condos said he can really only watch as matters play
themselves out. Texas businessman Sardar Biglari, the largest shareholder with
15% of the stock, asked for a seat on the board of directors last fall, and
Friendly’s gave a conditional ‘yes’; it stipulated that he not seek any
additional seats. But Biglari refused, and in a letter sent to the board in
early March said he and a business partner are running against two incumbents
who are seeking re-election at the annual shareholder’s meeting. Billboards
calling for the election of Buglari and his partner have gone up in a few
locations locally.

And regarding Goldman Sachs’ work, Condos said there are many options that the
company will be considering, none of which he cared to discuss in any detail.
“We’re not saying that there will be a sale, or that a sale is the only
option,” he explained, adding that the review work is expected to be wrapped up
by year’s end.

By then, he said, moving on to the many things that are within his control, he
expects to be able to qualify and quantify significant progress in his mission
to bring more consistency and overall quality to his product — which he
described as both the food in the restaurants and the manner in which it is
delivered.

This will be a three-pronged approach, focusing on menu choices, service, and
the appearance of the restaurants, he said, adding that steps are being taken
with regard to each.

On the menu side of the equation, simplification is the order of the day, he
said, emphasizing greater focus on handheld items (burgers, melts, wraps, and
chicken-strip baskets, for example), cold beverages, including the new iced
lattes and tropical chillers, and ice cream. The chain will still offer
appetizers, entr&#233;e salads, kids meals, and breakfast items, but it will
focus its marketing, menu, and operations on the core items.

This approach can be seen with that lengthy lunch/dinner menu, which was
actually made one page bigger, with a large insert touting five new burgers,
including the tomato pesto provolone and ‘Chicago firehouse’ models. Subsequent
inserts will feature other menu staples, said Condos, adding that the new
approach is already registering results, with a noticeable increase in sales.

Meatloaf and grilled flounder are still on the menu, but perhaps not for much
longer.

“Those are not core to what Friendly’s is, and continuing to expand in that
direction is a distraction from the main part of the menu; it makes it more
complex and harder to execute,” said Condos, adding that it took years for the
Friendly’s menu to get large and complex, and the process of reversing that
trend won’t happen overnight.

As for service, the company is introducing something called the ‘Friendly
Service Way,’ a model designed to vastly improve the company’s recent poor
grades in customer service, at least as measured by Consumer Reports.

“When your brand name is Friendly’s, you absolutely have to be the leader in
the industry around what great, friendly service looks like, ands that’s what
we intend to do,” he said. “I’ve recognized a big opportunity for us to improve
our operating standards within the restaurants.

“My own experience and my own research shows that we have some inconsistent
restaurants,” he continued. “We want to significantly improve the guest
experience through speed, cleanliness, and friendly service.”

Meanwhile, many of the restaurants will be getting a new, more contemporary
look, said Condos, adding that the same can be said of the company’s marketing
images.

In the past, the company has focused on families, generations of same, and the
great Friendly’s tradition, he explained, adding that while this has been
somewhat effective in generating sales, a stronger emphasis on food, including
tight, close-up images of specific menu items, will be much more so.

While addressing the menu, service, and the look and feel of the restaurants,
Condos is also focusing on the broad and important matter of
franchisee-relations, a task that took on even more significance after it was
announced that the strategic initiatives to be explored would include a sale.

Condos said he has met with franchisees individually and at district meetings,
and believes he’s generating some enthusiasm and support for his plans moving
forward.

“They’re supportive of the brand, they love the brand, and they’re looking
forward to sales-building initiatives that my team and I are working on,
including a stronger focus on the core part of the menu,” he said. “They’re
also excited about improvements in our marketing creatives.

“One of my first priorities was to develop a great working relationship with
the franchisees,” he continued. “Coming out of 30 years of being in the
franchise business, I know how important such a relationship is to
re-energizing this brand.”

That’s a Wrap

As he talked with BusinessWest about his plans moving forward, Condos displayed
the new rounded tubs, called “squrounds,” that started serving as containers
for half gallons of ice cream earlier this spring.

They replace the rectangular cardboard boxes, or bricks, that have been used
almost since the company’s beginning. The change wasn’t a slap at tradition,
but rather an acknowledgement that the boxes simply weren’t customer-friendly,
or at least as much as the new model.

“Have you ever tried to use a round scoop in a square corner?” he asked. “It
doesn’t work.”

Neither, apparently, does grilled flounder. At least not at this chain, which
is trying to shake things up and simplify them at the same time.

ROG, CHS, KFN:

I'll up my losing position in tech stock ROG by a few shares now.

I've closed out my remaining shares in clothing retailer CHS today.

I've been trying to rid myself of my position in KKR Financial Corp (KFN).
Would like to get higher prices for my remaining shares -- stock has dropped
past couple of days and I've slowed my sales. My exit is a consequence my being
so diversified that there are going to instances where I'm just not on top of
important stuff in a particular company in which I hold shares. The company
restructured recently, and the ramifications weren't clear to me in the
announcement: I didn't really notice the importance of the restructure to me as
a stockholder. Company wasn't particularly clear about it. And it's still not
stated correctly or clearly when I go to the company's website. Essentially the
company changed from a reit structure so that they could lever themselves (They
won't have to pay out 90% of earnings that a reit requires.), and also so that
they can take advantage of opportunities that reit format prevents them from
undertaking. KKR, Blackstone ... these buyout guys and their leverage -g-
The resultant change means that the company has an llc structure now. Which now
I realize at KFN means that earnings flow direct to stockholders. Deductions
will apparently flow too. Which means stockholders have become "partners".
Which translates to, as a consequence of all this, I will be getting a K-1
form. No no no---not for me. I've got too big a position in this thing in an
IRA, and I'm not wanting to deal with K-1's and UBTI (unrelated business
taxable income), assuming the high dividend is even maintained (which it may
not be).

4.95B$, so 41% are worth 2.03B$. In addition we have an assortment of other
businesses that do 170M$ in HK$ of EBITDA/year.

So it looks to me that by acquiring Melco (HK), I get a participation in MPEL
at a 17.5% discount plus as a wildcard some other businesses for free. Since
Hongkong does not have a capital gains tax there is no tax liability if Melco
(HK) decided to sell MPEL. I hope my math is correct. I bought a position in
0200.HK tonight and tomorrow morning i will sell my starter position in MPEL.
Net of my impending sell of MPEL i will double my bet in Melco.

Weakness in POL today. IMO no doubt to SHLM's forcast.
A. Schulman Inc., down $2.65 at $21.31.

The supplier of high-performance plastics and resins lowered its 2007 forecast
amid continued weakness in the European and North American markets.

Adding shares of big pharma: PFE, AZN, SNY.

Sanofi at new 12-mo. low; its weight-loss drug failed to get approval.
(Apparently the drug causes suicidal impulses.)
I'm viewing it as an opportunity to build a position in the stock.

Ditto AZN which has been falling.

I had some KDN back in 2006 and had let it go in April last year. The sale
turned out to be a timely one, however the stock has come back well in due time
to exceed those May 2006 peak prices. Good company, but no so sure it's really
undervalued here. The market of course appears to see it differently.

I do like the valuation on RS but its a stock on the tip of everyone's tongue
these days. Even with that consideration I took a stab at it yesterday because
the dip looked inviting, and the valuation reasonable. Buying and holding that
since 2004 was a very timely investment.

I listened to the conference call today on edv acquisition and was not thrilled
to hear that acquistion will dillute bv as only $2.1MM of real assets will be
acquired for $92MM in stock at sub $10 prices. The benefits to shareholders
from the merger on the other hand are murky. only 60% of the new shares
generated to managment will be lockedup, and we are told that the transaction
will bring more clarity which will they hope permit edv to be valued more like
an investment bank at a premium to book. I dont see the acquisition as proposed
as a benefit to shareholders so my vote will be no. Only this time I will make
sure I get to vote. I cant see dilluting shareholder nav by some 27% with the
hope that the market will view this as a big positive development. I would much
rather continue the existing status quo of increasing nav by 30-50% a year. I
wish management would try to align themselves with shareholders as opposed to
sticking their hands into our pockets.

Interesting way to reach a goal. They have said repeatedly that they wanted and
expected that EDV would sell above NAV. What a way to accomplish that goal,
make sure that NAV is reduced. Sometimes you gotta wonder what management's
real goal is, to increase shareholder value, or line their own pockets.

In any event, harshly ruling this out as an investment possibly might be
somewhat premature. I've seen things like this happen before in other stocks,
was dead set against it, and all for naught, as the shares continued to
increase in value, tripling within 2 years. The market works in mysterious ways
sometimes.

Hard to believe that management hasn't thought this merger out well enough
beforehand to consider the ramifications and potential impacts. My impression
of management from prior conference calls was that they were very astute and
knew what they were doing.

IMOS was recommended in Barrons today in the mid-year roundtable by Scott
Black.

How about another name, Scott?

ChipMOS Technologies [IMOS] is a small Taiwan company that trades in the U.S.
via American depositary receipts. It sells for 6.49, and there are 73.8 million
fully diluted shares, for a market capitalization of $479 million.
Semiconductor testing is 60% of revenue, and assembly 40%. ChipMOS has a broad
base of customers, including Hynix, Samsung, National Semiconductor, Sharp,
Toshiba and Fujitsu. It serves four different markets: DRAM, flash memory,
liquid-crystal display and mixed-signal. Consumer electronics is a big driver
of growth.

In the past, the business has been cyclical. Earnings peaked at 79 cents a
share in 2004, and return on equity at 18.8% Last year they did 74 cents and
16.7% ROE. Earnings will rebound this year. Book value is $8.55 a share, so the
stock sells at 0.76 times book. There is almost no goodwill. The debt-to-equity
ratio is about 0.5. Free cash flow could be about $50 million this year. ROE
will come in around 11%-12% but is on track to get above 15%.

Why the downturn?

Revenue was up 31% in the first quarter, though earnings were down a few
pennies as the average selling prices on test and assembly fell 5% to 10%.
Conservatively, ChipMOS will do about $750 million in revenue this year. It
could net $71 million after taxes, or 96 cents, fully diluted. If margins come
back a little, it could do $1.04. The midpoint is $1, so let's use that. The
stock trades for roughly 6.5 times earnings. It's cheap. And 39% of current
capacity is booked through 2009 on long-term contracts. It would help if DRAM
prices firmed a bit, but we own Micron [MU], and the same dynamics that might
make that go up 15%-20% could push this stock up two or three points, or
35%-40%.

EDV.TO - I feel very similar. The benefits seem murky and the cost seems high.
It does not seem shareholder centered. However, the market seems to like it (at
least for now), so what do I know. But it's difficult for me to quantify the
value of EDV financial.

DJ Venezuela Mining Min: Sidor Nationalization Not An Option

Dow Jones Real-Time News for InvestorsSM
11:18 a.m. 06/15/2007

CARACAS (Dow Jones)--Venezuela has reached production agreements with the Sidor
steel company and there are now no plans to nationalize it, the country's
mining minister said Friday.

"We've managed to reach some very important agreements with Sidor," Mining
Minister Jose Khan told reporters. "With these agreements we've moved along in
the sense that (Sidor) will maintain the same ownership structure."

Sidor is majority controlled by the Argentine-Italian conglomerate Techint
through its subsidiary Ternium (TX). Roughly 20% of the company is in state
hands and another 20% is owned by the company's workers.

Khan said the company agreed to make as much steel output available in the
domestic market as needed at three different price levels that "will never sit
above the international prices," according to the minister. "Our first proposal
was to buy Sidor," Khan said. "Then we had other proposals such as increasing
the government's stake," but they failed to reach an accord.

Re: TS

I'm still out of it but looking to get back in. TS stock has gone nowhere for
more than a year. It is due for a move. Perhaps the market will wait to see
that the Hydril integration is going well and that OCTG volumes in North
America have recovered (MVK)... or may be WTIC takes off this week and carries
OIH (and TS) with it to new highs. If TS trades above 52, it is a buy, IMO.

I do like the steels and I just wished I had bought lots more MT at $43 when it
broke out earlier this year. TS chart currently bears similarities. I buy
fundamentals but look at charts for exit and entry points.

After finally getting a chance to listen to the CC on EDV.TO, it looks to me
like potential reported earnings per share for EDV.TO will go up significantly
based on slide 9 even given the dilution which is stretched over 3 years. Not
as bad as I thought from what you had mentioned. EPS should help drive
valuation more so than book value. BV stays low because of the large payouts to
shareholders by Endeavour Financial. I tend to thing EPS is a better driver of
stock prices at times then book value. My take is stay the course.

I continue to own a way overweight position in edv, however i do plan to vote
against the merger as I dont feel its a good proposition as a shareholder to
pay 45 times book and then release 40% of the shares right away. I would be
willing to pay 4 times book and or have a 3 year lockout on all shares. Bu the
way the deal is currently structured makes no sense to me as a shareholder.
