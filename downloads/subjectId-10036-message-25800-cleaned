re monagen Thanks for the update . Im glad I followed you in for a few shares.
In retrospect I should have bought more. I expect that part of the move up is
that there isnt much in the float.
Also once you buy into it there is no compelling reason to sell. Either its a
home run or its a dud. I have no selling target here. Happy to see that energy
is recovering today CNQ PWE and CHK all up nicely for the time being.

I repurchased stakes in a couple of companies over the last two days that I has
sold previously-BQE.V and SLK.V . SLK.V as it had sold off quite a bit. and
BQE.V because they have a new deal with the largest Copper mine owner in China
as well as with COdelco the largest miner in CHile. This may not be a value
play per se but I wanted to bring it to the attention of readers of this
thread, as it could be another home run.

This company has a system for purifying the waste water coming out of mines and
recovering the metal therin.
Apparently from the contracts being signed this more than pie in the sky. The
company;s name is bioteq enviromental so possibly people think its biotech
related.

Selkirk is a Zinc play, that continues to be recommended by the Coffin Bros.
who are well regarded analysts.

Hi Spekulatius - How long do you believe before the market values MWA at
private market valuations? I think it will take a few quarters of very positive
earnings and sales reports. I am considering buying more shares at the current
lows and selling August $15 calls. Have you evaluated a buy write strategy for
a portion of your shares?

What's the symbol for the "b" shares and can you sell covered calls on these
shares?

Stock should have a fair value of $18-$20 based on an industry PE of 17. I
would like to see better coverage of their debit from operating free flow cash.
This can be accomplished from increased operating efficiencies from the spin
off.

I will be watching the insider transactions to see if there is a net "buy"
bias. Management already received a lot of new shares after the spin off.
Hopefully they will not sell these shares soon.

P.S. I am also evaluating Cummins Inc. (CMI) for a new starter position. I like
the long term prospects for the company specifically in their mid-size diesel
engines (they will supply the diesel engine for the new 2007 jeeps). At a PE of

WMSI has land worth $15-30 million. Its on the books at ZERO as they paid $600k
for 40 acres and sold 1 acre for about a million. (The other 39 acres are on
the books at ZERO)

I was wrong about the CEO buying, his 72 year old father and founder has been
buying.

But, he is 71+ years old.

There is some question about their ability to use NOLs to shield gains on real
estate.

The plan....eventually...is to sell their expensive land and move to a less
expensive area.

Now, they are real close to DC and the bus station folks wants some of their
land.

Its potluck on the 2nd quarter.
But the 72 year old founder aint buying for nothin !

Biggest risk is 3.65 million shares out. SOX savings could be significant. But,

re cnq from Fairholme Q3 investor report:

Since July, oil prices have dived and, since last winter’s peak, natural gas
prices have imploded. Greed has turned to fear. While impossible to predict the
depth and breadth of the crowd’s despair, we do know how to take advantage.
Periods of volatility and stress sometimes allow what we buy cheap to become
cheaper, creating unusual opportunity. Fairholme’s history includes many
instances of short-term “embarrassment” leading to long-term victory.

This past quarter witnessed Canadian Natural Resources’ stock down from a peak
of $65 to below $45, where we began backing-up the truck. With great
owner-managers committed to shareholder value and a deeply undervalued asset
base, Canadian Natural Resources has become Fairholme’s second $500+ million
investment (after Berkshire Hathaway).
The era of cheap oil seems over, and whether the price is $80 or $40 in the
short-term makes little difference to our thesis. World oil exports continue to
be dominated by a handful of undemocratic countries, some with questionable
stability and politics. Supply and demand are in much closer balance than was
the case during the last downturn. And the final straw breaking the back of the
cheap oil argument is the continued modernization and growth of both India and
China, which will occur whether the West grows or not.

In the meantime, Canadian Natural’s strong balance sheet and cash flows have
funded the Horizon oil sands project and supported the recent acquisition of
Anadarko Canada at an opportunistically cheap price. Next year, much of
Canadian Natural’s output is hedged at over $50 per barrel and in 2008, the
first phase of Horizon (110,000 barrel of light sweet oil per day) comes
online. The upside: the company is capable of tripling cash flows within the
next seven years. The downside: ncreased production will counter-balance
further price declines leaving us with today’s significant free cash flow
yields. We like those odds.

Also 1/22/07 CNQ announced they were buying back up to 5% of the stock over the
next 12 months beginning 1/24/07.

Yes, they are having serious liquidity issues. Thus the "going concern"
statement by the auditors.

They are cash poor but land rich.

It bothers me that they keep having to pay fees to the bank to extend their due
dates because the loan is as secure as can be.

The LAND is worth $15-30 million which is $4.11-8.22 per share.

And they have other book value of about $1.25 per share.

And, I think its possible that they return to profitibilty within the next year
to 18 months when the state of Virgina gets their act together regarding
infrastructure spending.

The biggest concern to me is the possibility that their NOLs will not be usable
for their real estate gains.

If they sell all their land close to DC, they would likely buy more in a lower
cost area but it wouldnt be as much as the proceeds which means they might have
to pay a big chunk of change to the government or buy real estate for income.

This is both an asset play and a turnaround play.

The questions are WHEN they return to profitibility and WHEN they sell the land
and for how much...net.

Time will tell.

I suspect that they may deregister to save some on the $140k per year in
auditing fees they now pay.

But they have over 400 shareholders of record and not many odd lot holders so a
simple odd lot tender offer isnt going to get them under 300.

That may mean a reverse split. Something Im not terribly fond of.

I have been looking at VCP too. I am thinking of starting a new position in
this company as they are competitors with ARA. VCP has excellent free flow cash
flow, a forward PE of 12 (similar to ARA) and a higher book value that ARA at
$11/share (61% of book for VCP vs 38% of book for ARA).

They key to maintaining high margins is to fully utilize their plant capacity.
ARA recently announced a partnership that achieves a high utilization of their
facilities, doubling their output. VCP has spare capacity and may also be
looking for such a partner. ARA has higher operating margins because they
appear to be operating their facilities more efficiently (20% better than VCP).

VCP may be selling at a discount to ARA by $3/share because of their operating
inefficiencies. Most of the outstanding shares for VCP are held by
institutions.

Any thoughts?

canroys, from my broker:

Energy trusts scale back payouts
VIRGINIA GALT AND DAVID EBNER

Friday, January 19, 2007

TORONTO AND CALGARY — Four Canadian energy trusts slashed
distributions to unit holders this week, and more are expected to
follow, because of falling oil and gas prices and uncertainty in the
capital markets over the federal tax changes for income trusts.

Precision Drilling Trust and Enterra Energy Trust said Friday that
they were reducing their monthly cash distributions, a day after
Shiningbank Energy Income Fund and Progress Energy Trust announced cuts.

These cuts were not unexpected and three or four other energy trusts
are likely under pressure to make similar moves, said Sandy McIntyre,
senior vice-president of Sentry Select Capital Corp., in an interview
Friday.

While he would not name the companies he believes are most likely to
have to cut distributions, Mr. McIntyre said investors should watch
for several tell-tale characteristics. "High debt to cash flow and
high trailing payout ratio — it is very likely that these people are
going to be put in a situation where they are forced to cut. One of
the things I think is a pretty good indication of risk is: What is
your distribution yield?" said Mr. McIntyre.

Analysts in Calgary noted that the energy trusts with the highest
yields on the S&P/TSX energy trust index are True Energy Trust, which
announced on Monday that it is converting back to a traditional
corporation, and Shiningbank, which on Thursday announced its third
distribution cut in the past year.

The next four names, all near 20 per cent yields, are Paramount Energy
Trust, Harvest Energy Trust, Daylight Resources Trust and Trilogy
Energy Trust, indicating investors think their distributions could be
in trouble.

One Calgary broker advised clients on Friday that others likely to cut
distributions are Thunder Energy Trust, Pengrowth Energy Trust and
Provident Energy Trust.

Thunder isn't in the energy trust index and its yield on Friday was
26.7 per cent.

Mr. McIntyre said that the cuts by Precision Drilling, Enterra,
Shiningbank and Progress were "absolutely the correct thing to do" in
the face of falling commodity prices.

Oil and gas prices are expected to recover but, in the meantime, the
trusts have to cut distributions, analysts said.

Precision Drilling, Canada's largest energy services trust, announced
Friday that it is reducing its monthly cash distribution by 39 per
cent, to 19 cents a unit from 31 cents. The Calgary-based oil and gas
services firm said the move was forced by a "persistent decline in
natural gas and oil price trends."

On the heels of Precision Drilling's announcement, Calgary-based
Enterra Energy Trust said it was halving its cash distribution to 6
cents (U.S.) from 12 cents. The company cited three factors:
"significantly weaker commodity prices, capital market uncertainty
resulting from the recent tax changes proposed by the Canadian
government and early conversion from debentures to trusts."

In afternoon trading on the TSX Friday, units in Precision Drilling
were weaker by 92 cents (Canadian) to $26.70, while units of Enterra
tumbled by more than 13 per cent to $8.30.

Shiningbank Energy Income Fund, which cut its distributions by 35 per
cent to 15 cents a unit from 23 cents, was up 25 cents to $13.03 in
Friday afternoon trading. In a note to clients Friday, analyst Brad
Borggard of CIBC World Markets had observed that Shiningbank closed
down only 3.6 per cent on the day Thursday, after announcing the cuts,
"indicating . . .that the market had partially priced in the
expectation of a cut." Mr. Borggard reiterated his "sector performer"
rating and left his target price for the units unchanged at $13.50.

"Similar to other trusts that have recently revised their distribution
rates, Shiningbank cited weak natural gas prices as a primary driver
of the cut," Mr. Borggard wrote.

Precision Drilling Trust explained Friday that its financial
performance is closely tied to that of its customers. "As lower
commodity prices are realized by natural gas and oil producers, their
ability to fund exploration and development activities may become
impaired," the company said. "This has resulted in a reduction in
equipment utilization on a seasonally adjusted basis for precision."

Precision provides access to an extensive fleet of contract drilling
rigs, service rigs, camps, snubbing units, wastewater treatment units
and rental equipment, backed by technical support services.

Keith Conrad, president and chief executive officer of Enterra, said
his company's decision to cut its distributions "is the prudent
business course in the light of present uncertainties.

"It is fundamental to our business to maintain a healthy reinvestment
program in our core areas and on our extensive undeveloped land base,"
he said.

"While I remain optimistic about the long-term strength of energy
prices, at present it is wise to preserve maximum flexibility for
generating long-term value. In the meantime, we continue to execute
our business plan and to assess alternatives in order to remain
competitive in light of the government's recently announced Tax
Fairness Plan."

The federal decision to tax income trusts was also a factor in
Shiningbank's cut, Mr. Borggard said in his research note. "Management
believes a lower payout ratio model is required given the higher cost
of capital the trust sees following the government's decision to begin
taxing trusts."

Precision Drilling said its distribution of 19 cents per unit for the
month of January will be payable on Feb. 15. The trust had previously
announced that its distribution reinvestment plan had been suspended
until further notice.

The reduced Enterra distribution, also to be paid Feb. 15, "is
consistent with Enterra's policy of maintaining a conservative payout
ratio in order to fund organic growth," the company said.

Since July, 2006, oil and gas benchmark prices have fallen 25 per cent
on a company weighted average basis, Enterra said.

"Oil has dropped 35 per cent from peak values and mild winter weather
across North America has left natural gas distillate and fuel oil
inventories unusually high. These circumstances have resulted in soft
and volatile commodity markets."

The federal government's decision to make distributions from income
trusts taxable in the hands of the trust, similar to the tax treatment
of corporate dividends, has also created uncertainty.

"This unexpected announcement has put into question the existing
business plans of many income trusts and hindered the ability of many
trusts to freely access capital markets at competitive costs of
capital," the company said.

Using a conservative outlook for 2007 commodity prices, "this change
will result in the trust's distribution ratio for 2007 being below its
target payout range of 60 per cent to 70 per cent," Enterra said.

Mr. McIntyre said the business is very capital intensive.

"When you end up with a situation where your production declines have
to be met and your commodity price falls, the ratio between the
dollars available for distribution and the dollars available for capex
changes — and you are forced to cut your distributions," Mr. McIntyre
said.

&#169; The Globe and Mail

here's my take on it all:

the price mostly moves in tandem with oil and gas, which is down

the canadian tax situation is priced in already and priced in as a worst case
scenerio

the canadian government is making way for a smooth transition - the trusts can
double their equity bases before 2011 - also can convert to a corporation with
no penalty

if they go corporate, they will find ways, like all corporation, to dodge
taxes, hence not pay out the full corp tax rate

since gas and oil are significantly down, I would expect distributions to get
cut

having said all that, I may, in the future switch HTE to PWE - HTE isn't as
high quality as PWE and HTE made a series of acquisitions last year that have
yet to play out - the refinery acquisition is a positive

HTE vs PWE. I agree that PWE has advantages over HTE, but higher quality, not
sure what that means. Double check my data, but here's my take:

HTE
RLI 9.5 yrs
dividend announced - pays 18.2%
70% crude, 30% NG
60% hedged in 2007
refinery - good or bad? I think good. It does not deplete.

PWE
RLI 10.5 yrs
dividend also just announced - pays 11.7%
has oil sands
53% NG
34% hedged in 2007

tough call. I own them both, but greedily own more HTE.

Carl, do you still think HTE is worth a consideration. I would like to add it
to an IRA account and let it go for a few years.

Can you see any serious downside to this. I was wondering if the possible cut
in their high interest rate has already been factored into the stock price, now
down to around 22. Or does it drop like a rock when they announce the interest
rate cut.

At 17% they can afford to cut it some, I guess.

Any thoughts about adding it here.

trust downside? everything has downside. i believe HTE has already hedged
around 60% of 2007 production, but check their presentation on their website.
their cash flow per share was CAN$1.30 in Q3, while dividends per share were
CAN$1.04. so there is room to maintain dividends. it is reassuring that they
recently announced the dividend and left it unchanged. two trusts that recently
lower their dividends are CNE and AAV. Their stock did not seem to take a hit.
so maybe that tells us of limited downside.

i think the upside is large. not only would we get increased dividends, but
stock appreciation. to spread your risk out, maybe you should buy an assortment
of the high dividend trusts. PWI 14%, CNE 15%, PGH 15%, HTE 18%, DAY-TO 24%,
AAV 14%. But maybe the diversification is a delusion. They all have
presentations worth reading on their websites. I own these, but others have
been mentioned here also:

it would seem to me that the downside on HTE should be fairly limited unless
oil and gas prices fall significantly from here, which is always a possibility,
no matter what t. boone pickens tells you <g>

i figure that the new tax rules are factored in at this price, and in fact,
since the effect of those rules doesn't begin for many years, it is probably
more than priced in now

it's certainly possible that they will reduce their payout next quarter, or
later in the year, especially if oil prices stay in the low 50s or drop to the
40s...i would think that they could reduce the payout to the low double digits
in terms of yield without doing much damage to the stock price

HTE is only a very small position for me, so while i see it with no more than
average risk, and reasonable reward, especially if i can keep selling calls
against it each month, it's not one i would feel comfortably buying a big
position in...i don't think it will rally significantly unless the tax rule
changes are revoked, or unless oil prices surge significantly, neither of which
seem likely to me at this point

others here probably have a better feel for the various canroy investments,
just remember that a balanced view on energy will give you the most reasonable
evaluation...you have to throw out the views that oil can only go up from here,
etc.

they publish the IBD 100, and UCTT shows up one week near the top, then the
next week it is completely out, because the price went over 15 for one week,
then back below

while they have some good ideas on capital preservation and owning the leaders

strategy to a T. Sure, a glance at the IBD 100 and 100 charts would make one
feel incompetent, but they are resultant charts based on prior action, not hand
picked stocks. The Cup and Handle w/the CANSLIM method has only been useful
when a Value stock exhibits those chart pattern characteristics. Buying stocks
at 50 to 100 PE ratios 20X book just because they have been going up in the
past will almost always result in damage. That said, the paper has some value
for its database and wide coverage of stocks. The Wall St. Journal in turn as a
daily has too much advertising and not enough stock meat. More often than not,
an IBD article published on a stock is known as the kiss of death quite
accurately.

Your timing on the GAIN buy was pretty good. They haven't really ramped the
dividend like I was hoping though. And hasn't really done great for me like
ACAS and AINV.

The high yield stock that I like right now is PES-UN.TO or PKGFF in the United
States. Almost a 20% yield even accounting for the 15% Canadian withholding.
Barring much lower oil and gas prices I think it should outperform.

There are some reasons for the sell off which may or not be remedied. But I
think the sell off in this one is way overdone.

Thanks for the reply on HTE. In it you mentioned t. boone pickens and that
brought another question to mind.

I recall seeing him on the Charlie Rose show quite a few months ago, and he
seemed to be suggesting that water was going to become the new "oil" of the
future, and that he was moving in the direction of securing water rights
somewhere, and building a very large water pipeline.

Have you heard anything about such matters, and has he formed any kind of
company to engage in water development? I have been watching SWWC (southwest
water company) for about a year, but still do not see any fundamental change in
the stocks pattern.

It seems that water might be a good bet into the future, but hot sure how best
to add water to my long term portfolio.

I found this article:

http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/us/bulksales/texas/

The notorious oilman has acquired land overlying the Ogallala aquifer and wants
to pump and sell as much as 200,000 acre-feet of groundwater annually to one of
Texas’ metropolitan centers.

A new undertaking by Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens is even more disconcerting.
Pickens has been acquiring acreage overlying the Ogallala aquifer with hopes
that he could pump and sell the as much as 200,000 AFY of water to one of the
state’s metropolitan centers – El Paso, Lubbock, San Antonio, or Dallas-Fort
Worth. Ogallala is already severely depleted. The West Texas farmers rely on
the aquifer for water. The aquifer’s minimal recharge rate of less then one AFY
means that its users are mining fossil water that will not be replenished.

Pickens projects that his prices would be adjusted according to the distance
the water has to be pumped: El Paso would pay $1,400 per acre-foot, Dallas
would pay $800, San Antonio – more than $1000. Although building a pipeline
will be expensive, an estimated $1-$2 billion, these prices are still very
high.

The Panhandle Conservation District sanctions extraction up to one AFY per acre
of land. Pickens and his partners currently own water rights for 150 acres and
are seeking rights for 50 more. This could translate into pumping as much as 65
billion gallons of water a year. The conservation district attempted to reduce
the planned extraction amount by half but was not able to because Pickens’
pumping level was equal to that of the Canadian River Authority, a public water
supplier that has already been granted an approval to pump. Pickens argued that
by law, both had to be treated equally. If Pickens lines up a buyer, financing
would come and unprecedented amounts of groundwater would begin to be sold for
colossal profits.

A more comprehensive groundwater regulatory regime is needed to prevent
devastation of Texas groundwater resources. Further, Texas should abandon the
Rule of Capture doctrine. Today, Texas is the only state to retain this
antiquated rule

Possible Stock Idea:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/24410

Pickens’ new company, Mesa Water, has been buying up ground water rights in
Roberts County, Texas - 200,000 acres in all. He says that over a 30-year
period, he expects to make more than $1 billion on his investment of $75
million. (Which means he'll be able to buy himself a very nice present for his
108th birthday!)

Pickens wants to take the water from the Ogallala Aquifer and pump about
200,000 acre feet of groundwater annually to El Paso, Lubbock, San Antonio, or
Dallas-Fort Worth - for a price, of course.

----------------------------

As an individual investor, you can’t trade water rights very easily. But you
can invest in a company that owns almost as much water as Pickens does - and
actually, the acre feet that this company owns are more valuable than what
Pickens bought. MUCH more valuable...

I’m talking about PICO Holdings (PICO).

-with a K. Yes, thanks for the reminder. I've forgotten how surprised I too was
when I saw those good results for the O'Neil screen. Somewhat disappointed and
discouraged as well.

My whole investment search is to seek out what works and could work for the
average person. I presume that a basis for that is the advice/technique/style
that good investors in the past have used over many decades and who have been
kind enough to have shared their processes with us. (Buffett/Graham/Dreman
etc.)

The O'Neil story is not clear to me. I ask myself, how does this guy make his
money? Like the inhabitants of Graham and Doddsville, i.e. through managing
public mutual funds? By being known as a long-time successful manager of
people's money - ala Schloss, Dreman, Steinhardt, or maybe one of the new
generation Burry, Tilson, Pabrish, Grommit (-g-)? Perhaps I'm only looking in
my own narrow circle of knowledge, but it just seems to me the O'Neil money is
coming from newspaper sales. Not from investing prowess.
=========================================

I'm a recent sign up for AAII on a trial subscription. From their website, I
now see the year-to-date (as of 12/29/06) results of their screens of various
investing strategies.

Among their conclusions: "This year, the leading strategy in terms of one-year
performance is the value-oriented “Enterprising Investor” methodology of
Benjamin Graham with a year-to-date return of 56.1%, the largest single-year
gain of any approach since 2004." (Nine stocks were in that screen,e.g. BL,
PKX, BLG, FDP, giving high volatility)

O'Neil's "CAN SLIM revised 3rd Edition", at -3.7%, was among the four poorest
performers of the 58 different screens.
The Graham Defensive Investor screen gained 27%. The "O'Neil's CAN SLIM" gained
29.5%, and the "IBD Stable 70" gained 7%. Imo, there was a heck of a scary
difference between the two CAN SLIM approaches in '06. With one you're a
winner; yet if you were in the other, you'd be losing in '06.

Rather than concentrate on one year performance,here are the screen results for
top performers over AAII total history of these screens (since about 1998).
AAII reports:

O'Shaughnessy--Tiny Titans (Growth & Value): 27.8%
Zweig (Growth & Value): 17.8%
Est Rev Up 5% (Specialty): 39.7%
O'Neil's CAN SLIM (Growth): 22.1%
Neff (Value): 16.1%

AAII's conclusion:

"When looking at those strategies that have achieved long-term success, several
common factors are apparent:
* Low multiples (price-earnings, price-to-book value, etc.), more on a relative
rather than an absolute basis;
* An emphasis on consistency of growth in earnings, sales, or dividends;
* Strong financials;
* Price momentum;
* Upward earnings revisions."

----
Just seems like such a dangerous and scary way to invest. (CAN SLIM) Maybe for
some speculative money, but for a large portion of one's core portfolio...
doesn't seem sensible to me. And not necessary to achieve good long-term
performance (imo). Searching the CAN SLIM threads/descriptors on SI, I'd say
the O'Neil methodolgy doesn't seem to have hooked and kept many SI people.

well that's the thing, in reading the various info in these posts and articles
about pickens and his plans, it sounds like he will have to spend 1 to 2B to
build a pipeline (though that sounds awfully high just to build a pipeline),
and then he could maybe make 1B by the time he is long dead, but that would
depend on that water source holding up all that time, and not being compromised
by other measures, or having his rights restricted for the good of others who
are simply looking to have water to drink, not to hoard the water and profit
from it

pickens is an oil man who already went bankrupt once because he mistakenly
thought energy prices could only go in one direction...it seems to me that
there is the possibility he is making the same mistake all over again 20 years
later, but he is widely quoted as an expert and his words move the markets, at

My new buys of international stocks are MTU and AUO. Both have been mentioned

MTU is the largest Japanese Bank and financial conglomerate. A recent earning

cap/Total asset ratio is still low compared to most international rivals but
this is of course because the assets are not as profitable. i am betting that
they become more so over time, so i think that the current price at a little
more than 12$ for the ADR represents are decent value.

AUO is the 2nd largest LCD producer (they did overtake the troubled LPL) behind
Samsung/Sony. The industry is very volatile and LCD prices are currently in the
basement due to too much new capacity. Now Capex is being restrained and I am
betting that AUO will show better results in 6 month or shortly thereafter. PE

VLO valuation

TSO purchase price for Shells' LA refinery: 1.63B$ for 100,000B/Day translates
into 16,000$/barrel. Also TSO pays for the inventory separately.

VLO has an EV value of 36B$ and owns 3.3 million B/Day refining capacity. I
subtract 4B$ in inventory (as this is accounted separately in most refinery
purchases). So VLO I calculate VLO $/barrel capacity at:

(36B$-4B$)/3,3M=9700$/barrel.

CA refineries mostly have above average profitability so I assume they trade at
a premium. On the other hand 100,000B/Day is a small refinery in a business
where big is better. I have not seen a recent refinery transaction in NA below
13,000$/barrel capacity. Based on these back of the envelope calculations VLO
is trading at least 30% below private market value.

Have you looked at any foreign country ETF's or are you able to find more

I have been reading that some foreign companies have more conservative
accounting rules (ie Finland) for valuating assets and creating extra reserves
for long term liabilities. This can provide a better value proposition when the
market discovers this. I am not sure if Japan has adopted these standards after
their big run up in real estate prices during the 90's. I am still studying the

I currently hold GLW which I acquired a few years ago when they were having

CanRoy Tax Related - Canadian Firm Penn West Seeks Oil Sands Jackpot, Growth

DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
January 30, 2007 2:42 p.m.

By Norval Scott
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

CALGARY (Dow Jones)--In the wake of recent changes in the Canadian tax code
unfavorable for energy trusts, the firms are beginning to map out strategies to
cope.

While other trusts are worrying how they'll survive when they have to start
paying corporate taxes for the first time in 2011, Penn West Energy Trust
(PWT.UN.T) plans to transform itself from a conventional oil and gas-producing
trust into a major oil sands player.

With crude oil and natural gas output of about 130,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day, Penn West is the largest of Canada's conventional energy
trusts. The company plans to grow over the next decade through its holdings in
Peace River, a largely undeveloped region in eastern Alberta.

The company plans to increase production at its existing oil sands operations
by 20,000 barrels a day by 2011. But the untapped Seal assets at Peace River
could deliver the company's biggest bonanza, to produce between 100,000 and
300,000 barrels of crude a day, said Penn West Chief Executive Bill Andrew.

"The potential of these assets is enormous," Andrew said. "They will evolve our
company and give us the ability to compete with senior independents in Canada
and the U.S."

Global interest in Alberta's oil sands is booming. Despite the difficulty and
expense of extracting crude oil from the region's sandy terrain, higher crude
prices have made production more economically feasible. Projects worth about
C$125 billion ($106 billion) are planned over the next decade, with output seen
tripling to 3 million barrels of crude a day by 2015.

Penn West's investment in the oil sands is unusual. Because energy trusts
haven't had to pay corporate income taxes, they typically have distributed most
of their income to unit holders, which has increased their profitability but
limited their cash flow. Consequently, trusts haven't had the capital to
develop large-scale projects like oil sands ventures, investing instead in
cheaper, maturing conventional oil and gas fields.

Planning Ahead

Last October, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty proposed that trusts pay
income tax from 2011, a move still being discussed by the country's government.
The proposal itself wiped 20% off of many trusts' share prices, and has created
widespread uncertainty amongst such firms over how they should adapt to the new
regulations, which are widely expected to become law.

The potential of Penn West's Seal oil sands sets the trust apart from the
others. Recently improved economics for heavy oil sands crude will allow the
company to ramp up exploration and production at Seal from its current 3,500
barrels of crude a day. The outlook for oil sands crude improved early last
year due to pipeline flow reversals in the U.S. that opened up a far larger
market for Canadian producers and boosted prices.

The firm - which converted into an energy trust in May 2005 after shareholder
pressure - intends to invest between C$100 million ($85 million) and C$150
million ($127 million) a year at Seal in "primary" oil sands output. Natural
underground pressure there that brings oil to the surface is expected to help
expand production to 20,000 barrels a day by 2011.

A plan for "secondary" or "tertiary" production methods is also in the works,
employing such devices as water flooding or steam injection to increase the
amount of crude produced by the reservoirs, bringing total production to
100,000-300,000 barrels a day.

"The big win is if you can institute enhanced recovery in the reservoir,"
Andrew said. "Our initial development will let us learn about the resource so
we can implement that."

The scale of Penn West's oil sands plans - and the capital expenditures they
will require - will likely necessitate the company converting into a
conventional exploration and production company in four or five years, despite
how the government ultimately rules on the trust tax issue.

"There will come a point where we'll need to invest more money, and so we'd
need to explore a different structure in which we could dedicate our cash flow
to this project," Andrew said. "We don't have enough legs under the oil sands
play for that yet, but eventually this project would be better handled by a
conventional corporation."

Crude Hotspot

Peace River has become an attractive locale for producers, sparking a wave of
recent investment. Penn West's Peace River holdings are adjacent to lands
formerly held by BlackRock Ventures Inc. (BVI.T), an oil sands firm taken over
by Shell Canada (SHC.T) in May in a C$2.4 billion ($2.03 billion) deal. Shell
Canada, which holds approximately two-thirds as much acreage as Penn West in
the region, has set a long-term crude production target of 150,000 barrels a
day from its assets.

Baytex Energy Trust (BTE.UN.T), Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR), EnCana Corp. (ECA) and
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) also have investments in or near the
region.

Penn West's lands are estimated to hold reserves of approximately 6 billion to
7 billion barrels of crude. The firm expects it will cost approximately C$10
($8.45) to produce a barrel of heavy sour crude in the primary production
stage, while secondary and tertiary output will cost approximately C$14-C$15
($11.85-$12.70) a barrel. Processing the crude through an upgrader, which
allows the heavy crude to be used by more refineries, is expected to cost about
C$4-C$5 ($3.40-$4.25) a barrel.

Andrew didn't rule out the possibility of seeking a partnership arrangement to
develop Penn West's oil sands assets - perhaps along the lines of the deal
EnCana reached with ConocoPhillips (COP), whereby EnCana traded a stake in its
oil sands project for an interest in a refinery. However, such a deal "isn't
something we're actively pursuing," he said.

regarding VLO - i agree my analysis was somewhat superficial. However, the
goodwill is irrelevant with respect to VLO real value. My approach is simply to
value VLO assets piece by piece, subtract the liabilities and compare it to the
current market cap.

So here we are
3.3M B/d refining capacity @13K/B: 43B$
Current assets 9.7B$
Other assets (LP etc.) 1.8B$
Total liabilities: 19B$

=Net asset value 35.5B$ /620M shares=57$/share

We need to add 2$/.share for the last quarters earning to this, and we also
need to note that we have not placed any value to VLO retail and distribution
business at this point (those are hiding under property ,plant and equipment).
Some of these liabilities included above are interest free (deferred taxes and
other) and are worth much less than face value.

Well, D day is here for SPOR.

Tender your shares for anywhere between $4.80 & 5.30 or hold for better things.

With about 5 holders owning 5% or more, I have to think that 1 or 2 of them
will tender some shares.

But, we may have picked up other investors such that the share price stays up
regardless.

And the company clearly suggests the WILL NOT go private without giving
remaining holders another opportunity to cash out.

"However, we do not intend to discontinue those reporting obligations or to
de-list our common stock from Nasdaq without providing all of our remaining
shareholders other than affiliates with a mechanism to sell or exchange their
shares in one or more going private transactions. As stated above, the Board of
Directors has not definitively determined to pursue a “going private”
transaction at any time in the future."

The book value will be about the same before and after the tender.

Insiders dont own much without options and many of those options are below the
current price which suggests their motivation is not to tank the shareprice.

That said, I believe the officers have all gotten raises recently and except
for the whole walmart/reserve apparel fiasco, the company might have posted
much better bottom line results recently.

Finally, I look back 18 months to when BAMM announced a dutch tender offer and
the shares have about doubled.

I did sell about 17% recently in the $5.20 range.

This is not a slam dunk decision for me by any means but Im not going to tender
any shares and will hope for higher prices/better results and/or a buyout in
the next 6-18 months.

Im banking on the insiders being motivated by their own self interests here and
that means they wouldnt do something that would sabotage the value of their
stock & options. (Mostly options as a number of managers own zero stock
outright)

That being said, it could be they were pressured by the large holders so that
such holders could get out of some of their shares.

If the DTA is over-tendered, that will likely be the case and it might mean the
stock will go down before going higher.

If few shares are tendered, that would be a positive going forward and thats
what Im hoping for.

I wish I had a crystal ball.

Yes, I follow MKL.

I wrongly sold most MKL shares when I received MKL stock for their takeover of
Terra Nova in '00. I added back a little more MKL in Jan. '02 (very positive
Barron's review at that time) and sold some shares later in the year.

Sometimes it just takes a lot of time - like years - to really understand just
how valuable some companies are. MKL is one for me.

And I still don't have it right: Coulda/shouda/but dint add to position at any
dips nor at anytime since '02.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=MKL&t=my&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

-----
This company is a book value creator. That's also how many/most analysts
evaluate this stock (on MKL's ability to add book value).

Book value (per Yahoo) is now about $230/sh. I am guessing a good entry point
for me to add to the few shares I have is about 1.8x book (=$414). If the stock
will get back down to that multiple, I will add.

OTOH, now might be a time to buy for a speculation. I am guessing MKL will
trade this year somewhere between 2 and 2.5 stated book. ($460-$575; stock
trades now at $484/sh.) Maybe trade higher than that depending on the general
market and how much MKL quarterly book value increases. (I assume upcoming
quarters will show increases.)

For now, for me, I'm just holding.

This company has very strong financials. The debt on the books is actually
capitalized leases, so the balance sheet is really clean.

The problem is that it's difficult to value what this "contract manufacturer"
should sell at. The company tries to spin them as a CM+ with engineering and an
emphasis on high margin products. They are doubling their capacity in Asia and
trying to figure out a way to make their Mexico operations profitable. That is
the only unprofitable division in the company.

There has been no open market purchases by insiders even though the stock has
fallen from roughly 44 to 16. That bothers me. Also, this company distinctly
tied to the fortunes of the economy and I generally don't buy stocks tied to
durable goods. But I bought some this morning on the notion that the stock is
oversold and should be due for a bounce.

Paul,

I sold half my position in IMOS due to comments from Fred Hickey in the recent
Barrons weekend edition.

Hickey: There are two types of electronic memory: DRAM [dynamic random access
memory] and flash. Flash prices were down in the high double digits in 2006,
but we're seeing a build-up in DRAM inventories, as we typically do prior to
the launch of a Microsoft [MSFT] operating system, in this case Vista, which
was released to businesses in November. The consumer version comes out in
January.

How big is the build-up?

Hickey: Micron Technology's [MU] inventories have risen 63% in the past year.
Speculators are hoarding inventory, waiting for a big surge in DRAM buying. It
happened when Microsoft introduced Windows 95. There was a huge drop in memory
prices after that.

IMOS has benefitted from the increase in DRAM requirements to run Vista. So I'm
taking half of my position which was purchased at 5.40 off the table at 7.25.

EDV.to does look like a value stock (to me), and I'll consider buying a few
shares.

MKL may or may not be a value stock. I like this old BusinessWeek article of an
interview with Bruce Berkowitz, manager of the Fairholme Fund: "You Only Need a
Few Ideas to Be Fabulously Wealthy" in which he mentions Markel as one of his
choices:

http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/edin/ein0023a.html?chan=search

I like Markel for its historical performance and the gains it is able to get
from its investment portfolio (its stock holdings).

I don't see MOGIF as a value proposition. It has great prospects apparently,
but no earnings history. Maybe the company/stock is or will be one of the "Few
Ideas to Be Fabulously Wealthy". I've been in several great prospect stocks
that zeroed out, so I'm not so quick these days to buy any shares of
great-prospect-companies-that-are-poised , let alone make any big $$ commitment
to such stocks.

All jmo opinion and my way of looking at these.

Nice link there, anializer. At first glance at TEI, I'm interested. Looking at

$32M in Gov't of Venezuela bonds. I'd worry that owning this fund I could wake

My general rule is any country I'm not willing to send myself to to live,

Perhaps the opportunity outweighs any risk. I do not know. I'll pass on TEI,

Gambling stocks: My guess is that AZECF stock price will move pari passu with
WYNN, since AZECF holds so many WYNN shares. And Wynn stock will move now with
the investor interest in Macau (imo). That area continues to get a lot of
attention by casino developers --- maybe even too much. (I believe though gov't
has limited the number of licenses.) Branson seems to be the latest who plans
to develop a complex:

http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2007_1st/Jan07_MacauBranson.html

On the one hand, maybe the scope/variety of competing casinos and their themes,
stores, restaurants, entertainment will serve to create even more interest in
Macau as a destination. OTOH, I also read where Macau caters to Chinese
gamblers, and these gamblers go there primarily if not solely to gamble and not
to have a 'resort experience'.

I'm not now adding more to AZECF, but I may. I am considering adding to MPEL.
This one is a Macau development company as well, and I've no idea when it'll
start generating revenues and profits. Here with MPEL we have a stock with no
clear earnings visibility that's touted by Cramer and highly recommended by
Motley Fool fool readers. So if the stock should drop (encouraged by a Cramer
mind change for example; or perhaps an analyst downgrade in MGM or Wynn or
Macau in general), people (including me) will have a tendency to say, "just why
am I holding this loser MPEL? Nobody knows if it will be profitable and
everybody is getting out".
My bet with MPEL though is that 18 months from now, as the company gets closer
and closer to completing its casino and getting its share of gambling revenue
(and profits, I hope), the stock will be higher than currently. A speculation
here by me, not a value proposition.

I've spread my bets in this area. I'm still holding suppliers WMS and IGT, and
I have shares in MGM and LVS. (And fwiw, still holding gambling stocks BYD,
CRYP, OPMR)

Aside: I couldn't resist: I just like the way "pari passu" rolls off the
tongue. Been waitin' a while to use that expression. -g-

As I said before what distinguishes Aruze and what makes it a value propositon
is that you get Aruze's operating business for free as well as the implicit
call on Japan permitting casinos in a couple of years and the liklihood of
aruze/wynn obtaining a casino license there. If I didnt own so much of it
already I would be still be adding here.

Madharry, yes it's distinguished by the 'free' Aruze business, and in that way,
it's a value proposition. To me though a scary, iffy value proposition. Because
so very much of the value of Aruze is in holding WYNN stock. (It was 60% they
own? I don't recall.) And WYNN itself is no value play. Not with forward p/e
47x, p/bk 4.8x, p/sales 9.66 times.

I guess I equate value stocks as stocks having a margin of safety, and I do not
get that with ARUZE. Just as ARUZE is following WYNN up as WYNN is rising, If
WYNN corrects because the popularity of casino stocks and/or Macau falters,
WYNN dominates and ARUZE stock is going to go down substantially no matter what
the value of its (ARUZE's) stand alone business. (Well, that's my opinion.)
