LIA,

If the deal goes through, I like the LIA. Based off of my "proprietary model",
I am estimating over $12 worth of LIA stuff for $10.50 worth of LIA. I always
go for the discount.

Based off of recent stock prices and exchange rates, you get
$0.50 USD in cash
1.5 Grupo Prisa = 1.5 x 1.77 x 1.3979 = $3.71 USD
3.0 Grupo Prisa Mandatory Convertible = ???

A conservative (and poor IMO) valuation of the convertible is the value of the
stock. That gives 3 x 1.77 x 1.3979 = $7.42 USD for a total value of $11.63.
Even for that much, I think LIA is worth the investment.

I think the convertible is worth more. It has a 0.175 EUR dividend (assuming
company makes enough money to cover it) and converts into the greater of 1
Prisa share or $2 Euros worth of Prisa shares in 3.5 years (up to 1.33 Prisa
shares max). Therefore, using my sophisticiated option and NPV modeling ;) I
put a value of at least $2 EUR on it. That gives 3 x 2 x 1.3979 = $8.39 for a
total value of $12.60.

I'd love to hear comments/criticisms on my valuation and point out that these
values will change daily with the Prisa stock price and the Euro exchange rate.
Anyone reading this and thinking about buying, I'd recommend you go through the
Grupo Prisa shareholder presentation filed by LIA on 9/7/2010 and do your own
valuation study.

Madhary,

I am not saying that the fund performance is good. What I am trying to do for
myself is to find a mechanism to value the market. The way we are looking for
value in stocks, the same way I want to learn to value the market and get out
when I conclude it is overvalued and get in when it is fairly or undervalued.
Warren buffet does it to some extent. And I think Hussman uses good arguments
to prove that things are overvalued what he does not take into consideration is
the inflation that we are facing. And there will be inflation.
I came upon to a lecture by Benjamin Graham on market valuation which I cannot
find at the moment, but I will share it with you later.

I followed you in Silver Wheaton. What is your valuation of it at the current
price of silver. Do you understand what is considered assets on their balance

re OI - interesting enough, Barron's has a piece about OI (Bottom's up".
Barrons article mentions their valuation, emerging market exposure but does not
mention the asbestos liability. This is not a small omission; last year, OI
paid ~180M$, before it was ~250M$ and in 2006/2007 ~ 120M$. you would think
that considering they got out of the asbestos business in 1958, the claims
would run off but so for it seems that they are on track for another 180M$ in
2010. Well, these are pre-tax expenses of course but I think the NPV of the
asbestos claims post tax is at least 1B$. Considering that the EV value of OI
is ~7.4B$ (which does not account for the asbestos liability), that is not
exactly a rounding error. if I assume an adjusted EV of 8.4B$, most of the
valuation discount to peers is gone.

I think Hussman is grasping at straws to some extent to try to explain away his
poor performance. A much more compelling argument is that in todays market you
can put together a portfolio of large cap stocks with significant exposure such
that the dividend yield and most certainly the free cash flow yield is higher
than the 10 year bond. That would argue in favor of selling bonds and buying
these stocks at the very least.

My two bit analysis of the market and the economy is that corporations are
doing well. 20% of the US population is not. on the other hand that some
segment of that population is on medicaid, food stamps, and probably living
housing free from not paying their mortgages and not paying their credit cards
either.
Its hard to tell when that party will end but I dont like financials here. OTOH
I continue to like GOOG IBM YHOO.

As for slw the performance has exceeded expectations, way back when I think the
stock was around $11, I did some analysis and projected that at the silver
price of $20 the price of SLW would be worth more. I thought I posted a link to
a recent presentation of the CEO. I have not analazyed the balance sheet as
this company is about the future projected cash flow from silver that will be
purchased at $4 an ounce from some of the worlds largest mining companies. I am
looking at this as a large cap leveraged alternative to owning silver and thats
about it right now. Off the top of my head I would say its not the bargain that
it once was and its probably close to fair value now. But I believe that the
gold/silver uptrend remains intact so I am holding.

LIA follow up,

Assuming the deal gets approved, I think you will earn some gains after it gets
approved as the uncertainty premium is taken out. Then I think you earn a
little more risk premium when the shares finally convert. (I think folks
underestimate the value of the converts.)

Finally, I think Prisa stock could appreciate as the deal arbs get worked out
and real buyers come in. So I have positive expectations for holding the shares
over the three different stages of the investment. However, the risks ramp up
at each stage and particularly at the last stage.

I have a large position now, but would be chopping it down as the deal
progresses.

It is kind of like TTT, which I thought was a great event-driven opportunity,
but where I have started to take money off of the table as the risk/reward gets
less attractive.

I don't see what QE2 has to do with owning an MLP. if QE2 is needed it means
that stated inflation rats are low. Since the fee part of an MLP is indexed to
inflation (via a formula from FERC), it means that distribution won't grow to
much.

The low interest rates do benefit MLP's in too ways - it lowers their cost of
debt and also means less competition from bonds. of course it works the other
way around too - high interest rates (typically correlated with inflation)
provide both a back and a headwind at the same time.

The worst thing for MLP's is a credit crunch - just look at their performance
in 2008 or 2002.

I disagree with you about the "market looks fairly valued and perhaps
overvalued". There are tons of high-brand-value megacaps that are still trading
close to the lowest valuations in terms of P/S and P/E in a decade (of course,
some of them traded at even lower valuations on 3/2009, but we are not talking
about panic bottoms). Unless economy collapses again, companies like JNJ, MSFT,
PG, IBM, etc. are not overvalued and they comprise a large part of the
market-cap weighed indices. They are not fantastically cheap, but they are
somewhat cheap and closest-to-the-cheap-in-ages.

I find what you wrote particularly vexing- the gall of those cnbc grandiose
types- the double standard that its somehow ok for ceo-s to screw employees,
shareholders, and customers, skirting legal issues and then argue with somebody
doing something perfectly legal on moral grounds? I was drawn into a legal
situation by an acquaintance who worked for a privately own company for
decades. like all employees she participates in some erissa plan where she was
given stock in the company annually as her pension. now she was terminated
along with several other employees and according to the plan, when she is
terminated her shares in the plan are purchased at appraised value in the
calendar year end following the termination. sounds good except that the
appraised value dropped by more than 50% from the prior year end and they
refused to furnish a copy of the appraisal because they had no obligation to
under the plan. She is also not given an option of keeping the shares with the
company and selling them off over a period of years hoping that the appraised
value will increase. sounds like a scam to me.

I remember warning you guys on this three years ago that people would make
business decisions and walk away when their mortgages were underwater and i got
some moral argument then too.

The reality is that banks didnt care when they orginated the loans because they
planned to foist them upon stupid investors backed by aaa rated scores offered
by agencies who had no skin in the game. If it was your or my money going to
fund some real estate purchase in a state where the there is no legal
obligation beyond the mortgage collateral to repay would you ever have lent

As far as walking away, I agree with you. In my opinion, every underwater

OT.

Obviously "strategic default" is everyone's personal decision.

However, don't minimize the issue of morality. Teaching general population to
renege on contracts, lie and steal is pretty easy. And then you end up with
countries like Russia, Greece or half of "developing" world where crime and
corruption is rampant because there are few consequences and it's the way to
"get ahead". And turning around to get people to be moral again takes much
longer and it's much harder. One of the reasons USA attracted me was that it
was much more moral - and safe - society than Eastern Europe where I came from.
Do we want to move in the wrong direction?

I do agree that corporations, businesses and rich should have the same
consequences of reneging on their contracts, lying and stealing. However, the
fact that they can get away with it should lead us to find ways to prevent it
and not to encourage others to follow the lead of the crooked. :/

BTW i heard some lawyer from secutity mortgage industry group on cnbc saying
that what they were doing perfectly fine and the it was permitted under the ucc
code. however from what i learned in banking that is not entirely true. If i
understand what they were doing they were filing the mortgage as mersa, and
then assigning the note to whomever, which they can certainly do, however, the
new mortgage holder never filed the mortgage under their own name. Now that is
a very questionable practice in my view, and i dont think this lawyer is on
firm ground at all because real estate transactions are not covered by the
uniform commercial code. that is why a mortage has to be filed by the owner of
the paper to be valid. now it sounds to me that if i own a property and mersa
has filed on it but doesnt hold the mortgage they would be required to release
that mortgage within a reasonble amount of time, and failure to do so might
make them vulnerable to legal action. furthermore if i own a property like
this. i can see all sorts of problems down the road getting clear title as i
can prove i paid the bank off i dont know that i can prove i paid mersa off if

There is a clear difference between a moral issue and a business transaction.
When I was in banking we made commercial loans where the individual borrowers
were specifically exculpated from responsibility for the loan. meaning if we
couldnt collect from the sale of the property we were out of luck. In my view
one could easily make the case that it is immoral to try to collect from an
individual in a state where the law is clear that once you have a mortgage on
the property that is all you are entitled to collect on. Once again I would
find it incredible that lenders in that specific state would be unaware of the
law. To me its close to trying to collect from you on a loan that was made to a

Jurgis, for me defaulting on a loan (be it strategic or not) is not renegading
or breaking a contract. As i understand it, defaulting on a secured asset is
simply an option that is freely given the borrower by the lender, at the time
the loan was granted.
So essentially, the lender has handed out the borrower a put option. Obviously
lenders underestimated the probability that the borrower would exercise that
option.

This is really no different than the case where your bring your wedding ring to
the pawnbroker to get a (secured) loan. The pawnbroker is responsible to make
sure he has enough collateral at hand , if not he is going to be out of his
money. There is no breach of contract if you can't or don't want to cough up
the money to get your wedding ring back (assuming no fraud), because for
example the gold price took a dive since the loan was granted. In my point of
view, you would have no obligation to make the pawnbroker whole, just as the
pawnbroker does not have an obligation to make you whole if you can't pay off
you loan and the pawnbroker were able to sell of you ring for more than the
value of the loan plus interest. A foreclosure works just the same way, except
that the lenders were exceptionally bad pawnbrokers for the last couple of
years.

I decided to buy back the FMBL position I sold during account move as an

GFRE and CSGH crept up into top 10 as their prices increased. Still cheap.

is well managed, but not fantastically cheap. The main issue for insurance
companies now is low bond yields for their float. FRFHF and L are somewhat

of insurance business remain - writing policies at any cost can ruin any

Is the new CEO cleaning house, throwing out the baby with the bath water and
setting up the company to go private?

If you eliminate the one time charges they earned $0.28/share ($58 million).
Sales fell 8% and net profit was off 20% year over year. Part of that was due
to the labor strike last quarter at their high end (high margin) Shaws stores
(now resolved).

I think the new CEO is setting the next quarterly target(s) at the low end. I
will be looking for a final wash out, perhaps a new low in the $9.00 range and
will load up the truck again.

I have about a 60% position with my average cost around $12.00/share.

Hi Sportsman -

Do you still own MarkWest Energy Partners, LP Co (NYSE: MWE). I may be late to
the party on this one. I like that they were able to refinance their long term
debt due 2014 w/ this new issue. They get a lower rate and were able to float
twice as much debt due in 2020 (extended the term 6 years). This should net
them over $250 million to use for acquisitions and/or build out new facilities
and storage systems.

The company is operating in a lot of the NG growth areas but is not as
profitable as their competitors. I expect this to change as their new
operations come online. Their forward PE is still quite high which must not
reflect the future revenue streams from these new projects.

re Mortgage note. Maybe your mortgage note is different then mine. Mine has
specific provisions what the Lender can do if the property is abandoned. he can
for example take certain actions to protect the value of the property.
The note specifically states that any amounts disbursed (to protect the value
of the property) shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this
Security instrument . That appears to be a non non- recourse clause as it
specifically states that the borrower has no right to get made whole beyond
taking title to the property.

Not sure that a discussion about morality leads anywhere here. People do, what
they do and apparently nobody get's sued. A home is not a castle but in good
times it is an ATM via the home equity line and cash out refinances and in bad
time a rental from FRE/FNM.

Hi Jurgis -

Followed you in on MHRpC which pays 10.25% monthly (exdividend 10/25/2010).

I am going to follow your strategy and peel off shares from my other preferred
BDNpC (@7.5%) and perhaps will take some of the FRpK off the table too.

I am also reducing my exposure on many of my other recent gainers by about 10%
(DD, MPW, SI) and parking the funds in MHRpC.

I picked up more shares of GMXR and am looking to start a position in SSN. I
plan to speculate in more of the E&O companies as opportunities arise. I have
my eye on some very small micro caps which could do well with an accommodating
Fed policy (ie QE2).

I am looking to add some more of the various MLPs on any correction as I expect
this sector to continue to grow even if there is a slow down in the US. Many of
the MLPs I watch are near their all time highs and I can sit and wait.

MHRpC has an attractive yield but one must be careful of any specific stock
risk so I am limiting my exposure to 2% of my portfolio.

Any current thoughts on PBEGF these days? Looks like the sum of parts valuation
is pretty attractive. In addition, it hasn't rallied much since September given
the rise in oil prices.

Still a good value play to you? What is the downside to you based on the shares
they own in the other two companies, their own oil, and potential new drilling

I don't own any shares, but I am looking to add here on a good entry point

four parts to Petrobank:

1. 110,000,000 shares (58%) of Petrobakken. Current share price of PBN is $23
which is a market value of $2.5bil.
2. 66,000,000 shares (65%) of Petrominerales. Current market cap of PMG is
$1.65bil.
3. A heavy oil business unit that sits within the parent company that has 670
million BOE.
4. Ownership of a potentially game changing oil sands extraction technology
that could be worth billions...."

<snip>

"...I think the opportunity to buy the first 3 parts at 50% of their value is a
pretty great opportunity. But the fact that you also get the THAI technology
thrown on top of this makes Petrobank the best risk/reward scenario I have ever

Cwillyg,

Differently from most people on this thread, I buy E&Ps based on earnings and
not reserves. So, possibly, my valuation would be very different from what
others think.

PBEGF is a bit hard to value anyway because of the complex structure. However,
in short it's not a buy for me here. In fact, I would sell it if I did not like
its macro picture. It's not cheap IMHO. But then most of E&Ps are not cheap
IMHO, e.g. GTE, GPOR, GEOI are all close to my sell prices discarding the macro
picture.

I think that APA, NXY, TLM are better values, but then all of them are not pure
E&Ps and APA/TLM have 50/50% oil/gas split. PBEGF is more oily which is good.
NXY maybe?

(Super majors E and TOT are still attractive, but this is getting far from
PBEGF.)

Hello Jurgis,

Thank you for your thoughts.

I guess that's the downside, that it's a complex structure which prevents easy
valuation. The company either needs to get its story out or find a way to
unlock value. But, still there is value there, if not from a direct earnings
perspective.

I guess from the macro side, I agree that I want to hold oil companies, but
from a short-term perspective I'm waiting for a pullback. I owned SGY, CHK,
TOT, E, ATPG, NE, and GEOI, but recently sold SGY and E. Just waiting for a
pullback to rebuild a couple of positions. Maybe I will add to TOT, but PBEGF
still interests me. Decisions, decisions...

The author claims undervaluation of PBEGF by saying that the market cap of two
public holdings is almost equal to PBEGF market cap. It is indeed undervalued
only if the public holdings are undervalued. The author gives a very short and
very unconvincing argument that the holdings are indeed cheap. I'd have to look
much deeper at Petrobakken and Petrominerales to be sure that's the case.

Of course, it's possible to buy PBEGF and short Petrobakken/Petrominerales, to
play on the fact that PBEGFs holdings assigned almost zero value by the market.
If one does this, then the overall position is indeed quite undervalued.
However, I'm not so sure it's the case if you don't short the public holdings.

Hi Jurgis- Petrobakken/Petrominerales

Mr. Market is pretty smart. It's possible their are potential hidden
liabilities (ie environmental) that are being discounted w/ the price
differentials.

I have noticed recently that there is a dis-joint between the price of crude
oil (and NG) and many of these oil companies w/ their proven reserves in the
ground. Specifically many of the NG stocks should be trading much lower w/
today's NG price at $3.38 (just 10 days ago it was close to $4.00). NG stocks
s/b down 20% but are trading even to higher.

I suspect there are some large hedge funds trading around these NG & Oil assets
w/ an equal dollar short play. The discussed QE2 could be the explanation. As
soon as the expectations of QE2 become reality, everything will be unwound and
the rise in commodities (and NG & Oil companies) will fall back to pre-QE2
price levels.

My large integrated oil companies continue to move higher as well as my
Canadian Oil Trusts. The move in the Canadian Oil Trusts is partially explained
by the recent announcement(s) for conversion to corporate structures (much of
the uncertainty on distributions now clarified). I am not too sure why the
large integrated oil companies continue their run higher (see my earlier post
of the McDep report dtd 10-21-2010).

I think there is a QE2 unwinding trade available but it may be a long time off
(years rather than months). Therefore, I like the idea of speculating in the
smaller E&O companies as in the short term they will benefit from the
artificial price levels of NG & Oil from heightened QE2 expectations. Long term
interest rates are much lower than normal historical levels which also make it
more profitable for these E&O companies to borrow more money to drill more
wells.

re SVU - if you adjust for the leverage, the valuation is about on par with KR.
SVU EBITDA/EV will be about 5x (KE ~5.5) and EV/sales ~0.26 for both. Due to
the high leverage SVU equity can make wide swings in either direction.

I think SVU starts to look cheap due to it's option value. They have currently
6.7B$ in debt and only 2.25B$ in market cap, so it's reasonable to talk about
an equity sliver here.

We have Albertson stores in our neighbourhood but rarely go there. Their
pricing is not attractive overall and the good promotions they have every once
in a while are not enough for us to give them mindshare.

Still I think the equity does look attractive here from a risk reward
perspective. I think I might give this one a shot.

license its search and ad tech to a subsidiary in Ireland—Google Ireland

Licensing tech from Google racks up expenses, which allow Google's dummy
company to duck Irish tax law. The money generated in Ireland is shuttled to
the Netherlands, which, because of EU law, further keeps government hands out
of Google's earnings. From here, revenue is paid to another subsidiary in
Bermuda, where it becomes virtually invisible—under Irish law, this tropical

bromine is used in fire retardant materials for clothing that is all good for
gfre. I can always be wrong but I dont see how they earn below $1.50 over the

as far as mfcaf- Im not sure there is downside to not tendering the shares. I
dont think the price is fair. from what i can tell mfcaf tangible book value is
at least $10, so at $7.60 we are being asked to take a 24% haircut. I feel a

I'm suggesting maybe it's time someone should consider starting a separate GFRE

Perhaps a separate thread is a more appropriate place converse about the

getting tired of reading about or skipping over repeated posts on a particular

Peeled off shares in DD and working on closing out position in HFBC (difficult
as it is thinly traded).

Looking at starting a position in COV. This is a compelling value buy for me at
anything below $40.00/share. Forward PE is 11 and company has under performed
the market. Very little debt and provides must need medical products.

I plan on building my position in ANMF as this micro cap company is very
profitable, keeps growing their sales, pays a 4% dividend (which may be
increased), and insiders own a lot of stock. The company has no debt and plenty
of capital to expand their business is needed. PE is under 10. Two new accounts
added last quarter w/ other still in the works per management. Holiday season
could spur many more sales in specialty food gift packages.

EKS

FWIW - Been parking money in MHRpC preferred stock that pays monthly 10 1/4%.
Ex-dividend is 14th of every month w/ dividend paid into account on the 1st of
every month. I bought some for the IRA and the taxable account.

I've owned CREE and VECO at one time. No interest now -- they're too expensive
for me.

I hold shares in AMAT which does some work in helping LED manufacturers build
their production lines. Apparently only a very small part of AMAT. Might be
debatable whether AMAT is a value stock or not.

I continue to bet on almost all the Australian stocks that I have found that
hold USA oil shale lands.

In addition to recent adds to Samson and Sundance (SSN and SDCJF/SEA.ax), I've
added a little now to a far smaller position in MPET.

Thanks, Paul.

I still haven't pulled the trigger on AMAT, but yes, I imagine they have
exposure to LEDs also, which I hadn't considered.

And I'm waiting for a correction to really pull the trigger on CREE or VECO, if
I decide to.

Thanks,

FWIW purchased KMB near the trough in March '09. Nice return, especially with
the div. Obviously, the stock is still closer to its 52W high than 52W low,
that is a negative IMHO. The still juicy and almost assuredly safe 4% yield
will provide support IMHO. Still a hold.
Also FWIW sold small position RCL today with the big move.
