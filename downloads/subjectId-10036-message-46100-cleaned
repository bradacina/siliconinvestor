COH

<I like to establish a consumer centric short based on my assumption that the
reduction in savings rates that has fueled consumption despite stagnating
income cannot continue. >

Zach's has a similar view:

<Coach sells products that are discretionary in nature. Its customers remain
sensitive to macroeconomic factors including interest rate hikes, increases in
fuel and energy costs, credit availability, unemployment levels and high
household debt levels, which may negatively impact their discretionary
spending, and in turn the company’s growth and profitability. Therefore, we
remain concerned about erratic consumer behavior and sluggish recovery in the
economy.>

Opposing argument (brief):

Its true that margins have declined, but they have been gaining market share.
Secondly, COH is initiating a new product line aimed at the male market.

OT: COH. I remain long a few shares. Net profit margins holding up well.
Relatively little d/e. As a premium clothing-related status symbol, company
could be an acquisition target for the likes of LVMH or other high-end company.
Not a concern if someone is long -- It's something though that always has to be
kept in mind if shorting a stock, since acquirers sometimes base buys on
presumed strategic value of a company, not just the targets's short-term
outlook.

As long as desire for product is there, I'll bet enough women will find a way
to acquire it. Maybe it's less of something else, or less expensive something
else (less expensive dresses/coats). With the splurge for the purse.

======
For a clothing short, I was going to suggest The Gap, GPS. That's down today
though. I view Gap opposite from COH in terms of quality of merchandise: COH
high quality, GAP poor quality. I shorted a few shares when they said they were
closing many USA stores and opening up more in China. I don't see how that
would necessarily give them improving profits. (For tax reason, I didn't want
to carry the position over into 2012, so I bought back shares too early. I may
reconsider re-shorting in about a month (to avoid USA tax wash-sale rule.))

Shorting COH could work as a trade to scalp a few points as market moves around
and reports circulate on how consumers will stop or have stopped consuming.
Longer-term though, I wonder.

I don't short. But if I did, I'd short horrible businesses in terminal decline.
Like EK. Or airlines anytime they persuade the public that they are doing well.
Or newspapers. Or booksellers like BKS. Or Chinese RTOs ;). Or NOK and RIMM :P
(I am long NOK ;)).

IMHO, it's not a good risk/reward to short a vastly profitable, high-ROE,
high-brand-name company just because it is overvalued. I understand that you
also believe that it faces headwinds, so it's a bit like Einhorn's GMCR short.
Still, COH (and GMCR) could just be bought out, taken private, etc. It also can
find new outlets for their stores/products. It can establish new product lines
on top of existing ones. So I'd say - no short. Obviously, if there is another
2009-confidence-crash-Chinese-meltdown, COH stock can fall a lot too. :)

because dividend amounts will vary as the price of gold changes. While the
dividend might fluctuate, I suspect most people aren't buying just for the
dividends. One reason I'm buying is that I am hoping and expecting that NEM
stock itself isn't correlated to other stocks in my portfolio and that it won't
be adding to the volatility I've been experiencing with this portfolio.

As I start the year, I begin with a large net cash position overall: I'm

Horrible businesses in terminal decline may already have their price slashed,
leaving little room for making a profit by shorting. A better barometer may be
the stock's beta, which is readily available in Yahoo Finance.

COH's beta is 1.7, meaning that it's return is likely to be almost twice the
magnitude of the avg. market return.
Higher-beta stocks tend to be more volatile and therefore riskier, but provide
the potential for higher returns or higher losses.

COH's high beta was displayed this past year, going from a high of 69.20 on
July 7th to a low of 45.70 a little more than a month later and then back up to
the 60s.

Due to its beta, COH qualifies as a short candidate for someone spotting a
wrinkle in the armor.

Clownbuck, I'm trying to learn to short right now, but it seems most shorts are
very selective about catalysts and technicals- waiting for stock to show
characteristics of "breaking down". I mention the technical perspective only
because all of your bullets are more fundamental in nature and it seems shorts
bring the supply/demand equation for a stock into play at some point when

Do not short the leader of an industry. People can be extremely optimistic and

Well said.

Buying depressed stocks are similar to shorting overvalued stocks.

Buying at a top and shorting at a bottom are trend following emotional risky
plays.

Buying value and shorting excess is a much more conservative play -which IMO
can only be done with excess cash with no or little leverage.

Then patience is the secret ingerdient to success.

In my case ,the main purpose of shorting is hedging against macro risk. My
ideal short has limited upside but is vulnerable to macro shifts. I think that
COH somewhat meets these criteria but I think that the upside may be larger
since essentially COH so far has shown strong execution and I would have to
wait for clearer signals to confirm a potential degradation. I do think that
COH expansion, in particular outlets and the fact that their customers is
mostly lower middle class women makes it more vulnerable to macro trends than
other luxury retailers.But that by itself is not strong enough to warrant a
short case at this point.

The ultrashorts have friction losses especially where there is high volatility,
so I don't use them. You are correct that an index would be a better short - I
like IWM (which contains a lot of overvalued stocks imo) best but often have
been unable to get a borrow on them.

I did not mentioned it, but COH chart looks topsy and vulnerable to break down
- it had a sharp drop in September to almost 45$. I read that this stock is
beloved by hedge funds which is just another reason to short it, because hedge
funds often sell when the momentum is going against them plus they suffer from
redemption's when times are rough, forcing indiscriminate sales.

Other forms of Value, holding more cash is just one of them . . .

In looking at the Value picture (for me), there are other types of value
holdings that I have been moving to other than just the fundamental forms found
in equities. For one, I too have been moving more to cash seeking safety and
"value" (even w/ it's negative return) at my local Credit Union (0.75 annual
return), holding preferred shares (MHRpC plans to call this paper w/i 90 days;
my No. 3 holding) and moving 15% of my portfolio assets into (hopefully
undervalued) income producing real estate late last year.

One of my Dad's investment thesis (in his later life) was investing to maintain
his current purchasing power. His goal was to own companies (or assets) that
maintain their "value" in inflationary and/or deflationary environments. The
problem with an all stock equity portfolio, values can drop substantially
(unless holding a large % of cash) in a very short amount of time. We saw this
in 2009 and we will see that again. In fact, the way the trader talk over at
the Big Dog's Boom Boom Room selling naked Puts that carry huge downside risk
is just a hint how investors are viewing the potential downside to this market.
There is a reason Mr. Market is pricing Puts w/ such huge premiums six months
out.

In a normal environment, one could try to hedge a portfolio to protect
significant downside risks. One would do this by owning Puts, holding more bond
like equities (utilities, preferred stock, financials), equities that have
little or no LT debt and/or hold assets that generates large amounts of current
cash flows (including income producing real estate). The most oblivious of
these are oil companies. Your Newmont Mining (NEM) pick also fits in this
category too.

Portfolio Management
--------------------------------

My current portfolio management has been to sell most (if not all) of my stock
lots that include my (1) high priced buys, (2) buys at or near above my cost
basis and (3) holding the proceeds in cash (or cash like funds). All my new
buys must follow very conservative guidelines: little to no LT debt exposure,
low PE (10 or less), have a (tangible is best) BV of 1.5 or lower and must pay
a dividend generated from high current cash flows. The Graham No. is an easy
way to do a quick screen that produces stock candidates that meet these "value"
constraints.

The developing Big "Value" Opportunity:
---------------------------------------------------------

As a conservative value investor, I am setting the table to take advantage of
another buying opportunity IF a 25% market correction/crash occurs. Therefore,
(for me) accumulating a large position in cash, trimming my marginally
profitable equity positions and staying out of new equity opportunities unless
they meet some very tight value criteria.

My goal is to maintain my current purchasing power which could be much lower if
we see a 25% market correction. At the same time, I need to generate enough
current income to support day to day living (paying bills & taxes; property,
State & Federal, and cover huge medical insurance premiums). Our 2012 health
insurance premiums are up another 10% making the total payments more than our
monthly mortgage payment. These monthly health insurance premiums now amount to
more than 10% of my after tax annual income... and our family is healthy w/o
any pre-existing conditions. My only disadvantage is I am self employed (an
investor) w/o any Gov and/or business health plan subside.

If the possible buying opportunity develops, I should be able to buy more new
assets at 50 cents of today's value so I can resell them in 3-5 years for 90
cents of today's value. Perhaps the best values could be picked up in the small
cap area but I bet that many of the larger caps will be on sale too that could
provide similar values but w/ less much risk.

So, holding more cash now could be one of the best current "value" plays for
many of the reasons I explained above. At least (for now) that is my current
thinking. <u>I am at 5x my current cash position from late last year (now
around 25%) and will continue to trim to as much as 50% cash where
opportunities exist.
</u>

Based on depressed BDI none of the shippers look cheap on a EV\EBITDA basis,
but they are selling at a small fraction of book (which may not mean much if
overcapacity if permanent such that the book value is permanently impaired).
I'm thinking that the older, less economical ships will get scrapped and the
growing economy will absorb the excess capacity.

Looks like your reluctance to make any significant investment in 2010 was smart

Shipper SBLK. Yes, I've been reviewing that one, and have an order to buy more
at .90.

My last buys were at $1.39 and $1.06. I show I have some bought 4/09 at $$2.58.
That '09 buy would be one of the few stocks bought at those market low months
that didn't subsequently work out okay.

It looks like they've got several of their ships on charter vs on day-rate this
year and going into next, and that the ceo is confident that their financing
through '12 is not an issue for them. Refer here to a nice section on their
website, "media interviews", where, 10/31, Mr Capralos, President, CEO is
interviewed:
http://shipping.capitallink.com/interviews/2011/cl_interview__starbulk_2011_oct

I have been trying to figure what the value of the ships would be sold for if
they were scrapped. I assume they'd sell for some $ value per pound. I can't
find what the weights of the ships are. (I found only "tonnage" - that's just
what the ships can carry)

Fwiw, I have varying amounts of these shipping stocks: NM NNA SFL ULTR GASS TOO
SBLK DSX . My largest position here is TOO: I like its business, its

Hi Paul -
Commercial Metals Company (CMC) - Stock up 6% on good earnings especially in
their recycling business
Industrial Services of America, Inc. (IDSA) 

Notice that their recycling business Americas Mills increased revenues YOY by
over 100% and earnings YOY by 250%!

From the article:"...Our Americas Mills, Americas Recycling and International
Mills segments led the first quarter's profitability with adjusted operating
profit increasing over last year's first quarter. Americas Mills had an
adjusted operating profit of $57.9 million , $23.8 million higher than last
year's first quarter. Our new Arizona mill within this segment also had another
quarter of profitability. Americas Recycling had adjusted operating profit of
$20.8 million , compared to $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2011..."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore, I am in for a starter position of IDSA based on your earlier post
12/15/2011. They should see a very good increase in their recycled metals
business if the Americas Mills/Americas Recycling activity is any indicator. I
am betting that it is. My position is a relatively small bet. The current

Don't know the results of Baird's 2011 ideas, but I'm sure they were better
than John Paulson's.

My best idea is to take what the market gives me. For example, I'm probably the
only one
on SI to have taken a position today in Pricesmart. Because I didn't care if I
got sold the
stock, I put a bid out there for what at the time was a low ball bid at 57.60.
The stock dipped
another buck under that, which put it's losses at -20% on the day, but then
came back and
closed at 60.63.

Pricesmart is called the Costco of Latin America. This is the second quarter in
a row it
missed earnings estimate. Just like Costco, it wasn't able to pass on rising
cost of
product to consumers. I'll flip the stock on a bounce and wait and sees what
the market
gives me next. Very different from your trading, I know.

If I get "stuck" with the stock, I also wouldn't mind as I believe it's a
growing company,
conservatively well managed, in an area of the world that actually has a
growing economy.

PriceSmart Brings Warehouse Stores To Latin America

By KEVIN HARLIN, IBD Sept 22, 2011

Colombia's middle-class consumers have pesos in their pockets, and a U.S.-based
retailing pioneer is giving them a place to spend them. PriceSmart (PSMT) is
the Caribbean and Central America's largest warehouse-style retailer, with 29
stores in 12 countries and one U.S. territory, the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Now the so-called Costco of Latin America is bringing patio furniture, luggage,
groceries and other items to Colombian shoppers. PriceSmart opened that 29th
store, its first in South America, in Barranquilla in August, and said it's
under contract to buy land in Cali for a second Colombian store.

The grand opening of PriceSmart’s latest warehouse-style store in Barranquilla,
Colombia. The stores are usually smaller than U.S. stores.

Analysts think PriceSmart could eventually transplant the warehouse model in
other South American markets, including the continent's economic powerhouse,
Brazil.

But in the near term, Colombia gives PriceSmart plenty of runway for growth.
"Colombia offers them the capacity to potentially double their store
footprint," Singular Research analyst Greg Garner told IBD. "It's a tough
market, and that's why it's so important for them to get it right."

Que Es PriceSmart?

Most U.S. consumers don't know the San Diego-based PriceSmart, which has no
stores in the States. But they're familiar with the warehouse-membership
concept and names such as Costco (COST) and Wal-Mart's Sam's Club.

Those retailers can thank Price-Smart's founder, the late Sol Price.

In 1954, the retailing innovator created the first membership-based retailing
chain, FedMart. He sold that business and opened Price Club in 1976. That
business merged with Costco in 1993. Shortly after, he created PriceSmart. His
son, Robert Price, is PriceSmart's chairman.

The company now has more than a million members at its stores and online sales
site.

Though the no-frills warehouse sites are similar to warehouse clubs in the
U.S., PriceSmart adjusts the model for the local markets. The stores are
usually smaller — 48,000 to 84,000 square feet vs. more than 140,000 sq ft for
the typical Costco. Annual dues are usually about $30 vs. $50 for Costco.

About half of each store's inventory is sourced locally or regionally, with
most of the rest shipped in from the U.S. In fact, Costco is one of
PriceSmart's largest suppliers. Its stores carry Costco's house brand, Kirkland
Signature. The stores also sell local foods, household goods and often gas,
tires and other items. The concept seems to work.

Sales, Earnings En Fuego

PriceSmart has posted double-digit sales and earnings growth in recent years.
In its fiscal third quarter, which ended May 31, sales climbed 24% to $431.1
million. Earnings per share rallied 38% to 55 cents.

For August, the company said sales climbed 21.5% from a year ago to $148.3
million. Same-store sales over the past 12 months were up 18.1%. "They're
leveraging these growing economies," Janney Capital Markets analyst David
Strasser said. "They're getting greater share while there's also a build toward
the middle class and upper-middle class."

And there's huge potential in the Colombian market. Colombia's population of 46
million is South America's second-largest behind Brazil. It has the
third-largest GDP on the continent after Brazil and Argentina. The nation's
central bank predicts GDP growth of 4.5% to 6.5% this year, driven in part by
increased oil production — Colombia is a net exporter — and strong consumer
spending.

Retailers there reported continued year-over-year sales growth for August,
according to the latest survey from Colombia's Federacion Nacional de
Comerciantes — National Federation of Merchants. And retailers were mostly
upbeat on prospects for the rest of 2011, too.

That makes it potentially fertile ground for PriceSmart. The company's
multination footprint also creates challenges, analysts say. No two Latin
American markets are identical. Cultures, customs and codes are different. "For
them to grow they need to navigate these different countries, different codes
and laws," Strasser said.

The company also needs relatively large patches of urban real estate for
stores. That can be hard to find in many cities. And because the economy is
stronger in Colombia, real estate is more expensive.

Competition is more intense, too, with well-stocked supermarkets and large
general merchandise retailers.

Though margins tend to be higher than U.S. warehouse retailers, they've
compressed in recent quarters as the company has lowered prices to lure new
members in.

More Stores, Higher Margins

But analysts think its margins, particularly in Colombia, will grow as it adds
more stores, which better leverages its distribution network. And Strasser
thinks PriceSmart's success in neighboring Panama bodes well for expansion to
the south in Colombia. He estimates the country could support 10 to 20
PriceSmart stores, which could contribute another $1 to $1.50 in full-year EPS.
And he thinks success in Colombia could lead to expansion in markets such as
Chile and Peru.

Singular's Garner says management has figured out a simple formula for success.
"They're just really good merchandisers," Garner said. "That's key to success
in any retail environment. What do customers here want? What's selling? What's
moving quick? They're very good at doing that and adjusting their buying for
that store."

Hi Paul -

A look at some of the discussed retailers using the Graham Number screen.

<img src='public/342737_c3ee8d34546b046d405d37a988aeb708.gif'>

When scanning several of the retailers (WAG,COST, WMT, TGT SHLD, JCP, PSMT, HD)
and calculating the Graham No. for valuation, the only one in the group that
comes close to a bargain is WAG. TGT is a close 2nd and probably my favorite
all around retailer in the group (based on value & product offerings). With a
GN value of $46.90, the stock is 4% overvalued but well w/i the fair value
margins (especially when you compare the GN to all of the other candidates).

COST $45.20 $81.00 79%

PSMT $24.37 $60.63 148%
HD $24.53 $43.20 75%
SHLD N/A $28.20 Note: Can't calculate w/ negative earnings (ie losses)

</pre>

If companies can grow their BV and/or earnings the GN will move higher. Also,
BV may be understated if companies own a lot of company owned real estate (like
HD & JCP) since the BV shows the value at cost not market value. I was
surprised to see WAG with a positive 1% undervalued number. They lost their
script contract to other vendors. Maybe future earnings will be lower as a
result and the current GN overstates current fair value.

For me, my value buy would be TGT but at this time I own no retailers even
though I like COST the best for shopping. I also spend quite a bit of money at
HD especially with my recent remodel projects.

I like Target in general but think their recent grocery section is a looser.
Both their produce & meat section (at least in my area) are inferior to what is
available locally. They just do not move the volume to keep items fresh.

Target is okay for me. Canned milk ( a staple in my household), yogurt, canned
soups, cereals, cheese, coffee, coke, are the sorts of things I get there at
good prices. And with a Target card you get 5% off. I would never consider
Target a one-stop store, but if you selectively choose what to buy there you
can save money. I'd agree that the fresh meats and produce there often look
unfresh. But not always. And the prices can be very good.

I started going to Target when my son was born and found that Target was the
best all around store for diapers, etc.. Sure beat Walmart, and they are kept
up better than Walmart and have shorter lines. As a shopper, I do not
understand why anyone would shop at Walmart.

I'd certainly consider Target on a short list of retailers. But the only one I
own is SVU.

One of the constraints for using the GN is that the BV <= 1.5 (you can go as
high as 2 but it is not advised) and the PE <= 15. Some analysts say to use a
five year average to arrive at better valuation number. I did not screen the
previous list by these constraints and that is why there was such a large
variation.

Both SVU & SWY meet these constraints and their GN reflect this. SVU is a
sleeper as I believe their earnings are at a trough level in the cycle and
could go much higher. This stock continues to be one of my core holdings as it
is selling near its BV of $7.07/share. They still continue to report positive
earnings and do generate positive free cash flow that is used to pay down debt
(from their earlier Albertsons acquisition) and pay a nice dividend (now
yielding 4.2%).

The hidden gem for SVU is their logistic division that is quite profitable.
After a few years I have got my average cost down to $8.00/share. I am not too
concerned that TGT will take sales away from SVU like many of the analysts had
predicted but same store sales are not growing like in the past. It should be a
slow and steady growth period in 2012 as management weeds out the non
productive stores, sell assets, cut distribution costs and work on increasing
revenues and earnings. At least that is the way I see it.

I was considering WMT as a possible buy since this is one of Buffets holdings.
After my review today, I will pass. I may consider WAG if it sell off
significantly (ie below $25/share) but for now, SVU seems like a good hold
candidate for me.

Hi Brian -

Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW) is a bit better than that for HD.
<pre>
Stock Graham # Current Price % Over Valued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------
HD $24.53 $43.20 75%
LOW $20.28 $26.34 30%

If you use Analysts 2012 earnings estimate of $1.78/share

LOW $23.11 $26.34 14%
</pre>
According to Graham, Lowe's is still overvalued but by far less than HD. Even
with next year's earnings Graham would consider Lowe's overvalued by 14%. In
the group of retail companies I posted it is one of the better values but still
not a bargain.

Through the GN screen, I am hoping to find a quick and dirty way to identify
companies that currently are selling w/ a low historical PE and good BV (that
has been growing) without going too deep into each of the company's financials.
<u>This type of screen does flag potential candidate stocks mainly because some
are selling at historically low PE's (ie WAG).</u>

Check out the chart posted today on the Dividend Investing thread:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27867872

The chart shows "Normal" 15 year PE's for several stocks. When the Graham No.
shows a good valuation candidate, most of the time the stock is selling
significantly below it's 15 year "Normal" PE. I have not calculated the Graham
No. for the stocks listed in this chart, but I bet there are several selling
below the fair value the Graham No. calculates.

Rising Future Interest Rates impact "fair" values
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Realistically, the 22.5 factor used in the Graham calculation should actually
be higher to represent the historically low interest rate environment.
According to Paul Senior, the factor s/d be more around 30 (assuming that the
BV constraint of <= 1.5 is maintained) which represents the long term AA bond
rate of 5%. This of course, raises the acceptable PE constraint to 20.

From an earlier post by Paul Senior:"... the AA bond rate is 5%, that the
earnings yield should be no more than that also. (Reference p. 186). Earnings
yield being earning/price or reciprocal of the p/e. So p/e to be paid should be
no more than 20 in a 5% AA bond environment. (1/20 =.05 = 5%)..."

Therefore, there are a lot of moving parts in this calculation. I hope that a
favorable GN now will alert me to a historically favorable market value
especially when long term interest rates are so low and are bound to move
higher in the coming months and/or years (ie reversion to mean idea).

That's my newest concern . . . a rising interest rate environment.

I think you are better off using just the PE instead of the graham number. It
does not make much sense to use the stated book number at all, since it is
"path dependent". I get interested in tangible book (supposedly the liquidation
value) if P/B is ~1 or less, but i don't care if it's 1.5 or 2 or 10.

This graham number does not make any provisions for growth potential or
leverage either. I think this Graham number is of very limited usefulness from

I agree. There's a ton of methods for screening stocks. But screening is just a

For example, using the GN is just as useful as looking at stocks hitting 52

look further to understand what's going on. A low GN is just as useful as a 52

re Pension fund deficit in the US:
http://www.ai-cio.com/channel/NEWSMAKERS/Mercer__US_Pension_Funding_Levels_Plum
et.html

I believe 2012 will become a moment of truth for companies with a Pension fund
deficit. As I understand it, changes implemented back in 2006 are now leaving
less leeway if pension funding levels drop below 80% and 60%. Then, there is
also the issue with still high expected rates of returns (typically ~8.5%),
which I think is going to be hard to achieve given record low interest rates
and a 40-50% of bonds in the asset mix. Reducing the expected rate of return
will dramatically increase liabilities (for infinite duration, you need 5% more
assets if you assume 5% lower interest rate, to at a 8% level, a 0.5% reduction
in Return will increase liabilities by 6.25%). Given the already low coverage,
I expect that many companies have to kick in significant cash to keep the
funding levels reasonable. Defense companies are particularly vulnerable, I
found that most have a pension deficit equal to ~20% of their revenues, now
image revenues shrinking and having to cough up real cash to sustain the
pensions. Maybe a short opportunity even...

XLS is one of the worst offenders in that regard, with pension deficit
(pre-tax) of 45% of the revenues.

that is amongst the most efficient ones in the US, their access to cheap crude
grades from Bakken and such (I expect to see a cost advantage even after
pipelines are in place to move the oil away from there, albeit smaller) and
their dividend and low leverage.

MPC just completed a significant investment program, so they should be able to
generate FCF in excess of earnings for a few years. They also have logistics
and pipeline assets that can be floated as an MLP at favorable conditions and
that should be worth 2-3B$, imo. The above points should compensate from the

STEALTHGAS INC. Announces New Charter Arrangements for Seven Vessels and the

From the article:"...Sale of Vessel
The Company has entered into an agreement to sell the smallest vessel in its
fleet, the 1,320cbm, built 1991, LPG carrier, Gas Tiny. The delivery of the
vessel to its new owners is scheduled towards the end of January. The Company
expects to book a profit from the sale of approximately $1.3 million in the
first quarter of 2012.

Chartering Update

The company has also concluded the following chartering arrangements:

The time charter for its 3,211cbm, built 1990, LPG carrier, Gas Crystal has
been extended until April 2012.

The time charter for its 6,572cbm, built 1995, LPG carrier, Gas Marathon has
been extended until January 2013. The charterer has an option to extend the
charter for a further six months.

The time charter for its 6,300cbm, built 2007, LPG carrier, Gas Flawless has
been extended until May 2012.

Two one-year time charters with a chemical company for its 3,434cbm, built
1992, LPG carrier, Gas Arctic and its 3,434cbm, built 1991, LPG carrier, Gas
Ice, commencing in January. The charterer has an option to extend the charters
for a further one year.

A five-year bareboat charter with a middle eastern state company for its
newbuilding 7,500cbm LPG carrier, Gas Husky, to be delivered in January.

A two year time charter with a middle eastern gas company for its 5,000cbm ,
built 1995, LPG carrier, Catterick. The charterer has an option to extend the
charter for a further one year.

With the above charter arrangements the Company will secure future revenues of
approximately $30 million.

Contracted coverage for the fleet is elevated to 71% for 2012 and 38% for
2013...."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glad to see that company will free up some cash w/ their sale. The new time
charters are a net positive especially that two of the seven are ling term (ie.
two & five year contracts).

I believe you saw the potential for this stock to achieve $9.00/share which is
a double from today's price of $4.13/share.

I am not too sure if the Yahoo BV of $14.77/share is meaningful. Maybe the
tangible BV w/ some sort of adjustment reflecting the scrap value of the fleet
might be a better number to use. I do know they have a lot of their capital
tied up into their fleet and are leveraged to the max with debt. Not a good mix
if the cycle has yet to bottom. Maybe w/ today's announcement of the new
charters is signaling that the bottom is in and we are headed back up.

What is more unsettling to me than the fact that existing regulations allowed

WSJ: Shale's Bounty Goes Beyond Oil, Gas
3:35p ET December 18, 2011 (Dow Jones)

WSJ: Shale's Bounty Goes Beyond Oil, Gas

By Ben Lefebvre

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--The U.S. shale-oil and natural-gas boom has cracked open
another lucrative market: gas liquids used to make plastics.
The same drilling technologies that have unlocked vast amounts of crude and
natural gas from previously unproductive shale formations across the U.S. also
are reaping large stores of ethane, propane and butane, known as natural-gas
liquids.
This growing bounty has resuscitated the U.S. petrochemical industry, which
just a few years ago was being strangled by the high costs of the raw
materials.
Processing ethane into chemicals is 50% cheaper than using crude oil-derived
naphtha and its availability has made U.S. petrochemical companies the envy of
overseas competitors. It also brings the prospect of lower prices for auto
parts, Styrofoam and other products.
"Now there's tremendous growth in natural-gas liquids, with more growth seen on
the horizon," said Adam Bedard, senior director at analysis firm Bentek Energy.
The boom has turned into a potential profit center for oil-and-gas producers,
as well as for the pipeline companies that transport the fuel. Demand for
ethane grew to about 933,000 barrels a day during the first half of 2011, up
from 812,000 barrels a day in 2009, according to Bentek Energy. But like the
other fuels extracted from remote shale deposits, the biggest problem is how to
get it to facilities that can process it.
A dearth of pipelines created a bottleneck that drove the price that
petrochemical companies pay for ethane to 95 cents per gallon in the third
quarter, from 60 cents at the start of the year, said Dow Chemical Co. Chief
Executive Andrew Liveris. But even with that price spike, chemical companies
prefer ethane over other chemicals, he said.
"Ethane is still by far the preferred feed here in the United States and is
much more cost-competitive than all of its equivalents," Mr. Liveris said
during a conference call with investors.
To free up the flow of natural-gas liquids, about 12,000 miles of pipeline
needs to be built by 2035, costing $14.5 billion, according to data from the
Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, a trade association.
Until those pipelines are built, higher production will make the market
volatile as short-term fixes such as rail transport are used, traders said.
Even so, over-the-counter trading for NGLs has grown, said William Paul, head
of natural-gas-liquid trading at Macquarie Energy.
"Over the last two years, the market has really evolved where you can trade
further out on the curve," Mr. Paul said. "The bulk of that is driven by
producers looking to hedge."
Some pipeline operators are working to expand their reach into oil- and
gas-producing shale formations. Enterprise Products Partners LP is spending $7
billion on projects, spokesman Rick Rainey said. That includes a 280,000
barrel-a-day pipeline joint venture with Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Enbridge
Energy Partners LP and a wholly owned 125,000-barrel-a-day pipeline, both of
which will transport natural-gas liquids from the shale formations in the
Northeast and mid-continent areas to the U.S. Gulf Coast, where the bulk of the
petrochemical companies are located.
DCP Midstream Partners LLC is also expanding its natural-gas liquids business,
building two pipelines with a combined capacity of 350,000 barrels a day from
the mid-continent and Texas to the Gulf Coast.
Even that new capacity may be tested. The INGAA expects the supply of
natural-gas liquids to grow 2% each year for the next 25 years, while crude-oil
supplies are forecast to increase 1.7% a year.
The growing supply of natural-gas liquid is also fueling the propane-export
market, as countries in Latin America and Europe increase their take of the
low-cost U.S. fuel used for cooking and heating. The U.S. shipped 134,000
barrels a day of propane overseas in September, a 28% increase year over year,
according to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
On the other end of the pipeline, demand from petrochemical and plastics
producers is expected to accelerate, with several companies planning large new
ethane-processing plants, said Bill Waldheim, president of DCP's northern
business unit.
The current plants already "can consume more than we can produce today," Mr.
Waldheim said.

The Chase person doesn't really want to give any information about the MF
Global case because of lawsuits. I do think he knows stuff that we don't - we
probably can read about that in MFGlobals bankruptcy filings years down the
road.

As for the financial transaction tax, while it is true that financial
transactions are not the inherent problem you can chase some undesired business
away when taxed right. For example a small transaction tax on stock sales or
buys that is unnoticeable to individuals could do wonders to chase high
frequency traders away, which I think would be better for the markets. Over (or
should we say under) the counter Derivatives could be taxed to force them on
exchanges.

As for the US, the Armageddon day will come when people notice that the US
fiscal deficit is twice that of Italy. If the US bond market crashes, the US
banks holding boatloats of treasuries or GSE papers will look just like Italy's
banks, the printing presses will run amok and Ben's helicopter will be circling
Manhattan like a swarm of bees.

We will also go from a 9% fiscal deficit of GNP to zero in a year or two, with
obvious consequences for the economy. At that point, Gold will look pretty
good, I presume.

C&J Energy Services, Inc. Commo (NYSE: CJES ) - Good value target price

at $27.66.
Suncor Energy Inc. Common Stoc (NYSE: SU) - Accumulating shares below $30.00 w/
PBR proceeds.

Started a tracking position in C&J Energy Services, Inc. Commo (NYSE: CJES ).
As you know they provide specialty equipment services for oil and natural gas
exploration and production companies in the Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma
regions. The company offers hydraulic fracturing, coiled tubing, and pressure
pumping services. Its fleet includes 4 hydraulic fracturing fleets, 13 coiled
tubing units, 16 double pump pressure pumps, and 9 single pump pressure pumps.

The average analysts earnings estimates for 2012 are $4.28 (according to
Yahoo). BV is $6.52 with a PE of $9.09 and forward PE of $6.60. This stock
appears to be in value territory. Calculating the Graham fair value No. you get
$25.05. Therefore, it looks that at the current price of $19.70, this stock is
selling 27% below it's GN fair value.

The market may be discounting their future earnings due to potential
regulations on future fracking services. However, (to me) seems like a good
value at the current price. Started a tracking position so I can watch and
monitor the company.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Closed out entire PBR position w/ unsettling feeling regarding their recent GOV

below $30.00. Will hold onto the cash in mean time.

Thanks Sergio, I missed EKS's earlier mention of DOW(kudo's eks). Did you
realize the price of ethane was at .96/gal in mid Oct and if I'm not mistaken
is now nearing .65/gal.
http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/LPGSMBPE:IND

Interesting quote
"Producers in the U.S. of ethylene, a plastics ingredient, are benefiting from
lower prices for natural gas, which is used as a raw material and to power
factories. Ethane, a natural-gas liquid that’s converted to ethylene, fell 5
cents to 68.5 cents a gallon at Mont Belvieu, Texas, the biggest drop since
Aug. 8 and the lowest prices since March 15, according to
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=LPGSMBPE:IND compiled by Bloomberg.
A drop of 1 cent per gallon in the price of ethane boosts earnings by 2 cents a
share at Rotterdam-based LyondellBasell and Midland, Michigan-based
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=DOW:US and by 9 cents at
Houston-based Westlake, http://topics.bloomberg.com/hassan-ahmed/ , an analyst
at Alembic Global Advisors in New York said in a note yesterday."

(that break through 31/sh could be a pivotal point for DOW-overall markets
willing)

and with regards to competing feedstock naptha
" Ethylene plants, known as crackers, are running at 70 percent to 72 percent
of capacity in http://topics.bloomberg.com/europe/ , where the use of naphtha
as a raw material is leading to a small loss to break- even, the CFO said. The
low operating rates have removed about 6,000 metric tons of ethylene from
global supply, he said. The plants can’t run any slower without being shut, he
said. "

BTU is a pure coal play. It is 5% undervalued when measured by the fair value
GN. I own CNX which is 50% coal and 50% NG. It's Graham No. is only $28.44 so
according to this measure, CNX is priced over it's fair value. CNX does pay a
higher dividend but w/ NG prices near an all time low, earnings depressed too.

My other coal holding is Penn Virginia Resource Partners (NYSE: PVR). They are
formed a a MLP and manage royalty coal trusts. They pay a much larger dividend
payout yielding around 7%. Small to little capital gain potential. I am looking
to sell 50% of my holdings at or near $28 as I believe I can redeploy the
proceeds elsewhere w/ better capital gain potential.

Of the three, BTU has a better GN and better capital gain potential. I am more
positive on Oil and even NG than coal long term. Many of the Canadian Sands
companies are quite undervalued (ie. SU & COSWF) too.

Of the group, coal companies have probably seen the biggest sell off. CNX was
trading as high as $55 last year and is now trading in the $36.00 area. PVR has
not had the sell off like BTU or CNX. It's only off 5% from it's high.

I know you do not like the Graham No. but it is calculated to be $18.85/share
for TESCO (pretty much where we both sold the stock) so at today's price it is
selling almost at a 30% discount. They recently opened a few Fresh&Easy stores
here in No. CA and they flopped. They are going to close those and some other
recently opened stores in the U.S.

Not even going to nibble at and TSCDY shares until the European mess clears up.
Maybe I will consider a tracking position if/when the shares reach a 50%
undervalue price from the GN or about $9.50/share.

FWIW my favorite new grocery store is Sprouts (formally Henry's).

From their Web Site:"...The merger of Sprouts Farmers Market and Henry’s

Hi Paul -

Penn West Petroleum Ltd (PWE) -NYSE

I am going to hold off on my sale of PWE shares. I have other sell candidates
that are over valued and probably a good time to lock in those profits.

I stumbled on this article on PWE title "Will Penn West deliver in 2012?"

http://www.dailyfinance.com/2012/01/13/will-penn-west-deliver-in-2012/

From the article:"...However, production should see a hike in 2012. With access
to major oil trends in the form of Vikings, Spearfish, Carbonates, and Cardium,
Penn West is now among the top five light-oil producers in Canada. Management
expects to fully scale up production in these key oil plays this year. With
capital expenditure expected to move up to $1.7 billion,<u> it translates into
a 7%?9% increase in annual average production</u><u>.</u> Again, a proportional
increase in cash flows could prompt management to increase dividends and the
yield, which is currently 5.5%. Moreover, analysts are expecting the next
twelve month P/E to be around 23 -- a substantial drop from 38, which was the
average trailing P/E in 2011.

In short, the company's fundamental game plan looks solid. I believe this
company will offer investors an excellent opportunity to invest in a dividend
stock..."

---------------------------------------------------------------

A 7%-9% increase in production will increase cash flow and eventually result in
a lower PE. As you pointed out in your post back in November, they have 670,000
acres under lease. Maybe they will use some of that extra cash to drill some
new wells. This is one of the areas that have significant light oil which sells
at a premium. I will hold my shares (a core position for me) to see how 2012
proceeds. It looks quite promising.

either meet or beat analyst expectations for earnings per share in 2012, $3.29?

And also to be one of the most famous brands for this – ceramic tiles, we

Obviously the market remains very cautious on these China stockS (AND SO FAR

Matt,

I think RIMM's north american business is suffering but what's your take on
their scope in developing markets? For example, in India the 3g capabilities
within the country are not well developed making the iPhone virtually useless
there. At the same time BlackBerry is growing its user base and increasing its
distribution channels. I understand that about 61% of revenues come from their
north american and UK markets but I am considering the stock as a potential
investment based on its head start and favourable demographics in the
developing markets.

My view of their valuation is more simplistic than the one you put forth. I
like to look at their values across time and their pre crisis valuations. In
2007/08 prices average above $100/share giving it a market cap of about $60b.
At the time its earnings were half what they are now. The only thing they had
going for them at that point was a favourable trend. Today the company makes
more than double that and its equity is valued at 1/7th the price of 07/08. I
think the market believes that not only does the company have a bleak future
but that it might not have one - a very irrational belief don't you think?

I regard the success that RIMM is enjoying in India as temporary. RIMM
advantage right now is that the email services will run reasonably well on the
prevalent 2G network while Android and Iphone really need 3G networks to work
well.

The 3G network buildout started late in India in 2010, once the infrastructure
is working well, I assume that RIMM will get clobbered by the better Android
and Iphone's just like anywhere else. Also keep in mind that while RIMM has
earnings, the cash flow recently have been exceedingly weak, in fact if I
remember correctly, RIMM has burned though a considerable amount of cash
defending their position (patent purchases, supply chain financing, tablet
writeoffs). Even if RIMM turns around their fortunes, their future will be much
less profitable than the past, imo. I assume so, because I think that RIMM
email service costs the consumer 10$/month in the US. This is a service that
with Android and Iphone is free and where RIMM needs to dramatically lower
their prices to compete, in my opinion.

A well written article that reviews COMPAGNIE GENERALE D (MGDDY.PK) - (Michelin
Tire) value proposition and their market advantage. Note: For US investors
there's an OTC ADR. Five ADRs represent one common share. Therefore, MGDDY.PK
at $12.00/share is equivalent to $60.00/share of the European traded common.
The article lists values in terms of the European common share amount (ie
$60.00/share).

The Case For Michelin
Dec. 31, 2011
http://www.gurufocus.com/news/157113/the-case-for-michelin

A few items in the article that caught my eye:

o At Michelin, roughly 50% of revenue comes from trucks, earthmovers and
planes.

o The US Navy just exercised a second five-year option to extend its tyre
supply contract with Michelin. Under the contract, Michelin is required to
deliver 100% of all Navy aircraft tyres anywhere on the continental United
States within 48 hours or less, and anywhere in the world, including deployed
aircraft carriers, in 96 hours or less. Michelin is currently exceeding the
Navy’s delivery requirements, averaging over 98 percent on-time delivery with
zero backorders.
The Navy no longer manages its own inventory like it used to. Michelin has a
similar contract with the Defense Logistics Agency, to supply aircraft tyres to
the US Air force, the US Army, and some allied foreign militaries.

o On average, Bridgestone generates about $ 2B of EBIT, Michelin generates $
2.5B and Goodyear $ 0.8B. The market cap of Michelin is roughly $ 10B, that's
4x EBIT. Goodyear trades at 4.5x and Bridgestone at 9x for a market cap of $
18B.

o Michelin is spending $2B per annum for 4 years to increase production volume
25%. This implies current production capacity is worth $8B x 4 = $32B. With
zero value assigned to the distribution business, we get a per share value of
EUR 70 => $90

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------

It looks like if one holds through this cycle, in four years Michelin should
have built out their production by at least 25% from current levels, still
maintain their exclusive tire fulfillment contract w/ the U.S. Navy (year four
of five years), and the company continues to simply generates more cash per
tyre sold than its close comps.

The article makes the case that the stock is undervalued by as much as 40%-50%
from it's current levels. MGDDY.PK fair value (according to the article is
between $16.50 - $18.00 per share).

Seems like the value proposition will need some time to play out.

EKS

P.S. When converting for the 5:1 ADR shares to Common, the GN in terms of the
ADR price s/b $11.15/share.

NVDA. I looked briefly again now and will continue to pass. Earnings history
too erratic for me. Continuing increases in stated book value though, and book
value very low now compared to previous annual average numbers. Stock a
possible double maybe. Or maybe not. For me, my situation, in this current
stock market, I'm going more conservative. I'll stick with Intel.
--------
No real reason for me to hang my hat on book value here: roe has been erratic
over the past ten years, and I've no idea if NVDA can earn any decent money on
that book value. That is, maybe price/stated book value is irrelevant. In which
case maybe a case can be made for low p/sales. Not good enough for me.

---------
That $1.5B is an"aggregate" amount to be received from Intel. Before tax, I
assume, so I would discount at the after-tax amount to NVDA, and I'd likely use
more than 15%.

Again, all jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

You'll probably agree with some of his conclusions and disagree with others. :)
In particular, he's pretty negative on the German companies you like. :)

Re European stocks - that blog post is actually a pretty good summary of
European stocks. Like GBL as well but of course it has been trading at. A
holding company discount forever. Ahe Graham Dodd formula that is used to value
stocks penalizes high ROE business and that is one reason why this formula is
flawed. with respect to VW the authors misses that the gearing comes from VW's
vehicle financing business, which sort of is like a low risk banking operation
attached to the car manufacturing core operation. In that light, complaining
about the gearing in my opinion does not make any sense.

I agree with the author to avoid banks,but I think insurance companies are
worth a look ( Allianz and others).

Good writeup regarding Michelin, I can mostly confirm these numbers.

GT's 4.5x EV/EBITDA does not contain the Pension liabilities of 2.6B$ (CS
claims 3.45B$ as per 12/31/11). When taken that into account, GT 4-4.5x
EV/EBITDA increases to 5-5.5x EV/EBITDA. Due to their Pension deficit, they
have to make substantial contributions to their Pension plan, I have seen
numbers as high as 400M$ anually. Also GT has lost market share for many years
now - their are underrepresented in emerging markets where ML and Bridgestone
are much stronger.
