Peeled off a few of my high price shares of LPNT to take a small profit before
their earnings release Friday. The last two earnings reports were not received
that well by the market. Stock is trading as if their earnings will be fine but
this stock tends to rally before earnings.

MDU Resources Group, Inc. (NYSE:MDU) reported pretty good earnings this
morning. I have the stock on my watch list as this looks like a good one to
hold for the long term if you get a good entry point.

I agree with you Grommit. It is quite possible that there will be NG glut in
next couple of years. On the other hand, I don't see oil glut, since I don't
really see huge oil projects coming online and substituting for declining
capacity worldwide. Oil sands are somewhat promising, but pace is slow,
approvals take a long time and buildout is slow too.

There are not that many uses where oil is easily substitutable. In
transportation there would have to be a lot of infra and vehicle change to
adopt NG.

Also, even if we have NG glut, gas-to-liquids is going to be small percentage
and again not easily buildable.

However, this means that it may be worthwhile to swap from mixed NG/oil plays
to purer oil plays. SU is a good candidate as are most of other oil sands.

AW, RSG, and WMI have been holding up well the last six months. Part of this is
due to the merger talks between AW/RSG and WMI/RSG.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1y&s=RSG&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=aw+wmi+spy

But earnings for at least AW have also improved with wider margins.

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080730/law068.html?.v=101

Part of this is due to margin expansion and it is interesting to note how the
increased price in recyclables are adding to the mix. Below is an excerpt from
a Star Tribune article

"Commodities prices for the materials bailed or binned out of recycling centers
-- to be remade into new water bottles, cans, and more -- are climbing steeply,
with analysts citing once again voracious demand out of China. A ton of
recycled newsprint in the New York market rose from $120 in January to $200
this month, said Mark Arzoumanian, editor of industry publication Official
Board Markets. Comparable increases on the recyclables spot markets have
aluminum priced at $2,000 a ton and plastics at $440 a ton.

That has haulers working to increase their emphasis on recycling, and the
payoff is already showing up. At Allied Waste, for example, revenue from sales
of recyclables rose 21 percent last year from 2006 to $257 million, according
to its annual report."

http://www.startribune.com/26264604.html

The Enterprise/EBIDTA ration has remained reasonable for all three companies.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=AW

Finally, I believe that AW will be taken over by RSG. My view isn't fully
recognized in the arbitrage between the two stocks. But I believe it is the
deal that makes the most sense as it is an all stock transaction and the RSG
managment is recognized as being the most capable of the big three companies.

I dont have an answer to that. however it isnt going to take long at these
prices for people to switch from heating oil to natural gas, on top of that if
NG continues to be $20 abroad and $8 here only a matter of time before that NG
gets shipped off to foreign countries. People in my area are switching out of
heating oil as they can no longer lock in pricing for their winter heating
costs. As Ive explained repeatedly once NG hits $9 in any given year CHK starts
to hedge and locks in nice profits. CHK is one of my largest positions and if
it goes down more and I have the funds I will probably buy more I dont believe
its possible for oil to be over $100 a barrel and for NG to stay below $10 for
any length of time. If MCDEP says the stock is worth $80 and one can make a
plausible case that is worth $125-$150 thats good enough for me. Having said
that I own lots of oil stocks too, but dont think I know them as well as I
think I understand CHK.

Don't get me wrong, I like CHK. But with limited funds I had to choose.

http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=104617&p=irol-presentations

From the presentation, CHK will earn 3.75 this year, no matter what NG prices
are. And in the range $4 to $4.50 next year (with $9 to 12 NG prices). My
opinion is NG stays low, $8.50 to $9.50.

Analysts have them at $4.30 in 2009, but that implies $11 NG. Maybe too high?

CHK has great assets in the ground. CHK and all these are good companies to
own.

CHK 11.3

First Industrial Realty
By: George Spritzer Tuesday, July 01, 2008 9:25 PM
http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewarticle+articleid_2365546.html
I picked up a small starter position today in First Industrial Realty (ticker:
FR) and plan to accumulate more on further price dips. First Industrial
develops and operates warehouses and light industrial buildings in the top
industrial markets in the US and select industrial real estate markets in
Canada, Belgium and the Netherlands. FR trades below its net asset value per
share and yields a whopping 10.4% with more than enough cash flow to maintain
the dividend.

FR has an interesting connection with Warren Buffett. On December 3, 1999,
Buffett auctioned off his 20 year old wallet with a secret stock tip inside to
benefit charity. John Morgan was the winner and paid $210,000 for the wallet.
Some time later, Mr. Morgan announced that the stock Buffett had recommended
was First Industrial Realty (FR). At the time, REIT's were very depressed. FR
was trading a little below $25 and yielding around 10%. After this year's drop
in financials, FR is trading around $27 which is close to the 1999 price level,
and it is again yielding over 10%.

Buffett later sold FR from his personal holdings in 2004 when it traded above
$40, and it later traded over $50 in 2006. If you add in the dividend yield,
the total return on the charity wallet pick was quite impressive!

FR has more risk than some of the other warehouse REIT's because it uses a
significant amount of leverage. But at the current valuation level, I believe
the risk/reward longer term is quite attractive.

Full Disclosure: I am long a starter position in FR.

I guess people need to have nerves of steel to hold BDCs in this market. It is
almost quadruple whammy for them: their investment prices drop so they have to
write them down, their own stock prices drop so they have trouble issuing
secondaries, credit markets are in turmoil so its tough for them to get debt
financing (cheaply at least), earnings/cash flows drop so they have to drop
dividends (MCGC) or risk paying out more than they earn (ACAS?). I thought that
banks were in bad spot with hugely over leveraged balance sheets, but it
appears that BDCs are faring much worse so far this Q at least compared to good
banks (USB, WFC, BAC).

MCGCs risk is that they were concentrated in couple large positions that are
probably hard to float and hard hit in this economy. Good luck with it.

Pretty good 2008 Q2 report for ERF. Beginning with their September
distribution, they will increase their payout by $0.05/share (an increase of
12%) to $0.47/month (14% annual yield). Cash flow is up 53%, operating costs
are contained and balance sheet is stronger with less debt YOY.

Enerplus announces 2008 second quarter results and increase in monthly cash
distribution rate
Thursday August 7, 6:00 am ET
http://biz.yahoo.com/cnw/080807/enerplus_q2_results.html?.v=1

This type of result is probably typical of many of the Energy Trusts in this
sector. The company had hedged (up to 30%) of their oil and ng production (out
18 months) at rates 30% below the current market prices. This still resulted in
a 53% increase in their Q2 YOY cash flow. As long as oil trades above
$100/barrel, they should be able to post similar results next year.

MCGC. Not a great time to be a holder of bdc MCGC. People in it for the
dividends and the dividends are gone. (Dividends and/or dividend growth being
the major attraction of bdc's (imo)) Management says they'll resume
distributions next year. Though with financials in this market environment, who
knows? Resume? - At what rate? Plus management for several reasons has lost a
lot of credibility with many shareholders. For many shareholders, it's maybe a
good time to cut losses. Perhaps a very good time to depart: Stock seems to be
a $2-3 stock with maybe a price heading under $2, if stock market declines or
if more of MCGC's investments go sour.

With the current bad news I'm interested in adding to my position. Net assets
from what I can discern still much above current stock price. MCGC is involved
with a diversity of dinky businesses, and not all have defaulted on debt owned
to MCGC.

The issue for a value investor is always this: It's not that the company has
dropped in value and will it get back to where it was (stock price) six months
ago? The stock likely may never again get that high. People like me who were in
earlier may never be made whole on purchases made early '08 or in '07 or '06 or
for any previous year. We likely (imo) will never recover our investment. So
should we sell and move on? The issue is, with the stock now at about $2.79,
where in future will that stock be? I am saying possibly very higher - maybe a
double IF underlying debt that's being paid now continues to be paid, and if
MCGC management doesn't mess up the company.

I'll bet small only, but bet I will. Added a little to my losing position
today. Hoping to hold on for at least a year to see what develops.

monetization of their ownership interests which probably wont happen until the
ipo market comes back. There were very clear warning signs for me to back off
from this investment and I flat out erred. I bought it as an asset play rather
than a dividend play, but I was skeptical of what management was saying right

I generally do not like to trade the stocks that I consider to be long term

HLX looks okay to me.

Forward p/e maybe 7 (Yahoo '09). Profitable every year of past ten. Decent ROE
for the price. D/e a little high (imo) at .9 - I guess because of recent
acquisition.

Company making some changes to its business model. An oil service provider
unlike most, in past when business was slow, company was able to deploy its
crews to its own e&p business. Now it is selling some of that business - all
their onshore oil & gas properties. I believe they'll be concentrating their
efforts on deepwater.

Stock's near a 12-month low. If prospects for company were as good as I suspect
they are, then that shouldn't be, even though oil and gas prices and oil/gas
stocks have come down from highs. So perhaps my outlook is incorrect, and good
numbers above will change for the worse.

I'll bet more on the company and its stock recovery. Doubling up on my position
today.

I see Yahoo shows ACRGY as a competitor. That stock's also near a 12-mo low. I
like ACRGY for its business and its possibilities as a supplier to Brazil's
Petrobras. Holding on to my losing position.

If pressed, I'd say, yes, "easiest and safest" way. Maybe cheapest
(commission-wise) too.

My preference is to buy a package of these companies and to accumulate them
individually when I see a particular one reach an attractive level for
purchase. Not to buy them all at once as through an OIH. In that way, I also
can sell them individually when I want.

However, the prices have come down to where most, imo, are in or at buying
levels. So yes, if not already in the sector, my opinion is OIH would be quite
okay. I have most stocks on the list that Yahoo shows for majority of OIH
components:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?s=BHI,DO,HAL,NBR,NOV,NE,SLB,SII,RIG,WFT&d=v1

(I don't follow Smith or Weatherford and have no shares. Others above I hold
varying positions. --- Another reason I like to buy individually - I can come
up with my own weighting.)

RIG and SLB total 25%, according to Yahoo. I've been a buyer of both at both
higher and lower prices than current. (I am olding on to my shares)

I'm no expert in the sector or in the specific stocks. Anybody else here with
pros/cons of buying OIH or not buying OIH or individual stocks therein, please

OT: Some word stuff: Not sure I understand what an "untimely news event" is or
how dangerous it affects one's portfolio. I could understand bad news announced
at a quarterly press release, but that would be maybe "unexpected" bad news,
not "untimely" news because, the p.r. date is known in advance, thus, it's
"timely" news. Maybe something like an oil rig damaged by a suddenly appearing
hurricane - that could be an "untimely news event". Sometimes these things turn
out to be one-time, exceptional events, and don't (shouldn't?) crater one's
stock for very long (??)

Anyway, a package of these things - individually chosen or as with an OIH -
mitigates against a major blowup of the portfolio when one of the stocks takes
a hit.

I like "packages" for a number of reasons, chief among them is that when stocks
in a sector are down (the sector being down), it is difficult for me to
determine which stock is the best stock to buy for the time when business and
the sector improve - e.g., the best-of-breed stock (whatever that is)?, the
most downtrodden stock?, the most leveraged stock?, the stock with the most
respected management?, the least indebted stock?, the largest capitalized
stock?, etc. etc. So I'll take a package and look for, and be satisfied with,
good sector performance overall.

Here are some "packages" I'm holding in a few sectors/subsectors.

The problem with index ETFs is that it's much harder to value them compared to
individual stocks. So with individual stocks you may buy and sell on valuation.
With index ETFs you are pretty much stuck with some macro prediction. Which may

Pretty good Q2 2008 report.

UPDATE 2-Gerdau 2nd-qtr profit soars 85 pct on strong sales

http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINN0642106720080806?rpc=44

From the article:"...In Brazil, Gerdau's second-biggest market after North
America, net revenue increased 47.5 percent, driven by robust demand from the
construction and automobile industries. The company cut back on exports from
its Brazilian operations to funnel more steel to the booming domestic
market...."

==========================================================

I am expecting continued growth in Brazil. The value proposition for me is low
forward PE at 7, better than industry operating margins and located in large
growth market. Negatives are high debt and the company would be impacted by
slower world wide growth especially in North America.

The company adds another sector of diversification to my other Brazil holdings.
A stronger U.S. dollar would allow GGB to expand their domestic (South America)
production where their operations are the most efficient and profitable.

Adding small to my losing position in auto supplier Lear, LEA.

This stock seems to track GM stock,

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=LEA&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=gm

At some point, if GM stock goes to near zero, I suspect GM will get some
government support (ala Chrysler in its dark days). So the production of GM
vehicles (and LEA vehicle seats & electrical distribution business) will not
necessarily evaporate. LEA also sells to Toyota, Hyundai (Alabama), etc., so if
vehicle (truck/car) production ever picks up (Vehicle production is at
multi-year low now.), LEA should still be able to participate.

I assume LEA has the similar problems of GM - high union labor costs, pension
issues, maybe (or maybe not) health care costs. And it's in an increasingly
competitive business.

Some info about Lear from the 10K:
"We are a leading global automotive supplier with net sales of $16.0 billion in
2007 (net sales of $15.3 billion
excluding our recently-divested interior business). With this level of sales,
we would rank within the top 200 of the
Fortune 500 list of publicly-traded U.S. companies. Our business is focused on
providing complete seat systems,
electrical distribution systems and electronic products, and we supply every
major automotive manufacturer in the
world. In seating systems, based on independent market studies and management
estimates, we believe that we hold
a #2 position globally on the basis of revenue. We estimate the global seating
systems market to be between $45 and
$50 billion. In electrical distribution systems, based on independent market
studies and management estimates, we
believe that we hold a #3 position in North America and a #4 position in Europe
on the basis of revenue. We estimate
the global electrical distribution systems market to be between $20 and $25
billion.
We have pursued a global strategy, aggressively expanding our operations in
Europe, Central America, Africa
and Asia. Since 2002, we have realized a 12% compound annual growth rate in net
sales outside of North America,
with 55% of our 2007 sales coming from outside of North America. Our
Asian-related sales (on an aggregate basis,
including both consolidated and unconsolidated sales) have grown from $800
million in 2002 to $2.9 billion in 2007.
We expect additional Asian-related sales growth in 2008, led by expanding
relationships with Hyundai, Nissan and
certain regional manufacturers.
In 2007, our sales were comprised of the following vehicle categories: 58%
cars, including 24% mid-size, 19%
compact, 13% luxury/sport and 2% full-size, and 42% light truck, including 23%
sport utility/crossover and 19%
pickup and other light truck. We have expertise in all platform segments of the
automotive market and expect to
continue to win new business in line with market trends."

So far CHME, CPHI and AOB have reported.

CHME and CPHI reported pretty good "reported results". However, the issue of
huge AR, notes receivables, inventories and advances to suppliers remains. It
seems that Chinese pharma distribution companies act almost like a free credit
line for hospitals and even their suppliers. Their own cash disappears while
their customers get almost a year of free credit. It is Chinese specific custom
and probably they will collect the AR, since they deal with state hospitals
that ultimately do pay. But in the meantime any sales growth means even more
negative cash flow, since the ARs collected lag by a year and are smaller than
new ARs created. This leads to dilution or borrowing.

IMHO, these companies still have potential, but I would not put a lot of money
into them. It's always possible that they would go up in speculative spike, but
I would not count on it.

AOB is a bit different. It is much bigger company, so a larger part of its
equity is not in the AR, inventories, etc. However, a large part of it is
goodwill/intangibles. And the AR/inventory issues are there too, they are just
less apparent. AOBs valuation is less attractive than CHME or CPHI using any
measure. The only positive could be its size, which may lead it to attractive
opportunities not available for smaller competitors.

I currently hold all three companies mentioned and also LTUS. However, IMHO,
none of them are clear buys at this time. If CHME falls below book again, it
might be an attractive investment.

There are three companies in the business. One is a Euro. company,

GTI has research operations involved in batteries and fuel cells, other tech

Further, as regards GGB USA business, the low dollar vs. Euro (even after

Amazing - now at 30% of tangible book, profitable, paying a small divie, and

Namoi Cotton's positive profit forecast, despite drought impact
24/07/2008 2:18:00 PM
Namoi Cotton has forecast a net profit after tax in the range of $4-5 million
for the full year to end 28 February, 2009, despite the smallest Australian
cotton crop in 25 years, the impact of drought and the volatility in global
commodity markets.
Australian cotton production for the 2008 crop of 0.6 million bales (2007 crop
1.2 million bales) represents only 20pc of its sustainable capacity.

Namoi Cotton CEO, Bob Bell, attributes the positive performance, to the ongoing
strategic focus of the organisation and to Namoi Cotton’s unique business
model.

“Our marketing strategies and strong risk management disciplines have also been
fundamental to our success in recent seasons,” Mr Bell said.

“This has resulted in significant gains in market share, as growers and export
customers have recognised the differentiation of Namoi Cotton from its
competitors in the market place.

“We are committed to a strong regional presence and to the exclusive marketing
of only Australian cotton and agricultural commodities.”

Directors will consider the determination of an interim distribution in future
months.

BP- I am suprised you sold BP. I am still holding my shares. Granted, the
company has been an underperformer but selling now?

My oil exposure is pretty small, so i am thinking about upping my exposure
here. i am looking at the following list> I am looking at lower risk position
as a portfolio anchor.

BP - the underperforming company in big oil and the TNK-BP disaster does not
help either- if the new management can get BP's ROA numbers back to industry
standards the stock would be a winner. Nice dividend yield

RDS-A. They also had problems dating back to reserve accounting problems but
now a slowly improving.N Cheap and a decent dividend yield. Strength in
integrated NG.

COP. Cheap but balance sheet not as strong as most peers. They overpaid for BR
(IMO) in 2006. Dividend yield is below average. Some oil sand exposure

TOT. Maybe my favorite. Best LT track record. Cheap. Above average production
growth prospects.

PCZ: relatively small Canadian integrated. Strong balance sheet but they
struggled to increase production in recent years. Oil sands exposure but I was
disappointed by the low expected ROA (mid teens @100$/barrel) projected from
those ventures.

SU: pure oils sands play and looks relatively expensive but is about to double
production. SU has the most leverage to crude prices, for the better or the
worse.

As i read my own musing, i think TOT is my favorite from the group. It is sort
of amazing that the stocks of the supermajors have not benefited from the crude
runup but are not being shot with the recent fall. The smaller and more
leveraged players (SU and others have quite a run but they vulnerable to lower
crude prices since their production costs have shot up quite a bit over the
last few years. I think the supermajors will handle lower crude prices very
well and the current stock prices look like bargains.

After you've established such a position, when does it become attractive to
fill it out to a full position?

If the stock goes down more, but the fundamentals look even more attractive?

Yes.

If it starts to go up and breaks thru overhead resistance?

I don't use TA and usually I don't like to average up. However, sometimes I do,
usually though when I have held the position for a long time and the price
becomes attractive again to add to it. I don't usually add if stock runs up
from my buy price in couple weeks or months.

If they release an earnings report that seems to herald further good news?

Yes, if there is no runup.

Any specific percentages that come into play?

I used to average down at 10-20% drops, but recently I have not been doing that
so much. IMHO, it is more important what new things I learn about the company
than what percentage it drops. If the company continues executing - even in
adverse circumstances - I would continue buying. If there are negative changes
in business outlook, income or balance sheet - and usually there always are
when price drops - I would try to evaluate whether the negatives are temporary
and how deep and bad they are. Two examples from very different ends of
spectrum are ASFI and HOG. HOG is a superbrand that has some trouble with
current economy, with high gas prices and perhaps with greying of its customer
base. Great balance sheet, great margins even in downturn. So there the
decision is whether the brand is still viable long term. No risk of company
going BK or something like that. ASFI on the other side is a company which has
some risk of going BK, the balance sheet is weak, but on the other hand the
company is trading way below book, which is composed practically from
receivables that they could turn into cash. There the questions are very
different: how big is the BK risk? Are they overvaluing the book or can they
unwind it into the cash at current valuation? Will they dilute to hell via debt
or equity or both? All these things need to be answered to decide whether to
buy on drop... In these concrete situations, I was adding HOG as it dropped to
new lows, but I was not adding ASFI. Just my choice, someone else could do the
opposite.

Overall, I like to get into positions by steps. I don't think I ever bought a
big position with a single buy. I have sold some in a single sell when I
decided that I don't believe the company anymore. Though mostly, I sell in
steps too.

Bridge Player: On upping a tracking position:

Generally I'm making my first buy in a value stock as the price drops. Often,
I'm starting to buy as the price is falling, so I figure the stock will
continue to drop and I may be able to buy more at a better (lower) price. I buy
my first shares because the stock is a value (to me) at the price I see, and I
can't be sure the stock will fall further.

If I view "fundamentals" as something that's relevant and internal to the
company's business - not changed by fluctuations in its stock price, then if
the fundamentals don't change or if they improve (sometimes as evidenced by
good quarterly reports) and yet the stock drops further, then yes, I'm
generally buying more.

I don't follow or pay any attention to "overhead resistance".

I seldom take an initial stock position that's greater than 0.5% of my
portfolio. I use position size as a way to control business risk that the
company might have. (My small initial buy means my loss should be small if the
company's business craters while I'm tracking it.) Regarding market risk:
Oftentimes, I'm buying a downtrodden stock in a sector that's being beat up,
and consequently I'm accumulating several stocks in that sector at the same
time or consecutively. This year, for example, it seemed like I was initiating
small positions in a couple of big pharma stocks while also adding to positions
I held in other big pharma stocks, as the entire sector was being hit. While my
bet on an individual pharma stock might look silly -- too little money bet, no
substantial reward if bet is correct, too much time spent looking at the
particular company to have made such a small bet -- in total, I believed I put
enough of a percentage of my portfolios into big pharma to where I believe the
risk/reward and payoff would be favorable.
---------------------
That's for value stocks. For theme ideas, I like to buy small, track the
company, its business, its stock, and if the theme seems to be working out, buy
more if the stock rises. An example of a theme for me would be the growth in
infrastructure if/as Brazilian oil fields are developed. I've added to house
construction company GFA as it's stock rose, and I subsequently deployed funds
into a second such Brazilian company as prospects looked better for the theme
playing out. Dangerous to average up though in the volatile stock market we're
experiencing: I'm in losing positions now in several of the theme plays I have
as the stocks have fallen.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1y&s=BP&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=e%2Crds-b%2Ctot%2Cxom+co

So maybe buying (or selling) any now will give the same results.

I'm buying more XOM. Have an order in for a little more tomorrow. XOM at 12-mo
low, d/e very low, 10% ($7.60) of the stock in cash. Dividend is nowhere near
as good as some others (BP/E), but it gets increased every year. (I hold a few
shares of http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BPT in a Roth account where I presume I
won't have to deal with tax issues relating to a royalty trust.

As regards other stocks:
I'm out now of RDS-B. (have no A shares either)
COP - holding a full position
TOT- have a position, may add more.
PCZ- have a position. Have added at higher prices than current
SU- holding an overweight position. (Not a buyer at current price.)
E - holding a few shares. Should I be concerned about its Russia/Georgia
business?
CVX, OXY holding all shares. Have several- most- others - SSL, STO, MRO,
McDep's, Brazilian, etc.

TLM- I'm adding more

Paul, yes i also think that TLM, TOT and PCZ are the most attractive in terms
of value.

Going through my portfolio, i am considering adding to GBL.BR. Almost 45% of
the portfolio value is in TOT shares and the NAV is north of 100 Euro/shares
with the shares currently at less than 70 Euro's. Adding to GBL is the economic
equivalent to adding to TOT at a considerable discount (they also hold Lafarge,
Pernod Ricard and some other European Blue chips).

I sold my 1/2 of my BMW3.DE on the recent bounce.news is not good and the car
business may be impaired for quite some time with the high oil prices. The news
about aggressive lease discounting scared me the most, as they could damage the
resale value and the brand. I still own my shares from way back then though.

GBL. GBL vs. my pick of Pargesa.

http://www.pargesa.ch/sujet_en/particip/particip.html

I chose Pargesa because I can buy it easily:

Perhaps GBL is the better bet if Pargesa will continue to by GBL in the open
market:

The reason I prefer GBl over Pargesa is that GBL'is a simple holding company
and hence valuation is more straightforward.
Pargesa controls more than 50% of GBL but the net asset value of Pargesa is
calculated using the look through value of GBL (which is higher than the
current stock price). If Pargesa would calculate the NAV by valuing their GBL
holding at the current stock price not GBL's NAV, Pargesa's NAV would be quite
a bit lower.

Using the look through value is partly justified since Pargesa owns the
majority of GBL - nevertheless if they really wanted to make use of the higher
NAV of GBL they would need to offer a premium over the current share price for
GBL stockholders (which would be fine with me).

Did you ever look at the Power Co. arm of this holding company jungle?

FWIW buying GBL shares using an Interactive broker account is a breeze and
commissions are very reasonable. Pargesa on the OTC is very illiquid with only
about 200 shares trades each day.

"Overall, I like to get into positions by steps. I don't think I ever bought a
big position with a single buy. I have sold some in a single sell when I
decided that I don't believe the company anymore. Though mostly, I sell in
steps too."

Jurgis Bekepuris: That's my preferred way to buy also. And my preference as
well as regards selling (i.e. selling in steps).

Every few years I seem to go for a big position with a single buy. -- That's
generally not worked out well for me. I'm tempted again now with several stocks
though -- some stocks near decade lows, still apparently earning good money,
and if not bought quickly may move up from their lows (as financials have since
their nadir of July 15).

No, I've never looked at Power. Seems too complex for me to understand (many
financial businesses, and complex (to me) accounting).

Same family controls both Power and Pargesa, is that right?

Power & Pargesa
NAT.BR and POW.To jointly control Pargesa as detailed here:

http://www.npm-cnp.be/static_files/attachments/20080331_structure_EN.pdf

Power and NAT are two different entities who jointly control Parjointco which
controls Pargesa which controls GBL. Things couldn't be simpler <g>.
