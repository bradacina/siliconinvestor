Nik,
Thisi the inflation rate in Japan. If you look from 1990 till now you will see
that inflation is mostly down or negative (deflation) till 2012. And this is at
0% interest rates...

OT,

We probably should close this discussion, since it is OT here. :)

You are assuming that China will crash. I am not so sure. If China does not
crash, but continues to grow even at slower pace, commodity deflation will be
short lived, since they will consume a lot of commodities. There is also a
question of how rest-of-the-world goes. If Lat America, India, SE Asia continue
doing well, they will offset some of the Euro weakness.

There are big differences from Japan (as far as the explanation from your
youtube video goes). Japanese companies had huge debts that they were paying
down. US (and Canadian and Euro) companies have very little debt, especially
after couple years of refinancing. Actually they are quite overcapitalized. So
there may be holdback to expansion due to consumers (and government) demand
destruction, but companies are not deleveraging.

Japan also was suddenly very expensive place to do business compared to other
countries. Due to wage inflation in China, it's the opposite situation in US -
it is becoming more attractive place to do business.

So IMHO, the business situation is rather good.

There is risk of consumers deleveraging. I don't think the situation in
consumer land is very bad in US. I think it is getting better although there
are people in hole due to RE downturn.

I think the biggest risk is high sovereign debt in Eurozone and US, which leads
to the risk of US+Euro government deleveraging through austerity measures and
so pushing Eurozone and US into recession. I don't have a great answer of how
to deal with this. IMHO, part of it is balancing govt sector austerity with
private sector growth, so that economy muddles through without a huge drop.
Whether such balancing will be done and will work out is a tough guess.
Printing money is another part of solution and it is being done and will
continue to be done. This is inflationary though.

Re: Currency: USD/JPY; EUR/USD
Sony Corporation (SNE) -NYSE
Potential hidden value in a strong $US and foreign companies that benefit from
a strong $US

I think the relevant observation for Japan (and one I am watching) is $USD/JPY.
My premise is $USD will get stronger relative to the JPY, perhaps back to 100
(or higher) making items manufactured in Japan cheeper to US consumers.

<img src='/public/342737_2b01c78256248a20433edd0e41e30e15.png'>
I am looking at investing in "Value" Japanese companies. I know Clownbuck
watches these companies and may have a few names that would play into the
stronger $US theme. As the $US gets stronger relative to the YEN, exports from
Japan to the US become more attractive. However, European exports may fall as
the EURO weakens as I believe eventually EUR/USD will reach parity.

<img src='/public/342737_72a4edfda95505bb923db38ec2e37c32.png'>

The wildcard for me is Canada. They have the strongest banks and IMO the least
to worry about financial implosion (other than exposure to the EU). I expect
$CAN to stay around parity with $US other than recently $3 billion worth of
five year Yankee bonds — the first U.S.-dollar denominated offering by Canada
since 2009 were issued.
http://www.moneynews.com/Markets/USInvestorsFlocktoCanadas'Yankee-Bonds/2012/02
10/id/429069#ixzz1uVof5rie

These bonds must be paid back in $US. That could ultimately hurt Canada if/when
their currency is impacted by a strong $US. A huge growing debt load by Canada
w/ more FED QE could eventually see the $CAN cave in like the Euro.

<img src='/public/342737_58617a0bbabdfe5d3276d713f102fe8b.png'>
So, buying Canadian companies may be an eventual "Value Trap" if the currency
parity relationship $CAN/$US changes substantially over the next 10 years.

So for me, there is an investment theme here as money sloshes around the world
and recently $US still seems like the currency of choice to own. My investment
preference is to stay with US companies that manufacture and/or own $US
domestic assets and/or sells product only to US buyers OR Foreign companies
that sell product to US consumers w/ weak or falling currencies relative to
$US. Japan is/will be one of these countries.

What's your take?

I have seen everything I posted happen to either Allied or other BDC's. Risk is

I believe that BDC are such a case, because the management incentives are not
in increase profits, they are geared towards increasing assets, which by itself
is a recipe for disaster. Apparently you know BDC only during bullish credit

the company. But they probably won't and then stock will collapse even more.

Assuming they don't take the offer, the stock is not cheap. Even if they earned
600M like they did in 2010, the stock would be at 15P/E. But they won't earn
600M this year, not even close. So...

Do you think Q1 was seasonal aberration or is it an indication of the things to
come? Do you have high confidence in the new CEO?

It might be a good investment if either we were sure they will take the bid or
if we knew it will turn around. Otherwise it's a crapshoot.

I think there are two things that mainly influence the price of CAD relative to
USD. First is interest rates and the second is commodity prices, oil etc. As
long as US keeps the interest rate low, we have to keep it low too, or the CAD
will increase in price and we will have difficulty exporting to US which is 65%
of the export of Canada. It is bad for the housing market, but hey prefer to
keep exports. This created a clear housing bubble in Canada. The banks probably
are stable because CMHC (government company that insures all mortgages with
less than 25% down) insures everything. So, there is an incentive for the banks
to sell mortgages no matter what. They have no risk if the housing market does
not correct more than 25%. And the standards are loose. But soon the government
will have to do something about the swelling property prices - banks will not
be allowed to package in mortgage bonds any mortgages insured by CMHC. So,
banks will become less profitable IMO.
If China starts using less commodities and this is not compensated for by the
developing countries as Jurgis suggests, than the Canadian dollar will fall.
Jurgis is also right that the balance sheets of CAD companies are very good,
which means we may not have the balance sheet recession that was in Japan. On
consumer level, deleveraging is inevitable in Canada and consumer prices should
not be going up. Down is more likely than up, which is deflation.
There too many unknowns to the equation. Will there be QE3, how Europe will
deal with the crisis? How much China will slow?

LETTER FROM COTY INC. <u>(dated May 9, 2012)</u>

Board of Directors of Avon Products, Inc.
1345 A venue of the Americas
New York, NY 10105

Dear Members of the Board:

Since we made public our non-binding proposal to acquire Avon for cash (the
"proposal") more than a month ago, we have spent significant time listening to
your shareholders and analyzing public information, including your most recent
quarterly results. We continue to believe that our proposal would provide
compelling value to Avon's shareholders relative to a difficult and uncertain
multi-year turnaround on a stand-alone basis. The combination of Avon and Coty
would create a global beauty company with broader innovation, branding and
execution capabilities to benefit its customers, representatives and associates
around the world.

We have been disappointed by the current stalemate. As you know, we contacted
Avon last week in an effort to break this deadlock. We indicated that we were
prepared to engage in non-public discussions and discuss an increase to our
proposal of $23.25 if substantiated through a three-week diligence process.

We remain keenly focused on understanding Avon's operational and financial
challenges, evidenced by your disappointing first quarter results and outlook,
as well as your recent credit ratings downgrades. We need to confirm our
synergy estimates, the availability of which will be critical to our final
valuation and the reinvestment required to implement a turnaround of Avon. In
particular, we are very interested in understanding the components of your SG&A
expense line item as we evaluate how to increase economic opportunities for
your representatives relative to controlling overall corporate spending. We
also need to better understand your ongoing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
investigation and litigation, and what it will cost to address operational and
financial problems and these liabilities.

We are prepared to sign a confidentiality agreement with standstill provisions
that would restrict us from taking further public steps in seeking to acquire
Avon so long as you agree in good faith to provide us with requested
information on a timely basis. As we have consistently indicated, we and our
financing partners will only pursue this proposal on a consensual basis,
including having conducted due diligence. Our equity financing sources will
include our principal shareholder Joh. A. Benckiser, BOT Capital Partners and
certain of its limited partners, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Our debt financing
will be provided by JPMorgan Securities.

Upon signing the confidentiality agreement, we anticipate we would need only
several weeks to conduct expedited due diligence of Avon and finalize the terms
of a possible transaction. We have attached to this letter a list of priority
diligence items that we believe would enable us to form a definitive view of
value beyond where we have arrived based on public information.

When we contacted you again last week, you advised us that Avon's Board of
Directors was not prepared to engage in any discussions regarding any revised
proposal until Avon had completed a strategic and operational internal review
with its new CEO. While we understand Avon's interest in conducting such a
review given the significant challenges and uncertainties described in your
recent analyst call, this review can and should be done in parallel with
exploring the strategic alternative of selling the company so the Board may
compare both proposals side by side and make the right choice for Avon
shareholders.

In any event, we will not keep our proposal open for the several months that
you say you need to conduct your internal review. We and our equity sources are
prepared to work until May 31, 2012 to see if we have a mutually agreeable
basis for a transaction. If you are prepared to enter into discussions, we can,
prior to this expiration date, determine whether there is an opportunity to
provide significant and certain immediate value to Avon's shareholders.

In our final effort to move forward with discussions, we are revising our
proposal to $24.75 subject to due diligence and the other conditions described
below. This price represents a premium of over 36% to the original undisturbed
closing price on March 6, 2012 before our initial proposal of$22.25 and also
represents over $1 billion of incremental value to your shareholders, despite a
materially weakened outlook for your business. Given the challenges facing your
business, we believe the premium is even higher when considering your potential
stock price in the absence of a possible transaction. If in our work we find
considerably more positives than negatives, we would be prepared to propose a
higher price; if we find more negatives than positives, it would be difficult
to justify our revised proposal. If after due diligence our final proposal were
to be unacceptable to you, we will simply indicate so in a mutually agreeable
statement and part company as friends.

In order to end the uncertainty around this transaction for both your
organization and ours, we request that you respond to our revised proposal by
close of business on Monday, May 14th. If you choose not to engage with us, we
will withdraw our proposal. Our intention is to submit this letter and our
revised proposal to Avon's Board on a confidential basis. However, if you do
not enter into discussions with us by May 14th, we will have to inform the
public markets of the circumstances of our withdrawal.

This letter and our proposal and revised proposal constitute a preliminary,
non-binding indication of interest to acquire the outstanding shares of Avon,
and our revised proposal is being submitted based on the understanding that it
is not an offer that is capable of being accepted and that there will be no
binding agreement between us or any commitment or obligation on either party
with respect to the revised proposal or a possible transaction unless and until
a definitive agreement is executed by Avon and Coty. We reserve the right to
discontinue discussions regarding, and withdraw, our revised proposal at any
time. Our revised proposal is subject to customary conditions, including, among
other things, our satisfaction with the results of due diligence in our sole
discretion, the negotiation of a mutually satisfactory definitive agreement,
financing and the approval of the negotiated terms of a transaction by our
Board of Directors.

I sincerely hope you will agree that your shareholders' interests will be best
served by meeting with us to discuss our proposal.

With best regards,
Bart Becht

Clownbuck,

You make some good points, but I think your reasoning is skewed by ALD.

BDCs may or may not be junk bonds with leverage in disguise. Those that depend
on syndicated paper (such as AINV in the past) are essentially that. Those that
originate their own loans to middle market companies are not. That is a real
business that cannot be replicated using junk bonds or junk bond funds.

BDCs are related to private equity. Some make private equity investments.
Others make debt investments alongside private equity.

Some BDCs may have been akin to a Ponzi schemes (ALD, ACAS in the past?), but
others, such as ARCC, have managed quite well through the crisis and are
clearly reputable companies with excellent track records.

BDCs are not good to own in a credit crisis, but right now they don't seem any
frothier than junk bonds. I actually think they look attractive relative to
junk bonds right now, although with junk bonds yielding only 7% on average,
they are not all that attractive.

There are major negatives of high fees and credit sensitivity, but all in all I
think BDCs are worthy of investment consideration. I especially am interested
in the senior bonds that have been coming out. Given moderate duration of these
bonds, the yields seem quite attractive relative to other corporate bonds.

Best,
MC

Jurgis: AVP is a big holding for myself. I've acquired some in the past at a
prices higher than the current bid, but with some dollar cost averaging I'm in
the green. I'm fairly certain Avon will turn down the offer with some generic
phrase. We feel the offer doesn't fully represent the true LT value of Avon.

Frankly IMO it doesn't.

Why ,Three Words China & Brazil & Social media (Facebook)(on line parties &

Sure I'll take the money if Coty can convince them. I guess we will know if
Richmont really wants this company. Because if they do, there going to wait for
a response by the AVP board to the Coty Offer.

Both AVP & Coty are packaging customers of the company I work for, Yeah, Loreal
to. I can see at face value the synergies Coty can offer AVP. I have two

passed over for CEO of J&J. <G>
Yep, I know direct sales is different than retail and this is above average
risk here. Because we don't know what Sheri will do with the dividend.

Oracle's Brave New World
By MARK VEVERKA / Barrons April 28, 2012

Oracle's move into cloud-based software will enhance current offerings and
drive new sales. The shares could rise 10% —and possibly much more—in a year.

Mark Hurd has his head in the cloud.

Contrary to the steady jibes of competitors, the co-president of Oracle
(ticker: ORCL) says the global database giant is all over the latest trend of
delivering software over the Internet, variously known as software as a service
and cloud-based software.

"Software over the Internet is a big idea," he says, but "Larry has been on
this for a long time. It's deep in his DNA." Larry, of course, is Oracle
founder and CEO Larry Ellison. Indeed, Ellison has been preaching the virtues
of network computing since the early 1990s and is the co-founder and largest
holder of Netsuite (N), a leading cloud-based software company.

Co-president Mark Hurd says cloud-based software services are nothing new for
Oracle and its founder and CEO Larry Ellison. "It's deep in his DNA."

But that hasn't stopped rivals like SAP (SAP) and Salesforce.com (CRM) from
characterizing the company as out of touch in the brave new world of computing,
not least for its foray into high-end computer hardware through its 2010
acquisition of Sun Microsystems. And after Oracle canceled a speech by
Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff at its trade show in October, Benioff fired back,
"Sorry, Larry, the cloud can't be stopped."

Hurd's no shrinking violet. Having been pushed out as CEO of Hewlett-Packard
(HPQ) in August 2010, Ellison's friend and tennis partner was brought in at
Oracle just days later to run operations, strengthen customer relations—not
least by calling on the CEOs of large customers—and lead the company into the
cloud era.

Co-president Safra Catz leads the deal-making side of the business, which has
long been a driver of Oracle's growth.

And there's been plenty of that. Over the past five years, Oracle's net income,
earnings per share, and revenue have all grown at a 20% or better annual clip,
to an expected $11.3 billion, or $2.41 a share, on sales of $37.1 billion in
the fiscal year ending in May. Some 80% of that income is from annuity-like
annual maintenance contracts, providing ample cash for acquisitions and
internal growth. Free cash flow is expected to hit $12.5 billion this year.

Oracle's shares, which traded last week at $29, could move up 10% or more on
improving results and sentiment.

Hurd says the company is defending its worldwide core customer base of 380,000
by providing them with what they want and how they want it: private clouds,
on-premises clouds, public clouds, or a combination of all three. The company
is adding cloud-based software to its arsenal through homegrown products and
recent tuck-in acquisitions, including last October's $1.5 billion deal for
sales-automation software maker RightNow Technologies.

Already, Oracle is approaching $1 billion in cloud-based software revenue,
making it the second-largest provider, after Salesforce, which is nearing $3
billion. "Our cloud play is our entire portfolio," Hurd says.

Morgan Stanley software analyst Adam Holt concedes that software as a service
is the wave of the future, but says its success won't stunt growth of
traditional business applications for at least five years. "We are as bullish
on SaaS as anyone, but I think that companies can serve both markets," says
Holt. He predicts that corporate spending on both traditional enterprise
software and SaaS will grow despite an overall downturn in tech spending.
Corporate chief information officers have made a top priority of their need to
process, store, and analyze information, despite a spotty recovery.

Software as a service, Holt says, accounts for 10% of the $150 billion
enterprise-software market. That can climb to $180 billion in five years, with
the cloud-based piece more than doubling, to $36 billion, or 20% of the total.
Even with that, he says, non-SaaS revenue would still edge up—and continue to
provide Oracle with strong free cash flow.

ONE KNOCK ON THE COMPANY is that its pricey so-called hardware appliances are
out of step with ever-cheaper raw computing power. But Hurd argues IT managers
hate IT-integration costs, which makes Oracle's dedicated appliances more
attractive than they seem at first glance. Oracle's hardware has slim
operating-profit margins, but Hurd insists hardware profitability will
strengthen markedly in fiscal 2013, as Sun's lower-end servers are phased out.

The Bottom Line - Oracle's move into cloud-based software will enhance current
offerings and drive new sales, helping push the shares up 10% or more in a
year.

Another knock is that Oracle is missing out on Big Data Analytics—analyzing
"unstructured data," like digital images, e-mail, health-care records, and Web
pages. While Oracle's specialty has long been structured data, which is
organized in rows and columns, its new Exalytics appliance is specifically
designed for mining big data.

Exalytics is a direct response to SAP's HANA appliance, which some analysts
argue has superior technology.

Investors, not surprisingly, are infatuated with big data, a market that
research firm IDC predicts will grow fivefold, to $16.9 billion, by 2015.
Shares of Splunk (SPLK), for example, have more than doubled from their April
19 offering price, giving the company a market value of $3.4 billion, or 20
times this year's estimated revenue. Oracle, which earns more net profit in a
week than Splunk will produce in revenue this year, fetches just 12 times
fiscal 2012 estimates.

Holt forecasts Oracle will earn $2.92 a share in calendar 2013. At a modest
11.5 times that estimate, the shares would be worth $33. But if tech spending
rises more than expected, and if Oracle's hardware margins continue to improve,
he thinks EPS could reach $3.09. At a not particularly challenging P/E of 13,
the stock could rise to $40.

That's a good thing to hear. Frankly they had to address it because the
financing has the backing of some serious investors. They being the
Benckiser./Buffett connection. With them involved, IMO it wouldn't be hard to
find a consortium of banks or investment bankers to lend this deal through.
That's if, and a BIG <u>IF</u> , AVON agrees. Avon said they need a week. It is
possible they hire investment bankers and try and shop the company around for a
White Knight. Just a guess, but possibly someone like KKR that has experience
with big market cap companies. Coty did say they wanted a friendly deal. A big
? if they would pursue a hostile and take the offer to shareholders. Richmont
is a big unknown at this point. If they are truly serious interested in
buying.. They will have to wait in the wings for now, as they most likely would
have to line up some serious funding and leverage themselves to the hilt.

<u>Best case scenarios</u>. Avon accepts the Coty offer. The rumors of the past
were true. L'Oreal , P&G, UL are interested in this company. However,No way
that hypothetical offer would be close to one of today. Also It was a British
paper. Many witch are well known for spreading unfounded rumors.
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27756364
Still a chance Richmont or someone else come in with a surprise bid at some
point.
Remember-:Alticor Inc/Amway fail in 1989. IMO- Now their in a position of power
to try again. IMO most shareholders would tender Upon a reasonable offer this
time. It would be much better for shareholders, instead of waiting for a
turnaround.

<u>Worst case</u>-Avon rejects the bid, sighting a generic statement, and moves
on with Mrs. McCoy. If that happens I think AJ will be in charge of growing the
China business for the company. She has been with the company a long time and
did have some early success. China IMO has the most potential and Avon does
have a foot in the door. Shareholders also still don't know the outcome of the
bribe scandal.

<u>

FWIW past YH comments 6 months ago before a bid</u>

RE:My past thoughts on potential Fines

>Keys to takeover are, what's in it for them and why buy something with the
justice department issues not resolved.

Not when it's a hostile takeover. However golden parachutes apply. IMO I see a
possible suitor doing some DD and expecting a minimal fine.

As a percentage of total sales. Avon does very little sales in China now. I'm
guessing the fines could be comparable to the fines paid by TriWest Healthcare
Alliance ( 10 million). If I'm close to being right. I see it being a positive
for the stock. Link below. Of coarse I could be wrong.

<u>RE:Celebrity CEO regardless: Jung may eventually be removed. </u>

I agree, they just brought a new guy in from Unilever. He turned some of their
brands into blockbusters. He's now in charge of IMO of Avon's most important
divisions(Latin America )IMO maybe a possible successor?

For me anyway Avon is a buy. Not a strong buy, but a buy. I'm hoping the SEC
problem can get solved and Miss Jungs steps down. Both would be a positive
catalyst. Meanwhile I'll take the solid dividend for the wait even if it's a
long one.

I reiterate-IMO-Fundamentally I think the company is holding it own, and the
Latin American Market is a bright spot. I don't know how much longer Andra can
last. IMO her departure will be a positive catalyst for the stock. Who's knows,
she might look to sell the company for her legacy, on her hypothetical way out.
IMO Miss Jung is high maintenance in terms of her makeup. I wonder if she
actually just uses Avon products? If she does. She should do the late Dave
Thomas routine of staring in a company commercial. Andra, I'll use a takeoff of
the L'Or&#233;al Phrase. "ARE YOU WORTH IT"

high end and Unilever has already a distribution system in many emerging

fit, since they are already in direct marketing but they also have their own
troubles now, which might deter them or AVP.

I can see private equity jumping in since it seems to me that there is a lot
cost cutting potential. I can't see AJ hanging around, the new CEO has to make

As I stated, that was an unfounded rumor. However, As I did state below, UL

are just fair maybe. The China story might be like the one I saw for selling
COKE products in Africa. Someone takes the product to where the people can get

Herbalife Ltd. would also be a good fit, but once again they are small. IMO-
They would have to issue stock and get funding if interested.

Sergio,

Some BDCs survived the credit crisis well - ARCC, for example. But all their
stock prices got hit hard during the crisis. Even ARCC went from $16 to $4.
Since these are very credit sensitive companies, it is clear to me that you
don't want to own them going into a credit crisis. You may end up ok in the
end, but why hold something that could go down 50%+?

It would be better to buy the more solid ones in the midst of the credit
crisis, after they have gone down a lot.

REITs have some similarities with BDCs.....they may depend on credit to buy

remember a period in time when REITs were in the toilet.

Hi MCsweet. Is there risk in a BDC? Hell yea! But some points to consider when
evaluating risk and evaluating an individual BDC:

Not all BDCs are the same and historically, ARCC is an extreme example of what
could go wrong.

BDCs are less leveraged than banks as they must maintain a 1/1 debt to equity
ratio.

Not one BDC went bankrupt or received govt. bailout during the credit crises.
Consolidation solved the problem in the most part as the stronger BDCs
swallowed up the weaker ones.

Well managed BDCs have low debt ratio and/or the ability to raise cash by
issuing shares and have been doing so. An additional weapon in their arsenal is
taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance near term maturing debt
into longer term debt as several BDCs have been doing.

I don't think anyone should be 100% loaded in BDCs, but its worth a look in
this area to see if it fits your investment outlook and a portion of your
portfolio. I am currently invested in four BDCs.

From:tytthus
a big problem during the credit crisis for the BDC was mis-matched duration of
their debt and investments. most of their leverage came from rather short term
credit facilities, while their assets were multi-year (generally) investments.

most BDCs have been diversifying the liability side of their balance sheets
since 2009. adding preferred and convertible debt and longer term back and
unbacked debt. they wind up paying more than the credit facilities, but they'll
be caught less flat footed when the next crisis hits.

Sergio H,

I don't disagree with what you just said in your reply, but I don't see how you
are disproving my claim that BDCs are not good to own in a credit crsis.

In a credit crisis, basically all BDC stock prices will get hit. I can almost
guarantee it. BDCs are extremely credit sensitive -- they are making loans to
small companies at very high interest rates, and the market reflects that
accordingly. I didn't say they wouldn't weather the storm or that you can't
earn attractive returns over time despite a crisis, but why own them before
they go into freefall?

If you think a credit crisis is afoot, it is not time to be plowing money into
BDCs. That much is obvious to me.

They are probably good buys after a credit crisis hits, but I do not want to
own them if I expect a crisis is coming. And I don't see how ARCC is an example
of one gone wrong, it is probably one of the best run BDCs.

Right now, BDCs offer attractive returns in my view, but I wouldn't be loading
up because I think there is a non-zero chance of a credit crisis.

regains its footing. Did you see the huge insider purchase by John Hess? Credit
Suisse has a good report lowering the stock to neutral but expecting the
company to get back on track and for management to make some adjustments to
accomodate the delay in production, such as an asset sale or cost reduction
measures.

A new 52 wk low exceeding avg. volume by a large amount is a good technical
indicator signaling that everyone who wants to sell more or less has sold. You
are correct that today's volume increase was not large enough to signal that
sellers are exhausted but today's price also includes a gap. It opened and
closed at a lower price than yesterday's price activity.

I haven't looked at Wm% in a long time. Thanks for the refresher. Anyway, I

Hi Paul, sorry for the long delay in reply. Just checking back in on these
boards after several weeks.

re HITK. I'm still trying to understand how to best invest in the health
care/pharmaceutical industry and really have only had luck with health care
facilities/home health (like bottom fishing LHCG, AFAM, MDF) or buying weakness
in the really big names (like JNJ). The drug companies - whether it be generics
or patent protected cause me issues because I can't understand the science very
well or risk of competition. As I keep trying I begin to think a broad based
mutual fund sector approach for biotech/pharmaceuticals might be preferred (I
use one of Fidelity's sector funds, but I know alot of folks like some sector
CEFs and/or ETFs out there also).

HITK hit my stop, so I'm currently out, but If I recall the drop in HITK had to
do initially with another generic firm getting FDA approval to produce
Fluticasone (allergy sinus medicine), and the concern was this would eat into
revenue and margins. I think HITK was the only generic producer of that popular
sinus spray prior to that. To what degree that has played out in the
marketplace I haven't followed (wish I knew a pharmacist to bounce some of this
stuff off of). (I don't see forward earnings estimates adjustments yet but
those expectations have to be pushing stock down.) But then again I see reports
of HITK seeking approval for other generics on a regular basis also. We see
stories of all the big name drugs coming off of patent and it makes me think
these generic producers are going to have alot of new product coming down the
pipeline and some of those are likely to be producable by the generic makers.

On net I don't know where that leaves me but I still take stabs in the drug
area every once in a while - but I'm beginning to think I might need to treat
the pharmaceuticals more like cyclicals - expecting significant bumps in the
road along the way - and finding companies I like to be ready to buy on the
bumps. HITK still scores very well using the Greenblatt methods - it's #15 on
both of my Greenblatt inspired ranking systems right now. I don't think it
ranks quite as high on the official Magic Formula website, but it'll still show
up there. I know technicals are discouraged here, but I could easily see myself
back in HITK when the technicals improve (ie it stops dropping).

- downside seems limited (alot of metrics seem very low to me)
- it feels like the market is getting a little oversold,
- Microsoft earnings were good which could feed into Dell (admittedly
conflicting signals out there though)
- buzz around ultrabooks is a positive
- I think it should trade for at least $17/18, and could easily reach $20+ or
more based on eps estimates and getting back to a more historical 10x multiple
(currently it's at 8.2 multiple). The combination of limited downside vs.
potential upside, along w/ what seems to me high % chances of PE expansion to a
more historical level of at least 10x within 6-12mo seems a good bet. This is a

Maybe A. the psychological effect of buying a $500. stock that was $300. not

Maybe B. despite the real valuation which is still extremely low considering
their growth, there is a psychological concern that "may" at some point become
real, which is that AAPL lost it's future growth when it lost Steve Jobs, and
once his pipeline is diminished, what's coming?

Maybe C. It is one of the most over-owned stocks by mutual funds, considered a

If it had more Oil exposure it would be up on my list. With 94% gas then I am
not interested either. There are other NG plays with better assets (like XCO)
that provide a small level of safety (ie their 51% interest in TGGT LLC). AAV
has none and w/ so much exposure to NG, the risk/reward is just not there for
me.

I do like the region and own several other companies in that area but they have
70% or more oil exposure and/or pipeline interests.

Most likely,because the layer firms will come out to shareholders and say that
the company did not exercise their fiduciary duties responsibly by engaging in
talks before the deadline. There was a timetable involved and they did not
engage in talks. As a shareholder myself. I have to ask myself why didn't they
engage and just reject the offer after talks. This if they felt the bid didn't
reflect the true value of the company LT. You also have to remember Coty put in
a bid before that was rejected so AVP did have time to think a defensive
strategy. Why 7 days? I made a thought known to some extent in a previous

discount to regular shares. The voting rights don't matter, since the Quand

Thank you. I was thinking of buying the preferred but could not figure out the

the symbol they use on either site, so I settled for the common. I will have to
call them to make the trade when I sell something else.

I bailed out on HES. It has been following daily patterns for XOM and CVX but
when buying in the energy sector fails to kick in, HES has taken a deeper hit

barges/push boats: ULTR. Waiting to read quarterly. I'm not happy with the

Company should continue to do a good business from transporting for export, the
chemicals which are produced from USA's natural gas glut. I hope this is not
yet all reflected in the current stock price.

“Kirby is completely unique in the public market as a way for investors to play
the comparative advantage in U.S. natural gas prices,” said Jonathan Chappell,

Feels like the sky is falling. CLF has not been a wise short term investment,

NEE (Paul and I)
COR (discussed plenty. Paul and EKS closed positions. I recently sold some more
that went LT, and have more that I bought in sept/oct that I have to wait a few

Added shares to my current holdings. Was looking to add some ERF but stock
continues to sell off. Still trying to add more Oil shares as crude remains at
a YTD low of $93.16 off -1.17% today. DNR is getting close to my buy zone as
well as SU.

Also many of the coal stock sold off as much as 6% so I have my eyes on CLF and

MHR broke below $4.00 for a small time today. Will be adding to this one if it
breaks below $3.50/share. NG stocks continued to sell off too. I was also
looking to add some XCO shares but held off waiting for something in the low

Rich - thats an interesting theory and good thought process. I am not
disagreeing. However, Have you taken a look at company bylaws and what kind of
power it gives to the board of directors? Also, The CEO will make a lot of
money if there is a change of control - DESPITE that, they did not sell.

So i agree - the question indeed is why! why did they not sell? However, will
it bring litigation is a big question. And if there is heavy litigation, what
are the possible outcomes? Coty is prob. not coming back. so as a shareholder,
you lose either way.

Do they have a counter offer on the table? I think thats the question that is
worth asking. I don;t think you should focus so much on the legal issues, but
about why this happened? Am sure board must have thought about potential
litigation......unless they go back to coty. If they do, I believe buffett
being buffett, they might not get the same offer.Besides you cannot force them
to sell, if they have a reason not to.

Re: Tesco PLC (TSCDY.PK) - Closed position for small gain
Aurcana Corporation (AUNFF.PK) - Started tracking position

Collected my TSCDY dividend and booked my small gain. With all the issues in
Europe and an IMF $3.8B bond refunding coming due Friday May 18th, I felt it
was easier to close the position and look to re-enter at a later date. I
believe I can buy this one at a lower price (below $15.00).

In the interim, I "rented" SVU @ $5.11/share today for a "value swing trade",
will collect the dividend next week and feel comfortable to sell the stock on
any move back to $6.00.

/subject.aspx?subjectid=58391 is a small profitable silver mine on the border
of Texas and Mexico. Company has been building out one of their mines and
should be in full production soon. Cost of production is less that $10.00/oz
too. I posted some info up thread and SI also has it own thread. The stock
finally came down to my entry price of $0.78/share so my GTC order filled for
me today. This is a "pure" silver play that will complement my other natural
resource stocks.

Hi Nikh -

On this lot of SVU it is a "Value Swing Trade", which means short term 2-3
months. I collect the dividend, allows me to lower my cost basis on my current
holdings by holding 30 days and will sell off some high priced shares on any
move above $6.00/share.

For me, it's a Low risk/High reward. I still maintain my long term position
if/when any sustained move higher in the stock, but also provides me the
flexibility to sell high priced shares (after 30 days) and book a loss to
offset other gains. In this 30day window I collect a dividend too.

I really want to deploy these funds into TSCDY (Tesco) but w/ all the issues in
Europe, I am parking the money in SVU (for reasons explained above) and move
back into TSCDY in 30 or more days and at a price less than $15.00/share. I did
book a small gain in my TSCDY I sold today.

At least that's the strategy but it really only works best for my situation.

Bocor, excellent points!

Actually I was invested in a gadget company Garmin GRMN back in their high

can change far before the business metrics begin to reflect it.

There is also an element of game theory going on with AAPL also I think... I've
been largely out of sync with the movements in the AAPL stock - it seems to
move with a mind of it's own that I don't understand. It seems to have more
momentum in both the up and down directions than other stocks - big wild
swings. I could be wrong, but it just feels more dangerous than most of my

The preferred in Germany typically have an extra "3" number - so BMW.DE has a
BMW3.DE "preferred". "Preferred" in Europe means something differently than in
the US, in Europe it means a share without voting right, sort of like a "B"
share in the US. They typically pay a slightly higher dividend in in most cases
they don't trade in the Pink sheets in the US at all, you need to buy them
directly in Europe.

FWIW, I just bought KSB3.DE @417.25$ today ( bought and sold KSB.DE a short
while ago). The preferred trades at ~10% discount to the voting shares in this
case, which is less than with BMW.DE

KSB is a pump manufacturer in Germany that trades at fairly cheap metrics, has
very good balances sheet with net cash, PE around 10 and a 12Euro dividend
coming soon. They are controlled by a family holding, so I think having voting
rights is not buying you much:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=KSB3.DE+Key+Statistics

Pretty good summary here:
http://www.gurufocus.com/news/159394/ksb--significantly-undervalued-midcap-from
germany

KSB has preannounced earnings to go up 10% to around 45-47Euro/share in 2012,
which still would be below peak profit levels of ~60Euros/share. Peers in the
US are XYL and in Europe Sulzer (the latter being in several business but pumps
are the largest), just looking at an "unfiltered EV/EBITDA ratio, both trade at
a >2x premium to KSB.DE/KBB3.DE.

No- I feel I have no need to, because what was most important was that the
slate of directors was re-elected by the major shareholders. Even AVP's former
CEO was surprised, that AJ was re-elected, so was I.

IMO-Understanding Bylaws is more suited for the Martin Marietta/ Vulcan
Materials mess.

Believe me, I'm waiting to hear AVP's response. I've already made reference to
some of your AVP ? points. Clownbuck also made a good point. If Coty really
wanted AVP. Why wouldn't they wait 7 days?

I have been buying more of SVU. The sell-off was kind of expected with it
leaving the S&P500 index and firms were required to sell. Also, general market
sell-off. This one is selling at ten year lows p/cf, p/s etc. and business is
not that bad. Looking at operating cycle this is not going bankrupt.

FWIW, also buying more of BTU
GM - tons of cash, pinned-up demand. Con -pension shortfall, but I am not to

will remain with the co forever. This co is not going away.
DE - I use to work for this company and it is well managed. The changes they
made in the late 80's through the 90s made it a efficient that anyone could run
this company. Also, there is a need for more food globally, hence more farming.
