John: Early book review.....Buffettology.....Chs 1-10.......

Without being too indelicate, I must say that the early reading has been
somewhat of a bore.

Though, as a stockbroker, I may be somewhat prejudiced and disinclined to view
Mary Buffett in a good light in view of her attitude toward my profession. She
spends a chapter or two (of ten so far) embarking on a diatribe against all
brokers and feeding the stereotype that currently exists in the public's eyes
of the broker as a fast talker disregarding the client's objectives in favor of
other conflicting interests of sales commissions. It is a sweeping indictment
of the profession without disclaimer as to the individuals in the profession.
Having gotten that off my chest, she is in a constant begging-for-forgiveness
mode to the reader who may be versed in basic security analysis. This is
appropriate since the book is meant for all levels of expertise and she must
start at ground zero to build her case.

One interesting tidbit thrown up by Mary is a quote from Ben Graham that, "in
general, the market undervalues a litigated claim as an asset and overvalues it
as a liability. Hence, students of these situations often have an opportunity
to buy into them at less than their true value, and to realize attractive
profits--on the average--when the litigation is disposed of."
This was brought up in the context of the underperformance of RJR's stock
performance in the '80s prior to the KKR LBO.

Someone mentioned Michael Price and Columbia Health Care. I suspect that this
gem from Graham is a driver of Price's interest in the company.

Anyway, I DO still look forward to the latter part of the book when hard
numbers from Buffett valuations are discussed.

The discussion of Graham and Buffett type history of earnings, projected future

AlLe: Value 'em same way you approach a porcupine. Very carefully.
I like to look for substantial co's when the pc cycle (that's property casualty
-g- different from IBM PC) is against them. Long-lived companies
-geographically dispersed and with lots of employees.
Problem with midsize or small co's is that they either don't know their
business well enough to price their policies or else they get greedy or
something and purposely price low to bring in business. This eventually bites
them and their stockholders. Big co's usually don't get this carried away (but
they can invest their surplus in things they're not expert in -- like real
estate). Try to hold for a long time - they grow slow but they can be
profitable, although there is a strong opinion that competition is so severe,
it's made profits non existent. I've not found any big insurance co's that I
like at today's prices. For small and medium size co's, try to buy at book or
maybe 1.5X. Combined Ratio staying under 100% is a good sign too.
Also...sigh... you should diversify among several. (Aside to thread: Please. No
more about diworseifcation--I just bot even more stocks and another insurance
co. today!) I own a few co's spread out in pc, life, and auto. Also, you
probably should not take my advice: One of the insurance stocks I purchased

Senor,

Thanks so much for your thoughts - very good ones and I'll take them to hearts.
I looked at it more and more and from what's available, I find one fault with
it. There are 2.09 million shares outstanding, but the float is only 200,000
shares. Should liquidity be discounted here? I think so, but I'm not sure. I've
not had the time to call to talk to the company and I don't know if they are
willing to talk if they and other insiders control so much of the stock. The
return on assets and return on equity look really good.

I have one other question. What is the definition of Combined Ratio? Lot of

AlLe: more on MOTR and combined ratio:

Combined ratio found in annual reports. Essentially it is the total in
percentage terms of losses (claims paid) + underwriting expenses. Most annual
reports will show definition so you can understand more clearly than my
response here. 1 minus combined ratio = underwriting profit. Many insurance
don't have an underwriting profit -- they run from surplus account(s). A
combined ratio under 100 is a good sign.
I checked quickly again MOTR on Yahoo. 36% ROE. This is either an incorrect
figure or a number not sustainable IMO. IMO this is a warning sign ---it is not
possible to have such good returns in this business - it's just too competitive
in all markets, including niche. That's IMO. Show me where I'm wrong and I'll
buy the stock -g-. Paul Senior

1) Strong balance sheet
2) No debt
3) Generates good excess cash flow
4) Outstanding management
5) Talks of new services coming soon to increase revenues significantly
6) Infrastructure in place, all additional revenues go straight to their bottom

7) Serious talk of a share buyback
8) They save HMOs significant money, and at the same time achieve a high degree

9) Matria Healthcare is the leader in maternal management services

Paul,
Your response made me smile, I know what you mean.

A "quick glance" might not reveal that things are about to change significantly
at Matria Healthcare. I sense that the former "talk only" posture of the
conservative former board of directors is changing, and good things are about
to happen!
A quick glance might not have revealed that Matria Healthcare recently
announced a major very favorable board restructuring. The remaining board
(company veterans) are very much in favor of a share buyback program with
Matria's cash position. In fact, they will actually invite an investment bank
to their February board meeting to advise them on a share buyback program! (
BTW, Matria generates good excess cash flow, so the share buyback program could
be significant!)
A second development that will change things significantly for MATR is
additional revenues from the introduction of new products and services. Matria
is working "extremely well" with one of the world's top manufacturers of health
care products to market their new drug. This should begin in the first half of
next year. Because Matria is a lean mean fighting machine, top line growth goes
straight to bottom line profits!
The thing I really like about Matria is that the story is brand new. Not one
elevator operator has told me to buy Matria! IMHO This is the time to load up,
so when "mainstreet" discovers this stock, we can sell it to that poor elevator
operator! (;-)

BTW, I formed my opinion from talking to Matria. Other analysts are beginning
to form their opinions too.

For example:
Cruttenden Roth
The Red Chip Revue
H.D. Brous & Co.
Morgan Keegan & Co.

Please join me on the MATRIA HEALTHCARE (MATR) thread if you'd like to chat.

Re: HYDEA

It's just an illiquid stock in the hands of marketmakers,
so short-term movements mean nothing. There was a lot
of buying down at 4, so I think we have good downside
protection.

This is the "realization of value" problem defined. Buying
at a discount to intrinsic value implies the stock will
move up to intrinsic value in a reasonable period of time.
Graham wanted a 50% gain within two years. I bought at 4,
am looking for 6 within two years. With any luck, management
will get it together and it'll do better.

St. Joe Corp. A classic value investment which I have been unable to get
anybody interested in on this board, though I have tried numerous times. This
stock is 20% of my portfolio. It is a pure asset play. They own 3% of the land
in Florida and are just starting to do something with it. No earnings yet, no
analyst coverage yet...but they've got the management team and the strategy has
come together. If you spend two hours looking at the press releases since May
of 1996 you will be fascinated, I guarantee you. If you do that much and e-mail
me privately, I will be happy to send you a formal asset valuation. (Actually,
if you have access to the Motley Fool on AOL its all posted there in realtime)

Anyway, the stock has had a run. I'm pretty happy. The reason I post this now
is that their bid for Florida East Coast (FEC) just blew up. It was announced
after the bell today. FEC will tank on Monday. The bid was for 102, but the
stock was trading for 110 because everybody was certain SJP would sweeten it.
There were lots of speculators, in other words. FEC will tank on Monday I
think. I would advise you to research it this weekend because Monday's price
could be very irrational. I think its worth well over 100, but be greedy - look
for 80. Its kind of a sister company to FEC. The valuation technique is pretty
similar.

And St. Joe too could be fun on Monday. I think it may drop hard too for a very
stupid reason (refusing to overpay for an acquisition) and I still think it is
significantly undervalued. In other words, we might get a second bite at the
apple. I refuse to put a number on it, but what I say is this. I know real
estate. The company is worth $100 a share conservatively. Actually very
conservatively. I valued it at 100 when I bougt at 65. That was before they
hired credible management. And before they had a strategic plan. I figure if
the assets are worth $100 or more, the assets plus excellent management and a
strategic plan are worth far more than that. The stock trades at 93 and I think
it will drop (for a stupid reason) on Monday. If you can buy this at 85 you
won't regret it 3 years from now. I don't know if we will see 85, but if it
does, you'll want to have your research done. (This is how much I believe in
this company. It is 20% of my portfolio, but I WANT it to drop another 10% so I
can buy - steal? - more shares. Hell, I' love it if it went to 10! I would sell
the cat, mortgage the TV (I don't own a house) and beg on the street to raise
cash to buy more!

If any of you have access to AOL's Motley Fool, there is an excellent message
board on SJP. Give yourself two hours and you will thoroughly understand the
history and investment rationale for this stock.

***OFF TOPIC*** (somewhat)
John: You wrote......
<< I can concur with Mary's assessment of brokers,>>>

In the first few years of a broker's career there is a tremendous amount of
canvassing for new accounts to become "established". After one is "established"
there is further pressure (mostly self-induced) to better the prior year's
earnings.
This can (it does not "always") create an environment for a quick sale.
Enter the typical investor with a moderate degree of investment knowledge.
He(she) intuitively believes that a good broker's investments never go down in
value as long as the market holds up.
In short, most people look for the short-cut to riches in the stock market and
some believe that the market will replace the need to work at some point early
in their lives.
Now, with these profiles on either side of the phone, do you think that the
typical investor initiating a relationship with a broker is going to have the
patience to be involved in a stock such as HYDEA (extreme example, yet a value
story)? The broker knows that the relationship will be short-lived if
performance does not take place quickly. So, the broker takes the path of least
resistance and tries to make a quick buck for his client in an issue that may
entail more risk than is necessary compared to his approach for another
individual client who would be more wizened to the movements of market forces.

The solution to the above scenario is for the broker to take the hard-line and
strongly insist that the client's intuitions are counter to fulfilling his
ultimate objectives. In some cases, a "beating up" on day-1 is necessary. But
the path of least resistance seems to be what ultimately destroys the
relationship.
Another solution is to quote the words of the masters such as Lynch, Buffett,
and Graham so the client is prepared to deal with adversity when it arrives. My
personal solution to newbie customers is to hand out a copy of pages 286-287 of
Ben Graham's "The Intelligent Investor". It's a dangerous solution from a new
broker-relationship standpoint yet solid for the long term disciplines of the
prospective client because Graham says things like the following on these
pages:

A second business principle: "Do not let anyone else run your business unless
(1) you can supervise his performance with adequate
care and comprehension or (2) you have unusually strong reasons for placing
implicit confidence in his integrity and ability.

The "comprehension" thing is the rub. It takes effort to comprehend and not
everyone wants to take on that responsibility. That is the investor's path of
least resistance.

worse shape. How difficult it is to put the needs of the client first when you
need a sale. My experience is that in the long run, your ability to keep loyal
clients and reap referrals is in large measure dependent on your willingness to
follow Ben Feldman's approach. . .do for the client what you would do for
yourself if you were in his shoes, knowing what you know.

Ispat International, a company I brought up quite a few

Bill Nasgovitz, the Heartland Value fund manager who

I myself have not been able to see or get comfortable with, the stock

James: 20% and adding to position? Wild guy.

What method are you using here? It can't be Graham because you're way too
concentrated even if the fundamental case is impeccable. If it's Buffett, then
I have no clue as to what Buffett technique could apply. Surely this is not a
stock Buffett would buy and put away for 10 years. Surely this is not a company
around which one could build a moat. An easily understandable business? Seems
like a poor business with fair-to-middling mgmt. Or if it's the major owner-
who is a trader/player? - then I wonder what kind of relationship Mr. Buffett
would have with this guy. If it's a company about which you have personal
knowledge - like you know the mgmt or work for the co. - I've not seen any
indication of that in your posts.
I think your cat and your mother should gang up on you for putting 20% of your
portfolio into WHX -g-. Of course, you've been right in the past, and I offer
that your record for winners is better than mine, and you are making the big
gains, so I'm not disputing your choice of WHX. Still, to someone standing back

At less than 50% of very real book value, I think WHX offers as large a margin
of safety as you are going to find today. This company is going to earn money
next year. Now much, I don't know, but they showed the ability in the past to
earn in the $2 range WITH A LESS FAVORABLE LABOR CONTRACT AND 25% MORE SHARES
OUTSTANDING! Sure, they're not going to do that consistently, but Buffett tells
a story which I think was originally his professor's (Graham). Goes like this.

A man visits the vet with an ailing horse. "Can you help me? Sometimes my horse
walks fine and sometimes he limps." The vet's reply was pointed. "No problem -
when he's walking just fine, sell him."

No, I have no intention of holding this stock for ten years. Does one have to
be Graham or Buffett or can we learn ideas from both of them? I have a couple
Buffett type investments which I intend to hold for a while, but I also find
the occasional no-brainer Graham idea which I am willing to bet big on.

<< at less than 50% of very real book value >>

I just took a look at latest 10Q balance sheet. It looks like well over 100% of
book value is in fixed assets. I have no idea what used steel plants are going
for these days, but years ago when there was too much capacity they were not
worth much. Also commodity producers
do and should carry low P/E's on earnings. Be careful.

As an example, I own some shares of CALM, the largest company in the country in
the commodity business of egg production. It is "laying" there at less than 5
times last fiscal year earnings, and maybe 5-7
times current fiscal year earnings - probably flat or down - and
nobody wants it.

James: WHX. Okay bv is real per your analysis. Yet,stock has sold for 1/2 book
value (on avg) 6 of past 7 years. One year it sold at bv. Okay, sell when horse

Each time pe was (avg) at 5. My point is: based on past averages, stock is
about where it has been and regardless, not worth putting 20% of portfolio on.
Your point is that it will trade above averages and when it does walk, you'll
sell. If it does then you've gone on - learned from and built upon what Graham
says. My point is that Graham says - in Everything I've read about how he
operates - you should buy a package of these type stocks. Now if/when WHX moves

Re: WHX

Just to make a disclosure, I recently bought a small
position, but rather immmediately turned around and sold it upon
further investigation and the release of the 10Q.

I am worried about:

Debt load - the company is actually borrowing the
money to buy back shares, and the debt load is getting
up there. With equity down to 500 million from
over 700 million, the debt/equity is getting up there.
If you include the pension and employee liabilities
and the fact you've got renegotiate in 5 years, I
worry about being too leveraged. All that cash is
great, but it is largely offset now by debt. Is it
getting more than a 9% return on its cash? I'm
confused here.

Business economics - The company may make anywhere
from $1-$2.50/year in the next few years, but the
uncertainty is very high. I am not knowledgeable
enough to know how quickly and how well WHX can
reclaim its old business. My understanding is that
the low-cost producer will do better than others,
but everyone will suffer from industry overcapacity
over the next year or two. Do the employee reductions and
benefit reductions make WHX a very low cost producer?
And does it make sense for WHX to leverage itself
so much going into a cyclical industry that may be
turning down?

I think this stock was a screaming buy down at
$5 1/2 - $7, a good buy at $9-10, and now has
the potential to go up to the $20 range. But I agree
now with Paul that the margin of safety is hard
to see. The book value seems real enough.

I must say that I have been influenced to a large
degree by my recent intense study of Buffett and
Phil Fisher, so the steel business in general
is not appealing to me. I pulled the plug on
several stocks that don't make as much sense to
me now, and WHX is one of them.

Good Investing,

I don't like valuing fixed assets either, especially in an industry like steel

large before the strike. Combine that with the new labor contract, and these
fixed assets should be worth more than the average steel assets (which trade at
about 1.2 times book)

Thanks for your comments on the P/E history on this one. I've seen the charts,

And what you said about even if I hit this one, you will still say something

More info on CALM:

IPO at $7.00 about a year ago - no sponsorship or big firm coverage, which is a
bit surprising for a $300 million company which is major factor in fragmented
industry.

Book value of $5.50. No good will. Has a controlling shareholder.
$35 million untapped bank line of credit. Debt on balance sheet is largely
insurance company financing or municipality type stuff. (I am
always impressed to see insurance companies in there with private placements -
they are the true debt financing experts.)

I think earnings this fiscal year ending 5/31/98 will be between $.75 and
$1.25, down from about $1.20 last year. I have heard some analyst say between
$1.00 and 1.40. I believe that for their current operation
the commodity cycle earnings range is between a little below zero and
$2.00 per share.

They have been acquiring companies that fit into their territory and building
new facilities for years - so recent stuff is not new. Company goal is to be
something like triple the size in 5 years or so
as they continue what they are doing. NOTE - They typically pay book for the
companies they buy which is why they have no good will. And that is about what
they sell for themselves. However, a large player has all sorts of advantages,
including access to reasonable cost financing and efficient distribution, that
warrants a higher price. They believe that as the industry rationalizes -
getting rid of mom-and-pop farms the cyclical swings will be less.

Industry growth is minor, at this time. Competitors are mostly the type of
farms they have been buying. The public company with the largest % of sales as
egg operation is MIKL (about 1/2).

Company has been around a long time and longtime mgmt. My opinion is and has
been that this will eventually be a much larger company with double the
earnings and double the P/E, as it gets recognized --> 4 times the price. So
far I have been wrong. But as Buffett says about his not caring if Wall Street
closes down for 6 months, I do not follow this stock daily or spend any time
worrying about it. It certainly is not a stock for the impatient.

I suggest you go read the latest 10Q for CALM and MIKL, and lets discuss
further.

Quant View: A Look at a Winning Formula
By Ted Murphy
Special to TheStreet.com
11/28/97 12:57 PM ET

What if I told you there is a strategy that always works,
returning relative outperformance of +45.3% a year during a
10-year backtested period? Well, there is.

Not to keep you in suspense, it's the strategy of buying
stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios based on next year's
actual reported earnings. I know. That's a tough trick to pull
off.

In a study I did 10 years ago, using historical data from 1976
to 1987, I found that buying the lowest P/E decile of stocks
using next year's actual reported earnings returned an
average of 44.3% a year, versus an average of -1.0% a year
for purchasing stocks in the highest, most expensive P/E
decile.

For me, this backtest explains the rules of the game played
by many institutional investors and analysts. If you are
successful in projecting the next one or two years in actual
earnings, you can consistently and significantly outperform
the market and your peers by buying stocks that are cheap
on your projected earnings.

Surprisingly Cheap Stocks Were the Best

The study also showed that the real payoff came when the
company surprised investors, posting stronger than
expected earnings.

Buying low P/E stocks using the current consensus wasn't
nearly as successful as perfect foresight. The spread
between purchasing the top versus bottom P/E deciles
based on the consensus estimate of the next year's
earnings was only 5.3% in this study, versus 45.3% for the
spread based on actual earnings.

Low P/E Using Perfect Foresight vs.
Consensus Estimates
Annualized returns, quarterly observations from 1976 to
1987

Spread
Actual EPS (+1Yr)
44.3
-1.0
+45.3
Estimated EPS (+1Yr)
24.1
18.8
+5.3

No Need for Home Runs

The study continued by looking closely at the group of
unexpectedly cheap stocks, the companies that ended up
cheap because earnings grew rapidly and above consensus.
This unexpectedly cheap group made up 39% of the
companies in the lowest price-to-earnings decile.

The return of these surprisingly cheap stocks was 62.7%,
even better than the 44.3% return for the entire decile of
stocks that were cheap on reported earnings.

So how do we find these unexpectedly cheap stocks?

It is important to note that only 20% of this key
outperforming group were home-run stocks that started from
an extremely low earnings base and then exploded upwards.
The vast majority of this special group of stocks -- 80% --
were starting from P/E multiples already below the market
median, in P/E deciles 2 through 5.

My conclusion at that time, with which I still feel
comfortable, was that the most attractive group of stocks
were those selling at a below-market multiple where
earnings came through above expectations, turning a
moderately priced stock into a winner.

I think there is a lesson to be learned from Ray's points - If you are looking
at two stocks which are nearly identical in every way, then you should closely
examine the expected probability of deviation from the future earnings
estimates. I have seen lots of so-called growth companies selling at low
multiples of next year's projected earnings where I have gotten burned because
I did not properly consider the chances of them missing the estimates.

In particular, all commodity type businesses, whether it be steel, eggs, disk
drives or semiconductors have a much greater chance of not hitting earnings
estimates than other companies, which is often not reflected in the P/E.

Re: PE

IMO, PE's are bashed too much by most of us value
investors and praised too highly by those in the
momentum/ <1 year camp.

My biggest use for the PE is to look at historic
ranges once I've already checked out that the
PE is valid, i.e. no tricks in the income statement
or balance sheet.

After all, the market does like the PE as a tool,
and keeps most stocks in their historical range
year-in year out. If I'm on the fence, and the
stock is at the lower end of its 10 year PE range,
it helps to know this.

Jeffrey Bash: okay. That could be good learning/advice. Looking at earnings
predictions as a range, not point estimate. Mathematically combining each range
provided by each analyst to get an overall deviation from the average estimate.
(maybe even ignoring autocorrelation -- which others might not know is a big
word for: them analysts sometimes do have a tendency to stick together in their
projections -g-) People can maybe get this range from ZACKs?? I don't know - I
don't do this -- because I figure it this way:
1. Analysts are good at predicting prices for most stocks. (Just go with me on
this,)
2. The stocks I buy are always the stocks that analysts are not good at
predicting prices for. (Just go with me on this too.)
3. Therefore, if I rely on any analyst predictions, I will hurt myself.
4. Consequently I do not rely on any analysts' predictions of future earnings
numbers. Not ever. I also try not to look at ACE numbers. This is hard for me
because I'm just a little curious too and want some affirmation that my pick is
a good one.
Now as an example, take APM (please -g-). Haven't a clue what earnings will be
next year -- down sharply I guess from all the disk drive problems. But in year
'99 or '00, I figure these problems will be behind them, and profits, earnings
and stock price will all be higher. Didn't and don't need to know analyst
earnings projections to determine buy, hold, or sell. Considering APM
risk/reward, price/value... if I knew Latin, I'd say "the thing speaks for

But I have a better idea. I bet your "backtest" would show that stocks trading
at a low multiple to next year's share price will outperform even more! Imagine
that - all you have to do is know next year's share price and you can
outperform the market. That sounds easy. (before you start running the test,
this is sarcasm)

The idea of a backtest is to test real time information, not information that
you will only know when the price is already up. Spend your time figuring out
how to predict next year's earnings, because your backtest is not worth the

Jeffrey Bash, et. al., more on MIKL (CALM)

Here's what I'm seeing. MIKL, a large eqg producer also, has a different
strategy from CALM. MIKL is transitioning to "value-added egg products" - shelf
life liquid eggs, for example. They have an exclusive patent, they say, on the
technology used to create this stuff. This is now 40% of their egg business. To
get more access to shell eggs, they bought, this year, "Papetti's" for $83M in
stock and cash, which "exceeded the fair value of assets by $63M." (They bought
this shell egg producer at 4X book looks like.)

CALM is looking for lower earnings next year. This year's had a positive
confluence of major factors - strong spot price demand and lower feed costs.
Regarding next year, CALM notes the maybe not so favorable factor of El Nino on
their raw material costs. According to MIKL, feed costs are 2/3 of egg
production costs. (I assume that's of fully burdened cost.)

Some items I am still mulling over: The president of CALM sold a bunch of
shares at time of the offering. Coupled with previous poster noting continued
insider sales -- I don't like that. However, we're talking about a small
(relatively IMO) company here, so I can see some of these farmer? executives
trying to diversify. Also, CALM is structured as a family farm for tax
purposes. I don't know what that means (other than they have deferred taxes
that are affected if there are some changes to family farm status). (Aside: if
I buy this stock I become part of a family farm? Hey, I could be part of
Jeffrey Bash and maybe James Clarke and other value players' family! That would
be an interesting family.)

Regarding competition, I want to think what the affect of having "extended
shelf liquid whole eggs" means. When shell egg prices are low MIKL just builds
to stock at grocery store distn. centers.?? There's no more spoilage to worry
about. (I've seen one version in restaurants where they just pop open a
paint-can size container to make their customer orders for omelettes, over
mediums, etc. Very smooth, efficienct (saved steps), no disposal of shells).
And what about Mexico? Labor costs lower, I assume. Environmental disposal is
much easier and less costly I assume too. (And of course, that is a big item
with chickens -g-). So where is that Mexican competition. Barriers to entry
aren't that great (I've always thought that in the chicken business - which is
maybe diff. from egg biz. - that you can do okay with less than 11 chickens or
more than 50,000. Anything in between and you go bust.) Shouldn't be a problem
for Mexico guys to get a couple of orders from groceries in SW USA and
routinely truck the eggs to the USA. (Easy to think, but maybe not so easy to
actually do??). And if there is access to extended-life technology, there's not
a spoilage problem.

HOWEVER, all that spinning aside, the basic numbers look pretty good. It's a
commodity product all right, but CALM can make money when times are good, they
look like they're well capitalized and know their business. CALM, at 6+ is
roughly 20% over book; a large competitor got taken out recently at 4x -- some
indication of what the business could be (MAYBE) worth to an acquirer. Long
term, as Jeffrey Bash points out, price of the stock should move up. I like
what I see on the CALM numbers. MIKL - that's a different story. Looks way
overpriced to me.

Give me some feedback. Paul.

I somewhat share your concern. However, this is the first chance these guys

From:jeffbas

I agree MIKL seems relatively quite overpriced. Note that I sent a letter a
while ago to MIKL CEO (not expecting a response, which I did not get)
suggesting that he could pay a 50% premium in stock for CALM and make a smart
deal for his shareholders.

2/3 of costs = grain is too high. IPO prospectus shows the following breakdown
of CALM costs, in cents per dozen eggs, for FY 6/1/96 (8 years shown):

feed cost - 26.6 cents
hen amortization and mortality - 7.2
facilities and other farm costs - 8.9
purchases, processing, distribution, SG&A - 22.6
TOTAL - 65.3 cents
Average Selling Price - 68.4
Profit - 3.1 cents

Feed costs were not over 50% in any of the 8 years. I might add that I am not
sure that CALM thinks they make the highest margins when feed costs are low,
because there is no pressure on marginal production, and egg prices tend to be
low as well. CEO Adams would be a better person to talk to about this point,
and your interesting point about Mexican production. But these "farms" are
really much more automated than in the old days where the farmer's kids go
collect the eggs in the morning :-)

Switch from family farm tax status, per prospectus comment, would cost them
nothing in reported earnings ("as these taxes have been accrued and are
reflected on the Company's balance sheet") but $3.1
million in cash.

I certainly agree that value added makes sense but, as you point out,
MIKL paid a good price for a producer. (What price did they pay on a price to
sales basis vs. CALM?)

My view is that if you have nothing better to do with the money, and if CALM is
not too far above book, it is an interesting long term investment for the
patient. (I found the growth reference I was looking for - a year ago they said
they had 7 1/2 to 8% market share
of US egg industry and their business plan was to increase market share to
20-25% over five years.)

Jeffrey B.: re CALM, MIKL

Nuts. Need some help clarifying exact price MIKL paid. Wording is:
"On February 26, 1997, the Company completed the acquisition of Papetti's
Hygrade Egg Products, Inc. and affiliated entities (collectively
"Papetti's")... Total consideration of $83,174,000, together with the
assumption of $22,825,000 of notes payable and long-term debt, was delivered
through the issuance of 3,195,455 shares of newly issued common stock valued at
$38,859,000, and $44,315,000 in cash and closing costs. The total consideration
delivered exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by $63,468,000,
which has been recorded as goodwill and will be amortized on a straight line
basis over 40 years."
enterprise value was 83+23= 106M? but "total consideration" only refers to
cash/stock actually paid out? Total consideration was 63M over "fair value"
(what's that mean??) of "net assets". I assume it means bv = fair value of net
assets. Does that seem fair to you guys? -gg-

I'm not even sure that bv's for private vs. public companies are really
comparable. Public co may want to max book value for stockholder reports.
Private will minimize to keep taxes -- bus.?, inheritance? - low??

Price per sales which you mention does seem to be a better measure.
Unfortunately, it's not broken out in the 10Q, and so it's commingled with
increased prices, sales, additional purchases, and so on. My rough guess is
that egg production net sales was 43% of $455M in 9mo. sales of '96 and 62% of
$679M of 1st 9mo of '97. That's about a $224M swag from '96 to '97, some of
which includes Papetti's - how much, I don't know. If I'm off by half, then the
MKL paid (enterprise value) 106M for $112M in sales or about 1X sales. I am
running amok here -g-. And there's no stopping me now -g-. So for CALM, at 1x,
that's a $290M sales = purchase price. Backing out the 58M in debt, the
acquirer would assume, that leaves $242M to offer the stockholders, which
equates to....$19 per share. 3x the current $6 stock price? Uh... I don't think
so. You goofed somewhere Senior!! Maybe the whole
$224M swag from '96 to '97 could be included. That'd mean an acquirer would
offer about .47x sales of 290 or 137. Which after debt assumption is $6. So
stock is at fair value -g-

Jeffrey FYI, here's what MIKL says about their feed costs: "Feed costs, which
represent roughly two-thirds of the cost of producing an egg, were lower in the
1997 period than in the 1996 period, due principally to lower corn prices,
which benefited margins." Somewhere else in their report they say that shell
egg sales to others are only 7% of their business.

I'm starting to put so much work into this CALM analysis that I'm almost
committed to buying some of the thing :>).

I would hesitate to buy until I heard about the quarter just ended. I will try
to get a handle early next week. $6.125 is a fine price unless we will have a
temporary downtick if this past quarter is good, but not as good as the year
before (which I believe is the most probable scenario, at this point).

I agree with your interpretation of the purchase price MIKL paid. Fair value
often means excluding intangibles.

Often the 10Q or 10K will show what last year's results would have looked like
if the acquisition had been included then. The adjustment enables you to figure
out what the annual sales were of the acquisition, and what they were making as
well.

Incidentally, MIKL is worth following since they report on a calendar basis, so
you can see what they are saying about the current and future outlook for their
egg business - which comments cover much of the quarter CALM is still in.

<<I agree with your interpretation of the purchase price MIKL paid. Fair value
often means excluding intangibles.>>

On a statutory basis, in business combinations "fair market value of net
assets" as of the day of the combination is simply "fair market value of total
assets" (or what we would call just plain, old ordinary market value or
appraised value of total assets).....minus "fair market value of total
liabilities" (again, appraised or market value).

Intangibles as a general rule ARE included in the fair value calculation.
However, intangible items such as deferred taxes and prior goodwill on the
books of a company like Papetti's would NOT be treated in the fair value
calculation of assets and hence, would be swept into the goodwill category at
the time of combination.

<<Often the 10Q or 10K will show what last year's results would have looked
like if the acquisition had been included then. The adjustment enables you to
figure out what the annual sales were of the acquisition, and what they were
making as well.>>

jeffrey, in a "purchase" transaction which is the accounting method used for
the combination of MIKL with Papetti's, the combining of figures prior to the
date of combination is actually not required. As such, most companies don't
bother to give you this information for prior periods on their financial
statements.
You may, however, be confusing your recollection of financial statements
spelling out business combination numbers prior to the date of the transaction
with situations when a company changes its "method of consolidation" in another
company (ie, increases ownership over the 50% level; changes from equity method
of accounting to full consolidation method). I would think it therefore safe to
assume that the MIKL numbers used in statements this year referring to the
period prior to the Feb '97 acquisition do NOT include any Papetti numbers.

Paul, "fair value of net assets" would not be defined exactly as the "book
value" as shown on Papetti's balance sheet just prior to the acquisition. But I
believe it would be close enough to be safe for the calculation and comparative
general industry evaluation that you are attempting to benchmark. I think one
would have to know the magnitude of any assets assessed significantly higher
than cost at time of purchase as well as any assets excluded due to FASB
restrictions. In other words, get a hold of Papetti's private balance sheet on
12/31/96. :-)
For your purposes, you are attempting to compare the "fair market value" of an
industry transaction and apply that metric to the "book value" of CALM. Not
exactly an apples for apples comparison, yet all-in-all, 4X book sounds like a
usable number.
All IMHO, of course.

John Harris: What's CALM worth to a buyer-- sounds like one of my old business
school homework assignments. (It wasn't easy for me in that class then
either-g-). Well, on the hard assets of it, I'd guess most of the stuff is
mundane and fungible: some land, some coops, some chickens (lots of chickens
-g-), some refrigerated transport. Maybe though there's quite a competitive
strength in: being able to deal with environmental polution issues (poop in the
coop!), having contacts and bus. relationships with distributors and grocery
chains, managing or hedging costs - egg shell futures or feed costs, delivering
perishable goods on time - all the time, and being able to generally manage
dispersed operations which produce hundreds upon hundreds of millions of eggs
(and which deals with lotsa chickens (little ones, hungry ones, dead ones)
every year.

I took a look myself. MIKL 10K says that Papetti's is a producer of egg
products, not eggs, and was doing over $300 million sales. (It
buys eggs.) The next 10Q said that MIKL paid $106 million counting
assumption of debt (which would be $137 million at today's MIKL stock price of
$22). From a casual point of view I would rather own a value added producer
than the producer of the commodity, except I recall that in this industry some
of these processed products have not had good reception. In any case, it seems
to me that MIKL paid less on a P/S basis than CALM is now selling for. (This
does not change my investment perspective on CALM, but maybe I will have to be
more patient than I thought.)

Jeffrey Bash et. al.: re: CALM and moving on to TECUA

I need to step back from CALM a little. CALM looks good, maybe margin of safety
for me is when the commodity is in trouble and/or stock drops below book.
Buying right now in up cycle maybe...maybe too soon. I'll wait a bit and mull
it over.

Long time value investors: You may have come across Tecumseh Products? Always
seems to have been a mundane industrial, I suspect favored by value players. I
don't own this one - never have, but I see they have just announced a stock buy
back. Actually, (- and maybe as always for this stock -g-) the stock price
looks pretty good. Earnings are down, will be down... (some Brazilian bus.
issues), p/bv =1.1, ROE about 11%, pe range over past few years about 8-12.
Some protection with 2.4% div. yield. Conservately managed, seems like-- not
too much debt. Steadily rising bv, slowly increasing sales. That's TCUA at 49+,
trading off its low for the year. Could be a good solid, albeit slow, performer
in someone's portfolio. Anybody got any info. or opinions on this one?

Lots of good stocks out there. Sometimes hard to chose among them (even for a

The point is that $106 million (counting debt) divided by $300+ million sales
of Papetti gives about a 1/3 price to sales ratio.
If that standard is extended to CALM, counting its debt, the stock is not cheap
at $6. Just one yardstick, however.

involve a time-value-of-money consideration for some people. 1.3x 45bv = $58 up
from closing price of 49+ now. Meanwhile, bv and div. have been steady risers.

UST...I fight with my boss on this one all the time. I don't know why you'd
want to buy UST and take tobacco risk when you could own Philip Morris at 14
times earnings.

The big issue on this stock is that they are flirting with a price war. They
hold something like 80% market share. There are important competitive
advantages, but there are competitors and they're getting more and more
aggressive. I don't think UST can hold them off forever. When market share is
80% it can only go down. And when you're selling a product for three times what
it costs to make, there's a lot of downside to pricing too. Also, management
has a reputation for living well. Maybe all this is in the price, maybe not.

On the other hand, the business is a cash flow machine like very few others.
There is very little debt. It would be an incredible LBO at 45 a share. There
is a case to be made that portfolio managers don't look favorably on a company
that makes a product they don't understand or use. Thus golf stocks and
Tiffany's fly high, and things like UST get no respect. This has all the
characteristics of a deep value stock.

we don't regulate cholesterol, and heart disease is just as dangerous

tobacco investment, but as I see more and more patients,
I'm getting a lot more realistic and less idealistic. Heck, half
of the other doctors chew or smoke, and almost all are fat.

Well, I didn't buy it today because I'm waiting for them to complete

To all:
Matria Healthcare broke a downtrend line and is moving higher on light volume.
This indicates that the selling from "weak hands" is just about done, and IMO
we are going back to test the 7 level.

Matria has had a couple of problems this year, and the stock price reflects
this. The problems are largely behind them now, and some positive future
developments could really move the stock up.

Zacks has Matria earning $0.41 in 97, and $0.54 in 98. They are the largest
provider of home maternity management services. HMOs love Matria because their
services reduce the number of days that premature newborns have to be kept in
neonatal intensive care units. Matria goes into the pregnant patient's home to
administer and monitor the treatment prescribed by the woman's physician. They
also have a presence in the fertility service industry. SI: Matria Healthcare
(MATR) (#83/85)

The company has completed a major restructuring, and is now meaningfully
profitable from ongoing operations. (They are still writing off goodwill from a
recent merger of "unequals".)

The stock only sells for 5 7/8, and the risk/reward ratio IMO is terrific. I am
looking for one or more of the following events to unfold by the end of the
first quarter of 98.

- The stock settles an old lawsuit and the Morgan Keegan analyst puts out a BUY
rating, as he indicated he would do.

- Matria announces a significant share buyback program for which they are
already making preliminary plans.

- New products and services add to Matria's revenues, which goes straight to
the bottom line because their infrastructure is already in place. (One such
product is Johnson & Johnson's new tocolytic Atosiban which could be FDA
approved in the first quarter of 98. This could be huge for Matria, because
Atosiban would largely replace terbutylene, the current treatment of
preference.)

- New Wall St. coverage comes on board because of Matria's pristine financial
condition, and their potential for growth. (As you can tell from the number of
posts on the Matria thread, this stock is not yet a household name. I once cut
down a tree on that thread and nobody heard it!) The story is just getting out.
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=2854146

As they say in all such literature, my views are "forward looking" and previous
problems Matria had are now well known, discounted, and behind them. At least
that's what I'm betting my money on.

By the way, HD BROUS & Co. has an ACCUMULATE rating with a 12 month price
target for Matria of $12. IMO this is a real Value/Growth story.

Mike, thanks for your insight. Having trained in competitive places I've tended

I've also had trouble investing in HMO type companies that make a profit by
delivering cheap care as infrequently as possible. But when you see in the real
world that many (most) doctors are just health engineers: what's wrong with
just treating them like other instruments of production? Reduce headcount,

re: debt - with low interest rates, your strategy seems logical. With
inflation, it's a no-brainer. However with deflation, things would be reversed.
I personally believe that this market bubble is evidence of inflation in

project....I am not a trader but since doing my due diligence, I bought 6,000
shares for my IRA.....if you do research it, I would be very interested in your
thoughts.

I am letting the value investors on this thread know
that I started a thread to discus stocks which
engage in venture capital. We are attempting to
get in on new technologies early by investing in the
stocks that back companies which will later IPO.
Not exactly a typical value play, but it does deal
with unlocking hidden value.

James, has your opinion of AG changed. After reviewing it, AG is looking pretty
attractive to me. I also am encouraged by the recent purchase of 40,000 shares
by the CEO. On a technical basis, it looks like today it broke through the most
recent downtrend with above average volume, albeit not much above. Am I missing
something here?

Thanks.

S.

Mike, got no complaint with Vandy and UT. Got the usual UCSF bias re Stanfurd,
although I've spent a couple hundred grand letting a kid play there.

Tobacco makes me barf. More reasons to avoid UST: Liability settlement could
cost UST $1.70/share/year X 25; UST is losing market share, having to introduce
its own discount brands and coupon their high-priced spread.

The only problem with being ON every other night is that you miss half of the
good cases.

TTFN,

Dan

Well, now UCSF and Stanford are one. I only interviewed at those
two places, and it was a near tossup. Just chose Stanford over
UCSF about a week ago, but I certainly can't knock UCSF at all.
Maybe a few years at Stanford will change my tune.

Tobacco makes me barf too. But man oh man I absolutely despise
call.

Thanks for the UST feedback.

Good Investing,
Mike

Mike or Paul (or anyone else):
I share Mike's concerns about the cash flow of UHAL. But after a few minutes of
looking at the financials, can someone help me out? This company's earnings
seem to be a moving target and more difficult to predict than most. In
particular, I'm referring to the wild swings of purchases and sales of
property, plant, and equipment over the last three years. There appears to be
no discernible pattern to this activity. Is this one of management's gas pedals
for earnings control?

Specifically, these purchases and sales work themselves into the Income
Statement in the expense area under "Net Depreciation". The following is from
the most recent 10-Q:
Property, plant, and equipment......Gains and losses on dispositions are netted
against depreciation expense when realized

PS: This company might be a good one to spend time on to try to tackle to the
ground and figure out. The money seems hard to follow. Also, in looking at
Zack's I noticed one "moderate buy" and one "hold". Yet the consensus of two
expects earnings to increase 50% to 2.97/share for 3/99. Go figure.
