Interesting stock that BWEL. But given the illiquidity I don't think I'd feel
comfortable with much more than 1% of my assetts invested there. At least it
wouldn't take much time to review the financial reports and/or listen to the
conference calls <g>. If you have a portfolio of twenty or thirty stocks I
think you have to filter out the illiquid stocks like BWEL.

Also for the diversity question it does seem to me that to justify a position
of one-half percent in a stock requires significantly less research than to
justify a position of 5%.

Clearly if you are trying to win cocktail party bragging rights, diversity
works against you. But otherwise I think diversity is helpful to investment
returns especially if you have a day job or don't want to follow the market 40
hours per week.

I sold some of my shares at ~37.5 months ago, looking to buy them back if it
drops to $30 or so.

IMHO, your comment "drop, drop, drop" is rather an overstatement, considering
the stock frequently fluctuates 10-15%. I am also very surprised that a value
investor would buy shares at 38.40 and then sell them for a loss in two months
with no material change in business. Or were those the shares you got due to
dividend reinvestment?

CX. Yes, that buy-then-sell somewhat incompatible with value investing.

I made my last small buy as a speculative bet that the stock would continue to
rise. Which it did. Until it fell.

With the stock now down 15% from its recent high, and me holding an oversize
position in the stock, I felt it might be best if I scaled back a bit. It's my
first sale since I began accumulating stock in June 2000.

I hold about 40 stocks right now and I am looking to keep the same number or
reduce it a bit in the future. I am holding a few sector bets as stocks -
mostly energy related. Stocks constitute about 1/3 of my total investments.
Other 2/3 is mutual funds, but I am reducing this number.

Right now I am trying to eliminate or increase positions that constitute less
than 1% of my total investments (~3% of stocks).

Mutual funds I hold come in 3 varieties: a) accounts where I cannot hold
stocks, b) sector and market bets (energy, India, China) c) investments in
areas that I don't understand, but agree to be profitable. For example, I am
very different value investor from Marty Whitman, so I hold TAVFX as a
"different" value investment.

I never could figure out which of 2 stocks would be a "better" investment. I
can only operate in absolute terms: I know when a stock is a buy and I know
when a stock is a sell. If it is a buy, I buy a starter position (~1% of my
total investments) and increase it if the stock drops (usually, I double on
every 20% drop).

If stock is a sell, I sell the whole position. I also sometimes sell if stock
appreciates fast 20-30% from my buy price with no positive business
developments. On outsized positions, I may trim the position before the sell
point is reached. I also sell, if business materially changes or if I no longer
can understand or support holding the position.

I do no conscious diversification or risk management. I agree with Buffett on
this: if a stock is undervalued, it has low risk, if it is fairly valued to
overvalued, it has a high risk. That's it. ;) Volatility is not risk (I think
this one comes from Marty Whitman or was it Bill Miller? ;)).

Anializer, If we define bummer/surprise as a large gap-down, say 30%, I guess
I'd agree that that occurs more frequently with small than large cap stocks. It
seems to me though that it occurs infrequently nonetheless. And still so, with
my broad number of stocks, I expect I'd experience it more than someone with a
concentrated portfolio.

The infrequency of such gaps-down leads me to believe that perhaps they are
almost random occurrences that may or may not be avoided by someone owning the
stock & following it so closely so as to be able to avoid the surprise.

Just my impressions; I could be wrong. Maybe I'm unconsciously forgetting all
those painful gap-downs I've experienced. Mostly it seems my bummer/surprises
are long, drawn-out affairs. (e.g. taking losses today in some SALM shares,

I found this all a very fascinating discussion. On the basis of the inputs from
most who partook, my takeaway is that most investors who manage their own
accounts have anywhere from 30 to 50 holdings and are more focused on the
individual issues in their portfolios than on any large macro theme involving
diversification or value. The normal distribution on the bell curve seems to
imply that the outliers are more like yourself and Dale with more issues, and
some on the low end of the spectrum as well with only a few issues.

I guess striking the correct balance is an individual issue, and perhaps a
learned response based on experience. Only the individual managing there own
portfolio can say what's right for them when they take a look at their own
performance over time in terms of wealth building and increases in value.

I do agree with your concept of planting a few seeds for later harvest. But
becoming a farmer goes beyond that. Good food for thought and introspective
analysis. We all have to look in the mirror and say, what am I doing right, or
in lieu, what am I doing wrong.

I'm happy today <g> but my mood swings with 47 positions border on suicidal to
extreme elation at times. I'd like to minimize stress, but also to entertain
the idea of huge out performance. So the 8-12 position scenario is no good for
me, but the 400 position scenario out of the question as well. I don't want
much more than what I have now to stay on top of. But I said that 10 positions

TELOZ. Yes, I follow it. If there are hurricane disruptions this year, as we go
through the season, as strong as the GOM experienced before, TELOZ may again be
forced cancel its royalty payments (in order to pay for repairs), and that will
once again tank the stock - severely. (Since the attraction of the stock IS the
distribution)

When I read TELOZ's filings, I see that the life expectancy that is mentioned
for their properties is only a few years (about three if I recall). Well,
that's scary because as you know, this TELOZ is not really a business - as in a
viable (i.e. growing) entity - but rather is more like just a guy in an office
who receives money from Chevron as Chevron operates/extracts the oil/gas from
TELOZ's property. When the the extractions stop, payments stop. So when Chevron
says enough and ceases, that guy and the entity 'Tel Offshore' will be history.

Fwiw, rightly or wrongly, I've come to believe though that the life expectancy
of the oil/gas will be much longer than what the TELOZ documents say. So I'm
more comfortable holding the shares. I do not like or want k-1 partnership
filing stuff, so I'm uncomfortable with that aspect.

As well, I've bought a little BJS today.

For me, I see it as kind of a plant-the-seed thing.

As I understand the situation (and I may be quite wrong), Canadian drilling for
natural gas is down substantially because the price of nat. gas is down (while
expenses for extraction are up). Yet - and apparently inexplicably (?) there's
quite a bit of drilling in USA. Odd (??)

Anyway it's cyclical - imho. Demand for gas should continue (increase) and as
fewer wells are added to service (from Canada), the price of gas should
increase (ie. from increased demand/decreased supply), and that price increase
should lead to a resumption in demand for drilling/rigs/BJS services. So BJS
earnings and stock should rise...eventually in the cycle.

Lot of "shoulds" there in this cycle, if it is a cycle. We'll know more in 18
months.

regarding REIT's

Grommit this is a nice list you assembled. i have been adding recently to my
REIT holdings. i have tried to work on you approach of looking at FFO/price
ratio and also look at net rent / EV as a valuation metric when i compare
similar REIT's. this way i can account for leverage, which makes highly
leveraged REIT's appear cheaper in terms of FFO/price. At this point with
interest rates rising, i prefer low leverage, which is one of the reasons I
choose SNH even though is does not appear to be the cheapest in terms of
FFO/price.

This also lead me to prefer CLI to BDN per the following calculation:

CLI: 41$/share x89M shares +2200M$ (net debt) -700M$ (current assets)= 4.821B$
4.821B$/140M$ rent x4 = 8.6 (EV/net rent annualized)

BDN: 27$/share x89M$ + 3500M$ -700M$ (current assets)= 5.183B$
5.183B$/138M$ x4= 9.39 (EV/net rent annualized)

For rent i took the net rent (wo pass through items) from the last quarter and
multiplied it by 4 for the annualized number. So by that calculation CLI is
almost 9% cheaper than BDN, although the FFO/price ratio looks about 105 lower
for BDN. Also CLI appears to have the better LT track record. Anyways that
calculation is just to illustrate how to look at REIT valuations in general and
CLI and BDN are nice examples because their are similar in their location and
size (note that the revenue numbers are almost identical). This is also what a
private equity manager may look at if they are smart <g>.

implication, if I recall right, was that MCGC had several recent poor ones, and
this particular one could have been avoided.

Based on diversity of deals, I'll bet MCGC will get through this with no cut in

Although, if this does happen

"if they can't sell any of their investments and can't access capital/debt

and if it turns out that these bdc's do suffer because of that,

Hi Paul - PLT announced good earnings today and they are 6-8 months away from
making their Altec Lansing division profitable.

Plantronics Rises on Higher 1Q Profit
Wednesday July 25, 11:55 am ET
Analyst Upgrades Plantronics After Fiscal 1Q Profit Rises 22 Percent
http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070725/plantronics_mover.html?.v=1

I have met my one year price target but based on today's announcement, I will
continue to hold and wait for the analysts upgrades. The key to new revenue
growth will be the contribution from their Altec Lansing division (purchased in
4/2006). It looks like management has stopped the bleeding and this division
(per the conference call) should return to profitability early next year.

Global sales continue quite strong with U.S. sales YTD higher but not as strong
as non-us growth. This could be due to the lower dollar making non-us products
more price competitive. Gross margins increased to 46% up from 43% and their
international markets show solid high 25% growth YTD.

Management continues to reinvent their supply chain and inventory management
systems. This helps the company maintain their high margins and allows quick
new product introduction. Once the manufacturing of the Altec Lansing products
are folded into this new system and product manufacturing is moved to China,
profitability should follow.

Based on their forward PE of 18, PLT may still be a value proposition given
their performance in their communication division worldwide. The sleeper asset
is their Altec Lansing division. The stock sold in the $35 area but fell down
below $20 when management reported their first quarter results (after their
buyout in April 2006) of their Altic Lansing division.

The company has the opportunity to capitalize on their purchase of the Altec
Lansing assets and they are more than half way completing their turnaround.
That's why I plan to continue to hold at least for another 6-8 months.

I weaseled out of BJS during the short runup before the earnings report as it

think you are correct that it's a cheap option play on NG in North America. I
put the funds into NBR which isn't doing much better. What i do like about them
is that their Capex is winding down next year which means that they are going
to be cash flow positive by a very significant amount. Hopefully BJS will be in
a similar situation since the current capex sure does not earn a good ROI
currently.

RAS- my current take on ras fwiw is that their packages are more illiquid now
so its gonna cost them more to sell. therefore they will have apricing problem
on loans where they committed to a set interest rate but did not sell yet.
Therefore I believe that they will be reducing their dividend at some point but
I dont see them going bankrupt. They will adjust like everyone else, and may
end up packaging differently but I think they stay in business and make money.
I Plan on avoiding anything else to do with the home, and retail for the time
being. There are just too many houses on the market. The only people I hear
selling their houses are the very wealthy or people who drop their price a lot,
other than that I know several people who are now carrying 2 mortgages they
never intended to. My brother in law is a small contractor in colorado- his
clients have delayed several projects but he has a crew who depends upon him
for employment so he built a spec house he's trying to sell. How many other
homebuilders are in the same boat? I would not touch the homebuilders until we
see bankruptcies in the business.

I was caught in the headlights also. Trying to decide what to buy right away.
Could not decide, so I decided that it did not matter, just buy something!.

Also decided not to be upset with the market. Read this again:

"I'm always much happier when stocks are trading at their 52 week lows than I
am at 52 week highs. It's simple: If you have a valuation discipline, then you
know that stock prices change more rapidly than business value... And that's
where people get into trouble, because they perceive risk to be high when
prices are low, and they perceive risk to be low when prices are high. That's
the psychological problem that most people have."

But that is only true if you have cash or decide to use margin.

OurPet's Company Reports Record 2007 Second-Quarter and First-Half Financial
Results
Thursday July 26, 8:30 am ET

FAIRPORT HARBOR, OH--(MARKET WIRE)--Jul 26, 2007 --

-- Second-Quarter Net Income up 628.4% on a 28.3% Increase in Quarterly
Sales
-- First-Half Net Income up 262.9% on a 25.5% Increase in First-Half
Sales
-- Management Optimistic About 2007

OurPet's Company (OTC BB:OPCO.OB - News): a growing designer, developer,
producer and marketer of accessory and consumable pet products, today reported
record financial results for the 2007 second quarter and first half ended June
30, 2007.

Net revenues for the 2007 second quarter increased 28.3 percent to $2,816,812
from $2,196,069 in the same period a year ago. Gross margin, as a percent of
sales for the 2007 second quarter, increased significantly, 5.1 percentage
points to 28.9 percent, from 23.8 percent in the 2006 second quarter. Net
income for the 2007 second quarter increased 628.4 percent to $172,012,
compared to $23,615 for the 2006 second quarter. Earnings, before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), for the 2007 second quarter,
increased 107.6 percent to $331,507, compared to $159,703 for the 2006 second
quarter.

Net revenues for the 2007 first half increased 25.5 percent to $5,400,182 from
$4,303,510 in the same period a year ago. Gross margin, as a percent of sales
for the 2007 first half, increased 2.7 percentage points to 27.8 percent, from
25.1 percent in the 2006 first half. Net income for the 2007 first half
increased 262.9 percent to $287,525, compared to $79,234 for the 2006 first
half. EBITDA for the 2007 first half increased 77.7 percent to $600,608,
compared to $337,916 for the 2006 first half.

Dr. Steven Tsengas, President and CEO, stated, "We reached many financial and
operating milestones during the quarter, including record second quarter sales
and net earnings. During the quarter, we successfully completed the move into
our new warehouse at our headquarters, greatly enhancing the amount of space we
have for inventory and efficient staging, fulfillment, receiving and shipping
operations. As a result of this expansion, we closed a warehouse facility
operated in Akron, Ohio, which will lower our cost of doing business. Also
during the 2007 second quarter, we were successful in expanding our market
penetration as we received orders from two major national drugstore chains.
This is our first entrance into the drugstore market. Most importantly during
the quarter, we became much closer to the launch of the SmartScoop™ automatic
cat litter box. We are working closely with our Chinese manufacturer to make
sure the launch goes smoothly.

"For the quarter, sales and net earnings continued to improve as a result of
the strong growth from our existing product lines mostly to our established
customers. As a result, we are well positioned to expand sales and earnings as
we enter the seasonally strong second half of the year. During the second half
of 2007, we also expect to launch our ecoPure Naturals brand of products. I
encourage everyone to go to our new websites featuring SmartScoop™ and ecoPure
Naturals. They can be found at http://www.smartscoop.com and
http://ecopurenaturals.com ."

Dr. Steve concluded, "While we are concentrating very hard on successfully
launching our new products, we have begun developing new products for 2008. We
are optimistic that during 2008 we will introduce a significant amount of
innovative new products focused on promoting pet health, well-being and owner
and pet interaction. We remain optimistic that the remainder of 2007 will show
very favorable comparisons over the same periods last year."

Nibbled at a few more shares of Companhia Paranaense de Energia (ELP) to add to
the other shares I have in the IRA account. I like that they have 17
hydroelectric plants and 1 thermoelectric plant, with a total installed
capacity of 4,549.6 megawatts.

These are excellent assets that continue to generate cash flow that are not
affected by the price of oil. In fact, their production costs are pretty much
fixed and only gain in value as the price of oil rises.

The utility also spins off a good dividend and has good long term growth
prospects that benefits from a falling U.S. dollar.

Homebuilders. Carnage continues. Perhaps we'll see bk for one or more, or
consolidation among publicly traded firms.

Rather than go with an individual or group of homebuilders now, I'll take more
LPX. (Still watching PHM though, which I might go for if it drops again under
$20.)

Planning on holding for 18 months, I'll step in now for a few more shares of
building supplier LPX. I assume that new houses will be built, and no matter
which company builds them or where they're built, one component considered will
be OSB - oriented strand board (a plywood competitor). LPX dominates in OSB
production. So if/when housing rebounds, LPX might/could/should too.

LPX has a pretty good balance sheet, it seems to me. More cash than debt. Per
Yahoo, bv is about $19/sh, stock is about $18.26, cash/sh. about $8.78/sh.

Co. has staying power in other words, and should benefit if housing market ever
improves. I've convinced myself I have more assurance of LPX's future, than of
any individual homebuilder. (Not that much assurance though -g-; only adding a
few shares to the few I already have.)

Yes, they should have accepted $22 per share.

But you also have to look at it another way: Icahn is not an idiot. If he
wanted to pay $22 for WCI, why won't he buy other homebuilders in the future
for similar or more attractive prices? He (and others) may be fearful and
having trouble getting loans now, but some time in the future they will realize
that they can buy out these guys cheap. It's only a matter of time, money and

The Bloomberg synopsis on ABB was more thorough. Seems to me that power
generation capability in Asia will continue to be a large driver going forward.
I know everybody keeps saying China, China, China when it comes to the demand
for natural resources and the like, but its hard to argue against, after all,
they do have the money.

July 26 (Bloomberg) -- ABB Ltd., the world's largest builder of power grids,
reported a record quarterly profit on increased sales of transformers,
switchgear and substations to clients in China and the Middle East.

Second-quarter net income almost doubled to $729 million, or 32 cents a share,
from $367 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier, Zurich-based ABB said in a
statement today. Analysts had estimated a profit of $580 million.

ABB's order backlog jumped 39 percent, swollen by contracts to build
substations in Abu Dhabi and provide electrical systems for oil platforms off
Qatar. In Asia, China alone plans to spend about $33 billion this year on
extending its electricity grid to power new factories and reduce outages.

``ABB has switched on the turbo boost to deliver stellar results,'' said
Panagiotis Spiliopoulos, and analyst at Vontobel in Zurich with an
``outperform'' rating on the stock. ``The outlook remains solid, though order
growth is unlikely to remain at these high levels,'' he said in a note.

Shares of ABB closed little changed at 27.5 Swiss francs after European stocks
tumbled the most in five months. It earlier rose 4.9 percent, the sharpest gain
since April 26. ABB has advanced 26 percent this year, compared with a 2.5
percent increase in the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index. That gives a market value of
62.4 billion francs ($52 billion).

`Suspect Payments'

The Swiss company said in the statement it has informed U.S. authorities of
``suspect payments'' made by some units and may face penalties. London-based
Credit Suisse analyst Julian Mitchell said that while the disclosure is ``worth
monitoring,'' he does not view it as a major issue at this stage.

News on the payments ``is the one snag in an almost perfect quarterly report,''
ABB Chief Executive Officer Fred Kindle said on a conference call, adding that
the company hasn't put aside provisions as it can't yet determine what the case
may cost.

Second-quarter sales gained 27 percent to $7.14 billion and profit before
interest and tax rose 60 percent to $1.03 billion. That's equal to 14.4 percent
of revenue, the company's best-ever margin, up from 11.4 percent a year
earlier. Kindle said there's potential to increase profitability further.

China Sales

Emerging markets generated 44 percent of ABB's revenue last year. In China, the
world's fastest-growing major economy, sales rose 17 percent to $2.8 billion,
more than one-tenth of the group total. Work in the Middle East was spurred as
countries and companies used higher oil revenues to fund infrastructure
projects. The Abu Dhabi contract for three substations is valued at $126
million and the Qatari order at $26 million.

``Emerging markets are helping us a lot,'' Kindle said in an interview. ``They
need power-grid infrastructure because that's the backbone for industrial
development.''

Second-quarter sales rose 36 percent in Asia and 57 percent in the Middle East
and Africa.

``These are incredible quarterly results, especially on the margin level,''
said Flavio Miloni at Banca del Gottardo in Lugano, Switzerland, which oversees
about $33 billion, including ABB shares. ``I didn't expect such a positive
surprise, it shows the market underestimated the need for infrastructure in
Asia.''

Revenue increased 20 percent in Europe, where new orders include a sub-sea
connection between the U.K. and the Netherlands aimed at increasing the
efficiency of the continent's power. In the Americas, sales rose 17 percent as
power providers such as the Tennessee Valley Authority upgrade decades-old
networks.

Order growth may ``moderate somewhat'' over the remainder of 2007 compared with
the first half, ABB said today. The company said on April 26 it plans to
provide new revenue and profit targets through 2011 in September after
exceeding most of its goals set for 2009 by the end of last year.

Purchase Plans

Kindle, 48, said last December that ABB has ``several'' billion dollars to
spend on acquisitions, ending five years of disposals, mainly under former CEO
Juergen Dormann, as the company emerged from near-bankruptcy. Kindle is
continuing to assess opportunities, he said today.

ABB on July 13 informed the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange
Commission of payments made by employees in Asia, South America and Europe,
particularly Italy, it said in the statement. The payments, discovered after an
internal audit, may leave ABB ``liable for penalties and other costs.''

ABB was formed in 1988 through the merger of BBC Brown Boveri of Switzerland
and ASEA AB of Sweden, and generates about 90 percent of sales at its
automation and power units. The company also makes robots used for everything
from packaging cookies to the industrial milking of cows.

The business employed about 111,000 people at the end of the second quarter, up
2,000 from the first, it said today.

Liking WPL quite a bit more at this level. Trading at about $10.90, which gives
a 5.5% dividend yield. It previously bottomed out (and stayed there for a long
time) at just over a 6% yield.

I would expect that the short position isn't quite as large now, so not as much
fuel there, but it should still be sizable. There were 2 or 3 days where
trading in the last half hour looked like it could've been short covering, but
not enough total volume to have made a huge dent in the short position.

One of the things I like most about this company (aside from so much of it
being held by Van Den Berg) is that the 15 cent per quarter dividend only
applies to the first 3 quarters. 4th quarter dividend is a surprise, and I
think the 15-cent dividend is sand-bagged enough that 4th quarter dividend
should be a positive surprise rather than negative.

On the flip side, the few analysts who cover it hate it. Consensus target is in
the $7's and on the 1-5 buy-sell scale, it's more biased toward sell than any
stock I watch, at about 4.2.

The analysts obviously don't expect the dividend (already cut) to hold, as the
target price gives an 8.2% yield.

I'm really sitting on the fence as to whether I think the analysts' hatred of
the stock is a good or bad thing, but am betting lightly in the trade accounts
(heavily in the LT account) that it's a good thing.

Thanks for your list of REITs, Grommit. Always interested in what you have to
say.

I've been watching SNH very closely after being fortunate in selling earlier
this year. As I recall, they are closely linked to FVE, one of their largest
tenants.

One of the concerns in the senior housing sector comes from somebody that works
in the sales office of a senior community, (the independent senior community,
rather than "assisted or full-care communities). Sales during the last several
months have been lagging substantially because the seniors in their target
group have had difficulty selling their houses, making it less likely for them
to buy into the communities. And turnover can be fairly high at all senior
communities.

I've been in and out of SNH several times over the last few years, just looking
for the best time to get in again. (Also still have a final third of full
position in MPW)

FSP is already my largest position in my IRA and with CBF & FUR also in there.
I guess Im not willing to keep buying unless and untill we see some more
insider buying.

I think CBFs insiders are restricted but I dont think FSPs are. (Or they werent
last year around this time)

I added to a big losing positon in AHM at $10.01.

My first buy was at $28.

It will be interesting to see how that one ends up.

My portfolio has "taken a beating" in the last 2 weeks and many of the stuff I
own/ bought with nice dividends that I expected to provide some kind of cushion
in a down market has done just the opposite.

FSP,CBF & FF all have been tanking.

I have been heavily in cash for a long time now so hopefully I will find some
buying opportunities somewhere down the line if prices continue to fall.

As usual, I will keep an eye out for very recent insider buying activity to
point the way.

FF has had some more insider buying for those interested in financial services.
I bought awhile back based on their terrific long term track record.

Will consider adding more on weakness.

Had some positve news in longtime shell CTSC which Phillip Frost has a big
position in. He finally merged it with something and it went up big before
falling back slightly. Frost has a heckuva track record so Im inclined to let
it ride.

My cost basis is in the 70-80 cent range and its currently about $2.15-2.45.
Ive owned it going on 3 years now.

I added a few more shares of JnJ at the close ($59.75). It hit a 52wk low on
today's close. Warren Buffet has been accumulating this stock with an average
price around $61. (fair value for JnJ is $107/share according to gurufocus.com)
http://www.gurufocus.com/StockBuy.php?symbol=JNJ&GuruName=Warren+Buffett

Also, JnJ announced a $10 billion stock buy back earlier this month.
http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/2007-07-09-buybacks-companies_N.htm
From the article:"...J&J, the world's largest maker of health care products,
will use a combination of cash and debt to fund a $10 billion repurchase
program..."

Hopefully, the bottom is in and when earnings are released in August, it will
start a slow and steady rise to $107 in a few years.

Disclosure: With today's purchase, JnJ made my #10 position in my top ten
holdings in the taxable portfolio.

Hi Jurgis - I have bookmarked your homebuilder selection Meritage Homes
Corporation (MTH). I still think the company can trade lower and I will wait
for a buy entry around $17.00. I am familiar with Nevada real estate and
recently homes that sold for $620,000 are now selling at $490,000. After
listening to their conference call they confirm this as MTH was seeing the
largest declines in Nevada off 74% this year. California was off more than 53%
but Texas was doing good.

Looking at the balance sheet the company has a strong balance sheet but debt to
equity is misleading as the company has been marking down their current
inventory. Book Value decreases as their mark downs continue but at some point
their market inventory value will stabilize and the value investor will be
better able to evaluate the value of their hard assets.

Since MTH operates in many of the markets that are of interest to me and seem
to be an efficient builder, this might be one to watch when the market turns. I
think it is still too early to buy in the current cycle, this may be a good one
to own when the time is right.

a128. I'll add more to such stocks if they drop further on no adverse new.

"...many of the stuff I own/ bought with nice dividends that I expected to
provide some kind of cushion in a down market has done just the opposite."

I'd say absolutely all of those which I bought for dividends to provide a
cushion are down. Perhaps not all substantially so, but all down enough (and
some down more than enough -g-). Since my weightings in these type stocks are
much greater than others, my total portfolio value is very very much affected.

I'm REALLY surprised, dismayed and and a little disconcerted by the drops now
in the good dividend/distribution paying stocks.

My intent though is to continue adding if/as such stocks drop to further lows.

I could be very wrong. While dividend yields on some of these stocks are
relatively high to their history and/or to bond yields - that is, some stocks
yielding 8,9,10,11,12 percent -, I have seen a stock distribution yield as high
as 18% for an okay stock in a previous instance when Mr. Market has really
wanted out of stocks. I'm saying, I've no assurance that things will not get
worse for our dividend/distribution paying stocks.

I also added to JNJ both yesterday at $61 and today a bit under $60. I've still
room for a bit more if it keeps dropping.

I also nibbled a bit of CAT, hoping that some of their recent woes are one time
events.
