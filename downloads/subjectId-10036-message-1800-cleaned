<<it sounds like we have a different definition of efficient>>

I neither agree nor believe this is a logical
response to my arguments.

<<Value investing has turned into "emotional contrarian fashion investing",>>

You evidently are not familiar with what goes
on here. You sound like a momentum investor
who doesn't believe in value investing, believes
markets are efficient -- even US Small Cap --
and are mistaking the run-up in Tejon Ranch
for the routine action of value investors. The value
investors got in before the run-up. Scanning
the boards to which you typically post, I
see a momentum player, not a bottom feeder.

I wonder if every once in a while the heavens
will send us someone like you just to
create some excitement on what is generally
a non-emotional thread. A man named Reginald
comes to mind...

I agree. 34 posts and only one stock to look at. Let's get back to finding some
buys. I'm having trouble finding anything and would appreciate anything to look

BTW - I looked at Tejon and didn't buy because it looked like a very long term

value investors get lucky.

Unfortunately, the bull market has already
taken most of the ideas on this thread up,
up and away. It almost appears there is
a correlation between mention here and
appreciation within months.

Some of the ideas I'm mulling with all
the cash I raised recently:

Ispat Int'l
For the reason for my interest, check out:
http://www.cnnfn.com/hotstories/busunu/9708/07/ispat_intv/
The stock IPO'd very recently near 30, and has
fallen to the 25's with the market. This gives
it a PE of about 5. Yet it is a leading int'l
integrated steel producer. I am having trouble
finding info on it, though -- a source of
inefficiency that might be capitalizable.

Hyde Athletics, my thoughts at
http://www.sealpoint.com/pow.html

Thinking it is not too late to buy WHX,
but waiting for the market to become
more of a bear.

Chris-Craft -- much discussed here
is trading lower but remains a true
value, though not an overlooked one.
Everyone on Wall Street is standing
there looking at it, saying "Yep,
there's a company worth at least
2.2B selling for 1.5B. Yep, no debt.
Yep."

I'm consciously raising cash in anticipation
of a downturn.

If it means that much to you, Paul, yeah Clarke just bought Hyde. Its a net net
with nothing terribly wrong with it. But don't hold your breath on a limit
order. The market maker is really playing games with this one. I had a limit in
most of the day yesterday and didn't get filled even though trades went off
under my limit price. Finally I just paid the ask. This one might require some
patience and a gutcheck here and there, but I don't see how you lose money when
you pay $4 1/4 for something with net current assets of over $6 and another (at
least) 50 cents in owned real estate. Plus a brand name and R&D that has got to
be worth something if it allows them to sell shoes for over $100.

I would be the first to admit that the Barrons article on Tejon was a stroke of
luck. I was expecting to have to wait at least a year for my double. But so far
I've found that I tend to get the "luckiest" when I buy things for half what
they're worth. I find I'm even "luckier" when there is a catalyst in place. I
guess those guys who buy stocks at 50 times earnings consider it just bad luck
when they miss the next quarter by a penny and get cut in half. Just a thought.

Rather than continue to fight the last war (its too late on Tejon) - I would
love to hear some more thoughts on Hyde. And I have another one I want to post

Hyde got 7.1M for Brookfield. For a company

Hind and Quintana Roo brands, that ain't bad.
My broker and I weasled a price of 4.09 on

I think they got about $7 million for it. Looks like it was a real dog. The NAV
was 9 million, so they basically gave it away for the value of the receivables
and inventory. Pretty much how Hyde's stock is priced. There's your downside,
that the rest of the business is worth pretty much the same as what they sold.
But the way I look at it, that downside is basically what I paid for the stock.
And I do not believe that is really the liquidation value. I think you could
liquidate this business and hand me a $5.50 a share check.

I don't know whether the sold business was losing money, but I would guess it
was.

I don't know what the stock has done in the aftermarket, but it looked pretty
fairly valued at the IPO. Management is brilliant. They are deep value
investors themselves.

Be very very careful with multiples on this one. They have something called
"negative amortization". Don't ask how, but it is a non-cash reverse charge.
i.e. it makes earnings look MUCH higher than they are. Make sure you really
scour a prospectus before you buy this one because it looks cheap on P/E or
price/book. That said though, it is a fascinating business, and probably worth
a look.

STAR - LoneStar Steakhouse may be a value Stock. It has a PE of 9.5 using
trailing earnings. Its P/Sls is 1.3 and P/BkVal is 1.3. The price was recently
knocked down because management preannounced a shortfall of .10 to .13 in Q3
earnings. The cause is a drop in comparable store sales of 11% for the qtr and
7.7% for the year. One reason for this is the competitive casual dining makret
and the fact that STAR has not advertised and the competition has.

I think that this may be a value play and would appreciate other opinions and

Re: STAR

Terry,

I believe you are correct. Thank you for reminding
me of this stock. I had wanted to track it last
time it was at this level, but forgot. My take:

Lone Star Steakhouse

Operates 3 main chains with 3 price levels,
with lots of room for growth in the upper
two levels if not the bottom level.

In general restaurant stocks have missed
the bull market and many are treading
water. Still, this stock is cheap compared
to its industry:
PE 9.5 vs. 23.7
P/B 1.3 vs. 3.94
PSR 1.3 vs 2.25 (ESR for this company is ~1)
Net Profit Margin 14% vs 10%
No debt vs. TDebt/Equity Avg of 0.69

The company has $3.62/share in cash, so
you get the business for in the high $500
million range. This for a business that
generates $36M in operating cash flow
per quarter in the abscence of leveraged
operations. The present value of these
future cash flows relative to cost of equity
sits around ~$1Billion, even with no
growth. Yet growth is definitely a
possibility given the new venture
into higher-end, $60/customer restaurants.

Hence, I see a company that is
undervalued even if it did not grow
further -- you get the growth for
free and then some if it happens.
No insider sales. It is hard to see
the downside here, but here goes:

1) Management recently repriced
its options to the 18ish level from
higher levels
2) Institutions owned >85% of the
company on 6/30. That is probably
down no thanks to the massive
dump on August 5th that knocked
the shares to this level.
3) There are already 10 analysts following
it, with an average Zacks rating of
2.1. This may be an advantage.
Ken Fisher's Super Stocks book
has helped me understand better
the institutional viewpoint on
fallen angels that have hit a
"glitch." The stock wouldn't be
this low if the institutional
psychology wasn't against it -
a plus from my point of view.

Technically, it is at a support level,
so now would be a good time to
buy. Further, it has basically
hammered out a straight horizontal
line since the fall 3 weeks ago.
This tells me we are at something
of a floor. Lots are bailing, but
lots are buying too.

I'll add this to my portfolio. Thank
you.

Good investing,
Mike

Lone Star, Rare Hospitality Drop On 3Q Weak Outlooks

By Thomas Granahan

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Steakhouse operators Rare Hospitality International Inc.
(RARE) and Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon Inc. (STAR) served up a couple of
tough third-quarter outlooks, which sliced their respective stock prices.
Shares of Lone Star earlier hit a 52-week low of 17, dropping below the
previous trough of 17 7/8 set April 25. Recently, the stock was trading at 17
9/16, down 4 7/16, or 20.2%, on Nasdaq volume of 7.1 million, compared with
average daily turnover of 848,000,
Rare lost 2 7/8, or 20.4%, to 11 1/4 on Nasdaq volume of 403,100, compared with
a daily average of 212,800.
Late Monday, Lone Star said its third-quarter results, hurt by continuing
declines in average unit volumes that in turn have lowered margins, will come
in 10 cents to 13 cents a share below Wall Street's expectations. The analysts'
consensus estimate provided by First Call Inc. was 47 cents a share.
Also Monday, Rare Hospitality said it does not expect to meet the current range
of analysts' third-quarter earnings-per-share estimates. Analysts had expected
the company to earn 23 cents a share, according to First Call.
Lone Star, of Wichita, Kan., added that it plans to spend money on advertising
and marketing in the last half of the year - reversing its long stance against
advertising - which will also eat away at margins.
"Although (the advertising) should mitigate the sales decline, it is likely to
have a negative impact on margins in the near term," said Jefferies & Co. Inc.
analyst David Rose, who lowered his rating on Lone Star to hold from buy. "It
now seems that there is very little choice but to advertise in this extremely
competitive environment after long resisting this strategy due to concerns over
its impact on margins."
Rose said the casual dining sector will probably remain highly competitive for
some time, which will continue to put pressure on same-store sales into the
first quarter of 1998.
He lowered his third-quarter earnings estimate to 36 cents a share from 50
cents, and his 1997 outlook to $1.76 from $2.05. Last year, Lone Star earned
$1.49 a share, including the writeoff of its European operations.
Rose said that while the company's balance sheet and cash flow will provide
investors some value if Lone Star can reverse the declining sales trend, the
stock may face significant selling pressure in the near term as investors lose
confidence in the prospects of a quick turnaround.
Lone Star said Monday that same-store sales have fallen 11.1% so far in the
third quarter, bringing year-to-date same-store sales down 7.7%.

Lone Star, Rare Hospitality Stks-2: Rare Seeks To Cut Costs

First Call said its new third-quarter consensus earnings estimate for Lone Star
is 35 cents a share, based on seven analysts, while the 1997 outlook has been
dropped to $1.76 a share from $2.02.

The latest 1998 estimate calls for net income of $2.10, compared with the
previous estimate of $2.46.

Meanwhile, Rare Hospitality said it continues its battle to lower costs.

The Atlanta concern on Monday posted second-quarter net income of $2 million,
or 17 cents a share, compared with $2.4 million, or 20 cents, a year ago. The
latest per-share results beat the First Call mean estimate by 1 cent, but the
company had already said in June that it anticipated net income of 16 cents to
18 cents a share, sharply below analysts' estimates at the time of 25 cents to
27 cents.

Rare said increased restaurant-level costs, primarily in its LongHorn
Steakhouse business, reduced earnings, while revenue increased 25% over 1996 to
$64.3 million.

The company also announced that its highly regarded president and chief
executive, Richard Rivera, has unexpectedly resigned to take the top job at
Chart House Enterprises Inc. (CHT).

"(Rivera) came in 1994 and really engineered what was through 1995 and 1996 a
very impressive turnaround," said Robinson-Humphrey & Co. analyst Bryan
Elliott. "He restructured the menu and the operations and the site selection
process."

Elliott suggested that the large selloff in Rare's shares was due in equal part
to Rivera's resignation and the third-quarter outlook.

The analyst said the expected results for the quarter are particularly
disappointing because of the relatively easy comparisons against the year-ago
period, when the Olympics in Atlanta had an adverse impact on Rare's results.

From:James Clarke

Ok, here's what I found out about Hyde (HYDEA). Mike gave me this idea,
although as usual he humbly credits it to somebody else. I just know who told
me.

Hyde is the parent of Saucony (running shoes). They just divested a doggy
rollerblade business to focus on the core. Market cap is only $25 million.

But forget the business for a moment. I do not wake up in the morning looking
for chances to invest in Nike's competitors. Especially when Nike itself is
looking borderline cheap. Hyde is special. It is a 1997 value investor's dream
- a true net-net. Net-net is a Ben Graham concept and is pretty simple, yet it
is VERY hard to find one. The stock trades below the value of its current
assets minus ALL liabilities. This one trades 40% below that very conservative
hurdle (a true margin of safety). Why is that so significant? Current assets
are things like cash, receivables and inventory. Inventory might be a little
suspect, but cash and receivables are pretty likely to be worth what they are
on the balance sheet for. Subtract all liabilities - i.e. assume all the
liabilities are real. This valuation technique assigns zero value to more
uncertain assets such as factories or goodwill. Trust me, you will not find
many stocks today that meet this criteria.

When you find one, usually it will be a horrible business or have some
contingent liability (lawsuit) off balance sheet. I did not find anything
strange with this one. And the business is not all that awful. It makes money,
not much, but positive. Just within my small office I found one person who will
not buy another brand of athletic shoe. Saucony has a very loyal following of
hard-core runners who consider it the technological leader. i.e. a niche
player. Saucony is small, but they have been small since the 1970s but have
survived the onslaught of Nike because they have stuck to their niche. Its not
the next Nike, but they are not going out of business anytime soon.

I am not looking to hold this stock long term. You can buy today at 4 1/4 and
the net-net valuation - the most conservative you can do - gives a value of
over $6. Them's good odds. I would bet money (actually I did when I bought the
stock) that HYDEA will trade at 6 sometime in the next year or so. And then I
will sell. That will be a cool 40% return given the cost of trading this
illiquid stock (the spread is horrendous).

Now, think accounting. I defined net-net. That's $6 1/4. Now lets go beyond
that. Fixed assets. Owned real estate is worth 50-75 cents per share. The brand
name is worth something, and that amount is probably not trivial. The
technological reputation with Saucony customers indicates to me that the
know-how (past R&D) is worth something too. Thus I think the true asset value
is arguably double the share price. And there is a chance that a Reebok or
Adidas would take out this company for something approximating $8 a share.
That's not why I invested, but stranger things have happened when I have bought
things for half what they're worth.

I just don't see how I can lose with this stock if I have patience. But I don't
expect another Tejon Ranch - this one will probably take time. I see no
downside risk in the long term, and I see no correlation with the market. But I
do see the potential for a double.

This is not a recommendation - do your own homework. You should absolutely read
the 10-K, 10-Q and Proxy at a minimum before investing.

Thanks Mike

No thanks on Lonestar. There is no asset value - everything is leased. So
you're going on earnings and cash flow in an industry with no barrier to entry.
Drive down a suburban highway and you see steakhouse after steakhouse chain
restaurant. They're killing each other.

BUT you are onto something, though probably not Lonestar in my view. Restaurant
stocks are deeply out of favor on Wall Street. If you're conservative, it could
be a great time to buy McDonalds. The more daring (I would argue stupid) would
go for Boston Chicken (make sure you understand the accounting thoroughly - the
Wall Street analysts don't). But I think the restaurant play is going to be the
PEpsico spinoff coming in October. Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell. Its going to
come out at about 17x earnings, but it won't stay there. Do your homework on
this one, pick a price - and then wait. I think it will come to you.

Re: STAR

Thanks, Paul. An Enterprise-to-Sales of

IMO. The market seems to have overreacted
to the threat of lower margins -- it is
already priced into the stock (and then
some). Even the analyst cites the
balance sheet and cash flow as sources
of support -- pretty impressive.
Any dip from here due to a selloff
by frustrated short-term holders like he cites

Re: STAR

The balance sheet shows over $350M in

them to have no debt. Relative to the
market cap and the cash flow, there is
value here IMO, though it is not all
asset value. I agree you are counting
on cash flow to some extent. Also, looks
to me like Lone Star is one of the
strongest of the steakhouses financially,
just from a quick view of the competitors.
And it hasn't even advertised yet. Re:

to make this price a value.

Re: Pepsi spinoffs

I for one happen to agree with you on Tejon ranch. Much more risk than reward
and imho certainly not a value play.

I do disagree with the notion that the market is efficient. From my vantage
point (which I will admit is limited), you might be able to make the arguement
that the market is efficient in the aggregate but certainly not for many
stocks. Case in point, Dell computer - market capitalization is now 10x what it
was a year ago. But I have trouble that they were efficienctly valued then and
are efficiently valued now. What I believe happens is that the market tends to
excesses and is only rarely in a state of balance. Peoples fears / greeds
overwhelm rational decision making processes and thus many stocks can be priced
out of whack in comparison to the risk free interest rate and expected earnings
growth. But this is just my opinion

Now for the important questions. I also agree with the fact that adr's and I
include some of the foreign cef's which sell at discounts to nav in this
category as possibly the best area's to be in currently. My question for you is
which ones do you like and if possible why. thanks

I have enjoyed the commentary on this thread, but I do have one observation. I
believe that contrary information also can be included - for just as you can
find a value play on the upside, there is also just as much value to be found
in overpriced stocks and shorting ( or in my case because I am chicken) buying
puts on them.

As a matter of fact, if the consensus is that value is difficult to find on the
upside, than is makes sense it would be easier to find on the downside. just my

This has gotten on my value radar screen as well. This segment has been hotly
competititive, Outback - OSSI and Longhorn - RARE being major competitors. All
have their own challenges. STAR has recently experienced neg. same store sales
comps., thus the recent share price decline. Jamie Coulter (Chmn. and CEO) and
the rest of the mgmt. team has an excellent reputation. No doubt the Hudson

James,

Reviewed Qs & Ks on HYDEA/B last night and your analysis is right on, but I'm
going to pass. I already have three like this, all profitable and under BV, but
the growth factor isn't there so there's no price appreciation. Frustrating
because I have better places for monies.

This to me is the problem with value investing in this market. There's a lot of
good, well managed, profitable companies out there that don't draw investment
monies. BV, PE, cash, etc don't seem to be factors. Nothing seems to matter but
growth. It used to be a company losing money would sell below BV. Today, if
they are growing revs, the financial condition of the company is irrelevant.

For what it's worth,

Regarding ADRs, most of the worlds stock markets are greatly overpriced and
dropping quickly (several-percent per day in Asia) so I'm not going to buy in
until there's a bottom to the bleeding. CEFs are a great way to buy in at the

This is a greater fool's market. The market

it falls, it will be the greater fool theory that
takes it down hard. The market is not valuing
companies based on assets, free cash flows
to equity, or any other model. Personally,
the most unsophisticated investors I know are the ones making the most money.
Frustrating

Seems the strategy here is to acquire AGRO for
$3/share, await the exchange for ~ $3.45/share
in stock. Then you have shares in a company
that doesn't look too bad. What will these
shareholders do? I assume sell their new stock
and cash in on the 15% gain in favor of gambling
on an unknown stock. Could you get out of
JWS before the other AGRO shareholders? This
is an arbitrage play of which I'm wary. A better
deal would be to wait for the depression in JWS's
thinly traded stock after the exchange. Then you
can pick up JWS cheaper plus the assets of AGRO
cheaper. This is way-micro and difficult for me
to swallow. Could I get my transactions costs
low enough to make the deal worthwhile given
the risk? I don't know. There are several merger
plays that offer similar rewards out there. I
stay away from arbritrage because most often
the benefit does not outweigh the risk of
the deal not going through. The transaction
costs if this one doesn't go through will be
around 10% given the spread and commissions.

fifty cents never goes out of style. Trying to imitate the latest market fad is
a fool's game. IF INVESTORS ARE NOT VALUING STOCKS BASED ON REASON, THAT IS A
VALUE INVESTOR'S DREAM. IF YOU KNOW A STOCK IS CHEAP AND THE MARKET IS BEING
STUPID, THAT IS WHEN YOU BUY! My best investments have been deeply out of favor
at the time I bought, and the great investments I have researched and missed

You misunderstood. I was referring to JWC for value.

I looked at the JWC/AGRO deal when first announced and bought JWC @ 7.25 after
I researched the co. They appear solid. Not so much as a broker, but as
investment advisors. Listed as one of the top 200 small companies in U.S. for
management.

AGRO has the $3.70 value - mostly in T-bills, the rest in bank stocks and
similar. JWC owned 25% of the stock and is getting 75% of $4.7M assets (mostly
cash) in exchange for 400K shares of stock and - they get control of the Fund.
They are buying because the Fund is underperforming and not investing as
intended. It appears they put investors into it and are disappointed with the
results.

JWC is already very profitable, but I look for substantial growth as they
invest the Funds monies. A good buy @$8.25. I never thought about buying AGRO
and trying to play that game.

Just my opinion,
Ron

Mike, I expect that over the next few months there will be plenty of bargains
and you'll be able to do much better than 10%. There's alot of opinion on this
thread about the future of the market and here's my two cents.

A huge part of my investment strategy, apart from value, is to look at insider
buying. It's an indicator which rarely fails.

Over the past six months, the sell/buy ratio (based on total number of filings
with the SEC) has accelerated dramatically. I don't recall the last time
insider indications were so bearish.

Check out the following link to give you an idea of where we are:

http://www.argusgroup.com/index.html

Based on this graph, I believe we are in the begining of a bear market, which
could take the DOW as low as 5500-6000 range. For now, I don't expect a "crash"
beyond that, because econimic fndamentals are still too good. However, I do
expect a series of earnings disappointments.

P.S.

I've noticed areas with lots of insider buying are the electric utility and oil
sectors. I suspect you'll see oil/gas prices up in the second half of 97 into
98.

Good Investing

Chris: off subject, in response to your question:
I'm not sure how much exchange rates directly impact stock prices (look at the
history of exchange rates and the U.S. stock market) It depends on how
globalized the companies are in that market and who their primary trading
partners are. If the exchange rate simply becomes unstable enough that it
causes an increase in bond yield (higher risk in the market), that will lead
stocks, so bond yields (vs stock yields/price/growth rates) seem to be a better
leading indicator.

So if you were Hyde you'd go out and do a big advertising campaign? Do what
Nike has done. It certainly worked for them. Well, lets think about that for a
moment. I think this is essential in order to understand the game Hyde is in.
Hyde has less than $100 million of sales. Nike has over 70 times that. Nike
probably spends 10% of revenues on advertising, or about $700 million. You
still want to try to compete with them directly? Or do you think Hyde's
strategy makes some sense - operate below the radar screen through word of
mouth, very focused low-budget sponsorships and advertising in specialized
runners magazines. Sales growth would be nice, but they're not going to lose
big if they try to be Nike. Going into this one with the right expectations is
critical. The key to competing against Nike (or Coke or Intel) is to play a
different game. But thank you for reminding us that we are looking at a
business here, not just a bunch of assets and accounting figures.

I too liked your comments about value investing versus investing according to
market trends.

I've respected your opinions and analysis on various stocks in the past. More
often you have brought up reasons that prevented me from buying than to buy and
I appreciate it.

Because I respect your opinion, I have again reviewed HYDEA/B. I just can't
seem to see any reason to buy except the .54 BV. It's been more or less at this
level for 4 years. During that period EPS has dropped from .75 to .07 and they
even started to lose monies. Revs have been flat and will now drop. Stock has
been $4-6 and more recently closer to $4. History is not good.

I realize they have gotten rid of a losing division and it should help the
situation, but I still can't see earnings much above .30 annual and the price
much over $4.

I'd like to know why you feel so optimistic about share appreciation?

Bonnie,

It's Sat. and it's raining. I have been reviewing the past week's events and
find them relative to the posts you've been making.

3-4 weeks ago, many on this thread were posting about not being able to find
anything to buy. Many of us were sitting on cash because the stocks we owned
had become overvalued and we sold. These posts were made when the DOW was over
8000 and the bulls predicting it to go much higher. The DOW has now corrected
7-8%. I think you would find that value investors have shown minimal losses
with some of us showing gains during this period.

You now see stocks being posted to the list and value investors starting to
buy. To me, it's an indication of some market stability - not a turn around,
but a leveling. Because the 'herd' is running in that direction, the market
will likely continue to 'correct' and the value investors will begin putting
monies back in.

This isn't a strategy anyone uses for predicting the market. Most of us could
care less what the DOW or any other indicator is doing. All we care about is
whether individual companies are undervalued or not. No one refers to shorting,
puts, calls, etc. Most of us buy long into stocks we are willing to hold for
long term, but will sell if they become overvalued or overvalued in relation to
a better buy we've found.

Value investing requires review of SEC filings, news reports, company
management, and many other things, buying one out of every 30 or 40 stocks
reviewed. I get most of my picks from the SI lists. Value investing and SI have
got me into SNDK @ 8.5, DSWLF @ 14.75, NTAIF @ 13, ELAMF @ 8.5, SWST @ 16, ACTC
@ 3.25, and many others.

I don't think you'll convince many of us that we're doing it wrong.

Because the net assets are worth $7 a share. Nothing more than that. You

way. I don't know what is going to drive the shares up. I have found that when
a stock is this cheap sometimes it doesn't take anything at all, just a few
people discovering it and sharpening their pencils. And that seems to be what
is happening here this week. Let me be perfectly clear in the interest of not

James and Ron: I think you both make excellent points here. What I am trying -
learning - to do is to buy at least some number of shares when I see the value
and margin of safety. In the past with companies like Hyde, I might have had to
wait years for the payoff, but often gave up in frustration. So the negatives
are - for me - in a stock like Hyde:
the shame factor - like in June of next year when this stock is still at 4 and
I'm saying to myself what the heck ever possessed me to buy that ragamuffin
(There is no specific compelling reason for buying now - as Ron points out.)
the switch factor - Maybe two months from now, when the next great bargain
(McD's?) is spotted, and I want and wish to buy a big position but the only way
is to sell something... out goes Hyde.
the action factor - picture this: it's 18 months from today. Nothing - but nada
happening at Hyde. The SI thread that somebody eventually started is dead. The
Dow is at 12000 or 7000? - but nothing from Hyde. I need action! Out goes Hyde.

The way I overcome this - sometimes - maybe - is that I try to maintain a large
number of different stocks. Therefore, Hyde will not be so prominent that I am
confronted every day with the above three negative factors. Of course this will
limit my profit amount in $ on any one stock. But with enough "good" stocks,
the portfolio increases in value (I hope). I am learning to get away from the
"pull the trigger" mentality which I sometimes have and which I often see in
people who own only a few different companies. Instead of an all or nothing
decision, I am trying to at least pick up some shares. I bought HydeA (chose A
based on Mike's posts) on Fri. - a small amount - and will likely buy more next
week. I can see where this company - stock - can work for me - if I can be
patient. I can see where it wouldn't work for a large number of other value
investors. Paul

2. With $2+ cash, a very consistant "profitable" history in recent years, one
of the lowerst price to sales (1.1x) and a year low of $5+ >> the stock has
very limited downside.
3. It is the only sizeable semi company ($120+) whose stock is down 40% this
year and yet to recover while Xicor's business has an IMPROVING outlook
4. If Xicor makes its 12-14c, with increases in book to bill and manufacturing
capacity, Xicor could become an earnings growth stock for the next few quarters
with the possibility to reach 20c+ EPS per quarter potential quickly (Dec97?)
5. New product cycle looks promising.
6. If we pay 25% of the group multilples (8x sales for the semi group), Xicor
will be trading at $14, if half the group multiple ....
7. Bottome line: as a shareholder, I like this $7+ stock that could easily
become an earnings growth story with earning potential of 90c in a year and
with $2+ cash to provide comfort in a downmarket ...

Maya, took a quick look and its cheap relative to other chip makers, but looked
at as a RAM maker (more of a comodity) maybe not. From the look it doesn't
appear that management own much and that they have disappointed recently. There

James, not that I disagree with your view, but let me give you a case in point.
Was anyone wearing Adidas three years ago? Uhhh, no. They went from the top in
the late 70's/early 80's to the very bottom in the late 80's/early 90's. And I
mean they hit rock bottom. But, boy look at them now. A few key sponsorships of
upcoming basketball players (Kobe Bryant for example) and they are back in the
game. When you go out James, count the number of kids with Adidas on. I did
Saturday at the UT football game. While tailgating before the game I sat in my
chair sipping a cold one and watched the masses walk by for thirty minutes. My
tally, Adidas 40, Nike 36, Reebox 12, Asics 10, Brooks 1, Saucony 0. To bad
Adidas isn't public because they are backing up the truck to the bank. So, if
Adidas can do it, why couldn't Saucony. They've got their own space in Just For
Feet.
That's a start.

Jeff and anyone else: looking for feedback on NCR

Could this be another SGI type (or another Lucent)? PSR is .5 range. The key
point: A large cap, possibly unpopular stock with a Ken Fisher acceptable PSR.

Price about $35/sh.

Co. has strong niche in several areas (such as ATM, data warehousing)
$10/sh in cash, minimal LTD.

Weaknesses: no earnings, possible high P/BV. Maybe old - too old technology?
Also customer services and data services are 43% of rev. These seem to have
"thin" operating margins. (ref: IW 6/9/97, p.154)

Hi Paul - NCR is based in Dayton which is just down the road from me and I know
some things about the goings on within the company.

The people I talk to are pretty enthusiastic about the new management and
believe they they will FINALLY turn the company around.

Somebody discussed the company as a value stock within the past 2 months on
some CNNfn or CNBC program but I can't remember "who" or "where". They stated
that if you add up NCR's other businesses, you get the computer business for
free based upon the current share price.

As for thin margins, this works towards your favor in a turnaround situation
since small improvements in margins have big earnings affects.

I am still a bit skeptical at this point simply because they've been down for
so long. Even with good management, it takes time to change the corporate
culture and attitudes at the grunt level and it might never happen. DEC is a
good example this.

Jeff

______________________________________________________________________
KEY POINTS:
- We are initiating coverage of NCR. We like the story but are not rating the
stock until there is more trading history. The stock closed its first day of
when-issued trading at $36. We believe a
valuation range of $30-40 is reasonable.

- New management has refocused NCR on its core retail and finance markets. Most
exciting is the company's leadership position in data warehousing, where
Teradata has a pristine customer list thanks to the system's scalability.

- NCR has been the fastest turnaround in industry history; now the challenge is
to grow. We look for solid 9% revenue growth in 1997 and $0.77 per share on a
70% tax rate. In 1998, the top-line might rise 7% for EPS of $2.05 on a 50% tax
rate. Accelerating revenue growth and boosting the gross margin are imperative.
______________________________________________________________________
DETAILS:

SUMMARY AND INVESTMENT CONCLUSION

We are initiating coverage of NCR, though we are not rating the stock for now.
The company is being spun-out of AT&T ($39) through a 100% stock distribution;
regular way trading will begin January 2. We like the story and are impressed
with the restructuring success and positioning for growth.

Our Not Rated opinion is chosen because the stock has had just one day of
when-issued trading, closing at $36 per share. Our valuation analysis suggests
that a fair valuation range is $30-40 per share. In the next few months there
might be price pressure from selling by AT&T shareholders, such as index funds
and retail investors. Over time, however, we expect that the stock could do
quite well with earnings power of $4.00-5.00 by the end of the decade.
o OPERATING LEVERAGE IS SIGNIFICANT. NCR appears to have succeeded in the
fastest turnaround in industry history, but there is further to go. The way to
achieve management's goal of an upper-single operating margin is by gross
margin expansion since expense ratios are competitive. The current gross margin
of 27% through nine months should rise into the low- and possibly mid-30s
through a combination of product mix shift and process improvements. We believe
NCR has earnings power of $4.00-5.00 by the turn of the century.

o THE BALANCE SHEET IS CLEAN. AT&T spun off NCR with a great balance sheet that
should give customers confidence. At year end, cash could be $900 million, debt
just $90 million, and equity $1.2 billion. Inventory turns and receivable days
are decent and are likely to
improve. The company should be a modest cash generator.

Risks

o DATA WAREHOUSE COMPETITION IS INCREASING. Both server hardware and database
software rivals are rushing into data warehousing given the high growth rate
and attractive margins. The two concerns we have are (1) users opt for
databases perceived as open, such as Oracle ($48) and Informix ($25), and (2)
Teradata loses share in the medium and
lower end at 100-700 gigabytes, where symmetric multiprocessors and NUMA
systems are alternatives. NCR is deflecting these threats by making the
Teradata system more open and scaling it downward.

higher than margins on hardware. Example, IBM has increased their margins by

1999.. best returns j

Justin - Re: NCR - I disagree with the comments made by Morgan Stanley
regarding NCR and their foray into data warehousing. I spend a considerable
amount of time working with Oracle for big comapnies and I know at least one
company that has a Teradata system that is ready to boot it out the 15th story
window because of horrible performance and reliability. My bet on data
warehousing is SGI that now hosts 9 of the 12 Petrabyte-sized databases in the
US and hundreds of smaller ones. NCR isn't even on people's RADAR screens.

Interestingly enough, Morgan Stanley recently bought a pretty big SGI system to
run their operation having had several smaller SGI systems in the past.

However, some of the points they have made are pretty good - like the clean
balance sheet. IMO a great move for NCR would be to dump Teradata and grow the
rest of the company. I'll play devil's advocate here but I'm willing to look
more closesly at it. :-)

NWLIA is of interest to me, but probably not to anyone else here.

It's a life insurance co. Growing rapidly at maybe 3% per yr -g-. A very small
co. A me-too player, although it does have some representation in South
American market. I don't know how the new tax law will affect their annuity/tax
deferral instruments. (Probably not positively)

PSR below .9, pe = 7, no dividend. Sells for 88.5.

BV is 106 (and Yahoo is wrong again). Attraction is that price seems to track
BV. BV growth has gone from $35 to 54 to 69 to 79 to 89 to 101 last year. Price
to Book has ranged from .4 to .9 with most years being .8 to .9. Selling at .8
now, it's not a bargain compared to past years.

Still, if this apparently conservatively-run company can continue to muddle on,
the low pe and increasing BV provides a margin of safety - to anyone who has
patience to hold for a few years. I probably will buy a few shares although I
won't be happy about it. I figure I'll have to earn my profits on this one - a
fight of patience and fortitude - and again a test of the factors of shame,
dead-money, and boredom that we value investors (well, me anyway)have to deal
with. A test I often lose, especially with these fungible, intangible product
companies.

Any comments welcome. Now's the time for NWLIA to get its moment in the
spotlight before it returns to obscurity...

Paul,

NWLIA is very good value for equity investors. I've taken a small position
(still a lot at the price). I have bought another not selling at as good a
value, but much lower priced.

In the last 5.5 years, JWC has steadily grown equity from $2.8M to $20.5M
(after they acquire AGRO stock). BV/share has shown 65% compounded annual
growth from $.45 to $5.30 and will now go to $5.70. EPS has grown from $.34 to
$1.63 equaling 32% annual compounded growth. They will have $20M liquid assets
($5.50/share). They had a 45% stock buyback in '96 and have voted to buy
another 8%.

AGRO - supposed to be a growth fund but has instead put monies into T-Bills and
other low growth assets. JWC owned 25%. Because it was underperforming, they
decided to buy the fund with stock exchange and manage it themselves.

JWC has been rated one of the top 200 best managed small companies in the U.S.
If they continue past growth rate, EPS could equal the current price of $8
within 5 years. I believe the investments they will make with the AGRO assets
will significantly increase this growth.

Like NWLIA, it's one you park in the corner where you can see it, but aren't
being tempted to get rid of it.

For what it's worth,
Ron

Too much going on this morning. NTAIF falling and it may get to my price. Have
large positions in AMTD and SWST, following them up with stops to reduce. If
they sell, will try for NWLIA. I have done well with the brokerages and was
looking for a new sector. Companies selling term life sound interesting. NWLIA
definitely underpriced considering their history.

I did add to my JWC position this morning. I reviewed further. Ifthe market

As of an hour ago, my interest in AMTD became less as 2/3 of my shares sold. I
now have a $1.875 position.

I think they are still feeling their way. It would seem that consolidation
would reduce costs and improve efficiency, but (IMO) their biggest problem and
concern should be growth exceeding capability, similar to AOL this Spring.

I'm leery of AMTD long term. If the market goes bearish, they'll have problems.
The core of their business is trading unlike firms that manage accounts. This
makes them more susceptible to market trends. With their narrow profit margins,
earnings would suffer. Long term I prefer a company like SWST or JWC.

Hi Paul - Re: NCR

I have done some checking with people I know in the business on NCR and here is
what I found.

1. As I stated earlier, the Teradata box appears to be a boat anchor. I showed
the Morgan Stanley note to a few senior technical managers and they asked what
they were smokin'. These are at companies that were approached by NCR to buy
their machines. Their database machine is literally a box full of pentium IIs!
They regarded it as pretty exotic and not appealing to the general masses
interested in data warehousing. If NCR decides to put more money into it, there
could be a lot of red ink. This would be my biggest fear as an investor.

2. A middle manager from another group inside NCR but not in the Teradata unit
stated that new management has been doing drastic things to kick out AT&T
managers and everybody that thinks that way. They are doing concrete things to
rein in costs and kill unprofitable projects.

I'm getting a bit more interested.

Paul,

Hope you had a chance to look at JWC. I haven't found a downside and I know
there's one somewhere.

NWLIA - I've tried to analyze their 10Q/Ks and have had my usual success when
doing insurance companies. They write their reports like they do their
policies.

From what I gather, the insurance portion of the company hasn't been growing
but their investment strategy has been excellent. They issue AAA rated bonds,
then put the monies into mortgage and corporate loans at a higher rate. This
has given them over 37% growth the last five years. Selling at .85 BV and 6.65
earnings, I'd say this is an excellent buy, particularly for long term in a
taxable account.

Downside - I can only see one. If they haven't protected themselves against
higher interest rates, they could get burnt. I don't think this is a factor
because they issue long term bonds and I don't see rates climbing any
substantial amount for many years.

I think you've found an underpriced winner. Price has been climbing, but it
still looks undervalued considering BV, PE, & growth. I've been doing a lot of
selling and have built cash again. Don't normally buy stocks this pricey, but
this one looks right.

For what its worth,
Ron
PS - It traded at my price and quantity and I thought it was my shares. When I
checked my account I found it wasn't me. Too bad because it got away from me
and I wasn't going to chase it. I would have liked to see the quick gain. Have
put order back in and might chase a little if I have to.
