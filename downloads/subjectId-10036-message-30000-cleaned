MSFT , i still own some MSFT (more than a stub) and don't like the bid for
Yahoo, but it's too late to sell, IMO.

After the bid MSFT lost almost 105 of it's market cap - that's 28B$. Yahoo bid
is for 45B$, so if you subtract the lost market cap from the bid you get Yahoo
now for 17B$. if you further more subtract the cash and LT investment (a total
of 6B$) in yahoo's balance sheet from the remaining 17B$ you get the yahoo
business now for a mere 11B$. this is a simplistic way of viewing things, but
if you believe that MSFT was worth 300B before the bid they are certainly worth
280B$ now.

In my opinion they simply trying to buy Yahoo because they were weakened and
they need to bulk up in the internet space to stay inn the game against Yahoo.
If the deal get's consumed than the combined Yahoo and MSFT will still only
have 1/2 the search market share of GOOG. This will not be enough to threaten
GOOG dominance but it will be enough that if GOOG does mistakes, MSFT+YHOO
combo could be able to exploit this assuming they have their own house in
order.

Somewhat comforting to read in Wall St. Journal of many pro value investors
"loosening their wallets" now and at least somewhat reducing cash by making

In my view, these guys are different in what they buy. Given the different

I looked at GSK results. P/E wise it is cheap, but I really don't see happy
future for the pharma side. I think the interesting parts of GSK are vaccines
and consumer healthcare segments. Unfortunately, that's about 25% of GSK and
that's not enough to carry the rest of the company.

The ROE part is tough for me to do due to UK accounting conventions. I'll have
to wait for US conversion at Yahoo which will take a long time to appear.

So I am still going to hold AZN and GSK for now, but I plan to get rid of them
if they show any strength in the future.

Hi Jurgis - Based on your review how does SNY compare to GSK. I sold GSK a few
years back and locked in a pretty good return. The only drug companies I have
bought recently are JnJ and SNY.

I sold 1/2 of my position in BMY in early 2007 for $32 and was thinking about
buying some back when it recently traded in the low $20's last week. I bought
some SNY instead.

Drug companies I currently hold include:
BMY, PFE, MRK, JNJ, SNY

The dividend payout for each are pretty good too.

EKS,

It's a difficult question IMO. I have never closely considered SNY, since its
ROE was always pretty low. Now, this is tough to compare to GSK/AZN ROE, since
you cannot use UK numbers for GSK/AZN that are using different accounting rules
than US (and France?). But if you look historically at Yahoo numbers, GSK has
had much higher income on pretty similar equity than SNY.

Also if you look at Yahoo P/Es and dividend payouts, GSK/AZN both have lower
PEs and higher dividend payouts than SNY.

On the other hand, Buffett owns SNY and not AZN or GSK. So you have a strong
support from his side in your choice. Also, SNY earnings growth was just
incredible 2004-2006 at least per Yahoo again. Looking at 9 month 2007 SNY
results (not on Yahoo, but per company itself), it seems that they don't have
any growth for this year.

So I don't really know. But IMHO, the pharma future is very very cloudy. You
have mentioned before that you would be happy with 6% organic growth in pharmas
for the coming years. I am not sure that even 6% is achievable. I think we are
looking for continuous drop of sales and income as drugs come off the patents
and are not replaced.

But then, yes, I should have sold AZN and GSK earlier.

I think that JNJ is different, since a large portion of that company is not
pharma related. From that point of view, vaccines and healthcare products also
help (GSK and SNY). They just don't help enough IMO.

SNY, GSK AZN -
I think ROE is useless in this case. SNY has tons of goodwill from the merger
of Aventis/Sanofi on the balance sheet, which depresses ROE. on top of that the
goodwill is depreciated at the rate of almost 2B Euro/year. It' best to just
use adjusted earnings, which is given out in the earnings presentations. based
on PE or EBITDA/EV GSK, AZN and SNY are valued about the same.

Besides valuation, i look at the pipeline and near term product issues (patent
exirations). GSK has obvious problems with the latter, SNY had those last year
(Plavix) but that's over now and AZN has the Nexium problem.

Then there is the pipeline. AZN looks like they have nothing (only 6 entities
in Phase III), SNY has 25 and GSK has a similar amount. Even after adjusting
for the different size it seems that AZN is going to have problems in the
future. they also have a fair amount of debt due to the Medimmune acquisition.
After a customary look GSK early/mid stage pipeline looks better than SNY and I
think the stock is interesting after the near term challenges are evident. GSK
also has the largest consumer/ vaccine sector (measure by % of revenue) from
all three, so i think LT they are going to be OK.

Quote:

In about three years, he has helped transform Microsoft from a miser that
socked away money for a rainy day into a spendthrift, and he has successfully
challenged the philosophy that Microsoft, given enough time and resources,
should build its own technology to take on all comers.

Liddell has completed nearly 50 deals since joining the company in May 2005.
His boldest move yet, Microsoft's $41.9 billion offer to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O:
Quote, Profile, Research), would use up nearly all of a legendary cash
stockpile Liddell inherited.

Those reserves are sure to grow again, but now Liddell wants to issue debt for
the first time in Microsoft's 33-year history.

"I believe in being disciplined but aggressive," Liddell described himself by
e-mail.

-------------------

I am afraid that I don't see this transformation as positive for Microsoft. I
don't see the CFO spending billions and billions on deals as "being

ive read a bunch of articles on AIG from seeking alpha, and perhaps I am
missing the boat on this, however to me this sounds like a huge overreaction
from people I thought were very knowledgable. I dont even understand the
comment of material weakness by the auditors. My understanding now that was
that there was a difference in how two markets assessed the default risk of
certain exposure. The aig calculations chose the more optimal one. To me that
makes some sense because if they were going to liquidate or protect their
position they would have done so in the cheapest way possible. I guess now that
the cheaper market has either adjusted or disappeared, that benefit also
disappeared but that on the face of it doesnt sound like a material weakness
but a change in pricing. Meanwhile AIG is a real business outside of what they
do in the cdo market, a business that had ebitda of $32Billion last year. I
find it hard to believe that even a $10 Billion mark to market loss would
caused the steep decline in the share price given the company's potential for
international growth. After all this will not be a recurring loss. So now I
wonder to what extent the company is continuing to be punished for the
Greenberg era malfeasance.

first of all, lets remember that these are non cash losses. Im not sure why you
are surprised that this was done as an SEC filing. I believe that this may even
be a requirement when an auditor points out their belief of a material weakness
in control or whatever. Lastly, it seems clear from the language that there is
a disagreement with the auditors and in this case I side with AIG. I think that
the methodology they used while not conservative seems logical to me at the
time, and if the situation had not deteriorated in the past two months I dont
believe that the auditors would have raised the issue. To me that is 20/20

I believe Obama's proposed health care solution is more "private sector"

Their service is easy, provides FDIC insurance and is integrated with their

I have already realized that rates will continue to drop and it can be
dangerous to shop yield. For higher yields I am researching preferred

the credit market, may soon claim a new victim: closed-end funds.

J.P. Morgan analysts said Thursday they anticipated the costs from some of
these funds, which had issued auction-rate securities as a source of cheap
financing, could increase after the market for these securities nearly dried
up.

"The cost of leverage will rise for closed-end funds," J.P. Morgan analysts
Kenneth Worthington and Timothy Shea wrote in a report, noting that these
higher costs "should weigh on returns."

Closed-end funds are different from their cousins, mutual funds, because they
do not continuously offer shares for sale. Firms such as Eaton Vance Corp. (EV)
, Nuveen Investments, Calamos Advisors and BlackRock Inc. (BLK) manage
closed-end funds that have used the auction-rate market for a source of
funding. They've done this by issuing what's known as auction-rate preferred
shares.

"Auction failures means this preferred market may go away," the analysts said.

From muni bonds to Bristol-Myers

Once a large but formerly low-profile segment of the financial markets,
auction-rate securities are the latest investment vehicles to convulse,
singeing investors and cutting off financing for issuers. Municipalities, whose
bonds made up many of these vehicles, have seen the rates on their debt
skyrocket after investors have shunned recent auctions.

"It just speaks to the interconnectedness of capital markets," said Tanya
Azarchs, banking analyst at Standard & Poor's. "This has been a little like
pulling on a string."

'A year ago, no one talked about or thought about this market. It had been
functioning the way it had for 20 years.'

Tanya Azarchs, Standard & Poor's

When running smoothly, the $331 billion market works the following way. An
investor such as a corporate treasurer buys auction-rate securities, often
municipal bonds but also sometimes preferred stock or corporate bonds. These
have long-term maturities, but act like short-term investments because the
holders can sell them at weekly or monthly auctions, when their rates reset.
Some investment managers regarded them as a cash alternative for investors
looking for safe but liquid investments.

Investors ranging from family trusts to large corporations like Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. (BMY) and 3M Co. (MMM) had used auction-rate securities to get a
little more yield on their savings for not much more risk -- or so it seemed.

"A year ago, no one talked about or thought about this market," added Azarchs.
"It had been functioning the way it had for 20 years."

A manager of a money-market fund that has an obligation to buy only short-term,
highly rated securities could choose auction-rate securities as a place to park
cash, for instance.

Closed-end funds, for their part, issued auction-rate preferred stock and used
the proceeds to buy longer-term instruments for common shareholders. This use
of leverage boosted the yield for common shares in these funds, J.P. Morgan
said.

Bidders skip town

The problem for issuers and their investors is that the door has recently shut
on those investment auctions. Investors, skittish about the unraveling in other
parts of the credit market, have sat them out.

With roughly half of the outstanding auction-rate securities held by
individuals, "a significant, albeit likely short-lived liquidity crunch is
again emanating out of the credit markets," wrote Banc of America Securities
analyst Jeffrey Rosenberg.

Past auction failures has culminated in the refusal of brokers to make a
markets in these securities, Banc of America Securities said. About 80% of
auctions failed on Wednesday, the brokerage estimated.

The link between auction-rate securities and the disruptions in other parts of
the credit market is a complicated one, but it all traces back to the surprise
surge in mortgage defaults that started last year.

Losses in pools of these soured mortgages, structured securities known as
mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, not only racked
up big losses at investment banks; they also jacked up claims on the companies
that insured holders of the structured securities. With a load of claims to
repay, the financial standing of these bond insurers, most notably Ambac
Financial Group (ABK) and MBIA Inc. (MBI) , suddenly looked shaky. Concerns
about the credit ratings of the insurers, by proxy, made everything else they
had insured looked vulnerable -- including municipal bonds.

Those municipal bonds, issued by school districts and county governments, are
the connection with the recent collapse in auction-rate securities. They're a
big part of that market. Now the risk that some of these municipal bonds might
not keep their high credit ratings is keeping investors away from auction-rate
securities.

"It's more about the supply-demand balance than about any deterioration in
municipal-bond credits," said S&P's Azarchs.

She expects that some of the investment banks that arranged these deals --
including Citigroup Inc. (C) , Goldman Sachs Group (GS) , JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(JPM) , Lehman Brothers Holdings (LEH) and Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) -- will
take some of these securities onto their balance sheet as an extension of
goodwill to their municipal-bond clients.

"There could be some write-downs this quarter from any of these programs,"
Azarchs commented. Besides auction-rate securities, similar upsets have
happened in structured vehicles known as variable-rate demand bonds and
tender-option bonds. "But I don't expect them to be really large -- not like
the fourth quarter."

For the closed-end funds, auction failures may mean the market for auction-rate
preferred stock issuance has shut as well.

J.P. Morgan estimated that funds at Nuveen and Calamos Advisors have some of
the most leverage, putting their funds more at risk for higher costs. In a
worst-case scenario, if Eaton Vance were to deleverage its closed-end funds
that used these securities, that could cost the publicly traded company 10
cents 15 cents a share annually, the bank's analysts said.

Can you tell me why Buffett's share is not disclosed in BRKA's 13F form? It's
definitely not because it's too small... All I find while searching is 2006
articles of Buffett buying some Tesco, but I do not see anything in his 2007
13Fs. Did he sell it?

BTW, SWCEY position is not disclosed either, I am not sure why, though it might
have been acquired after 12/31.

On the other news of Buffett buys, his most recent 13F was released today. It's
somewhat underwhelming. Buffett bought KFT during 2007. However, I find it
difficult to find value in KFT: margins low, ROE low, balance sheet looks like
crap - although it should look that way, since Altria put a lot of debt on it.
The only positive is that they are slowly slowly paying off debt. 38b of
intangible assets, 7b debt, theoretical equity of 28b, but negative tangible
assets. Oh well. Not very low PE, 3.7% dividend per Yahoo... Not sure I would
want to follow Buffett.

Buffett also bought more KMX. Another one where I don't see great value. Low
margins, cleanish balance sheet.

Finally, press is making a big thing of BRKA's GSK purchase. It is really
funny, since the position is very very tiny. I will hold my own very tiny GSK
position though and see what happens. :)

Hi Jurgis - Buffet's Tesco investment first came to my attention in his letter
to shareholders in March 2007 when he announced that Berkshire started a
position at the end of 2006 valued at $1.82 Billion. He added to the position
in 2007 with two additional purchases that brought his position up to $4
Billion. These holdings were not detailed in any of his 13G filings when I
scanned Berkshire's insider holdings
(http://holdings.nasdaq.com/asp/OwnerPortfolio.asp?FormType=OwnerPortfolio&CIK=
001067983&HolderName=BERKSHIRE+HATHAWAY+INC) I do not know why it is not on the
insider holding report. Perhaps it has something to do with Tesco being a
foreign company.

Notice that in his most recent filing he added to holdings in U.S. Bancorp
(USB), Burlington Northern Santa Fe , Carmax (KMX), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC),
and trimmed stakes in Ameriprise (AMP) and Iron Mountain (IRM).

I plan to watch Kraft as his recent buy represents a pretty large stake (8.6%)
and he probably sees some "hidden" value in the company not obvious in the
balance sheet.

You might be right that Buffett does not have to disclose shares of foreign
companies in 13F although I wonder why he had to disclose GSK shares. Maybe
because he bought GSK ADRs while he bought Tesco in Britain. I don't really
know. I am also wondering about his Posco PKX holdings that were rumored but
again there is no disclosure.

USB and WFC adds are tiny, so I would not make much of it, even though I also
got some USB and WFC.

You are right, I forgot BNI add. However, with current BNI runup, I am hesitant
to add to my tiny position.

Regarding Kraft, I agree that he sees something there. On the other hand, I am
not sure Buffett's low margin buys are very much on target. For example, I
still think that McLane purchase was not very good move, although it is tougher
to extract its performance from BRKA reports now. I think that KFT is more
interesting that KMX though although both have pluses and minuses.

I'm in London right now and love Tesco. Right in town they're about like a
QuikTrip but several times larger and with higher quality product. I can go to
the one by the office daily for a sandwich and go to the one by the flat
occasionally to stock up on groceries. And they're constantly busy. Built to

i hope you had a good time in England. Any investment opportunities spotted

overall, I have been doing more selling than buying. LMC is gone due to those

Spekulatius, I've got a very good possibility for you (given that you are a
person who can hold on to good stocks for a decent period of time, e.g. NSRGY).
It's a European (continental), not British though.
=====================================
For British, BP has come down to where I started my exploratory position, and
I'll likely be adding more. In past, a poorly-run company. Now, with new guy,
maybe some changes. A p/e typical of the integrated oils (8-11 maybe). With
this you get an okay dividend, and BP's expertise (leadership?) in lng. I'm
also holding BP Prudhoue Bay in a retirement account. It's a royalty trust,
which means for me, if it were in a regular account, I'd have to file K-1 tax
forms, which I don't want to be involved with. In a retirement account, I don't
have a problem, UNLESS I get income from this and others that totals over
$1000/yr. So my BPT position is and will remain, small.
I have a few shares of UUPLY, primarily a regulated water utility in north
England. It also has a non-regulated business that "provides connections and
metering services to other businesses, and operates utility concessions in
Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland, the Philippines and Australia."

I have BCS on my watch list. Not sure what I will do. I like the relatively low
stock price and high div. yield ---if it doesn't get cut, and Barclay's size.
Their involvement or not with subprime, etc. is worrisome though.
========================================
The European stock I'm liking now is Pargesa.

Several professional value investors(e.g. Jean-Marie Eveillard), and I have
been buying Pargesa, PRGAF. It is a European company that takes large stakes in
other big European companies and tries to influence their management.
http://www.pargesa.ch/sujet_en/societe/societe.html

Note the substantial companies in its portfolio: Total, Lafarge, Pernod, Suez:

http://www.pargesa.ch/sujet_en/particip/particip.html

PRGAF always seems to sell below the assets of their holdings. The positive is
the asset/diversification aspect for the margin-of-safety with that. A negative
is the gap to nav never seems to close enough, and can be very wide:

http://www.pargesa.ch/sujet_en/action_par/action.html

I contrast this stock with Dale Baker's 50% Gains thread pick of WNDLF. While
WNDLF takes equity positions in industrial companies like Saint-Gobain (cf.
PRGAF's Lafarge), WNDLF emphasizes its entrepreneurial bent - taking 100% of
smaller companies (later selling them), and trying to influence larger
companies by being their biggest shareholder. I believe WNDLF and PRGAF are
each controlled by a wealthy familiy - in each case, it's their vehicle for
investing their wealth.

There's also Dale Baker pick of 3i Group. It's British, and specializes in
private equity. I don't follow it: I can't understand its prospects,
businesses, financials, and I'm not set up to buy stocks directly on the London
exchange.
Sorry I didn't buy WNDLF when first mentioned by Dale Baker years back; I have
had an order in recently, although stock has not dropped to my price. WNDLF has
been the better stock performer - almost tripling over the past four years vs.
PRGAF not even doubling.
Perhaps PRGAF is a little more conservative. I like their holdings in large
companies related to oil/gas, water, cement/construction, wines/liquors ---
almost a concentrated mini-fund selling at below net assets. It's a stock that
might be one that could be bought and put away for five years with some
expectation that it'll do okay. That's my intent and expectation anyway.

Somehow these hospitals have got to get better control over bad debt expense.
Somehow, they will. (I hope.) The company has a positive, in that it's
monopoly-like ("In almost every case, each of the 49 LifePoint hospitals
located throughout the United States serves as the only acute-care facility in
a community."), which is also its weakness. What can they do as the only
"acute-care" provider, toss out emergency room patients because they don't have
health insurance or money or credit cards?

So, profit margins and roe continue to slip year over year.

But at a forward p/e under 10, a p/bk of about .88, a psr of .52, the thing's
an obvious buy to me. But of course, I believed same when stock was at higher

Kraft discussion. Mr. Buffett has had a long-history with Kraft. Going from my
poor memory, it seems to me he had a large KFT position and got out when MO
bought the company. I seem to remember he bought his Kraft shares at a p/e of
around 10. This is in the day when interest rates were much higher (maybe
8-10%) than now.

So for Buffett followers, no surprise that he's been interested and has
reentered with a substantial position. I like to follow Mr. Buffett in his
picks. I just don't get KFT though as a buy now with its current p/e (over 15),
its stodgy growth prospects, and the grocery chain generics competition. Maybe
it's the possibility of growth through acquisitions or the safety of having
great food brands that Americans always will eat - Kraft cheeses, Oreos, etc.

Stock's too rich for me. Or I'm not understanding the company/prospects

Strong balance sheet. I calculate ADPT net cash per share as cash plus cash
equivalents plus short term investments minus short term and long term debt,
all divided by shares outstanding.

So I have net cash/sh (with Yahoo 31 Dec. '07 numbers) as: (214.7M + 384.7 -
275.4)/121.
Which is $2.68/sh. With a stock price at $2.75, a buyer now in a sense gets the
business almost for free. Of course, that business is an erratic-performing
cigar-butt. -g-

In another calculation, I conclude the stock is selling below net current
assets. Stock would have to come down closer to $2 though for it to be a Ben
Graham buy (i.e buying at 2/3 of nca).

Stock is at about a 14 year low. Just how low can it go? Well, maybe to a 16 or
18 year low. -g-
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=ADPT&t=my&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

I might add more again if stock continues to drop to 2/3 nca. Always though
with these things, keeping it a very small position within a diversified

per Yahoo numbers:
GTN- EV/EBITDA: 9.8
TVL- EV/EBITDA 9.0

CBS is a content provider+TV which is probably a higher quality business than

GTN. Yes, GTN not cheap on some measures. Especially so when doing comparison's
to recent public sales of stations.

Before I bought I did use this for a very rough comparison:
http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/fcc-oks-clear-channel-tv-station/story.as
x?guid=%7B96002038-DB47-44E9-930F-A168B6752B3D%7D

11/30/07: "Clear Channel Communications Inc.'s $1.26 billion sale of 35
television stations to Newport Television."

GTN: has 36 television stations and enterprise value $1.21 billion.

Assuming there are some better and some worse stations in each group, I'll
further assume in dealing with 35-36 stations, the value per station average
out about the same. So I conclude that GTN stock is trading only slightly below
what a motivated private party would be willing to pay for GTN stock and net
debt in order to get GTN's 36 stations. So yes, GTN is not cheap (by such an
evaluation).

However, I note now that TVL has 31 stations and that TVL's enterprise value is
$1.43B. Fewer stations than GTN, yet higher enterprise value than GTN. Very
crudely: GTN with 36 stations and enterprise value 1.21B, is the cheaper stock
when the focus is on assets (assuming sample size of 31 or so normalizes any
differences among individual stations). If the focus is on earnings, then TVL
(EV/EBITDA) shows to be the less expensive one.

Again, very rough analysis. And I am not considering individual company's
strengths/weaknesses, e.g. HD capability, ratings, ancillary businesses, etc.

CBS, TVL might be buys too. I don't know. I do like GTN for its locations in
college towns, for the persistent insider buying, for its relatively low stock
price (relative to its historical prices), and the fact that several value
funds seem to be holding shares.

Saint Gobain itself looks like a decent pick. A little bit stodgy but quite

turn down (England, Ireland and Spain are already in a downturn).

I am exploring some small cap/mod cap opportunities in Europe. My preference is
with large caps until i see the bottom but the stock market downturn has
created some opportunities that look quite attractive to me.

BCS looks very cheap but it's located in Britain <g>. the climate in Britain

I've been watching your recent buying binge with great interest. Whether or not
many of these cheap stocks you are buying now turns out in retrospect to have
been a great buying opportunity remains an open question in my mind that will
only be answered in time, perhaps years from now. Your conviction that this
represents a great buying opportunity for the undervalued and unloved dredges
of recent market performance is at least a valid point of view. I'm not quite
that adamant the market lows of January represented a bottom that will not be

KFT. That's the problem, I pretty much agree with you. There is also an issue
that I am not sure where the food producers will end up in current agro
commodity boom. It's tough to say whether they can pass the price increases to
the consumers or whether they have to lower the margins. Or maybe they already
have squeezed their margins and now they will inflate the prices. Not sure.

I have the same issue with oil refiners and I try not to be overly invested in
them, although I have some refineries via COP and IGE.

Welcome back Paul. I came over and recently saw you sold some AIRT. Did you
sell after the earnings because of the stock being of micro cap exposure? After
the recent earnings release I've actually added some more. Looking forward, I
view it as being an even better value now. Based on forward earnings and a
recent backlog addition for Global. No question in my mind micro caps and small
caps are not favored in weak market conditions.

I've been sitting on the sidelines and cautious on the market until only
recently. Due to recent market conditions, I'm for the most part trying to
stick to more valued orientated buys. I've added to GFF even though I'm sitting
with a total position loss on it. I don't view it as a value based on earnings,
but value of the companies assets. ICOC and POL I view as a values based on a
recovery of forward earnings and asset values. I believe slowing economic
conditions have been a recent weakness in these stocks and many others stocks
with global industrial exposure. I've been looking still at SEH, but they way
overpaid for a recent acquisition witch used to be owned by Wellman. I actually
still own a very small position in WLM. I'm fairly sure I'll be writing the
rest off this year. SEH has come down in price since then. SHLM has alway had
strong European exposure. Most in this competitive group can benefit from a
weak dollar when economic conditions improve. I can also say I've been wrong
many times.

I also saw Mr. Buffett or lets say Charlie Munger have recently added Kraft.
This one surprises me. I though he would have picked UL over Kraft. I sold my
UL last year at a tidy profit, but wouldn't mind re-entering if it reaches
oversold conditions. It could be because of his P&G exposure why he would not
buy a UL position? Kraft is also ironic that Kraft once owned Duracell Battery
now owned by him through P&G's purchase of Gillette. I also thought Gillette
way overpaid for Duracell (Around 7 billion). It also looks like Duracell might
be on the block for sale again by P&G.

ADPT is one of the perennial net-nets. Of course that does not mean that the
stock won't work out at some point. I remember some net net from 1997 or
something where it had languished for 5 years or so and then shoot up as a
buyout or restructuring or something. Some cooking utensil company I think. :)
The drawback of ADPT is that if they are on the lagging end of technology curve
they may not have a cash cow business if they don't re-innovate.

Richard,

Do you have more insight into the markets where SHLM (and I guess ICOC and POL)
operate? It seems that GFF also has a subsegment in this area? What are the
drivers for poor performance recently and why should this recover going
forward?

With GFF I guess the issue is mostly construction exposure.

I find GFF and SHLM interesting from net-net point of view. Need to look more.
Thanks for bringing them to our attention. :)

You might be referring to GAI:

Still a buy imo based on cash/sh. vs. stock price and its attempt at
diversifying its businesses - electronic components, and in 2009 into an EMS
business (electronic manufacturing services, e.g. like a Jabil or Flextronics.)

Not sure what I've done with this. Sold some at recent past pop, have bought
more. I show I have now shares from '05, '06, and a recent buy at $3.82 in
December.

The past 18-24 months I've not done well with the nca stocks I've been holding.
It looks like I have about ten of them- SLTC, DAGM, INHX, etc. They seem to go
nowhere or down. Perhaps it's the market or perhaps my selections have been
poor. I'm hanging on for curiosity and trying to remain aware of net-nets as a
possible Ben Graham operation. Holding just minuscule amounts, so it's not
really about $ gains or $ losses. (But of course, I want gains, not losses

Anializer, yes, I'd say I'm early in my buys.

I buy value stocks when they are values. (Well, when they look like values to
me anyway.) A simple idea and method. I don't try to pick market bottoms or
wait for recoveries or stabilization in stocks.

It's the typical pain endured with value investing. You are often buying when
the stock is declining, and the stock continues its decline after your
purchase. Ugh. Much more fun and enjoyable of course buying when the stock is
rising, when you are seeing instant profits after your buy as the stock
continues up.

In this market, I am usually assuming the stocks I buy will go down after I
make my purchase. So of course I try to correct for that. By scaling into
purchases, trying do be diversified, trying to look past the valley of
gloom&doom.

Jurgis. SHLM and POL have cut down US plant exposure. POL has focused on China
and overseas acquisitions. POL has a much improved balance sheet. Just from my
memory SHLM has a big portion of it's sales (European exposure)overseas (dollar
weakness advantage). This is why I believe SEH has suffered more in the
economic downturn. US plant exposure. This is where IMO in the past they have
eaten SHLM's lunch. You can due more from web sight exposure for specifics.
SHLM has stuck to where its profit margin is strong and why I believe it cut
down its US exposure. ICOC has been strong overseas. Although smaller than the
competition I mention. They had a better longer termer focus (Overseas
exposure)(higher profit margins) and took advantage early on globalization in
markets they serve.

GFF has Brazilian operations for part of its plastic operations. A loss for the
quarter (housing exposure) is for the recent weakness IMO. P&G is a big GFF
customer (plastics for diapers). Once owned a AMEX stock called Blessings that
was (big in diapers). GFF exposure to new home construction has been
devastating for their housing exposure.

They have scaled back on overcapacity by plant consolidation. Still might be
more write offs coming (not finished). All I can say their housing exposure is
a core business . I believe their a leader in garage doors and will wait for a
recovery. The Telephonics division is their gem (although flat for now). I
still believe they might sell the Telephonics division if they get a great
offer. IMO- Any part of the company can easily operate as a stand alone company
if broken up. IMO-Most of the companies I mentioned have speculative appeal due
to global industry consolidation of competitors and past activist shareholders
due to weak stock performance.

My caveats apply to what I say.

GFF. I liked (bought) GFF during the housing boom because they were diversified
in several businesses I liked: housing and military electronics. I especially
liked their garage door business: they made large garage doors (larger than
"normal") which would accommodate large SUVs,boats, rvs in new houses that were
built to have big garages as a selling feature.

Times change. My view too. Now the garage business is a drag, and the stock
even at current low price, still seems to me not attractive enough based at my
glance of the remaining businesses, or the financial ratios I like to use.

I'll pass on SHLM. I've done that before with SHLM (failed to buy) and been
wrong each time though, it seems to me.
Just that SHLM's raw material costs are based on oil prices, and since I have
so many oil stocks, I feel I am betting too much against myself by having a
stock like SHLM in my portfolio. I face this every time I look at my portfolio
and see the airline stocks in it. Although with the airline stocks, they look
more beat down and attractive to me than does SHLM.

All jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

Like you Paul, I've owned both in the past. I do own GFF, POL, and ICOC, now.
SHLM and SEH still on the watch list.

I believe your a dead on, on the exposure to oil prices. I have been wrong on
that also, but what I do believe in this regard to oil exposed cost structured
industries. They will all be stronger this time around in a recovery. Just in
time inventories, industry consolidation, will help them maintain and possibly
expand profit margins when demand picks up.

I must also mention. I have no exposure to oil stocks currently. I've never
owned a pure play airline stock (EVER)(air freight forwarders yes). In all my
investing years. The only financial industry exposure I've had are a few
regional bank stocks, and one financial stock named McDonald that was acquired
by Key bank. Although diversified, I am weighted and at the mercy of stocks
exposed to economically exposed downturns. That must be why I like value stocks
and why value investing take patience. <G>

Richardred, basing the investment on this is risky: "They will all be stronger
this time around in a recovery. Just in time inventories, industry
consolidation, will help them maintain and possibly expand profit margins..."

The reason is that input costs are likely over time to be the same for all
competitors. That is, it's oil. Some companies can hedge the price, some can
hedge better than others, but imo, ultimately the raw material costs (oil) will
be the the same for all competitors. Secondly, the output sales price will be
the same for all competitors. That is, the resins they sell are fungible too-
no difference among competitors, they'll all have the same chemical
formulation.

So one is left with small differences. Maybe transportation costs. Maybe not
even that difference is meaningful, if the SHLM plants are close to their raw
material (oil) sources and competitors' plants are close to those same sources
too.

If the input costs are the same and if the output products are about the same,
that leaves the competitive advantage to the processing efficiencies and
customer service. Labor costs, if they're not the same among competitors, are
likely to be only a small portion of cost-of-goods sold. Which ultimately means
that ALL the competitors are using SAP (or equivalent) to understand/track
costs, processing bottlenecks; all the competitors are taking a stab at JIT
manufacturing; all the competitors are attempting to streamline their
structures, etc. etc. Nobody ever has a sustainable competitive advantage.

Still, the products seem necessary, and if the business is cyclical (imo, it
is), the falling earnings now may be indicate it is a favorable time to buy one
or more of these companies, ie. POL and/or SHLM.

For me though, rightly or wrongly, I'll avoid, at least for now.

I still have about half my small position. Stock now $11.90; I'm using now
about $13-$13.25 as about top price I'd be willing to consider it at as a value
investment.

I bought it as a value play. Looking at it closer after I sold, I see the
company is consistently profitable business with low d/e. ROE fluctuates, but
can be pretty good. (a small business, apparently orders come in erratically).
Maybe it's a growth story more than a value play. Which would mean I was wrong

I totally understand your position. I'm just explaining my thoughts. I'm not
trying to sway someone into buying here. That's why I like to here what others
have to say.

>The reason is that input costs are likely over time to be the same for all
competitors.

Exactly my thoughts for pure plays, This is why I generally like to have
exposure to the whole group. You know the strong ones from the group for
various reasons (niches), because of historical data from the past. Why my
exposure to those within the group are risk weighted to those in better
condition to benefit. It kind of like what you mentioned earlier on oil stocks.
Having exposure to oil stocks would benefit more to higher oil prices not to
plastic stocks that wouldn't benefit.

>but imo, ultimately the raw material costs (oil) will be the the same for all
competitors.

IMO It would be different to some big oil players who are in petrochemicals and
plastics together. Big oil non pure plastic plays, because of sheer scale in
relation to pure play competitors. IMO that gives them a cost advantage over
competitors. Direct access to raw materials cost savings. They also might take
a hit to short term plastic margins at the benefit of gaining new customers or
market share. To them plastics or petrochemicals is not a major profit margined
business, but gives them diversification from just raw crude production where
profit margins are high and have scale. Given globalization that's why I
believe big oil producers in the Middle East have hedged their hand with
purchases like the GE plastics business. This reasoning why I believe many in
the group will eventually be absorbed in time, if and when those with scale
want diversification. This would then increase their exposure when prices of
oil might decline and they would want more expose to plastics. If oil doesn't
decline. Eliminating a weak competitor can improve margins and increase market
share. longer term.

I don't think that I ever said that BSX was cheap (it may well be). What I said
is that they have been acting much better lately, compared to itself as well as
the market in general.

One thing that I look for is whether the stock is under accumulation
(remembering that this can be classic ECON 101 in regards to supply and demand)
and I think that it is. Besides the improvements in OBV, I think that the
accumulation index from Investors Daily ranks it as a "B" (that was a couple of
weeks ago).

I also like the fact that the stock reacted favorably to the recent earnings
announcement which included raising EPS guidance. I also think that some of the
technical indicators are looking promising (higher highs, higher lows, 50 avg
flat and ready to start moving upwards).

We currently own a fair amount with at an average price of approx 12.50 and I
intend to buy more once it gets above $13 (Dec and early Feb highs).

Hope this helps

Just a cautionary note for all investors in EWZ. Before investing take a look
at its holdings and remember that 30% of the EWZ is Petrobras (2 different
share classes) and 20% is Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (RIO) (again 2 different
share classes). In total 50% of the fund is 2 companies.

Of course, after realizing this, think about the PBR / EWZ decoupling in the
last couple months, considering that RIO continued to follow EWZ. For this to
occur the remainder of EWZ had to drop A LOT, since PBR continued to go up...

Not sure what this really means. Possibly the rest of EWZ is now much more
attractive. Possibly not. :)

Re CNP/Pargesa: to be honest I am very uncomfortable with the incestuous
relationships such companies have with their subsidiaries. It reminds me of
Japanese or Korean conglomerates that ended up doing whatever they wanted
except of taking care of their shareholders. The fact that it's majority
controlled by some family is both positive and negative. Positive is that the
subsidiaries may not screw the controlling (and other) shareholders. Negative
is that the controlling shareholders may find in their best interest to do
things that don't benefit small shareholders. And again non-advantegeous
relationships with partially owned companies may be one of such deals.

I'll skip.

I loved the Yahoo UK company description though:

"CNP, Compagnie Nationale &#224; Portefeuille The Belgian company is the entity
listed belonging to the group called 'Groupe de Charleroi' controlled by Baron
Fr&#232;re and his family who also own part of the shareholding."

Sounds like something from Dan Brown "Da Vinci Code"... ;)

And who the heck wrote this:

"The simple, organisational and temporal strategy rests on a set of processes
and projects, based on plans that are interwoven tightly enough to capture the
scenario that corresponds to the reality of the moment and seize any
opportunity that may present itself."
