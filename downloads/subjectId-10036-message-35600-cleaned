A natural tendency to find an explanation for events.

Maybe it's modernists who seek a rational explanation for events. As if that
could lead to either peace-of-mind or ability to predict events or understand
or control our environment.

Some would say the Lord or the gods are responsible.

I generally view the cause as people's ignorance of statistics:

1. Confusing correlation with causation, ie. assuming a stock movement has
occurred because some other event has occurred.

2. Not willing to accept randomness as an explanation for a particular event.
Trying to spot a trend from one data point.

Not that I don't get caught doing this myself; I do try to be alert to it
though.

One two headlines about the market are necessary:

1) Market goes up because there are more buyers than sellers
2) Market goes down because there are more sellers than buyers

This is not technically correct either (although I suspect that would be lost
on most business journalists anyways) but wouldn't grab many readers attention
though.

Brazil. EKS, thanks for the article.

Of course, the event is years away, and there'll be an ebb-and-flow to the
country's stocks during that time. All of the Brazil stocks are up now on the
Olympics announcement ---- and there I go---attributing cause-and-effect where
it might not exist. -g- Although in this case, the stocks all seem to have
risen sharply immediately after the announcement, so maybe cause-->effect.

My fav play at this time would be the ETF BRF.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hl?s=BRF

Many of the stocks within it are relatively small local industries, and they
might benefit proportionally more than the larger Brazilian companies which are
available to us on our exchanges. Even though BRF is relatively new and selling
at a new high, and it's near impossible for me to understand or value the
companies within it, I still would be (an am) a buyer for few BRF shares. For a
hold until we get closer to the 2016 Olympics. Meanwhile I continue to be a
holder also of individual shares of several Brazilian stocks - housing,
banking, steel, of course oil.

ConocoPhillips ups dividend, to sell some assets
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/conocophillips-ups-dividend-to-sell-some-asset
-2009-10-07?siteid=yhoof2
ConocoPhillips /quotes/comstock/13*!cop/quotes/nls/cop (COP 49.06, +0.65,
+1.34%) said Wednesday that it will raise its quarterly dividend and sell some
assets over the next two years. The oil company said its board raised the
quarterly dividend 6% to 50 cents a share. The dividend is payable Dec. 1 to
stockholders of record as of Oct. 30. ConocoPhillips also said it plans to sell
off about $10 billion in assets over the next two years to improve its capital
position. The company said it expects to spend $11 billion on capital
expeditures in 2010, down from $12.5 billion in 2009. Shares of ConocoPhillips
rose 1.6% to $49.20 in recent trading.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ConocoPhillips-Increases-bw-888322208.html?x=0&.v

To improve its financial position and strengthen its balance sheet,
ConocoPhillips intends to sell approximately $10 billion of assets over the
next two years. The dispositions will occur across the company’s Exploration &
Production and Refining & Marketing portfolio. Proceeds from dispositions will
be targeted to debt reduction, accelerating the company’s return to its stated
target debt-to-capital ratio of 20 percent to 25 percent.

===============================================================
If oil get's to $70-$100, then it may be a good call to sell some of their
assets to reduce debt.

There are no commodity value plays that I'm aware of that I'm willing to step
into at current prices. (I'm excluding oil/gas from my comments here.)

That said, I already have positions in several related stocks, e.g. couple
mining stocks, Brazil stuff, and some commodity plays.

I'm following Jim Rogers and going with his picks of RJA and GRU. Also DBA. In
with buys in May and July, I'm up about 3% with one, and down about 5 & 6% with
the others. I bought these because, 1) I wanted to have an exposure to
commodities, and 2) I wanted something that "they" said wasn't correlated with
equities (correlated with the stock market).

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RJA,GRU,DBA&d=s

So far that seems to be so, the market being up and these 'stocks' not. We're
different here, with different amounts of money to invest/speculate, different
time frames, different goals. So the way we look at positions will be different
too. I don't care that these three commodity plays don't go up. I'm looking at
them as just a small insurance policy and as tracking positions. So as long as
these things don't crater, and as they continue to reduce some volatility with
common stocks, I'll hold, I believe. Somebody more aggressive might take the
tack to just wait to see when/if these commodity plays move and then hop
aboard. For me, I have no problem now being in and just waiting. If I were
looking to beef up my commodity play (:>) pun, sorry -g-), for me, I might buy
more of these three.

I get that silver's a commodity and commodity prices might rise as the dollar
collapses. Perhaps SLW's good performance has been and will be a function of
the commodity (silver).

I'm certainly not understanding much of this. I understand a little why gold

I will throw my two cents into the question about MCGC. If you think the
banking sector has solved all the toxic assets and gotten them off the
books......go for a small operation like MCGC. However, note the recent bump
was probably due to the analyst up-grade for the stock. Also, note that last Q
the projected earnings came in on the low side and for 2010 the current
projections are lower than what is 'expected' for all 2009. If you are looking
for a play in this sector, I would look at ACAS. I made a nice profit off them
by getting in on their 'special' dividend...but as of the late the stock has
been in 'still waters'. If this market is getting over heated....the starch in
MCGC and their kind will get pummeled (IMO). If you have the money to
gamble......MCGC could be worth rolling the dice.

I'll continue to hold ABB. I never really increased my initial few share buy,

UTX has a p/e of 13-14 and recent roe numbers of 18-20% (both better than SI or

Not exactly an 'apple to apple' comparison but close enough for me to stay
clear of MCGC...

Regional Bank Favorites May Slip
Credit Suisse warns that a return to profitability may be delayed.

Credit Suisse

WE DO NOT BELIEVE investors should be overweight regional banks into the
quarter -- while there will be some positives such as (1) higher net interest
margins, and (2) decelerating nonperforming loan/net charge-off (NPL/NCO)
growth, we believe investors may have to extend the duration for when the
industry can (1) return to profitability, and (2) when commercial real estate
(CRE) and commercial and industrial NPL/NCOs will peak.

Specifically, we look for consumer and construction NPL/NCOs to reach
inflection points in the second half (most likely in the fourth quarter), while
CRE and commercial and industrial NCOs will most likely lag by three to four
quarters, unless regulators apply more pressure on loss recognition. This could
accelerate the decline in capital ratios, and create a divergence in the
regional bank stocks that have consumer versus commercial overweights in their
loan portfolios.

Due to an improved valuation relative to normalized earnings (7.4 times) and
forward tangible book value (1.1 times), we are downgrading Comerica (ticker:
CMA) to Neutral from Outperform. While Comerica's underwriting remains strong
outside of the construction portfolio, the sheer size of Comerica's commercial
and industrial and CRE book (76% of loans, 8.2 times tangible common equity)
could cause its earnings-per-share recovery to lag peers.

We are raising our target prices for BB&T (BBT), Bank of Hawaii (BOH),
Comerica, Fulton Financial (FULT), M&T Bank (MTB), Regions Financial (RF),
SunTrust Banks (STI) and Zions Bancorp (ZION).

We recommend that clients, (1) increase allocations to Bank of Hawaii and First
Horizon National (FHN) and (2) lower allocations to Zion Bancorp and Synovus
Financial (SNV). These recommendations are based on relative valuation levels,
which we compare against (1) geography, (2) loan mix and (3) loss recognition
factors, which impact our third-quarter estimates.

In the third quarter, for regional banks within our coverage universe, we
expect the average net interest margin to increase by three basis points,
average nonperforming assets to increase by 13% quarter over quarter (versus
22% in the second quarter), average NCOs to increase by 18% quarter over
quarter (versus 32% in the second quarter), and reserve coverage of loans to
climb to 2.7% from 2.4% (while coverage of charge-offs to decline to 1.2 years
from 1.3 years).

Geography, loan mix, loss recognition are key factors. We believe investors
should focus on the regional banks that (1) are attractively valued on
normalized earnings (including TARP repayment and future capital right-sizing
actions), and (2) will report a faster improvement in EPS. By geography, we
prefer the southeast and southwest, which we view as early cycle loan classes
and have stronger underlying fundamentals over the longer-term (economic and
population growth).

Additionally, we prefer the regional banks that have the lowest allocations to
commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, and instead are
overweight consumer and residential mortgage credit as we believe these loan
portfolios will experience improving credit quality faster.

In terms of loss recognition, we prefer the banks that have built healthy
reserves, and are in a position to release reserves over the next two years
shielding earnings from NCOs, and also those that have been aggressive in
charging-off problem loans. Accordingly, while there is not one bank that meets
all the factors on either the long or short side, we believe Bank of Hawaii and
First Horizon are well positioned into second-half results, while Synovus
Financial and Zions Bancorp have greater risk.

re MCGC. These guys (business development companies) don't have a working
business model, IMO. They have a way higher cost of funding, relative to banks
which nowadays can borrow for almost nothing. To compensate for that they need
to make risky loans so they can get a spread at all. Those risky loans often
turn into garbage once the economy goes bad. Some of those may survive if they
can raise more equity to keep the bonfire going.

"Im guessing there are lots of folks out there who no longer want to hold
dollar bills in safety deposit boxes and other hiding places."

I'm with you on that guess. Not so much that people who tuck away money in
safety boxes will remove such monies, but rather to me it's all about the
people who have all this money in money market funds that pay about 0%. The
question then is, if they remove money, where will they put this money that
they withdraw? I'm guessing that maybe a bunch of them will stay out of common
stocks but be attracted to bond funds, esp. junk bond funds. The reason is
that, it's a year later and the world hasn't ended, we don't see (or I don't
see) a discouraging never-ending string of corporate bankruptcies, and
companies seem to continue to pay their debts. And in terms of junk bond funds,
and the diversity of their holdings, they yield maybe 8-10%.

So imo, a nice transition place - spending the withdrawn cash on a few junk
bond fund holdings as an intermediate step between mm funds/cash and maybe the
still risky and volatile, common stocks.

Anyway, I've decided to add to my position in HYG in the past couple days as a
play that the demand for this kind of entity will increase. There are only
about three junk bond etf's, I believe (not sure). Ordinarily I'd assume it's
too late for me to add, but given my presumption that there might be more
demand for these funds, and given that HYG's monthly $.705 distribution, if
annualized, is $8.46, a yield about 10% on today's $85.41/sh stock, I'll
withdraw some dollars from my brokerage mm fund and move it into HYG.

Easier for me to believe that somebody wanting to remove dollar bills from
hiding places might be attracted to something like HYG. Harder for me to
believe they would be going from safety of cash directly into something as
arcane(?) or obscure (?) as MCGC.

Jmo, of course. And if you bought or added to MCGC stake in past six months,
that's worked out better than having HYG (percentagewise):

The economy did go bad and some of the loans have turned to garbage. on the
plus side is that they have reduced non recourse debt to below $100 million so

The plg.to split has turned into one of those classic greenblatt plays. its

way down to .04 in march. last i checked it was about .49. unfortunately had so
much jr. mining stocks in my portfolio at the time i felt stuffed with them and
couldnt bear to add more. I really cant tell you if its worth .04 or.49 but im
just holding on to all of my shares.

I asked my son whether he thought I was smarter than I was 6 months ago. he

Hi Spekulatius -

Re SSBI- Stock looks like it is thinly traded and with a spread of $0.25/share.
Did you just have a standing sell order in the queue? Good job if you were able
to "scalp" a $1.00/share especially given the low trading volume.

I have noticed that stocks that have recently "reversed split" can provide some
quick trading profits too. As the stocks adjusts to it's new post split trading
levels you usually see a lot of price volatility.

There are some opportunities to capture a dividend by buying the stock before
the xdividend date and then selling a covered call or doing a swing trade after
the xdividend date. The market is not always efficient in adjusting for the
dividend payment especially if the dividend is large.

Many times I find I do much better buying and holding especially at this point
in the cycle. I have been focusing on the stocks breaking above their 200 day
moving average on higher than normal volume. If they also pay a high dividend,
then I explore a buy/write strategy. Schwab allows you to set "alerts" and I
use the greater than 50% volume setting w/ the price at or above the 200 day MA
price. "Alerts" are sent automatically to my cell phone as text messages. This
way I am aware of potential buy opportunities all through out the day w/o
having to be right at the terminal.

Many of these stocks make for good swing trades and also possible long term
holds (as they continue higher through their 200 MA price).

I have also been writing naked Puts (six months out) with covered Calls (six
months out) staggered w/ different strike prices on longer positions I want to
accumulate. I have positions I am setting up for BKH and LLY waiting to write
the naked Put and covered Call respectively. It may take me 30-60 days to get
both sides of the option trade positioned. On huge market swings, then you can
trade the option rather than the stock (by covering the Call or Put) and then
rolling the option to a higher or lower strike price or just taking the option
position(s) off completely.

Finally, the boring utilities seem to be moving higher again. These have been
excellent reversion to the mean plays for me.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SE,CNP,D,ELP,FE,SWX,TE,PPL&d=s

I am ready to write covered calls on several of these but as I wait for the
next expiration period to pass, they continue to move higher. Therefore, I
continue to do nothing.

When all is said and done, I find I make more by holding and selling (booking a
long term capital gain) than using several of these different hedging
strategies. If I am not sure of the company (or the economy), I am tempted now
to just sell the entire position and visit the opportunity latter.

Brazil: The Only Market Worth Investing In 3 comments
by: Danny Furman October 09, 2009 | about: BAK / BIK / BKF / BOBS.OB / BRF /
CPL / CZZ / EWZ / GOL / NM / NMM / SBS

Wednesday on CNBC, Jim Rogers insisted that China and Brazil are the only BRIC
countries worth investing in. Despite an election conducive to more
capitalistic policy, India's ritualistic culture discourages competition, greed
and other growth drivers. Russia is still in a newly liberated economic state,
in which citizens have so much incentive to enjoy previously denied economic
freedoms that they will make frivolous financial decisions until enough time
passes or national policy encourages productivity and saving.

China's case is well documented and will not be rehashed here, as I believe
Brazil is the only market worth investing in today. Brazil is the only nation
with an immediate future of increased production and consumption. Unlike China,
Brazil has provided more developed economies things they need, not things they
want (sorry if I underestimate the value of your Pokemon cards, Playstations
and Beanie Babies). The death of the American consumer only affects Brazil if
it is a literal one, meaning Americans no longer need sugar, bananas or oil.

In June I recommended aggressively buying Brazil stocks after a commodities
selloff hit the Brazil ADRs extremely hard. Still today, despite 300%+ YTD
gains in CZZ, GOL and others, Brazil is by far the cheapest market out there.
SBS, CPL and BRF are still my favorite fundamental ways to play booming
consumption and infrastructure growth in South America's largest country, but
bargain hunting is what I do and the Brazil ADR market is littered with stocks
undervalued relative to international peers. The following are attractive,
albeit less popular investments in what I consider the only real bull economy.

1. Brazil Fast Food Corp (BOBS.OB): Q209 revenues were profitably up 62% YOY.
The Company sells Pizza Hut and KFC franchise licenses for $60,000 and collects
5% of total sales from each restaurant. The model is extremely supportive of
increased profitability as long as revenue continues to grow. Recent growth is
seemingly due to a Brazilian love affair with subpar pizza, but the real story
will be The World Cup, The Olympics and millions of tourists averse to trying
new food. With volume starting to pick up, this thinly traded stock is as good
a candidate as I know to return 100%+ the rest of this year.

2. Navios Maritime Partners (NMM): This high-yielding MLP has been buying ships
at bargain prices all year and, unlike many bulk dry shippers, seems to be
actually using them. With a yield near 10% and a busy decade of importing and
exporting ahead for Brazil, NMM is likely one of a few stocks Peter Schiff
wouldn't yell at you for buying. Parent company Navios Maritime (NM) trades at
a cheaper P/E and P/B but only yields 4-5%.

3. Braskem (BAK): This may be the stock that has performed the best since Rio
de Janeiro was named host of the 2016 Olympics. I've been following BAK, a
petrochemical company, for about 6 weeks and kicked myself for not buying at
$9.50 when it first hit $11/share. Today it trades near $14/share and is up
about 20% in the last week. Q2 was a record quarter with earnings over $2/share
and, while Q3 forecasts are less rosy, refined oil consumption in Brazil has
nowhere to go but up. I consider BAK a better investment than PBR because it is
only dependent on domestic consumption, not international demand for oil. Any
market pullbacks will hit BAK hard so this Brazil ADR is one I wouldn't rush
into.

Selling HYG involves some strategy maybe. Selling, a person gives up a 10%
yield, so either it's a belief the market is about to take stocks and this etf
down, or that one or more of the underlying holdings of HYG might crater. Or
else that there's just something undervalued out there that's a better bet than
HYG at $85. Better to the extent of giving up that 10% yield. And if it's a
common stock, that could shift the portfolio bond/stock weighting too, if that
is a money management consideration.

Not arguing to keep HYG. Just some considerations for me. I've got relatively
lots of cash in my brokerage mm fund (for stocks, if I can find 'em and screw
up my courage to buy), and because of already large cash holdings, I'm not
looking to sell HYG and redeploy funds back into mm fund.

Thanks, Madharry. FWIW, I believe Jurgis and I are the two who have posted
about GFRI. I started buying the stock at .20. Currently, it is my largest
holding with an average price of around .40. I have sold some of my shares, but
I don't believe it is overvalued here with a single digit PE.

The principle use of bromine, by the way, is as a fire retardant. It's also
used in drilling and as an additive to specialty chemicals. China is a net
importer of bromine and company has recently given guidance on the increasing
price of this commodity.

I've been very busy at work and haven't had time to post, so I'll take this
opportunity to catch up on what I've been doing. KTOS is a stock I posted
about. I have sold my position for a profit

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25752089

I've also sold RSG, the last of my trash stocks. My original purchase was
around twelve dollars.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=24820748&srchtxt=rsg

I have a concentrated portfolio and a large position in cash. The stocks I own
are CHNG, CNOA, GFRE, CHGI, and PRSC.

CHNG is a stock I've owned for a couple of years. I've recently bought more and
yesterday it was recommended as a buy by Roth. Today's NY Times has an
interesting story about natural gas being used as a transportation vehicle.
This will happen sooner in China than in the US, so I consider this as a long
term hold for me.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/opinion/27friedman.html

With that in mind, I've started a small position in CHGI. It trades by
appointment but I have buys in on weakeness. You can listen to their recent
presentation at the Rodman and Renshaw Conference. Some of the other stocks
that I own also made presentations.

http://www.rodmanandrenshaw.com/conferences?id=39&link=confwebcasters

I still own CNOA. The third quarter results should be interesting as the
company sells at a very low PE, but management is still suspect in that they
haven't taken steps to move to a higher exchange. My average price is around
.40. The current trade is around .70.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25280201&srchtxt=cnoa

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25335265&srchtxt=cnoa

I own PRSC. I didn't post it here as I didn't think Paul would want to hear
about stocks on the brink of default. My average price is two dollars. I still
like it and tried to buy some yesterday.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25000463&srchtxt=prsc

The company is paying down debt and selling at a single digit PE. Their latest
presentation is listed below.

With all due respect, EKS, I don't understand how you arrived at a 16 PE. Below
is the link to the second quarter 10Q for the first six months of the year. On
page four it indicates that for the last six months the company has earned .13
a share.

http://www.gulfresourcesinc.cn/images/pdf/gulf_resources,_inc._10q_20090810.pdf

Below is the PDF for the most recent investor presentation.

http://www.gulfresourcesinc.cn/images/pdf/8_25_2009_gfre_ppt_september_2009_fin

Earnings for 2008 are listed on page 28 of the 10K and show the company earned
.22 a share up from .13 in 2007 and .04 in 2006.

Earnings per share have been at best marginal?

They look pretty good to me.

http://www.gulfresourcesinc.cn/images/pdf/gulf_resources,_inc._10k_20090316.pdf

Please explain how you arrived at .01 a share for 2008.

"The bast I can tell is that the stock sells at 16x earnings (PE 16) which
consists of $0.11/share from the acquired purchased manufacturing assets and
$0.01/share based on 2008 (prior years) results (w/o the revenue stream from
the acquired manufacturing assets and adjusted for the 4:1 reverse split)."

I do like that in March 2009, the Company acquired additional mineral rights
for their raw materials. They used $10 million in cash and issued 1,500,000
shares to do the deal. Are these going to be post split shares?

I took a quick look at QXM and wonder about the following items:

(all figures in millions of RMB)

1. Most recent numbers are from Q1 ended 3/31, and those just a PR, not the
more full 10Q information.

2. Revenues down nearly 25% in Q1 from prior year.

3. With cash stated to be 3000, why is short-term debt at 1100?

4. And with that balance sheet, why was quarterly interest expense 69 when
interest income was only 4? Quite the interest rate!

edit: If XING consolidates QXM's earnings, than must XING wait to report Q2
until after QXM reports? Need to check that out.

5. What is the 42 of 'gain on remeasurement of embedded derivatives' without
which QXM would have reported a loss in Q1?

6. How serious is the risk of QXM's phones becoming technologically obsolete or
out of style?

7, "Our parent company, Xing, a public company listed on the Nasdaq Global
Market, currently owns approximately 67.6% of our outstanding share capital."
Isn't XING also in handset business? There are other wacky insider dealings,
typical of small Chinese companies.

8. Huge Concentration risk - "Sales generated by our five best-performing
distributors accounted for approximately 76.0%, 53.0% and 85.1% of our revenue
in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the best-performing distributor
accounted for approximately 28.4%, 12.4% and 52.7% of our revenue in the same
periods."

On the other hand,

1. Market cap of common seems to be only 1000, and enterprise value negative
1000.

2. Quarterly revenues have been 400 to 700, and quarterly operating profit from
40 to 150.

3. If there's any hope of returning to the 100 level, this does seem to be
quite the bargain.

How are those phones doing? They must be not doing well, would be my guess.

Sorry if I made any errors above, just a quick look. QXM seems interesting
enough to look further, though I feel pretty put off by that XING ownership and
the related party transactions. Certainly warrants further investigation.

Edit: HUIZHOU, Guangdong, China, Sept. 1 /PRNewswire-Asia-FirstCall/ -- Qiao
Xing Universal Telephone, Inc. (Nasdaq: XING - News) today announced that it
has signed a letter of intent ("LOI") with Dragon Fu Investment Limited
("DFIL") in connection with a proposed sale of its subsidiary, Qiao Xing
Communication Holdings Limited.

Is that a third entity, not QXM. These Chinese companies are so hard to figure.

Edit: from XING - For the first quarter of 2009, about 89.8% sales revenue was
contributed by the Company’s major subsidiary CEC Telecom Company, Limited
(“CECT”), which is in the mobile phone handset business with its ‘CECT’ brand
and ‘VEVA’ brand.

Isn't that one QXM? XING looks about as cheap as QXM, fwiw. BTW, "Rui Lin Wu
38,819,000 shares or 53.1%"

We're dealing with the whims and machinations of one man here. XING was a
shortsellers stock back in the day.

I'm in this am for a tracking position in Chinese dairy producer, American
Dairy, ADY. A case can be made that it's a value stock.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=ADY .

Also, upping my position now in WMT which is down today and under $50/sh. This
stock now has essentially shown nothing in past few years---I have shares
bought four years ago at $45.78. And now, with the market moving, tech expected
to improve (according to some talking heads), the recent and maybe continuing
dash-to-trash, who the heck wants a prosaic food stock -- and a behemoth that
doesn't seem to do anything?

It'll work for me though. Rather be in it for a few more shares than have the
money in money-market funds. Some safety with WMT: It wasn't slaughtered at
market lows, and its measly dividend (2% div. yield), which bests my broker's
mm fund, has increased every year). Meanwhile company numbers keep getting more
attractive-- p/bk, p/e. P/sales pretty low (relatively)-- nobody wants ole WMT
apparently.

Gee, maybe I'll have to see for myself. Haven't been in a WMT since about '98.

I had been tempted by WMT recently too, but decided against it. Unless WMT is
actively hedging their currency risk, they may get hit pretty hard by the
falling US buck, since they are importers rather than exporters. Don't they get
almost all of their merchandise from China?

But then, I remember expressing a similar concern over your purchase of Toyota
a few years back when it appeared the US buck was tanking and Toyota blew away
the domestic auto mfrs anyway. So take this cautionary note with a grain of
salt!

WMT will just raise their prices. Their competition will do the same, since it
will affect them the same way. I would venture the guess that WMT supply chain
will cope better with price increases than their competitors. Where else will
their customers go to get a better deal?

RE: WMT

I am not too sure of the % of sales WMT does in their Pharmacy department, but
I bet that they show a double digit increase in revenues if they had a quarter
like WAG. WAG was up over 10% earlier this month when their same store sales
numbers were released.

Walgreens September Sales Increase 10.3 Percent
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Walgreens-September-Sales-bw-920209789.html?x=0&.
=1

From the article:"...September pharmacy sales increased 11.2 percent, while
comparable pharmacy sales increased 7.0 percent. Comparable pharmacy sales were
positively impacted by 2.4 percentage points due to seasonal flu shots, and
negatively impacted by 2.3 percentage points due to generic drug introductions
in the last 12 months.

Prescriptions filled at comparable stores increased 12.0 percent in September,
including 5.2 percentage points due to seasonal flu shots and 1.4 percentage
points due to more patients filling 90-day prescriptions. Pharmacy sales
accounted for 67.6 percent of total sales for the month...."

The new drug prices seem to benefit both Wal-Mart & Wallgreens.

http://www.sptimes.com/2006/09/22/Business/Wal_Mart_drops_drugs_.shtml
"...Discounters like Wal-Mart account for about 20 percent of the prescription
drug market, with major retail drug chains accounting for about 40 percent.
Ransom said the biggest likely losers to Wal-Mart's gambit are other
discounters like Costco...." "...That's what the folks at Walgreens, the
nation's largest drug retailer, are hoping. The Deerfield, Ill., chain filled
over 500-million prescriptions last year, about 60 percent of which were
generic; 95 percent of their prescription customers had insurance. Michael
Polzin, Walgreens' spokesman, said the chain has no intention of matching
Wal-Mart's $4 price..."

==============================================================

WMT's pharmacy has a host of prescription drugs that they sell at a flat rate
of $10.00 for a 3 month subscription. They even beat Kaiser's drug benefit plan
for all of the common generic brands.

WMT even does Flu shots. They provide a Flu Shot locator here:
http://flushotsusa.walmart.com/

Mollen Immunization Clinics, LLC is contracted by Wall Mart to provide Flu
Shots. It looks like Mollen is a private company.

WMT will just raise their prices.
Demand schedule WMT faces slopes downward, not vertical. WMT will raise prices,
but margins will be squeezed, quantity sold will be lower as one moves up the
demand curve. (Higher costs shift price-quantity supply schedule to the left.)

Where else will their customers go to get a better deal?
Perhaps nowhere. But that doesn't mean consumers will be able to afford higher
prices and consume same or higher quantities.

I agree that WMT mgmt will likely cope better with price increases than their
competitors. But unless the bet is expanding market share will compensate for
the negatives, WMT is facing higher costs they cannot easily overcome...in
theory.

I appreciate the look at QXM, Peter. I think in general that many of the
Chinese cell phone companies are low in valuation now. I'm not sure why this
is, but a company selling below cash, recording a profit somehow, and poised

That being said, I don't own shares yet, and I think that many of your points

FWIW the shortage, alleged or not, of flu vaccine, has created some heavy
traffic at some drug store chains. Some CVS stores have Minute Clinics inside,
I went to two today, one was busy, the other had a line of 30-40. This not only
creates $$$ for the Clinic (I assume CVS gets a piece of that), but ancillary
sales, as well.

Hi Wallace -

My sister who is a doctor in Southern CA had over 250 patients receive a flu
shot at their Saturday 1/2 day event event this last weekend. She tells me that
the H1N1 vaccine won't even be available to her patients until December even
though Sanofi-Aventis made their first shipment available 9/29/2009. Many of
her patients plan to come back in December for their H1N1 shot.

Sanofi-Aventis Shipping H1N1 Vaccine To US Government Tuesday
http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090929-714036.html
From the article:"...Sanofi has contracted with the U.S. government to supply a
total of 75.3 million doses of its H1N1 vaccine, manufactured at a plant in
Swiftwater, Pa. Other manufacturers also have supply contracts with the U.S.,
including GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK) and AstraZeneca PLC (AZN)...."

I own both SNY and GSK but I think more money may be made from (1) either the
flu shot injectors (MinuteClinic which is a subsidiary of CVS/Caremark, Take
Care Clinics - Walgreen, Mollen Immunization Clinics, LLC - Walmart and Maxim
Health System a private company that contract out their services to Win Dixxie,
CVS & WalMart) or (2)the commercial pharmacy stores that sponsor the flu shots
(CVS,WAG, WMT and perhaps even TGT).

There does not seem to be a "pure" play with the injectors (maybe w/ CVS).
Maxim Health who is one of the largest on site injectors is a private company.
They have contracts with Win Dixie, CVS, Walgreens and WalMart.
http://www.enews20.com/news_Flu_Shot_Price_Goes_Up_03079.html
From the article:"...The company, which started selling this year's strain of
vaccine Sept. 29, is scheduled to conduct 200 flu-shot clinics at area stores,
churches and community centers through late November.

Not every shot delivered at a store will cost $30, however. Maxim's contract
with Wal-Mart calls for a $29 price. Customers who present a CVS "Extra
Rewards" card at a CVS pharmacy can get a shot for $27. Winn-Dixie customers
using that chain's preferred-customer card qualify for a $28 price...."

It's possible that these vaccines may be a two quarter event. You are correct
that same store sales should increase too just from the added foot traffic from
customers getting their flu shot now and their H1N1 later.

Have no idea about the technicals. I continue to add to oil/gas stocks. I don't
like doing that. My exposure is already large, maybe too large. It's just that
by the metrics I am using and converting to value determinants, a few oil/gas
stocks are just so compelling at current prices. Well, I'm compelled anyway.
-g-. The scary thing is that it seems to me all these oil/gas stocks mostly
rise and fall with the price of oil, so I am hostage to that. That has really
hurt me late '08 on, as oil fell. I really should focus more on portfolio
management overall rather than stock accumulation in this sector. (sigh)

I continue to monitor some other so-called value investing boards. When I read
of people again talking about how well their portfolio is doing; how they've
recouped losses or that their portfolio has hit new highs, I will consider that
as my technical indicator to get out of stocks. That time seems close.

DJ MARKET TALK: Pali Warns Of 'Value Trap' In Grocer Stocks
Edited by John Shipman

8:50 (Dow Jones) Pali Capital says recent run up in some grocery store stocks
is "unjustified," and investors may be falling into a value trap in a
struggling sector. Firm cuts Supervalu (SVU) and Great Atlantic Pacific (GAP)
to sell, and lowers Safeway (SWY) estimates. Some optimism coming from
expectations for
tempered deflation, but Pali doesn't think that's enough to get bullish,
especially since grocers are competing on price. Unemployment also may stay
high for several years, hurting sales and margins. Wal-Mart (WMT) also a wild
card on speculation it may get even more aggressive with prices. GAP down 3.7%
premarket
at $9.91; SVU down 2.2% at $15.72.

==================================================================
SVU traded 5.09 million shares yesterday 62% above the average daily volume of
3.13 million shares. SVU cut to a sell from neutral by Pali Capital

Here is the performance of WMT, SVU and TSCDY, TESCO (TSCDY) is Europe's
WalMart. I switched into TESCO in 2007, selling 75% of my SVU. I later started
adding to my SVU towards the end of 2008 and beginning 2009 where SVU is now a
top 10 holding.

scale=on

Value statistics:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SVU,WMT,TSCDY.PK&d=s

SVU seems to be the best value proposition of the three but depending on how
you value the companies, you can make similar arguments for WMT and even TSCDY.

No, I'm not buying integrated oils, Madharry. Have sold them down, but now will
likely hold the shares of the ones I still have. I keep adding to ATPG. At
under $20/sh it still "should" be bought given net asset reported by management
(>$100/sh (pretax)) in link I gave earlier, its progress in reducing debt, the
fruition of its upcoming drilling prospects.

To me, an obvious value buy if somebody is interested in the sector, and among
my largest positions now. I'm confident about this low hanging fruit.

On the other hand... sigh... there's no such thing as a stock that "should" be
bought by anyone/everyone other than me; "obvious" may exist because I don't
see that well and my dd on the stock and the sector is superficial; and so
many, many other times in my investment life, whenever I've been confident
about a stock and acquired a big position in it, I've ultimately lost money
with it.

specialize in acquiring and managing the "run-off" business of insurance
companies.

Only a public company since 2008, and they don't pay a dividend.

I like that management emphasizes book value:

"Our primary corporate objective is to grow our tangible net book value.We
believe growth in our tangible net book value is
driven primarily by growth in our net earnings, which is in turn partially
driven by successfully completing new acquisitions."

http://enstargroup.com/secfilings/annualmeeting/shareholderletter.pdf

Company seems to be growing rapidly: No dearth of "run-off" acquisition
opportunities in this economy apparently. Barriers to entry in the business
don't seem high though. Still, I expect ESGR's earnings and stock price to
improve. Not so sure about ESGR's p/bv at 1.4. It might be high right now.

I like that ESGR is hooked up with the J.C Flowers organization. Also a
positive, I hope, is that respected investor Charles Akre owns shares and is on
the bod. Maybe he'll have a positive influence on the company's investments.

Several companies and nonprofits have formed a new group to support the
conversion of cars and trucks to using natural gas.

In addition, the Metroplex Natural Gas Vehicle Consortium is out to help “fleet
operators” — meaning any organization that has a fleet of cars or trucks — find
ways to secure natural-gas fueling stations for their vehicles.

“The largest impediment to converting fleets to natural gas is a lack of
fueling infrastructure,” said Ed Ireland, executive director of the Barnett
Shale Energy Education Council, which is a member of the new Metroplex
consortium.

“It is mainly a cost issue,” Ireland added. “For the smaller fleet operators,
it’s just not cost-effective to build their own fueling stations. The idea of
the coalition is (to provide a forum where) they can share ideas on where they
might build a station” or form a joint venture with someone else to create
fueling locations.

The Environmental Protection Agency has ever-increasingly stringent air-quality
regulations pertaining to trucks, Ireland said. That, he argued, is a big
reason why fleets should be converted to natural gas.

In addition to the Barnett Shale Energy Education Council, other members of the
consortium include the TCU Energy Institute, Enterprise Rent-a-Car, Republic
Services, Chesapeake Energy, XTO Energy, Clean Energy Fuels, EOG Resources,
EnCana, Quicksilver Resources and the North Central Texas Council of
Governments.
