and are pretty well off. Your point?

Result checking is worthwhile once in a while, just to make a sanity check, but
I would not dump a fund in the middle of bear market just because it did not
perform very well in the last couple years. Same about bull market BTW.

I still prefer to go with the management whose methods I trust. I would not buy
Fidelity funds, since I don't think they have very good value-oriented managers
there. Growth? Hmm, I am not sure I am interested in growth funds. S&P500 is
good enough for this.

Small cap funds and overall small caps. This is the area where I don't have
much expertise. Long time ago it may have been possible to buy small cap
companies with growth and earnings. Nowadays most of them have neither growth
nor earnings. Or maybe they still have growth, but no earnings. So I am not
sure how small-cap fund managers select them as I would not be sure how to
select them myself. I have a few small-cap and mid-cap holdings with long
histories and high ROEs. But they are few and far in between (and they are
definitely not "growth" companies, since they would not be small cap with 10
years being public :-)), so even a small fund would not survive on them.

Maybe you are right and I should fill this gap with some mutual fund holdings.
I have NBGEX in 401(k) and TAVFX (not really small cap fund), which I think is
enough for now. From your list WMICX looks interesting though 2.3% expense
ratio seems steep.

You are talking about a universe of thousands of stocks, and a fund manager
only needs 20-30 minimum and up to 100 in a good-sized fund. A sweeping
generality like this is meaningless - I could list dozens of stocks here with
growth and earnings with one or two simple screens on popular Web sites. You
just aren't looking.

It might pay off for you to do more research in what those funds hold and why.

Long time ago it may have been possible to buy small cap companies with growth
and earnings. Nowadays most of them have neither growth nor earnings. Or maybe
they still have growth, but no earnings. So I am not sure how small-cap fund
managers select them as I would not be sure how to select them myself.

I think we have beat this topic to death but I am always happy to discuss it
more on my 50% Gains thread, where I have an ongoing portfolio of mostly small
caps with documented five-year performance.

Madharry: ACDO - The receivables aren't the key issue. They were purchased &
the sellers estimate of uncollectibles was accepted....now it looks like an
adjustment to a higher level may be required. If there were fraud, ACDO would
be the vic not the perp....but there's no fraud, just an adjustment that will
actually help visible earnings in 04 by about .25.
The key issue, IMO, is whether Pharmacy Benefit Managers, PBM's like
http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=CMX+ADVP+ESRX&d=2y are taking share and will
continue to take share from ACDO. The PBM's are generalists offering one stop
shopping while ACDO is a specialist offering higher service levels for specific
accute diseases. The PBM's gained some ground recently when ACDO's sales force
took their eye off the ball due to acquisition integration and other temporary
issues. ACDO says this is temporary, that there has been no real change in
competitive dynamics. Some analysts aren't so sure. The shares reflect bearish
expectations. I'm betting ACDO is telling it straight, but it's not a big bet.
ACDO is scheduled to offer 04 guidance early May.

Barrons had interview with Barrow, head of Vanguard's Windsor II fund. some
good stuff in the article, presented below:

On the Hunt
Many invest like VW drivers using big-truck mirrors. Jim Barrow prefers the
view ahead

By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

AN INTERVIEW WITH JAMES BARROW -- In Texas, quail hunting is gentleman's sport.
The hunter follows pointer dogs on foot
over rolling brush or hill country. He creeps along quietly, waiting patiently
for the dogs to flush out a covey of birds. And when the
winged creatures finally dart up into the air from underfoot, the expert hunter
gets a bead on a single bird, instead of making the
fatal, novice mistake of "flock-shooting." Those hunters who remain calm during
the covey's frantic rise can bag doubles, and even
rarer triples.

It's understandable, then, that James Barrow hunts quail avidly. He's also a
renowned value investor, and uses the same strategy for
managing his portfolios, picking his shots carefully while others are
panicking.

Barrow oversees a fund that's one of the most widely held in 401(k) plans:
Vanguard Windsor II, a large-cap fund with roughly $18
billion in assets.

Vanguard subcontracts stockpicking work to outside managers, and the majority
of the fund's money is run by Dallas
money-management shop Barrow Hanley Mewhinney & Strauss. Barrow, 62, has been
in the investment-management business since
1965 and with BHM&S since 1979. The fund manager, who received a B.Sc. from the
University of South Carolina, resides with his
family in Dallas.

Vanguard Windsor II, which ranks among the nation's 20 largest stock funds, has
returned an annualized 9.28% over the past decade,
and beaten the Standard & Poor's 500 nearly ever year, according to
Morningstar. Keep reading to learn Barrow's views on value
investing, and how he avoids "flock-shooting" in the current market
environment.

Barron's: Jim, whither value investing and value stocks after three years of a
bear market?

Barrow: On March 10, I noticed that there was about 17 times the trading volume
on the downside, versus the upside, for the day.
Nobody in the news said anything about it. A few days later, I went to my bond
guys, and I asked them, 'What was the low in the
short market?' And it happened to be that day -- two days before the market got
to its multiyear low, with the Dow at around
7,400. It struck me as a turning point. I'd been saying in the fund's annual
report that the level the market reached in October would
hold. In fact, we have been testing that bottom.

There's a lot of negativism. One of my analysts was recently in New York
City, and she said everybody was 80% in cash, and scared to death, a sign
of a typical market bottom. And in New York, you guys feed off
yourselves. Down here at least, people say, 'Yeah, the market's terrible,
huh? But at least I had a great golf game last week, or I went fishing or
bird hunting.' So, was I surprised the market bounced 1,000 points since?
It happens when people are that depressed. It reminded me of the way a
lot of people invest, like they're driving in a Volkswagen with big truck
mirrors. They see more clearly where they've been than where they're
going. We made a decent enough bottom, especially in October 2002,
which was driven by the rating agencies.

Q: What about the credit-rating agencies?
A: It started with Enron. The rating agencies got scared to death they'd be
sued over it. They had access to and could
force disclosure of all those off-balance-sheet transactions and they didn't.
Now, they're acting the opposite way,
being overly paranoid. So that's what helped the market bottom in October.
We've also got new legislation on
corporate disclosure, a new Securities and Exchange commissioner and a new
board at the New York Stock Exchange.

Q: Are there one-time growth stocks that you now consider values? And what
happens to value after years of
outperformance?
A: I think the question is: What happens to growth? The great hope is that
capital spending will lead us out of
recession. Capital spending is only one-third of spending. Consumers represent
two-thirds. So my guess is that capital
spending won't lead us out, the economy is not operating even close to
capacity, and we've got no incentive to spend.
And this war is discouraging the heck out of corporate executives to spend
money or to take any risks at all. You can
smell it, and you can taste it. Big companies tell me they have lots of
projects sitting in the wings, but they don't
want to hire.

So if you're a growth-stock investor, how do you get spending to go back up? I
don't think it's possible for spending to get back to 1999 and 2000. That was
Mount Everest,
and we're never getting back to that. And what about capital spending among
tech companies? I'm not coming up with much.

Q: So you're staying away from technology stocks. These days, then, what's a
value stock?
A: I've got a whole portfolio full of them! I don't have a single screen, but
for example, Microsoft. While I don't own it, once in a while I look at
Microsoft, and say: 'Here's
one of the great companies in the country, and they just started paying a
dividend.' At the right price -- say, 18 a share, which would also imply a P/E
of around 18 times
earnings -- I could do something with that. I can't come up with that for
Cisco. It's still trading at 30 times earnings, and those earnings aren't going
anywhere.

In the last year, I have been buying drug stocks, which certainly used to be
growth stocks. I've been buying fallen angels, which I tend to buy anyway. In
Windsor II, I have
good-sized holdings in Baxter International, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Merck.
Those are certainly growth companies. They're trading at 10 to 12 times
earnings, and while
they may not grow for the next two quarters, I don't care. I don't need to be
there the second the earnings change. It's better to be there a little early.

Bristol has really been beaten up. The write-off for Imclone is in the stock.
They have a real problem with management. They're cleaning up the accounting.
Why would you
want to own Bristol? You get a 5.5% current yield, and the company maybe earns
$1.50-$1.60 a share this year and over $2.00 in a few years. I'm willing to
hold a ragged
company like that for a few years, with the idea that it can move from 20 to
30. That's a 50% move. I'm getting paid to hold it.

Q: What about the financial stocks? You've owned those for a long time now.
A: If it's cheap and it's down, I own it. I own Allstate, Bank of America,
Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase. You name it. Some have been okay, Bank of
America has been the
best of that group, because there have been no surprises. It's selling for a
little less than 70 and is supposed to earn a little over $6 a share this year,
so it's pretty cheap. This
fund's got a record that's bettered the market ever since it started, because
we buy cheap stocks and don't have a lot of volatility.

Q: What's going on at J.P. Morgan, one of your picks?
A: J.P. Morgan has been the worst. They had exposure to the business cycle to
begin with, because they make business loans. In investment banking and
brokerage, they don't
really have a strong market share, so all of their banking has to be losing
money. So then they decided to prostitute the balance sheet a little bit, to
get business, and doubled
the bet. Then they got involved in a big venture-capital operation and doubled
the same bet again! So they got derivatives and bad business loans, brokerage
and venture capital,
and quadrupled the bet. They're not different bets, they're the same. They've
taken careful aim, and shot themselves in the foot. They didn't miss. When do
things improve?
They're under pressure and they've got leadership problems.

Q: The stock's gone from 35 to 25 in the past year. You're not buying more?
A: I don't like to double down the way they did! I have enough anyway. At one
time, it was a very large position, because of all the mergers. That's the
difference between the
way we invest and the way J.P. Morgan Chase invests. What they did is like
playing blackjack, getting a pair of fours, and doubling down!

Q: Tell us about some of your other financial holdings.
A: Allstate probably has six to eight more quarters of up earnings. I think the
company [is going to] earn $3.50 a share or more this year; it has some current
yield; and the
stock could go to 40 from 33 now.

The biggest positive is that State Farm has been losing so much money. That
should help Allstate. State Farm and Allstate are the two big players in
homeowners and auto
insurance.

Now to Citigroup. There's been lots of volatility and some controversy, but
it's trading at 12 times lagging earnings and 8 times next year's earnings.
That's pretty cheap.

Q: What's the average for your whole portfolio?
A: For Windsor II, the price-earnings ratio is about 12 times earnings
expectations for this year, for the whole average
weighted portfolio. And the price-to-book is 1.7 times. The median market cap
is around $25 billion, so we own
relatively large stocks.

Q: What about the autos?
A: I don't have any exposure. That industry bothers me. The unfunded pension
cost is one worry, and the completely unfunded post-retirement health-care cost
is another
worry. As a matter of fact, Ford and General Motors would have been better off
if they had just financed [consumers' purchases of] Toyotas, as opposed to
building cars! They
really haven't made any money in the manufacturing of autos for the past 50
years.

Q: Why do they keep making cars, then?
A: It's a guy thing! Men have a thing about cars.

Q: Ha! Well, maybe that's the case; I have a 1985 Saab with a lot of body
filler in it.
A: But at least it's paid for!

Q: True. Okay, so back to the financials.
A: We have a lot of relatively boring stocks, including some financials. There
was a time when clients would call me up and say 'Buy growth stocks!' In 1999
and 2000,
investors cashed out in droves and put all their money in a large Denver fund
complex. I was on an airplane one time from New York to Dallas. I heard one of
the flight
attendants chatting with her friends and she told them, 'I'm putting half my
money in the S&P 500, because it's risk-free, and the other half in Janus Fund,
because it's got a
35% annual return.' I remembered that for a long time. Because the S&P 500 is
not risk-free. A lot of money was lost, real money.

Q: So investors had a misunderstanding about risk?
A: Some of the losses were caused by malfeasance at the corporate level, but an
awful lot were caused by things that didn't make sense on a price basis. JDS
Uniphase was the
biggest stock, in terms of initial weighting in the S&P 500. It went in at a
1.3% weighting. Everybody investing in the index bought it. It was trading at
135 times revenues
when it went into the index. We couldn't even model what growth would have to
be to justify the price. The stock's come down from that, to around 0.1% of the
S&P. That
means every index fund in the United States lost 1.3% on that single
investment. It was simply not worth what it was selling for. My guess is, the
S&P shouldn't have put it in
at that kind of price. What are the people doing who determine who goes in S&P?
They're always chasing the new group.

Q: You like financials, and the S&P's heaviest weighting now is in the
financials! Does that worry you?
A: It's been that way for a long time. It's a combination of insurance,
banking, brokerage, and other categories lumped into financials.

Q: A little more about technology stocks. Do you own anything remotely
resembling tech?
A: We look at tech stocks all the time. I can't come up with anything exciting.
But they're not in our valuation universe. Many aren't self-financing, most
don't pay dividends.
I don't have to have dividends, but I like them. So I've stayed away. The
closest I've gotten was buying Cendant. It's doing okay now. I own some Tyco,
which I bought after it
broke apart. I didn't participate in the first 75% of the stock's drop.

Is that technology? I can't tell. I bought Cendant because if any business is
going to benefit from the Internet, this is it: They rent timeshares and sell
airplane tickets and hotel
reservations, and they also are the biggest realty outfit in the country. You
can put that and the mortgage-origination business on the 'Net.

It's been an unpopular stock, and there's been a lot of throwing of rocks at
company. But I like it right now. Cendant's chief, Henry [Silverman], finally
responded by doing
things that we like, changing the accounting, instead of being a deal junkie,
thinking about paying a dividend and paying down debt. At 12 a share, with
earnings of $1.40-$1.45
this year and plans to take out a third of its debt in the first year, and
another third in the second year, I can't see why it won't go up. He promised
there aren't going to be any
restatements or changes in accounting. It's going to all be as expected.

We own Tyco just on the hope that [CEO Ed] Breen can resurrect confidence in
the company. He's certainly making moves in the right direction. He's got a
good board for a
change, and he's got a reputation as a real straight guy.

Q: Was the news about Tyco's bad accounting in the fire-safety business the
last shoe to drop?
A: We've known for a long time that that's a business where you can account for
things in a million ways. Everybody in that business is doing things in an
aggressive manner. It
bothers me a little, but it's not the whole company by a long shot. The
assumptions that the acquisition of a new customer, and average life of a new
customer, is 9.7 years,
well I can't imagine that's true.

Tyco's earnings are likely to be $1.40-ish a share this year, down from about
$2 a share going back a year ago, but it's cleaner. And it seems you get a
reasonable rebound in
earnings from this level going out for three to four years, back up to maybe
earnings of $2 a share. So its got upside potential to the mid-20s, if you have
patience. And we
have that kind of patience, because our turnover's not real high and we buy
things with the idea that we're looking two or three years out. I'd rather have
it work in a week, but
it doesn't happen like that very often.

Other fund managers have real high turnover rates, but what kind of investors
are they? We have companies that come here, they want us as a shareholder
because we tend to
hold for a long time. I'm not that sensitive about quarterly-earnings reports.
I almost never ask a management, "What are you going to earn next quarter?" You
want a general
idea of what a level or earnings power might be under certain conditions. But
the idea that you know the whisper number is not something we think is
important. We're not
momentum players.

Q: Are companies more reluctant to talk now, in the era of Regulation Full
Disclosure?
A: Some are paranoid. And it probably means the management isn't old enough,
and legal counsel's not old enough. How could a really big company tell you
what they were
going to earn? If they could, that meant they were manipulating the earnings.
How would you know if you ran General Motors what you'd earn the following
year? There are
sales, taxes, the union contract, all sorts of things to consider.

Q: What valuation metrics do you look for?
A: We build a portfolio that has low price-to-earnings, low price-to-book
ratios and a high current yield. The P/E tends to be about at a 20%-30%
discount to average P/Es, and
price-to-book ratios about 60% of the average, and yields anywhere from
100%-200% above the S&P.

We like the dividend component for two reasons: One, obviously, the shareholder
gets the dividend. But the main reason is that a portfolio that's got a very
good yield will be
less volatile, and that lets us sleep a little better at night. There's a good
correlation between companies that pay a dividend and how well those companies
reinvest the capital
they keep. We like dividends even better than a stock buyback. Because by the
time the program is finished, frequently they don't do it. In case of
dividends, there's a notice in
The Wall Street Journal saying the company didn't pay; it's public record.

Q: Does the big comedown in the market mean you're buying anything new that
you've never really invested in before?
A: Cendant and Tyco were new for me. Henry Silverman starts talking about
paying a dividend, and Bill Gates used to be violently opposed to dividends,
now he's paying one
on Microsoft. Dividends have come into vogue. Two years ago, people said 'Don't
talk to Barrow, he's an Old Economy guy, he actually likes dividends.' I don't
care about how
I get my return, as long as I get it.

Q: Let's talk about oil stocks. Why haven't they moved up as the price of crude
has risen?
A: I haven't the vaguest idea. The earnings have been better than expected; the
dividends are fine, the multiples are low, the capitalizations are large, the
stocks aren't volatile.
It's not like the service companies, which are expensive. We own Occidental
Petroleum, ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips. We don't own Exxon Mobil. It's
expensive. It's a
well-run company; it's just an expensive stock.

Q: A lot of money managers feel like they have to own Exxon Mobil; they're
afraid not to.
A: Sure, what they can do is put 3.7% in that stock and then be neutral to the
index and [they] don't have to worry about it. But I don't do that; that's like
kissing your sister.
Buy what you like when it's cheap, and if you don't think it's cheap don't buy
it. Exxon Mobil's not cheap, but it's a helluva good company. The chairman, Lee
Raymond, lives
around the corner from me. He's a real tough businessman. He runs it well; he
doesn't get excited about the big oil finds, but how the nickels and dimes work
out. If it doesn't
make sense he doesn't do it.

BP, or British Petroleum, I own also. The stocks I own tend to have lower
multiples and slightly higher yields. BP's CEO, John Browne, is a cost-cutter
and we like their deep
Gulf of Mexico play, a program in 10,000 feet of water.

Q: Tell us about some growth stocks you've bought recently.
A: I bought a good-sized piece of cruise line company, Carnival. I figured the
war in Iraq would depress the stock, and with the addition of new boats, they
have capacity
coming on. The most damning thing to the stock right now is high fuel prices.

But longer-term, we don't look at Carnival as being in the cruise business, per
se, but in the hotel business. It runs floating resorts, and we think it will
take market share away
from hotels. Big conventions can be held on these ships. If a company wants to
get everyone together for a meeting, the guys won't be able to sneak off to
play golf. They
can't get away!

Q: Why not Royal Caribbean?
A: I own that, too, but in my mid-cap fund. I own Carnival in Windsor II, the
large-cap fund. It's just that simple.

Q: What about Vanguard Variable Annuity Fund, that's another fund that's 100%
Jim Barrow-run, correct?
A: Yes, its holdings are pretty much identical to those in Windsor II. There
might be one or two names that are different.

Q: What about utility stocks?
A: We like them. Public Service Enterprise Group is one we've owned. When they
broke apart recently, because of the necessity to raise equity capital, we
bought a lot more of
it. And the deals being done in 2003 are priced very well, very low.

I just looked at the number of new issues that came to market. There have been
only four or five IPOs, but they had one thing in common: They were all up from
the issue
price. Why? The deals were priced to satisfy the buyers, whereas before, the
bankers were kowtowing to the sellers.

Even past the IPOs -- look at the secondaries. They're up, too, because they
have to be priced for the buyer. That's really different from three years ago.

I've also been buying Baxter International. It's gotten crushed. We think this
healthcare-equipment provider got itself into some trouble; earnings have been
disappointing, and
management has gotten too aggressive financially. The stock went from 60 to 20,
so we thought it was an appropriate time to buy. We started buying at 25, so
it's come down
from there, but I like where I am. If it goes lower I'll buy some more. They'll
earn $2 a share this year, and have a 3% yield, even though it's not sexy.

April 11, 2003 06:23:00 (ET)
LONDON (CBS.MW) -- Apple Computer is in talks to buy Vivendi Universal's
Universal Music Group for as much as $6 billion, the Los Angeles Times said on
Friday, citing sources.
A Vivendi spokesman in France said the company would have no comment on the
report, posted on the LA Times web site. Vivendi's Paris-listed shares (012777)
were last up 2.1 percent at 12.87 euro.
Vivendi's Universal Music Group is the second largest record company in the
world.
Apple (AAPL, Trade) has not made a formal bid but may offer $5 billion to $6
billion ahead Vivendi's April 29 board meeting, the report said.
Apple's Chief Executive Steve Jobs is anticipating that music can be profitable
on the Internet. The PC maker had been testing a service, the LA Times report
said.

Larry,

I own BMY. I just went through their proxy and 2002 annual report. I don't
think it is a great value right now. Assuming forward going ROE of 20% (they
had much higher ROE before current slump and 20% ROE in 2002), the expected
annual return is ~11%. Of course, if they get bought out or if ROE increases,
this is a conservative estimate.

Regarding their numbers, since they restated everything, they should be
"reasonably clean". :-/ I did not do very in-depth analysis, since I assumed
they cleaned what they could and that the past is not very indicative of the
future. Their FCF is negative in 2002, which is a concern, but for now I hold
the stock.

I believe James Clarke had BMY in one of his accounts. Maybe he can comment.

On ALU, it was warned of here, #16679.

My guess is that the shareholders will end up with nothing, unless some
insurance money is paid. That is unpredictable. If you own it, I'd hold it, as
you would get a lot more than 17 cents if a reasonable amount of insurance is
paid. In addition, if the insurance companies were obligated by contract terms
to pay something (even in the case of arson) and refused to do so, they might
now be additionally liable for causing irreparable damage to the company.

However, if I did not own it I would not buy it. I never like investments where
the main investment factor (amount of insurance proceeds, if any) is
unknowable.

Jobs, being an entrepreneur, it's likely he would want those billions AAPL has,

For value investors - many of whom profess to be doing discounted flow analysis
or studying balance sheets before making decisions, do we know enough to say
Vivendi music division purchase at $5-6B (even if it's all cash) is or is not a
lousy deal on the face of it? (that is without even an expectation that Jobs

Well, my opinion on Al Gore is that I voted for him and would again. IMO under
him 9/11 wouldn't have happened and we wouldn't have conquered two countries in
two years and be going after three more: Syria, Iran and North Korea (at
least). I think all the top people in this administration should be up on
charges of negligent homicide for the 3000+ deaths they allowed to occur on
9/11. Under any other administration would the answer: "Well the CIA didn't
talk to the FBI, and the FBI didn't talk to the CIA" been acceptable for all
those deaths? After all, who appointed the heads of those agencies? Oh yeah,
that's right, it's somebody else's fault, not us! (Why not Clinton? He's been a
good one to blame all the bad stuff on, after all, it's Clinton's recession
isn't it? Yeah, let's blame him!) Happened on whose watch? Sorry for pricking a
hole in the testosterone levels, but I didn't start the political discussion on
the "value" thread.

As far as AAPL's bid for Vivendi's music business, I don't have an opinion yet,
I don't know enough about the valuation, the gameplan, or anything other than
what I've seen as brief headlines. I hope whatever happens, AAPL includes more
value for the shareholder than they have in the past few years, but I suspect
that won't happen.

Timba, if you invest with the reasoning you use for economics and politics you
must be in bad shape.

-The bubble burst in Spring 2000, three quarters before Bush came to office.
The consequences were set in stone by the size of the bubble which was
permitted by the Clinton/Gore Administration. It should be obvious that the
subsequent dozen cuts in rates and large tax cut were the right measures. The
reason they have not done much is because the prior excesses, such as gross
overspending on technology capital investment, were so enormous.

-As far as 9/11 goes, since I live in the neighborhood and knew folks who were
killed, I find your view reprehensible. The WTC bombing in 1993 and subsequent
attacks on overseas USA targets were essentially ignored by the Clinton/Gore
Administration. The Torricelli (Dem.) Amendment effectively demoralized and
emasculated the CIA and intelligence agencies. To set up a Homeland Security
Agency and make sure that all agencies were well coordinated was the
Clinton/Gore administration's duty to protect the country once it became clear
that we were being targeted. Yet the Clinton/Gore administration did nothing.
To blame 9/11 on Bush who had been in office 7 months at the time of the attack
is ludicrous.

-As far as invading other countries goes, I think I will take the opinion of 25
million Iraqi's over yours as to the merits of that. Totally aside from
disabling WMD availability issues, freedom of Arabs in the Middle East is, in
my opinion, the single best chance that we have as a country to reduce the
dangers to our children and grandchildren.

Thank you so much for spewing back the media line, I really wasn't getting
enough of it from the US media.

The previous terrorist incidents were all the more reason for any (gee, that
does include this one too)administration to have been on heightened alert, and
yet they weren't.

The WTC bombing in 1993 and subsequent attacks on overseas USA targets were
essentially ignored by the Clinton/Gore Administration. 

Were they now? Let's see, since you love the party line, then the approach is:
Say it often enough and it must be true, right?

As far as 25 million Iraqis are concerned you mean kind of like what is shown
in this photo? http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article2842.htm

I'm not proposing these people's point of view, just wondering why all the real
journalism is now relegated to op-ed pieces now?

With the exception of some small pockets of folks in Baghdad, all the
jubilation seems to be coming from either the Kurds or the looters (by the way,
another example of great administration foresight).

As far as 9/11 goes, since I live in the neighborhood and knew folks who were
killed, I find your view reprehensible.

Living in the area gives you no moral imperative. I live in the same country
that this was allowed to happen to some of the best and the brightest. What I
find reprehensible is the attitude you display about trying to find the facts.

It should be obvious that the subsequent dozen cuts in rates and large tax cut
were the right measures. And just why should that be obvious? Market
performance since then perhaps? The strengthening of the US economy since then
perhaps? The exploding US deficit perhaps? Why should tax cuts proposed based
on bogus 10 year pie-in-the sky projections have any better chance of being
positive for an economy than business plans and numbers based on falsity?

The military cutbacks you allude to were started right after the cold war
ended. The current party in power has controlled Congress since 1994. If I
remember right, their priority was in vilifying a President for lying about an
affair. That surely did seem more important to them than America's security
here or abroad.

There's enough blame to go around for both parties. The problem today is that
an unbiased look at the party in power and its policies is always Un-American.
Oh, yeah, that's right, it's Un-American to question the administration during
a war (that is, if it's Republican-generated), but then again, we're always in
a state of war now, aren't we? So I guess it'll be Un-American to be American
for at least another 6 years, for I have no doubt the current regime will be
re-installed. I'd say re-elected, but then that implies they were elected the
first time doesn't it?

BP, My thoughts on ALU are that there's info missing. The creditors are forcing
ALU into bankruptcy yet they're co-plaintiff's in the law suit against the
insurance companies.

The creditors must be of the opinion that bankruptcy is better avenue as they
seem to be abandoning ship. Their claim that ALU misrepresented assets goes
hand in hand with the lack of warning from ALU that the company would be in
default on their loans just a few weeks after stating that financing
arrangements had been made.

For me, this was an asset play with the insurance issue being an instrument to
release the hidden value. If the creditor's claim is correct, then there's
likely to be no hidden value. If there's truth to the claim of misrepresented
assets then the shareholders are screwed.

Today you can construct a box with a terabyte of storage that will hold every

portable computer fills out your classical collection a bunch.

If Moore's law holds, a terabyte hard drive costing under $100, should appear
within 5 years. If some kid shows up on a college campus with one of those
filled with MP3's, I can imagine that there will be 30,000 copies within a

I believe the turning point will come when shareholders stop putting money into
stock funds and I believe that day is coming very soon. I am very concerned
when CEOs and Boards have so much control that it may even be more risky than
it used to being a bond investor. It is seeming to me that CEOs of companies
have less and less hesitation about filing for bankruptcy as long as they are
protected and most of them are. After that the companies who have been
prudently managed now have to compete with companies operating in bankruptcy,
who seemingly care little about making profits just about generating sufficient
cash flow to pay the salaries and keep the post bankruptcy creditors happy. I
no longer have confidence to recommend any mutual funds to anyone for their IRA
money. How does the rest of the board view this? When major corporations shield
their debt, manipulate their inventories, and significantly underfund their
pensions, how does one invest long term?
I really believe that if pension managers or even small investors sat on these
boards this stuff just would not be happening.

Madharry,

I disagree re: "no mutual funds to put money into". But then I would never
recommend any funds to others period. :-) If cornered, I would probably split
50-50% SP500 (Large growth - growth? what growth? :-))))) and something like
Dodge&Cox (large value) and 5-10% some small cap fund - I don't have great
suggestions there. :-)

For you though - and this is not a recommendation :-)) - I'd suggest TAVFX.
Marty Whitman invests exactly in bankrupt companies and is definitely an active
shareholder for companies where TAVFX has a large percentage of holdings. So if
you want to benefit from bankruptcies and from active mutual fund holders TAVFX
is a place to go.

Rite Aid (RAD: news, chart, profile) took

of the drug-store chain's improving
operating performance in recent years.

The rating agency also liked the looks of

facility. Earlier Monday, Rite Aid said it
would offer $350 million in seven-year
secured notes as part of a planned
refinancing to replace the company's senior

Separately, a Raymond James analyst

How does one invest long-term if you can't trust major corporations?

Avoid the major corporations. Find companies you can understand and trust or
funds that invest in them. Over the past three and five years, you won't find
any large cap funds or indexes in the top performer ranks.

Chasing SP500 stalwarts since 2000 has been much like chasing the big tech

MAS has moved up somewhat from recent lows but p/e on expected '03 earnings is
still relatively low. I like that p/sales is relatively (compared to previous
years) low, and that MAS has relatively decent profit margins. Dodge and Cox,
the fund mentioned here favorably, is the largest mutual fund stockholder.

I don't like the increasing and large debt and the very possible diminished
outlook for home builders and home suppliers. (i.e. MAS in cabinets, plumbing
supplies, etc.) Also there's the controlling shareholders (Manoogian family)
and CEO Manoogian's very high salary.

Larry these are very general statements. In my opinion, there are many quite
profitable car companies in Japan and Europe. German car companies like
Mercedes and BMW have very good margin's and ROE and good LT growth rates so
the economics are nowhere comparable to most airlines. I could not care less
about the marginal economics of GM, F and Chrysler now part of Daimler, which
are consistently bleeding market share and have high pension obligations and
are negative cash flow over the long term. I'd rather own a very well managed
company in a mediocre business than a mediocre company in good business. I
would have no problem investing in LUV if it were trading at a PE ratio around
10 similar to well managed car companies (LUV has a PE of 22 right now).

Catalina Marketing, that is. It's the company that has those annoying round

Yesterday they announced a revenue miss, coupled with big write-offs, projected

Modest debt, minimal cash. ROE 21% ROIC 19% PE 11-15 FCF 10X

Business is terrible in UK. Problems in the drugstore sector (FDA may not like
computer-generated booklets giving side effects of prescriptions with

Traditional business is growing at double digit annual rates. (I believe I

that they monopolize their niche??

I started buying yesterday in the 14's to incentivize myself into spending time

Now that I look further, I see that POS doesn't do those coupon canisters. They
own the checkout. They give register receipt coupons, track purchases with the
loyalty cards, and do data mining on it. (They probably share the info with Tom
Ridge.) They are in 17,000 stores reaching 210 million individuals and 17,000
pharmacies reaching 16 million households weekly.

Their website claims 250 million weekly transactions at over 21,000
supermarkets worldwide. 100 million households logged in loyalty programs. 4.5
billion customized promotional messages yearly.

It looks like they get some up front fees from the retailers to put their
computers and thermal printers at the cash register. They cut deals with the
manufacturers on exclusivity for product cycles.

They may be nearing 'build out', so capital needs would decline. I'm concerned
that revenue slowdown may be due to lessening upfront fees. Theoretically this
should be a very profitable business with minor capital costs. If free cash
flow approached cash flow, it would look very attractive.

I'm assuming that the current quarter will sport a bigbath writeoff. They've
been buying back shares. But they have lots of options outstanding (higher
priced than current).

Does anyone have better insight into the business model?

More about HPQ as a small part of a value portfolio.

I'll guess that if the typical value investor has 10-25 stocks, then an opinion
on HPQ will be difficult. To buy HPQ, that would wind up being between 4 and
10% of one's portfolio. (if one other stock is dropped) So to buy now, a person
would have to be extremely comfortable that HWP is at a most reasonable low
(That's an opportunity that was months ago maybe.), or be very assured that
he/she knows quite a bit about HWP's products and future. I claim such
knowledge is extremely difficult to obtain. After all, HPQ has over 140,000
people in various divisions (before Ms. Fiorina gets through with her axe.) To
see what these people in total are doing for future products or doing to
counter current competition, is extremely difficult.

I look at HPQ not even as a potential 1% of a portfolio. True, if HQP were to
rise 25-50%, I would not see much profit in the portfolio. On days like today
though, my portfolios seem to rise sometimes regardless of the stocks held. On
these rare days, when so many value stocks are up, liddle-biddy $ moves in a
lot of stocks add up to a decent gain.

So sometimes like today I see it important to just be in the ballpark about a
stock's value and almost more importantly to be in the stock itself to get
gains when the market improves.

-g- Too bad though I can't be so positive about HPQ itself in this view. If
it's a value stock, you were better off not owning it today: it would've been
one of the few that was down.

Regional banks -
I bought a position in BNK recently. After researching regional banks i decided
to look for growth,focus, LT track record and dividend yield (in that order).

After screening, there seem to be two different sort of regional bank value
stocks:
a) the expansive type (NFB, BNK) which tend to have higher growth but also
higher P/B and lower dividend yield. The better ones of those banks are
efficiently managed and have higher earnings growth rates
b) Stalwarts - small regional banks with low P/B ratio and growth but high
dividend yields (FMER and UPC).

I liked about BNK the regional focus & market share in rural New England and
the ability of management to manage the expansion efficiently. NFB is a very
efficiently managed bank in Long Island - i liked both of them and it basically
boiled down to a coin toss.

least equalled the others but I can tell you that I've owned it for over 15
years. FMAGX is Magellan. I'll tell you about PBTAX later.

Actually I owned a small start up bank in Northern Wisconsin from 1966 but that
was bought by ASBC in the late 80's and upon becoming aware of Associated
Bancorp I realized they had enjoyed an awfully rapid rise in price prior to the
acquisition of my bank. Since then I have found occasion to check my return on
the stock and though I cannot remember exactly what it was, I felt it was very
good which would be ahead of my long term return of 1% a month.
PBTAX is an old regional bank fund (Pilgrim) which I'm certainly not
recommending. It did poorly as a closed end fund and finally about 5 years ago,
went open for a quick bounce. Then, when it did not do so well again, they
changed their charter to include other types of financials perhaps 3 years ago.
My experience is that as investors evacuate such a fund, it eventually becomes
small enough that it can be merged into another bigger fund in the family
without affecting the reported history too much. Anyway, I used that fund as a
comparison for ASBC over the years and always found Associated by far the
better investment.

The company has accumulated small banks from across Wisconsin, and more
recently parts of Illinois and still more recently into Minnesota. Seems to
manage a good growth rate though I'm not usually a fan of growth through
acquisition without carefully checking to see how much goodwill and intangibles
have been put on the books. You'll have to check that yourself as I am trying
to exit this stock for personal reasons. But it has a long history of good
performance IMO. Lance

FBRSX is a no-load small bank fund, and also has the most assets.
here is a chart:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FBRVX&d=c&k=c1&c=burkx,hssax,senbx,asbc&a=v&p=s&t=
y&l=on&z=m&q=l
FBRSX - FBR Small Cap Financial 316m (million) in assets, NL exp ratio (ER) =
1.53%
BURKX - Burnham Financial A, 80m assets, load, 1.60 ER
SENBX -Senbac Hilliard, 67M assets, load 1.75 ER
HSSAX - Emerald Bank and Fin, 35M, load, 2.35% ER
not listed on chart: BANCX, Diamond Hill, 9M assets, Load, 1.60 ER
These are the small bank funds that i follow, I have been invested in the FBR
fund for about a year.
I'd much prefer the diversifed approach to owning small regional banks than
picking one or two and hope they don't hit an air pocket. I'll pay the expense
ratio for diversification. The ERs are high because of the small size of the
funds.
Here is a list of the best performing financial funds for the past 1,3 and 5
years: http://biz.yahoo.com/p/tops/sf.html

If you are interested in small bank funds, why don't you look at the closed-end
fund JHFT. Expense ratio of 1.16% and trading at a 15.8% discount to NAV?

Top ten holding have a couple big banks, but most of the banks I have never
heard of. (I don't own this myself, but it looks somewhat less expensive than
the open-end funds.)

Thanks for the idea, but look at the performance of the JHFT compared to the
funds i posted. I'll gladly pay an extra .50 ER for 10% better annual
performance. I will research other closed end funds in the banking sector. The
problem is, i think, that the funds i listed are really "boutique" funds, tiny,
that specialize in quite small banks. That has been a very fertile area. C,
Wachovia, Wellsfargo, BAC, etc are owned in many funds of different kinds.
again, thanks for the idea. BTO is another JH bank closed end fund, but its
performance has not been impressive either. larry
