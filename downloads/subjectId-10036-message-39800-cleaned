Wallace Rivers: That was a nice pop in Royal Cruise.

For now, I'll continue to hold on to my shares.

---------
Reviewing my history of posts here on cruise ships, it looks like I added to my
position in RCL when the company eliminated its dividend, and also when the
stock dropped maybe on disappointing earnings news. In retrospect I made errors
in selling out of CCL (Carnival) on similar disappointing news, and compounded
it by never reentering CCL.
====================
Aside: When I review a stock that's behaved like RCL and see the results I get
or got, it reinforces my view of how I might want to deal with positions I buy
in other stocks. This is a very dangerous mindset: When somebody is pleased
with the way an operation has worked out, that method gets reinforced mentally,
and then gets repeated in subsequent plays. ("It's worked for me before, and so
that's the way I do it next time or every other time.") But that method may be
very suspect or dangerous or sub optimum. Anyway, note here, from RCL in
particular, how at this point I might get some mental reinforcement to continue
considering averaging down on losing positions.

With the stock now about $42/sh., here's the chronological buy history for RCL
and purchase prices I paid, according to my brokerage account:

04/24/2008 $31.70
05/23/2008 $27.58

$7.00/share and got $13.50/share.

I think the real value was buying Ford when they refused the government loan

As far as cruise lines goes, one money manager brought up one of them i cant

Avg. down and pyramid up: I generally decide before I make an initial buy which
way I will go, or if I won't add at all.

Since being mostly a value investor I am buying stocks when they are down and
often when they are dropping, I tend to want to lag in (average down) on my
buys. If I were investing in themes - for example believing commodities will
increase - for example your bets that silver will continue to rise and/or mines
developed, or my bets that oil shale properties will continue to be in demand
and be developed -- then as those themes seem to come to fruition and provide
confidence, then I will want to increase positions.

To me it seems there are many more companies that revert to mean values with
changing management or business cycle, than there are companies that fail to do
this and go bankrupt, so it's an overall profitable strategy to average down,
even assuming I'll get the occasional terrible clunker. As far as "working out
better", I'd guess averaging up has worked out better, because there's profits
all the way up on every addition purchased. Plus sometimes, since I just seem
to have more confidence and enthusiasm with such stocks, so the buys are bigger
(than with avg. down buys of downtrodden stocks), and so the gains seem to be
bigger too. And faster.

Of course, all this jmo based on my memory of what my experience seems to have
been.

SKX having a rough day today. Didn't meet analysts' earning estimates, and
stock's dropped sharply. Company says retailers over-ordered and are returning
some inventory. Perhaps the fad hit-product "shape-ups" is overdone now.

Inventory issues have hit the company before, and they seem to have taken a
quarter or two for the problem to be resolved, and the stock to again resume
growth. I expect same to happen this time.

My interest in the company is in its history of delivering growth, and not from
it's one-time hit "shape-ups".

Previously I'd cut back my position somewhat, and then began adding some in the
$30-34 range. With the stock down last night, I began adding more after-hours,
and I've added more this morning.

Company at $19+ now. According to Yahoo, there's $5.75 in cash, very low d/e.
Company has been profitable 9 of past 10 years, with increasing book value 9
out of the 10. Always a concern is the controlling Greenberg family who, imo,
aren't always aligned with us outside shareholders.

The average of analysts' estimates for next year is $3.20. If that gets cut --
say by 15% to $2.72 -- that still leaves SKX at $19 at about p/e 7. I looked
briefly at several shoe retailers. There's none which sells under p/e of 10 now
except SKX. Only SKX and RVI (DSW stores) that I find, have a foward estimate
p/e under 10.

Imo, at $19, the stock's got a very good shot at hitting $26-28 (1.4x my $20
est. of bv next year) after a couple of quarters pass.

I intend to continue buying if/as stock continues to fall (assuming no further
adverse news).

More Portfolio Management - Building the Value Basket

Hi Paul -

When you build your value basket of E&O stocks what is the size of each
position, how many positions provide sufficient diversification and what is
your total portfolio exposure target?

I am initially looking at building a total portfolio position in small E&O's at
5% portfolio exposure I am targeting five or more companies with .07% portfolio
exposure each. I plan on buying shares in no more than three separate buys over
3-6 months time period. If any one position represents more than 3% of the
portfolio, I will re-balance the position based on my general "basket" sell
criteria.

The "basket" sell criteria is to begin to peel off shares when the basket of
E&O's begin to approach 8% of the total portfolio taking out shares from both
the top performers and selling out the bottom performers.

The key is to let the winners run to where the initial seed money is returned
and/or general "basket" ROI meets or exceeds 5% annual yield (selling options
or hedge by including some high yielding preferreds in the basket mix).

I have tried to establish an initial game plan going into the investment build
up rather than just randomly buying many different positions.

My Basket Mix so far:

MHR_PC 10.25% - I include the income generated to my E&O basket
MHR common shares (Full position)
up to 50% MHR covered calls - income added to the basket
GMXR common (Full position)
SSN common (1/3 position)
MPET common (no position yet but like the company profile)

====================================================================

I do not count the larger companies I own that have E&O divisions like MDU, BKH
& WMB.

Keep throwing out ideas and other potential E&O candidates. You offered
Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. Comm(AMEX: NOG) about a year ago which I watched
move from $7.00/share to over $19.00/share. At the time you warned that it was
a very speculative bet but now the company actually makes money with a forward
PE of 19.

EKS, I'd say my e&p positions (including suppliers to those companies),
comprise somewhat more than 10% but less than 15% of my entire portfolios.
That's the percentage based on lumping all that I have - all brokerage accounts
and all cash funds, income/preferred funds and stocks. Not sure where I am with
all the "parked monies" -- bond and preferred funds, utilities, cash . I guess
if these are removed and I just consider plain ole stocks, then e&p related
might represent between 15 and 20%

No e&p position is higher than 4% of my total portfolio value.
One of my largest holdings and biggest losers is still ATPG.

I have perhaps 25 different e&p companies, with three or four being very
outsize (relative to the others).

I am trying to establish positions in several oil (not gas) shale plays. It's
basically a bet on the success of horizontal drilling. What I want to do is buy
into these positions now, before the crowd. I measure the crowd by looking at
e&p and shale discussions on other SI threads.

Imo, the current "popular" plays (2010 going into 2011) in the general media
seem to be the Bakken shale (Three Forks/Sanish) (or area, if technically it's
not shale) and Eagle Ford (in Texas). Eagle Ford apparently has drawn quite a
bit of interest from very positive comments made by EOG which has accumulated a
big acreage. (I hold a few EOG shares). For Bakken, some examples I have are
AXAS, BSIC, USEG. The Bakken extends into Canada (or if you're Canadian the
Bakken drops into the US -gg-). I'm interested (own) Canadian-based companies
that either operate in the Canadian Bakken and/or especially have operations in
the US. Some of these seem to be (I am guessing) fairly obscure -- such as
Freehold (FRHLf.pk), Reliable Energy (REL.v), Primary Petroleum (PIE.v), Nuloch
(NLR_A). Of course there are the larger companies - Petrobakken, Petrobank,
Crescent Point, etc.

My bet is that the up-and-coming shale play (2011 going into 2012) will be the
Niobrara. I am trying to acquire shares in every small publicly-traded e&p
company that has land holdings there. Some of the value, I am hoping, is not
yet reflected in their stock prices. That is, land that was leased for $5/acre
a few years ago, is now selling for $2000-5000/acre in some areas. So the early
movers into the area, have an advantage. This may (or may not) be true of
companies with holdings and operations in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Wattenberg
Field area of the Niobrara. Anyway, I have positions in SYRG, WRES, SSN
(large), DPTR.

There are a few companies that have holdings in several or all of the above
areas. This includes MHR, ROSE, SDCJF.

If these recent horizontal drilling techniques will give economic life to
geological formations here in the US, it only seems natural to me that I would
be interested in these same geological formations that might occur in other
countries. So I'm betting on horizontal drilling in France (HES, TRGL), Poland
(FXEN), Australia (BPT), Turkey (TAT).

I'll just add that I'm setting up positions for what I believe (guess) will be
North American shale plays going into 2013 (Cardium, others).

And of course there are different e&p plays. Some North Sea e&p's look
undervalued to me based on nav. And I like some plays in South America and
Thailand.

More comments later.

Paul interesting post regarding E&P. I wonder how you deal with the value
aspect:

 I am trying to acquire shares in every small publicly-traded e&p company that
has land holdings there.

Do you actually look at the value of all those companies, or do you buy them
unseen, as long as they are "undiscovered". I am having trouble to value those
little critters.

Just to name on example - I looked into SYRG.OB - 22M$ in market cap - total
assets ~22M$, but only 1M$ equity and ~12M$ in convertible debt.

Revenues last quarter were ~1M$, expenses 2.7M$. These numbers don't scream
value to me - what do you do? Look at potential land value - where?

DPTR is another one of those - didn't they hype this huge gas field in the
Columbia River basin that turned out to be a dud after all?

From:Paul Senior
You are correct, imo. There's no way to value these two that I see. I've bought
and have losses with them (which is deserved, I guess). I'll continue holding
though to see what happens. SYRG's focus in prolific Wattenberg area may prove
to be okay. DPTR likely to be a write-off for me.

These two companies as well as a couple others are very sparse with information
as to what lands they control. Significantly too, sections underground, in
several instances (given state laws) may be split and leased separately, i.e.
the leasing of certain shale levels and/or shale gas rights vs. oil rights. So
it's very difficult for me to figure out what each company's land holdings
actually are and what they mean, unless the companies are forthright. And
sometimes - like these two - they give no useful presentations or website
information.

For the Niobrara, I'm not looking for confirmation that the particular company
is a value. I'm interested in acquiring shares in every one, and I'm betting
I'll have a couple of very good producers or land-holders, and that the stocks
of these will far outdo the losses I'll have in the other e&p Niobrara stocks
where the companies just don't make it.

mar 2009 - 0.37$

Price today is 0.7$

Even if they have balooned their assets two times it is still 50% undervalued

Two years ago I came upon this analysis:

May 21, 2008
Rapid Growth Potential with a Kazakhstan E&P: BMB Munai, Inc. (amex: KAZ)

Rapid Growth potential with a Kazakhstan E&P

BMB MUNAI (AMEX-KAZ, $6.95)

Investors seeking an international junior oil producer with rapid growth
potential should consider an investment in BMB Munai. This company has a 100%
interest in a 460 square kilometres concession in western Kazakhstan, known as
the ADE block. This block is located within 28 km of oil pipelines and is fully
covered with modern seismic undertaken in 2003. Infrastructure, rail and roads
allow the firm to quickly bring oil production to markets. In addition, BMB has
the right to explore an adjacent area known as the "extended territory".

The ADE block consists of carbonate Triassic formations, typically found at
3100-3800 metres (10,161-12,500 feet) below surface. Exploration drilling at
the ADE block to date has proved up two oil fields, known as Aksaz and Dolinnoe
fields. To date, a total of 8 wells have been drilled at these fields.
Production from 4 Aksaz wells to date average 216 bpd. The 4 Dolinnoe wells
have produced an average of 99 bpd.

Investors have found some Kazakhstan oil plays to be a frustrating experience

Kazakhstan exploration and production companies have sought to develop both
sandstone reservoirs and carbonate reservoirs. There has been a clear
correlation between the success of a junior in Kazakhstan and the type of oil
reservoir targeted for development. Historically, companies in Kazakhstan that
developed sandstone reservoirs generally grew production steadily, were highly
profitable and eventually were bought out.

Kazakhstan companies that develop oil production from carbonate reservoirs
have, on the other hand, often experienced difficulties in trying to coax oil
flows from the "tight" shale like deposits. Wells plug up frequently and are
tricky or expensive to stimulate. Production can be highly erratic. Some
juniors find carbonate reservoirs to be problematic, and financial results have
been disastrous in certain cases. Accordingly, sophisticated investors prefer
sandstone reservoir producers.

BMB's newish discovery has the potential to be, by junior standards, a "company
maker"

Until 2006, BMB was considered one of the "carbonate" companies, and traded at
a steep discount to global peers based upon reserves. The discovery of a
sandstone reservoir in the Kariman prospect may have changed fortunes for the
better. A total of 6 wells have been drilled over the past 2 years in a
relatively uncomplicated sandstone formation. Average production has been
surprisingly good, at 528 bpd per well. BMB intends to drill at least 4-6 more
wells into this structure within the next 12 months. I am confident that
equally high levels of productivity might extend to future wells in the Kariman
field.

Proven reserves are likely to grow rapidly in 2008

BMB reported 14.95 million barrels of proven reserves in 2007, which included
2.7 million barrels attributed to one successful Kariman well.

Since that report, a total of 5 more Kariman wells have been drilled. All were
successful.
Probable and possible reserves attributed to Kariman were 20.1 million barrels
in 2007. A shift of some of these reserves to the proven category should have
occurred in 2008, based on this success.

Production looks to be on a steep growth curve, albeit from a modest base

In 2006, production averaged 624 bpd. Average production for 2007 was 882 bpd.
For the fiscal year ending March 31st, 2008, it appears that production
averaged 2400 bpd.
This year, production might average 3700-3800 bpd. Next year, I forecast
5600-5800 bpd of average production. In 2010, production could surpass 10,000
bpd.

EBITDA looks to be increasing at an equally fast pace

I report a fully outstanding share count of 55.6 million shares. I include a
variety of "in the money" options, warrants, share grants and a $60 million
convertible debenture that verges on being "in the money". BMB has net
liabilities of 10.4 million, after assuming conversion of the debentures. This
results in a current enterprise value of $391.2 million.

For fiscal 2007, EBITDA was $2.5 million. In 2008, EBITDA was approximately
$38.7 million. For 2009, EBITDA could surpass $61 million. At this level of
EBITDA, capital expenditures and SG&A look to be about fully met. In 2010,
EBITDA could surpass $90 million.

Based upon my forecast, BMB is selling for roughly 6.4X my 2008 EV/EBITDA ratio
and 4.3X next years' forecast EV/EBITDA ratio. This represents a discount to
valuations for 11 other international junior E&P firms in my sample.

Management's interests seem to be fully aligned with common shareholders, a
rarity in Kazakhstan

BMB is considered to be the first public oil and gas company listed in the US
that is operated and controlled by Kazakhstan citizens. Management and insiders
control roughly 34% of the outstanding common shares. BMB's CEO is Boris
Cherdabayev, a well known member of the Kazakhstan oil community. The
Cherdabayev family has ties with many of the leading public and private
companies now operating in Kazakhstan.

As a largely Kazakhstan company, BMB may be better prepared to operate in the
Kazakhstan oil business than foreign run firms. Unlike many junior oil and gas
firms that I have followed in Kazakhstan, I am impressed with management's
attention to detail during the exploration and development stages of the field
concession. Often, juniors take shortcuts in their efforts to quickly get
production flowing. In Kazakhstan, shortcuts generally cost a firm its
concession. A rigid oil ministry often pulls licenses for failing to comply
with exploration contracts to the letter. When this happens, local Kazakhstan
firms readily swoop in and claim potentially valuable assets for themselves.

BMB, thus far, has taken great pains to exceed all terms and conditions of its
concessions, at the expense of short term production growth. Many of the ADE
and extended territory wells can produce from multiple horizons. Management
carefully tests all productive zones and shuts in wells periodically to satisfy
conditions spelled out by the government. Current rates are being reported from
just one zone in each well. It seems clear to me that rates from all fields
will jump during the production phase.

One caveat to this story is that tax rates for BMB will jump dramatically in
the latter half of 2009

Investors should note that oil producers in Kazakhstan are required to sell 20%
of all oil production to local markets, at local prices. This is priced at
25%-27% of quoted Brent. Remaining output may be exported at world prices.

All export production in Kazakhstan is now subject to a recently imposed export
tariff of $14.95 per barrel. BMB export sales also have freight and shipping
charges of $14.15 deducted from quoted Brent prices.

BMB presently pays a modest royalty (2%-6%) on production, as the firm is in
the exploration phase on its oil fields. Production licenses are to be sought
on July 9th, 2009. Upon conversion of the concessions to a production license,
the fiscal terms change considerably. In addition to increased royalties, an
export rent tax, based upon a sliding scale will apply during the license
phase. At current prices, this tax is 33%.

To put this into simple terms; while in the exploration phase, BMB should
receive roughly 63% of Brent benchmark prices for its output.

For all of 2009, taking into account that BMB will have lower taxes until July
9th and higher taxes thereafter, the firm should receive an average of 54% of
Brent benchmark in that year.

In 2010, after the license agreement is fully in force, BMB should receive
roughly 46% of world prices after all government taxes, levies and shipping
charges apply.

In order for BMB to simply remain as profitable in the license phase as they
are at present output will need to increase by 36%, or 1332 bpd. For many
junior companies in Kazakhstan this would represent a real challenge. As I
estimate that BMB's oil output may grow by a further 6300 bpd over the next 24
months, the new taxes should not be problematic.

It is possible that BMB will shortly become a self funded producer

In the next 24 months, accelerated development at Kariman might push total oil
production from all fields to above 10,000 bpd. It is possible to envision 2010
EBITDA of $120 million. At that rate, BMB could dramatically step up
development of all fields, without having to issue more shares or add debt.

BMB is my top Kazakhstan oil pick for US investors

Unlike a number of US junior firms which have "tried and failed" in Kazakhstan,
local management at BMB is intimately familiar with the workings of the oil
ministry. BMB has at least one uncomplicated field with some real upside
(Kariman), which is all a junior generally needs to become self funding.
Management also seems keen on the outlook for the Aksaz and Dolinnoe fields. I
consider any potential success from these fields to be an added bonus. If
production growth meets my forecast, BMB could be fairly valued at $15 per
share, or 6.5X my 2010 estimated EV/EBITDA ratio.

I have recently purchased BMB for RMG#2 as an overweight position. To see my

Hello Spekulatius,

Going back to some of our discussion before the September run on oil stocks,
for example TOT.

As the price of oil and gas change, do you modify your $15/oil and $1.5 for gas
values for reserves?

I still own TOT and am liking it long-term. In general, I'd like to add to TOT
and other good long-term plays in the oil sector, but I'm hesitant here given
the recent rise in oil stocks given the rise in Oil prices and the market in
general. I think in the long-term oil is going up, but short-term I think there
are various reasons to see it back in the 70's. So, I'm hoping to come back
into oil stocks if that happens. That being said, I bought some NE this week
and am at least considering other plays in the sector, but values are looking
weaker than they were two months ago.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

Re: Laclede Group Inc. (LG) - 

Hedged my long position with December $35 covered calls. LG is my largest

yield is not that compelling and better opportunities may be had in December.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=lg%20ato%20wmb%20se%20ni

Looking to have the stock called away. I have peeled off shares from the others
(except WMB) in the group taking about 30% off the table. YTD returns w/
dividends have averaged 18% to 39% (NI & SE being the best performers). I have
actually added shares to my WMB position recently as they have NG gathering
systems that are valuable that generate steady and growing income for the
company.

Many of my hybrid utilities w/ NG storage & transportation and/or E&P
subsidiaries have reported good earnings. Except for MDU, the group continues
to edge higher (up 17%-34% YTD) and pay better than money market yields.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=pom%20bkh%20ede%20d%20agl%20mdu

Will continue to hold these but will begin to peel off shares of those that
have lower than average dividend yields and/or higher forward PEs.

The exception is MDU which is my conservative E&P stock. They have interests in
the Niobrara oil shale region (88K acres) and 67K net acres in the Bakken oil
basin (Heart River area). On any further sell off, I may take some proceeds
from the above sales and buy more MDU below $19.00/share.

MFCAF tender,

Sorry folks, but I tendered my MFCAF shares today. Experts agree that MFCAF
should be worth more than TTT, and for that reason a non-tender makes sense,
but I tendered for two reasons.

First, I own a fair-sized slug of TTT, much more than my MFCAF. It is good for
TTT, and I think it will be ok for MFCAF.

Second, I prefer NYSE stocks to roach-motel pink sheet stocks with poor
liquidity and sparse information. My current executions on MFCAF at my broker
are poor. The market makers my broker routes to won't show my bid/offer unless
I call them up and explicitly ask. That means I basically have to cross the
bid/ask spread whenever I trade. I think a listing could save a fair amount in
transaction costs over time.

That being said, I don't blame MFCAF shareholders for being frustrated and hope
they don't hold it against me.

Yes, Skywest hasn't made a run like RJET, but I think I'm going to hold out for
a correction. :) Also, I liked RJET specifically given my familiarity with the
airlines being combined.

That being said, three things are really working out for the airlines these
days:

1) The mergers and combinations have taken so many large airlines out of the
game, that the supply/demand ratio has improved tremendously.

2) I haven't seen a bunch of airlines being started to compete at low prices to
undercut existing players. I'm assuming this is just related to a general
risk-off mentality of corporations/investors these days in comparison to before
the crash.

3) The low dollar would seem to encourage international flights to the U.S.,
some of which would be on U.S. Airlines.

I think as long as new airlines aren't financed and started, the existing
airlines may have a good run, but I'm still shy of the industry. Maybe if RJET

hasnt said much of anything about this in quite awhile. Unfortunately I just
see this snowballing as once consumers, retirees , business get wind that a

What Mr. Buffett did say about the muni bond market, I found instructive.
According to him, insuring the bonds was formerly a pretty decent business. To
a large extent the bonds were issued to and held by people in the community --
businessmen, the wealthy, local retirees. Therefore, it was politically
unacceptable for local elected officials to declare insolvency or a moratorium
on interest payments. Because it would be their neighbors, friends, and
political base that would be affected.
Now though according to Buffett, the bonds are widely distributed and the
people insuring those bonds (like Mr. Buffett and his company) are not part of
the community. So there's lots less negative repercussions to the politicians
or within the community if city officials choose to default. Thus Buffett said
he believed there was now much more risk to insuring municipalities than was
commonly believed. Maybe that's why we aren't seeing Buffett so active in muni
insurance.

Where do you see the value angle in these aircraft lessors?

I follow the industry closely, and see many issues that hold me back from
considering them as value, even in a cyclical low for the industry, ranging
from:

- Huge order backlogs at manufacturers, largely unabated in this recession
(Airbus reduced A320 production by 2 per month, whereas Boeing has only been
held back by strike action / 787 production delays)
- Reducing useful economic lives of newer aircraft as compared to the past (3x
777s have already been scrapped and they were launched only in the mid-1990s,
and early 90s A320s no longer have a large market)
- The end customers are chronically lossmaking, and leases are frequently
renegotiated in C11 proceedings

non-economic reasons for investment

I see many problems with regionals that would prevent me from investing. I do
agree that we are unlikely to see more competition in the market, so yields
will likely rise. However, I do not see them as undervalued from a value
perspective, as rising yields will inevitably in the medium to long term
attract more competition that will again resume the race to the bottom in terms
of costs once again.

My specific causes for concern are:

- Limited customer base, particularly when contracted to work for one or two
major, increasing reliance on the health of not on the regional but also the
customer
- The rise of American Eagle that will occur post-separation for AMR Corp, that
will induce greater competition on new contracts as it is no longer restricted
from working only for AMR Corp
- The possible, though unlikely, threat that unions will come to their senses
and negotiate lower pilot flying rates for regionals from mainline, which will
negate the use for the smaller E-Jets (E135/145)
- It is an airline, therefore a terrible business in general

the high benefits are the problem.

one step back in the equation is the fact that public service employees have so
much pull. Locally there is a story about how the Fremont Police (Bay Area, CA)
put out a hit piece on a councilman running for election because there were
some suggestions he would back a proposal to make police take a few furlough
days a year. In local elections, a hit piece mailer has significant effects.
More commonly the unions contribute money to those candidates who support the
unions, and get out the vote for them. The candidate who puts out more mailers
has a great advantage. If you buck the unions at the local level it is very
difficult. Even at the state level, you are taking a big risk.

The way the unions got the sweetheart pension deals through was by legislating
a higher assumed rate of portfolio return. That created an assumption that more
benefits could be promised without additional cost. Absurd.

I've got the point that if any candidate or position is backed by the teachers
union or police union or firefighters union or prison guards union, etc., I
automatically vote the other way.

Hi Spekulatus -

Is it typical that the municipal (and Federal) benefits (City, State & Federal)
include full medical coverage (even dental for San Jose, CA Municipal
employees) for spouse & family both during and in retirement? The 10 years from
age 55 through age 65 would be covered by the municipality and then I suppose
Medicare would pick up the coverage.

Maybe the "Value" play is in the medical & pharmaceutical sector(s) as it is
pretty much a given that these companies should get paid for their services and
even expect to grow as the retirement pool grows.

Any solvency problem should escape this sector since they should be at the top
of the list of "guaranteed" services that must be paid.

I do not like the insurer's but do like the independent care givers,
pharmaceutical companies, medical equipment & supply distributors and
manufactures and a whole host of other secondary medical and dental service
businesses.

In Greece and all over Europe this is moot since medical coverage is already
nationalized and guaranteed to everybody.

Public debt is pretty much a confidence game. If he US were based on current
cash flow and debt metrics alone, it would barely be investment grade.

My concern is that the US is too big to fail but also to big to save. The whole
system could unravel like that:

Political tension develops between the US and China. Some time later the US
holds a treasury auction and no one shows up. Interest rates for 10 year
treasuries jump from ~2.7% to 5% (where they clear) in one day. The MTM losses
for banks, insurance companies etc. are gigantic. The treasuries become
illiquid causing a liquidity crunch. Banks start to fail due to lack of
liquidity. Treasuy yield spike higher (if they trade at all) to about 10%.
Bernanke prints another couple of trillion $. Gold hits 3000$/oz. The US$ comes
under immense pressure and the Chinese and HK release their currencies from the
US$ PEG - they float up 20% in one day. etc. etc.

Could this happen? I think it could, it would be somewhat self destructive for
the Chinese but who knows. I firmly believe that the are one failed treasury
auction away from a financial "Supergau".

FWIW, i doubt that commodities would be a good hiding place in that
scenario.Gold almost certainly would be.

I am curious what those on this board think of institutional ratings and to
what extent people use them as a tool of investment.

Standard and Poors claims that stocks rated 4 and 5 stars outperform those with
fewer stars. The whole market has 1,2,3,4 and 5 stars. Therefore, one supposes
that it would be possible to put together a portfolio of stocks or a mutual
fund that would outperform the broad market and it would simple: just buy the 4
and 5 star rated stocks, and leave out the 1,2 & 3 stars rated stocks. Why buy
an S&P 500 ETF when one could do better with a simple alternate approach?

I believe that I have seen Motley Fool also claim that their 5 star CAPS rated
stocks also do better than lesser starred stocks.

Now the skeptic in me thinks of all those parameters, such as presumed buy
date, presumed exit date, etc. that make measurement problematic. The skeptic
in me considers those touts at the race tracks who sell you a list of horses
and promise your money back if you lose (you get the purchase price of the list
back, not your losses) and only if you catch the guy and threaten him with
bodily harm. The skeptic in me considers that a statistical study of wine
testing concluded that there was no correlation between a wine's success or
lack of success in prior wine competitions to a current competition. In other
words, I doubt that a mathematician doing a valid statistical study would back
up the claim of outperformance. Any contrary argument?

For myself I put very low weight on another's opinions per se. I do look for
opinions backed up by reasoning, where the reasoning seems sound and where I

Genesis Lease in March 2010. These aircraft are still managed by GECAS and the

I think commodities will be ok. The 50% decline in shares of wilmington trust
as they announced big losses and a forced merger with M&T bank, as well as the
announcement of a likely bankruptcy filing for abk, don't auger well for
financials but do for gold and silver and related entities.

I read some of PMICO's bill Gross' diatribe about the fed. I have visions of a

Value opportunities:

- yeah, that city job was a value opportunity... years ago. So forget about it.
- Shorting munis... for people like Mike Burry who can dig deep enough to find
cities that will default and also figure out whether state/federal bailouts
will occur. Same for state bonds.
- Avoiding munis for the rest of us. Until they are so cheap that you can pick
up the ones that won't go BK for 50 cents on a dollar.
- I am not an economist, but I think that although inflation may be a solution,
it is not caused by these issues. So don't expect inflation just because San
Jose and other cities have budgetary issues. In fact, the civil service job
wage cuts are wage deflation, so a push in opposite direction. A lot of people
for some reason make a logical fallacy "inflation is a fix therefore inflation
will occur". OTOH money printing is inflationary (more money chasing fewer
goods, so prices rise), so inflation may occur from fed actions in QE++.

of 38 percent to the company's Friday close of $14.83.

Oilman and natural gas proponent Pickens, as well as the company's largest

value of Exco’s assets. Gas producers in North America need $5.60 fuel prices

Congrats EKS, I heard the news at about 7am this morning and thought of you,
and if a blackberry could operate the damn internet i would have sent congrats
sooner

I am actually over in the Haynesville shale these past two weeks for meetings.
XCO is building out there assets exponentially and it is truly remarkable, not
only that but the execution seems to be better than other operators in the area
including the company i trade for... very interesting miller trying to offer a
30% premium, my gut reaction is this is worth more and he is trying to
basically get a steal.

After your post i wanted to buy but only around the $10 range... what was i
thinking i dont know...

I am curious why you are selling off your stake? Is $20 your price target?

My only concern if you do decide to stay in is the rates of decline of the
cotton valley low co2 wells are far greater than what we thought and is the
cost benefit of the continuation of building out there gathering lines, amine
facilities etc going to pay off while also considering the competition in the
area.... but giving it the eyeball test they seem to be producing at a very
good economies of scale.

Congrats on a very good value play that i am kicking myself for sitting on my
hands

Hi Matt - See my post ( http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26928193
) as to what I decided to do w/ the XCO.

Generally I think the proposed buy out offer confirms to me that there is value
in many of these shale NG properties. With NG prices historically so low
insiders are stepping up and buying shares in these companies. XCO is an
interesting company as they have a lot of infrastructure capital investments
deployed and working. Although not fully utilized, management can see that when
NG prices get back to normal ranges ($5.00/mcf & relative to crude above
$82/barrel), that their assets are worth north of $30.00/share.

I am still following several of the E&P companies mentioned on this thread and
trying to build positions that I believe are still undervalued. With the XCO
move today, I am focusing on those E&P companies that have already made some
significant infrastructure investments but are selling near their lows due to
low NG prices.

GMX Resources Inc. (GMXR) is one that Paul Senior has mentioned which I have
been building a position in. In fact, I upped my position today by another 25%.
They own property next to XCO and have some working drilling & NG gathering
partnerships with them.

It's encouraging to see "real" money bids like XCO's come out as it verifies
that there is still significant value in many of these properties,

re XCO - is this about value or cheap funding. As I see it XCO will cash out
their equity stake, reinvest some of it and as all LBO's most of it will be
paid in debt, which is cheap right now.

Since they get a 50% premium on their equity stake (just like any other
stockholder) and most of it will be cashed out, while they also own the equity
slice in the LBO (equity slice has all the upside) I don't see how that would
not work out for them. That does not mean that XCO is a value (looks like they
value XCO @4$MCF in the ground), it just means there is dump money to finance
an LBO like that.

re WL - this story is interesting. WL was mentioned in this board and rejected
because of poor fundamentals partly. Their NPA' have been creeping up too.

I think the FDIC audited them in detail (being a TARP bank) and found problems
- then gave WL a short notice to fix them (capital raise). Apparently they were
shopped around with a gun on their head.

ALso, totally unnoticed a dinky local (for me) bank was shopped too: CHOB.OB.

OT. I'll be Keynesian here and disagree. Austerity in recession is not an

OT - Yes, I actually agree with what you're saying. I don't think we should go
into austerity mode quite yet, but hopefully pretty darn soon. That being said,
I'd like to see the social security retirement age raised for Gen X (my
generation) ASAP. I think that downsizing future government payments would go a
long way to ease any potential panic about the U.S. and the dollar now. And
they could do this at the same time they do QE2 if they wanted.

Maybe we have 5 years or more before a panic happens, but I think it all
depends on if we have an oil supply crisis. If Oil runs back up to $150 and/or
there's just not enough to go around in 2-3 years, I think that will bring a
whole bunch of other issues to a head at the same time. Hence, why I think we
need to get a new social security downsizing plan passed ASAP, for example.
