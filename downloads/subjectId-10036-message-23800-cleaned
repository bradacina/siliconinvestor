You've stated what I held off stating. IMHO, it's a great attribute to possess
a cavalier attitude if you choose to trade stocks which reside on the OTC
bulletin board (a.k.a. "pink sheets.") It has some parallels with going to
Vegas, AC, or Foxwoods.

I have enough trouble finding stocks which trade NYSE or NASDAQ NM which don't
implode, so I choose not to enter the .OB arena.
No guts, no glory, I guess.

The cavalier attitude about INSQ is interesting.

Tell me any New York Stock Exchange stock that has went from $11.00 to $91.00
in 10 days. Who cares if it is $.0011 to $.0091 or $11 to $91? They both spend,
the commission to the broker is a little higher with the penny stock, the
number of shares is higher. So what?

With Veridium I just did what you don't have the guts or smarts to do, I got a
6 bagger on my entire portfolio, because I spotted an opportunity and had the
guts to follow my belief. That's right 600% in ten days. I didn't have the guts
to max it, it could have been over 800%. I knew to do it on April 7th and I
knew to sell on April 17th. Now I am back in but not with my entire portfolio.

You will spend 25 years of conservative investing to get a 600% gain. Inseq
just gave the opportunity for a 800%+.

The run up was predictable, the scope of the run maybe not. Want proof read:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=22338784

I stated then April 8th at 04:45:11:

"With Veridium's pattern before the close today I expect a gap up on Monday, if
Veridium follows its pattern over the past couple of months and announces new
news Monday morning the action should be pretty fast and furious." The news
came on April 17th. The action indeed was fast and furious.

Put your grin in your pocket, do your home work, don't risk your all, just a
little and you might do the same with some other penny stock.

Congratulations on your success with penny stocks.
I have mentioned before on this thread that I have had my share of blow ups
with stocks, one of which eventually ended up on the BB.
I will also mention that I have had success with LTB&H stocks which started as
small OTC NM or NYSE stocks; two of which, in particular, have multiples of
gains which make me put a grin on my face, not in my pocket.

I don't have the stomach to trade pink sheet stocks, nor do I find it at all
easy to do homework on them.

I still continue to believe that trading stocks such as INSQ.OB or VRDM.OB is
little more than a crap shoot. It certainly would not qualify as "value
investing" in my estimation. Not with a slightly better than a 1:3 current
ratio, and negative net tangible assets, in INSQ.OB's case.

If you choose to place a portion of your investment assets in stocks such as
these, that's your decision, and more power to you.

I felt VRDM was an excellent play and still do.

The downside on April 7th when I put everything there was near nil. As a
company that is connected with biofuels, in a biofuels boom, in a rising oil

and back in as well as into VRDM and back out.

I bought PRVB at around .02 and i think they did do a reverse merger from some
formely failed business. i cant recall the details - but what i do recall is i
sold the last of my shares at 50 cents:

they are actually making some money and i may start to follow the company

i have had several penny stocks that were shell plays that paid out six figures
in profits from a rather small investment... one had the potential to pay 7
figures had i held all my shares and sold near the high.

im not here to spam penny stocks or convert value players. i luv playing the
pennies and i suppose if you bought a penny stock for a few cents and held some

Needless to say, Lazarus, if you've made good money, so far, and it works for
you, then go for it.

In my opinion, basing one's buys and sells, PURELY, on Technical Analysis,
News, rumour or other 'speculative issues', with no regard for the Financial
Fundamentals of any company, is not that far removed from spending money at Las
Vegas or Atlantic City.

I prefer to work on the premise that the charts will, in the medium to longer
term, reflect the underlying Fundamentals. Therefore, if one first identifies
Quality Fundamentals, then there's far less risk in knowing which way the price
chart will go.

If I look at your chart of AMGO, and I bought in on 22/2/06 at an average of
85c, after a good "gap up" on the 21/2/06, and I still held this stock today, I
would now be losing money.
The trick is to know when to jump on and off that bus in the intervening

I'd say TLB could be a decent bet as a revision-to-mean play.

That's IF I assume that there's nothing structurally wrong with Talbot's
business model, but rather that their merchandise buyers either didn't order
the right merchandise for the season, or order enough of it, or price it right.
The current season ends, and the new season brings a reset and yet another
opportunity for the buyers to get it right. OTOH, if there IS something
fundamentally wrong with TLB, then the stock might not be a buy at current
price. Some competitor companies seem to have okay earnings and have their
stocks selling nearer highs than lows (whereas as you are aware, TLB is at a
two year low), so people are out there in the current economy shopping and
buying and some stocks reflect that. So I assume there is something specific to
Talbot's. Maybe on Yahoo, there's some indication from current or past

Seeing as you asked ...

TLB : Although there’s been a modest increase in Annual and Quarterly Turnover,
there’s not much, if any, increase in TLB’s Bottom Line and concurrent EPS. The
company has a fairly healthy Operating Margin but not an especially impressive
pre-tax Return on Capital Employed. Little long term debt is a positive.
However, that lack of Bottom Line growth and Return is possibly why its price
has been moving sideways for the last year and a half.

SMA : IMO looks a better stock than TLB. Good growth in Turnover and Bottom
Line. However, Return on Capital could be better. Another +/- 6% to 8% should
make it a lot more attractive. That would mean adding about $35 to $45mil. to
its current Annual Turnover of $264mil. So, as Forbes stated, SMA’s future
attraction to investors probably depends on how many extra orthopaedic devices
etc ... it can sell !

I have not done much research on Ford lately, but the last time I looked F was
a company that sold mostly trucks and SUVs.

I will review the vehicle design, than the Ford Credit Co, and finally F's cost
structure in mfg vehicles.

The F-150 pickup is a best seller in many parts of the midwest. While the
Explorer, Expedition, and Excursion were great sellers before the spike in
gasoline prices last summer (2005).

I have a good friend that works the counter at Thrifty Dollar RentACar who says
no one rents the Excursion now because the thing gets such poor gas mileage and
weights 3 tons. I tend to believe her because I would not drive that monster at
today's gasoline prices. (But I did not like it before, either.)

My sister-in-law has a 2002 Expedition she uses to commute around town; she
likes the drive and comfort of the vehicle. She has 3 children, 2 teenage sons
approaching 6 feet and 200 lbs, and everyone can get in comfortably. Her
husband is 6'5" and weighs over 280 lbs.

I like what F is doing with the retro Mustang, and I believe the retro version
is selling here in the west. The Jaguar experiment appears to work, but do not
fool yourself. Very few people can afford a Jaguar; it is a well styled car.
The Volvo, Mazda, and Land Rover vehicles may provide a buttress in Sweden,
Asia, and the old British commonwealth. Do not discount these vehicles they are
reasonably priced and popular in their areas.

Someone needs to explain to me "What is a 500?" Is it a Galaxie, Fairlane, or
LTD? I remember the 500 logo attached to those cars when I was a boy. This new
500 is mystery. If Ford thought its new 500 could compete with the Chrysler 300
Ford was mistaken.

Next, the Ford Credit Company finances the vehicles. Also, FCC finances local
government, homes, businesses you name it. This part of the business if
profitable. It situation is similar to the GMAC subsidiary of General Motors.

FCC maintains a A1P1 rating for its short term commercial paper. Its long term
debt is under review by Moody and S & P for a downgrade. I have not checked
recently, so the 2 rating agencies may have already downgraded FCC. I need some
help here. For years I was a cash manager at a water utility and we placed our
temporary cash with FCC and always was satisfied. The people at FCC are honest
and a pleasure to work with.

Next, F problem is with the cost structure of it vehicle mfg. Its retirees are
not checking into that big garage in the sky quick enough. It costs for medical
and pension costs for its retirees are way too high. I have heard over $1,000 a
vehicle. Somehow F must get some relief here. F will either unload some of its
retiree pensions costs on the US Govt's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or
get its retirees to accept cuts in coverage, or become extinct as a car mfg
company. Fs union, the United Auto Workers must help here or it will go
extinct, too. I cannot counter the argument the UAWs time has come and gone.
The UAW maybe extinct and it does not know it yet, NO it gets in the way too
much.

F has always had hard workers on its payroll.

Do not count F out. It will respond to the high price of gasoline by producing
more fuel efficient cars. The Mazda CX- 7 is a response, the Ford Edge is a
response, time will tell if they profitable. The Ford Escape hybrid is too
scientific for my feeble mind, but some one will understand it and buy it. The
Escape is capable of 36 mpg. Also, F has staying power and a famous brand name
around the world.

Ford has $32.5 B of cash on the balance sheet as of Dec 31, 2005, with an
additional $11 B of marketable securities right under it. Long term debt is $17
B. The worrisome "Other debt" item is $37 B, this is where the post retirement
cost are located. But until now the cash flow is still positive and adding to
the cash on the balance sheet each year.

Do not discount American ingenuity. Ford gave the world the assembly line, a
color blind industrial organization, economies of scale, the model T, the model
A, the 1949 Ford, the Mustang, the F-150. Or in other words, every 10 - 15
years, F will pull a rabbit out of the hat. A enormously profitable rabbit at
that. I dare say, its American heritage is not good or commendable, rather it
is GREAT. Its culture is sloppy at times, but resilient and focused when need
be. Out of many one. F understands this better than most.

F has always had hard workers on its payroll.

For those of us with short memories, F was unprofitable, along with GM, and
Chrysler following the gasoline crisis of 1979. F response was the Ford Escort,
an upgraded Mustang II (a miss), and more fuel efficient sedans are coupes. F
survived to unleash those monsterous and profitable SUVs on the public.

Good Luck investing and keep your eye on F

weakness. I tend to think, at the moment, that most of the bad news is out- and
that F will bounce with good news (good news about F, or good news about GM-
both will probably help F's stock price).

technology to its US production I think it could be very successful. However,
it remains to be seen whether any of the domestic car companies can afford to
pay union wages. health and retirement benefits and compete in the global

Having read your comments re: FORD (F), I thought I’d add a few comments of my
own, for you to accept or reject as you see fit ...
Yes, Carey Thompson went to a lot of trouble with that reply. However, IMO only
one of the paragraphs contains really pertinent information regarding FORD’s
current financial state of affairs, viz ....
"Ford has $32.5 B of cash on the balance sheet as of Dec 31, 2005, with an
additional $11 B of marketable securities right under it. Long term debt is $17
B."

From two independent sources of Financial Statement data one reads that FORD’s
Long Term Debt, as of their last Annual Result, sits at $155.33 billion and
not, apparently, at $17 billion.

Looking at FORD’s latest set of results it seems to me that two of their main
problem areas are (1) the current cost of that Huge debt and (2) the large
increase it’s experienced in the last 12 months with regard to its Cost of
Sales.

(1) FORD’s debt is currently costing it about $7.6 bil. a year !! That’s more
than half its Operating Margin and over 3.5 times its Bottom Line, bearing in
mind that FORD paid no tax in the last period. It seems that FORD is bringing
that debt down, but there’s still a long way to go before it doesn’t
drastically impinge on its Bottom Line as it’s currently doing.

(2) In the last 12 months FORD’s Cost of Sales went up by nearly 13% from $122
bil. to over $138 bil. That was the prime cause in FORD’s 40% fall in its
EBITDA, which in turn reduced its previous healthy Operating Margin of 13.8%,
by 42%, down to 8%.

You stated that you would consider "add(ing) on weakness".
Well... IMHO you may want to consider "add(ing) on strength", if and when
FORD’s Financial Statements, hopefully, begin to show improvement in (1) and
(2) above.
After all, in the medium to longer term a stock’s price is generally "weak" for
good reason.

Date:4/25/2006 6:52:48 AM
From:Carey Thompson
BRUWIN,

You are correct about the balance sheet of F.

The balance sheet is loosely divided into automotive sector's Assets and
Liabilities. And Ford financial sector's Assets and Liabilities. A good way to
think of this is automotive is the vehicle mfr, while Ford financial is the
financing arm, bank, or depository institution (Federal Reserve terminology).

Automotive has matched assets and liabilities. F financial has matched assets
and liabilities. These distinction is enormously important in understanding the
consolidated balance sheet.

On the liabilities side of the consolidated balance sheet, F automotive Long
term debt is $17 B. The worrisome "Other debt" item is $37 B. This is the debt
the automotive sector supports. The automotive operations is used to repay this
debt. On the assets side of the consolidated balance sheet, F automotive has
cash, securities and loaned securities of $23.7 B to support the debt in tight
times. PLUS the automotive operations, which was cash flow positive in 2005
supports this long term debt. The following charts show F automotive
profitability over the last 3 years.

net inc = net income from automotive
depr = depreciation of fixed assets from automotive
amort = amortization of intangibles from automotive
cash flow = cash flow from automotive
all figures are $ millions

<pre>
net inc depr amort cap exp cash flow
2005 3,895 8,133 49 7,517 4,560
2004 155 6,397 26 6,738 (160)
2003 1,908 5,458 24 7,728 (338)
</pre>

Note F automotive was cash flow positive in 2005 by $4,460 mill while cash flow
negative in 2004 and 2003 by ($160) mill and ($338). All figures are from the
2005 Ford Annual Report's Income Statement, Statement of Cash Flows, and Note
21. The point I am making with this financial detail is F automotive has
staying power and IS NOT a cash drain that swirls down into bankruptcy.

Let's turn to F financial sector. Do not pooh pooh this point. Ford Credit must
be evaluated like American Express, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, and other
finance companies. As a finance company, it has lots of debt which should be
classified as Liabilities, not long term debt or short term debt, but financial
liabilities. These financial liabilities are supported by cash, financial
receivables, and leases on the assets side.

F financial had $136 B of debt supported by $18 B of cash, $111 B of financial
receivables, and $22 B of leases as of Dec 31, 2005. And just as important F
financial is very profitable.

<pre>
Net Income
2005 5,891 mill
2004 5,008 mill
2003 3,247 mill
</pre>
I did not include the depreciation and amortization because the income
statement for F financial includes depr and amort as a "cost & expense" so it
does not need to be added to net income to get cash flow. Also, as a finance
company F financial does not have alot of capital expenditures so I omitted
that.
The point I am trying to make here is Ford's financial sector is profitable.
And profitable when the automotive sector is cash flow negative. Or F financial
is not as subject to the ups and downs of the automotive cycle.

F is a complex company. It may be to F advantage to publish 2 completely
separate financial statements. But, I do not know if that is legal. But I will
bet my money, when I get some investible funds, along with eleutheria that F
automotive will survive, F financial will continue profitability, and the
entire F will regain profitability after this temporary spike in gas prices is
a memory. This conclusion is based on the tangible financial statements and F
history of surviving the ups and downs of the automotive cycle.

re F (Ford)
While I agree that Ford does not face an immediate liquidity crisis, i think
the financial situation is worse than the current numbers suggest. From memory,
I peg the current retirement and health liability at around 45B$. This
liability does not show up in the balance sheet, but it's very real and tends
to be growing over time. When you add up all those number, the equity of this
company is probably worthless, except the "option value", implying that somehow
these liabilities get removed (Nationalized).

Well ... thanx for that detailed reply Carey. Very comprehensive, if I may say
so.
In my case, I didn't visit FORD's SEC filings, but merely looked at the Balance
Sheet and Income Statement at Yahoo! and confirmed those numbers at another
Financial data site.

What caught my attention, with regard to your $17bil. long term debt, was the
Interest Expense on FORD's Income Statement of over $7bil. There's no way that
$17bil. of debt could generate $7bil. of Interest Expense in 12 months. Far
more likely, I believe, that $155bil. would saddle FORD with that sort of
Annual expense.

I'm sure you're correct about the profitability of FORD's Financial arm, and
you and eleutheria "may be" right about the survival and possible profitability
of their Automotive Division. Time will tell.

However, personally, I'm not one to speculate about future events if the
current numbers say otherwise, irrespective of what's occurred in the past.
Therefore, as I suggested to eleutheria, it may be prudent to buy into FORD's
strength when the numbers in their Financial Statements indicate that such a
situation exists, or is confirmed to be going in that direction.

Yes, Spekulatius, I'd go along with the contention of the inherent "retirement
cost" problem that companies such as FORD, GENERAL MOTORS, etc ... face today
and into the future.

To a large extent, I would put it down to the 'Defined Benefit' type of Pension
Scheme that these companies have in place, and which requires them to set aside
millions of Dollars in order to ensure that they can meet their future
obligations.

In my part of the world that was the norm up until 10 or so years ago, when
many companies changed to the 'Defined Contribution' Pension Scheme. Needless

Adding a little more JNJ to my position. P/e is relatively low, esp. forward
p/e (if it can be believed).

Surprising to me, the company's profit margins generally have been increasing
over the past decade (e.g. from 12-14% to 17-21+%) and now stand at about 21.5%
(per Yahoo). At first consideration, that's good. OTOH, not sure how much
better things can get from this point (21.5); maybe it's downhill.
If the high margins hold though, that'd be a stronger positive, imo, to offset
the negative of almost no sales growth (1.2% yoy quarterly rev. growth, per
Yahoo).

JNJ is moving heavily in to the diabetes market. They want to be a one stop
shopping super store for diabetics- and since that is (sadly) a growing market,
I'd say they are positioned for further growth. If someone finds a cure for
diabetes- then SELL JNJ, but until then, they are a buy (imo).

If you look at JNJ's recent acquisitions you will see their movement in to the
diabetes market (not that they aren't also moving in to other markets as well).
I think PUMP was one of the most recent companies absorbed by JNJ to further
their diabetes portfolio, and of course they gobbled up Inverness Medical (now
Lifescan Scotland) not so long ago. They will have to keep swallowing new
companies in order to grow- and I would think another way of investing in JNJ
would be to look for new innovative companies in the diabetes market, and buy
some stock in them if you think they might fit in with JNJ's other diabetes
companies. I did that with PUMP (Animas).

MCO. Yes, a stock studied closely here and/or on Buffettology threads back in
the day. A five bagger though? Yes, I see you are right. I've not realized how
far the stock has climbed. I'm showing in my account shares from 2000 were
purchased at $9+ and $11+.

Couple of ways of looking at it. The positives of benign neglect in holding on,
ignoring market fluctuations, and just letting a Buffett-type business keep
increasing the underlying business value. OTOH, in retrospect, not having the
wisdom/foresight/observation skills to increase purchases as stock climbed. For
me, I count my blessings - glad to have been in for something, than of being
out with nothing.

As regards current price, stock seems expensive to me for a buy. OTOH, this has
usually been an expensive stock. Company's moat features seem intact. Not sure
what I will do with my shares - just continue holding on or now add more. (I
won't be selling.)

I was watching MSFT today. What do you think, after digesting the earnings

Hard to quantify, although I think Wall Street was totally taken off guard by
the magnitude of the increase in spending. As you know, the Street doesn't like
surprises.

There's absolutely no question that MSFT is about the bluest of the blue chips
out there, its financials are a thing of beauty.
With limited or nil growth, it can also be argued that a PE of 20+ is not
merited, and the stock goes lower.
One other argument that can be made is that maybe MSFT is managing the forward
guidance to the low end (lowballing), setting the bar real low, enhancing the
chance for a positive surprise. I seem to recall the company doing that on
several occasions.

I have not been a buyer, it is on my watch list.

I did buy back in to RCL today. A day after a downgrade, this company surprised
to the upside; perhaps as result of RCL doing better than competitors in the
Caribbean market, which has been perceived to be softening. Onboard yields also
showed solid improvement. The kicker for me is that the Freedom of the Seas
(the worlds largest cruise ship) will launch in about a month, and I think
there will be considerable hoopla made of that in the media.

Re MSFT : While I am disappointed by the earnings guidance for 2007, I decided
that MSFT is cheap enough for me to add to tmy existing position at a little
more than 24$. Despite the miss, MSFT earning will be growing from 1.31$ to
1.40$/share or about 7%. Not great but definitely better than no growth.
Revenues will be up around 15% for Y07, which is quite respectable.
The reason for the earnings miss, is not loss of gross margin but the fact that
the company will spend (and immediately expensed) 2B$ more than anticipated.
When comparing PE, which at 1.4$/share earnings is around 17 , one should
consider that the earnings quality if very high – nearly all of the earnings
are FCF, since MSFT Capex requirements are fairly low.

MSFT is a tough competitor with vast resources. Think about the XBOX360,where
they have taken the momentum away from Sony, despite Sony’s 80% market share.
With Sony now reeling with their XBOX launch, MSFT goes out for the kill and
takes market share. Yes, they will loose 400M$/quarter (which again is fully
expensed) but it looks to me that they will level the playing field with Sony
next year at the very least.

I think the current take of the street that those 2B$ will be lost without
tangible benefit. I think that this is a far too pessimistic stance to take and
I somewhat admire the gutsy bet this company is making, since it shows that
MSFT is not run by short term earning considerations only.

-- Millions of NBC "TODAY" show fans are in for quite a treat when the morning
show sets sail onboard Royal Caribbean International's newest ship, Freedom of
the Seas. The top-rated three-hour show will bring Freedom in to New York
Harbor on May 12, 2006 where she will be christened by foster mother to
hundreds, Louise Calder. Mrs. Calder was selected by "TODAY" viewers to be the
Godmother of the world's largest ship. Adding to the excitement, "TODAY"
announced on Friday that legendary singer and songwriter Barry Manilow,
currently topping the charts around the world with his recent album, will kick
off the show's popular Summer Concert Series that morning.
"We are thrilled to introduce Freedom of the Seas to 'TODAY' show viewers,"
said Adam Goldstein, president for Royal Caribbean International. "It is
equally exciting to host world renowned superstar and icon, Barry Manilow
onboard for a live performance."
Viewers tuning in to "TODAY" on May 12 will marvel at Freedom's cruise industry
firsts including FlowRider, the first surfing simulator at sea; an interactive
water park; two cantilevered whirlpools that extend 12 feet out from the sides
of the ship; a family suite that sleeps up to 14 people; and a full-size boxing
ring.
At 160,000 GRT and holding 3,634 guests double-occupancy, Freedom of the Seas
will be the largest cruise ship in the world when she debuts in May 2006. The
first in Royal Caribbean's new Freedom class, she will sail seven-night Western
Caribbean itineraries from Miami calling in Cozumel, Mexico; George Town, Grand
Cayman; Montego Bay, Jamaica; and Royal Caribbean's private destination,
Labadee, Hispaniola. For more information or to make reservations, go to
http://www.royalcaribbean.com or call (800) 327-6700.

Interesting blogsite. Take a look at the different media charts. Comcast had
good earnings as a result of introducing their new VOIP service. This industry
is ripe for consolidation and development of new emerging technologies. I guess
the free streaming Internet video test that CBS did for the college basketball
playoffs was quite a success.

The value proposition for these companies is the potential new revenue streams
these companies can develop and provide to their current customer base. Comcast
recent results are a good example of this with their new VOIP services.

All of LLY's financial numbers look to me worse now than they have been. At
this time, it does not seem that LLY is a growth company in the sense that it
may have been in earlier years.

I presume its researchers continue researching, and that the articles I read
are true that LLY has a decent drug pipeline and/or significant drugs that
aren't facing immediate generic competition.

A stock buyer now gets a relatively-high dividend and okay net profit margins
for the stock price one pays for those margins. (For complex and difficult to
understand companies like pharmaceuticals, my preference is to make use
formulas or models, such as the relative dividend model once promulgated by
fund manager and author, Tony Spare.)

On the one hand, one can say the multi-year trend is down, with no sign of a
turn around, therefore why buy? My opinion is that at some point LLY wil
stabilize, and the stock for me is low enough now to be a value, so I will
again begin accumulating.

Hi Paul - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) is another drug company that has
traded sideways for quite sometime and is in the process of rebuilding their
drug pipeline. Both LLY and BMY pay very good dividends but it maybe another
12-18 months before their revenue growth resumes. The market try's to discount
this and by the time several quarters of positive (growing) revenue is booked,
the stock has already moved higher.

What I have done is written "in-the-money" covered calls that expire after the
x-dividend date. This way I will capture the dividend and the option premium.
If the stock is called away, I have the opportunity to rebuy the stock at
current or lower levels.

At some point out in the future, I will stop writing the calls and let the
market bid the stock higher in anticipation of these new revenues from their
growing drug pipeline.

My last LLY purchase was called away at $55 after collecting the dividend. I
was going to revisit the stock in May at prices around $51-$52 (the low end of
their long term trading range). The stock goes x-dividend May 11, 2006. It
might be a good time to re-establish my position.

JOE is one of those stocks I've missed, missed, and missed again - decades of
missing it. I studied JOE (and passed) when Max Heine recommended buying and
holding it, when his protege Michael Price (Franklin Resources), said the same
(Mutual's cost basis on their original shares is down in the pennies.),when
Marty Whitman recommended it, and when Jim Clark (of this thread) recommended
it.

Geez, sometimes some guys (like me) always never get the picture or message.

Currently I'm having a rough time with all Florida land companies, especially
the homebuilders. Continual horror stories cropping up on SI and in media of
oversupply and overinventory of property. The homebuilders are reducing
estimates, but still they are estimating profits - profits IF THEY OCCUR - that
ought to make the stocks attractive buys and/or holds. That is, the p/e's are
very low (5x-6x) given past earnings and company estimates of '06 and '07
profits. That several Florida and national homebuilders are now today on the
new lows list though is some indication that the overwhelming opinion indicates
the homebuilders will not deliver those profits. Even if they don't deliver the
profits, several homebuilders are giving assurances that they aren't
overbuilding or overpaying for land (because of using options to control land
and their willingness to let options expire). A lot of the drop in the stocks
that's been expected has already occurred -- I hope. Anyway, JOE's part of the
Florida land development scene of course, and seems to trade similarly now to
the stocks I own and follow (all moving down).

My opinion is simple(I have been a real estate broker for 22 years in Hawaii).
We are heading into a real estate recession. I have puts on JOE and DSL and
hope to buy more on others. I expect JOE to hit around $40 by the end of
summer. The real estate horror stories are, if anything, understated.
Inventories are simply ballooning off the charts. Coupled with rising rates and
over leveraged public the future looks bleak. You'd think the developers would
be smart enough to know better but they have paid the most foolish prices for
land at the top of the market...even more so than the public. Go figure.

When real estate brokers are negative, that is scary. Although maybe it means

I hate selling stocks with low p/e's that are still earning money. Not thrilled
now though about giving up all of last 12 months' gains on many of these stick
builders. Having accumulated these real estate stocks over several years
beginning in '96, they are a good size part of a couple of my portfolios.
Perhaps it's prudent to cut back. That's what I've been doing.

Another alternative would be to sell some out of the money leaps. Get some

yesterday for a very cheap price.

The key, IMO, is that inventory levels are accelerating in most(if not all) of
the hot markets at all time records. The rate of change in inventory levels is
staggering. Never seen anything like it. Perhaps it has to do with the
internet. We've never seen a real estate market that had traded with the
information aspects available through the internet. Basically, buyers and
sellers can get darn near real time info on sales figures. That used to come
through hand compilation and books, which were always months behind what was
going on.

At any rate, inventory is approaching the glut stage and will take years to
work off. This always brings on price corrections.

Homebuilders - I saw a chart recently that showed, historically, the best time
to buy the group has been when they are trading near book value. I guess
investors figure that is a good proxy for liquidation value. Land on the
balance sheet is valued at cost and in most cases below market value.

WCI is an interesting name (also FL). It is trading at a discount to its
forward book value assuming they can earn anywhere near what the Street
expects. I would caution that demand in the first quarter has been weak and mgt

WCI (TARR): Glad to see someone is at least looking at and maybe considering a
purchase of a Florida "homebuilder". That's a positive among much published
negativity. WCI, as I understand it, specializes in high-rise condo's. Which is
an area I'm really scared of. Or maybe more aptly, scared off of. I have TARR
in that venue (condos), which I've posted on before.

TARR said not two months ago, that while they saw a "marked slowdown" in some
areas, others were returning (dropping)to "more normal" levels. "Our guidance
for 2006 assumes continued sluggishness in these West Coast Florida communities
and moderate sales levels, in line with historical norms for the remainder of
the market." So their earnings picture even given moderation, is/was between
$3.17-$4.20/sh.. That's a p/e on current price in low 4's, approaching 3's.
Normally I'd be a buyer and adding to my position. This is a company that
offers some diversity away from Florida too - significant operations in New
Jersey.

Very tough though for me to hang on given media reports of excesses in condo
market. I'm selling shares today in $17 range purchased two months ago in $19
range. So for me, I've really no interest now in purchasing WCI. OTOH, maybe
we're near a bottom with many holders (cowards like me?) now capitulating. And
IF TARR can deliver on its '06 outlook and IF TARR doesn't decimate its '07
outlook, I suspect TARR will be proven to be a buy at current price. Similarly
WCI might be also.

Jmo. (Still in TARR with shares purchased 9/8/04 @ $8.90)

it will be interesting to see what WCI says next week...i have never followed
it before, but as the previous poster noted, it is now trading basically at
book, so it appears to have long term potential...could be that a dip from here
would be an opportunity for a long term investor

i listened to the aforementioned JOE conference call, and found the outlook far
from "dismal"...true their resort living segment will have a tougher year due
to increased resale listings, but they were quite positive on the rest of their
business, at least as they describe it so far...they may change their tune as
the year progresses, but their stock doesn't trade based on P/E or PEG anyway,
so their core investors probably couldn't care less about quarter to quarter
performance...i've never owned JOE, nor would i at those valuations, but it is
a much different business than someone like WCI, TARR, TOL, etc

the outlook for florida in general is quite positive in the long run, as more
and more people move there, and/or buy vacation property there, so it may be a
good idea to watch for cratering of stocks with exposure to that area, if
things do indeed slow down and depress these stocks further...it will
definitely be interesting to watch...i'd be more interested in a company that
builds single family homes than one that chiefly builds condos though, so that
might rule out WCI specifically

my favorite idea in the sector is still SPF, which had a solid report last

I believe JOE's current low estimate is around $1.40 for the year...

The future

I spoke with several lower level employees from Joe in Port St Joe yesterday,
after the earnings came out. All are in deep fear of their projects being shut
down, and/or delayed, and project teams being laid off in an effort to lower
overhead. The reason they gave are that the front end costs of bringing their
projects to market are extremely high, and both indicated that their start up
costs, thus far this year, were way above budget. Costs keep escalating, and
projected margins are paper thin, based on the retail prices that Joe believes
will start to attract buyers. Joe knows that their retail prices must come
down, but with development costs continuing to escalate out of control, they
cannot find a way to maintain margins.

Part of the reason for the start up costs escalating out of control, is that
each project has been in a constant state of turmoil, redesigning to try and
find a product that will appeal to the buyers, and help generate some sales.
Prefab homes are now openly being discussed, but the image issue cannot seem to
be overcome. Traffic is nonexistent, and buyers are not interested in the new
product, and are not absorbing the resale listings from previous buyers, now
flooding the market.

Each believes that a non hurricane event this year is critical to Joe regaining
its' momentum.

When I suggested that it was probably smart to delay projects, instead of
continuing to flood the market with more product, they said that upper
management considered that a sign of weakness, and would not consider that
option. This to me is hubris at its' worst, and may in the end doom PR's reign.

At least at the local level, this is a company deep in the initial stages of
shock, after the lack of earnings. All believe that Joe will post a loss in the
next qtr., and all believe that the board will have to react to quiet
investors.

One contact openly stated that Twomey might be in a position to reemerge, since
his coup attempt was based on the assumption that this sequence of events was
inevitable.

All in all I came away with the thought that there is probably no short term
fix for Joe's problems. In time, Joe will reestablish itself as a premier
company tapping into the growth of the panhandle. It may have to scale back on
the number of projects, and certainly reduce overhead, and in the long term
that may be a positive. Unfortunately, the street will not be patient, and in
my opinion, Joe's stock price will continue to decline for many qtr's to come.

OT: Plantronics (PLT): Oops. Looks like I should have got out while the getting
was good. Seems like '06 is going to be one of those "transition" years. I'll
just up my most tiny - and now losing - position in this thing by a tad more
shares. I still like the p/sales and profit margin metrics.

One thing you have to keep in mind is how much land in FL that JOE <u>owns</u>.
It's a very valuable asset that needs to be taken into consideration when
valuing the stock. Having said that, I do think the current price of JOE is too
high.

this is the kind of thing i was referring to pertaining to yahoo boards and
posts with agendas rather than useful information

all you have to do is listen to the conference call to know that this statement
is entirely false...management clearly stated that they will forego sales in
the short run to maximize their assets in the long run...they said that at
several properties where they are just beginning sales, they won't start
construction until they have 50% of the projects sold

not only do they not see it as a sign of weakness, they flat out state that
they will do so rather than sell off assets at less than what they think they
are worth, just to put up sales and earnings for a particular quarter

there are times that speaking to the employees of a company can provide great
insight into the company's prospects, but in this case, assuming that the
account of the discussion is even accurate, which is a bit of a stretch to
begin with, given the poster's obvious agenda, talking to employees in "deep
fear" is like asking a novice investor full of fear for advice on your stock
portfolio...not exactly the best source of information

time will tell what JOE the stock does, and it's safe to assume it won't depend
on the nonsense the shorts (or the longs) post on yahoo <g>

I've found that listening to management(who more times than not are basically
interested in lining there own pockets at the expense of shareholders) and
"analysts"(who are shills for the brokers/banks that lend to the corps) can be
much worse than talking to the employees, who are their on the front lines.
Management for JOE said they will make $1.40 this year after just posting
5&#162; for the quarter where most of the sales normally happen in Florida.
Credible?

That said, 99% of info on the yahoo boards is ludicrous. -g-

from what i heard, the management of JOE believes they can do $1.40 or better
for the year, but they also said they might have to revise that up or down
depending on how sales go this year, and since the selling season is just
starting in florida, i don't think you can draw much from the Q1 results...they
also stated that whereas they previously expected their 2006 earnings to come
55% and 45% from resort and non-resort projects respectively, they now expect
it to be more like 35% and 65%, so where resort sales clearly hurt Q1, they can
make their $1.40 for the year without resort sales contributing a whole lot

however, whether or not they achieve the $1.40 for the year, the credibility of
management lies in whether they execute their long term plan against the
various backdrops that they will face over many years and cycles, rather than
whether they meet one particular estimate

the point was that the yahoo post was totally bogus, and as you said, reflects
the typical garbage found on those boards

JOE isn't the kind of stock i would buy, but anyone who is a long term investor
in a company like that most likely owns it for their land value and future
prospects, rather than their current earnings, as the P/E and PEG don't justify
the current share price...as such, i would think said investors would ignore
quarter to quarter earnings variations, and focus on the long term prospects
for florida real estate, which appear very solid IMHO...i wouldn't begin to
pretend to know what the chances are that they will make the $1.40 number, or
where the stock will be in six months

Oops got scorched- on my position in SIL. I guess the market knew about the
nationalization of the gas industry before the companies did. Perhaps I learn
to sell on the big price drops on no news one of these days. The company is
humongously undervalued at these levels. but that assumes that the mine does
get built and that the governement doesnt take it over. Its hard to have any
confidence in the regime at this point so I have reduced by position
significantly , walking away with my tail between my legs. I continue to hold
the leaps though, as its always possible that someone will explain to the
current adminisiration that uncertainty is bad for business investment and some
formal understanding can be reached.

Rebought PIR at today's drop. Also bought some GCI recently. Sold the remainder
of APCC from years back - their ROE is now consistently low and does not fit my
approach.

Surprisingly, LBY is running up a lot. Well, I missed that one. :)

FDP roundtripped, so shoulda sold this one... :)

Can you tell me what you like about PIR? I see its book value isn't bad, and it
has cash, but the negative return on assets and equity, and the negative profit
margin and operating margin are worrying. What makes you think PIr can turn
around? Or are you figuring it will bounce before it dies?

the Chilean ecopnomy is doing well and employment is rising, which is great for
PVD.Earnings last quarter were 1.16$/ADR. This was influenced by extraordinary
items (Exchange rates) but still... If anybody knows a cheap asset manager
please speak up! I bought some more shares yesterday.

Eleutheria,

I pretty much gave up trying to think whether any company can turn around
couple years ago. :) Especially in retail. My strategy now is to buy high ROE
companies that stumble (and PIR has definitely stumbled) for really cheap.
Assumption is that they had smart management to earn high ROE and that
management can find a way out. If they don't find a way out in 5 years, I sell.

PIR is one of the "weak" holdings for me. Compared to other Buffettology
companies I buy, it has less appeal, less moat and possibly less chance of
turnaround. Because of that I also have strict upside limit at which I sell. I
bought it for ~$9.30 last time, sold at ~$12 and rebought now at $9.22.

If you still want to know the most likely future for PIR, I think that it will
be sold. How much of benefit this will be to shareholders, we'll have to see.

My strategy does not work every time. I still hold NTZ (BTW, in an area related
to PIR). :( The time is pretty much running out for it and so far I am around
break even.
