Hi Paul -

My Coal holdings are just another component to my energy assets. I also own
CNX, PVR and BKH all own in-the-ground coal assets. With many of the countries
backing off of nuclear, coal (especially met coal) is needed. With scrubbers
and post processing, the SO2 pollution can be managed. It's definitely not a
long term solution so I have been buying companies that have commitments to
other longer term energy developments (typically NG).

No interest in PUDA because of the Chinese tie. CNX w/ their recent purchase of
Dominion Resources NG assets is my favorite long term hold. I see fair value at
$65.00/share - $70.00/share.

I own BHP & Vale, both have some coal interests but now w/ my CNX and PVR/PVA
adds I feel I have enough "coal" exposure. I tend to stay away from 100% coal
plays as I see it as a dying business.

P.S. VOG recently cited Brigham Exploration Co. (BEXP)(

Paul,

The news today on for profit ed is that the final version of regulation has
been softened. This is consistent with your opinion in the previous post. (to
quote: "I suspect government policies won't put these for-profit ed. companies
out of business")

I am wondering if you would like to share how you arrived that guess or

Well I'm a "post-selector" who ended up buying in the sector, but I don't
necessarily disprove your thesis. The stocks in the MF screen at the time were
COCO and APOL (I'm pretty sure there weren't any others). Looking at the screen
brought me to the (duh!) realization that this entire sector had been hit
pretty hard and it was worth investigating. I looked at a few stocks and
decided to buy STRA and DV. To date, the former has underperformed the MF
stocks significantly and the latter has outperformed significantly.

BTW, I do invest a portion of my portfolio in MF, but if there are stocks in
the screen that belong to a sector where I think I can add value (especially if
I think they're worthy long term investments) I leave them out of my MF
portfolio and do my own research. So far the jury is out as to whether it would
have been better to just add COCO or APOL to my MF portfolio and move on.

Calvin -

To add to what Paul said, if a business is properly run and is performing a
service for which there is a legitimate need, changes to government regulation
may hurt it but they won't kill it. Once the rules are set, whatever they are,
the businesses will find a way to live with them. The key question is what the
impact will be on the value of the company and what price would count as cheap.
But, absent fraud or incompetence, you can assume that the company will
continue as a going concern.

I've seen this play out many times in many arenas. Regulatory issues are just
like any other short term business issue such as a soft economy, changes in
fashion, etc. My view as a long term investor is that if the business is sound
(and those are the only types of businesses a long term investor should be
looking at) it will survive any of these road bumps. The only question is to
decide whether the temporary uncertainty is presenting me with an attractive
price. To paraphrase Warren Buffett, that decision is simple but it isn't easy.

This part is not so clear in case of for-profit education.

changes to government regulation may hurt it but they won't kill it.

Personally, I believe that supplying taxpayers money for an overpriced subpar
product is not the way to use it. Supplying taxpayers money for poor people to
dig themselves into a hole is possibly also not the best use of it. IMHO,
straight subsidies for state/local colleges would be much more productive.

re AIG - interesting article about AIG (and others) about SEC footnotes. One
may not consider this relevant but my take is that those "aspirational"
earnings that AIG is raving about in their earnings reports are a real warning
sign. Insurance is a number business and it is of uttermost importance that
management understands what it is doing. the fact that AIG uses "aspirational
in conjunction with earnings implies to me that this is "management by
principle hope"

The huge yield on BDCL is tempting, but I am not positive on a double leveraged
BDC etf. BDCs are volatile enough as it is and with double leveraged etfs,
volatility is not your friend.

Leveraged etfs buy high and sell low in order to properly maintain their
leverage, so over time they tend to only work out if something goes straight in
your direction (or your holding period is so short that the buy high/sell low
factor doesn't have time to kick in).

Maybe the dividend will help. It gives you some positive carry. The other
leveraged etfs didn't yield much to my knowledge. I myself would still be
inclined to stay away.

Best of luck,

Hi Celtictrader -

The positive w/ your buy today on VOG (technically) is that today's volume is
very low and at a lower low. Many of the small E&P companies are Bearish
according to the Schwab Street Smart Edge "Recognia" Smart Chart tool (What
ever that is supposed to mean).

They did rank SSN as one of their top 10 Bullish patterns. I see that SSN
continues to show green today.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I was going to buy more GST yesterday but was not impressed w/ their operations
report released earlier this week. The company reported a non-economical well
that seems to have been expected but still was not good news. The stock fell to
$3.01/share but since the company's presentation Tuesday is up over 20%. They
also announced a $200M preferred which probably helps support the floor on the
common. This will be their only debt issue to date so the company has plenty of
cash to drill new wells.

I decided to go with VOG as they have plenty of cash (from an earlier stock
offering at a higher price) are still on schedule with their drilling program
and have some very promising acreage located in the Williston Basin Bakken and
Three Forks/Sanish areas. Earlier this year (February 2011) Brigham Exploration
Company (NasdaqGS: BEXP ) completed a very successful well on acreage very near
VOG's unexplored parcels (drilling is scheduled on VOG's parcels next year I
believe).

In fact BEXP has upped their investment and drilling program in this area by
$135M (as of May 16 2011) and are accelerating their drilling program to 12
active rigs! http://ir.bexp3d.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=577517

Therefore, the value proposition for VOG is quite compelling for me based on
the 27,000 net acres they control in the Williston Basin Bakken area.
Apparently the Market sees things a bit different.

I am a value guy throughout - no Porsche for me. if I were to go for a Porsche,
I'd probably buy a used one. Every once in a while, you get them offered pretty
cheap, like in a recession. I do remember that I could have bought one a few
years old in 2002 or so for about 25k$ with very little mileage. This was from
an ex- dot com millionaire who could not do his payments on various stuff he
acquired. I didn't buy it, too short on cash since I just had bought my house.

I imagine there were some great opportunities to buy luxury items in 2009 or
so. no used car prices and probably even Porsche's are sky high.

We get our Kitchen done for a value price - about 10k including labor. the
contractor is a guy who advertises on craigslist only and used to do mostly
electrical work. We used him before for our bathroom renovation last year. We
got our cabinets from an Chinese hardware store in Oakland. The material is of
OK (but not great quality) but I get them for Ikea like prices with better (imo
quality). Countertop from the same store, we got quartz (overage material)
Stove from LG from Homedepot(pricematched with Bestbuy), Dishwasher the same.
We got a Chinese stove fan that is strong enough to levitate pancakes <g>.

Lot's of this stuff is actually cheaper than 10 years ago when I bought the
house.

I went to a few car dealers over Memorial day weekend and was very impressed by
the Hyundai's (Elantra and Sonata). These models are actually selling above
MSRP now. Toyota did not have much on their lot's (at least not the popular
Hybrid models) and the rest of the lineup looks like it has come to market 5
years ago. Basically Toyota has nothing to sell nowadays, even if they could
make it <g>. The new Honda Civic looks great and has good mileage, but is very
expensive (probably worth it). My sense is that Hyundai will continue win
enormous market shares in the US.

Re: Covidien plc (COV)

After a quick review, I will continue to hold my 50% position in COV. Their
forward PE is still quite attractive at 12.78 according to Yahoo. 22 analysts
follow the stock and the consensus earnings for 2012 is $4.23/share. Other
medical device makers demand at least a 15 PE which would price the stock at
$63.45 fair value. Based on the current price of $53.70/share there is a
potential 19% upside gain.

This position is also a somewhat defensive hold since one pretty much has to
have their medical device(s) when prescribed.

My initial buy was on 11/01/2010 at $39.34/share. Sold 50% on 2/1/2011 at
$49.50/share.

Yes ADM is on my watch list but they have too much exposure in Fructose (corn
syrup) production (especially in the US). Maybe they can get China hooked on
that stuff which would significantly add to their bottom line. I believe their
new West coast port facility was built to handle grain exports (not necessarily
processed corn products).

You need to look at the management at ADM again as they have recently had a
complete turnover in top management w/i the last six months. This could be a
good thing.

Listen to the ADM presentation as it provides a good current state-of-affairs
at the company.

Audio webcast of the company's presentation at this year's BMO Capital Markets
Farm to Market Conference held in New York.

http://audability.com/AudabilityAdmin/Clients/BMO/101066_517201180000AM/registr
tionform.aspx?Event_ID=1066

Value wise, ADM is in value territory (w/ a PE around 9) so I have a GTC order
in for a tracking position at $25.45/share. My add to my BG order is in low too
at $66.60/share. I think AGU is the best company of the group but it is still
priced too high and I am looking for an entry around $70.00/share. Their 2012
earnings estimate by 21 analysts is $7.84/share.

A 9 PE represents a pretty good value price entry point for any of these larger
players. ADM is now selling right around this number so perhaps with their
recent management shuffle it may provide a low risk entry point. I still think
it will take several quarters for the company to implement their new growth
strategy. The other companies seem to have it working now.

If the market turns sour, many of these global AG conglomerates should be well
positioned to make money in a stagflation (and/or inflationary) environment.

8:02AM CoreSite and Interxion (INXN) announce transatlantic cloud computing

from cloud companies looking for data center space in the U.S. and Europe as
well as cloud customers of both companies looking to expand internationally.
The transatlantic cloud data center alliance reduces the risks and challenges

The Ag play is a multi year value play IMO. Forward PE's are still quite

Re: Bunge Limited (BG)
Agrium Inc. (AGU)

My favorite is BG. They have the best global assets IMO of the group with
exposure in Brazil, Far East, Europe and the Americas. Their LT debt profile is
one of the best of the group where Net Income to LT Debt coverage is .53 (it
takes only 1.88 years of Net Income to pay off their LT Debt). They are the
only one in the group that has a Joint Development Agreement with Solazyme
(SZYM). The companies are working together to develop microbe-derived oils
utilizing Brazilian sugar cane feedstock. When this process is completed and
put into production BG will have the most efficient bio-diesel & ethanol
production facility based on sugar cane feedstock in the world. BG has little
exposure to fertilizers as they sold that division last year and used the
proceeds to expand their sugar cane production in Brazil.

AGU is like a mini BG but w/ a fertilizer division (specifically w/ a network
of distributors located in Brazil & Argintina). ADM does not have as much
exposure to the milling and plant oil production as BG or AGU. ADM has high
exposure to the fructose (corn syrup) market (as much as 45% market share in
the U.S.) which I believe is an area for demand shrinkage due to the human
health impact(s) of this processed product. Processed corn products are still
important for feed for farm animals which is a huge growth market in the far
East (Japan & China).

All three companies have compelling forward PE's : ADM 8.7, BG 10.56, & AGU
10.49. However, their debt profiles are quite different. The LT debt to Net
Income coverage for ADM is 6.79 years vs 1.88 years for BG & 2.95 years for
AGU. Price/Book Value: BG 0.65, ADM 1.15 & ADU 2.44.

I am buying all three if I can pick them up at the right price. I am starting
from a zero position in this sector other than owning shares in DD which
operates a seed division and Noble Group Ltd. (NOBGF.PK) that is an AG
logistics company focused on moving products to China. Many of my natural
resource companies produce several of the fertilizers that are required inputs
to the food production. Other than that I have no "pure" play in this growing
industry.

I would like to build at least a 5% position in the portfolio covering the AG
sector.

PXL.V is cheap because their netback (cash flow/barrel) is low and actually
shrinking despite increases in. they made only 14$ netback (that is before DDA,
down from 21$+ last year). This is abysmal.

Basically they are producing more at a loss and make it up in volume.
Apparently all this fun is financed from issuing shares (sharecount up 50%

PXL.v. Yes, that should be considered in the valuation. They are heavy oil
producers, so the netback will be less. Heavy oil generally about 20-25% of
light oil price. Positives for PXL's heavy oil (vs. light oil co's) are: wells
can be longer lived, are not deep (therefore much cheaper), and their big field
area is derisked for heavy oil.

When I first did my calculation I dropped expected production 20% to try to
account for heavy oil price differential. That still makes PXL a buy. For me,
anyway.

Customer service is a known issue with Best Buy. I would avoid buying there. if
BBY price is really good, I try to pricematch with other companies. This is
what we did with our kitchen appliances - we had HD match the price. FWiW, HD

Extended warranties are a ripoff and BBY are some of the worst. Purchase
electronic goods with an Amex card, it doubles you warranty to up to 2 years
and actually works. My wife had a notebook fail after 13month (purchased at
Staples). We contacted Amex, they had us submit and estimate (from Staples for
repair) and we received the funds from Amex 3 weeks later. It really works.

I also agree that BBY is Amazon's showroom.

OT - Local Costco news up here in Toronto. I shop at this store all the time.
Great store, but the lines at the gas
bar are huge. Have owned the stock since 09.

Costco loses bid to expand Scarborough gas bar

Costco won’t be allowed to add four more pumps to its wildly popular gas bar
near Warden and Ellesmere Aves.

The proposal, which required a variance in a zoning bylaw, got the thumbs down
Tuesday from the city’s Scarborough panel of the committee of adjustment.

Costco had wanted to add an extra island and expand the number of pumps to 16
from 12 at the gas bar, which opened last fall and created chronic lineups of
drivers on local streets, raising neighbours’ hackles. Some drivers come from
as far away as Whitby to get discounts of up to 10 cents a litre; they must be
Costco members in order to enjoy the savings.

The committee of adjustment did, however, approve two other bylaw variances
sought by Costco that will provide more space for lineups around its gas bar —
on company property, rather than local roadways.

After the hearing, Costco spokesman Mark Marchisano said the company would be
looking closely at the decision not to add more pumps before deciding whether
or not it would appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board.

Marchisano, along with Costco lawyer David Bronskill, pointed out to members of
the committee that City of Toronto staff supported their request for a
variance. They also argued that allowing another island would increase the
processing capacity of the gas bar and help reduce the lineups and wait times.

But local councillor Michael Thompson (Ward 37, Scarborough Centre), who also
spoke at the Tuesday hearing, pointed out that city staff had also approved the
original application in 2009 to build three gas islands and 12 pumps and had
stated then that the increase in traffic would be minimal, with little effect
on the neighbourhood.

“We know now that that is not true,” Thompson said. Instead, the councillor
said that he and a number of residents who live near the gas bar attended the
hearing because “of a major problem that Costco has created in the community.”

Pollution, noise from honking horns, and long lines of idling cars choking
nearby streets have created distress and aggravation, the committee heard.

“I’ve now become a hostage in my own neighbourhood,” said George Athanasoulis,
who lives just south of Costco’s property and finds it hard to get around the
neighbourhood and take his kids to soccer games because of the congestion
caused by the gas bar.

“Canadian Rd. wasn’t built for Costco,” said Athanasoulis, in reference to one
of the roads where drivers line up to get into the gas bar.

There’s no evidence that adding another four gas pumps would resolve existing
traffic problems, Thompson said.

“It should never have gone there in the first place,” Paul Judson, who lives on
nearby Ellington Dr., told the committee.

Thompson said he was in favour of the other two bylaw variances sought by
Costco. They reduce the minimum parking requirements and add 18 parking spaces
to the front yard of the site.

AHL - What happened in 2004/2005, large acquisition?
http://www.gurufocus.com/financials.php?symbol=ahl

In any case, their book value grew 11% per year and book value per share grew
10% per year from 2003. Which is on par with other insurance companies that we
looked at, definitely not outstanding (there are companies that did better).

Losses in Q1/2011 as with others.

Overall, it seems like yet another insurance company not much different in
valuation or business acumen from others. But then I have not read their annual
yet. I am sure they claim there that they have more conservative policy
writing, better diversification, astounding long term strategy and proprietary
risk evaluation that leaves all other companies in the dust. Don't they all...

AHL: I'll pass on it. It's a little to tough for me.

Book value has dropped because of natural catastrophes. An unusual year for
catastrophes. Maybe.

I'm holding NWLA, an insurer routinely selling far below stated bv, although
its bv keeps increasing. Not the stock price though. So in a sense, a value
trap (for me). Often when I consider making an insurance stock purchase, it
comes to mind. I don't want to take on what could be another value trap: AHL
already under stated bv for a few years now. Although in AHL defense, many
insurers are like that-- 2008 to current have not been good years for many.

Don't have current info.; I see that Greenlight has a position in AHL. That's a

If you have in mind NWLI (there is no NWLA ticker), its book and book-per-share

NWLI is a life insurer, so they did not suffer the losses that all cat/re
insurers suffered in Q1.

No positions in either. I think both are OKish as a part of basket if insurers
will ever get back in favor.

Of course, neither company is on the top of insurers book or book-per-share

67% gain from 12/2002 is 7% annual rate compounded. Still, if the book value
rose 9%, the stock is either more undervalued than it was, or the future is
worse than it was in 2002.

On one hand, your NWLI investment strongly outperformed S&P and you did not
have to think where to put money, it was a buy and hold decision. And a lot of
people consider that 7% is an expected rate on stock averages. On the other
hand, yes, perhaps 10-15% annual would be better... ;)

EDIT: Not sure if this chart link will work, but apparently NWLI and BRK-B
returned exactly the same from your buy in 12/2002:

The article using the <u>Discounted Earnings Plus Equity Model </u>calculates
Intel's fair value @ $34.30/share.

That's 61% under the author's Fair Value estimate.

I own shares from 2/2006 purchased @ $20.61, 4/2008 @ $21.21 and 9/2009 @
$19.54.

If one is looking at starting a position, today's drop provides a pretty good

I guess I should setup a mental limit of what part of my portfolio I want to
invest into insurance companies and then buy a basket up to it.

Just to (re)summarize pros and cons covered by a bunch of posts:

Pros:
- Float is great, free float is super great
- Good investment of float can yield good-to-great returns
- Long term book, book-per-share growth of some insurance companies is adequate
to great
- Valuations are low
- Cats should pass
- Conservative policy writing is great

Cons:
- Low bond yields may equal low return on float
- Moving to risky investments to catch yield was and is risky
- Too many players, too low policy prices - too much money sloshing around
- Everyone talks conservative underwriting, few practice it
- So-so long term growth may yield continued low valuations
- Perhaps weather patterns are changing and cats are becoming more common. Non
cat insurers may have their own issues.

Unfortunately, there is no free lunch - almost - and the companies that don't
have cat losses (NWLI), or have high growth (AFSI, HCC), or have good/great
float allocators (BRK, FRFHF) trade at premium to run-of-the-mill, OKish,
generic (??) companies. As we saw from the NWLI/BRK chart, it's not clear that
buying more expensive and "better" companies outperforms cheaper OK'ish
companies. So I would not dare to choose clear leaders in the current crop.

Disclosure: I still hold BRK, AXS, AFSI, FRFHF, TRH, FSR, L, CI. I added very
little if at all recently.

Jurgis - I think you are correct about setting a limit on cat exposure. They
all insure the same stuff (basically and with small variants) so they all get
his at the same time. I believe that life insurers are different, since their
main risk is with credit markets (due to long tail risk).

I own TRH,DL.AS,AHL, RGA,ASI. I am probably done buying and would buy some
BrK.b if it goes lower.

I have looked at NWLI and while the value is there (trading at 1/2 tangible
book), I do think that this is a real trap due to: - no stock buyback
- no dividend
- (high) single digit ROA
- majority shareholder running the company their way, with little hope for
change

I want insurance company that trade below tangible book to buy back shares. It
is basically a risk free return to buy back a Dollar for 80c or less, unless
this results in a decreased AM best or credit rating, which may impact their
viability..

Hi Jurgis -

You are correct the author might be a little optimistic in his estimates.

I believe that the simple DCF valuation model is flawed and generally will not
work well in the current economic environment. That is because we will have
unusually wild swings in both the actual and perceived interest rate(s) due to
the Fed's aggressive monetary policies (especially w/ QE2 ) and the
unprecedented large U.S. debt and looming financial crises.

The "discount rate" which is typically pegged at the ten year treasury rate is
usually used in these present value calculations. Today it is historically low
around 3%. (When in history do you recall the Feds Funds rate at zero.). I
think Warren Buffet uses a historical rate of 6% and anything lower than that
he is generally bullish on the economy. Therefore, with real rates so low,
everybody is generally very bullish for the future (unless "deflation"
expectations make them see differently).

General market psychology affects future stock prices which the discounted cash
flow analysis totally misses. Future expectations play a huge role is how
capital is deployed. As long as rates are no more than a 2% standard deviation
from the historical norm, everything is cool. The cost of capital is known and
generally fixed. Projects can be scheduled out five years or more with some
certainty.

However I see the next five years as one where it is not going to be normal.
Rates will be outside the historical norms BOTH very low & very high. It is
going to be a very difficult environment to operate in. Expectations (Inflation
& Deflation) are going to be all over the board. In fact, I bet that nominal
interest rates deviate outside the historical average. These wild swings will
cause BOTH PE expansion first and then PE contraction.

<img
src='http://tradersnarrative.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/inflation-compared-to-
e-ratios-historical-data2.png?w=640&h=355'>

PE expansion will occur first which will over value equities and then as we
approach the out liner threshold for inflation (w/ very high inflation
expectations) PE contraction will occur which will significantly under value
equities.

When you fall into these out liner regions, it present a roller coaster ride
for the long term investor. Nothing has fundamentally changed in the company's
valuation other than the actual and perceived "cost of capital" (due to
inflation/deflation expectations).

Management's expectations for inflation (and/or deflation) will impact their
decision on when and how much to expand and/or invest. This decision will
impact on the company's growth. So maybe the one most important investment
criteria for the successful company will be it's management and how well they
can temper their expectations.

Unfortunately, you can't really quantify what the cost of capital will be five
or more years out and how management will act (or react) just using a simple
DCF analysis.

It's going to be an interesting ride for all investors.

re CCJ - I would consider a price of 7x earnings as attractive. That is about
what Vale is going for. I am not sure that the prospects for uranium is better
than for Iron ore, so I think a comparable price/earnings ratio makes sense..
or maybe you base it on ERA.AX valuation, which is a peer company (more or
less). That would get you in a similar range.

My target price for BRK.B is in the 72.XX$ range - at least that is where my

It depends on what you call "simple DCF model". I never use the treasury rate
as discount in DCF. For me the discount rate is the rate that I want to get
from the investment. I don't care whether I have an alternative at that rate,
it's the lowest expected rate at which I would buy an investment. So for me
discount rate is almost always 15%.

IMHO the chart you show is much more spread out and ambiguous than you (and the
other author) try to present. IMHO, you guys are making way too strong
assumptions on what would happen in different inflation and deflation
scenarios. Future is likely to be quite unpredictable.

Now, you are right that interest rates may swing around in coming years. This
just provides opportunity for investors who don't care about short term
volatility.

Obviously if people don't have strong understanding of DCF and discount rate
role in it, they can use it in various ways to justify ridiculous pricing for
stocks - most on the time suggesting buying too high.

RGA is well managed, imo. ASI is OK and conservatively managed. They did at
some point a very dilutive (in terms of book value) secondary that angered
shareholders. They don't buy back stock, nor do they pay a dividend.

I believe the reason for this lack of capital return is that they are small and
want to gain scale and for that they need more capital.

i dont know what the actual numbers are but I am willing to make a small wager
that intel's earnings in year 5 will be less than projected by this model. i
would also point out that most of the value seems to be in the disposal value
of $20+ dollars which assumes that the growth of the previous 5 years somehow
continues. or at least so it appears to me. now my guess is that that this
model doesnt take into account that the desktop pc model is probably in decline
and likely to experience sales declines in coming years, the growth areas
appear to be in mobile and tablets where intel is weak. I dont think the intel
of the present is the intel of the past. On top of that someone here made a
very astute analysis in the past of how with tech companies you cant believe
the earnings because of the impact of stock options. this model completely
ignores that issue.

Madharry - the GAAP earnings have provisions in place to account for stock
options. The problem is that many analysts ignore them (and other expenses) and
work with "operating earnings". I do not think that with companies like
MSFT,CSCO or INTC, the stock options are the main problem, the dilution due to
stock options went down significantly during the last 10 years as these
companies matured. I believe that MSFT even uses restricted stock mostly, which
is fully expensed.

The bigger issue is that the FCF numbers for tech companies are misleading
because most of these larger companies don't grow organically (the underlying
assumption for most FCF models since they don't subtract the cash spent for
acquisitions) and spent very high premiums to buy small growth companies or
competitors. So, if you look at the forward growth rates, you need to take into
account that a tech company very likely will not just have to invest in
equipment (which is accounted for in FCF models) but also in intangibles (via
premiums paid in acquisitions) which typically are not. if you take intangibles
into account the FCF and ROA will become much less impressive.

The other problem with discounted cash flow models is as you pointed out the
residual value, which in most models is the largest chunk of the value. The
valuation becomes highly depended on the earnings assumption and multiple you
put on a stock for the residual value calculation.

Hi ClownBuck -

Of the three companies you mentioned, MSFT, CSCO and INTC isn't CSCO the worst
offender for using stock options as you explained? The last time I looked,
CSCO's use of stock options was still quite large. That is one of the reasons I
am hesitant on starting a position in CSCO.

What is meant by residual value? Is this the same thing as the BV of all assets
after adjusting for accumulated depreciation? Is this a meaningful value for
high tech companies or actually meaningless as it would be composed of
worthless legacy technology and/or patents and/or worthless goodwill (more so
in CSCO's case)?

I am not sure for CSCO or Microsoft but after R&D expenditures isn't one of the
largest use of capital for Intel spent on their manufacturing facilities? This
would include the construction of new Fab plants and/or the upgrading of their
old Fab facilities? I suspect the future cost of capital would impact Intel
more than MSFT and maybe to a lesser extent CSCO.

I own both MSFT and INTC and have been thinking about starting a tracking
position in CSCO. I think of the three I like INTC the best for their
consistent growth over the last 10 years. Their management also seems to have
made the fewest mistakes over this time period.

What's your "valuation" view on CSCO vs Intc? Analysts have both the forward
PE's at around 8.5. I think I would give the nod to Intel because of their
consistent management.

re INTC - they spent ~5B$ in capex every year, roughly equivalent to
depreciation - so they don't really need to add much to their fixed capital
base. 5B$ in capex is equivalent to ~25% of last year cash flow, which is not
extremely capital heavy.

With "residual value", I mean the discounted value of the company at the end of
the DCF time series. For example if you look out 10 years you estimate the
earnings (10 years out typically ) and put a multiple on this earnings, and
discount this value with the discount rate (8%) to NPV. the problem is which
earnings, what multiple and to a lesser extend what discount rate (should be
based on the risk level) you assume.

This is the largest component of the DCF (the NPV dividends from year 1-10 in
this example are typically a much smaller part of the total value.

Thank's for the explanation.

I think I will hold off on starting a tracking position on Cisco for now. It
seems like their margins are still under pressure.

I didn't realize the following:

<u>Cisco vs. Intel: 2 Fallen Stars of the Techno-bubble Show</u>
by: Dr. Osman Gulseven May 26, 2011

http://seekingalpha.com/article/272108-cisco-vs-intel-2-fallen-stars-of-the-tec
no-bubble-show

From the article:"... The ten year annualized return for Cisco has been -3%.
Intel shareholders experienced an annualized loss of 1%, even though Intel paid
significant dividends..."

Cisco's margins continue to fall while Intel seems to have increased them
building on their last generation chip technology. Maybe they can find their
way to similar margins as they gear up to produce their new low powered ARM
processors.

From the article:"...While Cisco's gross profit margins hover around 63%, the
net margins are thinner, and ttm <trailing twelve month> net profit margin
falls to 17.89%. Therefore, Cisco might never reach its glorious market cap of
$500 billion. On the other hand, Intel was able to increase its gross margin in
the last four years, from 51.9% in 2007, to 64.6%. In addition, net profit
margin increased from 18.20% in 2007, to 26.38%. I think Intel is on its way to
become a dividend-growth company....".

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess from a very simplistic "value" view, both companies have a forward PE
of 8.5 but one is experiencing decreasing product margins (ie CSCO) while the
other has increasing profit margins (ie Intel). According to the article,
Intel's net profit margins are 26.38% vs Cisco's 17.89%.

Intel also pays twice the dividend amount that yields 3.4% vs CSCO's 1.6%
yield.

FWIW I almost re-opened a position in INTC on Friday but held off after
assessing charts of about 100 or so companies that I track. It's been a long
time since so many charts looked so uniformly bad. Very few stocks want to go
up right now. This feels like a sell-the-strength type market to me and that's
what I plan to to do until some market leaders step up. Been holding alot of
cash for quite a while waiting on a good opportunity and I don't want to be
early.

Residual value - you make it out to be a DCF problem, but it actually is a
problem of most valuation models except for Graham net/nets.

Let's say you use P/E. If you buy P/E is >5, you are putting a chunk of value
into what company will earn after five years - very similar to residual value
in 5 year DCF. If you buy at 10 P/E, you are now at ~1/2 value after 5 years.
Sure, depending on how you define residual, DCF may have a bigger part of value
in residual, but if you are using simple P/E, you are not discounting the
future earnings at all, so you can't even clearly tell what's the residual in a
P/E metric. ;) On the other hand, if you run 10 year DCF, the residual will be
much smaller, but obviously you have to extrapolate for 10 years.

IMHO it's a bit disingenuous to fault DCF with residual issue when you have
never discussed it within other valuation models. ;)
