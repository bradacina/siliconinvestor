LXP stock has done essentially nothing in past three years. Hard for me to
outlook a rising stock price for this one.

...That just happens to be the kind of stock I could go for. -g-

I'm willing to take a continuing flat stock price and a 7% yield-with-a-bet
that the dividend will continue to rise.

Well, we've all got different goals and risk tolerances. With a stock like this
and a stock market that we SEEM to be in now, I ain't likely (if the market
remains up and strong) gonna get any bragging rights at the end of the year
with this stock or with my portfolio that contains similar stocks which are
slow movers - very slow - in comparison to others' portfolios with more
ambitious and aggressive goals and stocks.

Anyway, LXP might work for me; I'll consider this reit for a small buy.

BSX. Oh yes. Definitely a stretch.

Still, I'm going to try to hold on to my few BSX shares.

The p/sales, p/book are at multi-year lows.

Things are very bleak for the company. I'm hoping for a pony in the pile
though.

According to Yahoo, there are 28,000 employees at BSX and they are in several
areas, not just the stents: "The company offers its products in three groups:
Cardiovascular, Endosurgery, and Neuromodulation." (C'mon you new product
development guys! Give us a blockbuster!)

To me, the question isn't where the company is now, but where it will be in
three years. I don't know, but I am betting in a better position than now.

Not betting much though (-g-)

OurPet's Company Reports Record 2007 First-Quarter Financial Results
Monday April 30, 8:00 am ET

FAIRPORT HARBOR, OH--(MARKET WIRE)--Apr 30, 2007 --

-- First-Quarter Net Income up 107.7% on a 22.6% Increase in Quarterly
Sales
-- Management Optimistic About 2007

OurPet's Company (OTC BB:OPCO.OB - News): a growing designer, developer,
producer and marketer of accessory and consumable pet products, today reported
financial results for the 2007 first quarter ended March 31, 2007.

Net revenues for the 2007 first quarter increased 22.6 percent to $2,583,370
from $2,107,441 in the same period a year ago. Gross margin, as a percent of
sales for the 2007 first quarter, was 26.6 percent compared to 26.5 percent in
the 2006 first quarter. Net income for the 2007 first quarter increased 107.7
percent to $115,513 compared to $55,619 for the 2006 first quarter. Earnings,
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), for the 2007
first quarter, increased 51.0 percent to $269,101, compared to $178,213 for the
2006 first quarter.

Dr. Steven Tsengas, President and CEO, stated, "We are very pleased with how
the year has started out. March was our second month of over $1,000,000 in
gross revenues in the last five months. The 22.6 percent quarterly sales
increase was primarily a result of our existing products, which demonstrates
the strength of our brands. We expect to begin shipping our recently introduced
new brands of innovative products at the beginning of the third quarter, and
anticipate these new products will begin to positively impact our financial
results as early as the 2007 fourth quarter.

"While we are happy with our 22.6 percent increase in sales, we are ecstatic
about our 107.7 percent increase in net income. Our net margin increased 1.9
percentage points to 4.5 percent from 2.6 percent in the 2006 first quarter.
This demonstrates our ability to drive profitable sales and we expect income to
continue to increase at a much faster percentage rate than sales."

Dr. Steve concluded, "During the quarter, we strengthened our Board of
Directors with the appointment of Dr. Fraser, DVM, we introduced three new
brands, signed a 20 year renewable product agreement with our strategic
supplier in India, and successfully completed the expansion of our warehouse at
our headquarters. We continue to sign on new customers, as we are consistently
recognized by the pet industry for our high-quality, innovative pet products,
exceptional customer service and on-time delivery. We are excited about our
future and expect the seasonally strong second half of the year to show very
favorable comparables over the same period last year."

I still own my stock in RAS. I believe the comments by AHM have helped the CDO
residential perceptions.

While I am disappointed by our company's results, our company will always be
susceptible to significant disruptions in the secondary mortgage market," he
said. However, "it does appear that the secondary market is stabilizing. During
April, more loan buyers have been bidding to buy our loan pools. Additionally,
spreads on some junior mortgage securities have retraced a portion of the sharp
widening that occurred in March; junior mortgage securities are trading in a
more orderly fashion."

Since you listened to the CC, RAS appears to be doing well in their lines of
business, especially in Europe.

where NOI was temporarily low due various issues. I listened to the conf call
and it was reassured. The company has good deal flow, is selective, and has a
lot of expansion projects in the works.

I bought more with. 8.1% yield + dividend growth.

http://www.americancapital.com/news/newsreleases/2007/pr20070501.html

American Capital is forecasting total 2007 dividends of $3.68 per share to be
paid from ordinary taxable income earned in 2007. This would represent an 11%
growth over the total 2006 dividends of $3.33 per share.

I'll reenter regional bank NAL with a few share buy.

A bank analyst recommendation on Bloomberg yesterday prompted me to review it
again: Decent franchise and they are apparently coming up to the three-year
public trading time, which, if I understand right, means because of tax
consequences, they could become a more attractive buyout candidate.

These bank mutuals that have gone public - the ones I've followed anyway - seem
to be dull companies whose stocks are slow movers. And their dividends aren't
that attractive either.

I've been looking at LIZ vs. JNY. I forgot about TLB.

I'm in doubt mode. LIZ and JNY have some great brands. As you say though,
difficult to discern the turnaround.

Right now my market research team (female family members -g-) like
Juicy brand (which is buried within LIZ). I might go with a few, a very few LIZ
with the intent to scale in as stock drops. JNY has been a Warren
Buffett/surrogate pick in past. So it should be considered.

TLB a buy @ under $20, I'd say. Or maybe even under @21. I'll watch it.
Relatively (to itself) low p/sales. ...hmmm... that one could be tempting.

Building on those buy considerations, maybe it's time to also consider reducing
positions in some of the others that are in niches and have higher prices,
multiples. I have ANF, AEO, ARO, others. Got tired of waiting for completion of
the cashout offer for CLE and sold position couple days ago.

Because C is up and BAC is down. The stocks are more similar business wise than
they are different. I do not see a reason why C is up more than 10% while BAC
is up a mere 2 %. I am betting that those stocks will converge.

FWIW I still kept my C in my taxable accounts. I would not sell below 60$ in
those.

BAC has been held down by concerns that they will make an acquisition...first
it was rumored they would buy BCS, now they are trying to buy lasalle from abn
amro...note how the stock spiked intraday today when the dutch court ruled
against them re lasalle, though that's clearly not the end of the story

of course they always successfully integrate the acquisitions, but the market
gets nervous anyway

%BOM---------------------
Date:5/4/2007 1:52:53 AM
From:Spekulatius
Regarding BAC - yes I am aware of the acquisition issue but the Lasalle
acquisition would be comparatively small, not much larger than the recent
acquisitions C has in the works.

C recently got a boost when they showed better than expected revenue growth
numbers. I think one of the underlying reasons for BAC relative
underperformance may be a fear that they somehow still get caught in the
subprime mortgage mess. I think the chances are quite small, and C's mortgage
portfolio (even though it's much smaller than BAC) does look worse than BAC
from a quality perspective.

Anyways, the market thinks one way, and I think the other. Given the choice
between C and BAC, I am buying BAC right now but I really like them both.
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:5/4/2007 2:13:08 AM
From:Carl Worth
BAC's underperformance started when the rumors started about them acquiring
BCS, and while they didn't have the upside surprise that C did with respect to
revenues, they have a lower p/e and an essentially equal PEG, so the
fundamentals favor BAC with its lower p/e

it's true that the subprime fears have affected financials, but that has been
across the board, regardless of exposure, as most people don't really know what
any of these financial companies' exposure is to mortgages, CDO's, mortgage
insurance, other securitizations and bonds, fees and commissions on same, gain
on sale profits, etc

even though the current proposed acquisition is "only" 21B or so for lasalle,
BAC is seen as being back on the acquisition trail, and investors don't like
that uncertainty

if BAC came out tomorrow and said we have decided we will absolutely do zero
acquisitions in the next two years, the stock would jump 2 points in a
day...again, the evidence is right there in the intraday chart, where just a
court decision immediately caused an upward spike in the stock price, even
though the company itself would consider the court decision a setback, not a
victory

Ternium got IMSA for more than they would have probably liked to pay, but the
combo is wonderful.

Short of a world wide recession that tanks everything, TX is a good investment,

Thanks for sharing. You never know how any of these things are gonna react to a
miss. HP missed estimates the other day, but aside from a one day intraday
whack, it really didn't do much harm to the stock, even with oil backing off
this week, and softness in the land drilling area noted. I'm thinking the
higher quality like TS holds up, even if it should take a short scary dive.
Maybe wishful thinking.

Fwiw, anializer, I started buying TS when fp scientist recommended it. Although
he's out now, I've no intention of selling my position.

A drop in the share price won't do it for me. I'm in for much lower prices than
currently and for shares as part of a diversified portfolio. So it's maybe
easier for me to hold on than others or otherwise.

In this sector, I've lost MVK, LSS, and NSS to takeovers. So I'll be wanting to
hold TS, OIS, and if I knew of others, I'd be looking to buy rhem if prices
were reasonable.

(As for TX, I'm one who's exited that because of Chavez takeover rumblings.)

On conf call, co sounds fairly bearish on the OCTG tubular market. Co says it
expects a marked slowdown in Canada gas drilling due to lower gas prices. Co
says imports are having an impact. Co has seen a "sharp drop in demand" for
OCTG products in Canada. The US market has not been affected as much as Canada,

Asset manager LM.

I had been averaging up on the position. Last previous purchase at 109.88 in
Jan. Stock dropped and I've held.

Re-evaluating the company now, I see I've goofed and was too focused on buying
only on scale up and not focused enough on the value of the company: should
have added yet more Mar-Apr when stock fell to the 94 level.

The company - imo - is very undervalued based on my criterion for asset
managers, namely assets-under-management to company market cap. Not just me,
this metric seems to be the standard one employed by analysts in the sector.
(With some allowance for stocks vs. fixed income management and maybe (??)
market cap of the asset manager.)

Given my use of this metric on LM again now, and being surprised by the large
undervaluation I am seeing for LM, I'll up my position a little more
aggressively.

Adding today @105+, and I expect I'll continue to add.

SPF seems pretty reasonable here

i calculate the tangible book value to be $25.08 as of the end of Q1, so that's
almost a 5 dollar buffer down to the current price

certainly i would expect them to lose money for 2007, but even if they lost a
couple bucks a share this year and next, the book value would still be about
what the current share price is, and meanwhile the housing market will
eventually turn positive again

i don't own any homebuilders right now, but the two that look most interesting
to me are TOL, for its luxury niche, and MHO, for its book value...each of
these builders are still turning at least some profit so far, pending TOL's
earnings update tomorrow <g>

in its last report, MHO said that orders in Q107 were higher than Q306 and Q406

I'll up my losing position in RSO, "a real estate investment trust whose
investment strategy focuses on commercial real estate loan assets and, to a
lesser extent, higher-yielding commercial finance assets".

Div. yield currently 9.75%. Again, in latest quarterly released last night, "We
continue to anticipate moving the dividend up substantially over the next three
quarters as we invest the capital raised in the December 2006 offering."

Still, a very scary company imo. Book value decreased apparently because of a
mark-to-market of some investment(s). The company's business - loan
amortizations, collateralized loan obligations, and business structure (they
are externally managed by another company) are difficult/impossible to
comprehend clearly enough by an outsider (me) to really understand
risks/ramifications of owning shares here. OTOH, at current price one is buying
shares below what some insiders have paid. I note also that Leon Cooperman has
a position. That's a positive.

"did not hold on to some". Madharry, keep a stub!

Whatever stock you keep as a stub, you've already done the research on it
because the info. you gleaned led you to the original buy.

You can follow the stock or not follow it. It won't cause you any trouble just
sitting there in your portfolio. Does get excruciating boring though -g-.

Example:
KNDL goes up a couple of points, ain't going to make my financial life any
better. Practically perhaps, it is not worth holding the stock. I scarcely
follow the company/business now.

Canroy Peyto has also had a nice move recently.

I read the presentation. They claim to show their payout is more sustainable
than competitors'. OTOH, though, that yield is (after tax witholding and adjust
for Canadian dollar) "only" about 6.9% currently.

"Peyto believes that the foundation for sustainable distributions comes from
long life, high quality reserves combined with a business of profitably finding
and developing new reserves. Our business remains committed to this strategy
and our asset base continues to lead the industry in reserve life and operating
costs."

I'll take a few shares now of PEYUF to track. A little late to be buying now
perhaps, because the stock already has made a decent move since March and has
recovered from the Nov tax change debacle affecting Canroys. Nevertheless, if
the dividend is well-protected vis-a-vis other Canroys, and IF Peyto can/will
increase it over time while others' might be declining, that is a positive for
future Peyto stock appreciation. (Maybe and IF)

I like the combination of real estate, internet gambling, and unique assets. It

the company will have to show investors that they are serious about turning
