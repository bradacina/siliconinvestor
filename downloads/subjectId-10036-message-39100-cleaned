EKS. We amateurs really only do part of what the pro analysts do when they
evaluate these companies.

Which is, I believe:

They try to id a shale play or company early on.

They use their knowledge of geology and technical aspects of extracting oil
from those formations in order to assess the technical risk.

They use their knowledge of petroleum accounting to study the the financial
statements of the company--- well-by-well if such info. is available.

Doesn't mean amateur analysts can't do okay though.
=============================
I'm not detailed enough or astute enough though to seek out and catch the
hidden assets that you find that others overlook. I am trying to find the next
good oil shale plays that might make the fortunes of small e&p companies
though. The Bakken, which I like and am in with several stocks, seems fairly
well known now. I use Big Dog's Boom Boom thread as an indicator: If there's
lots of discussion on a subject there, it's my signal that being an early
entrant to the stock or shale isn't likely for me. One shale area that hasn't
garnered much if any interest around here that I like and posted on is Eagle
Ford for horizontal drilling possibilities. So I'm one who's buying stock in
some companies interested in developing their land holdings there.

re SU, EME.TO- EME.TO interesting heavy oil play. Their production is rising
fast (their sharecount too) and they seem to get some economics of scale, which
is what I look for in these sort or plays. So far they are still making losses.
it seems to me that those heavy crude companies should be valued more in terms
of earnings and flowing production to some extent rather than the amount of
reserves.

As for Canadian heavy oil companies, there is a very good article (those are
rare and worth mentioning) in Seeking alpha About SU (Suncor).Much of the logic
applies to other heavy oil/ oil sands player too, that is why I mention this
article here:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/221874-is-suncor-energy-the-best-oil-company-fo
-your-portfolio?source=yahoo

Suncor has not received much mentioned here or in Big Do's thread as enthusiasm
for heavy oil/bitumen companies has waned. At the current crude prices, most
players have a hard time to reach a reasonable ROA. However if crude prices go
higher, those plays should work out really well, since they have an immense
resource base in the ground to work with.

CADC. Earnings continue in line. Forward p/e of 3. Company almost debt free.
Build out of high-speed train lines through China will drive CADC growth.
Company very tech oriented in its sector with several patents. This is not
insignificant since China officials have demanded closure of many ready-mix
concrete plants because the materials that these other companies are using
either have harmful environmental effects or don't hold up well.

I can't interpret what the "contractual agreements" mean, but CADC seems to be
a real company providing real products that the government or private
construction firms want, and CADC appears to make a profit doing it.

For these reasons, I am a buyer/holder of the stock.

re CADC - the "contractual agreement" means that CADC does not own "Xi Aon"
outright - they own a contract that CADC management claims is equivalent of
owning it. My view is that those type of contracts with Chinese entities (no
reason is given why the ownership is structured this way) is a potential cause
for problems

Also note the extremely convoluted ownership structure with many layers between
the Chinese operating subsidy and the US holding shell is highly suspicious.

A PE of 3 does not matter if all the numbers are made up. See CSKI or CHBT for
the most recent example what can happen to chinese microcaps.

Dan Meleney. That's a tough question. If it were money I absolutely couldn't
afford to lose, I guess I'd go for safety of insured CD's.

For a little more risk, maybe 1/2 CD's, maybe 1/2 in two-three funds of
high-yield bonds and preferreds. Assuming that even if there's a substantial
loss of money with a collapse in the funds (which I myself --being heavily in
these funds -- am betting there will not be, even if interest rates rise), that
there's at least money enough available to pay for that first year tuition. And
somehow, someway, money will be scrounged up to pay for the final second year.

I've no good answer that I'm comfortable with.

ELY - not really interested. Earnings erratic, ROE low, margins low. No
earnings growth in last decade and almost no sales growth. Twelve years ago it
seemed to be a Buffettology stock, but it lost its mojo and it's probably not
coming back. Might be a great case to study in business school about a known
brand that does not do well.

It's not a Graham stock yet, although it's getting close. NCAV is at 380M,
market cap at 445M. Still, I'm not sure I would value their inventory and A/R
at full value, maybe 70% or so. So it's not really NCAV stock. Might not get to
NCAV value because there is still some brand recognition (value) left. Being

The seekingalpha is a good layman's analysis of SU. It does not go into much
details but mentions what is driving SU business (production costs comparison)
and under which assmuptions it makes sense to invest in SU.
MRO is not mainly a refiner - the majority of it's profit come from the E&P
segment and per MCDEP about 75% of it's values lies within the upstream
business. Because it has an integrated model too but is mostly conventional
upstream, I think a comparison of SU and MRO is instructive.

re MRO
>> That's why I hate integrateds.<< it depends on what you pay for the R&M
part.
MRO's market cap is 28B%, proved reserves are 1.7BOE (60% oil / 40% gas).

The crude reserves are worth: 1.7x0.6x15$=15.3B$
gas reserves: 1.6x0.4x6x1.5$=5.76B$

So the reserves along cover 21B$ of MRO's 28B$ EV. For the rest you get a R&M
business that is able to generate 1B$ in profit in decent year, an integrated
gas business (worth probably 2B$+)plus an oils sand business (no proved
reserves were booked in the oils sand segment) plus ancillary assets.

This is pretty cheap in my book. I'll take a Refining and marketing asset ,
especially a best in class one any time if I don't have to pay for it.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/LINN-Energy-to-Acquire-pz-142477670.html?x=0&.v=1

From the article:"... Significant characteristics of the three acquisitions
are:

* Net production of approximately 3,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day (73
percent oil);
* Proved reserves of approximately 30 million barrels of oil equivalent (72
percent oil);
* More than 230 Wolfberry drilling locations representing proved undeveloped
reserves of 23 million barrels of oil equivalent; and
* Reserve life of approximately 25 years..."

Was this a very good deal?

30 Million BOE crude /$352 million = $11.73 per "proved" BOE

New positions: DST, MDT, GAME
Positions increased: UVIC, GLW, PBEGF, GFRE, NEWN
Positions reduced: FR-J/K
Positions eliminated: HALL, TIP, WUHN, NCTY, ATPG, AMPH

Bonds and prefs are continuing to rally, which makes it tough to hold the
remaining somewhat-high-yielders. Sold more of FR-J/K on dividend announcement
and runup over $19. Dumped TIP - it was a very short-term cash park - to invest
money elsewhere. None of the remaining high-yielders are very attractive as
buys, except perhaps NRF-A/B, but I just have too much of it already. And it
definitely has a bunch of warts.

Sold AMPH on takeover news. Sold NCTY on quarterly results and stock price
runup from the net-net land - great short term return, shoulda bought more. :)
Sold WUHN and HALL on disappointing quarterly results. Decided I liked my other
energy holdings better than ATPG.

On the buy side, most are familiar names. Added to GLW, PBEGF, GFRE, NEWN as
they fell. NEWN is risky, since company just bought two other companies, so the
accounting is probably obfuscated. Not for the faint of heart.

New positions: DST - is a smaller cousin of BRK's recent purchase FISV. IMHO,
DST has better numbers than FISV. Not terribly cheap though. MDT - discussed
here in the past, not terribly cheap either, but it reached my "dip toes" point

Just a note to holders of GRVY -

---------------------------------
 Our status as a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) in 2009 and
potentially other years could result in adverse U.S. tax consequences for you.

In light of the nature of our business activities and our holding of a
significant amount of cash, short-term investments, and other passive assets
after our initial public offering, we may have been since our initial public
offering a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In particular, due to the
deterioration of the trading price of our ADSs, we believe that we were a PFIC
in 2008 and 2009, and there is a significant risk that we will continue to be a
PFIC in 2010. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which you hold our
ADSs or common shares, you could be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax
consequences. You are urged to consult your tax advisors concerning the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of holding our ADSs or common shares if we are
considered a PFIC in any taxable year. See ITEM 10.E. “TAXATION — U.S. FEDERAL
INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS — Passive foreign investment companies.”

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_foreign_investment_company

My read of this is that any cap gains are treated as ordinary income + some
kind of additional tax form might have to be filled if GRVY is sold in the same
year it is bought. However, if the stock is held over calendar year, the taxes
have to be paid each calendar year of holding. Not sure how they are computed.

Not sure about the holdings in tax deferred accounts.

I am not an accountant and definitely not a tax accountant. Consult your tax
accountant for exact information.

I wonder how many Chinese small caps are also PFICs without even telling US
investors they are such. (I have no clue what rules apply to multi tier
ownership structures common in some Chinese small caps.).

I also wonder if PFIC rules apply to stocks other foreign holding companies.
Apparently banks and certain other companies (insurance? REITs?) are exempt
from PFIC designation and rules, however, exact rules are unclear. :/ Anything
that looks like foreign mutual fund seems to carry a PFIC risk, but apparently
some "does not look like PFIC" companies are unfortunately PFICs. Not clear how
much of this is policed and enforced by IRS either.

just a blip? The sales seem to be zigzagging with couple year period, so I
wonder if right now is a zig just before a zag down.
- Net margins are pretty low. What's to prevent 2001-2003 period losses if the
margins get squeezed? (Or teeny 2004-2006 EPS due to the same?)
- What's the deal with preferred share right issuance in 2009?

This is very unlikely since it would be easy to prove tax fraud for the Chinese
government officials. If it is the other way and they defraud US investors
nothing will happen to them (unless they are stupid enough trying to enter US
territory). The US shell company will be close down by the SEC, the Chinese
fraudsters will keep their loot (no extradition agreement with the US) and US
investors are out their money.

You seem to imply the system is corrupt systemically. Auditors are shady or
able to be bribed, companies lie, companies bribe government officials.

If this is so there's no reason that an outsider can rely on any numbers from
any of these small (or larger) companies. Assuming this is correct, I'll
extricate myself from the Chinese microcaps in which I'm showing stock losses,
and redeploy funds.

We know the country's still growing, so some companies are growing their
businesses and making profits. Maybe the small shareholder will never see the
fruits of it, but I'll continue to take a chance for now with a few Chinese
microcaps --although with even less of a portion of my portfolio.

That seems ridiculous to me but there it is. if you are canadian i think the
warrants are ridiculously cheap. This was the situation I described in the
warrant puzzle a while back where everyone recommended I sell the warrants. I
think they expire in early january. This is a situation where if the managers
were really working for the shareholders they would be buying up the warrants
and retiring them. Instead they want them to be exersized as that will improve
their fees. Gold and Siver are making new highs today with Silver over $20. SLW

Well, it is tough to evaluate how much system is corrupt systemically, however,
IMHO to some point it is. Auditors are shady or able to be bribed, companies
lie, companies bribe government officials. - yes to all of those. Not all the
time and not all the companies, but yes. I think we have seen at least one
example of each in the last year at least.

BTW, for some reason Americans think that bribing government officials is a big
crime and it always means that the company misleads investors too. That's not
necessarily true. From my experience in Eastern Europe and Russia (it may only
partially apply to China), the company can avoid taxes, get sweetheart deals,
bribe officials and still be OK to shareholders. Yes, the risk is there that
they will fleece shareholders too. It's dumb to deny it. But it's not "bribe
officials" == "fleece shareholders". :)

So why do I invest in China? Because of the huge potential returns. Yes, there
are risks of young economy with corruption and non-shareholder oriented
managements. But there are also rewards. And things may get better with time.
In most of the Eastern Europe they did. In Russia... well not much. :) It is
slippery market, where you have to assess the company on ongoing bases and get
out if there are too many skeletons. On the other hand, you are paying 2-7 PE
for overcapitalized, growing companies. If they manage to grow without
stumbling over fraud, corruption, etc. issues, they can lead to multibaggers.

While I have a few multibaggers, I also have many more down 50 to 90%. The ones
that are down now, when I bought them all had numbers with low p/stated bv, low
p/e, high roe, growing reported sales.

So many of these companies have issued new shares which have diluted and
otherwise adversely affected their current shareholders. Perhaps the company
managements see the growth possibilities in their country, and this is their
way of raising capital and preparing themselves.

I like some of these companies still, but I'll take my losses at this point.

That being said, I've got to think this PFIC issue is going to be an issue for

Average cost is $10.96/BOE for 89MMBoe.

Company near it's high but yield is 8.5% based on previous payouts.

This is a tracking position and will build the position if more acquisitions

re RIMM -

You could argue the case for RIMM as a value play at this level i suppose, it
has alot of similar metrics going for it as tech stocks in 02,03. I have been
short the name for a while on its way to becoming a value play.

The thing that you have to keep in mind and why it has baffled even value
investors at this level is institutions that have been holding a majority of
the stock have been growth oriented institutions, not value. Every opportunity
that these funds have had to dump the stock they have taken advantage of it.

And when you start seeing these metrics where the growth % change starts to get
on the other side of the bell curve, and my guess this descent is going to
continue as Android and iphone continue to take share (and we are not even
seeing the effect on decline in corporate enterprise use and my belief that is
not even reflected yet, i hate my BB that i have to use for work fyi.. thing is
clunky)

2/26/2007 2065845000
2/27/2007 3037103000 47.02%
2/27/2008 6009395000 97.87%
2/27/2009 11065186000 84.13%
2/27/2010 14953224000 35.14%

EPS Projections:
2/26/2007 0.67
2/27/2007 1.14 70.15%
2/27/2008 2.31 102.63%
2/27/2009 3.35 45.02%
2/27/2010 4.35 29.85%

the company is also not getting more lean trying to etch out more performance
except through failed innovation attempts, not that i think it matters at this
point on the earnings curve... ie most of BS is inline with sales and direct
expense items moving up and revenue tailing off...

Direct Costs/Total Revenue
2010 0.559675826
2009 0.539339149
2008 0.48737252
2007 0.454150221
2006 0.447862739

I get confused on how to value these companies on a PE basis. I am not sure how
you all really do it, i mean what historically works for these out of favor
tech companies seems to be buy around 7 PE and sell around 14 or 15. RIMM is
trading around 9.

The numbers that RIMM are producing are really good, yes. I would stay away
though, i know you all do not like to bottom pick, but i think you can get in
at a better price. Looking at the latest institutional holdings, they are
declining (#s and % basis), the reason this is important is because of the
supply that will continue to come online, while this is probably not a concern
for you all, IMHO middle ground is no value at all at this point and this name.

I am out of this stock, the selling for the moment as appeared to stop, i will
probably look dumb when it rallies to 60 in a strong market, but i will get
short again.

Jurgis....UFPT - Growth came from acquisitions and organically. The company has
been very prudent in it's acquisitions as evident by lack of goodwill
write-offs and related one-time charges, not to mention increasing gross,
operating, and net margins over time. Decent insider holdings also express
corporate accountability, especially for a company like UFPT that makes
frequent acquisitions

Organic sales decreased recently due to the economic slowdown but the company
made some good acquisitions, boosting results. Medical and military sales also
offset lower sales in the auto sector.

2001 - ($0.72) - sales down due to general economic slowdown and lower demand
for auto's, electronic components (packaging)
2002 - ($0.05) - soft economic demand
2003 - ($0.33) - softness in economy continues
2004 - $0.19 - economic demand picks up
2005 - $0.13
2006 - $0.49
2007 - $0.77
2008 - $0.91
2009 - $1.01
2010 - $1.48 - boosted by acquisitions

GTSI,

Thanks for mentioning this one. The stock does seem very cheap to me, so I own
a little bit. The seeking alpha goes pretty well into the reasons for owning
the stock, so I'll give you some counterpoints. Basically, here are a few what
I'd call somewhat "intangible negatives" for why I don't own more:

1. CEO Jim Leto quit earlier this year It could be he wants to spend time with
the family, but it makes me pause. Maybe he sees the business declining and
wants to get out before it goes downhill.

2. They have had on-and-off results over the past five years and the recent
trend doesn't look that great. See excerpt below.

For the second quarter of 2010, GTSI reported sales of $135.0 million, compared
to $164.6 million in second quarter of 2009. The Company continued to be
impacted by an overall decrease in hardware and software revenue due to various
government agencies spending trends. Gross margin for the second quarter of
2010 was $17.4 million as compared to $23.0 million for the second quarter of
2009. The Company experienced decreased activity with two Department of Defense
customers and continued pricing pressures from vendors that negatively impacted
gross margin.

With the trend to try to cut the fat from government spending, I think the
macro factors could well go against this stock. I have the same problem with
another stock KSW, which seems cheap but appears to have macro tailwinds
against it right now.

Being stuck in seemingly cheap, but illiquid, stocks with macro headwinds
against them is not my ideal spot.

3. Also, this is even harder to quantify, but their quarterly write-ups seem a
bit "BS"-like to me. I like straightforward and concrete explanations (think
Warren Buffett) versus jargon and vague statements whose real meaning is hard
to decipher. I feel companies that use jargon too much are often trying to
baffle investors with BS in order to cover up their problems.

Here is an example of what I mean:

“While we are changing the business model to a more sustained, predictable
revenue systems integrator, we are still susceptible to quarterly fluxuations
related to our core product business. For example, during the second quarter we
had several large transactions push into the third quarter, which were booked
in July. Despite the challenges of the second quarter we are making strides
within the strategic plan and goals for 2010 and beyond.

“Overall the health of GTSI is sound. Our marketplace continues to be robust
and offer significant opportunities. We are focused on executing on our
strategy to advance our leadership in services and expect to deliver key
contracting vehicles in the latter half of 2010 and early 2011 that will propel
GTSI into the services realm in the years to come. We believe that GTSI is now
ready to shift focus towards a growth model,” said Scott Friedlander, GTSI’s
President and Chief Executive Officer. “We will continue to manage and adjust
our model towards an enterprise solutions and services focused systems
integration with 50% of our gross margin from services by 2013.”

Best,
MC

GTSI. A stock well known to some of us.

I don't know exactly what it's business is now. It sold upgraded computers and
computer software primarily or solely to the US Govt, and that abruptly ended
when the contracts weren't renewed.

I'd be interested in the company again when it's a net net.

Right now company is overvalued -- my opinion of course. It's return on equity
is terrible, regardless of its stated book value. Profit margins aren't good at
all. OTOH, p/sales is low, so maybe they can eke some higher profits on future
sales.

(I'm just looking at the overall company, from a Yahoo/SI stat page.)

The company's hidden asset has earnings that can be taken into GTSI's balance
sheet. It's an asset though that GTSI maybe can control or maybe not. They may
or may not easily dispose of their portion of that business or force a sale of
the company or manage the direction of that company. So it's a second business
that the small stockholder has to be concerned about. If the analyst values
those earnings at 7.5x, then maybe GTSI should be valued only at 7.5x too. (I
don't know.) Currently the p/e is 13 with forward p/e 8.5x.

I've had mixed success trading stocks where the hidden assets are shares of
other companies. The gist is that the sum of the shares of all the businesses
(often easily calculated because the companies are publicly traded), that the
mother company has is higher than the enterprise value of the mother company
itself. Thus a margin of safety, and an opportunity for the mother stock to
rise if/as one or more of the holding company stocks do well. The issue is that
everything sometimes seems to be correlated, and/or the value does not seem to
close,or I've had to wait a very long time to see success - the dinkier the
company, the longer the wait (it seems).

If you buy, Rainmaker888, you may find your experience different from mine. For
me, the stock's just worth a bet to me at current price. GL.

Chinese gaming stocks. There's couple of issues. First, as you can see in
yesterday's GAME report, the revenues and earnings are slowing down and
dropping. Whether this is a temporary drop or the market is fully saturated is
tough to say. The bulls argue that soccer world cup draw gamers from gaming to
watching TV. The bears will argue that the market is saturated and more bad
news are coming. IMHO it is tough to judge.

Second, I think part of the drop is overall negative view of Chinese economy
and stocks, i.e. it is a macro drop.

GAME is a partial spinoff from SNDA. SNDA still owns majority of GAME stock.
SNDA does not really have much of other businesses except for GAME, but they
want to become a media company. IMHO SNDA is much riskier play than GAME.

CYOU is a partial spinoff from SOHU. SOHU still owns majority of CYOU stock.
SOHU does have other media/advertising businesses, so it is somewhat attractive
too.

Overall, gaming industry is very competitive and driven by hit cycles. Looking
at US company results (ATVI, ERTS), they have great results in some years and
sucky results in others. Considering this, it might be better to wait for
Chinese gaming companies to show losses before buying. On the other hand, if
the blip is temporary and more eyeballs/users are coming with the rise of
middle class / students / etc., then it might be that current prices are good
enough. :) I own smallish positions and would add only on price drops.
