I've got small orders out for several cigar butts, but mostly I can't seem to
get my price. Maybe lots more people scouring the ground for these things. Or
maybe I'm a little too conservative in my bids.

Picked up a little INHX today. A biotech development-stage company. I will bet
and hope that before the company burns through its cash, the stock might once
again rise up. Stock is selling now below cash value, as mentioned by Hatteras
on 50% Gains thread. Of course, one is really never sure with these
development-stage companies which not only don't have earnings, but hardly have
sales, that there's really any margin of safety just because they sell below
cash on hand.

Just a few shares of SVN. Newspapers in the Chicago market. (It's the old
Hollinger.) Terrible history as regards profitability. Ad market continues down
now too. According to Yahoo, company has lots of cash, not much ltd. If so,
company - and maybe me too - can wait it out for a year or two for better
times. For buying just a few shares here I'm willing to assume SVN's business
might be bottoming out, but that it still exists.

Wallace Rivers, about LM.

Now THAT is a buy for me at current price. Thanks for mentioning.

I'm not worried about integration of acquisition, lower than expected earnings,
continued earnings decline. I buy these on AUM (assets under management). On
that basis, in 15 seconds looking at AUM:market cap., I can say it's for me.

I'll take a little and beef up position if I confirm that not too much of their
AUM are with fixed income funds. AUM like bonds aren't nearly as valuable as
stock funds where fees are so much greater.

Hi Paul - When comparing LM (Legg Mason Inc.) to its peers, what about LEH
(Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.). From a PE measure, LEH looks like a better
value. LEH has 207 billion assets under management but is selling near it's all
time high. Which company is a better "value" LM or LEH?

Price to book looks better for LM with 1.89 (LM) vs 2.36 (LEH). LM is near it's
52 week low and does pay a higher dividend.

I have always liked the Vanguard Mutual Funds and their different services. Can
one buy shares in this company?

EKS, I don't see LEH as predominantly in the same sector as LM. I view LEH as
an investment bank and a specialist in fixed income stuff--- not so focused as
a mutual fund firm like LM. So to me LEH wouldn't be a stock that trades on
AUM. (I could be wrong.) All that said, LEH might be a buy at current price
nonetheless.

Reviewing my LEH position now - I have a few shares - and I see I my remaining
shares were established in '98 @ under $7/sh.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=5935082&srchtxt=leh

Surprised now to see how it's actually performed over the years. It's been one
of these companies for me, where you just let the management run and not worry
about the stock price (which is easier to do when, like me,the person only has
a few shares). I see I sold some shares this year in March and April at the
split adjusted equivalent of about $73. While the stock may still be reasonably
priced or even attractive, I note the p/book and p/sales are relatively high.
OTOH, profit margins and roe are up a lot too. (Are the good times
sustainable?) I'll continue to hold on to my remaining few shares. LM looks to
me like the better bet. Maybe I am just prejudiced because LM stock is down
(cheaper?) and LEH stock is up (more expensive?). Possible.

Jmo based on my interests. I could be wrong on either as a buy or sell.

I bought LM today as well, as the stock did hit my limit price. LM trades for
about 1.3% of assets, which is cheaper than any other asset manager i know of.
the apparent reasons for the low valuation are the integration issues with the
Citigoup assets and the lackluster performance of the Lm flagship funds. but I
think they should be able to overcome these hurdles, as their LT track record
is quite good. I think buying LM now is a good example of buying an above
average company with some temporary problems for a below average valuation.

Our Pets earnings released:

OurPet's Company Reports Record 2006 Third-Quarter and Nine-Months Financial
Results
Wednesday October 25, 8:30 am ET

FAIRPORT HARBOR, OH--(MARKET WIRE)--Oct 25, 2006 --

-- Third-Quarter Revenues Up 39.3%
-- Third-Quarter Net Income Up 237.2%
-- Signs Exclusive Licensing Agreement with DockDogs&#174;
-- Management Optimistic About Last Quarter of 2006
OurPet's Company (OTC BB:OPCO.OB - News): a growing designer, developer,
producer, and marketer of accessory and consumable pet products, today reported
financial results for its third quarter and nine months ended September 30,
2006.

Net revenues for the 2006 third quarter increased 39.3 percent to $2,256,020
from $1,619,413 in the same period a year ago. Gross margin, as a percent of
sales for the 2006 third quarter, increased to 29.4 percent from 26.0 percent
in the 2005 third quarter. Net income for the 2006 third quarter was $144,470,
compared to $42,839 for the same period in 2005, or an improvement of 237.2
percent. Earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
(EBITDA), for the 2006 third quarter increased 125.6 percent to $278,349,
compared to $123,375 for the 2005 third quarter.

Revenues for the nine months of 2006 increased 31.8 percent to $6,559,530 from
$4,978,373 in the comparable period last year. For the 2006 nine months, gross
margin was 26.6 percent compared to 27.1 percent in the 2005 nine months. The
gross margin in the nine months of 2006 decreased as a result of lower
profitability on certain Pet Zone products and aggressive pricing to penetrate
new market segments. Net income for the 2006 nine months was $223,704, from
$170,270 for the same period in 2005 -- an improvement of 31.4 percent. EBITDA
for the 2006 nine months increased 49.8 percent to $616,265 from $411,322 for
the 2005 nine months.

Dr. Steven Tsengas, President and CEO stated, "The Company reported record
revenues and earnings for both the 2006 third quarter and nine months. Further,
the 2006 year-to-date revenues and earnings are almost equal to what they were
for the 2005 full year. The Company's growth over the third-quarter and
nine-month period is a result of increased acceptance of our products with
consumers, the addition of Pet Zone products, successful marketing efforts, and
benefits from our previously disclosed cost reduction initiatives.

"The second half of the year is normally the strongest period of the year and
we are pleased to begin the second half with record sales and earnings, which
bodes well for our 2006 full-year results. Our financial results tend to
fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, as a result of customer decisions related to
promotions and new product roll-outs, and supplier schedule adherence
associated with mold completions and product deliveries. We are working hard to
increase our customer distribution and with our suppliers to limit these
fluctuations.

"We continue to have success penetrating new distribution channels and are
pleased to have recently signed an exclusive licensing agreement with
DockDogs&#174; -- the governing body for the nation's fastest growing canine
sport. DockDogs&#174; events feature dogs running off a dock into a pool of
water, competing to see which one can jump the farthest. According to the
agreement, OurPet's will become the exclusive provider of a line of licensed
DockDogs&#174; pet products, to be sold at all DockDogs&#174; events, as well
as online and through retail stores beginning in early 2007. Further, OurPet's
will display and promote its own product line through the DockDogs&#174;
website www.dockdogs.com and at all of its 2007 events and demos. The initial
roll-out of DockDogs&#174; licensed merchandise will include 10-15 SKUs, with a
mix of both OurPet's proprietary products and non-proprietary products."

Dr. Tsengas concluded, "This is an exciting time for OurPet's. Our trailing
twelve months revenues and earnings now stand at $8,147,564 and $307,672,
respectively. Along with our continued aggressive new product development
program, we are expanding our infrastructure and investing in additional
personnel to position OurPet's for future growth. We are optimistic that
financial results for the 2006 fourth quarter and full year will compare
favorably to the same periods last year. We look forward to communicating our
2006 annual financial results, which should be released in March 2007."

EKS,re. PLT: in "Hot Research" section of today's on-line Barron's, there's a
nice write-up on PLT by Robert W. Baird & Co.

Some snippets:

"PLANTRONICS' FISCAL SECOND-QUARTER REVENUE was in line and earnings per share
came in above expectations; management guided the fiscal third quarter lower
primarily due to Altec Lansing Technologies.

Despite this, we are upgrading Plantronics to Outperform [from Neutral] given
the positive revenue and margin trends in the call-center and office segment
and a compelling sum-of-the-parts valuation; we value the call-center and
office segment at $20 per share alone."

Hi Paul - I do not know where you come up with these different value stories
but ARA looks like a very interesting "value" special situation. I have two
questions that I could not find after reviewing the ARA home page. First, does
ARA have any currency exposure vs the U.S. dollar. They have a good product but
if it's value is pegged in Brazil currency, it's possible that the net return
in U.S. $'s to the U.S. stock holder could be impacted by negative currency
conversions.

On their Web site, they detail how they have a network of ocean barges that can
get product out and to China. They did not say who the shipping company is and
if they sell shares in this company. Not only is ARA a potential "value" buy,
but the shipping company that holds the contract to ship the pulp to China
should be a buy. Do you know who the shipper is that has the contract to ship
ARA product?

Excellent find Paul. I plan to step up and buy a few shares in ARA on any pull
back. The overall "theme" sounds good for continued growth in their business
and it helps my portfolio to diversify some assets to a foreign company.

Paul, KNX was brought to my attention by a member of my investment club. We've
been looking for small cap fast growers and he found it through a screen. I
haven't followed the logistics sector at all, so it's possible there are better
competitors out there.

What has impressed me about KNX, beyond what I saw in the initial screen, is
the quality of their financial reports, which I think do a good job of
explaining their business, and their conference call transcripts, where
management seems focused on controlling costs, and in being disciplined in
pursuing new business. The one blemish so far is the aforementioned option gift
to the chairman. Ironically, up to that point they had been relatively
restrained in their options grants.

Having said that, I'm still in the initial phases of reviewing this company and
this sector, so in the course of my research I may find something better. This
does look like a sector worth studying.

SNY, IR - i also bought some SNY today. I agree it's cheap based on forward
earnings (somewhat iffy because of Plavix patent issues), P/S and a fairly
decent pipeline with a potentially great obesity pill.

Hiccup with IR, due to shrinking business in construction (Bobcat). The
remainder of the business is doing well and the stock is cheap. I am holding
and might add if the weakness in the stock persists.

Hi Paul - Does CX $12.8 Billion Bid for Rinker change your valuation opinion
for CX? I see it as a long term positive as management is expecting good growth
and requires the raw material assets that Rinker provides to service this
growth. Short term, CX may be over paying. I will be watching to see if there
is a short term correction in the next several months as their offer is
evaluated.

Cemex Makes Unsolicited $12.8 Billion Bid for Rinker
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=aofYC8qSVWSI&refer=latin_am
rica
From the article"...Cemex said it will take two years following the acquisition
of Rinker to bring down its net debt to 2.7 times earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow known as Ebitda.
At the end of September, Cemex's debt was 1.8 times Ebitda....",

=============================================================

As the number 3 producer in the marker, they still can move up two positions.
Also, with the Panama bid out there, CX will have the raw materials to service
a winning bid proposal. It's an eight year contract too.

I wonder what shipping companies plan to bid on the Panama project if materials
need to be shipped from Australia to Panama.

Sounds like MPW is fixing that glitch pretty well. It's amazing to watch the
herd selling in unison today, when the company put out a solid report. I doubt
the dip lasts long, but who knows?

As the Company has previously disclosed, the original tenant of the Company's
West Houston Town & Country Hospital and Medical Office Building has faced
financial challenges primarily due to the absence of key managed care
contracts. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, MPT terminated the lease
with the original tenant and replaced it with a recently organized partnership.
The partnership has entered into an interim management arrangement with an
experienced third party healthcare management firm to operate the facilities.
During this interim period, the partnership tenant will be owned and controlled
by one of MPT's most successful hospital operators, Vibra Healthcare.

"At this time we are actively negotiating with several large hospital systems
that are interested in leasing our facility under terms and conditions that we
believe are generally preferable to those of the previous lease," said Aldag.
"All of these systems are well capitalized and have the necessary managed care
contacts already in place. In each of our tenant relationships, we negotiate
protective covenants in our leases and liquid credit enhancements that are
designed to allow us to move quickly to replace a poorly performing tenant and
otherwise act to protect our investment and earnings stream. Because of our
careful underwriting and pre-planning concerning the Town & Country tenant, we
believe that we will be able to conclude these negotiations quickly and without
material adverse financial consequences." The Company stated that there is no
assurance of a successful release of the facilities.

The Company also disclosed that Vibra Healthcare has repurchased the Kentfield
long-term acute care hospital and has made an initial $3.8 million reduction of
its loan from MPT. Vibra has notified MPT that it expects to make a further
loan payment of approximately $7.5 million pending clearance of certain
regulatory matters with respect to the Kentfield hospital. Vibra expects such
clearance by mid-November, although there is no assurance that the state
regulatory authority will act promptly.

Based on operating results for the first eight months reported by the Company's
tenants, MPT's weighted average EBITDAR lease coverage ratio approximated 2.85
times (after taking into account a one-time management fee, the coverage was
3.88 times compared to 3.35 times for the corresponding period in 2005);
approximately 58% of all tenants' patient days during the quarter resulted from
Medicare patients, while commercial payors, Medicaid, and other reimbursement
sources represented 22%, 15% and 5%, respectively of patient days.

EKS, I'm disappointed in CX's acquisition. I don't like Rinker's location in
the apparently suffering Florida market, and Rinker has diverse businesses
which CX has no expertise in. Plus, CX seems to be paying too high a price for
the company. OTOH, CX might have expansion or divestiture plans for RIN
different from what RIN are doing now. CX has a history of making and
successfully integrating acquisitions world-wide.

I've posted on CX here for many years. I have a full position. I have much
lesser holdings in EXP. I'll put RMIX and RMX on my watch list now.

very nice plug for cnq in this weeks barrons. Think they read our thread? I
hope they will write something nice about SIL soon. SIL now over 10% of my
portfolio. CNQ 6.5%.

I am now reading a new book called The consilient investor. Very interesting
reading. Mentions in one chapter the fact that most successful investment
managers over time have concentrated portfolios and very low turnover. On the
other hand most portfolio manager feel that the way to keep their jobs is to
shadow the index performence and try just to beat it by a couple of points
every year thus many stocks and high turnover. Over time 75% of the manager
underperform the index. So if I ever become a passive investor the thing to do
would hold mutual funds of these types of managers. In another chaper he
relates a story and concludes that most people are risk averse to the point of
being unwilling to risk losing $1 to win $2 if they are right on a 50/50
proposition. Trying to relate this to SIL I feel IM risking around $10 to win
$40-50, and the proposition may well be better than 50/50.

Hi Paul - posted this on Crossy's board but decided it really didn't fit over
there, so I deleted and posted here.

I found this insider buy on one of Legg Mason's fund. May just be a matter of
normal business - new manager may be expected to own a piece of the pie. But
the divi and PE look attractive and Gendelman's history sounds interesting.

Name: LMP Capital and Income Fund Inc
Ticker: SCD
Current Price: $18.20
Market Cap: $572.75 million
Insider Action: Buying
Date of Trade: 10/25/2006
Average Price: $18.17

Comments:

A decade ago, Legg Mason was the number-two brokerage firm in Baltimore. Now it
is one of the top two listed asset managers in the world by many measures and
perhaps the most successful. As of June 30th this year, its assets under
management added up to around $855 billion. The transformation has had a bit to
do with luck, a lot to do with Bill Millers stock-picking record and most of
all to do with Raymond Chip Masons company-building strategy. Over the past 20
years he has acquired a string of ever larger asset-management companies. Last
December Chip Mason, whose success, like Millers, has been based on making
unusual and optimistic bets, inked his biggest deal to date: the swap of Legg
Masons 1,500-strong traditional brokerage unit for Citigroups
investment-management arm, which at the time oversaw assets worth $400 billion.

The asset swap suited both sides. Legg Masons retail distribution network was
fairly small; Citigroups was vast. Legg Masons asset-management results have
been superb; Citigroups mostly undistinguished, as often happens with brokers
in-house products. After all, when a financial adviser can recommend a
proprietary fund to a client, a clear conflict of interest arises. Following
investigations that swept through Wall Street, the giant bank was anxious to
get out of the regulatory glare and re-establish a reputation for objectivity.
It initiated the deal.

Chip Mason, who has been concerned about such conflicts for years saw his
chance and took it. His move, however, amounted to more than opportunism. One
of the attractive listed investment vehicles acquired by Legg Mason was Salomon
Brothers Capital and Income Fund, now renamed LMP Capital and Income Fund Inc
(Ticker: SCD). Last July $572.75 million (market cap) SCD got a new manager,
Robert I. Gendelman, who since his appointment has been a steady buyer of the
stock. Gendelman, who knows better than anyone how the fund is performing, most
recently spent $181,672 of his own money buying 10,000 shares at $18.17 each.

He came to SCD, which at the last count had total assets of around $618
million, after a three-year stint running a long-short hedge fund at
Cobblestone Partners, LLC. Before that Gendelman spent nine years with
Neuberger, managing Neuberger Berman Partners from 1994 to 2000 and Neuberger
Berman Regency between 2000 and 2003. He has an adventurous streak, seeking out
opportunities across all asset classes and in any variety of allocations he
sees fit. Gendelman, who has a superb track record, looks for companies
generating lots of free cash with a high probability of meeting or beating his
three-year capital-appreciation projections.

At $18.20 SCDs trailing p/e is 5.36, with the stock bolstered by a 6.60% yield.
Given the strength of the market and Gendelmans stock picking prowess, SCD is
worth tucking away for a long and profitable ride.

could be, but as you noted in your previous post, it's quite unclear at this
point whether there is a compelling reason to buy this fund vs. its competitors
or a simple index ETF...they aren't really going out on any limb to take on
those holdings, so i don't see a lot of chance for outperformance

the discount is nice, but if it isn't closed by increased buying, it is not a
discount you can exploit...many of these funds have narrowed their discounts of
late, this one hasn't, probably because of its relative underperformance

i would also pass at this point, but will keep it on a watch list in case it

TSY. I generally am riding these takeovers to the end. For TSY, TSY rose today
to +- a few pennies from the buyout offer (I don't envision a better offer to
be forthcoming.), so I sold this morning.

I want to increase funds available for purchases of attractive stocks that
might be hit by tax loss selling in the next few weeks. For that opportunity,
by selling TSY now (instead of waiting into 1q of next year when management
says deal will be completed), I am guessing the trade-off is that I forgo the
last dividend.

Bridge Player. It'd be misleading if I list out stocks in which I've made a
"significant investment".

Basically, I've found that my best investments (percentage gainers) turn out to
be surprises to me. My largest investments cannot be presumed to be my best
investments or my best ideas. Sometimes I'll make a relatively large investment
in a stable, dividend-paying stock (where I have no expectation of a capital
gain) just to offset volatility in a portfolio.

Sometimes I'll pick an investment thesis and a-priori decide I'll average up if
the thesis seems to be working out. So, for example, I've built significant
positions in some oil-related stocks by buying small amounts (sometimes ever
smaller amounts) as they've moved up. I wouldn't recommend or suggest anybody
start a position in any of these now.

It seems to me, rather than having "strong, positive opinions" and heavy
weighting on a stock, I'm more likely to have such opinions on a particular
sector. I seem to have a tendency to buy small amounts of a particular stock
and then, either as I learn more or become more comfortable, I often expand by
purchasing small amounts in other related companies. Some examples of that
would be with Business Development Companies, hotel reits, clothing stores,
auto companies, brokerage firms, etc. A good size weighting per sector with
maybe a total of forty or more different positions.
----------------

For a specific idea from something held large in my portfolio, somebody might
consider looking at COP. Here's a stock that is a significant holding for me.
I've averaged up and I've averaged down. (Have not sold any shares.) Not very
happy about the volatility I've experienced. Also I'm concerned I may have
misjudged this stock as a value opportunity. My confidence level is low. I
expect I will continue to hold (not add more -- too scared). Sometimes -- just
sometimes -- such a stock as this turns out to be a decent investment.

There are a lot of closed ends out there that trade at a significant discount
to NAV, and a lot of these are at/near 52 week highs. If you look at historical
prices, a lot of these same funds consistently trade at or near the same
discount. So, while a discount to NAV is good, it doesn't necessarily mean the
gap will be narrowed. Two CE funds I own with these characteristics are RTU and
FRA.

I am looking to re-enter LUV, which I've had excellent success trading over the
years. It is perceived that the legacy carriers are now the place to be, at the
expense of the discounters. Not so fast, I would argue.
There is also some concern that LUV's fuel hedging program (probably the best
in the industry) is winding down, and the company will be forced to pay closer
to market prices for jet fuel, thus pressuring margins and putting the company
on a more level playing field with other carriers. This is of some concern, but
the fact that oil has come down fairly significantly over the past few months
doesn't hurt, either.

relatively big bets on the one or few that you get confidence with.
2. Arbitrarily buy a package of those that just fall into the sector (price
below cash). (Small bets on several)
3. Just say no. For most people, it may be questionable if it's really worth

OC - the way i see it. 134.1M shares are going to be issued. 2B$ in debt.
Morgan had a backstop @30$ on 70M shares for 100M$ so they are currently under
water. Total EV value 134.1*28$+2B$=5.75B$. Revenues: 6.3B$, 800M$ EBITDA,
250M$ net income.

There is a chance that 28M shares will not be issued contingent upon Fair act
legislation> i do not know how likely this is, so i put in the mex. amount of
shares for valuation purposes.

AWI - 56.4M shares. 1.12B$ debt. EV value 56.4*37$+1.12B$=3.19B$. Revenues
3.6B$, 100M$ net earnings.

In both cases, valuation looks fairly rich to me. Have i overlooked something?

this is all speculative on my part: But I think PWE is an excellent value no
matter what happens. My own sense of this is that this is far from being a done
deal. This government is afterall a minority government so they need support of
other parties. It would seem to me is that the only fair way of doing things is
to grandfather the existing trusts and place restrictions on any new
acquisitions they can make. of course im not the government plus a lot can
happen in four years, I think 8 years might be acceptable if they are not going
to grandfather existing trusts. Otherwise I think that the trusts would have a
good case for claiming that if they are forced to reconvert to a regular
corporation that the canadian government should compensate them for their legal
costs of converting from a corporation to a trust and back again. all in all
seems like a pretty poorly considered decision just like so many we have seen

If they grandfather the existing trust, existing trusts will grow their assets
much faster, as they can take advantage of their tax advantaged status. This
would probably cause reverse takeovers, where a small trust company would take
over large assets that otherwise would have formed a new trust.

I think this deal will be done because it does not make sense for the Canadian
government and provinces to forgo taxation (for the most part when foreigners
can and do own up to 50% of many of the trust's shares.

comfortable holding at 52W highs. i intend to buy back CVX on a correction (if
the opportunity arises) or buy something else in the energy space that is
trading near lows (COP, ECA...).
