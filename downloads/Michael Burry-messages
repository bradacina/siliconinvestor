Scott and Harlan,

I worry about BZH's LT debt load relative to available cash of
only 1 million. Most of current assets are inventories, which
are substantial, but is expected. I wonder why BZH didn't rally
with the other home builders earlier this year.

NTK blows me away. I'll be buying ASAP. Love the way they
are buying back shares. They too have lotsa debt, but also
have a significant cash position of about 4 bucks/share.

My pick, PRMO, gained like a point and a half today, so I wonder
about its value, but still it has 5.5 bucks cash and lotsa potential.
Good luck. I welcome any other views.

To all:

PROVIDENCE, R.I., Oct. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- At the Nortek, Inc. (NYSE:
NTK) annual shareholder meeting, Richard L. Bready, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, announced that the Board of Directors has
authorized a program to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of the
Company's common stock, subject to market conditions and cash
availability.

Citing a belief shared with Nortek's Board, Bready said, "At the
current market price our common stock continues to be significantly
undervalued and does not properly reflect the current or potential
value of our Company." Nortek shares closed Friday at $14.50. Bready
said the Company expects to make purchases in open-market or
negotiated transactions. This is the third buy-back program Nortek
has announced in the past 12 months. Altogether, 2.4 million shares
were purchased during the two previous programs.

In his annual address to shareholders, Bready reported strong
earnings gains for Nortek and an improving economy in 1996.
He also said he was "bullish" about Nortek's future, noting the
Company's leading role in indoor- air-quality technology and the
growth prospects arising from its presence in the global marketplace.

During the regular business portion of the annual meeting, the
following Directors were re-elected to three-year terms on
Nortek's Board: William I. Kelly, Director of Northeastern
University Graduate School of Professional Accounting;
and J. Peter Lyons, President of the J. Peter Lyons Companies.
A shareholder proposal to amend the By-laws of the Company,
which would have changed the current mechanism for shareholder
nominations of directors, was defeated.

Nortek, Inc. manufactures and markets residential, commercial
and industrial building products. This release contains forward-
looking statements relating to future financial results. Actual
results may differ as a result of factors over which the Company
has no control, including the strength of domestic and foreign
economies, slower than anticipated sales growth, price and product
competition and increases in raw material costs. Additional
information which could affect the Company's financial results
is included in the Company's annual report and on Forms 10-K and 10-Q,
on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

David,

Fancy meeting you over here. I think we've met on several other
threads. In any case, thanks for the contribution. Too late
for me to be cautious; I bought in 1600 shares today. That
management has bought in 2.4 million shares and wants to buy
more back at current levels just blows me away. You just don't
see many companies doing that in this often overpriced market.

I am also counting on the overseas expansion -- another point that
sold me -- to help buffer any US recessionary sequelae.

their buyback is it shows a definite interest in stock price,

Benchmark Electronics (BHE)

About 46% of its sales are in Europe, 25% in the U.S. and the remainder in
Asia, he says. Most of its manufacturing is done in Europe. The company has a
strong balance sheet and "trades at very attractive valuations relative to its
peers and to its own historical record," Mr. Meyer says. "It meets all of our
value criteria."

Benchmark makes printed circuit boards used in electronic, telecommunications,
medical instrumentation and testing and measurement equipment products. No one
company accounts for more than 15% of its business, he says.

He calls Benchmark "a very undervalued growth play," because it sells for about
10 to 11 times earnings, compared with about 14 times earnings for many of its
competitors. He says its business is growing about 30% a year. The company's
pending acquisition of EMD Technologies will move Benchmark into the top 10
companies in its industry in the world, Mr. Kennedy says.

Re: Merisel I would stay away.

LT debt at 152 million, Short term debt at 665 million. Market
cap under 100 million. Near all time lows. $3.90/sh
loss for quarter ending 9/30 including write-offs. Undergoing
restructuring with a recent Moody's downgrade (11/21) of its

operations turnaround and the company's ability to meet substantial scheduled

Re: Open Text

Thanks for setting us onto this one. Looks like a good one, though
I feel it is more a tech/growth pick than a value play. This is
what I found out:

Based in Ontario, went public in early 96 at 15/sh. High price
26.5, now at 6.5, >50% up from its low of 4 1/8. Most recent
quarter was a .22/sh loss, 86% of which was an operating loss.
But revenues are growing quickly, with plenty of new contracts
being added. Lots of momentum. Also, has >2.50/sh in cash and
cash equivalents, so the business is valued at 4.

Optimistic statements from management abound. Couldn't find
a report on their debt load, probably because they don't have
any.

You can buy MDR for $1/sh excluding it's assets in cash and

<<Does anyone have an opinion how long before a market correction starts in

I think most reasonable investors realize that this market is overextended. I
feel we've all made money and there's no reason to hold out for the bull's last
legs. As I posted before, I am in over 70% cash at the moment.
I feel very strongly that there is the potential for not simply
a correction, but a crash. Plot the monthly Dow back 40 years,
and you'll see what I am worried about. Interest rates are
saving this market for the time being, but for how long?
Interesting fact -- if you had put your money in the Dow in the

You got me. What I meant was that if one was using the Dow as a
barometer for the market you would have lost money by holding 1969 - 1983
(during which one could die or any number of events could
occur). The broader market tends to more or less track the Dow,
and most don't have dividends.

As it stands, 5% annual return would still have lost money over that period
because inflation was so rampant. Most market historians
agree that the crash in the early 70's was worse than even 1929
because inflation was so high. People were losing money on two
fronts. Of course, no crash can stand with 1929 when it comes
to impact on the country.

I look forward to your analysis.

Re: OLS

Paul, I have concerns about OLS. In purchasing a value stock, I
usually look for one that has been going sideways for quite some
time. This one has taken a recent fall to 14 from over 30. It
has just posted it's first quarterly loss in a while, and it doesn't
have any cash free of debt. I wonder if you have some comment on
why it posted a loss and where the value is. As a temporary services
company, OLS probably doesn't have any hidden assets or much
capital investment. Further, the industry seems so incredibly

You took me much too literally. I kinda flippantly said I was
desperate, but that was really a veiled market commentary more
than anything. I'm pretty much ignoring the market right now
because I'm starting to feel that no matter how much value
one can buy now, if one waits, there will be a better value
(that is, after the market corrects/crashes/collapses). After,
all, the Dow's up about 10% in just over a month. Given that
it's been around for decades and decades, and that it's grown over
40% in the last two years, When the slope on the Dow chart starts
to approach infinity I cash out and tune out.

In any case, what was the reason for the sudden loss last

Doc,

Buy and hold becomes mantra at the end of a bull market.
Buy and hold becomes anathema at the end of a bear market.
Thanks to the raging bull for those 10 years, everyone is preaching buy, hold,
patience.
However, if you had invested in the market in 1969, you would
be at a significant loss in 1983, especially given the high
inflation of the times and the down market. In the early 50's, the common logic
was that stocks simply don't go up, thanks to the doldrums market from the mid
30's to the mid 50's.
Why can't this market conceivably crash from these levels and not recover for
20 years? I guess I am just a bit of a contrarian.

Traditionally, a good leading indicator for the business cycle
is the Dow Transports. The theory is that if the economy is slowing,
then the transports will feel it first as people reduce capital investment. If
the economy is recovering, then the transports
would recover first. Basically, If I'm Amoco and I'm going to surprise everyone
with great earnings, then the companies shipping my product are going to report
great earnings earlier. People have

Paul,

1) I guess we just disagree. Currently, the theme is, if you
are a prudent investor, you buy and hold, IMO.
2) 87,90 were just corrections in the overall bull market with no
real effect on the economy, IMO
3) I'm just going from my reading about the stock market from
this century. I obviously wasn't there. But what I've read
indicates the high inflation combined with the crash-at-first-then-
stagnant market of the 70's made the market even worse than
29-32 in terms of investment returns. We are set up for a scenario
where the market will crash (not correct, but crash) if we have
sustained upward movement in rates. This would be doubly bad for
equity investments, and similar to the 70's after the go-go period.

surprise, very manageable debt/equity, only about 48% institutional
ownership (surprisingly small for such a well-known company -- does
anyone have an idea why?), currently in a basing formation (having
recently bounced off its 200d MA), brand name + new overseas markets +
proven ability to outlast the competition. Definitely more of a
growth pick than a value pick. PE is a little rich, and NKE may
be already fairly valued, but I for one am watching it.

Here's a potential strategy -- Nike is currently basing near all
time highs. Wait for it to tell you which direction it wants to
go. Buy the day it sets a new closing high on a volume upswing.
Given the current basing formation, such a day should make a long
term up-move a high probability. Think of the couple points you
lose (vs. buying now) as insurance against a potential market downdraft.

Just my opinion,

William Lippman, of the Franklin Balance Sheet Investment Fund (which
can't buy a stock selling for more than book, but still has beat
the S&P every year since inception six years ago), is profiled in
Forbes under "Ben Graham Lives."

He lists the following as potential picks:

Aydin Corp (P/B .53)
Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal (.46)
American National Insurance (.88)

The following sell for less than current net assets:
Allou Health and Beauty Care
Allstate Financial Corp
Espey Manufacturing and Electronics Corp
Harding Lawson Associates

Other stocks he likes that bend the rules a bit:
Oil-Dri Corp (upward earnings jolt as marketing expenses decline)
Morgan Products (erratic earnings on mend)
Little Switzerland (Caribbean retailer lost a season due to hurricane)
S&K Famous Brands (men's suits in an era of casual dressing)

No analysis cuz I have no time, but I just wanted to bring them

Open Text In Livelink Licensing Pact With Hewlett-Packard

Dow Jones News Service ~ January 6, 1997 ~ 10:23 am EST
WATERLOO, Ont. (Dow Jones)--Open Text Corp. (OTEXF) said it has
concluded a corporate licensing agreement to supply Hewlett-Packard Co. (HWP)
its Livelink WorkSMART technology worldwide to implement a global virtual
information repository for Hewlett-Packard's internal use.

In a news release, Open Text said the repository will allow users of technical
documentation on Hewlett-Packard's UNIX operating system within
Hewlett-Packard to access these documents for research, authoring, re-use and
re-packaging uses.

Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, Calif., makes computing, communications and
measurement products and services.

Open Text is an intranet applications company.

OTEXF is speculation and a growth play. It re-organized this summer,
and all but 11M of that 45M is a restructuring charge, not operating
losses. The company has moved from being a search engine company
to offering comprehensive intranet products. Hence, I am discounting

Harlan,

I haven't had time to look into this, but some Lynch-type personal
stories: This is a Fresh Choice look-alike. However, I've eaten
at these restaurants, and Souplantation sucks, especially relative
to Fresh Choice, which offers much higher quality fare. In fact everyone I ate
with at Souplantation said they would never come back. How has Fresh Choice
done as an equity investment? Terrible.

The restaurant phenomenon of "open new stores to sustain growth then
cut costs as much as you can once you can't open new stores" bodes
poorly over the long term for even good restaurants like OSSI and
Longhorn. My personal feeling is that if the restaurant is mediocre
in the first place, then where are you going to cut costs?

Anyway, that's my two cents.

Zaring Homes (ZHOM)

11 3/4, PE 9.5, P/B 1.2 ($9.13 book), ROE 12.4%, ROAvgAssets 5.1%
Market cap 58 million with 12% held by 15 institutions (4.4 mill sh)
Current Ratio 4.72, Quick Ratio 0.28
Total Equity/Total Assets 0.52
Long Term Debt is ZERO. Has 3.5 mill cash.

Compared to the industry, ZHOM has not fared well. $1000 3 yrs ago
in the DJ Home Construction Industry Index would have turned into $1502, while
in ZHOM it would now be $783. Pre-tax margins have
widely fluctuated from 2.2% to 8.5% in the last four quarters.
The 8.5% occurred in the 12/31/95 quarter, which produced extremely
high earnings. "And Stanley predicts Zaring Homes Inc. (ZHOM), of Cincinnati,
will earn 26 cents a share in the fourth quarter, below the 47(!) cents it
earned last year." Does anyone have an explanation for this?

Zaring recently acquired a manufactured housing concern, and was
mentioned in the most recent Barron's. Basically, the mention concerned home
manufacturers allying with builders/developers in what
analysts believe will be a long term trend, to paraphrase.

The stock is currently above both the 50d and 200d MA on no volume.
I wonder if we could wait on this one until we see the current
earnings. Last quarter it beat estimates .36 vs .34.

Any news on insider buying?
Also, Harlan, can you give any justification for repurchasing NTK?
I like it but am worried about buying back in after its recent
steep run-up. What has occurred is already a historically huge
move for NTK.

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Premiere Radio Networks Inc. (PRNI) acquired
After MidNite Entertainment Inc. for $9.2 million, consisting of $3.9 million
in cash
and 400,000 Premiere common shares.

Premiere also named Eric Weiss, After MidNite's chairman and chief executive,
to
its board. Further information on Premiere's board size was not immediately
available.

One year from closing, if the market price of the stock is less than $16 a
share,
Premiere will pay additional consideration equal to the shortfall.

In a press release, Premiere said it expects After MidNite's 1997 revenues to
be
more than $4 million, and says its contribution to Premiere's earnings before
interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization for the twelve-month period beginning
April 1,

For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Premiere's net income was $1.26 million.

PRNI's net income for the 9/30 quarter was 1.3 million, so the

PRNI has been making about 24 million/yr, so the extra 4 million is
helpful. The acquisition ought to boost margins and make PRNI more

Only once have I ever been holding stock in a company that

Sure. Will it? Probably not. Is 10X too much? Probably. But
if a company is looking to gain market/monopoly power (such a goal
seems to be the driving force behind most media mergers vs. tech
where they are just trying to add business at a reasonable price), then PRNI
has sufficient market share in what it does to be an
attractive target. Further, it is actually making decent money.
I'm not counting on a takeover (it's just not worth the effort

Does anyone know of a good place on the WWW to get current
net asset values for closed end funds, preferably for free?

I am currently evaluating Morgan Stanley Asian Pacific Fund (APF)and the Chile
Fund (CH), having received tip-offs from The Value Advisor
Newsletter on these.

Following is an excerpt re: APF.

Morgan Stanley Asia-Pacific Fund

Ticker APF Exch NY Price 9.625 Net Assets 11.6 Discount -17% 52 week range 9.5
- 14.5 Yield 5.4%

"This Asia-Pacific fund is a closed-end investment company investing in Asian
securities markets. We feel that APF is one of the better vehicles in which to
invest in Asia/Pacific and that this region appears to be as good of an
investment value as it has been for years. The markets in Japan, South Korea,
Thailand and India have all suffered major losses this year to contribute to
the region's 2.2% drop through three quarters. APF, whose net assets actually
grew slightly during this period, takes a value approach by selling equities
that have run up significantly and increasing their weightings in stocks that
offer the greatest value in the long term. At the end of the third quarter, the
fund's investment weighting was Japan-39.8%, India-12.8%, Hong Kong-11.9%,
Australia-6.9%, Thailand-6.3%, Singapore-5.9%, Korea-3.4%, Malaysia-2.9%,
Indonesia-2.7%, Philippines-2.6% and the others 4.8%. At a time when most
closed-end funds in the beaten-down markets such as Korea and Japan are trading
at a premium, this fund's 17% discount is a welcome sight. In addition, its
dividend and low price are compelling reasons to use APF to invest in a region
that undoubtedly will have substantial long term rewards. "

Thinking of an investment here. It appears that we have a deep
discount on a bag of depressed stocks in a region that absolutely
must grow, no? I'd appreciate comments as I am just learning
about closed end funds.

Re: FRDM

You are 100% correct. A big reason for their price weakness is
they expanded too fast, hiring less-than-qualified store managers
with little credit experience. Secondary reasons are some poor
same-store comparisons and a slowing of growth in # of stores from
30-40% to 20-30%. Still, the market may have discounted this,
now at 14 from a high of 29 3/4 despite being more profitable, and
a PE of 11 despite no debt and fairly sure 20% growth. Just an
Idea. I am actually trying to get in at 14 today. Management
has indicated that they are rectifying their hiring mistakes and
are reconfiguring for solid long-term growth unhindered by the
credit problems that have plagued them the last year.

Has everyone visited The Value Advisor Newsletter site?

I've been pouring through their picks and one that intrigues me
is Numerex (NMRX, 4 1/2 with $3.11 cash and no debt). Their
analysis follows:

"Numerex designs, manufactures, and markets its proprietary Derived Channel
Systems to perform alarm reporting & other monitoring functions over telephone
lines. At first blush, Numerex looks like anything but a good value after the
year they've had. They took $0.61 per share in charges for restructuring,
obsolete inventory and a litigation settlement (wiping out their $0.10 per
share in operational earnings). Also, their annual sales were down nearly 14%
and they discontinued their $0.20/year dividend. Our position, however, is that
Numerex now has only one direction to go - up. After trading at a price of 18
less than two years ago, Numerex's slide is overdone in light of the fact they
should make money this year and they have over $3/share in cash with no debt on
their balance sheet. With this financial strength, it is worth betting that
Numerex will turnaround. 1997 results should be helped by the recent contract
with Canada Bell (with their business concentrated in the United Kingdom,
Numerex is looking to expand to other regions). Numerex themselves feel their
price is a bargain, authorizing the buyback of up to one million of their 11.6
mm outstanding shares (they've repurchased 220,000 through September 9). The
Value Fund took a position in Numerex at a price of 3.875 after following
Numerex for a year. "
*********
One brokerage rates this a "speculative buy." No kidding. But with
4.27 book, an operating profit, fistfuls of cash sans debt, I'm
thinking I'm willing to pay $1.39/sh for this business. Current
ratio is 6 thanks to all that cash. That the company is buying
makes me like the scenario all the better. It's a micro-cap at
50M and I discovered the contract with Canada Bell is really only
a trial, so I'm open to input. Any comments?

Some other picks I'm following:

Anchor Gaming (SLOT, 36 1/4) down off its high of 71 despite 50%
profit growth relative to a PE of 16.7. With 70M cash and no debt.
Current Ratio of 5.96. Story here is a busted growth stock (currently at its
lowest PE ever) that hired Merrill Lynch as an advisor to seek ways of
increasing shareholder value back on Dec 5. This news sent the stock from 41 to
46 that day, but it has settled back down since then.
Resistance is approaching rapidly in the form of a down trendline, but
if it clears that, why not buy? Growth still estimated at 23%, and
we still don't know what they're cooking up in terms of "increasing
shareholder value."

NCI Building Systems (BLDG, 37 1/4) has sales of $41 which are increasing in
the parabolic manner we all love. P/B up there
at 2.74, but has CurrentR of 2.13, .03 D/E, PE 12, and estimated
growth at 17% long term. A strong story. Barron's Dossiers
is a good way to get to know this one. Approaching all time highs
set in April 96, so may want to wait and see how it handles this
overhead resistance first.

Montgomery analyst sees buying opportunity in gaming stocks ...

SAN FRANCISCO (DBC) -- After being labeled as a business gettting too far ahead
of itself, gaming stocks may be poised for new investment opportunities. So
says Montgomery Securities gaming analyst Dave McDonald, who argues that stock

Video Update (VUPDA, VUPDZ, $4.25)

Video store chain with high top line growth (mainly via acquisitions)
muted by share offerings, most recent 6.1 M at $4 on 9/27/96.
Sells at discount to $5.9 Sales, $4.9 Book; has little to no debt
and about $.75 in cash. Same store growth of 7%. Strong technical
support at about $3.75. Weekly MACD is strongly positive.

Right after its 6M share offering in September (which depressed
the share price 21%), several brokers, including Piper Jaffray,
came out with favorable recommendations. It now has 18M shs
out and on 12/17 boosted its authorized shares to 60M from 50M.
I worry that this company will keep moving back to the public
offering well to finance its growth. Certainly it doesn't show
any sign of altering the course that has driven its share price
down from $13. IBD gives it an earnings rating of 36, a strenght
rating of 12, and a A/D rating of C. PE remains up there at
27, though based on 97 est it will be 16 -- still a premium
to its industry. Management holds only %12. I wonder where
they cashed out? Of course they may just have diluted down their
own holdings.

There is also the issue of the Class B warrrants (VUPDZ) selling
at 1 3/16 with 1.15M outstanding. I am no expert on warrants and
would appreciate some insight here.

I find better buys out there; though on a P/B or PSR basis this
company is cheap I worry about the impact of many more shares and
management's low % holdings. I am now holding REF, NMRX, OTEXF, APF, and PRNI.
Waiting on DAYR for a slightly better price.

Actually, I found confirmation of 400M in cash and cash equivalents
at their website. Now I have another question: the debt/equity
ratio is .3. How much debt do they have and what quality/type is
it? I notice one can buy their senior 9.75% 2003 notes.

Is their debt so large or troublesome that it knocks some dollars
off WHX's share value? Also, it looks like the strike negotiations are
worsening. No matter-- if it turns out I can buy a dollar for even
90 cents I'm in.

I'll keep looking.

I got my management holdings number from IBD and did no further
research in this area. If you did any research at all you are
probably correct.

Weekly MACD is a technical indicator; The weekly MACD is sometimes
used to pin down that most slippery yet most vital information --
the "long-term" trend. It turned up after a few weeks at 4.25 and
has been rising strongly since then.

PSR is Price to Sales Ratio. A book released in 1996 studied
what works on Wall Street and found that the PSR is one of
the best predictors of future stock appreciation - the lower
the PSR the better. Jeff Maresh on this thread has posted
extensively on it. As with all indicators it is a useful number,
and may be incorporated into your screening process. I like
to look for PSRs < 1 but that is not absolute because I don't
want to miss some high-growth areas. Use PSR's in conjunction
with growth rates and profit margins for more effective screening.

I talked to a friend who knows a lot about public offerings. He
said PO's are a shady business and the underwriter may be
manipulating the company more than we know if the company
keeps going back to the PO well despite a detrimental effect on
share price. The underwriters are the only ones guaranteed
to come out winners with a public offering. I don't understand
this too well myself and am staying away from VUPDA for this reason.

Answer to my own question re: WHX

From its 10Q of Sep 96 WHX has $276M in long term debt. While this
is manageable given its assets, it does detract from the valuation
of the stock. With 130M in free cash (several million) and
short term investments (the remainder) over and above debt the company appears
to be valued on this basis (130/26M shs = $5/sh plus the business at $3.5/sh).
This is all rough and not necessarily
cogent, but it just indicates that one isn't getting $16 cash for
$8.5. Now, is the business worth $3-4/sh? Management seems
to think so. If the company directly pays $3000/worker X 6000 worker
in order to end strike (as it proposed)that's an extra $18M that is
no more.

A description follows straight from my Omega Supercharts 4.0.
I apologize to those who feel this has no place on a value thread.
I just like to use TA to time my entries once I've found a stock.
By the way, I entered SLOT and JOB on bullish technical signals yesterday. Now
hold SLOT, JOB, OTEXF, PRNI, REF, APF, NMRX. Looking
to get into SUNW (I have a 24 hour optimization of my trading
system running right now specifically for SUNW).

Description:

Gerald Appel's MACD is the difference between a fast exponential moving average
(FastMA) and a slow exponential moving average (SlowMA). During rising markets,
the fast moving average will rise more quickly than the slow moving average,
resulting in a rising differential line or a larger value. During falling
markets the FastMA line will fall more quickly than the SlowMA line.
The specified length of FastMA must be shorter than the specified length of
SlowMA; if not, the oscillator will invert (that is, buy signals will become
sell signals and sell signals will become buy signals).

Conventional Analysis:

Crossover of the FastMA line over the SlowMA line is a buy signal. Crossover of
the FastMA line under the SlowMA line is a sell signal.

Additional Analysis:

MACD is generally better at signaling the beginning of bullish moves than
bearish moves, and should be applied accordingly. In addition to the
conventional usage, careful attention should be paid to changes in MACDMA. A
downturn in MACDMA while a bullish signal is in force is often an early
indication that the current up move is losing strength and long positions
should be closed. Similarly, an up turn in MACDMA while a bearish signal is in
force may indicate that the market is finding support and is ready to rally.

<<How does one purchase shares at the bid?>>

One can't, unless one is the market maker in the stock.

<<Basically, I'm wondering who's receiving big
block trades at the ask.>>

If the trade is at the ask, then chances are it is the market
maker selling stock (and receiving the ask) to an individual
or institution. If it is a particularly large order through
a large broker like Merril Lynch, then the broker can arrange
a trade between individuals or institutions and cross the stock at a better
price for both buyer and seller (usually between the bid/ask). Also, market
makers can buy from or sell to other market makers, in which case the trade is
usually crossed at a price in between the bid/ask. The whole practice is shady.
Hopefully the new Nasdaq rules will help.

I agree with Scott. If one can't get a good price on a stock between
the bid/ask, then chances are either your broker doesn't make
a market in the stock or the broker isn't willing to give you
a break. You see this latter process when you deal with deep
discounters who clear their trades through a larger firm, e.g.
National Discount clears through Sherman. I often get in between
the spread with Schwab, which makes markets in many stocks itself.
If you can't get a good price on a stock, try another stock. If
you can't ever get a good price or you repeatedly get bad fills
I would change brokers. I'm on my 3rd broker myself.

announcement today. In line with my rationale for buying it. You're
right -- they don't seem ready to lay down and let the English economy
dictate its fortunes. A great value play.

Tuesday February 11 5:00 PM EDT

NumereX Corp. Announces Derived Channel Trial System for Argentina

MEDIA, Pa., Feb. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Numerex Corp , announced that DCX Systems
Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) has received an order
for a Derived Channel trial system from Telemonitoreo S.A. The technical trial
will be conducted by Telemonitoreo S.A. in Buenos Aires in conjunction with
Telecom de Argentina (one of the two telephone companies providing service to
Argentina).

Dr. Oscar Ghillione, President of Telemonitoreo S.A., stated, "We are pleased
to be conducting this technical trial of Derived Channel equipment. We believe
the
deployment of Derived Channel throughout Argentina will raise the level of
security for the citizens of Argentina and will provide a valuable tool that
the alarm
industry can use to improve their level of performance."

Jack Reis, President and CEO of NumereX, stated, "The receipt of an order for a
Derived Channel trial system from Argentina represents an opportunity to
establish our initial presence in South America and demonstrates that our
strategic initiative to increase Derived Channel penetration, particularly in
new markets, is
beginning to yield dividends. I am looking forward with enthusiasm to working
with Telemonitoreo to bring the benefits of Derived Channel to Argentina."

NumereX designs, manufactures and markets its proprietary derived channel
system which enables the transmission of data over existing telephone lines to
perform
alarm reporting and other monitoring functions without interfering with regular
voice communications. The Company's Derived Channel products include network
equipment traditionally sold to telephone companies and related subscriber
terminal units sold to alarm system distributors and installers for use at
protected
premises. In addition, the Company offers a line of intrusion alarm products
and network management systems. SOURCE NumereX Corp.

Cash flow 1.18 (Price 20X Cash Flow)

Now that the subject has been broached, how does one figure an

you're up 40-50% in a few months? Does
rate of rise of stock price figure into it? Are there value
parameters you can watch for a sell signal? Do you only allow

Well, I have some personal knowledge to share about Candela, since

I've seen and heard from fellow physicians, the Candela products are something
of a revolution in the field of dermatologic surgery.
The cosmetic uses should cushion Candela from all the cost-cutting
going on in medicine. Dermatology in general is actually doing quite well.
People are more willing to pay out of pocket to cure
diseases on their outsides. In general, I stay away from medical companies
because my macro view of medicine is that it is a shrinking market. However,
Candela is a good pick! Thanks Bob!

Hi Raimondas,

****Warning -- this is not necessarily a value post. It might be of
interest to someone looking at valuing health care companies.****

You are correct. The elderly will need more care, but the question
is how much will medical providers (physicians as well as medical
device companies) be able to charge? There is a shrinking pie
of dollars for health care -- we peaked (and set off alarms) at
14% of GDP. Physicians are forming unions for a reason -- there
is a mad scramble within healthcare for crumbs from this shrinking
pie. Insurers, competing for care, are cutting premiums they
charge employers, and passing that on in reduced payments to hospitals
and physicians. The capitated environment (pre-paid) health care
also is working to drastically cut expenditures.

Companies that purport to make money by helping cut costs are
in effect limited by their own purpose. This includes HMO's, Physician
Management entities (Phycor,etc.), etc. They can grow by
expanding but there is no room for internal growth. I have the
same problem with restaurant stocks. The HMO industry, of course,
is in its M&A phase right now, which is the fourth of five stages of
industry maturity. I'd almost rather risk my money at a casino.

I envision a health market where physicians are well-paid (80-100K/yr)
but not overpaid like they have been. I also envision that investments in
capital equipment will be severely cut back. No longer
will a hospital, flush with cash, spend millions on a new technology
just so it can be like the hospital across the street. It simply
won't have the cash. Many hospitals are right now trying to figure
out how they can return to profitability after suffering recent
losses in the restructuring of health care. It is hard to emphasize
how turned on its head medicine is, compared to even 5 years ago.

A few trends can flourish, and Bob Davis' suggestion -- the Candela
laser --is one. Specialty products and services that appeal to
vanity (and hence draw the more lucrative, out-of-pocket paying
crowd) can do well, especially with aging baby boomers. Also, personal care
products that appeal to elderly people appear to be good investments. But that
industry is dominated by conglomerates and blue chips with insane valuations,
in my opinion.

The pharmaceuticals deserve a strong look, but one cannot go solely
on traditional valuation, because they too are dealing with a different market.
Hospitals and health plans now have formularies,
from which participating doctors can prescribe drugs. The pharmaceuticals now
have to compete openly and on price (more
than anything else) in trying to win a space on these formularies.
Nothing prevents the health plan from changing the formulary the
second something cheaper comes along. It is hard for anyone to know
how successful a drug is going to be, as well. Analysts predicting
a 1 Billion market for this or that drug are wrong more often than
not. These guys aren't practicing M.D.'s by any means. Doctors
are odd birds, and it is harder to get in their heads than one thinks.

I personally feel one can profit on the new health care environment
with appropriately placed shorts much more easily than picking
potential steadily growing companies.

Of course, I must qualify this. Obviously people are hardest on
the companies in their own industry. I'm no different.

Jeff and the thread,

Would like your software industry insight into a couple stocks:

Applix (APLX): 7 1/2, $2.70 cash, $4.70 Sales, Current 2.4, $3 book.
Looking at their last report, they had 40% profit and 50% revenue
growth before non-recurring charges. Stock has gotten killed --
all the way down from the 40s. PE around 8 if you don't count
the charges, which are acquisition related. No debt. Really unusual
volume yesterday.

Premenos (PRMO): 6 1/2, $6.08 book, $5.12 cash, $3.04 Sales, D/E
negligible, current 6.55. Looks like one can pick this company up
for almost pennies net of cash. Just recently bounced off book, but
has in general gotten killed down from the 40s. Estimates are around
20c/sh for 97 and 30c/sh for 98. At around $1.5 bucks net of
cash, the company sits at a PE of ~7.5X 97est.

I am still looking into medical companies, but it is really hard,
even if one is in the medical field. Every time I investigate a
home-grown lead, I find the stock has already been bid up. In
fact, Bob Davis' suggestion, Candela, is about the best I have come
up with. I am also looking at a company, Resmed (RESM), which makes a
more cost-effective sleep apnea treatment that is really the
standard of care now. But with a PE of 20 and at 4-5X book and
sales, it's hard to justify. Also, it's got a buck spread on an
18 dollar stock.

Premenos Technology (PRMO) Price 5 7/8 by 6 last I saw.

As of Dec 31, 1996:

Cash/Share = $56.482M/11.829M shs = $4.77 Cash/share
Annual Sales = $3.06/share vs. $2.84/share in 95
Quarterly sales = $0.93/share vs. $0.74/share in 4Q 95 (+25.7%)
EPS Annual -- not analyzed due to non-recurring charges
EPS Quarterly = $.05/sh vs. $.13/sh (-62%) due to increased
SGA expense

Operating earnings were -$69,000, but additional income (probably
interest income kicked the final earnings up to $.05/sh.
Long Term Debt is $0.17/share
Current Ratio is 69.948M/12.361M=5.66

At 6 ask, the enterprise/sales ratio=(6-4.77 cash)/3.06 sales= 0.40.
The Enterprise/97 earnings (~20) is 6.65.

Latest estimates from Wheat First and First Albany are .18-.22/sh
for 97, and around .30/sh in 98.

Assuming avg 50M in cash througout 97, with only a 5% return on that
sum, we get .20/sh in interest earnings. The 97 estimates basically
assume no operating earnings, which is what we got 4Q 96.

The Enterprise/97 earnings (~.20) is 6.65.

News:
Only news release this quarter was 3/24-- release of Templar 2.1.
Nov 18 Barrons: Chip Morris of TRP Sci & Tech promoted Premenos as
a buy (then at 8 7/8) because "financial services will be one of
the earliest commerce applications on the internet.""

Summary: If the company is going to be operating earnings neutral, then this 6
is fair to overpriced. If the company experiences any growth whatsoever in its
product lines (which it has -- but offset by SGA expense) over and above SGA,
then the shares become a buy at 6.

From a pure value analysis standpoint, it fell to 5.25 today, only
48 cents above cash. Your analysis appears right on. Its stock
is acting as if there is no business to it. However, some big
institutions stepped in at 5.25 with 100,000+ share buys, suggesting
a floor for the enterprise value at around .50. For a company
that really will only have a few pennies a share in losses this quarter.
They're buying back shares, too. Thank you for your input.

Return on Equity, aka Return on Common Shareholder's Equity is :

Net profit after tax/stockholder's equity

Don't forget to calculate this using the end of the year profit
and the beginning of the year equity. If you use the end of the
year equity, the figure will not be accurate.

It is a measure that is most useful in comparing companies in
the same industry, as the mean ROE across industries varies
greatly. It is not useful to compare the ROE on your steel stock
to the ROE on your software stock.

A similar ratio that is very commonly used is the Return on Assets,
aka the Return on Capital. This is:

Net End of Year Profit after tax
---------------------------------------------------------------
Total Capitalization (=LT debt plus equity)at beginning of year

You can see that the Return on Equity is a distilled version of the
Return on Capital. This makes sense since all debt originates from
a healthy amount of equity in the first place. You can use the
average total capitalization over the year if you'd like, or the
average shareholders equity over the year if you like.

Both of these ratios should be looked at in comparing companies
within an industry. In general, the higher the more efficient the
company is at producing profits, which implies fastest growth and
ablest management at making strategic investments that work. It
also means the best ability to generate cash for even more investment,
which will likely be good investment as the management has proven
itself adept at such choices.

You can see that some of us really like these ratios and use them
a lot, as they give a lot of information on a company. These two ratios belong
to a group of "profitability ratios" that includes
pretax profit margin (pretax profit/sales), net profit margin (aftertax return
on sales). They generally do not tell you much
about the company's balance sheet and financial condition. I
recommend the book, Why Stocks Go Up (and Down) for a good intro
to this stuff. It's by William H. Pike and is essentially the
text of the introductory investment course that he has taught at the
Boston Security Analyst's Society for 15 years.

You can get the figures for computing all ratios from the balance
sheets and income statements. Never trust another's figure -- always
work it out yourself.

The proliferation of these programs (which use data that ignores

Ford creamed estimates by reporting EPS of 1.20 vs estimates

How should this figure, I wonder? One may say this cyclical
is obviously near the top of its cycle (hence the high
earnings and low PE), but with the economy
picking up steam, Big Three car quality surpassing
import quality for the first time in decades, and this
performance in the face of a strong dollar, can it be
that this cycle has some legs left? The high and stable yield
would imply a limited downside, especially with the stocks

Value investing is different things to
different people. This sounds like a variation
of the theory behind the Dogs of the Dow.

The reasoning sounds familiar -- if the dividend
is high, the stock must be unreasonably depressed.

If you continually invest in stocks that offer
secure dividends that beat a benchmark rate
such as the 1 year T-bill,it stands to reason
you'd do well and that you'd be picking
depressed "value" stocks with better than average
downside risk. So why not call it value investing?

Dividends are taxed twice however.
This double taxation was not the case
back when Graham and Dodd and
Buffett and Kahn and etc. were starting
out. Convertibles,
and in general capital equities, have
flourished to evade this double
taxation. So have buybacks.

An argument can be made for simply
buying back stock. In fact, this is what
a lot of companies are doing.
One would not expect this to be
a phenomenon of a bull market -- would
companies turn to buybacks when their
stocks are inflated?

Graham really felt dividends were
a must, because they represented
management's awareness of the company's
responsibility to the individual
investor as well as an immediate
cash return. This is an understandable
position but if one is looking for
total return, one could also look
to avoid the double taxation and
go for the buyback.

Does anyone have the power to
screen for substantial dividend
paying companies in the
midst of a buyback? Wells Fargo,
Coke and other well known
stocks fitting this category
have done very well. I wonder
if there are any bargains left
in the group. (I'm short
AXP, WFC, and KO, so I certainly
don't feel these are bargains

Dipy,

Precisely why I wish to evaluate companies
in the midst of proven buybacks. Small
marginal companies have taken to using
buyback announcements as a publicity
stunt to support their stock. More often
than not, the buybacks do not materialize.
When they do, they end up not retiring
the stock and placing it in the
corporate treasury, which is of marginal
use to shareholders. Everyone should
be aware of this trick, as you point
out.

Hi James,
<< There have got to be safer shorts out there than KO>>

Yeah, Gilette. I'm expecting a Nifty Fifty swoon as indexing proves a Ponzi
scheme at the slightest sustained barrage of fund outflows.
I imagine apoplectic fund managers desperately and ineffectively
trying to raise cash to cover even more expected outflows. They
got into the Nifty Fifty because of liquidity, and that's where
they'll look when they need cash as well.

The S&P is overvalued historically and logically,So I'm targeting Nifty Fifty
stocks.

1/S&P PE = 1/22 = .045 <<< .074 = Corp AAA bonds.

KO is more so. KO's cash flow multiple is 33.92, and the free cash flow
multiple is 123.98, compared to the S&P's 13.7 and 36. Div is~1%
v. S&P's 2.27. PSR is 7.26 v S&P's 2.36. KO's Net Working Capital is a NEGATIVE
$1.5 billion and its current ratio is around .8 (not that
I think KO's going under). These values are more rich than the non-EtOH bev
industry as well. KO makes the S&P look cheap, which it's not given the
interest rate scenario.

The return on equity of ~60% (indusry's is 46)is the reason Buffett's in it,
though, and who am I to argue. My targets to cover are 40,46 and 48, depending
on the market and other opportunities for
the funds.

While I consider myself a value investor, and am moving more to that realm with
every book I read, I still use TA for entry decisions on both shorts and longs.
Exits and decisions to go long or short
are value-based.

Most N50 stocks are making the second or third lower high in a sawtoothed
downturn as well as hitting 50dMA overhead resistance. This week is actually a
pretty critical point for the market technically. If they move up from here
they've severed this downtrend-- good for the market and I cover and my longs
benefit. If not, I'm ready with the shorts.

I mentioned that I pick stocks to short
based on valuation, not ratios (I ask you to find
the correct free cash flow -- I bet most
people don't kow they're working with
negative net working capital, either).
But I ENTER based on technical analysis.
KO could go up or down. The odds are down,
technically, but that's what buy stops
are for. This isn't a long term short by
any means. Research on shorts show that
profitable shorts make money with small
gains, not by waiting for businesses
to bankrupt. The small gains are usually
there for the picking. Another indicator --
if it's mentioned in Barron's as a buy
three different times <g> -- set me onto
Wells Fargo.

What's there to understand about Coke? The
business is a KISS model. This gets
to my value/short strategy. When
people start claiming a business deserves
a special valuation above all reasonable
fundamental analysis (because
of the "franchise", because there's so
little institutional ownership for
a big cap growth stock, because Buffett's
in it, because global expansion will
provide endless opportunity, because
ROE is so damned high, because it's
nearly a monopoly, because Buffett's
in it...), that's a short, IMO.

I just read a bunch of Graham, and he doesn't
deal with shorts (I assume it would
be "speculation"), but EMT isn't all
that its panned to be either, IMO.

A word on cash flows:

<< I think your free cash flow ratio is wrong, and that is the key to this
stock's valuation. Check that ratio (123x doesn't sound anywhere close - the
dividend yield alone is 1% plus a mammoth share buyback. Its high, but its not
123 times)>>

Cash Flow typically refers to operating cash flow.
Free Cash Flow refers to Operating CF + other net cash flows (Investing CF +
Financing CF + exchange rate effect)

In Coke's case,

Operating CF $3.5 B
+ Investing CF ($1 B)
+ Financing CF ($2.1 B) -- this includes 1.4 B in stock purchases
+ ER effect ($ 45M)

gives Coke's FCF of $ 266 million. So, in the presence of
a huge cash buyback program, one might be better off
looking at the operating cash flow (though one should
analyze every aspect of the Cash flow). In
a company whose outstanding shares keep increasing, we'd
want to look at the investing cash flow to make sure
the Free Cash Flow isn't being overly inflated by
either the selling of shares or other investment activities not
related to the company's operating status.

This is a Buffett company, no doubt. High return on
equity, and it is plowing its cash flows right
back to the shareholder in the form of a steady
buyback. It hedges its overseas operations to maintain
a fairly stable Exchange effect. This thing is
fine-tuned, well-run. What we should look for in
a company as value investors.

A word on ratios and figures.

Graham popularized the "intrinsic value" concept, even
gave it an equation:

IV = Trailing EPS (2 X est growth rate + 8.5) X (4.4/AAA Bond rate)

Where 8.5 is the P/E he assigned to a stock that has zero growth.
In today's market, maybe that's a bit higher.

Few use this today, and Buffett never took to it or any
formulas really.

IMO, this is a useful adjunct, though, because it addresses
the P/E issue in a methodical and unemotional way, and is
logical at its heart.

Other things Graham and other value investors look(ed) for:

Share price < 2/3 of Net working capital
Current Ratio > 2 (I like > 3 myself)
Quick Ratio >1
Debt/Equity < 50%
Liquid Value of Assets
Sales growth > 10% annually (read: 7-10 year avg),
NI > 15% of sales
ROE > 20%
EPS growth > 7.5% annually
CEO owns > 20%
Proper use of cash flows -- either dividends or buybacks are best
Peter Lynch: "Buying back shares is the simplest and best way
a company can reward its investors."
Steady dividend payment for 10-20 years without suspension and
growing at rate of EPS
Return on Capital --(Net Income + Int Expense)/Mark Cap-- 12-25%
Too high ROC "attracts competition, and, generally speaking,
it is not lkely too continue indefinitely," says Graham.
IV = or > than stock price

To assess the market conditions, one may want to use
this formula, although I have no idea as to its validity:

If 1/S&P PE < AAA rated bond yields, start reallocating
to cash/bond equivalents, always staying at least 25% in equities.

These ratios largely reflect the quantitative aspect of a stock.
These are not meant to be rules, but rather a base of knowledge
to use to evaluate various aspects of the company. Graham did
set down some rules later in his life.

Buffett, esp. starting with AMEX I believe, modified his methods
to include qualitative aspects. Other than recognizing
blatant monopoly situations, most of us cannot evaluate management
well up close and personal like Buffett.

So we can rely on ROE, ROC, dividends/buybacks,CEO ownership
to reflect on management to an extent. Inconsistencies such
as unfulfilled buyback promises, frequent number restatements,
insider dumping before bad PR, etc. can also be used. I just
dumped a stock that didn't fulfill a buyback promise.

Just IMO,

Thanks for the correction. I meant to be more emphatic that
what I presented didn't make sense if one was looking
for an accurate representation of the business's health.

MarketGuide calculates Free cash flow differently, resulting
in a number that is much lower. I had thought they were including
Financing cash flows, but now that I've used a calculator, they
are not. I am not sure how they calculated it, but their number
comes up on my end-of-day service as well.

Since I believe MarketGuide sells fundamental data to screening programs, I
wonder how much of the FCF figures out there in investing resources and
screening tools are calculated differently? Is this another
reason to be wary of screening figures?

At the very least, it's a reason to analyze the cash flows
breakdown.

Re: KO, they paid out 1.25B in dividends and 1.4B in buybacks
in 96, offset by 542M in new borrowing. In KO's case,
FCF does not equal Dividends + Share buybacks, but rather
KO holds onto a little over 300M. In any case, these are
actually peanuts given Coke's current market cap.

Free Cash Flow Defined by William Pike, author of Why
Stocks Go Up (and Down):

Free cash flow is the cash flow from operations that the
company is free to spend on whatever it wants after it
has met its basic survival needs of debt repayment,
maintenance-level capital expenditures, and POSSIBLY
preferred dividends.

Some investors or financial services might define free cash
flow SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY, perhaps not deducting preferred
dividends because failure to pay the preferred dividend cannot
cause the company to be declared bankrupt; or perhaps excluding
maintenance-level capital spending, because it is not a
contractual obligation like debt repayment; or perhaps
including or excluding some other minor items. But
the concept of ree cash flow -- cash that can be
used at the management's discretion after all requirements
have been met-- should be clear.

Uses of free cash flow include : increase capital spending,
dividends, repurchase company bonds/pay debt, hoard cash,
repurchase the company's outstanding preferred or common
stock.

*******************************

I'm an MD, not an MBA. I learned what I know from books.
This book is one of them. Hence, this is the definition
of free cash flow I go by. Notice that stock buybacks
and dividends are uses of free cash flow, but not
equivalent to free cash flow according to this
definition. Your definition you learned in
business school is evidently different. The one
in this book looks like the one MarketGuide uses,
which is what many professional investors use.
Your definition makes sense, but it's just not what
I learned. Sorry for the confusion.

J.P. Morgan analyst Daniel Kuntsler reduced his rating to market perform from
buy, citing lower-than-expected third quarter earnings.
Kuntsler called the earnings "a crushing setback on the road to recovery of the
company"s earnings power."

Salomon Brothers analyst John Jones downgraded Silicon Graphics Inc to hold
from buy. He cited SGI"s lower than expected third quarter earnings, and noted,
"This is the fourth consecutive major shortfall by SGI in the last year." FY 97
ests cut from 1.04 to .47.
FY 98 cut from 1.98 to 1.10. 4Q 97 .60 --> .30.

Soundview kept Long and Short term holds. Cut FY 97 from 85 to .49.
Cut FY 98 to 1.43 from 1.53.

*********************

My thoughts:

They're keeping costs and R&D steady. The earnings fluctuations
seem to be a function of revenues. The tiny margins and ROE
seem to me to deserve a low PSR. What do you think? How will
they increase their margins?

One other issue. SGI doesn't have the "planned obsolence"
going for it. I mean, once you've invested a huge amount of capital in the high
end workstations, do you really NEED to upgrade, ever?

How is its market expanding? It's already 50% overseas, and
without a planned obsolence or new uses for the products,
how will they expand revenues?

Looking forward to your analysis,

Mike

Hi Reginald,

Congratulations on the time and thought you've put into this, but I think that
it is indeed more simple than something needing software for a lot of us here,
at least.

Most sophisticated investors already break down expenses. We already know what
increased R&D means, what increased SGA means, etc. We can see if a company is
manipulating earnings by looking at past P/L statements. No software needed.
Ditto for balance sheets and financial condition. Ditto again for trusting
analysts -- we know they aren't disseminating their opinions for our health. We
also already
look at cash flows and how they are used.

Your model seems like it would work well for stable growth stocks,
if there is such a thing. But where is the Margin of Safety should the business
falter? How is the risk aspect assessed?

Good investing,
Mike

All,

Re: WHX Corp from earlier on the thread ($16/sh in cash, union
strike with complete work stoppage, etc.)

This co. is undergoing an amazing barrage of bad news and stands at
6 1/2:
http://biz.yahoo.com/news/whx.html
Note S&P's comments on their credit on 3/31.

WHX is approaching a criterion that Graham used during the Depression -- 2/3 X
the net nets value per share. This strategy
made him famous, although he used a diversified approach, not just a few
stocks.

Net Nets = [(CA-CL-LTD)/Shares Out] is now at 9.20/sh, making the ratio P/NN =
2/3. As one observer pointed out "if there is
one rule that exemplifies Graham this is it." In my experience,
the satisfaction of this guideline is extremely rare these days.

Net working capital is 20 1/4, satisfying the Price < 2/3 NWK rule.
Quick ratio is 2.10, assuming 229M in inventory. Graham wanted >1.
I'm estimating minimum Net Liquidation Value at 10 1/4.

It's getting awfully cheap, and it is worth noting that the institutions have
been buying -- over 1 1/2 M shares net this past 3 mos.

This is a very profitable company when the employees are working.
They have been trying to sell or shut down plants ,and have made
a bid for Dynamics Corp of America with its extra cash. Management
is bent on doing what's right by the company, in my view, even
if it means getting out of the steel business and away from the
union. Standard & Poor's seems to indicate that if management accepts
the union demands, the credit rating will fall. The PSR here is
under .2 for the last 4 quarters the company was running.

An update: Premiere Radio Networks, which was growing at 30% yet
selling below book when it was brought up on this thread at around
11 is being bought out for $18/share, or about 1.3X book. Rupert
Murdoch and Milken were large shareholders in this one. Just
a validation that sometimes good things do happen to value investors,
even in today's market.

Reginald,

How to find misleading profit loss statements: there
are as many ways to find these as there are ways to mislead,
several avenues to key in on are accounts receivable trends in the balance
sheet, inventory trends, changes in the structure of expenses (incl. R&D, SGA)
over time, changes in sources and uses of cash flow/income, and management's
statements in relation to the
p/l statement (thank God for on-line Edgar!).

A lot of it starts with knowing the manner in which
the company realizes revenue and knowing the nature of the company's
business.

Margin of Safety: a central concept of value investing
as practiced by Buffett, Graham, Klarman, and others
with long term success. This relates to the extent
an abundance of value exists in the share price, i.e.
what cushion exists against error that minimizes the
downside risk over time? Graham states "the MOS resides
in the discount at which the stock is selling below its
minimum intrinsic value." Intrinsic value is calculated
in different ways by different people.

When I talk about risk, I am talking about the risk
in the purchase of shares, not the credit risk in the the
company. Graham long ago pointed out that in assessing
the company's financial health, one can use its bond
ratings as an adjunctive guide, as you suggest. However,
this does not describe the risk in establishing a long
position in the shares, which is independent of the
the credit risk in and of the company. The level of this
investment risk is key to value investors.

Thank you for bringing your model to our attention.
Several of us will surely find it useful. Good luck.

You value MSFT at $522, and INTC at >$200. Have you been

would find attractive, no? The more I think about it,

Come now, both institutions and analysts have been in love with INTC and MSFT.
Besides, the last two years mean little in this bull market. Darts do well.

To achieve a Margin of Safety you must:
1) Buy when the overall market is low and there are many
undervalued issues
2) Look for companies under temporary stress
3) Search for overlooked stocks even when the market is not
particularly undervalued (Janet Lowe, Value Investing)

I don't want to get into a tit for tat. By acknowledging
that you are one of those that doesn't believe in growth
models, you leave yourself open to the criticism that this
is indeed a growth model from those of us that do believe
they exist.

In sum, it is hard to throw out Buffett and Graham and Klarman and other proven
value investors in favor of any model.

Hi Jim,

I agree with everything you just said, esp re: Intel
and MSFT. Re: the net-net, it is certainly interesting, isn't it? I believe
Graham bought a huge basket (100's) of them. Additionally, the market was
depressed so a higher percentage of the NN's
were just misunderstood. In this market, a net-net would carry more risk, I
would think, because it is less likely to be overlooked and more likely to be
really in trouble. Also, I can't find hundreds to
diversify and lessen my risk. But it's a situation I would
watch. When this same company came out of bankruptcy in 1991,
it rocketed 10-fold.

Another value play that's a net-net as well(no union this time):

China Resources Development Corp (CHRB on NASDAQ SmCap)

Market Cap $17M, Sales $220M
PSR 0.03, PE 3
Just reported NI up 87% for year to $4.3M
Up to 3.5 from 1.75 on March 24
ROE 31%, ZERO LT debt
84% insider ownership
3 yr Sales Growth has been 17% annually
3 yr Earnings Growth has been 9% annually
Sells at 50% discount to Net Working Capital
Since no long term debt, this is a NET NET ratio of 0.5!

A special net net since it is profitable with a 30% ROE
and growing.

Seems to be in a market that is growing quickly -- China's Ag

Risks include its business is all China (though its a US corporation), among
others. Currency risk. Also, the price has doubled in the last 4 weeks, so may
be in for a short term retracement of some significance.
The management made a smart call re: the rubber industry this

because they own so much of it).

This is just about the leading high tech VAR/wholesaler with well developed
international, educational, government, and other inroads well-developed. It
has authority from IBM to assemble IBM's

A good company, no doubt about it, selling at 23 1/2 per share.

Selling at less than 2/3 its net working capital.
Selling just under its Net Net. Price/Book is 0.71.
PSR 0.05 (MCap 612M, Sales 12B) owing to its low margins, but
ROE is a healthy 21%.
For such a large company, insiders still own 10%.
3 yr sales growth is 43%. 3 year EPS growth is 29%.
PE is 27, but this does not reflect the value here.
LT Debt/Equity is only 0.33, about the industry average.
Management is determined, with good public relations staff.
Price/Book is 0.71, with Operating Cash Flow of $3/share.

Reginald,

Actually, I'd rather move on than go over it tick by tick. One of my degrees is
economics and I do understand what you are talking about, and I agree it is
logical, and may indeed be viable over the long term. I just don't see the
Margin of Safety built into the prices of those stocks you selected to
demonstrate your model. Not that I think this is wrong by any means-- I'm
certainly not one to say this or that approach is wrong.

As you say, I agree that "high-ranking" investors lurk here, since I get e-mail
from them every so often. However, I don't get the feeling that their positions
necessarily mean they are any more sophisticated than Jeff, Paul, Scott, and
several others on this thread. Admittedly, I'm a hack, but whether someone is
willing to lay out $10,000 for a software program that tells them a stock is
overvalued or not certainly doesn't validate the program for me.

Good luck.

Reginald,

You appear to be arguing that junk bonds and technology equity
investments have more value because they have been yielding higher returns over
the last 7-10 years, thus counterbalancing the risk
to a sufficient degree to call these value plays. This is the logic of a growth
investor. What if you buy junk bonds just before the next crisis? Or if you buy
A junk bond and the company deteriorates or is cannibalized by the people that
sold it to you? You'll be sitting on a big fat capital loss. This risk is high,
hence the name.

How about the Nifty Fifty and the 72-74 crash? Good companies that
didn't see a return to their previous levels for over 10 years.
In the inflationary environment of the mid 70's to early 80's this
was devastating for holders of these growth stocks (which had
been deemed "safe" due to their previous returns during the 60's bull and
size/history).

This is why we use AAA corporate bonds and gov't securities as benchmarks for a
safe return. Hold until maturity and you
are guaranteed (as best as can be expected -- if you don't trust
the gov't, check out AAA bonds oneself) at least a modicrum of insurance
against inflation. I am not arguing that your model
doesn't do this implicitly.

In sum, if you buy at the top, where's the value? This is what Margin of Safety
is meant to address, and why many people distinguish value investing from
growth investing.

Mike

P.S. Diminishing returns have been debunked because of industry
paradigm shifts? That's not what UCLA taught me about paradigm
shifts and economics. Milken made his money by investing in junk bonds? My
understanding is he structured and sold them fraudulently and ruthlessly. Even
initially, his expertise was structuring, not investing in them.

Thread,

I apologize for my hotheadedness recently. My thoughts:

As we know, there is a certain type of value investing born out of the
Depression and modified by others that subscribes to the safety of capital
above all else. Hence, the term "margin of safety" as it
has been popularized in value circles and on this thread. While most investors
say they seek value, they do not all seek value in this vein.

We also know the analysts, institutions, and most money managers
describe value differently, adjusted for future growth/discounted
future cash flows. As we know, the further in the future, the
more optimistic becomes the conjecture that goes into these models.

A model that values MSFT at 525 at these market valuations seems to fit in this
latter category. I do not find the margin of safety
as I understand it. I do not find a floor. What did this model value Citrix at
the day before MSFT's announcement cut it in half?
Or 3Com late last year, before Intel's announcements.

I did not start this thread as a growth stock thread. If we
want to know what the most sophisticated growth models output,
we can look at the price targets put out by the analysts.

Value investing that seeks a floor and a margin of safety is
hard, and doesn't fit into models easily. Even Graham dismissed
his own intrinsic value formula, saying it lies somewhere
between net assets and the calculated intrinsic value.

Do value investors really subscribe to the belief that Wall Street knows
better? I sure don't. IMO, there is a limit to what books
can teach you, but unlike a lot of professions, you can jump right
into hands-on experience with investing.

I can describe a fracture in so much funny orthopedic terminology
that "laypeople" wouldn't know if I was talking about my last vacation
or not. But it doesn't change the fact that he/she would know exactly
which way it is angled and whether it broke the skin and how
many pieces there were, etc. If I've learned anything from medicine,
it's that the terminology is as much to create the professional aura
as it is practical. Every MBA and JD friend of mine says the same
thing.

Professionals welcome, but let's try to keep in line with the
goal of the thread, which doesn't start with stratospheric
base values of the most popular stocks on the market and then call
it safe or a value.

I definitely don't like that they are

Found two pearls from Buffett relevant to
the recent discussions here:

Re: Margin of Safety, he said, "There is
simply no precision to the process---and if
you think so you are kidding yourself. There
should be such a margin of safety that you
don't need to carry it out to three decimal
places."

Re: Intrinsic value, he said, "Intrinsic
value is importantly influenced by what you
do with captital over time. Intrinsic value
is more than simply adding up the pieces at
the time.

A related quote from Charles Brandes,"A
value standpoint requires that the investor
pay only for what is seen, not what is hoped."

These are from Janet Lowe's 1996 book on
value investing.

What do people here feel is the best measure
in today's numbers of management's ability
to invest capital wisely in the future?

Return on Capital? ROE? Growth? Use of
Cash flows? What else and why? Are there
minimums or maximums you like to use in
this endeavor?

Re: medical value, update, and another valuation model

Quite a while ago I was asked what medical stocks I liked
on a value basis. I posted I didn't really like any, but
it would have to be one that provides a product or a
health service (not management or insurance) and that it
would have to somehow stay above the fray of managed care,
perhaps a cosmetic application. All while keeping its
value ratios in line with an undervalued stock.

Bob Davis, who distributes the excellent Napeague Letter,
brought up Candela Corporation (CLZR) as the focus of one of
the NL issues. This company produces the candela laser,
cryo-techniques, and is starting up a day-spa concept
for outpatient cosmetic surgery and health rejuvenation using
its minimally invasive techniques. This appeals to the
wealthier among us and is therefore not as affected by
the managed care belt-tightening.

After evaluating it for several months, today I purchased
it at 6. This company looks like a good value
for its industry, with strong management, cash flows, and below the industry
averages in just about all valuation areas. It has good market makers and a 30%
institutional ownership.

Update on Numerex (NMRX): the company has bought back 470,000 of its
11M shares and yesterday it announced it is extending its
buyback based on its perception the shares remain extremely
undervalued. This is a turnaround play that was brought up
very early on the thread. Disclaimer -- I also purchased
this one today.

A study came out on shorting late last

plays because they move irrationally
and fast. Look for companies with immense
debt, crummy balance sheets and declining sales.
And then hold for a while. This is just so against
my nature, if not all human nature.

I screened for negative sales growth plus
LT Debt>>equity, and PSR>20. The screen
works, in a sense -- you get all kinds
of companies trading for less than a buck,
and a lot of low cap oil&gas explorers.
Nothing marginable, so hence they
are not shortable. If you leave out
the balance sheet problems you get
a bunch of development stage cos,

on the right track. I'll keep trying.

As long as you put tight stops on the
shorts, there's no unlimited risk. Problem
is, how much do you believe the stock
will go down? I'm only aiming for 10% in
a bull market (which usually happens either quickly

I believe there's no time limit on shorts, but you can
only short marginable stocks (right
off the bat many of the best shorts
are unavailable to you). Also, if insufficient
investors hold the stock on the margin
side of their account, then there may
be a short squeeze, in which you
are forced to buy the stock back
whether you want to or not. There
are other ways to squeeze shorts as well.
If the stock has a lot of outstanding
short interest (which a lot of the
marginable but shaky companies do),
then good news can send us all
scrambling to cover, causing a
gap up or a large loss in a small
period of time.

I don't feel it is unreasonable that
value investors could short. Given
the latest study, they may even be the
best at it.

If I come up with an interesting prospect
or a good screen, I'll post it here.
In the meantime, does anyone remember

"It suggests the market did not fully repair the damage

Re: stops and shorting

Effectively, you need to use technical
analysis. My shorts, though fewer
in number by far, have been more successful
than my longs -- what that says about me
I don't know. Alternatively, you could
just use percentages, but to me that's
a shot in the dark. Or if you know the
company intimately, you could just wait
because you know it's going down.

Using TA, you can find, say, when a company
is bumping up agains some significant
overhead resistance, hitting a trend
channel boundary, or hitting
a Fibonacci number on a retracement during
a downtrend. There are lots of other
examples. Then, you just set a mental
stop to get out if the scenario doesn't
play out technically. My futures experience
led me to study TA intensely. I can't
help but use it for position entry in
stocks.

To answer someone's question, shorts do
not free up cash. They are always borrowed
(you are shorting stock that your brokerage
borrowed for you from another investors
margin account), and hence in your margin account.
But it's not like you can keep 100% shorts
and then still have 100% cash to play with.

BUT this is TA. Stops are not a part
of value investing as I understand it.
Hence my search for a value-based strategy.
Shorts take a lot of maintenance as I
practice it.

I may have found something, and am currently

I second (or third or...) your thoughts.

Beta (the covariance of a stock's price movement

of risk is derived from the Efficient Market Hypothesis
(though it existed long before EMT, IMU),
which is something that value investors typically shun.
Buffett said something like "if markets were efficient

Boy, that is huge (1347 to be exact). Narrowed down to
the Software, Networking, and Semi/Semi equip industries
(which may include former and recent highflyers),
and corrected for financial strength with Market Cap > 40M,
Current Ratios>2 and LT Debt/Equity < 50%, you get

Artisoft (Software, ASFT) .99

Farallon Comm (Networks, FRLN) .89
GTI (Networks, GGTI) .66

Integrated Silicon (Semi, ISSI) .94
NetManage (Software, NETM) .89
OPTi (Semi, OPTI) .68
Premenos (Software, PRMO) .97
Sparton (Semi, SPA) .81

If you add ROE > 10%, you get even fewer.

Gottfried,

Certainly is. There are major flaws in the
model which are pretty obvious.

It is interesting, and there is
science behind it. But it ignores
cyclicals (GM), its costs of capital
are debatable, and it relies heavily
on projected earnings, among other
things.

Also, like all models based on
projection, the projections tend
to be optimistic and don't allow
for adverse news/new competition.

Good luck,

RESTATEMENT OF PURPOSE FOR THE VALUE INVESTING THREAD

This thread is about value investing "in the Graham tradition."

A "Margin of Safety" as Graham and Buffett and other well-known
value investors (Klarman, Kahn, etc.) define
it should be incorporated to some extent into approaches
and ideas posted here. Net asset plays, overlooked stocks, stocks under
temporary stress, a bear market/correction all create opportunities with a
margin of safety.

Keeping this key concept in mind, please feel free to propose approaches and
investment ideas on which the thread may comment. Questions of all kinds are
especially welcome, because if you have a question, it's likely many of us do
too.

In general the goal will be to present ideas, get feedback,
and move on. Updates on specific ideas at future dates are
most welcome and help us all keep perspective. But 10-20
posts should be the maximum for any but the most extraordinary
of subjects. Such volume indicates the subject is interesting and
especially deserving of its own thread.

Alternatives for greater discussion of particularly
controversial topics are e-mail and a new thread.

This thread, however, should focus on "traditional" value
investing based on a margin of safety in the stock price.

If you do not understand what I mean by "margin of safety,"
please e-mail me. Those that understand this concept
or want to understand it better, please continue to contribute.

Neo-value investing approaches that make extensive
use of projections into the future may be better served
by a new thread devoted entirely to them.

I apologize for the interruption, but it was never my
goal for this to become one of SI's most posted-to threads.
My own offenses are very much recognized and I will
limit myself in the future.

Good investing,

Yes, I meant that cyclicality is not incorporated into the

Hi Christian,

From a certain standpoint Hutchinson appears
appealing. It seems unfairly punished
amid a misunderstanding of its news that
it is behind in its capacity expansion plans.
Profits look good and it has 12 major
contracts in hand. Given the down tech
market and this temporary stress, there
might be a certain margin of safety in
the shares. For many investors, this
is a buying opportunity. And in my gut
I feel it will rise again.

On a valuation basis, however, I tend to
agree with Paul. Its ratios mostly approximate
the industry averages, with no special
value-based floor. While the PSR is getting low
for the industry (especially in light of the
good news on its margins),the future success of the
stock seems very dependent on it proving
future profit growth. While this seems
very likely, a srict interpretation may
call it speculation, IMO.

no argument it is cheap

Re: accounting, analysts, talking to management

Paul, thank you for your efforts. The issue of
accounting intrigues me. A lot of stocks (e.g.
AOL, PSFT, etc.) got pushed up thanks to aggressive
accounting practices (capitalizing software R&D and/or
marketing costs). Trying to please Wall Street and
the analysts. And they were pleased. How stupid are
these analysts anyway?

They seem to have the one-time charge concept
understood, as well as the "dump-the-stock-if-
inventory-or-A/R-grows-faster-than-sales" concept.
But how can they be fooled by aggressive accounting?
They ignore it because the stock is moving up. Hence,
"Strong Buy." Expensing everything quarterly at
the expense of short-term EPS does not earn as high
marks, in my unscientific opinion.

This momentum-side bias -- downgrading
(to "hold," of course -- no business to be made in "sell")
at lows and upgrading at highs -- IMO seems to allow
value investors to safely ignore the majority of analysts
except maybe as a contrarian indicator. As I believe
Jeff Maresh mentioned he does, it can pay to look closely at
the Zack's 4's and 5's.

If we are to ignore analysts, though, we likely
need to develop skills in talking to the company.
Does anyone here frequently talk to the management of
the companies in which they invest, and can he/she
give us some pointers on how to do it? Or pointers
on how to either bypass IR or to squeeze the necessary
info out of them?

Reginald,

Re: analysts and capitalization of software R&D

When I speak of the analysts, I most definitely
am not talking about the buy-side analysts. I should
have clarified that. What most of us have access
to are Zacks ratings and First Call, both dominated
by sell-side analysts. Those professionals that
disseminate their opinion freely earn my distrust immediately.

Re: capitalization of software R&D rather than expensing
all of it immediately, it seems to me that just about every
software company does this, whereas only a few software
companies actually make it big time. It is an optimistic
approach, but my understanding is that it is a very
tempting tool for aggressive accountants trying to hit
the analysts' mark. In any case, since I'm not an insider,
it is safer for me to assume so.

Re: Tejon Ranch

This is the content of my e-mail to James re: TRC --

The Tejon Ranch area is not just an easy 1 hour
north of LA. It is a grueling 1 hr drive, over
a mountainous stretch of road we call the Grapevine.
Underpowered engines slow to a crawl, and there is
a history of a lot of accidents. Then there
is the San Joaquin Valley fog, which can practically
bring things to a standstill. If you're driving from
LA to SF then you can take either 101, which is
coastal, or the 5, which runs through the vast
and empty San Joaquin Valley. The 101
is 1.5 hours longer, but a lot of people take it
just to avoid the Grapevine, especially in foul
weather. So, IMO, this area will not be developed
because there is only farming to the north and
few people would want to commute the Grapevine
to LA. The 101 route is developed all the way up
to Santa Barbara because it is such an easy drive.
I for one would rather live in Ventura and commute
1 1/2 hours down the 101 to LA than live over the
Grapevine.

It is not that this land doesn't have value--
the San Joaquin Valley is one of
the most vital and fertile breadbaskets
of this country. It's why things always
seem to be in season for the western US.
So if the company has the land
on the books at 1930s (Depression-era) prices,
it is exciting to think what
it would be worth now. Also, since real
estate in California is volatile
and cyclical, who knows, during the next
upswing some developer might even think,
"Hey, I'll develop this land because people
would rather commute this Grapevine
than pay 600,000 for a 2 bedroom, 1 1/2 bath,
1000 sq foot pad in LA." This is an intriguing
story, but I just need to confirm.how much people
will pay for the land currently. I also need
to find out exactly where the
boundaries of the land are. I remember seeing
signs "Tejon Ranch" in the
area, but I don't know how far it stretches.

*************
I'd just add that the highest point on the
mountain pass is called Tejon Pass, at
about 3000 feet (LA of course is sea level).
Any disputes with this story are welcome,
since I've been in Nashville the last
four years and my memory ain't always the
best.

Re: buy-side analysts and MPT

Thank you to all with the industry-insider insight.

If anything, this is a strong argument for finding
value among the smaller caps. Price and Gabelli
are somewhat limited re: the size of company
they can invest in, are they not? As are the large
pension funds? Even for shares of large companies,
my understanding is that the big players need
3-5 days either to liquidate a position or to buy in.

But it seems you need some institutional ownership to
provide "go" to the stock when the value is recognized.
I look for between 15 and 40% institutional ownership.
I generally like to know someone with money is watching,
but that there aren't so many that if 5% dump on bad
news the stock is shattered. Any other opinions?

Re: Barron's it seems that if the pro's pick is really
a good one, the advantage is gone by the time you
read it, since it will undoubtedly gap up Monday

Suggestions for Tech Stocks On The Value Thread

It appears several on this thread have
been seduced by the "value" in the tech
sector now that so many of the stocks have
been crunched. I'm no exception.

When posting any stock ideas here,
let's try to follow these suggestions:

1) Give at least a brief summary of where
the value is. It is completely ok to ask
the thread's guidance, but give us a reason
to check it out. To avoid rubbing readers
wrong, ticker-tape stuff should be avoided.

2) In tech, many of us have expertise in
a certain area. In that case, even if a
stock doesn't meet the "numbers" required
by many value investors, there might be
value or a margin of safety because of
an overlooked aspect or a temporary stress
by the company. Hence, Jeff's perfectly
appropriate post on SGI. Please share
this expertise if you have it and you
want the thread to take the tech stock
seriously.

Rather than explain the concepts of value investing and

a decent book on the subject? Most of us have read quite
a few. I have some book reviews at www.sealpoint.com, but
those are my opinion only. My bias is value investing,
and I highly recommend Janet Lowe's Value Investing Made
Easy as a primer. I'd follow that book with Why
Stocks Go Up (and Down) by William Pike. Other books have been discussed here
i.e. Superstocks by Ken Fisher, etc. You can
get any of these -- even obscure ones --from www.amazon.com
very easily and cheaply. When you think you've got it all

I'm a fan of value investing "with a reason". IOW, is anything

Coachmen, is backed by new management and a large share buyback
announcement as well as the idea that they will benefit from
the baby boomers spending patterns over the next 10-15 years.

Steve Romick has pointed out similar logic, and now another
fund manager has pointed out the same thing about Coachmen:

Your cash figure is from the Dec 96 quarter. 5-6 months
later, it is restructuring, cutting 60% of its workforce,
and has no revenues or guarantee of revenue in the
future. With only a 35M market cap and still half-owned
by institutions, the downside in percentage terms may
be great. I don't get a margin of safety from cash levels
in any biotech, and definitely not from half-year old
cash levels. This pick looks risky -- even if the cash
levels were as of late March. Not a superstock, not a
dividend achiever, not an asset play, not a traditional
value pick IMO.

Thanks for the interesting post. A conundrum that has
dogged me has been, "Should I really be planning for
20 or 25 years from now?." In one sense yes, if I want
to retire comfortably. In another sense, it just doesn't
make sense to count on something lasting 25 years. People
die (maybe even me, countries disappear,etc. This issue
also relates to my dilemma -- when to sell? We'll never
get rich if we sell all of our 50% gainers, but what if that
gain is within a month or two? Back in January and Feb I
was pretty paranoid and inquired as to how to use value investing
to short stocks. A more relevant question is how does a
value investor know when to sell a stock? Should we go
with Buffett, or should we say, hey the last 50 years
have been a great market and we shouldn't count on that
for another 50 years?

Just my thoughts. The Nifty Fifty are currently
extremely relevant IMO,especially the 10 year drought
that followed.

The cash/share is much more than $8.15--it sits

one's value investing mettle, both the patience

A dog to some, a 40% gainer for others. If nothing

I bought FRDM at 14, because it was too cheap by any measure.
When it hit 17, I felt it was approaching a fair value for
a company with mediocre growth, but held on because the growth story was not
mediocre but strong. It reached 23, and I sold half, feeling that it was
getting ahead of itself. Then the earnings news came
out and I entered a market sell (17 3/8) for the remaining half. Why?

Because the falloff in the revenues from their credit operations
is likely reflective of a broader trend in the economy -- people
are reaching their credit limits. It shows in the growing
credit card delinquincies and it makes sense that it would show
in the bottom line of those companies that finance the purchase
of their products in-house. Other jeweler stocks may be at risk
here. My net avg exit price was 20 1/8, and I consider myself
lucky. At its current 16, I'm sitting on the sidelines. At 11-12,
I'd be buying again.

Good Investing,
Mike

Jim,

WHX was hitting a technical resistance point, and
in my current "when to sell" confusion, I figured
that WHX had a nice run and a lot of short-term
uncertainty. Like I mentioned, my goal has been
to raise cash over the last several months. Most
stocks I like now I'm figuring I can get cheaper.
LSVI I bought now only because the story is

Hi Jeff,

Took a long look at CBI, and am impressed by their international
aspect -- maybe a good way to take advantage of the building
of infrastructure in Asia, India, and other developing areas.

But I am disturbed on most other counts, and as I am not smart
enough to do 100% top down investing, I'm inclined to
leave this one be.

On most standard value ratios, it is at or above the industry
average -- even if one doesn't include the PE, which granted is
misleading. Yet its ROE and ROA are much less than the industry
average. Further, the company is experiencing falling margins
due to product mix changes -- not a transient thing.

Maybe you can help me see the margin of safety here, cuz I
don't get it.

What do you think of HP's news that it is taking on SGI with
machines orders of magnitude faster?

As I've brought up on this thread before, I was a growth/
technical analysis investor for quite a while. I studied
TA pretty extensively. Hence, when I felt the market getting
toppy last December and became a student of value investing,
I found it hard to leave TA completely behind. Mainly I use
it only to avoid falling knives and to find buy points at
very solid support. I try not to use it to sell stocks
because my horizon remains long-term. With the
market this toppy though, I find it hard to ignore when
TA says sell after a fast rise. It's the old take the money
and run. It has helped me tremendously, and I have been
hurt when I ignore it completely. The four companies I hold
now I'm not even charting, though I would do so if one
or more gains 40-50% in a few weeks, as WHX has done.

A near net net that warrants a look:

Chris-Craft Industries (CCN) has a market

Paul,

Re: CCN

During 1997, an heretofore unseen flurry of S-4's ("insider
sale" forms) were filed.

Going back several years, this hadn't happened before. In
fact, we generally only got the form s13G/A's signifying another
major holder still holding.

Further investigation reveals these individuals were all
either Directors (7) or Board members (2). This all happened
during the long period the shares sat in the 40-42 range.
The executions ranged from 39.84 to 41.52. Recently the shares
have broken through the 45ish resistance and are at about 50.
Bad timing. The CEO, who holds a huge chunk, and his other
senior executives haven't sold a share.

In sum, this news is equivocable, so I need a tie-breaker.
Hence I look at the balance sheet, the assets, the business,
and the quality of the large shareholders. This all tilts
me in the solid "Buy" area.

In general, I don't pay attention to insider sales as
much as buys. Of course, when I see the CEO, the COO,
the Pres, and 5 VP's all selling 30 kabillion dollars worth
that's one thing. But two officers/board members here
and there, even in a clump, doesn't worry me.

BHC has $668M in Class A shares, but it also has Class B shares
entirely owned by Chris Craft. How much are those Class B

From the tone of this thread and
the e-mail my web site has generated,
I get the feeling that a lot of value
investors are now or have been frustrated
at the lack of quality stocks meeting
traditional value criteria. I know I'm spending
a lot of time looking at smaller and smaller
market caps with questionable management. I worry
about the large caps that are falling or
underperforming -- after all, if they can't
do well in this market with mutual funds
stuffing money into anything that's liquid
and has propspects, how will they do in
a bear or sideways market? That liquidity
cuts both ways.

At what level would value investors re-enter
this market? I would buy Coke at 30-35 and
Gilette at 50ish. That leaves a lot of room
for a fall once the momentum turns down --
who will be the buyers to give the 10-15%
growers valued at 40-50 X earnings and 10-15
X sales some support?

One would expect that at these market heights,
this thread would be dead. It's a tribute
to the contributors that they are still
finding solid values here and there. I can't
wait to see what this thread is like when
the market has corrected 25-30%.

It's just interesting that value ideas
have become excruciatingly hard to find --
the ones that are found seem to run up
within a few months, if not days. None
of this slow steady movement up. Geez,
look at what Berkshire Hathaway has done
just in the last 6-7 mos. You buy a severely
undervalued stock like WHX at 5 and set
a 2-3 year target of 10-15. It hits 10

Thanks for the feedback. I was just
trying to bring out different strategies
for value investors to play a significant
market downturn.

Other options for the value investor
at these market heights:

1) stay 100% long and raise cash
at target prices; moratorium
on buying -- for how long?

2) continue on business-as-usual
despite the market -- will likely
raise cash due to scarce new
buys -- the "natural" value-based
bear market strategy

3) Buy portfolio insurance in
the form of S&P index puts --
worsened the 1987 crash

4) Sell short SPDR's --
high capital requirements

5) Short the overpriced leaders
like Coke, Gilette -- problem
is they're good companies

6) Short tech stocks with
astronomical PSR's/PE's

7) Selling current true
values -- just doesn't
make sense to do this
on a hunch.

Other ideas welcome.

Re: Trigon Health (TGH)

The company is an insurer. Yahoo is counting its
float as cash and investments on its balance sheet,
which is true, but misleading because
there are liabilities beyond simple debt against
that float.

Do we look at the float when we look at insurance
companies? Yes, but not to compare the per share
float to the per share price. The float relative
to certain measures is a proxy for the company's
stability in hard times. Berkshire Hathaway keeps
a huge float which allows it to market itself as safer
than other insurers.

The company needs to be valued as an insurance
company -- keeping in mind it provides
a type of insurance that is becoming
more and more competitive. Further,
the industry itself is a shrinking pie.

The latest 10K was just filed today:

Re: the flip side of TRC

Thanks, Mike. I posted a similar
flip side a while ago:
http://www.exchange2000.com/~wsapi/investor/s-10036/reply-1118

Another interesting site is the Bakersfield
Real Estate ads for lots/acreage:
http://www.bakersfield.com/~tbc/cgi-bin/class/class.pl?field1=sub-1210&field2=0

Prices range from 20 acres for 65k, 40 acres for 24k,
10 acres for $6500, etc. The areas close to developed
areas look like 2 acres for 75k, 10 acres for 140k,
etc.

Looks like TRC is fairly valued on an asset basis if
these prices are the case. When reviewing these ads,
note that Tehachapi area locations are similar in
terrain to the Tejon ranch, but closer to Bakersfield.

The excitement comes from the fact that management
has taken an interest in developing some of these
270,000 acres. As noted above, land in developed
areas can go for $15k to $30k/acre. So not all of the
Tejon Ranch needs to be developed. ANY development
should justify the current price, and may lead to
significant gains down the road.

I agree, Paul. When the market swoons, I doubt the
momentum players will seek value. Have you read
How To Pick Stocks -- Kiplinger's interview with all
the famous fund managers? The growth managers sound
about 1/10th as sophisticated as the value managers.
I doubt they even know how to spot value, and they
certainly won't throw money into the sort of value
plays we're discussing here. My guess is they will
raise cash and make timid steps back into the market--
providing the bumps on the way down.

BTW, I'm currently reading Stocks for the Long

much of his logic and do not subscribe to his

Thanks Paul. Here's an excerpt:

Why would the Chandlers turn their backs on a potential value of billions of
dollars? The answer lies in the family's goal of pruning back mercilessly to
core publishing businesses -- regardless of potential long-term returns --
and,given that, the business reality that it was better to sell in one fell
swoop even at below-market prices than to risk hammering down Tejon's thinly
traded stock in the open market.

To put it mildly, the buyers seem to have gotten themselves a real bargain.
Whitman says his stake cost him the equivalent of $650 an acre. He could
already make a healthy profit, he says, but he's not about to sell anytime
soon. He figures the land could ultimately be worth $5,000 an acre, maybe more.

Tejon Ranch has already announced it intends to begin developing some of its
most valuable property, along Interstate 5, the key north-south route running
through the middle of California. The company controls 16 uninterrupted miles
of unimproved highway frontage along both sides of I-5, including four highway
interchanges.

Step two, Whitman says, will be the development of residential housing on
20,000 acres in the Antelope Valley at the northern end of Los Angeles County.
He also points out that Tejon Ranch could expand its valuable agricultural
operations and simultaneously allow recreational access to the more mountainous
parts of the property.

Kyle Krueger, who runs Apollo Capital, a small St. Petersburg, Fla.-based
investment partnership, calculates Tejon's value at $80-$120 a share, figuring
at least $100 million for the agricultural acreage, $500 million for acreage
zoned for residential development, $250 million for Tejon's water rights, and
at least $250 million for the lands along I-5. Krueger points out that "Stine
has spent the last 15 months putting together a plan to materially increase the
pace and scope of real-estate development activities on the property. They
haven't disclosed the specifics or started to implement the plan, but they
will. It's imminent."

Stine says Tejon's first priority will be to upgrade the water, sewer and other
infrastructure along I-5 to allow development of motels, restaurants and
service stations. Whatever happens, Tejon Ranch's days as a sleepy agricultural
stock are over. Says Stine: "It's a new era."

Lisa,

I read that article and was less than impressed.
The PEG is purely a GARP tool, IMO. If earnings
collapse , most of those companies would collapse.
There is no inherent margin of safety in GARP/PEG
investing. Like Michael Price says, its easier to
value the present than the future. It can be
just as profitable with better sleep and less
risk. Look at James Clarke's picks Tejon Ranch
and St. Joe's.

Here's an interesting tidbit from Forbes:
Warren Buffett is buying zero coupon
long-term Treasury bonds on a large
scale. We picked this information up
from zero coupon bond desks at some of Wall
Street's biggest firms. Five of the biggest bond
dealers report inquiries from Berkshire
Hathaway, an account that rarely ventures into
bonds. According to our information
Berkshire Hathaway has been quietly buying
zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds in 20- to
23-year maturities since late July.
Has the sage of Omaha concluded that
the stock market is overpriced and long bonds
underpriced? We simply do not know. Buffett
didn't return our call.

Steven,

I'm not one of the value gurus, but
I agree with Paul. Cash looking
to buy a business. It's office supplies
are really impact printer ribbons --
commodities with a limited future at
best. Cash can disappear for any
number of reasons -- and not all
of them increase shareholder value.
On the bright side, the CEO
is the 70% owner, and he has bought
some of the stock on the open market
this year. Does he know something
we don't? Also, the stock jumped
recently and you are getting the
business for very little.
Something may be up, but the margin
of safety isn't clear enough for me
at this stage of the bull.

Pete,

My response to Bonnie did not disagree with
her. I was simply pointing out that both
I and another poster had brought out
similar negatives to an investment in TRC
previously. Re: "being correct" I didn't
see her offer her estimate of the value of
TRC.

The tone of her message is the part that
is not welcome on this thread. In general
the thread should be less a place for
argument and more a place for rational
discussion.

TRC is now a momentum stock short-term.
Even the Motley Fool has covered it two
days in a row -- this time retracting yesterday's
estimate and cutting its projected value by 90%.
Shorts I'm sure smell opportunity -- if they could just prick the bubble...

Bonnie,

Just trying to keep the thread civil...

I don't feel the market has acted too
crazy yet. Itis nevertheless a momentum
play -- I expect it to fall back some or
stay near this level as the momentum
players realize they don't have the
patience to be value investors.

Marty Whitman figures $5000/acre, and
he is a more credible figure than
any of us here.

So, $5000/acre about 10 years from now
minus 20-50% for the minimal development costs
and you might come up with $40/share
present value.

As someone who grew up in the Bay
Area, attended UCLA, and even had
relatives at Edwards AFB, I know the
land is imperfect. Valuing
this one is extremely difficult.
In my case, it's probably worth
it to hold it a year just for the
tax break on the gains when I sell.

1) EMT. I personally believe markets are selectively inefficient for
no good reason. I studied economics and realize the limitations of its theory,
yet MBA's and finance professors often forget they are dispensing theory, not
rules. The theory is backed to the best of
the academic's ability with studies. The studies re: stock market returns omit
the subjective in favor of the objective
by necessity -- especially if the study is to have the requisite power. The
power is bought at the expense of real-world
application. This is a fatal flaw in the "pronouncements" made by academics
with respect to value investing. Another flaw relates to the retrospective
limitation of academic finance studies. How about a
randomized, controlled, prospective trial? IT IS NOT POSSIBLE due to variations
in the subjective aspect of investing. Would a doctor give you a drug without
the benefit of such a trial? No, yet academics have
made their careers (tenure motivates) advocating people base their financial
futures on inherently weak studies. Spend some time on
this thread and you'll realize that subjective interpretations of the same data
vary widely. No offense to Lester, but 90% of the
literature put out by this nation's universities (even MIT) is junk
science motivated by the tenure carrot. This is especially true in
the "unprovable" disciplines like finance and economics, where controversy and
new theories count more than real-world applicability.

2) The EMT'ers are the ones that allow the inefficiency to continue --
by giving up and buying the market (like most mutual funds these
days). The fact that stocks jump when they are added to the S&P
is evidence of the degree to which this occurs. The small caps
and stocks that aren't moving in price/volume are ignored. Also
ignored are values like Tejon Ranch -- where the assets are on
the books at such low prices relative to present value that
no ratios will look good -- hence no way will they pop up on
institutional fundamental screens.

3) <<The value investor may do well now looking in ADRs, and waiting for
interest-rate market shocks in the U.S. to pick up bargains.>>

I agree -- I'm moving into them now. But how do you get bargains if
the markets are efficient?

<<it sounds like we have a different definition of efficient>>

<<Value investing has turned into "emotional contrarian fashion investing",>>

You evidently are not familiar with what goes
on here. You sound like a momentum investor
who doesn't believe in value investing, believes
markets are efficient -- even US Small Cap --
and are mistaking the run-up in Tejon Ranch
for the routine action of value investors. The value
investors got in before the run-up. Scanning
the boards to which you typically post, I
see a momentum player, not a bottom feeder.

Unfortunately, the bull market has already
taken most of the ideas on this thread up,
up and away. It almost appears there is
a correlation between mention here and
appreciation within months.

Some of the ideas I'm mulling with all
the cash I raised recently:

Ispat Int'l
For the reason for my interest, check out:
http://www.cnnfn.com/hotstories/busunu/9708/07/ispat_intv/
The stock IPO'd very recently near 30, and has
fallen to the 25's with the market. This gives
it a PE of about 5. Yet it is a leading int'l
integrated steel producer. I am having trouble
finding info on it, though -- a source of
inefficiency that might be capitalizable.

Hyde Athletics, my thoughts at
http://www.sealpoint.com/pow.html

Thinking it is not too late to buy WHX,
but waiting for the market to become
more of a bear.

Chris-Craft -- much discussed here
is trading lower but remains a true
value, though not an overlooked one.
Everyone on Wall Street is standing
there looking at it, saying "Yep,
there's a company worth at least
2.2B selling for 1.5B. Yep, no debt.
Yep."

I'm consciously raising cash in anticipation
of a downturn.

Ron,

Hyde got 7.1M for Brookfield. For a company
with a market cap of 26M despite the Saucony,
Hind and Quintana Roo brands, that ain't bad.
My broker and I weasled a price of 4.09 on
3000 shares today, so I'm into it now. I've
got a limit pending on another 3000 at 4 in
another account. IMO, this is cheaper than
cheap.

I must admit I sold Tejon -- not willing
to let the momentum players kick

Re: STAR

Terry,

I believe you are correct. Thank you for reminding
me of this stock. I had wanted to track it last
time it was at this level, but forgot. My take:

Lone Star Steakhouse

Operates 3 main chains with 3 price levels,
with lots of room for growth in the upper
two levels if not the bottom level.

In general restaurant stocks have missed
the bull market and many are treading
water. Still, this stock is cheap compared
to its industry:
PE 9.5 vs. 23.7
P/B 1.3 vs. 3.94
PSR 1.3 vs 2.25 (ESR for this company is ~1)
Net Profit Margin 14% vs 10%
No debt vs. TDebt/Equity Avg of 0.69

The company has $3.62/share in cash, so
you get the business for in the high $500
million range. This for a business that
generates $36M in operating cash flow
per quarter in the abscence of leveraged
operations. The present value of these
future cash flows relative to cost of equity
sits around ~$1Billion, even with no
growth. Yet growth is definitely a
possibility given the new venture
into higher-end, $60/customer restaurants.

Hence, I see a company that is
undervalued even if it did not grow
further -- you get the growth for
free and then some if it happens.
No insider sales. It is hard to see
the downside here, but here goes:

1) Management recently repriced
its options to the 18ish level from
higher levels
2) Institutions owned >85% of the
company on 6/30. That is probably
down no thanks to the massive
dump on August 5th that knocked
the shares to this level.
3) There are already 10 analysts following
it, with an average Zacks rating of
2.1. This may be an advantage.
Ken Fisher's Super Stocks book
has helped me understand better
the institutional viewpoint on
fallen angels that have hit a
"glitch." The stock wouldn't be
this low if the institutional
psychology wasn't against it -
a plus from my point of view.

Technically, it is at a support level,
so now would be a good time to
buy. Further, it has basically
hammered out a straight horizontal
line since the fall 3 weeks ago.
This tells me we are at something
of a floor. Lots are bailing, but
lots are buying too.

I'll add this to my portfolio. Thank
you.

Mike

Re: STAR

Thanks, Paul. An Enterprise-to-Sales of
1 can stand lower margins than 14%,
IMO. The market seems to have overreacted
to the threat of lower margins -- it is
already priced into the stock (and then
some). Even the analyst cites the
balance sheet and cash flow as sources
of support -- pretty impressive.
Any dip from here due to a selloff

Re: STAR

The balance sheet shows over $350M in
property and equipment. The leases allow
them to have no debt. Relative to the
market cap and the cash flow, there is
value here IMO, though it is not all
asset value. I agree you are counting
on cash flow to some extent. Also, looks
to me like Lone Star is one of the
strongest of the steakhouses financially,
just from a quick view of the competitors.
And it hasn't even advertised yet. Re:
competition, they don't have to grow
to make this price a value.

This is a greater fool's market. The market

Seems the strategy here is to acquire AGRO for
$3/share, await the exchange for ~ $3.45/share
in stock. Then you have shares in a company
that doesn't look too bad. What will these
shareholders do? I assume sell their new stock
and cash in on the 15% gain in favor of gambling
on an unknown stock. Could you get out of
JWS before the other AGRO shareholders? This
is an arbitrage play of which I'm wary. A better
deal would be to wait for the depression in JWS's
thinly traded stock after the exchange. Then you
can pick up JWS cheaper plus the assets of AGRO
cheaper. This is way-micro and difficult for me
to swallow. Could I get my transactions costs
low enough to make the deal worthwhile given
the risk? I don't know. There are several merger
plays that offer similar rewards out there. I
stay away from arbritrage because most often
the benefit does not outweigh the risk of
the deal not going through. The transaction
costs if this one doesn't go through will be
around 10% given the spread and commissions.

Brookfield will allow them to concentrate on

Other suggestions of Fitzpatrick (the real estate fund manager
quoted in the article) -- no REIT's here:

IHOP -- a real estate company disguised as a
restaurant company, with only restaurant analysts
following it. He figures $55/share in assets,
plus it's opening 65 restaurants a year. Good
management.

Wellsford Real Properties -- $21 in assets vs
12 share price, with catalysts in place for
realization of the value.

Supertel Hospitality - operates Super 8 motels,
Fitzpatrick likes the management.

These all seem worth a look for value investors.
The article itself is a must read, as is often
the case with Forbes articles.

<<As a doc, you should be able to make the same kinds of calls in medical high
tech issues. The gains can be higher than computer-related stocks.>>

Ay, there's the rub. Indeed, some biotechs explode upward, but
those that don't often fail. There's not much of a middle
road. And you can often lose your shirt (>90%) on a regulatory
decision or a new side effect that raises the lawsuit specter.
Hence, while I am a physician, I am hesitant to recommend any
biotechs as value plays. I do not personally know anyone who
plays the biotech market exclusive of owning the big pharms that
does well long-term. Way too much guessing -- even if you know
what you are talking about.

An example:
Theragenics makes radioactive implantable seeds to be placed
in a cancerous prostate. What a market! Yes, they work. Yes
the morbidity is low. I knew this before the market.
And I bought at 13 -- at a PE of about 60. It's now at 44
or so. I got out at 17 1/2 -- a PE of 90. And that's one of
the few "values" I've found.

Needless to say, little to no margin of safety. Discounts to Sales are rare and
often deserved as the market for the product is failing. Biotechs just about
all also fail both Fishers' rules -- namely, there is just too much
competition. One discovery anywhere in the world can obsolete 20-100% of your
company's product line. The regular techs
have more predictability (relative to biotech). AMAT I bought
April 96 at 37 only to see it fall to the value you bought it at.
I got out at 31. Looked smart for about 4 months.

When I do find a biotech value play -- PE<50 and >0 in a market
I know will explode -- the full value is often not realized
as the behemoths buy up your company before realization of
the market. Hence, I wonder now whether it is worth the
risk and sleepless nights for a value investor to buy biotechs
at all anymore.

Chris,

LSVI is getting interesting, no? My take:

- LSVI does appear poorly managed, and CEI's management
does appear intelligent -- the recent records of
both companies in similar environments provides some
evidence of this.

- the put right good for 1 year at 6.15 is less than
ideal, but it does give one the right to risk
a 10% downside for unlimited upside for a year.
Those aren't bad odds, even if nothing signifcant
happens.

- CEI's CEO still has 20 odd million shares after the
transaction, if approved. He certainly has incentive
to increase the stock price of LSVI. And he would
have difficulty extracting himself from that position,
suggesting a long-term bias. And unless he wants
to buy back all the current shares at 6.15 in a year
and swallow his pride, he has significant short-term
incentive.

- it's a vote of confidence in the current price level
of LSVI, if not a higher price.

- it's a reason for LSVI's extra due diligence on its
10K - now likely just a delay tactic.

Interesting, especially from the sidelines. I'd appreciate
others' input.

<<Each interested person pick your favorite value stocks and build a portfolio

Great idea. This sort of exercise would be informative and
probably desrves its own thread -- how about starting
a thread called Value Portfolios or something?

Another idea is for each long-time participant to make a list
of his/her past recs here, with performance measures and
analysis of the mistakes/good decisions. There may be
some gold still worth mining in those recs. I'll do this
myself when I have time and post it here.

Re: PRMO and TLC

If value investing were just a set of numbers
and the same thing to everyone, it wouldn't work.

PRMO was trading at an enterprise to sales ratio
of 0.40. This for a traditionally high margin business.
Also, it was buying back shares -- I love that, as
I've mentioned before. It had
5 bucks of cash and traded as low as 5.25 despite
having a viable product according to my industry sources.
That's value and a definite margin of safety, IMO.

TLC was less obvious:
Price 6.5
Book 4.4/sh
Revs 8.4/sh; 3 year sales growth is 94 121M, 95 167M 96 343M
5 straight Q's of $2-4 losses due to charges.
Last Q .60 (-2% from estimates)not including charges
LT Debt/Equity =2.54 (key, IMO)
Current Ratio 1.864
Free Cash Flow 1.544 (also key)
44M shs out

Note that sales growth was huge over the three years noted.
Yet the shares had fallen to a >20% discount to sales.
Its cash flow remained positive despite the losses -- a
key point to look for according to Ken Fisher. And of
course it was buying back stock. The current ratio
told me the business wasn't in immediate trouble. And
it has a great international franchise.

The more experience I get, the more I learn to look for --
1) Stock buybacks
2) Discounts to sales that are historically extreme for
a company
3) Positive cash flow during a rough patch
4) Margin of safety -- if a stock has $5 bucks in cash
and is trading at 5.25, then the upside/downside
ratio is gonna look good;
5) Insider ownership/buying at stock lows
6) In tech stocks, stocks that have been on a horrendous
fall because they failed to live up to their hype, yet
have strong balance sheets and other value characteristics.
IMO, Applix, which has recovered to 8 from where I
noted it at 4-5 is one of these now. The risk is higher
now, but at 3 1/8 (its low) it was a steal. Even now, it
is an only a moderately aggressive buy.

I'll take a WHX when it comes along, but that only happens
every few years. The rest of the time, I find I have to
compromise a criteria or two to make the stock fit.

I'm no expert - just IMO.

Mike

Re: CCN

Yep, still in it. I called the company just a few days ago
to straighten out how they account for everything.
The 18M class B BHC shares they own are convertible
to class A shares at a 1:1 ratio. When asked whether
we should therefore value the shares at the current
~130 price of the A shares, one of CCN's finance guys
assured me, "yes of course, maybe more since they
are controlling shares." With the cash tossed in, you
can still buy CCN at a fully diluted price less than
it's assets net of liabilities. I detailed this some
more under the Portfolio portion of my web site.

You get a large cap for free with about 120M left over. Not that common an
occurrence. Take a look at the
income statement and it becomes even more of a no-brainer. A
profitable, cash flow positive large cap for free?????
CCN is still a buy at these levels, IMO. It's 15% of my
portfolio.

Re: Market Trends

I've thought a lot about this -- I have shorted stocks
like Coke and Wells Fargo, I've shorted the S&P, I've
raised cash and then bought back in. I am coming to the
conclusion that I will focus on the value in individual
stocks. When the market crash comes, I will be hurt
less by it, and if it doesn't come for another two years,
I won't be hurt by my shorts. That said, I manage two
accounts, and one is nearly 40% cash, the other 30%.
This must have something to do with the lack of value
out there, because believe me I am looking. I am tempted
to keep 30% cash until we see a significant correction,
just so I can have some fun buying some screaming
bargains. But if I find a good value, I won't let my
cash goal stand in the way.

Market trends are not worthless, and they do warrant
discussion to an extent. Certainly year-end trends
matter. I would have to feel awfully good about a
stock that has been down this year to buy it now.

Re: end-of-year trends,

Two aspects of the end of the year make certain
depressed values even better values.

1) Window-dressing by mutual funds/money managers

As you point out, losers are dumped and winners
are bought with abandon. I've noticed this happens
less when the market is really doing well and everyone's
up. More common when the quarter has been a difficult
one.

2) Tax-loss selling

It makes sense if you have a big loss in a stock
you are holding, but have taken profits in more
successful stocks, to sell the loser. This way
you can offset some of your profits. Because everyone
does this, there is a good chance you can buy
that loser back in 30 days at an even lower price,
pay very little taxes on your profits as a consequence.
The difficulty here is timing it right. There's
always the danger that the long-suffering holder
of a poor stock will miss the two-day double for
which he/she had yearned.

This tax-loss selling has made for the much-publicized
January Effect. Since selling hits small caps so
much harder than large caps, small caps tend to become
very depressed as the year closes out. Then in January,
because the renewed buying bouys small caps so much
more, the small caps jump, yielding historically outstanding
returns for small caps in January.

Many people have been amazed that the January effect keeps
happening despite the widespread recognition of the fact.
It makes sense though -- the will to avoid taxes is matched
only by the lust for making money quickly.

Since, by default, most of us here are small cap investors --
that's where the value is -- it's important to be aware of this
fact. For those of us who have not been sitting in losing
stocks and truly have cash to deploy, the end of the year
is a great time to snap up small cap values.

Yes, too amazing,

Check out the 10Q and you see that once you subtract out the
current liabiilities and substantial long term liabilities, you
get much less of a value. The company is not selling for free,
and is not at a discount to its net net assets. You are indeed

Barron's has more unfavorable comments, centering on the
fact that it has a weak balance sheet that it has tried

the more stock is diluted by the potential conversion. Currently, the fully

Re: New Holland,

Thanks for the info, James. Your posts are always worth

web site, oriented to the US investor. Current as of 12/96.

http://www.newholland.com/nh/finsta.htm

Looks like PSR 0.80, Current Ratio 1.7, has 727M cash
and equivalents relative to a total market cap of
4.377B. LT debt of only 80M, but LT liabilities
up in the 600M range -- cash covers it.

Looking at the income statement, earnings and sales growing,
with improving inventory management. Love the cash flow
statement as well.

A solid, dividend-paying stock with no sell-side analyst
coverage.

It also looks like for some reason this stock has
been moving recently with the US market. We might
be able to pick it up even cheaper soon.

Thanks Ron for bringing this to our attention.

Knape and Vogt Manufacturing (KNAP)

This company is interesting. Sales have been flat for years,
but it has been increasing margins, generating cash to pay
down debt. It now has less than 25M in LT debt to go, sells
for about $120M, and is generating a run rate of about $25-30M/yr
in cash after capital investment AND after paying it's
dividend but before paying down debt. There is a 3.2% dividend
(49% payout) while you wait. Relative to the industry and the it's own
past, the stock is at the average and at its highs in valuation,
but the company is improving, starting with a new COO in
1995 -- the first non-family member to run the company.

This is like the Sybron pick -- a very well-run company on the
upswing - not the cheapest, but for good reason, and it is not
by any means expensive. As it pays off the rest of its debt in
the next year, you get all that cash flow for a low price, with
room for dividend expansion. A long-term hold, but with good
prospects.

I couldn't help myself. My shopping spree:

Jan Bell Marketing (JBM) at 2 7/8. As I
detailed in my Investor article, a net net
with strong cash flow.

Micron Electronics (MUEI) at 14. Added to
my position. PC makers and components got
hit 10-15% today, even the undervalued
ones. This one is one of the undervalued
ones that got more undervalued today. The
best quality, the best customer service,
a great balance sheet, and solid multiples,
now at a PSR under 0.75 despite growing
sales and profits.

Little Switzerland (LSVI) at 6 1/4. LSVI
has an offer from a suitor which would give
each shareholder rights to put to the company
their shares at 6.15 up to a year after the takeover.
Not approved yet, but I'll vote for it at the
meeting in December. Sales advancing. Balance
sheet suffering from non-recurring employee theft, but
still looks good.

Looking at Telebras (TBR) in the 80's,
Quantum (QNTM) at 28, Western Digital (WDC) at 26,
Seagate (SEG) at 22. Heck, even Dell and Intel --
just kidding :) Never thought I'd see these
prices, but with the end-of-day halt in the midst
of a freefall, it's virtually guaranteed.
Also looking at Huaneng Power (HNP), Shandong Huaneng
Power (SH) -- both almost there.

Not Chris Craft fell today just because it's on
the NYSE. BHC hardly budged. Now Chris Craft is
selling for less than the 77% of BHC it owns.

I tried to buy WHX, but trading had been
halted. I still have some cash left for tomorrow.
Pretty exciting....Glad I'm working nights this

My portfolio was only down about 2.5% yesterday, but that was

Re: SYC, JBM, KNAP

Sybron Chemical arbitrage opportunity. The market crash brought

to the market fall. Even if the stock doesn't get bought out, it
is a good deal at 30.

Also, Jan Bell Marketing as previously discussed here is now
at a @2.50 bid/$2 3/4 ask. That's a good price for a net net

Ron, I certainly won't blame you. I've spent Lord knows how much
in commissions with Schwab, all because I wanted the best when

margin to build infrastructure. At $150/trade, there's no excuse.

Biopool (BIPL) is one of those companies that always makes me
wary. "Over 150 FDA -approved diagnostic products distributed worldwide," yet
only about $16 million annualized sales. In other words, about $100K in revenue
per product. That ain't much. The stock looks good in every respect, but I'll
have to investigate the products some more. I get the feeling the products are
in highly competitive areas and that only through great effort are they able to
make the sale to a few hospitals here and there. Because it is not

Re: ROC

The book value of 14.75 is likely not a BV of 14.75 now. Through
yesterday, the 30% drop in the Hang Seng (as a proxy for the Taiwan Stock
Market) plus the 8% devaluation of the Taiwan dollar during the month of
October would give the book value at about 9.576 assuming that they performed
in line with the market.

So it is now selling around 90% of book, in my estimation. Some
downside protection. Now that I've got Telebras, I'm looking to
Asia for my next international investment. CEF's might be the

Jeffrey,

This is from my web site:

. Currency worries have driven the Brazilian market and Telebras, its largest
stock, down severely in recent weeks. Yet the British government is committed
to defending the currency and maintaining ties to the US dollar. In any case,
the long term story remains intact, as privatization of Telebras is scheduled
to occur by mid-1998. Brazil has the largest GDP and the largest population in
Latin America, but only 1 phone for every 10 people, compared to 6.5 in the
U.S. The opportunities for growth are impressive, with 70% growth in phone
penetration over the next 3 years. And Telebras boasts 62% operating margins,
the highest of any telecom worldwide, but only a price-to-sales ratio of 2.5 at
a share price of $100. This compelling value in the face of such expected
growth makes Telebras a stellar bet for the long-term investor who can tolerate
extreme short-term fluctuation.

Interesting article in the Nov 3rd Forbes, which actually came
out before the market turned upside down. One of the columnists
outlines how the market is high , and proposes that Asia will
bring the markets down by way of their currency crisis introducing a
deflationary economy to the U.S. Part of his prediction has come
to pass - the decoupling of bonds and stocks by way of the threat
of a deflationary economy. He ends by noting how traditionally right
people like Buffett bought bonds at the first signs of the Asian
crisis.

If what he says comes to pass, for the first time in thirty
years bonds will no longer follow stocks and vice versa. The fear
of inflation, a phenomenon of the last 30 years, will be replaced
by a fear of deflation, which makes the relationship between bonds
and stocks the opposite of what we've been used to.

Value investors are always aware of the real return offered by bonds,
as they are the true alternative to stocks. In a deflationary
economy, add the deflation number to the yield and the potential
capital appreciation -- bonds would do very well.

Just something to think about.

that it is growing while only incurring an 11%

Even better, it has announced a buyback. I like to see that, especially after a

I have very little extra insight into the disk drives as

time ago as GTC orders thinking I'd never see these prices. I have
friends in the disk drive industry that are jumping on
Seagate stock now. Western Digital has been punished the
most. But Quantum is the most diversified and has the
biggest commitment to R&D. The way to look at these
stocks is as Ken Fisher Super Stocks IMO.

Out there, my favorite buys right now remain Telebras,
Quantum. Seagate had good relative strength today. I would
buy at 22 if it gets there. Note that Creative Technologies has been
showing incredible relative strength during this sell-off.
It has been criticized as a momentum stock, but as
my Investor article points out, there is value there too,
and it seems to be holding up. I also bought Deswell

You are 100% correct. With all manufacturers we have to
be wary of such inventory and AR issues. No doubt it is
not all solid. I like Jan Bell Marketing's balance sheet
better, but I like Hyde's potential better. In Hyde's
case, you have a net net with 20+% revenue growth. And
in Jan Bell's case you have a better balance sheet and
solid cash flow, but no growth.

I can't decide which is better, so I just bought both.
Hyde at current prices is less a steal than when I first bought
it at 4 1/11. But I did add to my position at the 5 bid

My two cents on Buffett:

Reading both Graham and Fisher has helped me understand Buffett's
approach much more than I did just from reading American Capitalist
and the annual reports. I guess I took the same approach Buffett
did, studying Graham first, then reading Fisher. Now, every one
of Buffett's purchases make sense from a value perspective, if
not a strict Graham value perspective. The fact that he has NEVER
had a down year over such a long period of time while averaging something like
28% returns is the only proof needed that he's the greatest investor ever.

Now, can we apply his methods? I'm not sure. I mean, Buffett, despite
his hands-off approach, is not totally uninvolved in the management.
The newspapers are good examples, but it seems that all his businesses move to
new levels of achievement in terms of cash flow, returns
to shareholders, and cash flow after he's on board. Heck, I know
what would've happened if I'd bought the Buffalo newspaper - zippo.
Further the guy is a certified genius who's talent is in shareholder
returns. Would he have made a good neurosurgeon or psychiatrist? Not
necessarily. Should I expect to do as well as him without his specific talent?
Not at all.

To each his own talents. I'm just content to sit back and dissect
each move he's made now. I mean, his movement into bonds (zeroes
no less) was incredibly prescient. Throughout the huge 20 year run up in stocks
he held on, then makes a massive switch
to zeroes within months of the uncoupling of the stock and bond
markets. Wow.

Paul,

While holding a diversified portfolio might protect against
loss, it limits one's ability to beat the market. In his book
Investment Psychology Explained, Martin Pring points out that
diversifying to only eight stocks takes about 90% of the situational risk from
a portfolio, and further diversification limits the ability
to produce superior returns at the same time you are increasing
exposure to market risks.

I'd have to go with Carnegie's advice to "put all your eggs in
one basket and watch it very closely." I think the big lesson
from Buffett is that the advantage individual investors have over institutions
and the S&P is that they can wait for the very best. The other major advantage
for individuals is they can hold indefinitely while not having to report to
anyone. Most individuals trade on a whim and frequently, thereby negating their
natural advantages and guaranteeing the majority will always be wrong.

Of course, I'm still only striving to follow this seemingly simple advice,
which indicates how against human nature it is, and how
those that can buy well and hold long are accomplishing something
few can. For this, they deserve extra returns.

Those are exactly the practical problems of a concentrated

running a concentrated portfolio with less risk. But the practical
problems that you mention are exactly what I deal with.

In the vein of natural talents, could it be that person A's natural

Re: Portfolio Management, WDC/QNTM, APM

<<If a person maintains 8-10 stocks but has turnover of 100% what does that
mean?>>

With such a concentration at the heights of a raging, volatile
and possibly crumbling bull, turnover doesn't mean much to me.
If the reason is that stocks are being knocked down 30-70% all
around him/her, then it is logical.

Now, if a person is selling solely because a stock is falling, then
that is an indication of trading, churning, and lack of conviction
as a result of lack of due diligence in the first place.

Personally, when I sell to make moves into other stocks, I sell
the stocks that haven't moved either up or down. My hope is that,
systematically, I will be leaving stocks that are on avg inherently
less volatile and with little market correlation. In this way,
I am maximizing my chances of returning at the same value price
at a point in the future when that stock becomes the best relative
value. If one of my stocks falls, like MUEI, TBR, QNTM, and HYDEA
all did recently, I average down by selling one of the "quiet" stocks. After
all, a good value just got better and I want
to take advantage. Turnover can be high, but I see reason in this.

Re: WDC/QNTM; I took my off WDC for a bit and then I see it
at 19. Good price. If I had a diversified portfolio I would
probably have bought it. Having looked into it pretty extensively,
and owing to my diversify-across-sectors strategy, I only need one dd.
Quantum at 25-27 fits the bill as the single best idea, but
WDC at 19 or SEG at 21 are both definitely good ideas.

Re: APM, from what I understand, the current balance sheet and
cash flows and all are threatened with extinction due to
a paradigm shift within the industry that's moving manufacturers
away from APM. There is huge speculation whether APM's management
can pull it off. If not, there is question whether APM can
survive. Paul, could you describe why an investment in
APM is not speculation? Not being critical; just want to learn
more since it looks so good numbers-wise and I do not understand
the situation perfectly.

Re: WHX

Just to make a disclosure, I recently bought a small
position, but rather immmediately turned around and sold it upon
further investigation and the release of the 10Q.

I am worried about:

Debt load - the company is actually borrowing the
money to buy back shares, and the debt load is getting
up there. With equity down to 500 million from
over 700 million, the debt/equity is getting up there.
If you include the pension and employee liabilities
and the fact you've got renegotiate in 5 years, I
worry about being too leveraged. All that cash is
great, but it is largely offset now by debt. Is it
getting more than a 9% return on its cash? I'm
confused here.

Business economics - The company may make anywhere
from $1-$2.50/year in the next few years, but the
uncertainty is very high. I am not knowledgeable
enough to know how quickly and how well WHX can
reclaim its old business. My understanding is that
the low-cost producer will do better than others,
but everyone will suffer from industry overcapacity
over the next year or two. Do the employee reductions and
benefit reductions make WHX a very low cost producer?
And does it make sense for WHX to leverage itself
so much going into a cyclical industry that may be
turning down?

I think this stock was a screaming buy down at
$5 1/2 - $7, a good buy at $9-10, and now has
the potential to go up to the $20 range. But I agree
now with Paul that the margin of safety is hard
to see. The book value seems real enough.

I must say that I have been influenced to a large
degree by my recent intense study of Buffett and
Phil Fisher, so the steel business in general
is not appealing to me. I pulled the plug on
several stocks that don't make as much sense to
me now, and WHX is one of them.

IMO, PE's are bashed too much by most of us value
investors and praised too highly by those in the
momentum/ <1 year camp.

My biggest use for the PE is to look at historic
ranges once I've already checked out that the
PE is valid, i.e. no tricks in the income statement
or balance sheet.

After all, the market does like the PE as a tool,
and keeps most stocks in their historical range
year-in year out. If I'm on the fence, and the
stock is at the lower end of its 10 year PE range,
it helps to know this.

It is this analysis which is keeping me out of
Nike currently, waiting for the mid-30's should
they ever come.

Re: UST

Maybe it's because now I'm in the South (transplant from California)
that I now appreciate chewing tobacco and UST when I didn't before.
Man, here women, doctors, lawyers, you name it everyone chews. And
I get the feeling that use is getting even more prevalent just over
the last 5 years I've been here. It's pretty stylish, I take it, and
I think that the new trendy brands are just that. Skoal and Copenhagen are
pretty powerful names though. There's 80% of the
market, but that market can expand I think. Personally, like
smoking, I find the habit pretty repulsive, but value stocks are
pretty dang rare now.

Re: addiction, I am less queasy about investing in addiction now.
No question, nicotine is a drug that should be regulated more heavily.
But so is EtOH. 80% of my patients down here smoke or chew and
most wish I'd just shut up - they make the argument that
we don't regulate cholesterol, and heart disease is just as dangerous
if not more. Funny that I'm stressing smoking cessation while I'm considering a
tobacco investment, but as I see more and more patients,
I'm getting a lot more realistic and less idealistic. Heck, half
of the other doctors chew or smoke, and almost all are fat.

Well, I didn't buy it today because I'm waiting for them to complete
their first down EPS year in like forever. I expect disgust with the
shares to rise more as the realization of stalled growth hits, and
hopefully I'll get the shares even cheaper.

MO of course is the star, but the shares have repeatedly fallen to
PE's of 9 over the last 10 years.16-19 is the upper end of normal.

Re: UHAL and debt

My 2 minute review-in-the-face-of-a-certain-family-member-trying
desperately-to-get-me-to-go-to-breakfast:

They even present their 10-Q in a confusing way. Looks like
they have well over $1B in LT debt, have negative net cash
flows after usual cap expenditures and before financing cash
flows, and have been borrowing short-term heavily to get
liquidity. Ick. I'm probably just not sophisticated enough to
see the value here, but since I buy a stock as I would buy the

Re: books

To get started, I'd suggest the following four books:

The Intelligent Investor by Graham
Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Fisher
Why Stocks Go Up and Down By Pike
Buffettology by Buffett and Clark

If you read these books thoroughly and in that order and
never touch another book, you'll have all you need to know.
Another book you might want to consider is Value Investing
Made Easy by Janet Lowe - a quick read. I have
a fairly extensive listing of books on my site, with my
reviews of them, and links to purchase them at amazon.
http://www.sealpoint.com/

My problem is I've read way too much. One book stated, "If
you're not a voracious reader, you'll probably never be
a great investor." But sometimes I wish I had a more
focused knowledge base so that my investment strategy wouldn't
get all cluttered up.

Re: Security Analysis you can get a lot of the same info

that Buffett's favorite version is the 1951 edition. Yes
there are differences, and the current version has a lot
of non-Graham like stuff in it.

Re: starter books

My problem with Lynch's books is that he didn't use those
techniques, near as I can tell, when he was leading Magellan
to those winning years.

He relied on personal visits with CEOs of major firms, a
direct line to anyone he wanted, a massive Fidelity research
group, and the last thing on his mind was value. His turnover
was incredibly high, and he often made decisions without
he himself having fully analyzed the situation. He describes
himself as patient with a turnover of 110%. But that's better
than his initial 300%.

He was very good at it, but to say buy restaurants because you
like the sandwich they serve is misleading and dangerous advice to a
beginner. Especially for someone who doesn't first understand Graham
and Buffett ultra-conservative long-term fundamental analysis.

After reading the first four books, I think Lynch's books are good for
those that want to know why they shouldn't just throw out the
auto stocks or airlines or other things that Buffett for instance
dislikes. They are also very good reading, and I think everyone
should ultimately read at least one (my fav is Beating the Street).

Re: CREAF

I don't see anything to worry about. I still haven't bought it
but I'm tempted. After buying Cambridge, it still has $4.25/sh
($400M), which means the enterprise is trading at only 6.8
times the run rate on last quarter's earnings, and the company
is now in its strongest quarter of the year. The company has
been very positive with me in my discussions. There is no
debt, and cash flows are very strong. There is a franchise
in the Soundblaster brand, and it has a new line of merchandise
based on the latest chip. Heck, if the company can simply
maintain it's current level of sales and earnings, the
earnings yield is over 15%.

Everyone is talking about the computer makers trying to speed

CREAF, which I just discussed now at about 20 1/4. PE of 6.8
and improving business with very strong finances. The whole
Soundblaster brand is on the block for only about 1.2B, which
is roughly sales despite 50% ROE.

QNTM, which is getting absolutely massacred for no reason,
now at about 24. It has the world supply on the next gen
MR head componentry, has a potent product in its DLT line,
and is now at a PE under 10, with a high amount of its
expenses in R&D. ROE about 30%.

OXHP, which is getting massacred as well, now down another
10+% today because the CEO didn't show for an analysts'
meeting. At $21, it is steal by every measure
I can come up with except management credibility, which
is getting thin.

Green Tree (GNT), which has been very successful, now is
getting slammed because customers prepaid too many loans.
IOW, the loans are higher quality than we thought, so
let's slam the stock. Doesn't make sense, but now the
stock is back at $30 from $50.

DSWLF, which Ron has been researching a lot, is also at
a single digit PE, albeit that is its historic norm. But
it is growing now, generating cash, and seems pretty well
positioned even though its in China. Completely misunderstood

Raimondas,

My feeling on Quantum is that long-term, it is no longer just
a DD company. In fact, already 40% of earnings are DLT and
that is growing at a 100% rate. This moves it out of the
commodity category, IMO. Note that it did not disappoint at
all last quarter, when both WDC and SEG were very disappointing.
IR has communicated to me that they feel no need to offer
additional earnings guidance - they just had an analysts meeting
at Comdex and could've done it there if it was overly bad.
In any case, I expect them to miss by a bit, and if they do,
I'll buy more. Then again, I have a bit of inside indusry
knowledge that is making me a little cocky here.

Sales of DLT - 1.4 billion
Profits from DLT - 240 million
Current Market Cap - 3.25 billion

So it is selling at 13.5 times this year'searnings of the DLT
business and 2.3 times sales. This is very reasonable, when you
consider they have a near monopoly on the product and the media,
and that those sales have gone from $100M to 1.4 billion in
less than 3 years. A tech company growing that quickly with
that type of market dominance might conservatively command a
market value of 20 times earnings, or 4.8 billion ($35/share).
This is also what several analysts have projected for the
DLT business, which tells me I'm not too far off.

But you have the DD too. Even if I give you that the business
is cyclical, it is still 5 billion in sales for the company,
which at a bare minimum has got to be worth .25 of sales, or
1.2B, so add that to the DLT business, and you get 6 billion
or $44/share.

I understand Quantum's management to be the best and the
most forward-looking among the dd's, and it roped in this
exclusive deal with MKE for MR technology. Quantum believes
it is 6-8 mos ahead of the competition in the MR arena.
So I would assign it's dd business a premium over SEG and
WDC.

Now, my contact is a former SEG VP who likes SEG, but grudgingly
says QNTM is better positioned now. SEG has $7 in cash, but
is fully exposed to the DD cycle. It has interesting investments
and I certainly like it too, but I don't know how to value it
given QNTM's lead in DD technology now.

So IMO, QNTM's high in the low 40's was around fair value for
the company. There will be charges of around 35M, but the market
has overreacted. Short-term, it may go lower on tax-loss selling
and institutional window-dressing (I certainly wouldn't want a
"DD" in my end-of-the-year portfolio if I was using that portfolio
as a marketing tool). But long-term, it is at nearly a 50%
discount currently, which will widen with greater contribution
and diversification of products along the high-end backup lines.

Jeffrey, re: OXHP

<<I am telling the folks on this thread that if you lose control of the
data you have a real problem. >>

Yes, but we already know they had a real problem to the tune of
>$90M hit to the balance sheet. Rather than a rate increase,
Oxford charged it off the balance sheet. Check with Oxford -
their rates are still among the most reasonable in the area,
and they have no plans to increase rates to make up the AR
charge or the AP charge. They've just swallowed it, however
painful.
This contrasts directlly with, say Aetna's attempts to force
contracts of adhesion on its doctors. When many doctors have
a real problem with a plan, the AMA knows about it, and hence
I should know about it. The Oxford mess was not a big issue at the
AMA as far as I know.

Just from the physician feedback I've received, Oxford seems
to have had a better reputation than most of being attuned
to doctor's needs than most. In the last year this has been
tainted by the claims delays, but in general physicians have
found Oxford to be understanding and innovative in their plans.
And they did advance up to $270 million as an open checkbook to
try to keep physicians happy, which most others would not have
done. This drastically reduced the anger providers would otherwise
have felt. Most importantly, the patients have been extremely
happy with Oxford.

Management, with its Freedom Plan which allows choice, its
Alternative Health rider which allows coverage of acupuncture
and the like and helped it win contracts with big "alternative
health"-employee-rich employers like Donna Karan, and its
specialty management services which is the first plan to directly
distribute some power to specialist groups; all of these
have established that management is innovative and competent.

Oxford is also moving ahead with its Florida expansion. Many
had thought that they would delay this, but their position is
that they have their IS problems under control and they are
now financially strong, so there is no reason to not expand
as planned. This will introduce their excellent management and
innovative plans into another market which does not any
claims bias.

Once again, I'll disagree and say that in the low-mid20's
OXHP has most of its problems discounted, with possible over-
allotment of reserves for claims, conservative AR numbers,
a strong balance sheet, and the likelihood of
mediocre but very positive earnings >$1 share next year,
going up from there.

I see $6 billion in revenues next year on sale for less than
one third that now. The risks are further disclosures by management,
which would be truly criminal, and Clinton, who recently
recommended further federal oversight of HMO's.

Quantum analyst opinion

This is from Lehman from a downgrade on 12/3

"While drive stock prices have collapsed to what might be viewed as compelling
levels
of valuation, we remain unconvinced that we have yet reached an inflection
point in the
fundamentals which will serve as the catalyst for a recovery in the group. Due
to lack
of visability into improving market conditions, and a corresponding lack of
substantial
improvement in the supply/demand fundamentals and related pricing
aggressiveness,
we believe
the group will continue to underperform near-tearm"

"Correspondingly, we readily admit that it is too early to re-enter the group
at this time.
Even Quantum's shares - which we believe are severely under-valued at current
levels
( with the tape business alone valued at approx. $40) - will likely remain
under
pressure until both sentiment and earnings visability for the group improves."

"However, as soon as we see evidence that the environment has stabilized, we
would
aggressively recommend purchase of the shares in the HDD sector with the
expectation of strong gains in 1998."

"Quantum remains our favorite stock in this space."

*************

IMO, the downgrade reflects analysts' preoccupation with short
term appreciation, and the rest of the wording confirms my
own analysis of the stock and the cyclicality here. Looks
like a long-term buy to me. That DLT business is like an
undiscovered asset which, unlike land, has a defined payoff
timetable (no offense to land investors).

another $200M to give before it starts getting in trouble

James, Re: OXHP

I've been posting the positives over on the OXHP thread the last
few days. I agree that the WSJ article wasn't that bad - the
last half of the article was very positive (doctors not fleeing,
patients not fleeing, adding 400,000 net next year). And the
NY Times article this morning was interesting but not entirely
accurate.

This was a huge hit though the 164M. I think that the price
reflects that, but a losing stock in December will see a hit
on news like that. And add in $28M for non-NY subsidiaries. The
loss of 120M means that operations are still profitable.
Right, but... Wiggins even now is trying to play the analysts.
He admitted only on further questioning that he was including
an $18M one-time gain on the sale of a subsidiary in that
loss. My biggest worry is management integrity.

They had 1.006 billion in premiums receivable and cash (ok'd
by KPMG). They had about 565M in claims payable. That gives
them say $450M in play. Then you take back $192M in 4th Q
charges. So now they have like $200-250M in liquidity on
their balance sheet. Not bad for a 1.6B company. But they
still have fines, lawsuits above their insurance cap,
and the "restructuring charges" that will inevitably come
down the pipe as they shut down and restructure various Medicare
operations.

Now, the patients still like them. The patients chose them
Number 1 in NJ just in September. And the patients chose them
among the top two in NY in May. And the providers aren't fleeing
(yet, at least). As a physician, I can't express how impressed
I am with that.

But now their financial stability is threatened, and the big
boys in NY (WSJ, NYT) are
reporting it. Can they keep their franchise in customer
satisfaction in New York? This is an open question. Like you say,
value investors should not be surprised that there is bad
news behind a 70 point fall from 90.

I feel duped by the company, but now the trick is to keep a level
head and figure out what I'm going to do tomorrow.

PD gets analyzed by Peter Lynch in Beating the Street.

I have a friend who works there and was trying to get
me to buy it up near 80. Evidently he's new and didn't
understand cyclicals.I've continued to track it, but
I'm not sure I do either.

It produces 1.5 billion pounds of copper, so every 1
cent change in price/lb transmits 15 million in net
profit/loss right to the bottom line - not insignificant
with a market cap less than 4 billion. It has a plan to sell
off non-core operations, and has already started
doing so, but copper is the tail that wags this dog.

I don't know quite when to jump in. Going by Lynch's
methods, the Equity - Debts of 1.8 billion should
make us feel safe that they can survive the next
downturn. I think that's a given. But when to pull
the trigger. Down again today. Any opinion here
appreciated.

You own GNT? Why and for how long? I've been looking at it.
What do you make of the recent charge? Last
thing I want is another $164 million surprise like
OXHP, but IMO GNT's customers paying back loans
quicker than expected isn't necessarily bad management
right? Good quality of loans perhaps?

Paul,

I see it the same way, but I'm getting pretty shy about
trusting management comments after OXHP and CREAF. The funny
thing is that when I started writing professionally, I
maintained talking to the company in any but face-to-face
situations colored my analysis of the numbers, so I didn't do it. But
this is journalism, not buy-side analysis - it's my job to get
quotes from the company and the analysts. And guess what, it colored
my analysis. When you have Creative's head Tech engineer
telling you how "incredible" the products are, it's hard say
wait, how about these inventories...

Down the slippery slope of cynicism. It's one
thing when you read about others getting lied to, but
when they mislead you to your own face...
I think I might add the "Lie" factor to any further analysis
I do - the more analysts in bed with management, the greater
the likelihood of funny business in the financial statements. GNT's
Lie Factor is pretty high.

Re: OXHP Let me throw this out from the WSJ

<<Oxford will also add $36 million to reserves required in New Jersey and
Connecticut, bringing its total to $1 billion>>

I don't see that $1 billion. 164 million + 36 million +
550M = 750M. Even if they are including the 90+M from the
3rd Q, which they shouldnt since it's already on the 3Q
balance sheet, the company should still have $150M in
AR and Cash above AP.

I've stepped to the sidelines until I can find out what

More on OXHP

I'm reposting this from the OXHP thread for comments here
by people that may see an error in my accounting.

The way I see it (and remember my worry is a
short-term liquidity criis, so I'm not looking
at things like plant and LT assets - if it
gets to the point that they are selling property
and equipment to pay off people, the battle is
lost anyway - bankruptcy would be preferable):

568M reserves as of 3Q end
+ 164M NY reserves
+36M NJ and CT reserves
= 768M in reserves expected at 4Q
+ 97M trade accounts payable
= 865M due in less than 6 mos

On the asset side,
659M cash and shrt term investments
354M premiums receivable (certified by KPMG)
= 1013M

So there is 148M in ST liq before charges for Medicare
restructuring/closing operations, lawsuit costs, fines
by regulators/NY Attorney General. If they are profitable,
and IF these additional charges are less than $148M or
so that is a good thing.

But are they profitable?

Est -120M loss (including one time gain of $18M)
+ 164M + 38M
gives 62 M in operating profits. But it is not clear
whether that extra 38M is included in the 120M loss
projection. In fact, when pressed in the conference,
Wiggins said he didn't know, but that the press release
says 120M so "Let's just go with that." Sheesh.

If that 38M is not included, we're looking at another
disappointment and an operating profit of only 18M (and
a total loss of $158M).
This is only half of last 4Q operating profit.
And they will be raising rates, closing certain operations,
and probably cutting back on expansion plans, so further
profit expansion is really up in the air.

So where is Wiggins getting 500M in equity (and
you can be sure he's rounding up)?
Well, plant and equipment is included there. That
is 145M less than equity at the end of 3Q.
So he really is looking at a loss of about $145M or more
all told (greater than the 120 in the press release -
again, sheesh). This is in line with the discussion
in the paragraph above that adds the 38M to the
already announced loss of 120M.

The net of it is management wasn't even realy honest
in its press release - it was more candid with the
analysts in the conference, but only on much prodding.
I'll admit it - I feel burned. Other views more
than welcome.

Let's look at HNH

It's in the same type of biz as DYA was. DYA was around 30
when it was brought up here on this thread. Moved to 45 with
WHX's original bid, and eventually hit 90. That accounts
for HNH's premium to the bid.

HNH provides diversification, is cyclical but
has solid earnings of about $2 share pretty consistently with good
ROE. To the 360M price you have to add the 120M in LT debt net of
cash. Is it a good deal for WHX? The CEO seems to be pursuing
some sort of acquisition strategy - he didn't get Teledyne
or DYA and turns to others in the general industry and
sees HNH. Looks good, so let's float some debt and buy
this sucker. That explains the senior notes (I couldn't
figure out why they were taking on more debt with their
liquidity - in retrospect we should've been looking ourselves
for the next likely acquisition - <g>).

How about WHX shareholders? Well, obviously the CEO knows
value when he sees it, buying back a bunch of WHX at less
than $10, and we know Teledyne and DYA ultimately were
worth much more than they were when WHX first showed interest.
Is HNH another example of value revealed to the world?
The market thinks so, with shares over $2 over the offer.
Will WHX get its prize finally? We'll see, but it appears
that the market has said, "We want a better price."

Is this deal accretive? It's financing the $480M
price at 9%, which is 43 million in interest per year.
1996 EBIT is 68M. So am I correct in saying it's mildly
accretive? And if the price goes up to say $40 share,
are we breaking the threshold? Where oh where has
my margin of safety gone?

Them's my thoughts.

What an individual decision for a value investor!
My goal is to own a little DD (Quantum), a little
semi (Intel, Speedfam at the right price), a little
software (?). That way I won't miss it when tech runs and
I won't be hurt too much when it stumbles. I won't resist the urge
to invest in them if only because my hometown is Silly
Valley and they are so easy to investigate there (plus
my high school buddies,inlaws and my brother are always feeding me
ideas). Dataquest is like two blocks from my house. It ain't Nebraska
and I ain't Warren Buffett, so there'll always be tech in my
portfolio. But having dealt with some of them on the inside
as a contractor and an IBM employee, it's easy to see that
many of them are rotten and you can't glean it from the balance
sheet.

I'm looking at a telecom infrastructure stock called
Spectrian (SPCT). I have a limit order at 20 tomorrow.
The stock is at 19 1/2, has 9 in cash, basically no debt,
has been killed down from above 60 but still should
make 2/share this coming year and the year after. Solid
ROE and a margin of safety in all that cash. Wish I had
seen it earlier, since it is up 2 today alone. Looks
like it got hit in October with some order cancellations
and has been subject to tax-loss selling the last month
or so.

I'd also like to bring up Deswell Industries again here.
A summary is over on my web site, but in brief, it's
a single digit PE stock with a solid balance sheet that
is well positioned to benefit from the telecom boom in
China as it operates in US dollars out of Hong Kong. It's
been brought up here before, and there's a great thread
run by Ron Bower here on SI. The MM's control it, but
long term I don't see how it can lose.

Anyone willing to give an opinion on Seagram (VO)

Interesting story that I'm trying to grasp. The Buffettology
book reveals it as a Buffett stock though it doesn't seem
to have Buffett-like ROE. There are a lot of hidden assets
and earnings power here though, and it is buying back loads
of stock with its cash flow. No use though - the stock is
at 52 week lows with no break in the trend in sight. Holds
$2 billion in TimeWarner stock plus a lot of cash which
makes for a strong balance sheet if not a bargain balance sheet.
Holds a consumer monopoly of sorts which is hidden by
acquisitions, depreciation etc. that makes accounting
earnings look bad.

low double digit growth in that next year.

UST recently announced a price increase, and its stock has

all time highs in a down market. The stock still appears to
be value by dividend, ROE, buyback, and other characteristics.
The price increase seems to argue against overly competitive

James, Re: SJP

I've been watching it closely - it's been near the top of my
list, but I'm always waiting for it to get a little cheaper
and a little cheaper and a little cheaper... Now it's falling
on very high volume. Due to the 4 million share offering
by the majority holder? If I'm reading it right, all this
will do is increase the float, along with that 3 for 1 stock
split. An attempt to increase institutional ownership over
that 20% hump? Is the market reading this as dilutive and hence
dumping shares for no reason?

At 90, I'm oh so very tempted. However, I started cashing out of many
of my stocks (85% to be exact) in November because I have
big fears about the effects of Asia's cheap currency on US multinationals, the
flood of cheap imports competing with US
companies, and hence the market. A time of great opportunity
for the value investor may be at hand, and I don't want to squander a
cent prematurely. I'm pretty sick of prospecting for poor
businesses at cheap prices during a roaring bull and look

Re: family/trust-controlled permanent values

CCN, VO. You can add Dow Jones and Readers Digest to that
list, but that hasn't stopped Michael Price from trying
to wring value out of them. The idea I guess would be
to wait for a stimulus. CCN jumped from 40 to 50 after
Viacom exercised its option to buy 50% of UPN.

SJP looks like a trust controls the bulk of it, but it has started
selling assets and buying growing businesses, and distributing
liquidations to its shareholders, and the stock has done hugely well
for our friend James Clarke here over the last year or two.

TRC spiked from the teens to 45 after it was revealed
Marty Whitman had bought a large interest from the Times
Mirror, which was doing nothing with it, and had
hired real estate experts. Problem is, the
stock was in the teens for many many years. And it's now
back at 25 as the speculation faded. As an aside, a 9/8/97 real
estate appraisal prepared for AB Edelman Value Parnters is now in
my hands and indicates the SoCal 271000 acres have a value of
around $115-130 million before bulk discounts. That should help any further
analysis here. The market cap is around $325M.

TRC and SJP were both brought up here just months before their
runs. VO down again today. I'll wait for some stability in VO
as the patient looks cold dead. At least TRC, SJP, and CCN have
shown signs of life in the last year, and had based within

Re: the market

Yeah, I see too much pessimism in the short term as well -
it's everywhere, including my web site. So this combined with
the end of the tax-loss selling should provide a great January
bounce. Especially the techs appear oversold temporarily.

But economists expect
a massive trade gap throughout 1998 as the Asian currencies aren't
about to bounce back to "normal" levels any time soon. In combo
with slow Asian economies, it sure looks like there will be an
"export or perish" mentality on the Pacific Rim. The multinationals
and blue chips are still very rich, and official estimates for GDP
growth are still 3% or so.

Once those cheap imports hit, there'll
be tech and blue chip earnings disappointments, and it is hard to
imagine GDP really growing at this past year's rates in the face of the strong
dollar.

The Dow really has hardly budged in percentage
terms , and on an absolute level the Dow along with the S&P are both
still way up there - thanks to continued mutual fund inflows
according to news today. That the market will go up indefinitely because money
is flowing in seems like a house of cards to me, though
99% of people seem to believe it true. When demographics are
driving the market rather than value, I know it's out of hand.
Not to mention good values are still rare.

Especially once the January rally is over and done with,
all those short-termers that control the Street will have
not much to look forward to for, say, 9 mos. That would strain
their brains. More downgrades. More earnings disappointments.
Etc. I think the pessimism we're seeing now is only a minor
prelude to what will happen around March and April.

The market is still above where it was when Buffett decided to
pull money out and put it in zero bonds. Just copying him
would probably be a good strategy.

Of course, this is all phooey, and the house of cards
will grow ever taller forever. After all, those 1000 people
on Wall Street that are getting $1M+ bonuses this year
are really earning it. It is awfully difficult to balance all
those cards.

One last point: does anyone know of a graph of real interest
rates? I understand that inflation is now at an annualized
rate less than 1.5%. Wouldn't that mean real rates are higher
than they were earlier this year despite the fall in the long
bond?

Jeffrey,

Gotta get some sleep, but here's some response

tech stocks have seen a 1990 style correction

Though I would say they started higher this time. For instance, 88-90
Intel's PE ranged from 8 to 16. This year PE hit 24, and even now 18
is the high end of the 86-96 historical range. Seagate was often
in the 3-4 PE range 88-90, with highs around 10-15. This year,
we were valuing it around 25 times strong earnings - for a known
cyclical that is gross error. Compaq same deal - PE 7-14 then,
15-30 this year. So there is a way to fall to hit historic lows on
a valuation basis if things get crunchy this year. It may get
that bad, but not like 73-74 where inflation in the face of
stock market losses made for excruciating pain in real terms.

large stocks could move sideways for an extended period, supported by the
effect of declining interest rates on the capitalization of mediocre earnings

If inflation is only going to be in the 1% range, we're looking at
< 1% change in real rates if not an increase in real rates. This
would be a hidden double whammy along with decreased earnings. The
same factors that are causing the decreased earnings will be
causing the low inflation/nominal rate decreases, which makes it hard
for one to truly offset the other.

while the massacred smaller stocks gradually recover

What a difficult call! Smaller stocks - since so many of them are
valueless techs these days - are so incredibly vulnerable in this
indexing world. They don't participate in the upswings very well
except at the end when institutions are desperate for stocks, then
when things get bad everyone sells them and the rapidity and
illiquidity combine to create disaster. I can't see them recovering
in the face of serial disappointments from the big names, but
that's my guess only...

Ironically, the US taxpayer via the IMF may be supporting the
very import glut that might doom earnings here! An odd form of
double taxation, but I digress...

If we really believe interest rates are going to keep falling to 5%,
there is only one thing to do - go out and load up on 10 and
30 year zeroes like our hero Buffett. It's a leveraged pure play that
will even offer diversification if disinflation plays out against
corporate earnings. If only I had the guts...

On the bright side, if a bear does result from this, you can
bet it isn't the end of the world because currencies will eventually
revert to the mean if not above it and the dollar will once again
get weaker, and those with a long view will truly have an
advantage over the short-termers.

How's that for top-down investing? I'm trying to get it out of
my system but I can't...need someone to slap me around with either
some great value stocks or some great logic that says I'm full
of it.

Good Investing,

The conclusion was that real
rates were high and would be coming down early next year.

That's what I was saying :

Wouldn't that mean real rates are higher
than they were earlier this year despite the fall in the long
bond?

The important point is not that real rates are coming down, but
that they have jumped due to recent disinflation, so we are actually
higher now. Thus, a fall in real rates is necessary just to get
back to where we were the last few years, and hence we do not
and will not have ultra-low real rates to stimulate the market.

In my last post, when I said that we would get no change
or even an increase in real rates I meant in the present and
near future, since nominal rates have not yet caught up. I
was wondering why Jefferey was using capitals, since I agree
with him on a nominal basis.

To read Graham, value investors must always be
comparing stocks to bonds, as they are in direct competition.
All I can think of are long-term Treasuries or zeroes - does
anyone else have any suggestions on how to play bonds/move
funds into bonds if one feels stocks are too pricey relative
to bonds?

their stock buyback in the face of shriveling cash flow, and
their commitment to a $1 billion two-year capital investment

pointing to a current ratio of 2.5 that is based on poor quality
assets. I see charges in the future and a management that is
not willing to own up to everything just yet due to fear
of frightening Wall Street even more.

This stock might get really cheap. But Nike won't
stay down forever. Just an idea: file away Nike as a buy
in the $20's and buy in when it gets there. This year
should prove to be an aberration, and there will be less
shares out and improving cash flows/balance sheet once
it is all behind us. Here's hoping the market
gets really inefficient.

Another point to consider, though it is somewhat off-topic,
is consumer credit card debt is at 1.2 trillion, which is $4500 for
every man woman and child in America. That is absolutely
staggering. So like half the population has credit cards, and
they on average have 9-10K in high interest debt. How a low
rate/slowing economy will affect that and vice versa will be
interesting. I admit I'm an offender, and I'll welcome lower rates,
but then my job is secure and my wages are pretty sticky. I get the
feeling that people are playing the market with blood money, which
sets us up like the 1920's if th e market crashes severely. This is
just food for thought...

I'm only concerned about this issue because I am having difficulty
finding good values, and having read too much Fisher and
Buffett-stuff lately, I'm reluctant to invest in crappy illiquid
businesses. As of now I hold Deswell (7%) and SJP (10%), and am
coming off a week in which I was short several stocks for several days
and closed out an arbitrage position with some small gains, so
I'm biased - with all this cash I would be lying if I didn't say
I'm rooting for the market to fall.

James, Re: SJP

Thank you thank you. I bought based on a thumbnail valuation
that almost mirrors yours, although I didn't know about those
Savvy Wall Street Guys and all those details about the land.
I am particularly attracted by the low institutional ownership
at only 20% (and who they are), the activist managment that
cares about the shareholders, and the >tripling of liquidity.

Moreover, it looks like Wall Street is punishing this stock
because in typical knee-jerk fashion they see dilution where
there isn't any - just increased liquidity. How else to explain
the drop upon the positive news? I put part of one trust into it,
and now I'm putting part of the other into it.

Thanks again Jim. Re: my Nike expectations, I have been
very impressed in my experience with the fact that an intelligent
investor can see balance sheet/income statement problems that Wall
Street hasn't yet reacted to or management hasn't owned up
to. By waiting for the news to break, one can often pick up
the shares cheaper. Whether the shares will go up in the meantime
and only fall back to current levels or higher after the news
breaks is up in the air, but I'd rather wait for the cat to
be out of the barn. Nike has troubles brewing that isn't owning
up to, so I think I'll wait.

Jeffrey,

Net nets are played as a basket of them as part of
a diversified portfolio and held for two years and
let go if they haven't moved up 50%. There doesn't need to be
a catalyst. Value guy Nasgowitz of Heartland Value has been
buying and now owns like 24% if I remember right.
In this case there is something of a catalyst, as the company
has been selling off non-core business and concentrating on
the specialty high end triathlete sports along with your
average runner. These serve the same general distribution
channels, and hence profitability is improving. There's
a lot to like here. At a 40% discount to net net any
risk from quality of inventory is negated.

I tried to buy at 3 3/4 today but didn't get it, so then
I tried at 4. Now I'm gonna check and see if I got it.

Jeffrey Re: HYDEA

1. No insider buying
2. A historic underperformer - current value is at low end of
historic range, but it is an oscillator.
3. relatively little impact from Asia vs peers esp Nike Adidas

I like companies with great management and insider buying -who
doesn't? But there is also a portion of my portfolio for bad
managements mismanaging assets (such as the Saucony and Hind
brands) that would be worth more under different management.
As you know, that one of about 3 things acquirers look for.
If I had 28 million and knew the shoe marketing business, I might
want to take a shot at acquiring the Saucony brand and the Hind
brand on the cheap and improving on them.

But the story here is it is a Graham net net strategy - we
are not counting on better management or acquisition, but rather
that it will fluctuate back to net quick assets as it has in the past.

Looks like net nets wouldn't fit with your style of investing.
I basically agree on PD - profits are still too fat and the PE
is still too low, but I
am interested because PD seems to be the class outfit, and long-term
copper supply/demand characteristics are favorable. Just trying

Medusa Corp (MSA)

Has pulled back 20% from this year's highs, but remains a very
well run and low-cost producer of concrete and mineral supplies
to the construction and agriculture industry.

ROE has been about 40% over the last 5 years, now trading at
about 6.7 times trailing operating cash flow. Much recent capital
investment in distribution should pay off, along with 3 1997
acquisitions. Is # 1 in several of its segments, though the
market is admittedly highly competitive and fragmented. This
really means more growth for the low-cost producer, which
Medusa is.

Debt/equity of 0.2, current ratio > 2. With housing starts up,
may be a way to play a dual-sided economy (where multinationals
and techs suffer while US basic materials companies thrive on
the rate-inspired construction growth).

The stock hasn't done much in the past year, but long term trend

Remember Sybron Chemical? I brought it up here at around 22,
and I rode it to 32.5 on a management takeover offer, but got
out as I didn't want to play the arbitration with that gain.
Paul I think you played a little arbitration with it.

Now it turns out that the management group revealed the value
with its offer. GenCorp evidently offered 38/share in cash for
Sybron. But today Sybron rejected that at the same time it revealed
the offer. Closed today at 33 1/2 on a trading halt.

This will be interesting. I guess we know the private market value
is well above that.

I used the same strategy in finding Sybron to find Knape and Vogt
Manufacturing (KNAP). It's advancing now too. The strategy is based
on ultra-low-profile boring US-only businesses with steady growth, low PE
multiples at the low end of the historic range, high management holdings, and
conservative financing.

I was reading Graham and Dodd I think when I saw that there were
several ways to ensure predictability of earnings. Buffett pairs
steady growth to monopoly situations. But you can also pair
steady growth to boring small caps that are never spoken of, and
hence more likely to be in industries not overstocked with
competition. The book may have been Copeland's Valuation, but

Best way to emulate Buffet is by owning Buffets company - BRKB or BRKA- its my
largest holding.

I really disagree for two reasons:

1) Buffett's age - sudden, bad things happen to old people who
have eaten steak their whole lives; should there be a Buffett-medical-
watch web page? It is awfully relevant to many people's investment,
yet his health problems - by now he must have a few - are never
discussed.

2) This is only releveant because Berkshire is trading way above
book value. If something were
to happen to Buffett, how would the stock react? A 30% haircut
maybe? Not to NAV but maybe to a modest premium?

If we're going to put our money with managers, it seems someone
like Ron Baron, who manages a no-load, low-tax, low-turnover
NAV mutual fund that has beaten the S&P in the last 6 mo, 1 yr
3 yr 5 yr and 10 yr periods is a better way to go. If something
sudden happens to him, our investment doesn't plummet.

Regarding ADR's on NYSE I do not see any big bargains.

I guess I would argue Telebras can be a big bargain. It regularly
oscillates between 90 and 120 (sometimes in a matter of days!)
but there is a timetable, value, and growth prospects. A simple
valuation model - the government expects minimum $20B for its
share (50%) of the company and maximum $30B. This translates to
a range of $125 to $188 in recognized value per share by the
Fall of 1998. Minimal debt, very strong cash flow, cost inefficiecies
just hurting to be squeezed out. A small step outside Brazil's
business cycle. I analyzed it for Microsoft Investor (spotlight,
1/5, http://investor.msn.com ) if you're interested. There I tried to
emphasize an understanding of the government and currency issues as
well, which are very important if one is to feel confident in Brazil.

Shares currently at 104ish. I've been telling people
(http://www.sealpoint.com ) for about 3 months to wait for
under 100 to buy. As privatization nears, I'll raise that target buy price. It
likely will hit the 90's again soon, and at that price,
Telebras is every bit the value of our good old American St Joe's
Paper or Hyde Athletics.

I also do not consider Brazilian market a great bargain now. Asian markets have
already corrected
60-80%, Latin American markets are yet to have a correction.

My take is that Latin markets don't deserve the shellacking that
Asian markets got. Brazil in particular is acting responsibly and
biting the bullet fiscally. TBR is the most liquid LatAm stock, so
it gets dumped when the general public wants outof LatAm, and it
rises when they want in. Generally, this sentiment parallels
Asia's turmoil and is irrational.

Chile has been LatAm's star. Brazil differs from Chile in that no
significant export industry has developed. Whereas exports to Asia are
a significant part of Chile's economy, the Asian crisis really means
much less to Brazil. If anything, it spurred Brazil into fiscal
tightening - a good thing.

That said, TBR trades at a value discount to its Chilean counterpart,
on a cash flow basis. Its cash flows protect it from the need to
incur debt and hence from most direct effects of short term rate
hikes.

You expect $70? That would mean the government will get
about 11.2B for its share. A B band license just went for over
$1 billion itself. There are 9 A band cellular licenses, which
if anything should command a premium to the B band licenses, coming
out of Telebras. Maybe each won't go for a billion, but you add
in the long distance carrier and the three regionals and they
don't need to go for a billion each to make $70 ridiculous.

I feel a lot of projections on TBR growth is typical enthusiastic projections
of analysts.

I agree. A slow economy will adversely affect that growth even
more. But with 11 month waiting lists for service alleviated
by foreign capital investment, I expect there to be growth
nonetheless, and it won't take much growth at all to make
the current valuation at 5X cash flow and very little debt
attractive.

The privatization and the bids coming down the pipeline put
at timetable on TBR's appreciation, and makes it hard for me
to see a fall to $70 on simple volatility, if that is your
tack. It would take a currency devaluation.

When HK unpegs its dollar, I think we will see another TBR
buying opportunity. $70 should be very unlikely.

Deswell Industries is falling for no good reason but that
it announced its calling its warrants. I talked with the CEO,

I like the prospects. It's the cheapest box maker in an
industry that has been pummeled. GTW just reported

Hyde Athletics just announced a restructuring of its Saucony

Re: OXHP

As you know, my analysis changed dramatically with the 12/9 $200M in
charges and subsequent apparent press release/conference call
cover-up/numbers games that Wiggins played. The article I wrote
certainly never anticipated the size and the misdirection involved.
I had joked a few days before that it would take
$200M in charges to get into risky territory - voila, to my dismay.

In general, my analysis hasn't changed since then - very risky but
attractive as a takeover candidate by a growing insurer seeking
national coverage/with a history of successful acquisitions. If it
can show an iota of a successful turnaround with new management, the share
price can double back to the mid-high 20's at least. But I really try to avoid
ifs, and it is speculative whether previous cash flows will be attained any
time soon if at all.

It became apparent to me, however, that the entire industry was being
hit out of proportion to fundamentals. Oxford wasn't going to recover
without the industry recovering (and possibly not even then), and I
decided to go with the greater margin of safety in the more mature Pacificare,
which I bought Jan 12 at 48 1/4 (down from ~100), as I posted at my web site.
Including FHP (which is in the end a success despite the surprises), it has
been built on successful acquisitions, and it has a 17 years of experience
running brand-name Medicare when
all the new plans are bailing on it.

It wouldn't be the first time Pacificare has feasted on others' famine and
emerged stronger. Besides, it is trading at about 6 X 97
EBITDA, and its members at 536/head were cheaper than Oxford's even
at Oxford's discount. Oxford's at 4.3 X the EBITDA it was doing, but
whether it will ever hit that again is the whole question.

Re: OXHP takeover - with insiders owning so little,
no insider buying even at these levels, shareholders growing
increasingly frustrated, and new management required anyway, I don't
see why the Board wouldn't allow a takeover at a modest premium.

Michael Price getting on board PHSYA didn't hurt my decision either,
and I must admit I jumped at the chance to get in at a cheaper price than him -
amazingly it did get cheaper despite the fact that they
announced a buyback only a few days after Price announced his
position.

I should say I have received a lot of flak for the OXHP story
and my subsequent change of opinion, and I don't really wish
to get into that all over again, in case readers are thinking they
want to discuss those aspects here. You can always e-mail me.

Scott,

Basically, I just see a lot of people overlooking a durable
enterprise because of its debt load and the Asian crisis,
both of which have nothing to do with operations long-term
and 4-5 years out will pass. At that point you will
all those cash flows flowing right to the bottom line rather
than debt repayment. Any stumble in cash flows due to Asia
will be more than made up in the future as they continue
their aggressive investment in Asia for cheap and as they
restructure heretofore very poorly managed Pizza Hut operations.

I see it as something of a near-guarantee long-term with
very little downside. As for the valuation, I would say
that it is fairly priced now only in a short-termer's eyes,
and I outlined some of the upside in the article.

FWIW, I do it by screening for enterprises at less than net working
capital and no debt. From there, I have to look at the balance
sheets, but the list is pretty small. Actually, it is very
very small, and I don't bother. Bill Nasgowitz at Heartland
Value does it. And these situations only look "guaranteed" to
me if viewed in terms of cash flows and enterprise value.

surprising to me how many tech stocks coming up on your value screens

Thanks for the feedback, Scott.

The amazing relative strength of the Nasdaq over the last two
weeks is a testament to the value in the sector. Despite the
number of times tech comes up, I'm frustrated because I just
don't know it.

On my site, I was preparing Speedfam (SFAM) as my pick of the month -
selling at 24 with 11 in cash. I decided against it on Feb 1
(it was 3/4 written) when I saw
the ballooning receivables coinciding with the Asian crisis.
My industry-insider friends say it makes a great semi equip
product. But I also saw that its cash flows are negative due
to high working capital requirement and immense investing/capital
expense that has been ongoing with no foreseeable stop given
the pace of change in the industry and their recent plant
expansion. So I said no - for the portfolio and the site.

Today? Up 27% out of nowhere. I'm out the opportunity cost
of the gain and I still haven't found a replacement pick of
the month. How should it be valued? Beats
me - I can't seem to figure it out with financial analysis.

Anyone out there that knows how to value tech and can point
in some easily understandable directions?

 If one is a value investor, why would one need or use a separate methodology

I just feel I'm missing a piece of the valuation puzzle on techs. I
like the Fisher PSR deal, but it still requires some inside knowledge
that I don't possess. I've been avoiding them, but with so many
techs hit so hard, now would be a good time for me to learn how
to invest in them. I'll run another Fisher screen and see what

Thanks, I'll take a look at IPLS and Rubbermaid soon.

In the meantime, I'll propose BMC industries. It's a high
ROE firm that took a haircut in November and is going through
a rough time. It recently sharply increased capital expenditures
just as the Asian crisis hit. Bad timing. But 5 insiders (including
the CEO and Chairman) jumped in and massively increased the sizes
of their holdings. Moreover, the company just bought back 1 mill
shares and is about to buy back another 1 mill. Evidently, the
company has faith. Meanwhile the shares are meandering
a hair below the insiders' buy prices.

BMC started ramping up capital investment in 1996 in the
face of surging demand and in order to
modernize operations in the hope that increased efficiency
and capacity would result in savings on the cost side as they
expanded. They accelerated investment in 1997 even more, which
hurt profits as Asian price competition heated up, but
now feel they have the capital improvements in place for greater
efficiency and possibly lower costs going forward. Management feels
any efficiencies will become especially apparent in the bottom
line going into the latter half of 1998, augmented by a pick-up
in top line growth.

That's their party line. My feeling is that the company really
started to grow recently and just had to pour a bunch of money into
capital investment programs to keep up. Now things have slowed down,
and the capital spending splurge is somewhat behind them. As a result,
comparisons should be good going forward. As it stands, I was
attracted by the sharp stock fall despite continued solid profitability,
consistently high ROE, a conservative balance sheet,
proven stock buybacks, and intense insider interest.

I'm satisfied, but as always, everything I post on my web site
is meant as a starting point for further research, not a
recommendation.

Jeffrey, Re: BMC

Let's see:

1) The buyback in January took place entirely in one week - the
price has been pretty stable both before and after that. It may
be supporting the bid now, I suppose.

2) They've been taking on LT debt at favorable rates (Eurodollar
or LIBOR + ~0.5%) to finance some of
1997's capital expense as well as (likely) the 1998 buyback. 1995-1996 capital
improvements were out of cash flow. I guess
we can be wary of "cap improvements have hurt us this year, but don't
worry" but then that's why the insider buying to me was significant -
most of it the very next day after the fall. Investments like the Hungarian
plant will lower costs in the future. But there are also
investments in current technologies and capacity that will
allow the company to supply future high definition markets
of many types without interupption.

3) I don't mind borrowing at today's interest rates to buy back
shares. More companies should be doing it. In BMC's case, its
earned ROE of 20%, 28%, 26%, 20%, 21%, 20%, 30% going back seven
years, which indicates to me its strong market positions in both
masks and lenses, good business economics and solid management. It
has ~20% of the market for these masks, and is the sole supplier
to non-Japanese visual display businesses.

4) If we take the management by its words and actions, we would
expect 1998's second half will see lower costs/increased unit
sales and 15% earnings growth "at least" over 1997 as the
capital expense tapers off.

The Asian problem will result in the sale of more imported
Asian TV's and monitors, so it's not a quick rebound. All 5 analysts following
it already hacked estimates (four of the five
set a low bar of less than 17 cents for this quarter) and 3 of them downgraded
the company. The stock was 80+% held by institutions so I expect a long dormant
period. The stock isn't moving like it's got
momentum players in it anymore.

Much like the car industry, the economics can sometimes be so
much better for the supplier than for the buyer. After all, how much
really extensive advertising does BMC have to do? Its margins can be
much better than Zeniths, as can its ROE.

10? Anything's possible. The Asian crisis lasting a long time or
even worsening. The economy contracting. The company appears very cheap
relative to its peers with insider buying and a logical
way out of its current disdained position, however.

Wasn't it about 5 months ago that we had this same discussion? Didn't I recall
a few of you saying the same thing - market too high,
going to cash? Now the market is higher and what do I see? At least one person
is back to fully invested- I figured he couldn't stay
out -g-. 

That would be me ;-). The way I see it, the market is moving to
new highs as if Asia never happened. For 15 years now, when the
market has moved to new highs, it meant good things. Ultimately that
will change, and this is as good a time as any.

BUT many many stocks have been killed out of proportion. In the
last months I deployed most of my cash position in these beaten-down
stocks:
PHSYA (down 50%)
MSA (down 20%)
BMC (down 50%)
TBR (down 40%)
YUM (down 30%)
SJP (down 20%)

There are others out there. The net of it is I don't know who the
heck is paying for MSFT and Gilette and the like at these
prices, but if I keep my head out of that nosebleed netherland,
I see stocks to buy that weren't there 5 mos ago. As the nosebleeders

ignoring the potential long-term effects.

%EOM----------------------
%BOM---------------------
Date:2/21/1998 3:07:00 PM
From:Michael Burry

Shorts are logical ways to use cash, IMO.
If most of the portfolio is long, it is just
a hedging mechanism. I've had success
with it in the past, so maybe I am overconfident.
I strictly do not margin greater than the
account value, but I am not
against covered writes or selling puts. I've
played options, futures, you name it. I'm
young, but I've tried a lot, and value investing
is the way to go no doubt. But it doesn't
preclude sensible shorts or options strategies.

The idea is not to write off whole investment
areas and to keep one's mind open to
possibilities. I've tried to do that, and it's
put me in a pretty good position investments-
wise over the last few years.

Re: how to short, I use technical analysis
combined with weak fundamentals going
forward. I shouldn't admit it, but hey,
I use it. I used this on Netscape at 55,
but covered too quick. I feel certain technical
analysis does lend insight into psychology, which
is what drives successful shorts IMO. I am of
course wary of getting caught on the wrong
end of an overhyped stock, but I use quick
stop losses, which got me out of Autodesk
for instance before it moved up. It's
a tricky game, but no more so than arbitrage.
I think the same principle applies in the
shorts game - calmer heads prevail. This
opinion may change as I get more experience
with them.

I'm still looking, and I've got lots of overvalued
candidates, but no great technical shorts
yet. If both criteria aren't there, I won't
do it.

Maybe I should reveal my resolutions for
investing in 1998 and beyond:
1) Write up rules and stick to them - you
all saw that in the Out of Sight Value article,
although my version is 2500 words, not
1300. I review them with every stock.
Insider trading (esp at these market heights)
seems a logical marker for me, and I am
using it more, as you can see with my
recent opinions on BMC, Tricon and Nike.

2)Don't over-concentrate or over-diversify.
All the studies I've seen say that you can be
properly diversified without diluting stock
picking ability with 8-12 stocks across
different industries. Now I consider initial
full initial positions to be 12% or less.
My 6 stock and less portfolios were too wild
and got me too emotionally involved in stock
movements.

3)Before selling, figure out all the costs
of switching stocks, do the math, and
think about taxes. This year, I am using my
financial calculator in every situation I come
across, even buy-sell decisions. It's another way
to remove emotion. The net result is that
my turnover is way, way down.

5) Continue to keep an open mind and
try new things.

Discipline, low turnover, and the proper
concentration were what I needed, and it's
working so far. Now that I see the market
is ignoring Asia again, I'm keeping
my mind open for ways to profit. Hence
the short idea.

Mike

I'm on the wrong side, theoretically, of
a stock gaining positive momentum that
everyone wants to like. What can I do?
IMO, Nike's long-term prospects are less
than what everyone thinks. My
thinking is along Armin's. What barriers
to entry? What's to prevent another
brand to get hot or the shoe mania (which
is a recent phenomenon)
to end. Nike's then stuck with overbuilt
infrastructure and a longer-term
inventory problem. My mailbox is
peppered with people saying, "you've
got a great franchise, 20% ROE, great
management...are you some kind of idiot"
and then they inevitably take the high and
mighty road "I'm a long term investor."
or the low road "I'd take Phil Knight or Buffett over
you anyday."

If everyone thinks this,
I can't stop them. And it will become
a PE 50 stock that makes no sense just
like Gilette or Microsoft or Coke. Today,
nifty fify refers to the PE. Pay anything
for large, liquid consumer brands. Price
does not matter. If it's on your store shelf
or you see it everyday, then it is worth
whatever price you pay, and investors
find confirmation in the high valuations.
This is twisted Buffettology.

My point is price does matter,
and that the stock was in hype-world thanks
to unsustainable growth that everyone overoptimistically
thought would continue forever. Even Nike,
with all their capital spending. So the analysts
bid it to the 50-70's. That hyped world
can return, no doubt.

I think of myself as a value investor, not
a speculator. I see a risky market, a stock
everyone wants to love, and significant
downside short-term that may become
long-term if any of this lasts more
than six months, which no one expects.
That was the other thing I'm getting. "Ok,
write off 4-500 million in inventory and
you still have a great franchise." But
that's like Oracle blaming Asia. There's
more to it than just a one-time event IMO.
I'll wait, thank you. I called Nike
trying to write a positive story. I came
away saying, I can't.

Remember Buffett isn't selling Gilette or
Coke, but he's not buying more now either.
We know he may not be selling because of the
capital gains, but there isn't a very good
reason for why he's not buying more even
on the recent substantial dips if he still
felt they were good values.

I'm not at all afraid of being wrong. I'm
not sure where you got that. My opinions
are broadcast to the world, and I expect
every bit of any harsh response that I get.

Everyone wants to like Nike. I have been
tied up and whipped by people everywhere
for my position. I still have confidence
in my views, and the crowd just makes
me more confident. Like I said, I still
feel firmly contrarian. And hey, I make
money by knowing more than
the market. That's what investing is about
for value investors. If I bought Nike now,
I'd be a momentum player.

Look at Nike's revenues. They outright
exploded in 96 and 97. Wearing shoes
isn't a fad, but wearing Nike's shoes
and paying through the nose for them
is. Much of that growth was in the US
(40% in 97) and that US growth is not
really there anymore.

Nike is a much more recent phenomenon
than most seem to care to think. It
is not yet a consumer monopoly, and
any pricing power it had was
a fad. I want Coke. I don't necessarily
want Nike shoes. That equivalence is
not there yet, and may not ever be there.
Your example about every consumer brand
not attaining monopoly status/pricing power is a good
one. Nike is being challenged, and it
is still up in the air which way it will
go. Nike shoes became a big fashion statement,
as did Fila.

Oracle is indeed a good example. It drifted
lower , then
got slammed from the low 30's to
the low 20's on the announcement.
People were awfully bullish, emotional,
and thinking "all the bad news is
figured into it" at 32. The only
people that didn't like it were the
ODBMS junkies and people that hate
Ellison.

What I can say is that we have a lot
of traders buying Nike and saying they'll
hold it long-term when they've never
done that before. A lot of emotion.
We'll see, but I don't expect them to
change their stripes. And Nike hasn't even
announced any really bad news yet.

Sanborn's argument is fairly vague IMO,
and it doesn't sway me. I don't see how
Nike is historically undervalued to
itself or its peers, even on operating
cash flows/EBITDA. Great, 9.5X EBITDA.
Doesn't excite me. And I don't buy his
argument that he can buy now because he
now feels it is a consumer brand name that
deserves a premium. So his view of the
valuation has changed.

That premium view gives him confidence, and
allow him to make his value argument. But
that's a big assumption for a stock that
only demonstrated a premium in 1996,
never before and never since.

He's been at it for 7 years, and he's been
successful. And I may be wrong. But if you're
argument is that I should give in and just
say, ok, "how dare you think you know better
than the market," I will say that's my job.
I will never buy the stocks that everyone
is touting as "forever" stocks, because
everyone ignores the price when they buy those
stocks. Even value investors might do well
to be wary of their own brand biases when
purchasing stocks of well-known companies.

This is a repost of a message by me on the Nike
Yahoo thread. I thought it relevant to value investing
in the Buffett way, and to understanding my Nike article.
I must say, after a brief fling with Buffett, I am moving
back to Graham/Tweedy Browne beliefs. True Buffett companies
are richly priced, and I can't afford to buy up that
much silver.

A few points do matter. As an example:

You buy a stock at 45, it goes to 80 in 3 years. That's
a 21% annual compounding return. Buy at 40, it's a 26% return.
At 35, it's a 32% return. Don't look at it as,"it's worth
80 in 3 years regardless," because most people invest
the same amount of money no matter the price. Hence at 30 they
would buy 300 shares, but at 45 they would buy 200 shares.

This means that a few points on the compounding annual return
becomes very important. $10,000 at 21% for 10 years gives
%67,275. At 26% for 10 years gives $100,856. And at 32% for
10 years gives $160,598.

In fact, the more one professes to be a long-term investor
("for my kid's kids"), the more one should pay attention to
price (and thus to a few points here and there on expected annual
compounding rate of return). Ironically, much of the
feedback on my article has said, "I'm a long term investor,
so what do I care about a few points."

I detailed this in my MSN "Buffettology" article. There is
also a "Buffettology" thread on SI that goes through it.

This is also the reason my MSN "Running after Nike" article is
framed like it is - wait for a better price. It is ok to miss a
stock in search for a sufficient margin of safety - thus
Buffett's admonition to "wait for the right pitch." Especially
when you can see bad news on the horizon. The market is more
short-term oriented than many like to believe, and it
provides massive inefficiencies for patient investors.

To invest like Buffett, target your return and wait for it. I
provide a spreadsheet to help with this calculation in the
"Buffettology" article. And I provide a 10-year version of the
spreadsheet at my web site www.sealpoint.com.

In advance, I should apologize to lovers of soundbites for the
length of this note. I know there will be a few that already
know this that will say, "that's common sense - there is
nothing in this note that can't be had by reading." You're
right.

that. Medusa's still cheap. Deswell is in HK, but it's just

Hold on!!! This is a value investing thread,
not a penny stock thread. The words and emphasis
in a recent series of posts seem to emphasize
the short-term gains in penny stocks rather
than fundamental analysis of companies. Let's
try not to stray. If you see a 40 cent stock
you like, you're all welcome to make a case
for it here. In general, penny stocks are not
investments with a margin of safety.

Jeffrey,

I've noticed the same thing. HYDEA has been the worst
performing stock in my portfolio of value stocks. However,
I regard it as a special case.

Between the HYDEA's and DELL's of the world, I found
many stocks that are valuable yet participate in market
moves, allowing me to stay ahead of the market by
a substantial margin this year.

But even these stocks have moved up too far too fast.
I bought PHSYA at 48 for the long term, but here it is
at 60 1/2. I bought BMC for two years, and it goes from
16 to 20. Medusa moves from 39 7/8 to 47.

I am spending no small amount of time trying to figure
out this good fortune, and I've concluded it's a bad
omen for the market. I think that there is a limit
to the overvaluation of the big names, and that
people are moving into liquid small-mid caps. But
they still want it liquid, as they eye the exits.

The ultra-small cap values like HYDEA and ELAMF
are not seeing any strength. Why? Institutions are
putting an extra premium on liquidity due to the
market heights. And individuals are giving up
and trading their HYDEA for Index funds and
MSFT.

The technicals of the market have divorced themselves
from the fundamental picture, even if you count
mutual fund inflows. I recently read an
interesting article that stated the baby boomer
rollover into mutual funds is less than we think.
As they pour money into mutual funds, they are selling
individual stocks, in a ratio that is not nearly
as far from 1:1 as people think.

This exacerbates liquidity's premium. I think
we've all seen this happen over the last 5 years.

Re: being in the right strategy, I refuse to believe
that long-term, buying overvalued stocks will beat
undervalued stocks. And I refuse to pay the liquidity
premium in an overheated market.

Re: an alternative. Jump in with the crowd. I've been
such a perma-bear the last year and half. I'll just
let everyone here know when I start buying MSFT or DELL.
Then you can safely leave the market ;o).

FYI, there's a "Going with the Flow" article headlining
the MSN Investor web site.

Honest Abe,

Geez, thanks for the compliment. My "brief fling
with Buffett" is an overstatement. I've been intrigued
by Buffett ever since I read Lowenstein's account.
But I never thought I could find stocks like him -
I didn't know what to look for. Buffettology spells
it out, and allows me to quantitatively calculate
the value. I was and am excited about this, but
I am less enthusiastic about using this strategy
in today's market.

I subscribe to several strategies, and I am trying
to use them to create my own unique - and hopefully
soundly grounded - strategy. My waiting for bad
news and downgrades is my most recent contribution to
adding concepts of event trading and contrarian
investing to value investing. It stems from Buffett's
waiting for the right pitch, however.

The current Barron's also downplays the

a good sign, I don't agree.

Re: Buffett stocks, I use historically
high ROE screens to find potential high
market power companies. Then I subjectively
evaluate the company for this power and
whether it can last. I am getting interested
in industrial concerns that have high
ROE due geographic/distribution considerations.
This can persist for long periods of time
without attracting attention and the
competition that brings ROE down.
Medusa, Deswell, and IMO, BMC, fit these
considerations and have attracted my

In value investing as defined by its two greatest
practitioners, Graham and Buffett, there are two
main methods of finding undervaluation - looking
at the present, and looking way beyond Wall Street
to points 5+ years in the future.

The key to knowing when to sell is to know why you bought.

If you bought based on an undervaluation of the
company's current situation a la Graham, then you should look
to sell when fair valuation is approached. You should
gladly give up any further momentum-driven appreciation.

If you bought based on future expectations a la Buffett, then
you obviously have a strong company that meets Buffett's
criteria, and may be a candidate for a long-term hold. Note that
relatively few of even Buffett's stocks meet this.
Perusing Berkshire's portfolio over the years reveals many,
nay most, are 1-3 year deals.

Man, I was this close to shorting Dell yesterday. That
would've just made my year, with Intel's news last night.
My portfolio http://www.sealpoint.com/star.html has had
a solid year, and a short yesterday may have cemented
it. As it is, I'll see how my "value" portfolio handles
another market downturn. Hopefully better than October,
when I lost 2.6% on the 27th despite being 40% cash.

That said, I will be looking to acquire Intel. It appears
the market is focusing on the short-term, when in fact
we are in a lull in the software/hardware cycle. No new
software is around to stimulate the purchase of Intel's
latest greatest products. But it will come. Intel's R&D
edge is just huge. As with Nike, I won't touch Intel
unless it's ridiculous (below 60), and I won't look at it
as a cost to me if I miss an opportunity.

Noticed Nike's bounced today as institutions run for liquid value -
bad on me, but my portfolios are up over 1% today so I'm not
throwing a tantrum, as emotional youngsters like me are prone to do.

I have no gray hairs, but I've noticed something - I monitor about
80 stocks on Yahoo that I like fundamentally for one reason
or another. Every once in a while one will just start falling
or will really light up the screen with a large daily percentage
loss, like INTC is doing. That will cause me to look into it.
And sometimes, one of these stocks will just look like a can't
lose situation. And sometimes, the stock will remain there
long enough for me to do my due diligence. And sometimes,
when I like a stock, I'll actually end up buying it. So missing
out on a lot is part of my strategy.

YUM, SJP, BMC, MSA, PHSYA, ELAMF, DSWLF, and TBR were all values
found by being patient and waiting for my price. And they've
proven solid so far - more my strategy than the stocks
themselves, I presume. HYDEA is the only one that I didn't
have to wait on since it'd been flatlining so long.

Like I said, I look on myself as young and in an experimenting
phase. I've only been investing now 6 years, and I feel like
it's just in the last two years that I'm seeing a light. I wasted
a lot of money on so-called growth/momo investing - in 1992, my
total return was 14% on over 100 trades with >1000% turnover,
cut to 5% by commissions and then cut again by taxes. And in
1996, I was there sifting through the broken remains of tech
during April-July 96, but bought and sold too early on just about
every stock I had. I moved to value investing just under two years
ago, if that - my summer 96 foray into tech was a first
experience. Recently I incorporated a 10-stock goal concentration
for my portfolio, which I like a lot. Can I be overdoing the
patience-on-the-buy thing - another newish concept for me? We'll see.
But I took the 10-stock goal from statistical studies re: risk,
and I'm taking the waitnsee approach from Buffett. I'm not
presuming to re-invent investing.

I am reading every reasonable book on investing I can
find. I've just finished Mike Murphy's tech stocks book -
my biggest frustration has been an inability to value tech stocks,
so I'm trying to correct that. Based on his methods, techs are
way overvalued as a group, but there may be individual values.
I don't agree with everything he says, but overall he is
a long-term investor looking for values. I liked the book.

James,

Let me ask something - why weren't you buying Nike at 36-38 or
INTC at 66-68? It appears you are buying at 42-45 on Nike and
75 on INTC, althought both Nike and INTC languished for extended
periods of times significantly below these levels. I'm sure
you were aware of them at the lower levels (as was the
world). INTC's fall is spectacular today, but does that help you make
your decision? Or do you see a fundamental change that you
like relative to when the stocks were lower? I monitored
both stocks from higher to lower and now back to higher again,
and they never hit my buy point, so I'm just curious.

Re: HYDEA/B

HYDE is up today on huge volume -g-.
Latest SEC 13G indicates that Bill Nasgovitz of Heartland
is still buying shares and is up to 28.8% of the B shares. He must have been
the only buyer in recent months. Recently the B shares were selling for the
same as the A shares. Though
I own the A shares, only the B shares get any future dividend,
so they are the better buy given the same price.

Reviewing the last Q report, backlog was up when most shoe
cos except Adidas were reporting down. Saucony is an undervalued
asset, and I am moving toward looking at HYDEA as more than
a net net, though for now I would still sell at net asset
value. The Yahoo thread is all doom and gloom "I'm getting
out of this dog but I can't cuz there are no buyers." The
way I look at it, they've cut businesses, acquired businesses,
and even made a half-hearted marketing effort in the last
two years. And they're profitable. My other net-net JBM
took off from 2.5 to 4 in short order on a single acquisition
announcement. Sometimes it just takes recognition.

HYDEA looks like a good private business, but a lousy public
one, as someone on the Yahoo thread said. With its float getting
smaller, it wouldn't take much for someone to realize that
there's no difference between the two and bid the price up.

It's no coincidence that on a bad day for the
markets I'm posting like crazy - I'm just giddy
in times like this.

I want to clarify my post on Mike Murphy's book.
I like his underlying approach, but he doesn't follow
his own advice with his stock picks. And I don't
quite believe "growth flow" although it might point one
in the right direction. He has good reviews of the major
industries, and the strategy is there. Looking over his
own picks, he doesn't follow that 15% ROE rule very well.
Nor does he follow his <50% downside risk rule well.

That said, here's something about the book and him
that makes him sound like Wade Cook and may dissuade
anyone here from buying the book. It's from the Boston
Globe in February.

Michael Murphy is a man with a message: The "New Economy" is technology,
and investors stuck in the "Old Economy" are destined to be left behind.

It doesn't matter if you buy technology stocks or technology funds, says
Murphy, the
founder and editor of the well-known California Technology Stock Letter. The
point
is to buy technology - and BUY IT NOW!

Murphy was in town yesterday, hawking his vision and his book, "Every
Investor's
Guide to High-Tech Stocks and Mutual Funds" (Broadway Books), which is getting
good ink in places such as The New York Times and Business Week. We know
Murphy from his daily CNBC ads, and somewhere along the way yesterday we
asked him what kind of numbers his newsletter put up last year and how it
stacked up
against the competition.

"I'm not sure. I just haven't seen them," said the 56-year-old Murphy
curiously. An
investment letter writer not able to cite his most recent returns is a little
like Wade
Boggs not knowing his batting average. What's the chance of that?

Let's just say the numbers aren't what you want to take out on your next book
tour.

In last year's roaring bull market, Murphy's model portfolio produced a loss of
36.7
percent while the Wilshire 5000 was up 31.3 percent. That ranked Murphy's
letter
number 140 of 142 newsletters followed by Hulbert Financial Digest, which has
long tracked the advice business.

The numbers get better over the long term, but not a lot better. Over 10 years,
his
letter was up 135 percent, vs. 405 percent for the Wilshire. Hulbert says over
15
years the California Technology Stock Letter is up 124 percent, compared with
911
percent for the Wilshire, ranking it 24th of 30 letters over that period.

We're going to pay $27.50 for the book or $295 a year for the newsletter for
this?

Murphy's record illustrates perfectly what a few stinko years can do to an
investor's
bottom line. The California Technology Stock Letter did do very well for a
decade
starting in 1986, and was in fact rated the number one newsletter by Forbes in
1996.
But the letter was a loser from 1983 to '85 and has had a couple of bad years
of late.
The result is what you see.

In picking stocks, Murphy focuses on research and development spending and an
unusual approach he calls "growth flow."

Murphy says his growth flow concept is a little like tracking cash flow. But
instead
of using depreciation as analysts use in valuing "the old industrial economy,"
growth
flow combines earnings per share and R&D per share as a way of capturing the
intellectual capital that is so important to New Economy companies. He then
divides
growth flow per share by the price of the stock to determine the "crucial
ratio" for
buying cheap stocks.

"That's all there is to it!" Murphy tells us on Page 137. Well, maybe not quite
all.
Murphy says Michael Metz, Oppenheimer's chief investment strategist, has
started
using growth flow. In an interview, Metz said growth flow is "a beginning," but
adds
that it has "many shortfallings."

High-tech companies, in particular, can spend hundreds of millions on research
only to have an entire sector leapfrogged and become obsolete overnight, he
says.
"Suddenly the whole thing goes down the drain," Metz says.

Certainly the world has not been going Murphy's way.

Three mutual funds he started late in 1996 did poorly last year. The Murphy
Technology fund was down 17 percent and Murphy New World Technology
managed a bare 0.35 percent gain; meanwhile, the Morgan Stanley High Tech index
was up 17 percent. The Murphy Biotechnology fund was up about 1 percent,
topping
the Standard & Poor's biotech index, which was down about one-half of 1
percent.

Murphy says his mistake in '97 was betting big on biotech in all the funds and
doing
it on margin, which magnified the losses. "We thought 1997 would be a year of
biotech," he says. "We think this year will be the year for biotech."

The good news for investors: There is just $ 5.5 million in the three funds.

Besides California Technology Stock Letter, Murphy also publishes Overpriced
Stock Service, which he touts as "the premier short-selling investment advisory
newsletter in the world." Hulbert's numbers for that newsletter: down 16
percent for
one year, down 85 percent for three years, and down 89 percent for five.

What's Overpriced? You can figure it out. Here's hoping the book sales are
going
better.

Motorola is interesting to me, but I'd look more seriously at Motorola
at 45. That would let me buy at a discount to sales, at a price half
its speculative high, and at about 2X book. I like the
significant bearish "can it survive" sentiment re: it's analog
legacy and the new technologies.

Its balance sheet is good, S&P's actions
notwithstanding. That said, I'm not looking to buy much right now,
as I expect the market to be topping (no surprise). I would have to
see a steal. Motorola isn't there yet.

You're not missing anything big. Dell's whole edge is its
inventory management, which has allowed it to avoid the inventory
problems of every single other PC manufacturer. It rarely
gets the highest marks for quality, and just as rarely gets
the marks for customer service.

Micron, Gateway and the other direct sellers have to
replicate the inventory system in place at Dell. No simple task,
but doable over the next year or two. And then Dell loses its comparative glow.
It will still dominate corporate sales, but it
becomes a widely recognized pure commodity business that is cyclical
nonetheless and hence not worth 54 times earnings at the top of its cycle. It
seems like an obvious short to me. The last 20-30 points
were all speculators blowing off the top of the stock, IMO.

I actually tried to short Dell Friday afternoon, but the order
didn't go through in time (although my computer said there
were two minutes left, the market was "fast moving" and mine
wasn't filled in time - figure that one out). I saw it go back
to near its high at 138 1/2 and just couldn't stand it any longer -
it was too obvious a short.

Well, I was right. Today it stands at about 126 pre-split. My
idea of shorting is to start positions on value/technical basis,
but exit on pure technicals. That's how I'm doing it. I haven't
had my head handed to me shorting anything yet, because I short
at technical inflection points with tiny buy-stops. My buy stop
on Dell was 140, or less than a 2% loss.

I'm not shorting anything else right now - I want future ones
to be as obvious as Dell. IOW, I still want the margin of safety
in the short - both technical and valuation tools have to be
extreme. I look at it as arbitration and special situations - a toppy
market tool for value investors who have the inclination.

Hewlett Packard is always respected and reviewed favorably. My

safety in its product diversification, and relatively low valuation

HYDEA hasn't had the same problems so far - their backlog is
growing. Together with Adidas, they're the only two publicly
traded athletic shoe firms I know of that have this "problem."

Of course, the entire reason I bought HYDEA was because it
is a proitable net net. For now at least, my goal is just
under $6 in two years. Not that high - that gives it a
PE of about 15 if it can simply maintain its current
earnings. I am currently evaluating HYDEA for an even
longer-term hold based on improving business fundamentals,

Well, on the subject of patience and waiting for the price - a
subject about which I have been somewhat stubbornly extreme of late -
let me just relate how I recently lost money by ignoring my
own rules and advice.

I recently purchased Swisher International (SWR), knowing that
inventories were high, that the cigar fad was fading, and that they
would not be able to improve as drastically in the near future as they had in
the recent past. The stock price was down near 52 week lows,
and the valuations all looked in order -~60% ROE and a P/B of
1.2. Insiders had bought at the 14.5 range last year, and I felt
comfortable buying at 15. So I did.

If I had only applied the same logic to this one as I had to Nike.
I failed to notice that all the analysts still had strong buys
on the stock. The day after I bought, the company preannounced -
earnings and revenues would be flat with last year. I think,
we knew this - last year was stellar, and in any case even with
flat earnings the numbers are still great. As the stock opened
the next morning, I noticed it didn't budge. Great. Dodged a bullet.
I patted myself on the back.

No shares traded until the downgrades. Then came the downgrades.
4 X the avg daily volume traded in short order,
and the stock fell over 10% to 13, which is where it stands
now. Since my original position was a partial position, I'll
now convert it to a full position.

I am still comfortable with the stock, and it's a long-term holding -
it's a 137 year old company and I bet it won't be going down the
tubes, but I didn't get the best price despite having all the knowledge
necessary to do so.

Nike has had a bit of a low volume suckers rally here to 47. The
shorts may become the true suckers when Berkshire posts its annual
report this Saturday on its web site - Nike shares would surely
jump on any positive mention. We'll see if I pay for my patience
with Nike, but I am thinking I won't. Patience hasn't hurt me yet.
I'll try to remember that.

Ok, it wasn't a no-brainer, but this is: buy it now. This merger

a lot of panicked investors who couldn't believe their luck sold,
causing it to fall over 4 points from its open. I'm holding this
one for the long term still. I'll get my Southdown shares and hold

Paul, I apologize. Yesterday I said buy it now (which
was totally irresponsible), and today I just sold half my position.
The reason: I still like the company and the merger, but I got
carried away. I have a 50% gain in just two months.
A rule I have been toying with is:

When you buy a stock for discount to intrinsic
value, sell 1/2 if the stock gains 50% in less than
a year. If it gains 50% in more than a year, evaluate
for long-term hold/quality of business.

So today, after checking my emotions, I
enforced the rule. I sold half my Pacificare and half
my Medusa. It's hard to do that to my best stocks -both
of which I really like - but that's probably why I should.

I now have money for two more positions - my four stock
portfolio became a six stock portfolio became an 8
stock portfolio then a 10 stock , now a 12? Pretty
soon it'll look like yours.

Again, I apologize for the switch.

That's a limitation of the rule. But my logic is

1) It removes my emotion and greed from the sell
2) I should be happy with 50%/year, let alone months
3) I am not selling everthing - I still own half the
number of shares, which is 75% of the original
monetary investment.
4) It reduces the volatility of the portfolio as the
the portfolio becomes less top-heavy.

Personally, I feel very satisfied knowing that I've
got the gain, a loss is unlikely, and there is still
money working in the stock.

BTW, I am really interested in HWP, and am looking to
buy next time it touches 60-61. I see a business at
near fair value, but with a proven history of growth,
a diverse base, judicious use of debt, 20% ROE, and
a stock that has done nothing for about a year. PE is
20, but I would be looking at it as a Buffett-like
long-term hold. Any opinions?

until at least Spring 1999, but they're backing 1.92 for
fiscal 99 with single digit/teen earnings next quarter.
So we're shooting back to 40-50 cents late this year?
Cost-cutting might get them there, but they've still
got to charge off those inventories and the job cuts
are a tiny fraction of their recent hiring. Didn't
they recently build a world headQ - the sure sign

It says something about the emotional nature of stock-picking
that so many ideas here are generally ignored. Many of us do-it
ourselfers just love homegrown ideas the best. That said, I've
made significant profits off several ideas here, and it is hard
to say what it is that makes me follow up on certain ones and
not others - probably how they are presented.

Ironically, I am horrified that someone actually acted on
something I said and that it turned into a daytrade - eegads
more money to the brokerage industry.
I don't think I've ever used the words
"buy it now" before and I never will again. That said,
I'm not at all down on Medusa - I still have the equivalent
of a 75% initial position in it. But an investor giddy
with his gains is likely not the best person to turn to

I am just wondering why you are posting here? Most here, including

You obviously know this. I just don't even feel like it's worth
my time to write the required essay in response to your statements.
Most of the regular posters here are well aware of MPT and the flavors
of EMT and have rejected it. I think you're looking for a different

As a tip, I would just say that posting unsubstantiated self-congratulatory
statements will only perturb those of us that
a)don't know you and
b) haven't seen any prospective public record of your success.
c) recognize many complete idiots are making a killing over the

Wow, this is getting really interesting. People (read: more
than one) are taking time out of their day to come the value investing
thread and tell us how irrelevant value investing is. At about
the same time, friends and acquaintances are losing all patience with
my talk about value but perk up when someone says "this one
will double by December." These are the same ones that say, "I'm
making 40%" and expect it to continue. Recently two people approached
me about helping them do commodities for even bigger gains - 30-40%
in stocks isn't enough. One of them thinks commodities aren't enough,
he wants options on S&P futures.

As I run a value investing web site, I can also tell you that
I approach 200 hits/day when the market shakes out like in October
and January, but am down to 60-70 hits/day now. People don't need
ideas - they know to just pile into the stocks everyone talks about,
a strategy that has worked well the last 15 years.

I tell my editor that Dell at 140 is an albatross that has just
been shot, and he says no way, the money flow is just too
strong. That money flow brought it to around 122 pre-split within
a few days.

Certainly is interesting...last year I was bearish on valuation, but

I would say that many of the ideas that were most ignored
here turned out to be the best. James Clarke screamed St. Joe
at us when it was half it's current price just a year ago.
He was even adding "SJP" to the end of his notes after his
name and still most of us ignored it. IMO, consensus is not
the goal in any event.

If most people are declaring value investing dead, and most
value investors are fully invested, then I don't see that as
personally bad (though it may be for the market). The result is a

Interesting. Looking at my portfolio, though I didn't intend it this
way, it's 30% foreign (TBR, ELAMF, DESWLF) 40% US (SJP,MSA,PHSYA,SWR)
and 30% multinational (BMC, HYDEA, YUM). Just going where the
value is, and the US is more expensive. I especially can't believe
the discounts that are placed on TBR, ELAMF, and DESWLF compared

Re: JBM

Jan Bell Marketing was a stock I brought up here I think,
definitely on my web site, and then as my first stock on
Microsoft Investor. It was a net net at a true 2/3 of
net working capital less liabilities. Looked like crap, but
as I pointed out, was working on the inventory, had good
cash flow. When the story ran it was at
about 2 3/4. 2 5/8 was Graham's net net 2/3 criteria.
Now it's around 5. Take a look at the following report:

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980318/jan_bell_m_1.html

Simply amazing numbers. They did everything the CFO told
me they would do. My first professional double, yet I actually
managed to lose money on it, buying at 2 7/8 and selling at 2 3/4.
Even now at a double, it lookslike one of the remaining U.S. values
out there. Net working capital is up to 110 odd million and the
company is selling just above that. It's got 48 million cash.
No debt.

Also, St. Joe's is back at 32.5, below net asset value by
my calculation and down from a recent 36.

Paul,

It's not hard to see what the problem was. I ID'd my own problem late
in 1997: it all comes back to portfolio concentration and the antsy feelings
that come with owning very few stocks. The other issue was that there were
constant cash withdrawals from the account - 40% of
that account went out the door last year. Now I'm
dealing with money that isn't needed for at least 10 years.

When I only had 4-6 stocks, it was hard to sit on a JBM
and HYDEA as 1/3 of the portfolio. Too illiquid and
manipulated by MM's. It's easier to be patient when the bid/ask on
something like HYDEA doesn't eat up 2-3% of your portfolio each day.
So far in 98, I've had just two stock sales, but I still have >7.5%
positions in each, so I basically own everything I've bought this
year.And my portfolio swings haven't been more than 1% in one day on
the downside all year. Never more than 2% even on the upside.

This peace of mind, and in my opinion more disciplined and successful
investing, has come from a 10 stock portfolio. In my reading,
I rarely see anyone recommend a 10-12 stock portfolio, though it
eliminates about 90% of the non-market risk. Going to 16 stocks
only takes you to 93% and going to hundreds of stocks only gets
you to a few more percentage points.

Still can't explain why I didn't buy JBM when I saw it at 2 5/8
in January though...

Not true. SJP, HYDEA, DSWLF, and TBR all bought in 1997, just
benchmarked to Dec 31st.

10-12 positions way too risky
I don't see it that way. Non-market risk is about 90% eliminated
at that level, and it takes orders of magnitude greater numbers

ALR is one of those small cap ultra-value stocks

Re: HMAR

It seems in value investing, one can often ignore bad
business economics if one knows how to identify the going
rate for dogcrap and pay half that. Reducing costs and
paying off debt can make even dogcrap realize an intrinsic value
higher than the market price - granted, this is not a Buffett
approach but a Graham one, and the holding period should
be appropriately shortened.

Hvide appears on its way down. If it retests its last low
at 15, then we're paying 1X book and sales and just about 10 X
earnings for a profitable business, giving us a 12-15% ROIC vs. <10%
if we bought above 20. That looks like a half-price sale to me,
and is attractive to me even if it is dogcrap.

I bought Broadway & Seymour (BSIS, 500 shares at 7 3/4), Applix
APLX(600 @5 5/8) and MapInfo (MAPS, 300 @ 11 5/8). I did this
this past Friday. They are all small software stocks with loads

my Lancelot portfolio. Though I would normally take a larger
position in one stock, like BSIS, and I know three does not

I would update my position as an avid buyer below 120. The situation

says that all 12 will be NYSE ADR's. A knowledgeable poster on
the TBR thread doubts this, but nevertheless the privatization
is going as scheduled. 3 years from now, I can't imagine more
of a lock than buying TBR at 120 or below now. Brazil is growing,

The Telebras piece is interesting, but again it's nothing new.
I feel it is a very very big deal that all 12 pieces will trade as

and US investors.

Along with Deswell, these are my three biggest investments.
I've said enough about Deswell. If it ever falls below 20 again,

Anyway, Callaway is another company that is getting punished

Hewlett Packard derives only 20% of its sales from PC's.
What a great opportunity to pick up a technology stalwart

If I'm going to invest in PC's, then I'm going to invest in
Micron Electronics (MUEI). I just finished shopping for a PC,
and there's no doubt they were the only ones that could

no debt and there's a substantial amount of cash, and
yes, there's a research department. A visit to their web site
shows they are finally getting it right. They seem to be
implementing the JIT model well. With their operations getting
in line, they become an easier takeover candidate and should
move to more fair valuations.

Sorry for the long note. I can't update my web site or write
articles since I have no PC (it crashed and burned), and
this is an easy outlet.

James,

I've done some reshuffling as well. The sealpoint portfolio is
now about 25% cash, and that cash will be used to pay off
a 9% mortgage. Once that's paid, the portfolio will be
100% invested again. What did I sell? Swisher, Pacificare,
Medusa, and ALR. Swisher and ALR are tax loss partial offsets for
the profits in Pacificare and Medusa. If I was bullish on the
market, I wouldn't play this game. I hope to buy back Swisher
and ALR cheaper.

Another portfolio is now 23% invested in the Prudent Bear Fund.
It rose nearly 11% on October 27th, and "The Bear Book"
brought it to my attention. This portfolio is
the one that is short Nike, and long Ciena and HP along
with Deswell, Telebras, and St. Joe. I'm looking at the
best way to take a 10% Asian position in this portfolio as well,
knowing that Telebras and Deswell move with Asia.
I invested in APF when it looked cheap at 10, and got out
around 9 5/8 thankfully. So I'm a bit burned on it. Also,
Barton Biggs touted the Fund in his roundtabe, while it
turns out that some Morgan Stanley funds were actually
selling it.

It's nice the market has given
us this extra cushion by running up so high - I've been
fully invested the last 4 months - but now it certainly feels
like time to take some equity off the table.

Jurgis,

I agree that the market level is deceptive. There
are companies that look attractive. I list them here
and there and everyhwere. But more and more
it is obvious that the value candidates I find really
do have something seriously wrong - something
that depends as much on chance as Ciena
hitting the next earnings number. This degradation
in the quality of candidates - and the rise of
virtually all of my "value" stocks - tells me that
the market is hitting an extreme level.

I feel that value investors have an edge as market
timers. We know when the there is a general
decrease in the quality of our candidates. I'm
certainly seeing it now. With the confirmation
in the broader market ratios, I'm wary
and am backing it up with shorts and decreased
equity weightings. The Nike short, to me, is
a good short. But the market has been tearing
straight up. Nike just stands there. What if
the market had been declining 10-20%? Given
Nike's problems and its performance during
this blowoff, I'm sure it would exaggerate the
decline.

Value investing is my main vehicle, but if I were
to not add my own wrinkles to the game, then
I might as well throw my money in with Tweedy
Browne or Marty Whitman, as surely they
know traditional value investing better than me.

Re: how and when to protect ourselves

The best recent book on the subject is called "The Bear
Book" by Rothschild. Though a bit repetitive in the
middle, it is a quick read and gives plenty of ideas about
what to do should you expect a bear. Since I agreed
with most everything in the book, of course I liked it.

Where to go? Dividend-paying consumer staples.
Asia - he tells us which countries don't correlate with
the US (Korea, Japan are two). Cash. MO. What to
get out of? Latin America/Mexico. Cyclicals. There's
lots of ideas.

If you have an opinion on whether it will be a deflationary
or an inflationary bear, then there are other options.
Obviously, zero coupons for the former. The pros/cons
of gold are discussed.

There's a lot of history in the book, enough to steel
up those of us taking the bearish position.

What am I doing? A lot of what's in the book. The
book helped accelerate an action that I already started -
moving funds out of US equities and into Asia and cash. I'm
doing that a variety of ways. It also turned me onto
the Prudent Bear Fund, which sells stocks short.
Obviously it has not done well, but for a fund that
has been short the last few years, I'm impressed it hasn't
gone under.

And she says past indicators of market valuation may be have to be rethought

That's what gets me. It's as if every 30-40 years, people judge
the generation two generations above them as somehow
dumber. The idea is, we're smarter now. Whether it's infotech
change, graying demographics, globalization, or
portfolio insurance, bull markets create excuses for a populace that
wishes to have greater tolerance for higher valuation levels.
Yet bear markets happen anyway.

Re: a book from a brokerage insider, I can't imagine that
it would be bearish. Nothing could be more antagonistic
to the brokerage's purpose than a bearish book. Of course,
at least she makes the comparison from 42 to 66. I wonder
why she didn't bring it all the way up to 71- when the bull
really finally started to crack. Is she implying that it's ok because
we have a few more years left?

The Bear Book has some revealing inflation-adjusted statistics for the
"buy and hold" cult. Obviously, if you buy and hold Microsoft early
in a bull, no problem. But buying and holding "the next Microsofts" is
much more troublesome, even if you aren't dealing with a market
that is historically too rich. And the rich markets of the late 60's and
late 20's brought >15 years of losses to those that bought
and held within two years prior to the peak.

It is shockingly revealing to me at least that Disney went from
the 60s to 6. But it seems most people today think, "how stupid
of those people to not buy it at 6," and hence miss the point
entirely.

Re: the advance/decline line, I wonder about is usefulness now.
When stocks go up because more money is being forced into
the market rather than because valuations are attractive, I would
expect the A/D line to be more a reactor than a predictor.

Re: interest rates, could it be any more perfect? Could the
dollar be any stronger? Could the threat
of inflation be any less remote? Of course it looks perfect. Stocks
are well above the level before the Asian crisis because
of this. So should we shoot for 30X earnings - that's only another
10-15% on the market. Or should we prepare for a retracement
to 5-10 X earnings, as history shows us can happen soon after
perfection is attained?

I'm more inclined to do the latter, but of course to each his own.

James,

Except for a few choice US stocks, I am considering getting
out of most us stocks and moving to foreign stocks. That
won't win me any buy and hold awards, but that is not my
aim. I have spent the last few days looking overseas and
I am convinced that several of the bear markets abroad are
presenting some excellent opportunities. I already have Telebras,
Deswell, APF. But I'm thinking of a more wholesale switch
to go where the value is.

As you suggest, it is unrealistic to believe that US value stocks
won't get hit just as hard as the rest of the market in a true
bear. My short strategy is less appealing than simply moving
overseas and continuing to play the long side. The extraordinary
strength of the dollar can only help
overseas investment, as it will eventually tumble.

I know a few like your relative. Two or three stocks and they've tripled their

What's interesting is that if you use the dividend discount
model to value stocks, the current low rate environment
gives absurd discount rates that results in even more
absurd "valuations." Nevertheless, these absurd valuations
are being reached, essentially bringing many stocks in
the market to the 5% expected return range, in line with
money market funds. Heck, even the Travelers/Citicorp
merger looks like it gives less than a 5% return on investment.
So not only are individual investors paying the absurd prices
for stocks, but the companies themselves are acquiring
other companies at these insane prices - in stock transactions, of
course.

I do own businesses I like, and I will leg out of them and into
India, Japan, South Korea and other markets that have been
absolutely crushed. But I cannot justify selling at the current
prices. Tricon at 33, Ciena at 48, Hewlett Packard at 67 - these I can
sell, but not until they show weakness, and they all showed
relative strength in today's down market. Deswell at 19, Telebras at
120, BMC at 19, Applix at 6, St Joe at 33, Hyde at 5, Elamex
at 7 - these are clogging my portfolio with longs, and I have no
good reason to sell no matter any weakness they may show.

The Prudent Bear Fund, the Nike short, and initial positions
in the Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific Fund and the India Fund
are the starting points for my US bear strategy.
I'll likely buy more of the India Fund and initiate a position in
the Korea Fund soon.

I already sold off a 88% long US stock/12% cash IRA portfolio,
moving the money into 33% dividend stocks, 20% small caps,
33% cash, 15% emerging market debt, and 15% Japan/Asia.
I just made these moves Monday.

Yep, I'm bearish. I even started a "Bear!" thread here
on SI if anyone is interested. Long candidates I like are
of course Swisher, Adaptec, Jones Medical @ ~26, but
I just can't bring myself to initiate more US longs right now.

A guaranteed 9% after tax return

Keep in mind I usually don't mean my money when I say
"I invested." There's really 4 family portfolios that I'm managing.

Personally, I'm up to my ears in med school debt and generally don't
have the cash to invest. In fact, the last time I invested my own
was in late 1996. I took what money I had a that time
and plowed it into a guaranteed 9% by paying off loans - in
retrospect not the right decision.

That said, I've moved the sealpoint portfolio to 26% cash in order
to pay off the last of a 9% mortgage - giving a guaranteed
9% after-tax return. Now it's 100% long stocks again, and I'm looking
for other guaranteed high returns in that portfolio.

The portfolio that owns the prudent bear, is short nike, and
has taken stakes in APF and the India Fund also is long
Ciena, HP, SJP, Deswell, Telebras, Elamex. In other words,
three US longs making up less than 25% of the portfolio. No guaranteed 9%
options available to me in this one. Same goes
for the retirement fund.

My personal accounts? Well, I finally got a lump sum to invest,
and used 2/3 of it to pay off 8-12% debt, and am holding the rest in
a 5% MM account - in my local bank, far from Wall Street.

In other words, that guaranteed 9% is elusive, but I'm jumping on
it where I can. Last time I was this paranoid, the market ignored
me and romped ever upward.

Jurgis,

James will have to answer for himself, but realize that he has
big gains in this stock, and he bought it when he was the only
one who saw the potential. If you check out his posts on the
Motley Fool boards, he was like the oracle of delphi on this stock
going back the last few years.

When a stock has done everything he thought it'd do, and now
he's counting on management and incremental gains, I can
see why he'd sell.

St. Joe is not now drastically undervalued. But by my calculations
it is at the low end of its net asset value range, with only
upside in every area and very little if any downside. You have to believe in
management. I talked with an officer there, and he made
me a believer. I've also poured over every inch of their SEC filings
in the last two years, and I didn't see anything I didn't like. That's
very rare for me. But if you don't believe in management, it's hard to see the
potential in the stock, even if you see the leverage in

James, you seem to have put a lot of thought into the
tobacco stocks. You really like MO, and heck, at 37, I like
MO. But you don't seem to mention UST much. It's approaching
a 6% dividend, albeit with a 2/3 payout. But is that dividend in
danger? If not, it's hard to imagine that the stock could fall much
further, and in any case you get a 30- year bond rate for holding.
And it has 1/4 the debt load of MO.

I need to look at it further. I was early with Swisher, no doubt. But
MO held up well even during 72-74, and I'm interested in that
kind of stock. Tobacco is just so hated now I'd like to play it -
at the right time and in the right stocks. Any further insight you
have is appreciated.

BTW, there is a new drug out, called Zyban. It helps people
quit smoking and it really works. A pill that gets people off
cigarettes. It's really a double dose of the anti-depressant
Wellbutrin (generic: buproprion). There's a lot of potential here,
and I have requests for it from many of my patients. Long-term,
I wonder about the impact on the efficacy of smoking cessation

My opinion on ENMD:

IMO, what they are saying their drug does is the
only realistic shot at a cancer cure. Halting
mitosis, immunologic targeting - these have
had a run. But for the last several years doctors
have known that the key to killing cancer
(and curing diabetic retinopathy and other
diseases) is cutting off its food supply - the
new blood vessels that are requisite for
tumor growth.

Angiotensin is the first drug to show possibilities
on this front, and it is exciting indeed.

But, doctors have known about this for
quite a while. Entremed has had its run
due to the speculative fervor in the
market place. Did you see the other
unrelated "cancer" companies rally today?
Pure stupiditiy.

Entremed is no Bre-X or Centennial. It is
a bonafide ethical biotech, with two potential

Re: "historical discounts" for net nets

This just does not seem to be relevant. These are
not CEFs. A few observations:

1) We are in no way imitating Graham by buying one
or two net nets at the top of a bull market. 3 profitable
net nets found in the last 2 years of looking doesn't
leave much room for diversifying among a basket of them.
And the bull pretty much rules out any great businesses
being among them.

2) Hence, those of us buying the JBM's and HYDEA's and
PSO's are not following Graham, but a separate unproven
theory that they will eventually reach net net value.
Why am I buying PSO? Because JBM and HYDEA both would
have worked out very well. To Graham's criteria, I add:
improving balance sheet, a trigger or other new developments,
and positive cash flow. This is empirical testing IMO.
So far it's working, but I wouldn't say I'd have Graham's
backing here.

3) Do we know that historical discounts for net nets
are predictive at all? Would it have predicted HYDEA's
or JBM's price movements? Not that I can see, but
I don't know and I doubt it's been studied.

4) That said, hey, we're all trying to find value in
this market, and sometimes its good to just follow
rules. Buy a couple profitable net nets at the
top of a bull and wait for a 50% gain
or 2 years, whichever comes first. This is a theory
in testing right now, and we'll never have the numbers
to generate generalizability or validity to any
conclusions we make.

But have you persuaded me that historical
discount to net net means anything? No.

On a practical level, should it mean anything?
We're talking about illiquid profitable
stocks that are net nets for lack of
publicity, high insider holdings/low float,
crappy industry, poor management rep, or just plain ignorance
on the Street. Obviously, Wall Street can
be pretty sudden about its decisions when
it does recognize one - both JBM and
Hyde have had 40% moves over a few days.
If ignorance is the issue, then why
should historical discount mean anything?

I think historical discount makes sense if
you feel the market is efficient in the
stock. I obviously don't feel that way
about any of the net nets I've proposed.

Hyde had a historical discount for just
about ever - Al Frank pointed this out
in 1987. My rule involves buying net nets
at a discount in this kind of market,
and waiting 2 years or for 50%, whichever
comes first. I added some other criteria,
and now I'll see how my particular version
of Graham's classic cheap stock screen does.
So far, it's working, but that's not to
say it will or won't continue.

With any net net, I expect poor earnings
comparisons. I expected them when I brought
up Hyde here, and I expected them when
I brought up JBM on MSN. Nothing in my
conversation with JBM's CFO indicated
earnings would improve, but that was
irrelevant to my focus - were the
assets good, and were the inventories
moveable. In this market,
as James says, if a net net doesn't

Jim and I regularly cruise for decent net net opportunities
and I was somewhat surprised to see such an extensive list
of not only net nets but profitable ones. Recognizing many
in the list immediately, I concluded that there are two
major problems here:

1) the data for the screen is faulty
2) the list confuses the difference between a net net and a net net
buy, i.e. there has to be a margin of safety in the discount to
net net value ( Graham wanted a 33% discount at least).

I went through the first bunch of companies you listed - by
going through the SEC filings- and came up with the following
ratios (market cap/net net).

ACMM 1.0
ASFN 0.97
VOX 0.90
CSTL 1.66
CHRB 1.70
CRAN 0.92
EDIN 0.94
ESP 1.10
HBW 0.95
IDG 2.07

I stopped at this point, though I may go through the rest
of the list when I have more time. It is obvious that these
are not at all "profitable net net buys" a la HYDEA, JBM,
or PSO. These three had ratios < 0.70 at the time they
were discussed, thereby providing a decent expected return
of near 50%. The best ratio in the bunch - 0.9 - only provides an
expected return of 11% - not a significant margin of safety IMO.

Moreover, VOX and ESP among several others seem to be
actively collapsing, with sales shortfalls greater than
30% and recent ventures into negative income.

I have commented in the past that I can take a list of
15 net nets down to 1 or none in about 30 minutes with
SEC Edgar. This is not because I am seeking the best ones,
but because I am simply seeking true net nets at 2/3 of
net net value, as Graham advocated. To do this, I don't
even look at the income statement or the business they
are in. If I find one, then I will look at the other aspects,
but I rarely take this next step because 2/3 net nets a la Graham
just are not out there in any great quantity.

Screens have inherent limitations - even the best ones.
Historical testing of the net net hypothesis should recognize
the problems in the data and the potential pitfalls in not
recognizing the 2/3 criteria for a buy.

It's the premium cigar market that is most cyclical
and on a downtrend - this has been the reason for
the fall in the premium cigar makers. Swisher to
me has been unfairly lumped in with the other
two. I wish I could cite some articles or something,
but I've gleaned this info from so many
sources over time that I've come to accept it
as de facto truth. If you have evidence the premium
cigar market is doing fine and that the supermarket

hear it because I haven't heard that at all.

Well, with the debate on the Senate floor today,
I went and bet on tobacco.

The bill looks fairly hideous for cigarette
makers, especially with the provision that
nicotine addiction sans disease can be a basis
for liability, so I steered away from MO.
I just don't know what the impact can be.

Instead, I bought UST. It has been absolutely
slammed, and after comparison with the
similarly slammed SWR, felt that UST
was the way to go.

UST now offers a 6.4% divided, trades
at a PE of 10 and a P/Cash Flow of 6,
with ten years of share repurchases and
dividend increases at its back. Growth
is hard to see, but I don't see where it
is necessary at current prices. In any
case, long-term growth in the 7%
range appears attainable and is its
history. Debt is the most manageable
of all the tobacco companies at just
1/4 of equity. This is a business I would
like to own, so now I do. It just
bleeds cash. The stock goes ex-dividend
June 1. Lousy management aside, I love
a business that can thrive with lousy
management, and it's hard to find
a better definition of value IMO.

Physiologically, I see a harder path
for lawmakers determined to make
Skoal and Copenhagen the sins of the day.

This was for my personal account.
I also went and bought Telebras at 110
this am. It remains the cheapest
and most value-laden tech stock in the world
at these prices, IMO. St. Joe and
Deswell also made it in to round out
my favorite trio.

My tobacco bill coverage is just Reuters and
cable news - no better than anyone else.

I guess we see the oversupply two different ways.
Swisher's mass market business hasn't hardly
missed a beat - its problems are its
overinvestment in premium production
facilities at the wrong time. But looking
at the numbers I must say that MPP looks
better to me now. I hadn't looked at it
in a while, and I had the numbers wrong
on Swisher when I originally compared
the two.

Re: UST dividend cut, the market
is acting as if it expects one. Financially
strong equities don't often offer 6.4%
in an era of the 6% 30 year T-bond
without some expectation of a breakdown
built into the price. Given the
cash flow, low debt, capital access,
and history of buybacks and dividend
increases, I'm betting they won't cut it.
Even if they do, I'd take this stock with
a 5% yield easy.

I notice from your posts that you were
pretty pro-Adaptec at one time. Are
you still in it? It's on my watch list,

Wow, I just spent some time over at the
General Cigar Yahoo message board. That
has to be the most bearish thread I've ever
seen.

Gabelli has been helping himself to this stock -
last bought 15,000 shares at 15 1/2. And it
has been absolutely savaged over the last
weeks, now just under 11. The least debt
among the big three cigars, all recently
acquired.

Evidently they own some land which has
a sizable contrbution to the book value
of the stock. If I could find out what
the current value of this is, this could really
become an interesting value stock.
I assume Gabelli already investigated,
but I'll take a looksee too.

Well, looks like MPP's land is only a couple bucks

After reading the Yahoo thread first, the 10-K looks
pristine. They're having problems, no doubt, but
things look on the up and up. Interesting to read
about their former drug smuggling employee suing
them for wrongful termination. Sheesh. But all in
all, not nearly the potential penny stock the burnt
investors over on Yahoo seem to believe. And with
Gabelli's purchase price some 45% north of here, that
makes me more comfortable. I think it would be
as ridiculously cheap as UST is now if/when it hits $9
based on a rough estimate of 10X minimum earnings.
This is a big capital expenditure year for them. Can
they settle into a lower-cost groove in the future?
At just about 1.5 times book, I hope even more disgusted

I guess the question with cigar companies is,
has cigar smoking moved up a notch in society
for good? Will it simply flatten out from here,
or will it fall off the cliff back to 93 levels.
And if not to 93 levels, to what level? If,
God forbid, there's any more growth in them

MPP does seem cheap. I suspect that the market

For long-term holders, it's been steady, and if you want

inventories and receivables down, sales up 45%. They've
been consistently doing well in a tough computer components

Estimates are falling because of "uncertain" guidance over

But what impresses is me is that despite
all you said, as of April 30th, there
was no inventory bloat (inventories
were down). There was no rapid increase
in accounts receivable, which were also
down. And sales zoomed ahead. With a PSR

Re: SJP

This is my notepad valuation that I did back
when I was making my decision. Then I got
a fax from Merrill Lynch that more or less
confirmed it, though it a few different
assumptions. I called the company and spoke
with the "assistant treasurer" who helped
me through some of the valuation of misc
like the sugar lands.

I spoke with people I know from and in
Florida as well, and am very confident in
my valuation - hence along with TBR and
Deswell it is in my "power trio" of long
term holds. I feel that you have a minimum
net asset value in the 33/share range.

Realize that James Clarke here is the
expert on St. Joe. He sold his position because
in his opinion the easy money has been made.
I agree, but I feel that the downside is limited,
and that right now at $30, the stock
is a solid core buy for me.

Anyone looking at SJP now should really look
at FEC. In the opinion of many, FEC is
more undervalued now. This may be the
case, but I am interested in owning the
majority holder. As FEC's stock increases,
so does SJP's net asset value. The company
told me it is "very happy" having control
of FEC, and is not inclined to make another
offer for FEC. SJP had offered just over
100/share, which to me would have been
to good to be true, and it was rejected.

Re: the India Fund

It has performed better on a NAV value basis than the IGF over the last few
years. Net asset value as of March 31 was 8.75. The stock's now around 8 1/8. I
was looking for diversification into countries with low correlations with the
US market. Thanks to the 15 year US bull, you end up in just a few crummy
places, India being one of them. It's a country with serious problems. I happen
to work with a lot of people from India, and I talked to them extensively.
Basically, the new government is bad news and the banking system stinks. But
they have excellent schools. development is at a breakneck pace. Many of my
friends feel that the "next Silicon Valley" will be in one of certain cities in
India due to the relatively cheap but highly educated tech workers
there and the schools. The India Institue of Technology is one of the world's
premier graduate-level technology schools. There is an exploding middle class
according to the people I know. The middle class IMO is what creates stability.

In sum, I looked at the India Fund, thought I was getting it at a discount, and
figured it would be a&#255;good long-term investment I first checked that I
wasn't liable for any taxable capital gains distributions, which is one of the
first things I look for in CEF's.

I made one major mistake. I relied on http://www.trustnet.co.uk/data/ind00.html
for my discount info, since I didn't have any way of getting current NAV info.
DON'T do this. A lot of their data is in error. So in the high 8's I ended up
paying NAV. A subscription at http:/www.icefi.com may be worth it if I'll be
investing in CEF's, but I don't think I will too much due to the reasons Paul
mentioned.

Other countries I want to invest in - South Korea via the Korean Fund (my wife
is Korean and I can get info through her family), and Japan. In Korea, people
kill themselves if they don't get into the best schools. Like Japan, it is an
incredibly proud country, but IMO even more so. That pride got them into this
mess, but I can't imagine that they won't right themselves and come out much
much stronger.

The big risk in Korea is North Korea. If South Korea ends up having to bail out
North Korea when North Korea falls, South Korea will hurt.

General Cigar today. It just seems so contrarian. I can
hardly find a good word about them, and this last swoon in
the price from the 13-14 seems to have just killed all
the courage in MPP holders, judging from the Yahoo thread.
Except Mario Gabelli, who keeps buying right down to 10 5/8.
He no doubt has talked extensively with management and
sent analysts off to report on their operations. I like to
have a veteran in the boat with me, and at a nearly 20%
stake, he owns a good chunk of the boat.

They have problems, no doubt, but I'm buying it at sales,
and the ROE on this business is inherently good. After sales
steady out, it may become another UST-like business. Without
growth to worry about, cash flows will end up going to buybacks
and dividends. They've already announced about 5% buyback.

Re: CDWC

I buy from CDW and Computability primarily. I am not sure that CDW
qualifies as a Buffett stock. The high ROE to me looks the result of
it being a new market with few competitors. The competition is heating
up. No doubt, CDW is one of the leaders, but I don't think the
business economics add up to any kind of guaranteed longevity and
sustainable high ROE.

So it's not a Buffett stock, IMO. Is it a value stock? Well, it's
still growing pretty significantly. Looks like a stock that has
been creamed, but both the industry and its leading position in that
industry will continue to increase sales. So the PSR's less than 0.7,
and sales are growing 30%. Turns its inventory 20 times/year. I
noticed that they are chronically out of stock of many products,
which limits next-day delivery, but allows easier inventory
management. As long as it doesn't turn the customer off - they lost
my Sony monitor buy because it wasn't in stock - and overall
it doesn't seem to.

Then again, Insight's PSR is 0.4 and it's also growing, even
faster than CDW. It too turns its inventories >20 times.

I would think that an investment in CDW is a bet that it will
keep growing its sales and that it will maintain its margins, or
at least stay profitable while the others sink.
Looks like Wall Street is betting that slow PC demand will
crimp those margins and the growth as well. Still CDW is the
leader. Of all of em, I'd buy CDW because it looks like management
has been doing a good job and as Dell proved management in these
kinds of businesses may be everything. CompUSA just seems to
have the wrong model. Thanks for bringing it up. Goes on my

When I read the redemption numbers for Latin America - listed
on the same page as the inflow numbers for the US - it was
pretty shocking. The traders in Latin America keep saying that
it seems like the stocks only react to bad news, and that
sometimes the falls make no fundamental sense. What that tells
me is that you are having irrational redemptions from people
back here and elsewhere yanking money out of emerging markets
regardless of the specifics of the various countries. Telebras,
as the most liquid ADR for Brazil and a benchmark in both
Brazil and Latin America, sees its liquidity and size drive its
amazing volatility because of this, which is of course the
opposite of what you see in a flight-to-quality country like the
US.

For value investors with a contrarian approach, a company that I recently
bought, Midway Games (MWY), at 12 3/8 just reported heavy insider buying (with
the CEO in for over $1M). The company has been
slammed since ~90% of it was spun off from WMS a few months back. The shares
have now rallied to around 14, but hopefully will fall back. Down 50% with
insider buying. What else? Well, IMO, it has great business economics - it is
the only producer of home video games (it made Mortal Kombat) that also is big
into arcades. So it has a bit of a ready-made testing area. I recently toured
the local Target - its games are selling very well. I myself play most of my
games on my Nintendo 64 rather than a PC, and I really don't feel the Nintendo
is going away (though Midway makes games for all formats, the highest margins
are in home video games) because to me at least there are native advantages
(including bigger screens and faster 3D play) to dedicated video game systems
over PC play. They recently reported they would be less profitable than
expected, and the shares tumbled. But there's no debt, a a chunk of cash, a
profitable business, solid economics, and large discount to its peers from a
valuation standpoint. I attribute much of the fall to weak shareholders.

In any case, the insider buying might qualify it for some of the readers here.
Another pick of mine, BMC, had huge insider buying at 17 and is now down to
13-14.

Re: BMC, with a balance sheet $100 million weaker and the income statement only
$35 million stronger (on the top, who knows on the on the bottom), to me the
market is reacting as if it thinks (1)BMC's management are con artists lying
about the company's transisition (2)Asia will last for at least 2-3 years (3)
the Orcolite acquisition was neutral at best and probably a negative. Given
management's historical record, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, but now
that the company is more leveraged, I think the margin of safety disappears.
Management was quick to jump in at 17, and it was quick to buy back stock, even
borrowing money to do so, in the 16's. Now at 13, it is a contrarian dream but
something of a valuation and safety question mark, with debt>equity.

Personally, I still buy managment's argument. Looking at the margins on the
various segments and management's capital reallocation, it seems to make sense.
I think it is falling because of inertia now. I got out when it broke to new
lows in the 15's and would love for it to just bottom out somewhere between
book and sales. It's high on my list, but I'm willing to wait for some price
stability, since I'm happy with my portfolios as they are now. I'm also waiting

I'm not saying that Whitman is an old blind fool. Geez, not even close. I'm

brings in a partner that introduces him to another area, then the mix changes.
And we don't know whether it's for the better yet. When Whitman says Tokio Fire
is a steal, I think, who would know better? When he says that Jensen has
convinced him of the value in certain semis even though he never considered
them before, then I think, does he (the proven genius of the two, but still
human) really know semis? And why is it he couldn't come up with this on his

Re: BMC, I'm learning a lesson. On this one, I got out when it broke to new

thought, even with big buybacks and significant insider buying backing it up.

I am not sure about BMC at this point. There are people who claim to be

On the subject of insider buying, I spent some time looking at this, and it
turns out it is not too hard to find stocks in which insiders made buys at
significantly higher prices than current ones. So either they misjudged the
market or their fundamentals. I will still look in this area. Yahoo may not be

Congrats Paul. There goes Methode, up significantly on already-triple volume on

observations, I couldn't find a reason to invest quickly enough. Meanwhile, the
stocks in my portfolio have taken turns hemorrhaging, and it's awfully hard to
figure which ones are at risk cuz they all seem so darn cheap already. With an
average PE of 9.6 and an avg yield of 2.3%, PSO is my high-PE play <g>. I still
like all the stocks in my sealpoint portfolio, which is up-to-date except for
BHP, which I sold (at its short-term bottom) to make room for PSO. They've all
been brought up here before, but especially New Holland and Deswell seem
inexplicably cheap. The Deswell thread here is the best source of info on the
company anywhere, and Ron's recent post about his talk with the CEO may shed
some light on the weakness, which is overdone IMO. As I've said before, I've
talked with the CEO as well, and he is very seriously and successfully running
the company. He seems to regard the stock market volatility as extraneous and
somewhat humorous. Yes, the stock's down over 30% in recent months, but last
time this happened, he told me "long-term investors should regard it as a
buying opportunity." The dividend isn't quarterly, but it has been generous.
New Holland stock is no doubt suffering due to the emerging market weakness and
the threat of a world recession, but and as with Deswell there's a decent
dividend while you wait. And that low PE is real - the company is flush with
true earnings and cash-generating ability, even now in the face of the last 9
months of emerging market turmoil. Jim Clarke knows the company better than me

Re: PSO I would view it more from an "event trading" perspective. When I traded
futures I learned that for all the second by second analysis and intense
trading, it still often took a few days for surprise news to really sink into
the price of the commodity. In stocks, I've noticed the same thing, except the
less liquid the longer it takes to move. When the awesome earnings came out, I
plunged back in for more shares at 6 3/4 even though it didn't jump because I
expected a near term response if not an immediate one. In stocks, I tend to
attribute it to the fact that the same few massive screening databases are
often updated weekly, and many individual investors (the only ones that invest
in true microcap values anymore -g-) don't even recheck their screens but every
few weeks to months for new ideas.

Re: manipulation, on a value thread that - out of necessity in this market -
"touts" many microcaps, it is a concern. But in reality I think all the
long-term participants here know that even what seems like the best idea in the
world to two or three of us is panned by another two or three of us. Check the
discussion surrounding his initial mention of PSO or TRC, or my mention of
HYDEA. Moreover, we know that this thread does not move mountains, even for an
8 million market cap. However knowledgeable some here are, it doesn't appear
that anyone piles into any of the ideas here in what the Street would consider
a big way. I think James has had about the best timing on the thread in terms
of the ideas he brings up, but I wouldn't attribute it to us mimicking him,
even for an ultramicrocap, or microcrap as the case may be. This reticence
benefits the thread IMO, as it gives many of us here a significant timeframe
for evaluationg new ideas.

Well, New Holland preannounced, which accounts for its fall
I presume. The charts told the story on this one. Crashing through
strong 23 support several weeks ago and then a 400% volume spike
the day before the preannouncement. On the NYSE no less.

This tells me that I am not in tune with the movers of the stock.
In the future, the same leakiness will guarantee that I and John Q
will be the last to hear bad news. Makes me wonder why I'm holding
it if I have now confirmed to myself that I can't properly analyze the
the stock because I have neither the same timely fundamental
information as others nor access to leaks.

But I'll hold it because I still see a strong balance sheet and cash
flows, very positive earnings, a decent dividend, and a play on any Asian
rebound. Quite a pyrrhic task this value investing has become.

News blurb yesterday says that the co-founders of Yahoo are both
officially billionaires now. Company started 4 years ago, and now

So USU is public, at around 14 1/4, near the low end of the range.
I read the prospectus and am less than impressed. At best I see
a company selling for a mild premium to book. The dividend is based
on a very high payout, and looks like it's around 7.7% at present.
They repeatedly state that pricing pressure is intense, and admit
that hey, it's a commodity with 4 major producers worldwide and
with government regulations and national loyalties complicating the
picture.

It transfers its depleted UF costs to the government today, but
it also pays off a huge chunk of its cash. I see basically stable to
very low growth over the next 10-15 years, and the prospectus
states that if anything the numbers are declining recently.

So it looks like an attractive utility-like company for a decent
dividend, but I don't see a dollar for 50 cents. Of course, maybe you know
something about the value of their inventories that I don't.
I didn't see it in the footnotes.

BTW, New Holland is just getting crushed. New lows are becoming
frequent and they're adding up, if slowly. I only have a $2200
position, so I'd buy more, but I'm concerned that I'm missing
something that the Street is getting. If you hear any scuttlebutt
I'd love to hear it.

I like a tech company, Asyst (ASYT). Why I like it is up on
my web site. Basically, as a contrarian, I can't resist the
semi equip sector now, even if it is tech. Given my recent history,
that means everyone reading this who likes the idea should wait
3 months and get it 30% cheaper ;)

Good Investing,
Mike

Re: ELY,ASYT, WWW

I take another look at ELY every so often. Those inventories and
AR numbers are just atrocious. The PE will expand as earnings
crumble, and, like Nike, is another case of 3-4 boom years
the may or may not be repeated. Too much risk for me, a la Nike.

I took a small position in ASYT today when it hit 13 again.
There's a DLJ reiteration of market perform with drastically
reduced estimates.

A shoe company that I would keep an eye on is Wolverine
World Wide (WWW). It's been in a freefall since announcing
earnings a few days ago. Wolverine is more of a "behind-the-scenes"
brand, and may have more reproducible success than some of its
shoe/apparel industry cohorts. I see great business economics
in its cobranding strategies.

Re: USU

Ok, here goes -

To be misunderstood, there must be hidden assets. Are there?
First let's value inventories correctly (I admit that valuing
much of it at DOE's cost is not an accurate reflection of the
value):

In stock on books at DOE cost:
7.944M SWU @$90/SWU --> $715M
12,145 Metric Tons Uranium @35/kg --> $425M

Just got from DOE for free, on books at DOE cost:
7000 metric tons uranium --> $245M
3800 metric tons uranium --> $133M

Just got from DOE for free, on books at estimated current value
given that this is raw material that must be broken down into
Uranium and SWU:
45 tons LEU --> $25.3M
0.8 tons HEU --> $22.4M
50 metric tons HEU --> $176.8M

Other assets include cash of $50M, AR of $222.5M, Russian product
paid for but not delivered $162M, property of $121.6M (I'll assume
that's true), and several other assets that add up to about $600M

There's also a big "other" at $574M which I'll throw in as true.

So that's $2920M in assets

Assuming liabilities are real, there's 980M in current accounts,
$150M long term, and 127 other for about $1.25B.

That gives me $1670M in adjusted book, which is at the high end of
the projected IPO price. No dollar for 50 cents as far as I can
tell, but yeah, it's a dollar of real book for about 85 cents,
assuming that the present value of future dispositions is a wash.

For 85 cents of book, I get a 7.7% dividend, first paid 12/31/98.
I also get about $200M in reproducible free cash flow. And I get
a product mix that is increasingly leaning on Russin HEU, which
as far I can tell there buying for about $85/SWU and selling
for about $90/SWU. I'm doing this as I'm late for dinner with the
inlaws, so that may require rechecking. That lower margin business
is now at 37%, up from 25% of business. And SWU prices have ranged
from $49 to $91 in the last ten years, making the increased reliance
on Russian HEU more risky, IMO.

It dominates the Asian market to the tune of 68%, which I see
as a great opportunity for the company, as more than anybody
Asia once it gets going again will need what the company sells.
And it's laser enrichment technology is exciting, but would
be more exciting if it was being deployed sooner than 2005. The
competitors already have cheaper processes, and one of them
will be getting an even cheaper process around 2001. The company
competes primarily on price.

I see a decent value play, but I think the government is getting
close to fair value, give or take a few hundred million ;)

Re: USU

Thanks James. Buffett once said he wanted such a margin of safety that he
doesn't have to carry it to the nth decimal point. So I was a little loose in
my valuation. It sold SWU for 115 last year, so I figured present value of 90
wasn't too bad for a discount.

You are correct though. Certain of its assets are separate from its business by
and large. As the prospectus states:

Substantially all of the Company's revenue is derived from the sale of uranium
enrichment services, denominated in SWU. Although customers may buy enriched
uranium product without having to supply uranium, virtually all of the
Company's contracts are for enriching uranium provided by customers.

So say, to be conservative, there's $17 in good net assets. Which are truly
separate from the business? Well, to start with, the $1742M in transfers and
current inventories incl. the uranium provided by customers. What liabilities
offset this? Certainly the "Uranium owed to customers" and I'd throw in the
long-term debt and "other liabilities" to be safe. So say $650 million against
the "hidden" assets. Maybe $11/share? Discounted a bit more to maybe $9/share?
Yes, your $7 is very conservative.

And its business is primarily a service business, requiring little asset base
depletion. So that business produces $2 in FCF and pays a $1.10 dividend. And
its current revenue level is fairly well locked-in via its long-term backlog. I
guess you were looking at it as a fair price of $18, or 9 times earnings/FCF
with a 5.x dividend for a now non-growing company. The market is probably
already valuing it off its dividend, thanks to confusion similar to my own. And
7X earnings doesn't seem to bother this market, for companies like this. So
I'll stick with $15.

Ok, so there's at least $24-25 in value. You win. I like it. I wish that I
analyzed all my stocks this close. Good luck with it. I'll try to make room
myself.

I must say that I also hated it because of the IPO, but an IPO on a day the DOW
is down 200? And with this confusing a prospectus? And with people suing to
block the transfer of uranium? Yeah, there's a margin of safety. Now the hope
is that it falls to 11-12 so I can get the business for free. Me buying it now
might help achieve that goal ;)

Tim,

Actually, I sold out of TBR a few days ago at 121. Several reasons:
1) I needed cash for home repairs
2) My small allotment of shares was way too small to be split
into twelve companies without commissions killing me on any
future exit. Not to mention stretching the limits of my mental
tracking mechanism.

My feeling is that the HOLDrs are temporary and therefore not a good vehicle.
Also, why pay the 1.50/share that my broker wanted. Twelve companies wouldn't
do with my small holdings. And there are a zillion analysts following this
thing. As we hit mid-July, it wasn't looking to zoom higher than 120ish
pre-split. I felt that despite all the indecision, the market was rendering a
verdict - and that verdict was factoring in an expected post-split fall in the
less liquid shares. So I sold - it was a relative decision. I needed to
liquidate about 25%, and I couldn't bear to sell much of anything else in the
portfolio. My plan is to purchase individual babybras as warranted on a value
basis post-split. I too expect there will be quite a spin-off downdraft effect
on the less liquid shares that may create significant opportunity a la MWY. If
we're lucky, even the big ones like telesp may fall with a world bear market.

Re: NH, value investing

I bought in a small position at 23 and change. There was relative and absolute
value there by every measure I could find, both within the industry and
compared to the whole stock market. It fell through 23 support on high volume,
and has kept falling, along with the rest of the industry. I committed to
double my position at 60% of my original position. So that's about 14. I have
no illusions it won't get there.
I believe that as bad as the relative disparity between value investors and

magnitude since late Spring. Certainly a gut check for value investors
everywhere.

Seems to me that a lot of the bad news was known when it fell to 23. The stock
got punished twice - once in anticipation, and then again after the decreased
estimates were announced. I posted on my web site "look for flat sales in 1998"
back in May. You'd think Wall Street could have figured this out if I could.
But then, this scenario is so common that one of my rules is "wait for the
downgrades," and I didn't do that here. I think another factor here is the
general dichotomy in the market getting worse. It's one thing to be a value
stock, which should be avoided at all costs. But the earnings announcement got
most of the holdouts (who must've been braindead not to know it was coming) to
abandon ship. I think that the 4 years of outperformance by go go stocks is
finally getting to the big value managers. They're dumping value left and
right. Sogen's head hints at this. Heaven forbid their clients see that they
didn't see the value in Amazon.

In any case, I've got a small position in NH and will add to it when it makes
sense to. I'm sure it will recover with the sector, no sooner and no later. And
I'll sell no sooner.

If I could invest anew, one of the first places I'd put it is
NH. Unfortunately, I'm fully invested in a lot of other stocks
that are also down 25% or so, so I can't. I envy you that you're discovering it
now. I must admit I am considering liquidating Timet to buy more NH and JOE.

Focus on the cash flows, and figure what those are worth to you
even with no growth. Discount them back to the present and you'll
see why it is a value. Don't forget to add in debt when comparing
the discounted value to the present value. The way it is now,
growth is gravy. I like Agco too, but NH is better for value investors due to
its more conservative balance sheet. There is a margin of safety. Also note
that these are cyclicals. But only
a Chinese devaluation could make Asia worse, and if NH is turning
in its current numbers during such a downturn, you gotta imagine
that when times are booming, NH will rock. Sweet gravy.

RE:NH

Times are
booming now, and have been for the last three or four years.

You know NH better than me. Heck, you've sat down with their executives, which
I can't do. And I admit I have been early and wrong on these cyclicals, and
maybe I just need to be around long enough to see them cycle. So forgive my
obstinance.

Looks like North America and Brazil are the only ones going really right for
them as of last quarter, accounting for a little less than half of revenues.
Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa all down. In fact, Asia down 40%. Maybe not
as low as they can go but still down. It's not as if they are hitting on all
cylinders now as far as I can tell. Seems if they were hitting on all
cylinders, earnings and earnings growth would be much higher than they are now,
so I don't see this as peak earnings. Then again, I'm not looking at next year
as much as I am over the next 3-5 years.

They are moving to diversify and take some of the cyclicality out, both
geographically and in product lines. Investments in Turkey, Pakistan, Asia
recently. Not bad value investing mentality by the managers. Agricultural
equipment is their heritage obviously, but now they are growing light
industrial equipment at 20+% clip and construction equipment at a 10% clip to
offset massive agriculture's negative growth. The industrial and construction
equipment would be growing much faster if the developing world would cooperate
and get out of their recessions. The growth of the financing arm will also help
smooth out the cycles. None of this will help the current downturn, but it will
help over the long run for stock valuation
purposes.

And then I see how it gets its tentacles in every market, with near
worldwide coverage, if token in some countries. With smart acquisitions and
good management, I don't see why NH couldn't smooth out some of the coming bad
troughs simply by expanding in virgin markets like Poland or Pakistan. Again,
long-term, and not necessarily for this cycle, but it raises that mid-cycle
number.

It has the cash flow and balance sheet to show that it will be around to see
its plans implemented. Moreover, I don't see the current/near term downturn as
typical of a cyclical in that it is simply following the tragic shock to the
long-term upward-trending business cycle of its targeted high-growth countries,
and is not the result of boom years flooding the market with nearly new
machines that need to get old before the next wave of new purchases occurs.
Seems that many developing countries including Asia have the need, but the
currency crisis has dampened their ability to satisfy that need with NH product
or any product for that matter. When many of these countries recover, NH should
be there, with an expanded presence thanks to its investments now.

I don't see the managers doing anything I don't like, and with some developing
market recovery I can see the stock doubling in 3 years,
and probably much more than that in 5 years. And if CAT or whoever sees their
cash flow, balance sheet, and growth prospects as attractive, and Fiat wants to
sell, then maybe there will be a lesser return but on a shorter time frame. So
I'm buying more.

Maybe this will be the one that teaches me what the word cyclical means and
I'll lose my shirt. Until I know bettter, I'll continue to find companies like
this at this price very attractive.

Re: JOE

I couldn't have been more wrong on this stock, or many of my others
for that matter. I thought that at $31 the market had recognized the management
changes and potential in St. Joe's land. I figured that with the land widely
recognized as worth at least $30/share, that Wall Street would not let St. Joe
get too much cheaper than that. I called it a margin of safety.

I did some pretty thorough valuation of its assets with conservative
numbers, and still came to at least $3B in assets. Yet here we are approaching
2/3 that. As a strict value player I should have waited for that 2/3 number.
James bought at 2/3 and sold at 4/3. He called
it right and made a lot of money. I called it wrong and have lost quite a lot
of money.

Today has been the worst day for my portfolio since at least 92. I'm down
nearly 4%, and this comes after a string of 1.x% daily losses.
In case anyone is noticing, USEC is down a point. Deswell is down to bid 12 7/8
- I'm rapidly approaching a 50% loss on a stock that was debt-free with a PE of
8.5 and a 4% dividend when I bought it. YPF, General Cigar, if I own it, it's
down.

Hard to figure, and hard to take. In fact, I feel not a little nausea
when I look at the dollar amount of my losses. Kudos to James and
Jeffrey for timing the market and coming out ahead.

What a support group! <g> My identifiable error in St. Joe was buying at 30 as
it received Wall Street's attention and possessed
a relative margin of safety, rather than identifying it and buying it when it
was in the teens and had an absolute margin of safety like James. In this
expensive market over the last year, buying value stocks close to intrinsic
value may have been my biggest mistake.

But no way can I sell now. Since I've got about 50% of the amount of my stock

People often ask me why I don't recommend or invest in medical companies. One
of the reasons is that I find the field on the whole very unpredictable. Few
people on this thread take any idea and buy without proper due diligence,
however. And so I am going to recommend that those with the inclination for
discovery take a look at Incyte. Incyte is a biotech company, and it is very
hard to find or define value for such companies, largely due to incredibly
negative cash flow and a reliance on a cheery future. However, Incyte is now
significantly profitable with decent cash flow and low liabilities. It is a
service company that sells info re: genes. IMO, this company can be to medical
research and future therapies what Microsoft is to software. In other words, it
has and will continue to have the info that other companies require to prosper.
There are high barriers to entry in terms of technology, time, and capital
requirement, and the field is narrowed down to really two significant
competitors, Perkin Elmer and Incyte. Incyte IMO has the edge for the long
haul. Recently, the share price has been tanking on the perception that it
overpaid for a recent acquisition. Overpaying for acquisitions is often a sign
of desperation, and Incyte is not desperate. I've been waiting patiently for
the low 20's, and lo and behold this market correction has taken Incyte to that
level. I have not bought yet, but am nearing a buy, and figured I'd throw the
idea out there.

I am aware that this is no single digit PE or asset play, but with
understanding of the business comes a margin of safety at the right price.

Wallace, I've been the YPF promoter on this board, now down over 10 points from

Telebras, Deswell, New Holland. It doesn't matter the country. If it's not the

After having a personal-worst 5% down day a few weeks ago, I'm down nearly 5%

check my portfolio to see if for once I am outperforming to the downside, and
so far this year I have yet to do so. Last year I did it only by being up to
50% cash. Today with the market down 3%, I thought, with how beaten down my
stocks are and with a moderately differentiated portfolio of value stocks with
fat yields, I have to be down less than that. Checked my portfolio and instead
I'm down 50% more than the market. Are any value investors having any luck out

My understanding is that the Venezuelan devaluation is a
rumor only. Although I wouldn't be surprised if it's true. That country
probably needs it. In any case, it shouldn't matter for Argentina, maybe a
little for Brazil.

This seems like a good opportunity to rotate for tax loss purposes.
YPF is moving with Latin America and oil. So now I can realize that loss and
move the money into Telebras or another stock that will move up with Latin
America and oil. Commission's cheap, and it repositions me from a tax
perspective without much risk. This can only come about due to the large amount
of parallel values worldwide out there right now, and seems a rare opportunity.
JOE and FLA might be a good example with a loss in JOE or vice versa. I'm
making preparations to wire a 50% cash injection into my account today. I see
an awful lot of opportunity, even though it pains me some to see my supposed
margin of safety fail me.

Good investing,

I knew what you meant. My comment was in jest. Just trying to
keep my sense of humor on a day when once again the markets dived
deep and rebounded, pounding my stocks down yet another grand or so.
This repetitive deep dipping and rebounding is killing the non-tech and
non-nifty 15, which collapse with the Dow down 250 but barely move back up when
it rallies to break even. This happens over and over and what do you get. The
Dow has hardly been representative of the broader market. Has there every been
a time when big stocks crashed and small, mid, and ADR's rallied? I don't know.
If not, then I should wait. Should my new criteria be 10% yields and P/FCF of
2-3?
Sounds crazy, but many stocks, especially ADR's, aren't much above that.

In any case, today INCY hit 20ish, but by the time my money was

Yeah, I should have said "except Jim." We knew you were largely cash, and only
owned a few high yielding or net net stocks. I assumed that you have been
beating the market on down days. I am largely invested in cyclicals that have
been beaten down, so I can guess what your study will show. If you count the
cash I took out of the market a few months ago, I guess I did ok (I could say I
was 33% cash and hence my percentage losses were only 2/3 of what I have
sustained). But I had intended to use that to potentially buy a car. Never got
up the guts to do it (couldn't get myself to pay that much for such a
depreciating asset), so now it goes back to the market (which may depreciate
even faster <g>). It means that my account now looks like it's doing a little
better, but it doesn't change the fact that my "fully invested" portfolio
crashed 20% in the last few months.

portfolio of value stocks? Please share your secret.

I'm finding that even solid value stocks, like Deswell, can find a way to go
down 50% if
sentiment is against them, so I'm becoming more willing to take a 50% hit in a
more
growth oriented companies with good prospects. 

Yes, I'm thinking that in the future I will be less afraid of growth stocks as
well. Ciena took a $25 hit, but still its losses don't approach the slow 50%
burn that Deswell or New Holland has put on some of us. And if I had bought
Ciena, then I probably owned MSFT, DELL, CSCO, AMZN, YHOO etc, which have beat
the pants off anything Graham followers have done. So the question is if value
doesn't keep up during the uptrend and gets killed during the downtrend, then
why do value? It's in my nature, so I have to, and I really do believe it is
still truly intelligent investing, but maybe at least in medical companies that
I know I'll start being more aggresive.

Axel, re: time frames, value investing is not synonymous with long term
investing, and it is not incompatible with tax-loss selling and other
maneuvers, IMO. Value in the Graham sense means buying undervalued and awaiting
fair value. If you get to fair value in a few months, then take it - holding on
longer only further enhances the return-depressing realization of value problem
that your other stocks will experience. So in fact long term holding is the
opposite of what we would like as buyers of undervalued shares. Value in the
Buffett sense - which is what it sounds like you have done - is buying and
holding, which depends on a particular art that he has perfected above everyone
else and involves growth investing. The Graham method is much more accessible
to most of us, and just by its nature, long holding periods for mediocre or
cyclical businesses - the only true Graham values available the last few years
- are counterproductive. So when the Graham type stocks fall 50% in a few
months it really is significant. It makes a long-term investment out of
something we would rather have been a short-term investment, and therefore
depresses overall returns for years into the future.

Beating the market, meaning the S&P, is the only goal, IMO. No matter what you
invest in you are wasting your time if you aren't beating something you can
easily track thoughtlessly with a mutual fund. You can argue risk-adjusted
returns all you want, but if over neither the long haul nor the short haul are
you beating the market, then there is no reason to invest in stocks
individually. This is not a hobby, and it is not a thrill. It is work in
exchange for superior returns. If one proves to oneself that one cannot get
that out of one's work, then one shouldn't be investing in individual stocks.
Value investing isn't a crusade. Just a means to an end. My hypothesis is it is
the best means, but still it's not for everyone (possibly not even me).

Ok, as long as we keep Graham and Buffett separate. If you are buying what you
think is a Buffett company on Graham's criteria, then you're probably in error
on one or both fronts. Mistaking a Graham value for a good company and holding
on too long is as grievous an error as selling just because a stock is down.
The former is apparently too often not recognized out of fear for executing the

Man, but if you fall for relative strength (past as predictor), then you've got
to give credence to many of the most elementary tools of technical analysis. No
problem for me, but as a strict value guy with interest in the Hyde's and Tejon
Ranches of the world, that's thin ice for you. So the relative strength is
good? Well there's that trend line that was violated so don't buy, and that
suppport you might as well wait for. And those moving averages and MACD. And
hey ADX/DMI is uncannily accurate...don't forget to wait for the breakout on
high volume but it's ok to sell into those 2 years of overhead
resistance.....and what do you know you bought Hyde at 7 and TRC at 35? Jeez,
can't figure out what happened...

The relative strength typically doesn't kick in until the stock has been on the
move for a bit, especially if it has been beaten down or hasn't done anything
for a long time. So it is a trend-following, late indicator. IMO not for deep
value investors, though superficial ones (gee the PSR is low) may want to give
it a try.

My point is that it takes a lot of work to read proxies and perform fundamental
analysis. If you can't beat the market, then an index fund is a much more
efficient use of time. What's the point of spending 300 hours a year to achieve
the returns that you could get with one hour (or less). If index funds didn't
exist, then your point is valid. But with the ease of investing in index funds,
I don't see your point. I believe Graham would have my view if index funds were

You don't understand? It seems so simple I thought there must be a disconnect

reach my goals."

If this is part of what makes one's day worthwhile, then picking stocks in the
face of underperforming the market may make sense - there are then nontangible
benefits to being an individual stock investor. I guess my personal choice
would be to do something else with my time and make at least market returns -
if I knew that all my individual stock picking would not beat the market.

So let me restate: Beating market is the only goal for individual stock pickers
. (this is what I meant in the first place)

Failing that, the goal is matching the market over the long term with next to
zero effort.

First let's pretend it's not mildly pathetic that on a Saturday night this
board gets so active <g>. This may explain some of the uncomfortableness with
passive index funds here<G>.

TimbaBear, I remember you from some thread somewhere a long time ago. This one?
Well, in any case, I disagree with the premise that a margin of safety comes
primarily from "if liquidation occured what would we have." Two reasons:

1) Even on value stocks, the liquidation value is often a fraction of the price
paid. In a liquidation, even value investors lose a large part of their
collective shirt. Net nets are one exception, and even most of them aren't
really an exception due to inventory bloat.

2) Value stocks are more likely to undergo liquidation as a group than the S&P
Index. Often these are poor businesses and there is a reason they are trading
just above or near liquidation value. This is my hypothesis, and I have no
proof for this.

That said, I think that the liquidation value is indeed one component of a
margin of safety (and it may even be the first thing to look at), but the rest
comes from time-consuming research that confirms liquidation won't occur and
that the business should be valued much higher for one reason or another, IMO.
This part is an awful lot of art and not much science IMO.

Nobody on this thread or the Buffett thread is claiming they are actually able
to beat the market. 
I'm new at this (5 1/2 years), and I started to have trouble really since late
96 (only coincidentally <g> just before I started this thread). Part of the
reason I migrated to value investing was that I started to fall behind - the
main reason being I was moving from technical analysis to incorporating
fundamental analysis because it seemed logical, and I was getting devastated
because I didn't know what value was. I also needed something that was less
time consuming for an upcoming busy several years for me. Last year I got lucky
for most of the year, avoided the worst of October, only to crash miserably in
the last two months. Then up 20% for the first Q of 98, now down over 20% since
then. I can't say that I have had enough time or experience to know first hand
that value investing is right for me and that I will or won't be able to beat
the market long-term. I do know that my research leads me to stocks that other
value investors have already found or are finding. So I figure I'm getting some
of the research part down. But rather than experience conquering hope over
time, I would say it is tomfoolery to know with the confidence of years of
experience that you can't beat the market and still not get an index fund -
unless you "enjoy the hunt."

Oh I know you are. I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying. I don't think I

a company that is undervalued for any number of reasons and when I buy it I'll
have a target. I want that target hit sooner rather than later. Part of a
margin of safety is knowing that the company will be there for a while, and
part of it is the potential to go up in a reasonable time frame.

Jim,

Re: reasoning. I own 4 stocks that have killed me this year: Deswell, New
Holland, YPF, and St. Joe. To me, NH and CSE are interchangeable at current
prices. St. Joe and FLA likewise. I switched solely to lock in some tax losses
with virtually no penalty to the upside.
Irony of ironies, I actually had some realized gains this year that I wished to
offset. I also have some untaxed income from Microsoft, so all in all
converting my "paper" losses to real losses doesn't hurt and probably helps.

The YPF/Telebras switch is not so simple, but basically includes the above
reasoning, and Deswell I just can't sell and will probably buy more. I'm still

I'll just take cheap whatever the business. I think that Buffett companies have
a long way to fall before they become attractive again as buys. They're just
exiting "sell" range and entering "hold" range. Coke will fall to 60 and people
will say cheap. Yeah, well, I thought it was overpriced at 50.

So for now I'm taking my own advice and looking within my own portfolio. I've
added to Deswell, Telebras, General Cigar and Midway. Deswell and Telebras are
completely falling apart. Barring an unlikely dividend cut thanks to Deswell's
cash hoard, it now yields over 10%.

I also took new positions in Agouron, Incyte, and Tidewater.
Agouron - a premier biotech - is getting killed with the rest of biotech and
now sells for less than 1.5X trailing sales as they explode upward. Incyte I've
already discussed. Tidewater is simply the most debt-free, free cash flow-rich
boat/oil services operator. In a downturn invest in the biggest, right? There's
insider buying and a stock buyback.

For what it's not worth, now I have people telling me that the world is
crashing and that people just don't understand. There were over 2 billion in
outflows last week from stock funds. The headline in the local paper screamed
"Meltdown!" and everyone is talking about the market crashing. I'm seeing
people fleeing, which may do more technical damage, but I don't see the
fundamentals in my stocks deteriorating as much as the change in market value
would seem to warrant. I'm happy to pick up Brazil's telecomm system for 6

Oh I think off-balance sheet liabilities are real, but then there's a

it a liability for me as an investor? There's also a quantification problem.
How big is the liability for a specific company? And how much will the stock
price be affected?

Saying emerging market stocks are way behind the curve and throwing the baby
out with the bathwater doesn't make sense to me. The way I see it Telebras just
got bought out by a bunch of entrepreneurial-minded businesses with foreign
capital and expertise. So they are ignoring Y2K? More than likely they and the
Street have already planned it into there capital budgets. If not, to what
degree are they ignoring it? And if so, why - stupidity or intelligence? To
what extent will this ignorance or knowledge affect the stock? Amazon has three
"be afraid" books on Y2K:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/generic-quicksearch-query/002-0330126-8761465
I flipped through one - awfully gloom-and-doomish - I don't buy the scenario.
It's the most popular "the world is coming to an end" factor discussed in the
media, and everyone is talking about it. In my book, if anything it's already
been discounted.

Even if Y2K has significance, one has to figure that emerging markets as a
whole are already discounted from the US for reasons such as Y2K. The market is
already telling me I can buy the future of Brazilian telecom for 6 x
earnings/2.5X cash flow or buy the future of American telecom for 20 x
earnings? So certain American advantages are already implied. But then there's
Americans in at Telebras too, and I don't find AT&T's earnings worth three

It is unlikely that a company would undertake to spend a billion

getting the shares at over a 40% discount to what the market paid

Within three weeks I was fully invested in "relative values," many of which
have fallen 40-60% in three months with no paper profits to cushion the blow.
So having participated fully in the bear so far, there's no way I'm taking mine

Even more ironical, looking through my broker statement, I was actually selling
partial positions of YPF at 31, Deswell at 16, Midway at 16 1/2, JOE at 29 1/2.
So I made some right moves in mid-June, but the money went right into other
stocks that have lost money. Yep, I'm staying on this train now no matter where

After making such critical wrong decisions in just the last three

Re: ag equips, USU

Barron's has a feature story on cyclicals, mentioning New Holland and Deere by

Honestly, if there's a big pop in the stocks Monday - especially NH, then I'd
consider selling, since the "Barron's effect" rarely holds up long (see TRC) in
the face of a continued lackadaisical story. This bear market ain't over yet,
and the ag equips companies are now saying that there will be a bigger falloff
in 1999 even than in 1998. So if there's a pop, chances are you'll be able to
buy them back cheaper at a later date. Not that I'm knocking the businsesses,
see http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/980930/z5.html . But yes I'm trying to time it a

Re: USU, this is oh so typical of Wall Street. Didn't it get down to 13 again?
I didn't see it. The dividend should be safe, and you're buying it because the
dividend is safe - cash flow is still tremendous, and the higher electricity
costs are transient. The AVLIS expense will be capitalized in a few years, and
in a few more years, electricity costs will be cut to a fraction of what they
are now. So you can buy it for the dividend, and sit on it, since once the
dividend is paid consistently, the stock will likely hit $18-20 or so simply on
that. The rest of the story may take longer to work out, but reported earnings
will jump once they capitalize AVLIS. No doubt AVLIS is a big deal, but as I
understand it now they're past the research stage (courtesy of $billions and
years of work from the gov't) and already for practical purposes entering the
commercialization stage.

That said, USU is not the world's greatest business, and truly last week there
were other stocks that you should have been buying, even if it meant selling
USU. If Deswell hits 6 again, or if New Holland hits 9 1/2 , or if Midway hits
9 1/4, well I won't be holding onto my USU at 16 or even 14 - it's not for
margined accounts, and if stocks get down that cheap again then I'll go on
margin to buy them up just like I did last week. I'm back off margin now, but
when you have companies trading at 1.5X earnings net of cash and debt with 15%
dividends, well I'm not gonna feel like I'm risking money by borrowing at 7-8%
to buy them. Heck, I'd LBO them if could.

The Deswell thread here has been accused of being a cheerleader squad, but it
really is the highest quality analysis on SI, IMO.
There is little not to like about Deswell at prices anywhere below $15, but the
thread tries hard to find them. I'd just refer you there. Paul and Ron and now
some other good contributors from here have found their ways to the Deswell
thread, and it makes it that
much better. I just talk about it a lot because to me it's the most incredulous
thing I've ever seen that Deswell hit the $6's. I went on temporary margin to
back up the truck to it, and now I've sold 4 stocks to stay off margin yet keep
the Deswell shares. But the story really should be over at the Deswell thread.
James, you'd be a valued asset there.

Well I hope all you value investors are enjoying this. On backs of today's
heroes Asyst and General Cigar (each of which I also bought more of when the
market was down a bit over a week ago), the market's given me a 25% gain in 8

cap value stocks are just exploding, which is nice because it may get the
tax-loss selling off our backs as the month comes to a close. The January
effect this year could be potentially huge, as all the institutions that
pressed our stocks down with tax-loss selling thus far get back in (at prices
50% greater than where they sold). This is the type of can-do-no-wrong phase
that most of us value investors missed out on while the market screamed higher

I agree, Jim. I've had an absolutely amazing run of luck in the last week and a

today, Asyst and Tidewater are boosting my portfolio,. I cut every decently
priced position out, and sold several overweighted positions down to more
normal levels - including Deswell.I've sold myself down to a 40% cash position
today. This rally has the look of a sucker punch in disguise. I'm very glad to

And in keeping with that spirit, Jeffrey, now I've sold off every stock except

guaranteed 5% nominal rates on my money (which approximates the real rate) is a
very attractive option relative to stocks. Even the small caps that look cheap
have had a recent double, and could easily get cut in half as the year ends
/1999 progresses and/or pessimism resurfaces. Recognizing my own emotions

my conclusion this rally won't last. Capital preservation seems indeed key

Actually, most of the stocks that I made such a good amount of money off of
recently are the ones in which I averaged down aggressively. Deswell I've held
since last fall at over 20, and came out well ahead thanks to confidence in my
fundamental value-oriented analysis. New Holland got a huge dollop of my
capital when it went to 9 1/2, after having first bought it at 23. Asyst got
double my original investment when it fell to 6 1/8. Tidewater got a doubling
of my money at 17 1/2. And I just doubled down into Midway at 9 1/4. What sort
of world indeed? I know fundamental analysis, and I know my version of value,
and I still make no excuses for moving in and out of positions with frequency -
Paul and I have had this argument before. To each his own, though it may offend

stocks that I follow, it's the only one I feel comfortable buying, since I know
exactly why it is down, and it hasn't participated at all in this greater
fool's run-up. Just about everything else even the Deswell's and NH's could

DJ,

I guess maybe if you were more familiar with the thread, you wouldn't
have been pointing out to Jim Clarke that book value can be inflated by
worthless inventories (and, of course, many other factors). There are many
people who would know something so obvious, and Jim is certainly one of them.

Re: finding no downside risk in stocks, you're missing the point when you
suggest buying a CD. My thinking, and I believe Jim's, is that with proper
analysis, time frame, and stock price, you can determine whether a stock has
downside risk, and without being quantitative (foo on beta), categorize that
risk as large, medium, or small, or virtually nil. The upside doesn't need to
be in the forefront, since typically in the case of the "virtually nil downside
risk" category, it is a given that the company would be decent value at 2-3X
the current stock price. You count on the market recognizing at least a part of
that within whatever time frame you set, and count on being right in your
analsis the majority of the time.

This extreme form of value investing, with "virtually nil" risk, is very
difficult to practice. It means swallowing the fact that the market thinks
there is no upside and every other analysis you've seen says that this sh**
really smells.

So it follows that the biggest problem I've had, and I've noticed others have,
is that we buy value stocks when they are still in the "small" or "medium"
downside risk category, i.e. the story still offers some hope, and see the
stock get halved. New Holland at 17 may have small downside risk, but at 9 1/2
it became virtually nil. Then it didn't matter how long the down cycle or how
long until good news, 9 1/2 was a buy. Waiting for these fat pitches is the
hard part, and most of us can't do it consistently. The few that I've seen do
it, and Jim seems to be one of them, have had good success in a tough market
for value investors.

Good investing,
Mike

Tweedy Browne comes to mind as closest to Graham currently among the
institutions. Since 1983, Graham's methods would seem to have failed us. No
doubt. It would be difficult to operate purely on Graham's relatively simple
methodology in this day and age, especially as an institutional player. All the
best-performing Graham values in the last few years tend to be illiquid with
either small floats or small market capitalization. >1 billion market cap
pretty much rules out the possibility of a Graham value of late. So it may be
hard to find big-name players doing well with Graham, and it is indeed hard to
find it even among individuals. As a result of my journalism, and contributions
to internet discussion groups, I've developed e-mail contact with hundreds of
investors, and I count just three successful Graham investors among them, just
one of whom uses it exclusively. And if I count myself among those three, then
maybe I shouldn't since I do tend to look for Tweedy's variation of Graham,
which includes insider buying after a significant fall in price usually greater
than 50%.

When I started this thread, I took "in the Graham tradition" to mean "let's
stay away from PEG's." So we end up with our variations on the theme of value
investing. Great discussion of late. With financial analysis-challenged people
I know still buying houses and sports cars with their stock market winnings in
Microsoft, Cisco, and now some of the internet stocks, it's hard to argue or
even defend value investing at the neighborhood barbeques. Good to see it still
generates interest out here in cyberspace.

I talked to Rich Dalman portfolio manager and US equity chief at

to be undervalued. James is absolutely correct - USEC would love to
get rid of the whole Russian deal IF it weren't for the potential
instability that would be either the cause or the result of dissolution
of the agreement. As my USEC contact put it, "We don't like it, but
it is in our interests not to introduce wild cards into the world uranium

Well, looking at two sectors highlighted as being in the dumps recently, health
care and REITs, with insider buying.

I've taken an interest in Vencor (VC), an acute and long-term care operator,
and am digging deeper. I dealt with them as a physician in Memphis, and really
appreciated what they have to offer - getting the patient out of the hospital
despite having significant medical needs, even a ventilator. A fraction of book
and a fraction of sales, they're 2 billion+ company trading at less than 300
million, with negative earnings currently. They are moving to a prospective
payment system which can be good, I'm digging into it. Signs of a management
turnaround, with one old geazer supposedly leaving. Just seems extremely cheap
with longstanding insider buying at this level, but I'm looking into the
payment system right now.

Interesting aspect of Vencor is it's real estate assets, and there's a big
proxy for distribution from March which I haven't gotten through yet. Jim, do
you know this one?

when it jumped from 8. Jim, any updates on this one at less than 11 now?

worked by the Justice Department (yes, it would work over any long-term care
facility it investigated, because medicare abuses are pretty much there
everywhere if you look for them). So it's excrement. Is the price right? Can I
categorize the risk? Holding my nose and digging deeper...

FWIW, I bought into Timberland today. I'm wearing Timberland on my feet and on
my back, and thought I'd look at the stock, and it was kind of a no-brainer.
Low multiple of earnings, a strong consumer franchise, still improving margins
and growing profits despite the slump. High ROE, 1.5x book, 1/2 of sales. Only
30% of revenues from abroad, and abroad is higher margin; room to grow I think,
and that doesn't seem figured into the price.

Small caps are underpriced vs large caps with a larger disparity than I've ever
known. The relative PE ratio of small caps to large caps is historically low
when it gets around 1, since small caps typically grow faster. And it hit a low
of 1.04 or thereabouts in the early 90's. Now it's like 0.7 or something like
that. The market is putting a huge premium on the biggest names in these times
of global uncertainty. Small caps have underperformed since 1994, and the

My reasons for FINL over Z was mainly the lack of any LT debt, the substantial
cash position (which they've largely spent down by retiring at least 4% of
their shares the last two months), and the, IMO, greater growth potential (in
terms of they have a lot of stores to open before they hit FL's level, and I
don't see any reason why they couldn't do that). I understand management at
FINL is supposed to be good (or at least for some reason the Fool thinks so)
and I think they've been doing a good job of expanding the concept with the
bigger superstores, while still controlling inventory. How they open stores
with over 120 pairs on display and shrink inventory per square foot by over
20%, I don't know, but it sounds good, and any good news with a 2/3 book value
and no debt is almost reason enough for me. My position is small and hopefully

Jim, glad to see we're of the same opinion. I've actually spent some time
looking at Amazon.com, and thinking about its model, and I'm pretty confident
in what we've done. Re: it being the contrarian thing to do, I don't know many
doing it. I expect that a lot of people are holding off to the new year to bail
(and hence avoid the immediate tax hit on their gains); these are not long-term
holders, but people who bought at 150 and saw their stock more than double in a
short time. I can't imagine but that they'd be wanting to head for the doors
once 1998's books are closed. The business economics stink, and once the
trading momentum swings, I don't see any fundamental floor at all until we hit
about 50. How many funds will keep it on the books for windowdressing but head
for the doors in January? I'm thinking quite a few.

Timberland didn't give you much of a chance to get in (where my front-running
actually got me the better price :)). I bought that one on less than 30 minutes
of analysis because I thought the margin of safety was gargantuan. Like Deswell
at 6. Now it's like Deswell at 8. There's still a MOS there, but you gotta be
ready to take an immediate 25% hit and hold longer-term. FINL, well, glad it
reacted like it did to a crummy report.

BTW, I did add ELAMF and UBB to my positions today on the long side.
They are Graham-like in their margin of safety as well. UBB could conceivably
go to 7 again, but I'd just buy more.

(If fundamentals are deteriorating, that would be a different story.)

That's my understanding of Amazon.com. Debt, losing more money the
more it sells. A cutthroat industry being made more cutthroat, with
no barriers to entry.

Hey, I buy all my books from Amazon.com - I just link to it from my web site,
buy it, and as an associate I get an extra 15% off in addition to the 30% or so
below retail, and no taxes. My mom also buys her books there. I questioned her
about it - only reason for her actions: it's cheaper. Is there anything special
about the site? The layout? No, in fact it's kind of confusing. Why couldn't
Yahoo just start selling books, CD's, etc directly? Wouldn't that cut into
Amazon's business? Of course. Would Yahoo do this? Well, Yahoo's not
necessarily a bad business, just an overpriced stock, and I think Yahoo's more
sensible than to enter such a competitive industry. I see obviously horrible
dynamics like Iomega's. IOM had explosive sales in a horrible industry - data
storage. So people priced it ridiculously, thinking one day everyone will have
a zip. Well, ok, that happened, but is IOM a good business? Is it's stock a

it on price. Amazon.com's sole benefit is is its low prices, and hey, an
industry that competes on price only...

I don't believe for a second Amazon.com will become THE place to shop on the
internet, yet this is already priced into the stock, as people continue to
ignore the horrible business economics, so I feel I am indeed shorting an
overpriced stock of a bad business.

BTW, I've put up a new web site - ValueStocks.net - at you guessed

I covered yesterday. So today it hit 600 pre-split. The buyers
of the stock are dealing in dollars/share, not billions/market cap.
That Amazon.com is adding several billion in market cap a day despite no
assurances from either management or analysts that it will ever make money is
not the point. The point is that people got used to seeing it at 300, and
they'll put it back there no matter how many times it splits. Complete idiots.
A year or so ago I saw a survey of random investors and some 60% said that a
2:1 stock split meant that you got double your money. I thought, geez, this is
who's in the market. Well, yes, they are, and that percentage has apparently

Well, tracking that Jan effect. My portfolio as posted on
my website was more or less my second experiment with playing
the Jan effect - just about every stock had the potential to
bounce. And it is happening. I'm up 9.50% so far this month.
Yeah, I know, Amazon.com has already nearly doubled again, and
anyone in internet stocks would be doing better than me. But
the Nasdaq is only up a little over 6%, and it's had a heck of
a run since the year started. So with my diversified portfolio
of relatively unknown, unheralded, huh-at-the-cocktail-party stocks,
I feel that my gain so far is real, and that the Jan effect is
in fact still working - so far. Just saying that yes the individual
investor can still benefit from this oft-heralded, oft-disparaged

Shorting an immensely overvalued stock is not simply speculation,
IMO. Amazon.com in no way deserves its current valuation, and not
just by 30%, but on the order of 1000-10000% overvaluation. The
business model is horrible, and the industry is commodity at best.
Recognizing this and committing to a short position until the
fundamentals play out is not speculation. Of course, that is not
what I did when I tried to cover last week. But now that I have
my short position, I'm sticking with it until the fundamentals play

So this is worth $220 million in cash to Compaq:

For the nine months ended 10/31/98, net sales totalled $4 million, up from $377
thousand. Net loss totalled $18.9 million, up from $2.4 million. 

That's shopping.com. One would presume that Compaq sees something we all don't
see. Makes me wonder if Compaq wasn't just paying that much for the web
address. If altavista.com is worth $3 million to Compaq, well then one has to
wonder how much of the valuation of the internet companies is simply web
address.

This becomes even more absurd the more I think about it. Compaq values
shopping.com at $220 million, but the fact Compaq is buying shopping.com makes
Compaq worth $5.1 billion more in the stock market. Absurdity. But Compaq can't
be that bright. By simply announcing this, Compaq becomes an internet stock.
And internet stocks are worth at least $400/share no matter the shares
outstanding. In Compaq's case, that makes it an additional $550 billion or so.
Compaq should've bought with stock.

Meanwhile, I'm clinging to that Amazon.com short. I will be right someday
(FLW). And I'm buying Callaway Golf and Brazil (UBB, TCP). Callaway Golf may be
having a rough time, but it's a premier name in a growing industry, with no
debt, low ratios (P/B 1.4, P/S 1.0), and tons of insider buying at prices
higher than this. It's not going bankrupt, and at this price even its dividend
becomes competitive. And there's tremendous support in the 9-10 area. TCP - the
cellular co for Brazil's most populated area - was highlighted in Barron's this
week as being 4X cash flow for a 35% grower. Well, ok, but I know the private
market paid a price about 50% higher than the current price back during the
privatization, so I figure on that simple measure it is at least 33%
undervalued. And then you have the fact that the Brazilian market is undergoing
such a crisis that liquidity has dried up completely on the local exchanges.
People are sick of Brazilian stocks to the point of avoiding the exchanges
altogether. And TCP has repeated bounced off a low just below the current
price. Hard to see how this can go wrong if one holds for a few years, though I
suspect it will jump on any hint of recovery. I started a small position hoping
to see it get cheaper.

Irony of ironies, Amazon.com just sent me a high-quality T-shirt with
Amazon.com and a neat logo for being such a good Associate.

I2,

It only takes 6 years for a $300 dollar stock earning $1/share and
owning a 300% growth rate to surpass $700/share/yr in earnings. So there is
power in the PEG. I think we all realize that. Lynch first proposed the idea I
think, and the Gardners took it as their own and popularized it.

My problem with the PEG is that a lot of people use it, and when it really
looks good, then usually something is happening behind the scenes that is bad,
and I don't know about it.

In any case, PEG is entirely theoretical for most internet companies, since
most, including Amazon.com, are only posting wider losses despite their sales
gains. This is because a commodity is being sold and competition is occurring
on price. If a steel maker came out and sold steel at 30% below the market, it
would grab market share like crazy. And people would dump the stock into the
toilet. But add .com and make it books and look what happens.

This is not true of Yahoo or AOL. I would never short an internet company that
has shown it can profit at all. Even Ebay. But many,
to me, don't have a model for profit, or for sustainable ultra-high
profit growth once profitability occurs.

The ever present risk is that the company will use cheap stock to buy real
companies. 

I've thought of that. Amazon.com, for being such a crummy business,
has an amazing amount of spending power in its immensely inflated
shares. It could do 10 $1 billion dollar stock acquisitions of real
companies that needed to earn their way to $1 billion market cap,
and AMZN stock would hardly suffer. It's added $10 billion in
market cap in just the last few weeks. No sweat. If Amazon started
to do that, or did a second offering at these prices, I'd have
to cover. But as I understand it Bezos is trying to stay close
to home and be a retailer, keep doing what he's doing. So be it,
and I'll short it.

Re: TBH, I sold out oh around 120, thankfully. My intent was to await a retreat
and buy the individual spin-offs as they hit value levels. Wow, have they - but
not for the reasons I thought. You can use http://www.adr.com for more
information. I started buying TCP when it hit 18 1/2 this Monday, then bought
more at 15 3/4 the next day, then more at 13 5/8 the next day. So as usual, I'm
pretty good at catching falling knives - with my feet.

TCP is the cellular spin off for the most populous, wealthiest state in Brazil,
and includes its financial center. Now at less than 7 times earnings and about
three times cash flow. The kicker is it will grow. On CNBC today a
communications fund PM was pointing out how telcomm was an integral part of
Brazil's growth plans, and devaluation or no, he didn't see the Telebras
spin-offs' plans being inhibited or cut back in anyway. The guy didn't have a
position in it because of the devaluation uncertainty, so I doubt he was
hyping. Plus I can see the same thing, since foreign investment is already
committed into these things. For TCP, that means targeted growth in the 20%
range/year. And there's a nice dividend. So that's my favorite now, and the
only one I'm buying, but a lot of them look good, just not with as much growth
potential, and TCP's only a tiny bit more xpensive, if you can call 7 X
earnings expensive. I figure you only need one of the spin-offs, since they'll
all participate in any rebound. IMO TCP will lead the way when it happens. If
capital outflows this week come in less than expected (we're off to a good
start - Wednesday's outflows slowed to about 33% less than expected), Brazil
will rebound quickly. Don't underestimate the risk in Brazil though- the strong
currency was very very important to its economic health, and it really is
between a rock and a hard place. My bet is that is what Cardoso wanted - to
force Congress into his reforms, pension being the most critical. He knew a
limited devaluation would put a big scare into the politicians - I can't see
any other reason for a limited devaluation.

I also bought UBB at 14 9/16 back when Armin brought it up. As the guy in
Barron's pointed out this weekend, UBB has not been a risk- taker, and a large
portion of its assets are govt paper. But I didn't see the devaluation. The
bank is much riskier than the telcos but still I bought more UBB in the 10's,
and I'll buy more at 7 when it gets there. UBB was already less than 90% of
tangible book at 14 and, so I figured a devaluation has already been in the
stock price. Wrongo. As with everything, though, I root my holdings lower so I
can get them even cheaper.

Re: options
I gave up on all types of options a while ago. At first I just sold calls. Then
I took an options course, examined every possible strategy (they hand out a
nice cheat sheet), and chose synthetic longs and call-ratio backspreads as my
tools, using real time data with OptionStation. The level of sophistication in
pricing these things is much higher than most casual options players suspect,
and IMO the market is much, much, much more efficient than stocks. After trying
futures, options, tech analysis, and feeling that I was running in circles
(thankfully I never lost my shirt - especially in the commodities) I've
determined that plain stocks are the most rational area to find discrepancies
in value large enough and analyzable enough, given the facilities available to
me in terms of time and technology, to give outsized returns. I agree with Bob
that the best books are by McMillan (ignore the stuff from Angell).

But everyone should also know exactly what they're getting into, and that means
seeing the real-time options pricing and search software in action prior to
doing it. IMO, options are absolutely nothing about the price of the underlying
security (they are everything about correctly interpreting the security's
volatility differently than the market), and hence poor substitutes to simple
shorts, which for now I'm continuing to use.

I've bought into Callaway recently at 10 5/8 - it's in the VSN Fund at my web
site. To me, this is a 10 minute analysis, a la Timberland or Midway. Massive
insider buying, premier name. Decent technical support. No debt. And with
spring coming, well, why not buy it at such a low market cap? Every golfer I
know (remember, I'm a doctor, so there's a few) seems apoplectic when I tell
them what's happened to Callaway stock. The faith in the brand has already been
established among golfers, even though Wall Street has lost all faith.
Sometimes value investing is as easy as being contrarian, which comes naturally
to some of us ;-) There's just something to a story that makes sense in 10
minutes.

Timberland as a company is changing. Over a year ago people were talking the
brown shoe trend down. But Timberland IMO has hit upon some brand equity. It is
not just a brown shoe, but a very premier brown shoe. I see people wearing them
to work all the time. If/when the "fad" switches back to tennis shoes, will
these people stop wearing Timberlands? I wore one pair nearly every day for 5
years, and I'm working in two more pairs now. And now I've added two Timberland
shirts for work. The quality and comfort is high, and it's more than a fad,
IMO.

I thought it was an obvious, 10 minute analysis type of stock in
the mid 30's. This earnings report is sterling, making me think it still is
undervalued in the mid 50's for a ompany that is really a growth cyclical
starting to hit its stride.

The stock price shows really two price peaks, but the company itself has been a
steady grower over the 30 years of its existence.

All my opinion - this isn't one that is so obviously a value if you just look
at the balance sheet. To me, there's obvious value in the brand that gives it
high ROE, and makes it worth 11 times current earnings.

Re: Oilpatch

Among the small caps, hard to see one. But among the mid caps I see quite a
few. "Small cap sector leader" to me is an oxymoron. Among the mid-caps I see
Tidewater (TDW) as a leader of its sector, with the only strong, debt-free
balance sheet among its competitors.

Among the drillers, Diamond Offshore (DO) and Noble Drilling (NE) have strong
balance sheets and are sure to survive until the next cycle. Transocean
Offshore has a weaker balance sheet relative to these two but which is still
nevertheless strong enough to survive a lengthy downturn, IMO.

These are all $1 to 4 billion companies. And the market, IMO, despite
overselling them, is still placing relative odds on their ability to survive.
You can see this by simple PE on average earnings. TDW seems the most expensive
of its competitors, but it's the only one that definitely will survive a
lengthy downturn. Even among DO, NE, and RIG I see the market valuing them
correctly in the relative sense if not the absolute. NE is more "expensive"
than DO which is more "expensive" than RIG, which is how I see them as far as
safety.

Disclaimer: I own all of the above, having recently bought them at prices a
little below the current levels. DO I own via Loews (LTR), which owns a 50%
stake.

In the portfolio at ValueStocks.net, I own LTR, NE, and TDW.

Re:

Yes. But I don't take the following reasons as valid reasons not to buy the
stock (in fact I find them good reasons to do the opposite):
a)the cycle is down so sell the cyclicals to absurd levels
b)the nifty 50 and internets are in, so sell your small caps
c)you've lost big in a stock so sell to pay less taxes
d) your stock didn't perform well this quarter, so join the institutions in
selling to window-dress
e) the outlook is poor the next two quarters so sell as a proxy for pre-emptive
window-dressing
f)a beaten-down stock gets more beaten down out of frustration (e.g. Midway)

Oil, commodities and farming are no doubt facing horrible outlooks. No doubt
these industries are prone to devastatingly long and deep recessions. However,
given your stated style -

"Short to mid term in companies I think will pop. -

I find it hard to take you taking us to task seriously. Playing the sentiment
surrounding 1 or 2 quarter earnings fluctuations may be your game, but to me
does not constitute a sound, safe investment strategy.

Some of the posts on this thread from seemingly sound individuals have struck
as something I might read in Barrons, that noted barometer of popular
sentiment. Mattel should be avoided because Barbie is out. Oil should be
avoided because there is no near-term good news expected. These statements
strike me as asinine, and reflect the growing frustration among value
investors, who, like Jeffrey, are doubting their strategy.

This only leads to less support for the most undervalued situations. I'll
continue to scoop them up as long as I can.

The fundamental flaw with your advice IMO seems to be that you believe we can
accurately predict the timing of both the fall and the redemption. Moreover,
you would like to do it on terms lasting less than 6 mos or so.

The flaw in me, which I recognize, is that I can't do that reliably. So I'll

How about Jones Pharma (JMED)? It's my pick of the month over
on my website. The company is an emerging pharma that has 18 straight
years of record profits and has been growing its equity at a 36%
compound annual rate for the last 10 years at least. Now at a PE of
22 on continuing operations' EPS. An asset sale and cash flow have swelled
their cash hoard to about 15% of the market cap (and there is no such thing as
a burn-rate with this co). They acquire underpromoted, approved drugs from big
pharma and market the heck out of them - no big, ongoing R&D expense.
Management has been showing it still has the touch with Levoxyl, and IMO this
one fits the profile of a Buffett company. Long-term holders have been
rewarded, but given the nature of the industry, the company IMO attracts a lot

I sense we've got an accounting issue here 
Yes, in 1996, tangible book exploded upward, as did earnings and ROE, skewing
the averages. I got 38 % by finding compound annual growth from 1990 at 19.9M
equity, to a recent $230 M equity. That is skewed, so I used the lower EPS
growth, 28%, using 1990's 0.16 and the recent 1.16. I could go farther back to
1987, when tangible book was .32/share, and earnings were 0.06/share.

If you look at the annual ROE on an S&P sheet, it sits around 20% and has
fluctuated about that since 1987, which is the earliest data I have. What
happened in 95/96 is that JMED acquired what are two of its biggest sellers,
Levoxyl and Tapazole. Both treat thyroid disorders. This is a growing market.
In April 1998, the company sold its nutritional supplements business to TwinLab
for $55M, which in addition to strong cash flow has built its cash kitty.

The way I look at it, over the long term, this management can perform. They
have produced growth in sales and earnings ever since they founded the company
in 1981. Now, with a renewed focus on the high-margin pharmaceutical business
and a significant amount of cash, the company is like a coiled snake. Its last
16 acquisitions have been accretive to earnings, and in this case I am trusting
that management can continue. The last "blockbuster" acquisitions were in 1996,
and the stock price jumped quite a bit. I also have the feeling that the
divestment of the contract manufacturing and nutritional supplements business
is a prelude to another significant move on management's part. The balance
sheet is way underleveraged.

I think it is very hard to find an overlooked Buffett stock, but if I read in
the paper that BRK had just made a buyout offer for this company at $27/share,
I wouldn't be surprised. 10 years from now if the stock is at 200 I wouldn't be
surprised. Like all Buffett companies, there has to be some consistency, some
market power, and some great management. As far as I can tell, JMED meets
those.

The catch - this company gets its market power on a temporary basis across many
products. There has to be faith management can continue. And it isn't as
certain here as it is with Nebraska Furniture Mart. But then the management is
as old either.

they appear to be an out-sourced marketing and distribution channel for the
large pharmaceutical companies 

No. They are expert marketers and evaluators who identify then
acquire underpromoted (because of the small market) but FDA-approved
drugs from big pharma. JMED is its own company, and they do
very well because they increase the market share of the drugs
they acquire.

how long can Big Pharma ignore this slice of the pie?
Forever. Big pharma, by definition, gets bigger bang for its
buck promoting drugs for the several-hundred-million dollar
markets. JMED's total revenues now are just over $120 million.
Big Pharma will never want to sell drugs to tiny markets.

Its niche is in its expertise in marketing drugs, and in
penetrating certain small markets, such as endocrine. That
niche can be exploited much much more before big pharma
even starts to care.

I like that JMED picks markets where there is no reason
for dominance. Levoxyl should not be second banana to Synthroid.
No reason. Yet Synthroid wins 70+% to 24%. So Jones gets
Levoxyl and can continue expanding its market, eating into synthroid.
Jones has grown Levoxyl's share from 15 to 24% since acquisition,
at Synthroid's expense, giving Jones strong cash flows.

Called Midway. Here's my understanding:

As part of its spin-off, Midway had an agreement with the IRS to offer 1
million shares. The spin-off
was last April. They have already offered 750,000 to employees. They waited but
the stock price never recovered and now they have to offer these 250,000 shares
at current low prices. I get the impression they'd rather not. BUT the IRS
required them to offer these shares prior to any acquisitions. Acquisitions are
not necessarily in the works (although one has to wonder), but MWY wanted to
get this out of the way.

I clarified that this does not affect or reflect on their current
buyback, and MWY agreed with that statement.

Overall, this puts me at ease, but represents a terrible blunder
by the company's PR by not putting out a more informative press
release. That is, unless an acquisition is being sought and they
want everything under wraps.

My premise for further research into CPU: Leverage (operating, not financial).
CompUSA has the right name, and in many places the right location. The stores
are fun to shop (I rarely leave without buying something), and many regular
people think CompUSA when they need a part tonight, tomorrow, or early this
week. From a customer's perspective, I find the prices comparable and in some
cases better than the first placesI look on the internet. There's a lot of
sales there. There's also an internet presence which is not insignificant. For
smaller-ticket items, CompUSA is a first or second thought for a lot of people.

From a contrarian investor's perspective, I like that everyone hates the stock,
and that there is a specific event (the computer city acquisition) that
everyone points to as the reason to hate the stock. It is not hard to imagine,
5 years from now, people looking back at this price shakeout and saying, "how
could people have thought that COMPUSA would disappear? And why did they let
the Computer City acquisition scare them off? Didn't they see that balance
sheet?"

From a business perspective, I see an inventory nightmare. Economies of scale
would seem to be very important in this business, and hence the Computer City
acquisition doesn't bother me too much. The right manager, the right concept,
and I can see CompUSA earning just a few percentage points higher margin on all
that revenue.

I'm waiting for a steal on this one - <$4.80. I want it at less than book and
6-7% of sales. But further due diligence is ongoing, and my target may change.
This may be a case of buying crap at half the going rate for crap, but I like
the wildcard of potential margin expansion at these levels and am balancing
that against the competition factor.

IGT popped up on my screen just a few days ago as hitting
possible value territory. My concern, since we're supposed
to be discounting cash flows and such back to the present (
with one methodology or another), is even if this legislation
doesn't pass, there's the risk it might in the future. That
risk should materially diminish the current intrinsic
value of the firm. Since I don't recall anyone ever bringing
up the possibility of this law during IGT's hayday, I'd say
that the framework for valuing IGT is markedly changed even if
the law doesn't pass very soon.

That said, should the law matter? IGT and Anchor discount
their machines in return for a cut of the revenues. Those machines,
if priced entirely in the present value, would be worth much, much
more, and IGT's average selling price per machine would go through the roof.

BUT that makes IGT more cyclical IMO, with less reliable earnings.
The market, again, will make the stock more volatile, and discount
the stock for not having as consistent earnings.

I think the market may be overdoing it here, but I'm interested
to see how low an otherwise company like IGT can go. It and CPU
go on my acute watch list.

Shane, Re: ERP crash and PSFT, SAP, ORCL

Warning: long post

The fact that ERP is down to the point that I get asked all the time
about PSFT and SAP by people who know me to be a value, non-tech guy made PSFT
interesting for me. I started out with a bullish bias thanks to my contrarian
nature, but the more I explored the MMTM shell via the proxy and talking with
analysts, the more I saw problems. Incyte, a biotech company I like, made a
similar spin-off maneuver, but I don't think it had as desperate implications
as the MMTM trick. I get this mainly from weighing the proxies, ERP consultant
and analyst comments. PeopleSoft really has fallen behind on several
significant next-gen apps/strategies thanks to a lackluster R&D effort, and it
seems to me that MMTM is a much weaker shell than the typical biotech outfit.

After the article one guy e-mailed me to report that the customers due PSFT's
research in the industry-specific higher ed app because of all the bugs. PSFT's
motive is clear - satisfy the average tech/PSFT shareholder enough to keep the
share price from reflecting the true value, and hence stem any potential
employee migration to Oracle or smaller, mid-market an niche competitors.
PSFT's employees, by report, are its biggest asset at the current time, even
more so than its installed base, which may not be "vertical" enough to act as a
backbone to generate enough additional sales to continue growth near historical
rates.

As I see it, and as I posted on the Yahoo thread in vain, there are several
issues that PSFT must resolve if it is to regain its wings:

1) proprietary PeopleTools; susceptible to standards if implemented; this is a
familiar theme in tech which typically has not worked out well for those not
simply leading but dominating the pertinent market
2) difficulty porting current PSFT products too far into the mid-market given
current sales, support, design, and really no chance at the micro-market. A
significant amount of the growth in ERP (of which you speak) will be in these
two areas.
3) PeopleSoft is actually now #3 in ERP; Oracle has surpassed them. And PSFT
software largely runs on Oracle databases; Oracle is simply vicious and PSFT
knows that
4) PSFT has not been successful developing industry-specific products from the
ground-up on its own, yet its future depends on this; management knows that it
is heading into uncharted territory here and acknowledges as much
5) Despite perceptions of MSFT agreement, PSFT is behind in e-business relative
to the two already ahead of it in the ERP market, and lags especially Oracle
6) Brain drain if the stock/prospects lag too long; PSFT has never had to deal
with employee layoffs or a low stock price, and this introduces a new,
challenging dynamic into PSFT's pool of talent. Here's an area where being in
the Bay Area is really a double-edged sword.
7) Keeping up an R&D effort on par with Oracle and SAP. Oracle and SAP have a
lot more revenues with which to leverage their research. This has been many a
perpetual second-banana's dilemma.

PSFT is half as expensive as SAP or Oracle on a ratio analysis. Still, one
analyst with a buy on PSFT noted that it really should be cheaper, because of
its lesser competitive position going forward, He had a buy on it because he
felt traders would react to those ratios anyway.

One bearish issue that may not be worthy but needs watching - the increased
selling of shares by the Duffields of late.

I agree with you. I'd prefer SAP or ORCL if they fall far enough.
Knowing what I now know, wish I could have another shot at ORCL in
the low 20's.

Re: accounting shenanigans, PSFT

The CFO who just "left" PSFT to head up Momentum gave a revealing

"The fact of the matter is that right now the way the world works is investors
are very focused on things like earnings per share and price/earnings ratios.
No matter how the analysts try, I don't think they are going to have a lot of
success in adding these things together and creating a set of metrics that
don't match PeopleSoft's earnings releases.

I find that a fundamentally difficult proposition, given the models they use
and the guidance they receive. How could PeopleSoft go on record projecting any
earnings at all if it's not obligated in any way to do what the analysts
expect?"

slightly OT re: computer retailing, CPU

So my printer went on the fritz last August. I went and bought a new
refurbished model at Fry's. Doesn't work. Fry's won't honor the $40 performance
guarantee I bought from them (since it was refurbished), and is generally a
pain in the ass/attempting to screw me and succeeding. Hate Fry's. Deal with
the printer until it absolutely gives out late this last week. Saturday, Fry's
was still busy jerking its customers off, and 30 minutes with their idiot
manager gets me nowhere (besides the satisfaction of yelling "fraud" so loud
half the store could hear it) So I figure I'll just buy a new printer. Head to
the internet. First zdnet then cnet. I'm looking for cheap prices from
companies not in CA so I don't pay taxes. OnSale blows because their $523
printer turns out to be $611 when all the fees are added in. Buy.com blows for
similar reasons. And after entering all my personal info for a third time on a
third on-line site, the server responds that they cannot process my transaction
now. I'd have to wait until they're phone lines open 10AM monday.

About this time it dawns upon me I don't want to wait for UPS ground to deliver
my printer, and that this net shopping kinda bites anyway. Darned if I'm going
to enter all my personal info one more time just to find out it's all a sham or
some server doesn't work. Why they can't tell me the true price before I take
the time I don't know. So I head off to OfficeMax. They have like 3 high
schoolers manning the entire store who cannot figure out for the life of them
how to handle a customer wanting to spend $600 on a printer, find my free paper
shredder (one week only!), and still manage the 14 people in line to buy
pencils. I give up, telling my fiancee I don't even want to think about
printers for awhile.

30 minutes later I'm walking through my front door with my new "Editors choice"
printer from CompUSA. And they had the power center/breaker I was looking for.
While I was there I almost made an impulse buy of a notebook PC, some personal
finance software, and I did make an impulse buy of a $129 CheckIt Diagnostic
Suite. Don't tell me it's cheaper on the net. I don't care.

So I don't really think this anecdote is necessarily generalizable, but it
seems to me that CPU's intrinsic value is not negative or zero. Not worth $36,
but maybe $6? Still thinking about it...

I think those were my concerns at 15, but not at 5 3/4. There's intrinsic value

As far as how many people actually window-shop then go on-line to buy, I'm
doubtful it's as big as all the worry. I think that in general people
overestimate the intelligence of pc/peripheral shoppers, much like people
overestimate the intelligence of internet users and overlooked AOL as too
simple and expensive and full of nuisance. Too, insiders bought big up in the

Some recent moves :
Sold 1/2 my position in Finish Line (FINL) given the huge run-up in recent
months. Still have a full position, though, and feel the company is positioned
for long-term success, with excellent management during this downturn in the
industry. No doubt the NCAA tournament has helped, and now with the return of
baseball (IMO, the fever is back among fans thanks to last year's HR battle),
FINL might get an unexpected tailwind.

Sold 1/2 my position in Telesp Cellular (TCP), Brazil's best-positioned
cellular player, due to sheer overweighting in my portfolio. I had averaged
down aggressively when it got to the 13's, and now the position just got too
huge. Still have a full position.
I'm retaining my overweighted position in Unibanco (UBB), which is now my
largest position with the TCP sale.

I added to Deswell at a recent 8 7/8, and as noted I established a new position
in CPU at 5 3/4, but the sales above leave me with enough cash for two more
positions. Looking at Philip Morris (MO, due to long-term track record), JD
Edwards (JDEC, due to long history of mgmnt, and conservative, good positioning
in ERP industry for rapid reversal of fortunes in its mid-market focus), Men's
Wearhouse(SUIT, my ValueStocks.net March pick of the month), and Informix
(IFMX, well on its way to turnaround but getting held down artificially IMO by
previous buyers at higher prices getting out). I still like every position in
the ValueStocks.net fund and I am considering a position in Theragenics (TGX),
the Jan pick given its strong balance sheet/demographics at its back/better
product than comp/insider buying offset by its having only one product and
being biotech, but with the run-up in oil and the ag equips the gimmes are
getting fewer and far between IMO.

My dilemma of when to sell my winners is still a Q I wrestle with. After all
they keep going up. I'm finding that I feel best if I unload half a position
after a substantial quick run of 70-100% and redeploy to a deeper value
situation soon thereafter. Any other suggestions for value investors? I for one
am wary of the quick spikes that many traditional value stocks have been making
in this market, only to fall substantially when the liquidity dries up.

John,

I'd go with Jim. Don't see the industry in value terms yet. One overlooked IPO
I'm watching is Gabelli, but I still have lots of worries to resolve on that
one. BEN has a ways to go down before I get interested. Also watching Value

Ok, so I look up on my old friend General Employment (JOB) and
can't believe what I'm seeing : $4 3/16, less than 1/3 its 52 week

for many a year, and find Robert Half is indeed half - now half its 52 week
high. Our old fav Olsten (OLS) is also way down, now under $6. I gotta wonder
why this industry is down, and if it hasn't been overdone a bit. The financial

 This time demand has barely picked up, even though the price has fallen by

Duh (no offense to you, John). And the Economist gives concern over
global-warming, unseasonably warm weather as two plausible reasons. At least
they mention the global economy, but to me this is the entire
reason. Most of the undeveloped pseudo-industrial world has
ceased to develop itself, giving little to no support to oil as it careens to
new lows. To me, the article is incredibly alarmist, and may be something of a
bottom-feeding signal in itself. After all, since they researched the article
and got all these comments, oil is up to $15/barrel. With journalism, it's all

My assets have been frozen!

I want to get this warning out. The portfolio that I run as the VSN fund at my
web site has been frozen, legally. I just attempted to switch that portfolio
from Citibank to E-trade. I have accounts in both places. Citibank, upon
getting the notice from E-trade, cancels my account. E-trade says the
securities won't be present on their end for a week or two! So I can't trade in
or out of any of my positions. And this is when I already have an open account
on the receiving end.

Part of me says thankfully I'm a value investor/long-term holder. I don't think
too much damage can be done by me not trading it for a week (except those
volatile Brazil positions, which I was evaluating today when I found out the
assets weren't there) or probably even a year. In fact, it might be for the
best. But ethically I feel this is reprehensible. If this is to happen, E-trade
should have it way up in bold somewhere. If I were a 1-2 day trader, I'd be
suing.

I have to say that Jim and I in the last few years (and I gather this from
private e-mail as well as here) have had synchronicity in terms of our market
view, but he has been much more successful than I in terms of actually yanking
his money out of the market and rescuing his returns. From our discussions, i'd
give a wild guess it's added about 10% more to his yearly gains than mine.

So here I am, with my portfolio up 15%. I haven't seen the holdings of Royce,
but it wouldn't surprise me if there was overlap. The distribution of my
holdings by market cap:
two < 50M
three 100 - 500M
three 500M - 1B
four 1B-2B
two 2B-3B
two 5B-10B
one 15-20B

I'm small cap since I'm mostly in <3B market caps but I'm really just looking
for value where I can get it. I'm also now 15% cash. (and I'll stay that way at
least until my funds are unfrozen)

What works? Well, diversification among undervalued names (as Paul Senior has
preached) is the tack I'm taking. I've come to appreciate the value of
diversification. Tapdog, if your portfolio is similar to mine, and you aren't
up 10-15% yet this year (there was a significant Jan effect this year), then
there's probably a management issue rather than a selection issue in your
portfolio. And maybe diversification is the key. The way small caps are going,
some are taking huge hits which could turn portfolios upside down. WHX, my
worst performer, is down 15.5% this year. But it's just a few percent of the
portfolio, not 15% like it would've been a few years ago. And I've found that
predicting movements in individual stocks over even a few years is very, very
hard. Midway and Deswell have taught me that.

FTR, my portfolio more or less moves with the market now, and usually daily
fluctuation is less than 1%. Except it has been outperforming mainly by being
down less than the market on down days, with occassional moderate
outperformance. Today, the S&P is down 1.94%, and I'm down 1.39%. That's been
typical. And I owe Paul and Al Frank for the improvement in my money management
because they helped me see diversification as tool not just of the weak. If
anything that Buffett's done can be said to have hurt value investors, IMO it's
his witticisms regarding diversification as a weapon of the ignorant or lazy.

Excellent info, and what is probably behind the price drop more than anything
else. Of course, only a tiny fraction of eligible patients are even made aware
of the procedure, and the benfits in terms of side effects are substantial.
IMO, the surgery-oriented bent of urologists is the bigger problem, as patients
are less informed of all options than they should be, which inhibits standard
of care formulations that would favor the procedure. Medicine is a hierarchal,
traditional, egotistical field. Despite all the hype about peer-review-and it

Right now, manu housing (via Champion) is 3.3% of my portfolio, but I'm looking
to increase my position in Champion specifically. Management describes the rise
in pipeline inventory as concentrated in a "handful of states," but that it is
nevertheless concerning due to an unprofessional push by suppliers and finance
companies into the channel. Given Champion's push into retail, and Champion's
own management concerns that retail locations have grown faster than market
growth, this is the biggest risk for this investment. The top six retailers
have a combined 17% market share, though, and consolidation is occurring.
Champion will be one of the consolidators and benefit from this, with more
control over inventory levels in the future. Management is very able. I'm being
careful, though. After I've initiated a position, I try to keep a rule of not
adding again until the stock price has fallen by at least 1/3. Bought Champion
at 21, so I'm rooting for 14 and staving off urges to buy sooner.

Nope, still holding for a better recovery. I realize that e.g. on FINL, it goes
from 7 1/2 to 14 1/2 and I sell all, well, I really only have 11 -12 at most to
reinvest after taxes. Hence I sold 1/2 UBB, 1/2 FINL, and 1/2 TCP only because
they ran up far beyond expectations given the time frame. UBB went from 10 1/2
to 18 1/2, TCP from 13 5/8 to 25, and FINL from 7 7/16 to 14 3/4. And UBB and
TCP went only because I had overweighted those positions and I ended up way
"too Brazil" after the rally. NH would have to get to the high teens before I
consider selling half, and near $30 before I even consider selling the rest. NH
I've a lot of confidence in, and have bought it for every account I manage, all
recently just under 9.

In any case, I can't trade NH in the VSN fund because the assets are frozen
thanks to Etrade/Citibank. Looks like Robert Half is slipping away from me as
my assets remain frozen. I had tried to enter an order two days ago at 30 3/8

And all of a sudden I'm a different kind of "net" investor...

There is something irrational happening in CPU today, but some of us saw it
coming.

We already knew that CPU acquired the first requisite property of any bona fide
stock market rocket: an N/A PE on Yahoo. Investors today therefore lose their
only barometer. Remember, this is a good thing.

And we could see it coming (because CPU told us so a few months back) that they
were going to revamp and spin-off their 'net operations. But we also know that
the typical CPU shareholder can't see more than a few minutes into the future.
So then it crashes drastically to the high $5's, and for this price, I'm
thinking bargain. After all, it's CompUSA. The name has as much potential for
becoming gold-plated like AOL. In fact, the whole situation reminded me a lot
of when AOL was a "commodity" supplier of outdated
internet-for-babies-and-old-folks-since-they-were-the-only-ones-that-would-tole
ate-not-ever-getting-online-on-the-first-twenty-tries.

So then today, CPU announces something that they already announced: a revamped
site for on-line computer sales. The volume triples in 2 hours and the stock
jumps 22%. Why? Oh, because now the site's up. Today's typical investor can now
use that goldfish memory and click right over and see it. And then click right
over to their broker and buy the stock. And the institutions, pathetically, are
playing the same game.

Wayne's right. If you are buying back shares above book value, then you are
decreasing your per-share book value. If you think about it a bit, it makes

OK, so I never went to biz school, but I'll confess I've studied
finance texts and done mini-cases to get up to speed a bit. Where all of what I
studied fits in to a successful investment strategy, I don't know. It seems
trial-and-error and Graham and Buffett have been more helpful.

Looking at Journal Register (JRC) is a good example. So there's this M&M
proposition that debt/equity ratio doesn't affect firm value, and that if it
does it's mainly because of taxes, and that because of this stable growth firms
with minimal tax loss reserves should take on lots of debt to decrease their
weighted average cost of capital, constrained by the increased return required
by investors for the increased risk of bankruptcy. That's way way
oversimplified to the point of having some errors, I know. Still it tells maybe
that JRC maybe is doing the right thing with all its debt though.

So JRC has all this debt, all these acquisitions, a big A&D expense, free cash
flow of $66M up steadily from $53M 2 years ago, with annual interest payments
(tax-deductible of course) of $45M last year, down from a little over $50M a
few years ago. To me, the cash flow doesn't offset the interest expense enough
to catch my eye, especially given the market cap, but I do see that the trend
is favorable. And I see that I'm not worried about them going bankrupt.

I'm not sure what to make of it. I liked Tricon Global at $26 despite negative
equity and it has done very well. But then I knew that Pepsi had purposely
loaded Tricon with debt precisely because the cash flow was so high. The
perception of newspapers is in the dumps, too, as restaurant stocks have been.
But Tricon was one of the top 10 performers in the S&P 500 last year. So
isolated success stories do happen within depressed industries and debt/equity
or -(equity) isn't prohibitive of this.

And I appreciate that JRC is probably earning its weighted cost of capital. I
haven't taken the time to figure it out, but I'm assuming its WACC is pretty
low.

Interesting. It's still making new lows. I'll stand back and see how cheap it
gets. And I'm still not convinced that small-town newspapers won't lose out to
the internet, but that's not entering my decision now.

The valuation of Loews is asset-based. They have several holdings which are
already valued by the marketplace, such CNA and Diamond Offshore, which the
market values at a current ~$6 billion. LTR now trades at $8.5 billion. I'd
assume any sale would be around Diamond's true worth of around $3.5 billion and
CNA's around $5 billion. So to me, you get the hotels, Bulova watch, Tisch
investment prowess and Lorillard for free. Lorillard is the lowest
cost-per-pack producer, and grew revenues 18% last year. It can generate half a
billion in cash flow/year. So I'd say it's worth at the very least $4 billion
(8XCF, MO is at around 14XCF). Basically, the market doesn't respect asset
plays today. So my premise is that Lorillard has a positive present value. If
one believes, as the market does currently, that Lorillard (which is the most
profitable cigarette co on a per pack basis, with the fastest-growing premium
brand) has a negative value, then LTR would not be as big a value. But it still
would have a margin of safety from here.

Loews today is denying all rumors. To me, CNA is large and a turnaround
candidate in the right hands.

Over on Hvide Marine's board, the Altman bankruptcy predictor was used to
predict "near death" for HMAR. I responded that the quantitative model was neat
but that I could tell the same by the SEC forms and some common sense. I'm no
fan of models like these either.

But Bob's point about JRC is relevant I think. You have a stock of a company
that is run in Draconian fashion, and the papers generally suck. How many of
these papers really have a monopoly in their little town? From the Yahoo board,
which is a pretty emotional place, one would think that these things are
getting run into the ground. But not having been to these towns I don't know.
And with the stock making steady new lows, it's worth it to let it go, see how
far it falls.

On another note, I see that Anchor Gaming (SLOT) and IGT are falling in
response to pending legislation and decreases in casino builds. I'm preparing
to buy both. The logic behind their falls just doesn't hold. It seems to me
that IGT, even if it were forced to sell machines, could just charge huge
prices for them to reflected discounted future cash flows. They own over 70% of
the market. SLOT just looks too good to be true, although I'd like more insider
buying. I expect a pretty good bounce once the legislation is out of the way

That mutual funds will find a crisis in the redemption/selling stock balance is
for me a given.

I frequently tell colleagues that I envision a time in the future when a group
of workers sitting around the water cooler are talking about their mutual
funds. The mood is resignation after panic. The market is crashing, and some
event has finally spooked the American public. Everyone is pulling out of
mutual funds, but the mutual funds can no longer guarantee that the sale will
get done on time. They can't sell stock fast enough. Fred says, "Fidelity will
get me my money by Friday." Arney chimes in, "Lucky you, Vanguard says it'll
take a week."

The same mechanism that has caused small caps to fall flat (and continue
falling flat this year) will cause large caps to fall hard when the time comes.
And mutual fund cos will bankrupt themselves or exist in ignominy thanks to
endless barrages of lawsuits.

I usually finish up my sermon by saying something like "The average shareholder

Wayne,

My understanding is limited. Another poster here I know has spent quite a bit
of time on them and maybe will post more.

But my style is as much contrarian as it is value now. And SLOT and IGT are
very much contrarian, with big price falls, some insider buying at higher
prices (IGT at 20, SLOT at 50).

My understanding of the legislation is that it is getting watered down and may
not pass. Graham has noted that the market overpunishes pending legislation. As
this legislation gets watered down, the stock prices have remained low.

http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/archives/1999/mar/23/508574816.html

There are risks, the most of significant of which are highlighted in this
article, where IGT claims there's no money to be made in just selling slots.
And there's a lot of uncertainty in the biz relationship between IGT and the
casinos.

http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/archives/1999/mar/08/508507725.html

SLOT is diversifying, and I like the longer-term trends in its stock price, the
growth opportunities given its size, and I don't mind its recent acquisition,
which I think fits and already has good cash flow.
SLOT has an underleveraged balance sheet.

My feeling is that IGT and SLOT will survive, and that the smallest players
will be hurt even more, as IGT claims.
And if the legislation either doesn't pass or passes in a milder form, well,
then the stocks should rebound.

To be wrong is OK, but to persist in
being wrong again and again by averaging down repeatedly doesn't sit well. 

Averaging down can be both wonderful and deadly. I found a simple rule that
helps me, at least, deal with this (or at least give me confidence that I think
I know how to deal with this ;)). I have the utmost confidence in Deswell
still, by the way.

First I had to decide that I wasn't going to average down more than once in any
stock. And once I decided that, I decided that if I were to average down, it
would have to make a significant difference in my basis, enough to offset the
increased risk signalled by being wrong once. And a 20% drop doesn't do it - my
cost basis is still 90% of original. I've decided on a 33% rule - a stock I
have the utmost confidence in must fall at least 33% before I will even
consider it again. And if I can I'll try to hold off for a 50% drop.

A corollary to this is that I won't buy a stock again at the same price or at a
higher price unless significantly material new information is discovered by me.

These rules have caused by default, but also by design, the number of stocks in
my portfolio to grow and grow.

The days of saying, "wow, this is cheap" "wow,it's still cheap" "wow, it's even
cheaper" "wow, now it is really cheap" and buying at each of those "decision"
points (and thereby concentrating my portfolio by default), are behind me.

Round two of piddly me v. Amazon

I shoulda never said never. Last time I shorted at 113, covered 1/3 at 155, and
covered the remaining 2/3 at 104.

Jeffrey, I very much respect your opinion. And I agree with all my heart.

But my heart has never been a very good investor - hence the 24 points I gave
to AMZN investors. Still, there'll probably always be a part of my portfolio
that I reserve for actively betting against the tulips.

It probably won't be fun when the world crashes down. But I'm not going to
refuse to buy stocks that meet my criteria: a deep contrarian play of a
business I'd like to buy outright. So far this year, it's putting me ahead of
the Nasdaq in a tech-free manner, and it's really hard to give up something
that's working. Especially when everywhere I see people saying that my type of
strategy isn't working in this market. In fact, I'm working even harder to be
faithful to my strategy, and refine what's working, toss what's not.

Is it really true that when the internets crash the whole market will crash?
With how incredibly narrow this market is, can it be that it is representative
of a fragmented market that will rise and fall heterogeneously in ways that the
indices can never measure? After all, the indices certainly have not
represented the intelligent investor the last few years on the way up. Why will
they on the way down?

I don't know the answer to these questions, but for now I'm risking be one of

selection rather than market calls.

I'm starting to wonder when the managers of all these undervalued micro and

valuation between small and large caps, I can't imagine that many small caps

Why wouldn't we be interested in a Buffett stock? I too was looking at APC in

Second, if I'm not mistaken, APC is the product of choice for corporate america

Gilette in razors?

Third, what is it in PC sales are slowing? I thought unit volumes are up but
ASP's are down so there's a net negative in dollars, not units produced. And
unit volumes are what drive USP sales, no?

 I agree with the pessimists. If a rising tide don't lift your particular boat,

I guess since my boat is being floated by this rising tide for now, I'm just a
bit optimistic. But are you insinuating that I am doing something contrary to
value principles to get my returns this year? And if so, then why shouldn't it
continue, and still have some downside protection in the event of a meltdown?
(this is all rhetorical)

I think we should be clear that it will take a meltdown for the market to
change character. 20% corrections don't do it. Something needs to threaten the
mutual funds, threaten the public into withdrawing large sums all at once,
threaten them to stop rolling over 100% of their retirment into index funds. No
doubt about it - the average investor thinks of an S&P index fund as equivalent
to a money market in terms of safety. Having Easter in a cocktail party setting

In your experience is medical capital equipment different by nature than say ag

machines at a relatively even speed, unlike the demand in other heavy equipment

fashion?

This gets more subtle, but the type of machines made by Varian don't have very
quick technology cycles, and Varian is fairly dominant enough,with enough
capital expense/barrier to entry, to control that to an extent. As the
population ages, there will be more demand for these machines. What would cause
a slump in demand? I would think it would be rather steady slow growth, with a
long life to each product cycle. Maybe like the steadiness IBM exhibited in its
mainframe heyday, except slower growth.

worst form of hypocrisy on the part of the ophthalmologists who perform it. I
am sure the stock will do well, but only because of an eager, unknowing patient
base, and financially-motivated physicians who will use asymmetric information
to foist their services on the public.

On just about every measure but size, SLOT does look better than IGT, I agree.
Still, passed on SLOT today. This is too nitpicky, and tells me that maybe I'm
just making up reasons not to buy it, but the stock runs up 25% in advance of
good news in the legislature, and then when the news breaks, the stock does
nothing. If nothing else, this tells me that I don't know what moves this
stock, and even if I did, it would be too late.

I did go with a few moves though, reflecting an effort to improve my portfolio
management skills relative to my stockpicking. I'm not convinced they go hand
in hand.

I unloaded WHX and Loews. Since I'm a bottomfisher, I try to get my ducks in a
row before buying. When the market repeatedly tells me I'm wrong, well, at some
point I have to stop fighting it. I don't want to follow any stock into
bankruptcy, so I've set 25% fall without any new information or fundamental
realization as my breakpoint. And both these just cleared that threshold. My
sells (e.g. Case) have done pretty well though, so someone might want to buy
these or at least take a look. Why Loews is falling so much, I don't know. No
respect for asset plays, I guess.

I used the proceeds to upgrade the dividend yield on my port. Bought some UST
as a rough parallel/favorable tax switch to Loews, but with a stable dividend
above 6%. I like that UST has fallen so much in sympathy with Loews/MO/RN
despite the renewed dividend increases and share buyback. UST has much less
potential liability than the other tobaccos, and the CEO is looking for 10%
earnings growth this year. I also added some more MO.

The steel money, well I really wanted to put it back into steel. Ispat,
National Steel have looked like my two best ideas, but I couldn't pull the
trigger on either today. So I went to the REIT sector, toyed with Public
Storage then went with EastGroup (EGP). So the port of 20 stocks now yields
3.86%. Safety in a downturn, maybe. And now I'm out of steel.

 This is a lousy business. End of discussion for me.

Not so fast. First off, huh? This is from Jim, he of Tejon Ranch? Champion of
Penobscot? Repeat buyer of Hyde...er Saucony?

Ok, the following is thrown together quickly, so don't laugh if there's some
glaring errors (and I am still investigating BGP):

The way I look at it, BKS (blech, blech) trades at a PE of 29, 5 times
leveraged book with a debt/equity of nearly 1, and 15 pennies/share in cash. It
also gets a profit margin of 1.9% for a PSR of 0.84. ROE is 17% but it's
leveraged. The stock is about 25% off 52 week highs and running into a lot of
overhead pressure.

BGP, which I like visiting better anyway (hey, I met Aerosmith there), trades
at a PE of 14, under 2X debt-free book, and 53 pennies per share in cash. With
a profit margin of 3.4% for a PSR of 0.48. ROE is 15%. And that's a stable
business. The stock is 65% off 52 week highs and basing.

This didn't persuade me until BGP made their announcement. Why? Because BGP has
prudent management, and they're proving it by keeping a level head about this
whole internet thing. They state they will not throw money down that hole. And
hole it is, right? Unless you've reversed your position on Amazon's business
economics.

That's shabby?

I see visiting bookstores as a continuing trend that demographics favor, as the
population ages, and even the young crowd things that hanging out in the local
bookstore is fun.

Hey, BGP's superstore same store trends are still up. Gross margins are still
increasing due to tighter inventory controls. It's not perfect, I know, and
it's a probably a good business only one quarter of the year.

Still, it's a call I'm about to make good on.

You knew it. SO CHEAP in fact that I had to speculate a few days ago that your

leaders crashing while our value stocks rise. The sheer suicidal frustration of
value investors tipped at least me off to this, but also the valuations. What
made you think that the REITS would get cheaper? That Ag equips could get
cheaper? That manufactured housing would get cheaper? And even if they did, no
biggie because it wouldn't be sustainable.

Brazil was also up big today. Value will out...

I did have one stock down big for me today. Deswell. That piece has been one
huge ball and chain around my foot. Still gotta believe.

are you saying borders has a natural advantage in that it makes money and
amazon is
destined to always lose money 

yes. and if amzn does make money, it won't be very much.

If anything, that I openly bash Amazon's business economics while taking
advantage of them by taking an additional 15-30% off their margins for every
book I sell off the site (not that many buy there - it's just a convenience,
really) is a validation that I'm not very biased here.

And yes, when I think of all the analysts and investors that have been wrong
from the start on Amazon.com, it does make me smile.

And it doesn't matter how fast you turn inventory or don't carry inventory if
you do it at as big a loss as Amazon does. Even Blodgett admits it is a gamble
whether Amazon will EVER make money. I don't see any leverage there to raise
prices.

Well, I did go ahead and take a position in BGP today.

Didn't think it was a "fast moving market", so I entered a market order. There
was a delay of about 15 minutes when I couldn't get a confirmation and boom,
when it shows up there I got it at 16 3/4, high for the am so far. About a
point higher than I was willing to settle for today, and nearly two points
higher than I had been willing to settle for two days ago. This was 50% my
impatience and 50% I don't know what. I got a funny feeling as the confirmation
took longer and longer to come back. Value investors aren't supposed to have to

Re: shorting amazon

Near old highs are the best places to short - you have a built in exit. If it
breaks through 200, I cover. Basically, it's like shorting a a stock at 19 that
you think could easily fall to 7-10, but limit your loss at 20.

In any case, now I'm playing with the house's money. I just made 30 points in a

I used Market Guide's for a long time, but was frustrated by the inaccuracies
in their data sets (such as computing market cap off only the A shares when B
shares exist). Lots of false net nets. Still, it has customizable variables
(though limited primary variables with which to create them). And you can
dowload the data set on your own schedule (pay as you go).

CompuStat. Eegad. It's not worth it. There's a limitation to screeing anyway
(see my disclaimer on the screening session of my web page).

Value Line has always appealed because that's what Buffett claims to use, and
you aren't necessarily limited. They have a more expensive, expanded package as
well. I've come very close to using it.

But my favorite is MSN Investor's Investment Finder screener. Easy, cheap (for
me it's free, and I'm not sure what they charge for investor these days but I
think it's like less than 10/month).
And most of all the data is usually pretty accurate. I find the limitation in
the tool is that it is a bit imprecise. It does allow ranking.

Re: VAR

Since the published numbers in the databases mean nothing, I compiled
my own based on pro forma numbers for VAR and recent reports by
several cos identified as being in the same industry/competitors by
VAR's investment bank. I'll post them here to support what I said
about being willing to buy VAR at a little cheaper prices.

VAR ADAC BCR OXE SLMD
P/B 3.8 1.9 4.8 3.1 0.9
P/S 0.96 0.84 2.8 1.8 0.56
ROE 28% 12% 20% 15% 3%
LTD/E 0.36 0 0.28 0 0.40
P/E 13.7 16.6 24 21.5 36
%NM 7% 5% 12% 9% 1.6%
CR 1.4 1.6 1.6 3.4 2.8
Yld 0 0 1.5% 0 0

VAR is Varian Medical. ADAC is ADAC Labs. BCR is CR Bard. OXE is OEC
Medical. SLMD is Spacelab Medical.

CR Bard is the big one, with the multi-billion market cap and standard
big-company numbers. Well managed with all the right ratios. Just
wish it was a little cheaper.

OEC Medical is a turnaround of sorts, and is growing more than VAR.
There's a lot to recommend this stock, but it remains a small player
with more risk than CR Bard. It would have to be cheaper.

Varian is just cheap. World-class tech, and without a lot of direct
compeition in its oncology division. Management is a question mark,
and they don't seem very incentivized to me. 25% of VAR's sales are
in the imaging area - they sell x-ray tubes to most of the world's big
suppliers of x-ray and CT equipment. The funny thing is that all of
these suppliers have their own in-house x-ray tube production. And
they still buy from Varian. In fact, 1/2 of all mammography machines
and 1/4 of all CAT scanners contain Varian tubes! This is both a
threat and a commendation. I view these sales as stable with mild
growth potential.

The oncology group is what's growing, and there's a
software/information technology component to it. The model is akin to
IBM's software for its mainframes. There is an opportunity for
further service revenue via software updates.

For having a ratio analysis that's as good as it is, VAR seems to
trade at a discount to its peers. And it earns a very decent ROE
given its industry. That ROE is probably protected to a degree thanks
to market position/the Varian brand.

Where's the margin of safety? VAR is only growing its top line around
7%, and the results are lumpy. The wild card is the ability to cut
costs and revamp operations now that VAR is free on its own. I see
this as a limited opportunity. Cap ex will remain around 2.5% of
sales, and the opportunity for margin expansion by cutting is probably
capped somewhere below 10%. The real growth will have to keep coming
form the oncology division.

Threats are mainly financial in nature, with reimbursement and a
shrinking health care pie the big issues. This is the reason for the
slump throughout the health care sector.

Still, I'm looking at putting together a mini-portfolio of biotech,
medical device, and care companies as these cos continue to get
cheaper, and VAR would be a nice core holding. I haven't bought
anything yet.

And if one is worried about antiangiogenesis drugs curing cancer, buy
a tiny dollop of ENMD to pair to a full position in VAR. If this
hypothesis is even halfway correct, the ENMD profits will more than
make up for any loss in VAR.

all either. It's just a big, good, well-run medical device company.

Re: AMZN, AAPL, my port

Thanks. It's up again. Maybe I'll get a chance to short it a third time.

Today I messed around with my portfolio.

I'm out of Brazil. After liquidating 1/2 positions in Unibanco and Telesp
Cellular a few points ago, I got out entirely today. Hopefully they'll get
acutely undervalued again.

Also sold half my Mattel, half my Callaway and the remaining half of my Finish
Line after their recent jumps. And I got out of Noble Drilling. I like all
these but seems to me that they've all jumped for no good fundamental reason
other than returning to near-fair valuation after steep undervaluation. This
was my reasoning for getting out of Tricon Global, so watch these rocket ;0

And I'm out of BHP. Old Broken Hill was supposed to be a 50% gainer in two
years, not three months. I'll take it.

What did I buy? Apple (AAPL).

First off, think about the market cap: 5.88 billion. For Apple. This is a
company that I think has gotten its ducks in a row, and once it fights through
all the resistance in the 30's and 40's can spring ever higher. One of those
stocks we'll look back on and say, "I could've had it at 15X earnings, 6X
operating cash flow." For value investors the interesting thing is the
$11.36/share in cash net of debt. This means the enterprise itself is trading
at just about 4X operating cash flow. The company is a cash machine of late,
and is carrying virtually no inventory. This is a company that seems to me to
have really righted itself. But the current investors are too concerned with
every little $1 fluctuation to let it go higher. And the value investors are
too scared away by the technology and/or hating to buy a stock that's doubled
in the last few years. The enterprise is well under sales, and the company is
under 3X book despite ROE IMO sustainable in the 20-30% range.

Still with about 23% cash to spend myself.

I actually reinvested quite a bit of my cash today.

I bought more MO, more Robert Half, more Borders, more Apple. With most of
these I was cash-constrained when I initiated the positions, so I was just
waiting for the cash to become available to take a more substantial position.
After reviewing my watch list, and my holdings, these four stood out as being
definitely better than a new pick.

I also bought two new ones. All of these are long-term holdings in my view. IMO
I've converted some of my deep value "pop" money into some quality companies
with good long-term records.

The first is American Power Conversion (APCC). Trading at historical lows on
ratio analysis basis. Seems to have a good amount of brand equity in the power
field, which I can imagine will only grow. There's been some new competition
which has knocked down their ultra-high returns a bit. But a little
investigation with some tech-savvy friends say this is boring, but essential to
just about any large enterprise. Well, it may fall a bit, and it's not a deep
value, but it's not a used cigar butt either.

The other is HRPT Properties Trust (HRP). I've already got a luxury hotel reit
(LHO), a warehouse reit (EGP), and I wanted another subsector of REITs that had
been killed. HRP seems well-managed in a time of turmoil for health care REITs.
A decent yield, with a relatively low D/E.

Still got a little cash to spend. My intent is to spend it.

I guess my beef with Loews is that yes, it is an asset play, but
it is so well-known. I love asset plays, but this one everyone
knows that it trades at a big discount and that it has all these
assets. Barron's publicizes it. Forbes publicizes it. And everyone
just says, yeah, it's way undervalued. And no one buys.

I called Loews to get some answers when I was trying to figure
out the asset side of the equation a few months ago. Most people
at Loews don't even know what they're sitting on, other than that
it's a lot and its undervalued. And no one buys.

So there's no catalyst. And I figure it's because, well, how are these returns
going to trickle down to shareholders. If Tisch isn't going to liquidate, spin
off or sell its assets, then the bet is he'll die and someone else will in a
reasonable time. If not, well, the present value to me of all those assets
might be very small.

If management recognizes that the company is being perpetually undervalued by
the stock market, then it has a fiduciary responsibility IMO to start
liquidating. If the world thinks Lorillard is such a liability, well then sell
it for $6 billion and show the world it's not.

I figure at $120 I'd be buying a conservative dollar for a dollar. If it hits

The way I look at it, the company is growing, is profitable, with good cash
flow. TMF Boring argues with me, saying that the cash flow is poor. Don't get
it. I see them expanding aggressively, growing revenues and the bottom line
with good margins given the business, and all out of cash flow. This tells me
they can keep expanding out of cash flow.

No doubt the superstores are where that cash flow comes from. Walden's, well...
But hey if it had no warts it wouldn't have fallen 65%. I think by focusing on
these warts, investors will overlook the value here. The co and the business
are not perfect, but they are now undervalued.

Re: mall leases, IMO these should probably be capitalized and thought of as a
form of debt. But that's another wart. In spite of these things the company
continues to grow its top and bottom lines, and continues to expand. IMO people
are missing the forest for the trees.

This gets into the new vs old paradigm again.

Will internet retailers entirely replace physical ones?

Will direct insurance entirely replace agent ones?

Will direct manufacturer on line sales alienate the channel to the
point of non-viability?

So will Amazon put Borders out of business? Will GEICO put AllState out of
business? Will Compaq fail because it is too far behind Dell and other direct
models?

The market seems to be voting yes. Amazon can acquire Borders
in entirety by issuing just 3% of its stock.

IMO this is way too extreme, but rationally I must admit that one would expect
that the very last ones to admit to this paradigm
shift would be located on some archaic thread called "Value

Longer term, recent studies have shown net customers are generally very price
sensitive and in 2 or 3 years, when the sales tax advantage is eliminated, 25%
of those price sensitive shoppers will return to local retail.

Which studies? Not to challenge you, but just for my own info database.

The sales tax isn't the whole price difference, so the implication is that the
retailer absolutely must have the lower total price to attract both initial and
repeat businesss. And even so, 25% will leave if the lower price is just
moderately lower. IOW, people like to shop, like to browse bookstores, etc.

Seems to me that money is leaving the value sector once again.
The last few days, if it weren't for my Apple, American Power,

falling once again. The oils and minerals are also falling. I recently rotated
out of the heavy cyclical concentration I had and into some undervalued techs,
evidently just in time. I may be rotating back pretty quick given the lopsided
falls in certain stocks relative to the rally in the growth/techs. There's
still some downside there (after all, LHO isn't at 8 1/2 again yet), and I'm

Tobacco keeps getting kicked in the teeth. And the implications are grim for a
wide variety of companies, not just tobacco.

Lorillard just lost a case filed by a man with mesothelioma, a type of lung
cancer that is nearly always fatal and is linked to asbestos exposure. The man
is elderly, and last smoked Lorillard's asbestos-containing cigarettes over 3
decades ago. The adverse health effects of asbestos were not known until over 2
1/2 decades later. Yet Lorillard is liable. This sounds ridiculous, especially,
since Lorillard had added the asbestos to decrease the particulate emissions of
cigarettes.

Even more ridiculous is the man worked manufacturing airplane stuff for Owens
Corning for most of his life. If ever there is a reason he got mesothelioma,
it's this.

So what did he do? He sued both, and Lorillard was found liable while Owens
settled. Implicit guilt on both parties. To me, very sad, though not as
ridiculous as an 80 million dollar judgement against Philip Morris for a smoker
who died probably because he smoked Pall Malls (NOT a MO brand). But the net is
that I am realizing the tobacco risk is very high, and that, while I won't sell
my MO or UST positions yet, I will have to re-evaluate. The reason is that
companies are being found liable on even the slightest suggestion that they
might be liable. No proof necessary. And the awards are exorbitant. This sort
of irrationality is a big wild card.

This big "not my responsibility...but who can I blame?" attitude sweeping the
country, especially in the aftermath of the Littleton disaster, is to me a big
risk now for tobacco, gun companies, and eventually any company that makes
high-fat food, or sells it. Watch out Cheesecake Factory. Future liability
should be figured into the valuation of Keebler and any other dealer of fat.
And don't forget sports equipment companies that entice adults to injure
themselves running and such. Nike, beware.

Meanwhile, I'm getting sick seeing such an outpouring of self-righteous
hypocrisy and ignorance. So who can I sue for my nausea?

Exactly. One of the pluses for MO over the others was the apparent strength
that Marlboro was experiencing overseas. But if humans as a group (and
worldwide) are prone to finding liability decades after the event or even
non-event, then the whole industry is open to immense uncertainty that could
affect their viability. I was brushing it off until recent cases highlighted
the seriousness of this to investors considering the beaten-up sector. I had
thought that eventually there would be one big lawsuit or that people would
tire of the lawsuits. But it looks like settling with the states just revealed
some vulnerability and now everybody and their mother is attacking. The
ridiculous and unfair awards in these cases just must provoke even more
lawsuits. I mean, it is a very simple mind that thinks "I smoked Pall Mall's
for 30 years, and then Marlboro the last 10, and I got lung cancer, so
Marlboro's to blame."

But it's the same reason that there will always be ob-gyns losing cerebral
palsy malpractice suits. Greed and the fact that the average
IQ really is just 100.

What Tobacco really needs is the Supreme Court to stand up and issue a ruling
on a case significant enough to be a deterrant to other frivolous tobacco
liability cases. One such case is moving to the docket soon. If the ruling is
in Tobacco's favor, I'd expect there to be a big jump in the stocks. If not, a
crash. And there's a lot of risk in that.

Jeffrey,

Always wary of responding off the top of my head to you, since
inevitably you've put more thought into your question and the potential answers
than I put in my sometimes-flippant responses.

Here goes anyway:
Most stocks I follow have had quite a bounce of late off their lows.
Midway included. So the threat is a quick 25-30% loss if the value trend
reverses.

What is close?
I see Fair Isaac (FIC) and J.D. Edwards (JDEC) as millenium plays in reverse.
They are falling because of Y2K, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
Fair Isaac I've already discussed. A leader in their niche at historical ratio
lows. J.D. Edwards falls in the ERP category, but it mainly sells to the
mid-cap market. It does not face the same limitations that PSFT and SAP do
(these two face a saturated market in addition to Y2K). In fact, PSFT and SAP
would love to move into JD Edwards' territory, but are limited by the design of
their software. Recently JDEC jumped on a bad preannouncement. That tells me it
is hitting its bottom. The bugger is that management is still selling. On a
ratio basis, JDEC is twice as cheap as PSFT, with a great balance sheet and no
debt.

Champion Homes and Borders you already know about. I'm not the only one who
likes Borders. Dreman devoted some space to it in the May 3rd Forbes. Robert
Half I've already mentioned as well. Anchor Gaming I did buy some around recent
prices. When these turn, I see easy 50% gains in relatively short periods. And
the downside is limited.

Elamex (ELAMF) is as cheap as ever.

In, yes, semiconductors, my old favorite Speedfam, now Speedfam-IPEC has a lot
of short-sighted shareholders. Looks decent to me as a down-and-out cyclical
currently scraping bottom with a lot of doubters but a lot of cash and below
book, low ratios. A double at some point in the next few years.A great SI
thread with an excellent analyst Mr. Sam.

In restaurants, I really do like BUNZ the most. I don't have it entirely
figured out, but 50% isn't a stretch by any means. They are profitable, and
there's a lot of areas yet to expand into. Can't wait for them to get to
Silicon Valley.

I've thought a lot lately of retailers and lease obligations.
The ROIC of just about every chain I'm looking at is very much

Re: ROIC

My denominator is

assets minus excess cash minus trade accounts payable minus accrued expenses
plus PV of lease obligations

My numerator is

net income adjusted for 35% taxes plus goodwill amortization plus interest

So the thing I'm missing is that I'm supposed to add back rent expense to the
numerator if I add the PV of lease obligations to the denominator? That makes
perfect sense. I'll have to read Security Analysis again to see how I came out
of it thinking the way I did. It still decreases ROIC, but not to the degree I
thought.

I was just trying to get what my "cash return" on the ROIC would be. To me it
seemed that if I was adding rent back in then that would not really be my cash
return. I've still got to think on this.

The point of a return on investment analysis is to separate the BUSINESS from
THE WAY THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES THE BUSINESS. Accounts payable is clearly part
of the BUSINESS. 

Right. Trade accounts payable are necessary to the business. That's why I
subtract it out from capital invested in the business.

I would say that operating leases on their stores are too. 

If they had been capital leases, they would be considered part of THE WAY THE
COMPANY CAPITALIZES ITS BUSINESS. Operating leases are problematic. Graham
certainly felt they were. What makes it so cut-and-dried for you?

I did make a mistake in my portrayal. In SA, I believe it asks to separate the
principal from the interest. The principal being the PV of the operating lease
agreement and the interest being the (total payments less the PV). Then using
the ratio of PV/total payments, one can figure how much of the rent payment is
going towards interest, and how much is going towards paying down the
principal. Then you can add the interest portion of the rent expense back to
the tax-adjusted net income and interest (in addition to amortization of
goodwill) to bolster the numerator.

 am I understanding that you are making EVA calculations about a company to

I don't know squat about EVA other than what I've portrayed of my knowledge
here - maximize ROIC and minimize cost of that capital.

So for now, I'm just content trying to figure out the mathematical definition,
meaning and utility of ROIC. And I'm only on the first step: how to calculate
it. I haven't even tackled how relevant cost of equity really is, and how
precise we can pretend to make it.

BTW, I could just look it up in a book or even a web site. The problem is, I
don't believe anything unless I understand it inside out. And even once I

already carved out explosive ag potential? Why not?

A lot of times with mergers synergy is just a catch phrase. But I really see it

It seems to me that AAPL is incredibly undervalued 

I don't know you at all, and while I agree with the endpoint of your analysis,
I don't agree with the means with which you got there. I like AAPL because it
IMO is now a bona fide value stock on an enterprise value/ratio basis, and is
generating tons of cash. I see loads of opportunity, an extremely strong
balance sheet, and little downside. And I see a huge contrarian play because a
generation of security analysts have been trained to think that whatever is
wrong with this world, AAPL is a part of it.

What the price will do in the next 12 months, I don't know. Whether day traders
will ever mature, I don't know. Whether value will even become more important
over the next year, I don't know. I just see an absolute value in AAPL at
recent prices.

I do feel the greatest margin of safety was back at 34 when no one ever thought
it would move, but that there remains a margin of safety for longer-term
holders.

For other tech value, I'm now a proud shareholder in Oracle at 24 3/8. 30X
earnings, so you gotta understand the business. After consulting with some
techie friends and family and doing some DD, I finally do. It goes in the

Twister,

Give me a break. If you really knew what a Buffett-like stock was,
I'd expect to see your real name and a record to prove it. Buffett-like
investing as defined by people like you has been reduced to a set model by
people such as yourself. To me, a lot of the thought and intelligence has been
taken out of it.

I wrote about this on my web site under "Buffett Revisited." To me, his spirit
of investing with intelligence has been lost in a sea of those simply trying to
be pure imitators.

When he bought GEICO, AMEX, the Buffalo News, any number of his investments he
was being as much contrarian as anything. He saw value in a a market dominance
or a brand that others didn't. And the 10-year record of high ROE with earnings
not skipping a beat wasn't necessarily there to prove it when he bought. But
there was nonetheless a margin of safety.

IMO, the biggest impediment to investing in the spirit of Buffett is the idea
that somehow we can be a 100% imitator of him and see the same success. That
anyone could be a perfect imitator of his approach strikes me as ridiculous.
Try compounding the 10% difference between even your best imitator and Buffett
over 30 years.

I don't have it down yet. But in terms of investing in the spirit of Buffett
(rather than in his mirror image), neither does anyone else here that I can
see. I'm young. I'm reading a lot and continuously reviewing and updating my
approach as new revelations occur. Remember I said "Buffett-like stock for me,"
not you. If it was that easy for you to see, I'd be disappointed. I'm certainly
glad I can't find anyone to agree with me on this. If anything, it indicates
I'm headed in the right direction.

have to carry it out to the nth decimal point. Maybe I too should just set my
hurdle rate for would-be Buffett-like investments, and leave it at that, and
continue to also use my other measures. Still working on this concept.

My principle on Oracle is that they are well-positioned to continue earning
high ROE/ROIC. Over the last 10 years, they've steadily grown profits, book
value, and maintained a ROE on average of about 32%. Return on Capital sits up
around 30% on average. So at a recent PE of about 30 (in the lower half of its
five-year range), the company still looks to return between 25% and 35%
compounded annually. There's a big margin of safety there, but only IF you
think it can continue to earn these types of returns. I've become convinced
that despite some likely turmoil this year, it can. It has hit big turmoil
twice before and recovered well to the same range of returns.

Robert, Re: SVR

I don't see anything really new. To me, analysts and I knew that expenses were
getting high due to some new marketing. Today was just Mr. Market. If anything,
the action tells me there's a definite bottom around 6. The stock has already
discounted this news. I think more than anything the company isn't being
assigned any kind of premium as a takeover candidate because the CEO is also a
54% shareholder not likely to approve that. Takeover talk lifted the rest of
this industry a few months ago. But SVR is on its own. As such, I still like
it. I don't see the earnings revisions as changing the margin of safety at all.

Re: SVR, the net net calc isn't so easy. Very long post here.

Some things to keep in mind - good bad and ugly. SVR is very interesting (as I
say on the site) and has a lot of good characteristics, but DD is always
necessary. I myself have not yet bought. I always wait a few days after a pick
of the month is posted before buying, but I should clarify this time I still
remain unconvinced that I want to buy it. In any case, I don't have the cash,
and I'm not abouto sell anything else in the portfolio to buy it (yet).

The company books as revenue the entire sales price of a VOI (avg $8,146 per)
basically once it gets a 10% down payment. The remainder of the balance then
goes into AR, which consists mainly of notes receivable from each customer with
lengths from 7-10 years. As the company receives installment payments (which
include principal + interest), the company books interest income. The company
is getting just under 12% on its receivables in interest income. The company's
interest expense is about 57% of its interest income, so it makes money on the
spread.

However, the company needs cash to fund development and marketing of VOIs and
hence keep the sales coming. Last year the company borrowed 75 million at 10+%,
the first time it did so. That helped goose sales last year to that 89% rise.
Typically, the company also gets current cash out of its receivables by
borrowing against the receivables at a fairly low rate of LIBOR + a few
percent. Usually it borrows about 70% of receivables, but recently it increased
that to 85%, which coincided with a fall in the interest rate charged. This
also helped goose development, marketing, and sales last year and this past
quarter.

Re: allowances for uncollectable AR, the company has been steadily decreasing
the amount that it is allowing as uncollectable, and is currently at about 10%.
As far as I can tell, the company is decreasing this allowance based on
experience of lower delinquent/default rates.

The company is pushing the limit on how much more it can borrow to fund further
development. As long as it can continue increasing AR then it can borrow more
at 85% of the increase, but obviously this results in a necessary deceleration
in sales growth. 85% is better than 70%, but it's not >100%. The company may
also borrow a bit more senior debt. But that debt is more expensive, and would
squeeze the (interest earned - cost of interest) spread. Currently, the company
earns about $10 million/year run-rate on this spread.

Now there's the inventories. The company's inventories are the VOI's it has
either acquired, reacquired, or built but not yet sold. The inventories are on
the books at the lower of cost or market price. The company did have a large
amount of inventories acquired several years back at a low cost basis. It has
depleted those, and is now selling out of inventory that it built at a higher
cost. This is squeezing margins on VOI sales.

Moreover, the company may have miscalculated a bit and is being forced into
stepping up marketing efforts more than it planned in order to sell interests
in certain slower markets. This further pressures margins on those sales, and
is what spurred the CSFB analyst to downgrade the stock.

So what happens when the company sells through its inventory and has maxed out
its borrowing of 85% of ARs at some reasonable level? The company's sales will
basically crash. You will be left with net interest income which is expiring
over 10 years, and management fees, and a questionable real estate asset base.
With SVR, I must admit I do not know about the quality of its real tangible
assets.

But where will this max out? Would the company pay back its market cap of about
$90 mill before the business runs its course?

Well, that's where one has to keep in mind that there are some significant
liabilities here. That new senior debt facility of $75 million in addition to
capital lease obligations, other notes payable, and a significant deferred tax
liability all come to a grand total of over $180 million.

Ok, that's a lot to think about. But before thinking this is a net net or
applying some simple ratio, this is what has to be thought of.

The chairman owns the majority of the shares. Silverleaf has a good concept
(the drive-to econo class) with some good locations, and it does own portions
of adjacent real estate at many of its locations. The stock is down horribly,
as is the entire industry. This is a contrarian play, and a value play only if
one convinces oneself that despite all the above, the company is worth
significantly more than $90 mill and that the chairman will allow it to be
unlocked if the appropriate better-capitalized suitor comes calling. A bigger
company with better access to more and cheaper capital might find Silverleaf's
franchise very attractive.

So liquidation value, takeover value, going-concern value. This is what
Security Analysis was written for. They all have to be looked at. I see the
cheapest stock in a crushed industry with insider buying and what should be
motivated management. Even if after due diligence once comes out bullish,
probably not something to concentrate all one's assets in, IMO. Some on the
Yahoo thread seem to be doing just that.

I usually try to keep my Picks of the Month rather short and to the point to
perk up interest/stimulate analysis, nothing more. The point has not been for
me to put down my entire analysis and a recommendation. In the future, I will
put down more analysis. And I will update the current Pick to include some of
this post.

Twister,

I'd say the intent of the thread is to propose and analyze stocks in the Graham
tradition. Make it intelligent. The issue of growth at a reasonable price vs
value vs no difference has come up before, and a lot of the contributors here
who also feel that growth can have a reasonable price have found the
Buffettology thread a better place for those kinds of stocks/discussions. This
thread is probably better suited for other kinds of more tangible value
analysis, given the personalities that seem to have assembled here and return
here.

To be fair, I think I brought up CLZR here a couple years ago. Bob had some
good counterpoints and that was that.

I'd also say that Jim, Jeffrey and maybe Paul have probably shown some lenience
to me here vs some newcomers. I've been castigated by each, though. But I post
a lot, and type a lot, and sometimes inappropriate stocks (stocks probably more
appropriate for the Buffettology thread or even a Burry v. Twister thread) get
mentioned.

It's not really worth fighting about.

Re: touting stocks, as you insinuate I do, you're welcome to your opinion. I'd
say there's a tone to touting that I see in some posts that get accused of
touting, and you're about the only one who's accused me. I don't see such a
tone in my posts. If you do, sorry, I'm not.

BTW, investment limited partnerships are prohibited from acquiring clients

Grommitt, re: SVR, no doubt, there are some favorable goings on. I'd say my
Pick of the Month article was too bullish, and my post here was purposely more
bearish to kind of counteract that. The demographics are favorable, no doubt.

Remember that the bulk of their revenues are sales. If this is going to
continue growing, they need capital. They get it by borrowing against the
unpaid principal (AR) at a fraction of that unpaid principal. This inhibits
growth in the growth rate, and basically guarantees slowing growth. Last year
they threw in a lot of addiitonal debt to give sales a kick, but at a higher
interest rate. They cover their interest expense with interest earned, but
obviously that won't continue if they pile on debt like that every year. This
is NOT really a growth story, no matter the demographics, because the model
can't support it as is.. But it is nevertheless a wonderful valuation puzzle,
and possibly a value stock.

Re: liquidation, evidently at least one analyst thinks that that value is over
13/share. But will it be liquidated? Depends entirely on Mr. Mead, no? If not,
then liquidation should be ignored and it has to be valued as an ongoing
concern. Interesting case. Further discussion could be on your Timeshare

Dan,

I don't know of any. My thinking is it would be hard to put together a really
thoughtful GARP thread since the analysis is by definition so superficial.
Superficial analysis, superficial posts. Buffett is now a GARP investor, but
with a very thorough and reliable approach. If a stock really is a bargain at
30 times earnings, it would have to fit Buffett criteria. That it grew 50% the
last two years and trades at 40 times earnings means nothing to me. That Oracle
has earned 32% on equity over 10 years, with steady upticks in earnings and
stock price, and has a business that I understand, makes it "buffett-like" for
me. So if the story is growth at a value price, then Buffettology's the best
bet for decent analysis IMO. If there is no predictable growth, or it is
debatable, you'll hear about it.

FWIW, I did liquidate a REIT position and my CPU position to take a fairly
large position in Case today as an arbitrage play. My reasoning is that the
shareholder vote is a lock, which takes out one of the big uncertainties in
arbitrage situations. It is doubtful that there will be an antitrust case made,
since even combined there are other heavy equipment players just as large (DE,
CAT). Fiat looks like it has the capital to get the deal done. I just think
that Case has much less risk in it than the current 7 point spread indicates. I
was waiting for sub-48, and got my shares at 47 15/16. Especially with interest
rates moving like they are and the market at scary highs with no leadership,
I'll take it.

Just throwing out some recent stocks catching my eye:

CKE (CKR) is sitting at about 13 and pennies. Carl's Jr. is the most profitable
burger joint around, but Hardy's is dragging them down. Converting to the Star
Hardy's format is helping, but the conversion will take time. I see some
short-sighted shareholders, and a cheap stock at just about 3X cash flow,
albeit with a good helping of debt. I know they'll pull out of this. Haven't
bought yet (i'd like to see some insider buying)

Adams Golf (ADGO) is sitting at about 3 and has a chunk of cash. It rode a fad
of sorts, but I just bought a Tight Lies so obviously I feel there is value
there. A lot of cash and NO debt. There's a good golf mind there in the CEO.
The new drivers line will probably have a good run. In any case I see minimum
downside short of a takeunder by management.

Maxtor (MXTR) I did buy recently at 5 and pennies. This company is also cash
rich, with minimal debt. Has remained profitable, and management says it
expects to remain profitable. But it's been taken out and shot with the other
DD makers. I know DD are not a good business, but Maxtor's efficiency
statistics and inventory/accounts receivable turns are great. Closely tied to
Dell.

I did recently nibble on Disney due to what I see as huge potential to milk
free cash out of that company once it gets good management.
Paul's Fruit of the Loom (FTL) and Schlotzky's (BUNZ) also tempt me but I'd
take CKE over BUNZ as a restaurant play. Washington Mutual (WM) is a major bank
with a lot of intangible book value that to me seems undervalued if we apply
Graham to the balance sheet. They're infiltrating my neighborhood and taking
business from competitors. Earning 20% on inflated equity. No position yet
myself.

Fresh Del Monte (FDP) looks like it is starting to fly, as is National RV
(NVH). I still maintain Tidewater and Deswell are true blue core value holdings
(I do own both). Homestake Mining (HM) was recently mentioned here and caught
my eye. It and gold both recently made decade-old new lows. It'll be
interesting to see how low they go. Evidently HM is relatively conservatively
financed and a low-cost producer that will be around if gold ever recovers.

Anybody know anything about Autodesk (ADSK)? At historic lows on a ratio basis.
I missed Adobe when it looked like this.

David,

Please, please contribute. Boy, you have the holding on part down pat. It's not
like Hyde even took that long - just a couple years like Graham said. Congrats.
4.25 - 17.50 is something of which to be very very proud IMO. Especially
because the character of the stock changed. From net net to a company with
prospects. I could see it happening but still adhered to the net net and got
out below 8.

WHX caught my eye again when it hit 10. I held on until it fell to about 8 1/2
and sold out. Lo and behold it hit near 6, and it caught my eye again. Now at
about 7, but IMO there's value there. But there's risk too. Management has
driven the company to bankruptcy before and doesn't look like they're too
afraid to do it again.

JBM I'm surprised you held it this long and did the round trip. That one was
not a very good business, but was selling at a deep discount. I can't say what
I would've done though, since I chickened out way early. Thought I found
greener pastures.

On the CSE situation, I see a very, very low probability that the deal won't
happen. Fiat is NH's majority shareholder and is itching to spend the money.
Case would be plain stupid to reject it. And Deere and Caterpillar are just as
big as the combined entity, so the regulatory stuff should work out. I'll admit
though that the downside would probably be substantial if it is called off. If
the deal is called off, though, it is very likely that New Holland will jump,
so maybe it makes sense to buy and hold New Holland next time it falls to 14 as
a paired play with Case.

Re: stock picking vs. stock selling.

It has been said that a stock well-bought is half-sold. IOW, if you've done
your DD on the front end, it is obvious when to sell. There's value in that,
but the cliche is incomplete, IMO. It is one thing to wait for a fat pitch and
quite another to assess, upon attaining 2nd base, whether stretching for a
triple represents a favorable risk/reward. This situation can be further
complicated by the fact that the very next batter also possesses your exact
same ability (or inability) to wait for a fat pitch. Why shouldn't one just
wait for the absolute fattest pitch, making every swing a home run and
eliminating the sell decision? Well, even Buffett hasn't done that. A nice

OK, here's where I go and offend a lot of people. Religion? Style? What's the

point, I did give up on my tech ban. Reason being that they are businesses like
any other, and I couldn't justify not valuing them. It's fashionable for value
investors to steer clear, certainly because of Buffett's influence. But it is
possible to invest intelligently there, IMO. I can't just stick my head in the

wealthy. Ratios bite. That's gotta be lesson number 1 in tech value investing.
I learned it with one stock - Creative Labs. Applying a little bit of Buffett

On Novacare, it doesn't seem like it is too hard to get a grip on it. But basic
Yahoo ratios won't do it. The book value is basically all goodwill and crappy
AR. In fact I would argue a conservative estimate of book value is nigh near
negative, if not blatantly negative. It seems it all comes down to what that
last remaining business would earn, and how much somebody else would pay for
it. One could even just make a bet that Medicare funding of PT will indeed be

Jim,

I did go ahead and buy a smallish position in Autodesk today. Used tech money
to do it, as I got rid of 40% of my Apple position just above 48 (the rest I'm
holding onto).

Reading through the SEC filings, Autodesk seems to be a lot more complicated
than one would think. But this is mainly a contrarian play. The stock is now at
the bottom of a years-long trading range, half it's 52 week high, and there is
evidence of significant insider buying the last time it was this low. In fact
insiders seem to reliably buy at this level and sell at double this level over
the last few years. Debt next to nil, a hoard of cash that makes the stock
cheaper than it appears, and a history of tremendous intraquarter order
volatility that repeatedly seems to provide buying opportunities in the stock.
This is another instance of the majority of its shareholders being the wrong
kind. If we're looking for a double in 10 years as the absolute minimum, this
thing is a lock. Right now, it has a quadruple bogey : sia flu, strong dollar,
product transition, Y2K spending slowdown. Expected weakness the remainder of
the year. But if history serves as any guide, Autodesk will survive and grow
yet again. On a ratio basis, FWIW, the stock is at historic lows, especially if
you count enterprise value as the main numerator rather than market cap. It
might hit 22 yet again, but at 24 7/16 I see 10% downside and 100% upside as a
potential long-term play.

Mattel was my other candidate for the Apple money, and it was nearly a toss-up.

Re: ADSK, MAT

Re: cash hoard of Autodesk vs. WALL, there's simply no comparison. I know WALL
and its competitors generally have large cash hoards, mainly because their
business/industry segment is disappearing and they've sold off different parts
and there really is no place left to invest in their area. Some of these cos
like WALL and its competitors are better off just changing industries and using
their cash hoard to fund a different business plan, IMO. That's not the case
with Autodesk.

Re: briefing.com's analysis of Autodesk, seems that every time they're in a
product transition, the same exact criticism comes out - no need to upgrade.
Then people go and upgrade anyway as the product gets distributed. And
surprisingly, new biz buys the product too, especially as the product cycle
matures. For really successful software firms with industry-dominating products
(ORCL, MSFT included), such criticism only brings about buying opportunities.
So IMO briefing.com's criticism (echoed/copied from many other sources) is
rather old and known. They're sales are very lumpy, and their quarters are
erratic, no doubt. But while someone might skip one upgrade, they won't skip
many. Because ADSK's customers are very much in very competitive businesses
themselves and can't be caught short-handed against the competition.

Re: Mattel, be aware that the WSJ has a front-page story on them today.
Basically incriminates the CEO as something of an airhead Barbie herself, and
notes how much faith has been lost both among institutions and previous Barbie
faithful. Having gotten my info mainly from the CEO herself, I'm rather
disappointed that she can be so illogical and foolhardy. Makes me doubt her
guidance to shareholders even more. Still like MAT at its lows.

I'd bet you that ADSK will outperform Mattel over the next few years, but I've
already got money riding on it ;) One thing that is helping me a bit is the
tremendous support that ADSK has in the low 20's. I mean, going back years, the
stock has always jumped from this level. I would sit up, pay attention, and
possibly exit the postition if it broke through to new years-old lows.

Jim,

Funny, I looked at the same thing and didn't come to the same conclusion. In
any case, I'm talking contrarian value here. I'm not saying it's Buffett, and
I'm not saying it's Graham. The stock is down 50% with insider buying at this
level, which happens to be big support going back years. No debt, a quarter of
the share price is cash, and the company has always shaken out of this
recurrent funk that it seems to hit with regularity - precisely because it
leads the industry. Your interpretation might explain why the stock has had
trouble adding big value over time, though. I'll certainly give you that, and
revisit it, but it probably won't change my mind as much as the WSJ story about
what a ditz the CEO of MAT is.

Re: Barad

The story seemed negatively slanted to be sure. Whether for good reason or not,
I'm not sure. The thing that most struck me was the portrayal that she made an
absurd promise to Wall Street, short-sightedly wrecked the product line to keep
the promise, and then massively broke it anyway. Talk about no credibility. The
article also seems to imply that she has contempt for market researchers,
preferring instead to go with her gut. For a company like Mattel, all I can see
coming of that is ruin. It calls into question the reliability of cash flows, a
big issue given the large debt and acquisition. In this perspective, mattel.com

include the debt, that it is being forced (by tech evolution and other
demographic changes) into new strategies - management didn't lead them there,
and questions of management. This helps throw doubt on cash flows, which helps
the margin of safety on a debt-laden enterprise shrink, IMO. For a long-term

Things not to like about SCS:

1. Not an unknown story. Heck, it got a full-bore bullish headline and story in
Barron's. THe flip side is it rallied, and now the Barron's effect is worn off.
It might just be getting overlooked again.
2. Stock likely to flounder as perception is it is cyclical.
3. It is indeed cyclical.
4. There's a doubt in my mind whether the founder isn't trying
a bit too hard to pump the stock.

That said, I like SCS a lot. It's basically got 9 of the 10 characteristics I'd
look for. I'd buy it now, but it seems to be on a steep downhill slope right
now, and I'm hoping to get it cheaper. I put it in the same league as Champion
and Borders. Solid leaders in their industries, deserving of higher valuations
but they may never get there. Still downside is limited in this trio, IMO. And

Re: Autodesk, your cash flow options accounting is a bit coarse for this case.

By my calculation of cash flow, they had about 190M in operating cash flow less
38M in cap ex, or about 142M in free cash flow in 1998. They spent $28M buying
back stock last year. By your method that's still $110 mill give or take a few.
But it's wrong.

To be more precise, the latest SEC filing. They spent 22M, 65M and 76M issuing
stock and options for employees in 96, 97, and 98 according to their detailed
cash flows. This would cut 1998 free cash flow in half at least. In the end, I
still see a free cash of about $1.15/share coming out of the company last year.
1197 by this method was $1.12 per share, and 1996 by this method was $0.80 per
share. Not zero by my calculation.

Jeffrey, re: SCS

I just love your rhetorical Q's! A catalyst for a higher price may be if the
CEO can indeed double revenues by 2003 and in doing so bring earnings along
with them, no? ;0 I don't know if I believe it.

I didn't realize, or maybe I'd forgotten - I'd have to check my notes- that
insiders owned 91% of the stock. But I agree with you that such a high
percentage would increase the risk of going private in the event of a share
downturn, and hence a permanent loss of capital. This should depress the
multiple.

I too don't know that it will ever command a higher PE. Probably will have to
rely on earnings expansion rather than multiple expansion. Much like Champion

Re: MAT, Three Stooges

Three Stooges beer? I just gotta try it ;0

I'm reposting my post on MAT from the Buffettology thread, as it has
some relevance to some of the discussion here.

Barbie's numbers revisited

I did go through the available information on the pro forma Mattel-TLC
combo. Here's what I found. Not that I believe it twister-proof, and
there is a lot of assumption and missing pieces here for the
determined to pick at. Late last pm, I just didn't have the time (not
that I do now either).

We all know that TLC has had an ambitious M&A program. This has
resulted in a lot of intangible assets to be written off. Moreover,
both Mattel and TLC have undertaken large restructuring charges in the
last few years. The following are rough, as detailed pro forma cash
flows have not yet been provided.

1998 1997 1996
NI 150M -189M 14.6M
Amort 135M 487M 467M

Cash flow 285M 248M 482M
Per share 0.65 0.81 1.31

Charges 130M 344M 12M

Operating
Cash Flow
before charges 414M 641M 493M
Per Share 0.95 1.73 1.34

Return on Equity isn't a good measure here because the debt/equity
ratio is high. And in this case, how much we want to play with
intangibles is questionable, since we all agree that brands are a big
part of this business, and the intangibles likely do represent some
fraction or multiple of real value. Invested Capital was 3.54 billion
at the end of 1998. So ROIC at the end of 98 was about 8% after
charges, 12% before charges. Assuming a similar capital structure in
prior years (a big and probably wrong assumption), the return would've
been 7% and 18% in 1997, and 14% and 14% in 1996.

This is return using operating cash flows, not free cash flows. It
appears that Mattel typically spends about 200M/year in cap ex, and
TLC spends about 25M/year, so that could be deducted from the above.
As well, TLC typically has had tremendous working capital requirements
that have actually knocked back operating cash flow significantly, to
the tune of 90-100M/year at TLC. At Mattel, this has been a negative,
but to a much lesser extent of say 25M/year. As well, Mattel spends
relatively little on stock option and incentive plans, but TLC has
been a big offender in that realm, and discloses that such plans would
have lowered net income by an additional 53M in 1998, 39M in 1997,
and 31M in 1996.

All told, just these "smaller" issues add up to an additional approx
400M/year that comes out of operating cash flow. So cash return on the
capital turns negative for 1998, falls by 2/3 in 1997, and remains
barely positive in 1996.

All said, though, I do really believe Barbie is fine. I kinda got on
the wrong side of Mattel when I was chided for choosing Autodesk over
Mattel. Fact is, I do think there is turnaround possible here. Lord
knows I've invested in companies with good concepts and numbers
worse than these. But, as with Disney, the story is a lot, lot more
than "Mickey is fine."

I think we can also file this as another example of how NI/ROE, as
imperfect as they are, do often reflect the underlying story. Not that
we shouldn't look behind them.

Clayton is not a Buffet stock

First off, long-term ROE 17%? The last time it cleared 17% was back in
1990, and it was heavily leveraged. Its return on assets has been steadily in
the 10% range, and its return on capital over the last 5 years (which have been
"boom" years, if you call it that) is about 14%. The net income tells most of
the story. There's a minimal amortization/depreciation charge, making net
income a good to generous estimate of cash flow rather than a drastic
underestimation.

Moreover, its numbers simply reflect the industry. Its 5 year average ROC is
about the industry average, and its ROA suffers the same average fate. ROE is
below average if you adjust for debt. The rest of its numbers range but are
overall unremarkable except for very good margins.

I can see why CMH doesn't trade at 25 times earnings, and never will on any
consistent basis. That's not to say it's not undervalued. It will be around in
10 years. Is there a super-duper competitive advantage? Not really. It is
reflected in the efficiency numbers, but you get a hint of one in the profit
margins. But it trades at a PE not seen consistently since the last real estate
slump 89-91, and if a slump is not seen, the stock will simply have to move
forward. I see a great margin of safety in an undervalued stock, good for
12-15% annually long-term, maybe 20% from rock-bottom lows with good
management.

Personally, I see a lot better numbers, potential in Champion, but I'm very
biased there.

I don't see 17% either, but you switched to "return on capital" 

That's because there's other owners who have a claim on the company - its
bondholders. It's folly to use simple ROE to compare companies with different
capital structures (i.e. different debt/equity ratios).

IMO, if you are going to be determined to use ROE of 16% despite the debt, no
one's going to stop you. Certainly not the people that want to sell you their
shares.

some of these guys are buying back just a tiny fraction of what they sold.

And as for Clayton's debt level, your post implied that ROE is
coming from leverage.

No, I simply meant that a 1/4 debt/equity ratio does make simple ROE
an inaccurate measure of profitability. 1% may be small, but 3-4%
isn't. Not if you're trying to compound the thing and make it like a
Buffett stock.

For Clayton (to get the numbers out in the open),

ROE D/E Avg PE Net Margin
1998 15.6 0.28 15.9 12.2
1997 15.8 0.03 15.3 12.3
1996 16.4 0.05 16.4 12.2
1995 16.0 0.09 13.4 11.5
1994 15.0 0.15 19.1 11.0
1993 15.4 0.39 18.5 11.3
1992 13.4 0.66 16.7 10.6
1991 14.2 1.13 12.9 8.9
1990 18.4 1.64 9.2 7.6
1989 18.6 1.85 9.9 6.7

The industry average is ROE (5 year) 16.6. Clayton's ROC (5 year) is
14. The industry average is 14.1. Champion returns ROE (5 year) 25.6
and ROC (5 year) 22.0. Its margins don't measure up to Clayton's
superb numbers due to Clayton's higher-end focus, and they never will
since Champion is making the big retail push. For history buffs,
Champion has been around 30 years longer than Clayton and is indeed
the biggest manufacturer. The great results arrived with Mr. Young.
Obviously, to me, Champion is the screaming buy, as it appears cheaper
on PE and cash flow bases too. But we certainly do not have a 3
person consensus, and there is such a consensus on Clayton. So the
only way to solve this is to watch.

It looks as though Mr. Clayton will hand off the reins to his son.
Jim, how good is the son?

Yep I'm back in les etats-unis. Oracle has done very well indeed as has
Autodesk to a lesser extent, but I've had others, such as Apple, Borders,
Deswell, National RV, and Champion take a dump. So the net is that I'm much
better than I would've been without Oracle, but only a little better off than
when I left.

National RV in particular I can't figure out. That one, like Anchor Gaming,
seems very very volatile. It's dropping hard, but it seems to have such a good
story. I'm looking for someone to punch holes in that one for me. Tell me where
I'm wrong! Champion is plummeting on high volume too. National RV and Champion
have similar stories (pros/cons) to me, and I hold both. If they turn out very
badly, I'll have learned a very valuable lesson, and that will be stay away
from booming cyclicals no matter management. It's one of those cases where it
seems I'll have to burn a hole in my own pocketbook to really take the lesson
home.

John,

because of the less-attractive balance sheet and cash flow
for CHB

You see that your negative cash flow is the result of working capital changes
in the midst of explosive growth, no? Personally, with companies growing so
quickly and experiencing big jumps in sales, I don't punish cash flow with
working capital changes, since that negative disappears when the growth becomes
less aggressive. CHB is just funding its growth with its cash flow and a little
bit of debt added on to a balance sheet that had been pristine and
underleveraged. William Young is supposed to be a very good manager who is not
overaggressive financially, so I admit I am putting some faith in this.

Too, with the "negative net tangible assets," this is an improper use of this
measure IMO. If a company has net negative tangible assets after a series of
goodwill-producing acquisitions (as CHB has done to get into retail and certain
production niches), but manageable debt, then I fail to see where this is a
negative. Maybe it would come into play if the business were being liquidated,
but not for an ongoing concern. If anything, as long as earnings are strong and
the acquisitions accretive, it shows there is some value in the
branding/location/distribution that is being accounted for as goodwill.

FWIW, I did take a position in Washington Mutual, an S&L which has grown rather
well over the past decade, but spent the last few years in acquisitions and
bloating the balance sheet. It recently announced it was going to temper some
of its activities in order to squeeze more efficiencies out of its sizable

I suspect CHB's relative multiple is moving to be more in line with its
relative debt level. I've seen this before recently with the oils, just as they
were putting in a bottom - the ratios among the stocks line up according to
safety in the event of a doomsday scenario. IMO, most of the housing stocks,
manu housing, RV, construction products, and that ilk have been doing this this
last 3 months.

To be honest, I hesitated a bit in buying more Champion. I already own National
RV and several other stocks that are likely to be affected by the same
macrotrends as CHB. But basically, my portfolio has grown significantly this
year, and the average position size has grown proportionately. My older
Champion position was the smallest in my portfolio, which didn't fully
represent its true position in terms of relative appreciation potential, so I
upgraded it. I feel I have a good level in the 18's where the downside is
severely limited. True, the stock movement has been bearish, but it has only
fallen back to old support. It has bounced rather sharply off this level
several times. If CHB moves to new lows, I will be exiting the stock. Not a
value investor-like thing to do, but to close below 17 would be a very
difficult thing for this stock to do. If it happens, I'm probably not aware of
something, I'll have a small loss and that'll be that. Gone are the days when I
impale myself averaging down in an underperforming, technically damaged

Jeffrey, I can't doubt that. I don't think you have to be well-informed or an
industry insider to know that there is an inventory glut. Champion and Clayton
are the only two majors that haven't broken through to new lows. Clayton is
acting the strongest. But after the ag equips and Deswell falling to 6 despite
$5 in cash and cycle-trough earnings of at least 80-100 cents, I don't doubt
anything. CHB at 10 wouldn't shock me.

Screening has its limitations, but I've had some success with the screens I
post over on my web site every few months. I just posted a new one last night.
Tries to use Buffett-like numbers to find the small caps he says he can do 50%
annually with. Turns out 3 of the stocks in the screen are already in my
portfolio, another one (CXP) I'm considering, and another one Nautica (NAUT)
was profiled in Barron's this am as being a good buy. Several of them look
interesting.

The list with all the criteria and results is at the site under
Screening Lab. http://www.valuestocks.net No manufacturers of homes made it in.
The average gain of a stock in the March screen - based on Dreman's latest

this weeds out much of what you're finding - cyclical companies that have had a
great five year run but which got murdered in the last recession

Huh? That isn't what the screen found. JLG and CXP I'll give you. They're
definitely cyclical. NVH and MAIR maybe, but there's definitely a big growth
component as well. Tidewater is going through its own recession and is still
profitable. Fair Isaac is as consistent as they come and one might argue that a
recession with increased credit risks could help them. The others are hardly
big cyclicals. I find software and consultying cos punished because of the Y2K
lull, clothing, a new industry in PPD, a lottery company, and health supplement
concerns. Maybe you saw a few cos and made a quick judgement. But this screen
did not produce a list loaded with cyclicals. If it did, I wouldn't feel the
need to post it or publish it.

BTW, you're an institution. Read my disclaimer. I give that you have greater
screening capacity than me. I don't have easy or free access to quality 10 year
or 20 year databases. I might use them if I did.

Hon and Herman Miller aren't cyclical? Somebody'd have to convince me. Payless

Re: value investing plaything

As much contrarian as value investing, I bought back into WHX in a small way
today. They are so leveraged they did not rally with the other steels earlier
this year. But they didn't fall at all with the recent bad news. Gabelli
apparently is still buying them, and LaBow is a particularly tenacious value
investor. The complexity of the valuation keeps a lot of people away, but I
still feel they can be valued as I've posted on the WHX boards here and on
Yahoo.

BTW, somebody at the Fed visited my site twice today. Never have seen that
before. But there it is, right after I wrote a pretty scathing paragraph or two
about Alan becoming a mo-mo guy on the portfolio page. Probably a low-level,

Well, bye-bye to Champion for me. It looks like a new closing low today, and I
said I would sell at the new low. So I stuck to it. Hope it gets ridiculously
cheap. If not, well, I get the tax loss as a consolation - and I could use it.
Thinking of buying Clayton to stay in the sector, but am willing to be patient.

Meanwhile, used the proceeds to buy Keane (KEA). It's one of those Y2K stocks
that ran up furiously last year. It and Analysts International (ANLY) both made
my screen last week. Managers of both companies give clear, specific reasons
for their difficulty - loss of Y2K revenue AND delay of non-Y2K revenue.
Keane's managers say that they expect to resume 25% top-line growth (and 25+%
bottom-line growth) after the Y2K bump is passed. There's been some insider
buying. ANLY has a lot more insider buying, and its managers too say that they
will resume historical growth once Y2K is passed.

Interesting to me is that both of these companies have been creating
shareholder value steadily for years, but only in the last couple did they
become stars. Keane had more Y2K work than ANLY, and is five times larger. My
thinking is Keane got a lot of contacts and leads out of its Y2K work, which
can only help going forward. The ANLY situation is similar, but on a smaller
scale. Keane has hit some economies of scale, with 30+% ROE and high ROA with
good margins. I think you could bet on either horse. The stocks basically move
together. ANLY pays a decent dividend. I went with the larger concern, whose
managers own 20% of the stock already, mainly because I don't need the
dividend. Valuations on both are remarkably similar.

BTW, Fair Isaac looks higher for some reason. Anyone find a reason?

Jim, I guess I still watch the charts a bit. After all, I cut my teeth trading
coffee futures. About 8 trading days ago it broke a significant downtrend on
decent volume when it moved to the high 40s. At the point, I wished I had
bought more in the low 40s. Today it just popped its 200 day, after trending
along it for a few days after trendline breakout. This all occurred in a
setting in which the years-long stock chart tested a years-long uptrend and the
support held. Maybe TA is only useful because others use it. I don't know. But
it's interesting to watch, and I believe in it to the degree it reflects crowd
psychology. Despite SLOT's volatility, I'd be surprised if it goes back to
sub-50 now.

And yes, I'm waiting for the 80's at least before I sell, no matter what the

recently when I read that only 14% of investors were bullish on gold, and that
the prices had hit levels that hadn't been seen since 1979. So of course I
think "historic opportunity." Homestake Mining was brought up here by Paul I
think. They produce gold at a cost just under 200/ounce. Even at current levels
they are producing about breakeven results. A decent balance sheet - strong if
you compare to others. Evidently everybody's short gold. Well, here's hoping

I am interested in an HMO, Pacificare. Bought FHP, which caused some digestion
probs and causes net income to underestimate substantial free cash flow. Gov't
and Commercial ratios are stable to improving, with the commercial ratio at the
same rate as 1995. Paying down debt. About 7X 1998's free cash flow. Net income
also artificially depressed by ultrahigh temporary tax rates. Looks to earn
6+/share this year, and 7+/share next year. CEO sold, but only a tiny fraction
of his shares, and at prices $30 north of here. Near lows, with a propensity to
move quickly. Risks are that it is huge in Medicare.

Well, I went and bought it, got 63 1/8. I don't really care one way or another
about a few points. Even 3 is just over 5%. I did a comparison of 8 different
HMOs and came up with Pacificare as the best one as a value investment. Trigon
and Wellpoint also scored well, but Pacificare was the best value (with one of
the worst charts). Pacificare is more Medicare-dependent than most. I
especially like that it is solidly profitable and firmly in control of its
ratios despite a huge commercial exposure to California. I first bought and
sold Pacificare in 1992. I traded it from about 48 to 72 a year or two ago.
Looks like another good entry to me. And they have emerged as a leader. BTW, I
like the HMOs as an investment better than the hospitals, practice management
groups, and even practices. The insurers are the ones most firmly in control of
their numbers in a difficult environment. I think their information advantage
over just about everyone will stead them well. And reading through Pacificare's
10K tells me they are one of the best at keeping dibs on their stats.
Management has already said both the gov't and commercial ratios will be stable
over the next year. The commercial ratio is getting below 1995's level. A lot
of insurers just keep seeing that number rise.

BTW, I sold the last of my Oracle at 38 15/16 to buy the Pacificare at
63 1/8. Reason being too many people love Oracle now, and even a Morgan Stanley
dinner in Oracle's honor couldn't pump the stock any higher. 60% in 2 mos was a
steep climb. As for fellow climber Apple, a case can still be made that it's a
value stock IMO. A dip would be a buying opportunity. I'm still holding 60% of
that position.

I mentioned it over on the Buffettology thread, but I bought Reuters yesterday.
My reasoning is over there, and some might consider it a value stock. It did
jump today though.

Is anyone else still in Tidewater? That one looks ready to rumble. It's already
been rocking the boat a bit, now over 32. I really should have just put my
whole portfolio in that one at 17. Timberland's another one, up 12+ today.

Wow. I was pissed when Case broke 46 and I bailed. Thought that at that point

I had a huge position, and decided to let go at 45 15/16. I was sure it would
end up closing up and I'd be regretting the sale. Can't believe my eyes where
it is now. But relieved at adhering to my stop (which I never thought it'd
reach). Ouch, ouch, ouch. This is the first and last arbitrage play to burn my
fingers.

Now I have a ton of cash. Bought Mesaba Holdings with 1/4 of it, which controls
tiny Mesaba airlines. Tiny, but without debt, highly profitable, with great
return and growth numbers despite tiny multiples across the board. It's an
airline, and while its ultimate growth may be limited, it's 5-year growth line
appears reasonably assured. And at current multiples I think that's all I need.

Jim,

Ok, so let me clarify: TODAY I don't regret bailing on Case just under 46. I
have a lot of cash to put to use. We'll see how it turns out the day Case
closes for cash. I guess rumor is that everyone's selling because the stock is
falling, and there's no news. That's why I sold. So then I might lose.

You don't DO small cap airlines? Why oh why not? Because the biggest airlines
are mature and cycle-driven. The smallest are not mature, and have wind at
their backs, so to speak. SO if you can find a pretty safe niche, you can
reasonably project growth in the face of cycles. Mesaba is beholden to
Northwest. Mesaba's very well-run, or has been. Great numbers. Great returns.
$4/share in cash. No debt. Very cash flow positive thanks to its sweetheart
arrangement with NW. The biggest risk here is the agreement with NW going to
pot.

Wondering if you could give "doing" small cap airlines a try and tell me why
Mesaba is a bad investment?

BTW, I bought back into Case at nearly what I sold it for (46 1/16 vs 45 15/16.
That there are now two press releases put out by NH/Fiat indicating a close by
October is very significant to me. I tried to believe the first one as the
stock fell. But now that they've come out and reiterated, and did so because
the stock price was getting out of hand, I'm more comfortable. There's an
article in the current Barron's on how many risk arbitrageurs are taking a
break, and how current spreads are at historically high levels due to the lack
of interest in arbitrage. No mention of Case.

Speaking of medical stocks, starting to delve into Hanger Orthopedics (HGR). I
think their massive acquisition is causing buyers to shy away unjustifiably.
Prosthetics and orthotics can be a lucrative business with historically good
reimbursements. And they are a consolidator in a fragmented industry. They have
always been mom-and-pop (or father-and-son) shops, but now Hangar is
consolidating, with large scale centralized manufacturing that the industry
hasn't seen before. Thanks to high speed autos, construction, farming,
diabetes, and longer lifespans, the industry can grow at least 5%. And I don't
think it can be obsoleted with ease. Still evaluating it myself.

Re: Steris

I won't buy it. Why? As I was leaving the OR today I took some time to look
around. Yes, I washed my hands with Steris soap. Yes, the equipment is here.

But there's something else. A little flier on a board that I rarely stop to
read. Listing all the trials that they are doing with different products.
Trying to switch suture brands. Glove brands. Soap brands. Even different
equipment brands. And at the end of each entry was something to the effect of
"We will save $xx,xxx per year if we switch." They are willing to switch this
or that to save literally $30,000/year. In an enterprise that does $300M/year.
I learned different types of suture by their brand names. When I want a 4-0
Vicryl, it was like I didn't even know that was a brand name. It was just what
it was. Now it's going to be something else. I can't remember the name.

Brand names carry no power in this environment. And hence IMO ROE that even for
ten years or longer has been stable is now in danger if it belongs to a medical
supply or equipment company. Really, no one is going to cry when the Steris
soap in the bathroom is changed to something else. And the cost-cutting will
hit the bathroom.

Over time, it will play out this way. And instead of fancy dinners persuading
physicians and hospital admin to buy this or that, it will be the bottom line.
I think this is coming to a head now (not that the pressure will subside) in
the medical equipment/supplies arena, and disasters will occur in big names.

With Steris you are buying a name and a brand. And products. But if the
products can be duplicated by a no-name, this is going to become a hard road.
It appears undervalued by current numbers. But remember how much of the stock
value is carried in that post-10 year residual value? Well, that is part that
is very shaky.

Agreed. Is the 25 mill cash good enough to replace the present value of that
business? Looks like the execs are preparing to be bought out, with some
lucrative deals made for key management. This one has been discovered. There's
at least 5 analysts covering it, and TheStreet.com made it a focus for the day.

Congrats to the thread. Probably one of the only active threads on SI where one
can bet that 100% of its members are NOT suffering from the internet meltdown.

According to TheStreet.com, the market is finally being driven lower by margin
calls. As Cramer puts, it, it looks like the margined traders have "forgotten"
how to sell, and the inexperienced online brokers don't know how to react,
creating chaotic margin calls and brewing terror out of fear. This could get
really messy.

Clayton Homes, Champion making new lows. Stocks that have been falling continue

I don't know, Jim. Champion beat estimates last time too. It treaded against
its lows then broke to new ones. I bailed. That action was just too weak. Now
it's 25% lower and continuing to make new lows.

Same thing is going with Clayton. I'm sure the company is sopping up shares in
the 10 range, trying to not let the stock close in the single digits. But a new
low has already been made, through heretofore strong support. Has the future
been written? I'm sure a close below 10 will bring a new breed of sellers.

On the fundamental level, do you know if Clayton has similar agreements to buy
back unsold retail inventory? Can you clarify how it won't be affected like
Champion by bankrupted retailers?

Re: specialty retailers, I'm always looking at the branded ones, i.e. looking
for the "next" Gap. I think quite a few are getting cheap during this
correction. The trick is distinguishing fad from success.

Re: Borders, it continues to hit new lows. Shane might comment as well, but the
location they are getting for the Nashville location is primo and guarantees it
will be a great successs. It will be the only big box bookstore near downtown,
and it is located right smack dab in the middle of the retail structures
supporting Vanderbilt.

There has been a pretty severe correction in a lot of stocks, and I'm a bit

Today I raised a bit of cash, stepping aside of some of the American Power
fallout, at the same time buying a bit more Tricon Global.

Situations I'm watching include:
Mattel: getting ready to touch old lows; a low risk buy at those levels, with a
quick sell stop at any new low

Philip Morris: moving towards its lows again; same deal as Mattel

Waste Management: could this be a bottom? the cash flow is tremendous and the
debt is weighing too heavily on investors' minds IMO. I was just waiting for
some stability.

Bebe: Eegad. I know. Ridiculous fad. And I've criticized it in the past. But it
is a branded specialty retailer that posted 18+% SSS growth in July, leading
the industry. They have barely penetrated any markets. Managing huge returns on
equity and assets, and strong cash flows. This one has a long way to grow and
after reviewing the competition, I like this one best after its recent 50%
price cut.

Pulte: the cheapest of the home builders, with the best balance sheet and
lowest p/b. insiders are buying, though the interest rate boogey looms large.

WAMU: I still like Washington Mutual here.

Berkshire: Buying this during a market correction leverages the low price and
the known opportunity for Warren to reinvest the GenRe money.

Callaway Golf: OK, it's round-tripped to its lows. I'm going to be patient, but
hey kids it has a decent dividend and the premier brand.

Waiting for some tax-loss selling in some of these.

Re: Callaway (as I've been hit twice on this) the deal is it looks crappy. We
can see no recovery, and we're heading into the winter again. It's bleak. But
it's at its bottom. It's still profitable, and those profits will grow, and it
pays nearly a 3% dividend.

I've got Callaway irons, Orlimar driver, Adams fairway wood, Callaway BJ
putter. What the good golfers I know (lord knows I'm not one of them) really
think are nice are the Callaway product. After using my putter, several people
have told me they need to upgrade. And when the golf ball comes out it will be
another reliable revenue stream. Really, Taylor Made golf balls look nice, but
they just imitate every other ball on the market. If Callaway can use their
125M to come up with a patentable all-new golf ball that is still legal, they
could really shine. Looks like their AR is still very high right now.

I'm not buying yet. Just like I'm not buying brk yet. But as the dog days of
fall come upon us, tax-loss selling intensifies, and everything goes on sale,
these are some of the ones I'll be looking at it.

would buy MCK at 31, and I would certainly buy it after the drop today. 

Would you? Are you? I'm thinking right now it is maybe fairly valued. The
business economics are not that good. With Medicare getting involved in drugs,
well that's an argument against anything to do with drugs, including the
pharmas. MCK is the dominant player. No doubt. But the business is not really
that great a business. Is HBO a good business? Who knows, really. There's a lot
risk here still.
You're still talking about razor thin margins, and it is going to be in the
gov't's interest to erase them. MCK gets to be a value stock when it looks like
Ingram or Tech Data did at their bottoms. Too many people like it and the tax
selling hasn't even started. The market looks like it's going to leg down
something nasty. I ain't touching any of the fallen angels yet. In fact, now I
upped my cash again yesterday and am not anxious about putting it back in again
anywhere right now. Looking forward to the fall.

About that Miller. Well, he's taken big positions in some fallen angels lately,
only to see them crumple. Does anyone have insight into his strategy. Is it
just buy the biggest fallen angels? Jim, I know you can't comment, but this is
for the thread.

How have your shorts done?

Meanwhile, I almost pulled the trigger when Callaway hit its old lows (way too
cheap given its balance sheet and dividend and dominating position) and now it
bounces 15%. I'll wait again... Champion continues to spiral. Clayton still
bouncing along old lows. Score one more for James.

MOO,

Thanks for the Miller insight. Re: ANLY, thought it was really taking off there
for a second. But only a second. It hit all kinds of old resistance, and once
it started to back off a significant number of those holding from the last time
it was at 16 started to sell into it. Think I may have another Deswell or
Midway on my hands. My hope is that when these types of companies really do
take off, it will be huge enough to justify all this teasing.

Re: PEP, I don't have a target. Plan on just holding it for a good long while.

Shane,

I think if you look at Keebler's future, they're trading at less than 12 times
cash earnings a year or two out. We don't really know where they'll be, but a
good guess is that they'll keep growing and surprising. KBL itself is
undervalued IMO, and the analysts are behind on that story.

I'd say with FLO we're getting KBL at fair value, and Mrs. Smith's and the
bakery for free. Mrs. Smith's is about to run out of one-time charges. I look
at it as a growth story, producing earnings where there were losses. The
bakeries are slow steady growth.

It's an asset play now that likely will turn into a Buffett-like steady grower.
One of those where the ones buying now could look like geniuses.

Speaking of Miller and Nygren and me, I just noticed that Washington Mutual
(WM) saw 4 different insiders buy significant amounts of stock at the end of
July. IMO, given that the risk here is that there is some trouble behind the
scenes that is not now apparent (after all, it is an S&L), the insider buying,
which is backed by previous insider buying last year at these levels, is
comforting. Looking to add more.

BTW, I did buy Ross Stores (ROST) yesterday. Excellent returns on investment,
no long-term debt, with improving operational efficiency. All at its historic
average PE of 13. My feeling is that there will be multiple expansion as the
Ross concept becomes more and more efficient. Earnings should bump along at
10-15% growth.

I added more Pepsi and more Fair Isaac yesterday as well.

Both Fair Isaac and Washington Mutual were blindsided by the Bank One fiasco,
somewhat unfairly IMO.

JB,

Yeah, I saw your post to this effect on the Yahoo Board. My feeling is that we
knew there was a lull in the video game segment. There has been a focus on the
new platforms. And the report was delayed. I expected horrible numbers. And I
bought back in at 11 1/8 during the wait anyway. The numbers were surprising
but don't bother me.

I'm not buying this for earnings predictability. I'm buying it so I can be
there when the fruition of Redstone's activities comes to pass. Hopefully it
won't be the unloading of his shares ;) I have a strong suspicion - based on
the spin-off tax rules, the insider buying -we'll get bought out mid-2000. In
the interim, I won't buy at higher prices than Redstone has recently paid. His
slowdown could be just the result of higher share prices.

CHB I was very wrong, and right, on. The way I saw it, there were forces
occurring that I could not possibly be the first to know about. If I'm in
clinic all day, I just won't know when the sh** hits the fan. So I just let the
chart dictate. I knew it was more contrarian than anything. No tangible book
and debt isn't bad if things turn around even a little bit. But no way was I
going to hold once it made new lows. That was a strong psychological barrier
that got blown off its hinges.

An interesting thing about CHB is that as long as I was long, I was definitely
biased. From the sidelines, something cleared and I realized that no matter how
good the demand for these homes, barriers to entry are low and sooner or later
supply would create a soft market. I'm sure Clayton will survive, but it's a
vicious business.

I think Fair Isaac is another similar problem, as is Mattel. Fair Isaac has
been very steady over many years, and sports excellent numbers. But if all new
home buying, car buying, and credit card issuing declines significantly, will
lenders still be buying into FICO? Will it become even more important? Maybe
so, but maybe the software won't sell as well anyway. If it really is the end
of an era at Fair Isaac, I suspect that it will break through the bottom of its
years-long trading range on the strength of insider leaks. The stock has a
history of reacting correctly in the day or two before significant news. I'd
bet it was happening again and get out quick.

Mattel is simply a contrarian play with a lot of good brands that may or may
not be becoming obsolete. I'm betting it isn't and feel the odds are on my
side. But if it is, someone else will know before me. The support will be
busted, and I'll end up selling my Mattel to Jim at 20 or so.

FIC has a good ways to fall now. Think you're smart waiting.

I must say that everything I've been tracking or buying as a "Buffett-like"
stock hasn't performed at all well the last few years. The ones that have done
well have fallen back significantly given enough time. I'd think maybe I'm not
looking at the right kind of Buffett stocks, but even his stocks are not
tearing up the charts the last few years.

All that money being sucked into internets and tech is coming from somewhere,
and my gut tells me it's coming from a lot of former investors in solid,
money-making non-tech sectors. Look at the S&P 500 ex-technology and it's done
nothing this year. Might even be down. The Dow has been helped tremendously by
IBM.

Fair Isaac I bought in the 34's, watched it shoot to 44+. There was a point
when it fell the day before earnings. Volume shot up in the middle of the day
and it cratered a couple points. I called my wife (she's in IR and has access
to a lot of stuff I don't) and screamed "what the hell's happening?" The worst
feeling I've had about a stock all year. She pointed out some CBS story about a
Senate hearing on what goes into credit scores. I said, "no way." Didn't know
the earnings date though. If I had I would have sold, as it was obvious
something had leaked. So I did finally sell, 18 points lower.

"It's almost like a company with _Buffettology_ chararacteristics that is cheap
enough to pass on a valuation
basis has some bad momentum/bad news leaking out - but not yet fully priced
into the stock. "

Shane, my thoughts exactly. My feeling is that the market has already figured
out Buffett's ways. They've been analyzed to death. And the obvious Buffett
companies have been accorded to the proper valuation. It will be difficult for
Buffett, indeed...But then, it is this multiple expansion in Buffett companies
that got him his return to date.

Being contrarian above all else has been my number one most successful
principle. The second principle is knowing when to fold on a contrarian play.
The third is not being afraid of tech stocks.

That said, I bought Waste Management finally today, at 5/16 above its yearly
lows. Looking heavily at the retailers (got started with Ross, but also ANF,
BEBE). This time of year, it's a gut check. When to buy, when to sell in the
context of looming tax sales. Thinking of buying Old Republic (ORI), an insurer
with a PE of 6 and a nice balance sheet, 3+% dividend. Got any insight there,
Shane? And no, not giving up on FIC. Just waiting for it to stabilize. That was
some absolutely huge support it broke through, and there's really no guessing
where it will find its next base. Congrats on waiting.

I was on call last night and got quite a bit of time to review ORI. Bought an

The biggest con I see is a potential downturn in real estate, but geez hasn't
every homebuilder, S&L and title insurance company worth its salt been beaten
up to reflect this? ORI seems like it just would have a private market value
higher than its public one. Bigger con is it really doesn't have a base. I'm
breaking a rule there; we'll see if I pay for it. Usually I do, and then chock
it up to "it's cheaper than an MBA."

Retailers: I'm loading up. This is one of those sectors that meets my

If you are going to buy a stock with a chart like ORI with the intention of

I think I admitted it was breaking a rule a few posts ago. Hey, if it can hold
another few days, my dividend will pay for the trade.

but I would much rather build some conviction as to what the stock is worth,
buy at a substantial discount to that, and then wait for the market to
recognize the value. 

That's the noble way to do it. ORI is worth more than now, IMO. The
SVP/Secretary/General Counsel thinks it's worth more than 18. But then
Deswell's been worth more than 20 for years. And General Cigar is now trading
at an enterprise value:next year's earnings of about 3 with no debt. I've seen
ORI even out at this level a little bit. Fundamentally, there should be some
support here. If not, I'm out less than a few percent. On a less cynical note,
if the fall is due to an all-out slugfest for market share, we should see some
major consolidation pretty soon.

And yet another story on the downfall of value investing (Schafer Value) in
Barron's this weekend.

I'm wondering how many value investors saw their portfolios jump the 3% the
indices did Friday. Mine were only up about 1-1.75%, and looking at just my
portfolios I would have thought it was an average market up day. But then I
look at my "tech stocks" watch list and it's like, "what's going on here?"

I'd say the cyclicals turning provided a boost to value investors (myself
included), but that there really has not been any other identifiable shift into
value stocks per se. And if the Lazare Kaplans of the world did rally, they are
now back to ground zero.

Technically, there are a lot of stocks in no-man's land. They've broken through
to new lows, and if they've retraced up at all it's only back to near their old
lows. Some call this a "bull trap." And I've never seen it in so many stocks

McKesson to me has limited visibility. They're a middle man and can be squeezed
pretty severely. With Medicare coverage of drugs, prescription prices are the
next target, and I don't see middlemen prospering in this environment. Their
size is the wild card, but it's no certainty. It's a low return on equity, low
return on assets game. Drug distributors and PPM's just don't make much sense
to me now. Neither does health care software.

HealthSouth has been on an acquisition binge because they had to be. I don't
see this as an ego-driven spree, but rather one necessitated by the changing
dynamics that require big negotiators. They to me are positioned in the areas
that a)make the most sense economically - rehab is a high return on investment
for the payor, and they will sooner or later realize this and b)have the most
sympathy at HCFA.
HealthSouth has a good reputation as managers in my understanding.

As always, new lows and I'm out until another base is formed. But for now looks

Jeffrey,

I agree completely. HealthSouth is the low cost operator if things come to a

swoop, and the charge will cover a bunch of other things too.

Their AR is way up (at 1/4 of annual revs), but this is no manufacturing firm
stuffing the channel with unneeded product. HealthSouth provided needed,
documented services under contract with major insurers, and those major
insurers are simply not paying. Smaller doctor groups are going bankrupt
because of this widespread refusal of insurers to pay despite contractualy a,
and I believe this situation will break soon. There has to be some relief from
somewhere. That HealthSouth is actually producing free cash flow of about $640
million after cap ex, taxes, and interest coverage and despite the increasing
AR is tremendous. It's now going for about 7.5 times that very free cash flow.

I think it's important to focus too on the CEO's claim that Medicare will
become more profitable under PPS. For years, rehab prospered as one of the only
specialties free from the PPS bugaboo. They (and pediatrics) got a
cost-plus-profit-based reimbursement because nobody could figure out a good way
to measure the average cost of different illnesses from a diagnosis-related
perspective. For instance, Medicare would pay only X dollars for a broken femur
repair, and it was up to the hospital to provide the services for under X
dollars. This occurred via TEFRA of 1982 and the Social Security amendments of
1983 which established so-called DRG's, or Diagnosis-Related Groups.
After the femur was repaired (or stroke occurred, or head trauma occurred,
etc), the patient would be shipped to a rehab facility soon in order to get the
cost-plus-a-profit-based reimbursement and minimize the days under the
prospective payment plan. The sooner one could get the patient out of the acute
facility and into a rehab facility, the more money one could make. Rehab
facilities flourished from the mid-80's to the early 90s as many acute care
facilities built their own rehab adjuncts in order to take advantage of this
reimbursement loophole. 1987 was the first time the DHHS mandated a PPS for
rehab. But the deadlines passed without action because people were having a
hard time developing a measuring tool (most efforts centered on scoring the
physical ability of a rehab patient and paying a certain amount prospectively
depending on the numeric score, but there have been problems converting
phsyical qualities into numbers in a reliable fashion).

While working at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago during the summer of
1994, I wrote a paper entitled "The Coming Revolution in Rehabilitation
Medicine," which detailed the financial dynamics of the rehab industry for the
first time. I'll see if it's still around, and post it on my web site when I
get a chance.

Health care is a very very complex business. How the Medicare PPS will affect
rehab is uncertain, but due to the measurement difficulties associated with
rehab, it is possible it could turn into a decent profit-center again. Whatever
the situation, I am confident HealthSouth will be the one that can best take
advantage of it.

Rehab is absolutely one of the best things to hit medicine in the last 2
decades. If you want a pure play on the aging of the population, this is it.
And HealthSouth is the biggest, but by no means dominant. There is still room
for growth, both internal and external.

I took a smallish position before the crash, and quickly doubled the next
morning when I signed on. If I had been up when it opened in the 4's, I might
have tripled up. This is as contrarian as contrarian gets.

Jim, my number one priority right now is to read the "Art of Short Selling" by
Staley one more time. I am not short anything right now, but ache to do so, if
I can do it right.

Just two pitches for my way of doing things (feel free to ignore and move on):

Having a fairly diversified long portfolio worked wonders for me yesterday (and
kept me from doing anything rash ;)) I was down a minimal 0.35%. But I had been
up so much the previous two days in relation to the indices that I was
surprised to see that despite HealthSouth I outperformed the indices ('cept the
Nasdaq of course) over the last three days. My pitch for diversification to
15-20 value stocks: something will be moving up for you on average. Over the
last few mos I've had to deal with Fair Isaac's 44 to 26 fall and HealthSouth.
Because of those two stocks, I'm not up much since the end of June, but I am at
least up.

Also, I think HealthSouth points up a big difference between a value investor
who uses technical analysis to help find bottoms, and a contrarian investor who
just uses technical analysis. I have a rule that I sell when a new low is hit.
But I also have a rule to either add more or sell the position when I'm off 33%
since initiation. No waffling. When a stock trickles to a new low, despite the
fundamentals I'm going to exit. The reason being it can turn into a New
Holland, Deswell, Fruit of the Loom or Champion, and a screaming bottom might
be in the works later. But when a stock falls 40% through its old lows in one
day on 35X average volume with 8 broker downgrades, a technician would be
paralyzed and sell. A value investor would find it an opportune place to buy if
the original fundamental story is intact. This is just my pitch for how a
minimal degree of technical analysis doesn't hurt and can help. Pepsi is a
losing position for me now because I called it a Buffett stock and hence
justified buying "for the long-term" and didn't wait for the stock to fall to
its trading range lows (12.5% lower). BTW, technically Pepsi is now in no-man's
land,and I wouldn't buy again unless it gets to the high 20's.

The problem with the so-called value funds is that they mostly buy large caps
with big dividends. In other words, no growth and possibly declining
fundamentals.

Most of the value we talk about here resides in the mid-small-micro caps. I
don't know that many of the traditional value funds mirror what we pick here.

Yeah, I'm gonna toot my own horn...For a picture of a value-oriented portfolio,
that is doing pretty well without the techs and the MSFT, WMT, GE, T, etc.,

I've had a change of sentiment on the homebuilders. We all agree they're
cyclical. And one of the oldest rules of the market is to buy cyclicals when
the PEs are high or nonexistant, not when they are low. Low PE's in the
cyclicals classically call market tops, and if so then sans wealth effect all
of a sudden homebuilders don't look so great with all the debt and no income. I
got out of my National RV today on the same thesis. Went more short: today it

story on it. There's virtually no barriers to entry otherwise. Now Microsoft
Expedia is getting into the act, as is TSG. There's really no reason to buy
them, since the basic replacement cost is so little, so I see buyout risk as
low but there. That said, the stock just crumbled under support and I'm
shorting into the dead cat bounce. That's my logic anywho.

Indices by necessity drag a lot stocks, but IMO most individual stocks not in

support/trendline technical rules. Futures and hence indices yes. But not so
much individual stocks.

Waste Management at new low today, Crossman and National RV making new
intermediate-term lows today. All are badly wounded in terms of support. Newly
wounded Ross Stores struggling to keep its nose back above 40. But the indices
and most stocks tied to the indices were up today, as VIX and you predicted.
I'm still glad I made my sales.

Every time a favorite of mine enters the no-man's land below significant

Well, the S&P 500 hasn't been tearing up the charts this year. Some articles
are even appearing regarding the 75% of managers beating the market. The Nasdaq
has been relentless in its push higher. It took a hit from the internet fallout
and steadied itself and started moving again. I must admit that I'm not sure
what stocks are doing it there. I do see Cisco, Intel, and Microsoft all
recently pushed to new highs. Beyond that, I'm not that familiar with the big
names in the Nasdaq. The Dow got its cyclical boost and has been helped big by
its few technology names. Take a look at the R2000 - up only 2.96% this year,
down from 8.46% as of June 30th. As well, the S&P 500 is now up 8.62% vs up
11.67% as of June 30th.

So what's going on here?? In the S&P, if it isn't tech, it ain't up, and in
fact there is some big underperformance going on in the non-tech names to
counteract the sizable tech weighting in the index. And if it's small cap,
well, if it isn't tech it has been simply creamed. I suspect that this is where
the frustration of the value investor lay. Compare to the 2Q, when most value
investors cheered and the R2000 was up over 15%. That 2Q was also when the Dow
got its cyclical push and moved up 12.11%.

Every once in a while I pick up on something and start to feel bearish. It can
get overwhelming. I see a lot of stocks not acting right, as you said. But the
money has to go somewhere. Liquidity continues to drive the market. Hence the
increasing narrowness of the advance. And when the nets faltered, first
cyclicals and then traditional tech stepped up to the plate to carry on. I see
the potential for a continued rotational bull, with the indices representing
less and less of the actual market performance.

MOO,

Re: ANLY, I actually bought back in today at 10 1/8 after selling when it
started to crumble last week. The price to me discounted this news when it fell
from 30 to 14. The extra push down to the current level is just disgust. But we
all knew this was happening - just as we all know things will improve when Y2K
passes. We still have decent insider buying at prices above this. It may be
dead money, but sometimes the wait (e.g. Midway) can be worth it. It also may
go back to its old lows, at which point I'd buy a little more.

This was predicted by the price action last week. I also bought Crossman again
after it dived 4 points from my sell price just a few days ago. Ross (another
buy and sell for me) continues its fall, as does Mesaba, Washington Mutual.
I've got targets to buy Ross in the low 30s, and Washington Mutual in the high
20's. There's credence to support levels and their relevance.

I think maybe the overreaction today may well be due to people seeing your read
of things. They pre-announced for
fiscal 2000 first half (which is 3rd and 4th quarters of Calendar Year 1999),
and say they see strong numbers resuming in the second half of FY 2000 (which
is 1st and 2nd quarters of CY 2000). No surprises here for me - and evidently
not for you if you read it again.

IMO, I just see a sector that is crushed and nobody wants to own, not unlike
commodities and oil stocks at the beginning of the year. ANLY just took the
mystery out of the numbers - most people knew they would miss, but didn't know
by how much. Now it is clear it ain't all bad, and BTW they can still cover

It may already be recovering as people read the release more carefully ;)

Re: ROE/PE and other stuff

ROE/PE: I've often thought of it, and always note it in my "Buffett" picks. To
me, it is kinda of an "organic" PEG ratio. But I believe it is too simplistic,
and as long as it is used to apply to stocks without proven ability to sustain
that ROE, it is just as misleading as a PEG. In cyclicals, of course, it can be
downright deadly. And in leveraged firms, useless. I just prefer to look at
cash return on capital instead.

On that note, I've noted cyclicals at their peak in earnings but down in price
because everyone's predicting doom can be very sexy. I mean, four or five times
earnings and three or four times cash flow for a stock that grew earnings
20-30% the last 4 years and has a 15-25% ROE and 10-12% ROA. Seems that if it
can just hold on and not cycle down for another year or two, you've got a
double. And if sentiment changes just a whiff, you've got a three-bagger or
more. I've yet to be successful buying into this particular sex appeal, though.

The homebuilders and banks look good at these prices until you see where they
were in 1990-91 - and we're only looking at the ones that survived.

And every cyclical stock that we've thought would never hit October 98 lows
again - they're either on their way, or already there.

Another deal: when every cyclical in an industry heads to new lows except one
or two which seem to hold up better, is it ever prudent to buy that leader or
those leaders? I've just noticed that eventually they topple and head to new
lows too, and hence there's often a better price waiting .

N, This time there's a lot going against VIX. All kinds of broken support
and/or trendlines both in stocks and indices. The S&P held above 1296 yesterday
on tech strength alone. Too narrow to really provide support.

All: Microsoft has an interest in deflating the market, remember.
Their employee stock and option programs have been hurting them the last few
years, and the reason is the inflated price. People don't go to work for MSFT
for the salary - they do it for the stock and option plans. So Microsoft
long-term must be a big buyer, and as any Buffett fan knows that means they are
rooting for it to go down - any break, however temporary, helps.

Why this spilled over into the financials (which were having a good day) and
others - well, you just need to look at the technicals dragging down the S&P
500 futures, mandating selling in the underlying securities. The S&P now needs
to go to the low 1200's.

Jim, what's this about your colleague Miller wanting to buy Amazon.com? He says
Bank One is worth twice what it is now. And says Waste Management should be in
the low 30's. Well, isn't that where he bought it in the first place? What kind
of guy is he? Also says Washington Mutual should be 30-40% higher, which puts
it back where it was when he first started buying loads of it.

In their SEC Filing 10Q, they noted "moderating demand for unsecured consumer
debt products."

That was the warning . Growth is dependent on the bond community receiving
these things well. This can get ugly, since finance companies often support
their securitizations by backing them, making them "semi-secured."

We're looking at $70 billion + in credit card debt that is an asset on Bank

much will have to be written off from here (given that once the bubble is

Re: ONE

I'm just wary of stocks that every investor is calling a value stock. The spin
doesn't match the price action.
The last thing I would buy ONE for is its dividend. By my reading the
securitized market just turned off ONE's credit card growth spicket.
Equity/Capital at 10%, but is probably misleading. We're talking equity of 12
billion, and credit card debt (as an asset) over $70 billion, most of which has
already been securitized with implicit back-up from ONE. ONE can possibly be on
the hook for more than its legal requirement if the loans go bad. What we do
know is ONE's equity ain't secured. That dividend may have very, very low
priority at some point in the near future.

Then of course we don't know how much credit card debt is financing speculation
on margin into internuts. 

This is the wild card that just makes my head spin. A few years ago, before net
mania, there was 4000 in credit card debt for every human being in the US. I
doubt many of them paid that off before they went and invested in the stock
market. This bubble was created from liquidity, and it isn't all coming from
retirement money.

Too big to fail maybe, and maybe we should look at what Citibank got to in the
early 90s as a guidepost for a safe buy point.

Geez, I posted quite a long response from work. Evidently didn't post cuz I

and 10Ks to see how big a problem it is for them to have to buy back stock at
such high prices. We're talking in the billion-dollar range.

The net is that they have to buy in stock to prevent dilution thanks to their
lucrative stock compensation scheme. First 9 mos of 1999 they bought back 25
million shares. That's a significant drop-off from the prior few years, and
scuttlebutt is that Gates himself has fretted about spending so much to buy
back stock just to get back to even. Hey, when Gates wants something dirty
done, who delivers the message? The Prez. Ballmer knew what he was doing. The

Thanks. Get this from Reuters:

Ballmer himself is famously bearish about Microsoft's prospects and said at the
same meeting that expectations the company could continue to grow revenues at a
25 percent annual rate were ''outlandish and crazy.''

However, analysts said Ballmer's broader comments about the technology industry
this week likely were unplanned.

''He has a tendency to shoot from the hip,'' noted Bill Whitlow, a money
manager for Safeco Corp. mutual funds whose biggest position is in Microsoft.

Right after Bill reads this, I'm sure he says, "Steve, mission accomplished. I
don't know what I'd do without you." And then the two richest men in the US
have a good laugh.

How are the value investors faring during the recent downdraft? 

What I've noticed lately is that value stocks will ultimately wither with the
market when the market gets a bearish streak, but will not snap back with the
rally. Earlier this year, that wasn't the case. This is what happened last
year, when small value stocks kept getting pressed down with market swoops,
then didn't rally when the market jumped. Over time, it got ugly.

I did ok yesterday, down about 1/2 as much as the market. But things came apart
today and I'm down 5 times as much (thats 1.8%). (Thanks, Deswell - again.) I
think this is what got the Lindner guy fired.

Jim,

I thought of you this week as I looked at the stocks on my some-25 watch lists,
and noted that of the hundreds of stocks, the net stocks are doing quite well.
I had thought you covered. Ouch.

For the last week I've been carrying "The Art of Short Selling" around with me
just about everywhere. Every time I get a break, I just open to a chapter.
Doesn't matter if I've already read it. I just read it again.

If there's one thing that keeps hitting me in the head about that book and its
cases is that there's a lot of time to short and still come out ahead. The
problem with net stocks is that they appear as if they require constant capital
infusions, which makes them good shorts. But they're getting these infusions at
will. That makes now now a good time. When the capital spicket is turned off,
the stocks will react downward, but won't fully account for how bad the news is
then. They'll be terminally wounded but the price won't reflect it. That's when
IMO you'll be able to grab a lot of the net stocks on their way to zero. But
before that, a lot of smaller companies will pitch themselves to larger
companies. So the wild card is that they get taken over by a bigger, stupider,
more capital-rich, company, a la Yahoo of GeoCities, which stands out as the
single most characteristic action of this era. The AofSS describes this risk as
the thing that keeps ss's sweaty-palmed and awake at night. I think for good
reason.

For my next, more certain short, I'm taking a long, measured look at Pre-Paid
Legal (PPL). I posted why over on that thread. I think I finally understand
that one.

To me, the reason to invest in something like LKI or MAXS is precisely because

Yes. And it will add greatly to one's returns if they all get just 20% cheaper.
At the recent rates of decline, the wait may only be a few weeks, or even days.
Still say it's safer to wait for some stability. Even the oil sector and the

My general rule is to hold for 50%, then reduce my position back to its
original size if it is still worth holding, or sell all if the position is no
longer competitive with other potential positions.

But what I do with quick 30-40% gains is an art, not a science. I take into
account the technical characteristics of the run-up as well as potential
fundamental reasons to get a picture of the durability and quality.

I'm perfectly willing to buy and hold, but if there is a 30-40% run in a short
time that I consider a trading gain, I'll take it. If I just bought a stock,
chances are it was competing with other stocks for entry into the portfolio
just two weeks ago. If it has now run 40% in two weeks, and the other
potentials haven't, well then I definitely will take into account the new
relative value disparity.

And if a stock hits new lows, I'll usually sell it unless the dividend is
particularly outsized or the valuation particularly outrageous.

I do like Washington Mutual - I sold when it broke a technical support pattern,
expecting to buy it back when it got to its old lows. Well, it's basically
there. As a rule I revisit the security when it gets within 10% of old lows, so
I've been looking real hard at Washington Mutual. Between my REITs and my Old
Republic, I'm already exposed to real estate. WM would be additional exposure
for me, as would any re-buy of a homebuiler. So since I expect tax-loss selling
to hit the financial sector pretty hard, as well as the potential for
deteriorating fundamentals, I'm willing to be patient. With equity/assets of
under 5%, WM is not in the strongest shape should its fundamentals deteriorate,
i.e. real estate deflate. Out here in Silicon Valley, everyday life feels like
a bubble. People can hardly comprehend when I tell them about 90-92 and the

The Apple/Wintel comment was just an off-hand reference, not meant in any way

Management flubbed something, and they've lost credibility with Wall Street for

More on FLO:

It appears that the market now values FLO ex-KBL stock at about 19M. This for
an enterprise that brought in 1.55 billion in sales last year, and possesses
quite a few brand as well as distribution advantages.

The catch: Flowers ex-Keebler is responsible for about $550M - or about 5 1/2
bucks per share -in debt, and must come up with somewhat above $40M each year
in order to make its interest payments. It cannot access Keebler's cash flow,
which brings us to problem number 2 - Keebler has supplied virtually all the
operating cash flow reported by Flowers in the first six months this year. Take
a more normal year, like say 98, and FLO ex-KBL EBITDA is about $178 million.
Cap ex is somewhere around $100 million - reading back through Flowers SEC
stuff, it appears to be capital intensive business. Surprise, surprise. The
coverage is there, but it really is not a wonderful business for equity
holders. ROA is no better than industry averages if you don't count Keebler.
For 99, there's nada.

Earthgrains trades at a PSR of 0.49, and Interstate Bakeries trades at a PSR of
0.49. Both have debt/equity ratios of about 1/2 of Flowers ex-Keebler. Allowing
for the debt, my estimate is that Flowers equity should trade around $200
million. I get this by applying a 1/2 sales multiple to 1.55 billion, then
subracting out the debt of $550M, and reconciling this with an industry P/B of
about 2 when not depressed- which would give a total market value of about 720
million - and again subtracting out the debt. Also I looked at free cash flows
of about about 40 million available to shareholders after interest and taxes in
a typical year, and put a 5-6 multiple on that. This tells me that Flowers
equity ex-Keebler should trade for somewhere between 170 and 240 million.
Compared to 19M now.

So properly executed, an arbitrage could be very profitable if the market
cooperates. One just has to get over the idea of shorting the fastest-growing
portion of Flowers, and be confident that Flowers won't face any kind of
liquidity crisis that would cause the company to sell out its equity holders.

Lesson learned: Initially I missed the fact that Keebler is little more than a
share price floor for Flowers shareholders, as its cash flow is really not
accessible. I underestimated the risk of FLO equity going to zero and
overestimated the margin of safety as a result. What I thought was a 10-minute
no-brainer wasn't.

On the contrary, smoking is not guaranteed to take years
off one's life. Only a small percentage of smokers get
cancer or emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Just like only
a small percentage of alcoholics have to ever deal with
liver tumors or cirrhosis. To figure out one's own risk,
take a look at the family tree. There's probably some
smokers. In my case, on my dad's side, both his parents
smoked and died of lung cancer in their early 60s. My dad
died of lung cancer at 51 probably because of second hand
smoke. So no way no how am I going to smoke. And as for
young children, genetics still play a bigger role than the
actual presence of smoke in determining most maladies.

The take-home message from MO is that when a company facing
potential large liability sees its chief legal officer sell
nearly all his shares at what had previously been a solid
support level (34ish), it does not bode well. I didn't buy

I just go for what has value. To me, ignoring tech doesn't make sense. I've
done well with Apple, Oracle, American Power this year. IMO, applying
traditional value criteria to tech is deadly, because there is usually a reason
it looks like a value, and it is too technical to understand.
So in tech I look for:

1) Big, Buffett-like established companies with tremendous
cash-generating ability that are out of favor despite a franchise on something
2) Small techs trading at about cash with no debt. They usually do well in my
experience.

In tech, good management is rare and when it is present limits become merely a

I did talk to HRC about the purchases, and they are all company-financed. You
can read about it in the April proxy. It's near the front. There's a maximum of
$50 million available for this executive loan program. The stock is collateral,
and there is a margin feature to it.

When I kind of made the point (by remaining silent)to the CFO's rep that this
didn't make me happy he said "but they are all full-recourse loans," somewhat
defensively. Of course this means that if the stock goes to nothing, then the
company can lay claim to the personal assets of the insiders. One kind of
assumes it would be this kind of loan, but I guess it's good to know anyway.

Much has been made about company loans to insiders for stock purchases, but I
am not sure they are altogether a bad thing. I see that the idea is to
encourage a lot of investment without requiring a large cash lay up front, and
I can understand that. I still like to see them lay out the cash, though.

I continue to like HRC. There is a lot that's cheap in the health care sector,
and HRC is definitely still one of them. It is also a screaming tax-loss sell
for most institutions, so I expect more pressure before the year is out.

Re: HRC vs. EBSC, can you believe I haven't even looked at EBSC yet? Has it met

HRC to me is being exceptionally well run considering the acquisition
integration and industry challenges that it is facing. Physician practices are
going bankrupt because insurers are not honoring their contracts and paying
bills on time. So the huge accounts receivable is not HRC-specific. But most
analysts look at the AR and DSO and just think warning signs. Despite this,
cash flow remains large. It is as contrarian as anything. With billions in debt
and the industry they are in, I think most institutions are just glancing right
by. Not noticing the half-billion in free cash flow, or the 5X coverage ratio.
Add in tremendous tax-loss selling, and I thin that there is a very good chance
of a 50% two-year gain on the conservative side from these levels. If it goes

D,

Good observations. I did indeed set the minimum market cap at $2.5 million. I
changed the web site to reflect that error.

I used
1) Market Cap < (NWK * 2/3), where NWK is CA-CL
2) Total Debt/Equity <50

This gave me an exportable list of 99 names and values that I could put in
Excel and work with. Then I manually entered restricted cash, long-term debts,
long-term liabilities, and minority interest, and subtracted all that from the
NWK value to give a new column, net net value. Given that I was going to have
to manually check the market caps and share amounts anyway, I figured this was
feasible. Doing it your way - figuring out the LT debt variable with a
user-defined formula - is a good short cut, and in fact Graham's formula really
just uses LTD. I take it a step further. So your net is bigger, and hence you
catch more fish.

A lot of the valuations changed in a big way when I looked at the true
liabilities and true market caps. I eliminated several that were not currently
reporting, or had unreliable data. Nearly 30 turned out to have MK/NN ratios
greater than 1.

I would not be surprised if your method turned out to be the best quickie way
to find net nets on the net. The extra time spent screening your extra fish may
be less than my extra research time.

nobody will be charged for anything posted there, and there won't be any
advertising (and no, basically nobody buys books at the bookstore). Market
efficiency to net nets? I doubt I'll live to see it (and I'm pretty young). I
just got back from the hospital tonight, and I'm back again tomorrow, and then
all weekend, and then q3 in-house call next month...can you believe that I
haven't had a chance yet to look at my own list of net nets with a critical eye
for investment purposes? And I probably won't find that time for the next week

The problem with a WAMU takeover is it is just itself getting organized after
eating quite a few S&L's itself. It would be acquiring second-hand indigestion.

I like the company a lot though, and am hating that I didn't buy it back at 28,

In defense, I ran that screen in early October. There are three major problems
with it: 1) the volatility in market caps makes the net net calculations much
different than today 2) the inaccuracy of market caps as calculated by Market
Guide (they are bad at it) that would eliminate a lot of stocks that might be
otherwise included, and 3)the balance sheets may have changed, as 10Q's have

On ROE, first and foremost we must recognize that any debt inflates ROE.
Returns on assets, capital, etc... are more conservative.

Further on ROE, is high ROE itself the goal? Not at all. A high ROE is only
worth something if it is sustainable, and only then as a marker that there
should be market power and hence pricing power in the business. What a high
return on equity/capital tells you is that there is an increased ability to
create something extra out of a given level of investment/assets, thanks to a
brand, moat, whathaveyou that allows either monopolist power when dealing with
customers or monopsonist power when dealing with suppliers. As an example,
WalMart's special attraction as an investment lies in its monopsonist rather
than monopolist features.

Whenever I see a high ROE that appears sustained, I need to identify the moat
before I get too comfortable. If the barrier isn't there, then that high ROE
should be a warning sign. The problem with the midwest industrials is that the
moat isn't readily identifiable. Hence, nearly by definition, a lot of their
super-high ROE's are cyclical, and we are near that peak. So there will be a
lot of favorable ROE vs. P/B comparisons as the stock price anticipates a
downside and the current earnings still represent the upside.

There's no two ways about it for me. Either a high ROE means something because
it is proven sustainable with an identifiable moat that gives it market power,
or a high ROE means something else. Only the former attracts my interest on the
long side, which is of course Buffettesque.

Finally, we have recently spoken here of costs of capital in the 8-10% range.
Well, if we are assuming that the high returns on equity are meaningful and
hence relatively unleveraged, then we should be assuming costs of capital quite
a bit higher, as equity is of course typically more expensive than debt.

"What I can't get a good analytical handle around is, how much of a premium
should I rationally pay for an exceptionally high and sustainable ROE? "

How do you define premium? With Buffett-like high and sustainable ROE
companies, I think looking upon it as a required and expected annualized
compounding return on investment above 20% is acceptable. On my ValueStocks.net
site, there's a Tools page that has a spreadsheet that does this calculation.
On a lot of the already-popular consumer stocks, you'd be surprised how many
come out with a ~10% annual expected return despite high ROE's because the
price is so high already - effectively, the market is pricing these stocks for
average performance. This aspect of the spreadsheet model tells me that it is
has worth, if only as an adjunct.

With the returns from the last five years, you could at least break even with a

Scott, I hope you realize how cocky and wrong-headed that statement might look
in hindsight. It's now been recorded for posterity when I or Jim write the
book. But realize it takes only a 33% fall to wipe out a 50% gain. And a 50%
fall wipes out a 100% gain. And if you don't think any of these scenarios are
possible, well, all it takes now is a mid-high single digit PE on the S&P 500
(something that seems to recur through history) to create a 80% loss. Got any
clue what that wipes out? (hint: everything) Don't even get me started on the
leveraged households that will participate in this.

And if history is any guide, inflation can as much as quintuple the damages

Bill Miller's been long Amazon and hence pounding the table in the press (as he
did for Bank One, Waste Management, McKesson - he stopped pounding as they got
hacked to bits after his big buys) for a while now. He had a reputation for not
hyping his positions, and now that he's made a name for himself he is clearly
taking it upon himself to spread the word about the positions he takes. Now, he
has a reputation for hyping his positions. Or at least in my mind.

Now, for the article. First, realize that he is now actually writing the
article in Barron's rather than being quoted. Christ. The SEC should almost be
called in (yeah, I know, he acknowledges his big position). Second, he calls
himself a value investor, when in fact he is starting a second fund that will
allow him to invest in growth stocks unhindered by the value moniker.

Third, he says reward is commensurate with risk. So he basically abandons value
investing implicitly right there. One can just about write off the whole
article.

Fourth, he takes supranormal historic return as proof that stocks were
undervalued, and then takes it as proof that they could have been proven
undervalued before the supranormal returns took place. When even he admits he
couldn't see it in Cisco.

He then takes a long-winded approach to justifying playing the lottery. And he
uses this to justify Amazon.com. After all, you can only lose your entire
investment! He believes he'll win, but then admits there are two variables
here: his opinion of AMZN's future AND his risk threshold.

My opinion: Bill Miller is coming to the market rather than letting it come to
him. He has elevated his risk threshold in order to continue his streak of
beating the S&P 500. And he's fooled himself into thinking it's all logical.

Re: Amazon.com, the real premise that many bulls have is that it can turn a
huge profit in an instant if it just stopped marketing so hard. I say a) no,
they wouldn't be profitable if they stopped marketing so hard - just look at
the P&L and b) they need the marketing anyway when someone can just point and
click somewhere else.

Another point of mine: On my Explorer browser, I have this neat thing called
Favorites. In Netscape, they're called Bookmarks. That my friends is the mall
of the future. I'll go to the cheapest site for toys, the cheapest for
electronics, the cheapest for books...and the mall will be right there
programmed into my browser, not all at one site. Why AMZN is spending so
voracioiusly to become the web mall when everyone can just as easily create a
web mall on their browser is beyond me.

When I read Armin's comment, I had the same reaction you and Jim did. As far as
REITs go, the biggest problem facing them is not the unit trusts or the
possible cyclical downturn in certain sectors. Rather, IMO it's that the
required return on equities for most investors these days is somewhere north of
25%. Per week. So what does a guaranteed taxable 14-18% offer an investor with
such a high discount rate? Nada. A lot of my favorite REITS have absolutely
fallen off a cliff in the last month, and I'm looking to move in with more
capital. If the markets really take a dive, I expect the REIT sector (and not
the net nets) to be one of the few true safe havens.

Re: retail

Raise your hand if you are spending at least 1/3 of your Xmas shopping on the
internet. I'd ask you to raise your hand if you are getting outrageous deals,
but I already know it's 100% of those with hands raised.

I'm not sure how the net will play out, but the current valuation of any stock
assumes an effective earnings stream that goes out 20-30 years. Knock out the
last 20 years of that stream and really the stock quite rightly loses a lot of
its value. That said, what will the retail environment look like in 10 years?
It's hard to say, but there's a good chance that with the onset of the internet
the world of retail becomes much, much much more competitive. You don't need to
be an economist to know what that means. Returns come down.

IOW, retail is now a worse business in terms of potential market power,
margins, and returns on capital than it was just 10 years ago. Lower those
barriers to entry and put a mouse in everyone's hand, and that's what you get.
JCP, Sears, Kmart. They are in for some rough times, and frankly, some
contracting market share and the loss of whatever pricing or purchasing power
they now possess IMO.

Any valuation then has to look at liquidating value, takeover value (whatever
that is), or a very speculative and downtrodden approximation of discounted PV
of cash flows. Difficult, difficult.

Just as papers are still delivered and read, people will continue to shop at
the malls, etc. They do so for social as much as any other reason. 

My argument isn't that people will stop going to malls, but that it will become
an even more competitive, and hence low-return, business activity. A lot of
retail businesses will go from being good businesses to poor yet still
marginally profitable businesses.

Your comment about people raising there hands if they do 1/3 shopping on
internet is misplaced. 

All told, now of total Xmas sales, about 2-3% will be over the internet this
year, and that's like 10X last year's. I see no reason why this won't continue
to explode upward. That's coming right out of the hide of traditional
retailers. And if you look 20-30 years out, boy it gets bloody. Here in Silicon
Valley, malls are trying to ban their tenants from advertising their web sites.

I do want to say that the new emphasis on P/S ratios in the press is an obvious
ploy to cater to the outrageous valuations of internet retailers. Here on the
value thread, we've looked at a lot of retailers over the last few years,and we
know that retailers often get sub-1 PSR's for a reason - big margins are the
exception.

It's just basic economics - inject more competition into a market and the
margins and returns shrivel. I realy wonder as to the achievement and
maintenance of any market power in the retail segment as more and more people
become familiar with the mouse. Any valuation of JCP or other retailers will
have to take a somewhat speculative look at maybe a 3 or 4 or 10 stage dividend
discount model to estimate this impact.

There are lots of potential scenarios. If and when the capital markets stop
funding the .com's losses, traditional retailers with cash flow will no doubt
regain an edge to a degree. It's all just very hard to estimate, IMO, and
playing JCP for its contrarian virtues may not be the way to go.

Re: ANF, that was a clear, clear overreaction for the retailer with the top
turns/returns in the industry. When it hit the 22's, I just thanked God that
the momentum players bought it in the first place so that they could do such a
concentrated sell, and then gobbled it up.

Re: AEOS, it's a clear copycatter of ANF. Yet when I go to ANF, I like the
clothes. When I go to AEOS, I don't like them. And this is reflected in the
ROA, ROE, margins. When I bought ANF at 22 and change, AEOS was more expensive.
ANF should command a significant premium. If ever the sector is down again, I'd
go with ANF unless AEOS was just much, much more undervalued.

Re: the lawsuits, here's my understanding. ANF generally does not communicate
with the Street well. ANF as a whole is very equitable, treating its individual
smaller shareholders well by holding insider info close to the chest (as
indicated by its quarterly SSS reports). Unlike the rest of the companies on
the Street. This pisses the Street off. The purpose of the Street is to come
off as smarter and hence retain client assets. When they are not allowed that
luxury (through chummy and illegal meetings with CFO's, CEO's, and IR
personnel), their purpose is defeated.

So along comes ANF, and they slip. An insider leaked to an analyst. WHICH
HAPPENS EVERY DAY IN THE BIGGEST COMPANIES ON THE STREET. But oooh, now the
Street has something on ANF. All that time sitting on their hands with nothing
to offer their clients, and then they get a chance to downgrade. It was quite
an impressive slew. Many of the downgrades the day after the news broke have
since been reversed. But hey, nothing says "the Street" like "churning client
accounts."

Now, how about the lawsuits? Well, insider leaks, downgrades, depressed share
price. Heck, it just had to happen. Nothing a rising share price and continued
positive earnings comparisons won't cure. And nothing that would have hurt the
company anyway. Actually, I'm surprised that prnnewswire and businesswire allow
their services to be abused by the law firms like this - it's basically just
advertising for clients to make enough of a class to be certified. Yahoo! Quote

ACO would've been great cheaper, but now I'm just thinking that I'm being
compensated for my risk as an arbitrageur. I think I'll pass based on the scope
of the unknowns. It's interesting that they're being careful to quote the sales
of the remaining enterprise, while we know what they're selling is their
higher-margin business. I'll put it on my list of things to investigate.

Now, if I could find a company that was where ACO was at last Jan-Feb, with a
liquidatable $14 dollar asset, a remaining dominant business worth $4-5, and
selling at $8 1/2, then I'd be in it like Flynn.

As far as arbitrage, I held the Case position in my mom's account all the way
until the close. Looks like about 5 months for $7.75 on a 47.25 base. That's
about 39% annualized. The tech focus of the market will let these types of
yields happen. ACO may be another one. But with good utilities at 5-8% and
REITs at 10-15% and an industrial company or two at 10-11%, there's more
competition out there for my income/crash resistant money.

Goodyear popped up in my universe as a contrarian, what with the share price
falling off a cliff and it getting booted from the Dow and all.

But from a value standpoint, I'm not convinced. It's a leader in the field
maybe but it's not a true growth company. It remains priced quite high when I
look at the huge maintenance cap ex. This is mature and I don't expect it to
grow out of its hole. Looks like the stock quadrupled over two decades early
70's to early 90's. Long-term growth rate around 7% - and that may be coming
down. And with Dogs of Dow selling coming at year-end. For a PE 16 stock, I
still see a lot of downside. For this multiple, I'd rather be in Ralph Lauren.

And the yield to me seems 1)not protected and 2)decent at nearly 4% but

after-tax annualized rate of return of about 12%, but I don't see it as a
bargain. The positives are its consistency, with rising ROA, ROE in an industry
that will not be rocked by tech changes. Negatives are that from current
valuations by my calculation, one can only expect 11.66% on average over the
next 10 years if held that long. Given that it is making new 52 week lows, it
may reach a PE in the mid-high single digits, which would drastically improve
its potential return. Oh yeah - I'm looking at it from a Buffett perspective
rather than an asset-based Grahamian one. Interestingly, if it gets to old
support around 15, it's expected annual return jumps to 15.26%. At that point I
would consider buying. Insider buying at those levels (less than 1/2 old highs)
would help too.

Re: shorts,

So far this year, shorting has been nicely profitable for me. Yes, even AMZN,
which I recently re-shorted at 84 and change. I've got a list of potential
shorts on Yahoo that is simply exploding upward. New highs and all. Keeping my
powder dry and as far as I'm concerned those are analogues to undervalued
depressed stocks. There will be a glorious opportunity to short them. I've
taken some profits, had a good year now with some cash, and watching for short
opportunities as well as buy opportunities (I've got 6 I want to buy now but
why not wait for better prices). There's some merit to what J. Bash has to say.
I don't think shorting the QQQ is the answer. But to give up on shorting when
short candidates are as omnipresent now as undervalued stocks were at the
bottom of the '74 bear, or to buy the QQQ isn't the answer either. There's
still room for intelligent investing, IMO.

You will notice that Mike Burry argues for short selling as a very good
opportunity in today's or tomorrow's market, and his actual short position is
very small compared to his overall portfolio and is used as a hedge, according
to his site notes. 

To me, this seems the only logical way. The traditional argument is that only
those with enough capital to short for the long term can consistently make
money. Ok, but if so, then what is the actual return on the at-risk TOTAL
capital. If one must have "enough capital" to tolerate a 300% loss on a short
position without hurting too much - and being able to maintain the position-
then the 100% maximum profit on that position won't amount to much more than an
incremental percentage return on actual available capital even if it does
occur.

Where is that excess capital (the capital that allows you to maintain a
long-term short position) best deployed to maximize the total return on
capital? IMO, assuming that none of us can time markets well (an assumption
that I feel is very valid), the best place for that capital is in long
positions. At least then you're hedged with the odds of your own good
fundamental analysis with you on both sides.

Interestingly, I've found that even a small short hedge (I've been up to 10%)
position against a long portfolio can be amazingly effective during a general
downturn - along with an obligatory gold position and a solid oil position.

Paul, with all due respect, I just don't get your buying of stocks as they make

only to continue drastic sell-offs. If there's one thing that's kept me ahead
this year it's stepping aside of disasters by selling when a new low is made. I
don't wait for an uptrend. I just avoid buying new lows or when the stock is an
area where no support has ever been established. Don't know if it will continue
to work in the future, but to me there's a logical basis to this practice.

Goodyear Tire I did a paper short on after rejecting it as a value stock. Too

Centex: I just took a position two days ago at 23 1/2 as it hovered near lows,
50% off highs, with big insider buying with more diversified business structure
than just a homebuilder or just a manufactured home maker.

Then I sold today at 22 3/4. Yep, my "new lows" rule kicking in. I wonder how
low it will go. I may regret selling. But so far this year, all I know is that
I haven't regretted it even once when I've followed this rule in our beloved
value sector.

What did I replace it with? For now, it's Crane (CR), which I bought at today's
high (18 3/8). Jim likes it, and Mario Gabelli just pitched it this morning on
CNBC. Great ROE and ROIC for its industry and at all-time low valuations. Its
cash flow is much higher than its accounting earnings. But the last time
valuations got this low the shares hit a 3 year go-nowhere patch (early 90's)
in which earnings hit a rough spot. There's also a spin-off coming up. It just
seems very cheap and very safe as a longer-term hold, out of which I'd expect
about 17% annually after-tax if I could hold for 10 years.

if they are making new lows to boot, then it's time to sell or sit on the

only exception to this for me are the REITs, which have been so outrageously
overpunished, and which offer a logical place for the liquidity to move if the
market gets shaky (as they did last spring). Housing stocks and even my Crane -
when valuations got like this in the past it meant earnings tumbles for several
years and higher PEs while the stocks went nowhere. I agree with Jim's

For me, it's the $64,000 question.

It's been noted here before, but one of the biggest traps that novice value
investors can fall into is that of the "growth at a value price" when in fact
the market already is just showing that it knows that the barriers to entry
simply splinter in the face of fresh capital.

What really gets me about the internets is not so much the valuations, but that
so much of it is indefensible. For instance, Exodus Communications is borrowing
$1 billion at 10% to build data centers round the world. Intel could do the
same thing, with greater brand name, and would hardly have to borrow to do it.
And if it did, it could borrow at much less than 10%, and provide much of its
own hardware.

Now, it's easy to pick on the Exoduses of the world, but the teasers with PE's
of 15 and ROE of 60% should be no less suspicious.

Jim, Glad to see it working for you. Me, look at what I just did today (because

Sold Disney, PECO.

Bought Washington Mutual, Ross Stores, Ethan Allen, more Clayton Homes, more
Tricon Global. Two days ago, I bought Philip Morris.

I feel like a kid in a candy store. There are quite a few values in the market,
IMO, and I don't feel the need to play net nets. The stuff I'm buying passes
EVA muster at the same time it passes various other value criteria IMO. This of
course raises the question whether I would ever play net nets at a true market
bottom. My strategy with net nets is the opposite of what Tweedy Browne found
(they having found that it was the money-losing crappy businesses that were the
money makers for net net investors). Rather, since I am not playing the
tried-and-true diversified approach to net nets, I'm only buying net nets when
I see "corroborating value" in the story/cash flow/earnings/potential/insider
activity/whatever. EBSC I own now, but for different reasons than you might
think. After buying, I realized it is not really a net net when you consider
the operating leases. There is corroborating value though, so I held. With LKI,
an updated 10Q revealed it wasn't a net net, and I couldn't find corroborating
value, so I sold. With General Cigar, I was up to my ears in corroborating
value no matter what the inventory really was worth.

saying that Graham's net net calc is pretty simple. If he could be pressed on
different types of off-balance sheet liabilities today as regards his net net
strategy, how do you think he'd treat operating leases? Maybe he'd assume it's

I think the you hit it twister. When looking at net nets as individual picks in
a concentrated portfolio in a frothy market, we're not following Graham's
method very well anyway. So I insist on extra corroborating value
analysis/evidence to help me when I add my one or two or three net nets to a
portfolio. Tweedy Browne has done some proprietary research on this which which
is mentioned here and there in various investing texts. Their feeling is that
the net nets that actually did well when purchased as part of a broad
diversified portfolio of them were the ones that had horribly negative earnings
rather than positive earnings, and that had business models that didn't seem
viable. This makes sense, because net net is really a proxy for a form of
liquidating value, and becomes least relevant in an operating company that is
expected to continue to run forever. Nevertheless, Jim and I and others here
have had success picking up operating companies with decent futures and decent
stories at less than 2/3 net net. Hence, inevitably we will each just have to
reach our own conclusions given the available personal anecdote and evidence.

company. Just see it more as a moderately undervalued security rather than a
deeply discounted one. Don't get carried away on that 53% EPS growth.
Long-term, this isn't a 50% grower.

And FWIW, my buys/shorts/sells:

Shorting stocks where I can see the bad news confirmed in the numbers.
Amazon.com (short at 82 5/8 again today) is pursuing some creative financing to
get the cash to keep going. Selling euro-dominated bonds follows an Australian
issue follows equity-linked debt follows who knows what.

Exodus (short at 129) is in a capital-intensive business with high start-up
costs and business inputs that have short half-lives. The barriers to entry are
minimal in the long run. Exodus' major shareholders have sold big-time. The
company should be raising its needed additional capital by selling inflated
shares but instead is borrowing $1billion plus at 10%+ rates. Intel is one of
the many targeting this same market.

Pre-Paid Legal (short at 24 3/4) I've gone through before (I shorted it from
$37ish down to 24ish last year). Cash flow continues to lag far behind reported
net income, membership retention stinks, and the CEO is engaging in borderline
stock promotion while he steadily sells. Many in the investor community
misunderstand this stock.

Bought Sara Lee, now trading at an EV/EBITDA of just over 8, and with return on
capital greater than 25%. Management's initiatives to maximize return on
capital and follow an EVA-type strategy over the last few years have been
successful, and the company has been buying back stock with its tremendous cash
flow. Its debt is rated AA-. Solid, defensive stock in an industry given no
respect by the market.

Bought Hasbro in addition to my Mattel. Hasbro is another one with an EV/EBITDA
just over 8. Tremendous brand equity and a good future strategy, IMO, with its
games.com. On the Buffettology thread early last year I made a strenuous
argument against Mattel and pointed out Hasbro's better record of return on
investment. Well now they're both so cheap I'm in both of them.

Sold Philip Morris (MO) as it makes new lows.

Re: EBSC there was this discussion about operating leases that added some $15

Hard to swallow? Yes. These are repeated gut checks for any value investor.
I've been using Enterprise Value/EBITDA with a maximum of 6 as one of my
criteria. Wow. When you hold one of these at 6 and then see the ratio fall to
3, it is indeed hard to swallow. Especially when, like me, you usually don't
take new lows lightly but this time prided yourself on the fundamental value.

But you don't have to buy a high-flyer. That's just a lack of discipline. May I
suggest that any regular here, if ever tempted, try to justify buying a
high-flyer here first before buying? Without discipline, long-term, you might
as well just buy a mutual fund or hire a money manager. Because 99% of people
are undisciplined investors, and 100% of them will be part of the 99.9% of
investors that fail to achieve superior long-term gains. There's just no point.

Myself, I'm starting to see a lot of Buffett-like stocks laying around. This is
a change from when I had to buy a lot of cigar butts, cyclicals, and
decent-companies-at-a-discount the last few years. This is a switch from my
version of Graham-like investing to my version of Buffett-like investing. I
sold Crane and bought Liz Claiborne. That's my first switcharoo. Looking to
make more in the coming weeks and months.

BTW, sold Mattel today; I was suspicious and started looking for an exit when
the numbers came out. Now S&P's debt downgrade nicely summarized my suspicions.
I'm outta there. This is a good example of a free S&P debt report detailing the
magnitude of the troubles better than any retail stock report.

Need some accounting help:

In several recent stocks I've been looking at (Equifax, Dun & Bradstreet) it
appears that there have been huge charge-offs against equity due to foreign
currency translation as a result of depreciating foreign currencies relative to
the dollar. I'm no exactly sure how to interpret and value this, especially as
respect to cash flow analysis and cash return on equity/cash return on capital
calculations. Does it show up in cash flows? If not, is it becuase the profits
are made in foreign locales and largely stay in foreign locales for
reinvestment so it is really more of just an accountant's trick to bring
everything into US dollars? I'd appreciate any clarity that can be offered.

This makes sense. You buy some of your equity (a balance sheet item of course)
in a foreign currency. Then you suffer a 2:1 devaluation of that currency
relative to your native currency. That portion of your equity is halved. It
shows up in the reconciliation of equity, and in the adjustments to net income
if the company is progressive about accepting the FASB ruling on the subject.
But that adjustment doesn't show up in the standard reported P&L. It's just in
the notes to the financial statements.

So where is it in cash flows? Well you've already spent the money on acquiring
that equity. That equity is now halved in value. But then the cash was already
spent. So cash flow isn't affected. So it is an illuminating but potentially
irrelevant accounting maneuver. For instance, if Equifax from here on operates
in Brazil cash-flow positive, all the maneuver does is hyperinflate true return
on equity.

The adjustment I was referring to was really just balance sheet-based. As far
as ongoing expenses and revenues of the enterprise, then that is dependent on
changes in the currency exchange rate in the future. Basically, though, my
question is answered for these foreign-currency adjustments to equity: no
effect on cash flow, keep it in invested capital, and make sure to add it back
in as an equity-equivalent.

Right?

Like Wayne and Jim, I've felt tinges of the insanity this market's dissociative

outrageous comparisons. Infuriating. And unlike Wayne and Jim, I've been plain
stupid with some of my trading. The insanity has driven me from mumblings to my
wife in the car and in bed to actual point-and-click trades that I would never
have done had I had a brain.

But then, PG is now only becoming fairly priced. Same really goes for PEP. I
mean, if we are expecting 1970's Washington Post-type or 1986 Coke-type Buffett
bargains, these things need to be halved again. The S&P Index buying drove many
of these "buy what you know" stocks way too high, and it will the S&P Index
selling that will drive them way too low. I think some patience is still in
order. I'm not buying them yet. Same goes for the drugs - another big S&P 500
component that is only now getting fairly priced after 50% haircuts.

Hey, if we get thousands of swings and thousands of "take-backs" then so-called
"start-up positions" in some of these might be warranted. But these aren't the

Re: ANF, I've watched it fall since it hit 40. Around 20, I thought really
hard. Went to a store. Turned around and walked out immediately. Too trendy.

And therein is the key to its high ROE/ROA. It has been "in" fashion. The
problem with all these chains is that they can fall out of fashion. ANF is a
century-old name that decided to get trendy in 94-95. It has worked. But the
problem is the survivability of the trend and concept. So I discount the
ROE/ROA numbers very severely. Especially when I think how hard those numbers
will get hit in a recession.

That said, I think the company is no Merry Go Round. It produces cash at or
above earnings each quarter. The clothes are attractive, and if I could afford
them I'd like to own some. Management has really thumbed its nose at Wall
Street, which I like. They appeared to be very focused on the long-term, and
are terse with the Street out of spite for the Street's short-term focus. But
then this last fall they go and have an illegal private analysts' meeting that
basically blows any proof of this theory out of the water (along with the stock
price).

That all said, I am buying ANF. Not in the portfolio I run so visibly on my web
site - yet. But in several other portfolios. In the 11-12 range, I feel there
is a bottom. My interest perked when the stock jumped on two downgrades.
Finally, the downgrades came. My wife was the one who alerted me: "You always
say wait for the downgrades. Well, they came."

The company is miniscule relative to something like the Gap and has much room
to grow in terms of store numbers. It also may benefit from Gap's fashion
missteps for all I know. For now, the earnings yield just seems to great to
pass up. Especially with a growing coupon.

Today, I did buy Symantec as my first pure tech holding since Oracle and Apple.
Only in one of my portfolios, in which the owner wants to be more aggressive.
But I did buy it. The reason I am attracted to it is that they are not only a
growing tech company at a reasonable multiple well below their 5-year
sustainable growth rate, but like my Apple and Oracle picks last year, they are
not being recognized for two big things:
1)Many still think of Norton Utilities and its second-banana Antivirus product.
It has expanded into much more than that, and dominantly. There is much growth
left and it is not Y2K or PC dependent. It doesn't seem that this is priced
into the stock, for whatever reason.
2)Cost controls at the company are excellent. The company is just about the
only tech player in Silicon Valley who does not think money is water to be
thrown on every fire. Very little excess. The company works from a tight
working capital base, keeping minimal inventories and tight credit with
customers.

After I bought, the company beat estimates by 10 cents. I was hoping it would
fall lower so I could get a chance to add it in some other portfolios, but it
does not look like that will happen. Here's hoping for another Nasdaq crash.

Chilly,

Welcome to the thread. I didn't buy EBSC for its growth. It may grow 10%, but
not consistently, and not using its capital efficiently. In fact, investors
have reacted negatively any time the company does something that indicates it
will continue as a going concern, much less grow.

There were investors who bought a big chunk. The company is clearly
undervalued, but it is not a good company in terms of management or use of
assets. As you know, there has been some theorizing that there will be
shareholder maneuver to get the company to create more value for its
shareholders. A Barron's article helped that out.

The fact that it was a net net helped give this argument some bite here on the
Value Investing thread. So I and others here bought. I brought up the issue of
the huge operating lease liability. How it made it not a net net - possibly a
problem for all net net retailers. There was some debate about this. To me,
after some thought, I figured that this issue destroyed my reason for owning
the stock. Others argued that EBSC's operating leases might be considered
assets, for all we know, and hence should be held as a wash.

Of course, I still find that hard to swallow, so I say, well maybe I really
should ignore the operating lease liability, but at any rate I thought "this is
a growing, cash-generating company trading at around net net value." So I held
onto it.

To me, it was a poor decision. I confused the "net net with a catalyst"
strategy with a "cash flow/growth" strategy and ended up violating a rule I try
to remember: to get out when the reason I bought becomes or is realized to be
no longer valid.

Today, I switched my EBSC out at a small loss - even though I agree it does
appear very undervalued. Used the very same cash to buy ANF at 11 1/8 - the
same price Jim got, it turns out. I might have continued to hold, but I really
wanted to buy ANF after it fell today, and one of my retail/apparel stocks had
to go. LIZ ain't going anywhere. Same with Ross Stores. I'd rather have the
better business.

Yeah, but I think the market is right in that you have to look at manufactured
housing separate from the site-built home industry (stock prices of the two
groups don't fluctuate together). Clayton's average home price is about $42,000
- they are really competing, and very competitive with, rental prices for
apartments. It is the low-rent part of the housing industry. The MH industry's
loans have been considered sub-prime since last year, and financing has
tightened up drastically. Demand has already taken a significant hit since
early 99. Of course, there is room for more hits. But then you see that 44% of
Clayton's income is recurring, and that its business of scrubbing loan
portfolios for resale makes up over half of operating income, and at least in
my eyes, they are appropriately positioned to weather any further hits to
demand. In any case, the supply adversity and further potential demand
adversity is already factored into the price. The conference call is published
on their web site and is a must-hear for potential investors.

With CNF, it is a company that never really took off stock-wise throughout this
economic boom. IMO it came from the top.

GATX (GMT) Corp just sold most of its stake in its Logistics division. This is
another interesting piece in their valuation tale. The stock jumped on the
news, which tells me that someone out there knows something about what was
paid. Logistics is part of the Integrated Solutions group, which had 600M in
revenue and contributed just 6 million to income. The IS group also includes
its terminals business. First comes a sale of two terminals for a seemingly
overpriced 115M. Then comes this sale of most of Logistics. So you have a part
of the business that contributes little in income, so is having its asset value
realized in bits and pieces. I bet Buffett did the calculations about what
those bits and pieces that would be sold were worth before he invested. Plus,
they have their GATX Capital group to invest their cash appropriately. Still

it's in the 60's. The thing is, they sold 2 million shares to Janus at 210 when
things were high. They were one of the very few genomics concerns to get the
deal done when the things were hot. Their burn rate is 30M this year, a little
less next year, then back to profits after a brief hiatus. They are a real
company with a growing off balance sheet intellectual property asset.

There's over $20 (>$600M) in cash on the balance sheet, and the company just
guaranteed itself it won't run out of cash (at Janus' expense)before their
royalties start flowing. This is not easy to model, but I am getting a feel for
a margin of safety. At 60 I would buy, but at 69 I'm within 15%, and I usually
am ok buying a smaller position within 20% of my target.

That SVR/timeshare analysis is under the Articles section of my
http://www.valuestocks.net site, for anyone who keeps seeing SVR pop up on
their screens and is interested. Click on May 1999 Pick of the Month - I gave
it a guarded positive analysis with a lot of if's. Then it was trading around
7.5, and now it's in the 4's. I think we can blame the intricate (deceptive?)
finances, the poor repute of the industry ("everyone knows you lose money in
those seedy timeshare deals"), limited organic growth prospects ("if it's not
really growing, ignore it"), and that big fat majority ownership that makes it
unlikely any takeover would happen. Frankly, there have been other stocks that
look more attractive to me (possibly for the reasons above).

Paul, I absolutely agree. Part of value investing for most people is
experiencing that initial dip after the buy. In my style, I've analyzed when
this happens, and why. It appears that it nearly always happens when I haven't
let proper support develop under the stock at a given price. You asked a
question a bit back "Why does X keep making new lows." The answer is "Because
it keeps making new lows." I'd say 99 times out of 100 a new low will be
followed by another new low.

Lancaster Colony fundamentally looks great. I don't know about where you live,
but here Girard's and T. Marzetti's seem to be taking off. Looking at the
chart, it is plain as day that it is downtrending and just broke what support
it had to make new lows. Because the fundamentals looked so great, I bought in
anyway. And now I'm experiencing that initial dip. Happens nearly every time.
It seems there is a better way, but died-in-the-wool value investors won't
consider it.

That died-in-the-wool part of me, as much as it helps my fundamental analysis
of a security, not uncommonly makes me do irrational things with my capital
when it comes to the timing of the purchase.

Scott, my global strategy is not changing. I try to buy near support and sell
when support is broken (i.e. new lows), so that lends itself to high turnover,
which I defended in an article on my site.

Recently I ventured a buy of INCY at 69 and the next day or so it was 82. I
sold it figuring there were other values, or I would buy INCY back. It fell to
73 where I bought again.When it hit 66 I bought some more. Now I intend to hold
it. That is one volatile stock, and it is hard not to take money off the table
when given to you, since chances are if it is given quickly it will be taken
back quickly. It is hard to shake the "I should be holding on like a good value
investor" mentality though. After buying at 73 it shot to 90 in a few days and
I held on for this very reason. Now it's at 71.

Fossil was a fundamental decision - my reason for buying was muddied by their
latest report, which I had trouble reconciling. Abercrombie broke what nascent
support it had developed. So when it went under 10 I was out. We'll see where
it stops. My strategy is simply not to wed myself to a stock, and to always be
open to new information. This is an art, independent of steadfast rules other
than my own, and contributes to high turnover. It doensn't change the type of
fundamental analysis I do before buying.

Re: INCY's business model, there is a salon article under my INCY description
at VSN that details it very well. It's an interview with the CEO. There is just
tremendous misunderstanding here. I don't see the NIH deal as anything close to
INCY giving away the farm. The database subscriptions are not going to be big
money makers. They provide some steady cash flow - enough to keep the company
actually cash flow positive last quarter despite negative GAAP income.
Management has shown itself to be pretty savvy in both finances and operations,
and that salon interview really clarifies a lot of points.

An interesting way to play steels is the graphite electrode business, which is
dominated by one company that currently seems relatively cheap. They have net
negative equity thanks to a huge charge taken against earnings back in 1997,
and continue to to be affected by lawsuits. But they recently restructured
debt, shaving 200 basis points off previous rates, and have announced price
increases. I like their reason:

We continue to see strong order demand for graphite electrodes. We believe that
graphite electrode manufacturing capacity utilization rates in the free trading
markets are approaching the 95%level. We also believe that these high operating
rates are beginning to cause shipment/scheduling difficulties for some of the
other producers. As a result, we have announced a price increase of $150 per
metric ton for graphite electrodes sold in Western Europe, Middle East, North
Africa and Asia Pacific(excluding Japan), effective for all orders booked on or
after April 3, 2000.

Mario Gabelli has had several of his investment arms buy decent stakes, and
there is a good amount of insider buying. All this occurred at prices above
recent prices. Gabelli has not yet invested his own money. I find that when he
does that, usually a bottom is near. But I'm likely to take a position in UCR
anyway due to their pricing power and misunderstood/hard to understand
financials.

Another interesting one to watch (and one Gabelli also owns) is WHX. An early
favorite here on the Value Investing thread, several of us doubled or tripled
our money. Like a good value investment, it has round-tripped back to the 5's.

As you know, I have a simple philosophy: sell on new lows.
There are two reasons for this:
1) Many people do this. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. I try to do it
quicker.
2) If I know something is a fundamental value and it breaks to new lows, the
selling is irrational by definition and I don't want to be in the way of
irrational selling. Better to wait for the buyers to show where they are
willing to step up and give support.

I suffered for several years trying to be stubborn in the face of irrational
selling and all it got me was a lot of 50% haircuts on stocks that had already
been too cheap. One of the biggest lessons I've learned was that PE 8 stocks
can become PE 4 stocks and stay that way for a long time. AT&T's long-distance
business is getting close to trading for 1X EBITDA, yet everyone looks at it
like this big albatross around T's neck. Maybe in the future I'll get the
long-distance biz for free. All we need is another $15 billion in lost market
cap.

That said, I love your rhetorical questions. Why do you think AT&T is getting

I'll post my outrage just as I did last year. It makes a joke of value managers
of concentrated funds trying to make a representative showing at mid-year. Last
year it spiked my returns irrationally, dooming the third quarter. This year it
decimates the returns irrationally. I'm sure it will come out in the wash, but
it doesn't help for marketing. I congratulate you, Jim, on being awake and
tuned in when it happened. I signed in right on the market close (I guess I had
thought with Thursday's strong showing I had little to worry about - if
anything, the spike would be up) and couldn't believe my eyes. And why it would
deteriorate so much further AFTER the market close is beyond me. Actually, I
can understand the mechanism, but I don't understand why someone hasn't fixed
the mechanism so this doesn't happen. All I can say is that as I begin my
professional money management life, it would sure help if now these stocks
would stay this low for the next month or so. Let's see if this predicts a good
showing for tech stocks in the third quarter, just as last year's mid year
close predicted a tech slump in the third quarter.

Craig,

I wouldn't go far as to say shorts are not part of a value investing strategy.
To each his own, but one might argue that with bonds providing a weak
counterweight to stocks over the last few decades, hedging with shorts might be
something Graham would have considered by now had he been alive. He definitely
was into market timing, and it wouldn't surprise me to learn that he felt that
shorts had a place in a rich market as a hedge against a majority long equity
position. And re: Paul's remark about hedging and shorts never coming up, I
submit that Graham's Bonds/Equity 25/50/25 theory was meant to be the
equivalent of a mild hedge strategy. As for me, I've come out ahead on my
shorts over the years, but I much favor longs, and in a fairly priced or evem
overpriced market will still overwhelming favor longs.

BTW, I think it is ridiculous to say that one must lose nearly all one's money
to have gained experience. I don't recall Buffett losing all his money at any
given point. And I don't see where 30 years experience is any better than 5
years; the person matters much more.

HOLD ON

About this "experience" issue and notches in the belt, what a crutch. The two
are not equivalents.

Buffett did not live through the Depression, but somehow was able to anticipate
and profit from the 1970s. His returns have been steadily the same in the 1990s
as in the 1950s. I don't recall in any of what's written about him that he
claims the 1970s - the market's gyrations - made him a better investor. In
fact, I don't recall this argument being made by any of the value strategists
that I admire.

I will give that experience may be measured in years. But for any person to
claim that he/she is somehow a better investor - or to belittle another
investor - because of this experience is ridiculous, petty, and ignorant.
Evidently age is not certain to confer at least one quality - the ability to
differentiate between population-based generalization and individual outcomes.

This will inevitably become a battle between the young and the old. After all,
how can an older investor not take comfort that his 40-50 years of experience
is somehow better than 10 years of experience? And how can someone with 10
years of experience not think that the 10 years mean something? That would take
an incredible amount of self-invalidation that is generally not humanly
possible. Certainly if one lost a lot of money in the early 70's, then
self-invalidating those dues would be even less humanly possible.

But Paul and Jeffrey, you should be ashamed of your snide and snooty smears on
the ages of contributors here. You two should have more self-control and
self-awareness. Part of that awareness should be that there are indeed people
who can adapt, learn, and apply better than you. Believe it! Time in the market
does not qualify you to stand at the top of the mountain, and pushing others
down exposes yourselves and creates an environment where you too will be pushed
down. It is all extremely unproductive.

And the younger contributors might want to consider not touting their
experience, as it will most surely not measure up to some of the older members'
experience, and will invite ridicule, whether deserved or not. Let the
arguments, ideas, and strategies stand on their own. On those, we will be
rightly open to attack. But at least the personal angle will not have been
introduced.

I've appreciated the insights of Senior and Bash when it comes to analysis and
strategy points. But the overly confrontational and too-personal tone reflects
their surnames too often, is not necessary and is one of the major reasons this
thread has been criticized as too clubby. A newbie gets at most two strikes,
and I'm sure a few have browsed the thread only to not post because of the
personal attack that sometimes greets certain posts.

I will forever remember Paul's welcome message to me - to the thread that I
started:
"You're a doctor, ipso facto a lousy investor."
What a neat but perfectly ignorant and completely unproductive judgement. Can
we keep this stuff to a minimum?

Congrats on the ANF. I would like to bring to this thread's attention that GATX
is announcing it will sell its Terminals division. In my web site analysis
justifying my buy, I had said,

"There are a lot of assets ripe for shedding (as indicated by the $115 million
being paid for just two of its tens of terminals) as well as potential for high
returns in certain operating segments (especially Capital). This company needs
capital allocation expertise, and if it didn't have it before, it has it in
spades now."

I was referring to Buffett jumping two-feet-first on board. Terminals includes
many terminals owned outright -at least 15 in the US - and several significant
statkes in international ones that bring its total to at least 34 terminals.
They also own 4 pipelines, and they own, not lease, the significant amount of
land related to all this. Now it's for sale.

The question is what is left? We'll have to see what all this goes for, but
this could drastically reshape the balance sheet and place a load of capital in
the hands of the master allocator. There's even a vehicle already existing
within the company, Capital, that is growing at least 15 years and has
interests in telecommunications.
GATX Rail and the steamship company are both still there too.

He owns a bunch of the company, and whether he says he's hands off or not, I
see the companies he buys develop better ratios and returns and cash-generating
ability AFTER he buys them. It could be he is just sitting back and letting his
predictions move in on target. But extrapolating Lowenstein's account of the
man tells me he is more activist with his public holdings than other sources
have led us to believe. SO while I'm not suggesting that he will be handling
the venture arm direcly, I would say that a billion+ in freed-up capital will
garner a word or two from him. The venture arm has been growing and adding some
seasoned leaders. There's clearly a plan to maximize shareholder returns afoot,

My understanding is that Buffett handles the supercat float, namely National
Indemnity, among others (namely Gen Re), while Simpson handles the GEICO float.
According to the latest filing, GEICO and its subsidiaries own 5.9% of GATX.
Berskhire Hathaway through National Indemnity appears to own 14.9%. There's a
difference there - 9% absolute - that I'm attributing to Buffett. I have never
heard nor read that Lou Simpson stretches outside of GEICO to manage
Berkshire's other float.

Moreover, there is a similar arrangement for Dun & Bradstreet (14.9% for
National Indemnity reported, then 4.9% for GEICO) and I know that there were
comments on DNB at the annual meeting from the chieftans themselves. Pretty
specific too. Why would they pay less attention to a stake in GATX, especially
when the fundamentals of the investments (unlocking value by corporate action)
are so similar?

I could be mistaken, as the ways of Buffett are never entirely clear.
Nevertheless, it appears that GATX has had a fire lit under it since Berkshire
took a stake. Sold off 81% of its Logistics and now will sell off 100% of its
Terminals, both pieces that have great asset and strategic values but generate
little in operating profit. We're getting left with the cash-generating
machines of the company and the investment arm.

Whatever the reason, the investment is panning out for the reasons I bought it.

Wallace, you have a difficult task. There are no good value benchmarks. There
are benchmarks. S&P Barra. Russell. You could even use the Vanguard or Schwab
Value Index funds for un-managed but more realistic performance. BUT all these
do is take the slowest growing, most depressed big-caps and through them
togetther. I think most value investors would agree that there is not much
reason to call that value investing.

Your best bet is to pick some active managers in the value category and pit
them against your manager. Say Legg Mason Focus Trust. Say Third Avenue Value.
Say Tweedy Browne. Say
Sequoia. There's a bunch of them. Maybe you can take an average of 10 or so of
these over different time periods.

I just use the S&P 500 to benchmark myself. The simple reason is that it is by
far the easiest, cheapest index to invest in, and it has shown its ability to
pound into the ground just about every mutual fund manager out there over time.
And you're just as likely to find a correlation with what true value investors
do as you are by picking a big so-called value index.

To me benchmark means alternative. Any number of active managers, individually
or as a group, could be. But then
of course you get into past performance issues and that
whole mess...Good luck.

why "in a period that profits and revenue are growing and strong, why can they

quarter?" 

Bob, you hit on the primary reason I'm not in the home builders. Looking at the
cash flows of the few companies I was intereste in led me to the same question.
It wasn't always negative, but it was never big enough for me to think it would
not become so significantly negative during a downturn as to wipe out the small
positive during the boom time. Net zero or net negative over the cycle.

I thought there might be a dynamic that I did not understand. And could not
understand. How comfortable for me to know that DHOM's CFO is in the same boat.

1. New lows rule - gotta abide by it.
2. The market has been very good at ferreting out info on this company. When
the stock falls, reasons seem to emerge later. The market is all over anything
to do with Ameriserve, and since Ameriserve represents a fairly significant
risk - as evidenced by the $72 million charge that didn't resolve anything just
last quarter - I am willing to let the market tell me a thing or two with this
stock.
3. I've been in and around this stock for 2 1/2 years, and it is not doing what
I thought it would. I recall one successful long-term investor who said he
gives up after 3 years because no matter how right he thinks he is, he has
never had reason to regret selling a go-nowhere stock at 3 years. I'm making it
2 1/2. This would be my second one, but I don't regret selling my first one -
Deswell. It is possible that Clayton and Senior Housing may be the third and
fourth, but there's a good year and a half on them yet.

Now, these are all technical reasons. My fundamental investment thesis, as I
detailed it over 2 1/2 years ago, remains intact. The company has done all the
right fundamental things that I thought it would do. But fundamental analysis
is only a majority of my process, a process where unanimity is required. I wish
I could get you up to speed, but there is really nothing blatantly new - except
the market telling us something has gone wrong that we don't know about yet.
Advertising turmoil, lack of organic growth, Ameriserve, Ameriserve,
Ameriserve. Those are the likely culprits. I'll find out from the sidelines.

I would guess the exceptions to the 3 year rule would be tech companies - for
many obvious reasons. I would also
guess that it would still hold for slower-growing, more
traditional companies.

And ALSC tripped my sell point - I'm out already. It may go up, but I've vowed
never again to cling to a falling knife. There are plenty of other
opportunities out there.

Jurgis, I'm holding too. The market capitalization lost today exceeds the
dilution even if SYMC just threw the stock away. I see the obvious synergies,
and this is a real company with good products. It's not value-priced, but it's
not 450 million for a company with nothing but a promise, either.

As an aside, I woke up to it this morning. My wife turns CNBC on first thing,
and I hear "Axent up.....Symantec..."
And before I even heard the price, I was swearing cuz I know there's not much
faith in Symantec out there. I'm putting my money behind Thompson though.

Yeah, but unfortunately ALSC's stock value depends on industry valuations,
owing to the fact that a good part of the value is an inflated portfolio that
can't be sold because the company has no plant of its own. Looking at history,
the market values ALSC largely on this portfolio probably because of the lack
of plant. I don't agree with this, but try as I might, the operations are not
worth the current price either. The absolute risk low but not zero, and in any
case technically the thing looks headed to $14. I can wait. It's nothing
personal against the stock (or you - I still think it was a good pick), but if
I can get it at $14, then that's nearly 50% just back to here.

I'll second CAT, and Jim's Huttig (which comes courtesy of Jim's Crane). I've
bought both. Can't bring myself to second WPO, though maybe twister or Warren
Buffett can.

But the purpose of this post is Senior Housing, a stock that I proposed and was
discussed not so long ago. Today they did something very significant. They sold
Brookfield. That's their best property holding, with the best tenants and best
lease terms (for SNH). My initial reaction was "Oh crap." But it looks like FFO
by my calculations will only dip about 1.5-2 mill thanks to saved interest
expense, and the dividend is still well-covered by the only slightly-less rock
solid Marriot leases.

But this telegraphed some other positives. One, management is not simply
inflating assets. A worry was that they would not sell assets when prudent to
pay down debt, as they get paid based on a % of assets. Here we have a loss of
assets. That tells me management is doing right by shareholders to a large
degree, and makes me more comfortable.

Second, the properties were sold for about 20% more than the price paid by SNH.
The Marriott properties sit up at $325 million paid by SNH, or thereabouts. The
market cap of SNH now is $217.8 million plus what will be only a little over
$55M in debt. There are also a few other properties but I don't need a
calculator to find the margin of safety here. It's big. And the dividend still
seems safe.

Third, Senior Housing may actually be able to realize some value for
shareholders. If management is willing to sell assets - as I said, not
necessarily an expected attitude - then Senior Housing may realize more gains,
keeping the Marriott properties to pay the dividend.

Good Investing,
Mike

"Sure 14 is an even better price than 20. but I tried to do something like that
with Ortel and it turned right around and went up 20 points in an hour and boy
was I sorry."

I won't be sorry - I'll be glad that it worked out for you. Meanwhile, I'll be
hoping CAT or Huttig or Carnival or Horace Mann are working out for me.

I came to about $43 for ALSC as well. I read Prudential's report too, and I
made different assumptions but came to the same basic end price. Already,
though, the portfolio valuation is outdated (and too high). Of course, it
doesn't matter if there is faith in the underlying valuations of the holdings.
BTW, did you notice how PMC-Sierra popped up in the Safe Harbor for last
quarter? I wonder when ALSC took a stake in them, and at what price?

You're aware that ALSC is limited in the amount of Chartered and UMC that it
may divest, right?
UMC made another new low today.

Anyway, safe harbor is just the disclaimer at the end of all company statements
that is supposed to alleviate shareholder suits in the future. Large equity
positions are often disclosed in them. The most recent quarter's safe harbor
listed PMCS for the first time.

I am not exactly arguing, because I understand and believe he can do it, but
just turning that which can be freed up into venture capital does not create
any additional margin of safety, IMO. I'm trying to be realistic about this,
but the real reality is I'll buy it again at $14 because I believe management
of ALSC is indeed capable, as you suggest.

And you don't sell Amazon five months before Christmas. 

I thought about how to reply to this, and it was a tie:

1) No, you sell it when it makes new lows (hint, hint)
2) Christmas? What's so attractive about bigger losses?

I kinda like the first one better, but I think the
second expresses a certain je ne sais pas.

OK, so it's contrarian, but it is also one of the most visible, over-analyzed
stocks by pros and amateurs alike. Where's my advantage in understanding
Amazon.com? Quest for Value's an interesting book, but I still don't see the
margin of safety in an option, at least as I define a margin of safety. More
likely, a diversified portfolio of these sorts of companies may indeed provide
the few rockets that offset or more than offset the ones that go to zero. So
you then have a margin of safety in the portfolio. But I don't see the margin
of safety in an individual Z, precisely because you are projecting based on
many assumptions that have no fundamental basis in past reality, and because
you do not have infinite time for the security to come around - after all, it
is an option in that regard. And in Amazon.com's case, a debt-laden one at
that.

I think you'd have to balance the tendency to want to buy without driving to
the store with the tendency to wander into the nearest bookstore and buy on
impulse when out shopping. My impression of the book business is that it is
still primarily an impulse buy business. Sometimes I have the discipline to
say, ok, just wait and get home and buy it from Amazon. Other times I don't.
Just as you, I believe there are lots of others just like me. The question on
Amazon is it really worth more than the Washington Post and any number of other
companies with market caps under 10 billion. I can't predict Amazon's future to
a T, but I can see that there are other, cheaper and safer stocks out there.

To answer whether this is a good business (and not just apparently cheap based
on traditional superficial measures) I coincidentally just did a new return on
capital calc on WCOM today, based on its latest results. Largely, I go by Stern
and Stewart's version when doing this. In terms of earning cost of capital,
Worldcom is doing a poor job.

In fact, it is not earning its cost of capital. After accounting for past
pooling acquisitions, and breaking down Worldcom's cash flows, I figure the
company is going to earn, optimistically, $8 billion in cash earnings on
invested cash thus far somewhat above $90 billion. Even looking ahead and
taking analysts estimates into consideration, I'm seeing at best a 10% return
here and hence WCOM is not earning whatever its cost of capital may be - I'm
estimating at least 12%.

Right now, it trades above its capital even though it is not earning the cost
of its capital. Not good. This may change as WCOM finds a way to leverage its
investment into further profits down the road. The latest quarterly report
provides a hint of this. But it has said it will have massive capital
expenditures in the future - and current cash levels imply additional
borrowings to do it. All this will dilute returns further.

I think with T and WCOM, we'd have to find a way to analyze the current levels
of investment and somehow come to a conclusion that future earnings will grow
quite significantly off this base alone. One wonders what degree of empire
building is going on - what is motivating management? Right now, T seems to
have the greatest potential because of its cable assets, but it is potential.
Management has to execute. Plans to spin off or merge with BT tell me that
management is responding to the wrong inputs right now. Ebbers' Sprint plan
told me he is responding to the wrong inputs as well.

I also grabbed some SPOR today. At 3 1/4, a no-brainer. Interesting price
action. I changed my bid 3 times, and the bid changed to reflect it each time.
Certainly don't buy it at market.

You held CCN? Bongo for you! That was a good buy, and a timely exit. Congrats.
I range-traded that and gave up. Looked like a good move for about a year.

Following up on my examination of Worldcom, I concluded that Worldcom would
have to start showing it didn't need more acquisitions. Its acquisitions to
date seem to have been borne of empire-building rather than shareholder reward.
And the market is knocking it down drastically on news of its latest
acquisition. Certainly it appears that the "story" phase for the stock is over,
and the proving time has begun. But Worldcom is still trying to finish the
story. I'm still staying away.
