STAR(Lone Star), BOST(Boston Chicken(Market))...These 2 restaurants are
surprisingly similar in their numbers. Prospect look good for both as well.
I've just taken a position in BOST through their convertible security which is
trading in the low 70's, provides a good YTM and excellant chances for Cap

Does anyone think the Video Tape Rental Industry will survive? I've been
following a company, West Coast Entertainment (WCEC, which is the 3rd largest
video rental chain. After Blockbuster had problems, they they cancelled a bond
offering and the shares have languished. I would like to learn how to value
this company to determine whether I am missing something. The P/E is about 7,
and the sales per share is about $8. They recently went public within the last
year. The reason I'm interested in the company is that I like the Videosmith
unit in the Boston area, which does as good if not better than Blockbuster.
Also, the # 2 player in the industry, Holywood Entertainment trades at a p/e of
36. If anyone can give me some suggestions as to better value the stock, your
assistance would be greatly appreciated. I am concerned as many value investors
often are, thate there is some information or issue they have not looked at
when reviewing a company.

Greg Palkon: Re: WCEC. Talk about catching a falling knife! Nothing but down on
that stock. Here's what you might check out (pun):

There's a WCEC thread which I would assume you've already looked at. Mr. Jim
Hopkins has posted here about VUPDA (Check out the VUPDA thread).

VUPDA vs. WCEC

P/bk .7 vs. .3
p/e 13 vs. 6
psr .7 vs. .3

Using Yahoo... which I've not had much confidence in lately... WCEC looks good,
but there is this matter...

ROA 4.5% vs. 3.6%
debt/eq 0 vs. .4

Also, at my first glance, VUPDA looks like it is, or might be pretty close in
size to WCEC in terms of stores (depending on how one counts franchises?). I
don't think the video rental biz is going away. Seems like there's industry
consolidation; maybe nobody can make a profit with all the competition. Did I
read somewhere that it is WCEC who are doing the unconventional (and being
successful) by opening stores in the "best" locations... even if those stores
are right next to Blockbuster stores?
Based on my 10 min. with WCEC, it seems like it could be of interest to value
players.Paul Senior

Seems to be reverse story with me. No broker acknowledgement of trade Fri or

Sorry about the last thank you letter that provided little info. WCEC owns
particular segments, such as Videosmith in Boston, which have always been
around and has done well against Blockbuster. I suggest you write WCEC to get
an info. packet. They seem to have a decent game plan. After speaking to a
manager at the local Videosmith, I asked him about Blockbuster and its
troubles. His reply was that Blockbuster's enormous size prevents it from
evolving with the local niche for particular movies. I might add that he was
critical of WCEC's management, which he believed did not give enough power to
the local store managers to purchase the movies that will rent. Of course, you
now understand why Hollywood wants to keep these rental stores operating, so
that they can play around with the movies they push to the rental companies. It
looks like some kind of accounting thing at work here. For what its worth, WCEC
had a huge volume trading last week but the stock moved little. It looked like
a huge block exchanged hands, since one day last week over a million shares
changed hands on little news, and the stock usually trades on a volume of a
couple thousand shares per day.

On August 19th, Touchstone Applied Science (NASDAQ:TASA)
announced that, as the result of two recent acquisitions, third quarter
revenues had increased by an impressive 261%. Operating income for
the quarter had grown to $299 thousand from a prior year loss of $42
thousand.

This is a Summary of a complete Analysis of TASA which can be
found on The Napeague Letter web site at:
http://www.napeague.com

This rapid growth is the result of increasing demand for the
Company's core products and two recently completed acquisitions
which strategically reinforce this product line. Unfortunately,
extraordinary one-time writeoffs associated with these acquisitions
have created a substantial loss for the recently-announced quarter, but
the Company has indicated that an earnings rebound is anticipated in
the next quarter.

TASA offers its customers a very impressive core product line - a
series of sophisticated standardized reading tests and supporting tools.

Its "Degrees of Reading Power" tools "determine how well a
student reads under real-life conditions in and out of school",
and a more advanced version "extend this definition of
comprehension by assessing how well students are able to
reason with textual materials."

The companion "Degrees of Word Meaning" tests "assess the
size of students reading vocabularies by measuring their
understanding of the meaning of words in naturally occurring
contexts".

There is strong evidence that indicates that these tools are dramatic
improvements over those offered by competitors. These measurement
tools are very well accepted by educators at all levels, and are even
used at the college level, by universities such as Old Dominion and
Purdue.

In addition, the Company has just made two acquisitions which appear
to make sense; they were completed at the right price and they both fit
into TASA's core business. Since this basic industry is highly
fragmented, if TASA maintains a sufficiently strong balance sheet, it
can make additional beneficial acquisitions, especially if its stock price
rises to reflect its underlying value. As a result, TASA could continue
to grow quite rapidly.

As an investment, TASA may appear to be higher risk than those
stocks normally analyzed by The Napeague Letter, as it currently
trades around $.60 per share. However, its market value is well below
most measures of the stock's intrinsic value, and the Company has
recently bolstered its investor relations efforts.

Unfortunately TASA has not yet released its 10-Q Report for the third
quarter, and I am thus not able to fully analyze these results, or to
develop a credible projection for the next twelve months. As soon as
this Report becomes available, I will do so and update this Analysis. In
the interim, I am basing my initial valuations of the Company on a
projection of earnings of $.10 per share and a 25% annual growth rate;
both of these assumptions are in line with the recently announced
quarterly results. Based on these assumptions, the valuation tools
normally used by The Napeague Letter give this stock an intrinsic
valuation around $3.00 per share.

As a NASDAQ SmallCap Market stock, TASA will be affected by the
recently modified requirements for continued listing. However, the
stock appears to be in compliance with all of these requirements with
the exception of market price, and it has six months in which to bring
itself into complete compliance. As a result, I am not concerned about
the possibility that it might be delisted.

It appears that my confidence in TASA is shared by its management
since there has been a substantial amount of insider buying during the
last several months. According to Form 4s filed with the Securities &
Exchange Commission, in late June a member of the Board of
Directors purchased 42,000 shares and in July the Chairman and one
of the Company's Vice Presidents purchased a total of almost 41,000
shares.

Paul,

Had to withdraw bid for NWLIA and likely won't be putting it back on. I will be
tracking for later reference because it is a good equity growth stock that
should appreciate 14% or better. Figuring it's equity growth and wouldn't have
taxes until sold, it has a lot of value to those in higher tax brackets. I
currently am in a sub S corp that's giving me some tax write-offs for this year
and next so I'm looking for quicker and higher gains than NWLIA would yield.

The JWC info is there, but you have to look for it. They were BB until they
were listed on AMEX in May.

You go from one extreme to another. NWLIA is about as safe and APM about as
volatile and unpredictable as you can get.

You're messing with the Pros. APM has got more shorts, puts, calls, options,
and every other play they can think of influencing the price. This is why I
stayed away before (and missed a quick 20% gain).

I got out of techs after 1st Q earnings and am staying out except I do have a
small holding (1K) of FLSHF.

Got into NH at a good time. Has already moved up 3/8. Funds will be taking a
look at this one. It hasn't been listed very long. With the new money from the
stock issue, they should start major growth in developing nations. Already
strong in S.A. and starting in China. I bought on impulse, but think I made a

Ha! For me, both stocks are similar in that I can see them both selling at 50%
higher in 24, maybe 36 months. For NWLIA the earnings seem steady and slow. For
APM, the challenge for me is to: not succumb to the hype and hysteria on the
APM thread, keep objective in focus, not analyze every couple point change in
the stock,or worry about possible customer demand or technology(obsolescence)
threat.
Also in both cases, fundamentals provide some comfort. BV for NWLIA; low pe and
psr for APM (with an expectation that disk drives will continue to sell as more
home computers are installed and more disk space required in homes/offices.)
Also, as you see from my other posts, I am buying these stocks as part of a
portfolio, so I expect to have some winners and losers. No one should copy me
or listen especially to me. I could say at this point to the thread: "do your
own homework"; Ha! Saying that is not my style either. Let somebody else do the
homework!! (It worked in high school, it'll work here -g-) There are some who
do one heck of a good job- Jeff M., James C., Mike, others..... even that
overly self-assured guy with his cockamayme letter and hype has had a coupla
winners (MTY --- I can't believe it!) and Kaneb Svces --good idea in
retrospect- I saw it but didn't buy :>( .
My issue, that I am working on, is that I don't seem to be as open as I'd like
to the suggestions I get on the thread. On the one hand, I am sorry that I miss
a lot of opportunities that I would have liked to have been able to recognize
and gone into. On the other hand, there are great numbers of pitches that come
over the plate (Buffett metaphor), so all I need to do is swing at the ones
that do look good to me. Which I am doing. (Looking to get on base, not
necessarily for a home run.) And I would like to believe others are doing
something similar also... swinging at pitches that they think meet their skills
and requirements. Paul

WHX update. An old favorite on this thread, WHX is a steel company which
survived the longest strike in recent industry history. After six months of
shutdown, the stock got annihilated in April when small caps collapsed, falling
to a low of 5 1/4. The only reason I caught something near this low was that I
had only started to look at it at that time. In other words, luck. I would have
bought this at any time on the way down. At that point, the company was
producing virtually nothing, but had a book value of about $28 a share -
predominantly in cold, hard cash. You don't lose on these.

Fast forward to August. The stock had crept up to 8 or so, and when the strike
was settled, it hit 10. The strike ended and the stock hung around 10 or 11 for
a month or so. Book value is still in the mid to high 20s. A week ago it took
off. Today it hit 14, and I honestly think we're going to see something close
to book value in the near term (~25). When you see momentum in a stock trading
at half of book value, buy, because you know every value investor in the world
is researching it.

(All credit on this one goes to Mike Burry, who posted the initial research in
April, though I know he will humbly deflect the credit to somebody else.)

The stock is going up steadily and it just broke through its 52 week high of 13
and change. Download the financials and study the balance sheet. It is a thing
of beauty to a value investor. If you spend more than 30 seconds on the income
statement you are missing the point, although you should know the company
earned over $2 a share pre strike.

You can take this as a recommendation - I would buy it at 14 if I didn't
already own it. Or you can just take it as a case study in value investing. The
ideas of Ben Graham are not obsolete, and are only "out of style" if you care
about being in style. I care about making money with no risk. When I bought
this stock in April there was absolutely no risk if you were willing to look
out more than six months, and there was an obvious chance for a triple SINCE IT
COULD TRIPLE AND STILL NOT BE NEAR BOOK VALUE. Peter Lynch says buy great
companies. But he made a ton of money loading up on Chrysler when it was on its
deathbed. WHX was the worst company I have ever owned, but by far the best
stock. To clean up another of my thoughts - go ahead and buy dog excrement if
it trades at half the going price for dog excrement. You won't sleep well, but
you will eat well (that's Graham).

WHX showed up on every value investor's screen at 5,6,7... But many were scared
because there was no catalyst and shorts were very vocal. But when a stock is
cheap enough, value is its own catalyst. Many well known value investors would
disagree with me on that point, but I firmly believe it - at least in this
overvalued market.

As long as its not overdone, it might be very instructive to post some "post
mortems" on value investments which became big winners - or big losers. So we
can all understand what works and what doesn't.

To add to Jim's analysis of WHX:

There are two series of convertible preferred stock outstanding, with the
following features:

Series A:
Recent trade: $51.50
Current yield: 6.6%
Conversion features: 1:3.1686 (approx. $16.25 per common share, so premium is
about 11%)
Next div: 10/1 $0.8125
Call: approx. $51.50 (declines ratably from $52.275 in 1993 to $50 in 2003)

Series B:
Recent trade: $46.125
Current yield: 8.4%
Conversion features: 1:2.4510 (approx. $18.81 per common share, so premium over
current common is about 28%)
Next div: 10/1 $0.9375
Call: approx. $51.75 (declines ratably from $52.625 in 1993 to $50 in
2003)

There is no question that WHX will move toward BV. The question is timing. The
preferred will pay those, who are late to the game, a good rate to wait.

We own both the common and the Pref. B. We recently sold the Pref. A. because
the call provision is more likely to hold it back, although the chances that it
will be called are probably limited.

The 1996 10K has the most complete, internet-available information on the terms
of the preferred (in the notes to the financials, of course).

Way to go, Jim and Mike. This has been a tremendous performer.

To add my thanks to Mike&Jim(Thanks Guys!!!) Re WHX, I've played this just a
little differant and thought I would post, as it may have some merit..

I purchased that WHX.PR.A at 42.25 just after the strike ended, the reason I
choose the Pr.A was
1. Safety of the Preferred over the common. My belief is that in the event of
bankruptcy, the preferred would have been a creditor, and the balance sheet
would have allowed the full $50 face value+dividends to be
returned(eventually).
2. Because of the safety and dividend I took a position approx 60% larger than
I would have if I bought the common.
3.At this time, with a premium of approx 11% (equal to approx 15 months
dividend), and little chance of being called for a year at least(they have
other things to worry about) it should closely track the common on the
upside.(I doubt the premium will drop under 5%).
4. My stradegy now is to watch the common and when the momentum starts to slow
start shorting the common against the preferred with the hope that volitility
will allow me to trade the stock many times for $1-2 per share.

It may just keep going up until Im 100% short (collecting the dividend)at which
time I will convert the preferred and close out my short position. If it just
goes down I will have locked in some profit..

Anyway, a little differant slant, good luck (Who needs luck with the skill and
insight on this thread)to you all. Scott

(His fund is up 40% since inception in jan, 1996.) There is a cdx thread, but

I just read the Forbes article. Catellus seems awfully
interesting. I'll do my due diligence, let it stew in
my head, and report back my opinion, for what it's worth.

Other suggestions of Fitzpatrick (the real estate fund manager
quoted in the article) -- no REIT's here:

IHOP -- a real estate company disguised as a
restaurant company, with only restaurant analysts
following it. He figures $55/share in assets,
plus it's opening 65 restaurants a year. Good
management.

Wellsford Real Properties -- $21 in assets vs
12 share price, with catalysts in place for
realization of the value.

Supertel Hospitality - operates Super 8 motels,
Fitzpatrick likes the management.

These all seem worth a look for value investors.
The article itself is a must read, as is often
the case with Forbes articles.

Thanks for bringing this all to our attention, Jim.

<<Does anyone think the Video Tape Rental Industry will survive?>>

*Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on this.*

In a word, no. As information technology, digital satellite TV, the merger of
internet and the TV/cable, and all that takes place, videos will become
obsolete IMO. My understanding is that Primestar and
its ilk already offer tons of entertainment plus top movies at $2/pop.
With increased competition (and it appears to be getting intense),
costs will drop. In ten years, where will our old vcr's and videotapes be? IMO,
out of the spotlight. When the fundamentals
of an industry are threatened, I find it hard to invest in that

Mike,

I have been looking at REIT and related over last couple of months.

Wellsford - At current prices, I consider it fairly high risk. You have to read
deep into the SEC filings to get the true BV and earnings to common. They have
a lot of commitments and dilution that aren't obvious at first look.

Looked at IHOP recently and (IMO) the price may already be at or over value.
Looked to me that I'd missed the boat.

Supertel looked very interesting until I went deep into filings. Similar to
Wellsford with a lot of extra dilution, debt, and obligations.

Others may see it differently, just what I found.

I own and am continuing to acquire QAS. Sells near BV and it's understated.
They're profitable & growing without all the debt of most. Reported earnings
are real.

I bought New Holland (NH) on Wed. It dropped $6 off it's high and looked
undervalued. I have now looked into it and decided I bought a keeper. On Thur
coverage was initiated for a Buy rating. It has moved very little from the

FWIW: Established a small position in Del Webb (WBB) this am.

VL has a writeup with which I pretty much agree. (This in itself is a bad sign
-g-.) They too see that P/BV, PSRs are favorable compared to past years. My bet
is that company will sell (again) in the hombuilding cycle (maybe within 2
years?) somewhere near 1.5 x book (which next year could be $18) or about 27.
Low, I can see about 14...unless something really unexpected happens...

For the stock today at 19+, probably best to wait now 'til it drops back maybe
to 18 or lower (book at 17). It's breaking out to new highs ... some people
like that (a confirmatiion?!); I do not. (I think my concern that the stock was
running away without me got the better of me this am -- Several homebuilding
stocks I follow are also hitting new highs now.)

In addition to okay fundamentals, WBB is the country's 6th largest homebuilder
with a story: their stereotypical "Sun Cities". Demographics suggest increasing
numbers of older people -- which might create interest in their stock as well
as their homes. (Yeah, it's probably a well-known, well-told story -- but it
could get increasing attention in future.) WBB also beginning to build their
communities closer to where prospects now live, that is - a community in
Chicago area is being planned vs. typical retirement community in TX, AZ, NV.
This might be a successful venture for them.

Given all the shoulds and might-be's , WBB could-be an okay investment for a

I am an OID subscriber--I have to give it my highest recommendation. Great
managers are interviewed and give an extremely in depth analysis of each

Hello, V-man. Thanks for the prompt reply. If you have a little time, please
elaborate a bit, and mention some names. It seems to me that this thread should
not only be aware of the OID, but should also discuss each issue and decide if
the time is right for a particular position.

Paul,

WBB - Kicking myself. I looked at it a month ago when it dropped down around
17-1/2 and didn't buy, now I've bought at 19-5/8.

Historically:
Sold at 1.2-1.4 x BV, now at 1.15.
Sold at 12-15 PE, now below 9
Sold at .5 PSR, now .3
With exception of last year, has had increasing revs, equity, and profits.
Currently has good backorder status so forward revs looking good. BV should be
close to 18 this Q, definitely by year end.

Based on past stock performance, should be around 22.00 now.

Good one,
Ron

Another stock I suggest looking at is Eastman Kodak. It broke its 52 week low
of 60 this week - today it is 56 and change. Downward revision of this year's
earnings caused the the downturn.

PE is 26. PSls is 1.27. PBkV is 4.57. ROE is 25.5. Management will be
announcing new measures to cut costs and revive sales growth when it announces
3Q earnings.

Eastman Kodak was so overvalued in the first place,
the fall was a certainty. Even so, I figure that it
has a ways to fall before it is a value play.
Certainly I won't be nibbling yet. Notice how Fuji
is crowding out Kodak on the shelves -- and many
say the quality is better-- the price is much
cheaper. Kodak is a non-growth story being valued
as a growth story, even at these prices.

Good Investing,

Michael - Re: Kodak - I think the big challenge to them is digital cameras. The
arguments I've heard is that a lot of the revenues are from film which will
soon go the way of buggy whips. They haven't figured out how to market digital
cameras effectively. But I heard in the past few days that since the first wave
of digital cameras have been met with some success, that consumers can expect a
"Moore's law type revolution" in resolution and price. Numbers being thrown
around are double the pixels and half the price every year for the next few
years. I think we are within 4-7 years of the end of film! And it's doubtful
Kodak will be the camera leader since this has not been their market.

That said, EK either figures things out fast or they may be history. The
problem is that the business model changes from selling consumables (film) to
selling capital goods (digital cameras) which don't consume anything. And
historically, companies that big are often too slow and dumb to figure it out
before hemorrhaging lots of money or worse. Their plummet may not have yet
begun. I heard yesterday that they are relying on their film business to pull
them through this.

Interesting comments, Jeff

I agree with you & Mike insofar that I would not be a buyer here either. EK
might be worth a look in the low teens given their truly miserable performance

L. Nourse, Re OID: I think it's gone downhill.

Frequency of publication is, or has become, erratic IMO. Looks like about 3
issues in 1996 amd just one in 1997. This issue, Aug 1997, useless IMO. As
mentioned, in depth interview, sharp questions and discussion. Focus IMO on
Sogen Funds' J. Eveillard---lots of French and Foreign stocks.... Nam Yang
Dairy, Cheil Jedang in Korea;Edipresse in Switzerland, French co's of course
too --- puleeez.. Also big article on shareholder meeting (I believe) of
Berkshire Hathaway. This stuff was published earlier elsewhere...

For this I paid close to $400. Geez.

On the other hand there's an interview with C. Brandes of the eponymous (I LIKE
that word -g-) fund. He has recommended BAT industries, also mentioned here
(this thread) by someone. Not too much info. (Nothing not already in VL I would
guess), but it's an idea. And all you (I) need is one (or maybe two) and maybe
the mag. pays for itself. Plus, there's been - in past- some good articles
about how value investors think. For example discussion (pro and con) by top
people about Buffet's Wells Fargo investment when it was about $65 in 1991(?).
Most of the top investment managers have been interviewed. I like that. (I
subscribed in early '90's, but dropped because I didn't see value as price sky
rocketed. Tried it again last year (1 yr subscription).

There's an OID website. Going through my notes I came across it recently. This
may be of interest. There's a conference coming up in which apparently a couple
of dozen companies will participate. I've gone through the list... there may
indeed be some value stocks there ... or some with a story which maybe were or
are sponsored or recommended by people interviwed in OID.

My subscription renewal notice says something about OID will be published 10
times per year. I find this bizarre, given that I've only got one issue in '97,
and it's not chuck full of ideas. I'm seriously considering not renewing.
Anybody with info or opinions why they are renewing, I'd like to hear from
them.

As far as discussing each investment idea OIM reports, I would be against that.
It probably is not possible given the large number of ideas in each OID
publication. Maybe might be construed as stealing from the work of the
publisher and kind of slamming the people who do pay their money for his stock
reports.

Michael, I agree that EK is or was valued like a growth stock - probably
started when Fischer was brought in from Motorola. However, with $1.8 billion
in cash and a wake-up call which is causing management to cut further the stock
may be approaching value territory. One of the criticisms is that EK has had no
strategic success versus Fuji and they are a little arrogant about the quality
of Kodak film versus that of Fuji.

At what price would you view this as a value stock?

Thank you.

Re OID:

You shouldn't overlook those foreign stocks that get mentioned in OID from time
to time. They are very easy to purchase and keep track of in our ever shrinking
world, and the values they represent are often incredible, especially when
compared to the situation in the US. I have had excellent returns with British
Telecom, and Novartis(formerly Ciba-Geigy), to name a couple of familiar names,
and Scala ECE to name an unfamiliar company. There is a huge world of developed
countries out there with high quality CHEAP stocks that need our attention. I
recently purchased the ADR's of a UK stock called BTR Plc., trading at a p/e of
9 and paying a 6% dividend. They are a classic conglomerate that is shedding
non-core businesses in typical American fashion, to concentrate on what it does
best. Earnings are on the rise while p/e expansion is soon to follow(a value
investors favorite situation). Find it under BTRUY on the OTC bulletin board.
Go check their website, or read about them in the online Financial
Times(www.ft.com).

I will keep my OID subscription because all i need is one good idea to pay for
a lifetime of newsletters. I made a ton of money off of Robert Rodriguez's
picks Reebok and Arrow. I plan to make a lot more!

Hi Mike - I'm running dry lately on my type of values stocks. Paul Senior's NCR
pick looks good. I posted my opinion on the NCR thread and I am buying.

Fisher's time-tested method of buying bombed out tech stocks has been working
well. The problem is that tech hasn't had real rolling corrections like they
had last year that created real bargains.

Disks are down right now but it isn't that deep a correction. A good play here
is KMAG that owns 40% of the world market in thin film media (ie. what data is
stored on in disk drives). However, it doesn't fit Fisher's model because the
PSR is still too high.

Mike:

I also get good ideas from this thread. One that had been discussed earlier
(which I am long) was Little Switzerland. Have you been following and if so
what is your take on the string of "negative" announcements. i.e. delayed 10k
filing, previous filings may have had errors etc.

Based on the market reaction (which has been small) I get the impression that
the stock is very strong (i know now i am getting technical ) But that was one
of the characteristics according to Pring of a decent stock. - apparent bad
news having little impact.

Additionally, looking at the price to book / price to sales ratios and the
possible privatization by Sturm and company, it still looks like a good deal.

Appreciate your comments.

Re: Little Switzerland

I love the stock/company. BUT these announcements are
very concerning for me. They call into question the
integrity of management. I have exited my position
until I find out how much they have fiddled with the
numbers, and for how long. If things turn out to
be minor, I'll re-enter -- the stock is ignored
enough that I should have time to get back in at
reasonable prices. If the situation is grave, then
the downside is back around its lows with no catalyst
for price improvement, and I'll be glad to be out.
Currently, I am sitting on a chunk of cash and riding out the market
convulsions.

Hi Michael - I used to buy on Graham/Newman theory but I really didn't feel I
was well enough equipped or had the time to do a lot of the research and this
fact was reflected in my returns. I also strongly believe in Peter Lynch's
recommendation to not buy what you don't understand. Since I'm in the middle of
a technology career, Fisher's value approach fits well. And so far I've been
able to still maintain pretty good downside protection.

Also, do you mean Applied Materials? I bought as low as $25 last July and I'm
still holding at around $100 although it's overvalued. (Yes - I am looking for
an opportune time to dump it!) That was perhaps the safest tech value stock
this decade! As a doc, you should be able to make the same kinds of calls in
medical high tech issues. The gains can be higher than computer-related stocks.

I never feel bad passing up a stock. In this respect the stock market forgives.
There will be other good buys as techs correct as they have for the past 15-20
years.

<<As a doc, you should be able to make the same kinds of calls in medical high

Ay, there's the rub. Indeed, some biotechs explode upward, but
those that don't often fail. There's not much of a middle
road. And you can often lose your shirt (>90%) on a regulatory
decision or a new side effect that raises the lawsuit specter.
Hence, while I am a physician, I am hesitant to recommend any
biotechs as value plays. I do not personally know anyone who
plays the biotech market exclusive of owning the big pharms that
does well long-term. Way too much guessing -- even if you know
what you are talking about.

An example:
Theragenics makes radioactive implantable seeds to be placed
in a cancerous prostate. What a market! Yes, they work. Yes
the morbidity is low. I knew this before the market.
And I bought at 13 -- at a PE of about 60. It's now at 44
or so. I got out at 17 1/2 -- a PE of 90. And that's one of
the few "values" I've found.

Needless to say, little to no margin of safety. Discounts to Sales are rare and
often deserved as the market for the product is failing. Biotechs just about
all also fail both Fishers' rules -- namely, there is just too much
competition. One discovery anywhere in the world can obsolete 20-100% of your
company's product line. The regular techs
have more predictability (relative to biotech). AMAT I bought
April 96 at 37 only to see it fall to the value you bought it at.
I got out at 31. Looked smart for about 4 months.

When I do find a biotech value play -- PE<50 and >0 in a market
I know will explode -- the full value is often not realized
as the behemoths buy up your company before realization of
the market. Hence, I wonder now whether it is worth the
risk and sleepless nights for a value investor to buy biotechs
at all anymore.

Good Investing,
Mike

Do you have any opinion about UM? They dropped down
a lot because they lost Baxter sales and
their other lines were not growing fast. However
the company is a cash cow - the margins are high and
cash flows are positive. They bought back about 25% (?)

It's not very cheap, but I doubt it will get cheaper. :-)

Hi Mike - I see your point. I spent about 40-50 hours on AMGN recently just for
the heck of it. They have two good products and lots in the pipeline but it's
like you say about obsolescense. Getting through clinicals is another story.

But the interesting thing about AMGN is that it appears to be moving sideways
as the PSR adjusts downward to more reasonable levels. If it follows Fisher's
model, it may move sideways for 3-5 years at the current revenue growth rate!
The current PSR is around 7 and the growth rate is around 20%. A PSR of 2-3 is
perhaps reasonable high value for a company of it's size in 3-5 years.

>Indeed, some biotechs explode upward, but
those that don't often fail.

What about Stryker? It's a favorite NAIC stock that just keeps going up. Of
course it's not a value stock but it's one heck of a great company. A few
doctors around here put a lot of money into it 5 - 7 years ago and are still
holding it.

>AMAT I bought
>April 96 at 37 only to see it fall to the value you bought it at.
>I got out at 31. Looked smart for about 4 months.

Believe it or not, that's when I started buying also! My average cost is in the
neighborhood of $35-37. The method I use that works great is buy on price
movements and in fixed intervals to average the cost down if it truely is a
great company. I accumulated AMAT in about 8 purchases. I bought about 6 weeks
apart when the price didn't move and then I bought every time the price moved
about $5-7. It's impossible to bottom fish. Just when you think they've hit
bottom, the bottom falls out.

A recent case in point was SGI. I bought some at $20 just before the April
earnings announcement and then bought a lot more beginning 2 days later at $13
or $14! I made my last buy at about $28. But I started buying as high as $34 on
the way down. Average cost is around $21.

Tech value investing is in a class by itself and IMO Fisher's method makes the
most sense from a value standpoint. Obviously intrinsic value approaches fall
apart here. But the tech revolution is here and it is going to drive the
country for a long time. But unlike the railroads that accumulated tangible
assets, tech companies have intangible assets which do have value.

Hi. I like Fisher's PSR sometimes (big tech stocks) and sometimes Graham's
approach. Have also had some okay luck in investing in companies that I thought
I knew (but I didn't -g-). I don't think any of these approaches work all the
time.
Big issue for me is management... so important (usually) and so hard (usually)
for me to check. Charles Almon was quoted recently somewhere as saying he
always talks to mgmt. About 1/3 are crooks, about 1/3 are incompetent, about
1/3 are excellent. Even a strict numbers approach (Graham, in later years) can
only overcome this by diversification. Or luck (Graham made most of his $ in
Geico, a well-managed co. into which he reluctantly put a big stake, I
believe.)

I gave up on these 2 companies: Gallagher (AJG) and Centris (CGE)

Gallagher 10K reports they are having a tough time in a competitive
environment. They are insurance brokers. Lot to like though. PE about 13 with
range over past years being 11-17, mostly at higher end. Increasing div.(3+%),
also increasing earnings and sales for many years. For PEG fans (I'm not),
ratio will look pretty good I think. "Family owned and operated"? which is
positive and negative.

Centris in a niche insurance market that may be slowing. Very good rev. and
earnings growth. PSR at .66 and p/bv at 1.1., pe 8. Looks like they do about
180-200m rev with less than 100 employees. (leverage? a plus; so few employees
a neg.?)

I just don't see a compelling hook for me. Anybody like either of these let me
know and I'll revisit and reconsider. Otherwise pass for now. (If anyone does
look at these, recheck ratios. Not sure I am giving latest/correct figures from
my work sheets.) Guess I'd rather put funds into stocks I recently mentioned
(purchased) after breaking out to new highs and which in past few days seem to
be breaking back in -g- or maybe breaking down :>(

Paul, thanks for your comments, I like a thread where picks are challenged
rather than rah-rah cheerleading.

Re. ELAMF - I've been in it for a few months. I believe the issue with them is
growth not earnings. Margins have been slim compared to other contract
manufacturers. If some of the forecasts about upcoming Qs are correct then
investors will flock to it - but given its history, investors will react rather
than pro-act to this stock imo.

Re. MMBLF - the new head guy is the same guy who turned Manville around. The
stock is up 7% since he was announced but I believe it is still in its early
stage of appreciation. I've heard, but cannot confirm, that the Bass family has
significant holdings. The announcements to date allude to the fact that he was
brought in to boost shareholder value - they have several forest product
divisions and obviously a lot of real estate. And you are correct - the time to
buy cyclicals is while they are still losing $.

Re. radaf - theres a need to look at history. It went public at 11, dropped to
9, to 6, to 3, to 0.75 and is now back to 11. Their core competencies are
innovative games and electronic contract manufacturing - basically they
manufacture electronic hand held games - very high margins for their own games
and decent margins for Hasbro.
During its "swoon" period - they built up too much inventory, had little
contract manufacturing to balance load, were geographically diverse in
manufacuturing and were focused on hand held gambling games. They restructured,
cutting costs to the bone, consolidated manuf. to China, and expanding R&D. The
payoff has been big as sales have now expanded and most of the margin is
flowing to the bottom line. The stock has developed a history during the last
few earnings releases of running up a few weeks before release. The CFO posts
on the RADAF thread on SI. There has been insider selling but I believe that
based on earnings there is still room for a run into the mid teens prior to
earnings release in Dec. Why? because with them, earnings in the short run are
proportional to factory workers (they book what they ship) and indications are
that they have record levels of workers for this Q - and that we will see over
0.40/share for the Q and about $1 for the year.

Re GNSM - earnings tanked while they boosted G&A expenses while sales
decreased. Product sales down while service sales continue to increase.
However, product upgrades were announced in July (now shipping) and they are
cutting overhead expenses and have a number of trade shows in October and
November. When this will show up in the bottom line is difficult to say, but
they have a nice cash cushion. My experience in a similar situation (SSNC which
I watched but did not enter) indicated that very early signs of turnaround were
preceded by strength in stock and followed by very rapid runup.

Hi Paul - If any method worked nearly 100% of the time, everybody would use it.
On Fisher's Super Stock method, management IS the big issue. Since I started
following Fisher's method very strictly, every company I have bought has made
good money for me. Some a lot more than others. But I haven't lost money yet.
The problem is finding true Super Companies that are Super Stocks. The method
of identifying and qualifying is straightforward, but time consuming. Finding
the low-PSR stuff is easy with a screening program. It's researching about the
products, competitors, and management that takes time. I usually only find 1 or
perhaps 2 true Super Stocks a year. Others are close, but usually the PSR is
too high. In these cases I will usually buy if management is great and they
have some big competitive advantage.

>Hi. I like Fisher's PSR sometimes (big tech stocks) and sometimes Graham's

thought I

time.

For all its worth, here are a few companies that appear to be full of value at
this time--PXRE(NYSE:PXT) is an extremely well managed reinsurance firm that is
highly profitable and underwrites only where it is intelligent to do so.
Sterling software(NYSE:SSW) has close to $20 a share in cash(stock is currently
36) and a history of intelligent acquisitions. It was a better bargain at 31,
but if the cash is transformed from 5% return to 20% return, it is a $60 stock.
Operating portion should make $1.20, plus about .80 in interest. After backing
out cash, p/e is about 13. It is worth a look. Amerco(NSDQ:UHAL) is sitting on
a pile of undervalued assets. They, of course, are the largest rental outfit
for moving, but they also make millions off of selling boxes, pads, trailer
hitches, atc. They are the second largest self storage company in the US, plus
they have a profitable insurance division--all together, it has much more value
than indicated in the stock price.

Looking at UHAL another way. What are hundreds of thousands of fully
depreciated trailers worth? The depreciation of all their rolling stock and
other assets would make the company worth far more than their book value. One
needs to look at the asset growth and depreciation to see how much investing in
new equipment has effected earnings. Did they really lose money or are they
beating taxes?

With luck, it won't be moving in near future.

Has anyone taken a look at TASA?

Following Bob's note I took a look at it and it looks quite good to me. I have
been lurking here for a while and am a keen value investor in the middle of
reading Super Stocks.

I have pared Bob's revenue growth rate down from 25% to about 15% and this
still gives a PSR of maybe 1.2 on '98 revenues and today's close. I am hoping
that it might be possible to pick it up at a PSR of 1 ($5/8) over the next
little while as the recent flurry of buying subsides. A PSR of 1 for a company
with a 10% net profit margin, some cash and little debt with a good niche in a
growing market seems like a pretty good situation to me. Very conservative
accounting is a good sign of credible management.

Any other views? (and kudos to all for the great info on this thread)

Chris,

Check the August 25 lead article in Barrons for more information on FIBR. Be
VERY careful with this company. I looked at this company closely for several
months, wondering why the margins were so bad. In my opinion it is clear that
the management is not working in the best interests of shareholders. The
company has purchased some good product lines but the product is always
secondary to the management. Go over to the FIBR thread and you will find a
bunch of cheerleaders; no objective assesment of the company; it the same with
most of the computer company threads; Dell, GTW, HWP...don't use the thread for

Chris,

LSVI is getting interesting, no? My take:

- LSVI does appear poorly managed, and CEI's management
does appear intelligent -- the recent records of
both companies in similar environments provides some
evidence of this.

- the put right good for 1 year at 6.15 is less than
ideal, but it does give one the right to risk
a 10% downside for unlimited upside for a year.
Those aren't bad odds, even if nothing signifcant
happens.

- CEI's CEO still has 20 odd million shares after the
transaction, if approved. He certainly has incentive
to increase the stock price of LSVI. And he would
have difficulty extracting himself from that position,
suggesting a long-term bias. And unless he wants
to buy back all the current shares at 6.15 in a year
and swallow his pride, he has significant short-term
incentive.

- it's a vote of confidence in the current price level
of LSVI, if not a higher price.

- it's a reason for LSVI's extra due diligence on its
10K - now likely just a delay tactic.

Interesting, especially from the sidelines. I'd appreciate
others' input.

Good investing,
Mike

Is anyone here knowledgeable about asbestos litigation?

Raytech (RAY), which makes friction products (brakes and clutches) has been in
Chapter 11 for several years, facing lawsuits from people who claim to have
been injured by asbestos. Their financial condition is now strong enough that
they want to emerge from Chapter 11 (in District of Connecticut) and settle the
suits. The federal courts have ruled that Raytech may be sued as a successor to
Raymark, and the big question now is what the outcome will be.

Raytech has suggested giving up to half the company to the claimants, and
already has a huge number of treasury shares. The claimants (or their greedy
lawyers) want all the existing stock wiped out, and new stock issued only to
them. If they win, the existing stock will be worthless. If the company wins,
the stock is a huge bargain at 5.5625:

P/E = 1.08
P/book = 0.42
PSR = 0.07
P/cash flow = 1.01

While this trades on the NYSE, outstanding market cap is only $18 million.
Management owns 14.9%, Echlin (auto parts mfr) owns 16.8%, and FMR owns 8.4%.
The CEO did sell about 1/4 of his shares in the past year.

Is the potential for great reward worth the great risk of a total loss?

McRae Industries (MRI class A) is an AMEX value play, but this is a microcap
with a tiny float. The stock doesn't trade every day, and when it does, it's
usually around 1,000 shares total. At $8.875/share:

P/E = 8.1
PEG = 0.25
P/book = 0.93
PSR = 0.38
Yield = 4.06% (class A only)

The class B stock has ten times the voting power as class A, but doesn't have a
dividend.

The President, B.J. McRae, owns 34% of Class A, 63% of Class B. NationsBank own
16% of Class A, 13% of Class B. That leaves around 900,000 class A shares, and
230,000 class B shares, for the rest of us.

The company is a conglomerate, operating in: bar-code reading & printing (33%
sales, 44% income), military & sport boots (36% sales, 26% income), and office
equip/commerical printing (31% sales, 31% income).

Negatives include: small cap, nepotism (the president's sons are VP's), and
related transactions (the president thinks this public company is his private
bank: it has lended him and his car dealership over a million dollars at 2%
above federal funds rate. That's legal, but I think it's unseemly.)

B.J. McRae is 76 and his sons are in their 40's. I don't know if they will

Hi Paul - Re: OLS - It looks good at these levels but I've bought enough on the

Management is pretty honest so I don't think anything scary will come jumping
out of the closet. Zack's currently has them ranked "2" (Buy) which is the
first time they've carried this rating for I think over a year. This means that
they are expecting earnings to improve, probably because margins are improving.

I talk to my CFP friend in DC on occasion and he has really been loading up on
the stock. He makes good money on his picks and likes to hold a minimum of 5
years and prefers 10.

The shareholder law suits are always funny. I can't remember the last time I
bought a bombed out stock that DIDN'T have a shareholder suit filed against it.
Seems like there is a species of lawyer which is related to the ambulance

there will be a law suit.

Seems intersting. Here is some data.

Current share price = 4 7/8

Market cap = $50mm, Cash =$25mm -> Firm Value =$25mm

Sales = $70mm.

Any branded consumer products company selling at 1/3 of sales is very
interesting to me. Sam Adams sells at ~65% of sales.

Has been consistently dissapointing Wall Street, so stock is beaten down.
Issues with too much inventory in pipeline. Eventually, this should work its
way through. Also, company spends $.40 on the $1 of revenue on marketing. This
is too much money and hopefully changes.

On subject, value plays can often come out of the dust of fallen angels. My

chk at net price of 6.5 and docsf at 4 7/16 if assigned next year. If not the
premiums earn an annualized return of 100%( based on 10% margin
requirement,less annualized return if options slip into the money). Another
strategy is to sell ratio calls, for example just bought abti stock at 3 3/16
and sold 2 march 5 calls at 5/8 for each 100 shares at net stock price of 2.
Will buy back half of options sold should stock reach 5. I believe you followed

MacBlo appoints new CEO

Forest products firm hopes turnaround specialist
Thomas Stephens can help stem losses

Wednesday, September 17, 1997
By Paul Waldie
The Globe and Mail

MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. has hired a turnaround specialist as its new chief
executive officer to help reverse a steady stream of
losses at Canada's biggest forest products company.

Thomas Stephens, 55, headed Denver-based Manville Corp. for 10 years and is
credited with pulling the company out of
bankruptcy protection in the late 1980s. He left Manville in 1996 after a
skirmish with the company's board of directors.

Analysts welcomed the appointment as a needed change at the company, although
few knew much about Mr. Stephens.
MacMillan Bloedel's share price climbed $1.05 to close at $19.25 on the Toronto
Stock Exchange yesterday.

"The reputation he generated at Manville was that of an extremely shrewd
financial person," said Andrew Root, an analyst at
Goldman Sachs & Co. in New York. "He has a chief financial officer background,
but at the same time he knows his way
around a pulp and paper mill."

He and other analysts said Mr. Stephens faces a big challenge in his new job.

MacMillan Bloedel lost $5-million in the second quarter of 1997, compared with
an $11-million profit in the same period a
year earlier excluding a large gain on the sale of an asset.

The company has lost $87-million in total over the past three quarters and many
analysts don't expect any profit this year and
only a slight profit in 1998.

"This guy has his plate full," said John Duncanson of Duncanson Investment
Research Inc. in Toronto.

"He's got to basically bring in a new management team, or bring along a new
team from some of the people inside. And, at the
same time he has to basically rethink the company's strategy."

Mr. Duncanson said MacMillan Bloedel has lacked direction recently and has been
poorly served by its upper management,
which consists largely of long-time company workers.

"I think they have done a lousy job for the shareholders," he said. "Look at
the stock over the last 10 years. Basically there has
barely been a heart beat, it's been a straight line."

Mr. Stephens replaces Robert Findlay on Sept. 29. Mr. Findlay has been planning
to retire after spending 30 years at
Vancouver-based MacMillan Bloedel, the past seven as CEO.

"We're confident that we've got the right person in the right job at the right
time," said Dick Haskayne, chairman of MacMillan
Bloedel.

"Although we had to convince him some, he had all the attributes that we were
looking for. He is pretty well versed on
[MacMillan Bloedel] and sure as hell knows the industry inside out."

Mr. Stephens was touring MacMillan Bloedel's plant in Pembroke, Ont., yesterday
and was unavailable for comment.

Mr. Haskayne acknowledged the challenges Mr. Stephens faces but said the board
is confident in his ability. "You get the right
CEO and put them in place with the asset base that [the company has] and give a
little help and support and it will work."

Born in Crossett, Ark., Mr. Stephens started his career in 1963 as an engineer
at Olinkraft Inc., a forest products company
based in West Monroe, La.

Manville bought Olinkraft in 1979 and Mr. Stephens eventually became president
of the forest products division. Manville was
also the largest asbestos producer in the United States and the company had to
file for bankruptcy protection in 1982 because
of a flood of lawsuits by people with asbestos-related illnesses. The company
also had extensive operations in Quebec,
Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta at the time.

Mr. Stephens was promoted to chief financial officer of Manville in 1985 and
then chief executive officer in 1986. He is
credited with pulling Manville out of bankruptcy protection in 1988 by
developing a reorganization plan that included a
$3-billion (U.S.) trust fund to pay the injury claims.

Manville reorganized again in 1996 and is now called Johns Manville Corp. and
has about $3-billion in annual sales. It was
during that reorganization that Mr. Stephens reportedly had a quarrel with
Robert Falise, chairman of the trust fund that also
owns 79 per cent of the company. Mr. Falise reportedly pushed Mr. Stephens out
as chief executive officer, although Mr.
Stephens has said he resigned. On his way out, Mr. Stephens collected
$7-million in severance.

Mr. Haskayne played down the quarrel and said MacMillan Bloedel hired Mr.
Stephens because of his industry experience.
Mr. Haskayne added that Mr. Stephens was eager to end his retirement.

"These war horses get anxious to get back into service," he said. "He is
energized and ready to go to work and anxious to start
with MacMillan Bloedel."

MacMillan Bloedel's three divisions -- building materials, paper and packaging
-- have been hit with falling prices and rising
stumpage, the fee charged for logging on provincial lands. The province has
also been cutting the amount of trees that can be
harvested annually. MacMillan Bloedel has seen its annual harvest allotment
fall 15 per cent since 1992.

However, investment analyst Mr. Duncanson said the company is to blame for much
of its own problems because other forest
product companies have been able to cope with similar constraints. He said many
of the company's mills have higher costs than
its competitors, and the company has moved into some product lines, such as
oriented strandboard, too late and now faces a
market that is oversupplied.

MacMillan Bloedel started a five-year restructuring plan in 1994 to cut costs
and improve productivity. However, according to
a recent report by Salomon Bros. in New York, the program has had little
success.

"The company's goal is to improve operating earnings by roughly $600-million
[Canadian] by year-end 1998," the report said.
The company's operating profit in 1996 was $76-million. "So far, however, we do
not see how this goal can be achieved in the
allotted time frame."

Canada's biggest forest products company brings in a turnaround artist to pull
it out of a dive. But MacMillan Bloedel's new
CEO faces a huge challenge; after racking up losses of $87-million in the past
three quarters, many analysts don't expect the
company to make money in this year.
