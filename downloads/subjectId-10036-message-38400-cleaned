Hi Paul -

More SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU) for me today. My last add at $12.33/share on
6/7/2010. Stock now below $11.00/share and trading volume below average. No
news to signal continued sell off but stock now trading at a 52wk low.

Will need to remember to peel off some shares when it touches $17.00/share
again.

Paul - I should probably hedge my bet on SVU and start a position in WMT. I do
own Tesco which is sort of like a WllMart in size however I never considered
WMT a value stock. Their forward PE at current prices is now below 11 and the
dividend yield at 2.4% is equivalent to that of SVU. Maybe WMT is entering
value territory too.

Since this was the last trading day of the quarter and for June, perhaps the
last hour of selling was due to funds selling their looser positions. The
summer rally should start soon.

There does not seem to be any place to hide. The food stores seemed like a
logical defensive play but it has not worked this month.

re SVU - I am really wondering how "defensive" the grocery business is. The
business model for the grocery store is to draw traffic with promotions and
make the money with std priced fare and incidentals.

But nothing prevents customers from just buying promotions, except some
convenience. There are new entrants like Trader Joe, Wal Mart and Target that
know how to keep prices low. There is Costco and Foodmax as well offering lower
prices.

As for valuations, i agree that grocers like SVU, SWY, KR are cheap with a 5x
EV/EBITDA but for around 6x EV/EBITDA I can buy a drug store stocks WAG and
CVS.

BBY is discretionary but it's a category leader trading at 4x EV/EBITDA.

So while the grocers are cheap, it's a bit relative. I think the drug stores
CVS and WAG and in particular electronic retailer BBY are better buys. For
many, buying a new cellphone every 6 month does not seem a discretionary
expense any more...

BBY could be a better buy. I'll consider.

Whereas SVU faces national and regional competitors, there's no other national
chain of electronics stores that's comparable to BBY. Although WMT and Amazon
and maybe Costco provide competition aplenty.

I've no idea what is or will be driving earnings at BBY. We all already have
our flat panel TV's.

At current stock price though, a buyer gets a stock that has had consistently
good roe (20+%) for a now relatively low p/e (11x).

My only concern is all my other preferreds are holding up quite well. So this

3D television is going to be huge, driving growth for years, imo.

3D TV has a looong way to go for mass adoption. I replaced a flat screen TV
recently and I saw all these 3D sets for sale, but IMHO it's all complete crap.
I can survive watching a movie or two a year in IMAX 3D and even then it's not
great for my eyes, but I'd never watch current quality 3D every day on a TV.
It's a pain and almost no gain. And I have friends who feel even worse and have
headaches after a single 3D movie. Sorry, maybe I'll be a huge tech-laggard,
but IMHO really watchable 3D is another 8-10 years away, since the current
technology (as I understand it) is not easy to evolutionary improve to get rid
of its shortcomings: eyeglasses, limited FOV, blurriness, eye irritation, etc.
Unless I am wrong, the technology has to change quite completely to fix all
these issues.

BTW, even though I bought my previous flat screen TVs at mortar stores, this
time I went Amazon for cheapest price. Mortar stores only have a chance if
politicos gonna make Amazon charge state taxes and even then I'm not sure.

re 3D- I don' agree with you on 3D. I think it's a natural extension to improve
the entertainment experience after better sound and higher definition. It also
has the biggest impact on the spectators experience, imo.

I don't have a 3D TV and would never buy one right now but I think it's going
to be mainstream in 2 years with a fairly moderate markup compared to std TV's.
I have watched movies in 3D (RealD and Dolby 3D) and found both thoroughly
enjoyable. I noticed some artifacts but they did not impact my experience much.

Adding the 3rd dimension is a natural path to improve the spectators experience
imo. From a technical point of view, all that needs so be done is encode (in
the TV) and decode (the glasses) a different information for the left and right
eye. Dolby does use colors, RealD uses polarization and current LCD uses time.
I am sure an economical way to solve the technical hurdles for he mass market
will be found.FWIW I think 3D is not limited to entertainment only, in fact the
roots of the technology are in defense visualization.

Take my word with a grain of salt, some of my work is related to 3D <g>.

OT: 3D

I am not sure we are disagreeing too much. ;) A lot depends on what you mean by
"going to be mainstream" and on the price differential. IMHO, 3D TVs are
probably going to be about 10% of market in 2 years, 20% in 3-4 years. I think
the price differential will not be big, so people will buy them even if they
don't particularly need/like them.

IMHO to get to 50-80-90% of the market, they have to be made glass-less and
other artifacts like narrow FOV and blurriness have to be solved. Not sure that
can be done incrementally from current standard(s)/tech.

Welcome, Mr. Gogo. I have a few shares of Compton. My average purchase price is
$1.01/sh., so with my shares now at $.55/sh., I am not a happy shareholder.

Compton recently gave up their listing on the NYS, so the stock symbol for me
is CMZPF.

I'm a novice as regards the oil/gas sector. It seems to me that there doesn't
seem to be a standard way in which nat gas companies report the value their
assets. When they report to shareholders, the common thread seems to me that
they report in any/all ways which give the most favorable valuation and/or
prospects.

For me, I have enterprise value (at current .55 share price) at $764M with
2pnpv at $1.69B. So I call the stock undervalued.

In past few weeks the company has announced some asset sales and debt debt
reductions. I don't see that reflected in the numbers they are reporting. When
I see the new numbers, I might decide to add more shares. It will remain a
small, speculative position here for me; I'm much more interested in oil e&p
vs. nat gas e&p companies.

GDL. Looked again, and while the preferred does seem safer, I'll stick with a
gamble on the common. Somebody owning the preferred could do okay though imo:
The 8% yield seem pretty good, and fairly safe (jmo) considering the type of
business GDL is. Although as you mention, a buyer should figure the premium has
got to be amortized ($53.40 over a possible call @ $50 starting in '16).

GDL (common) is at lows now, and I decided to up my shares a bit. I like the
fact it hasn't fluctuated too much and pays a good distribution. Of course,
being that the company invests short term in deals it likes, I assume if a few
deals don't complete successfully or there's a dearth of them, the distribution
can and will be reduced. OTOH, my opinion remains that many companies are cash
rich, and if they want to grow and put that cash to work, the takeover game
will increase.

RE: HRPpB - now CWHpB 8 1/2% 

- repositioned the funds into FRpK - a speculative 2 bagger but you might have
to wait 12-24 months.

Hi Paul -

Sold the complete lot of the HRP preferred B's (new symbol CWB as of July 1,
2010). Still hold the D's in the IRA. I am taking the proceeds and buying First
Industrial Realty Trust Inc. Preferred K's. 7 1/2% cumulative preferred
currently priced at $12.50/share.

There is concern (by Fitch) that FR may not meet it's debt covenants and the
dividend will be postponed (perhaps by two quarters) on the preferred series
(K's and J's). In May 2010, the company approved a 10 million share secondary
("At the Market" secondary) with proceeds to be used to payoff debt. I am not
sure if some or all of this was sold. I suspect it may be issued in a private
placement (perhaps with the debt owner(s) subject to the covenant provisions).

In April 2010, the company completed the refinance for debt due in 2011 and the
best I can tell, they have $110 million left to roll over in September 2011.

The CEO is new (been on board one year) and needs to get some vacant property
leased (a main goal for him) and has stated he wants to deleverage the
company's balance sheet. He also terminated a recent JV earlier this month to
free up some capital. This will account for a small one time loss but helps
them build up their capital cushion.

The way I see it, is that these preferred series (J's and K's) are being sold
off too much for the "possible" postponement of dividend concerns. It's a
cumulative preferred so you will eventually get paid even if it is postponed.

The debt they "Called" in April 2010 was paid at a premium to PAR and included
all earned dividends. I anticipate worst case is that these preferrds (series J
and series K) would be treated the same way. If that is the case, you are
buying them at $0.50 on the $1.00 and will earn an effective 15% dividend (7
1/2% at par $25.00).

You lose if the company goes BK. I am willing to take this risk.

Increased my preferred position in series K by 20%. Booked my profit in the HRP
preferred B's...a 2 bagger that paid 8 1/2% interest.

I expect this position to be a 2 bagger that pays 7 1/2% interest..... or
nothing at all.

From a yahoo poster:

emarle to Increase Price of SAYTEX&#174; BT-93W and BT-93 Brominated Flame
Retardants

BATON ROUGE, La., June 28, 2010 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Albemarle Corporation
(NYSE:ALB - News) announced today that it will increase the base price of
SAYTEX&#174; BT-93W and SAYTEX&#174; BT-93 (ethylenebistetrabromophthalimide)
by $1.00/kg on all global shipments on or after August 1, 2010, or as contracts
allow.

Albemarle has announced price increases 4 times over the past 5 weeks, which
should surely help Gulf Resources bromine prices. Albemarle is trading at 16.7x
LTM earnings compared to GFRE trading at 8.5x LTM earnings. ALB is trading at
11.7x compared to GFRE at 5.6x based on its $1.52 forward EPS estimate.

Given that GFRE benefits from an appreciating yuan/dollar exchange rate,
stronger historical and projected revenue growth, and better margins, GFRE
should be trading at a premium to ALB, not a 50% discount. Brean Murray's
$17.00 price target should come true once companies start trading based on
fundamentals versus the overall fear that has gripped the markets over the past

FII at current $20 price, I don't know. Sorry though I didn't take my own
opinion for shorting it few months back at $26+ (FII too tied to money market

I'm not following STT now. I have an order in for more BK though.

I'll continue to hold NE...at least for a while longer.

FLT looks like a buy. I've got several of these construction companies already

Hi Jurgis -

RE: FelCor Lodging Trust Incorporat (NYSE: FCH); Strategic Hotels & Resorts Inc
(NYSE: BEE); First Industrial Realty Trust,
(NYSE: FR)

I noticed that too. To hedge the associated risk in the preferred one would
usually sell the common shares. Today's trading volume of FR common shares was
30% below its average daily trading volume.

The FRpJ traded 16x its average volume -
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FR-PJ,FR-PK&d=s

FR common traded .7x its average volume
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FCH,BEE,FR&d=s

This indicates to me that several large holders of the preferred series just
wanted out and were willing to take any amount to book their sale. With a
thinly traded security like the preferreds, we see the price drop necessary to
flush this volume.

The initial IPO for Series K was on 8/17/2006 for 2.00 Million Shares @
$25.00/share. Link to IPO Prospectus (
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/921825/000095013706009279/c07659b2e424b2
htm ). <u> Over 13% of the initial issue traded today!</u> These are callable
by the company beginning 8/2011. Series J are callable beginning 1/2011 this
issue was an IPO for 6 million shares.

Note: On March 29, 2010, FR announced the early redemption of outstanding
7.375% Notes Due 2011 of First Industrial, L.P.. The total amount of this
redemption was $70.8 million. They paid a 5% premium to par to close this
position.

I suspect the plan by the company is to roll both of these preferred series
over in 2011 by calling them (must be paid out at Par value $25.00/share) and
would include any or all of the cumulative dividends not paid to date. This is
what the company did with their series B,C,D & E issues which were called (and
paid at par $25.00/share) in 2002, 2007, 2004 & 2004 respectively.

The company holds lots of valuable assets (BV according to YAHOO is
$15.00/share after secondary s/b $12.00/share) mk value as of today's close
$4.39/share or 30% of BV), continues to operate several JV (Joint equity
ventures) that can be liquidated to free up capital if needed and has approval
to issue 10 million more common shares (bad for common share holders if done at
current levels).

If I was management, I would be the buyer of these securities using what ever
capital lines might be available. Here is a chance to buy back your debt $0.50
on the $1.00. Perhaps we may have seen some of that buying today in the series
K issues.

I doubt very much that the company is setting itself up for BK. I would expect
to see much more trading volume and lower lows on the common shares.

In one year the story will be much clearer. It's either a two bagger or the
company suspended the preferred series dividend and is working on paying down
debt from cash flow. If the latter is the case, you can hedge your preferred
share downside risk by selling the common shares and holding a tight stop on
the upside pending any news from the company.

Barton Biggs, whose investments in stocks 15 months ago gave his Traxis
Partners LLC a 38 percent gain in 2009, said concern the economy will contract
spurred him to sell almost all his U.S. technology shares this week.

Biggs said he reduced the proportion of bullish bets in his hedge fund by up to
40 percentage points on speculation the withdrawal of government spending will
turn a “soft patch” into a recession. On June 29, Biggs said long investments
made up 70 percent of his fund’s holdings.

Stocks in the U.S. fell for the ninth time in 10 days today after data on jobs
and factory orders added to concern the economic rebound is slowing. Speaking
in a Bloomberg Television interview today, Biggs said “policy mistakes” by
politicians may curb the expansion in U.S. gross domestic product that
economists forecast will be 3.2 percent in 2010. The S&P 500 has retreated 16
percent since April 23.

“I’m worried that we could have not just a soft patch, but a double dip which
lasts two or three quarters and where nominal GDP is only up 2 or 3 percent,
and that’ll have a big effect on profits,” he said. “It’ll scare everybody and
I’m afraid the market goes down another 10 or 15 percent if that happens.”

Government Spending

Biggs said it would be a mistake to rein in government spending at a time when
global economic growth is weakening. The largest economies should aim to cut
deficits in half by 2013, the Group of 20 nations said on June 27 after a
meeting in Toronto.

“The economic numbers that are coming through are very disappointing,” Biggs
said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen. Maybe the politicians respond. We
don’t know.”

The 77-year-old money manager said he’s pared back investments in the U.S.

“I sold stocks pretty aggressively in the U.S. and we had a lot in tech,” Biggs
said. “I’ve taken basically all of it out in the U.S. and we had a broader
exposure to consumer stocks and just, in general, I’ve reduced my net long
position by about 30 or 40 percentage points.”

Biggs comments reflect the pressure on investors as the steepest rally since
the Great Depression started to fizzle in April. Hedge funds lost an average of
2.6 percent in May, according to the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, as the
European debt crisis triggered declines in stocks, the euro and commodities.

Lehman Bankruptcy

It was the biggest decline since November 2008, when hedge funds lost 3 percent
following Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy two months earlier. About
$3.5 billion was withdrawn from hedge funds in April, according to TrimTabs
Investment Research and BarclayHedge estimates.

Traxis was buying household product suppliers, drugmakers and computer
companies at the start of the year, speculating they would prove bargains as
earnings surged, he said in a Dec. 29 interview with Bloomberg. In March, he
said stocks remained cheap relative to forecast earnings and predicted the
global economic recovery would be strong.

“I’ve changed my mind,” he told Bloomberg today. “I’m not wildly bearish, but I
don’t want to have a lot of risk at this point. I’m not putting my money into
anything. I’m raising cash.”

Biggs, who earlier this week predicted S&P 500 companies would earn a combined
$85 to $90 a share in 2010, now says profits may be as low as $70 to $75 if the
economy slows. The low end of that range implies a price-earnings multiple of
14.6 for the S&P 500 today, about equal to its historical average.

Biggs said the second recession in three years isn’t inevitable, comparing the
stock market to the end of the 1982 contraction when the S&P 500 declined 13
percent. An advisory firm founded by another equity bull, Laszlo Birinyi,
published research yesterday drawing the same comparison.

“This is what always happens at this stage of the cycle,” Biggs said. “We are

No wonder the market dropped so much. Although I follow them only periodically
i noticed that IBM MSFT and INTC all seemed to drop below levels I previously
saw them being supported at. The financial were also quite weak. It seems to me
that the heavy hitters are being cautions because they expect Q2 earnings to
underperform, or they are experiencing large outflows in their funds. Now I
wonder what the impact will on the expectation of long term tax going up from
2010 to 2011 on share prices. it cant be positive but i wonder how strong the
negative impact will be. The baltic dry index dropped 40% in june. that just
seems incredible to me. no wonder comnpanies like drys and egle are doing so

Your thinking about FR-preferred was about the same as mine. I had purchased a
largish position when it was last selling in this price range, and sold most
(but unfortunately not all) a few months ago. Also I had a nice in-and-out on
FR stock. I had reduced holdings because I was thinking FR was getting ahead of
itself. No bottom in actual performance was yet showing. And management has
mentioned possibly deferring preferred dividends months ago.

But in this downturn I took a calculated gamble and bought some preferred. I
figured the preferred is less than a 50% chance of no return from here (no
dividends, bk with no payoff on the stock), and if it has any return it should
be a two bagger. Part of that is a poker read of the movement in the preferred.
I see it more a lot of holders who are overly controlled by ratings dumping the
stock. A company like FR, unlike say a drug development company, is not going
to be passing any greatly surprising news out. I do not see the rating change
as providing "news," but rather a confirmation of a deteriorating trend that
was apparent.

Heck, even in bk an REIT has a good chance of providing a decent payoff to the
shareholders.

To buy I did not sell any CWH-D (which I also own), but rather UMH. Decent
stock, and may get back to it.

Of course I could be massively wrong in my assumptions or reasoning. It's
always gambling to invest.

For those who invest in REITs I strongly recommend following the Motley Fool
board for REITS. Some very sharp people post on that board.

Hi Geoffrey -

Good work on your trading of the FR preferred. I was not as nibble as you to
trade either my common shares or any of my preferred series. Because FR seems
to be trading off on company specific news rather than something industry wide,
I am going to be more alert to hedge and/or peel off shares on any sustained
rally.

Of the REITs in trouble, FR's sector industrial & commercial real estate can
probably survive better than those that already suspended their dividends (ie
FCH & BEE).

My only long term concern is with a sustained economic downturn, Free Cash Flow
could fall as tenant vacancy rates increase. This is compounded when the
balance sheet is leveraged with a lot of debt. The CEO is on the right track to
(1) free up capital and deleverage the balance sheet and (2) aggressively get
new tenants and keep the ones they have with more attractive leases.

Like you pointed out, this is not "new" news but just the longer term trend of
the industry. The CEO has quite a bit of latitude to raise capital including
(1) using their secondary 10 million common share "At The Market" offering and
(2) termination of one or more of their private joint ventures and/or (3)
selling one or more of their commercial buildings.

At this particular point in the cycle, the investor can pick up the best deals
as long as the company is a survivor. If I was a new buyer, I would not own the
common shares but rather speculate with the preferred shares.

I will probably be selling the common shares I do own, harvest my loss and look
at trading around my sizable preferred share position to squeeze out as much
gain as possible (including dividends as long as they are paid).

Good luck with your trade and do post any of your observations for this sector
(good or bad) as they develop. We are living in interesting times and it is not
that often we get the opportunity to buy company's at half price. Hopefully
it's due to an inefficient market and scared sellers and not solely to economic
fact.

FR preferreds,

Just because FR called its debt at PAR, I doubt it would pay PAR for its
preferreds. IMO the company is actually obligated to its common shareholders to
try to buyback the preferred well below PAR. Preferreds are quite low on the
totem pole. Dividends can be deferred for quite awhile without any major legal
consequences for the company. With regular debt, if the company doesn't make
the payments they go into bankruptcy, so they certainly have to make the
debtholders good.

If there is a restructuring, the company can probably get a below-par (but
above-market) tender offer to be very well subscribed. Alternatively, the
company could convert the preferred into common. It would be at above market
prices on the preferred, but no guarantee it would be at PAR.

Those comments aside, this does look like an interesting situation, but what
makes you believe the company won't go bankrupt? A recent report I saw showed
the interest coverage at only 1.5, not a huge margin for error. Fitch has noted
the company is nearing covenant compliance thresholds. Also, rolling over $110
million doesn't look trivial given the company market cap is only $277 million.

I would actually love to follow you guys in here, as restructurings can be
immensely profitable, but I'd like to have more facts supporting the assumption
that the company is going to make it.

Thanks,

While I agree the preferreds are low on the totem pole (or soup line as I
prefer to say for restructuring cases) they are higher than common and I think
that is key. If they are going to make it they have to dilute the heck out of
the common, which they cannot do with the preferred.

So it's like the old joke with the 2 guys trying to run away from an angry
bear. the one guy says to the other one - Well you know you cannot outrun a

In restructuring cases the preferred will always outrun the common.

Hi McSweet -

RE FR Preferred

Remember that these preferred series are not w/o risk. However, if one is
willing to hold 12-24 months, a double from current prices is very likely.

The Wall Street Journal dated June 29, 2010 -
Fitch Lowers First Industrial On Limited Financial Flexibility
http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100629-709145.html

From the article:"...The company has 781 properties located in 28 states and
one Canadian province, with its largest markets being Detroit and Chicago.
While the diversification helps insulate First Industrial from regional trends,
several of the company's large markets - including Dallas/Ft. Worth, Atlanta
and Minneapolis/St. Paul -have occupancy rates below 80%.

First Industrial remains on watch for further downgrade, reflecting, in part,
uncertainty as to whether it would suspend a preferred dividend. The company
has stated that if it is not required to pay one to maintain status as a real
estate investment trust, it may elect to suspend some or all the payments for
one or more quarters, which would aid compliance with the fixed-charge coverage
covenant under its existing line of credit.

<u>Fitch also noted that First Industrial's tenant retention rate has been
declining, reaching 67.4% on average for the trailing 12 months ended March 31
from 78.4% the prior year. </u> Cash same-store net operating income slid
during that period, and further declines are seen this year and next...."

From the CEO - Letter To Stock Holders dated April 2, 2010:
http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NDM2NjF8Q2hpbGRJRD0t
XxUeXBlPTM=&t=1
"...The primary goal of our capital plan this year was to reduce our leverage,
and we were successful, reducing our total debt by approximately $200 million
from the beginning of 2009 through February 2010. We achieved this, in part,
through open market purchases of our unsecured notes. As the bond market
rallied due to increased investor confidence in an economic recovery and demand
for yield, it became increasingly difficult for us to repurchase our bonds in
the open market at a discount. So, in February 2010, we completed a tender
offer for approximately $160 million of certain of our unsecured notes.

Through our debt repurchases and tender offer, we also made significant
progress in extending our debt maturities, as reflected in our senior debt
maturity schedule. We began 2009 with $724 million of senior debt maturing
between 2009 and 2012. On March 29, 2010, we announced the redemption of the
remainder of our 7.375% 2011 bonds through the “make whole” provision in the
bond’s indenture. Upon completion of the
redemption, we will have remaining just $225 million of senior debt maturing
through 2012. For 2010, we have just $19 million of debt maturing, $13 million
of which is a mortgage due in December. In addition to these maturities, our
current line of credit of $500 million expires in September 2012....".

====================================================================

Based on the above, the company has done well paying down their debt by $200
million through February 2010. They bought back a lot of their unsecured notes
at a discount but completed the tender (through the call provision) and
purchased the rest (about $160 million) at PAR.

My guess is that they will eventually do this with the preferreds (buying now
at a 50% discount) and calling the rest using the "call" provision that becomes
effective for the J series on 1/15/2011 (6 million shares = $150 million at
PAR) and K series on 8/15/2011 (2 million shares = $50 million at PAR).

The company will probably pay their next dividend in BOTH cash and stock. They
already approved 10 million shares of common to sell "At The Market". This
represents a 20% dilution. If necessary, they could issue 10-30 million more
common shares and then do a reverse split if necessary.

To further deleverage their balance sheet, they can free up some more capital
by terminating all of their private JV partnerships (I think there are 2 or 3
others in the pipe line), sell more assets (CEO discussed selling some vacant
properties) and issue more common shares (perhaps up to 50 million more shares
representing a 50% dilution).

The CEO has a lot of options other than bankruptcy and will do what is needed
to make the FCF work. The real urgent action is to stabilize the rent roll and
stop the declining tenant retention rate. It's really hard in cities like
Detroit but perhaps the worst is over with the auto sector stabilized (vs all
the BK's in 2009).

Like Spekulatius stated, the prefereds are ahead of the common shareholders in
the soup line. The CEO will dilute the common as his backstop plan. That's why
if things begin to turn sour, buy Puts and/or sell short the common to hedge
your position in the preferreds.

I think first an announcement will be made unwinding some or all of the JV
deals. FR seems to be out of their JV deal with CalsTrs (
http://www.firstindustrial.com/na-en/capital-partners/ ) and it is just a
matter of time before the others are closed out too.

Obama Gets a Bum Rap With Anti-Business Charge: Albert R. Hunt

July 5 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama rejected calls last year to
nationalize the big banks, opting instead for market-based stress tests and
injecting more private capital; he disappointed liberals by turning down a
government-run national health-care program, and assists the struggling U.S.
automobile industry to survive as a private enterprise.

In the face of the worst economic crisis since the Depression, corporate
profits since Obama took office have soared 40 percent, and the stock market,
despite the recent slump, has risen more than 27 percent.

Still, corporate chieftains complain the Obama administration is anti-business
and crushing free enterprise with the heavy hand of government. “By reaching
into virtually every sector of economic life, government is injecting
uncertainty into the marketplace and making it harder to raise capital and
create new businesses,” recently charged Ivan Seidenberg, the chairman of New
York-based Verizon Communications Inc., speaking for the Business Roundtable,
the major big-business group in Washington.

This criticism rankles Obama. After Seidenberg’s broadside, the president
instructed National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers to complain to
him. One of the White House rejoinders is that none of the top economic
advisers -- Summers, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner or White House Chief
of Staff Rahm Emanuel -- is considered anti-business or a liberal ideologue;
they have instead incurred the enmity of the political left for being too
centrist, too friendly to business interests.

Roosevelt, Kennedy

When business leaders complain about occasional populist rhetoric, the White
House reminds them of history: Franklin Roosevelt’s broadsides against the
“money changers,” or John F. Kennedy, who after the steel industry raised
prices in 1962, said: “I asked each American to consider what he would do for
his country, and I asked the steel companies. In the last 24 hours we had their
answer.”

Last year, one of the most sophisticated Wall Street leaders privately
complained about anti-banking demagoguery in Washington; he exempted the
president, though he said Obama should rein in Democratic lawmakers the way
Lyndon B. Johnson did. That’s a misreading of history as well as contemporary
politics.

There also is a healthy dose of hypocrisy. Seidenberg complained about huge
budget deficits and at the same time advocated a myriad of corporate tax cuts
that would add billions to the shortfall.

Corporate Tax Rate

The U.S. corporate tax rate is the second-highest among major industrial
countries, the Verizon CEO correctly noted. He neglected to point out that the
effective marginal rate paid by corporations, according to a study by the
administration of President George W. Bush, is within the average of these
countries because of all the loopholes championed by business interests.

Among Seidenberg’s other complaints was a provision in the financial-regulation
bill on proxy voting for corporate boards that he said goes “a step too far.”
This would allow stockholders who meet a high threshold to offer candidates for
the board for a shareholder vote; currently, some directors get their posts
with as little as one-third of the shareholder votes. More democracy for owners
of companies doesn’t seem anti- business.

Business’s Role

For more than 30 years, much of the business community has gotten accustomed to
more deregulation than regulation from Washington, even under Democratic
Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Those days are over, with the
financial crisis, collapses of mines and the BP Plc oil spill. Big business can
simply carp about this or try to fashion middle ground with a White House that
has shown a willingness to take on some of its party’s special interests, such
as teachers’ unions.

More than a few nonpartisan business leaders have reservations about the
health-care and financial-regulation initiatives without the exaggerated
charges. There’s a solid business case to be made against the administration
for dragging its feet on trade, tempered only by the recent embrace of the
accord with South Korea.

And there are important signals the president should be sending or changing. In
appearances before the Business Roundtable, he gave canned speeches and then
declined to take questions. The business leaders resent that; they have a
point.

CEO in Cabinet

Moreover, this is the first administration in memory not to have a corporate
CEO in its senior ranks. Geithner and Summers notwithstanding, that sends a
message. With the initial Obama economic team breaking up there ought to be a
substantive spot for an articulate, credible CEO such as former Xerox Corp.
Chairman Anne Mulcahy.

The economic messaging, to business and others, remains muddled. Some prominent
business leaders who are Democrats believe the president privately is
disdainful of the business community. Even if that isn’t the case -- it
probably isn’t -- Obama should realize that’s what he too often conveys.

A healthier, if sometimes adversarial, relationship also requires major changes
by business leaders, starting with the Business Roundtable. Their critiques
need to be more balanced, including calling out Republicans for charges such as
Obama is moving the country toward “secular socialism.”

The looming fiscal crisis offers an opportunity. The Business Roundtable has
promised “constructive suggestions” about the need for deficit reduction and
entitlement overhaul.

Call for Sacrifice

If the result is simply, let’s reduce the deficit on the backs of the working
class while providing more tax breaks to wealthier Americans and corporations,
they’ll just be one more group of special pleaders. A more thoughtful, balanced
suggestion -- to the political right of where Obama and most Democrats will be
-- that entails some sacrifice from their ranks would afford credibility.
That’s true, too, for the president, if he tackles tough issues on the
entitlement side, like cutting back on the growth of Social Security.

Many Middle Americans really do despise Wall Street, BP and the oil companies
and bitterly resent the outsourcing of jobs. That’s not a product of the
policies or rhetoric of Obama or Washington politicians. It’s because they
genuinely believe that in these difficult times, fat cats are privileged and
protected while they’re getting the shaft. It’s in the interests of both the
Obama administration and the business community to appreciate and address this
reality.

Hi EKS,

Thank you for the reply. This is definitely worth a look, and I agree it is
safer to be a preferred holder than a common holder.

I would also reiterate that I very strongly doubt the company will call the
preferreds at PAR. It is a very good type of debt for them to have. They can
defer dividends on the preferreds for six quarters without any legal
consequences and even then, the preferred just gets to elect two board members.
And the preferreds debt never matures, so they don't have to worry about
refinancing. And the coupons are not outrageously high.

If there is a restructuring, they most likely convert the preferred to equity
and/or tender for it below PAR, but at a premium to current market.

Hi Madharry

I am not too sure of the different dividend payment options with or without the
REIT status. The preferred is a cumulative preferred so they could stop payment
altogether (under the terms of the security) but any future dividends paid must
also include all the amounts missed to bring the payments to date current.

Two things I know the company is considering are (1) use common shares to help
pay dividends as this conserves cash and is an easy way to issue more shares
and (2) don't screw the preferred shareholders as this would cut off a viable
future funding source for the company and make any restructuring much more
difficult.

I suspect that worst case (1) under a bankruptcy or (2) non REIT restructure or
(3) even under the current REIT structure is that the Preferred shareholder
would be paid off in common shares. The question is at what rate? For #2 & #3
it would probably be 100% on the dollar w/ the cumulative unpaid dividend
amounts included. The common shareholder gets diluted big time. Payment would
be made in "current" common shares or shares in a new restructured company.

If #1 it could be 50% on the dollar (or less) in either cash or shares in a new
restructured company which would be determined by a bankruptcy judge. The
common shares would be wiped out.

When DRYs had to raise capital to meet bank covenants they did three stock
offerings in four months which eventually diluted the common shareholder 4:1.
Their last offering included a hybrid convertible bond that further screwed the
common shareholder but satisfied all the holders of the long term debt. The
debt holders eventually got back all of their capital, all earned interest and
lots of "diluted" common shares that juiced their total return.

I believe any restructure w/o a bankruptcy judge must pay off all bond and
preferred shareholders the total value of the encumbered note(s) (plus interest
and/or unpaid dividends specific to the note contract terms). This payment can
be made in cash or equivalent equities. I am not too sure if the BOD can breech
the debt contracts w/o potential shareholder class litigation from the note
holders. The easy way out is to just print more common shares and pay everybody
off w/ diluted shares (until the common shares are worthless).

I am not too worried about the FR Preferred but it looks like above average
"selling" volume has started on the FR common shares. My Schwab service shows
the FR common shares as "HTB" (Hard To Borrow) so it is probably expensive to
start shorting this stock too. You probably have to pay Schwab a certain
percent to borrow the stock to short if not available in Schwab's inventory.

Many of the REITs were off today implying some concerns by the market in the
total debt (ie leverage) still used in this sector.

From:MCsweet
EKS,

Based off of my experience, if the common shareholders are wiped out, typically
the preferred shareholders get wiped out too. For a current example, look at
the trading of the Fannie and Freddie preferreds. They are not holding up any
better than the common because they will likely never get paid anything.

Basically, if the senior debt holders have to take any amount of loss, in
theory the preferreds should get totally wiped out. That is because senior debt
holders are completely senior to the preferred and in theory should get paid
100% of principle before the preferred get a dime. In practice, the preferreds
might be able to do a little better in order to expedite the bankruptcy process
but they will almost never be paid out at PAR in the event of a bankruptcy.

Parceling out equity to the debt and preferred holders is a possibility, but if
the market valuation of the restructured equity is less than the value of the
senior debt (hence senior debt holders taking a loss), then in theory the
preferreds should not get equity and be wiped out. This is all figured out in
bankruptcy court.

I suggest you try and get a copy of the book Distressed Debt Analysis:
Strategies for Speculative Investors. It costs $100, so maybe check a library?

I have only studied this distressed debt analysis as a hobby, if there are any
true professionals, feel free to jump in and explain this better (and/or
correct what I am saying).

Did you sell your MRO or TOT to buy your CVX? I am looking at peeling off some

After my proposed COP trade, I will have equal amounts of COP and CVX and my

RE: Water Utilities

Hi Paul -

This was in our local paper today and got me thinking that there are many local
municipalities having budget problems and privatizing their water systems
(where possible) might benefit those companies acquiring the municipal
franchise. Could be a "Value" opportunity.

San Jose considering privatizing its municipal water system
Updated: 07/05/2010 10:12:19 PM PDT
http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_15445143

From the article:"...The plan, although still in the early stages, could mean a
windfall of $50 million or more for the city, although it almost certainly
would result in higher water bills for some San Jose residents.

"I'm trying to be creative about balancing the budget. This is an obvious
potential source of money, and I have to look at it seriously," said San Jose
Mayor Chuck Reed on Friday...."

I think SJW is the proposed buyer that sent the letter to the major. I have
discussed SJW over the years and they remain profitable and own a lot of
valuable assets (mostly land). They would make the perfect operator if they
could acquire the City's water assets on good terms.

"...A month later, a potential buyer came forward.

The San Jose Water Co. is a privately held company that provides water to 1
million people in Los Gatos, Saratoga, Campbell, Monte Sereno, parts of
Cupertino and 80 percent of San Jose., The company's president, Richard Roth,
sent a letter of interest to Reed in April offering to pay $54 million to buy
the city's water system outright. He also said his company would be willing, as
part of a sale, to support a 2 percent "franchise fee" on all San Jose Water
customers that would provide the city with $4 million a year...."

================================================================

I am not too sure what the exact play would be but city's around the nation may
look to San Jose's solution to privatize their water services. This would be a
once in a life time opportunity for a few of these mid sized companies to jump
in and acquire these "water" franchises and help the selling cities solve their
short term financial short falls.

Here are a few possible candidates for review.

follow SJW or AWR. I sold out of AWR, and I guess I've just forgotten to go
back and look at these two.

For value buys now, I like AWK and SBS. SBS -- Brazilian with a low p/e. I'm
just holding on to my SBS shares; I suppose I should look closer to see if I
ought to add. I've built a full position in http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AWK

again. (I bought some shares as high as $21.49 in May). In earlier posts here
on AWK, I've mentioned the reasons the stock appeals to me.

PICCO gets written up occasionally by guys who like to do sum-of-parts analyses
to conclude or allude that a stock is undervalued. Here's a recent write-up
that does that for PICCO:

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/HardHit-PICO-Is-Offering-Big-tsmp-3474957379.html
x=0&.v=1

Maybe PICCO's a buy or an add at current low price. I haven't decided for me
yet. I'll hold on to the shares I already have though.

I looked at Veolia (VE) over the weekend. The price has come down to near lows.
The company is such a behemoth -- involved in several types of utilities, has
300,000 employees -- it's a little difficult for me to decide what to do (hold
only or add more shares) with this French-based company. Maybe just watch for
now to see if stock goes lower.

Basically I'm intending to keep positions in water utilities because they
provide a vital service - supplying drinking water being a VERY vital activity.
-g-
Some of these companies have a long history of paying increasing dividends, and
that appeals to me since I am planning and hoping to hold these stocks for
years. While the sector is government regulated, it's hard to see bureaucrats
crippling the companies by reducing their profits and jeopardizing the water
supply quantity and/or its quality to their constituents.

I always hear of rumblings that municipalities should take over the
publicly-traded utilities in their area instead of having their utilities be
run, often from afar, by a large corporation. And the other way too: that the
government-owned ones should be privatized because corporate ownership will
make them more efficient and thus save the municipalities money. I don't know
if there's a trend here or not; I'm just buying and holding these stocks based
on their past history and the numbers in front of me.

re CVX - my position is a very small tracking position. i have not sold any of
my oil plays MRO, TOT, E but I did exit NE on the recent bounce.

I like CVX quite a bit, i think the company is improving relative to XOM for
example and they have shown above average production and reserve growth
recently and are projected to do so going forward. XOM's reserve growth has
been more on the NG side (even without the XTO acquisition) and that is a much
tougher business with lower ROA.

I am sort of lost on XOM, and the XTO acquisition at full price seems like a
poor allocation of capital to me. I believe that CVX will outperform XOM and
the valuation gap between the two stocks will eventually close.

Hi Paul -

RE: Tortoise Power & Energy Infra:TPZ

Here is an interesting site that provides the NAV for many different Funds. TPZ
came up on the list as selling at about a 7% discount to the funds NAV (based
on yesterday's closing price of $20.5/share). You want to look at the
Premium/Discount calculation based on the prior day's closing price (top left
of screen).

http://www.cefconnect.com/Details/Summary.aspx?ticker=TPZ&AspxAutoDetectCookieS
pport=1

The site has a Fund sorter feature that allows you to rank their database of
funds by different attributes. Here is the page using the sort by "NAV
Discount". (Note: TTO comes up at the top of the list with a 43.96%
Premium/Discount. Not too sure what this means but may signal further
investigation.)

http://www.cefconnect.com/Sorter/FundSorter.aspx

It seems when the spread is large, it always has been a good time to buy a few
more shares. I like the monthly income generated from their portfolio (around
7.3%). Their management fee is reasonable at 0.6%. I do not know if there are
any other hidden fees they charge but this funds seems like a good alternative
to my MM fund that pays 0.25%.

I have a GTC order to buy more shares at $20.50/share. Fund goes xdividend each
month around the 20th.

Madharry, I'll take a few shares of your AAB.to at current price.

Gold's dropped a bit from six weeks ago, so one assumes Aberdeen's net asset
value has too, down now some amount from the company's estimate of $1.19 last
month. Of course, AAB stock price is down too.

Given the company's success with its earlier investments and the company's
efforts to replicate that success, and the fact that Aberdeen has a royalty
stream to provide some income, and that the stock price seems like it's far
below asset value, I'll take a few shares.

As pointed out by Spekulatius though, it does seem if the company's looking for
places to invest funds, one wonders why they're not just buying back the
supposedly very undervalued AAB stock.

I just sold the FR-K at 15.60 that I purchased last week for 12.40. One
advantage of being a small fish is that one can slip in and buy and sell a
thinly traded stock like FR-K.

Probably should have held longer but so it goes.

What do you think about FR itself now, selling in the 4's? Price is down a lot,
and there is not much new in the downgrades. S&P rates it a buy with $10 price
target. The big concern is about rolling over debt due next year (around $300m
I believe), but I think they have the resources one way or another to probably
make it.

Anyone have opinions on FR at its current price?

Hi Jurgis

S&P Downgrades First Industrial Realty On Liquidity Concerns
http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100708-710817.html

From the article:"... Standard & Poor's Ratings Services downgraded First
Industrial Realty Trust Inc. (FR) deeper into junk territory, saying the
industrial-property developer has inadequate liquidity and a small cushion
under some credit facility covenants.

The move came a week after Fitch Ratings took the same action, citing similar
concerns...."

=================================================================

My news service alert had additional information not included in the article.

"... Additionally, we would lower the rating on the preferred securities
further if the likelihood of suspension increases. We would consider raising
our rating if the company's liquidity profile improves sufficiently to meet at
least 12 months of capital needs, covenant pressure abate, and or derived FCC
improves to the high-1x area...."

S&P also stated "...The company has modest near-term capital needs until a
September 2011 debt maturity, and its sizable portfolio, which has good
geographic and tenant diversity, remains largely unencumbered..."

Trading on the preferred series was heavy especially on the Series J up 16.79%
to $16.00/share. 168,200 shares traded , 8x the average daily volume with a
high of $17.35/share. There was definitely new buying on the J series. The K
series was up 15% to 15.80/share.

A lot of the volume on this preferred traded today after the S&P debt downgrade
(my alert was at 13.33 EST) at prices between $15.50/share - $17.35/share.
Therefore, at least for now. investors seem to be satisfied that the preferred
dividends will continue to be paid through September 2011 because of FR's
modest near term capital needs.

The common stock did sell off a bit after the announcement by S&P but no lower
than where it traded yesterday.

The easy money for this trade has been made (3 trading days up 40%!). I may
start peeling off some shares at the $17.25/share - $17.90/share rather than
trying to hedge my position for the unlikely event of a default by shorting the
common stock or buying Puts.

I suspect the preferred series (both K&J) will settle back to the $16.60/share
- $18.00/share.

Hi Grommit -

Re: Empire District Electric Co. (EDE)

One of my larger dividend plays, I hedged 1/2 of my position today selling the
Dec $20 calls for $0.65/share. I also should receive two dividend payments of
$0.32/share per quarter (September 3rd Qtr & December 4th Qtr). The 2010
analysts estimates would give a 15.6 PE at $20.00/share and for 2011 the PE
would be 13.8. This is getting a bit high for my comfort zone especially since
Yahoo has the EDE dividend payout ratio at 106% (this is based on lagging
earnings).

The company did get approval for a July 2010 rate increase for their Kansas
electric customers but I believe it was only 60% of what they had asked. There
are pending rate approvals in process to accelerate the recovery of capital
improvement projects which will help further support the current divided.
However, I do not see the company increasing their dividend any time soon.

Therefore, by writing the December $20 calls, I can increase my overall return
by 6% and if the stock gets called away, it becomes a source of funds for
reinvestment.

With a 7% dividend yield, a 6% call premium generated from writing the covered
calls and a 11% potential capital gain based on my avg cost (if the stock is
called away at $20.00/share), I can lock in a 22% return on one half of my EDE
position by December 17, 2010. I may even be able to write the calls again
after December 17, 2010 to further enhance my overall return.

In the current environment, I prefer to stay in good paying utility companies
(both regulated & unregulated) with PE's at 11 or lower with overall debt
levels supported by current cash flows and/or non strategic assets that could
be sold to reduce debt if required (eg. NG reserves owned by unregulated
division of a utility, wholly owned NG pipeline subsidiary similar to what EDE
owns & operates etc.).

I think it pays to be on the defense in this environment. It's still not
absolutely clear to me that a double dip can be avoided.

For the same reason that BDC managements are always trying to get
unitholder to approve sales of shares at a discount to NAV. Management
interests arent sufficiently alligned with shareholders. It's much more in
managment's interest to put funds into new companies than to buy their own
shares. they get seats on boards free options in the individual companies etc.
The big money for both management and shareholders is when one of these new
companies becomes a public company but especially for management they then cash

I doubt she got any blessing from GS for the numbers. I think she needed a

The weekend Brocade rumour
Three potential buyers - July 9, 2010

From the article:"...It may be just a fabric(sic)ation but rumour central has

Brocade...".

===============================================================

There is value in the company if they can get rid of all their past
"management" baggage. Even though it's been almost two years since the
conviction of the CEO for option fraud, the company still continues to have
ties with some of their old BOD and past management.

If a potential buyer can be indemnified for any past management and BOD
dealings, there may just be enough value left in the company (at the current
price) to look at an offer as the article suggests.

The recent option activity does not signal any hint of a buy out offer. There
is still a lot of October option holders betting the stock stays in the
$5.00/share range rather than moving up into the $6.00/share area.

Several years ago, IBM was rumored to have offered $10.00/share but the deal
got nixed when the Option backdating fraud surfaced.

Hi Voodooist -

RE: Nokia Corporation (NOK)

I have been in the position with my earliest buy in 2003 at $12.70/share. I
have added shares in the $12.00/share range with my last add in January 26,
2010. So far it's been a looser except for the dividend. Everybody has written
them off over Apple but NOK continues to hold a 30% market share for mobile
phones (not smart phones) in the world. They have been late (and continue to
slip) with releasing a smart phone on any competitive level with the other
smart phone developers.

Based on the value proposition, NOK definitely meets this criteria. Their
forward PE is 9.6 and they only have $2.00/share debt and generate a
$1.00/share cash flow.

I like their joint ventures with Siemens where they build the wireless
infrastructure systems that include the base stations and all the other
electronics to operate a wireless network. They have projects going on in China
any other 3rd world locations. They do not make too much money with these
systems but it helps them sell the handsets with the telco partners that run
the wireless networks.

I noticed that Jurgis mentioned NOK in his last stock list update. I am not
sure if he still maintains his position. I probably should look at averaging
down at current levels but I also own positions in Siemens, MOT, Intel, MSFT
(w/ their Mobile 7 OS) which also participate in this sector.

Based on value, NOK is probably the best buy in my group. I am under water on
my current holdings but was able to sell a lot of my old shares around
$28.00/share in 2007. Don't write off NOK too soon as they always seem to
recover at least since I have been investing in the company starting in the
late 1990's. You just have to know when to sell your shares and when to load up
your inventory again. At the $8.00/share level, it just might be that time to
load up your inventory.

Too much issues for me, imo. It's not hard to find decently prices companies
with reasonable track record, so i don't feel like picking through a pile of
dung like AVNM to find value.

MYRX - it does trade below cash but the question is how good is MYRX pipeline
because that is where the cash will be spent. I don't think the spinoff from
MYGN is a good sign - it means that the former management does not believe in
the pipeline any more otherwise they would have found a different way to
monetize (straight sell, JV, licensing deal). FWIW I used to deal a lot with
biotechs many years ago but it does seem like a looser game overall. The few
gems of course can yield outsized returns but most will just dilute their
shareholder without end to keep the business (or lack thereoff) going.

Overall spinoffs have not worked well for me. Even the bankruptcy cases that I
sort of follow like SSCC seem pretty questionable from a value perspective - it
seems that so many hedge funds are into distressed assets that the prices for
those don't make it worthwhile any more.

As for AVNW - i just don't know. The stock is probably oversold due to the

me that there is a high possibility of LT underperformance.

Lot's of stocks can be traded and I do that as well but I prefer to trade the

re NOK - I am aware of the fact that the North American phone market is an
anomaly on the world and NOK position is much stronger elsewhere.

In the US NOK seems to have lost the war totally and is almost no-existing. The
buzz is around the IPhone but increasingly with the Android phones. it does
seem that GOOG has created a real winner with the Android OS and I think it
will take over Nokia's Symbian.

I do think that the whole phone market is going to be an entire new game - with
winners and loosers. NOK looks like a looser but they may be able to hold onto
more market share than their lousy stock price suggest. For me, that's a hard
bet to make, since I see so much competition - a myriad of Android phones (new
names like HTC, GOOG), Palm may be revived by HP, incumbent RIM and of course
the IPhone. My most likely outcome for NOK is that it will become a value trap.

re SMTB -

All you really need to know is written here:

My advice is the same than with other crappy banks - buy in after the capital
raise. SMTB looks so bad I am not sure they can pull off to raise enough money
to get them over the hump. This could easily become a case for the FED's.

OMG. Still looks undervalued to me. Erratic earnings history; now low p/stated
bv. I've just a few OMG shares, will average down a little with a small add
tomorrow.

Company continues to make acquisitions diversifying its business from its old
total focus on berryllium.

If good times ever return to this company, I'll bet stock will sell again at
least 1x stated book value (vs. .6 now). And assuming stated bv doesn't
decline, I am intending to hold for three years to see if that happens.

I thought the last earnings conference call was quite positive.

Been following the stock for quite a long time and certainly under the right
conditions, the stock is capable of significant
upside.

Eagle Picher hasn't added much in terms of basically break even results so far
but its a fairly new acquisition and the Co. basically considers it a call
option at the price they paid for a foothold into some pretty dynamic markets.

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: IGK/ISF/IDG, NRF-A/B, UVIC,
EBIX, GPOR, FR-J/K, AEH, COPJF, GILD, RINO, UEPS. CSGH fell out due to price
decline.

New positions: WUHN, GOOG, NCTY
Positions increased: MSFT, GRVY, FR-J/K, UVIC, SDTH, IACAF
Positions reduced: PKX
Positions eliminated: CF, OSG

More action recently.
New positions widely diverge in style: Buffettology GOOG vs pure cash-net-net
NCTY and cheap on P/B and P/S WUHN. :) All are small initial positions. NCTY is
similar situation to GRVY except that it is losing cash, but then it is trading
at almost 1/2 net cash. WUHN results are not that good and stock is thinly
traded, but the company is very cheap if they can perform.

Position increases are pretty much boring adds at better prices. FR-J/K was
discussed here extensively.

I decided to sell some PKX, since I am not sure about its valuation and
business climate going forward. It's not expensive, but not cheap either. CF is
another position where I am not sure where the business is going and how their
acquisition integration proceeds. OSG is more of the same - not clear prospects
although low valuation.

LOAN update,

The company is considering strategic alternatives. I am raising my sell
targets, as there may be a catalyst on the horizon.

I'd be ecstatic if the company could get anything near book value.

Spekulatius, SMTB up over 10% today. over 13% earlier in the day. remains a
mystery to me. Not discounting your sage advice.
