<< resulted in a step of the calculation being skipped, (the one where the
liabilities get subtracted)>>

If you're going to make a calculation error in valuation, that's about the
biggest one you can make. (I think I recall Graham saying discount the assets,
assume the liabilities are real.)

We've all made mistakes. The only unforgivable ones are the ones that you don't
learn from and make twice. But the real mistake would be if you rationalize
holding these stocks you never would have bought if your model worked properly.
I've bought stocks on erroneous analysis and then found another reason to own
them and it usually wound up a big loss. (often the mistake was caught by
somebody on this thread - I remember Mike Burry catching my error in Mattel and
I didn't listen to him, and lost a lot of money.)

Sell the stocks tomorrow and don't look at them again. If they go up, that's
random - it has nothing to do with the reason you bought them. Then fix your
model and find one good net-net investment. You'll find they're not so easy to
find when you subtract liabilities.

I looked for NCA < 0.667 of stock price. (235 stocks survived)
I applied additional filters to reduce the list:
stock price > 2
market cap > $10 M
not traded on OTCBB
current ratio > 1.5 (this eliminates some companies that
have both huge current assets and huge current liabilities, but a small
difference in those values)
eps TTM > 0 (this eliminates about 2/3 of the remaining stocks)

Here are the survivors. Dollar amounts, except for share price, are in
millions. (The market caps are typically only $10 - $40 M.)

rjm,

When in doubt check the competition. Blockbuster amortizes their video costs on
a 3 month basis. Blockbuster looks pretty twisty also, but at least 3 months
strikes me as being more in line with the reality that rental income from
movies drops off very hard in a very short time. You have to learn how to
translate language in SEC filings. When a statement starts with "we believe",
it's an open invitation to lie. When GAAP rules change, it's to plug up loop
holes in existing accounting treatments. Management is certain to be miffed at
not being able to cook the books like the good ol' days, but the idea is to
give a more fair presentation than what the good ol' days represented. The
negative working capital statement agrees with my calculation that tangible
book is effectively less than zero.

As far as your buddy on Yahoo is concerned; he's either a liar, a fool or a
paid hypester. The statements about free cash flow and debt repayment are
absurd at best. My tolerance level for that kind of garbage has gotten rather
low over the past several years. Yahoo used to be rowdy but fun, now it's just
a cess pool of hypesters and bashers whose sole purpose in life is to lead
lambs to the slaughter. I find the practice offensive.

About Blockbuster, etc., we are near the tipping point where DVD's will be the
item rented. My evidence, is that I bought a DVD player, and since I am always
late to such things as cell phones, CD players (still have the vinyl), that is
some indication that the relative benefit is there for changing over your
equipment. DVD makes a lot more sense than video as a method of playing movies.
A store can carry a lot more DVD's than VCR's in the space allotted. My guess
is that the studio's like them better, in that cost of production is lower.

It is now practical to rent through the mail. 10 DVD's for 35 bucks, postage
included. Better selection than you will find in your local video store. You
have to plan ahead a little, but then you don't have to travel to the store.

So, overall, I'd stay away from video stores unless the company was debt free
and the cash per share was growing at a very rapid pace, say 20% of share price
per year. Could be wrong about their rapid obsolescence, but that's how I'm
betting.

And about Yahoo, it is caveat emptor like no other market in America. Still, I
wade through it cautiously. I wish they had the capacity to look through 10
posts at once like SI has. Sure 5 would be SPAM, 2 obvious hucksters, and one

The Net-Net Method

The following excerpt is from Charles Brandes' book, "Value Investing Today".
Graham was an acquaintance of Brandes.

Graham's most famous theory was that investors should buy stocks at prices of
no more than two-thirds of the company's current assets (cash and equivalents
on hand, including immediately salable inventory), minus all liabilities
(including off-balance-sheet liabilities such as capital leases or unfunded
pension liabilities). Nothing was paid for permanent assets such as property,
plant and equipment, or intangible assets such as goodwill. Graham held that if
a company traded at two-thirds of this ammount and was profitable, then
investors needed no other yardstick.

"What about companies that qualified except for current losses?" I asked
Graham. Those companies, he believed, were dangerously situated. Losses
constantly burn up corporate assets and could incinerate the appropriate margin
of safety.

Today, elevated valuations in the U.S. equity market make it nearly impossible
to find a profitable compay selling at a one-third discount to the net-net
current assets. However, using ...databases..,value investors can screen
for those companies with the lowest net-net asset ratios.

Geoffrey,

It's hard saying where technology will be in a few years. We have cable
available in my area now with 2 meg download speeds at $28 a month. I've been
paying $15 a month for a 56K connection plus an extra $25 a month for a second
phone line. I figure I'll make the switch sometime in the near future. At those
kind of download speeds, it starts making downloading a movie online more
realistic. From what I understand, cable connections are still the exception
rather than the rule in most of the country, but I suspect it will be pretty
universally available fairly soon.

A few years ago I was guessing there would be a lot of start ups in an online
movie market. Now I think it's more likely going to be the movie companies
selling direct to the public. At least I can't think of any reason off hand why
they would want to cut a middle man in on the action. Maybe the rental outfits
will get a piece of the action for awhile, but a look at some of the balance
sheets doesn't leave me with much confidence they could raise the capital to
put something together short of Chapter 11. Bankruptcy is about the only way
they could get out of all the leased property, blow out the old inventory, and
get cleaned up enough to attract some venture capital. It may not happen that
way but it strikes me as the path of least resistance.

There should be some stock bets on the outcome a few years down the line, but I
doubt any of them will be value plays. Should be interesting to see how it all
plays out though.

Are you going to watch a movie on your computer? I doubt that the masses will.
As for Video On Demand, I doubt that this will be a huge success for the
following reasons.

First, it costs more than renting. Secondly, I don't like being held captive by
the cable company by having to rent (monthly) THEIR box to download THEIR
movies. And, the cable box is just another piece of equipment that has to be
plugged in between all of the other equipment. Lastly, the success this year
(and years to come) of DVD players have cemented renting media for another
decade. The only change is that the format will graduate from VHS to DVD's.
They just built a new blockbuster down the road from me and it is packed most
of the time.

Dislclaimer: I do not own stock in any video/dvd rental companies. Just my
observations.

This commentary and 50 cents will get you a cup of coffee so take it at its

I don't know if you're hanging around here at all anymore but I'm hoping to

at 25 back in July), will you consider buying back after the stock starts
trading better? Assuming the value picture hasn't changed of course. Or do you
have a trouble buying a stock after
its moving up?

Scott,

I was thinking more along the lines of a few years down the road when I'd be
willing to bet a person will be able to go to a web site, pick from a long list
of movies, and then download their choice with a credit card.

From what I understand, for the cable Internet service there's no box required,
just a cable modem and a network card. There's an added advantage to where I
am. There are two cable companies with Internet service and one of them is not
AT&T (aka TCI). I can't argue with anyone who doesn't like cable companies. I
tried TCI before AT&T bought them out. Somehow paying $600 a year for 120
channels of bad programming with 20 minutes of commercials an hour didn't seem
like much of an improvement over 5 channels of bad programming with 20 minutes
of commercials an hour.

Back to value investing. I noticed someone mentioned VIAN as turning up on a
screen they ran recently. Since it also happened to be on a list of things I've
been looking at, I impression is it seems to pass the sniff test (doesn't smell
too bad). The balance sheet looks clean without any GAAP twists thrown in. It's
trading close to cash per share with no debt to speak of. Checking the PRs,
they warned on Q4 with a sizable miss and it looks like revenue has dropped off
sharply from what they were doing around Q2. There's some reliance on a small
number of big clients for a good size chunk of revenue and a certain amount of
exposure to dot coms. They approved a $5 million stock buy back, but I couldn't
find anything that showed they've been buying. Supposedly there will be some
guidance with a CC when they report in a couple weeks. I'm curious if anyone
else has looked at this one and what kind of feel they had for it. I almost
think I could like it if the forward looking statements sound halfway decent
and a retest of the 52 week low were to show up and hold. Any opinions on this
one?

reasons - new lows, better values available, taking profits - and their
replacements have done well. But there were some nice turnarounds and continued
runs in those stocks after the sells (all higher than at sell I think). You're

Re the future watching of movies, Don, your scenario is reasonable except for
three things. Relatively few people have cable modem service, over 3 years
after I got it. Secondly, people generally do not want to watch a movie on a
computer monitor typically not in their living room, and wireless or other
connections between a computer and TV may be years away. Finally, people often
want to watch a video as an impulse purchase. It will also be some time before
quality streaming video with controls is available over the Internet. Quality
VOD over existing cable is being delivered today (Austin, Hawaii, Tampa, and
soon many others) - your scenario is 5-10 years away.

If you took just a little time addressing my points and analyzing the latest
10-Q, you'd see the total liabilities declined significantly. Even though
long-term debt increased, this was more than offset by a decrease in other
liabilities. Thus, the fact that long-term debt has now decreased by $4
millions should not be a surprise.

Given a market cap of only $46.6 million, MOVI has bought back $5.7 million in
shares and expanded its store base. Given this context, I think decreasing
long-term debt by $4 million is pretty darn good. To me this demonstrates
strong free cash flow, implying your criticism of amortization policies is
off-base.

That being said, if you believe the video and DVD rental business is going to
be unprofitable within the next couple of years, than obviously MOVI is a poor
stock to own. This is a valid criticism (valid, though I disagree with it).
However, I believe the pontificating criticisms of the current economics
demonstrate a lack of rigorous analysis, something that annoys me to no end.

Don:

My opinion is get the cable modem, you will like it. But dont be fooled by the
download speed best I get is 80kbytes/sec. Also, (and correct me if I am wrong)
be aware that as the cable company loads up, the speeds go down. Limited
bandwidth on the cable.
Also, if you think about it, it is highly unlikely that VOD will be a threat in
the next 5 years. Bandwidth isnt their yet, (although that depends on level of
video compression viewer will tolerate) and the cable companies are cash
strapped so investment in increasing bandwidth isnt likely soon. imho
Finally, I dont confuse press releases with balance sheets. However, if the
company releases information that is material I see no reason not to include it
in the analysis. I do appreciate your commentary on Movi, however as it has
caused me to take a more critical look at their inventory and method of
accounting for the same.

On the value front, one stock I like is HKF, hancock fabrics. Insider buying,
stock buybacks, generates decent amount of cash and earnings and trades, near
book. Although they have some debt, it looks like they are making serious
inroads in paying it off. Any thoughts on this one ? I am long and will

From:Don Earl
Chris,

Right now my wish list on stocks is pretty picky. I took a quick look at the
profile on HKF and in any other market, I'd probably pull up at least the last
10Q to see what's there. There's a Hancock Fabric in my area. I went there once
when I needed some vinyl fabric for a car project I was working on. The sales
people were friendly and helpful and it looked like they had a good selection
of just about everything. My only complaint on HKF from a quick look is the
lack of cash. From what I saw of the store I visited, I'll guess most of book
is made up of inventory. I'm focused more on companies where book is mainly
cash and owned real estate in this market since it's possible to do so, and am
pretty much sticking to companies I can buy into at or below cash where I
basically get the business and other assets for free.

I'm not 100% sure what to make of the economy. Obviously energy prices are
putting a dent in everyone's budget. In my area residential electricity prices
are getting hit with a 43% surcharge and large manufacturers are getting hit up
to 78%. It isn't any mystery why manufacturing output was down in the most
recent report. Some of the plants are on a deal where they get cheap rates as
long as there is enough to go around, but they can be cut off if there isn't.
Alcola shut down for several weeks during the last cold snap. Gas prices seem
to be coming down, but they still aren't back where they should be. I still
think a lot of what's hitting the market is pure FUD combined with the
implementation of new accounting standards, but at the same time, it isn't
possible to ignore the fact that energy issues are having an impact on the
economy. I suspect the situation is more or less temporary and should level out
by the end of the first or second quarter, but I also don't see any reason not
to target companies with enough liquidity to weather a soft economy for a
longer period if they need to. The way I see it with something like 16,000
publicly held companies to pick from, there's bound to be at least a few that
will meet just about anyone's investment objectives. With the beating the
market took in the last 4 months it's a bargain hunters paradise.

There are obviously a lot of different opinions on what constitutes value.
Value plays usually mean you have to give up something to avoid paying a
premium on the stock. Out of favor sectors, assets, earnings, bear markets,
analyst downgrades, losses, restructuring charges, missed expectations, etc. At
a certain point, I think it comes down to personal preference on what factor/s
to give up to find value. I happen to like low/no debt and lots of cash. I also
intentionally look for places where sentiment is unusually low and prefer
situations where there have been losses and a recent restructuring. That's the
typical set up for turnaround plays. It's probably a subset of value investing,
but it's the area I'm personally most comfortable with. I don't recommend it
one way or the other and only mention it to help explain why some things don't
fit what I do. The one thing I do feel strongly about is that whatever method a
person does use, it's important to check the profiles against the filings to
make sure what you see is what you get.

Lots of stocks go through the roof which don't have any fundamental value
whatsoever. VOXX and MOVI could fall into that category even though I don't
consider either one a value play by any yardstick by which such things are
measured. IMO those kind of bets are based on the assumption that enough spin
and hype will eventually produce suckers who will take the stock off your hands
at a higher price. The danger doesn't come from it not being a value play but
from not knowing it's not a value play.

Hello Don!

A few posts back you mentioned VIAN for consideration. As you know, it's NetNet
value is right about its current selling price, and the lion's share of that
value is in cash.

From the most recent 10Q filings I get the following:
". CAPITAL STOCK On June 23, 1999, Viant closed its initial public offering of
common stock at a public offering price of $8 per share. The proceeds to Viant
from the offering were $50.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and
offering costs.
On December 13, 1999, Viant closed its secondary public offering of common
stock at a public offering price of $47.3125 per share. The proceeds to Viant
from the offering were $120.3 million, net of underwriting discounts and
offering costs.
On February 24, 2000, Viant, effectuated a two-for-one stock split in the form
of a 100% stock dividend to stockholders of record on February 8, 2000. All
share data in this report has been restated to reflect this stock split
retroactively for all periods presented...." 

Even though they also go on to say:...The Company's Board of Directors has
authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of Viant's outstanding common
stock. Under the stock repurchase program, Viant may purchase shares from time
to time over the next 24 months in the open market....

My question is: "How comfortable should one be with a company that went back to
the well so soon after its IPO?"

Most of that cash apparently came from selling stock and not from the business
model.

Speaking of the business model, their report also says:
..."THE INTERNET PROFESSIONAL SERVICES MARKET IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND HAS LOW
BARRIERS TO ENTRY. IF WE CANNOT EFFECTIVELY COMPETE, OUR REVENUES MAY DECLINE

OUR REVENUES MAY DECREASE IF GROWTH IN THE USE OF THE INTERNET DECLINES..."

In light of the recent major cutbacks in internet advertising that have gotten
so much publicity, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that that means
cut-backs in plans to use the internet commercially have also been scaled back?
And what of the competitors like ORCL and SEBL and SAP who are major size
competitors in the internet build-out/services space, and who started at the
top in company size served and are now working their way down the ladder as
times get tougher.

I'm not saying this company doesn't have appeal selling at these levels, I
guess what I'm asking is whether it will also have appeal from lower levels in
the future. What will stop the decline?

They are currently CFO and FCF positive, so they should hold up better than
most, but will it be enough?

On the value front, one stock I like is HKF, hancock fabrics

The recent price was $4.38, and I get a NetNet value of about $1.60, so I don't
see this as a great buy at these levels.

They have positive CFO and FCF but don't seem to have any great vision for what
to do with it to improve the business(which isn't always a bad thing, as these
visions are too often disguised ways of burning cash). I like the fact that
they are using the cash flow to pay down debt and to fund the pension plan and
to buy back stock, all things that help reduce future overhead. But I think I'd
rather look at them again somewhere down the road, maybe in the next major
market swoon.

I don't think you would get hurt too badly owning this one, it's just not the
kind of value play yet that I'm looking for.

That's my two cents, and it's worth every bit of what you paid for it! :~)

Timba,

As a rule I tend to be in favor of secondary offerings. I'd sure rather see a
company do a secondary near a market top than sell cheap shares near the bottom
because they got in trouble. It's also a far superior way to raise cash than to
issue preferred or debt. At least for holders of common. The secondary raises
book value for everyone and produces interest income as opposed to interest
expense. There are a lot of companies that went public near the market top in
the last few years that should show up on net net screens right now because
they were able to hang onto their cash. In the case of VIAN, they've managed to
improve the cash position by around $20 million above what they received in the
offerings over the last year and a half. MRCH is one I was looking at in the
sector mainly because of the price, but I had to keep closing one eye to see
anything good about it. In the case of MRCH, they burned cash like there was no
bottom to the bucket to expand the company and found themselves trying to climb
a step that wasn't there. The result was a private placement of an unholy
amount of stock at rock bottom and it still wasn't enough to dig themselves out
of liquidity problems.

"In light of the recent major cutbacks in internet advertising that have gotten
so much publicity, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that that means
cut-backs in plans to use the internet commercially have also been scaled
back?"

As I mentioned in a recent post, I tend to target out of favor sectors. The
biggest percentage gains come from changes in market sentiment. When Reuters
"hates" a sector so bad they devote a major part of their resources to spread
FUD, that's the place I usually go to look for bargains. Look for the slant in
those kind of articles rather than take anecdotal proofs, surveys without any
kind of statistical validity, and obscure quotes from obscure analysts at face
value. Take out the smoke and mirrors and you have something along the lines
of: "Someone I know in the business went broke. I asked three of my neighbors
about it and 66% of them said the situation is bad. 'Very, very bad.', said Jon
Barleycorn, a soybean farmer with three acres under cultivation in Nantucket."
The actual semantic content of those sort of articles becomes virtually sense
free. It's about like calling October the beginning of an impending ice age
rather than as part of a normal cycle known as winter.

No doubt the consulting market is tight right now. My overall impression is
that it will loosen up in the second half. Note that I said "my impression". My
impression is no substitute for your own research. VIAN is on my wish list in
the high 2's, low 3's provided I like the flavor of the next CC. I don't own
the stock at present, may not see my price target show up and could decide
against it even if the price does come into range. Since someone else mentioned
it, I thought it might be an interesting one to kick around.

Actually, Paul the amount per share is less than what I posted because I was
doing quick figuring then, and now I paid more attention.

The netnet valuation is my own interpretation of Graham. I discount receivables
by 20%, inventories by 1/3, and count cash at face....in the case of HKF: they
have(all numbers are in millions)7.089 cash, 0.614 receivables, 138.961
inventories for a discounted total of $100.22 divided by the number of shares
17.276= 5.80/share

Long term assets I lump together and discount by 50% even though Graham
suggests PPE be discounted by 85%. HKF has PPE of 26.232 and other LT assets of
16.349 which amounts to a gross of 42.581 which when discounted by 50% is
21.29, divided by 17.276 shares is 1.23/share

I count all liabilities at 100% of stated amount. HKF liabilities are: Current
Liabilities of 66.23, Long term debt of 21.0, and other LT obligations of 27.95
for a total liability of 115.18 when divided by 17.276 is 6.67/share

So, 5.80 + 1.23 - 6.67 = .36/share

re. out-of-favor stocks, DaimlerChrysler (DAJ) is getting bad press every place
you turn. It almost seems like a feeding frenzy.

The chart shows it, too: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DAJ&d=2y

re. DAJ's valuation, here's two ways of looking at it:

(1) yield: <pre>
DAJ 6.9%
Fiat 2.3%
Volkswagen 1.3%
Porsche 0.4%
F 4.5%
GM 3.6%</pre>

(2) price multiple (enterprise value / EBITDA).

For that, here's an excerpt from this week's Barron's cover story about BMW:

... that puts BMW's 2001 price/earnings ratio around 13. But few analysts or
big investors regard P/Es as a good measure of value when it comes to European
corporations, because accounting standards are rather loose and bottom-line
figures can thus be "adjusted," sometimes quite liberally.

Instead, they look at the enterprise value ratio, or EVR, which is enterprise
value (market capitalization plus debt, minus cash) divided by EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).

By this standard, BMW is not the cheapest stock around, but neither is it very
expensive. Its 2001 EVR of about 4 compares with
3 for VW,
5.3 for Fiat,
3 for DaimlerChrysler and
7.1 for Porsche.
Because they are focused on the premium segment of the market, BMW and Porsche
typically sport higher EVRs than other carmakers. 

Looking at that, I'm not sure what to think. It has the same multiple as VW.

I tried to compute the same ratio for F and GM, although I only had TTM values
for EBITDA, not 2001 values as for the European makers in the article. I
calculated the trailing EVR as 7.1 for GM and 17.8 for F (where the difference
between the latter two is attributable in part to the greater leverage at F as
compared to GM).

I wonder if it's yet at a point where you can buy one of the world's greatest
brands at a discount and get Chrysler for less than nothing on top of that. Any
opinions?

The problem I have with using Enterprise Value for anything is that it is
derived from Market Capitalization. Market Cap is simply share price times
number of shares outstanding. If the stock is popular(like the dot bombs were),
we could be talking a vastly out-of-whack market cap. Additionally, EV uses
debt in its calculation as well, so a company that pays off its debt has a
potentially lower EV for being prudent.

Enterprise Value has too many flaws for me to use it yet. It is one of the
calculations I've built into my spreadsheet, thinking I may find a use for it
somewhere down the road, but I haven't found one yet.

As far as Daimler Chrysler is concerned, I think they go lower before they give
up altogether. They are trying to apply European business thinking to an
American enterprise and very few are successful at that. If they would have
kept American management throughout, they might have had a chance, but they've
got it all screwed up right now from what I can see. I'm going to wait until
either they get their management act together or sell it.

The stocks that I follow are up from their lows. I'd not be a buyer now.
Namely,

IP - if it gets down to where it was when I mentioned it on this thread last
year, I'll double my small position in this Dow stock, the country's largest
private landowner.

WY - I buy this one when the dividend yield falls into a formula I use for
evaluation. That is - I try to do that - The last time the price was right
(last year) I had no confidence, passed on the opportunity, and the stock rose
away from me.

PCL, BCC, I occasionally look at. I monitor LPX- again when price was lower, I
just could not reach for it. I'll try again if the stock drops to lows.

In a different arena, I'm partial to BMHC. I've mentioned it here several times
- don't wish to tout it (it garners no interest on this thread anyway -g-), but
I'll mention it again because it is still attractive (imo, based on standard
value criteria)and lumber does account for a substantial part of its business -
garage doors, roof and floor trusses, pre-hung doors, wall panels - which are
sold to professional contractors and builders.

If you bought energy stocks when stock prices were low and the press was
bemoaning the energy problems (gas was at or under 50 cents a gallon?? -- those
were the old days all right), maybe the opposite might work now that energy is
so expensive. I suggest looking at steel stocks, although I realize that this
is just too ugly stinky a cigar to look at -- the structural problems with
imports, brutal domestic competition, etc. etc. (Has anyone made any decent
money buying steel stocks in the last 5 or 10 years???) Maybe more reasonable
for a downtrodden industry would be airlines. We know people are still flying
and want to travel, and the industry is trying to consolidate into just a few
players (domestic carriers). Imo the stocks of these companies will, at some
point, revert to higher prices (but maybe not before those share prices go
lower -g-). I hold stocks in both these industries; will add more to airlines
if/when they test lows.

I think you miss the whole point of Enterprise Value discussion, the issue is
Enterprise Value Ratio. Which means if you pay off your debt, your ratio will
go down and if you have a small market cap, your ratio will go down. And
smaller ratios are better

The EVR = EV/EBITDA.

It is commonly used in buyout scenarios as it is far less limited than PE by
including the debt side of the equation.

The actual enterprise value (or present purchase price of the corporation)is of
great benefit and I usually replace market cap with EV when I do ratio analyis.
For example, price to sales ratio doesnt mean anything to me if the company is
saddled by a debt which dwarfs its market cap. (typical of many car companies
in particular)

In terms of car companies, I think Daimler has its hands full. The projections
I read are that car sales will be declining for the next couple years - hardly
a prescription for increasing values in the lot. I think they kind of bounce
around for a while and maybe go lower here. Additionally, Last time I checked,
there are more interesting companies which have EVR's in the 3 range (or less)
- some of which may not have as many warts as daimler.

Thank you for clarifying the context of EVR usage.

So, a company which shows high EBITDA is more likely to have a lower EVR.

I understand that the Enterprise Value number was just sitting there waiting to
be used, because it had been derived to arrive at a company's sale price.

But as an investor in a value situation, as a tool for evaluation, I still
don't have any comfort with it. But then I've got screwy ideas anyway! I mean,
to me, EBITDA is not that important of a number either. I would much rather use
CFO(Cash from Operations).

Since I never buy whole companies, just little pieces of them, I don't have to
tie myself to the same techniques as those who do. I would much rather buy a
company selling near it's NetNet valuation levels than one based on an EVR
ratio. Have you considered using CFO instead of EBITDA in this ratio? Any
thoughts on it?

As you wrote, thats how I come up with Free cash from operations - (income
+depr+amort-capex) Sometimes, the capex is neglected - and it can often be
high. For ex. semiconductor companies.

In terms of cost of corporation, I probably would have been better suited to
say EV as that is what I meant.

One other point I neglected to mention it that I will sometimes modify EV by
subtracting out cash on hand. I dont use current assets per se. because they
are often hard to evaluate. (ie for companies like gtsi, inventory may need to
be hit with a 0.5multiplier whereas for apparel, it may be closer to .7 or .8)
Cash on the other hand is somewhat easier.

As far as discounted cash flows, it is pretty straight forward other than your
choice of the risk free rate. For me, I choose to look at my "longer term" debt
(mortgage, car etc) and use the highest interest bearing debt as the risk free
rate.

Dont know if this helps or not, But if your interested, I will publish a recent

The definition of risk free rate that I've come to know is that rate you can
earn on the money with no risk associated. Since there is no such animal, what
has been generally accepted is the rate on the T-Bill. When you indicate using
a rate higher than that you are, in effect, saying that you want to be
compensated for the risk you are assuming in making the investment. Frankly, I
use 14% as a minimum. May be unreasonable, but if I can get it, I laugh all the
way to the bank :~)

I'm still not clear on your valuation methodology. The factors in discounting
cash flows as I know them are: Time, PV(present value), rate, payment and
(FV)future value. I take it that the rate is what we've been discussing, and
the payment for these purposes is always zero, I think you are using EV as
future value(discounted back to the present?)but then what time period do you
use? 1 year?

As far as sharing your screens, I'd love to see them!

I think the idea of a risk free rate is important when discounting future cash
flows. I dont think it should incorporate getting paid for market risk as I
view that as something altogether different. Hence the need for a relatively
accurate risk free rate. For me it is easy to determine. Since I have a
mortgage, I use the interest rate of the mortgage. It is essentially risk free
(at least for the remainder of the mortgage period).

To be compensated for market risk, I like to see about a 40% discount between
the calculated value (if you can call it that) and the buy price. Since I am
not much for projecting growth rates, I look at just the prior and next year.
These companies should be throwing off excess cash. I have a predilection for
them to use the cash for dividends, stock buybacks and debt repayment. If not,
I tend to avoid.

is essentially risk free (at least for the remainder of the mortgage period).

I think you are mixing apples and oranges here. "Risk Free" means to the person
investing the money. The lender on your mortgage still has risk at the rate
they lent to you, at the minimum, they have default risk and they have
inflation risk if you have a fixed rate. They accepted the difference between
what they could get on a T-Bill and what they charge you as an interest rate as
their desired compensation for taking on the added risk. This does not make it
a "risk free" rate for them, just the rate at which they feel adequately
compensated. This is not a "risk free" rate for you because this is a debt
expense, not an asset return.

By using the mortgage rate, you are in effect saying:"I can get (say)6% on a
T-Bill, but I want at least X." Where X is the T-Bill plus some margin of
return that raises the rate to your mortgage rate.

Regarding your list, I had already looked at NVH and came up with a NetNet
value of about $7.75/share which, I believe, is lower than current market
price.

FINL, by my calculations has a NetNet value of $4.76/share, which is also below
current market price.

I haven't looked at the other two.

I just bought some ARWM at $2.00, I get NetNet at $1.85 with most of that from
current assets. Looks like a decent growth rate.

The other two companies are VII and REF.

On VII I have a NetNet valuation of $4.25/share, and I bought today at $2.50.
It has slow growth, and is showing a negative CFO for the most recent reporting
period, but it is because the Postal Service contractors have been slow in
paying and therefore their receivables have increased thus reducing CFO. This
sounds plausible enough that at this discount to NetNet, I'm willing to take
the chance that it is a short term negative CFO.

REF I show with a NetNet value of $3.57/share, I bought it at $3.125/share.
This one has somewhat faster growth and currently positive CFO and FCF.

misleading in high debt companies. [For a more accurate read, include preferred
and operating leases - sometimes debt by another name]
Agree with comments that EV/EBITDA is basically a quick and dirty measure of
relative value that does a far better job than PE & PS because of debt
inclusion. Basically a first cut, 'Do I want to look further?' tool, leading to
further analysis if attractive. I also like it because it's smoother than FCF
based ratios and there's some industry data that provides standards of
comparison.

re: "EV/EBITDA is basically a quick and dirty measure of relative value that
does a far better job than PE & PS because of debt inclusion"

Perhaps on that basis, but there are other issues to consider as well. For
example, if it is desirable for other people to recognize value and so buy the
stock and bid the price higher, it's pretty easy to find historical trends -
company specific as well as industry - to argue when price/earnings is
unusually low or price to sales. But calculating historical EV/EBITDA takes
much more work and imo, limits the population of potential investors who will
do this work and so come into such an undervalued stock.

Furthermore, there are some stocks which historically trade on their
relationship to price/earnings or to book value or perhaps to interest rates or
dividend yields. Knowing how such stocks or industries trade can be very
helpful to the investor. In that vein, I have come to rely on several people
here for their knowledge that broadcasters or newspapers, for example, do trade
based on cash flows. Applying EV/EBITDA as a general screen against all stocks
only would work in two general cases, I believe: finding attractive candidates
that also are attractive on price/sales and/or price/book; finding favorable
EV/EBITDA stocks in which this is the only outstanding favorable metric, but
favorable enough to where one is willing to become obstinate in purchasing and
holding regardless of how hidden to others the underlying value might be.

My impression from recent posts here is that the stocks people are finding now
that fit their favorable EV/EBITDA requirements either do not exist or are of
2nd or 3rd tier companies. Is this right? Or perhaps I am confusing this with
the net-net discussions?

Paul,

I've come to around to the view that the best way to think about how to value
businesses is to think like an owner.

The different methodologies (P/S, PEs, P/BV, P/CF etc..) that are applied by
the marketplace to different businesses usually make a lot of sense because of
the specific qualities of the businesses.

Some are cyclical - so earnings in any snapshot of time can be meaningless.

Some have profits that change with interest rates.

In some cases the depreciation rates don't match economic reality - so earnings
are actually higher than reported.
I agree that that can complicate the screening process.

My own screening process is pretty simple. I buy both versions of Value Line.
Each week I scan them for companies I would like to own based on their long
term record, balance sheet, return on capital, prospects, other basic
information.

I put them all in Yahoo portfolios broken down by industry and then I casually
glance at the charts and news daily. In the mean time I do more serious
research on any of them that are close to a price at which I would like to buy
them.

I also add companies to the list that I read about in magazines, learn about
from other investors like yourself, pick up from Outstanding Investor Digest
that other top value guys are buying etc..

Because of my initial screening criteria, I think my process leaves out a lot
of potential investments in industries and individual companies that are very
depressed.

But it gives me a list that quite frankly is a lot larger than I will ever
understand fully or can track completely without giving 100% of my time to
investing. I try to lead a very balanced life so anything over 98% is too much
:-)

I wonder if someone is interested in helping me out on how to value the stock
of KDUS and also tell me what action a rational BOD would be doing now to
enhance share value?

Here are the facts as I know them to be.

KDUS:
1. 13.1 shares O/S

2. Carl Icahn owns 25%

3. Approx $24 mil in cash

4. a 20-30% (not sure exactly) interest in Axiom, a private
biotech. Not aware of how much it's worth, but figure a min. of 20 cents per
KDUS share.

5. No employees, so the burn rate, if there is one after assuming a 5-6% return
on the $24 mil in cash would consist of the salaires of the CEO, who is the
only employee, and the BOD and whatever the cost is to produce the SEC required
documents (maybe there are more expenses, but I'm not sure what)

6. (Here's the tricky part) There's a good possibility/probability that KDUS
will be receiving patent royalties beginning in 2004 or 2005 of perhaps $12 mil
yr. or more--lets say $13.1 mil per year to make the arithmetic easy. I don't
know how long the royalties continue for - but assume it's the length of the
patent--I also don't know how long a drug patent in good for? Anyone know that?
7 years or so?

So with that, how do you figure the present value? It's got to be at least
$2/sh just figuring the cash and Axiom shares...but how do you do the math and
what discount rate do you use for the stream of royalties? If you expect $1/sh
in 4 years, would that $1/sh convert to 60 cents now? The $1/sh in 5 years to
50 cents now? Do you just add the 7 or whatever it is years' worth of royalties
up properly discounted and add those to the $2/sh cash for the right answer?

Then to the final part of the question-- if you're the BOD, do you try to sell
the company now or is it best for SH to just sit tight and wait for the
royalties to begin? And then, do you pass them on as dividends, or do something
else?

Thanks to anyone interested in tackling this. BTW, I own some of this stock if
you're wondering.

re. EV/EBITDA, I think it's most valuable for comparing to foreign companies
that don't use US-GAAP accounting, especially for evaluating them as takeover
candidates.

I think that this discussion began when I posted a table of EV/EBITDA for
automakers that appeared in a Barron's article on BMW, which was discussed as a
possible acquisition for various larger automakers.

BTW, automakers are so highly leveraged that the stock price has little effect
on EV. If you're a big company interested in taking over a little one, EV (not
market cap) is obviously what you want to look at in the prospective
acquisition.

I'm not sure it's as helpful for stock investors, though, especially for
evaluating a cyclical stock and a highly leveraged company. The massive debt
appearing in the EV will wash out the effect of the stock valuation.

Tomato,

If I'm not mistaken, drug patents are good for 17 years. Ichan doesn't have a
reputation for looking after the welfare of other shareholders. I can picture
two things happening. 1. Ichan gets voting control and does a leveraged buyout
to grab the cash. 2. Ichan finds a buyer who will swap stock to get the cash.
The best shot for shareholders would be for the company to actively seek a
buyer. My guess is most companies would be fairly pleased to get around $20
million in cash for maybe $40-$50 million in stock. I don't think it would be a
hard sell even if the value of the patents was assumed to be zero. It would
basically amount to free money.

I'm not a big fan of the OTC BB, but that one looks fairly clean provided the
litigation can't come back on them. I don't think I'd bet the farm on it but it
might fit into someone's basket of 100 net nets. <g>

My worst last year's investment (not counting some option plays ;-) ) was GES,
which I bought at 7.X in November and sold at 4.X couple days later after
negative earnings report. Of course, I could have held it from there or even
added more, but I decided to let it go because of the high leverage. I should
not have bought it in the first place for that reason, but greed rules
eternal...

So it climbed to 7.X and then today's news hit:

Only casually and related to this...
http://futures.tradingcharts.com/chart/LU/W
Which I follow as a leading indicator of housing starts and a piece of the
puzzle when determining bank/builder/consumer confidence. In order for the
lumber companies to become attractive to me, I need to see a discrepancy
between the price of lumber and the valuation of the companies. Right now the
companies are overvalued vs. the lumber and have moved in response to the
expectation that recent rate cuts will trigger a reacceleration in housing
starts. That's yet to appear, and the price of lumber, dispite production cuts,
reflects that. You'd have to go back to 1991 to find lumber prices this cheap,
and that's not inflation adjusted.
Yes, a contrarian play worth following. Remember also, that higher electricity
costs will affect all forms of industry in the West. Several mills have
curtailed production for this very reason.

BTW, what does this mean to you?
"Most mills in the South are shut down until the market recovers. In some cases
the logs cost more than the lumber is worth after it is manufactured." I don't
know the industry well enough to know if this means that the price of
harvesting logs exceeds the cost of selling the lumber made from them or if it
merely means that logs are mispriced!

Archimedes,

"You'd have to go back to 1991 to find lumber prices this cheap"

If so, the prices aren't being reflected at the retail level, at least not
where I am. Dimensional lumber prices are within a few cents of what they were
2-3 years ago which was a good 50% above what they were 2-3 years before that.
The price of sheetrock has nearly doubled from 5 years ago and wafer board is
up about 20%. This may not be true in all areas of the country, so consider the
information as anecdotal.

On the topic of logs costing more than the finished goods produced, my instant
reaction would be to question the source. I've seen more absurdly slanted
articles on just about every topic lately that sorting out hard facts is
getting to be more guess work than anything else. My guess is the FUD factor
should be discounted by about 70% on most recent news items.

I live in the Northwest, so maybe I can fill in a little bit on that angle. It
has been an unusually dry winter so far, but one thing I can guarantee is that
going for a period of time without rain is not a permanent condition.

It'll rain again and everything will go back to normal. In the mean time it
will affect manufacturing in the area. Generally there is so much extra
electricity produced from the dams that the power companies sell it very cheap
to the major users in the area, at a sharp discount, on the condition that if
there is a shortage the extra is cut off. These companies rarely run at full
capacity, but if they need to in order to make up for lost time, they can pick
up the slack pretty quick. The workers get laid off for a few weeks and then
work a ton of overtime when they go back. The bottom line is that it all
averages out after everything is said and done.

I think there's another factor to consider and that's that in many areas of the
country, it just plain isn't practical to build houses in the winter. For one
thing, building codes won't allow a concrete foundation to be poured when
forecasts suggest below freezing temperatures before it has time to set. And
too much rain makes the lumber rot. The entire industry is seasonal and doesn't
have nearly the exposure to current power shortages as the news would have us
believe.

None of this really has anything to do with whether or not construction stocks
are a good value right now but I'm always amazed when I hear I'm in the middle
of some kind of disaster area when everything looks the same when I look out
the window.

Archimedes,

That chart really is interesting. I pulled out some receipts from when I was
building my house in 97-98 and 2X4's were costing me $2.28 each. I bought some
2X4's for my garage a month ago and they cost $2.26. Whoever gets the part that
comes out of the middle must be doing okay. A ball park guess is it would cost
20-25% more to build the same house today. The cost of studs is a fairly small
part of what goes into a house. It's the cost of siding, roofing, trusses,
doors, windows, carpeting, sheetrock, etc., etc., etc. that runs the price up.
I don't follow the sector so I really don't have much of an idea what the 20
something analysts are saying, but I'd have to assume any analysis based on
wholesale lumber prices vs. construction costs would have to be flawed. Off
hand I'd have to say the single biggest cost of building a house for anyone not
willing to swing their own hammer is the cost of labor. If I were looking for
trends, I think one of the places to check would be employment numbers. People
without jobs have a hard time getting financing to buy a new house. Interest
rates and building costs would have an effect on how much house a person can
afford, but somewhere along the line they still have to pay for whatever they
buy. Maybe buy dips after periods of higher unemployment and lower consumer
confidence start to reverse?

Just my two cents worth and probably worth every penny of it.

permits, interest rates, etc. If you or anybody else would like to do something

how businesses have cut back travel thus enabling more vacationers to find
travel bargains to major US cities- spurred me to place an order (that was

re: mgmt of hotel reits. Depends on the REIT. Some hotel reits contract out

that are owned by the same people who run the reit. There, that would be a
possible conflict of interest I'd want to be alert to. With LHO, they are small

some of the properties in which they are joint owners I believe.

CRO is the lumber pure play that's taken the biggest beating as a cyclical, due
to low lumber prices:

Crown Pacific Anticipates Earnings Shortfall and Reduction of Quarterly
Distribution

PORTLAND, Ore., Dec. 21 /PRNewswire/ -- Crown Pacific Partners, L.P. (NYSE: CRO
- news) today announced that its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2000 would
be significantly below analyst expectations of $0.20 per unit. The lower
results will negatively impact the unitholder distribution level and the Board
of Control is now analyzing, in accordance with the Partnership agreement, what
level of quarterly distribution is sustainable given the current market
conditions. The Board expects to complete this analysis, and announce the
fourth quarter distribution level by mid-January 2001 after receiving the
Partnership's fourth quarter results.

Continued dramatic declines in prices for lumber, logs and timberland have
impacted the Partnership's cashflow and earnings necessary to pay the current
level of distribution without impairing the long-term value of its assets.

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/001221/or_crownpa.html

That announcement of a dividend cut was fairly predictable, but it sliced the
market cap by more than half.

Here's an excerpt from an October analyst report, when the stock was selling
for about 18 vs. about 7.8 now:

Crown Pacific’s hallmark has been its ability to meet cash flow and
distribution growth targets. However, with wood prices at current levels, we
believe the company would encounter difficulties meeting objectives.
Additionally, most of the cash flow generated has come from harvest levels that
we believe exceed the growth rates on Crown Pacific’s lands. We note that,
based on our estimate of Crown Pacific’s net asset value, we think there could
be upside in CRO on a liquidation basis.

==============

Taking a look at the balance sheet, it is highly leveraged, with $688 M of LT
debt, vs. $151 M equity.

Some thoughts I have on CRO....I ran it through my spreadsheet and it doesn't
look good to me. Even if I discount PPE(and I'm counting the timber and
timberlands in this total)by less than normally do...I usually discount PPE by
50%, but here I'm discounting by 30% because large tracts of land seem to hold
their value....anyway, even allowing for a higher value percentage of long term
assets, I get a negative NetNet value because of the huge LT debt.

I ran across an interesting way for me to get a feel for Free Cash Flow, and
have incorporated it in my analysis spreadsheet. I'm starting with the change
in cash and adjusting it for investing and financing results that are either
discretionary or non-operational(a la Hackel in "Cash Flow and Security
Analysis"). By this formulation, I get a FCF of negative 9.7 million.

Until the fundamentals of this company improve, to me buying it at these levels
would be too much like trying to catch a falling knife.

A Sunday rant and vent - idiocy of stock picking contests.

These things are mostly set up by journalists or people with something to sell.
They almost never are promulgated by serious or successful investors. Because
real investors know how difficult it is to buy and hold on to a stock until
real gains are achieved -- let alone have some arbitrary contest-ending
deadline forced on them (which almost has to be just a few months or less -
otherwise people would lose interest or even forget they've entered the
contest).

Further, the goal of the contest is always (in my experience) to beat everyone
else. That is just not a realistic, viable goal for an investor. An investor
who would or should in reality have a goal that is an accumulation of $$$$ -
substantial in amount and earning a good return if the funds are not
accumulated for a specific purchase.

So the contest leads people to pick stocks they believe will go up quickly and
beat everyone else's picks. These would be, or should be, stocks that the
contestant wouldn't actually own or would own only as small part of his/her
investments. Imo, it's really a waste of time to consider these contest-type
stocks for actual purchase with the expectation they will see superior
increases in so short a time frame (the contest period.)

Plus, the emotions of paper trading are imo SUBSTANTIALLY different from what
is experienced in actually owning stocks. And understanding or mastering those
real life emotions are often what is critical to investment success.

Whole thing is just a waste of time (just like my writing this post!) which
diverts people from the real issues, and worse, for unsuspecting or new
investors, the excitement and apparent interest by so many people regarding the
contest, obscures what successful investing is about.

So there!

Sunbeam Files for Bankruptcy
By Brad Dorfman

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Home appliance maker Sunbeam Corp. (NYSE:SOC - news),
burdened by a heavy debt load, shareholder lawsuits and a probe into its
accounting practices, on Tuesday filed for voluntary bankruptcy reorganization.

The maker of Sunbeam appliances, First Alert smoke alarms and Coleman camping
gear, said all its operating units will conduct business as usual while it
reorganizes under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.

``This was a difficult, but absolutely necessary decision for us to make,''
Chairman and Chief Executive Jerry Levin said. ``It is, in fact, the only
option that will free Sunbeam from its overwhelming burden of debt and
securities-related litigation expenses.''

Sunbeam has been hampered by a heavy load of debt, most of it taken on to
finance acquisitions by former Chief Executive ''Chainsaw'' Al Dunlap.

The company had total debt of $3.20 billion as of Sept. 30, according to the
bankruptcy filing, with $2.96 billion book value in assets.

DANGEROUS LEVERAGE

With such a large debt load, the company was unable to meet its obligations as
the U.S. economy softened, cutting into sales of most appliance makers,
analysts said.

``With that dangerous level of leverage, nothing could go wrong and obviously
with this sluggish economy, things did go wrong,'' Rommel Dionisio, analyst at
Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., said.

The company's cash had dwindled to $15 million on Friday and Sunbeam needed to
file for bankruptcy protection in order to fund operating expenses and building
seasonal inventory, the filing said.

``That was a very critical part of the plan, in fact, to continue to pay the
vendors what we bought for the season,'' Levin said in a telephone interview
with Reuters. He added that vendors in recent months had forced the company to
accelerate its payments in order to receive inventory.

Meanwhile, the Boca Raton, Fla., company said in November that the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission recommended an enforcement action after a
two-year probe over its accounting practices.

The company has also faced shareholder lawsuits as the stock plummeted from $53
in March 1998 to mere pennies for the past several months. On Tuesday, the New
York Stock Exchange said it would suspend trading on the stock immediately and
has filed with the SEC for the stock's delisting.

Sunbeam said its banks have agreed to provide it with a new $285 million line
of credit, and it has received a

commitment from General Electric Co.'s (NYSE:GE - news) GE Capital Corp. for a
new $200 million accounts receivable financing program for its domestic
businesses.

The company said it will file its reorganization plan for itself and its
domestic operating subsidiaries in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the New York.

THE PLAN

Under the plan, Sunbeam would convert a substantial portion of its existing
bank debt into term debt, convertible debt and equity interests in the
reorganized company. The plan would also include the discharge of all of
Sunbeam's securities-related litigation and bondholder debt.

The company said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy in six to nine months.

Banks that hold about $1.7 billion of Sunbeam's debt support the plan, the
company said.

Loan losses, including problems with loans to Sunbeam, hurt fourth quarter
profits at Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC - news) and First Union Corp.
(NYSE:FTU - news). According to the bankruptcy filing, each bank holds $499.2
million in secured Sunbeam debt. Spokespeople at both banks were not available
for comment.

Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. (NYSE:MWD - news) holds $665.6 million under
its Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc. and Bank of New York Co. Inc (NYSE:BK -
news) holds $863.7 million in unsecured subordinated bonds. Bank of New York
was also unavailable for comment.

A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said the bankruptcy filing was not a surprise and
added that the firm adjusts the carrying value of its debt holdings to reflect
the market value of the debt.

Sunbeam said it does not anticipate any work-force reductions or plant closings
as a result of the reorganization.

Analysts said they did not expect the reorganization to lead Sunbeam to slash
prices lower than competitors, stressing that the company merely needed to get
out from under its heavy debt burden.

``Sunbeam is a brand that is going to be here in five years,'' William Steele,
analyst at Banc of America Securities, said. He added that the bankruptcy
filing actually could be a positive step for the company, which has suffered
through uncertainty about its fate for months.

Thread, can anyone help with merger math?

If company A has 300 shares outstanding, company B has 500 shares out, and A&B
merge at a 1:1 ratio, how many shares does the resulting company have
outstanding? Is it 800 or "none of the above"?

Thanks for your help,

Josh

I'll jump in with an answer before someone who really knows gives the correct
response.

If the transaction is 1:1, stock for stock, then I say it depends on what is
meant by shares outstanding.

I say that B, if B is the buyer, with 500 shares outstanding, has to give out a
total of 300 shares for each share of A outstanding. If all of B's 500 shares
are already distributed among B's shareholders, then B has to come up with 300
additional shares by issuing stock (300). But if only 200 of B's shares are
distributed among shareholders -- and the other 300 are held by the company as
treasury shares (allocated to be used for business purposes)in the company's
equity section (the total thus still being 500 shares outstanding), then B
could issue those 300 for A's shares. So after the deal is done, in that case
the answer is 500 shares issued and outstanding.

Similar logic if A is the buyer. Answers depend on how much, if any, treasury
stock is available.

Simple answer is yes. Paul, like any good value investor, loves to complicate
the simple and simplify the complicated. Thats just the way our brains work.
Like he said though you have to really dig into most stock merger deals to
figure them out, especially if you own the buyer.

Is anyone familiar with CPCL?

I get a NetNet value of $5.79/sh. which is right around where it is currently
selling.

Looks to me like they are burning cash pretty quickly, but they apparently have
expanded fab capacity and seem poised to take advantage of any pick-up in
technology orders.

Don't know enough about this one to make a call and would appreciate any
insights anyone else might have.

re: CPCL.

Per Jim Clarke's (ref: post 11971) link to M.J.Whitman's Q&A:

"Q: What do you think CP Clare (CPCL) is worth per share? (December 28, 2000)
A: Give this valuation a wide berth and a high beta! In a fire sale I would say
$5 per share (cash plus some value for PPE and intellectual property). If some
of their new products gain traction (a big if), the value of the company would
easily go into the low double digits. (Answered by Curtis Jensen, Co-Portfolio
Manager of Third Avenue Small-Cap Value Fund"
----------------
I'm still holding a small position with an average cost around 6. I posted on
it 7/7/99. At the time, the Whitman people were positive on the stock, having
established their position with buys between 7 and 12. Jensen's answer above
seems to indicate that he might not be so positive now. Maybe he's liquidated
or reduced his ownership.

Using Yahoo - always a dangerous thing to do -- I still see CPCL with no debt
and going for somewhat more than twice cash. (If verified by the filings, to
me, it would be the possible margin-of-safety aspect.)

Every year for the past several, CPCL has traded at some point at 10 or more
(albeit sometimes only briefly). They design and manufacture semiconductors and
specialized components like switches/relays, and I am betting that once again -
at some point in the next 12 months I will see 10 in this stock as the general
component/semi outlook becomes more favorable. (And if I can hold on to this
thing and the stock does rise, maybe I'll be alert enough to take some
profits.)

OTOH, Whitman people are pretty astute - Mr. Jensen seems negative on the
stock, and regarding my picks and my logic and my predictions - I've been wrong
many, many times.

Thanks for the feedback, Paul.

While, indeed, there isn't any long term debt to speak of, I am concerned about
the cash burn rate. I didn't read their whole report, but I looked at the
financial statements and some of management's discussion(which didn't really
address it, which concerns me also), and I didn't see any big non-cash
write-offs like excess depreciation or amortization of goodwill or anything
like that. Which says to me that they just aren't profitable at what they do.

I was hoping I was wrong about it, but I guess not. I am looking at these
Netnets from the point of view of having a margin of safety. If the company
isn't profitable in it's underlying business, any margin of safety I might feel
from it selling at Netnet values would be illusory at best. I guess I'll pass
on this one. Just because it might go to 10 sometime is not enough for me, it
just might go to zero too.

RDN, CIX.

regarding RDN which I asked about couple of weeks ago,I did start a small
position in it last week. I'll add more if the stock drops back to my entry
price.

I'm starting a position in CIX today. Your basic and prosaic industrial type
value stock, imo. Negative is that it's likely to be in cyclical businesses
that we haven't seen the bottom to yet. Given that the stock does not have a
lengthy trading history, and a there's now a new CEO as well, this adds even
more uncertainty.

Still, at about $9.20, CIX trades below stated book value, and a couple of
bucks maybe above tangible bv, and sports a p/s about .6 and an roe about 16%.
(which MAYBE might not be decimated if this economically sensitive stock can
maintain those earnings). There's a better than 5% dividend to soothe investor
patience.

Anybody with thoughts on COOL?

Internet computer e-tailor.

Quick peek at latest 10q seems to indicate current assets exceeding total

etc. $1M rev per employee.

Some insider buying lately.

Haven't done real digging, just looking for opinions.

Thanks, TimbaBear. Looks like some good stock ideas to review. This list is a
list of your netnet stocks that you are following, not a list of stocks in
which you have actually taken positions, is that right? Because in your
previous post you said you were not buying money losing companies, and at least
a couple on your list are reporting losses.

I just did a quick run-through of the numbers and show COOL to have a NetNet
value of approx. $1.27/share.

However, I don't feel that this represents any real margin of safety for this
particular issue as they are not profitable at what they do and, as a result,
have a very high cash burn rate.

I have not read their filings with the SEC, just looked at the Financial
Statements they filed.

Timba.
