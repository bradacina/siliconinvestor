Hi Carl - I continue to hold my very small position in DRYS but was a bit
concerned about the information in that article too. I do believe that the
shipping sector is a good value play if you can (1) buy in at the right price
and (2) the company has a track record of paying a steady dividend (which will
help to support the stock price) and can book strong earnings that grow over
time from the increased global demand by China and India.

My favorite shipping stock is SFL and I continue to add to my position at
prices below $20.00/share. They have secured carrier contracts (which go out as
far as seven years) with their parent (FRO) and manage a fleet that contains
newer ships that meet the double hull requirements which is mandatory by 2010.

I may nibble at some more DRYs shares if it trades below it's IPO price of
$18/share and if the company can show (and meet) their revenue projections
stated in their IPO literature.

It's better to be safe and wait for stocks come to your price because the real
"value" money is made on the "buy" rather than the "sell".

ELN: Yes, two big percentage drops for a total of about 70-80% loss. That
possibility is why I am very, very diversified. Even being diversified just
among several subsectors of the drug/healthcare sector is not enough.
Stockholders here have seen very poor performance for many of the generic/big
pharma/medical device companies over the past few years. Today, for example,
several heretofore well-regarded high performing orthopedic stocks took a big
hit on the feds looking for illegal pricing practices. (I have Stryker. ouch!)

I'm betting ELN will rise from the dead as it has in the past. Sometimes these
proscribed drugs (aside: I mean proscribed as in 'denounced & condemmed' - not
"prescribed") are resurrected. (Perhaps though not likely with Tysabri,
according to some media reports.) Also, I find it hard to believe that ELN,
even with all its research and financial problems, doesn't have potential with
other drugs in its pipeline. Although...
"According to a note released by Smith Barney, profitability will now be
delayed until 2009."

Stock might drop to 1 or lower ---again. At that point, the percentage drop is
huge, even from the current $3.24. For me though, the big money's already been
lost. A 3 point drop isn't going to be that significant dollar-wise to the
losses I've already incurred.

I can take a long-term capital tax loss anytime with ELN. I'll wait a bit to
see if the stock stabilizes and at what price that might be. I might sell and
buy back 31 days later.

AIG: The revelations about AIG make it too tough for me to add to my few

entities controlled and run by Mr. Greenberg and other AIG execs or ex-execs -
how they affect earnings, how they maybe drain earnings from AIG (public

which they haven't - for instance - CSBK - Clifton Savings - shows book value

- so here's my 4 bank picks for investors willing to hold for the long haul - &
i'm down on all 4 at the moment:

&#183; #1 - CSBK - Clfiton Savings Bank - closed at $11.10 - net inc for latest
quarter was $.10 diluted; about $.40/eps annualized - but earnings keep growing
as ipo proceeds deployed - sitting on several branch offices acquired decades
ago & now worth $millions more than reflected on balance sheet - Equity $202.9
mill/14 mill shs = $14.49 book value - but real book value much higher - pays a
$.20/annual dividend or almost 2% - just announced a 5% share buyback

&#183; #2 - KRNY - Kearny Bank - closed at $11.10 - book value is $23.16 - just
de-mutualized so real earnings and dividends not exactly clear but both should
be good when they do come out

&#183; #3 - ABBC - Abbington Community Bank - closed at $12.69 - on track to do
about $.79/eps for year but should be higher as ipo proceeds deployed - $17.34
in book value - actually - this bank is in Bucks County, PA - which borders NJ

&#183; #4 - OSHC - Ocean Shore Bank - closed at $10.65 - also too new to
determine earnings - but book value is $15.97

Citigroup's very strong business franchises (global one stop, economies of

Hi Paul - Do you know from your list of banks (including JP Morgan) which ones
offer integrated banking between countries like Mexico and/or the Philippines?
We have a lot of illegal immigrants here in California who currently send money

market is opening up for the large integrated Banks to provide country to
country bank transfers through their local branches and affiliates. Some
reports state that $60 Billion is transferred out of the U.S. each year by
illegal immigrant workers.

I recently had to send some money to the Ukraine and ended up using Western
Union Money with my credit card. The total fees paid were $58.65 for a $120
transfer. $27 went to Western Union and $11.65 went to JP Morgan Chase.

I sure would like to get a piece of these fees. Any idea as to who the big
players are and if they have targeted this growth market? I believe Citigroup
is best positioned but they were not able to handle my Ukraine transfer. My

before the book value of a 1st step thrift is a somewhat hypothetical value -
you are calculated as if there were no dilution from the 2nd step conversion

re C and BAC - i think Paul is right and both are buys at current valuations.
Both companies have the potential to grow earnings around 10% annually and with
a 4% dividend the expected return for those stocks can be in the mid single
digit, which imo is far better than the overall market. I believe that C's
international and diversified business is a distinct advantage compared to BAC
and that's why I choose C over BAC. However a diversified empire like C is much
more difficult to oversee and apparently previous management did not care too
much as long as the dough kept rolling in. Now C is getting punished for that

Western Union: Hard for me to call this one a buy on a value thread. Psr is
3.15; p/bk is 3.56. Compared to previous years, that's a low p/bk number and a
relatively low psr number- but still, those are high numbers on an absolute
basis for a traditional value investor (Imo).

If one wanted a position in the transaction processing business, Western
Union's parent is near an annual low. As you have suggested, perhaps that's due
to the competition that's supposed to come in and kill the juicy profit margins
that the business keeps showing. Depending on one's view, now - at the current
low price - is an okay time to buy, or else maybe one should wait because the
stock's really done nothing in the past couple or more years, and there's no
evidence that the stock's going anywhere soon. Plus it looks like the stock may
drift down. Consumer spending reductions, should they occur,may decrease the
number of transactions perhaps?

I like the transaction processing business because I like the idea of the
company getting a teensie-weensie li'l bit ($) from every transaction they
process (and they processed 25 billion in fiscal '03).

I still hold shares from a 10/16/03 purchase (@37.50). I sold some in '04, but
if the stock (now $38.90) should drop below my purchase price on no adverse
news, I'll up my position.

Paul - Could you paste a copy of the Barron's article on MBI? It's been on my
radar recently.

MBI looks cheap at 0.78 times its adjusted book value. I think the lowest it
has ever traded was 0.7 times when Gotham Partners came out with that negative
report a couple of years ago.

However, I do think the stock will remain volatile with headline risk relating
to the SEC and Spitzer investigations. On top of that, the outlook for bond
insurers aren't that great with high interest rates dampening debt issuance and
increasing price competition from new entrants.

I like MBI's mgt team. They are disciplined and conservative, exactly what I
want in an insurance company. If they wanted to please the Street in the sort
term, they could easily increase the amount of premiums they write by loosening
their underwriting standard or lower its prices. Both of which they refused to
do.

The chance of them losing their AAA rating like AIG is slim. They work closely
with all the rating agencies. The agencies constantly monitor their capital
levels and know exactly what MBI is doing everyday.

I'm looking to get into the stock below $48 if it ever gets there.

Spreading the Risk?
Investigators hit MBIA, the big muni-bond insurer, with another round of
subpoenas

By JOHNATHAN R. LAING

THE PROBE INTO ABUSES of finite-risk reinsurance and other skulduggery has made
American International Group the target of breathless coverage in the financial
press. Already the four-decade boss of AIG, Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, and three
associates have been forced to walk the plank. And Warren Buffett, often viewed
as the conscience of American business, has been dragged into the affair and
forced to deny that he had full knowledge of an apparently fraudulent
reinsurance deal that one of his insurance units did with AIG.

But now the investigation, spearheaded by New York Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Justice
Department, is moving on a new front. Wednesday, Spitzer and the SEC hit giant
municipal-bond and financial-guarantee insurer MBIA with a second round of
subpoenas following their first requests for information in November. The stock
closed Friday at 52.12, after falling to a 52-week low of 51.25 earlier in the
day, amid fear that the company's triple-A debt rating, a sine qua non for a
financial-rating enhancer like MBIA, could be in jeopardy.

The subpoenas asked for information relating to MBIA's accounting treatment of
advisory fees, its methodology for determining loss and case reserves (reserves
set up for troubled risks), instances of purchase of credit-default protection
on itself and documents relating to Channel Reinsurance Ltd., a reinsurance
company of which MBIA (ticker: MBI) is part-owner. The requests strike at the
very heart of MBIA's business as the largest U.S. insurer of muni bonds and
other instruments, totaling some $890 billion in insured par value and debt
service at the end of 2004.
[ ]

The first round of subpoenas led MBIA last month to restate some six years of
earnings, chopping reported net income from 1998 to 2001 by around $60 million.
But these restatements were small change for a company that reported net income
of $815 million, or $5.63 a share, last year. That restatement arose from a $70
million payment MBIA received from Converium (then called Zurich Reinsurance
North America) in 1998, which at the time was depicted as a loss-reducing
reinsurance recovery for MBIA, but was, in substance, a loan. Now, based on
information obtained by Barron's, it appears that investigators are vastly
increasing the scope of their probe, and that past and present executives at
the Armonk, N.Y.-based company could face civil, and possibly even criminal,
fraud charges.

The latest subpoenas may give some credence to criticism that MBIA has played
fast and loose with its financials in delivering predictable double-digit
earnings growth over much of its three decades of existence. A controversial
2002 report by hedge-fund operator Gotham Partners asserted that MBIA was
overleveraged, deeply under-reserved against possible credit defaults and
overly exposed to guaranteeing dicey structured financings in addition to
plain-vanilla municipal bonds. Moreover, the report stated that the company
routinely accelerated its recognition of current income by classifying many of
its upfront guarantee fees as advisory fees taken at closing, rather than
accounted for over the life of, say, the bonds insured.

Others with knowledge of MBIA's operations further contend that MBIA has
artificially pumped up premium income and apparent portfolio credit quality by
insuring bonds in the secondary market that are fetching prices lower than
their stale credit ratings would dictate. Finally, some critics say that MBIA's
low loss ratios (only three-hundredths of a percentage point over its 30 years
of existence) may be testament more to a willingness to defer recognizing
problems than to layers of excess collateral, other underwriting protection and
its self-proclaimed prowess at restructurings.

The company has vociferously denied such charges. And its critics have mostly
been cowed by the company's strong financial performance, at least until
recently. Nonetheless, there appears to be a certain gap between the reality
the company seeks to convey and the actual fact.

Table: MBIA1

What MBIA's troubles could mean for bond investors2.

MBIA executives affect an earnest, church-deacon manner when marketing their
services to the modestly paid municipal and state finance officials, still the
very lifeblood of MBIA's business. Company officials are instructed, for
example, to drive unostentatious autos when making business calls. Yet several
tool to work in expensive high-performance Porsches and fancy BMWs. Current
Chairman Joseph "Jay" Brown for a time used a deep recess in the MBIA
headquarters garage to store eight or so of his vintage sports cars, all
swathed in specially fitted fabric covers when garaged.

MBIA's current regulatory problems arose from an incident in 1998, when a
Pennsylvania hospital group called Allegheny Health, Education and Research
Foundation (Aherf) declared bankruptcy, and MBIA was suddenly on the hook to
pay some $320 million in principal and interest over the remaining life of
bonds issued by an Aherf unit. The default was a public-relations disaster for
MBIA, which had long touted its "zero-loss" underwriting record. For MBIA had
made a rookie mistake, ignoring the government reimbursement problems then
savaging big-city hospitals. Moreover, the insured bonds lacked even the
minimal protection of a security interest in the mortgages of the facilities
underlying them.

Worse, MBIA was faced with taking a huge charge that would result in its first
quarterly loss ever. Among other things, the loss would likely cost MBIA's top
management their full $36 million cash bonuses that year.

So MBIA, investigators suspect, hit on the scheme of covering the loss with a
retroactive reinsurance policy, giving it a reinsurance recovery of $170
million to cover the present value of the future Aherf interest and principal
payments. Result: MBIA could show a better than 40% jump in pretax income that
year -- $565 million over what the income figure would have been without resort
to the reinsurance.

The payment came from three European reinsurers, Axa Re Finance, Munich Re and
Zurich Re (now Converium), with the first two anteing up $50 million apiece and
Converium $70 million of the $170 million cash payout. The key was to structure
the deal like bona fide reinsurance and not simply a loan, which would give
MBIA no accounting offset to the $170 million hit from Aherf to its 1998 income
statement. A loan, after all, is just another liability with interest costs
that penalize income.

To pay back the three reinsurers, MBIA agreed to "cede," or give, them $297
million in future premium flows over the next six years on some $45 billion par
value of issues underwritten by MBIA.

The key consideration for MBIA was that policies it was ceding had to transfer
real risk of loss. Otherwise, the premiums flowing to the reinsurers would
constitute just a loan repayment at a compounded interest rate of 9% to 10%.
<img src='http://

In last month's earnings restatement, MBIA confessed that Converium's $70
million portion of the $170 million payment to MBIA was indeed such a loan, or
in accounting terms, a "deposit." That was because "under separate agreements
to which MBIA was not a party" Converium, which has said its own accounting for
the deal was proper, reinsured all but a $13 million sliver of potential losses
on the MBIA business with AXA Re Finance. Moreover, MBIA disclosed in the same
news release that AXA also was contending that it had an "oral agreement" with
MBIA that all its assumed risk from Converium would revert to MBIA no later
than seven years from the date of the original deal, or October 2005. In other
words, the premium flow would be shared by the two reinsurers and the risk of
loss would return to MBIA.

MBIA's press release announcing last month's restatement asserted that "it
appears likely that such an agreement or understanding" with AXA was concluded
in 1998. But MBIA's current management denies knowledge of any secret deal with
AXA and says that its board began an internal investigation of the transactions
last fall only after AXA raised the issue.

Yet the only managers of consequence to leave MBIA following the Aherf fiasco
were former chairman and CEO David Elliott and former chief financial officer
Julie Tehrani. All the current top brass was in the executive suite in 1998,
with the exception of Chairman Joseph Brown, who was then a key MBIA director.
Investigators believe that the Converium-AXA deal was common knowledge among
MBIA executives at the time.

In fact, investigators have found information they believes indicates that the
deal, as brokered by Marsh & McLennan's Guy Carpenter unit, was even more
convoluted and opaque in structure because of Converium's reluctance to
reinsure bond issues with maturities as extended as 30 years and a desire to
make the transaction less penetrable to outside scrutiny. The day the deal was
closed in 1998, Converium passed, or "retroceded," all but a sliver of the risk
and therefore most of the future premium flow to Interpolis, the insurance unit
of Dutch banking concern Rabobank Group, which in turn retroceded the bulk of
its risk to AXA's financial-guarantee subsidiary in Madeira. The $70 million
payment to MBIA, though passed through Converium, actually came from Rabobank,
which then presumably got paid back with interest from future premium flow
sluicing through Converium on its way to AXA.

MBIA got exactly what it wanted from the overall reinsurance deal, even with
the Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance retrocession daisy chain on the Converium
portion: three then-blue-chip European reinsurers, all lending their stature,
diversity and credibility to what MBIA had to know would be controversial --
the Aherf bailout. Thus, the deal passed muster with MBIA's accountants and the
all-important rating agencies. Even if Converium was effectively just a "beard"
in the reinsurance deal, its name continued to appear in all MBIA press
releases and New York State Insurance Commission statutory filings as one of
the big three in the deal.

According to MBIA, the other two Aherf reinsurance deals, with Munich Re and
with AXA directly, were bona fide because real risk of loss was passed on to
both. Perhaps so. But MBIA did cede to them only the best of its new insurance
production, and the two insurers are said to have suffered next to no claims
losses, though MBIA declined to confirm that fact to Barron's. That would mean
that both insurers pocketed the bulk of the nearly $200 million in premiums
they've received over the past six years, in return for the $100 million they
collectively advanced to MBIA.

Likewise, MBIA saw fit to commute, or take back, its original reinsurance deal
with AXA last October at the same time MBIA reassumed the controversial
AXA-Converium piece of the deal. MBIA insists that the commutation of the
direct AXA deal six years to the day of the original transaction had nothing to
do with any additional secret side deal. According to MBIA, the move was
dictated by a downgrade in AXA's credit rating and the French insurer's
decision to get out of the financial-guarantee business.

The latest round of subpoenas is homing in on a Bermuda reinsurer called
Channel Reinsurance Ltd., which seems to have close ties to MBIA. To be sure,
MBIA owns only 17.4% of the company, which it helped establish in early 2004
with a $64 million equity investment. The remaining $300 million of Channel's
equity capital came from Renaissance Re, Koch Financial Re and Partner Re.

But MBIA is Channel's sole source of business. Likewise, Channel's chairman is
the self-same David Elliott who stepped down from the corresponding position at
MBIA in 1999 in the wake of the Aherf mess. Of its five employees, Channel's
president and chief executive, Michael Maguire, and its CFO, Elizabeth
Sullivan, both were long-time executives at MBIA before joining Channel.

The close ties have obviously piqued the interest of investigators. Perhaps
most telling is the fact that MBIA seems to have granted its fellow Channel
investors the lineaments of a guaranteed return, which, of course, would remove
much of the risk of loss for investors other than MBIA on the MBIA business
assumed by Channel.

A Standard & Poor's report from last year explains the arrangement: "With
regard to transaction economics, the longer-term agreement between Channel Re
[and MBIA] includes protections for Channel Re if the projected profitability
of business ceded by MBIA falls below agreed levels during any underwriting
year. If these provisions are triggered, then Channel Re gains certain rights
that allow it to improve the projected profitability of ceded business until
the agreed profitability levels are reestablished."

MBIA officials insist that this isn't an actual "make whole" agreement
protecting Channel's other investors from risk of loss because the agreement
applies to "projected," rather than past results. But that can be a distinction
without substance.

The agreement wouldn't necessarily stop MBIA from dumping on Channel performing
but troubled policies from its existing portfolio, with the proviso that it
could make up any quality problems later. In this manner, MBIA could buy time
by getting potential workout loans off its balance sheet. Also, effectively
reinsuring itself allows an insurer to neatly side-step limits on exposure to,
say, a single risk. In just one year Channel Re now reinsures over 35% of the
$85.5 billion in insured par ceded by MBIA to reinsurers.

MBIA has long projected an image of robust financial health and transcendent
social mission. But these days, its executives can't be sleeping easy with
investigators crawling through their books. That could be nothing compared with
the nightmares that may lie ahead for MBIA investors, if the company can't hang
on to its triple-A credit rating.

From:Paul Senior
Yes, Suma. It's a statistical approach for me. I like to buy a package of these
type companies (if I can find them) and hope the winners go up more than the
losers fall. Only rarely do I find any of these companies to have earnings when
I buy them. (Others though, perhaps Brinks for example, may have better success
or screens in finding profitable ones.)

Some additional background info. for you:

In past I've tried to bring some judgment about the business or business
prospects to the purchase decision - I have tried to evaluate why each of the
companies seems to be so downtrodden and evaluate the prospect of a turnaround.
I've been very wrong in some of my judgments. For example, I passed on SINA (a
great Steve168 call!) which rose maybe 50x from where it sold below cash. I
keep trying to avoid making judgments for stocks in this particular category
(below cash plays), but I find it very difficult to stop myself from doing so.

Others will only buy if they have analyzed the company and prospects and
believe they see opportunity or catalyst. Brinks and TPE is an example perhaps.

I've not kept good records of my performance here. I believe most of these
stocks have worked out. Losses have occurred in one of three ways:
1.Company disintegrates - wiping out the investment.
2.I lose patience and sell too soon. (Patience is often required here: 2-3
years is reasonable.)
3.The gains are so small as to be insignificant - especially if the time value
of money is considered. (Perhaps knowledge of the company's prospects and only
picking one or a few of these companies lets an investor more confidently make
bigger bets and get more profits than I do. That way is too risky or difficult
for me though.)

TFS sold below cash + marketable securities when I bought. I bought here:

I was wrong when I described the cash amount. It was actually cash+marketable
securities.

There was a spin-off of those "marketable securities" - a company. As I recall
I sold my TFS shares and the spin-off shares I received for more than my
purchase price. To my mind TFS was a below-cash play that worked out okay. Not

Hoyasaxa: one stock or fund for the next 18 years (i.e. a newborn's future)?

CD might be okay. (I expect to hold my CD shares maybe five or more years, and
adding shares ocassionally.) I'm almost always focused on my latest
ideas/research, so now, today, and subject to change, I'd pick Wrigley - good
growth, and a buyer is fairly sure it won't be obsoleted and that the company
will still be around in the next 20 years - generating good profits too (one
hopes).

Funds? I don't follow any close enough. I'd look for a money manager. I'm not
qualified to pick, but that won't stop me from presenting my ideas. I'd look
for somebody sharp, somebody you might be able to trust (if there are such
people), somebody young enough to be around long enough, and somebody hungry
enough to care about how he/she might perform for you. I offer three names: Jim
Clarke - find out what fund he's managing and check him out. He's tough, smart
and disciplined (and he can pick stocks). He has a lot of admirers here. Also
maybe Mike Burry (this thread's founder) who might be managing a hedge fund.
Quick, aggressive, smart. He might be okay. If it were me, I'd seriously
consider giving monies to Dale Baker. He's accessible, documents his stuff
including errors (anybody can and will document their successes), has a good
success record, likes value, searches the world for it, and maybe is flexible
enough with clients to invest with a specific risk profile that would be
tailored to each client.
I'd much rather have someone like Baker opportunistically pick stocks for me
over the next 18 years than just trust myself to pick one or a few stocks to be
bought now and put away for years and years.

DISCLAIMER: I don't know any of these guys. Heck, given this is cyberspace -
maybe they're all the same guy. In any case, I have no relationship with them,
I don't correspond privately with them, I can't recall the last time Clarke or
Burry posted here. I, my wife, my cats, we don't socialize with them, their
wives, their girlfriends, or their cats. Plus... I would like to believe I'm a
better stock picker than these three... even if it's not so - lol.

ASIDE: Hoyasaxa, didn't you say in a post a few years back that you were a
financial or stock analyst at one point? Perhaps you are too modest: it's your
own good stock ideas now and maybe later that might be valued by your family!
And don't limit your brain to stocks. Real estate - a home for example -- has

Right you are they spun off:

Three-Five Systems Completes Brillian Spinoff
Tuesday, September 16, 2003

TEMPE, Ariz., Sept. 16 -- Three-Five Systems Inc. (TFS) announced it has
completed the spinoff of its subsidiary, Brillian Corp., by means of a special
dividend distributed to stockholders yesterday. The Brillian common stock was
expected to begin trading on Nasdaq as "BRLC" today.

TFS and Brillian will each continue to maintain corporate headquarters in the
Tempe, Ariz., facility owned by TFS that also houses Brillian's high-volume
microdisplay manufacturing operations. Brillian also maintains its Personal
Display Systems Group in Boulder, Colo. Neither company is expected to relocate
facilities or personnel or to reduce staff as a result of the spinoff.

You had to sell this one off quickly to realize max value:

Brinks: selling tactic:

regarding, "I always remove cost upon a double and hold "free" shares forever."

Yes, this can be a really good idea. Especially if & when one is in the
fortunate position of having a stock move up many times original price. In one
sense, you don't have to worry about what point to start to take profits,
because every point is profit after you've got your cost out. Makes it easier
to ride 'em up. Well, imo.

Selling 1/2 after a double just seems too pat for me though. My idea is to buy
undervalued and sell only near full value or fair value. I don't want to use
arbitrary sell rules to reduce my position to protect profits when the stock is
still undervalued. My problem though is that I quite often misjudge what fair
or full value is - I just seem to hold on too long. And so maybe I should be
selling to get my cost out if my tendency is to ride 'em too long.

I'm just not consistent or logical sometimes. For example, sold 1/2 of my EGR
position when it popped, but still holding all shares of TPE:

I'm not talking about Graham value plays for selling 1/2 on doubles but high
risk junior energy plays like Storm Cat, AOGI, TPE, etc. As you pointed out how
can one determine a true value of Storm Cat at any point in time? You can't.

I have about seven of these now. It only makes sense to follow this program.
Also at times you can later reload position should it come back down. If one
owns a "free" position in a high risk situation you can be very relaxed about
price flucuations. In fact, I find myself cheering for a decline so I can
reload.

your logic is compelling, and from what I can tell, your record with these
things is better than good.

Perhaps it's not position size at all that should influence or dictate
decisions to avoid or make sells, but rather as you say, what is the best
approach given our inability (or anybody's) to value these things at current
price? Logic, perhaps probability, maybe experience, seems to indicate you are
correct with your methodology.

However, I appreciate the time you spent outlining our choices and I have three
that I have recently purchased and continue to think are values. There are two
that I have mentioned on this board: ARDI and IMOS. I have also been buying
NPTH, which is the market leader in venous introducers. This is a micro-cap
that is fairly illiquid. They had a recent ruling by the FDA that will delay
their new steroid-eluding epicardial lead, but this new product has been
approved in Europe for one company. I also think that their proprietary
advanced delivery catheters that will be targeted initially at the atrial
fibrillation (“AF”) ablation and carotid stenting markets could be successful
products. These are large markets that could substantially add to a company

I believe what the difference between you and I is as follows: I will take a
relatively large position in Storm Cat (% wise to total portfolio) on ground
level basis based upon some very extensive due diligence. At this point in time
it is high risk. To reduce the risk in my portfolio to Storm Cat I will
liquidate let's say one-half the position to recover my cost and ride the
remaining "free" shares. I hope that the share price will decline so I will be
able to decide whether to "reload" the Storm Cat position. What you are saying
that your Storm Cat position is not that significant relative to your total
portfolio. I understand therefore your reasoning then.

latest company p.r. from Monday looks promising to me:

"Shaw's backlog totaled $5.1 billion at February 28, 2005, with approximately
$2.4 billion, or 46% of the backlog expected to be converted during the next 12

Third Value seems like an easy choice, but I'd pass on it. Marty Whitman's 80
years old. He was on Bloomberg for an hour this week - still sharp but slipping
a bit; he has aged since I last saw him on TV. (Cripes, I'm slipping too. Ugh)
C. Jensen, his main(?) successor may be good, but may not be as good as The
Master.

Check WSJ, 4/4 Quarterly Mutual Fund Review, pg. r4 article on John Keeley of
Keeley Small-Cap Value. Family and friends of Keeley invest in this value and
restructuring fund. Ten year annualized return of 17.4%, according to the
article. No investment greater than 1.2% of assets. Has a high load fee though,
which they might be considering reducing. (Possibly I've got my preferences in
this suggestion more so than what you might be wanting - namely, I like the
value aspect, the off-beat stuff (restructuring), the diversity, the family
business (eats own cooking), and investment experience (Keeley's 64 years
old)).

Also look at Torray fund. He makes concentrated buys with the view of holding
his stocks ten years or more. (aside: He's been a buyer of BUD. Wonder what his
opinion of it is now.)

All jmo, I'm no expert, and I am wrong a lot.

just US$14.0 million and the market could put a value on this of $1 or $2
billion when it finds out about them. This means we have a chance to make $100
for every $1 invested, it is like being a seed investor in Google."

I'm starting to look at WMT and one thing that really leaps out from their
balance sheet is the negative working capital, which was negative $3 Billion as
of January 31, 2004. Part of this can be attributed to their aggressive
management of AP, and I'm sort of okay with that. However, Accrued Liabilities
at $10 Billion and counting is also a huge piece of it, and I'm having trouble
understanding the accounting. A small part of it is accrued membership fees,
which is fine, but the bulk of it seems to be hedges. Here's how they describe
it in the 2004 AR:

The Company entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the
foreign currency risk of certain foreign-denominated debt. These swaps are
designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency exchange risk. The
agreements are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for
fixed-rate payments in another currency. Changes in the foreign currency spot
exchange rate result in reclassification of amounts from other accumulated
comprehensive income to earnings to offset transaction gains or losses on
foreigndenominated debt. These instruments mature in fiscal 2007 and 2009.

The Company entered into an interest rate swap to lock in the interest rate on
floating debt. Under the swap agreement, the Company pays a fixed interest rate
and receives variable interest payments periodically over the life of the
instrument. The notional, or contractual amount is used to measure interest to
be paid or received and does not represent the exposure due to credit loss. As
the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments exactly
match those of the instruments being hedged, we have applied the “short-cut”
method of accounting provided under FAS 133 and FAS 138. As such, the
derivative instrument as assumed to be a perfect hedge and all changes in fair
value of the hedges were recorded on the balance sheet in other comprehensive
income

The Company expects that the amount of gain or loss existing in other
accumulated comprehensive income to be reclassified into earnings within the
next 12 months will not be significant.

Hedging instruments with a favorable fair value are classified as other assets
and deferred charges in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Those instruments with
an unfavorable fair value are classified as accrued liabilities.

I'm confused. If this is treated as a "perfect hedge" and any gains and losses
are handled in comprehensive income, shouldn't this be B/S neutral? Does the
last paragraph mean that if a $1 Billion hedge has a fair value of one dollar
it's a $1 Billion asset, but if it has a fair value of minus one dollar it's a
$1 Billion liability? If that's true, it's insane.

I've looked around and I can't find any source that even mentions the negative
working capital issue. Maybe it's just me, but I'm having trouble understanding
why this isn't at least worth an explanation, especially for a company whose
net profit margins run around 3%.

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.

re WMT - the negative working capital is really a good thing since it means
that WMT collects it's money faster than it pays it's suppliers. Regarding the
accrued liabilities, you are right that most of them are due to interest rate
(around 8B$) and currency (2B$). Since WMT has about 20B$ in LT debt, it means
that about 50% of that debt is hedged against currency and interest rates
moves. Sounds OK to me. The 12B$ sounds like a huge number but WMT has about
50B$ in revenue abroad which puts that number in perspective.

AIG , bought back into AIG ( at a higher price - sigh) after it appears
unlikely that Spitzer will press criminal charges against AIG. That was the
biggest concern regarding AIG since criminal charges are very damaging to any
financial business. So i hope that Hank just massaged the numbers a little (2B$
is little for a giant like AIG) rather than cooked the books a la Worldcom.
Going forward, this won't the the old AIG any more but still a very strong
insurer, at least that's what I am betting on.

Thanks for the reply Spekulatius. I think I'm going to be struggling with this
one for a while.

the negative working capital is really a good thing since it means that WMT
collects it's money faster than it pays it's suppliers.

I understand that, and as I said I'm sort of okay with the Accounts Payable
piece of it. I do worry about what would happen if their suppliers (especially
their foreign suppliers) become more stringent in their terms, particularly if
this were to happen at a time of slowing demand that puts pressure on
inventories.

That being said, it's the Accrued Liabilities piece that really has me
flummoxed. I don't understand why, based on the way they are described, those
hedges are carried as liabilities. If they are real liabilities, I need to
understand what they are and how they are structured. If they are not, I need
to understand the accounting, because it sounds crazy.

The 12B$ sounds like a huge number but WMT has about 50B$ in revenue abroad
which puts that number in perspective.

At the end of the day (c.p.) the $50B turns into about $1.5B on the bottom
line, which puts the $50B in perspective.

I agree that if current conditions continue, WMT is a great business and a
great buy. However, if one believes (as I do) that we could face severe
dislocations as the U.S. Current Account deficit unwinds, it is important to
understand the worst case scenarios.

I read a front page article in wall street journal on line and I was pretty
shocked by what I read. apparently hank had a big interest in a bermuda insurer
that did 47% of its business with AIG. I am getting this sense of having seen
something like this in the past that did not turn out well for shareholders.
the sec got a court order to prevent interested parties from removing 87 boxes
of documents from this company premises. Caveat Emptor!

Added a few shares of homebuilder CTX to my position.

Homebuilders --- ah, what really low pride:shame stocks.

Let's see, from what I can tell there are about four people on SI who have
admitted they own any homebuilder stocks recently. Three of 'em are on this
thread. Everywhere else, as I see it, when people mention the homebuilder
stocks, not only are they avoiding them as buys, they are actively shorting
them or considering shorting them.

Oh to admit one owns and is buying more of these stocks. How embarrassing it is

homebuilders -- ha. I fall into all 4 sides of this question.

1. I still own RYL. (Paul, I bought it 800 days ago, when we talked about it.)

2. I sold all my KBH and SFP a month ago. (I owned them for a few years.)

3. I am considering buying some back. (It's crazy.)

4. But after the WSJ atrticle (4-7 page D1) which talked about unsold homes
piling up here and there, I could not build up the courage to reinvest.

But if owned 2,800 different stocks, like you do, then I'd buy a few more
homebuilders too. :o)

worry, worry, worry...

I traded out of WMT, as I heard the talking heads on CNBC Wed. morning give
their negative opinions (one guy threw it out as a short idea), as well as
mentioning the B of A downgrade/expectation of low end of the range. I don't
trade on such "talk" all that often, but I had a modest ST gain in place, and
the stock was trading up despite the negative news - the positive market tone
that day didn't hurt.

I am now getting interested in BUD at these levels, that seems to me like a
better bet on a reversion to mean basis. The PE multiple is at or near the low
end on an historical basis. The period the stock is entering is seasonally
strong; if the summer is warmer than normal, that would bode well for the stock
(of course, the inverse could also happen).

I just can't get too excited about WMT, the shame factor is there for me, as
well. I went into a store the other day, the retail experience there doesn't
set me on fire. We, as a family, generally shop TGT for the comparable
essentials. They (WMT) keep repeating, in their releases on comps., how
groceries are the biggest part of the increase in SS comps.; as we've noted,
this is the lower margin part of the business, and that can't help the bottom
line.

I have almost everything in Vanguard Funds. They do a management service for a
low % of return. I had messed up my financials so many times, investing in
something called Asset Protection Trust that went belly up.. They lawyers are
like scavengers suing one fund after another. Evergreen ...and the story was
that all monies would be invested in Government Bonds etc. All lies. GEtting
back 5 cents on the dollar...

Lost a bundle like life's savings. So, decided to have professionals manage
everything.

My fun is in having a Scottsdale Account and investing with them and also
Steifel where bulk of my own picked long term holds are .But thank you for this
recommendation.

In Vanguard I am well diversified. Most of their funds however are index
funds.. Don't know how good that is.

Restaurant stocks: I'm still looking to buy in the sector if anyone here has
any suggestions.

I closed my APPB position today. Company continues okay, but I've lost
patience. Just doesn't seem to be a value play at current price. Have also
recently trimmed OSI and SWRG.

Still holding, fwiw - and I'm not saying that these are value buys:
