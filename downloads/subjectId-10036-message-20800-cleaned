Stewart Whitman: Thanks for this updated list. I'll check out a few new names
there.

I have the very distinct feeling I either have a story about each of these
stocks or I eventually will have. And (sigh) many times that story will be
accompanied by regret on my part. So I too will will wince when recalling these
names. Such is life I guess.

JJZ: Still holding a few shares from when it was called USI. Have sold almost
all buys though as stock has risen from depths (2001)

CMCSA: Had bought this one as a value play based partly on what I read of value
funds and Mr. Simpson's/Mr. Buffett's buying it.
I am presuming - and I could be very wrong here- that Mr. Buffett bought CMCSA
under $30. If stock drops from current price (about $32.79), to that lower
number, and on no adverse news - I will up my small position. (If anybody here
does have knowledge of Mr. Buffett's buy price, I'd like to know what that
price is.)

One source I read stated the 5 mil Comcast shares were bought on April 30, two
days after Comcast dropped its bid for Disney. That would put the average
purchase price in the 30.05 - 30.91 range.

Toy sector: Fwiw, I recently took on a very few shares of BNDCY.pk. I still
have a few shares left of TOY, RCRC, KDE, and MAT.

Bandai seems to be innovative and creative (I'd guess they'd have to be to stay
strong in the toy biz.), as well as bottom-line oriented (which I have not
necessarily found as an objective with some Japanese companies I've looked at
in past).

Bet is that Bandai might eventually come up with some new products or

BRKa/b - I've never been to Omaha. I know folks who've gone in the past. My
impression is that it's a crowd scene - 20,000 of your closest friends <gulp!>.
I read the reports online, Whitney Tilson's notes, and the OID review much
later.

For myself, for many years I've attended Munger's Wesco meeting in Pasadena the
Wednesday after Omaha. Far as I can tell, it repeats much of the discussion
from the Berkshire meeting. Plus it has unadulterated Charlie. In the past it
was very small. Before the meeting you had the opportunity to chat with Charlie
over coffee. At various meetings I've been able to ask questions of Lou Simpson
and his staff, talk to Janet Lowe, meet value guys, question Alice Schroeder,
quiz folks from Precision Steel, CORT, etc. And of course get rather candid
responses from Charlie.

HOWEVER..........Last year the meeting spilled over into two rooms at the
University Club. The second room was serviced by closed circuit TV. ie, it's
now an event. I notice that this year it will be held at the Pasadena Hilton. I
wonder about its investment utility????

MSHI- "The valuation is reasonable trading at ~9-10x PE and 1x book value. Mkt

yahoo!:

"For the nine months ended 12/31/04, net sales rose 15% to HK$316.1 million.Net
income totaled HK$22.4 million, up from HK$336 thousand. Revenues reflect the
recovery of business. Net income reflects the inclusion of a HK$34.2 million

What a mess at ChoicePoint - apparently at least a couple of security breaches
at this electronic info. provider. Maybe several thousand people defrauded to
some extent. Top guys maybe sold stock when they maybe had non-public knowledge
of these troubles. Lawsuits aplenty now. Congressional hearings maybe.

I've no knowledge other than the allegations and suspicions and problems listed
in the media, but it looks to me like the business is still intact.

The stock's come down of course: now it looks like a "relative" "bargain" if I
look at possible forward p/e (18-19) vs. its historical p/e's and its current
psr (3.8) vs. past five years' averages (>4.3). For what a buyer pays for the
stock now, the profit margins (about 15%) are attractive (to me, assuming the
business will still be good going forward).

I'll start just a very small exploratory position.

The Jewelry business is profitable. You'd have to strip out the expenses for
the real estate investments as well as the rental income. Using the nine month
figures, HK87.77 (Gross profit) minus HK62.95 (SG&A) is HK24.82 in operating
income for the Pearl (jewelry) business.

It's hard to say if the real estate business should be considered part of
continuing operatings. The company has been selling properties for the past two
years and recently sold another one at the end of last year. I believe they
have about 17 or 18 building left that are being leased to third-parties that
could be sold. Apparently, rental income was down in the last quarter because
of a recent sale.

Maybe a better way to value this company would be to do a sum of the parts
analysis, apply a PE multiple to the Jewelry business and then add the value of
the RE. I haven't done that yet, but it would be an interesting exercise.

I'd like to see them out of the RE business all together and just focus on
jewelry.

Well, glad to you like BDT. I really am amazed by the way this co. is managed.
Although growth has not been linear, the stock has gone up nicely over the
years, along with book value, shareholders' equity and cash on hand.

I also like the fact that the company has slowly migrated part of its business
to the U.S., in Salt Lake City and Seattle. IMO there is still a lot of room to
diversify to other regions like Minneapolis or Denver, just to name those two
possibilities.

Anyway I am in and awaiting my first dividends.

Marc Fortier. DCI. Oh yes, I remember our occasional discussion on this one
over the past years. Very good company, better than the filter companies I had
been looking at the time and since.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=15018126

I certainly made a couple mistakes with DCI. Not buying it when you first
brought it to the thread, but more significantly from my persective, not being
willing to step up if, or as, I recognized that the company might continue to
do well in future. My quick look shows the stock was about maybe $20 or so back
then, now about $65 (before the split).

Congrats for holding on (extra points too if you reinvested div.'s or added
along the way).

Might be considered classic investing - find a good company selling for a
reasonable price (not even a really cheap price at the time), hold on, give the
management and other employees time to build revenues and assets.

Very sorry I didn't listen to you or wasn't able to hear you. To do well - imo
- it's not necessary to have a stock like DCI as a large position (but it
surely helps -g-); just small amounts of dollars in a few companies like this
over time can make a substantial difference to portfolio results. So it's not
like I was having to decide to put 10% or even 5% of my portfolio at risk. A
small exploratory position, even if not added to, would've suited me and
would've helped me. Ah well. (And it still might be a good buy today when we
look back five years from now.)

The Stent Wars Continue
By Stephen D. Simpson, CFA
March 8, 2005

War has been declared.

http://www.fool.com/News/mft/2005/mft05030815.htm?source=eptyholnk303100&logvis
t=y&npu=y

The combatants: medical device heavyweights Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), Boston
Scientific (NYSE: BSX), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ).

The weapons: Drug-coated (also called drug-eluting) stents.

The target: The clogged arteries of your heart.

The stakes: A U.S. market worth at least $4 billion.

Of course, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson were so gauche as to start
the fight before Medtronic was ready. So while Medtronic is still working on
the clinical trials to get Food and Drug Administration approval, J&J and
Boston Scientific have been beating each other silly for market share for some
time now. While J&J captured the early lead (not so hard to do when you're the
first on the market), Boston Scientific came roaring back and holds about
two-thirds of the market.

Last weekend, more data was presented at the American College of Cardiology
(one of the preeminent medical meetings -- think Woodstock for cardiologists)
pertaining to drug-coated stents, and this data suggests that the battles are
far from over.

People were paying particular attention to two studies -- one from J&J that
hoped to show superiority over the Boston Scientific stent, and the other from
Medtronic just hoping to show enough efficacy to get into the game.

For Johnson & Johnson, the results were bad news touched with a silver lining.
Although the study failed to show that Cypher (J&J's stent) was any better than
Taxus (Boston Scientific's stent), it did suggest that the Cypher was just as
easy to deliver.

Deliverability is a big deal in the stent world -- placing a stent requires
inserting it into the femoral artery (in the groin) and threading it through
the body up into the heart. While this isn't quite as hard as it sounds (though
it's by no means easy), a stent that is hard to deliver can make the whole
process much more time-consuming and aggravating.

Despite the general perception that the Cypher and Taxus stents were clinically
equivalent, Taxus gained so much of its market share due mostly to the
perception that its stent was easier to deliver. With this new study, Johnson &
Johnson perhaps has an opportunity to regain some ground.

For Medtronic, the results for its Endeavor stent were quite good. While it can
be tricky and misleading to compare clinical trials, I believe it's pretty safe
to say that the Medtronic stent is at least equivalent to Cypher or Taxus, and
may in fact be better. Though the company expects to begin selling the Endeavor
in Europe in 2005, U.S. approval isn't likely until at least 2006.

Whither the market goest?

In the short term, Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific are going to
continue to go at each other like sugared-up kids at a Whac-A-Mole game. With
clinical efficacy (and deliverability) essentially equal, the game turns to
marketing -- whose sales force can better impress the customer and who can
bundle together the most attractive package of freebies and throw-ins to lower
the total cost to the user.

Once Medtronic enters the market in 2006 or so, the same will be true. Clinical
efficacy won't matter nearly as much as marketing prowess. And on that score,
given Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific's lead, Medtronic may find it
difficult to push its way in to the market without discounting.

Luckily, there are numerous angles for Fools to explore on their own. Not only
does each player offer something different -- J&J is a global health-care
colossus, Boston Scientific has the most leverage to stents, Medtronic has a
broad range of growing device businesses -- but ride-along opportunities like
SurModics (Nasdaq: SRDX), Angiotech Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: ANPI), and Abbott
Labs (NYSE: ABT), all of whom make the coatings or drugs for those companies,
broaden the scope as well.

Fool contributor Stephen Simpson owns shares of Johnson & Johnson.

Dynasil Announces Acquisition of Optometrics LLC

Business Editors

WEST BERLIN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 9, 2005--Dynasil Corporation of
America (OTCBB:DYSL), fabricator of optical blanks from synthetic fused silica,
fused quartz, and other optical materials for the semi-conductor, laser, space
and optical components industries is pleased to announce that it has completed
the purchase of Optometrics LLC of Ayer, Massachusetts.
Optometrics is a worldwide supplier of quality optical components including
diffraction gratings, lenses, thin film filters, laser optics, monochromators,
and specialized optical systems and software. The previous owners of
Optometrics LLC, Ms. Laura Lunardo and Mr. Frank Denton, signed two year,
renewable employment contracts and will continue to actively lead the
Optometrics business which will now be Optometrics Corporation. Additionally,
Ms. Lunardo is now Dynasil's CFO. The anticipated revenues for the combined
companies are expected to exceed $6 million. $700,000 of equity in the form of
Dynasil convertible preferred stock was raised from existing and new
shareholders to finance the acquisition in addition to bank financing.
Dynasil has been a long term supplier to Optometrics and glass is a key raw
material for Optometrics' products. Mr. Craig Dunham, Dynasil President and
CEO, had the following comments on the acquisition: "I believe that Optometrics
is an excellent addition to Dynasil with Optometrics' record of profitable
growth, strong people, and optical customers/markets that fit well with
Dynasil. The year is off to a good start with strong orders in both companies.
The combination of the two companies is expected to lead to increased
profitability for both companies. We look forward to acquiring similar strong
companies with growth opportunities and synergy with our current businesses."
Mr. Frank Denton, CEO of Optometrics commented that "We believe that Dynasil
and Optometrics have complementary strengths which should auger well for the
future and that the sum is much greater than the individual parts."

About Dynasil: Founded in 1960, Dynasil Corporation of America is a fabricator
of optical blanks from synthetic fused silica, fused quartz and other optical
materials.

Hi Paul - Yes another new low for GM. I bought a few more shares to add to my
small position. I am betting that in the long run that GM w/ their China
venture will pay dividends when they start selling cars & trucks manufactured
in China. I am told that the Chinese like our "Monster Trucks". Also, it's
possible that GM will move more of their North America production capacity into
Canada as the health care benefits and costs are much less in Canada than in
the U.S..

There are still significant problems for GM that lie ahead and things could get
much worse before they get better.

I also picked up some Comcast to start a small position. This is not a "value"
stock but Warren Buffet a value investor did establish a large position earlier
this year. Perhaps he sees something in the value of these assets and the free
flow cash flows. However, earnings are small and the PE is very high.

Finally, ABS may break $20 soon and I will wait to pick up some more shares of
the preferred when the common trades sub $20.

The only other value offering I am looking at are the five year "TIPs" Treasury
Inflation Protected bonds which come up for auction in April. This is a
re-offering and the first time the five year TIPs are made available this year
through Treasury Direct. The value play is that you can buy them through
Treasury Direct w/ no transaction fee.

Paul, don't feel sorry that you missed DCI. I am sure you made up for it with
good investments of your own. Take NTE for example, I know that you bought in
the story a while ago. I guess that you already have a nice return on paper --
and you have collected quite a few dividends along the way... I have read
enough of your posts to know that you are a serious investor and have your
share of success. Having found one Donaldson in my life does not make me better
than you are. And don't forget, you can still take a position when you like.
Just keep it on your radar screen.

It's not easy to buy good stocks and hold on to them through the good and bad
times. I'd say that it is particularly tough right now. When you listen to guys
like Buffett (or here in Canada Stephen Jarislowsky) talking about the world
economy, the U.S. dollar and all that could go wrong on Planet Earth, you
wonder why you take all this time to read annual reports, press releases,
commentaries, etc., if you are to lose your hard won money in the next
financial tsunami.

Just this week two of my stocks (ATD.sv.b and DII.mv, both on the TSX) were
beaten badly, even though management delivered superb results. Well, that's the
way it is: skepticism keeps valuation in check somehow -- and valuation remains
more rational this way, I guess. Still, it's always a disappointment and you
never get used to it... Which leads me to the one and only truth that really
matters: forget about the stock; as long as the company do well, you'll be just
fine.

In my experience, picking good stocks and sticking with them despite the
short-term bumps is really the only way to beat the markets consistently over
time. Chasing the main index names certainly doesn't work unless they are in a
big cyclical bull like the 1990's and 1980's.

Otherwise you can spend years getting nowhere, like the indexes since 1998.
Correct stockpicking (and for Buffett, his other investments buying full
companies or special financial deals) is your only defense against random
market action - if you stick with it.

Just my two cents.

I liked your pick JRJC. It looks like China's stock market is due for a
recovery, and JRJC will benefit. Have you seen any signs that the market there
is picking up?

I was just trying to digest this article:

China's trade up 35%

BEIJING - China registered more than 30% growth in both exports and imports in
2004 and the total two-way trade volume topped US$1 trillion to $1.15474
trillion (9.5576 trillion yuan), up 35.7% from 2003. This includes $593.36
billion worth imports and $561.38 billion worth exports, surging by 35.4% and
36.0%, respectively, creating a trade surplus of $31.98 billion.

This is the third consecutive year that China's foreign trade has reported a
hectic growth of over 20%. Meanwhile, China's dependency on foreign trade
climbed 10 percentage points to hit 70%, raising fears of economic fluctuation
risks. China's imports maintained a monthly increase of over 40% from 2003, to
the first half of 2004, thanks to the hectic domestic demand. But overheated
imports, particularly in conventional trade, were cooled down by national
macroeconomic control measures in the second half of 2004.

The import growth in July-October dropped to 34.2%, 35.6%, 22.1% and 29.3%
respectively. Though the trade volume hit a record $52.71 billion in December,
it only saw an increase of 24.6%. The trade deficit in January-June reached
$6.82 billion, with that in the first four months even topping $10.76 billion.
But the situation has turned for the better from September, with the trade
surplus reaching a record $11.08 billion in December.

Among imports, steel products and nonferrous metal materials, badly affected by
the macroeconomic control measures, increased much slower than others. Imports
of steel products were valued at $20.787 billion by 2004, up 4.4% over the
previous year, but down 24 percentage points as against 28.4% in the first
quarter, and 7.7 percentage points lower than in the first half; that of
unforged copper and copper products increased by 37.9%, declining 18.6 and 11.2
percentage points over the first quarter and the first half of 2004
respectively.

Affected by the country's demand undulation, imports of automobile and chassis
amounted to 176,000 units, worth $5.33 billion, with a slight rise of 2.1% and
2.4% respectively. Imports of crude oil and finished oil surged by 34.8% and
34.1% to reach 122.72 million tons and 37.88 million tons, with import payment
jumping by 71.4% and 57.7% due to soaring oil prices.

Foreign-funded enterprises have dominated China's foreign trade. Their exports
in 2004 hiked by 40.9% over 2003 to hit $338.606 billion, 5.5 percentage points
faster than the growth of total export. It accounted for 57.07% of the total,
up 2.24 percentage points over 2003, contributing to 63.4% of the trade boom.
In contrast, state-owned enterprises' exports increased only 11.4% to reach
$153.588 billion, 25.88% of the total as against 31.49% in the previous year.

Domestic private enterprises unveiled an apparent drop in exports in the last
few months after a period of drastic growth. Exports of mechano-electronic
products maintained a monthly growth of above 30% from the middle of 2002 to
August 2004, with the proportion in the country's total export rising
continuously. Exports of mechano-electronic products amounted to $323.402
billion in 2004, soaring 42.3% over the previous year, 6.9 percentage points
higher than the growth of total exports. It made up 54.5% of total exports, 2.6
percentage points higher than the average in 2003. It contributed to 61.9% of
trade growth in the year.

Meanwhile, high-tech product exports totaled $165.539 billion in 2004, rising
50.2% over the previous year, the growth is 7.9 percentage points faster than
that of mechano-electronic products. It made up 27.9% of the total export and
has contributed to 35.7% of export growth. High-tech products realized a trade
surplus of $4.11 billion in 2004, as against a trade deficit of $9.02 billion
in 2003.

Exports by private enterprises presented a new bright spot since Chinas
accession to the WTO, thanks to the delegation of export power, the improvement
of international trading environment and the enhanced competitiveness in
China's labor-intensive sectors. Exports turned out to be $101.161 billion last
year, a surge of 68.6% over 2003, and nearly doubling the country's total
growth. It accounted for 17.05% of total exports, a rise of 3.36 percentage
points over 2003, and has contributed to 26.5% of export growth.

The United States, the European Union and Hong Kong are the three main trading
partners of China. Combined exports to the three countries came to $332.982
billion in 2004, 56.12% of total exports, contributing to 55% of export growth.
Exports to the US were $124.947 billion; to the EU, $107.163 billion; and to
Hong Kong, $100.872 billion, surging 35.1%, 36.9% and 32.2% respectively.

China's exports to Asian countries such as Japan, ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) countries, South Korea, and Taiwan and to Russia,
Brazil and South Africa all kept increasing. Leading in China's exports were
the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, which exported $198.005
billion and $169.458 billion in the first 11 months of 2004, increasing by
47.68% and 24.5% year-on-year respectively.

The Yangtze River Delta, which is viewed as the center of newly added foreign
investment, accounted for 37.39% of the country's total exports, 3.36
percentage points higher over 2003 and 6.69 percentage points more than in
2002. However, exports by the Pearl River Delta dropped.

Contractual and actually used amount of foreign capital clinched in 2004 turned
out to be $153.479 billion and $60.63 billion, 33.38% and 13.32% more than in
2003. Growth of the amount of foreign capital actually used in 2004 was 11.9
percentage points higher than in 2003. Some 508,941 foreign-invested
enterprises had been approved by the end of 2004, with actually used foreign
capital amount involved reaching $562,101 billion.

One way of looking at their business is that they are a mortgage company with
an internet banking presence. With this view, the business and stock just don't
seem to be attractive.

Another view is that they are a bank selling below stated book value. No bank
extant "should" sell that low. B.v. has increased in past years and may
increase in future. I'll bet the stock ~ $8.83 (vs. stated b.v. $8.90) will be

That's something I still find tough to do. I guess that it depends of the

Valuation appeared so low compared to growth, I was a little bit skeptical...
Remember ACLN?

On the other hand, some stocks are very close to what we call "no-brainers". My
best example is a CDN stock: GBT.sv.a (TSX), BMTC Group. The stock was
unbelievably cheap when I first bought in 1999 and it was going down

Re: CVS, TGT, CSCO

Suma, why buy CVS now with a forward PE of 17, when all the drugstores have
rallied so strongly over the last two years. It may be an okay price, but why
now?

With regard to Target, why not Walmart? It's cheaper with a much more imposing
moat. You have really good company investing with you. And it's approaching a
two year low instead of a two year high on its stock price. I started a small
position at $52.

I also made a lot of money on Cisco. I sold in 1995 with a severe case of
vertigo about five years early. I looked at it in the recent Barron's article
and feel it should be valued as a growth cyclical so a high teens PE is fair.
The strong competitive position is largely offset by outsized technology risk.
The strong balance sheet is offset by the options. I told my mother I was
starting to look at it and she went out and bought it. It should be alright
because value investors are looking at it.

take a while to see decent gains. JMO, I've been wrong on CVS several times.

Also holding RAD, for reasons mentioned by -with a K. My last batch purchased

Update on Valero, State Street, Principal Financial. My first post (see
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=16943186
) on Valero was in 1/2002 when I bought at $20 split-adjusted. Later I bought
at $13 and I have been averaging up since then. I'm thinking about adding again
but I'm conflicted because of the rate of stock price appreciation. Like the
CEO (see the marketwatch story available in February in yahoo news), I still
don't get the valuation.

In December, in disbelief at the disparity between the forward and current
prices of oil, and not being willing to add to Valero, I added some mid-cap E&P
companies (Devon, Pioneer, XTO, Burlington) based on the Barron's story saying
the companies were being valued at an oil price in the mid teens.

I continue to add to State Street. It's a small loser for me. I trust this is
patience and not stubbornness.

I added to Principal Financial at $39.50 this month. My take is that there a
retirement business is undervalued based on the company's price-to-book.
There's upside potential in improving the ROE. I haven't done a lot of research
on this one and only have a small position (unfortunately).

I started Budweiser on a sleepy GAARP basis at $47.50.

I flipped the Bennett Environmental for a 25% one month gain in November. Now,
I'm back in at $3.08 in March. I still think the multi-bagger opportunity
offset the bankruptcy risk. Obviously, this is speculative, but they have very
difficult to replace assets (like Valero) and significant earnings potential.

I averaged up on McGraw Hill on 2/28. It's done really well for me and is an
okay GAARP stock I believe.

I sold my losing lots in EBAY after the disastrous quarterly report at $43.25,
keeping my gaining lots. The cockroaches may really come out next quarter, but
I hope to begin adding in the low 30s.

For an undervalue play with a company that has a lot of potential, I am buying
ABS (Albertsons). They own the Sav-On and Osco Drug stores. They recently
announced that their Shaw's division will implement the "Store w/in a Store"
and build more Osco Drug stores in their Shaw's stores. The company is in a
four year restructuring with a lot of potential but have had their problems
(mainly with labor contracts which now have been resolved).

They pay a good dividend while you wait for them to get their stores
profitable. They have a franchise in their drug stores which I believe they
have not really structured to complement their grocery operation.

If you are looking for a value play with low risk, this is the company you want
to speculate on. It may be another 24 months before earnings begin to grow. A
lot depends how management differentiate their businesses with high end stores
Vs specialty stores.

Management has a long term plan and have been quite successful in negotiating
new labor contracts. It's not a slam dunk as Costco, Target and Walmart provide
similar cost effective services.

ABS has a better Internet presence and if integrated with their local
facilities (especially their pharmacy division), I think they can be very
competitive. I like their plan to expand into the sunbelt states (Phoenix,
Nevada etc.) where many of the baby boomers plan to retire and will need their
drugs.

I have been wrong many times but have established a large position in this
company at prices below $20. My target (if management can fully implement their
changes) is $40/share in 36 to 48 months.

Brendan Watt, my comments on your updates:

VLO. Followed you in with a tiny exploratory position 9/'02. Added a bit 6/'03.
At some point with some exploratory positions (or stock buys in general), it's
my opinion that one has to determine if one will average up if the stock should
move up, or average down if the stock drops after being bought. The other most
likely decision is to give up and exit the position.
Like you, I decided to average up with VLO. Unlike you, I'd say I began later -
about 3/04. My adds have been very small. I note though that I made 16
purchases in 2004 and 11 in 2005. My last two purchases were 2/25 @ $69.91 and
2/28 @ $74.40. (I've made no sales.) And agree w/what you say: the rate of
stock price appreciation causes consternation when one considers adding at this
point.

As with refiners, I am also diversified among E&P companies. Among the stocks
that you've mentioned, I have been averaging up on DVN (last purchases 2/25
@$47.84 and 3/9 @$49.36) and recently added to PXD. Somewhat late to the party
perhaps, I nevertheless have started a very small amount of XTO recently. I
don't follow Burlington.

I bought State Street after you discussed it here. I still have my few shares.

I've scanned PFG now after your mention below, but the stock looks too
expensive for me. Market cap to assets-under-management is a key criterion that
I use, and that fraction is too large for PFG for me to be interested further.
(Aside: that's just me and scanning. PFG has other businesses than money
management apparently, but I can't easily see a bargain here.)

I've been averaging down on BUD under $50. Had Heineken recently, but decided I
like BUD better (business prospects and price -- not the beers themselves), so
I closed my HINKY.pk position.

I don't know the Bennett story well to say this is the story, but I can offer
bullet points. I've spent less than 8 hours following it over the last few
months and I have no particular expertise. I have a trace position in the stock
now.

o there is a new management and sales team this year. i've heard the management
on two of the conference calls and haven't cringed particularly. There's a lot
of unhappiness with management, assertions of lies, etc... but I don't have a
feel either way. They did lose somebody recently that didn't sound like a
welcome loss.

o they have one plant that needs to be approved and commissioned where most of
the expense has already been incurred. of course, there's a lot of opposition,
but they've gotten this far, and commissioning seems possible or likely perhaps
in 2006.

o they have another plant i think in quebec where the government there has said
they are violating emissions standards. the company disputes the government
claims with experts, but is talking to the government about an "action plan"
and management tone about this was encouraging FWIW. it seems possible the
government could make compliance not economically feasible and doom the plant.
If this were to happen, you wonder if other plants would be in jeopardy. this
is the big risk.

o they issued shares in December at $4 to raise working capital as they work
their turnaround, so the balance sheet looks pretty good right now. The plants
apparently can be mothballed for less than $1 million per year.

o there seems to be LOTS of work that they are bidding on.

o the way management talks their position relative to competitors is good, with
the exception that transportation costs for (U.S.) business that originates at
a distance from their plants is meaningful.

That's what comes to mind.

If anything, I found the www.stopbennett.com website encouraging for the lack

How to treat the soils is a science question and a judgment as to relative
costs of different methods. Contaminated soils still need to be treated and
somebody is going to be unhappy about how its done. Canadian provinces have

re TCOWs: a fellow investor inadvertently pointed out...

to me that Mark Cuban also likes the stock:

PSCO: still waiting. i have been bidding shares and got fills at 3 cents and
.031 - .035. lately there has been another bidder a little higher but it looks
like the seller is either done or just wants to see the bid up a little higher
before they hit it. this one is VERY HIGH RISK but i am comfortable owning it
at these levels and look forward to following thier Qs.

FWIW - i bought most of my shares in the 7 to 8 cent range. since i felt
comfortable with it at that price there is no reason for me to be uncomfortable
now - or sell. that is a Buffet truism : NEVER BUY A STOCK THAT YOU WOULD NOT
BE HAPPY TO OWN AT HALF ITS PRICE.

obviously i wont be happy if it looks the company is going nowhere...but if i
see their business plan taking shape i will be pleased. ultimately i am waiting
for the EUPHORIA OF BEING CORRECT!

I can proudly speak about my track record for picking stocks - except for ESREF
- which could still come back - i'm batting a 100% - of course - I'm not a day
trader & can't predict tommorrow's stock movement - so here goes 4 of my
favorite undervalued stocks - all regional bank thrifts - all in NJ - all
recently demutualized:

&#183; #1 - CSBK - Clfiton Savings Bank - closed at $11.65 - net inc for latest
quarter was $.10 diluted; about $.40/eps annualized - but earnings keep growing
as ipo proceeds deployed - sitting on several branch offices acquired decades
ago & now worth $millions more than reflected on balance sheet - Equity $202.9
mill/14 mill shs = $14.49 book value - but real book value much higher - pays a
$.20/annual dividend or almost 2% - just announced a 5% share buyback

&#183; #2 - KRNY - Kearny Bank - closed at $11.63 - book value is $23.16 - just
de-mutualized so real earnings and dividends not exactly clear but both should
be good when they do come out

&#183; #3 - ABBC - Abbington Community Bank - closed at $13.47 - on track to do
about $.79/eps for year but should be higher as ipo proceeds deployed - $17.34
in book value - actually - this bank is in Bucks County, PA - which borders NJ

&#183; #4 - OSHC - Ocean Shore Bank - closed at $10.91 - also too new to
determine earnings - but book value is $15.97

Blankmind: Well, here we go again as to what is the correct book value number
for these banks. I'll continue to hold CSBK, might add to the others since
there was lots of insider buying when the banks were demutualized, and for a
couple of those banks, the stock price currently doesn't seem that far away
from those insider open market buys.

As regards, "I'm batting a 100%" - I'd have to see your entry and maybe exit
points for your pick of HCAR.

Paul,

- amongst bank investors - there's not much of a debate over how many shares
are really outstanding

- from the last release:

CLIFTON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 10, 2005--Clifton Savings Bancorp, Inc.
(Nasdaq: CSBK - News) today announced that the Company's board of directors has
approved the repurchase of up to 686,936 shares, or 5% of the Company's
outstanding common stock held by persons other than Clifton MHC.

- the MHC shares just aren't a factor

- anyway - I hope all CSBK investors have the patience to wait this one out

Book values,

Paul alluded to a prior conversation about book values. I'm sorry I missed
that, because all the bank book value numbers you quote look inflated to me,
even if you factor in the IPO money.

Could you explain how you get your numbers ot refer me to a prior post?

Thanks

My part of that past conversation is around here:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=20898825&srchtxt=csbk

A key element for me for a buy among these demutualized banks is that the
insiders have made purchases near the current stock price. (Well, near enough
for me to be interested)

paul,

- thanks for the vote of confidence - on krny - i've never seen a bank stock
open up with such a gap between book value & share price - I've followed
synergy bank (synf) & roebling (rblg.ob) & others - all seem to take time for
stock prices to reach & surpass book value - so good luck to the both of us on
being patient & seeing this materialize

re NYT and other newspaper stocks (NYT,GCI,KRI,TRB)
NYT seems to be the dog of the group. Trading at the lowest EV/Sales and
justifiable so, since PE, Growth and FCF yield are the worst in that group.
Forecasts are not much better, if i believe the analysts per yahoo. Overall,
NYT seems to be a reversal of the mean play, even withing the newspaper group
which is in itself a reversal to the man play. I'd say based on the
fundamentals, i like TRB as a national and GCI as a regional newspaper play
more. Both are more expensive on a EV/sales but cheaper on a FCF and PE basis.
Overall, i prefer media plays like the broadcasters (VIA.b, TVL) more than the
newspapers, since they have similar FCF yields and cash flow multiples but
better growth prospects, IMO.

GTI: Looks like it's not going to be such a good year for GrafTech and its
stockholders. "Company forecasts 2005 earnings of...50 cents to 60 cents, on
sales growth of 10%. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 83 cents...on
sales growth of 11.5%." Stock is down quite sharply today.

I've been sinking with this one since my initial purchase in Jan '00 and my
subsequent adds at lower and lower prices.

I had hoped that this year, with the world-wide boom in steel prices, that GTI
(supplier of consumable graphite rods to the industry) would see its stock also
participate in the steel stocks' upsurge.

Ah well, maybe in the next 12-18 months the outlook for GTI might improve and
its stock rally above $10/sh., where it has often before traded.

I added yet more today to my position.

re AVZ, AMAT, FII -
Sold 1/2 of my AVZ with has reached fair value and diversified into FII in the
fund management space. I like the business and the free cash flow
characteristics of this business. Bought back s starter position in AMAT and
might add more on weakness. I am betting that semiconductor capex may recover
after the recent speedbump and bellweather AMAT might profit. Valuation is
reasonable within a historical perspective although i do not like their stock
option grants.

BusinessWeek is out with their list of Best Fund Managers 2005.

I'll comment on some of the stocks these folks mentioned in BusinessWeek that
were mentioned here too and that I might own or be interested in investigating:

Brian Rogers (PRFDX): Likes dividends and likes to hold at least three years.
Bought KO last year when it was at or under $40. "Recently" bought BUD. "Growth
stocks are cheap by historical standards," he is quoted as saying. He likes
TWX, VIA, WYE. I don't have Wyeth any longer. I'm still holding Time Warner
from when it was discussed here (2002)... but getting mighty tired of this
going-nowhere stock. Holding on to my small VIA position also.

Thyra Zerhusen (CHTTX): In the past few years whenever I've seen her
interviewed on TV or in Barron's, she has always recommended UIS - as she now
again says she favors. She is one tough convinced lady given that UIS has
continued to disappoint and it's still a very top holding in her fund.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=UIS&t=5y

I have kept passing UIS, but maybe it's time again for a re-look. (I ignored my
buddy's recommendation in 1990-91 when company was in real trouble and he was
buying in $2 range. Kinda colored my outlook on this company --- always
suspicious whenever I re-visit the stock that the business could turn down
similarly and the stock see $2 again.)

Additionally, fwiw, I notice that among the stocks in her fund, she has (as of
3 months ago) several stocks I also have. I'm considering adding to ANDW; I've
sold most Mattel; I've sold half my exploratory position in Scholastic; I still
have an exploratory position in PerkinElmer which I may soon sell. I never had
Bunge (performed well for those who bought when it was mentioned here, if I
recall right).

Robert Smith (TRSAX): "A lot of really smart people work hard in this business
and don't do well because they're afraid of taking any risks," he says. "They
don't want to own troubled companies because they're afraid of looking
foolish".
Ah that old pride/shame ratio factor. -g-
"Smith believes many blue chips are relatively cheap." WMT, GE, and MSFT
mentioned. I notice that ACS was or is in his fund too; that's a stock
discussed here last year. It's only a few points off its low now and with a
relatively okay psr. I'll look at ACS again.

Bargains - anybody interested in bargain hunting may look at DRL (Puerto Rican
bank) or my auction house GMAI. (I own a position in GMAI, now under water)

I'll pass on DRL because I don't see how ROA - a measure I use to evaluate
banks - can be so very high- over 2.5% the last few years. That is an
exceptionally good number and needs to be understood (imo). There are some
Yahoo news items which I interpret as suggesting DRL could be excessively or
incorrectly using carry trade (derivatives). Not that I can relate these items
to one another, but it's enough to make me pause further in looking at the
stock as a potential buy.

OTOH, one can't go by my opinion here. I passed on DRL when it was $7 (maybe
$2-3 now after splits) and discussed here a couple of times about five years
ago. Has turned out to be a 20-30 bag winner (not even including dividends).
One of the best overall bank performing stocks I can recall.

BIIB - SOLD 'You gotta know when to fold'em' Avonex is 2/3's of Biogen's
current revenue. News just hit that it would get likely get a big ugly black
box warning for liver damage. I was expecting Avonex to be helped somewhat...or
at least be stable in the wake of the Tysabri disaster. I don't know what the
fallout from this will be, but this is too much at risk to wait and find out.
Amazing. This drug was on the market for 8 years with no negatives other than
in combination with Tysabri...then suddenly the trap door opens and down it
goes.
I feel sorry for MS patients who will be left in a lurch by this.

BIIB My sale probably more reflects the perils of reacting to news than of
Avonex - it appears the label change warning of liver damage is far more
ordinary than the initial news reports portrayed it. BIIB handled this very
poorly. They should have issued a press release putting it in perspective, but
they didn't till after the stock got clobbered. Combined with the insider
selling and uncertain future, I'll likely stay on sidelines on this one.
