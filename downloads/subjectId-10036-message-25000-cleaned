Looked at the 10-Q and 10-K for MHJ..... saw what you did, but really can't
decipher the the reason for the asset split listed on the balance sheet. Can't
tell whether it is the JV they are doing, or a wholey owned sub that is being
mis-reported or what. It doesn't jive with what was said (or at least what I
heard) on the conference call. I just can't muster the required intensity to
figure it out further at this point.

What I found that I definitely do not like is how free they are with stock
options....48 million new options issued in the last year.

Therefore, since stock options abuse (or what I perceive as abuse) is a big
deal with me, I have reduced my holdings by 75%. The remaining shares I have
(due to good fortune between the purchase date and now) at an average cost of
about $1.10. I'll hold these just to see what happens.

I seem to find this freeness with stock with some of the Asian companies that
have looked interesting over time. I remember a few years ago thinking very
similar things about PCCW when I bought it and held for a short time.

Don't know whether I just got lucky on this one (which is what I suspect
happened) or what. But it was an interesting experience nonetheless.

Thanks for bringing it to my attention and for being persistent in your
questions!

Easy, I did my homework on it and liked what I saw.

Levered Free Cash Flow (ttm): -1.30M 

Do you know how to calculate free cash flow for yourself? If you do, then I
suggest you do so. If you don't, then I can see why you think it negative.

If a company pays a dividend is that an optional use of cash or is it just a
negative? If a company pays down 1/3 of their outstanding debt is that an
optional use of free cash or just a negative?

Come on pcyhuang, you can do a lot better at criticising a pick than this cheap

It appears I attributed the DELL discussion's genesis as your recommendation
and, in review of the posts, I discovered that I was in error for that. It was
another poster who favored DELL. So my apologies for that incorrect
attribution.

 Or are you just simply blashing away without substance??
However, with you starting your post to me with:

and with only providing one negative, that of Yahoo's negative leveraged cash

Paul -

TX has been rather disappointing but if you are a value investor, you need to
be patient. Their current market cap does neither reflect their current
earnings nor their future capacity to increase them once they finish
integrating all 3 plants and the capital investments they are making on them
start paying off. Short of a world recession strongly affecting latin america
(which I don't see in the horizon), I am buyer of TX on dips and long term
holder. We shall see.

NTO has lots of value in the ground, not in the most stable place in the world,
but if you believe in the long-term commodity bull, stocks like NTO are the
10-bagger candidates. I hold a sizable (for me) position and added recently on
this last dip. I think the stock has been hit for the delays on their Business
Feasibility Study, but these things take time and better get them right the
first time. I agree with Cricket that NTO will be a takeover candidate from
their partners at La Lumbrera once this BFS is out. Hope not.

I still like TS too but the easy money on that one is done (~10-bagger in last
3 years). I still see some 50% appreciation from current levels in the next
year or so if the MVK acquisition works out well (it should, management are
masters at executing) and there is no worldwide slowdown in drilling because
oil crashes back to $35-40. TS touched $48 back in April and now is $35
(substantial correction). I see downside risk to $31. My target is mid to upper
40s in the next 6-12 months.

Terrific record, Brinks. You seem to have got people galvanized now to your
oil/gas picks.

As you indicate, starting off slowly with not much (apparently none) interest
in your AEZ and SCU, building a little with some conversation here after TPE,
culminating with almost instantaneous discussion throughout SI (and other sites
I presume), after your comments on Delta Pete. People seeing what you saw and
buying the stock has made DPTR a short-term winner for many.

I and others will surely be looking forward to your next write-up with much
anticipation!

----------
Fwiw. AEZ. Great call on your part imo. Sorry I couldn't see it.
I've still got just a few shares of SCE, bought after you mentioned it. Not
sure where I am with this one: my brokerage firm says remaining shares were
bought 1/'05 at $2.14, so I have a loss (stock being at $1.62 now). I've no
record of a stock split, but if I remember right, there indeed was one, so
maybe it got lost in one of my sales, and I'm better off than the record shows.
Teton Pete. (TPE, now TEC) was first mentioned here as a net-net in late 2004.
It garnered no attention. I was a buyer then (and after your post), and still
have all my shares. (The stock was also mentioned at that time on SI oil/gas
stocks, but not as a net-net, I am guessing). Value thread interest was sparked
in early 2005 by your positive mention of the company and your detailing of
some of the positives for the company.
About Delta, I suspect many of us would not be in it except for your excellent
write-up and links to information about it.

TimbaBear,

Thanks for the taking a look and nice timing on your purchases and sales of
MHJ.

I hadn't noticed the huge number of options granted, although they are in Hong
Kong subsidiary which trades at a much lower price (I estimate around 0.25 HK
dollar = 3-4 cents US).

With its complicated structure, this company has always had something not quite
right about it, which is why I haven't backed up the truck to buy despite an
attractive value. On the other hand, I've made money on it before and hope to
do so again. And at least they care enough to communicate to investors, even if
I don't always like what they are communicating.

Reasosns for Disqualifying TSC

"Took a small position to day in TSC"

How can you buy this dog?

Market Cap (intraday): 13.83M
Trailing P/E (ttm, intraday): 108.62
Qtrly Revenue Growth (yoy): 6.00%
Diluted EPS (ttm): 0.029
Levered Free Cash Flow (ttm): -1.30M
52-Week High (24-Oct-05): 4.15
52-Week Low (01-Aug-06): 2.83

Source: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=TSC

---

Since you have asked my reasons for qulifying TSC as a dog, here is my take:

A company with total market capitalization of only 14 million, and ttm P/E of
108.62, Qtrly Rev. Growth of only 6.0%, and narrow 52wk range of 4.15 and 2.83
are sufficient but not necessary reasons for qualifying it as a dog. Moreover,
the avg. 3-month daily traded volume is only 2,000 shares.

I think the only exception would be that if the company is an early-stage
venture capital type company with an imminent explosive discovery or
development in the high-tech or bio-tech arena.

Here again, you have taken words of my posting out of context, and referring
the ONLY reason for my argument is the negative cash-flow figure.

I hope that this will end our discussion on this matter.

Double Eagle Petroleum ---Oil & Gas Orphan That Gets No Respect

“We believe that Double Eagle is currently at the starting point of a
multi-year growth phase, with 2009 production expected to be nearly 10 times
fiscal ‘05 levels. This growth will come entirely through an existing pipeline
of drilling opportunities. Success on the company’s high-risk deep exploratory
tests this year would offer additional upside.” Zacks September 2006

Double Eagle Petroleum Co. (NASDAQ (Small Cap Market) Symbol DBLE), an
independent oil and natural gas company, engages in the exploration,
exploitation, development, and production of natural gas and crude oil
primarily in the Rocky Mountain basins of the western United States.

DBLE explores and develops the Green River basin in southwestern Wyoming; the
Wind River basin in central Wyoming; and Christmas Meadows area in northeastern
Utah. As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s estimated proved reserves were
49.2 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent. As of December 31, 2005, the Company
owned interests in a total of 626 producing wells.

The Company has an interest in 504,899 gross acres (217,410 net), of which
413,153 gross acres (212,630 net) are undeveloped. Double Eagle Petroleum was
founded in 1972 and is headquartered in Casper, Wyoming. There are only
8,628,604 shares outstanding. The 55 year old CEO is the only 5% shareholder in
the Company.

INVESTMENT THESIS:

A) Bargain Purchase:

DBLE Market Price per share $ 21.34
PV-10 Proven and Probable Reserve per share ($21.59)

PV-10 of Possible Reserves from CBM property per share ($42.20)

Christmas Meadows—The DBLE Lottery Ticket ( $ 0 )

Other undeveloped not included in Possible ($ 0 )

The market price of DBLE shares is less than the proven and probable reserves
of the company at December 31, 2005.

DBLE’s Market Cap is $ 184.4 million. PV-10 Value of Proven and Probable
Reserves is $186.3 million at December 31, 2005.
Another way to summarize:

DBLE’s stock is selling at no more than reserve value of proven (49.2 billion
cubic feet of gas equivalent) and probable reserves (29.7 billion cubic feet of
gas equivalent), and that’s using just $2.56 for proven gas equivalent reserves
and $2.01 for probable gas equivalent reserves.

Here’s what you are getting free:

One) 153,899,862 mcf or 153.9 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent in possible
reserves valued at PV-10 of $ 364,093,900, which are ALL Coalbed Methane
““CBM”) locations on the Atlantic Rim (35% of proven reserves come from the
Atlantic Rim and 39% of probable reserves come from Atlantic Rim !!!!!) waiting
to get drilled after EIS approval early 2007. Note: These are CBM properties
with substantially less risk and much higher probability of success. The $
364.0 million is TWICE the current market cap of DBLE !! TWICE.

Two) A free lottery ticket for the highly prospective Christmas Meadows (Uinta
Mountains of northeast Utah) prospect for free. The 15,750 foot well spud
September 9, 2006 and is expected to take 100 days to drill. The Christmas
Meadows prospect could be anywhere between 1-3 trillion cubic feet (“TCF”) of
natural gas (possibly some oil?). Each TCF is worth approximately $ 1 Billion
of market cap and DBLE has an interest of approximately 30%. DBLE has a tiny
market cap of $ 184.4 million. The Christmas Meadows property is began drilling
September 9, 2006. A field trip was held last week. See summary below. This
wildcat well may be one of the largest potential targets in the lower 48
drilled in 2006. This well took over 10 years for permitting…… DBLE has owned
since 1984!

B) CEO Possible Exit Strategy:

The CEO President and Chairman, Stephen H. Hollis, who is 55, is the largest
DBLE shareholder with 720,200 shares or 8.3% of the outstanding shares. IMHO
Mr. Hollis who is very conservative and one of the best geologists in the
country is building DBLE to sell to a major. He has never been thrilled being a
public company and has believed that the stock is very undervalued. Part of
this is his own fault in that the Company does no promotion in the past and
even has an outdated website. Mr. Hollis is as tight with the dollar as they
come. They wonder why they have gotten little attention for their outstanding
performance. He makes a very modest salary at DBLE.

C) Recent changes to enhance DBLE value:

One) Within the last month the Company for the first time in its corporate
history hired a person to handle investor relations. He has much experience and
in fact, John was my source for my stock selection of American Gas & Oil which
I acquired at average of $ 72 share in 2004
(http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=AEZ&t=5y ).

John has followed DBLE for many many years.

John Campbell Investor Relations Double Eagle Petroleum Tel 303-794-8445 email
jcampbell@eagle-eagle.net

Two) In June 2006 DBLE hired a new CFO who was with Western Gas Reserves which
went from $ 40 million to $ 1 billion of market cap while he was an officer.
The new CFO has recently acquired 5,500 DBLE shares paying as high as $ 20.25
share: http://biz.yahoo.com/t/25/7145.html

Three) Effective August 1, 2006, DBLE entered into a new $50 million revolving
line of credit collateralized by oil and gas producing properties, replacing
the existing revolving line of credit. The new line of credit bears interest at
the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal, less 1.125%, with an
initial borrowing base of $25 million and all outstanding balances on the line
of credit mature on July 31, 2010.

Four) During 2005, DBLE invested $12.4 million in capital expenditures related
to exploration and development, $5.4 million in pipeline construction, and
$0.46 million on acquiring new leases. For 2006, has budgeted approximately
$24.0 million for ongoing development and exploration programs. Thus DBLE is
doubling their exploration and development expenditures.

Five) 7) Zacks Equity Research Analyst Initiating DBLE as a Buy

”We are initiating coverage on Double Eagle Petroleum (DBLE) with a Buy
recommendation and a 12-month price target of $28. The company’s
Rockies-focused natural gas-heavy asset base offers a balanced mix of low-risk
development drilling opportunities and high-risk/high-reward exploration
prospects.

We believe that Double Eagle is currently at the starting point of a multi-year
growth phase, with 2009 production expected to be nearly 10 times fiscal ‘05
levels. This growth will come entirely through an existing pipeline of drilling
opportunities. Success on the company’s high-risk deep exploratory tests this
year would offer additional upside.” END

Why would the CEO be frustrated with DBLE’s rather flat two year stock
performance ??? —I have owned for entire time! :

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=DBLE&t=2y

Because:

1) Revenue and cash flow have more than tripled since 2003.

2) One year 2004 Versus 2005 Sales up 56.4% Cash Flow up 14.0% Book Value up
18% Proved Reserves up 34% PV-10 up 85%
2005 512% Production Replacement !

4-Year Weighted Average Production Replacement 503%

3) Five years % change per year Sales up 41.5% Cash Flow up 54.5% Book Value up
27%

4) The Company believes its Eastern Washakle Coal Bed and South Fillmore
natural gas projects hold considerable development drilling potential in coming
years.

5) DBLE finding costs have gone from $ 1.15 per MCFE in 2002 to $ .66 per MCFE
in 2005

6) Drilling Performance. From January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2005, DBLE
participated in the drilling of 252 gross wells comprised of 66 exploratory
wells with one dry hole, 176 development wells with no dry holes, 9 water
injection wells and one monitoring well. Of the 66 exploratory tests drilled
during the three year period, 61 of the test wells were coal bed wells that
were drilled in pod groups of 24 wells, 24 wells and 13 wells, respectively.
During the same period, DBLE added estimated proved reserves of 38.3 Bcfe at an
average finding costs of $0.70 per Mcfe. DBLE’s average annual production
replacement was 543 % during this three-year period, and our production has
grown from an average daily rate of 3.9 MMcfe per day in 2003 to 8.4 MMcfe per
day in 2005. Production in December 2005 averaged 7.2 MMcfe per day.

7) In 2005, added 15.7 Bcfe of proved reserves and produced 3.1 Bcfe. DBLE’s
year-end proved reserves increased 34% to 49.2 Bcfe at December 31, 2005 from
36.6 Bcfe at December 31, 2004.

8) DBLE replaced over 500% of our production in 2005 at a finding and
development cost of $0.66 per Mcfe without acquiring existing reserves from
third parties.

9) Oil and gas sales increased 56.4% to $20.5 million in 2005 from $13.1
million in 2004. Higher prices accounted for 63% of the increase, and higher
production volumes accounted for the remaining 37% increase.

10) Production increased 15% to 3.1 Bcfe in 2005 from 2.7 Bcfe in 2004. The
increase is primarily attributable to increases in the coal bed natural gas
production at the Cow Creek field and production increases from the Mesa field
on the Pinedale Anticline.

11) Income from operations increased 33% to $6.0 million in 2005 from $4.5
million in 2004. However, the additional $1.6 million of deferred income taxes
recognized in 2005 resulted in a 1.6% decrease in net income.

12) Net cash provided by operating activities increased 39%, to $10.3 million
in 2005 from $7.4 million in 2004.

The Lottery Ticket Christmas Meadows

Christmas Meadows is a structural dome in the southwest corner of the prolific
Green River Basin, in Summit County, Utah. The dome is overlain by the Wyoming
Overthrust Belt and the North Flank Thrust of the Uinta Mountains. In 2005,
after nearly ten years of addressing various regulatory hurdles in this
environmentally sensitive area, DBLE and their partner, John Lockridge, began
preparing this prospect for drilling. Dirt work was completed and 34 inch
conductor pipe was set at a depth of 235 feet. Unit Drilling Company Rig #233
has been signed up to move in to drill this 16,000 foot test on June 1, 2006.
Partners have been signed up, leaving DBLE with just under 25% working interest
before payout and over 30% working interest after payout.

The Christmas Meadows Prospect has a long history. In the 1970s Gulf noted the
structure on a regional seismic grid. Further seismic surveys by Gulf, American
Quasar, Amoco, Chevron, Sohio, and others support the existence of the
structural dome. Amoco staked a location to test the structure to 19,000 feet
in 1982, but had still not been issued a permit in 1986 when it abandoned its
efforts. DBLE acquired their first leasehold in the prospect in 1984 (1984
!!!!) . Chevron formed a federal unit in 1989 and staked a well but abandoned
its efforts in 1994 after not getting a permit or offset acreage offered for
sale. Chevron turned the project over to Amerac, who designated DBLE as its
agent. DBLE purchased the Chevron leasehold and have farmouts from Amerac (now
Unit Corp.) and Judy Yates, and finally acquired the open offset acreage at a
BLM auction in November 2003. Combined with new leases purchased at lease
sales, DBLE and Lockridge have interests in 41,237 gross acres, of which 22,875
gross acres are included in the Table Top Federal Exploratory Unit.

Prospective formations range from depths of 4,000 to 23,000 feet, and range in
age from Mississippian to Cretaceous. Source rocks, reservoir rocks, structural
timing, seal, as well as structure all remain to be determined through the
drill bit, but we are encouraged by our analysis of analogous fields in the
Wyoming Overthrust Belt and the Green River Basin. The initial well is
projected to a depth of 16,000 feet, and DBLE believes it has a high risk, high
reward potential. There is also engineering risk to consider, as there is a
time deadline once operations commence and the overlying structure is complex
and potentially difficult to drill.

DBLE has acquired licenses to six 2D seismic lines, or 60 miles. Five of the
lines, or 53 miles, were reprocessed with state-of-the-art pre-stack depth
migration. Imaging and understanding of the structure has improved as a result,
although the structure map appears very similar to Chevron’s and American
Quasar’s efforts.

Oil & Gas Journal, October 2, 2006
Utah’s 30-year prospect
Alan Petzet

After Covenant field in Sevier County, Utah, which opened oil production on the
Central Utah thrust belt, where will explorers discover the next potentially
giant oil or gas field in the US Lower 48?

Perhaps it will be up the road in Summit County, Utah.
A group led by Double Eagle Petroleum Co., Casper, Wyo., spudded a wildcat at
Christmas Meadows, Utah, in late September.

The well is expected to cost $10 million and take 100 days to drill to TD
15,730 ft. Double Eagle cemented 34-in. conductor pipe at 235 ft and 20-in.
conductor at almost 1,000 ft before Unit Drilling Co. moved in Rig No. 233 to
drill the vertical Table Top Unit No. 1. The drillsite’s surface elevation is
9,573 ft.

Outlays prior to spud totaled $2.5 million for environmental permitting and
building the road and location.

The large subsurface feature, a structural dome, appears on numerous 2D seismic
lines, but no 3D data have gone into the drilling of this prospect. Overlying
the dome, in the southwest corner of the Green River basin, is the Rocky
Mountain Overthrust Belt.

Various operators have been attempting to drill this well since the 1970s.

Progressive suitors

The former Gulf Oil Corp. noted the Christmas Meadows prospect on a regional
seismic grid in the 1970s.

Later 2D seismic surveys by Gulf, American Quasar Petroleum Co., Amoco
Production Co., Chevron Corp., Sohio Petroleum Co., and others supported the
dome’s existence.

Amoco staked a location in 1982 to drill a wildcat to 19,000 ft on the
structure but had still not been issued a permit in 1986, when it dropped its
plans.

Double Eagle first acquired leases on the prospect in 1984. Then Chevron formed
a federal unit in 1989 and staked a well but withdrew in 1994, having been
unable to get a drilling permit or buy offset acreage offered for sale.

Chevron turned the project over to Amerac Energy Corp., which designated Double
Eagle as its agent. Double Eagle acquired the last acreage critical to the
prospect at a US Bureau of Land Management auction in November 2003.

Double Eagle holds interests in 42,095 gross acres, of which 22,875 gross acres
are included in the Table Top Federal Exploratory Unit.

Seismic search

Double Eagle and partners have acquired licenses to six 2D seismic lines that
span 60 miles.

The various exploration organizations reprocessed five lines covering 53 miles
with the state-of-the-art prestack depth migration (PSDM) technique.

Imaging and understanding of the structure improved as a result, although the
structure map appears similar on all four of the PSDM maps generated, said
Stephen H. Hollis, Double Eagle president and chief executive officer.

Hollis said, “It’s a tough seismic area with lots of velocity problems to deal
with. The geophysicists would prefer to have 3D seismic, but shooting 3D in a
national forest in rough terrain was just prohibitive.”

Not until it reaches 11,000 ft is the well expected to drill out of the last
thrust sheet and into the underlying Green River basin, Hollis said.

The Christmas Meadows structure’s position underneath the thrust is similar to
that of Utah’s Bridger Lake oil and gas field, which doesn’t produce from
beneath the thrust, and the size of the seismic feature is similar to Wyoming’s
Anschutz Ranch East gas-condensate field, he noted.

The prospect

The Christmas Meadows structure appears to have prospective formations that
range in depth from 4,000 ft to 23,000 ft and in age from Mississippian to
Cretaceous.

Obviously a 15,730-ft well will not see the three deepest formations: Jurassic
Nugget estimated to be at 17,100 ft, Pennsylvanian Weber at 20,930 ft, and
Mississippian Madison at 22,500 ft.

This makes the present wellbore mainly a test of the Cretaceous Dakota and
Frontier, Double Eagle said.

The well has about a dozen working interest owners. Double Eagle and one other
entity hold 25% each, Unit Corp. has 5%, and Basic Earth Science Systems Inc.,
Denver, has 2%. END

By OGJ editors

HOUSTON, July 24 -- Double Eagle Petroleum Co., Casper, Wyo., expects a rig on
location in late August to drill a 16,000-ft exploratory well in Summit County.

The well is in the southwestern Green River basin on the Christmas Meadows
prospect, identified in the 1970s and since then the subject of much study and
environmental permitting. The target is a structural dome overlain by the Rocky
Mountain Overthrust Belt. Contractor is Unit Drilling Co.

Double Eagle and John P. Lockridge, private Denver independent, hold interests
in more than 41,000 gross acres, of which 22,875 gross acres are included in
the Table Top Federal Exploratory Unit. Working interest is just under 25%
before payout and more than 30% after payout.

I have followed DBLE for about a year but have no position - the reason being
that the company has not executed all that well.

According to DBLE's latest presentation (and 10K), DBLE's PV10 pretax value is
126M$ (or 95M$ after subtracting 40% tax) After adding probable reserves of
59.97M$ (35M$ post tax) that's about 161M$. That is less than DBLS's 187M$ EV
value. Those values are based on 12/31/05 gas prices, they would be quite a bit
lower today since NG price trend has been down. To add possible reserves is a
little bit risky. Most E&P have quite large possible reserves but they do not
go into the valuation. Many knowledgeable folks have been saying that the above
number underestimate DBLE's real value since the production profile of DBLE's
CBM properties may lead to much higher overall volumes. That's a potential plus
but hard to quantify. What i found disappointing during the last 12 month is
that DBLE's volume have acutally been falling due to project delays etc. That's
a big minus. With so many cheap gas stocks out there the above can hardly
justify DBLE's stock price, IMO.

The big plus for DBLE is XMAS meadow. This could multiply DBLE's reserves but
it's a wildcat, so risk is high and the cost are potentially high as well.

FWIW 2.5$ for proven reserves is an OK price nowadays, also i suspect that one
can buy long life reserves like DBLE's for about 2$ in the ground. Possible
reserves are valued at no more than 1$ , if that.

Here is DBLE's latest presentation:

Hi Thanksalot - That's interesting. The key is that eventually all of the
operator's expenses are recovered and a "fair" return is provided to the
partnership for their capital invested (*TCLP: ROA 7.16%; ROE 16.23%). Their
gross revenue is calculated based on the quantity of gas delivered, overall
demand (i.e. growth in usage) and the applicable interstate rate fee charged
per unit delivered. I think the long term demand for natural gas will be higher
as it is plentiful (U.S. reserves are large), clean burning and relatively
priced compared to oil.

This company was mentioned on this thread and looks like it might provide good
value.

*TCLP (TC Pipelines LP)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&s=TCLP
TC Pipelines, LP and its subsidiaries engage in the acquisition and management
of pipelines in the United States. It owns a 30% general partner interest in
Northern Border Pipeline Company, which owns 1,249-mile interstate pipeline
system that transports natural gas from the Montana-Saskatchewan border to
markets in the Midwestern. The company also owns 49% general partner interest
in Tuscarora Gas Transmission Company that owns a 240-mile interstate pipeline
system, which transports natural gas from Oregon to northern Nevada. TC
PipeLines GP, Inc. serves as the general partner of the partnership. TC
PipeLines was founded in 1998 and is based in Westborough, Massachusetts.

I am not sure if their dividend is qualified or non-qualified. If it is deemed
qualified then on any pull back this might be a good one to own. They currently
trade with a PE at 12, pay a 7% dividend and generate positive free flow cash
flow. They do carry $18/share in debt but according to the information you
posted, this borrowed money is recoverable through their interstate rate fees.
The company has made over $600 million in longterm investments in June'06 so it
appears that management is making the necessary investments for the future.

Kara Homes a home builder in NJ. declared bankruptcy on October 10, 2006. They
are a small home builder 127th in the industry. Twelve small regional banks had
exposure to Kara's bad loans.

One key with these regional banks is to avoid the potential land mine due to a
large bad loan during the last real estate cycle. Hopefully, these banks have
minimized their portfolio exposure to any one builder's loss by selling some of
their loans. Again, the management is key but hard to quantify.

Amboy Bank About to get Stiffed Again
According to the Asbury Park Press, Amboy Bank is one of Kara's largest
creditors. Amboy recently got stiffed by Solomon Dwek.
(http://shorebubble.blogspot.com/2006/10/amboy-bank-about-to-get-stiffed-again.
tml)

"Amboy National Bank has suffered its second blow this year after a home
building company filed for bankruptcy Thursday.

Amboy holds $58.2 million in loans with Kara Homes Inc., one of the largest
home builders in Monmouth and Ocean counties. According to the bankruptcy
filing, it is the largest creditor to Kara Homes.

A bank analyst said the bankruptcy puts Amboy in a difficult financial
position, and could be a harbinger of things to come for local and regional
banks if the real estate market continues to decline."

http://www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061007/NEWS/61007001

Kara bankruptcy deals another blow to bank owed millions by Dwek

From the article:"...Amboy was not the only bank included in the Kara
bankruptcy filing.

National City Bank of Philadelphia holds $48.2 million on loans to Kara. North
Fork Bank of Edison holds $21.3 million; TD Bank North of Portland, Ore., holds
$15.9 million; Yardville National Bank holds $7.8 million; Magyar Bank of North
Brunswick holds $7.5 million; and Park Avenue Bank of New York holds $3 million
in loans to Kara.

Yardville, Magyar and Park Avenue are also owed money by Dwek. Claims from
those three banks total $37.3 million...."

re FCCY - good comment EKS. FCCY indeed has a substantial amount of commercial

they have done a good job in avoiding landmines.

Amboy National appears to have a bunch of risky loans as evident by the high

I was a little disapointed in MHCOs earnings although I guess I shouldnt have
been. No hurrincances this year versus last and the housing slowdown.

But, I also believe they manage this company for the longterm and that may or
may not mean hurting short term earnings.

I had sold some when it went up last year in the $7-9.50 range and bought back
in August at $5.70 and Sept at $5.25.
(Nice fills)

I compute book value to be $8.59 per diluted share and this will be their 3rd
straight year of profitability and their trailing 12 month EPS=72 cents. (Not
sure how many quarters now)

Been following the company about 7 years now and have made good money doing so.

Low PE, below book, low exposure & pinksheets=opportunity.

In other news, I sold out of my BAMM recently at about $19.53.

Been in that one since $1.56-2.00.

My longtime deregistered EDIN is getting bought out for about $1.90. They went
dark on me 6+ years ago and luckily I added more in the 40-55 cent range. Also
bought some arb shares at $1.80-1.81. (First time I have ever bought a stock
strickly for the arb opportunity)

AWX is another longtime position thats finally acting well.
Around $7.50, my last buy was just over $2.

Sold most of my GIII which is a triple from my last buys less than 2 years ago.

Incurred a total loss apparently on ROW which I was betting might make a 5-6
bagger if they didnt go bankrupt. I was wrong.

Still holding SPOR...not quite sure what to make of it. Zeff took a big
position and since then hasnt done anything.

I havent been finding much worth buying lately.
Maybe I am just more conservative now that I am no spring chicken and dont have
regular income coming in.

I added to FSP a few months back and feel pretty good about it.
Oppenheimer came out with a $24 target, continued insider buying, no mortgage
debt and a 6% yield.

Ive been lurking for sometime. Some might remember me under prior monikers.

Glad that bruin guy was banned. He was ruining the board.

Oh, had a small position in PMTR since about $1.16, they are getting bought out
at $4.63. Stupid me had a limit order in and got taken out at $4.05.

I note that the CEO of STRZ has been a continued buyer. With their consistent
dividends of the past few years, I speculate that he cant find a higher
yielding place to put his money so I added some a while back on a pullback to
$7.51.

Good to be back.

I don't own YHOO but i think you underestimate the percentage of operating
profits that goes into stock option expense. The EBITDA "operating income" you
referencing includes depreciation (which is a very real expense), plus the
substantial interest and investment income. the operating income after stock
option expense is 202M$ before tax and would be about 323 M$ (202M$+121M$)
before stock option expense. By my calculation, stock options expense is about
37% of operating earnings. Interesting is also that YHOO breaks down their
number in international and USA. In the USA YHOO has 132M$ operating earnings
after subtracting 110M$ in stock option expense. International operating
contribute 70M$ in operating earnings but have only 10M$ in stock option
expense.

Hi TimbaBear - I have always considered employee stock options a good thing for
a growing company and a good incentive kicker for management. But when I
noticed in the early 90's that many options that were under water were all of a
sudden repriced (to a lower exercise price) w/o (1) board approval or a rubber
stamp approval or (2) stockholder approval, I began to suspect the whole idea.

The kicker for me was a high Tech company (AFCI) which I had accumulate a large
position in. AFCI performed OK and in fact had one of the biggest spin off
sales to CSCO (a hidden asset and my 'value' ace-in-the-hole) but was the
result of the previous CEO (and company founder) who retired. AFCI hired a new
CEO and part of his compensation package was a company loan to cover the
purchase of his new home here in Silicon Valley. He also received extensive
stock options in excess of 3x his annual salary. In only a year, the
compensation committee for gave his company loan w/o a vote by the board which
was in excess of $1 million.

I was fast to sell my investment on this news (it was reported after the fact
in an SEC form) and always considered indirect compensation (including
repricing of options) as a red flag. I do not have any magic formula to
quantify the exact amounts but it will affect my "buy" decision.

If every type of compensation is disclosed in a timely manner and the board
votes on it, management incentive packages can be a good thing. However, it got
way too excessive in the late 90's and only now is being addressed by the SEC.

It will be interesting to hear what the other thread members say. It's sort of
like the issue w/ pension liabilities. You know that the liability is out there
but generally do not quantify it until it blows up.

yhoo is not a value based on any traditional measure. could it be cheap?
perhaps. but you have to take a gigantic leap of faith that the business
continues to grow rapidly. It is a growth stock trading at a high multiple.
Like the late 90s, the "relative" valuation game is being played here, i.e.
it's cheaper than Google. The "down from" game is also being played. yhoo is
"down from" $X, so its cheap. Both games are dangerous.

tumbled from 50s to a low of 4, after one of their drugs did not receive
approval but before lunesta did.

What was doubly irritating was that they announced the repricing at something
like $6.88 after the stock had recovered into the low teens. Talk about
employee theft! I hope the SEC finds these guys and puts them in jail.

my post 24693 i clearly stated on 8/23/06 that after TB pointed out the option
issue to me i decided to sell my shares.

I added some CPY.V to my position today. I will elaborate on this speculative
issue later but I am convinced that the stock is around 20% less than a
rock-bottom valuation should be. I continiue to hold some shares in IVN. does
anyone else here own?

I also added some PCE.V. yesterday i bought back into OSTK and also took a
decent position in MRCY. both looked good technically as does CNQ.

WEB doesnt give out any options. I think its just another way to sanction
employee theft for the most part. The exception to me would be a start-up where
I think employees should be rewarded for the risk of spending years trying to
get a company of the ground which may well end up in BK.

Thankfully most of my portfolio is green today.

Yes, seems like sanctioned employee theft to me too.

I also agree option grants should exist for entrepreneurial or risk-taking

encouragement for our economy.

The system now in place where every high level exec in every company believes
he/she deserves these things because everybody else gets them, that is if not

By and large my thoughts echo yours.

However, I think we (the country) need to move to define the limits on how much
of the corporate profits can be paid to insiders. After all, these are publicly
traded companies which means that the corporation sold itself on the open
market in order to raise equity to be used (presumably) to expand business.
Prior to going public, whatever the insiders did with the profits was none of
the public's concern. However, post going public, there has to be regulation in
order to protect the shareholders from insider predation.

While I applaud the fact that the SEC has finally moved against some companies,
it is only for the most egregious practices of stock option backdated
repricing. Even there, they have a policy of going easier on companies that are
forthcoming with the facts after the SEC has notified them that they are under
scrutiny. This results in CEOs and CFOs resigning but, otherwise, not really
being penalized. So, if I'm a bright young guy or gal with a nefarious bent or
expensive lifestyle (or both), I'd probably be willing to take the millions and
then resign. Heck, I might not even need to be that nefariously oriented to do
so!

It's true that action could be taken to recover the money, but who would
initiate that action and pay for it? It is less likely to be done by remaining
company management who were probably hired by the people who resigned. The
Board of Directors? Not likely in most cases, as they have been complicit in
the pilferage in the first place.

Without defining some boundaries and providing for stiff sentencing for
violating the public's trust, and providing an ongoing budget for those charged
with oversight and enforcement, there is no incentive for it to stop.

As value investors, we must not only analyze the business performance, model,
and factors of competition. We presumably engage in this endeavor in order to
selectively invest in companies whose profitability and price to that
profitability is attractive. We do so out of the belief that attractively
priced profitability will accrue value to our ownership interest and that Mr.
Market will some day vote favorably on that value accretion. However, if we
falsely believe that true profitability is higher than it really is because we
failed to perceive or properly account for the clever disguising of expenses;
or if we improperly believe that management will use a higher percentage of
profits for business improvement and management, instead, lines their own
pockets with it; then we are likely to be very disappointed in the results of
otherwise good research.

In the absence of legal boundaries that would serve to keep the lion's share of
the profits accruing to the benefit of the shareholders, I think we value
investors would be well served to try to discover the true cost of management
expense and make sure we deduct that cost in our efforts to determine net
profitability. We may not live in a perfect world but as value investors we
must construct our formulations in order to accurately reflect the one we find
ourselves facing in order to benefit from the true gems we can uncover.

there's no way that such things could or should be regulated...this is akin to
the congressional nonsense about windfall taxes on energy companies simply
because they had a few great years of profits...let's all be socialists and
redistribute the wealth every few years...or we can go back to the carter years
with 90% income taxes and no incentive for anyone to be an entrepreneur or take
any risk...that sure worked out well <g>

if you choose not to own stock in a particular company because it gives options
to its management and/or employees, so be it, but it is irresponsible and
impossible to try to determine an "acceptable" level for compensation

some people here are saying options are okay for someone who takes a risk at
starting with a fledgling company, by why are they then not also okay for
someone who stays with an established company, out of loyalty, to help them
compete with said fledgling companies? should we incentivize people to switch
jobs more often, and thus slant the playing field away from big companies to
small, even more than it often already is? you could never regulate this
anyway, as how will you determine what is a small company vs. what is a big
company?

it's one thing to say that the backdating of options was deceitful, it clearly
was...it's quite another thing to say that companies like YHOO or whoever, that
issue options as part of their strategy to attract and keep intellectual
talent, are somehow deceiving you or anyone else

frankly, i remain convinced that the whole options accounting situation is a
lot of BS...when a company such as YHOO issues these options, they don't have
to go out and buy them in the open market...you can say they have value, and
they do, but the value is due to the potential of the company to perform in the
future, not to any current cost

if the options are in the money in the future, the diluted earnings will
reflect the "cost" of that option grant, in terms of lower diluted
earnings...if the options expire worthless, there was never any cost to the
company or to its shareholders, as there is no dilution

all of this aside however, the point in reference to your post here is that no
one should regulate how much profit a corporation can make, or how much of
those profits it should be able to share with its management and employees...if
you don't like the compensation parameters, don't buy the stock...it's as
simple as that

finally, notice that no one cares about option grants when companies are
running on all cylinders, such as the current situation at GOOG...it only
becomes an issue when things start to slow down, such as at DELL or YHOO, and
people look to put the blame on someone...the latter two companies are not
faltering due to option grants, they are faltering due to competition eating
their lunch...stick with the leaders in a particular industry and i'm willing
to bet you won't have to worry one iota about options compensation

NBN cheap in terms of PE but subpar in virtually every performance metric:

I used the "compare to peer group" function on the FDIC website to evaluate
bank operating metrics. NBN does not look good on most metrics and particulary
bothersome is the rapid increase in non performing and noncurrent loans.

http://www3.fdic.gov/sdi/main3.asp?cert=19690&repdte=MostCurrent

That being said, the stock is cheap on a price/tangible book ratio. Tangible
book is around 15$ and NBN trades at 18$. Besides those troubling issues, NBN's
earnings have stagnated for the last 5 years despite a favorable business
environment for community banks. In a much tougher climate going forward i do
not have much hope that NBN's performance record will improve. My

Hi Spekulatius - What's your take so far of the earnings report for both the
large money center banks and the regionals? It appears to be a mixed bag and
those that meet or exceed have done this through higher fee income. The yield
curve is still flat to inverted and this probably will not help these earnings
going forward.

WM (Washington Mutual) disappointed and basically said it was due to lower
mortgage income.

I am coming to the conclusion that the marginal banks will die a slow death.
Many of these regional "value" banks may become (or are currently) a value
trap, especially as long as the yield curve stays inverted.

I care, and I avoid companies that abuse options. 

this was poorly worded on my part...what i meant was that if a company is
executing well, the fact that they pay their employees well, including options
compensation to reward them for contributing to the success of the business, is
not going to deter people from investing in that company...when a company
starts to struggle, people are more likely to pick through the various reported
numbers and point fingers at anyone they can, especially at what they consider
to be overcompensated management...ironically, at a time when a company's
performance falters, the very options someone might complain about may end up
expiring worthless, so that compensation that people were worried about, and
which the company currently would have to show as an expense, would turn out to
be worthless, and cost the company nothing

it's fine to say you avoid companies that "abuse" options, but how could this
be defined? i might think it's fine to give a key employee a few thousand
options to keep him under contract, whereas someone else might see it as

for costs they aren't incurring...it's true that the scrutiny has changed the
way some companies do business, but that is more of an example of publicly
traded companies catering to what wall street wants to see, than a correction
in what was a fully disclosed and reasonable way of doing business

again, companies like DELL and YHOO haven't suffered declines in their stock
prices because they were too liberal with options...they have suffered because
they are losing market share to competitors...frankly, from the numbers
released since the new accounting began, i don't see them cutting back much on
issuing options, and that isn't surprising, since it's part of the way they can
have any hope of remaining successful, i.e. attracting business and
technological talent who can help them innovate and improve

re Money center and regional banks: The money center banks are doing OK even
with the inverted yield curve. They have multiple income streams to offset
lower interest margins. The regional banks are in a less favorable position -
they live off interest income and subsequently are seeing margin compression.

I think that concerns about the death of regional banks is premature. Sure the
consolidation will continue- the larger fish will eat the little ones but that
opens up new opportunities for small banks to grow. The current soft condition
will hasten that pace of consolidation so I am hoping that money can be made.
Some of the small banks I am looking at are reasonably valued and well managed
- FNLC being a prime example, I hope.

Then the SEC is doing is what?

....this is akin to the congressional nonsense about windfall taxes on energy
companies simply because they had a few great years of profits.

No, it is not. I'm not proposing taking away the corporate profits, I'm
proposing an accounting change which accurately reflects the expenses of doing
business and urging the discovery and implementation of measures to protect the
public from insiders pilfering the profits.

...if you choose not to own stock in a particular company because it gives
options to its management and/or employees, so be it, but it is irresponsible
and impossible to try to determine an "acceptable" level for compensation.

So you put yourself on the side of the issue that says it is OK that I, as an
owner, get the profits stolen from me by greedy management but not OK for me to
want there to be a law against the theft?

...some people here are saying options are okay for someone who takes a risk at
starting with a fledgling company,...

I'm not one of those people. If stock is to be used to "incent" the brightest,
buy it on the open market and use it as you will, expensing it at fair market
whenever you do. Eliminate options, they are nothing but a method for abuse.

...it's one thing to say that the backdating of options was deceitful, it
clearly was...

But, according to your position you don't believe it should be punished because
you don't believe it should be regulated in the first place.

...it's quite another thing to say that companies like YHOO or whoever, that
issue options as part of their strategy to attract and keep intellectual
talent, are somehow deceiving you or anyone else.

I never claimed YHOO was being deceitful. I claimed surprise and outrage over
the fact that management took such a lion's share of the profits. I do claim
that those companies who one the one hand buy stock for treasury stock and on
the other issue stock out of treasury stock to meet options maturities are
doing so with the intention of being deceitful. That process has only one
purpose for being used....so that the expense is not expensed.

frankly, i remain convinced that the whole options accounting situation is a
lot of BS...when a company such as YHOO issues these options, they don't have
to go out and buy them in the open market...you can say they have value, and
they do, but the value is due to the potential of the company to perform in the
future, not to any current cost

I've heard that argument before and it is misguided (at best). Maybe there is
or is not a cost when the option is issued. But there is definitely a cost when
they are exercised and the company pays that cost when they buy stock to
prevent dilution, so the cost is quantifiable. If there was no value to the
options, they could not serve the function you suggest they serve best: to
attract the best and brightest. Again, if a company wants to issue stock on a
vestiture basis, let them buy it on the open market and expense it on the same
basis. That they don't has a reason and that reason is that management wants
the best of both worlds: outrageous compensation and a company that looks more
profitable than it really is.

...all of this aside however, the point in reference to your post here is that
no one should regulate how much profit a corporation can make,...

I certainly do not advocate regulating how much money a corporation can make as
long as they adhere to the rules of a fair and open marketplace.

...or how much of those profits it should be able to share with its management
and employees...

If it is a publicly traded company then what I am advocating is that the
shareholders be protected as well as management. The pendulum has swung too far
and management is just taking profits whether they have added value or not. If
the insiders want to take all of the profits that's fine, then keep the company
private or take it private at a fair market price.

...if you don't like the compensation parameters, don't buy the stock...it's as
simple as that...

I don't, it is as simple as that. However, we live and operate in a much larger
community than just ourselves. When there was no law, the survival of the
fittest worked very well. When we moved beyond that, we started giving
protection to those of us who weren't necessarily the fittest because of a lot
of reasons, most of which benefitted us.

If you take the position that you can only keep your money until a man with a
gun or a thief in the night decides to take it from you, then you begin to
break down that fabric of society.

It is no different in the world of business and publicly traded entities: if we
allow the person with the gun or the thief in the night to take all of the
profits, soon there won't be any investors to object because they will have
realized it for a sucker's game and will have gone elsewhere.

The system breaks down when theft is endemic. I submit that what is occurring
in corporate America is approaching epidemic proportions (if not already
there).

I'm all for ingenuity and making out well in life based on hard and smart work.
But I am not in favor of stealing from the public. I am smart enough to be able
to distill the numbers so that I can determine what I view to be a more
accurate portrayal of net profitability. So I will make out fine. But the
average investor must continue to have faith in the system for it to continue
to work as a method of liquidity. I suggest that that faith, once violated,
will be generations in returning. Look at how long it took Americans to begin
to trust the stock markets again after the Great Depression.

I have heard a saying that I often use on my internet "profiles" that I think
applies here: "Any damn fool can learn from their own mistakes! But it takes a
wise man to learn from the mistakes of others."

Do we learn from the mistakes of past generations and stop the fraud and deceit
before the public loses all confidence? Or do we continue to not-so-humbly
assert that no protection of the public is needed and let the robber barons
disguised as CEOs, and CFOs do what they want?

If it were only a matter of a few thousand options, I doubt many of us would
even care. But understating the problem is not addressing the problem.

I saw a 10K the other day where the company gave 48 million options. Look at
the stock and options held by today's CEOs and I dare you to find 100 companies
int he S&P 500 where the CEO, or CFO (who have held their position for longer
than a year) have stock or options measured in the "few thousand" range. Come
on! If the problem is as low key as you suggest surely there must be 100
companies out of 500 that qualify. What is that, just 20% of the companies? Is
that too high a hurdle? How about 50 companies then....just 10% of the top 500
companies. Surely if the problem is as small as you suggest you can find 10% of
the companies who pass that screen!

...it's true that the scrutiny has changed the way some companies do business,
but that is more of an example of publicly traded companies catering to what

Uh-huh, is that to say that Wall Street wants to see a rash of companies
missing their filing deadlines because they have to go back through and restate
years of earnings? Perhaps the original disclosures were not as full as needed?
I know that may be a brash interpretation, but after all the accounting

to the first line, the SEC is telling companies how to account for options, it
is not regulating how much of their profits they can pay to management and/or
employees

you claim to want a fair and open marketplace, yet you want all kinds of
regulations to supposedly protect every shareholder from themselves, and tell
companies how much they can pay their management and employees...the companies
who don't act responsibly toward their shareholders will not survive in a fair
and open marketplace, where they compete with thousands of other companies for
shareholder dollars

it isn't government's job to protect the stupid people from their stupidity, or
the lazy people from their laziness...this is akin to people suing the
brokerage analysts because they lost money in the dotcom bust...people are
responsible for their own investments, if they can't figure out individual
stocks, they can buy mutual funds...if they can't figure those out, hopefully
they can find a competent financial planner...the last thing we need in this
country is more and more laws to burden businesses...why don't we just
reinstitute prohibition because some people are too stupid to drink
responsibly? oh yeah, that didn't work either

i think it comes down to a simple premise: you see corporations as evil
conspirators who will take any advantage they can get, at anyone else's
expense, that people need to be protected from...there are clearly miscreants
out there, but the problems aren't widespread, and those who would choose to
abuse the trust of their shareholders are going to do it no matter how many
laws you enact...as such, similar to the new options rules and things such as
reg FD and sarbox, passing even more laws won't stop the few bad apples, it
will only cause further expense and annoyance to everyone else

as for the options, there is zero cost when they are exercised, except the
earnings dilution...if the company decides to buy back shares to counteract the
dilution, then there is cost in terms of a lower cash balance earning interest,
or a higher debt balance costing them interest, and either of these is
reflected in the earnings statement...of course they have value to the
recipient, but again, that value is in the future appreciation of the company,
and is offset by the future dilution of earnings

it's true that a company could issue stock instead of options, but that means
certain dilution, instead of dilution only in the case of stock appreciation,
so that's either more costly to shareholders, if the stock price goes down, or
equally costly, if the stock goes up...it's never a better solution in terms of
how it affects the shareholders, it just perhaps makes them feel more "warm and
fuzzy" in the meantime

companies aren't taking your or anyone's money with a gun or knife...investors
choose to buy shares, and except for the occasional outlaw company, all of
these issues are fully disclosed in the filings of these companies...again,
it's not the government's responsibility to protect people from their laziness
in not fully investigating the companies they are investing in

again, it's as simple as looking at the way a company operates, and deciding if
you want to invest in that company

sure a company the size of an S&P 500 corporation may give its CEO thousands of
options over the years, or companies that have grown from very small to that
size may have management that has been there all along, such as bill gates, and
own huge chunks of the company, through shares and options...all of this is
fully disclosed, and if an investor doesn't like it, they can keep searching
for an investment they do like

my point is that there is no way to define an exact parameter for a company
that is "abusing" options

companies like GS grant millions of options, yet they make billions of dollars,
and have rewarded shareholders handsomely...every situation is different

as to the last paragraph, the rules changes were not made to address
backdating, the backdating was found in part due to the additional scrutiny of
the new rules...in that way you could say the rules served a purpose, but
forcing companies to account for expenses that don't exist is still flawed, no
matter the ancillary benefit of uncovering past indiscretions...they could just
as easily have passed laws to tighten up the regulations on options disclosure,
without adding the flawed accounting treatment

I'm with TimbaBear.

Every medium or large company has a director of compensation and maybe a small
staff to determine fair compensation for the business policies set by
management/bod. That is, for guys like engineers, if the company decides it
wants to pay its senior engineers with say five years' experience the top 80
decile of what such engineers earn on a national basis (if the company draws
talent nationwide, for example), the the comp guy(s) can say what that salary
should be.

Now that same comp. director and team should be able to work with the bod and
its comp. committee for executive compensations to come up with 'fair' pay
packages. But in my limited experience it doesn't quite work that way. Because,
they and the consultant guys they hire are all sort of implicitly in cahoots.
The consultants better recommend high pay or the MANAGEMENT which hires and
works with them, won't hire this consulting firm but once. And the beloved
compensation director when he's brought before the BOD - he or she better price
the CEO's pay high - recommend more options etc. Importanly those benefits move
down to lower levels . Thus the recomendation that the VP's and directors
should also be getting options and bonus pay too.(by lesser amounts of course).
Mr./Ms. Compensation Director - do you want to be loved or hated by your
director or vp peers? Loved or hated by the people above you? Mr./Ms.
Compensation Director, whatsa matter with you - don't you want a taste too -
options for your bosses, options for you and other directors too.

===================
Let me look at it this way. Have you (hypothetical you) ever worked for a mean
S.O.B.? A vindictive, self-serving, smart moderately-successful guy that every
normal underling in the organization dislikes/avoids? What can you do to
improve your situation? Move to another department? What can you do to improve
your situation vis-a-vis him (or her)? Change his behavior somehow? Heck no!!
So who's at fault here? I say not you and NOT him. You can't change the spots
on the leopard. The person responsible is the idiot boss one level up who put
the S.O.B. in charge and has kept him (or her) there in spite of the havoc and
morale issues the S.O.B. causes and will continue to cause. So....

How about we forget about the Boards of Directors and go up a level right to
the owners of the company - those institutional investors who own so much of
the company? How come mutual funds are not required to show how they voted on
each item in the proxy statements? From what I read, they almost always side
with management in approving option grants. Let these funds sign off that they
are doing such, and maybe THEIR bosses - the fund stockholders - might make a
determination they might not want to hold mutual fund shares where
institutional investors won't attempt to keep outrageous option grants or
salaries/bonuses in check.

As the ad in all those in-flight magazines says, "you get what you negotiate,
not what you deserve". Somewhere along the line the pendalum swings too far,
and people's sense of fairness will bring it back...I can only hope. Just as I
hope that the judge in today's news will make Mr. Grasso return $100M or more
of his pay package. That'd be a start.

then you are saying that the person higher up than that boss, who keeps that
boss in place, is responsible for poor morale in his company, and may end up
losing good people below that boss because of his actions, which i also agree
with

however, you are then saying that it's the analysts' or fund managers' or
shareholders' job to get rid of an ineffective or abusive boss? that doesn't
make sense...how would such people even know about one particular supervisor in
a company?

if you instead say that rather than the compensation director and his staff,
the analysts, fund managers, and shareholders should regulate how many options
are given to various employees or management, they already have votes for the
compensation packages for management...if enough shareholders think the company
is overpaying, let them vote against that compensation...if you are looking at
a company to invest in, and you think compensation is excessive, and there is
no way to change that because the stock is mostly owned by institutions, and
those institutions will continue to vote yes on the compensation, it's the same
as the previous posts: don't buy that stock

perhaps the case is that the majority of fund managers know that management
that successfully formulates and executes a business plan deserves significant
compensation, whereas so many people see the big dollar signs on the management
paychecks, and just assume "no one is worth that much money"

i kind of look at it this way: i graduated from college with a degree, and
could have become an engineer, and maybe by now i'd have worked my way up to
middle or even upper management, because i'm pretty good at thinking on my
feet, and i've built three of my own businesses in the interim, so i must at
least have reasonably effective business and entrepreneurial skills...however,
could i also manage a huge organization effectively, dealing with all of the
people and corporate issues, and would i want to commit the time and energy it
would take to devote almost my entire life to running said company? if so, and
if i managed to run that company well enough to generate tens or hundreds of
millions of dollars of profits a year, how much would be reasonable
compensation for my efforts? many people seem to think it should be a few
hundred thousand, or maybe a million, but you are talking about someone
spearheading a company that earns a million dollars a day, or five million a
day, or maybe fifty million a day...i would have to believe that if i was
running a company making that kind of money, i would be worth a lot more than a
million bucks a year to said company...if i had those abilities, and someone
offered me 500K a year or something like that to do the job, and maybe a
handful of options to participate in some small way in the success of the
company, i can't imagine i would be especially interested

as such, and especially since i don't have any desire to give my life to
running a company (nor has anyone asked me <g>), i find it very reasonable that
these CEO's and CFO's make millions of dollars a year for what they do

it's kind of like baseball players...people look at them and say all they do is
play a sport, how is that worth 15 or 20 million dollars a year? but people are
willing to pay 10, 20, 30, 50 dollars a ticket to go watch them play, or sit in
front of the TV for three hours, watching them play and watching commercials
that are paid for by sponsors...so if you can do what they do, go for it, and
you can make that kind of money too...less than 1000 people in the entire world
make their living playing major league baseball, these are the best baseball
players in the entire world...so how much are the 1000 people worth who are the
CEO and CFO of the 500 S&P companies, especially the ones whose companies are
successful, indicating that they are among the best corporate managers in the
world? certainly a pretty significant amount of money...again, if you can do
what they do, go for it

anyway, the main issue here is that i don't think the government should be
regulating such things...the shareholders get a vote, and any shareholder can
always vote on his own behalf by selling the stock and buying some other stock

I'm saying you can't blame an SOB for being an SOB, you have to go beyond that,
and similarly, the BOD does what it does and you have to go beyond the BOD.

I'm not saying government should regulate or not regulate options. I'm saying
all of the approval process should be visible all the way through. If we
actually see some of these funds approving the options in the proxies, and it
gets in the media, and people start questioning the fund, I believe you will
see less rubber stamping by those funds.
==========
Lots of these larger businesses are run by people with good political and
social skills who've risen to the top. They are not builders or creators, they
are more like caretakers. Some of these guys have never started or run a
business where they had to make a payroll. It's my opinion that too many of
these guys are getting high pay because of their excellent political skills and
less on their business acumen. (Perhaps political skill is THE business skill,
or perhaps political skills are just always more rewarded than other executive
skills.)

Carl Icahn, Michael Price have become billionaires by fighting entrenched and
self-serving managements. They unlocked value where executives with or without
options, failed.

Japanese executives and to a lesser extent European executives seem to do okay
and be okay compensation-wise, and they manage huge companies. While they have
different perk arrangements from Americans, there doesn't seem to be a need or
desire for stock options or a demand for multi-multimillion dollar salaries.

It just seems to me every company I look at has executives with options. Many
of the companies are in cyclical businesses. It seems the options are granted
at low stock prices when business is bad, and exercised at high prices. If this
is compensation, that's one thing. If the options are to "incentivize" though,
I question whether the economic upswing brought more business and higher stock
price or if the executives themselves really had that much effect.

Athletes are in a bidding process because I assume they have unique skills
and/or personalities (can draw the paying advertisers or crowds). That kind of
uniqueness is not so obvious to me as regards management talent.

certainly management's ability varies, and there are many cases where an
outsider such as icahn has every reason to believe that the current management
of a company would best be replaced by someone else...this usually isn't
because they are under or overpaid though, it's usually just that they aren't
executing, and paying them more or less probably wouldn't improve things

i give more credit to most CEO's than you do though, especially since i listen
to a lot of conference calls, and find a significant difference between those
that are successfully running large corporations, and those who are either
running smaller companies, or who are ineffectively running companies of any
size

i think the compensation packages that many CEO's receive are very much a
result of a bidding process similar to what athletes benefit from...just like
athletes, not all CEO's or CFO's live up to the package they are given, but
whereas one pitcher probably can't carry a team all the way to a world series
title, i do think that an excellent CEO can direct a company to consistently
strong execution, by his assemblance of a strong management team, and by his
vision for the company...in the words of mastercard, that may indeed be nearly
"priceless"

i think we can agree on the need for visibility, and the lack of need for
government regulation...the relative value of a CEO will have to be left in the
eye of the beholder ;)

Once again we disagree. Managers with the integrity of Buffett are few and far
between. The vast majority of ceos are looking to get whatever they possibly
can get from shareholders. No small shareholder would ever approve the golden
parachutes that BODs give away. Otherwise you wouldnt see the likes of supra
voting shares, separate health plans for management versus employees, the
special retirement-trusts funds that were set up by the airlines for their
senior management when they knew that banruptcy was imminent. Management steals
from shareholders in numerious ways that we have no control over. The repricing
of options after the fact is just one example. Frequently there are sweetheart
deals that are not fully disclosed between the company you have invested in and
other companies controlled by management. In one situation , the company
disposed of its key assets to a British company which in turn hired the ceo,
founder, and largest shareholder as their new ceo, terms of the contract were
not disclosed. When I called the company and questioned that the transaction
was approved without shareholder consent, they informed me that they were not
required to seek approval for asset sales. On a larger scale several
participants on this thread were burned by the Seagate LBO, which we all knew
was a total shareholder ripoff. How often do minority shareholders get taken to
the cleaners?

In fact I have strong fears about my position in SSALF so much so that I have
contacted another larger shareholder with the notion that we could possibly get
a large number of minority shareholders and sell our position to a fund such as
third avenue who would have the legal muscle to protect its interests better
than a small minority shareholder like me.

It's fine to say you avoid companies that "abuse" options, but how could this
be defined?

You might as well say "it's fine to say you should invest in companies with
'good' management, but how could this be defined?" It's not that hard. Look at
share dilution, gross options grants, do the "Buffett estimate" and make a
judgment - with the standard set higher for a large company with billions on
the balance sheet and a business that could succeed for a while if you put a
bunch of monkeys in charge.

it's true that the scrutiny has changed the way some companies do business, but
that is more of an example of publicly traded companies catering to what wall
street wants to see, than a correction in what was a fully disclosed and
reasonable way of doing business

Options were supposed to be an incentive to create value for shareholders. In
too many cases they have been used as a means to extract value from
shareholders. To the people who are truly using options properly (however few
or many they may be), the rule change should make no difference. To those who
are using options to take money out the back door, it does make a difference.
That works for me.

I believe that the current stock options and executive compensation trend is
and indication that the current system fails. Government has a system of checks
and balances, public corporations have a BOD to do the checks. The problem is
that this BOD (until very lately) is very closely aligned with management and
consists of the same pool of people than management and does not seem to be
able to effectively control management. Most shareholding are nowadays indirect
through institutions which effectively does not allow the real owners to
control any this.

As far as stock options are concerned, the disclosure has come a long way to
clarify the extend of compensation and Sarbanes Oxley has helped to uncover the
backdating problem. But disclosure goes only so far, when there are no
effective means to act on the information. It's time for some activist index
funds, I think., Enough money in those could in fact make a differences,
especially when they were to become an option in retirement funds.

well of course you could do that, and perhaps that would even make sense in
some ways, but everyone says management, and even key employees, should be
"paid for performance"...the only ways to do that are (a) to set up some kind
of bonus scale to pay them a year end bonus based on that year's revenues or
earnings, or (b) to give them options that reward them only if the stock goes
up

i would argue that as a shareholder, (b) is preferable since the only thing
that matters to a shareholder in the end is how the stock performs...sure that
method may reward the options recipients handsomely if their company's stock
goes up ten or twenty fold over many years, but shouldn't people who
demonstrate that kind of performance be well rewarded? my answer would
certainly be yes

in either case however, the costs will reflect at the bottom line...currently
(a) could be preferable in that respect, since it eliminates the need to take
flawed charges for the options grants, but either way, the same arguments will
be made about what is "excessive compensation," and either way people will
never agree on what is an "acceptable" level for that compensation...if we
eliminated everything in our society that people can't quite agree on, there
would be nothing left (no religions, no pricing of anything, no speed limits,
perhaps no vehicles to begin with since what is an "acceptable" emissions level
or MPG standard, etc)

i'm pretty amazed by the lack of faith in corporate management in general here,
especially from people who are so involved in the market, or maybe even make
their living from these pursuits, as i do...i know there are some bad apples
out there, just like in anything in our society, but i continue to believe that
the majority of these people are not just out there looking to enrich
themselves, but genuinely want their companies, their employees, and their
shareholders, to prosper from their decisions

but everyone says management, and even key employees, should be "paid for
performance"...

I'm kind of old fashioned, I believe you get to keep getting paid if you
perform. Just because one does their job well is not a reason to reward them
even more. The high salary and perks coming in were the incentive to do the job
well. I wonder how many of these folks would be as generous if they were the
sole owners of a company and hired a manager to run the business. I suspect
that their whole definition of "generous" would be an order or two of magnitude
less.

the only ways to do that are (a) to set up some kind of bonus scale to pay them
a year end bonus based on that year's revenues or earnings, or (b) to give them
options that reward them only if the stock goes up.

The only ways, eh? I suspect there are many more ways than just two.

i would argue that as a shareholder, (b) is preferable since the only thing
that matters to a shareholder in the end is how the stock performs...

I would argue that as an investor what matters most is how, as an owner, I get
to participate in the profits. Therefore, when my ownership is constantly
diluted I take umbrage with that. In your approach, if stock price is all that
matters then you are subscribing to the "Greater Fool" theory of speculation:
as long as you can find a greater fool to sell it to, you're happy. It does
take all kinds to make a market.

in either case however, the costs will reflect at the bottom line...

You're living in a world different than I then. In the world I see, the true
expenses of doing business are not reflected in the bottom line, except in a
few good companies. In the world I see, the management of companies are
siphoning off the profits in as many clever ways as they can and there is no
owner to fire them. They are not accountable to shareholders because the big
shareholders (mutual funds) often do not vote and the lack of vote is construed
as a vote in favor of management's position. So, with no one watching the
register, why not take all you can?

i'm pretty amazed by the lack of faith in corporate management in general here,
especially from people who are so involved in the market, or maybe even make
their living from these pursuits, as i do..

I have plenty of faith in management. I have faith that they will operate in
their own best interests and that they will work in my best interest only when
they have to. If no one forces them to operate primarily in my best interest,
then they'd be viewed as fools by their peers to do any differently.

We don't learn security analysis because management is so warm and cuddly. We
learn it in order to be able to perceive the profitability of the enterprise
even when the management is doing its best to provide glossies.

...i know there are some bad apples out there...

Good. Can you quantify the number? If not, why not? You say you make your
living in this field, at least you should have a handle on percentages
then.....I asked you in a prior post to show me even just 10% of the CEOs and
CFOs of the S&P 500 that just had "a few thousand" (your description) options.
You've demurred on even rising to that challenge, so how can you quantify the
current management situation as "some bad apples?"

...then again, as i wander the halls of SI, it's pretty clear that as a person
who sees the glass at least half full..

I think any of us can measure how much liquid is in a glass. How we describe it
shows our bias if we have one. Bias is expensive in investing.

You keep attributing my motives to some liberal do-gooder type of thought
process where the Government is God and wealth must be distributed evenly. I
have no such illusions. I am after a level playing field and rules which
prevent the managers of public companies from stealing me blind if I'm an owner
of that company. If one takes the position that such rules are not possible,
then such a marketplace will eventually dry up and blow away as the suckers are
slowly bled dry and new meat becomes more skittish.

I think it says a lot about how far we have already lowered the bar when
reasonable people believe not only that managers deserve whatever profits they
can take, but to try to regulate that kind of behavior is somehow more
obnoxious than the theft itself.

you are wildly distorting my words, i never said it's okay for managers to take
whatever they can get, i said that it's reasonable to pay them well for strong
performance

i can see your point that a manager who performs well "gets to keep getting
paid," but i don't think that applies to a manager who performs exceptionally
well...i have worked for myself for 20 years, but i have worked at and with
various corporate entities in my lifetime, and i've always found that about 10%
of the people do about 90% of the work that truly makes a difference for that
corporation...probably 70% of the rest do their job well enough that they
should continue to get paid, and the other 20% probably need to be removed, or
to receive a kick in the rear end, although in many corporate settings that is
not going to happen because they are union workers...when the 10% are not
rewarded for their efforts, they end up going elsewhere, and the remaining 90%
end up in an enterprise that is doomed to fail...as such, rewarding the 10%
well actually benefits the entire 100%, so it could easily be argued that your
idea of unfair compensation is actually far more beneficial to the masses

you say there are other ways to reward performance, but you suggest none...i
suppose you could give them a bumper sticker to put on their car that says, i
was the employee of the month at XYZ corp, but i'm thinking that won't help
retain the best talent <g>

my example of a few thousand options was clearly stated as a reward for a key
employee, it was not to imply that CEO's are getting only a few thousand
options...taking my remarks out of context and then challenging me to back up
an assertion you made up for me isn't going to get much of a response

one thing we definitely agree on: you are living in a different world than i
am...in my world i think our corporate system works pretty well, sure there are
flaws, i'm not going to spend my time hunting down and delineating every little
misstep, i can simply not buy those companies' stock...the playing field will
never be level, that's how it is, life isn't always fair, and while i could sit
around all day wishing it was, or hoping i could somehow make it so, the
reality is that it won't happen, so the best thing i can do is find the best
investments i can find, and help some people along the way to improve their
investing, or to improve their lives through charity, volunteering, etc...this
isn't me giving up or turning a blind eye to let people commit fraud, it's
dealing with reality, where some people are going to cheat no matter how many
laws you pass or how many checks and balances you think you can set up to stop
them...more laws don't make things better, they usually make things worse

you say that management is siphoning off profits in mysterious, undisclosed
ways, that don't show up at the bottom line...clearly there are some who have
backdated options or used other shenanigans to line their pockets, but again,
this is the minority...you want me to quantify the percentage of good vs. bad,
but what purpose would this serve? and since a successful, well paid, well
incentivized manager is fine in my eyes, and apparently bad in yours, we would
never agree on the guidelines for good vs. bad anyway...i believe that the
"bad" management, in terms of simply not caring about shareholders, and/or
being overpaid for underperforming, is the distinct minority...again, this is
very much in the eye of the beholder, but if it's so easy to go out and do what
these people do, why aren't there thousands of candidates lining up for these
jobs and offering to do them for substantially less money? i continue to
believe that it is a very significant minority of our population that can
effectively run one of the biggest corporations in the world, just like my
comparison to the best athletes

it isn't about rules to level the playing field, it's about supply and
demand...if a corporation runs its operations so unevenly that the shareholders
are not rewarded, while management laughs all the way to the bank, eventually
the shareholders will cease to be so...if they want to go blindly forward and
allow themselves to be "robbed" by management, that's their issue, it's not up
to the SEC or anyone else to pass laws to protect them from their sloth...if
that is your aim, why not also pass laws to force investors to sell any mutual
fund that charges above average fees for below average performance? we could
just keep making laws until the end of time

in making a living from this pursuit, i don't need to know the percentages of
good vs. bad management, i just need to find enough examples of effective
execution to build a solid portfolio...certainly there have been cases where i
believed management, and that belief turned out to be misplaced...in most cases
the charts and earnings reports begin to show things deteriorating, and the
studious observer can get out before he or she suffers significant losses, but
i've even had a case or two where the stock went to zero overnight due to
outright fraud...would i rather that some kind of system had been in place so
that that management couldn't have "robbed" me of my investment? sure, but
that's never going to happen

you make light of the glass half full idea, but it really comes down to this: i
see the majority of managers out there working in shareholders' interests,
along with their own of course, and see very little evidence of the "siphoning
off" of profits in undisclosed ways...you see the corporate system as a rigged
game where you are the underdog and have no hope of succeeding without someone
to write rules to protect you...sure that is probably overstated a bit, but in
reading your posts, i find it hard to believe that you could ever bring
yourself to invest in any company...obviously your universal scorn for
management must give way slightly at times to allow you to buy shares in an
enterprise here and there

perhaps you are like mr. buffett...he is constantly saying that he wouldn't buy
his own stock, and can't find much of interest to invest in, yet he always
seems to gradually deploy his money somewhere, and delivers very solid returns
to his shareholders, even as his assets under management are far more than most
of us could probably ever deploy effectively

i will start calling you timbabuffett, how is that? <g>

just to take that one step further, as far as i know, mr. buffett has no
options, so he benefits in lock step with his shareholders as the stock rises,
but considering that he built this company, would it be all that unfair if out
of a net adjusted gain of 100 units of some measure in a year, he chose to take
a comparative 52 of those units and give 48 to the shareholders? after all, he
is the guiding light of that corporation, so while the shareholders did nothing
but trust mr. buffett with their money all year, he was the steward of whatever
value was built in that time...to me, he would well deserve to receive more of
the benefit from the success than the passive investors, but hey, that's just
my world, and what do i know? <g>

by the way, i would also see nothing wrong with taking another 3 or 5 or 7 of
those units and dividing that sum reasonably among the rest of the enterprise
structure, to reward them for their performance...i know, you will say the big
bad mean corporations are taking 90 of those units and leaving only 10 for the
shareholders, but i think that is untrue (and no, i can't go company by company
through the S&P and tell you how many units each one is taking, we will have to
just agree to disagree on how nefarious all of these villainous offenders are
<g>)

one thing his argument points out is a further flaw in the new accounting
standards: a company that has the potential for higher growth over time, but a
far less certain future, has to take a bigger charge for its options than a
more staid company, with a much more certain growth path

is it really more valuable to have an option on what might be the "next
microsoft," (and may instead end up being the next SUNW or the next
bankruptcy), or what is already a solid company, such as BAC or GS? as far as
long term options go, i would take the latter every time

for me, the main problem with CEO compensation at this point is that in many
cases, they are hired with benefits packages that reward them even if they
don't perform very well...a CEO let go after a few years for poor performance
usually still leaves with a "golden parachute," that pays him millions of
dollars for mediocrity

what better way to remedy this situation than to give him options that vest
over a number of years, but are cancelled if he is removed from his position
before they vest or are exercised, so that he benefits very nicely from guiding
the company to strong performance, but earns nothing above his salary if the
company founders?

POSS has been a basket case for years, there was a local guy on the radio here
who touted the stock forever, and even probably helped it to rise early in this
decade by his continued pumping

however, they have never produced consistent results, and while the book value
is up slightly in the past couple of years, it is down from 2004...you look at
that paragraph and see a problem with the options compensation, and i might
agree, depending on the specifics, since i find the accounting that leads to
those numbers flawed, and have no idea what was actually granted and at what
price (i could research same but the company isn't worth the effort)...however,
i look at that paragraph and see declining sales and low profit margins, so the
rest becomes irrelevant, as far as any kind of attractive investment
possibility...admittedly, my opinion is negatively biased by having heard this
local moron tout the stock for years, while it essentially marked time

the stock has made zero progress in 15 years, i think that pretty much says it
all <g>

they are a small cap company operating in a big cap world, so unless they can

Blankmind, I do believe these companies should be selling at or better than
their book value. They mostly do, based on my experience. (Or will do
eventually, like CSBK might.) Perhaps even those who don't use stated or
tangible book value might rate book value a little more relevant for the
banking sector. Imo because depreciation isn't quite the suspect component -
much banking assets being "money", which is not depreciable.

The negative here for me - based on how I tend to look at bank stocks and which
is just my way - is that I like to see high return on assets compared to
price/book value. CSBK seems to have a low roa figure compared to stated book
value and a worse comparison when roa is compared to the higher tangible book
value the company may have. So I'm staying away.

OTOH, perhaps those "inefficient" assets could be better managed to improve roa
as the bank sees pressure from key shareholders (bank transitions to a public
company mindset). That might kick up earnings and share price.

TimbaBear, I'm with Carl Worth regarding POSS. The stock won't pass any of my
screens.

My questions (to you or anyone else who might opine) are:

Is significant option expense generally a one time event? Might we assume the
odds are in our favor that POSS next year won't have such high option expense,
and so the company has a good chance of showing favorable earnings comparisons
next year (if we even could assume the company will have earnings at all)? That
might tend to make the stock a buy IF the stock's at its "depressed" prices
now.

To make such a conclusion is it necessary as Carl Worth implies
("(I) have no idea what was actually granted and at what price") to read the
relevant proxy/10k passages to make some estimate for option executions/options
expenses for next year? I suspect so--- and that seems too complicated a task
for me to grasp or base a buy decision on.

Paul - What do you consider an acceptable ROA for a regional bank stock? Also,
is the ROE not a better measure for how efficient the bank is using the
stockholder's funds? If so, what level of return is considered the minimum
acceptable amount (when doing a stock screen).

I am having a hard time measuring "true" value for a lot of these bank stocks
because goodwill charges overstate the BV. In many cases this is a very large
number.

E_K_S. As I say or imply, I've been having a difficult time coming up with
formulas to use in picking bank stocks. Roa is an industry standard measure for
evaluating bank stocks (I believe), and that's what I'm trying to incorporate.
I've not used roe for this sector, and don't have any experience with it here.

My investing approach toward banks, and indeed in almost all of my work, is the
assumption that at some price every stock (well, almost every stock) is a
value. Therefore, to me, there can not be any minimum acceptable roa or roe
cutoff number. In other words, I never want to say .8% roa is acceptable (buy
or look closer), 1.5% is even better, and .4% roa is terrible, ergo just avoid.
These numbers - to me - cannot just stand alone. I'm more than willing to buy a
crummy .3% roa bank if the stock price is also low enough. And if I can buy a
bank generating a decent 1.5% and IF the price is low enough (which it
invariably is not), it's a buy too, for me. The problem I'm having is that I'm
not able to refine or develop other measures which put the continuum of roa's
and any other factor into a buy or avoid decision. I can do it in rough
quadrants for a two factor model using p/bk., but not good enough to make
confident decisions. That is, imo, if a stock has high price/book value and
high roa, it's roughly not a buy for me. (Because while it's likely a very good
bank generating good roa numbers, it's not at bargain price according to my
model.) If I can find a stock with a high roa AND low p/bk (a rare
combination), I'm willing to buy. And if I can find a stock with low roa and
also low p/bk I'm again willing to buy. The problem is, what is "low"? I can
only relate "low" for roa and "low" p/bk in very general terms. For example I
can't make a definitive decision on .5% roa with 1.5x book, or .8 roa & 1.8%
book, etc. etc.

As I've said, I need to do some more work in this area, either get more
empirical data (perform regression analysis??), use different or additional
measures with roa, or something. Can start to get complicated. Too complicated
for me.

Community banks valuation -
The opinions about the correct valuation of community banks differ. First of
all i would distinguish between the "half public" MHC like OSHC, KRNY, CSBK or
community banks that have been public for a long time. What matters for banks
is tangible capital, not book value, IMO. In most cases the difference is
goodwill due to acquisitions. A well managed community bank should be able to
achieve a return on assets of at least 1%, which translates into a ROE of about
15% assuming reasonable leverage. The ROA is a better measure than the ROE
because it compensates for different leverage.

Another value metric I look at is Deposit/ market cap ratio (of course it
matters if deposits are growing too). A reasonable valuation is 20% of
deposits. This ratio should be more meaningful for an acquirer of a bank than
for example book value.Most important is the quality of assets/loans. A rapid
rise in nonperforming loans or lan past due is a red flag, IMO.Right now the
percentage of nonperforming loans of medium sized community banks is about
0.5%, so I would not like to see values much higher than that.

Spekulatis - That's a very good point regarding Deposit/market and especially
when they grow as a result of an acquisition. This may be the hidden metric
that I (and perhaps Paul) am looking for. From your experience, do these
deposits disappear over time from a buyout or is it something that the
acquiring bank can build upon and creates value for the stockholder?

When a bank has a growing deposit base, they do not depend on going to the open
market for future funds and as a result are less impacted by a flat or negative
yield curve. This would result in the eventual growth in their book value,
overall ROA and positive ROE for the investor.

I own a situation where this is playing out with NYB (New York Community
Bancorp Inc.). They recently acquired Atlantic Bank of New York and as a result
their overall deposit base grew.

There was some goodwill involved in the transaction but now that they have a
diversified growing deposit base, they are less subject to the effect of the
inverted/flat yield curve when financing their portfolio loans.

NYB is still near it's five year lows but I have to assume that the value
proposition is improving. Both the ROA and ROE seem to be in an acceptable
ranges and now that their deposit loan base is growing, this should help their
book value (when adjusted for goodwill write downs).

I am not too worried about their nonperforming loans as their business model
provides for their portfolio loans to turnover frequently. Earnings come out
Wednesday and will be interesting to see what they say. The stock sold off on
3x the normal volume last week and as a value investor I nibbled at a few more
shares. NYB is my 2nd largest holding and I expect the company to turn the
corner very soon. I believe fair value is around $20-$22/share once the yield
curve goes positive or new deposit grow is high enough to offset the flat yield
curve.

The company is at the point where (1) their earnings have stabilized and will
begin to grow OR (2) their high "relative" dividend will be cut. If (2) occurs,
then it may become a value trap or perhaps the BUY of the decade!

i've played around with NYB over the years, writing calls or puts and having
fairly limited success at making anything resembling a decent rate of return,
but i still have 200 shares at this point, so i wonder about your thoughts on
the following:

if i sell january covered calls, i get .20 a share, but i have chosen not to
sell calls for the past many months, thinking that NYB will probably get bought
out at some point, and i would likely realize more in that case than i can get
from calls, at least until the stock starts to move higher again

in the meantime, i collect a reasonably good dividend based on my cost, which i
calculate to be 16.80 since i sold 17.50 puts at .70 to acquire these shares
about a year ago

do you ever think of foregoing the call premium on the idea of a potential
buyout, or do you think that a buyout is rather unlikely?

just curious, since you obviously follow this company closely as well, probably
much more closely than me at this point, with my small remaining position

Hi Carl Worth - You state:"...do you ever think of foregoing the call premium
on the idea of a potential buyout, or do you think that a buyout is rather
unlikely?..."

Absolutely! It's much harder to take the call premium now since the potential
for a few quarters of positive earnings growth and the eventual "Buy Out" offer
will happen. The question is when and how much.

I am playing this using an option straddle strategy
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straddle). Otherwise, just be patient, accumulate
shares and wait for the company to report a few quarters of positive earnings.
The company is in a transition quarter. If we get a positive yield curve and
NYB can grow their base deposits, then your in the cat bird seat.

If the yield curve remains negative, the company stumbles and cuts their
dividend, there will be a buying opportunity.

They do have a franchise that Washington Mutual, J.P. Morgan and Citicorp would
love to have. I believe NYB will eventually be bought out. The premium for a
buy out is generally at a 20% premium to the current market price. I believe
once management can show positive earnings growth again, then a $21-$24 buy out
target is reasonable. Acquiring stock at current prices could be a value
proposition that provides for a good return. The big question is if management
would take a $22.00/share price. My answer is no! Watch the insider BUYs. If
they continue to be positive, exercise their options and HOLD their shares OR
buy new shares at the market, then a deal may be in place.

IMO at $16.13/share and they continue to pay their dividend (6.00% yield) there
is a reasonable value to buy and hold.

Is significant option expense generally a one time event?

It is for me. I treat it the same way I treat any other accounting fraud. I see
it once, I move on.

Might we assume the odds are in our favor that POSS next year won't have such
high option expense, and so the company has a good chance of showing favorable
earnings comparisons next year (if we even could assume the company will have
earnings at all)? 

Why would we assume a change without proof of same? The question then becomes:
"What proof would we accept?" For me, the answer is: a complete change in
management and Board to folks who have a reputation for being against options
issuance.

I don't care what price the options were granted or exercised. A total of
anywhere close to 20% of net profits for management compensation is defined by
me as not being shareholder friendly and I run for the hills, in POSS's case it
was closer to 80% for insiders. I'd love to believe this is rare (and maybe 80%
is rare) but we've just seen it this past week with YHOO being close to 50% of
profits to insiders, and those were just of the ones that hit this board!

Life's too short and money too tough to come by for me to get back into the
"Greater Fool" theory of throwing money away. Been there, done that and darn
near didn't survive the experience. Others can believe that greedy management
is OK for stock price appreciation, but I don't. So I take what many would
claim is a harsh position vis-a-vis the options issue. Ah well, it takes all of
us to make the market!

re Community banks - deposits are the cheapest source of funding for loans, so
it is my understanding that the deposits are very much correlated with
franchise value. Of course there are different sorts of deposits - the non
interest bearing one are much more valuable than CD's for example.

An acquirer definitely would want to build on the existing deposit base,
especially the low interest deposits (Checking accounts etc.) which also tend
to be more sticky.

Regarding NYB - i do not think this stock is cheap. Deposits are 3x market cap
which is OK but not great. Earnings barely cover dividend payments and the
capital ratio is quite low. For those reasons NYB seems like a risky stock to
me.
