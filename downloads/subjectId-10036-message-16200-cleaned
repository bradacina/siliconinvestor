Bob, I guess my key point was that if this country is going to invest existing
tax revenue in some permanent tax reduction should we encourage investment in
utility stocks or growth-oriented stocks. I agree there is little chance that
this retained earnings credit passes.

One last comment on stop loss orders. I subscribe to the Buffett "wait for the
right pitch" school of thought. I am an infrequent buyer of new ideas and when
I do it is because I can see the potential for 5-10 times on my money, and I
take good positions, in typically small companies. I plan a number of buys, am
hardly concerned about initially buying at the very best price, and hope the
stocks drop beyond most peoples' stop loss points so I can get a full position.

Paul,

I agree there are times when unusual market events will cause what should
probably be considered a buying opportunity in an existing position. Cost
averaging can be a very effective tool in certain instances, and it is
something I do use when I feel it's the best way to improve my position. At the
same time, I make every effort to avoid situations where I feel cost averaging
may end up being necessary. The same is true for stops. I don't want to lose
money, and I don't want to tie money up in losing positions for indefinite
periods of time. If I find myself thinking, "Well, I'm probably early, but I
can always average down later.", it usually means I'm about to place an order I
shouldn't. If it's a company I really would like to own, that's the place where
I feel it's time to pull up some charts and pick a target for an entry point. I
also generally try to have some idea of where my exit point should be at the
same time. It doesn't matter if the time frame is 10 minutes or 10 years,
placing an order doesn't make sense to me if there's enough doubt in my mind
that I'm already trying to figure out how fix it before I place the trade.

<<<tie that to your 1/10/3 post on INLD which has been in a general downtrend
thusly:>>>

INLD is probably as good an example as any, but the pattern doesn't show up in
a 1 year chart. Looking at the 5 year chart, support shows up just above a buck
in September 2001. Buying at previously established support levels is usually a
good percentage bet. In the case of INLD, if support holds, there's a potential
double bottom forming. Also, the theory is the longer a pattern takes to form,
the longer the duration of the resulting move. From a pure TA standpoint, INLD
wouldn't technically be a buy unless it breaks out above resistance at $3.70.
IMO, that's where TA breaks down, and FA takes over. There has to be some
reason to believe the fundamentals do, or will, justify a higher price, and the
hoped for break out move, but waiting for the buy signal based on TA leaves a
lot of money on the table. Based on the chart, I'd probably want to see the
stock in a position to crack resistance around 9 to 12 months out, that helps
me focus my research and projections on near term events likely to move the
stock. I think there's enough information available to suggest INLD is under
valued and has a good chance of hitting their projections, but that doesn't
mean they will, or that it's impossible for some unpredictable event to occur
which would affect their results. At any rate, the 5 year chart shows where the
previously established support level shows up. For the record, prior to 2001
the company did business as Micron Electronics under the ticker MUEI, so the
first half of the chart is basically for a different company. It does show up
as a nice example of what a falling knife can look like though. Once support
broke just below $10, there was nothing to hold it up except a few rounds of
short covering. Trying to cost average into that kind of chart is suicide.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=INLD&d=c&k=c1&a=v&p=s&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l

You can fine tune it a little more using other indicators:

http://clearstation.etrade.com/cgi-bin/details?Event=peek&Symbol=inld

The stochastic chart shows the stock in an extremely oversold condition about a
week ago at the same time it was retesting 2 year support levels. The
stochastic chart doesn't have the best track record for accurate buy and sell
signals on INLD, but being oversold while testing support is usually a good
sign support will hold. In the last week there have been a number of block
trades in the 500K to 1M range which is also typical of a reversal along the
bottom. Also, the stock does seem to like MACD signals which look pretty good
right now.

Anyhow, I've probably already gone too far afield with TA stuff and didn't mean
to create a paradox with the 52 week comment, which was a generalization. Two
stocks I came very close to buying last year, WCOM and KM, I avoided strictly
for technical reasons. I honestly didn't believe either one would go bankrupt,
and they both looked terribly cheap for most of the trip down. At the same
time, both stocks were in free fall, and slamming through multi year support
levels without showing even a hint of slowing down.

I seem to recall reading someplace that Buffet would sometimes spend a year
researching a company before placing an order to buy. I don't know if that's
true or not, but I get the impression he tends to be fairly patient when it
comes to what and when to buy.

Except for V shaped reversals, which happen maybe 10% of the time, and are next
to impossible to predict, most stocks will form some kind of a bottoming
pattern before they start to reverse. Even when a stock is dropping for no good
reason, such as an institutional holder dumping a large position, there will
still usually be a point where it's possible to recognize a let up in selling
pressure, which is typically followed by a period where the stock tends to
trade sideways as the market digests the extra inventory. I suppose if there's
a point to any of this, it's that buying sharp drops on bad news is something
day traders do when looking to scalp a 3% gain on a dead cat bounce. If a stock
really is a good value, it will eventually stop dropping like a fat rock and
become a good trade as well as a good value.

While I'm willing to concede that buying INLD near support, which also happens
to be the 52 week low, probably could look the same as buying WCOM at any one
of the successive 52 week lows, it's not the same kind of chart. Holding
support is something I view as being a critical part of this particular trade
though. If my assumption support would hold had turned out wrong, I'd be taking
a real hard look at the possibility that I had a loser on my hands. So far it
seems to be doing what I think it should, with the added bonus of seeing the
large blocks crossing. Anyhow, hopefully that explains why I think there's a
difference between a new low and the bottom, and maybe a little bit of why I
think throwing some TA into the mix can help to tell the difference between the
two.

Barrons Op ed: I seldom read these, but this one looked interesting - 'How Much
Is the Met Worth?'
Why some tech stocks are like art museums
The key point of the article is that the Met doesn't generate FCF for owners
because all excess is reinvested in the collections....Likewise, Intel and many
other tech companies will never generate meaningful FCF because each product
generations excess is necessarily re-invested in the next product generation.

Stop loss orders: Like Jeffrey, I tend to buy on the way down...sometimes to
disasterous effect, though. OTOH, I sometimes look at technical as well as
fundamental criteria, and may sell if the technical picture changes - a major
trendline is broken...but I don't use stoploss orders, because I figure they'll
just get picked off. I use alerts then re-evaluate.

Paul - NCR: I'm currently on the sidelines. If it weren't for the pension
issue, I'd definitely be a buyer, but this IS an issue: They backed assumed
return down to 8.5% from 10% and took a charge accordingly, but 8.5% is still
reflecting signficant optimism. Old line companies with pension and health
benefit overhangs are drawing negative attention that is more likely to
intensify before it disipates. Also worrisome is Dell's recent entry...although
I don't understand Dell's offering well enough to evaluate the extent of the
threat. OTOH operating fundamentals look decent though at 20x eps ex-pension
it's no screaming bargain.
I'm not making a complete bear call on this, just a 'hide & watch, wait & see'
BTW, ROE will get a boost from recent charges to retained earnings but getting
there by lowering book instead of raising returns earns no merit badges IMO.

I'm with you on this, jeffrey bash.

Another interesting aspect for me is the sell point. If a $10 stock with the
potential of quadrupling drops 25% where its then bought (@$7.5) then comes
back up, especially if its quickly, to $10, it's my opinion too many people
say:

1. That's a 33% gain (7.5 to 10.). Annualized maybe well over 100%.

2. Can't get hurt taking a profit.

3. We're going to war - or something. Best to step aside and see what develops.
Don't hold stocks if you don't have to.

4. There's always another day. Stock might drop back to 8.

It's my opinion, that this outlook leads too many people to take small gains
... 2-4 points... and they leave the next 30 points on the table.

Of course, the $10 stock has got to actually get to $40. Such cases are rare.
But they do occur. We've got at least several on this thread that fit your
criteria (down 25% but then up 3-4x). You read little about those moves though
from posters. Which leads me to agree with you that it does sound "as if this
approach is foreign to folks posting here". Or maybe these value investors are
too self-effacing to mention their continued involvement with these performers.

Dale,

The only value manager whose views I recently read is Marty Whitman. His
fundamental sells are:

- price based - if value of the stock rises above his estimated value
- business based - capital impairment, e.g. if company's creditworthiness
decreases to some unacceptable level, if company squanders its cash, if some
unexpected danger (asbestos) emerges.

He also does some portfolio maintenance activity:
- Tax-efficiency rebalancing (e.g. sell one semi-equip and buy another to
capture taxable loss)

Plus he buys debt of sometimes bankrupt companies. He holds it long-term for
reorganization gains.

He did not mention using stops. I have not heard of any other value managers
using stops either, but this does not mean that they don't use them. It is
quite possible, that they just don't publicize their technique. OTOH, most of
them have annual turnover less than 100% and even less than 50%, which seems to
indicate almost no stop use.

I2, revisiting RPM again. What is your opinion on the asbestos issue as regards

I'm still considering my response to you. If we have HAL, SEE, and now HON
settling, and lawmakers will be meeting soon to discuss possible limits to
lawsuits, maybe we'll be seeing more settlements being announced and more
pressure for settlements to be made.

If I recall correctly, we discussed RPM as a buy around 8 (it's now around 11);
I passed then, but now my interest is piqued again. Their stable brands and
steady dividend are attractive. Weren't there lawsuits being filed against RPM
for defective house siding or something at that time? Is that behind them, and
what's your current opinion on RPM as a buy at current price?

In the larger sense, IF asbestos issues are finally being resolved, maybe it's

Paul, I have never forgotten what Peter Lynch said about most of his
performance coming from a few (5-10 bagger) stocks and the rest being "noise";
and that he often held for quite some time before being right. Since I do not
have an unlimited amount of money, nor the desire to follow an unlimited number
of stocks, I wait patiently for one of those few to come along. Don's "THERE IS
ALWAYS ANOTHER TRADE" is a gross overstatement of how often I see potential
5-10 baggers, where I consider that the odds favor it happening. (By the way, I
like making few investment decisions.)

For example, I bought PIHC.OB last Spring at 45 cents when the company was
cleaning up a death-spiral convertible, just before the general market
collapse. I had followed the stock since it was under 20 cents when it had that
critical problem really overhanging it and was in the process of also cleaning
up its business, including a costly misadventure into the Internet. It had
since achieved stability in a reasonably stable business, and was doing this
deal to clean up the only remaining issue. Since I was paying 45 cents for a
company making 15 cents a share (untaxed), with a tolerable (not good) balance
sheet, and some growth prospects as well, it met my criteria. By the way, it
subsequently met Peter Lynch's as well at perhaps a quarter higher, based on a
public 5% ownership filing. It might take me 3 years for this to see $2-3, if
it works out, and I feel no need to follow it closely. (The stock is now 85
cents.)

With the exception of the lows in October when there were a lot of 5 bagger
stocks for a brief time, like ATML and VTSS, I find them rarely, usually in
companies where there has been some change in company management or
fundamentals, or both.

There's still a lot of uncertainty in the asbestos issue ... probably too much
to make an educated, unemotional investment decision based on fact.

RPM's recent restructuring and write-offs appear to be helping its
profitability. That's a positive.

You mentioned the $8/share price. I did buy some RPM at $8.875/share. It's
tough for me to get excited about buying more at the current price. On the
other hand, the 4.6% yield is making it hard for me to sell. I'm getting sick
of seeing the <1% money market yields. And I'm already way overweighted in
money markets/T-bills/cash equivalents.

And then there's the President's plan to eliminate taxes on dividends. That
would be very nice for a stock with a dividend of almost 5% and a record of
regularly increasing dividends.

So on one hand I see RPM's high yield, my low equity exposure, the recently
completed restructuring program, and the potential new dividend tax plan. On
the other hand I see the asbestos. That's just enough confusion to paralyze me!
<gg> I haven't done anything with RPM recently.

Sorry I can't be of more help.

Dale,

Value managers' performance... Overall, any fund's (or personal portfolio's
:-)) performance is snake's nest. It's better not to disturb it. :-(

The problem is distributions + the holding period... :-(((

All the public charts - AFAIK - don't include distributions, except the ones
provided directly by mutual funds themselves. Another issue is the starting
date data - does the service have fund prices from the very beginning. E.g.
CFIMX looks horrible on this:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=&k=c1&t=my&s=cfimx&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l&x=on

while they claim to have 17.5% "average annual total returns" from inception to
12/31/2000, while S&P - according to CFIMX's prospectus had only 16.8%. And
this is when the gap in the chart above was larger than it is now. It seems
Yahoo does not have the data from 1984 when the fund started. But then - do we
care about "performance from inception"? Let's say, we don't. But then CFIMX
beats S&P on both 5 year and 2 year charts. And so on...

Overall, I agree with you. Neither Marty, nor really almost anybody beats S&P
consistently with large enough margin to be worth investing with them. And even
Bill Miller's - he beat S&P in the last 12 years - record is not spectacular:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=&k=c1&t=my&s=lmvtx&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l&x=on

So should we all index? Or try to find next MSFT?

"it hardly fits the description of value investing"

I will take 3 times earnings at my price of 45 cents (PIHC) as a "value
investment" any day. I think balance sheet value is overrated as a primary
indicator of value. I can't tell you how many stocks have been posted on this
thread from screens that are companies with cash and book value, but basically
worthless businesses. When you have value relative to the worth of an operating

the difference is the Met's investment in artwork is not a wasting asset--it
maintains value and appreciates, whereas Intel's plant and equipment
depreciates as the technology becomes obsolescent. moreoever, artwork is unique
and has scarcity value, whereas Intel's products are commodities that become
increasingly plentiful (and less profitable) as time goes by. so if Intel
doesn't throw off FCF from each generation of assets, it is just wasting
capital. in contrast, if the Met bought their paintings at good prices, they
could always sell them later at market peaks for a profit.

because so much capital around the world chases the same assets in technology,
almost nobody (except the monopolists like MSFT) has time to make any money on
assets before they depreciate. thus technology is by and large a terrible
business, once one backs out the Ponzi finance aspects apparent in certain
companies. what is left is a capital-intensive commodity business in a
non-growth industry without a "moat" around the assets, in Buffettspeak.

Larry, in theory the price has nothing to do with something being a value play.
Price is merely an inverse function of the number of shares outstanding. It is
market cap that counts. In practice, however, it is low priced stocks that are
often the cheapest - because they have suffered the impact of institutional
dumping of holdings bought higher. Exhibit A is Atmel (or Vitesse) which,
although it might go under someday, was driven down to a ridiculous price IN

Darfot, I believe that you generalize too much about technology.

I will stack LLTC's track record and 70% non-commodity gross margins up against
any company you can name, in one of the most cyclical industries around. AT 70%
G.M. you can recover CAPEX in one big hurry. Besides the trend in the
semiconductor industry is following that in the electronics products industry
generally to outsource manufacturing, leaving these companies with a
non-capital intensive business focusing on R&D, product development, and
selling.

Of course, technology business generally is cyclical. Who thought it wasn't?
Furthermore, if your investment criterion is a non-cyclical business, you won't
have much to invest in. (Don't mention drugs, which require a couple hundred
million $$$ of investment to - maybe - bring a drug to market.) In my opinion,
if you think that the long term record of technology is that of a non-growth
industry, you are letting the present - resulting from vast overbuilding in the
late 90's because of Y2K and excessive capital raised on Wall Street and put
into marginal projects/companies - blind you to the past, and the future.
Furthermore, there are always some sectors of technology that are doing fine -
like sales of FPD's.

Jeffrey: It just occurred to me after reading your post that one reason why
margins are so high in many tech companies is the primary components of cost,
the R&D and SG&A, come after the margin is calculated. It costs huge to design
a chip or software package or develop and get approval on a new drug, but after
it's designed/approved the cost of running off subsequent units is relatively
modest. This is not an LLTC specific comment, just a general observation that a
big chunck of this difference in margins between tech and non-tech companies
would largely go away when comparing EBIT instead of gross margins.

And your point is?

You see, it is easy to pick 5 year winners in rearview mirror. And 10 year
winners. And 3 year winners. And even 20 year winners. It's just that there is
no guarantee that the results will be repeated going forward. We can go and
dissect the reasons why these funds made over 15% in the last five years - and
why possibly they won't repeat it again.

The easiest one is GOLDX. Yes, if you KNEW that it will make 87% in 2002, you
should have bought a *&^*load of shares and retired rich. But let's assume you
missed just 2002. Then its record is bad. Furthermore, if you invested in 1997
(ah, SIX years ago!), you would have suffered 50% LOSS in the first year. So
its 5 year record is OK, but 6 year record is still lukewarm.

I know - GOLDX is a strawman - it's the easiest one to discard, but overall, I
would not invest in a fund just because it is at the top of the list for X year
return. I didn't invest with Bill Miller either, since I am not sure if his
methodology is repeatable if/when he retires. On the other hand, I am mostly
comfortable with value shops such as DODGX, CFIMX, TAVFX (I will watch whether
Marty Whitman's successor is any good) that have long-long term value investing
experience. I do hold Neuberger Genesis in 401(k) for small-cap value exposure
(and because I am limited to the funds I can buy there).

I may buy growth funds if/when the "growth investing" becomes a dirty word. But
even then I won't buy a trader such as SMCFX (600% turnover!). Thanks, but no
thanks.

Overall, the list like yours is useful for couple things:
- Decide if your current holdings are real dogs - BUT be careful, since they
may have 87% gain the year after you sell them
- Look through the list and see whether there are any funds worth investing in
- if they agree with your philosophy, etc. I will print out and keep the list
for such review.

Good luck

My point is that a well thought out philosophy about stock investing should
provide reliable results over time. I wish I had some 10-year or 20-year "best

Value investing has many appealing dimensions for most of us here. But I was
just wondering if it is, indeed, the "best" way to pick stocks over long
periods of time.

It appears that TAVFX and DODGX did beat the markets on a Yahoo chart dating
back to the mid-1980's, especially if distributions aren't factored in. It
would be interesting to know how many other funds did too, and how they played

Bob, you make a fair point that gross margins ought to be compared after
subtracting R&D. Since the tech company bears the business risk of the
consequences of unproductive R&D, the net of the two better be higher than a
cyclical non-tech company not requiring much R&D. (I think SG&A is an unrelated
issue.)

I tested this using one leading cyclical industrial company, to be fair on
comparing cyclical apples to apples. Caterpillar had gross margins of 21.5%
last quarter and R&D of 3.5%, for a net of 18% (consistent with the prior year,
by the way). Linear Technology had gross margins of 74.2% last quarter and R&D
of 16.2%, for a net of 58.0%. Intel had gross margins of 48.8% last quarter and
R&D of 15.5%, for a net of 33.3%. On the other hand, Atmel had gross
(commodity) margins of 13.8% and R&D of 22.1%, for a net of minus 8.3%. (Merck
had gross margins of 37.3% last quarter and R&D of 5.3%, for a net of 32.0%.)

Note that Merck and Intel had similar net results, significantly better than
Caterpillar. Linear Tech and Atmel show the spread you can have in technology.
The conclusion I draw from this exercise is that there is nothing "wrong" with
investing in technology, provided you stick with companies with proprietary
product margins, and of decent size, such that their market position is
unlikely to change materially.

From:Jurgis Bekepuris
Dale,

I would never claim that value investing is the "best" way to pick stocks. I
believe that "growth" could turn in as good results long term. For example, I
believe that G&K investing - though driven to mania in last bubble - could be
very profitable (here we go back to MSFT, INTC, DELL, etc. again - they all
beat S&P starting from 1980's even after the current bear market by enormous
margins).

I have some considerations and doubts about "growth" investing:

- Large cap growth investing - I still believe we are overpriced in this
category. Even though I hold S&P500 index fund and I think that S&P500 is now
"large growth" index, I would want to see lower valuations before backing up
the truck. I am also not sure how long the globalization and consolidation can
drive large-cap growth. At some point there is only KO and PEP in the whole
world and they can't really grow anymore. How does one figure out these growth
limitations? This is also important to value investors who discuss HD or MCD.

- Small cap growth investing - this is an area where one has to know the
company and its market very well not to make mistakes and to find "next MSFT".
However, if one is correct, the potential profits are enormous. The sector was
blown upwards to sky in the bubble, but it has dropped much more than large cap
growth (because large cap growth is "safer"?), so there probably are
opportunities there. I would like to hear of a good small-cap growth mutual
fund if anyone has suggestions (no >100% turnover traders please). One problem
with a mutual fund in this area is that it would sell "future MSFTs" once they
become midcaps, while a true growth investor should keep them until the
eventual XX or even XXX bagger for 10 years or longer. Any ideas how to deal
with that?

Jurgis, I have loved DODGX for at least 20 years, and routinely recommend it to

-Low turnover
-Low expense ratio
-Medium to larger size companies, value orientation
-Committee style of management, so you know you have continuity, very important
for long term investment in a fund (especially by unsophisticated folks)
-Out of San Francisco, dating back to the early 1900's

I think this fund is straight out of Graham & Dodd and is an ideal choice for

==================================

I will comment on this topic from another perspective:

"Apart from Buffett, it's a legitimate question if many "pure" value investors
have really excelled over time."

It's my understanding that Dr. Graham's investing techniques only promise (if
that is the correct word) reasonable profit for risk assumed. Not that it is
the best or outstanding method by which to invest.

We have professional money managers here whose goal is to beat a bogey or
maximize their performance in some way. Their compensation and the funds they
attract are based on their ability to excel.

On the other hand, it seems to me that individuals with long-term reasonable
financial goals and a consistent savings/investment plan ought to be able to
achieve these goals if they could even get average performance from their
investments. (I don't have the Ibbotson figures, but I believe avg. long-term
performance to be about 10-11% annually (including dividends) over a 25-30 year
period.) I'm saying for most people, average performance is good enough.

(Not that it's so easy for people to even get avg. performance long term -g-.
Dr. Graham has said that extra effort and stretching for larger gains often
leads to diminished, not increased, performance.)

I've noticed you mention a few foreign companies from time to time, and from
what I can tell, the Yahoo profiles look pretty good on most of them. Quite
honestly, NTZ looks especially good. My problem with foreign issues is this is
what I find when I try to research them:

http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=+NATUZZI&CIK=&State=&SIC=&actio
=getcompany

They file their PRs with the SEC and that's all she wrote. No disclosures about
risk factors, hedging instruments, liquidity, pending or potential legal
actions, competition, accounting methods, capital expenditures, etc. Basically
none of the information I would consider critical before putting my money in a
US company is available to me when researching foreign issues. To me it would
be about like buying a used car after viewing its outline under a tarp. Being
the skeptical individual I am, I want to look at the paint, check it for dents,
hear it run, pop the hood and kick the tires.

This isn't NTZ specific, but a situation I always encounter when looking at
foreign issues. If you or anyone else has some helpful hints on how to do good
DD on offshore companies, I'd appreciate the feedback.

It seems to me that if foreign companies want access to US equity markets, they
should be required to provide the same information US companies do when they
want access to US equity markets. I really don't understand why this isn't the
case, but it's the main reason I tend to avoid offshore companies almost
automatically.

I agree with your conclusion providing they don't have to spend all the cash

OT sort of: On the subject of technology and R&D I read a book on tech
investing by Michael Murphy, a fund manager and newsletter writer in the
mid-90's. The central theme was that R&D should be considered like earnings
since a rational company would not invest in R&D unless the outcome had a
favorable expected value. Murphy's theory was that one should look at a
multiple of earnings + R&D instead of PE for tech companies. So a company with
a pile of R&D but skimpy earnings might be undervalued by the former measure
but overvalued by the latter. The R&D componant would capture future prospects.
I found this concept intuitively appealing, but before betting any real money
on it, I put together a spreadsheet based on what was in the book then looked
at what had happened in the 18 months or so since the one in the book had come
out. It wasn't pretty. Revisited it a year later - still not pretty. And this
was well before tech bear that began 2/2000. The conclusion I came to was that
a whole lot of R&D is money down a rat hole, which may partially explain, but
doesn't necessarily justify why the proven winners get bid way up.

Bob, I was not recommending LLTC which I agree "looks fairly priced to a bit on
the high side", but just using it to make a larger point about technology
investing. (XICO has a much better reward/risk, in a much poorer company in the
analog mixed-signal area, now run by a former LLTC guy.)

As far as Murphy goes I never bought that line about adding R&D to earnings.

-For a well-established company a long string of R&D created the current
earnings and is necessary to create future earnings. Thus, unless the level of
R&D to sales has been increased materially, I see no reason to make any
adjustment.

-As far as young development stage companies go, his point has some merit. If
you could identify the ones which won't fail, then using R&D expense to help
anticipate the stream of earnings that will result, is a sensible way to help
establish valuation. However, the first step is to establish the ones that will
succeed, which is beyond the ability of 95% of folks, and certainly Mr. Murphy.

However, I am sympathetic generally to the idea of looking at everything about
a company that might make it a better "value" than it might otherwise seem. It
often isn't just a strong balance sheet. For example, new management with a lot
of options, reasonable salary and a proven track record sometimes turns out to
be the most valuable asset a company has.

<< Stock at new low. At some point this giant will turn around. (I hope.) >>.
You got a better price than I did.
I think DCX is extraordinary cheap and there is a lot of negative sentiment
build in the stock price, so i hope that this position will be profitable for
both of us.

I have used the recent weakness for shopping:
CVX: swapped my mildly profitable position in MRO for CVX. I don't like MRO
weak performance in the upstream business which is why I am interested in oil
stocks to begin with. While production has held reasonably steady with MRO, the
Oil reserves have been going down for many years as evident by the % of
developed oil reserves as a total. This number is now up to 90% from the mid
70% range a few years ago. This negative trend (despite some acquisitions) will
lead to sharply lower production soon, as MRO cannot replace depleting upstream
assets. CVX has a much better upstream record and similar dividend yield which
may lead to better performance LT.

FLEX: I bought 1/2 position in FLEX. This is a contract manufacturer with
strong position in China and good balance sheet. If tech returns, so will FLEX.
I'll wait for my customary 4 weeks and the next quarterly report before I
establish a full position (if at all)

SHR: I established a position in SHR, the German Schering. This is a well
managed mid size pharma company, with a forward PE of about 16.5. Dividend
yield about 3%. I also like Novartis (NVS) and PFE but decided to invest in SHR
because of it has comparable growth, higher dividend yield and as a mid size
player takeover appeal.

AZ: The german insurer Allianz again has become cheap because of weakness of
the German stock market (DAX). I'm in again - at least for a swingtrade.

After watching the behavior of gold and shares for years, I've never been able
to see a 'value' case for it. It's a very emotionally driven market. A skilled
trader may be able to take money from less skilled traders based on playing
technical signals and price action, but developing a reliable, fundamentally

Re URS: I sold some and added back some as stock has come down.

Delayed municipal projects can remain delayed for a long time. Also, URS's
environmental unit (they recently made a big acquisition in this area)and some
of their industrial plant construction business will suffer as
environmental/pollution regulations are made less stringent by current congress
and administration.

Sometimes these construction companies enter into large fixed-price contracts
that years later bite them severely.
And percentage-of-completion accounting I find dangerous too. Two factors that
investors need to be aware of, imo.

OTOH, URS has a good history, is well-diversified and a possible beneficiary of
homeland security spending.

URS is at a multiyear low. I haven't decided if I want to add more to my small
position now though.

Fwiw, I am also considering FSS again. Another company that has seen its

CVX versus MRO
MRO's last quarterly report does not look too bad. MRO stock is outperforming
CVX lately. I still think CVX is a better bet in the oil sector. I also like
BP. I am surprised that rising oil prices and the dividend talk fails to lift
oil stocks.

I havn't followed Bayer very closely but i do notice that the stock is dirt
cheap. However BAY is cheap for a reason. There is this lawsuit lingering and
Cipro's patent, one of BAY biggest drug's with 2B$ revenue, is expiring soon.
In the pipeline i see only Levitra (drug for erectile dysfunction) with some
potential, the rest seems to be a huge dry spell. Watching SGP's and BMY's
demise i know that a pharma without a pipeline is a depleting asset. In the
good old days, there was always a new pill popping up somewhere and if not
another pharma bought the company. This does not happen any more.

That said, i don't think that BAY will go under, however i don't think that
it's necessary that great of an investment (risk adjusted) either.

I've been kicking around some thoughts on VTS today, but haven't convinced
myself it's time to start a position. It looks cheap, but I haven't been
following the sector enough in the past year to stay on top of market
conditions. Seismic is very much a cyclical play, but catching the bottoms and
tops can be fairly profitable. From what I've seen in the past, seismic tends
to trail O&G prices by around 6-9 months.

It looks cheap at 1/2 book, but most of book is multi client library data,
which IMO, is a very questionable asset due to depreciation methods. Library
data is depreciated using the income forecast method, which means any data that
isn't selling isn't getting depreciated either. The downside to income forecast
is data can sit on the shelf for years as an asset before it results in "one
time" charges. The business is also very capital intensive as the data has to
be replaced as it gets too old to sell. Depreciation never seems to quite catch
up with capex, so the usual pattern is increasing debt levels over a period of
time.

The company has about $210 million in debt due this year, but appears to have
financing lined up to replace it. If the consensus is anywhere near being
close, the stock is trading around 11 times forward earnings.

The biggest problem with playing the sector is it tends to move more on
momentum market sentiment, when the perception is oil plays are "hot", than any
real underlying fundamental considerations.

At present, I'm leaning toward the idea that options might be the better way to
play the stock if I decide to take a position. August 10s are around $1.20 and
January 04 10s are around $1.65. That's pretty reasonable for $2 out of the
money calls on a fairly volatile stock 7 or 11 months out. The trick with cheap
options is the premium tends to shrink to almost nothing, regardless of time
value, once they're deeper in the money, to the point exercising the options is
almost the same as trading them. I'll probably be looking at the January
contracts if the market continues to sell off enough to get them around $1.40.

I'm more or less thinking out loud at this point. I need to do some homework
over the weekend to catch up on the sector, but would be interested in any
comments, suggestions or ideas on this one. My current reasoning is to treat
the calls as a hedge to limit absolute dollar exposure to the downside, while
having enough time to let the options work toward a shift in sentiment in O&G
plays. Thoughts anyone?

<<<BHI reported a nice uptick in active rigs this week.>>>

That was one of the things I wanted to look at over the weekend. Rig counts
tend to vary a LOT from week to week, especially this time of year when the
drillers need frozen ground up North in order to move equipment from place to
place. Looking at the monthly numbers for 2002, it appears market conditions
are still pretty soft, at least in North America. A lot of that is the shift
away from the Gulf of Mexico, but the worldwide counts are down quite a bit
from 2001 also.

I did go over GLBL a little bit, and from what I can see so far, I'd tend to
agree with you that it looks awful cheap for what it appears to be. One thing I
ran across which I found interesting is Mellon Bank recently filed 13G's on
both GLBL and VTS. I'm not sure if that's good or bad. From some of things I've
seen Mellon load up on, I'm not sure what their investment strategy is, but it
can't have much to do with turning a profit. They seem to like holding on to
cyclical stocks like grim death, and ride them all the way to the top, then all
the back down again. Oh well.

I'd be kind of curious to get your take on why GLBL is getting punished as hard
as it is considering the kind of numbers they've been turning in for the last

Timba,

For the last 3-4 months a lot of what I've been trying to figure out is how the
current economy, and the near certainty of war, will affect various businesses.
For the most part what I end up looking at winds up being a question of 'to
short, or not to short', rather than 'how about buying some stock'. I think a
lot of folks are picturing the coming war as another 3 day walk in the park
like the last time, but there's a big difference on this round. It's a lot
easier to chase someone home than it is to dig someone out of their house once
they're locked in. Our tactical situation this trip will be crossing a whole
lot of desert before getting close enough to attack fortified positions, manned
by people who have had 12 years to learn how to hate us. Iraq can't win, but
they can make losing expensive for us. I don't like it and I don't approve of
it, but those are the cards we're being dealt.

There's been a lot of speculation about the prospects for increasing production
in Iraq, but what if the idea is to shut down Iraqi production altogether in
order to open up access to the ANWR? or to other known US reserves of oil and
gas currently under protection for environmental reasons? Americans would be
screaming their heads off to tear those areas wide open, and it would be party
time for Texas oil money.

OT - Don, the US military has had 10 years to do nothing but map every single
fortified position in Iraq, down to the millimeter. Anything there that can't
move will be obliterated by precision-guided bunker-busting bombs long before a
single US soldier gets near enough to worry about fortifications. Any troop
concentration in the open will also be hit. If bunkers aren't safe and you
can't stay out in the open, what's left? Remember we enter this campaign with
complete air and sea superiority.

The biggest danger will be mobile artillery and rockets that don't use their
radars long enough to be tracked. But the net effect will be stinging bees
attacking an elephant.

Patton once said that fixed fortifications are a monument to the stupidity of
mankind. Saddam loves his palaces and bunkers; if we go to war (which I am not

So, to restate what I think is your idea here: You're thinking about playing
VTS as a hedge against long term production shut-down in Iraq. If this
occurred, then other sources would need to be brought on line to stabilize the
prices. As this event unfolds, more demand for the type of formation mapping
that VTS provides will mean more demand for VTS services. The perception of
increased revenue for VTS would (most likely) cause an increase in the price of
VTS stock price, which is what you would be making the play in anticipation of.
So it wouldn't necessarily be that VTS would intrinsically be worth more
(because they appear to lose money at what they do), it would be playing more
toward "The Greater Fool Theory"?

I tend to agree with your suspicions that this administration hasn't really
provided their actual reasons for this movement against Iraq, and I also tend
to believe that catastrophe often awaits when the Generals (or others) make
light of the chances of the "enemy" to resist.

However, isn't there another company that can be used for this hedging that
would also provide the margin of safety of current profitability in case the
scenario does not play out with a long term reduction in oil production?

Just in general, oil service stocks are not the best way to play the overall
move in oil and gas prices. The integrated oils are the safest (XOM, RD, etc.)
followed by the exploration companies who benefit from higher prices directly,
then drillers who work for the bigger fish and eventually the oil service crowd
that does stuff for the drillers and EPs.

Lately these companies have not moved up in sync with the oil and gas prices.
Energy is not a simple sector to invest in for all these reasons (subsectors,
commodity price swings, world headlines pushing prices around, etc.) Oil is
tricky now because perceptions about price drops after a war in Iraq are
strong.

That's probably why I haven't talked much about my energy portfolio here even
though it's a quarter of my current holdings. It's hard to make traditional
value calls in the sector.

Don, I think that after an unknown amount of time, relating to how much damage
is done to the oilfields and how antiquated the equipment is, the number one
priority of the administration will be to pump the heck out of the oil fields.
The only way to make this work, both in Iraq and for the world economy, is to
materially improve the lot of the Iraqi people and materially reduce the "tax"
that high energy prices effectively amount to.

Bush wants to get reelected and if the economy is no better in a year, he
won't, in my opinion. The following article is an interesting observation on
the net effects of tax changes at all levels.

Bush is, in my opinion, out of touch with the middle class and is in a perilous
political position. I doubt he even knows that most of the middle class will
get little or nothing out of the dividend tax cut, as their dividend paying
stocks are held in 401-k's or they are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.

Timba,

At least a little bit of what I'm doing in the current discussion is thinking
out loud, and maybe try to get some ideas (second opinions). The two
assumptions I'm more or less working off of for the big picture are: 1. There
will be a war in Iraq. 2. The economy won't recover before Bush is out of
office.

My view (subject to change without notice) is if my assumptions are correct,
then my best bets are likely to come from companies either mostly immune to
weak economic conditions or companies where there might be a silver lining
under current conditions. I'm not 100% sure the oil patch is the best place to
look for bargains, or if it is, if seismic is the best place to look. Opening
ANWR would be seismic's white knight since shooting a bunch of surveys would be
the first step in any exploration activities, plus oil companies tend to invest
more money in future production when commodity prices are high. Dale more or
less covers some of my own misgivings about timing.

I wouldn't quite put seismic in the greater fool theory category though,
because they really do make money when market conditions are good. About the
best analogy I can come up with is they're a lot like the retailers who fight a
holding action 3 quarters out of the year to be in a position to make a killing
at Christmas time. Sort of like that with longer cycles and a certain amount of
unpredictability about when the Holiday season starts. I do think there is some
fundamental value there, but a big part of realizing that value comes from
catching the right part of the cycle. Right now I suppose I'm mostly thinking
of it as something that should be a good candidate for a watch list.

Jeffrey,

Good article and something I think a lot of us have already figured out, at
least along the lines of cutting tax one place usually results in higher taxes
someplace else.

On the flip side I doubt it was ever part of the Bush plan to serve more than
one term. Everything he's done since he's been in office is to tear things up
as fast as possible before the 4 years are up in order to pay off the right
people. Sort of like the peanut butter shortage at the end of the Carter
administration. I suppose it depends on the point of view. He's either a poor
dummy who doesn't know any better, or he knows exactly what he's doing and
every step is part of a grand plan. At a certain point I start wondering if bin
Laden is a terrorist mastermind, or an employee who is well paid when an
"incident" is required.

Almost from day one Bush has been trying to open up ANWR. When the unchecked
energy price manipulation scams didn't turn the trick, the World Trade Center
got hit. When that didn't turn the trick, he started a war with Iraq. The
common thread is a likelihood of shifting public opinion away from
environmental concerns in favor of energy production in the US. I suppose
everything could have "just happened" for "no reason", but I have trouble
putting it together that way.

food, ammo, fuel, shelter, a command structure and a reason to go on fighting.
Use superior force to eliminate most of the above and they crumble unless they

I doubt Hussein's most loyal troops view him in the same light as the Japanese

re: AMEX: IMA @ $16 (Inverness Medical Innnovation)

since your thread is dedicated to value investing, I thought my revelation -
Inverness (AMEX: IMA) nicely fits both value (Price / SAles < 1, Growth - 5
fold over 2 years) and growth..

Homepage : http://www.invernessmedical.com
http://biz.yahoo.com/p/i/ima.html

Industry: Biotech & Biomaterials, mostly Diagnostic kits and nutritional
supplements

Business summary: Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. develops, manufactures
and markets consumer healthcare products, including self-test diagnostic
products for the women's health market and vitamins and nutritional
supplements. To a lesser extent, the Company develops, manufactures and markets
clinical diagnostic products for use by medical professionals. Its existing
self-test products are targeted at the women's health market and include home
pregnancy detection tests and ovulation prediction tests. Inverness also sells
a wide variety of vitamins and nutritional supplements. Its clinical diagnostic
products include test kits used by smaller laboratories, physicians' offices
and other point-of-care sites for the detection of pregnancy and a wide variety
of infectious diseases.

This is a very interesting company IMHO and I will include it in my "absurde
value" portfolio. The company has been growing 5fold by acquisitions and from
endogenous forces from $50m to $260m in annual revenue over the last 2 years.
Valuations are still compelling: Price/Sales at 0.80 and Price/Book at 1.50.
Gross margins are around 50% and further growth is almost assured. Only 14m
shares out and the firm seems to be aiming at preventing dilution whenever
possible. The company had acquired UniPath from Unilever, Wampole, IVC and
other companies in 2002. Right now a move to acquire specialty Osteoporosis
firm OSTX is in the works.

SEC-Edgar info can be found here:
http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CI.. .

Another factor is management. The company's CEO, Ron Zwanziger has already hit
a "home run" twice. He founded MediSys and sold it to Abbot Labs for $800m. He
then founded Inverness and sold its comprehensive diabetes line (an entire
division) and sold it to JNJ for $1.2bn. Now he seems poised to do this again
in pregnancy and other specialty diagnostic arenas like infectuous diseases.

More than 24% of the common stock of Inverness is held by Mr. Zwanziger's
family. But ivy-league investment bankers already joined shareholders' ranks:
Deutsche Bank owns more than 5% as does SSB (Salomon Smith Barney), Morgan
Stanley and Lehman Brothers own smaller percentages:

http://biz.yahoo.com/hd/i/ima.html

A December issue on "Inside WallStreet" of Business Week featured this company.
One fund manager believes Inverness could grow to $1bn in revenues by 2004. The
high Sales per share figure of this company ($18 sales per share), a hard to
find revenue CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) in excess of 200% (revenues)
coupled with nearly 50% gross margins are IMHO indicative of the earnings
potential this firm has, a rare credential these days.

An investor presentation, available on SEC Edgar gives an overview of Inverness
strengths of adressed markets (18% of pregnancy test kits) and its strategy:
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1145460/0001047469020.. .

Readers should note that Inverness was formerly called "Selfcare" in its early
days. CEO Zwanziger's "theme" might be regarded as a "whole product" concept,
introducing convenience and assurance, propped up by vertical related service
and by-product offerings (complements) in formerly highly guarded "science"
dominated fields, with notions of self-centered instead of customer-centered
orientation.

This is definitely a low risk, yet very compelling investment for the midterm
(around 2 years). Since IMA (Inverness) combines the good valuation of an asset
play (when you use DCF) with a sector consolidation and tremendous growth
opportunity, I expect it to outperform not only the market but also its direct
competitors by a wide margin. A takeout speculation for many times then comes
on top of this..

Given the extraordinary opportunity, it's about time someone created a subject
for this gem of a company..

its sustainable ROE is about 15%. No more than $29 if my guess is that its ROE
going forward would be about 20%. (DOV closed down on lower earnings today @
$25.74.) DOV has had ROE at 20% level for 6 of past 10 years, my figures show.

I could try that same formula on RTRSY. Again, very dangerous, esp. since book
value is a small number and ROE is very large -- 40% or more in many of the
past ten years. If I expected RTRSY to see 40% ROE again, then the most I
should be paying to buy RTRSY (It closed today @ $18.14.) would be about $34.
So according to my humble formula RTRSY is a buy! Just looking at the
historical chart, RTRSY has sold over $50 for much of 1996 through until 2002.
So it's not out of the realm of possibility that RTRSY could do at least $34
again.

Of course ball-park formulas based solely on historical numbers are maybe worth
more as conversation pieces than determinants of actual buy points. Also, for
me, as regards DOV, I'm somewhat confident or least hopeful that DOV can
continue its 20% numbers, given a good enough economy. As regards RTRSY,
whenever I've looked at it (always only cursorily though), I've just not got
those kinds of good vibes as regards its performance going forward.

Fwiw, another stock that's come into buying range based on an ROE formula
approach is LBY.

http://my.zacks.com/profile.php3?tick=LBY

Here there are some additional positives as well: Steadily increasing book
value and decent (imo) profit margins. PSR has come down to a relatively low
number as stock price has declined. A couple of "value" funds are owners,
although they seemed to have reduced their positions:

LBY is a glassware/dinnerware company. To me, aren't these companies one step
up from steel producers? Like every country in the world manufactures and tries
to export the stuff? So how can margins and growth be there for LBY?
Acquisitions is a weak way imo. And maybe there's been more debt taken on. (Of
course ROE is enhanced as those additional profits that are brought in by using
debt are placed over the equity denominator.)

I've bought a little. A bet on LBY based on its ROE and profit margins vs. its
seemingly low price. Too many unanswered questions regarding their business
though for me to do more than have an exploratory position.

Paul,

Good analysis! :-) The only thing which I assume differently is that I assume
20% ROE on RTRSY. :-) With 40% ROE assumption it is such an incredible buy that
I don't even think about it as possible sustainable future ROE. :-)

Paul,

I agree with you on this one too. Tough to judge their games with debt (and
they definitely play them: see 12/31/2001 quarter). I would rather not have
debt in the current climate. OTOH, they are reducing debt in the last 4 years,
which is positive. Then the question is: what is the ROE when debt goes to 0?
If it's comparable to their ROIC, the company is not so hot anymore:

BTW, management compensation seems to be reasonable.

I need to do more DD, but thanks for the pointer.

Ah, yeah, CX also looks good on ROE based return, but I discarded it, after
thinking that I don't want to have the risk of Mexico based company. I am
probably totally wrong on this assesment, but cement, debt and Mexico took
their toll. <g>

Jurgis - any other views on LBY?

The REITs I'm looking at have been dropping in price. And I presume some of
this is due to investors anticipating changes in tax laws that might make some
or all dividends non taxable --- as has been discussed here. Importantly I
notice that while housing demand remains strong, demand for commercial
properties has fallen further according to some REIT reports. Rents in several
geographic markets apparently are continuing their downtrend. This has led to
some REITs with pretty generous yields again - IF the dividend can be
sustained.

I might consider this a buying opportunity for those who can wait for the up
cycle. However it's not clear when the down cycle will end or how it will end,
and to me, there are some very attractive buying opportunities elsewhere in the
market.

REITs have provided me with some balance in several portfolios. I've been glad
for the dividends and the small (now smaller!) appreciation I've had over the
past several years. I'm selling down my REITs, eliminating some completely, and
I'll deploy funds elsewhere. I'll take on some added portfolio volatility and
some risk too perhaps, but my opinion is that the rewards now are much better
elsewhere too.
