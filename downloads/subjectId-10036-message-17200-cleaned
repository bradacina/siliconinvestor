Steve, I agree with you that VICL's rise is in tandem with the biotech sector
as a whole. But my other finding is most under-cash no-debt stocks 1 month ago
are in biotech sector. In that sense, there is a reason for the whole sector to
rise, because it is THE most undervalued sector on a discount to cash basis 2-3
month ago. Before that it was telecom sector. I have been rotating my money
in/out of those sectors and so far so good.

Growth is very hard to predict. When a sector is anticipating big growth, money
will flow in and the competition will heat up, erode the pricing power. That
was what happened in telecom industry before crash. I gave up on those
"forcasted growth", rather I buy stocks under cash with no debt, holding some
technology/product that may be hot again in the future, such as PHTN in 98,
SINA a year ago, ALVR 3-6 months ago. They were all under cash value when I
bought.

I seem to share the "avoid" categories with several others.

I avoid those segments where I can't quantify risk exposure due to underwriting
policy: banks, finance companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies.

I limit myself to companies who report using US-GAAP.

I avoid all companies whose ESO expense is "high" (personal valuation threshold
that changes slightly from company to company).

I prefer companies who pay a dividend. "Prefer" in this context means the
non-dividend paying company must be an extra-ordinary value situation.

There are probably others, but I'm jet-lagged today and am a bit fuzzy-headed.

I object not to avoids, but to - IMHO - 20/20 Monday morning quaterbacking and
simplistic point-of-view. There were hundreds of stocks in 2000 that had zero
business and zero business perspectives. Somehow you don't talk about avoiding
and shorting Pets.com and Iselldollarforninetycents.com. Instead you take a
view that such established companies with near monopoly earnings power as
Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco and others are avoids and shorts. I cannot
agree with this view since it implies that high ROE companies are necessarily
overvalued. Some of G&K crowd said that G&Ks are always undervalued. You say
that they are always overvalued. I disagree with both.

You're sorry you did not short in 2000. If you wanted to short G&Ks you should
think you are lucky you did not short them in 1996-1998 - I heard sentiments
similar to yours then too.

What closes could open again though. Most of these stocks are already up quite

Paul, good to know you are ready to pick up some VICL. There are many ways to
"value" a company, over the years I found discount to cash with no debt,
tolerable burn rate are usually the most reliable. Other things like projected
P/E, growth, even ROE are not very reliable, those are cookable if they want.
Enron, WCOM all delivered good "numbers" before bankruptcy, even fooled most of
the analysts and fund managers.

I will stick with my discount to cash approach, the 30% discount to cash stocks
may not be available again. In the late 90's I was only able to find PHTN at
cash around $3 during semi slump 98. It went up and never look back, eventually
got $90 in 18 months. I bought SINA at $1.5 a year ago, it never look back,
trading at $18 now. You already saw those stocks are disappearing (price up
near or above cash), it is the safest to load up if one thinks the current
rally is a little too fast.

RE: VICL or any other "below cash" stocks

I'm trying to understand this philosophy of buying under "cash value".

For example, VICL, I show at 3/31 they had 14,723,000 in cash plus 84,582,000
in short term investments, ok so there they have 4.94 in cash per share, but
they've got current liabilities that were most likely paid with that cash some
time in the quarter (even possibly on 4/1), so I'd back out 10,745,000 or .53
of cash to 4.41 net cash per share.

Since VICL hasn't projected any income stream, I'd also have to assume a cash
burn rate during the quarter as well, right? They've been burning between .55
and 1.44 per quarter during the last 5 quarters, so where's a good price?

I'm not just picking on VICL, I just don't understand the valuations of bio
tech stocks that are not profitable and I'm not familiar with the "below cash"
method of valuation.

Any comments?

 RE: VICL or any other "below cash" stocks 

While I agree that investing in biotechs below cash may represent a safety net
I still think that you need to look at the underlying technology and the chance
of success. With biotechs, the cash will be spend sooner or later and if the
R&D is wasted on unpromising projects the company will be out of business. As
for VICL, I do not like their ?naked DNA technique ; their progress in the
clinic is very slow and it is quite questionable if ever anything will be
marketable. The only silverlining is a HIV project with Merck which uses their
technique as part of the cocktail but i doubt that the small royalties will be
sufficient to sustain VICL if this project will be successful.

FRE: <<. is this now a value stock?>> Hard to say. I'm no expert on GSE's, but
here are some issues off the cuff:
FRE like many lending entities is a bit of a black box with significant
derivative exposures that no outsider will really be able nail down...SO you
have to trust management which the recent firings have brought into question.
Crisis events involving entities with high debt levels tend to roll out in
stages: The event causes greater scrutiny by regulators [We've seen
investigations come from this already, the results of which will be awhile],
journalists [several articles, looking for dirt], shorts, analysts [Most have
been favorable given volume of paper Freddy throws off] Credit agencies [This
is a biggy given big debt levels]. Then there's the regulators: A big risk is a
shift in policy away from the beneficial position the GSE's currently
hold...perhaps moves to level the playing field and diversify exposure so it's
not just Freddy and Fannie...although I doubt such a move would come about
until things settle down. It's a complex picture with a lot of moving parts. So
at this point, I'd say FRE might be an interesting speculative bet, rather than
an undervalued value investment given the level of uncertainty.
Given this uncertainty, one guidepost is technical chart analysis. I'm looking
at around 38 as a prior support area on longer term [10 year] charts.

If Seidman's on a board he can't say anything, but does not want to hold forth

confidence is. The .12% rise in borrowing costs to Freddy figures to cost 400mm
so far. You're a bit high on the market share. A CBO report last year said
Fannie and Freddy had combined market share of 71% with Fannie being about 30%
larger than Freddy. The GSE's disputed that figure with Fannie's top guy saying
the share was more like 27%...they don't want regulators to be concerned about
the concentration of power and risk. While they probably are 'too big to fail'
due to their collective importance to the mortgage and housing market, don't

RE: VICL or any other "below cash" stocks

cpabobp, The below cash stocks definitely have risk. Actually all stocks have
risk. Enron was the best performing S&P500 stock, cover story of Time magazine,
most analysts rated a buy, most funds owned it, before bankruptcy in the
following year.

Paul Senior explained well, we are betting on that the cash allow VICL to
continue to run for couple years, during that time the company will develop
drugs, stock will fluctuate, if any drug get approval or near approval, it will
fly to $20. We have a reasonable chance.

I am also using a "basket" approach to allow margin of safety. In a 10 stock
basket, if one of the below cash play turned out successful (my SINA already
did that, it is a 10 bagger in a year), one bankrupted in a year, 8 others
broke even, I still have a 80% return for my "below cash basket of 10 stocks".

Warren Buffet said people either get the "value approach" on the first time or
never like it all their life. I guess most people on this board are value
investors. But we all have different ways to measure "value". People either
like my way or not. I have been happy with it. Over the years I learned not to

Grommit can answer for himself, but since I have this on half-avoid :-))), I'll
give my take.

Service companies are "bad", because:

a. they are dependent on human capital. If the best people leave, company
crumbles. In reality, this may not be a big issue, since mass exodus is
infrequent, but its ghost is there.

b. presumably it is easier to compete in services than in widgets. This also
may be a fallacy, but presumably entering service area requires less capital
and so is more open, fewer entry barriers.

c. services are less differentiable than widgets. I don't care if CPA A or CPA
B does my taxes. This may be a fallacy too - see example above, won't you
prefer the CPA you know?

d. there are fewer benefits of growth. A large widget maker saves on the
economies of scale, can muscle suppliers and distributors. A large service
organization competes with itself (think realtors) and does not necessarily
gain any benefit (CPA Old Friend Bob vs. HR Block CPA Who Cares).

e. it's easier for investor to learn the quality of widget than the quality of
service.

f. they manufacture something ephemeral instead of something physical - and
some people have problem accepting this as a product.

Most of the above are fallacies, but they have also some grain of truth.

Potential nasty proxy battle with Steel Partners, which owns over 12%. They
want to put it on the market to maximize shareholder value. Veridian was
recently taken over by General Dynamics, although UIC is more of a hardware
player, VNX more of an IT consulting player.
IMHO they are in a good space, being in the defense business, and specifically
a player in the unmanned drone segment.
Yields 2.8%.
Does have an asbestos overhang, obviously a negative.

cpabobp. Sorry for my post to you. Nothing surprising that I'm wrong about a
stock - although I surely feel I'm more wrong than right these days about what
to buy or not buy and what to sell or not sell.

Imo, I just did not show enough courage here in being willing to step up and
buy up. (My problem.)

Although Medicare legislation now in the news has perhaps mightily helped the
stock past couple of days - and I didn't consider this factor - IF I just had
focused not on where the stock had come from, but on earnings projected by the
company in its recent announcement, then at $42 that's a p/e of only 7x ---
making the stock a VERY good buy for both of us when you asked, even at that
"high" price. OTOH, PHS has been in a turnaround situation as to how they bill
and how they operate, and if I recall (I could be wrong again), they have, in
their history, surprised sometimes with lowered earnings projections, i.e.
failing to meet their projections.

Even at today's price, the stock could be a buy. Although even harder for me to
step in now though after its recent run up.

is entitled to their opinion. I did start a small position, but chickened out

Generally, if I get lucky in a position and have a quick run up, I tend to exit

whoever asked that question about "what do you avoid regardless" produced some
great thoughts from the thread. I read those and they sound just like my list
of things that are red flags (Dallas and Florida HQ, yeah, even thats on my
list) but I have to kind of chuckle because every one of them sounds like
something I avoid but then I remember a big winner I owned or own that had that
characteristic.

My biggest winners over the last three years since I've been investing an
institutional portfolio have almost all had some characteristic that makes them
look yucky even to other value investors. Not to say that I don't reject 9 out
of 10 that have those kinds of patterns, maybe 19 out of 20. But if I rejected
them outright I'd have missed most of my biggest winners, which were far from
"clean". In many of these cases the reason they were just stupid cheap was
because they had some characteristics that made even smart value investors stop
after 30 seconds. So be careful generalizing when every situation is a one-off
company at a specific price. There's a price for everything thats
understandable, and a lot of tainted securities are very clearly understandable
though they are tainted, so you apply the appropriate discount. Something like
FRE is simply not understandable to me so I wouldn't even spend the time to
look at it one way or the other.

Buffett says there are no called strikes, which is one way to look at investing
which is certainly a great strategy if you know what the pitch down the center
of the plate looks like. I think I'd say that you've got to look very closely
at every pitch too because sometimes that pitch down the center of the plate
looks way outside until it breaks right over the plate. If you really see the
spin on the ball you can deduce where its going. Did I stretch that metaphor
too far?

my comment was somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but hopefully with some grain of truth
in it. Jurgis's answer was fine.

I think barriers to entry are a factor in my thinking. And J Clarke's comments
are good too. There are no rules here that cannot be overcome. But in looking
just now, I do not have a single service company in my portfolio. So evidently,
I have this rule hard-wired into my mind set.

So perhaps the bar is raised or lowered by all of us based on our personal
preferences and prejudices for each individual piece of data.

Q: Is being a cliche expert a full-time job?
A: Bottom line is I have a full plate 24/7.
Q: Is it hard to keep up with the seemingly endless supply of cliches thatspew
from business?
A: Some days, I don't have the bandwidth. It's like drinking from a fire
hydrant.
Q: So it's difficult?
A: Harder than nailing Jell-O to the wall.
Q: Where do most cliches come from?
A: Stakeholders push the envelope until it's outside the box.
Q: How do you track them once they've been coined?
A: It's like herding cats.
Q: Can you predict whether a phrase is going to become a cliche?
A: Yes. I skate to where the puck's going to be. Because if you aren't the lead
dog, you're not providing a customer-centric proactive solution.
Q: Give us a new buzzword that we'll be hearing ad nauseam.
A: "Enronitis" could be a next-generation player.
Q: Do people understand your role as a cliche expert?
A: No, they can't get their arms around that. But they aren't incented to.
Q: How do people know you're a cliche expert?
A: I walk the walk and talk the talk.
Q: Did incomprehensibility come naturally to you?
A: I wasn't wired that way, but it became mission-critical as I strategically
focused on my go-forward plan.
Q: What did you do to develop this talent?
A: It's not rocket science. It's not brain surgery. When you drill down to the
granular level, it's just basic blocking and tackling.
Q: How do you know if you're successful in your work?
A: At the end of the day, it's all about robust, world-class language
solutions.
Q: How do you stay ahead of others in the buzzword industry?
A: Net-net, my value proposition is based on maximizing synergies and being
first to market with a leveraged, value-added deliverable. That's the
opportunity space on a level playing field.
Q: Does everyone in business eventually devolve into the sort of mindless
drivel you spout?
A: If you walk like a duck and talk like a duck, you're a duck. They all drink
the Kool-Aid.
Q: Do you read "Dilbert" in the newspaper?
A: My knowledge base is deselective of fiber media.
Q: Does that mean "no"?
A: Negative.
Q: DOES THAT MEAN "NO"?
A: Let's take your issues offline.
Q: NO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE MY "ISSUES" OFFLINE.
A: You have a result-driven mind-set that isn't a strategic fit with my game
plan.
Q: How can you live with yourself?
A: I eat my own dog food. My vision is to monetize scalable supply chains.
Q: When are you going to quit this?
A: I may eventually exit the business to pursue other career opportunities.
Q: I hate you.
A: Take it and run with it.

Remember the joke about a good accountant being one who asks, "What number did
you have in mind?"...From today's WSJ, here's the analyst version:
Pasta -- and Meatballs

In the 1990s, analysts learned to value companies using the "Solve for X"
method: Get a price target for the stock and then work backward. Bear Stearns
may have just brought it back.

Last week, Bear Stearns analyst Terry Bivens came out with a big report on
American Italian Pasta, a small NYSE-listed pasta maker.

The report contained, as many do, a discounted-cash-flow model, which estimates
how much free cash flow a company will generate over time. That's used to come
up with a current value for the share price. The model came up with a present
value of $58.49 a share. Not bad, since the stock was trading at $43.65.

But the analysts made a simple, honest -- though massive -- math error,
reported by TheStreet.com's Herb Greenberg. Instead of subtracting capital
expenditure from operating cash flow, the analysts added it. If the capex were
subtracted, the discounted-cash-flow model spits out a drastically different
present value: a little over $19.

So, what to do? One answer, of course, is to cop, red-faced, to the goof and
admit the company's value may be less than you had hoped for. Indeed, Bear
Stearns admitted the mistake and came out with a new model. Funny thing is,
Bear Stearns suddenly thinks American Italian is a lot less risky and will be a
lot more profitable.

In last week's old, erroneous model, the company was forecast to generate $70.4
million in 2003 operating cash flow, defined as net income plus depreciation
and amortization. This week? They use a different definition and, pesto-chango,
it's $82.4 million in cash flow from operations. That boosts the free cash flow
estimate through the next decade.

But that alone wouldn't be good enough to get to an attractive price target.
The analysts also needed to use a different discount rate of 10%, rather than
15% and assume the market would pay a higher multiple in a decade.

The new model says the company isn't worth $58, but $68. What good news that
the analyst had a chance to revisit the issue. In his defense, Bear noted a DCF
model wasn't the primary tool the analyst used to value the company.

Nevertheless, maybe the analyst needs 10 lashes with a wet noodle.

Big cap took the lead yesterday on the upside, there is definitely steady money

I have no opinion, new or old, on their business. As regards the stock, in

as it dropped further. There has been a decent recovery in the stock today.

I look at it as a dance among several groups - people who want to get in
because they believe the window of opportunity is closing on these below cash
plays, people anxious to put funds into the market to catch winners, and people
anxious to move funds from slow moving stocks into either fast moving stocks or

Fabulous up moves from the ones that were below cash value just a few months

situation is quite an anomaly for those who bought as value plays. Not that

declined an average of 6.9% annually for the past 3 years because it had some
mix of stocks and bonds. I expected better things from vanguard.
On a more general note- It seems laughable to me to think that interest rates

very positive development. Probably will cut down a bit on exec. salaries,
which, with a company this small in size, will flow to the bottom line. Also,
hopefully, they will move the company's HQs to Baltimore, where AAI is located,

Dale Baker, et. al., re. ACGL: "a smaller property-casualty insurer and
reinsurer you've never heard of", (ha ha) according to Business Week Special
Report - Summer Investment Guide.

They like the stock.

http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_26/b3839613.htm

"And they're cheap. Arch Capital, which generated revenues of $436 million in
the first quarter of 2003, is now trading at 12 times 2003 earnings."

If some reporter or analyst believes 12x for an insurer is cheap, he or she is
wrong! It's not the p/e that necessarily makes it cheap, and 12x itself isn't
historically cheap either. imo.

Holding my small ACGL position. If ACGL could just get their ROE up. A small
incremental improvement in ROE would translate to substantial earnings (because
book value is substantial). I assume the climate for raising or holding rates
is still good (and as Bus. Wk. (and you) have said, some of these companies
like ACGL don't carry baggage, like asbestos claims), so MAYBE ACGL might
actually be able to increase earnings next year and following.

Paul Senior
(Also have a small position in MRH, mentioned in the Bus.Wk. article. It was a
stock suggested for review by Room222 on Buffettology thread.)

I say buy a package Rather than play just one stock and characterize one stock
as a decent speculation. Which it may well be. (I don't know). It just seems to
me there are so many variables affecting these E&P stocks. (I am a reader of
Big Dog's Boom Boom Room thread now, where they are discussed.)

It's well known that there is, or might be, or could be, or will be, a gas
shortage. I look at the stock prices and see that they are mostly up already,
some up sharply, from lows. So some of that is driven by people like me who
just might be coming late to the party. (I've taken very small positions in
nine of these stocks in the past month or so.)

Unlike most stocks in the sector, PQUE hasn't moved much and is selling below
book value without much debt. However, as you well know, these financial
statistics aren't how these companies are evaluated.
When one sees a stock lagging others in the sector, then of course one is both
attracted (the bargain aspect) and cautious (Is it damaged goods?). My summary
between TMR and PQUE (I hold both stocks, I'm a total newbie as regards my
knowledge of either company or even the sector players let alone the business
aspects) is that TMR is finding gas, PQUE has been unsuccessful. But PQUE might
not be in future. Who knows?

Paul,
I made 50% on TNR short term(in and out) and broke even on PQUE. TMR(if it
drops a bit) would be my choice for re-entry. They have a sizeable field and
have hit two great wells in a row. PQUE is a home run hitter. They drill deep
and costly. If they miss, it's a strike out and game over. TMR is a Rod Carew
type. Consistently batting 400!

I bought a starting position in CHL today.
CHL is the largest mobile phone operator in China. i like the financial metrics
(gross margin, ROE). I can see CHL growing with 10%+ without any stretch of
imagination, with a PE of 11 and 2% dividend I see return in excess of 12% per
year on my investment. Biggest risk is margin erosion due to competition, IMO.

I am waiting to see ACGL's Q2 report and see how they are progressing; their
reinsurance biz is still very young relative to most, so their ability to
generate returns is just developing a track record.

I could sell now for a very nice profit but there may be more here. We'll see.

UHAL - Which I recall being discussed here a long time ago - this strikes me as
genuinely odd: 6/23/03 09:30 ET AMERCO UPPED TO STRONG BUY AT ROTH FOLLOWING
BANKRUPTCY -- NO IMPACT ON STOCKHOLDER EQUITY (UHAL) 4.11 +0.03: Roth upgrades
issue to Strong Buy from Buy. Although co declared bankruptcy on Friday, Roth
says that there is no asset liquidation involved and there will be no impact on
current stockholders' equity. The plan calls for interest rates on the old debt
to be adjusted to current market rates; unsecured debt will become secured debt
and maturities will be extended; and co will have access to $300 mln of new
financing. Roth believes the company is worth significantly more than the
current stock price. At close to 1x firm's fiscal 2004 earnings estimates and
an EBITDA of $21.10 a share in 2004 ($17.10 in 2003), firm believes that the
stock offers significant upside potential. Target $10.
The market believes this, since UHAL has spiked up following a downspike on the
initial bankruptcy news.

CHK has been a horse. It has more proven earnings whereas TMR is more
speculative since they still have to prove out their field. No opinion on MHR.

jeffrey bash. I'd be curious to know if you've come to a decision on any of
these E&P stocks, and any info. you might share about how you reached your
decision and what stock, if any that you've bought.

That's because our investing styles seem to be so different, as we have
discussed in past. Briefly again, it's my opinion that you are one to do VERY
detailed, very thorough research into each particular company you study and, if
I recall correctly, its sector competitors and the environment in which these
companies operate. Your stock holdings are concentrated because you have
confidence in your dd/abilities/conclusions. This is totally opposite from me
who does skimpy research, superficial dd, and often invests in a broad swath of
stocks within a sector. I see, for example, I am currently holding about 25
positions in energy companies, excluding utilities, but including refiners and
large multinational oils.

In past, it seems to me your record - based on posts on this thread (our only
source) - is much better than mine for picking stocks and also for making sell
decisions at appropriate times.

However, in this particular sector - small e&p, I say I have the advantage over
you because the variables to analyze are many and the exogenous factors play a
much greater role in determining stock prices. Especially for the smaller
companies, it's almost a crapshoot, imo, which company will have successful
exploration results. Therefore I say it's likely a package of these stocks will
do better than most individual stocks, because it's more random than
deterministic that a particular stock will perform well.

This just my opinion, and as I've been ..er... less right in my
picks/timing/sells/ compared to you with your concentrated bets, I'd certainly
would like to believe I can best you here, in a complex area where I believe my
package approach provides greater chance for gains -g-. Of course you might
decide there's nothing worth buying in the sector at current price, and that
might prove to be the best decision of all.

Thanks for posting your E&P stocks. I have traded, long term, in most of the
stocks in your list.

Have you ever looked at Credo Pet (cred)? Your comments would be appreciated,
if it is not too much trouble.

Thanks,

Re TMR versus CHK. I'll go out on a limb and predict that TMR 2004 earnings
will be comparable to CHK earnings which makes it my E&P investment of choice.
Here is an optimistic view of TMR prospects (I wouldn't expect average NG of
$5.75 in 2004, $4 per MCF is probably better for planning purposes and even
that has potential downside).

I like CHK as well and considered buying it around $10. If it declined much
from here without too much deterioration in the natural gas outlook I would be
a buyer. As someone stated it depends somewhat on the valuation model. If you
look at Enterprise Value per mcf reserves I estimated CHK as $1.42/ mcfe of
reserves (good) and TMR as $2.36 per mcfe reserves (expensive). As long as TMR
can add reserves with a finding cost of less than $1.42 per mcfe (which it
appears they can with the Biloxi properties) they'll still be fine.

Both of these companies have a lot of debt relative to many of this threads
preferred investments. Both will struggle if natural gas prices decline below
$2.50 per mcfe for an extended period of time. And of course I reserve the
right to be wrong <g>
