Hi Jeffrey,

The potential impact of higher rates is more likely to affect foreign exchange
rates and the cost of US goods over seas than borrowing costs. If the Fed
tightens, 135+ yen to the dollar is almost certain and we're back where we were
last fall. For companies that depend on exports, it's either lower sales or
lower margins. There's also the "flight to safety" effect where money tends to
shift out of stocks and into bonds. My guess would be around a 15% correction
in the Dow and a blood bath in techs.

I tend to get sort of bearish when the Dow is at near record levels and all the
ANALysts are saying a tightening bias by the Fed is no big deal. It's been my
experience that the best way to tell if an ANALyst is lying is you can see
their lips moving.

Regards,

Don

Thanks but I did not jump in myself...yet :-( I watched ANLY too, not expecting
it to do much until later this year, much like the ERP companies, beliving that
these stocks wouldn't do anything until only after it is clear Y2K is not the
earth-ending bogyman it has been made out to be. I think there will be a chance
yet to buy around 14 which is approximate entry point of many ANLY insiders.

A microcap value stock I own of some interest -- SEMI:

-out of favor Electronic Distribution
-selling at about 55% of $1.35 book value
- $280+M sales run rate now - never lost money in this downturn (although $2.9M
extraordinary charge in Q4 98 is fishy-looking)
-growing sales much better than competitors, but margins stink in the industry
-more debt than I like
-reverse splitting 1 for 5 next month, to maintain NASDAQ listing, traditional
adverse effects of which thoroughly discussed on Yahoo thread
-just announced $2 million stock buyback which covers perhaps 25% of the float,
and has positive inference about future performance, since I am sure bank OK
had to be obtained. Buyback could take care of usual
drop on reverse split and stock will at long last be away from penny-stock
land.
-self-serving family mgmt, not very shareholder friendly, and so-so Board, that
gives themselves lots of options VERY BIG minuses. No insider buying.
-takeover target at $2 last year, which fell apart because of weakness at the
acquiring company (REPT)

I am NOT recommending it except to the VERY venturesome. However, in my
opinion, the upside far exceeds the downside at this point, and it certainly
qualifies on price/book and price/sales as a value stock.

gotten in at 14 earlier. However with plentiful insider buying at 13-14 range
and 15-17 range several months prior to that I think the party is just
starting. Even with the recent runup in technology services (have a look at
SYNT for example) ANLY is still trading at a modest PE of 15 and yielding a
dividend of over 3%. For these reasons I was willing to chase the train and
believe a 12 month target of 25 is quite reasonable.

Mike, you're to be congratulated for the listing on your web site. I wish I'd

Just prior to symbol change:
http://www.stocksheet.com/stocksheetind.phtml?x=ANGLY&order=name
Concerned about a shortage, they issued additional shares...news excerpt:
<<Shares in the mining house started firm but fell back during the day, knocked
by gold bullion's fall to a 20-year low and the company's decision to place an
additional 12.6 million shares to avert a potential stock squeeze.

Anglo -- whose interests span gold, diamonds, base metals, coal and industrial
assets -- retreated from a high of 33.40 pounds to end at 31.90, valuing the
firm at 13.0 billion pounds ($20.74 billion).

That should win it a place around No. 21 in the FTSE 100 index, forcing tracker
funds, which account for around 15 percent of the London market, to buy it
heavily.>>
They're performance verses other golds has been stupendous and I suspect that
after this "Sell on the news" reaction and the absorption of the shares, that
there will be a run up into the June 15th listing. At that time, I'll
reevaluate.

I am starting to look at a stock I traded a couple of times prior, thankfully

Perini Construction (PCR)
Trades at ridiculously low P/S, PE, and P/B. Richard Blum (financier and
husband of Dianne Feinstein), owns a large # of shares, I believe at a
substantially higher price than currently quoted.
Problems:
Large debt load (a portion of which is a preferred which is in arrears, I
believe), an industry with very tight margins. Lack of liquidity and
sponsorship.
Became interested having been at a Red Sox game this weekend (the Sox won
10-8!), and travelled through the "big dig", where there is immense road and
infrastructure construction in inner city Boston. Seemed to me to be a business
with relatively high barriers to entry. This is being performed by Perini. This
type of business is higher margin, per my information. Also has recently lined
up new casino construction business in Connecticut. Signed new embassy
construction business worldwide.

I am not familiar with the particulars of Perini, and, there are always
exceptions to any rule-of-thumb (e.g., imo, GM), but as a general principle:

low margins + high debt = bad bet

Also, counter-intuitive as it might seem that the heavy construction industry
would have low barriers to entry, it is an economic truism that a
low-profit-margin industry must of a necessity be one that is highly
competitive -- due either to ease of entry (like retailing), over capacity
(like autos), or both (like apparel).

Florida Rock is expected to continue to ride a wave of new development in state
of Fla. I have done no research besides reading the article but may look
further. And one other thought...I suspect mfrs of aggregates have mostly fixed
costs (aside from fluctuations in raw materials), versus construction companies
which for example, I suspect often have to eat project budget overruns , suffer
penalties for missing benchmark deadlines and such, depending on contract.

Entry barriers or lack there of [Boeing has em, Web merchants generally don't]
Supplier power [Buying from Microsoft]
Customer power [Selling to Walmart]
Substitute products/services [Aluminum for steel, Online broker for full

Industry Rivalry- many factors contribute to this including high exit barriers
Each of these categories has many factors that influence the degree to which
industry profitability is enhanced or eroded.

Mike (My opinions *only*): One of the main barriers for an aggregate co like
Florida Rock is shipping costs. Competitve suppliers can't ship aggregate or
any real heavy, low-cost stuff very far and still remain competitive to local
supplier. It's like Carmike Theaters or early Walmarts in small towns. Once
there's one there, it's tough to justify another and not cost effective to
attack from a distant location. The risk is that the demand shifts....tough to
turn an aggregate plant into a strip mall or warehouse.

FWIW, I did liquidate a REIT position and my CPU position to take a fairly
large position in Case today as an arbitrage play. My reasoning is that the
shareholder vote is a lock, which takes out one of the big uncertainties in
arbitrage situations. It is doubtful that there will be an antitrust case made,
since even combined there are other heavy equipment players just as large (DE,
CAT). Fiat looks like it has the capital to get the deal done. I just think
that Case has much less risk in it than the current 7 point spread indicates. I
was waiting for sub-48, and got my shares at 47 15/16. Especially with interest

Yeah, I invested in WHX because it was free. And I sold it when it wasn't. (My
history on the stock on this thread was a lot more complicated than that, but
that is what I intended to do, and it would have meant a 60% gain in about 6
months). That has nothing to do with Michael Porter. That's Ben Graham. Porter
becomes relevent when you are looking to buy a business, not dead assets. I
don't mean that as a perjorative - I think people who have watched me here know
I play both ends of the barbell. I will buy dead assets when they are extremely
cheap - that's Graham. (Buy dog sh*t for half the going price for dog sh*t)

But I also try to understand "assets" in the form of good businesses you would
want to hold for a while, provided you get the valuation right. This is a
totally different valuation exercise. Porter tells you how to identify such
businesses, so does Buffett. Buffett tells you how to buy them at the right
price, Porter doesn't. I do not believe value investing is Graham or Buffett -
I firmly believe it is both - it requires knowing which is which and applying
the appropriate tools to each.

Hi Bob, "the price of a business underestimates the earnings flows going
forward". Well, I'd generalize by saying value investors focus on the balance
sheet, and Buffett investors maybe focus on the income statement.

People here posting their predictions for their favorite stock's earnings in
'00 or '01 or '02 or maybe even in '99 -- they kind of are ignored or they get
a rasberry (-g-) it seems to me. Actually very few people put out such earnings
projections here. And only a couple of people ever seem to use a DCF model
(although perhaps very successfully). So if you are saying that "value
investors in a going concern" invest this way (business price vs. earnings
flows), then you are either incorrect, there is a definitional issue (people on
the thread are not 'value' investors), or perhaps people won't post or share
their analysis or predictions.

Here's what I am saying. Enhancing learning by broadening one's scope, one's
outlook of the world, studying strategy, etc. -- all great stuff. Does it
enhance an investor's stock market performance? It should-- but does it?
Where's some evidence that this is a profit making activity for potential
investors? Even anecdotal evidence. The professors who teach us strategy -
Porter, Mintzberg, Strickland, Grant, Worley, etc. -- they claim no success (as
far as I can tell) in stock market prowess. Same issue and argument for
Economics and econ. professors -g-.

From caviar to floor mats. Didn't and don't understand how they could maintain

for a value investor is what it's about (or so I said -lol). Ah, how we all
must live with paradox. -g-

Really a lot to like with this company. Very high ROE (how they do it with
these businesses, I can't figure-- and it does weigh on me). Very little long
term debt.
And very long history of increasing dividends. LIKE 36 YEARS of increases.
Sales and earnings and book value increasing every year from my '93 history.
PSR and p/bv similar to previous years. PE at low end of a fairly small (it
seems to me) annual range.

This looks like a stock that one would buy and hold over many years for a very
nice investment. Especially maybe for a child or for a DRIP account (assuming
that that's available). Or potentially as a possible core holding for a
retirement account.

Paul: <<Well, I'd generalize by saying value investors focus on the balance

think the most effective value investors look at not only the balance sheet,
but also the income and cash flow statements, the business model and strategy
[Competitiveness], the earnings estimates [Skeptically], and might even take a
furtive glance at the charts [Behind closed doors<g>]. I see value investing as
a balance of approaches aimed at determining if the market is mispricing assets
and/or earnings flows without relying on or making a precise estimate of future
earnings.
Evaluation of competitive position and strategy comes to play when something is
hit hard due to a dip in earnings...that the investment community prices as an
indication that the business no longer works. The value investor must ask if
this is true...is earning power forever gone, or is there really no change in
competitive dynamics, just a blip due to temporary misfortune.
<<Enhancing learning by broadening one's scope, one's outlook of the world,

EMH adherents claim, and offer presumably irrefutable proof, that virtually all
analysis is a waste of time. I doubt that, but I can't offer definitive proof.
Is Buffet the investment equivalent that Sagans of Monkeys pounding piano's
could compose a symphony? Or an example that qualitative and quantitative
judgement can be honed and can produce superior results? I'm here reading
learning and practicing because I believe the latter, though I can't prove it.
Today, virtually every investor with net access has multiple screeners that can
pull up PE, PS, PB and other quant items, and numerous articles covering how to
mix these in a screen. Thus more and more it's the judgement of qualitative
factors like competitive strategy and the robustness of a business model that
separates the capabilities of investors. I found Porter and other sources to be
helpful and believe I'm more capable for it. To the extent others in our thread
community look at these areas, I think they will be better able to point to
flaws in positive or negative assessments of a business's prospects for
themselves and others in the community.
<<The professors who teach us strategy - Porter, Mintzberg, Strickland, Grant,
Worley, etc. -- they claim no success (as far as I can tell) in stock market

to me. My opinion is that it is not valid and not such a great thing to compare
co. to industry to sector to SP500. Better to compare co. to itself. After all,
any value stock is likely to show better psr, bv numbers compared to the
S&P500.

I don't find HIPC particularly attractive either - based on my screen.
Discussion now on this thread about business strategy and competitive
advantage. HIPC is interesting in that they make ethanol additive for
gasoline-- Calif. (biggest market for etoh in gas) has dropped requirement I
think, so for people here who think about business value, they might
worry/wonder about HIPC viability. Might work out okay though based on
historical price/book value (which is what I think you are saying). Bet is, I
assume, that company will come back. It may. But unless someone has further
info., I think there are better buys out there. JMO, and I've been wrong
many,many times before. Paul Senior

Bob, Ha! Even if we both assumed I knew what I was talking about (a big
assumption for both of us -g-), I doubt I could show you or anybody else what
they were missing (even though I keep thinking I can -g-). I don't think I can
articulate it well enough, and I don't think it can be seen by anyone to whom I
direct my comments. May be one of those things that each of us has to come to
realize on our own.

General comment- not directed to you--- follows:

It's that I find that what works, works. Don't go mucking it up by thinking and
by putting assumptions to it. If it's a value stock, and you are looking for a
value stock-- buy it. Buy it as part of a diversified portfolio. Don't go
anticipating market downdrafts, interest rate hikes. Regardless if it's a
fourth ranked company in its sector, if it's a value stock, buy it if the
buying is good. Don't go assuming the market leader(s) will absolutely crush
it. Don't make assumptions that we're in a new bull market, that internet which
gives information, also gives wisdom. Don't be quick to assume new technology
will kill businesses (like e-tail will smash bricks and mortar businesses). It
always takes longer, if it will happen, than anyone thinks. Don't assume that a
60 or 80 year history of stocks is a long enough history. Keep some powder dry.
Work to achieve your financial goals, not to beat everyone else or to beat the
market. Let time and compounding work for you. Be diversified. In stocks, real
estate. Think you are wealthy and act that way (have patience of a businessman,
know it's a business, there will be good times and bad times). Do what the wise
people who have gone before say to do. Do only that.

ah well, FWIW. Paul

OK, here is a stock that is dog crap selling for less than the going price for
dog crap, Novacare, Inc. (NOV). NovaCare, Inc. is a national leader in physical
rehabilitation and employee services. The company treats patients in
cost-effective outpatient and long-term care settings, and has achieved number
one market shares in long-term care and orthotic and prosthetic rehabilitation.
In addition, NovaCare is the nation's second largest provider of outpatient
physical rehabilitation and occupational health services. Now the numbers:

Per-Share Data
Current price: $2.25
Book Value (mrq) $9.05
Earnings (ttm) -$1.76
Sales (ttm) $29.57
Cash (mrq) $0.24

Valuation Ratios
Price/Book (mrq) 0.21
Price/Earnings N/A
Price/Sales (ttm) 0.07

Income Statements
After-Tax Income (*ttm) $14.3M
Sales (ttm) $1.86B
Profitability
Profit Margin (ttm) 0.8%

Management Effectiveness
Return on Assets (*ttm) -8.14%
Return on Equity (*ttm) -19.24%

Financial Strength
Current Ratio (mrq) 2.54
Long-Term Debt/Equity (mrq) 0.97
Total Cash (mrq) $15.2M

Basically the stock tanked due to the effects of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act
that reduced Medicare reimbursements for physical therapy in nursing homes,
outpatient facilities, and at home care which is most of NOV's business. Since
then management has begun restructuring and has sold off the prosthetics
division to concentrate on core services and to retire debt.

They have also closed operations in long-term care markets that were
detrimental to revenues and earnings and concentrating on those that are
profitable. The following quote from the last 10-Q is also interesting, "''We
are encouraged that the debilitating impact of the BBA on the long- term care
industry has recently begun to attract attention at the Federal government's
administrative and congressional levels,'' said Foster. ''We are actively
working with the long-term care industry and other trade groups to obtain both
regulatory and legislative relief that will ensure that adequate reimbursement
is available to Medicare beneficiaries receiving needed services.'' If this is
true, it will only help the company.

The following link is includes discussion from management about the rest of the
company's services which I believe is positive.

These services have to be provided so I believe that NOV has an opportunity to
be viable. Besides the long term debt obligations what am I missing here?

Looking for input,

I've been mucking around in this area for awhile. Companies with exposure to
PPS are in various stages of distress. Some like VC are on the brink of
bankruptcy. The gov't is becoming aware that the changes have had more impact
than they had anticipated and is very concerned about the level of patient care
is deteriorating...they've issued an advisory to states to watch for this. Soon
one or more big ones are going to go bust...VC is behind in interest in bonds
that are currently trading at default level pricing. The aftermath of one ore
more bankruptcies may catalyze change in the PPS and prompt some bailout
considerations. As Jeff Bash has mentioned, depending on gov't programs isn't
the most marvelous business model. Longer term the aging population increases
demand and polititions that want to get or stay elected work with the players
to fix the system.
Here's a link to a mix of various companies in related category:

Obviously agree. Note that based on what you said, states are advised to watch
out for deteriorating patient care -- not deteriorating company health.
Politicians will not look to themselves for causing patient care problems and
have little interest in the relationship between making money and debt service
and patient care. Don't count on them for logical solutions.

However, I don't totally rule out participation in this poor business.
If lots of weaker ones go bankrupt and provider employees start losing their
jobs and patient care deteriorates, you will have much more horrible sentiment
surrounding all the stocks and maybe some increase in reimbursement levels.
That leaves me with one question -- is there a GM of this industry that will
clearly be left standing that we should start watching? Anyone know?

The industry is working hard to educate the Pols. Regarding the senior citizen
sectors, which has been my primary focus, the 80+ population is increasing @ 3x
the rate of the general population. The cost of capital in this industry is
through the roof. Thus building should trail demand...at least in the sector
serving Medicare. The industry is probably going to ask the Pols what they're
going to tell the members of Tom Brokaw's "Greatest Generation" and the voters
concerned with their well being when the howls of protest over no room at the
old-folks Inn start coming in. Not that their aren't already considerable
complaints. It adds up to a catalyst for change. I suspect we've seen the lows
in those not destined for BK. It'll be interesting to see reaction to the first
big BK announcement...logic would indicate a sell-off, but I think they jump as
market sees more heat on Pols.
<<is there a GM of this industry that will clearly be left standing that we

the financially strongest might tell us whose best positioned to buy assets
cheap when VC and Sun go BK. Of course an external player can't be ruled out.

TwoBear, I don't follow the industry closely enough to have a reliable opinion
on NOV. I do note that it has been in this price range for quite a while and
there has been zero insider buying, an important indicator for me. Selling
their worst performing business may suggest that the strongest long term care
company is the place to look.

Bob, you suggest that the bottom may already have been seen in the survivors.
You might be right. Take a look at the chart on BEV. In that case some BK may

Getting tied up with cabling companies: Belden, General Cable, Cable Design
Technologies

I'll present some information on these three companies: BWC, GCN, and CDT. It
will be an example of how I sometimes look at, and buy, stock in companies
without going through an analysis of business strengths or weaknesses (SWOT
analysis) or an analysis of their business models - or even an analysis of
their basic businesses. Sometimes, for me, the numbers and other "facts" are
compelling enough to allow a purchase to be made.

I have been studying Belden for about 2 weeks. My initial interest was piqued
when I thought that if we are going to have lots of bandwidth, we're all going
to have to be wired. I saw a newspaper headline saying that California was
thinking of spending $12Billion to connect their schools. I started with BWC
because I've studied it once before - they imo are leaders in the cabling
business. But what is the cabling business? Is it copper twist, fibre optics,
idustrial, home, inclusive of connector and ancillary components,
manufacturing, distribution (installation), consulting? The numbers on BWC
looked good. But as I dickered with determining where a good buy price might be
for the stock and what aspect of the 'industry' I was actually buying and what
I should be buying, the stock moved from 19 to 24 during the past 5 or 6 days.
Too pricey now, I think.

I've turned my attention to two other companies. The first is CDT. A reasonable
question for the entire industry might be -- just how many companies are we
talking about, and when will the end be of any possible boom. After all there's
just so much cabling to be done, and (I presume) that's it. There's not a lot
of repeat customers, I assume. The market diminishes drastically. For me, I
step aside from those issues to the insider buying that I see. IMO, the
insiders are telling us that it is not now a problem and that prospects are
bright. In fact, CDT has the most astonishing insider buying pattern I've ever
seen. More than $2M of insider money committed to the company since March. In
the approx. $11-13 range. And by several of the very same people who were
selling millions of dollars of stock in Dec. @$20-24 range. I've never before
seen such a quick reversal by several insiders. (I'm no insider-buying expert
though.) There's other positive information too: CDT has rising sales each year
since '93; pe, psr, p/bv are at lows compared to previous years. Book value is
steadily increasing (although so is long term debt). There's a ROE of about
16-17% on a stated bv of about 8. Stock is at 14, up a point or so Friday: I
think because their earnings, worse than the prior period, did beat analysts
expectations. My guess would be that the stock drops back a bit. I'd say a fair
value right now for the stock might be around 16, although it's traded at or
better than 20 many times since 1996.

General Cable (GCN), another company with strong (imo) insider buying, most of
it at higher prices than the $15 that GCN goes for now. (Yearly trading range
is about $8-32.) Revenue growth seems flat for GCN (and there's only a 3-year
history). But again, psr and p/bv are at lows compared to past years' averages.
The company is selling at 3x book value, and it looks like they are making
35-40% roe. The pe is about 9. They announced they were going to close a
marginal plant, but whoops, business picked up and/or the plant got profitable,
so they rescinded that idea.

I've taken small positions in both these companies.

Not that I'm right to to do it. I've been wrong many times before (such as:
failure to take account of industry trends in the disk drive business). JMO.

James could you give me your insight on this. Gibson Greetings(GIBG) shows on
their 10Q that approximately 35/198 million of short term assets and 30/199
million of long term assets are "deferred income tax". They do not show
significant goodwill but have 6 million quarterly "amortization of deferred
cost and good will" I have been under impression that a deferred income tax was
an asset because of operating loss carry overs which could be used to offset
income taxes.

Obviously this is not so. What is it? Doesn't 65 million seem high for a 320
million a year revenue company? I was interested on how much of their 17 dollar
book value was phony. Company is near 5 year low at 7 3/8 and a recent WSJ
article indicated that an investor group purchased between 6.19 and 9.25 with
"a view to influencing material business decisions" My buy decisions often are
influenced by events which might trigger a change in a company's direction.

useful insights in this area are Co-opetition [First part adds concept of
complementor to Porters 5 forces...a Complementor enhances a company's
profitability...the latter part of the book is probably too micro for investor

Allen, re deferred costs

Deferred costs are liabilities, whether they be for taxes or other items owed.
What's being deferred is the accounting recognition on the income statement for
the obligation. For taxes, the liability is accrued on the balance sheet to
show the difference between the accounting books and the tax books. The tax
books show less taxable income than the accounting books. The amount deferred
is the tax on the difference in taxable income. This is only a timing
difference as the tax will have to be paid eventually. Hence the liability
booked.

Longer term if the cycle turns upward (assuming that the business is cyclical),
how about 16 as a reasonable target? That's about today's stated book value.
Stock's hit its book value every year its been a public company (5 years). But
a dangerous assumption on which to pin hopes since sales were growing and now
look to be decreasing. But... if/when cycle returns (that might be a big

Been member of SI for nearly 3 years, first time on this board. My perception
of what the internet was going to do for Value Investing in regional and
obscure stocks is why I dumped all my [previous] investments 3 years ago and
re-invested only in OTC:BB stocks. So far it's been a smart move. Followed the
market for years using Standard & Poor's O-T-C Unlisted Manual. Internet and
the release of information will unlock much value in the future - IMO.

I have lot's to post in the future. Follow 500 OTC:BB companies daily/weekly
and have research just 1,000's and 1,000's. Yahoo!, FreeRealTime and FreeEdgar
(parties.com), are great!

Somebody at work asked me today if I'd looked at Hyde lately. I think I had two
friends at work in the stock at 4 the second time and two of us sold at six and
one held out for 7 or 8. 21? Wow. I've got three more net-nets that don't look
as good as Mike's Hyde pick or my PSO pick, but two of the three are going to
be 50%+ moves within 6-12 months. I don't know which two. And I'm not going to
post them until I can find some money to buy them for myself. So until then its
a teaser. Sorry. Give me two weeks.

Arrrggh. Mike, I thought you doctors were into first-rule-"Do no harm"-stuff.
Yeeough. That Hyde information hurts!

Well, it was undervalued (imo) when you first mentioned it, and I just have to
believe the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. Don't recall
when I sold, but it was under 8, I think.

Actually, lots of these athletic shoe stocks have done well. Your Nike of
course, and especially KSwiss. I looked last week at Addidas, but info was
sketchy (and now I can't find stock symbol).

Aside: and as I recall, your Timberland was also a good call. I missed that
one; also missed in my evaluation of Nine West. Both look like doubles from the
time they were posted on this thread.

Just throwing out some recent stocks catching my eye:

CKE (CKR) is sitting at about 13 and pennies. Carl's Jr. is the most profitable
burger joint around, but Hardy's is dragging them down. Converting to the Star
Hardy's format is helping, but the conversion will take time. I see some
short-sighted shareholders, and a cheap stock at just about 3X cash flow,
albeit with a good helping of debt. I know they'll pull out of this. Haven't
bought yet (i'd like to see some insider buying)

Adams Golf (ADGO) is sitting at about 3 and has a chunk of cash. It rode a fad
of sorts, but I just bought a Tight Lies so obviously I feel there is value
there. A lot of cash and NO debt. There's a good golf mind there in the CEO.
The new drivers line will probably have a good run. In any case I see minimum
downside short of a takeunder by management.

Maxtor (MXTR) I did buy recently at 5 and pennies. This company is also cash
rich, with minimal debt. Has remained profitable, and management says it
expects to remain profitable. But it's been taken out and shot with the other
DD makers. I know DD are not a good business, but Maxtor's efficiency
statistics and inventory/accounts receivable turns are great. Closely tied to
Dell.

I did recently nibble on Disney due to what I see as huge potential to milk
free cash out of that company once it gets good management.
Paul's Fruit of the Loom (FTL) and Schlotzky's (BUNZ) also tempt me but I'd
take CKE over BUNZ as a restaurant play. Washington Mutual (WM) is a major bank
with a lot of intangible book value that to me seems undervalued if we apply
Graham to the balance sheet. They're infiltrating my neighborhood and taking
business from competitors. Earning 20% on inflated equity. No position yet
myself.

Fresh Del Monte (FDP) looks like it is starting to fly, as is National RV
(NVH). I still maintain Tidewater and Deswell are true blue core value holdings
(I do own both). Homestake Mining (HM) was recently mentioned here and caught
my eye. It and gold both recently made decade-old new lows. It'll be
interesting to see how low they go. Evidently HM is relatively conservatively
financed and a low-cost producer that will be around if gold ever recovers.

Anybody know anything about Autodesk (ADSK)? At historic lows on a ratio basis.
I missed Adobe when it looked like this.

Good investing,
Mike

re: sneaker stocks, a guru among us, and crying over net-nets that tripled
after you sold them

What is it about shoe companies? Mike hit on Hyde, Timberland and Finish Line,
I hit on Penobscot and Nike. To the thread's credit, I don't recall a single
person recommending the value traps - Reebok and Fila. Hopefully others on this
thread also made some money on these.

And Mike doesn't want to toot his own horn on this thread, but I will do it for
him. Go visit www.valuestocks.net and look at the returns he has chalked up so
far this year. He's doing something very right. If he was a mutual fund manager
with this track record, even for such a short time, investors would be lining
up at his door. Whatever you're doing, Mike, just keep doing it.

And as for Hyde, selling Hyde at 6 doesn't bother me. I bought it at 4. Twice.
I sold it at 6 or 6 1/2 twice. Do I wish I had held on and sold today at 21? Of
course I do. But if I have a similar stock would I sell it at 6 again?
Absolutely. I have seen several net-nets become triples and I have seen others
become round-trips (i.e. they go back to 4 - then 3 - then 2). My game is
getting that safe 30-50% gain. After that if somebody makes money on the stock,
God bless them. Hyde had an NAV of what, 7? So 4-6 was the game I was playing
because that game had 50% upside and no risk. 6-21 is somebody else's game. It
doesn't bother me, because if I'm playing this game right I've put the money
into another Hyde at 4.

I am in another one like that now. Lazare Kaplan has net-net valuation of about
$9.50 and I bought it at 7. This one I will hold for a little more than the
net-net value because it has some other attributes, but I could build a case
that those attributes will take the stock to $30. Will I hold out for $30?
Absolutely not. I will start selling this stock at 11-13, scaling out if it
keeps going up (I've got a lot of it). From there to 30 is somebody else's
game, because that is not the reason I bought it.

re: Mike's picks and a few of my own

The same colleague of mine who bought Adobe at the bottom and has held it for a
triple likes Autodesk as well FWIW.

Adams Golf (ADGO - unscramble those letters and this is "A DOG"!) I bought it
for 4 six months ago, and sold for 4 two weeks later. I don't recall what
prompted me to sell, but thank God I did. Now its 3. I do know what prompted me
to buy, and I posted it here. Not one of my better calls in the short term, but
the jury is still out on this one. This company made over a buck a share net
income in its last fiscal year, and its got a balance sheet loaded with cash.
Earnings have disappeared, but they've got a new product line out. You could
wait for the next quarterly report to see how that product line is selling.
Even better, visit some pro shops and see - if this product is selling well,
the stock will be a triple in a year.

Applying Graham to banks can get you in a heap of trouble, though WM may be
attractive on other measures. Tidewater would be in any institutional portfolio
I would start, and I am all over Disney now and would buy it lightly in the mid
20s, poised to make it a major long-term position in the low 20s. I like to see
we're fishing in the same pond, Mike.

Let me throw out a few of my own. Mattel (MAT - 25 1/4) below 27. USEC (USU -
11) below 12. Steelcase (SCS - 16 3/4) below 19. Clayton Homes (CMH - 11 3/8)
below 14. Lazare Kaplan (LKI - 9) below 9. Anchor Gaming (SLOT - 43) below 50.
That's my current buy list.

Jim:
This is definitely a FWIW, but I'd thought I'd throw this in. My step-brother
is a golf pro, formerly repped Snake Eyes (bought by Golf Smith), now reps
Wright Golf (Dr. Gil Morgan highest profile player). Says the market for the
second tier guys now (IMHO Adams is in that category) is very, very, tough.
Knows guys who rep Titleist, Taylor, Callaway, etc., who do very, very, well,
the phone rings constantly.
From what I understand, Adams has a good product, although it does nothing for
me (although the Faldo wedge series is kind of interesting), because I am one
of those tried and true ELY guys. My brother also says that another part of the
problem with Adams is the fact that Faldo seems to have hit a very rough
stretch in his career, which does zilch for marketing the product.
The balance sheet on the company is awesome, however.

Mike:

I don't want to sound like I'm gloating, but I am a little.

I bought Hyde/Sucony at your suggestion at $4.25. I held on and it reached
$20.50!!!!. It began to fall off and I really thought about what this company,
reliably, was worth. There is where my difficulty with the company began.
Earnings did not seem reliable and I could not convince myself that there was
any reliable value in the company, although the earnings estimates looked
tempting. If they missed the estimates, I felt there could be sizable downside
risk and I would be stuck in this stock for a long time a a substantially lower
price, so I sold at $17.50.

Now the stock hits $21.00 on 150,000 shares, and quite naturally I'm kicking
myself. But I keep repeating the old mantra, margin of safety, margin of
safety.

I would also mention to the thread an experience that I had with Jan Bell
Marketing (JBM) which was also suggested here, and I bought when it was first
mentioned at $2 7/8 and still own. As I recall, the stock jumped quickly to
around $7.00 or $8.00, and as usual (I have a buy hold strategy/habit that I
can't seem to kick) I still held on, only to find out when I returned from
vacation last April (?) that the Sams Club contract had been canceled and the
stock careened down to below where I had bought it!!! Though I'm not sure why,
I'm still holding on.

I have been reading this thread and the Buffetology threads for several years
and I enjoy reading your Web site. I haven't been a contributor because I felt
that I had little to contribute when I first began reading. But, I would like
to relate some of my somewhat Grahm/Dodd experiences (Grahm Dodd in the sense
that I bought these stocks, not that I held them forever in the Grahm/Dodd time
frame).

Incidently, I also own WHX at $9.25, which I learned about on this thread, and
am very tempted to buy more at the current price ($6 7/8). I was up 50% or so
on that stock for quite a while, now I'm down 30%. I would be interested in
anyones thoughts on this one.

I will try to be a contributor in the future. I try to utilize two or three
strategies, the origins of which are Grahm/Dodd and steeped in fundamental
analysis: buy and hold good companies at good prices (Buffetology) and deeply
discounted issues, the classic undervalued stocks, selling at 2/3s net working
capital. I also like the arb strategy on some of these buyouts like the CSE
situation (although I haven't yet taken a position in that one). My problem
with case, incidently, is the down side risk in the offhand chance that the
deal falls through. What price will we get out of CSE if that happens???

Anyway, I felt I should thank you Mike and this thread for the helpful
information that has been provided.

James. I have seen the personal attacks in the past couple of months about
whether a poster is a "value investor" or not. I have been a member of SI
longer than you, am more than twice your age and have tried to be a gentlemen
in my posts. I think it is up to individual posters to decide whether or not a
subject fits the criteria of this thread. Your reply on ffp, whether or not
intended,was offensive. I owned and may very well buy back either ffp or ffm. A
link was posted which provide useful info. The stock is definitely a value
play. We have had posts on shorting Amazon, on arbitrage plays, on value with

David,

Please, please contribute. Boy, you have the holding on part down pat. It's not
like Hyde even took that long - just a couple years like Graham said. Congrats.
4.25 - 17.50 is something of which to be very very proud IMO. Especially
because the character of the stock changed. From net net to a company with
prospects. I could see it happening but still adhered to the net net and got
out below 8.

WHX caught my eye again when it hit 10. I held on until it fell to about 8 1/2
and sold out. Lo and behold it hit near 6, and it caught my eye again. Now at
about 7, but IMO there's value there. But there's risk too. Management has
driven the company to bankruptcy before and doesn't look like they're too
afraid to do it again.

JBM I'm surprised you held it this long and did the round trip. That one was
not a very good business, but was selling at a deep discount. I can't say what
I would've done though, since I chickened out way early. Thought I found
greener pastures.

On the CSE situation, I see a very, very low probability that the deal won't
happen. Fiat is NH's majority shareholder and is itching to spend the money.
Case would be plain stupid to reject it. And Deere and Caterpillar are just as
big as the combined entity, so the regulatory stuff should work out. I'll admit
though that the downside would probably be substantial if it is called off. If
the deal is called off, though, it is very likely that New Holland will jump,
so maybe it makes sense to buy and hold New Holland next time it falls to 14 as
a paired play with Case.

SMACK! I respect your thoughts and do relate to them. I only tried to

Network Electronics "NWRK", is engaged in two business segments. They are:

US Bearing Division manufactures "non-catalog", or special, these are high
precision ball bearings. Bearings are used in the manufacture of thrusters,
landing gears, window assemblies and wings. and,

Ordnance Technology Division manufactures pyrotechnic devices sold prime
contractors of ammunition.

Company was near death a few years ago and has turned it's operation around.

The real kicker is 47% of the stock is owned by a Trust that the Probate Court

like how this feels.

David, way to go on Hyde and I for one hope to hear a lot more from you in the
future. Your last post should make any net-net investor think hard. Do you buy
and hold a net-net. I emphatically say no. I take that early gain and cash it
in, thus I will miss triples. But Jan Bell (credit Mike Burry with this one -
it was his pick and a close friend of mine bought it on Mike's work) is where
my strategy wins. My friend cashed in for a 60% gain on my recommendation, then
kicked himself (and me) when the stock doubled. Now he's looking to buy it
again at even lower than his first buy. There are certain stocks I will buy and
hold - first and foremost it has to meet the Buffett criteria - Am I extremely
confident that this company will earn MUCH more 10 years from now than it does
today. In my thinking, net-net investing is a different game, because a net-net
virtually never meets that criteria. I am playing for the easy money - once
they are not a net-net, I have very little interest in owning the business. On
these two examples, though, you win. Your home run in Hyde more than made up
for your round trip of Jan Bell. I would be very interested in what you are
buying today.

Why you don't apply Graham net current assets to banks. Because a bank has
leverage of 90-95%. (5-10% equity to assets) If those assets are just a little
bit off, you're dead. Contrast that with Hyde at 4, with net current assets of
7. If the net current assets turn out to be worth 20% less, so what? You still
have a steal. Bank accounting structure does not lend itself to becoming a
net-net anyway because there are long term liabilities - that's just the nature
of the business. I don't think I've ever seen a bank on a net-net screen. And
if I did, I would be extremely careful.

I was wrong in my assessment because the link which I had not looked at told
