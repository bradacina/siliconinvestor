By dying in 2010, Steinbrenner,the billionaire and long-time New York Yankees
owner's wealth avoids the federal estate tax, likely saving his heirs enough
money to field an entire team of Alex Rodriguezes.
Steinbrenner's death Tuesday came during an unplanned year-long gap in the
estate tax, the first since it was enacted in 1916. Political wrangling has
stalemated efforts in Congress to replace the tax that expired in 2009.
That deprives the government of billions of dollars in annual revenue but
represents an unexpected bonanza for those who inherit wealth.
"If you're super-wealthy, it's a good year to die," said Jack Nuckolls, an
attorney and estate planner with the accounting firm BDO Seidman. "It really
is."
The death of the 80-year-old Steinbrenner, who had been in poor health for
years, highlights a quirky tax situation that has drawn much scrutiny among the
moneyed but little on Main Street. Only those with estates valued at more than
$3.5 million had to pay under the old law.
Without knowing the exact details of Steinbrenner's holdings and estate plan,
it's impossible to say how much money will be saved. But estate planners and
tax experts say it's likely that the estate benefited hugely by the timing of
his death.

Interesting, but these type posts are really off-topic and not within the

I suspect we have a number of wealthy "mature" posters here. What can you say
to them, "Do your family a good deed, and if you're going to die, do it this
year"? lol. Or perhaps it's the possible heirs who are here. What can be said
or done then? Like the recent Law and Order episode, maybe they could
"encourage" the aged one to depart this year, and not next.

How about we just return to stocks? What stocks are you looking at, or buying,

I want to stay in the NG large cap sector. Both XOM and CNX have recent NG

UGI is a good one to own and I may consider buying again if it test back to the

Hi Jurgis

RE: Nokia Corporation (NOK)
Motorola, Inc. Common Stock (NYSE: MOT)

I am hunting for value in both of these companies (I own positions in both).
There was some rumblings that NOK may be interested in all or parts of MOT,
specifically their infrastructure division (The non mobile component). The idea
is to see if they can buy it on the cheap (NOK has plenty of cash) and
consolidate the company with their Siemens AG (SI) JV into some new holding
company. They would need to sell off the cable "smart box" unit as NOK has no
interest in this line of business.

Ichan a large holder of MOT shares will probably demand too high a price for
the non mobile component to make the deal work but if he backs the proposal it
could be a winner for all parties.

Here was a 2009 valuation of the pieces analysis for MOT that Morgan Keegan &
Co. wrote. According to the article, they have MOT valued between $9.00/share
excluding Mobile Devises. The Mobile Devise Division is worth $0-$5.00/share in
2-3 years. This was before the Android smart phone was such a big hit.

At the bottom of page 12 of the report I saw this statement regarding the
industry outlook for 2010.

 <u>"... in 2010 NOK will likely sell about 60-70 million smartphones, RIM
about 40 million, Apple about 30 million, HTC about 10 million, Palm about 7
million..."</u>.

http://www.morgankeegan.com/NR/rdonlyres/274A1280-331D-4340-83B9-77129FFA0787/0
Motorola0909.pdf

Both HTC and MOT are having trouble delivering on their smartphone orders. I
guess this is a good problem to have but industry insiders say that the market
is so fluid that customers will not necessarily come back to buy your phone if
it is not in stock. MOT traded almost 2x it's average volume today.

Frankly I believe NOK to be the better long term value play but MOT seems to be
getting the better buying volume. I am not too sure what to do, but I want to
eventually consolidate my holdings into NOK. If NOK falls on a MOT buy out
offer (or partial company buy out), I will feel better and sell my MOT and put
it into NOK.

Still just sitting on both positions but feel better about my MOT after reading
the Morgan Keegan & Co. valuation paper.

Thanks for the UGI mention, EKS. I believe I'll follow you and sell tomorrow.

The stock has done what I wanted when I bought 5/11/09 -- provide some dividend
income, give me a little safety (peace of mind) as regards business risk, and
not add to my portfolio's volatility on the downside.

At this point with the stock and the stock market, I'm willing to take either a
little more risk somewhere else, and/or go for another utility with a better
dividend yield than UGI's 3.7%.

IMHO, the chance that NOK would buy MOT is so small that it's almost
non-existent. NOK pretty much said that their future is software and MOT would
bring exactly nothing in that area. NOK is not great in software, but MOT is
way worse. Now, the problem is that NOK may not have what it takes to become
great in software and the attempt to bet company's future on becoming a
software house could lead to spectacular failure. However, I am 99.9% sure they
won't change the tune to buy MOT. To say it other way, if NOK decided that they
want to focus on hardware (which they already did almost perfectly), they could
do it without MOT or anyone else's help.

I have no investment interest in MOT, so I have no further opinion about it. :)

Edit: I have very little insight into what Nokia-Siemens Networks might do. It
is run as a separate company and its choices are pretty independent from
Nokia's decisions. They may or may not buy MOT's infrastructure division, I
have no clue about it. IMHO, NOK may want to completely spin off Nokia-Siemens
Networks at some point. Not clear when, since the market probably won't be
excited about NSN.

Hi Madharry -

I really do not look at Funds in general and closed end funds specifically. I
only hold shares in a few that have been mentioned here. I pretty much sold all
my mutual funds in the 90's to focus on specific stocks. I do own shares in
Vanguard (S&P 500 and GNMA).

You might look at some of the new ETF's for the product you have in mind.

Here is a link to a database of closed end funds. You might search your
specific criteria and see what pops up. I use this link to monitor the CEF
Discounts to NAV.

http://www.cefconnect.com/Sorter/FundSorter.aspx

I find that by the time you evaluate all the costs and associated fees you
really end up paying a large premium to own specialty closed end funds or
sector ETF's. Even if you can buy Funds at a Discount to NAV does not mean you
will be able to sell it at or above the NAV.

Congrats on SMTB. I'll look closer. I may have a couple of choices: Play the
spread: SMTB at $3.79 vs. deal value at $4.00 (stock+cash). This all before
tomorrow's open for SMTB (which may move up) and PBCT, which may (likely?)
drop. Also I'll look at PBCT to see if buying SMTB is a decent way to enter a
position in PBCT. If I recall correctly, PBCT is supposed to be a pretty good
bank (if there are/were such things). P/e now doesn't look so good, stock is
down near lows (where I like to buy), stock is below stated bv (per Yahoo), and
PBCT had recently increased its dividend a bit - which seems to be a lot better
than so many other banks.

I note that PBCT announced two bank buyouts. One for cash and at a heck of a
premium to current price. And for SMTB only at a little premium to current
price (and for stock and cash, not just cash). Seems to indicate that maybe
SMTB had become near fully valued - even for a buyer (PBCT) who seems to want
it in a strategic move, not because it's undervalued.
Still, nice pick by you from your first mention.

PBCT
PBCT is also buying LSBX - the spread is better here if you are going to do
that. However, it's an all cash transaction for $21.

Part of the reason for such a high PE with PBCT is that they have a rather
large cash holding (almost 3B or 8/share).
If you subtract the cash from the price and use 6.15/.32 for PE (18.75) its a
little better.

Also PBCT is paying a large(r) dividend because of it's large cash holding.
Note that their dividend is > earnings.

They seem to be a pretty safe place for money in this environment because of
their large amount of cash.
2 concerns I have are lack of earnings growth, and their utilization of their
cash to make purchases at an good value. There should be good values in this
market where some banks got caught in the mortgage crises (PBCT did not).

I will continue to pound the table on GS especially with suit behind it now. I
think the settlement is a great deal for the SEC who did not have a case and
the given GS ability to make money it was worth settling in order to put the
uncertainty behind them. The guys at fast money have been lackluster on GS from
the gitgo except for Scaramouche and Terranova. Now there are several bulls in
the GS camp. Frankly, once the news of the settlement broke I was shocked that
there were sellers at this level. I figure normalized earnings are around $20.
10 times earnings would be $200 which would also be about 1.5 times book + the
value of their funds under management. That to me seems very reasonable for the
best company in an industry that has seen several competitor bite the dust in
the last couple of years. I will be a holder of my GS shares long term. I
bought them at 7.5 times normalize earnings during the suit. Now people can by
it for 7.5 times normalized earnings after the suit as been settled and finra
seems passed but declawed as far as derivatives goes. Doesnt seem like I got
paid for taking the increased risk, but that's the way the cookie crumbles. in

Hi Paul -

Option expiration today off of a week of big gains. I am looking for a good
blow out sell off today, perhaps coming near the daily low in the last hour.
Look for a lot of those stocks closing at the nearest lower strike price so
both Call & Put holders get screwed. I am going to try to do a bit of nibbling
for a swing trade.

We usually get a good rebound the following Monday after an extreme sell off.
Longer term Mr. Market looks weak and I am trying to hedge my recent gains with
in-the-money covered calls or with out right sells.

I am planning on picking up the TPZ fund next week. This fund usually drops a
few days after an extreme market drop. I am raising cash from a few of my NG
holdings that have gains, low yields, or selling near highs to put the proceeds
into TPZ. TPZ if entered at the right price is a good holding bucket that can
be used as a source of funds for new purchases. Their monthly dividend now
yields something near 7%. It's also not as volatile. The key is entering a new
position at a good price point. I have targeted $20.50/share as my initial buy
in point. This will be a new position created in the taxable account. (I have
TPZ in the IRA and it has performed well).

I am tempted to sit on the sidelines but from what I can tell, today's sell
volume is actually quite low (similar to the low volume we had on the run up).
When the dust settles in 30 days (ie next option expiration period), we will
probably be in the same price zone. S&P at 1050 (low) - 1090 (high) . If we
don't break lower than S&P 1050 by October then the recovery will continue
forward slowly and hopefully the market will follow.

The key will be to deploy new funds strategically picking up those value buys
that get sold by investors not patient enough to wait out the recovery. The
long term value propositions that I am looking to build are all in the natural
resource sector somewhat diversified from what I already own. I want very low
PE's with manageable long term debt. I will sacrifice current dividend yield
for growth. I am betting that there will be significant long term capital gains
from asset appreciation due to perceived long term double digit inflation. I
want to own cheap hard assets that generate income and hedge the portfolio from
inflation bleed.

I am a bit concerned with these 10% moves on the S&P higher and then lower all
on low volume w/i 45 days. I would not be too surprised to see an eventual
waterfall sell off back down to S&P 880 (DOW 8,000). I just want to be sure I
have my source of funds bucket full if this buy opportunity presents itself.

I too took some shares of XOM at the close too (@ $57.96/share). I missed
picking up CNX but will try again first part of next week. Volume was low
across the board and the retail sellers continue to throw out their stock for
sale.

Lots of stocks settled near their strike price w/ high open interest (typical
pattern for option expiration). Was not able to pick up my swing trade position
for Monday.

Hope to get into TPZ next week. Fund goes xdividend ($0.125/share) around the
20th. I may not see $20.50 but I bet it trades below $21.00/share.

EGAS showed good volume (2.8x average volume) and at one point traded as high
as $12.85/share. Up over 15% in 5 trading days. This is typical for an under
valued small cap but not typical to see this on a 3% down day. Just have a
small tracking position. As I continue to research it, I really like it. They
own 41% interest in 160 producing NG wells located in North Central Montana
(pg-5- of report:

RE: Gas Natural Inc. (EGAS)

I first learned about EGAS on the Dividend Investing for Retirement thread
based on a post by Steve Felix.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26669131&srchtxt=EGAS

You can check out the discussion there. There is a proposed secondary stock
offer of 2 million shares. This will dilute the outstanding shares (now 6
million shares). You might want to wait until AFTER the secondary is settled. I
suspect it will be done as a private placement. A whole host of very positive
things could occur if the buyer of the secondary (1) takes all 2 million shares
and (2) already is a mid to large player in the NG integration business.

This is all speculation on my part because nothing is really known at this
time. The stock seems like a good value at current prices and could be worth
much more by a potential acquirer.

I own a small tracking position and am watching how the story plays out.

Jurgis, excellent research. I'd be careful w/ BP. I think Exxon & other oil
companies are better values. BP is around $36 vs. high of $80ish. Exxon is $60
vs high of around $100. BP could go bankrupt or at least skip a lot of dividend
pymts. BP already skipped the last dividend payment. BP is being strongarmed by
the pseudo-thugs running our White House. The Democrats are anti-business in
general; and really have it out for big business & big oil in particular. BP is
just the perfect target. It appears the $20 bill fund that BP put up is just a
starting point. There's no cap. The Democrats are trying to spend that $20 bill
as fast as possible so they can ask for more. Great way to get a lot of votes
next election. Between the monies MSFT forked over; then the $500 mill Goldman
Sachs just gave to the SEC; etc... companies don't have to break any laws to
pay a lot of money in fines.

an appendage secondary business. The issue still is that Nokia will get some
benefit from NSN becoming stronger, but if they blow the device business, it
won't matter. NSN alone cannot save Nokia, although it could push Nokia a bit

Hi Paul - This new ETF sounds interesting. Here is the Fact Sheet:
http://etfdb.com/etf/MLPG/fact-sheet/

Re: UBS Launches New Natural Gas MLP ETN (MLPG)

MLPG - E-TRACS Alerian Natural Gas MLP Index Fact Sheet

MLPG Tracks This Index: Alerian Natural Gas MLP Index
Description: The index provides investors with a benchmark for the
infrastructure component of the natural gas industry. Constituents earn the
majority of their cash flow from the transportation, storage, and processing of
natural gas and natural gas liquids.

* Issuer: UBS
* Expense Ratio: 0.85%
* ETFdb Category: Energy Equities
* ETF Home Page: http://www.ibb.ubs.com/mc/etracs_US/alerian_naturalgas.shtml

The investment seeks to replicate, net of expenses, the Alerian Natural Gas MLP
Index. The index is an equal-weighted composite of the 15 largest natural gas
infrastructure Master Limited Partnerships by market capitalization. The index,
whose constituents earn the majority of their cash flow from the
transportation, storage, and processing of natural gas and natural gas liquids,
provides investors with a benchmark for the infrastructure component of the
natural gas industry.

More Juicy Yields

Similar to other MLP products to hit the market, MLPG will likely lure
investors with an attractive current return. According to the issuer web site,
the current annual index yield recently stood around 6.6%. With interest rates
expected to remain near record lows for the foreseeable future and
cash-strapped companies reeling in dividends, investors have begun looking
elsewhere for securities that can offer an attractive current return.

<pre>
Top 10 Constituent weightings

Name Ticker Weight
---------------------------------------------------------------
Copano Energy LLC-Units CPNO 7.00%
Spectra Energy Partners LP SEP 6.87%
Targa Resources Partners LP NGLS 6.80%
Duncan Energy Partners LP DEP 6.80%
Boardwalk Pipeline Partners BWP 6.74%
TC Pipelines LP TCLP 6.74%
ONEOK Partners LP OKS 6.71%
Energy Transfer Partners LP ETP 6.70%
Enterprise Products Partners EPD 6.62%
Regency Energy Partners LP RGNC 6.54%
</pre>

===============================================================

The expense ratio of 0.85% is less than TPZ at 0.95% but I am not too sure if
their holdings are equivalent.

The TPZ yield is a bit higher at 6.9% vs 6.6% for the MLPG ETF.

It appears that TPZ trades more shares and may have better liquidity than MLPG
but this is a new ETF and probably has not been discovered yet.

I was alerted to MLPG from Dale's 50% Gains Investing thread (

MLPG. May be okay for others. Not attractive to me. Reiterating, I'm in
Tortoise (since '08); I'm staying with it, reinvesting distributions, buying
dips.

Lot of interest in MLPs now by income investors, and these start-up etfs try to
capture that now. Seems like mlp etfs pretty much all own the same lp's with
different weightings. This would mean that the lp buying by new lp etfs should
help the value of Tortoise's lp holdings. So I figure I participate as new
people come into mlps through these new mlp funds. Especially as your standard,
usually not-involved with stocks IRA holder, learns he or she can get these in
an IRA without having to worry about k-1 tax forms.

Depending on what purpose it's to serve, I guess buying something like MLPG is
okay. It's 6-7% distribution with I presume maybe a very slow nav appreciation
(and/or possible stability in etf price) -- and for me, I'm not looking to get
more exposure to that now.

From the article:"..."This immediately accretive acquisition provides us with
an excellent opportunity to expand upon our existing market position as one of
the largest wholesale propane suppliers in the northeast," said Mark Borer,

Do you believe that there is a place to hide in the stock market? If there

that are now at highs. Are you sure you've got the right thread? On a different
thread, other people might have a different opinion, i.e. I guess anything with
O'Neil and his methods (buy rising stocks as the rise proves itself).

If you like the business of propane, perhaps utility UGI. It seemed to have got
through '08-'09 debacle with less volatility, perhaps more safety than the
propane lp's. Not as much distribution/dividend yield; Otoh, if the market
falls and if these propane companies fall again with it, UGI might fall less
than others. Thus, as I look at it, UGI's more of a place to hide than the
propane lp's. (There'll be no good place to hide in stocks in a market downturn
though, would be my guess, from what I experienced in the market downturn of
'08-'09.)

ACF. Makes used-car loans to sub-prime.

CACC. Company partners with used-car dealers. Dealers make the sale AND help
verify/ensure customers' ability to make payments. In return for this screening
process, if and as payments are made, CACC shares profits with the dealers.
I've submitted my shares to CACC in response the company's partial stock buy

I read two books during my vacation. Both left a deep impression on me:

Fooled by Randomness by Nissim Taleb. Taleb talks about risk in his book and
how humans constantly underestimate the odds of unlikely (fat tail) events.
Well he seems to make a nice living off from those bets that are not supposed
to pay off. He mentions many misconcecptions and why Wall Street ignores fat
tail risk by definition due to the incentive system (if I make a profit it's
mine, if it blows up it's somebody else problem). he also shows that humans are
not wired to understand probabilities. This is a very valuable book for
investors. interesting link to this subject:

http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/tenprinciples.pdf

"The Big short" by Michael Lewis. A great an easy read - this book is hard to
lay away. It shows how the housing bubble evolved through Wall streets
assistance and stupidity. Not only that but it helped my understand what really
happened. I did not understand that a CDO is a fully synthetic paper (side bet
on mortgages) and they are born with a credit default swap bought by somebody
betting against the underlying mortgages (those risk premiums essentially go to
the owner of the CDO as interest as long as the CDO perform). This kind of
makes somebody wonder why anybody would buy the stuff to begin with, instead of
the real mortgages which were bad enough.

Very colorful written it shows many players that started to short mortgages
(Mike Burry, Cornwall, Eismann, Lipmann etc.) After reading this book and
Talebs, I am pretty sure we will see another blowup of epic proportions whithin
the financial markets, probably worse than the one that is just behind us (or
is it really?). kind of makes me paranoid and that is probably a good thing.

Starting to reduce my portfolio utility holdings. I am a bit concerned about

been addressed - an incentive system that let's folks make bet's that make them
rich if they are lucky and will blow up the institutions and the whole system
if they are wrong.

Things I am looking for:

1) China RE market blows up.
2) Double dip recession
3) Sovereign default fears spread to major economies (Japan, Italy, USA)
4) Inflation
5) All combination of the above

I have been sinking about Talebs suggestion to make whacky bets that are
unlikely to pay of but if they do, the payoff may be huge. it probably would be
OK to buy LT leap deep out of the money puts to protect the portfolio from
steep losses if this can be done cheaply enough or short some stocks that are
vulnerable to black swan events.

Besides that I do what I have been doing since 2008 - lot's of buying and
selling and using the volatility to my advantage. I am also ready to sell off
everything in a New Yorks minute, if I feel that one of the above event is

I watched Taleb Q&A recently on youtube and decided that he's not as loony as
he sounds in his quoted soundbytes. So maybe I'll read his book sometime.

However, I don't think his suggested investment approach (9X% cash, 5-10%
"black swan" hitting deep-out-of-money bets) works for most people or most of
the time. By definition "black swans" are rare and most of them are not easy to
predict. (By the same definition, events on your list are not black swans. ;))
Therefore it is very unlikely that investor will hit the right out-of-money bet
in the right market, in the right direction at the right time. Assuming one
uses 10% cash to cover 10 markets/directions, it would take 10:1 payout just to
break even, 100:1 payout to double your money. Even with options and CDS 100:1
is getting pretty outlandish. Since most years don't have black swan events,
I'd say that this approach would at best break even unless the investor is SO
much better than everyone else and only bets on sure black swans - you see the
irony there? ;)

P.S. China RE market blows up. It has already done this. At least twice. Was it

swans does not work for most individuals but you could potentially buy
portfolio insurance using SPY puts with deep out of the money puts reasonably
cheap if you do it when things are reasonably calm still ( and put premiums
cheap as well).

I also think that Taleb does not bet on Black Swans, his specialty is
probability and his niche are unlikely events. This can be all sorts of things,
not just macro meltdowns.

The Chinese RE has not really blown up yet - it has dipped and the buyers on
dips have been rewarded. The real blow up will be when the buyers on dips blow
up and the Chinese banks with them.

How Nassim Taleb turned the inevitability of disaster into an investment
strategy

From the article:"...In the summer of 1997, Taleb predicted that hedge funds
like Long Term Capital Management were headed for trouble, because they did not
understand this notion of fat tails. Just a year later, L.T.C.M. sold an
extraordinary number of options, because its computer models told it that the
markets ought to be calming down. And what happened? ..."

==================================================================

This was posted on another thread and provides a glimpse into Taleb's thinking.

The way I see it is that the "Black Swan" event has a much bigger impact than
once thought (a fatter potential return based on the expected probability of
the event) due to the effect of 2nd & 3rd derivative products that amplify the
total financial impact of the event.

There is also a possible cascading effect of the total financial impact that
these models can not predict. It's an interesting concept to study but very
difficult to actually trade on.

re BDX - BDX stock is weak based on very weak results from competitor BEC. BEC
is down 20% as I speak and actually worth a look.

I think BDX may be a sell because it's quite likely that they will follow suit.

Re: Siemens AG American Depositary (NYSE: SI) 

Peeled off another 25% of my SI position started 08/12/2009. Company doing well
but could be impacted by a world wide slow down. Looking to book my 21% LT
profit and may re-enter into the stock again on a 10% correction (below
$90.00/share).

Companies that can make it through booking sustained profits in an economically
challenging period, should be well positioned once the economy really begins to
grow. SI is a candidate as one of these companies so owning this at lower
levels could be a profitable core (growth) holding.

countless millions that Niederhoffer had made over the years -- he could not
escape the thought that it might all have been the result of sheer, dumb luck.
/snip/

...Suppose that there were ten thousand investment managers out there, which is
not an outlandish number, and that every year half of them, entirely by chance,
made money and half of them, entirely by chance, lost money. And suppose that
every year the losers were tossed out, and the game replayed with those who
remained. At the end of five years, there would be three hundred and thirteen
people who had made money in every one of those years, and after ten years
there would be nine people who had made money every single year in a row, all
out of pure luck. 

Yeah, ancient random-walk argument against money managers, debunked by Buffett
in his talk "The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville" (
http://www.tilsonfunds.com/superinvestors.html ). For some reason, not one, not
three, but tens (if not hundreds) of Graham students outperformed market for
ages. Yet, we hear this random walk crap again and again. :( Color me sceptical
when Spekulatius claims this to be one of the best books about market. :(

BTW, Taleb's strategy of holding 9x% money in cash/Treasuries and betting the
rest on out of money options is not new either. I've heard that from some
option-trading source ages ago, can't remember where, probably someone here
might remember the source (Cramer? - just a guess to stoke the fire ;)). The
problem with that strategy is that you can't blow up (unless your currency
and/or Treasuries blow up), but you CAN die from thousand paper cuts.

Let's say you'd use this strategy to bet on oil spills. How long would you have
lost money until this year's spill occurred? Would your wins recover your
losses? Not clear.

Obviously a counter example is Mike Burry's bet on subprime mortgage collapse,
but it's kind of a strawman, since apparently he had strong conviction about
the event (it was not unpredictable?) and the options (CDS) were terribly cheap
(mispriced).

And the jury is really out whether this strategy works long term without deep
macro insights, such as Mike Burry's. Assuming that the markets will become
more and more volatile, it might. But if the volatility also increases the
out-of-money option prices, it might be that the volatility increase won't
cover the costs.

It's in some way similar to "Gorilla Game" - the claim that Gorillas were
always underpriced was right until it wasn't. Or looking closer to our own
field, Buffettology huge-moat companies like KO were underpriced (in 1980's,
early 1990's) until they weren't and 10 years of zero returns followed.

It might be that Taleb can avoid overpaying for deep out-of-money options. He
argues that they are (always?) underpriced because people price them using too
low standard deviation distributions, so tracking the distribution needed for
apparent pricing might let him know when not to overpay. Then it would become a
question of discipline to sit out situations where available options are too
expensive.

Jurgis, i don't think you are doing Taleb's thoughts justice. Taleb is not a
random walk guy nor does he believe that all money managers are just
distinguished by luck. He just claims that based on their track record alone ,
it's impossible to tell if a manager is really good or just a lucky monkey.
That's why he evaluates a money manager not based on their track record but on
their methods and the risk they are taking to make those gains.

He does not talk in his book about what he does for a living other than his
firm is set up to bet on unlikely events and will loose a little money most of
the time but get a big payoff every once in a while. I think he does use macro
and probability analysis to make his bet's.

One of his most interesting thoughts is that the most successful traders in the
recent past are very likely to be just monkeys and are very likely to blow up.
the reason being that they have a style that matches the current market
characteristics (which makes them successful for a while) but if this market
changes they will very likely keep doing things the same they have been doing
them in their career and blow up.

FWIW, based on Taleb's ( and snippeds in Lewis book confirm that), I think Bill
Miller has been a just lucky monkey, just to name one prominent example.

First of all, I hate the whole "there's nothing in the market, but traders"
mentality both in the article and apparently in the book. If we are talking
about traders, I'll go one over Taleb and say that ALL traders blow up. Trading
is like gambling. If we are talking about long-term investors, then I disagree.
And IMHO, Bill Miller non-excepting, there has been almost no "blow ups" in
2008-2009. Which leads to...

What is a "blow up"? Most value funds / investments dropped in 2008-2009. Is
that a "blow up"? IMHO, no, most of the value investors are back up over 2007
levels, but perhaps you (and Taleb) don't agree.

A blowup is an event that makes it difficult/impossible to recover from.
LMVTX had such an event, imo:

y;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=

Many investors in the market are likewise. Most of us here recovered, I
suspect. Some folks I know from another message board have done extraordinary
well. The blowup is a concern for traders mostly but value investors can get
into the same situation with a concentrated portfolio or when doing
concentrated bets. So I think that Black Swan events are not just a concern for
traders.

Probably enough discussion on this subject for this thread.

re DGX - I suggest you call Taleb yourself :-). For me, it looks like a decent
bet also the recent slowdown in their business is a bit puzzling. I think that
the same factors are also impacting BEC and COV - two medical stocks I happen
to follow that are basically in the consumables sector and should hence be
fairly resilient. MHS in a somewhat unrelated pharma benefit sector is also
weak.

I really don't know what is going on but I suspect that BDX will be affected
too and may show flat revenue next quarter which no doubt would pressure the
stock.

I think DGX, MHS, COV, BEC all look attractive at this conjuncture but I am a
little afraid that the sellers know some stuff I don't.

At least the fallen angel BAX that I happen to own is strong here.

Hi Paul -

Here is a brief analysis I did on BKH. I convinced myself that even with a high
forward PE, it's still a hold up to $38.50/share.

RE: Black Hills Corporation (BKH)

I am looking at perhaps reducing my position in this utility. The play was a
reversion to the mean (5 year avg) back around to $35/share. My average cost is
around $20.00/share bought in May 2009. The stock is close to a recovery high
at $31.86/share.

The company is still profitable and pays a good dividend now yielding 4.8% down
from 7.2% based on my avg cost (reflects a 64% payout ratio). Their trailing PE
is 14.26 and the forward PE is 16.25 based on the analysts estimates. However,
the analysts have EPS for 2010-2011 falling 7% after reporting a 7% increase in
EPS for FY 2009-2010. After 2011 EPS should move higher again as their new
Colorado unit comes online w/ new revenues helping to pay down the new debt.

The only long term positive for their utility business I see is that their
Colorado utility subsidiary has been approved and they began construction of a
new 200 megawatt twin gas-fired power plant at a cost of about $250 million.
The plants will serve 93,300 new southern Colorado customers. This should
create a new income stream for the utility. However in July 2010 the company
sold $200 million of a 10-year unsecured note at 5.875% to help finance this
new project. Thus creating more LT debt for the company.

To reduce some current LT debt its electric utility subsidiary, Black Hills
Power, in July 2010 sold a 23 percent ownership interest in their Wygen III
power generation facility to the City of Gillette for $62 million. They still
maintain a 52% ownership interest in this facility.

Therefore, I am not too sure if there is too much upside left in BKH shares
(maybe 12% back to $35.00/share) considering their new capital projects and LT
debt obligations. Their utility business may be fairly priced at current
levels.

The wild cards are their three non-regulated subsidiary businesses which
accounted for 13% of their 2009 Revenues but only contribute about 4% to their
EPS:

(NOTE; From 2005-2009 these business have grown their Asset base by 10%(about
2% annualized) and according to their 2009 Annual report represented 28% of
their total company assets)

(1) Black Hills Exploration & Production subsidiary w/ oil and gas reserves
located in the Rocky Mountain region basins including the San Juan Basin of
northwestern New Mexico, the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, and the Piceance
Basin of western Colorado ( http://www.bhep.com/ );

(2) Wyodak Resources Development Corp subsidiary which is their surface coal
mine operation ( http://www.wyodak.com/ );

(3) Enserco Energy subsidiary w/ Oil & NG distribution with operations that
manages 260,000 MMBtu/day of interstate pipeline capacity and firm storage in
excess of 7 Bcf ( http://www.enserco.com/ ).

================================================================
I believe the $NAV/share for these unregulated subsidiary units are still
significantly undervalued based on the recent market purchase of NG assets by
CNX and XOM (ie. Consol Energy buying NG assets from Dominion; XOM buyng NG
assets from XTO Energy) AND the current market valuation (ie. $P/BV) of U.S.
coal reserve assets from MEE, ACI, BTU & CNX (as a sample industry average).

The value in the BKH subsidiary assets are mainly from their oil, coal & ng
"mineral rights" (including proven & unproven reserves). They do own some
"other" capital assets in the form of storage tanks, pipe line(s) and machinery
equipment.

If you just use their reported 2009 BV/share of $27.84*, $7.80/share (28% of
the total) is the reported BV of their non-regulated energy subsidiary
businesses. Their largest subsidiary business is Wyodak Resources Development
Corp, their coal mining business w/ Black Hills Exploration & Production
subsidiary the next biggest.

CONSOL Energy Inc. Common Stock(NYSE: CNX)is probably the most similar company
to the group of BKH non-regulated subsidiary businesses based on the Coal & NG
companies:

Extrapolating the Industry BV for these companies:
<pre>
Company Name P/BV
---------------------------------------
Massey Eng (MEE) 1.6
Arch Coal (ACI) 1.7
Peabody (BTU) 3.1
Consol Energy (CNX) 2.37

Estimated BKH unregulated subsidiaries total $NAV/share value:
low - $7.80/share x 1.60 P/BV = $12.48/share potential value
high - $7.80/share x 2.37 P/BV = $18.49/share potential value
</pre>
Therefore, one could make the argument that their unregulated subsidiaries
should be worth between $12.48/share - $18.49/share.

The market has already priced the company's stated BV of $7.80/share into the
BKH common share price <u>BUT there could be as much as another $6.50/share -
$10.69/share of value not reflected in the BKH common shares</u>.

*(Note: BKH stock only has about $7.80/share [28% of the total BV of $27.84]
priced into their 2009 non-regulated energy Business Group Assets "reported"
value as detailed in their 2009 annual report see pg-5-
http://www.blackhillscorp.com/pdf/09BHCNarrative.pdf )

My BKH price target range is $38.15/share - $42.34/share. I guess I will
continue to hold my shares even if I feel their utility business is now fairly
valued. I put a GTC order in to begin to peel off some shares at $38.50/share.

Although market is somewhat going up, I am still adding to positions. PBEGF and

Since the Euro-panic has passed, IND prefs have moved up. I lightened up on my

Interesting, I thought about COV and MHS as high ROE business but of course it
depends on which numbers you look at. COV for example has about 8B$ in equity
(including intangibles) and generate 1.5B$ in after tax earning from continuing
operations which is not too bad. Most of those earnings go straight into FCF
(little Capex). MHS looks similar with a 20% ROE (including intangibles). This
looks pretty much in line with DGX, so I am not sure what you are looking at.

In any case, as discussed before, I am not a big fan of ROE because if
intangibles are counted in there are multiple ways to get to different equity
nominators, depending on how the cooperate entity was created.

All those stocks are at about 11-12x earnings (including BEC) with high single
digit growth and significant FCF, so i think it's pretty much a wash in terms
of valuation.
