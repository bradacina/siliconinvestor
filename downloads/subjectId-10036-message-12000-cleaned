I have positions in VII, REF and one that is not currently a NetNet any
longer(but was when I bought it)... ARWM.

I think VIAN, CLRS, and CPCL are showing negative earnings on the income
statement. However, VIAN has positive Cash Flow from Operations(CFO), CLRS
looks compelling because I get a NetNet value of approx. $14.80 vs. a current
market price of around $8.00 and I think they can turn things around, and CPCL
just moved into NetNet, and I haven't looked at their information recently
enough to remember what I like about this one(if anything).

Also I just looked at LU, because it has moved so low. However, I get a NetNet
valuation of approx $2.29/share and it is not anywhere near that price now. I
don't see a margin of safety for a stock that apparently is burning cash at an
alarming rate (I get -$2.646 Billion for last year), is facing some sort of SEC
inquiry, and just had their credit downgraded by Moody's.

Why is NPK sitting on $28 cash?

Most are pretty small in the capitalization, and in total very exposed to
e-commerce. Ok for a basket, I suppose, but as a small part of a larger
portfolio, IMO.

The small capitalization limits mutual fund interest, but then that's why they
trade at the valuations seen. Insider sales at a couple. Bad sign when the
insiders execute options at 3 cents and sell at $4-5 when the company has $3+
cash on hand. (VIAN)

I think there are companies with comparable PEs and PBs, yet larger market caps
out there. Not trading below cash though.

NPK recently announced that a big customer(Target Stores, I think)would be
scaling back their purchases from NPK in favor of competitors from overseas. I
don't know how this turn of events will "shake out" for NPK going forward.

When I do my screens for potential NetNets, I don't use a market cap,
institutional ownership or trading volume filter. The fact that the companies
that I posted are mostly very small companies is not by design. To me, it
doesn't matter whether the company is big, small, popular or semi-illiquid.
What matters most for my NetNet portfolio is the margin of safety provided by
buying at a great price. These companies, as you point out, are not for
everybody. Nor is my intent(by posting them to Paul)to advocate that anyone
believe that I know anything about how to pick a good company for investing in.
It's just that we have had some discussions here about Graham's use (when he
was running a type of mutual fund)of the technique of buying a basket of 30 or
40 NetNet-type stocks, and I was offering these as candidates for such a
portfolio.

NetNets are just one of the strategies I use to evaluate which companies I want
to invest/speculate in. I happen to feel that, in the kind of market
environment we're currently experiencing, this evaluation strategy yields more
candidates than it has in many years, so I am currently concentrating my

Well, David, price-to-sales is not part of my evaluative technique....usually.
I guess, in a gross sense it might be, in that if I see a P/S ratio of 100 or
more I probably wouldn't spend any time looking further into the numbers.

My hot-buttons with NetNets are: margin-of-safety and positive cash flow. If
the cash flow is negative, there has to be a very compelling reason for me to
put any money into that company. Like maybe rapidly increasing sales have put a
strain on working capital through increasing receivables and higher inventory
levels. It has to be something very plausible to a highly skeptical guy(me).

COOL has a negative CFO of $24.861 million and a negative FCF of $28.875
million. for the 9 month period covered by the filing. With $40.215 million in
cash and marketable securities, that means they only have about 13 months to
get profitable. Seems like too far to go to me. But my opinion is worth exactly

I did a NetNet valuation on KEM the other day. It has a NetNet value, by my

safety viewpoint, it doesn't provide nearly the same cushion at current levels
as a NetNet would. I like the fact that, for the 6 month period of the filing,
it has nicely positive CFO and FCF.

Thanks for your reply. I came to understand NetNet must be some kind of cash
after debt while profitible screen- though I did not delve far enough in
history to confirm.

On initial inspection, NPK's cash level suggested to me poor management.
Especially if it's been at such a level for a period of time. If management
can't find a manner to invest cash in a way that exceeds cost of capital,
well...

It was an honest question, though the durable nature of their primary line of
business would disqualify them IMO at this point in time.

It might be that some small caps remain small caps over long periods of time
because of managment choices. In some lines of business, that may be an
appropriate choice, but for those I would expect a return in the form of
dividends exceeding treasury yields by some arbitrary risk premium, as there
isn't much chance for capital gain.

At 6% yield, NPK is close to meeting that requirement, and may make a good play
for improved consumer activity in light of lower taxes on the horizon, possibly
lower energy costs and lower interest rates. Your info re TGT is news that
would have to be evaluated in that context. I'd probably compare them to
Salton.

Another parameter I've monitored, is the level of insider ownership and
executive compensation. Some of the companies the scan turned up have insider
ownership of 71% or better. While I like some insider ownership, I've noted in
some cases that with this much control, it's not uncommon for the minority
shareholders to be ignored. Not true in all cases, but a risk.

I appreciate you sharing the results of your scan, but I'm surprised that so
few companies made the bar.

Regarding NPK and their cash levels. They have paid off all of their long term
debt, so their cost of capital is probably minimal, since they can finance
their own working capital requirements.

The Target information is contained in the 8K they filed on 2/6/01.

As far as putting the rest of the cash to work....well they have bought back
some shares, and with this price drop, I suspect they'll buy back more.

One of the things that concerns me as a shareholder of any company is what the
company does with it's cash reserves. If they can't reinvest the money and make
more with it than I can, I'd like to see them send me a dividend. But I have
seen too many companies go out and buy other businesses that turned out be just
terrible wastes of perfectly good capital, so I'm never in any rush to force
them to distribute capital(in the hopes that if they take their time a better
decision will be the result).

For many years US companies have been moving away from dividends as an
acceptable allocation of profits. I may be dreaming, but something is giving me
the impression that they may start reversing that trend. I surely can't point
to any evidence that I can think of, it's just a feeling. Probably something I

OCA turned up when I sifted through the Forbes 200 Best Small Companies list.

I looked for attractive multiples for companies with stable businesses that
aren't going to disappear (this led me to eliminate a couple of one-product
tech stocks, for example).

OCA operates the only nationwide chain of orthodontics centers. This should be
a nice recession-proof business, and compared to other healthcare stocsks, it's
not as sensitive to changes in government-driven health reimbursement policies.

The p/e on TTM is 18. It's a steady non-cyclical grower, with 32% annual
revenue growth in the last 12 mos. Analysts expect about 24% growth in eps in
2001.

It's the cheapness of this multiple in comparison to growth rate, and the
stability of the business, that attract me to the stock.

The present buying opportunity arises because the stock has been beaten down
lately. The company attributes this to reports published by shortsellers.
Apparently shortsellers have focused their criticism on the company's revenue
recognition scheme, which results in a significant asset every quarter for
"unbilled patient receivables." I've looked into it, and I think this isn't a
big deal. The co. is using a slightly aggressive scheme in its accrual
accounting by recognizing revenues a quarter or two earlier than they would if
they were very conservative, but there's otherwise nothing to be excited about.
If you try to adjust eps to what you would get with a much more conservative
accounting scheme, you can just replace the two most recent quarters of revenue
with those a year earlier. This knocks the eps for TTM down by 13% and
correspondingly makes the p/e 15% higher, giving you an adjusted p/e of 20.8
rather than 18. This is still well below the growth rate.

Personal experience suggest mergers destroy mucho shareholder value in some
cases.

I agree with the idea that rushing out to buy something because of cash on hand
would be ill advised. Culture clashes and mergers of equal size represent risk
factors. If a big company takes over a little company, there is far less chance
for value destruction. It's a personal pet peeve that wall street sometimes
sanctions ill advised shotgun weddings.

It's also likely that downturns present the greatest opportunity. So NPK may
find itself positioned to make an offer for another company below book and
accretive to earnings, with patience. If that happened to be managements
strategy, I wouldn't argue with them. It's just unusual for a company to have
that much cash on hand. Might have to back interest income out of earnings to
get a true feeling for the operational performance.

Salton has a bit more debt, after glancing at the profile. But their ROA and
ROE are in a different ballpark, compared to NPK. Leverage can improve
financial performance or become the lead weight around one's neck in rough
seas.

I would prefer to see a return to dividends- despite the positioning of
sharebuy backs as a more tax efficient mechanism to distribute earnings.
Dividends discourage shorts, and provide an increasing yeild as the company
grows, for the longer term stockholder. One of these days I may be able to tame
my trading instincts enough to qualify as one of those. <g>

My impression of NPK is that it is one of a few stocks that value investors are
always coming across, but which never seem to make value investors any money. I
say "my impression" because it's just my guess. If someone actually could or
did buy at lows and sell near highs of its tight trading range or just was
satisfied with the dividend, then I guess it would be a satisfactory
investment. Still, my opinion is that NPK has mostly - even since '73 when it
was in Intelligent Investor, if I recall - been a tough one to make money in.
Kind of like Genesee Beer which value investors were always finding and

I won't do that. I am going to assume that the rate of return on money invested
will be the same as the ROI if that money were employed in any other way. The
only time I'd consider backing it out would be if they did, in fact, adopt a
rigorous dividend program.

What are your thoughts on "book value" as traditionally computed? I think it is
a virtually useless number. That is, if it arrived at by simply dividing
accumulated retained

re Book Value;

I agree with the 'modern' idea that book value understates intellectual assets,
including management skill. Goodwill has burned me in the past. For some
sectors, mature old economy stocks, book value gets a passing glance. If it's a
vulture style investment, I may study the 10k/q to better understand what the
true assets and debt structure are.

I usually work from a discounted earnings flow model. Cash on serves as a
cushion in some sectors, but I keep in mind things like burn rate, and
management choices that can impair cash.

One other thought on book value. In some sectors, ie Oil and Gas, asset write
downs have resulted in fine companies with a negative book values. One has to
consider if the asset is permanently impaired when looking at such write downs,
as it's not common for the assets to be written up when conditions improve.

If I may probe a bit here....Would you share with me how you do this?
Specifically: how far do you project, 5 years?;

Well, I usually use very simple short hand to scan stocks for those I want to
research further. I find that being able to weed out the 10 I'm not interested
in leaves more time to follow the one that seems to have the most potential.

Depending on the sector, I usually look for a PE ranging between 10-15 based on
the run rate of the most recent quarters results. I have to double check that
earnings aren't seasonal. PE's are relative depending on sector; a mature
growth stock won't get the same forward PE as a tech.

Based on Net Present Value, earnings more than 10 years out aren't worth much
today, so I usually think in terms of 10 years. While PEs have notable
shortfalls, it does make a good starting point.

Now resource based companies like oil and gas actually publish the Discounted
Net Present Value of their reserves, which makes it nice to figure their
'value'. As long as their production rate is decent, you can compare this
number to their market cap. I believe these stocks have approached if not
exceeded their fair value in most cases. Other companies are more difficult.
And negative earnings are really challenging. <g>

 How do you arrive at a meaningful rate of earnings growth?(i.e Is it based on
the average revenue/earnings growth for the last 5 years or something else?);

I don't place too much emphasis on growth, as many of the stocks are cyclical,
and earnings may peak higher than previous cycles but don't grow in the manner
associated with some tech stocks. I haven't quite adopted the PE should equal
the growth rate model. It doesn't feel right.

 What rate do you use for discounting,(Cost of capital, Cost of capital plus
inflation, T-bill, or some other?)

If I were to set up a spreadsheet, I would insert the next best available
return, which is probably CD's yielding 6%. More sophisticated investors can
earn much more than this, but it's the rate I'd use to discount.

As you might suspect from my questions, I have looked at this issue and have
slapped together various approaches, but am always looking to refine the
finished product, so any input you would care to share is appreciated.

Earnings flow is just one parameter, but an important one.
The discounted earnings flow is more of a mental paradigm. Earnings are
important, but so is debt levels, management ability, and macro trends.

One problem with looking at discounted earnings is the ultimate conclusion that
most if not all stocks are over valued. <g> Those that aren't get disqualifed
for other reasons, ie unsustainable debt load, too small market cap, unclear
business.

I learned the hard way that it's hard to invest rationally in an irrational
market. That's when I adopted a slightly different approach. For example, I
limit the percentage of my portfolio exposed to small caps because of the
impact of mutual funds on stock movements.

I've also been developing an approach based on 'out of favor' sectors and
sector rotation. Below is a portion of a post I made last fall on this topic.
I've since adjusted it to include re-investment risk. I trade more than I
should, which in a range bound market helps but kills my performance when
trends set in.

The link below has a section, Rich Man Poor Man that I need to post on my
forehead<g>

http://www.dowtheoryletters.com/DTLOL.nsf/htmlmedia/body_rich_man__poor_man.htm

---

My theory is there are three significant types of risks in equity investing.
Market Risk, Sector Risk and Company Execution Risk.

Market Risk in my paradigm loosely means a rising tide lifts all boats and it's
opposite.

Sector Risk is the potential of investing in the 'wrong' sector even though the
Market is rising and the companies are performing well. Like buying a cyclical
stock based on a low PE at the cycle peak. Buy the Semi Equip sector at the
wrong part of the cycle, and it don't matter that the DJI or S&P gain 25%/year.

Company Risk is the idea that even in a Good Market, and the Right Sector, a
company can mess up execution so badly that they underperform.

My philosophy is to minimize Company Risk by diversifying over three-five
companies within a sector, to minimize Sector Risk by focusing on Sectors
already out of favor and minimize Market Risk by dollar cost averaging, or
legging into positions over time while maintaining a healthy cash balance.

So, anyway, what kind of ratios did you find when you used this formula and
what investing conclusions did they lead you to?....And do you see any
implications if FCF as described above were used? 

I manually performed comparisons on a group of Forest and Paper Product
companies. BCC, WLL, WY, MEA, LFB and IP. I left GP out because of the huge
pending merger with Fort James. IP was just there for comparison, not a serious
candidate because they are a part of an index and subject to passive indexing
distortion.

I subtracted current liabilities from current assets to get a number to subract
from debt, before adding debt to market cap, so it was slightly different than
the scan I proposed.

<pre>
Co Price Earning/EVA Market valuation
BCC 26 1/2 96.68M/3.37B -> 36.8
WLL 33 327/5236 -> 16
WY 43 769/13175 -> 17
MEA 27 246/4104 -> 16.2
IP 33 1/4 1025/26293 -> 25.65
LFB 13 43.4/1098 -> 25.29
</pre>

The last number is actually inverted, to make the ratio result approximate a
PE. So the number is roughly EVA/earnings. Earnings were the current run rate
annualized, a risky assumption in cyclicals.

What I found, using earnings rather than cash flow, was that BCC seemed
overvalued compared to it's peers. I presumed this was due to a higher degree
of exposure to office products than the others. Even within a single sector,
there might be trouble comparing apples and oranges.

WLL seemed to be the best value, with WY taking second. About a week later, WLL
gained 25% after WY made a tender offer. WY's offer came in higher than what I
though WLL was worth based on this analysis. Apparently such a simplistic way
of looking at the companies ignored hidden values that the industry insiders
percieved. WLL is still trying to remain indpendent, albeit at a much higher
share price than when I did the analysis.

LFB is a micro following and less likely to be a candidate for mutual fund
buying. There are other members in the sector that I follow, but these were
ommitted during this effort.

I found the concept of using a ratio of EVA and Earnings to provide better
quality information than the traditional PE, which ignores debt leverage. Free
Cash flow would improve this, as it would turn up companies that are generating
substantial cash despite goodwill or other non cash charges. These companies
have greater prospects, IMO, if they deploy that cash flow effectively.

In an Ideal World, I'd run both EVA/EBITDA and EVA/Earnings, then study the
companies that had the most intriguing results. It's quite likely that this
would identify particular groups, say REITs or companies with substantial
depletion for EVA/EBITDA, and a different subset for Earnings.

I would expect the results of the proposed FCF/EVA scan to provide very small
numbers, ie .012, where the smaller the number the greater the potential value.

I have a number of my NetNets that are coming up with negative EVA as their
cash is larger than their market cap plus debt.

Do you think using an "absolute value of" the FCF/EVA would be appropriate? In
other words, just disregard whether the answer is positive or negative, and
just compare to zero and to others in the industry.

I want to keep apples to apples, so I don't want to derive a formula for these
special situations that wouldn't apply to them all.

Negative EVA? <g> Well, I wouldn't use the absolute value. I'd put these in a
class by themselves, and then try to understand why the market was so unwilling
to put a premium on the companies earnings abilities. On the face of it, a
negative ratio would suggest true value.

[EDIT- negative EVA implies trading below net cash, so NPK wouldn't be negative
as the price per share exceeds cash on hand. One place I've seen this is places
like biotech, where earnings are negative and burn rate is important. Negative
earnings over a negative EVA- do the negatives cancel out? <g> Other example
might be DVIN, an out of favor internet capitalization firm (don't know quite
how to describe it, pointed out by M Burke as trading below cash with no debt]

NPK might be negative. I was thinking about this particular one again. I asked
myself, if I could choose between a CD yielding 6% and NPK yielding 6%, which
would I choose? The large ratio of cash to share value makes it look more like
a CD than most stocks. But I think I'd choose the CD, as it seems safer (better
'risk adjusted' return?) NPK could burn their cash fighting a decline in
margins as their sales drop. Since you've seen indication of this with the TGT
announcement, and I read also Walmart is doing the same thing, it's quite
likely the company will be hurt quite badly by oversees competition. So a
negative ratio for NPK might not be enough to compell a buy of the stock after
looking at the macros.

I noticied Merrill Lynch reports EVA/EBITDA on stocks they follow, but doesn't
offer a way to screen on the numbers. The EVA/EBITDA for N (Inco, up nicely
today for some reason) was between 3-4. Seems kind of low. Would like to
compare it to EVA/Earnings, but I haven't done the calculations yet.

I happened on to a TEV/EBITDA in the Merril report on IP, any idea what it
means? A memory surfaced that EVA stands for Enterprise Value Added, so
EVA/Earnings might be a misnomer.

Regarding VIAN- I still nick them for heavy insider sales despite the stock
representing almost pure cash, no premium for the business. I suspect insiders
are monetizing a concept while they have a chance. That is a heavy negative for
management quality if true. Raping the shareholders for personal gain isn't
ethical, IMHO.

RichDadPoorDad talks about the difference between a qualified investor and a
sophisticated investor. In his opinion, the smart guys are the ones creating
the paper that you and I buy. We are taking the risk, while management uses our
money to see if they can make a go of it. I understand this, and play the game
anyway. But for management to be pulling money out of the game in VIAN's style,
_before_ they've proven themselves as a public company, well... I guess they
proved themselves before the IPO- right? And the IPO is just an opportunity for
them to reap their just rewards.

In the next post, I'll share some work I did today on IP vs some foreign,
underfollowed Pulp and Paper concerns.

DSET also has some insider sales, but they didn't seem to be sourced from the
excersize of options at pennies per share. CYSV had some appeal, heavy insider
ownership but trading near cash with a small loss in the most recent quarter.
Of the stocks I looked at, they would be the most likely to get bought, after
further investigation. For example, is there a lockup expiration pending? How
much did the current shareholders invest to obtain their healthy portions of
the company?

Paper & Pulp Companies- comparison of International vs Domestic

This is an attempt to determine the relative valuation of a group of

RE. <<Do you have a stock screener that can scan for cash flow?>>

Try the free Netscreen tool at marketguide.com

It has built-in screening variables and user-defined variables as well.

One of the former is the ratio of price to cash flow. You can define price /
(price to cash flow) to give you cash flow per share. Multiply that by shares
outstanding if you want cash flow in dollars.

I've used this tool to screen for net-net stocks too, defining the variables I

True sounds good to me. I know they use the term 'net debt', which is simpler

As to the TEV being higher; in my post on the paper companies, I try to
calculate TEV for a couple other stocks to compare to the reported TEV for IP
despite knowing for sure what TEV is.

The TEV I'm calculating uses EBITDA rather than final earnings as a proxy for
cash flow.

I'm not quite in agreement with looking only at EBITDA, I think final earnings
also need to be considered. I'd use EBITDA to find companies with high cash
flow but low reported earnings only. This would give certain sectors exposure
that might be overlooked. Otherwise, ignoring non cash costs of business is

Re: Sealed Air
Paul, like a previous poster I have bought next to nothing over the last month.
I can't get excited about anything. I may feel obligated if we get some more
rate cuts. Since my last post, I kept adding to the Sealed Air bringing my cost
down to $32. I cut my exposure to insurers SAFC at $31 (my cost $20) and MONY
at $47 (I had the $23 IPO) and to the homebuilders Ryland at $41 (my cost $16)
and Pulte at $43 (my cost $16). These gains were all taxable. I took some tax
losses in JCP, PBY and IFF, but I'm still long.

I sold two-thirds of my $4.50 SKO at around $7 (non-taxable account). I sold my
$38 BAC at $48 when I heard their bad loans might be from the California
utilities... not just from economic cyclicality (again a non-taxable gain).

I've added mostly energy companies... two refiners on a P/E basis in the 8 to
10 range... Tosco at $33 (currently $42) and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock at $30
(currently $35)... I added Conoco on a PE basis as well at $26 (currently
$28)... and TXU Corp on a PE basis at $36.

I stepped up my investments in the asbestos plays when Buffett sprinkled his
holy water in the area [credit another poster for this characterization] last
fall adding to USG, OI and CCK. I have turned the OI into the black after
initially buying in the mid 20s, but I'm still down substantially on the other
2 (like 30 to 40 percent). I'll add more USG if I can get Buffett's price (mid
teens).

I made I think an interesting investment in E-Trade Group at $7 (currently
$13). The company was approaching book value, is doubling its accounts
annually, had a large short position, and is clearly one of the top 3 discount
brokers. The company is second only to Schwab in international presence. Its
market cap was around $2 billion... I don't think it has much debt... and I
figured surely some foreign bank would want it at some point for at least $4
billion.

I had previously bought OfficeMax at $8 on a price-to-sales basis. After the
Barrons article I brought my cost down to $2.50 (currently $3.75). The sales
per share is around $45 with no debt. The book is around $9. The CEO says he
won't sell for less than $20.

I turned around my $20 Champion Enterprises position by loading up at $3
(currently $6). Book is around $9; sales per share around $40.

I began a position in Cemex (CX) at $19 (currently $21). I think the company
has a great track record. It has a fair amount of debt but the PE is under 6.
It is the number 2 cement manufacturer worldwide, second to Holderbank. It has
at least doubled EBITDA over the last five years.

I bought Harte Hanks at $22. I don't like their "penny shopper" publication
business because I don't understand it. Their direct & interactive marketing
business is well thought of, though. Their earnings of around $1.30 is almost
all free-cash-flow.

Check my facts, please, before using them. I do this from recall which in my
case is not very good.

Since it is Buffet, however, one must assume that there are possibly other
reasons that he may have put money into such a company. If I had to guess, it
is an arbitrage play against the merger with Ford, there is a buy-out offer (of
$10.50/share, I think..see the 8K) which offers a floor. Depending on where he
bought it, that might be a nice return in a short period with the safety of
Ford to protect the investment and a possibility of a higher counter-offer from

I ran the same scan, leaving out the Tax Rate, and putting in a Market Cap >
100 Mill, and got only four; CEGE CINR EDGW IDTC. 500 Mill would qualify only
CEGE and IDTC.

CEGE has $23 share cash and trades at $18. No Debt and profitable. Must have
had a secondary offering or raised financing recently. M Burke has mentioned
CEGE in the past, but I haven't owned it recently so I don't know much about
the current status.

IDTC has $33 share cash, trading at $22. Reported earnings mrq were $22. I
really have to wonder if yahoo's data is messed up on this one- did they
realize a $22 gain on asset sales recently? Know of the stock, but haven't
followed it recently.

I don't think the TaxRate is a good qualifier. It would exclude corps that
understand how to use credits or cyclicals that carry forward losses, but are
now profitable.

[EDIT- IDTC]

Revenue was $276.6 million, up 4 percent sequentially. Excluding the impact of
$20 million in non-recurring wholesale carrier revenue recorded in the first
quarter of 2000, revenues were 8 percent higher than during the same quarter a
year ago.

Net loss was $22.3 million, or 58 cents a share, as compared to a net income of
$1.1 million, or 3 cents a share, in last year's first quarter. The shortfall
was narrower than a net loss of $55.4 million, or $1.43 per share, in the
fourth quarter of 2000. First Call did not have a consensus estimate for the
company.

Including non-operating income and one-time items, net income for the quarter
was $869.6 million, or $22.53 per diluted share. One-time items included $666.4
million related to the sale of Net2Phone (Nasdaq: NTOP) shares to AT&T (NYSE:
T), $250.8 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit with Tycom Ltd, and a
loss of $25.3 million related to the sale of Terra Networks shares.

"In these chaotic times in the telecommunications industry, IDT will prove its
mettle and its ability to execute its plans,'' said CEO Howard Jonas in a
release. "As our competitors are falling by the wayside, we recorded record
quarterly revenues, and took great strides this quarter in our journey back to
profitability.''

IDT said it has over $1.2 billion in cash and a "razor-sharp focus on

Regarding CLHB....I come up with a negative NetNet valuation of -$1.67/share.
Are you at all familiar with the management of this company? Here's why I ask.

Their current liabilities are running about twice current assets: Current Net
Assets are about $45.83M and their current liabilities are about $92.46M. The
Long Term debt is not that high at about $18.13M. They are CFO and FCF
positive, so if they capitalized about $50M of the Current Liabilities, they
might be able to work through this problem.

The questions are:"Is management astute enough to do this?"(For, if they are,
why are they in this position now?) and is there a process available to
them?(credit facility, and/or stock offering). If I were a competitor of
theirs, I'd seriously consider coming in and buying them for their market cap
plus net debt.

But without good management, they could just be forced into bankruptcy instead.

Further thoughts on CLHB....I just went back and read "Management's Discussion"
for the most recently filed 10Q. It seems that I was right about the amount
needing to be capitalized($50M), because that is the amount of bonds that are
coming due in May, 2001. Management says that they believe they can get
approved another group of bonds or notes because their income position has
improved. The notes coming due are at 12 1/2% and CLHB is net CFO and FCF
positive with that level of debt service, so I would think they'd be OK with it
again. If they can refinance(which isn't a certainty is a tightening credit
environment), I might be tempted to get some CLHB myself.

Even so, I have not rejected it outright. I have taken a wait and see attitude.

There are many different forms of analysis for return. We talked about a Buffet

I am very well versed in technical analysis(probably even more so than
fundamental analysis) and use several techniques for investing using Moving

My thrust on this thread since the markets have declined in price should not be

play because if you count the goodwill as worthless, then you also have to
remove the amortization of that goodwill from the income statement.

I believe in some instances,goodwill & the amortization therefrom, masks the
underlying earnings power.
I often question the value of goodwill, nothing wrong with that, but it comes
down to...what would you give for a business earning X ? There are a whole lot
of busineses earning nice money with negative net worths or moutains of
goodwill.

CLHBs book value has decreased a lot over the years, much of that due to
amortization of goodwill. Insiders have a history of buying over the years and
the safety Kleen fisaco is really helping them.

There comes a time in a value investors life when owning piece of junk assets
in businesses that cant earn a decent return gets old.

Off topic, ROSD which I mentioned here is up nicely. My fear kept me from
really loading up when it fell to 25 cents, but I own a chunk at 60 cents
average from a few months ago. Its back to $1 and still cheap.

If it has a nagative net worth, then it simply makes it an even bigger EARNINGS
play because if you count the goodwill as worthless, then you also have to
remove the amortization of that goodwill from the income statement.

First, I don't calculate net worth by using the traditional retained earnings
divided by number of shares formula. Retained earnings is a fictitious number
as far as I'm concerned, you can't get it back in a liquidation.

Second, when I calculate FCF I adjust for all none cash amounts, and I said in
a previous post that CLHB is FCF positive, so I don't think we disagree there.

Third, it doesn't matter how profitable they appear to be now, if they can't
re-fund that $50M by the time it comes due in May, they will be forced into
defaulting and/or bankruptcy. I don't know what their prospects for re-funding
are, so I decide to wait and see.

Fourth, negative net worth is always an issue for a value investor. Otherwise,
where's the value? While I agree that a positive net revenue stream has value,
as far as I'm concerned that value first has to be applied to getting out of
the hole before having any net positive affect for me as a shareholder.

Fifth, my valuation technique for NetNet does not totally disregard the value
of goodwill, or any other asset deemed to be a long term asset. I do, however,
discount all LT assets by 50%. Graham suggested PPE be discounted by 85%, in
this kind of market, the value of Goodwill has taken drops of up to 95% for
many endeavors. I am a bit more liberal than Graham because I believe most PPE
is already significantly discounted through the accumulated depreciation and
50% will probably get me close enough to an approximation.

I believe in some instances,goodwill & the amortization therefrom, masks the
underlying earnings power.

The problem is always one of trying to accurately quantify "real" earnings. The
key, I believe, lies in the analysis of the cash flow. The question for me was:
"How much money could a company take off the table and not hurt the business?"
For me, the answer is Free Cash Flow.

I haven't yet looked at ROSD.

Timba, rjm2. Interesting insights on clhb, thanks. I talked to cfo about bond
refinance and received no insight on the long time interval being taken. That
was my main concern and I have only 1000 shares bought to force me to follow
progress. If refi is successful I think the company is in right sector with
opportunity to exploit miserable performance of peers.
Since you two are great at taking a financial report apart you might be
interested in looking at alterra health care 2002 bonds going for 25 cents on
the dollar.(ali-a). I bought at 50 cents on the dollar last year and am
encouraged that some investors much more astute than I have put more money into
the company. Very bad dilution for stock holders and kicks my bonds down a peg
based on liquidation preference. Even so I find it hard to believe that I will

Preliminary look gives a negative NetNet valuation of -$16.72/share.

The good news is that they have been actively embarking on a scaling back of
expansion. Holding for sale some of the completed and operational units along
with some of the units still under construction. Also they are apparently in
the final stages of selling out their share of some very costly joint ventures.

The bad news is that they are extremely burdened by debt. I get 1.0954 BILLION
in debt plus 893.7 Million in "Sale/Leaseback and synthetic lease financings"
which would mean to me that they are acting as the bank and holding the
mortgages on some of the units they have sold.

I have a projected interest expense (on the Long Term obligations only) of
about $93.85 Million. For the 9 months of their last 10Q they had gross
revenues of $341.18M on which they lost money with only $52.3M in interest
payments for that 9 month period. So this is a debt expressway to more debt.

I don't know how much reduction in debt can be achieved through the sale of the
"for sale" assets, but this is definitely a high risk speculation you have
here.

I don't know the complete terms of your bond. But, apparently they are
convertable at 34.8 shares/thousand dollars. So, let's see.... at a current
share price of $1.20, that makes $41.76 dollars back for every thousand dollars
of bond face value. Or about 4 cents on the dollar.

Also, the 10Q says that the debt instruments have a default clause that
basically means if one is in default, they all are.

Looks like a house of cards to me. If I could buy the bonds at less than 4
cents on the dollar....maybe.

But I may be looking at this all wrong, I'm not a bond speculator.

Just an update....I went back through my stuff and found some formulas for
bond-related info. I don't know if they are of any real value for your
situation, so please don't base your actions on anything other than your own
due diligence.

Bond Ratio = Long Term Debt divided by Total Long Term Capital
(This just gives the ratio of bond debt to total capitalization)

Net Tangible Asset Bond Coverage Ratio
which is (Tangible Assets - Current Liabilities)/Bond Debt
(This ratio indicates what kind of bond debt coverage you have if assets are
liquidated at their carrying value on the books....I would think you would want
this somewhere above 1.5)

Bond Interest Coverage Ratio
which is (Total Operating Income + Non-Operating Income) divided by Bond
Interest Expense
(This gives you an idea of how much of a squeeze the interest debt is going to
put on earnings....I think conservative guidelines(I might have read this in
Graham) would call for 3 to 5 times coverage)

Using the above formulas, I get the following numbers for ALI:(Please keep in
mind that I make many mistakes, and these numbers may be totally incorrect, so
please do your own calculations)

Bond Ratio = .592
Net Tangible Asset Bond Coverage Ratio = 1.65
Bond Interest Coverage = 1.23

Also keep in mind that ALI has much more interest debt from here on than was
reflected in the latest 10Q and you should read the "Managements's Discussion"
section of the filing to see what they are saying about current and future
prospects for their company.

Hope this helps.

friends I recommended it to did. I told them that I believe that it could
eventually trade at $8-10, or (briefly) higher. That would be a handsome return
from the current price. However, the fact that I do not buy it now has nothing
to do with guts or lack of conviction (but that it does not have the same

Advalorem....

I opened my spreadsheet to the series of stocks I analyzed at that time and saw
that I have a NetNet valuation of $15.47/share, not the $23.00/share you credit
me with. And I thought to myself, "Well, bucko, here's another mistake you made
in the public forum!", and I still may have....but according to this post:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=15365796 I posted the lower
number(that's not to say I couldn't have goofed with listing the number
elsewhere).

After this post to you, I intend to go and read the 10Q and "Management's
Discussion" again to refresh my memory('cause mine's only a quarter of a second
long!). But it seems to me that CEGE sold a couple of hundred million dollars
worth of ABGX within the 9 months of the reporting period I was getting my
numbers from. This is why their Current Assets(cash) jumped so much.

As far as what I use for numbers....well, I'll take the number of shares from a
public site like Yahoo or Stocksheet. That's because I'm basically lazy and
don't feel like hunting down why the 10Q and 10K numbers of shares don't match
the numbers on the sites I just mentioned, and it is usually not worth the
effort, because those site have it right most of the time.

I know I should be, maybe, using the diluted number of shares on the theory
that they are the most conservative number. However, in NetNet situations, the
stock price is so depressed that I don't think an appreciable amount of stock
options will be exercised or convertibles converted.

The other numbers I use I get directly from the company filings with the
SEC....the 10Qs and/or 10Ks.

I don't know right now about CEGE, because I haven't gone back to the filing
yet, but a lot of the companies I've been researching lately are listing the
impairment of value in their investment holdings as losses. I think accounting
rules require them to be "marked to market".

Additionally, if CEGE listed the ABGX holdings under long term assets, I
already have discounted their value quite a bit as I discount all long term
assets by 50% as part of my NetNet calculations. Occasionally, I will only
discount long term assets by 40%, but this is generally for those companies who
have depreciated PPE beyond 50% already and don't have significant other long
term assets whose value I feel is suspect.

Hope this answers your questions....I'm off to the 10Q!

No Problem Advalorem!

I make many mistakes and this time could have just as easily gone the other
way!

I went to the 10Q as promised and here's what I discovered....As of the end of
the period(9/30/00) CEGE had 9,704,136 shares of ABGX remaining available for
sale, valued at $80.81/share for a total valuation of $784.2 million(listed as
a separate line item under "Current Assets"). Subsequent to the end of the
period but still listed on the 10Q they sold 750,000 shares in a private
placement for $70.00/share for a total of $52.5 million, leaving them with
8,954,136 shares of ABGX still in inventory.

So, 784.2 - 52.5 = $731.7M as the valuation carried on the books at that time.

Not remembering what numbers I used, I went back to my spreadsheet to see what
adjustments I might need to make. I discovered that I only had one entry under
"current assets" and that was for cash in the amount of $589.57M. So, if I take
the other current assets items from the 10Q of: Cash $59.26M + Short term
investments of $172.59M + Prepaid expenses of .89M and subtract that total from
$589.57 I get that I must have valued the ABGX shares at $356.83(must have been
one of my clever days!).

Therefore the only difference to my NetNet valuation of CEGE (based on the ABGX
issue) would be to reflect the difference in the value of Friday's closing
price for ABGX of 33 11/16 and the valuation I gave it of about 39 7/8.

I haven't decided whether I'm going to do that or not. It would mean reducing
the NetNet valuation of CEGE by $1.62/share to $13.85 but I haven't thought
through whether I want to do that mid-stream(between filings) or just wait now
until the new report is filed and CEGE also takes the big hit for the reduction
of market value of ABGX and the corresponding tax benefits to partially offset
it.

FTEC looks pretty good to me. I get a NetNet value of about $1.34/share and

The only issues I see are 1). What is the danger of delisting and what impact
will that have on their price? 2). They don't have very many shares
outstanding, so volume is always going to be low, which adds a level of
illiquidity risk. I run across this a lot with low price NetNets. 3). They
don't have a very high revenue growth rate, 5 year cumulative average is about
9.26%/year, but they did that in just a few of those years, in fact revenues
dropped between '95 and '96 and did so again between '97 and '98.

Since it looks like their products are installed in large new construction

Perhaps you really don't know what I'm talking about, but a company that goes

the expense ratios, but this may be an interesting holding for value investors.

Grommit, DY isn't an easy one for me. I'll put it on my watch list for further
review. Several construction/construction related stocks that have been
mentioned here previously have turned out to be profitable investments for
people who bought at that time. That might work out similarly for DY and other
firms which are telecom infrastructure builders.

I still have my homebuilding stocks. Considering though, Mike Burry's
recommendation for shorting SPF, I might just trim my SPF position.

I added to my losing position in SHRP today. While there are some negatives to
Sharper Image, I'm still focused on its niche business and its R&D program
which has come up with some winning consumer items. Also favorable are its
growing revenue, low pe, and low ltd.

Paul.

I think I'd do that. I might not short on MB's say-so but I sure wouldn't bet
against him either.

rjm2, congrats on MOVI

Although the jury is not yet out on MOVI, I'm happy to be able to cash out a
portion of my position with strong profits, particulary in this market
environment.

Notice the debt has gone down as we had expected.

Made a partial position in BAMM over the last week at $2.00 per share. Thinking
of putting in limit orders between $1.50 to $1.75.

Looks plenty undervalued, although I question the true cash value of the
inventory and the risks involved with BAMM's internet venture. But the company
has a somewhat long history and seems to be undervalued.

Any new purchasers as BAMM dips back near its recent 52 week lows?

Okay, maybe I would be better off if I reduced my exposure to the home building
sector at this point. (Thanks for the posts to get me to consider it.)

I started to cut back my relatively large position in SPF, as well as a little
of my four-year holding in RYL this am. Also, I've started to reduce my small
position in Whirlpool. And in other actions, I've taken some software designer
SNPS off the table too after today's 5 point move.

I added to my losing position in SWS today @ $20.34. My opinion is that these
type financial stocks are buyable for value investors when they trade at book
value. Book value is $19.20. I'll call today's price close enough for me to
add. I originally bought at higher levels because of other aspects - SWS
seeking a buyer, SWS holdings of NITE, trading pattern of SWS (That was an
oops!)

I also added a small amount to my small amount of RDN. Here my ruling reason
for buying is that AIG has a good size position in the stock. From my
experience with other financial stocks in which AIG is a holder, AIG seems to
be willing to add to their position if/when the stock drops, and sometimes they
add as the stock rises. Such activity is both good and bad: the bad is that AIG
can and has become the controlling stockholder. (They could lowball a takeover
bid.) But for now for RDN, if AIG's past pattern were to continue (and there's
nothing that says it will), their activity tends to put a floor on the stock
(if they sop up shares), and their doing this would confirm, at least to me,
the stock's value.

Looked into CEGE and IDTC a bit further.

CEGE: Actual cash is about $7.33/share based on recent 10Q. Value of remaining
holding in Abgenix works out to be about $7.65. Abgenix holds about $6.67 in
cash, and trades at $29. If Abenix were to trade near cash on hand, that would
reduce the value of CEGEs stake to about $1.75/share. $9 would make a near net
cash entry point with both companies running at a modest burn rate.

I need to look more carefully at recent results to verify the burn rate hasn't
been colored by gains on investments or subject to an upturn in research and
clinic studies costs.

IDTC: The value of it's remaining interest in NTOP is minimal compared to
actual cash. Reported Cash is $30.47 of which $2.77 of that is holdings in
NTOP. NTOP also has about $4 of cash, trading $10. This leaves IDTC with north
of $27/share actual cash, while trading at roughly $21. I don't get it. Mgmt is
so bad that the deserve this kind of negative premium?

All in all, I'd say thus far IDTC wins hands down. I need a short to show me
what I'm overlooking.
