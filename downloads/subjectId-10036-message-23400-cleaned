Nah, I'd buy the tickets in sequential order, so I wouldn't have to search
tickets one-by-one to pull the winning ticket.

A little problem taking delivery and storing the tickets though. If each ticket
is about 1/32" thick, total stack would be 380,500 feet. I only wonder if I
could safely get 10,000 piles each being 38-feet high in my small backyard.
Geez, that's a lot of felled trees.

Railroad/transportation, associated stocks. This investment area has been
discussed here previously. Nevertheless, you could be right though that there's
a long-term transformation happening, and a buyer of such stocks now might do
very well in future.

I'll give my perspective on the stocks I'm familiar with.

With Greenbrier and Trinity, it's was - for me - a matter of being in in the
wrong part of the cycle, losing patience and getting out before the good times
arose. (I believe there also was a lawsuit about Trinity's leaking ship hulls
that scared me too.) A personal problem for me- it's just been too mentally
difficult for me to come back into GBX in the 20's or 30's when I sold it (at a
loss, if I recall) around 7 or 8. (Maybe if I had seen others on the thread
buying on its rise, I might have convinced myself to revisit the business and
stock.)

I'm holding a few shares of CSX and NSC which have been discussed here
occasionally over the past couple of years. Recently I added GWR. I don't know
if any of these stocks are buys at current (high) prices. I'm not planning on
adding, but I won't sell either. I've not liked UNP because I perceive they
have labor issues. Possibly all the railroads have union/labor issues - UNP no
different from any other - and it's just me who's a little more suspicious of
UNP's. Anyway, each time I've reviewed the stock, I've stayed away. (Wrongly
apparently, because the stock has risen.)

In truckers, I'm now only holding ABFS and the the old Yellow (former symbol:
YELL), which is now YRCW. Also Ryder (R), but that's not in quite the same
category. YRCW looks - to me - like it still might be in buying range:
according to Yahoo, forward p/e is about 7.6. I have considered adding.

For consideration too perhaps: I like TUG, first mentioned here in '01 by
TimbaBear.
From Yahoo: "Maritrans, Inc., through its subsidiaries, engages in the
ownership and operation of oceangoing tank barges, tugboats, and oil tankers
that are used in the transportation of oil and related products in the United
States. It provides marine transportation services for refined petroleum
products from refineries..."

I missed the first double or maybe triple in TUG; I'm in for a position now
though. Stock's dropped from highs of the past few months, and I'm down a
little, but I'm hopeful the company will continue to do okay going forward, and
that the stock might rise.

I've also been interested in ports -- and I don't mean just the fortified wines
-g-. So I continue to hold Hutchinson Whampoa (HUWHY.pk), the big owner of port
facilities worldwide, and run by the multibillioniare Li Ka-shing. A key
problem here as I see it is that HUWHY also has huge and unprofitable
investments in the 3G mobile-phone business. Also I am holding shares in
dividend-paying Westshore Terminals (WTSHF.pk) which ships Fording company coal
from Westshore's port in Vancouver.

Carey Thompson, you might also review what's at Dale Baker's 50% gains thread.
I believe he/others there might be holding and following container stocks.
Maersk, which you mentioned, for example.

The things I liked about PRPX when I bought were its small size and its growing
market niche.

In the size category - PRPX has a recent market cap of about $140 million, a
P/S of 1.65, and a P/B of 2.91.

In the market niche category - Freight railroads move about 40% of our nation's
freight and spend about 45% of their operating revenue on capital expenditures
and maintenance expenses related to infrastructure and equipment. PRPX supplies
railroad track components and friction management products, railroad load
securement systems, rail anchors and spikes, and material handling products.

I agree with your assessment of the energy sector's positive impact on the rail
sector. Emissions standards, and consequently the cost, for diesel fuel
continues to rise. The fuel efficiency of railroads is three times the fuel
efficiency of trucks.

Coal accounts for half of all U.S. electricity generation. About two-thirds of
coal shipments in the U.S. are handled by rail. The average distance coal is
transported and the tonnage of coal shipments continues to rise. The largest
rail operators have experienced congestion on their lines as the demand for
coal increases and are spending millions to alleviate congestion and increase
tonnage capacity.

And PRPX pays a dividend which yields about 1.6% annually.

Thanks for the links.

Portec is a very old and established railroad maintenance company. I believe
they experienced trouble in the past and just began trading again within the
last year. The rails are beginning a turnaround after languishing for 50 years;
that's is what I keep harping at to this thread (board). This turnaround should
not be a secret, to see it with their own eyes, all the members have to do is
notice the traffic and shiny, new railcars and trailers on the freight RRs they
drive past each day. Aside, I think many Americans are disinterested in the RRs
after the Canadians bought up all their local RRs within the past 20 years. The
Illinois Central and the Wisconsin Central are booming, but now they are named
the Canadian National Railway. Ditto, the Soo Line in the Midwest.

Portec is under the radar screen of most brokers and mutual funds because of
the small market capitalization. That does not mean we can not investigate
Portec and make some $$$s on it. I plan to do more due dilligence, and I
requested the annual report from the company's website today.

Good luck investing,

You make an important point with that statement. Since Congress deregulated the
industry and rails became privately owned the private sector has budgeted
hundreds of millions to improve and expand rail lines. I believe PRPX will be
able to capitalize on that long term trend.

Trimmed my HON position and booked some profit. The company continues to do

Their leveraged Free Flow Cash flow is now negative and their trailing PE is

looking into next year, the consensus forward PE is right around 15. Not a bad
value if they are correct.

It's a hard call to sell a position I have owned for such a long time but I
like to build up cash reserves during this time of year so I can buy other
companies with a much better value proposition. I guess I am not alone as all

might be a good time to sand aside and see if there's big dip...another buying
opportunity. My original thesis, that most of the bad news was reflected in the
Dec. selloff and that there's potential in the smoking cessation and other
projects, is still intact [I think].
I'll likely get back in if there's another dip and my thesis remains intact.
This is a speculative sell and a speculative stock with the only value aspect
being that all the optimism was beat out of it and it looks like an inexpensive

Madharry, SIL: For a price point to sell, I like to have something to key on.
Usually that's something historical - high past p/e, high past p/sales ratios,
high price to book. Each situation is different of course - a particular stock
could be in a new and/or different growth phase (moving from value to growth),
so keying on past metrics wouldn't be the optimum tactic. But still, maybe okay
especially if one begins to sell on scale up.

With a stock like SIL, with a long history of no earnings or even price/sales
(from what I see), it's no wonder that determining when to close the position
is difficult. (It was too difficult for me to even buy the stock when it was
first mentioned here.)

HURC. I was a day or two away from shorting. And I hardly ever short. (And when
I do, I'm usually wrong -g-)

It's just that I go on past results and these tool makers are cyclical and
usually sell and should sell at low p/e's when times are good (assuming
infinite p/e's when times are bad and there are no orders or profits). I've
seen Hurcos on the factory floor - they're impressive (to me), but not more so
than any other complex equipment in machine shops. Perhaps the new products
that Hurco has are indeed quite significant and important and in demand by
customers. Such a competitive business, with some national pride involved too
(used to be anyway - in my limited experience - that customers would strongly
prefer to buy from their own country's machine tool industry), that it's hard
for me to see a sustainable competitive advantage that Hurco might have.

Just my opinion, I've been wrong many times, and I am NO expert. Someone buying
or holding the stock after my last post denigrating the stock price, possibly
has done okay even with today's price drop. I do not know. My opinion - that
the stock is still expensive at current price - might change if someone who had
current actual experience with the machines were to post. I see only people who
look at the current and perhaps purported future sales and earnings. My

What's the Boards opinion on CAG? This stock was recommended on the Nightly
Business Report 2/24/05. The PE is reasonable at 14x and the P/S is only at
0.75. The dividend is excellent at 5.2% (xdividend April 26, 2006).

The Free Flow Cash Flow is positive and the book value at $9.00/share
represents almost 50% of the current price.

If you look at their peer group, they are the lowest priced using PE and P/S
measures. This may be because of their previous poor performance in their
quarterly revenue growth and low EBITA (it's still positive and may reflect a
bottom).

It seems like this company is priced as if it is at a 25% off sale because it
should be a $25 stock with the potential to go to $30.

Hi roquedolphin - I was thinking about the same thing. Perhaps there may be a

eventually be a vaccine but it may take some time before it is available for
the birds (and humans). Watch the pharma company Sanofi(
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=SNY ) as they are working on such a vaccine.

Sanofi-Aventis (SNY) - Here's information on their "bird-flu" research.
http://www.sanofipasteur.com/sanofi-pasteur/front/pages/vaccination-immunology-

Sanofi-Aventis (SNY) is not a value play stock IMO but there is some
speculation that they may be interested in a merger (or purchase) of BMY
Bristol-Myers Squibb. Both companies have several joint drug development and
marketing ventures. I consider BMY a value stock and may be a back door play
for SNY.

It will be worth watching CAG and other Chicken & Turkey producers several

Well, it's that time again this year. The time of the year that STRZ announces
its sweet annual dividend and I thank you again for recommending this stock
around two years ago, I believe. So, thank you. :)

Any thoughts on when you would begin selling this stock? As the stock price
rises, the dividend % is starting to at least get close to normal percentages
and I'm starting to wonder about valuation. And, the generally wide bid/ask
would tell me to try to sell when volume is up, which would be either soon or
next year when the dividend is announced, I'm guessing.

Are you still holding? Thoughts on valuation?

Chilly Willy,

Great minds think alike. I should have posted on this more recently, but I
didn't get around to it.

I sold middle of last year, but I bought end of last year and recently after I
saw news about the buyback. I thought with the buyback and the dividend coming
up (and the fact that the stock was reasonably valued) that I had a decent
margin of safety.

I'm inclined to hold on and see if it runs up a bit. I wouldn't fault you for
selling some here, since the stock is illiquid and volatile (and I think your
dividend % versus historical is a smart way to look at this). However, the
great dividend news in tandem with the stock buyback is very positive. And
stocks with large dividends can often trade up into their ExDate.

I'd also like to look at the next earnings and cash flows before I sell. If I
recall correctly, I think they have an easy comparison versus last year. If we
can see this stock with a decent PE and high yield, it might start showing up
on other value investor screens.

near-future, so I appreciate your response.

The question to me is this:

STRZ in general operates close to break-even on a GAAP earnings basis. As a
CPA, I know that this doesn't tell the whole story, but it's certainly part of
the story. Now, though they're close to break-even from a GAAP standpoint, they
have strong cash flows. The question to me is, in their generation of cash
flows in the last couple of years are they sacrificing anything long-term? For
example, are they spending as much capital expenditures as they should to keep
things going strong long-term?

I'm inclined to believe in management and say yes, as management hasn't proven
me wrong yet. And at the current dividend rate, given that I got into this
stock at around $6/share, it won't take many years at this rate for the
dividends to equal my purchase price. So, I'm content in holding for now, but
if the stock price continues higher, my risk/reward ratio will get to the point
that I will probably take my profits and run.

Thanks again,

cw

Oopson STRZ,

Well the market is telling me I was wrong (down 7% after being up 5%). I should
have known --- Motley Fool articles can be good short term contrary indicators,
so a sell could have been in order.

I'm inclined to hold here, especially at these lower prices. If it goes in the
low 7's, I am inclined to buy more.

Eating my words for pushing APOL on this thread. One of the many earnings
disappointments in this still young year - APOL, TYC, EXPE, VIA missed the last
quarter, probably a sign of a tougher market going forward.

I am holding APOL for now since the miss was more om the earnings than the
revenue side, i assume that the growth story is still intact.

Going back to 9 Jan.'06, and our discussion regarding the merits of APOL and
CECO, it will be interesting to see how these two stocks perform in the future
medium term.
CECO seems to be currently holding its own, although no "fireworks".
I'm rather puzzled by "the Market's" recent reaction to APOL.
Personally I don't see much problem with their current fundamentals.

FWIW, i sold of my position in APOL for 50.89$ yesterday. I intend to get back
in once the washout stops. Holding PSUN as well, hoping that it's just a little
jolt for an other wise strong company. Still, i am up for the year in my

CECO was in the basket before and APOl joined them <ng>. The shortfall of
APOL's revenue growth must have caught management at the wrong foot, since it
appeared to have fallen straight to the bottom line. probably still more to
come but APOL is still growing in the mid-teens but i continue to believe that
APOL is the strongest company in their business.

re. FDP (Fresh Del Monte): It seems to be in a free-fall. Motley Fool has some
pretty good comments - they have changed to negative on the company (as has
everyone else, apparently).

Stock's had positive earnings every year for past ten. According to management
'05 has been particularly bad for them though - worst conditions in five years.
Maybe the stock can recover. OTOH, with cessation of pineapple growing in
Hawaii, competition in banana biz, I'm not knowing where their business is
heading. When this stock has been down, it has been down - I'd hate to see my
position go below $10/sh. where stock has traded a few years ago.

Most likely, to appease the trading gods and to relieve some of my anxiety, I
will sell some of my position if the stock drops much below $18/sh (currently
$18.53).

For somebody looking to buy, willing to hold for a while, expecting no bad news
about the dividend, it might be okay for a small bet. I'm just a little tired
of holding this thing, and I'm not willing to increase my position.

Hi Paul - This is an interesting business proposition for KSU if they can take
advantage of their competitive advantage with a port & railway distribution
line into the U.S.. It's still an expensive stock but I will watch and see if I
can start a position under $20.

If Home Land Security places more requirements on the domestic port security
(especially with the recent Dubai Port Deal), it may be cheaper to land product
in Mexico and then use the rail to bring it into the U.S.. Now even the
teamsters want to stop the Dubai deal as they believe they may lose jobs and
their high wages (http://www.nbc4.com/news/7398212/detail.html).

It may be interesting to see what large companies have manufacturing facilities
in Mexico near KSU distribution lines. I think Maytag and Ford have large
assembly plants in Mexico but do not know how they distribute their finished
product into the U.S.

==============================================================

I did add a few more shares of Ford (F) today to my my current holdings. I have
my 2/3 position in hand as we get close to a five year low. I hope they can
continue their 5% dividend because I am willing to wait for their eventual
recovery. I believe their goal to have a hybrid option for 80% of their product
line by 2010 will help them with sales growth in the future.
