CVS -- Thanks for the post.

I'm skeptical that "... much of the savings are likely to come from discounts
negotiated at the pharmacy level and decreased dispensing fees." But, what do I
know? I think CVS has larger problems to overcome, as they openly admit in
their press releases -- like losing customers due to poor service & lack of
pharmacists.

I looked at the MRD that you mentioned. I will watch it, but please post if
they do something brilliant. I do not see the unifying thread of their
businesses. They sell chemicals, do plating and sell stuff to printers. In a
presentation to a Merrill Lynch conference, the chairman said that they are
strategically remaking the company because 90% if the net worth of employees
was in MRD stock. And he wanted them to be more diversified. That statement
befuddles me as a strange reason to turn the company in a different direction.
But the stock has been hammered into attractiveness.

I can do better than that - here IS the article:

Robert Willens, Lehman Brothers' managing director and tax expert, recently ran
across a special variety of dividend, albeit an infrequent one, that he finds
highly attractive by dint of its unique tax character. The company involved is
Dallas-based Kaneb Services Inc., which will change its name to Xanser Corp.,
assuming shareholder ratification at the August 7 annual meeting.

As Willens describes it, "The company was engaged in the field of Information
Technology and, through its interest in Kaneb Pipeline Partners LP, in the
transportation and marketing of oil and gas products. Its ability to grow its
technology business was hampered by the fact that the market perceived Kaneb to
be only an energy company. In addition, the large amount of debt associated
with the pipeline business, which was reflected on its consolidated balance
sheet, was also retarding its ability to raise capital for expanding its
technology business."

Accordingly, at the end of June, Kaneb Services Inc. distributed a special
dividend to its shareholders. The payout was not in cash but in units of
interest in a partnership dubbed Kaneb Services LLC (Big Board ticker symbol:
KSL). The latter's chief asset is its interest in 12-year-old Kaneb Pipeline
Partners LP, a major transporter of refined petroleum products in the Midwest
and the third-largest independent liquids terminaling company in the U.S.
(Kaneb Services Inc. shareholders received one share of Kaneb Services LLC for
every three shares of Kaneb Services Inc. common stock held. The initial annual
distributable cash flow is estimated to be $13 million, or around 30 cents in
cash payouts per quarter on each Kaneb Services LLC share.)

Now for the special tax character of the dividend. Willens explains that the
payout was classified as a partial-liquidation dividend because it consisted of
the assets of a business that the paying corporation had conducted for at least
five years. (It also would have constituted a partial-liquidation dividend if
it consisted of the proceeds of the sale of such a business -- the more typical
case.) A partial-liquidation dividend is not taxed as ordinary income, at top
marginal rates. Instead, shareholders are treated as if they sold a portion of
their stock back to the corporation in exchange for the dividend. Shareholders
are deemed to have sold the same percent of their stock that the value of the
distribution (here, roughly $5 a share) bears to the price of the stock
immediately before the distribution (some $8 a share).

Thus, in Kaneb's case, shareholders are considered to have sold about 62% of
their stock back to the corporation in exchange for the distribution. Says
Willens: "The difference between the amount of the distribution ($5 a share)
and 62% of the shareholder's aggregate basis in his or her shares gives rise to
a capital gain, which is taxed at preferential rates that cannot exceed 20%."

Hence the favorable tax profile, since the amount that is taxed "is only the
excess of the distribution over the basis of the shares judged sold, and that
excess is taxed at capital-gains rates, not at ordinary rates, which can be as
high as 39.6%."

There are three types of distributions a corporation can make: ordinary
dividends, taxed at top marginal rates; tax-free spinoffs (Bristol-Myers
Squibb's spinoff of its Zimmer Holdings orthopedics subsidiary, payable today,
is an example); and then partial-liquidation dividends. "In a way," observes
Willens, "these distributions are halfway between tax-free spinoffs and
ordinary dividends."

Partial-liquidation dividends arise when a corporation exits a business --
usually via its sale -- and decides to distribute the proceeds to its investors
(General Dynamics, St. Joe and Johns-Manville are other notable examples
Willens found). With regard to Kaneb, though, the distribution consisted of the
business itself. Willens presumes that "allowing each of Kaneb's businesses to
trade independently will eliminate market inefficiencies, and each such
business should begin to trade 'correctly' unimpeded by market misperceptions
as to exactly what business Kaneb, in its former status as a conglomerate, was
in. Further, Kaneb Services LLC is a partnership, not a corporation. This means
that its earnings are not subject to taxation." Willens explains that "in
general, a publicly traded partnership is taxed as a corporation unless, as in
Kaneb Services LLC's case, it is engaged in the natural-resources or
real-estate business" (so the approach Kaneb took was not available to
Bristol-Myers and Zimmer). Therefore, Kaneb's earnings are passed through to
its partners, who report such earnings on their individual tax returns.

To Willens, "this means that Kaneb Services LLC, because its earnings are not
diminished by entity-level taxes, should be in a position to pay generous
dividends to its unitholders."

An issue with MFW is that Ronald Perelman, apparently the controlling
stockholder in MFW, is causing the company to take a big position in another of
his companies, Panavision. He's saying - as I understand it - that this will be
done at fair value. However, smaller MFW stockholders apparently are saying in
response that the purchase price/sh MFW will pay is way more than Panavision
has sold for; that it's a bailout for Mr. Perelman from this poorly perfoming
company (Panavision); and that the sum MFW pays will very much degrade MFW's
balance sheet.

Perelman might be a peril, man.

Thanks for the links to the stories on the Panavision acquisition.

I'm not sure what I make of it at this time. I'll think on it.

Perelman has been on the MFW Board of Directors for 5 years, and the FCF
numbers I have derived are based on the most recent two years. Ergo, his
influence as the largest shareholder has not been a negative to the bottom
line.

The Panavision article regarding Mr. Vannini's intentions and reasoning
certainly appear to give one a cause for concern. However, a look at insider
trades shows a price per share for Panavision that appears to be about 20%
higher than their current market price, so the article seems to have an element
of sensationalism (say it ain't so!) to it.

Conversely, a quick look at PVI's cash flow leaves me less than enthusiastic.
If MFW's management can turn PVI's performance around, then it may prove to be
a good investment....that's what I've got to think about.

(in retrospect, way too soon) when dividend yield wasn't supportive enough.
Also in retrospect, these guys made two of the worst business decisions
concurrently: they put up for sale their most valuable utility and coal
operations before the big run on energy to concentrate on the
telecommunications business (Touch America), the latter at or near its peak,
before a steep drop. Hence, the low, low price for MTP, soon to become TA.

it in the funds - occasionally adding to positions. Their net cost was down in

I'm guessing current Mutual managers still see value in FLA; the aggressive

value, they'd sell out of the stock (regardless of tax consequences). Jmo, of

Article in today's Barrons describing the M&F Worldwide story. I find it
interesting that when a investor with a virtuous reputation takes a stake
(e.g., Buffett) it benefits him and the public, but when someone with a lesser
reputation takes a stake with an eye to buying out the company, it benefits him
and not the public. The public rationally discounts the company and perversely
rewards the investor. This is prior to even considering any actual bad behavior
(self-dealing, etc.) of that investor with respect to the company.

My take on M&F is that absent Perelman and the Panavision deal the company is
clearly worth worth more than 10x trailing eps of about a dollar or $10. I
place my own minority discount of 95% on any Perelman controlled entity if the
deal does go through which would make for maybe 25c per share.

My quickie/worthless judgment on the suit (based solely on this article) is
that plaintiffs should stand at least a 50 percent chance of a
judgment/settlement that produces a $10 stock value. I have neither the
background nor information to make a credible judgment.

50% of .25c plus 50% of $10 results in a value for me of $5.13. I place a 50%
discount on that for my aggravation and investment return. So I will buy at
$2.55 so long as the verdict is not in.

This analysis assumes that the Preferred B stock has been retired (contrary to
the appearance on Yahoo Insider).

P.S. My only knowledge of Perelman is from this article and should not be
relied upon.

"....My take on M&F is that absent Perelman and the Panavision deal the company
is clearly worth worth more than 10x trailing eps of about a dollar...."

How do you quantify how much earnings are worth to you? Do you have a set
formula? Say, wanting to earn a minimum of 2 times the going "risk free" rate?
For example, if CD's are at 4%, do you want that dollar of earnings to
represent an 8% return? $1.00/.08= $12.50....or do you use some other method?

"....I place my own minority discount of 95% on any Perelman controlled
entity...."
Is this a token attempt at objectivity? I mean if you think Perelman's
influence is such a severe negative on a company he influences, then why mess
with it at all? I mean, what significance is 25 cents to an investment
decision, except possibly for snigger value?

To me, the question is: "Are the fundamentals of the company to be completely
discounted because of Perelman's involvement?" if so, then I move on to the
next investment analysis. (I don't leave part of my foot back there to possibly
shoot at later(i.e I'll buy it at 2.55), if I can't trust him, I can't trust
him at any price) If not, then do I take Perelman into account at all? If so,
how do I quantify his impact?

So far, I'm not selling my position in MFW because of hearsay. I'm not selling
it because of the opinions of respected posters here, because then they would
be making my investment decisions on this issue, and I would never have
confidence in what to do next if this company came up again in any of my
screens. As compelling as expressed feelings may be, they are not facts, they
are expressed feelings.

My analysis of the fundamentals of this company suggest that it is a bargain at
these prices. I have a NetNet valuation of $5.29/share; a book value of
$11.89/share; using Graham's valuation I get $8.00/share; and applying Graham's
valuation to Free Cash Flow, I get $11.65/share; Using a currently high risk
free rate of return of 6%, I get that I would have to have $22.00 invested at
that rate to get the same cash flow I can buy for the current stock price of
about $5.00/share. Powerful numbers. Carefully calculated.

That's not to say I wouldn't just turn the page and move on to find the next
value if I felt it was prudent. But I am saying, I'm still thinking about this
issue of Perelman and his impact, and will continue to own the stock during the
interim.

If you can get this company at $2.55/share, then that would represent an even
better value than I achieved....possibly.... but then, if the stock drops to
there, then maybe it is Perelman after all, and it would still be too
expensive.

Hi, timba... re MFW
It looks like it is a really good company. I believe the market will put a PE
floor of 10 on it assuming the debt is manageable because that is what the
market tends to do on "really good companies" in these times. At $25 million
the debt does seem manageable. I am confident the PE of 5 is entirely
attributable to the deal and Perelman.

To answer your question, like most of the posters here I don't use any one
valuation scheme. Discounted cash flow is too much work and involves too much
guessing. Which metrics are a judgment call based on the company and industry
and my own limited capabilities. I, however, welcome my own subjectivity into
my analysis, and I think a lot is lost simply by looking at numbers, as in the
case here: compelling numbers probably justified by the circumstances.

Timba, this wasn't really addressed to you. I didn't remember who talked about
it. I thought I made it clear in the post that the judgments made should be
considered personal. I brought this up to further discussion.

As to my personal 95% Perelman minority discount, you said:
I mean if you think Perelman's influence is such a severe negative on a company
he influences, then why mess with it at all? I mean, what significance is 25
cents to an investment decision, except possibly for snigger value?
My response is that I don't want to mess with him at all if he is in control.
Witness how he is trying to get $17.40 for his PVI shares, and since the deal
was announced the outside passive minority investors in PVI have a market price
ranging from $3 to 6. At the mid $4s PVI has an objective 75% Perelman
discount. For my personal calculations, I'm taking an additional 20% for
Perelman aggravation.

If I were to make an investment and Perelman won, I would sell as soon as
practical.

Is the preferred b outstanding or not?
The recent proxy says "...Series B Preferred Stock; each of such shares has one
vote. Mr. Perelman owns 53.47% of the Voting Stock (i.e. Common Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock taken together) of the Company."

That was the fastest entry and exit on my alert list to date.

P.S. I am not trying to talk you out of your investment. Compelling valuations

Timba, there's nothing "hearsay" or "rumors" about what Perleman is trying to

Maybe the court will stop it, but thats a maybe. I thought the board would stop

James,

I don't have a very high opinion of Barron's so I don't subscribe to their
publications. Using the fact that they write about this issue does not
automatically mean instant credibility of their statements, at least to me.
Still, even a blind pig finds the occasional acorn, so maybe the article has
merit. I won't be able to decide that for myself until I see it.

"....A Graham analysis would have to reflect the fact that there is a crime in
progress here...."
An objective Graham analysis would indeed take into account the employment of
excess capital, and its efficiency and return. As nearly as I've been able to
discover, whether or not a crime has been committed has yet to be determined.
Unless, of course, you mean "crime" in a moral sense rather than a legal one,
which then moves the standards to a more subjective nature.

I appear to be standing alone on the issue of whether or not MFW constitutes a
good investment. Or, rather, on the issue that it still does. That fact is not
lost to me, and with the acumen and experience demonstrated over the years here
by the various posters who have weighed in against this because of Perelman,
I'd be a fool not to give strong weight to this concensus.

But the contrarian in me says: "hmmmmm"

I will be watching the situation closely, and the Barron's story will show up
on Reuters or somewhere else and I'll be sure to read it.

I appreciate all the concern, and have felt this to be a stimulating
discussion.

I'm not afraid of having been wrong on this investment, but will not change my
mind on it until I am convinced that the strength of the fundamentals has been
or will likely be overwhelmed by other factors. What it will take to convince
me, I'm not sure. But I know I haven't seen it yet.

I believe that once a controlling shareholder has proven that he has not sense
of ethical behavior it is best to stay away. No matter how much of a bargain
something appears to be, it isn't a bargain if you cant get your money out or
if the controlling investor can milk the money out in one way or another. Look
what happened to Seagate investors. they ended up being taken to the cleaners
by management. I once invested in a semiconductor equipment company that was
selling at a very cheap multiple of earnings net of cash where the principal
had a controlling interest in the company. The company ended up selling most of
its assets to another company for a very low price, and the rest of the company
just limped along. In that case the investor recieved no benefit from
purchasing a bargain. The principal ended up with a major stake in the other
company as well as a hefty employment contract. My opinion/guess is that even
if this purchase is disallowed by the courts, it will eventually take place at
some inflated price and Pearlman will figure out some other way to milk the
company of its assets to benefit Pearlman rather than other shareholders.

Starting a small position in Rockwell Automation (ROK) today. Mentioned
favorably by a fund manager in latest Barron's. (Apparently ROK sometimes has
#1 or #2 market share in some countries even though they are a small cap
compared to competitors Honeywell, Siemens, GE)

Rockwell Automation's business has slowed with the economy. Still, a company
like ROK that focuses on helping other companies to improve their productivity
or reduce their costs, ought to (maybe) return to stock market favor when/if
business spending for capital increases.

ROK is selling about 2x stated book value, with a relatively low psr, and
there's also a dividend, yielding about 4%. That combination, for a large
industrial firm, I find attractive.

Don H. Davis, chairman and chief executive officer, said, in the 7/24 quarterly
report, "Despite the weak economic environment, we generated free cash flow of
$145 million in the quarter through our continued focus on working capital
management."
An apparently positive statement, although it doesn't mean much to me.
Especially now that I've taken it out of context and it's of one quarter's

I still need to get more info. about FLA. Meanwhile, I started a position today
in Interpublic (IPG). IPG was in Mr. Buffett's portfolio somewhere around '84
-'85 and maybe other years as well. (I don't have complete details.) At one
point he liked advertising companies like IPG because of their ability to take
money from clients in good times and in bad.

Interpublic is undergoing some structural problems (imo) related to an apparent
world-wide reduction of monies spent for advertising, as well as having to
integrate a substantial acquisition. The Wall Street Journal today has an
article that suggests the current situation - slump in overall ad. revenues and
the difficulties advertising firms have - won't so quickly improve as it has in
past downturns because of the new types of problems facing the industry (Multi

Congrats on ODP. Nice to make money and sweet to beat The Man by getting the

Now if you had only bought a million or more shares in the style of Mr.

HON should work out okay, imo. (I took on an exploratory position after Keith
Jamison mentioned the stock on the arbitrage thread after the GE deal
collapsed.) The stock price is still close enough to Mr. Buffett's buy price to
be a buy also for Buffett followers, I'd guess. (I have to defer to the Buffett
experts here - I just assume that even if he bought at the very low 33-34 (It's
now 36.68), that he wouldn't be selling it if it only went up a few more points
to 38-40.

And I'm still struggling to understand GLK. The price is possibly now below Mr.
Buffett's purchase prices. There's been recent insider selling - looks like the
controlling or founding family trust is selling substantially. Maybe Mr.
Buffett is buying from the family; maybe the family just wants out or needs
some diversification; or maybe they themselves don't understand the value of
GLK - selling it so close to Mr. Buffett's buy point. Or maybe they actually
know more than Mr. Buffett. Or maybe it's coincidental or I'm focusing on the

GLK stock looks expensive to me - seems like deteriorating business

Interesting article on ITXC
The Teleconomist
ITXC Rightly Takes the Road Less Traveled
By Cody Willard
Special to TheStreet.com
8/14/01 2:55 PM ET
URL: http://www.thestreet.com/p/comment/theteleconomist/1517943.html

Many different business models exist in the long-distance world. Companies like
Level 3 (LVLT:Nasdaq) and Global Crossing (GX:NYSE) spend billions covering the
globe with fiber and then lease the unlit fiber to other carriers.

Or they can also light the fiber themselves (which means that they'll install
the equipment on either end of the fiber to send and receive signals, thus
enabling communications over the fiber) and sell access to other carriers.
Alternatively, other carriers can buy the lit-fiber services from these service
providers and resell the services to other telecommunications companies.

A company called ITXC (ITXC:Nasdaq) employs a rather different model. Rather
than laying or leasing entire routes from one far-off place (read: wherever you
are) to another (read: wherever your mom lives, even if it's in the Republic of
Chad), ITXC uses a little thing called the Internet to route long-distance
calls. You've heard of the Internet, no?

Because ITXC doesn't have to spend billions laying fiber or hundreds of
millions leasing and lighting fiber to send long-distance calls to the far
reaches of the globe, it can get a nice return on its capital investment really
quickly. Even better, it can offer long-distance services at much lower prices
than anyone else. A few other companies have tried to employ the same network,
but this is a business of economies and network effects.

As Metcalfe's Law says, the usefulness, or utility, of a network equals the
square of the number of users. (Robert Metcalfe, the founder of 3Com and the
inventor of the Ethernet protocol, came up with this theory.) In other words,
every time ITXC gains access to another country, the value of its network
increases exponentially.

Let's say you're a long-distance company that sells services to businesses, and
you have to choose between ITXC and its competitor, ABC. ABC can send your
traffic into 20 countries. For the same price (or cheaper because of economies
of scale), ITXC can get you into 99 countries. You're probably gonna pick ITXC.
As the company hits critical mass and extends its network to the far reaches of
the earth before anyone else, I believe the rate of revenue growth could
accelerate, as this network design is extremely scalable.

Concerns about the quality of the calls routed over the Internet (or simply
over private networks using voice-over IP) are quickly fading. In fact, many
telephone companies already are using ITXC for calls, and you might not even
know it.

The company uses proprietary real-time network-monitoring systems to route
calls over the Internet in the most efficient way. ITXC has contracts with six
of the 10 largest carriers in the world and 14 of the top 15 U.S. long-distance
carriers. Also, ITXC's network is by far the largest of its kind, with 559
points of presence in more than 318 cities in 117 countries.

For all of the advantages of its network and model, what really makes ITXC
compelling is its financials. If the company executes on its current business
plan, which I fully expect it will, it will reach EBITDA-positive paradise --
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- in the first
quarter of next year. When it gets there, it'll still have $100 million in the
bank. This is a company that, as James Cramer puts it, raised money when it
could, not when it had to.

ITXC Gets Pummeled
Wall Street has punished this stock to extremes

The stock price blew through the company's cash position, hitting a 52-week low
of $3 last week. But I think the Street, in its typical swinging to extremes,
has punished this stock far beyond any reasonable value. In my book, that makes
ITXC a buy, which is exactly what I'll be doing this week.

Doug. Nadworny re: MCIP: Too tough for me to figure.

I had a small position in a company that was bought by WCOM for stock. I've
kept the WCOM stock, and I received a few shares of MCIP recently.

I see where WCOM says MCIP ought to be able to keep paying their current
dividend, and maybe with WCOM controlling things (MCIP is a tracking stock),
they will continue.

On the other hand, my experience is that when dividends are so extremely high
and I buy the stock... I generally get hurt. Another negative for me is that
the distribution was only a very few shares (not worth much at $13/sh) of MCIP
for every 100 WCOM. So if most people are like me they might be doing as I did
which was to sell MCIP just to clean up the account. (I rejected an alternative
of adding to position to bring it up to a round lot.) Such dumping by investors
may put temporary pressure on the stock. So back on the other hand, there's
then the spinout view that the selling by small stockholders creates a very
good buying opportunity IF the stock price becomes undervalued.

Right now, I'm having enough trouble holding on to WCOM. I doubt that I'd be a
buyer of MCIP. If I could understand MCIP and its business prospects better or
burn rate or what is important with regard to this stock/business, I might
reconsider. Now I can't, so I pass.

Sizing up an outfit
Sunder Subramaniam

The enterprise value (EV) or firm value, an important concept for investors, is
an indicator of how the market attributes value to the firm as a whole.

Some market commentators argue that one can use market capitalisation to
measure the enterprise value.

However, certain factors are not included in the calculation of a firm's market
capitalisation.

For instance, market cap ignores debt, and for companies which have substantial
debt, the market cap will give a distorted picture.

Enterprise value is basically a modification of market cap because it
incorporates debt.

Does the market efficiently price a company's cash and debt in conjunction with
the value of its equity?

Not really.

Anyone who uses enterprise value as a way to measure a company's market value
rather than simply using market capitalisation doesn't think so.

Enterprise value is a term coined by analysts to discuss the aggregate value of
a company as an enterprise rather than just focusing on its current market
capitalisation.

By adjusting market capitalisation for any debt or cash which a company has at
its disposal, analysts believe one can get a more precise picture of a
company's current market value.

The Calculation

In order to compute enterprise value, first calculate the company's market cap,
add debt (reported in the balance sheet), and substract cash and investments
(also reported in the balance sheet).

The total debt should be taken by adding long and short term debt.

Market capitalisation is stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding
shares, which ostensibly represents a price tag for the company, showing what
you would have to pay to buy every share of it.

For instance, if a company has one crore shares, and each share currently sells
for Rs 25, the company has a market capitalisation of Rs 25 crore.

When most analysts talk about the current valuation of a company, they are
actually referring to market capitalisation.

Market capitalisation simply is the current value of all of a company's
outstanding shares, and is nominally the price that the entire company is
selling for at any given moment.

So, EV measurement is fairer compared to mere stock price in determining the
actual price of the company.

A firm's capital structure is an important factor in measuring the firm value.

The Role of Debt

Why are debt and cash considered in valuing a firm?

If the firm is sold to a new owner, the buyer has to pay equity value (usually
the price is higher than the market price) and repay the firm's debts as well.

Of course, he also gets to keep the cash available with the firm, which is why
cash needs to be deducted.

In other words, to measure EV, the debt and cash is used to gain the natural
value of the firm.

To understand the concept of enterprise value better, imagine two companies
that have equal market caps.

One has no debt on its balance sheet while the other one is debt-heavy.

The promoter of the latter will be making interest payments on debt over the
years. They might have equal market caps but one is worth more.

By the same token, imagine two companies with equal market caps of Rs 5,000
crore and no debt.

One has negligible cash and cash equivalents on hand, and the other has Rs 500
crore in cash. If you bought the first company for Rs 5,000 crore, you'd have a
company worth, presumably, Rs 5,000 crore.

But if you bought the second company for Rs 5,000 crore, it would have cost you
just Rs 4,500 crore, since you instantly have Rs 500 crore in cash.

Like most shorthand measures, market capitalisation is only an imperfect
reflection of a company's current valuation which can be highlighted by another
example.

For instance, if a Rs 25 crore company has Rs 15 crore as long-term debt, an
acquirer would be paying a lot more than Rs 25 crore if he were to buy the
company's entire stock.

It would also have to assume Rs 15 crore in debt, bringing the acquisition
price to Rs 40 crore.

Long-term debt serves to effectively increase the valuation of a company,
making any assessments that take only the stock into account, preliminary at
best.

For long-term debt, every rupee effectively reduces the potential market
capitalisation of a company by an equal amount, as it converts part of the
total capitalisation of the company from equity to debt.

Preferred stock and convertibles that pay interest should also be considered
debt as well for purposes of calculating the value.

Cash and short-term investments have the opposite effect on the value of a
company, decreasing the effective price to an acquirer.

Again, if a Rs 25 crore company had Rs 5 crore of cash in bank, even though an
acquirer would still need to fork out Rs 25 crore to get the equity, it would
immediately recoup Rs 5 crore cash reserve, making the effective price only Rs
20 crore.

Simply put, a large debt load is not good. Although it is true that no company
ever goes bankrupt due to the debt, by converting potential equity value into
debt, a company robs the shareholder in the long-term to finance current
growth.

Additionally, when debt gets onerous and gobbles a good part of the cash flow,
a company ends up being careful while a similar company without debt would grow
aggressively.

By using enterprise value instead of market capitalisation to look at the value
of a company, investors get a more accurate sense of whether or not a company
is truly undervalued.

This is relative to the current price an acquirer would have to pay, not the
arbitrary capitalisation minus any important clarification.

How to Use it

We often find P/E and EV/EBITDA (earnings before interest tax and depreciation)
ratios while reading fundamental stock analysis recommended by analysts.

What is the use of the latter ratio? And what is the difference between the two
ratios?

The P/E ratio is useful to assess whether a particular stock is cheap or
expensive. Many investors only use P/E ratio as a comparison and assume that
low P/E means stocks of a particular company are sold at a low price.

This assumption is not absolutely correct because often a low P/E compared to
the industry indicates that the company has problems.

It is irrelevant to use P/E ratio to assess the company's operational
performance, as the net profit (loss) figures are distorted due to the
application of accounting methods to profit (loss) items or due to an exchange
rate difference.

Therefore, fundamentalists often use EV/EBITDA as an alternative to P/E. This
ratio is obtained by dividing EV (enterprise value) with EBITDA.

EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and
amortization expenses, is aimed at measuring a company's ability to purely
produce cash flow from operational activities.

EBITDA , which is usually taken from the operational cash flow, is also fairer
compared to net earnings in measuring the company's ability to make profit as
it is free from distortions due to the application of accounting methods to
profit (loss) items.

Therefore, EV/EBITDA can be used as an alternative to P/E in deciding whether
stocks of a particular company are cheap or expensive compared to others in the
same industry.

A company's value is sometimes measured in terms of the total funds being used
to finance it. This investment ratio is increasingly used in place of the
price/earnings ratio in the analysis of certain types of companies.

It indicates the economic rather than accounting return that the company is
generating on the total value of the capital supporting it.

Typical companies for which this ratio is appropriate are those that have
borrowed heavily to finance growth, like telecoms companies building a network
or those that have paid large premia for acquisitions or assets.

parent company must be eminently solid, I have a bias toward tracking stocks. I
believe that two main pluses generally far outweigh a main minus. The two main
pluses are the fact that after they start trading they usually get sold off
like crazy to ridiculous prices, because few want the small amounts of stock
they end up with; and the fact that the tracking stock has the resources of the
parent company to rely on, in many different areas, that a similar independent
company often does not have, materially reducing the actual business risk
versus a comparable standalone peer. The main minus is that management of the
parent company may have conflicts of interest and may not let the management of
the tracking stock division act truly independently.

Your comments are insightful . I particularly like the sold off like crazy one.
I know that your analysis of one of the Genzyme tracking stocks was right on

does not prevent a majority or controlling shareholder from restructuring
assets to benefit themselves at the expense of the other shareholders.

Barron's has a positive article on MTP this week:

Power Play

Shares of a Montana utility, soon to be called Touch America, look ready for a
rebound

No one could accuse the brass at Montana Power of having a great sense of
timing. The sleepy utility has traveled a rocky road in its quest to become
a telecommunications outfit boasting a 26,000-mile national fiberoptic network,
in part because its effort has coincided with Wall Street's
disenchantment with such companies.

Nevertheless, chief executive Robert Gannon insists that the strategy will pay
off. And several analysts regard Montana Power's battered stock as a
steal.

Though six months or so behind schedule, the utility's transformation should
take effect next month, when the shares should begin trading on the big
Board under the symbol TAA. (The company will adopt the name of its broadband
unit, Touch America.)

Montana Power will depart the stock market as the final act in a script
outlined in a bullish Barron's piece last year ("Big Sky Telecom," October 9,
2000).

When our article was published, the shares were trading around 32, less than
half their 52-week high. Subsequently, they stumbled further, finishing the
year near 21.

But worse was yet to come. Because of fairly typical wrangling with state
regulators, the company had to revise its timetable for full-scale operations
and thus had to lower its revenue an profit projections.

Not anticipated was the electric-power price surge that hit California and
other Western states late last year. That forced the company to pay eight to
10 times higher prices than normal to contract for power to get on long-term
power-supply contract off its books. Results: a $63 million writeoff.

At the same time, Montana's Touch America unit had to contend with a price war.

The flood of bad news further slammed the stock, which recently was changing
hands around 7. But some industry watchers believe the selling has
been overdone. Several Wall Street analysts have Strong Buy ratings on the
shares and price targets of 20 or better.

A big plus: Unlike most telecoms, Touch America will begin life with no debt
and a fair amount of cash, as a result of asset sales, a rare situation in this
debt-laden industry.

Another plus: The company will be starting with what Gannon believes will be
the lowest-cost fiberoptic system in the industry. Touch America's
comparatively good financial health could help it succeed where others have
stumbled, in part because the price war knocked some small rivals in its
service areas out of business.

In addition, the company's low stock-market valuation eventually could make it
an alluring takeover target, although Gannon says that "we plan to
continue building the company."

A Montana Power shareholders meeting on September 14 is expected to provide
final approval for the sale of the utility's main asset, its electric
transmission and distribution system, to NorthWestern Corp. for $1.1 billion of
cash.

Montana Power already has raised about a half-billion dollars from the sale of
other assets, including power plants, coal holdings and natural-gas and
oil properties. When all debt is paid off, Touch America should begin life with
$350 million in cash.

Touch America sees revenues growing 10% annually over the next few years (down
from an earlier prediction of 25%). This year, the company
estimates, telecom operations will earn about $100 million (90 cents a share)
in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or a 17%
margin on revenues of $590 million.

Additional aspects of EV/EBITDA: An alternative term sometimes used for EV or
TEV is 'Firm Value'...same thing, same calculation. EV/EBITDA is used far more
than PE for merger candidates since the acquiror is buying the total package
[EV] so a low EV multiple provides a possible 'external buyer' cushion unless
there are strong TO barriers. Like PE's EV multiples vary among industries,
vary with growth rates, and sometimes 'look through' quality issues [EBITDA
isn't worth as much when the 'DA' fairly represents replacement/maintenance
capex as when it results from non-depreciating assets like a healthy brand or
quality real estate]. Ebitda shares vulnerablity with Net Income to outsize
growth of receivables and inventory.

Looks like analysts use TEV/EBITDA as some comparative measurement of stock
valuation. Example, on Global Crossing (GX) S&B indicated a TEV/EBITDA of 7 for
2001 and 6 for 2002 to arrive at a target price of $30. I guess the assumption
here is that a buyer is willing to pay TEV for the assets and operations based
on TEV/EBITDA multiple, which itself is subjective. Mmmm ...could it be
analysts use a valuation method (DCF, TEV/EBITDA, PE, P/S) to fit their
purpose.

Ally, A somewhat dark side of using EV/EBITDA measures is the tendency of new

Plenty wrong with ESREF. I'm still holding on though.

Writedowns and losses continue. Here's my take on the negatives with the
company and business:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=15689667&s=esref

For me, I'd only consider owning ESREF as a very small position within a
well-diversified portfolio. And/or perhaps split the bet on ESREF with a bet on
other downtrodden insurance stocks. CNFL comes to mind in the microcap arena.
Maybe UNAM might work. Maybe IPCR, which has recovered from its lows and might
still have some upside with less business risk. All have their problems, imo.
Perhaps one of the larger cap. insurance companies that has been mentioned on
this thread recently might be a suitable offset risk to ESREF.

RRICH4, ITXC stock might work back up. Then again, it might not. Stock is very
low and below cash and with a good story. But it's not alone in its business.
IDT (IDT, IDTb, NTOP) is bigger and also aggressive in that business. And these
stocks sell below cash value too.

I have a position in IDT. I see at least 3 risks with IDT which might apply to
ITXC:

1. While phone transmissions are going to go over the internet, it's not clear
which, if any company (ITXC, NTOP, others), will survive to prosper. That is,
no clear winner seems to be emerging (imo and I'm no expert.)

2. Cash protects the investor. But there's a burn rate. I can't tell when
losses will cease. (I only assume they will.)

3. It's one thing to buy a dollar bill for 50 cents. It's another to have to
wait to cash that bill in for the full 100 cents. That is, I'm a long term
holder of IDT, but patience doesn't seem to be rewarded here.

I suppose I might hedge my IDT bets by buying ITXC, but for now I'll assume -
with no factual backup - that there's room for both companies in the burgeoning
business.

With the market & economy questionable, I have been increasing my positions in
a couple of cash-rich shells.

AMCE is trading at about their cash value ($1.67 per share,$7 million) and has
proven to be a terrific trading vehicle for me for several years now.
Historically has proven to be a good buy whenever it falls to $2 or below.
The CEO has had several big winners in the past (from his personal 13-d's) and
so I have every expectation that whenever he does merge something into this
shell, it will have a lot of upside.

A similar story is CRTQ...former bio-tech company that never made money.
Corporate raider Paul Koether took over years ago and shut down the money
losing stuff. They maintain several dozen or so patents with substantial value.

Company has about $14 million in cash and is searching for an operating
business in addition to finding more partners for its technology.
3 years ago, the then management had this to say about their science
portfolio...

"Cortech's science portfolio has real potential and value:
Over $100 million has been invested in the research and development of the
Company's science, patents, compounds and technology. Cortech has two compounds
already in clinical development (CE-1037 and Bradycor(TM)), another one which
could be rapidly advanced into the clinic (CP-0597), and an additional number
of
other compounds in earlier stages of development. We also have a separate,
unique proprietary technology which we believe could be of use to numerous
pharmaceutical companies in their quest to synthesize protease inhibitors to
treat a host of different disorders. Our compounds have shown preclinical and
clinical promise in such devastating injuries as stroke and traumatic brain
injury, respectively. We believe that these compounds and the science behind
them, if properly handled, offer substantial potential value to Cortech's
investors."

Insiders have a big position and Bio-Tech Value partners does too. The chairman
is 64 so I suspect his timetable for seeing the value realized is not too long
into the future.

I remain bothered that the insider buy/sell ratio continues to be bearish. For
this reason, I am more comfortable buying special situations where the downside
is low & cash is high. In a market like this, they provide "VALUE" in piece of
mind while still providing significant upside from an extrordinary event.

OT: market mechanics curiosity on ETFs.
Recently I've been using an ETF to park cash because my broker pays such poor
rates on cash and I'm not optimistic about bonds. Anyway, so I use VTI which is
an exchange traded fund that represents an interest in the Vanguard Total
Market Index fund. This fund is designed to match the Wilshire 5000. Now the
curiosity: the Amex specialist CONSISTENTLY maintains a 5c bid/ask spread
(i.e., currently $108.23 X $108.28. The specialist does so with a 50,000 X
50,000 size. The mode average daily volume on the ETF is around 30,000 shares
per day.

Why does the specialist offer this kind of size/depth? Is the specialist making
creation units in real time? Or is the specialist simultaneously working
Wilshire 5000 futures/options?

I don't understand the economics of providing this kind of size/depth for so
little spread.

Hi Dale. I'll type a few paragraphs here about GFF, a stock you've bought and
that I have a Very small position in.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=gff&d=t

GFF is a small company that's a conglomerate. Being both a conglomerate and
small too could mean the company doesn't really have the resources to compete
effectively in its various businesses. OTOH, I generally like to look at the
positives of being a conglomerate - if one part of the business is sour, others
might be thriving. Plus sometimes divestiture is a value-enhancing option with
disparate businesses.

GFF is one of the biggest manufacturers and marketers of garage doors (e.g.
Home Depot in retail as well as supporting professional installers and
dealers). It's also in specialty plastic films (used in diapers, for example)
and "telephonics" (a word that when associated with CLECS, fibre optics, etc.
doesn't give much reassurance now).

I bought my position based on downtrodden home building stocks showing
increasing new home sales and my impression that GFF is actually a hidden
defense contractor too because the "telephonics" relate - partly - to AWACS and
other radar and military communications.

The company has increased sales from somewhat over $.5 billion in '95 to over
$1 billion currently. Right now, as the stock is up, the price/sales,
p/earnings, p/book figures look "reasonable" - although not imo,
bargain-basement inexpensive.

I can't recall a single homebuilding-supply company stock that was mentioned
here that has not gone up in price. Although I'm showing a profit in GFF too,
I've been wrong about GFF's garage door business (They had a 2nd q. operating
loss.), and also wrong to be indifferent to their plastics business (which
surprised me with "substantial earnings growth").

I live in a beachy urban area. House building here is exclusively with very
small in-fills and tear-downs. Last week I saw my first super large (my term)
garage doors in a new home under construction. (Larger garage doors to
accommodate those large SUV's.) I have been waiting for this, so I'm hopeful
that GFF's door business will improve if nationwide home construction continues
and these large garage doors become more recognized and more desired.

I continue to hold my GFF position.
fwiw

rjm, you may want to try QuoteTracker (http://www.quotetracker.com) with both

QuoteTracker connects to both of them for Level I and Level II quotes and lets
you track up to 80 symbols at a time instead of their limit of 20 and 24. Gives
you streaming RT charts with tech indicators too.

More importantly, QuoteTracker has integrated trading for both RJT and DATEK,
so if you think trading with them is fast now, you will be in for a pleasant
surprise with QuoteTracker - makes it drastically faster and easier.

I feel that DATEK and RJT are by far the best OLBs for active investors that do
not need a lot of hand holding. As for RJT being bought by Waterhouse, RJT will
continue to operate as an independent unit, so the buyout should not affect RJT
clients.

The difference is that they said they intend to operate RJT as a stand alone

So, I tend to think RJT will remain as it has been for 6-9 months anyway.
Longer term, I wonder if they will just merge it into waterhouse. Depends on
RJTs stand alone profitibility I guess. Is it a stand alone profit center ? If
yes, I dont see why they would mess with it. If no, then they will merge them
with waterhouse and most of RJTs customers will leave.

I wouldnt rule either out...but at this time, I tend to think they will stick
it out as it us.

In fact, I am considering transfering an old Webstreet account to them. From
back in the days that they offered free trades. (What a nightmare they were !)

My level II was right, but the streamer was wrong.

As for the poster than said do value investors need real time quotes....I tend
to think active investors can benefit from both real time quotes & a level II

Might only mean 1-2% but thats 1-2% that I dont qant to give up.

I like level II to see where support levels are and then I can place my below

My level II was right, but the streamer was wrong.>> Quotracker is nice cause
you can switch sources and servers with a click. I love the charting options
since you can draw trend lines on the charts and a good complement of technical
studies is available. And it's ad supported so there's no cost to get into it.
Regarding real-time quotes for value investors: There are those wild panic days
when folks decide they want out at any cost that give the best entries. Seconds
and minutes make a difference. And real-time quotes don't cost a chunk since
several brokers like Datek offer them gratis.

Bob, I have looked at interactive brokers. It's very interesting. I believe
they are for real... I think they have a top-3 position in number of NYSE
shares traded. (I'm doing from that recall... they may even be #1.) Their
minimum commission is $1... this would apply to 100 shares of Nasdaq or NYSE
stock. The problem with them is they won't transfer stock in or out. I doubt
they do IRAs either. Without the transfers if you are long-term buy and hold
for the most part... you are making a big commitment.
