Hi Spekulatius - Any chance that E-Bay and Yahoo merge? If so are the sum of
the parts of more value together than separate? I think there may be more
consolidation in this sector especially as Google cranks up with their new
services.

=============================================================

What do you like in the media sector? I still think the value play is in "WON".
There are rumors that CBS may sell their 12% interest and if this occurs then
WON is in play to perhaps go private. The other large shareholders have already
bailed out at the end of last quarter.

FWIW my last buy in WON was at $7.65 and I think $10 is a fair price for a buy
out and even in 18-24 months I see mid $20's as a fair value. The free flow
cash flow continues to be very good and the 5% dividend is attractive while you
wait. The growth rate sucks but management is working on this.

Other media plays I am watching include DIS but at $29 it is no bargain.

the other day my pal thisistheend posted an interesting link to NAHB data as
follows:

http://www.nahb.org/generic.aspx?genericContentID=531

if you look at that data, we appear to be around the same place we were back in
1990, though it's not identical...the previous situation was exacerbated by the
s&l crisis, but back then, the housing market appeared to bottom out in early
1991, which also corresponds to the lows in TOL

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=TOL&t=my

as such, it would appear to be too soon to be buying TOL...i'd be watching for
those three values to stop falling sharply and start levelling off, and then
start watching for a buy point on the stock...i would think the three values
may not go as low this time as long as the economy stays reasonably strong,
since last time also featured a recession, but it definitely appears to be too
soon to be buying at this point

the key is that when the housing market strengthens again, the stock could move
higher for many years, as it essentially did from 1991 to 2005, albeit with
some significant corrections, so IMHO it isn't about being in at the bottom,
it's about waiting for a pretty good indication that the bottom is already in,
and then getting in for the ride back up

ABT earnings (LT holding) very favorable. I am particular impressed by MSFT.
15% growth this quarter and share count down 6% YoY - this means that
revenue/share is up 21%!. Operating Earnings are up only 25%, despite the

GE's 2nd qtr results are in: cost of sale almost doubled in the latest qtr
results, while earnings before taxation, etc. stayed down with the previous 2
qtrs (3 in a row), operating margin still good at 31%, but finance charges
about 37%, much to high for my taste, which seems strange with zero long term
debt...; last 12 months results indicate less than 0 sales, 33% interest again
but on 194% long term debt (that was missing in the latest 3month qtr
results...could it be the same money reported as 165% free cash - maybe as a
short term loan????) and earnings per share is a negative value. Moving on to
previous 6-month review, negative sales, 37% interest on zero long term debt
and -218% free cash flow (I bet I'm right, they are borrowing cash on short
term notes at high interest (24%?)). It must a be a beauty of a project for a
company of this size and quality to be doing that. Their previous three 6-month
EPS is up, down, up...kinda difficult to predict where they might be in another
6-months, and with a cash flow problem that appears to hurt EPS. Really, you
would be better off considering HANS that just did a 4:1 split and is currently
cheap, assuming their 2nd quarter results holds no surprises...I'd bet on HANS
before I would even consider GE, at least for another 6 months.

for your first post on SI (or at least the first on this name), you might want
to consider waiting until you are sober <g>

since when does GE have zero long term debt? probably never, certainly not in
any of our lifetimes

where did cost of sales double?

you really think they would be taking out short term loans and paying 24%, when
they have billions in cash and short term investments? i'd gladly loan them
money at 15% a year and save them 9%, let me know where to sign up for that <g>

cash from operating activities was 6.7B in the first six months of 2006...they
pay dividends, make various investments and buy back a ton of their own stock,
so this may affect what you see as "cash flow," but they are clearly generating
billions in cash to do with as they please

the rest of your post is largely indecipherable, but i think you are
hallucinating

i find it interesting however that you choose HANS to recommend...inquiring
minds have to wonder.......

in any event, i wouldn't be a buyer of GE, as it doesn't fit the criteria i
look for in an investment, but they are certainly succeeding well at their
business plan

Firstly, let me confirm that I informed bruces2006 of the "Value Investing" web
site.
He has recently embarked on another modus operandi with regard to analysing
stocks, and as such, he is still getting acquainted with, and building up
experience in that regard.
However, I’m not writing this, in any way, on his behalf. I’m sure he’s more
than capable of speaking for himself.

The reason I saw fit to comment here, is because he used a Spreadsheet that I
supplied him with, that downloads financial data and performs necessary
analysis. Needless to say, such a method relies on data being in the same
format whenever it’s downloaded from the web site.

Unfortunately, in GE’s latest set of Quarterly Results, presented in the web
site that I normally use, the numbers for "Cost of Sales" and "Long Term Debt"
were "consolidated" and were therefore out of step from previous reporting.
"Cost of Sales" was reported as the sum of "SG&A" and "CoS", and "Long Term
Debt" was zeroed and was all incorporated in "Short Term Debt".
Being relatively new to the spreadsheet, I suspect that bruces2006 was not
immediately aware of these new "anomalies".

Notwithstanding all of the above, I would agree with him with regard to GE’s
current, general state of financial affairs.
As I see it, GE has far too much Long Term Debt.
From Yahoo’s site we see that GE sits with well over $222bil. of Long Term
Debt, while its TOTAL Stockholder’s Equity sits at less than HALF of that, at
about $108bil.!!
Who owns this company ? Is it the Shareholders or the Banks (Lenders) ?

However, IMO, what’s worse is the effect that this Debt is having on GE’s
Income Statement. In its latest Quarterly we see pre-tax Interest Expense at
$4533mil.
Based on its tax rate of about 18% this becomes about $3720mil., post tax.
That’s about 76% of its Quarterly’s Bottom Line !!

I suggest that the "6.7B" that C.Worth refers to is really "peanuts" when one
puts it into the context of GE’s Debt.

Of course, one doesn’t expect a company such as GE to have no Long Term Loans.
But even if it managed to reduce its debt by some 30% to 50%, that would
certainly put more Dividend into the pockets of Shareholders.
That, IMO, is what one could regard as a positive step in improving that
"business plan" that C.Worth refers to.

After all, one has seen GE’s stock price move sideways to downwards since the
end of 2004. It seems informed investors are not as enthusiastic about GE as
they have been about HANS, whose stock price has increased over 8 fold in that
time.

Let's hope that Jeff Immelt's new "Initiatives" really do show up on GE's
future Income Statements !

In closing, let me say that it’s a pity that certain individuals on this Board
cannot bring themselves to extend a reasonable welcome to a new contributor.
They prefer, it seems, to display an apparent lack of courtesy.

you come here and tell us how we should analyze balance sheets and operating
results like you do, to arrive at only the best stock picks, and you can't even
understand the operations of a company like GE? i suppose any company that
borrows 100B at 5% and loans it out at 12%, thus creating a 7B profit, should
be avoided because they have 100B in debt...if GE eliminated part of their long
term debt, they would reduce their earnings, not increase them

BAC has a market cap of about 230B, a tangible book value of 52B, and long term
debt of 525B...wow, they must be almost insolvent...oh wait, they make over 20B
a year in profits...i know you don't do financial stocks, maybe now we know
why...as spekulatius noted, GE is much less a finance company now than in the

You are completely misunderstanding the role of GE's debt. The vast majority of
GE's debt is attributed to GE Capital, which operates more like a bank than a
manufacturer. GE attributes $11 billion of debt to its core business outside of
GE Capital.

The interest expense of GE's debt is a red herring. GE Capital is a very
profitable business, which operates by borrowing money at favorable rates and
using that to finance its consumer and commercial lending businesses. GE
Capital has ~$290 billion in financing accounts receivables, and ~60 billion in
cash and short term investments, so its net debt is comparatively modest.

Well CrazyPete, I take your point that GE Capital may be the more successful
arm of its business. But the way I see it, GE’s Financial Statements appear as
those of an Industrial type company, and, as such, it has an item for 'Interest
Expense'.

Now, to the best of my knowledge (and correct me if you believe I’m wrong),
'Interest Expense' is what a company has to pay in interest for money that it
has borrowed, irrespective of where it has borrowed it. Therefore it gets
deducted from Turnover. And therefore it will reduce the Bottom Line, and will
also reduce the amount of Dividend that the company will pay to Shareholders
(provided, of course, that it generally pays a dividend, which, it seems, is
the case with GE).
And, apart from the likes of Prefs., Debentures etc.., the only way to make
money from your shares is if you sell them or if you get paid a Dividend.

Taking GE’s last Annual Result as an example, it reported a Bottom Line of
$16.35bil. Its Interest Expense was $15.187bil. before tax, and about
$12.65bil. after tax. Its Dividend Cover was about 1.44. Therefore the amount
that would probably have been allocated for a Dividend to Shareholders would
have been $12.65bil./1.44 = $8.8bil. That would have given Shareholders an
extra dividend of about $0.84c/share, which is an increase of about 77%.

Of course, I wouldn’t expect a company the size of GE to have no debt Interest
Expense. But, for example, by cutting that expense in half, GE’s shareholders
would still have pocketed a potential 38% more in Dividend payment.
You call GE’s Interest Expense a "red herring". Well, personally, I call it a
financial fact.

Needless to say, we each have our own strategy as to how we value a company.
Personally, I like to look at the ratio of LTD to Shareholder’s Equity. If that
is bigger than a certain value I look at how that debt is affecting matters on
the Income Statement, especially with regard to EBITDA. If that’s not too high,
I let it ride. However, in GE’s case, in my opinion, it’s far too high, with
too much of an adverse effect on the Bottom Line, which is the point I was
making in my Message 24421.

It seems, for whatever reason, that investors have not been that enthusiastic
about GE’s stock in the last year and a half. Looking at GE’s chart we see
lower highs and lower lows which, I believe, is defined as a down trend.

?? You still seem to be missing the point. You can insist on treating GE as an
ordinary industrial company if you like, but that is just wrong headed. The
only way GE can reduce that interest expense is by calling in (profitable)
loans, hence reducing its net income despite the reduction in expenses.

GE is currently suffering from "large cap malaise" like many other stocks -
that has not much to do with it's balance sheet. GE was overvalued at 50$ in
2000, has been growing since and but it's undervalued now in 2006 at 32$, IMO.

Roughly 1/3 are it's asset are associated with the financial arm and 2/3 are in
it's industrial business, which is stated pretty clearly in its earnings
report. Since there are no related letters of credit any more both business'
can easily regarded as separate. The debt of the industrial arm itself is
pretty small relative to it's cash flow. besides that S&P gives GE a AAA credit
rating, which pretty much speaks for itself. To compare the numbers of a
(partly) financial company with a manufacturer of goods is nonsense and will
not yield any investment insight, IMO. Enough said. Next topic please.

bruin,

Several months ago we had an exchange of ideas concerning CKSW, a stock I own.
During our discussion I promised to update you on their upcoming earnings
report.

Today they released excellent second quarter earnings. The company was
profitable with positive cash flow and increased their cash position by 800
hundred thousand dollars. They continue to be essentially debt free. Below is
the press release.

Well, speaking for myself, it’s nice to receive a reply from you, Spekulatius.
It’s been quite a while since we exchanged views.

The way I see it, in whatever way GE "makes a living", it’s Total Revenue and
Total Expenses must, to all intents and purposes, be reflected in its Financial
Statements, and most particularly in its Income Statement. I’m sure you don’t
need to be told that.

IMO, what we have with GE is a clever way of incurring ‘cost’, viz. a very high
‘Interest Expense’, in order to reduce its Income Tax burden, seeing as
"Interest Expense" appears before "Profit" on the I.S.

However, this is, IMO, to the detriment of Shareholders, because of the
negative effect it has on a potential Dividend to those very same Shareholders.
I suggest that this may have contributed more to GE’s down trend in stock price
than your contention of "large cap malaise".
Personally, such an ‘esoteric’ reason doesn’t form part of my stock analysis
strategy. I prefer to consider the "hard numbers" that appear in Financial
Statements !
At this stage it seems that GE is far more interested in generating "inner
company wealth", rather than producing greater income for Shareholders.

IMO, if GE stuck more to the business that it knows best, such as manufacturing
things "electric", and produced the same current Turnover, but with far less
Interest Expense, then this would be of greater, personal benefit to
Shareholders in terms of a greater Dividend.

GE could still borrow money from the bank, using its AAA credit, for such
things as Capital Equipment, Marketing of Products, R&D, etc.. etc.., but this
amount, however substantial, could form a far lower percentage as related to
Shareholder’s Equity, which, in turn, would incur lower Interest Expense as is
current, and thereby increase its Bottom Line, albeit that GE may have to pay a
bit more in Income Tax.

Based on GE’s last set of Annuals, I, personally, wouldn’t have much of a
problem with an Interest Expense of about $5bil. Using a 7% ratio of Int. Exp.
to LTD, that would give GE about $70bil. to $75bil. in bank loans. With
everything else staying much the same, GE’s Tax would go up from $3.85bil. to
about $5.7bil.

Its pre-tax Return on Capital Employed would improve to about 10%, compared to
a very slim 5%.
However, more importantly for Shareholders, the value of its Bottom Line would
be of the order of $24bil., adding about 45% to their Dividend Income.

I don’t know about you, but in such a situation I would be more inclined to
consider becoming a GE Shareholder !!

Hi there gcrispin ... thanx for your feedback on CKSW.
Yes, it seems there has been an improvement in their "financial affairs",
considering that they had lost money for 5 Quarters in a row ! At last their
Bottom Line is positive.

As it happens, they do have some long term debt. It's about $2.0mil. Doesn't
sound like much, but it does represent about 20% of S.H.Equity. Not the end of
the world, but one doesn't want it to go too high and adversely affect the
Income Statement, IMO.

Operating Margin, after 6 months, is just into the positive at 0.55%. But this
is up from -7.5%, so things are better.

IMO one would want to see this trend continue for the next few Quarters, in
order to build confidence that CKSW now had what it takes to provide value for
shareholders.

Good luck with your investments as well, especially with CKSW.

They raised yearly revenue guidance from 15% to about 25%. This leads me to
believe that the next two quarters will be in the 8 million dollar range and
will continue their momentum into the end of the year. Earnings will start to
bring down their accumulated deficit and build shareholder equity. I think the

I'm a little late to this discussion, but I think CSCO's management is too
savvy to be eaten alive. I don't own CSCO but I like to look at what companies
they are buying as they are usually ahead of the curve in terms of what they
think will increase their revenues and margins.

That's not to say that CSCO doesn't have competition in their traditional
markets. Probably one way to follow their competition is to see what
joint-ventures are emerging. The Huawei-3Com joint venture is an attempt by a
struggling company to become competitive with CSCO again. The project is doing
well as their revenues are increasing. And COMS isn't the only one looking for
help. Nortel has an agreement with Huawei and Motorola announced one today.

OT advise - Paul you advice to leave the principal untouched in the money

conservative, IMO.
For one, the low yield in the bank account (2.4%) surprises me, as I get 5% in
my 401k plans stable value fund already. It's rippoff and you should point this
out. Fundamentally i like your idea of a large cap fund, as this is an asset
class that is probably undervalued and also less volatile. I would ask her to
put an appropriate percentage of her existing account into this fund (25%) with
the intention to dollar average another 25% next year into this or other funds
available to her. Hopefully this way, she would get positive results from the
mutual fund, which would entice her to take a larger risk and move more of her
account into higher return options.

Paul,

I started my serious long term investing by utilizing DRIPs (Dividend
Re-Investment Programs). The first DRIP that I invested in was my electric
company, Dominion Resources. I started by sending them $50 / month for one full
year, which they kept in a money market/savings account. After one year that
money was used to fund the original investment in their Dividend Re-Investment
Program. Over the course of the next few years I would send them additional
money whenever I had the funds and the stock was temporarily beaten down.

I have since then started two other DRIPS, in Johnson Controls (JCI) and
PepsiCo (PEP). Whenever one of them is beaten down I invest additional funds.
(NOTE to self - looks like a good time to send JCI a few more dollars).

Usually the companies that have Dividend Re-Investment Programs are secure
well-established companies with a long history solid performance. Look at a
10-year charter of JCI to see how an established company can grow over the
years.

I'm not sure what to tell her to do with her company IRA, but I agree that
keeping those funds in a savings account is not a good option. Most companies
that offer IRAs usually have a financial advisor to help their employees choose
what investment options to select. She should talk with her company's financial
advisor. If her company doesn’t have someone she can talk, most banks have
qualified financial advisors.

Whatever she does, she should speak with someone who can take the time to
understand her current situation and tolerance for risk and help setup a plan
for her financial future. The longer she puts off establishing a plan for her
retirement, the fewer options she will have.

Hope that this has been helpful.

Well, Carl, based on what you said, one would assume then that GE was also
quite capable of publishing financial statements in a recognized standard
format. I admit that 24% interest on huge small term debt seems rather unusual
for a company like GE, but then they were also quite capable of profitably
destroying the Hudson river with PCBs, creating one of the largest superfund
sites in the world. The latest qtrly statements tend to cloud the creditability
of GE at a time when the new boss probably needs it the least.

My interest in stock investing is focused on the creditability of a company
based on their historical financial statements as soon as the latest qtrly is
available backwards for at least a year. While this seems immature to most, it
results in well founded investments as opposed to all kinds of speculation.
Therefore, when I discover a well known company publishing erroneous
financials, it seems only reasonable to point out some of the resulting data,
for the benefit of the better informed that may not actually be aware of it, as
it may be a very important point. Mind you, I did not expect to make that kind
of a discovery with GE. Perhaps you could better serve us all by helping me to
understand why it has happened at GE.

So then are you saying the latest qtrly GE financials are correct, that the
bulk of their debt is short term? BTW, their interest expense seems a bit
unusually high (33.6% FinChg/EBIDTA) for a company with 60B of CASH &
short-term debt and 290B in receivables (194% LTD/Shareholders Interest last 12
months). Thing is, this LTD/SH IT handled as short-term debt also happened in
the prior 12 month period with similar percentages for a total period of last
24 months. Therefore, besides the so-called short-term debt, how should one
consider the high % of interest in relation to EBIDTA over 24 months as a
potential investment?

Hi bruces2006. If you haven’t already read them, you may want to have a look at
my posts 24421 and 24441. I felt obliged to comment with regard to the GE
numbers you quoted because I thought that the download into the EXCEL
spreadsheet may have given you "mis-information". Unfortunately the way GE’s
latest Quarterly numbers are reported show zero Long Term debt etc.. at the web
site that we usually use to download data from.

IMO,GE have taken advantage of their GECapital business to the detriment of
Shareholders. They report a massive "Interest Expense" on their Income
Statement which reduces Profit before Tax and thereby reduces their Tax burden.
In addition to that, it also reduces their Bottom Line and the amount that they
may feel obliged to pay Shareholders in the form of a Dividend.
One has to wonder how much of that "Interest Expense" is actually paid to 3rd.
Parties, and how much of it may, allegedly, remain, somewhere, within the GE
‘system’ ?

IMO, if GE made the same Turnover from its traditional business as it now
reports for its current activities, and used its excellent AAA rating to borrow
reasonable amounts of money to improve the business it knows best, then, all
things being equal, Shareholders would benefit to a far greater extent than at
present.
Ironically, Shareholders now have a company whose price has declined in the
last year and a half, and they also receive a dividend that could be better if
GE made more money from aircraft engines and other "electrical" goods.

Personally, Paul, I’d certainly go along with your advice to the lady in
question apropos investing in a "fund" related to Large Cap stocks. I would,
however, maybe narrow it down to something that contained the "Top 40", or
similar.

As an example, in my part of the world, two of the Exchange Traded Funds are
the "Satrix Industrial", which covers virtually the whole Industrial Index, and
the "Satrix 40", which tracks the Top 40 large cap stocks. Over the last twelve
months, the former had a price gain of 19%, while the "Satrix 40" increased
some 36%. The lady in question wouldn’t have had to know anything about the
stock market in order to have received a tax free dividend of 2% (dividends are
tax free over here) and a Capital Gain in excess of what very few highly paid
Fund Managers manage to achieve, after deduction of their "Management Fees" !

IMO, the above is an adequate "2nd. Prize". 1st. prize is to obtain the
know-how, for oneself, as to how to read, understand and analyse an Income
Statement and Balance Sheet, preferably of an Industrial type company. Coupled
with that, would be the know-how as to which pertinent parts of those
Statements reflect a company’s current ability to make ongoing profits and to
provide value for Shareholders. This is not, IMO, "rocket science", but I
suppose it will depend on the individual’s needs and aspirations.

B.K. Myers, et. al.: Thanks, appreciate the opinions. I believe you guys are
right, she should talk with a professional planner or someone skilled in
financial matters. I wonder though how easy or hard it is for someone
unsophisticated in financial matters to find such a person. Everyone should
have someone to bounce planned financial moves off of. For me, I've got my tax
guy and a couple friends (or course my sympatico wife too). For this couple if
they have someone do their taxes , such a person would be a start. (Although,
if he/she does their taxes and sees the money income/outgo and hasn't by now
harped on this couple to start saving/investing better and or directed them to
a financial planner, the tax preparer person isn't going to be of any help now,
I'd venture.)

Not sure if her company has a financial advisory person for someone at her
level - I've read some companies don't want to get involved in this
advisory/counseling thing because they're afraid of liability issues.

I'd say this woman has a lot of "shoulds" ahead of her. She should do something
and deal with husband's apparent spending patterns and live-for-the-day
attitude, she should have a retirement plan of some sort, she should get out of
having a bank-rate savings account as an investment, she should get some help.
I wonder if she can change behaviors established over a long marriage and
working career. Money - the lack of it or the need for it can sometimes be a
strong motivator though.

As an investor in GE, I would be almost indifferent to the high amount of
interest they pay. As I said, GE Capital is a profitable business: GE issues
AAA rated bonds at essentially the lowest interest rate available to a public
company, and loans out that money at higher rates, so it receives >$1 for every
$1 of interest it pays out.

so wrong headed, it is hard for me to make any sense out of it at all.

None of the interest expense remains in the GE system, you boob. If that were
the case, it would not be an expense.

Ok, imagine the following scenario. I own two businesses:

CP Industrial has revenue of $10 and expenses of $9, no debt, giving me $1 in
profit.

CP Financial has revenue of $4 and interest expense of $3 on debt of $60,
giving me $1 in profit.

I made $2. I have a lot of debt and 25% of my expenses are interest -- gosh, I

Don't sweat it, CrazyPete, if you can't make any sense out of it.

It looks pretty simple to me. If one replaces $15bil. Interest Expense with,
say, $5bil. you GREATLY increase the Bottom Line, and Shareholders get A LOT
more in Dividend.
And the company can still borrow +/- $75bil. to enhance their business. Once
again, it still looks pretty simple to me.

But what if CP Industrial stuck to the business that it probably knew best, and
on Total Revenue of $14 it had Total Expenses of $11, due to the lower impact
of LESS DEBT, giving it a Total Bottom Line of $3.
That's a net profit INCREASE of 33% ! So who needs CP Financial ??!!

> If one replaces the $15 billion interest expense with $5 billion...

As long as you're making up impossible scenarios, where GE Capital's cost of
doing business can be reduced by 2/3 without reducing its revenue stream, I
have an even better one for you. If one replaces GE's bottom line with a larger
number, then shareholders will benefit! GE is clearly robbing its shareholders
by not delivering larger profits! Why don't they just make more money??

In my example, CP Industrial is doing the best it can do as a separate entity,
and somehow manages to not be distracted by the mere existence of CP Financial.
Can it do $14 in revenue on expenses of $11? Apparently not, or it would be
doing so: the existence of CP Financial has no impact on CP Industrial's
business (if anything it should help, as a source of cheap capital). And who
needs CP Financial? I do, since $1 is $1, and if CP Financial throws off $1 in
income, I like that. Think of it as just a black box that prints money.
Wouldn't you be better off if you had one of those?

I apologize if my gentle chide offended you. I would have no complaint if you
said you don't like GE's business model, or don't think they are a good "value"
investment at current prices. But the basis of your debt argument is absurd, it
makes you look silly, and it is hard to take any of your prognostications

Yes, that hypothetical industrial co. presumed to be going from $10 to $14
caught my attention too. Trying to remember my experiences with industrial
companies, I suspect that for most industrial companies, if they have to spend
$9 (i.e. the expense) to make $10 in sales, they might not so easily or
possibly be able to get another $4 in sales (40% sales increase) by spending
only $2 more ($14 sale with only $11 expense). Industrials sell something that
has a very high cost-of-goods sold component, so expenses can often remain
high.

IMO, for an Industrial type company to feature in the top echelon it needs to
meet or exceed certain targets based on certain specific financial ratios from
within its Financial Statements. Two of these are associated with the long term
debt ratio in its Balance Sheet and the relationship between EBITDA and its
Interest Expense on its Income Statement.

Based on GE’s current Interest Expense it is failing miserably in this regard.
Yes, it may be making a positive return from issuing bonds, but this is at
great Expense on its Income Statement. If GE was able to generate the
equivalent of even 75% to 80% of the Revenue it obtains from its Capital
business, from its traditional Electrical business, and did this with great
efficiency and superb management control, then we would see far less effect of
Expense on its Income Statement with a concomitant increase in its Bottom Line,
and greater Income for Shareholders.

As far as I’m concerned, I couldn’t care less how GE, or any other company for
that matter, obtained its Revenue as long as it was maximising its profits with
the minimum amount of debt and associated expense.
I don’t have a problem if a company has borrowed money to positively enhance
its business. But there comes a "break-even" point when the affect of that debt
impinges too heavily on its Income Statement.

And whether you’re prepared to accept it or not, the fact of the matter is that
the Market also doesn’t appear to have been that impressed with GE’s
performance over the last 18 months, judging by the fall off in its stock
price.
IMO the Quality of a company’s Financial Fundamentals is reflected in the
medium to longer term trend of its stock price. I don’t sweat the short term
movements, but I do take cognisance of the longer term trend.

Needless to say, you may see GE’s current Fundamental "status" different to me,
and that’s your prerogative.

It seems to me that you and CrazyPete just don’t get the point I’m trying to
make.
GE may be doing very well with its Capital arm, but whatever Revenue it makes,
from whatever source, be it from selling bonds or aircraft engines, the fact of
the matter is that ALL that Revenue and ALL that expense appears in its Income
Statement. And the Interest Expense component is draining away an overly large
amount of Revenue.

If you want to do some simple arithmetic you will find that if GE’s last Total
Annual Revenue of $148bil. was reduced by over 15% to $125bil., and you
pro-rata’d the deductions of CoS, SG&A etc.., and still deducted $5bil. for
Interest Expense, GE’s Bottom Line would be about $19.7bil.
That is still 20% GREATER than the $16.3bil. it achieves with the incorporation
of its Capital Arm.

Therefore, if as you say, GE cannot achieve the same amount of Turnover from
its traditional "electrical" activities, and therefore needs some other source
of Revenue such as GECapital, then I’m saying that by reducing that Revenue
target by over 15% GE’s Shareholders will still be 20% better off than they are
at present.
And one of the "prime movers" in this regard was the drastic reduction in
Interest Expense, which still, however, enabled GE to borrow some $75bil. to
enhance its business.

Now if you still want to see it your way, or any other way, then I suggest we
just agree to differ.

ipso facto: bozo

Try to take a step outside this discussion for a moment. Consider the following
two scenarios:

1. NO ONE understands my simple argument. Yes, yes, I know that GE Capital is
cash flow positive. But if GE could just cut out this business unit, GE could
add BILLIONS to its bottom line due to lower interest expenses. Of course I
understand that profit = revenue - expenses; but I'll ignore the revenue part
of the equation for now. There is no glaring inconsistency in this argument, as
far as I can see. GE's management must be a bunch of yahoos -- no, criminals --
to overlook this: they seem to describe GE Capital as a successful business
unit, and they've actually been trying to grow it! Oy vey!!

2. I might not understand GE's financials.

Which seems more plausible from your point of view?

The fact that GE has dropped in price doesn't itself support an argument for or
against buying the assets and prospects of GE at its now current stock price.

As W. Buffett has said, "You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd
disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right."

I am betting the sharp guys like Mr. Buffett who are buying GE at current

GE (and so they can delve into it elsewhere), or they have no interest in

Dow - I own a small position too -ouch! i think that rising energy prices are
the problem not necessarily high ones. Note that demand was Ok despite high
prices (4% volume growth) but margin were compressed because prices rose slower
than input costs.

Also looking at DOW cash flow statement it looks like Capex has been
consistently equal or lower than depreciation - which means that free cash flow
is very strong. the problem is that quite a bit of the FCF goes into boosting
the underfunded pension plan. Dividend is OK and should provide a floor to the
stock. I think I'll add to my small position. Energy prices may stay high but
they can't rise forever.

I have no problem with your suggestion, or recommendation, Paul. Rest assured,
I, for one, will not be commenting any further along the lines of the current
discussion on GE.

As it stands, I can't think of anything further I could add in an attempt to
make my point, except to say that I agree, 100%, with Mr. W. Buffett's comment
between parentheses, albeit for maybe different reasons than your own.

As I said, in the closing line of my previous Message, I suggest we just agree
to differ and leave it at that.

I follow you...no problem there, but the stability of a company is founded in
how over extended its financials are. Ratings are nice when you can get them,
and certainly interest and debt is not the only factors involved, just the
issues that you guys selected to respond to. The fact of the matter is,
financials cover a broad area, and when one part of it seems to be going
haywire, it may serve as a warning of the pending future. GE may be good for
it, but with this interest/debt issue and a new man at the top, it should
prompt one to watch the next qtr to a year...every kingdom doth fall sooner or
later, nothing is perfect, not even GE. For instance, cost of sales nearly
doubled since the previous qtr while EBITDA is flat to down, operating margin
is down and revenue is flat to down. Where is the EPS for this company? And
cash flow is a wild rollercoaster from one qtr to the next. I do like what you
said about GE Capital, but what I don't understand is how if they make good
money as interest income, why is GE interest going up and not down? But enough
of this...its obvious that you are sold on a name and not the actual
financials.

"But enough of this...its (sic) obvious that you are sold on a name and not the
actual financials."

in your previous post, where you mentioned you had an accounting degree, and
you said you had only used it recently...i would suggest you ask for a refund
on that degree

crazypete understands GE's fundamentals very well, as do the rest of us who
have responded to this discussion, all except you and bruwin (of course i
remain unconvinced that you are two separate people, despite your dissertation
on your supposed socal situation)

in any event, feel free to assume that crazypete is working with the ACTUAL
financials, while you are off tilting at windmills with this absurdity about
cost of sales doubling and such, let alone the idea that "ratings are nice when
you can get them," as if such things are assigned without careful
consideration, especially in the case of an AAA rating

like the rest, i think the GE discussion has served its purpose...it has
certainly shown the folly of someone coming here espousing a system based on
following a company's reported results, and then not even understanding a
fairly basic set of such results...if you need a letter of recommendation for
your accounting degree refund, let me know...or just copy and paste the posts
from this thread, that should be plenty of evidence for your claim....LOL

Added to my starter position in SVU (Supervalu Inc,). They reported earnings
which disappointed and lowered their 2007 earnings estimate from $2.60 to
$2.20.

Several analysts were positive on the stock after their acquisition of ABS. SVU
was able to cherry pick the best and most profitable stores and ended up with
some excellent real estate assets. They should be able to generate stable
earnings from these new properties that in time will demand a higher market PE.

Stock is being sold off on this news and is trading at a PE of 12 based on
their reduced forecast.

SVU also adds a defensive issue to the portfolio which should benefit from a
minor slow down in the economy.

CrazyPete, I was giving some thought to our recent debate and the "firm stand"
that each of us took. It seems to me that it’s not a case of who is right and
who is wrong, but rather a case of how each of us may be viewing the financials
of a company from our own investment standpoint and criteria requirement.

I suspect that you’ve done a lot of homework studying the Financial Statements
of a company such as GE and have come to the conclusion, quite correctly, that
the company is making money based on the business model it has adopted. If it
wasn’t, then its Bottom Line would be negative.

You may also believe that the company is doing as well as can be expected,
within its business model, and you are therefore prepared to remain a
shareholder.
If I was asked to "define" your approach, with regard to GE, I would say that
it was not dissimilar to a view taken ‘FROM WITHIN’ the company, such as what
the Directors and CEO, would very likely have.

However, my approach could probably be described as a "dispassionate" investor
looking at a company, such as GE, ‘FROM OUTSIDE’ the company. I’m looking for
companies to invest in whose business models and financial results indicate
that those companies have adopted the best modus operandi, based on their areas
of expertise, and in addition to that are making excellent profits and
providing excellent value for shareholders, both in terms of Capital Gain and,
where possible, Dividend Income.

In this regard, I measure any company up against, what could probably best be
described, as a "Template of Excellence", consisting of several target
percentage ratios obtained from within its Income Statement and Balance Sheet.
A company that doesn’t, simultaneously, meet, or exceed, those requirements
doesn’t pass 1st. base.

As a result, several stock screens that I use, based on this principle, will
only spit out between, say, 20 or 40 companies from the over 8000 Industrial
type companies on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. Further "pruning" is always
necessary because screen web sites don’t always have the exact criteria one is
looking for, so one has to "compromise" somewhat !

Anyway, what really matters at the end of the day is that we all make a healthy
return on our investments, utilising whatever method(s) suits us best.

I don't think this really describes our fundamental disagreement.

I would say that you are guilty of "drinking your own bathwater" here. You've
developed a strict set of filters that enable to you screen 1000s of companies
down to a couple dozen "good apples" that you can reasonably investigate. These
filters by necessity are going to knock out all sorts of great companies that
don't fit your narrow financial model. That's fine: you're not greedy, you
don't need to find all the good apples in the universe, you just want a few.
But to then say that an apple is bad because it doesn't meet your criteria is
too large a leap.

Specifically, any financial services company will fail your debt and interest
expense criteria. That may well be a price you're prepared to pay (throwing out
ALL financial services apples, good or bad), because the screen does a better
job with other sorts of companies. Just don't argue that [GE, C, JPM, BAC, etc]
all are bad companies because they violate your debt ratios, because that is
nonsense.

Typically US stock have benefited from a safe haven status in times if unrest.
Foreign stocks may not be a safe haven to shield from the interest rate hikes
either since in most cases interest rates move in lockstep in many countries.
That being said, i prefer to buy stocks based on their individual merits rather
than perceived country risk. From a value investor perspective, none of the

Agreed, and being the novice that I am, that is to be expected. In fact I have
yet to find a stock that does not have a significant problem, one way or
another. But then not all the 2nd qtrly results are posted either, so there is
still hope. Mind you, it is not just the qtrly results I examine, but also 6
months back and 12 months back, for low P/E, high turnover, low interest, low
debt, high operating margin, high cash flow, and a steady rising EPS. What I
have found in comparing backwards across 5 qtrs or 5 yrs results is increasing
growth in several of these for a few companies, but perhaps a bad latest qtrly
turnover or very low op margin or no EPS...not very encouraging for retirement
income. Maybe you know of an exception worth the microscope?

Thanks, gcrispin, and as bruwin has explained to me they have no respect for

pursuing, at least without a lot more experience with sound USA stocks first.
Do you know any you would kindly recommend me looking into? BTW, I am not

In my attempt, CrazyPete, to keep my reply brief, let me just say that I
believe my screening process may not, initially, uncover those companies that
have the POTENTIAL to be great. But it will go a long way to finding those
companies that, CURRENTLY, are exhibiting those qualities associated with an
ability to make and supply above average profits and value for shareholders.

Needless to say, this is an ongoing process. What you don’t uncover today, may
very well appear in several months time as new financial results become
available. I certainly don’t "get married" to my stocks. Everything is always
under constant review based on the quality of their numbers.

And because a company doesn’t, currently, meet my criteria, is in no way to
suggest that it’s "a bad" company. It just means that, in my opinion, there are
other companies that are more likely to provide a better return for my
investment over the medium to longer term. Which is why my own stock portfolio
tends to have far fewer stocks in it than those of others, due to my attempt to
choose the "best of the bunch".

I have that one on my watch list after your mention, but after finally deciding

on getting my price, and I never bought. Missed the recent stock price move and

Wallace Weitz on United Health Care
Posted by: gurufocus Date: July 18, 2006 04:48PM

UnitedHealth Group is a terrific business whose scale and sophisticated use of
technology give it significant competitive advantages. It is growing rapidly
and has been a Wall Street favorite (i.e. too expensive for us) for most of the
last 10-15 years. We were able to buy it last year during a period of weakness
when the threat of shrinking profit margins frightened investors. As those
fears faded and the stock returned to our estimate of intrinsic value, we sold
most of our shares. During the 2nd quarter of this year, a competitor?s
disappointing results and investigations into UnitedHealth?s UnitedHealth?s
option granting practices led to a decline of over 30%. We believe that
investors have over-reacted and that at $45, or 12-13 times 2007 earnings, the
stock is very attractive.
