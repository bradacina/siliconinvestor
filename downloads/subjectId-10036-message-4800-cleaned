For Value Investing, how about a small Semi stock called Neomagic (NMGC). They
are beginning to dominate the laptop industry and are probably a year or two
years ahead the competition. All major laptop makers (Dell, Toshiba, Compaq,
etc...) use NMGC's chips. Earnings have gone up, yet the stock has not. And all
Firms have "Buy" or "Strong Buy" recommendations. One drawback is that NMGC is
currently a "one product" company; however, I believe they will be announcing
some new products coming soon. Also, competition is always fierce in the semi
industry.

IMO, this stock deserves to be trading in the mid-$20, yet it is currently
trading in the mid-teens. What's your opinion?

Thanks Jim: I like 'em! Thread: here's Paul Senior's Million Dollar Tip for
knowing that you aren't beating the market:

You will find this out at tax preparation time if you are alert. It will take
you several years possibly to get to be alert. A clue is that your tax preparer
goans (-g-)when he/she sees your Schedule D.

Three things will happen to tell you you need to change:

1. You will look around for a second page for your Schedule D returns, because
you will need it to complete the many trades in gains/losses for Short Term
Trades (assets held under 6 months).

2. Your trades for Long Term Capital Gains/Losses easily fit on the 6 or 8
lines provided by the Schedule D form.

3. Your net of Long Term Gains/Losses is a gain. The net of short term
gains/losses is either a loss or a small gain (that is, net short term profits
are less than net long-term profits)

Corollary: On schedule A, your margin interest expense is larger than your
mortgage expense deduction.

This isn't about the tax consequences of the capital gains tax. It's about
trading vs. investing, and making money.

I like your rules, but I still maintain the goal for value investors should be
short-term holds, not long-term holds. The more trades, the more times you are
realizing value within a reasonable time frame (ie your stocks are moving up
rapidly rather than slowly). This may be my year of fewest trades, and it may
turn out to my worst.

To trade or not to trade, what a question. I have been telling myself I am
overtrading, but when a short term opportunity goes up I sell it. And I have
also been doing some market timing which has worked. So I've paid some
commissions, and will pay a good amount of taxes next year. But every time I
look back and say would I have been better off not selling these stocks when I
did I realize I did the right thing. I've only been doing this for a few years,
so I am still learning. But I am with Mike on this one. If the stock moves to
your price, you sell it. And, as he said yesterday, if you are constantly
buying short term plays that turn into long term holds, you're doing something
wrong. Not to say I don't have a couple Buffett stocks in my portfolio which I
am very reluctant to pay taxes on. But I have been making about 25 trades a
year on a portfolio of 8-12 stocks. That looks horrendous, but it has worked
for me. Would I prefer not paying taxes? Sure. But is my performance
satisfactory after-tax? Yes. So I'm trying to move in that direction, but will
still not refuse a quick 30-50% gain in a net-net.

My problem is different. I try to buy stocks that I can see a double
in two to 3 years - like I would see in buying NH at $11. I often am right and
the stock rises perhaps 1/3 in a few months. I am happy to continue to hold for
the other 2/3, except that in this market I see
it more often than not turn around and go below my purchase price -
which generally describes a rally in a bear market.

I am a longer term investor not a trader and I see nothing wrong with this
approach, except that it is giving lousy results, because I am just buying
intermediate term bottoms. By the way the last time I can remember this
happening was in 1973-74, when $100 stocks had intermediate term bottoms every
ten points down until they hit 50%
or less of the starting price - rather like Case, except that every stock was
like that.

I share jeffrey's problem. I have been fortunate with a few stocks that have
rebounded from the lows at which I purchased them but instead of selling for a
decent gain in a short time frame I have held to watch them trade sideways or
slowly decline. Conversely, I sold a stock called Ingram Micro (IM) which I
bought soon after its IPO only to watch it go higher as it expanded overseas.
Granted it is what I would call a growth stock (not sure if it is a Buffett
stock) so I can't compare it to the stocks I considered value stocks. But it
emphasizes the point that I need to remember why I bought the stock in the
first place in order to know when to sell. My favorite growth stock, Tyco
(TYC), has declined with the market but since I have faith in management and
continued growth through acquisition then I will surely hold and perhaps add to
my holdings. While most equities are declining right now I've found that a mix
of strategies has rounded out my performance and I've slept well. That is, as
long as I can remember which stocks are value and which are growth <g>

Michael:

I am very very aware of what constitutes Graham and Buffett methods, but I
think we are both talking "around" one of my central points.

You are talking about long term holding, but you haven't defined long term. And
of course what we describe as "long term" in investing is at odds with economic
long term. But looking at Graham, or for a more contemporary example, Dreman,
fair value is not usually expected in a few months. If somebody wants a
realistic shot at that, they had better limit themselves to very large,
well-known companies. But more generally, we have to be accepting of holding
periods on the order of 2-4 years. I'm not saying that we should look to hold
that long, I'm saying that we should expect that it may take that long in many
(most) cases. BTW, the results I gave are for companies held under that
duration, so without my specifying the selection method, nobody can accurately
infer whether they were Buffett or Graham style picks.

The reason I am hammering on this issue of holding period is that given the
inherent volatility of the market (not just today, but historically) and all
the things that can go wrong, it is unrealistic to expect to earn extraordinary
returns quickly on any kind of consistent basis. If you can give me any
examples of any "value" investor who has done so, I'd be most interested.

This ties in to the margin of safety. Where is the margin of safety in a
company that you couldn't hold for a few years - knowing that, like it or not,
market conditions might make such a holding period essential for practical
purposes?

Oh I know you are. I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying. I don't think I
need to define long-term, though - any attempt to do so is arbitrary. I'll buy
a company that is undervalued for any number of reasons and when I buy it I'll
have a target. I want that target hit sooner rather than later. Part of a
margin of safety is knowing that the company will be there for a while, and
part of it is the potential to go up in a reasonable time frame.

Speaking of trading, I had 30% turnover today alone - I flipped St.

also very interesting to me, considering I sold St. Joe outright on
Friday...right at the market bottom at noon. (To be fair to myself, I sold 500
of my 600 shares of JOE in the 30s. But that last 100 had psychological
significance because I intended to hold them forever. I don't recognize my own

I'd go one step further - without this, there is no margin of safety. Because
like it or not, we may have to hold it for a while.

We just have to be realistic as to what constitutes a reasonable time frame.
Companies, especially small ones, can be underpriced for years. Our margin of

Re: reasoning. I own 4 stocks that have killed me this year: Deswell, New
Holland, YPF, and St. Joe. To me, NH and CSE are interchangeable at current
prices. St. Joe and FLA likewise. I switched solely to lock in some tax losses
with virtually no penalty to the upside.
Irony of ironies, I actually had some realized gains this year that I wished to
offset. I also have some untaxed income from Microsoft, so all in all
converting my "paper" losses to real losses doesn't hurt and probably helps.

The YPF/Telebras switch is not so simple, but basically includes the above
reasoning, and Deswell I just can't sell and will probably buy more. I'm still

Perhaps we are talking about someone who doesn't pay US taxes? Or all these
funds are in tax-deferred accounts? Or we're back to market drops: if the
market drops 20% and your stocks drop only 15% and in addition, you get to take

Mike, Jim:

One interesting strategy is to trade, say, Case, NH and Deere back and forth
yet always maintain a long position in the industry

Say you think all are good companies and all have pretty much the same
prospects, which you like. Decide within yourself the relative valuations
between the 3, e.g. Case= 1.2x NH NH = 1.43x Deere.

Commit to the industry by buying the stock which is at the lowest price
relative to the others at the moment.

As the market prices stray from the "correct" relative valuations trade them
back and forth as their market prices vary up and down relative to one another.

But always maintain the net long position you committed to early on.
Stay invested in one of the three at all times for the 2 - 4 years until all
are over-priced (i.e. market recognizes how damned smart you are!).

It works! You can play the market gyrations and be a long-term investor
simultaneously.

Sort of like being married and having a mistress! But, don't start thinking the
mistress would make a good wife. Stay long the industry at all times. You
married her, stick with her until she bears fruit and the kids are in med/bus

Peter M.: I've often found in that situation that Senior's Rule of Mispick
applies: Which is: whenever there is a choice of 2 or more stocks in an
apparently undervalued industry, picking the most obviously undervalued company
results in that company remaining the most undervalued (while the others will
experience substantial rises in price.)
In this particular industry, rather than betting on one or the other or all
manufacturers, I chose RDO, a company which is a distributor for several ag.
manufacturers. Company also is in construction equip. (sales/leasing), and big
trucks. Their goal is to be a national consolidator of local franchisees. RDO
has not as appealing valuations now as NH or some of the others- but the offset
might be its diversification and IMO, strong management. Paul Senior

Until very recently I had been seeing some bargains, but the companies were not

thinking that I might have to break down and buy a small basket of good (not
great) companies at bargain prices. But now it looks as though the great
companies will become available and I should just be patient.

It is kind of ironic. I used to invariably be able to count on a stock falling
another 10-20% after I bought it. Then I got a tiny bit smarter, realized I was
in too much of a rush to grab bargains, and started to instead enter GTC orders
for prices below the available bargain prices. This way I both got cheaper
prices and wasted less time watching the market. But right now I'm glad I
haven't entered any such orders yet. I will, but this may be a great time to

-Stock is at $6 today
-Good earnings (.22) announced Friday.
-Recently purchased Simplicity Patterns Co., a well-known brand name.
-Chairman Cary Findlay just took over as Pres./CEO again.
-Findlays, both accountants, are very sharp owner/mgrs and own 42% of the
company, recently added more.
-Sales last 12 mos: $125 million (about half Simplicity, half Conso).
-Profits have been hurt by competition last year but appear to be improving
again.
-Margins have historically been much better in tassels/fringe than for typical
textiles, though battered last year, and improving now.

It's an obscure stock in a lousy industry, but it looks pretty darn cheap to

it's just marginally interesting with everything else on sale at the same time.

PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 27, 1998--Ocean Castle Partners, LLC
announced today that it has proposed a new slate of directors to replace the
existing Interactive Flight Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ Smallcap: flyt) Board
pursuant to a solicitation of consents in lieu of an annual meeting of
shareholders. The Board proposed by Ocean Partners would be committed to
increasing shareholder value for ALL shareholders of Interactive Flight
Technologies, Inc.

Ocean Partners has entered into an agreement with other shareholders, whereby
Ocean Partners and its affiliate currently have proxies to vote and thereby may
be deemed to beneficially own approximately 33.8% of the Company's outstanding
voting power.

Ocean Partners has filed preliminary consent solicitation materials with the
Securities and Exchange Commission asking fellow shareholders to support an
immediate replacement of the Company's current Board of Directors. Ocean
Partners intends to begin soliciting consents from Interactive Flight
Technologies, Inc. shareholders as soon as it clears SEC comments on its
solicitation materials.

The Ocean Group has proposed the following three candidates for the Interactive
Flight Technologies, Inc. Board:

IRWIN L. GROSS, 54, a founder of ICC Technologies, Inc., a publicly held
company listed on NASDAQ National Market, which is currently engaged in
Internet related technology, was the chairman and a director since the
Company's inception in May, 1984. Since 1988, ICC has been engaged in the

Gross retired from that company in July, 1998 to pursue an array of investment
strategies. In addition, Mr. Gross had served as the chief executive officer of
Engelhard/ICC, a joint venture between ICC and Englehard which was the
successor to ICC's business and which ICC Technologies, Inc. from its formation
in February, 1994 to its restructuring in February, 1998, was a fifty percent
(50%) partner with Engelhard Corporation. In February 1998, Engelhard/ICC was
restructured. In April, 1998, ICC acquired by merger Rare Medium, Inc. which is
an Internet service provider. Mr. Gross was also a founder of Interdigital
Company (AMEX) and served as a director and executive vice president until
April, 1984. Mr. Gross has served as a consultant to, investor in and director
of, numerous publicly held and private companies. Mr. Gross also serves on the
board of directors of several charitable organizations. Mr. Gross has a
Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting from Temple University and a Juris
Doctor degree from Villanova University.

CHARLES T. CONDY, 58, had been a director of ICC Technologies, Inc. since June,
1996. Mr. Condy is the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Next
Century Restaurants, Inc., a private company which is the owner of Aqua, and
Charles of Nob Hill, both of which are in San Francisco. He is founder and has
been chairman and chief executive officer of Proven Alternatives, Inc., a
privately held international energy management company, since 1991. Mr. Condy
was chairman and chief executive officer of California Energy Company, Inc., a
geothermal energy company which he founded in 1971, and which became the
largest geothermal energy company in the world. Prior to founding California
Energy Company, Mr. Condy was executive vice president-Western region of John
Nuveen and Company, members of the New York Stock Exchange. In the public
policy area, Mr. Condy helped found and has served as board member of the
Business Council for Sustainable Energy Future and the Coalition for Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. Mr. Condy currently advises the U.S.
Department of Energy, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the
U.S. Asian Environmental Partnership on energy efficiency technology transfer
and related funding to developing economies.

STEPHEN SCHACHMAN, 54, is presently a private consultant and is the owner of
his own consulting firm, Public Affairs Management, located in the suburban
Philadelphia area. From 1992 to 1995 he was an executive officer and consultant
to Penn Fuel Gas Company, a supplier of natural gas products. Prior thereto, he
was an attorney with the Philadelphia law firm of Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish &
Kaufman. Mr. Schachman was also executive vice president of Bell Atlantic
Mobile System and prior thereto, president of the Philadelphia Gas Works, the
largest municipally owned gas company in the United States.

Ocean Castle Partners, LLC is a recently formed Delaware limited liability
company, in which Irwin L. Gross is the president and sole member.

CERTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Ocean Castle Partners, LLC ("Ocean Partners")
will be soliciting consents for the proposals set forth in its Preliminary
Consent Statement currently on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The following persons may be deemed to be participants in the
solicitation by Ocean Partners: Ocean Partners which may be deemed to
beneficially own 2,231,111 shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock which
represents approximately 33.8% of the outstanding voting power of the Company
and Irwin L. Gross who could be deemed to beneficially own the above described
shares of Class B Common Stock, as well as the beneficial owner of 52,000
shares of Class A Common Stock. To the best of Ocean Partners' knowledge, none

Southeast Asia accounts for less than 3% of revenues
They have enough of a presence in developing markets to be aware of and take
advantage of opportunities in the aftermath of this crunch, but not so much

So while they may go lower as you mention due to the perception that they are

Nice list of ideas, each of which has some merit - I know a lot of those. I
would point people especially toward Armstrong World (ACK) - I don't know when
it stops falling, but the stock is extremely cheap.

I know we don't do macro here, but this market is sick. We will probably get a
bounce tomorrow, but I don't think it holds. The psychology has completely
changed. I don't think we are in an atmosphere of total cataclysmic fear yet
(which is my buy signal), so I am still parked happily in cash, but we're
getting closer. At noon today the S&P broke through what looked like firm
technical support at 1055 like a knife through butter. I normally don't do
technical analysis, but this one was something everybody on Wall Street was
watching carefully. You don't want to get on the other side of that. In my
view, forget Russia - what happened today was two things:
1) The support on the S&P broke down decisively. Now institutional investors
are looking at another 15% drop on the S&P before they see technical support.
If that doesn't matter to you it should, only because it matters to the guys
who are doing the buying and selling in big stocks.
2) The "buy the 10% dip" rule was shattered today. All the guys who followed
that rule are looking at two things tonight: i) losses for the first time and
ii) no more cash to buy the next dip.

So who buys that next dip? People with cash. Institutional value investors were
raising cash today. What does that tell you about when they (we) are going to
come in to rescue this market? In my view, if this accelerates tomorrow (or
maybe even if it doesn't) I forget about the basket case businesses we've been
calling value stocks and set my target on top quality companies at blackmail
prices. That means start doing your homework on businesses you've only watched
from afar up to now.

Anybody who has an account with Fidelity saw Peter Lynch's writeup in the
brochure they sent yesterday. When Peter Lynch is calling for the Dow to fall
to 7000...Houston, we've got a problem.

I'll just take cheap whatever the business. I think that Buffett companies have
a long way to fall before they become attractive again as buys. They're just
exiting "sell" range and entering "hold" range. Coke will fall to 60 and people
will say cheap. Yeah, well, I thought it was overpriced at 50.

So for now I'm taking my own advice and looking within my own portfolio. I've
added to Deswell, Telebras, General Cigar and Midway. Deswell and Telebras are
completely falling apart. Barring an unlikely dividend cut thanks to Deswell's
cash hoard, it now yields over 10%.

I also took new positions in Agouron, Incyte, and Tidewater.
Agouron - a premier biotech - is getting killed with the rest of biotech and
now sells for less than 1.5X trailing sales as they explode upward. Incyte I've
already discussed. Tidewater is simply the most debt-free, free cash flow-rich
boat/oil services operator. In a downturn invest in the biggest, right? There's
insider buying and a stock buyback.

For what it's not worth, now I have people telling me that the world is
crashing and that people just don't understand. There were over 2 billion in
outflows last week from stock funds. The headline in the local paper screamed
"Meltdown!" and everyone is talking about the market crashing. I'm seeing
people fleeing, which may do more technical damage, but I don't see the
fundamentals in my stocks deteriorating as much as the change in market value
would seem to warrant. I'm happy to pick up Brazil's telecomm system for 6
times earnings if people are willing to sell it to me.

I'm not necessarily looking to make purchases from that group. I was tempted to

some cream companies if they become available.

Of that batch, DE is pretty dominant, and CA is certainly strong, so I might be
inclined to put in some low ball GTCs on those. Of the midcaps, the ones I like
best actually aren't the cheapest. I happen to like Nalco Chemical on a
qualitative basis, and I can certainly envision their business of being one of
growing import, but it isn't the cheapest. Fleetwood has certainly been running
their business pretty well, and demographics favor them, but again they aren't
as cheap as the others. Avnet is cheap, and despite the low margin nature of
their business, it would seem their biggest threat is a slow economy.

Oh I think off-balance sheet liabilities are real, but then there's a
definition problem - is Y2K a legitimate liability for the company. If so, is
it a liability for me as an investor? There's also a quantification problem.
How big is the liability for a specific company? And how much will the stock
price be affected?

Saying emerging market stocks are way behind the curve and throwing the baby
out with the bathwater doesn't make sense to me. The way I see it Telebras just
got bought out by a bunch of entrepreneurial-minded businesses with foreign
capital and expertise. So they are ignoring Y2K? More than likely they and the
Street have already planned it into there capital budgets. If not, to what
degree are they ignoring it? And if so, why - stupidity or intelligence? To
what extent will this ignorance or knowledge affect the stock? Amazon has three
"be afraid" books on Y2K:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/generic-quicksearch-query/002-0330126-8761465
I flipped through one - awfully gloom-and-doomish - I don't buy the scenario.
It's the most popular "the world is coming to an end" factor discussed in the
media, and everyone is talking about it. In my book, if anything it's already
been discounted.

Even if Y2K has significance, one has to figure that emerging markets as a
whole are already discounted from the US for reasons such as Y2K. The market is
already telling me I can buy the future of Brazilian telecom for 6 x
earnings/2.5X cash flow or buy the future of American telecom for 20 x
earnings? So certain American advantages are already implied. But then there's
Americans in at Telebras too, and I don't find AT&T's earnings worth three
times Telebras' earnings.

What's this? Am I one of the few actually buying these companies? TOY is a buy.
You are seeing a couple of professional value investors - if you are diligent

position back up again (started in '95, sold most in '97 and '98). Two years

Cooper Tire is a buy. Right, it's a mundane company. But it can and does make

and I have, as I've posted here before.

Not saying these are companies for anyone else to buy. Prices on some of these

Ah Ha. " Beating the market is the only goal for individual stock pickers."
Maybe being a stock picker is not the whole story for investors who want to
beat the market and preserve capital. Four strategies which I have successfully
used are:
1 Placing option writes against the stock held long. Long term option ratio
writes have been very good to me.
2. Taking a position in stocks for which a cash buyout offer has been made.
3. Establishing a position in a desireable stock thru a put write.
4. Selling out of the money naked calls on dogs.

Mix some of these strategies along with value stock and bond purchases and you
will likely lose much less in times such as we are now experiencing while
generating profits to offset "Stock Picking" losses. The name of the game is to
beat the market but not necessarily just with stock picking.
I would invite the astute members of this thread to suggest some other
strategies which could be used to augment the results which occur from stock

Here's my clue to tell when distributors are cheap: NO distributor is cheap
unless it sells below book value. After all we are talking about companies that
essentially distribute somebody else's stuff (even if they do use sophisticated
billing, inventory, distribution to do it. So the ROE they can earn is limited
by and related to their book value). This confluence (price<bv) does
occasionally happen. From what I see (and I'm not following all the players)
the only sorta cheap co. is Marshall (MI), and in this market, it still doesn't

Y2k impact on the investor: Speaking generally, y2k remediation hits the income
and cash flow as expenses, as would after the fact litigation. Downtime hits
earnings directly.
Nothing I've said is directly related to Telebras. I haven't studied the co and
you may be completely correct that this issue is more than discounted in the
price. The thrust of my comments is that for the next 2 years y2k has the
potential to bite the unwary investor and when you see pricing that looks too
good to be true, y2k could be an underlying reason.
Submerging market stocks are sometimes priced based on different perspectives
than in the US. It's tough to find reliable data on stuff like earnings, book
value, cash flows. Y2k estimates are even further down the line. Creative
accounting is often a national sport. Stuff goes up just because it's going up
- wait a minute, maybe it's more like the US than I thought.

Sorry to ramble, just thought this was an issue to consider.

Mike, Y2K is a very real liability. If you know its there, you might as well
subtract that cost (the whole cost, including loss of customer goodwill if
things blow up) from the valuation. When major airline A told me Y2K is going
to cost $250 million, and a week later major airline B told me it will cost $30
million, I sold B immediately. But it is so hard to calculate. The best way I
have found is to call competitors and ask what they're doing. Consider the most
conservative estimate (i.e. the highest) the most realistic, and also assume
that that number is too low. And don't assume its discounted in prices. It is
not in my opinion. I read Wall Street analysts all the time and live in the
world of insitutional investors, and believe me, everybody is talking about it
but nobody knows what to do with it, so they just ignore it (kind of like stock
option dilution - another future liability which is not difficult to quantify -
and don't assume a bear market will solve that one, many companies are already
feeling out investors about repricing their options. Directors who do that
should be shot in my opinion.)

Cendant may be very interesting. It is just so hard to sort the wheat from the
chaff in this one. Which numbers can you believe and which can't you believe.
And are there investments with similar upside out there now without the
uncertainty?

TOY may be a buy just because everybody hates it. And it is unquestionably the
industry leader. If that is your standard, you also want to look at IBP, NUE,
ACK, TRN and HPH. But looking at a firm which has squandered its franchise for
10 years makes me wonder if there is a franchise to begin with. Maybe you make
your toy play on MAT if it drops another 20% in a panic.

I am in no hurry to get back into the market. I see no sign of a bottom, so I
am spending my time patiently putting together a wish list of great companies
which I have always wanted to own, but were nowhere near my price. If the
market drops 25% further and some of them get there, I want to be ready to buy
them immediately. It is a hard transformation for somebody who has resigned his
analysis to $10 million market cap loser shoe companies at net-net valuations
with the hope of a 30% gain. This is when I shift into Buffett mode. Some
financial companies are starting to get interesting.

Of course, A's systems could be 10 years old and need to be completely redone.
B's up-to-date systems could need smaller changes. In the end, unless you want
to dig deeper - e.g. ask what the approach is, what changes are needed, compare
what has been spent on IT over the past 10 years, etc. - you probably just have
to trust the company. It does not seem realistic to judge by a quoted cost
alone. There's probably a lot of "scapegoating" going on when accounting for
Y2K costs. Y2K write offs are probably going to be the tax bonanza of 1999.

Paul, off topic, for some reason I couldn't get a message to send over the Jean
thread so I thought I would answer here:

Sorry to take so long to get back to you. I took a look myself at Toys-R-Us and
Petco, and both look like like good buying opportunities to me. My "retail
expert" can't comment on Petco as although we have a dog, we keep her outside
and don't do much pampering. So she is not familiar with their stores.

As far as Toys-R-Us, she has been down on them for the last 4 or 5 years and
has talked me out of buying the stock myself when it was at around 25 or 30 (a
couple years ago?). She says that their stores need upgrading and that Walmart
& Target continue to expand their toy aisles. She says Walmart now has all the
hot toys as soon as Toys-R-Us or before, they have a excellent selection of the
major items like legos and Barbie, and they expand their toy section during the
pre-Christmas season by taking over seasonal space like the "back to school"
aisles.

So on a long term basis, she doesn't like Toys-R-Us due to the competion and
old stores. However, as I said, the value looks very good right now and
retailers margins are slim and manipulateable (don't know if thats a word) such
that slight improvements can result in super good growth.

Hope you are doing OK through this market downturn. The market has really
gotten interesting. I keep a plot of the Russel 2000 and S&P 500, and the
Russel 2000 appears to me to be at the best buying level since the fall of
1990. For the first time in years, I have bought some shares on margin
(although only 5%). If the market continues down into October, we may have the
best buying opportunity since 1987 (although I can't say I recognized it at the
time).

Have a good day.

It is unlikely that a company would undertake to spend a billion

getting the shares at over a 40% discount to what the market paid
for them back at the privatization. Moreover, Telebras has excellent
disclosure, not the least because of its privatization. They provide monthly

James,

I think it is important to wait for a major selling climax to commit additional
funds to this market. When stocks are being given away. I remember in 1987 how
stocks were gapping down and it seemed like any bid would get picked up.

I have been impressed by your disciplined approach and ability to stand back
and let this thing evolve. As a contrarian and value investor who hasn't seen
so many opportunities in years, it is very hard to hold back. Values seems to
be popping up all over the place. REITs are looking sickly and Semis and oil
service are in intensive care. But, I like your idea of waiting for the high
quality companies to catch a cold. However, I think I will use it more as an
indicator. I will mostly be buying deep value with zero debt and plenty of

WS: Whether one waits to invest or one invests now: I think this depends on the
proclivity and style that each investor uses. If an investor only buys a few
stocks (has a concentrated portfolio), and the investor mostly plunks down
money and waits, or takes an initial position and then averages up,... my
opinion is that this is not the time to buy.

However, if one lags into positions (averages down), and/or if one diversifies
among a wide variety of companies and industries (as Dr. Graham suggests -g-),
then this is the time to buy. From what I read, most people now believe we are
in a 'legitimate' correction if not bear market for small cap and/or value
stocks. Value investors should be patiently accumulating these depressed issues
now - this is what I think Dr. Graham says. That's my opinion.

Regarding l987: IMO, it wasn't at all about having discipline to wait for the
best price, wait and jump in at gap down to pick up screaming bargains.
Everything (everything I owned and looked at anyway -g-) went down and went
down fast. No, the discipline was would you buy at all (have the guts and money
to commit -g-), and did you have the discipline (patience) to wait the several
months (or better, the years) to see those great profits? The buy price was
IMO, basically irrelevant to the gains that could be got by just establishing
or even holding on to, one's positions. That's my experience.

Microsoft had to post some fixes to recent software after assuring customers
they were in the no problem zone. Lot's of these companies are looking not only
at legacy software, but at chips with 2 digit code hardwired in. Beyond
remediation costs, companies are going to face some hairy litigation over the
problems that slip by. If remediation costs are difficult to get a handle on,
litigation could go way beyond that. Some companies have sought legislative

I also tend to be early and am learning the obvious lesson from that. WAIT. I
will not argue with anybody on this thread who says that a hell of a lot of
investments look very cheap right now. But the same investments looked very
cheap last week and now are down another 10%. The logical extreme of this is
that you wait forever and never buy. But I think you all know me better than
that. Somewhere in between I'll make my stand. I haven't decided whether it
will be all at once or just starting to nibble. The macro will decide that for
me, and that is what I am watching now. But for now I am still a seller. I have
another 10% of my portfolio (there's not much left) earmarked for any
significant bounce this week.

What am I watching for as buy signals? I am not a technical analyst, and until
recently I would have agreed with the conventional wisdom that market timing is
futile. But it worked for me and I always am skeptical of conventional wisdom.
John Neff, one of the greatest value investors of our time, has been scoffing
at the notion that you can't time the market. So my buy signals are the
opposite of my sell signals, on which I sold over the last six months,
accelerating my selling in early July.
1) Extreme market valuation. Fair value of the S&P is at least 10-20% lower
than its level now, based on the model I use. The major Wall Street firms use
the same model (stock prices are tied to interest rates) but with a major
logical flaw - they assume the current return on equity of the S&P is
sustainable. I don't. More traditional models (dividend yields, P/Es, etc.)
would argue for much more pain, which gives me comfort that I am right.
2) Speculative mentality. The valuation of the internet stocks was a big signal
for me to GET OUT NOW. Retail investors are still willing to pay over $100 for
Amazon.com. When these speculative stocks drop another 50%, I will be much
happier. I would predict Amazon eventually trades for single digits. Go back to
the last speculative euphoria 25 years ago and look at the speculative
companies then and you will see what I mean.
3) Conventional wisdom is that stocks are no-risk investments if you buy for
the long term. I want to see newspaper articles terrifying people. Articles
pointing out that if you had bought the Japanese market in 1990 after a 10%
"correction" you'd still be down 50% today. Or if you had bought in 1929 or
1972 on the "correction" you would have been even maybe a decade later if that.
I want to see this "new paradigm" discredited and Abby Joseph Cohen
discredited.

I know I am annoying a lot of people now, but I kind of like watching my cash
balance do nothing every day as I read the doom and gloom in the paper. Value
investors have bought into this garbage that you can't time the market. Read
Ben Graham again - one of the first lessons he tried to teach is to time the
market.

"Suppose P/E is negative, div is cut twice, book is written off ...

IMO these are some very likely scenarios. So what do you look for in a company
in this environment? In contrast to past years I assume declining earnings and
try to judge the company's ability to maintain cash flow and dividend. Dividend
has been my latest area of education and my particular concern is the safety of
this dividend. Graham was always conscious of the quality of the dividend and
its place in the valuation.

But Hell, if the Fed lowers rates as some have suggested, the dividend of even
a no-growth company like US Steel starts to look attractive! <g>

But here's my question: For the past decade companies have forsaken a healthy
dividend yield for stock buybacks (if this assertion is wrong please correct
me). If they have not disposed of those shares, and assuming a further decline
in the stock market, then will the reduced value of those shares show up as
lower ROE on the balance sheet?

Annoying? No, you're earning my respect more and more. That's pretty tremendous
discipline.

Of course, if you've been out of the market, it is probably easier to wait. If
you've been in it and getting killed like I am then there's a greater sense of
urgency just by human nature. Irony of ironies, I got my chunk of money to
invest for myself in very early May - so I was at 100% cash at the market top.
Within three weeks I was fully invested in "relative values," many of which
have fallen 40-60% in three months with no paper profits to cushion the blow.
So having participated fully in the bear so far, there's no way I'm taking mine
off the table now.

Even more ironical, looking through my broker statement, I was actually selling
partial positions of YPF at 31, Deswell at 16, Midway at 16 1/2, JOE at 29 1/2.
So I made some right moves in mid-June, but the money went right into other
stocks that have lost money. Yep, I'm staying on this train now no matter where
it takes me.

After making such critical wrong decisions in just the last three
months, I don't even want to think what my stomach and wife would do if I
stepped aside now and the market spurted another 40% upward. This tells me that
the advantage goes to you and others more patient, wherever that patience comes
from.

Re: Amazon, are you sure about those single digits? I'd assume you
mean that the business model just can't be profitable. It is growing
revenues like crazy and it seems to me it has proven that its marquee is the
dominant book-selling name on the internet. People thought Barnes and Noble
would step in and take business but that's not happening, and I think that's
why the stock has run up so much. Whether it can ever be profitable, though, I
don't know.

Prime borrowers are looking at lower rates - their borrowing costs tag along

yeild bond funds relative to treasury funds that the borrowing costs for the

Jim, Comment on buying strategy.

I also tend to be early and am learning the obvious lesson from that. WAIT. 

The problem with waiting, I've found, is that it causes me to want to pick the
ultimate bottom and jump in more or less with a full position. An alternate
strategy that I'm using now is to buy small positions, even odd lots, over
several months time to build into a full position. Doing this I don't worry
about missing the upswing nearly as much, and still have the benefit of dollar
cost averaging. Although I'm trying to force myself to stop averaging down, I
think I'm going to have to live with this tendency and hope it doesn't hurt me
too bad. The other side of the coin is that it encourages me to average up,
something I'm more hesitant to do, but should help keep money flowing into my
winners.

For me this works better and keeps me from building an "out-sized" position
just because a stock keeps getting cheaper.

On market psychology/an alternate viewpoint: FWIW, I don't sense fear, but
rather resignation to the volatility. Around the office people are losing big,
but I don't hear anybody thinking of pulling their money out of the market. The
general concensus is "you've gotta take the good with the bad." Perhaps because
we watch things so closely, our tendency is to overestimate the importance of
the markets to most people. For many the money they're saving is for 20+ years
down the road and the ups and downs right now don't mean so much. I think the
staying power of Joe Investor is likely to be stronger than expected.

extended with debt or will go crashing down, because they can't repay or
refinance... Humbug! (IMO -g-). We are seeing very few companies go under for
these reasons, and there is NO discussion that I see in the media being raised

I take the totally opposite view from you guys apparently. Companies with debt
who can employ those funds to enhance shareholder value --- great. That's just
what I want. The more the better. Debt incurred in '96,'95,'94 etc. coming due?
Great. Should be no problem refi'ing now at lower rates.

The benefit to me is that I don't change my investing style or think that it's

For guys for whom S&P indexes are key, and for whom it's important to measure

If not, they are changing their investing style in an attempt to beat or equal
the bogey. That certainly could be a benefit to them (maybe a benefit to me if
I were more open to it.)

Wasn't it Mr. Buffett who said he would be thrilled (my words) if he could find
an investment that gave him a guaranteed 15% return. Well, I'm in the same
boat. IMO, it's something to do with portfolio size and place 'on the continuum
of life' -g-. If I were were 20 or 30 yrs. old (again -g- sigh), then I'd want
BIG returns, the BIGGEST because I'd want those women, those cars, those
vacations, that home,those clothes, that early retire., etc. etc. I'd want my
25k or 250k to get those outsize returns. Dead money... that's for saps -g-.
But, I'm not 20, or 30,or 40). I'm somewhere else (fortunately or unfortunately
-g-). So I'm with Mr. Buffett in liking an absolute. I want $$$, absolute
dollars -- not something up or down relative to the S&P. If the S&P goes up 20%
each of the next five years, Great! If I can make 15% each of the next five
years, I'd be thrilled. It's more than what I need or expect for my lifestyle.

relative value than Coke, or Wendy's compared to MCD or etc., this is a
VERY,VERY dangerous way to invest. When things go bad, like MCD is downgraded
or stocks in general drop, you will see (I believe) your relative bargain (WEN)
drop, and drop even more than the market leader or favorite. There's a reason
that these second companies are undervalued to the market leaders. If you buy
these companies without a thorough knowledge or without having a ruling reason,
you will get hurt. And buying them because they look cheaper RELATIVELY is not

No offense taken - I completely agree with you from the inside (and I am
talking about pension fund management, not mutual funds), but let me fill in
the blanks as to how this insular world of institutional investing works. How
the world really works it this. My firm's and just about every investment
firm's clients will not let us hold more than 5% cash. If you do that and are
wrong for one quarter, you lose half your clients. So its not an option. From
my experience, I would guess that over half of value managers are very much in
cash right now in their personal accounts. BUT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT
PROFESSIONALLY. They want to, but can't. These same clients are going to be
screaming next quarter - WHY DIDN'T YOU WARN US?!? This business is idiotic. If
I could have managed our firm's accounts as I have managed my personal account
our clients would be much happier right about now. But even if I could have I
never would have because the clients, or rather their consultants (who really
run this business on the institutional side) demand "market performance" -
which means if you lose your clients' money, thats fine, as long as everybody
else does too. At the bottom of a bear market, I'm sure these same consultants
will be castigating us for being fully invested. This is another secret to
Buffett's success - he has found a group of "clients" (investors in BRK) who
will let him do what he does best without trying to second guess him every
quarter. That is a rare luxury, and a valuable one - not just to him, but to
his shareholders.

What do you think happens when you are an institutional investor who owns 5% of
an illiquid company trading at half what it is worth? If a lot of your other
investments look like that too (we know the feeling on this thread) you lose
clients, you have to sell that stock whether you want to or not. And you can't
pick your price - you HAVE to sell. And that drives the price down further, but
you can't buy more. This is a vicious cycle that may explain why something like
New Holland keeps falling no matter what it is worth. That is the game most
value managers are in right about now. And it is gutwrenching.

These consultants proclaim to hire us to invest, but do not seem to know what
the word means. That is why value managers like me do much better in their
personal accounts - its not that we are screwing our clients - we would love to
do the same for our clients, but it is nearly impossible. I hope this helps to
clear up what is a secretive business, but one which has a lot to do with the
day to day prices of your investments. (Mutual funds are a different game, but
just as much a game. I'm talking about pension fund investing which I know.)

Now you know why I won't disclose who I work for.

fund was a 10 year investment (she told me Japan is a basket case, so stay
away, but I gave her a lecture on contrarian investing and now we've lost half
our investment in four months). A lesson of investing - always listen to your
wife when she knows more about what your are investing in than you do.
