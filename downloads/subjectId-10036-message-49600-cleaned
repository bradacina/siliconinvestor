Re: ROYL

Have you come up w/ a valuation for ROYL based on their current production and
acreage?

http://www.royl.com/overview.htm

Still researching possible candidate companies. The other clue if the State
moves forward w/ their NG pipeline and LNG terminal "dream" would be companies
that own property in or around the inlet where a possible terminal would be
located. The big thing is the storage and processing for this gas. Would they
build something offshore? Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (MILL) caught my eye as
they own some prime property in/and around an inlet w/ the developmental
"rights" for the offshore area too. A long shot but E&P companies w/ some of
these other assets/properties would be a bonus as well as current BOPD.

I have added ROYL to my watch list and continue to scan the daily/weekly news
for any developments in this area.

XIN update,

They are investing a substantial sum in New York real estate, which further
supports the thesis they are not a fraud in case the buyback and dividends
didn't have people convinced.

That being said, I am slightly paring down my XIN position at a gain today. The
news from their blow-out quarter (which I expected) has been absorbed, I have
received a nice divvy, their top shareholder seems to be selling out, and the
fact they are investing in the US doesn't seem to bode well for what they think
about China.

I still believe the stock is highly undervalued, but their top shareholder
selling will probably keep a lid on the stock, so I am going to see how
business develops before committing further money to this investment.

I have liked trash stocks in the past, but sold out of them several years ago
and look at them, at best, market performers.

I never owned CWST for several reasons. RSG and WM control roughly 70% of total
domestic disposal capacity. Casella lacks the the ownership of a sizable
network of landfills. If there is any moat to the trash business, it is to be
vertically integrated,

Casella's footprint is almost entirely limited to the Northeast, not exactly a
robust economic region. Their revenues have been steady to declining on a
yearly basis since 2008. Here is a link to their financials from Nasdaq. It is
pretty obvious why they trade at a discount to peers.

http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cwst/financials?query=income-statement

The company has increased its landfill space but at the expense of oppressive
financial leverage. Now they are trying to dig their way out by selling assets,
and raising capital. The current offering will be quite dilutive to the
outstanding shares. But maybe that doesn't matter as they haven't consistently
made money for the last five years.

A significant amount of their revenues come from recycling commodities
business.

The Casella brothers own 100% of the Class B stock which entitles them to
significant control over the company.

I don't own Waste Management. But at least you get a dividend. No dividend
here. In fact I believe their covenants restrict them from offering a dividend.

So what am I missing? They have already sold substantial assets. What else is
up for sale? Can you outline this turnaround since you bought this morning.

Great write-up Aberdeen International governance (AAB.TO and AABVF)

Below is a great write-up from another message board. I would like to get the

I agree that the trash business is not all that attractive. The key with CWST
is that it has some significant improvement in cash flow going for it, that are
going to improve their bottom line starting next year:

These numbers are taking from the 8/16 investors presentation:
6.5 M$/year reduction in G&A expenses (completed in 8/2012)
5.0M$/year savings from closing down Maine facility
9.0M$/year in interest cost savings from refinancing the 11% notes, contingent
upon the capital raise announced today.
=20.5M$/year in total cash flow improvements

There are other incremental cash flow gains expected from increasing the
existing landfill capacity and eliminating a takenir pay contract, but those
will take longer to materialize., but could add another 5M$ annually. Not bad
for a company with a ~160M$ market cap (after accounting for the capital
raise).

Interesting...

A couple of comments:

This looks like business calendar improvements to EBITDA in 2014 as the company
in this presentation already is projecting that EBIDATA for 2013 will roughly
be the same as 2012

CWST makes the case that they are undervalued to the sector, but, again, until
they start hitting the same metrics they will remain so. They are also a
regional player in a capital intensive business so I bet they will always trade
at a discount.

My suspicions are that the 20 million in cost cutting will not all fall to the
bottom line as they have most likely deferred expenditures because of their
constrained income and balance sheet statements. They already indicated that
they want to purchase new NG dump trucks.

Regarding the expansion of their landfills, it should be noted the comments
from Mornngstar when they covered the company...

..."in 2010, it paid Casella Construction (a company jointly owned by both
Casella brothers) $9 million for landfill services. Further, the company pays
Casella Associates $25,000 a month for two real estate leases."

Yes, that is a big risk, especially considering CWST track record. I do think
that at least the near term part of ~20M$ in improvement appears highly
plausible. The improvement further out (~5M$) have much less certainty but are
not necessary either to make the investment work. I also think that they
continue to see a small backwind from rate increases and the better economy
(last year the EBITDA increased by ~2M$). With a leveraged play like CWST,

I don't know if you saw both of news items of late on it. The Motley Fool
person likes it for the quarter and the Seeking Alpha person says sell before
the earnings. One will be right. I however will be holding through the earnings
release. I am willing to wait for improvement with a good dividend for that
wait. Depending on market reaction. The shares could be an even better value
after the release, if they disappoint. Most likely it would break a 52 week
low. Netapp is a big % customer, so is Dell. I find it Interesting IBM is still
a customer as the company was once owned by IBM. The company is dependent on
those two big customer so they will suffer or gain on their fortunes. This is a
company I believe has high speculative appeal do to the acquisitions that been
going on in the cloud space. I believe they have some good cloud storage
products. Little kicker here is the company still has some tax loss carry
forwards to shelter earnings. Drive wise- I've looked at Hutchinson Technology

dislikes the stock, the point is that if I didn't post about the Congress and
maybe if I didn't mention CFW.to, would anybody here on the thread then even be

Re: BWP

For you or anyone else that value these MLP's. First what's "DGR" stand for?
Every time these MLP's issue a secondary, how does one evaluate the use of the
funds? Generally they pay down some type of revolving credit facility which is
a net positive. They use the funds to buy new assets and/or CAPX improvements,
another net positive. I believe Clownbuck looks at Cash Flows and EBITA amounts
that I presume change w/ each new secondary offer. Therefore, it's hard to
analyze the change in value due to these capital infusions unless one is
bullish long term on their pipelines (which I am) and locations. I just do not
want to pay a premium when there are other non-MLPs to buy. Those are getting
expensive too.

FWIW, my last few "Buys" have all been pipeline and NG gathering MLPs.

Sorry for the error...DGR of course is dividend growth rate, but clearly MLP's
don't have dividends but rather return of capital. Lord, we don't need THAT
discussion again!

Anyway, my point was that their distribution increases have been less than
stellar, but the high current rate seems to make up for it.

I not only look at the current secondary, but at what the company did with
previous money absorbed from previous secondaries. If they are using the money
to "return capital" then no thanks. If they are using it for future growth,
acquisitions, etc., then I am interested.

The metric that matters for MLP's is distributable cash flow. It is roughly
equal to earnings + depreciation - maintenance Capex. In some cases working
capital changes are added, in other cases not. I would tend to omit them,
because they are seasonal and should even out over time.

EBITDA is a decent way to value pipelines across different incorporations
(C-Tax, MLP etc). You can calculate distributable cash flow by subtracting
interest expense from EBITDA, assuming that maintenance capex is very small.

The distribution is not all return of capital. Many MLP's and in particular BWP
have actual earnings. Also it is important to that return of capital is an
accounting number, resulting from depreciation but that depreciation does not
match the economic value of the pipeline. In fact, many pipelines will actually
appreciate in value because of rate increases and new additions add to their
economic life. I think this is really the key part to understand about the
pipeline business.

As far as BWP is concerned, i consider the potential for distribution growth to
be limited. Their main asset used to be a major pipeline that moved gas from
Texas to the Northeast. This pipeline is in less demand, because a lot of gas
is produced in the Marcellus shale, very close to the consumption centers
there. BWP also botched expansion projects in 2008 with cost overruns to the
tune of 800M$ back then, that forced Loews to support them. Then they overpaid
for NG storage assets, that are also in less demand, because the NG glut makes
storing gas for winter use less profitable. This is. long string of blunders
that have stalled BWP distribution growth, compared to better managed MLP's
like OKS with comparable assets.

On the other hand, the Loews GP will most likely provide financing backstop
when needed, which makes the distribution safer, so you can almost regard it as
a bond substitute,imo.

You are totally right that HPQ has negative tangible book and that's a strike
against it. I and Clownbuck have been saying for some time that their balance
sheet looks ugly.

Waiting is definitely the name of the game and was the best thing to do so far.
IMHO, HPQ has been mismanaged through CEO carousel and is still in sorry shape.
This week's drop was due to the fact that new CEO pretty much acknowledged that
there's no clear turnaround direction, which hit investors confidence in her
ability to manage and turn this company.

Spinoffs might be interesting although it's tough to say. When Lucent spun off
Avaya and Agere (?) and itself collapsed, neither of the companies did great.
So it's not obvious that HPQ has divisions that are supergreat. Perhaps
enterprise segment, but I know too little about it.

Well, I wrote a detailed response <u>why</u> I post what I post and in the way
I post.

This came about from Sergio H's comment: "Most of your posts indicate that you
suffer heavy losses from losing positions."

For various reasons I've decided not to post that complete response, and
instead say that the more accurate observation would be, yes, "Many of my posts
indicate I am experiencing losses from losing positions".
I do use the adjective "losing" intentionally so as to alert and be of
assistance to other value investors.

OTOH, a more subtle observation might be that over the past many years I seldom
post specifically that I have gains/profits in a particular stock. That's
intentional too. It's only rare that I will post that "I'm taking profits", "I
have a double here", or "I made money on this one". What you'll usually find
from me, if you do a search, is that I will say "I'm closing my position" or
"I'm selling some shares", or maybe "I'm following you out with a sale" or "I
still have my position". If you're in those same stocks, or you've followed
them closely when they were discussed here or look at my reference prior
link(s), you might be able to figure the gain I might have had. Of course, most

INTC still will own all of the PC land + all of the enterprise land. It is
foolish to say that no one wants INTC production when
Google/Microsoft/Amazon/etc. are building data centers left and right. It does
not matter if it's cloud based or not, you have to have processors and INTC is
it.

DELL, HPQ can be replaced in PC land by Lenovo, Asus, Acer, Apple. All of these
still use INTC processors. There is no competition that uses something else.
AMD and NVDA processors are in the margins.

The only problem INTC has is mobile where ARM is the winner. But they are still
in much better shape than DELL/HPQ, which are squeezed both by mobile and by
Asian competition and by Apple PCs.

However, as I said before DELL/HPQ are a lot cheaper than INTC, so from

Hi Paul -

I have found your posts helpful when you scale a position down and/or close out
a position. For me, it is one of the most difficult parts in investing is "When
to Sell". For the last year, I have been trying to provide the thread my
reason(s) for scaling down a position and/or closing out a position especially
if I find that the "value" proposition is no longer there. I have been wrong
and will continue to be wrong on my sells but when I see others selling and
evaluate their reasons (not always a value consideration), it gets me thinking
on my reasons to sell.

Many of my sales are done for cost basis adjustment reasons. I generally make
several buys (usually three or more over several months). I will sell off my
high priced shares and deploy that money into other value propositions. I post
those sales too with the comment that I am selling my high priced shares. In
fact, if you search the thread for "high priced shares", many of my sales are
for this very reason.

I do lot based accounting and as a result keep many (if not all) of my long
term capital gains in the portfolio. I only harvest those capital gains to
offset capital losses.

One of the things I pay attention to on the "sell" posts if there are specific
sectors being sold and the reasons for selling (dividend yield too low, PE at
higher end, etc). Sometimes it is a flag for me to evaluate the companies I own
in that sector too.

That's how you choose to play it, no critisism on that, although if you buy so
many stocks it might be more efficient to just buy ETFs or mutual funds.

But since you play so many stocks, it would be a great opportunity to take a
look at the results and learn something.

Wouldn't it be interesting and educational to look at the stocks you sell to
see how your long time tested value theories held up? For example, did the
metrics at the time of sale decline or did they still indicate value? Wouldn't
it be of interest to apply the same analyses to your winners? There is always

While I don't have that many stock, don't believe the above statement is
necessarily true. If you are an individual investor, there are a lof of ways to
grind out performance, that you can't do, if you play mutual funds or even
ETF's. You can be more tax efficient, by selling destinctive lot's, you can
use, small fluctuations in thinly traded stocks, to play a market maker of
sorts, buying into these seemingly senseless dips and selling into the spikes,
grinding out a few percent here and there. If you own or follow many stocks,
there is always something going on that can be exploited, imo. Sure, you are
sometimes left holding a bag, but in most cases, these stocks move in often
irrational fashion.

The biggest advantage that individual investors have is that they can deal in
stocks that the funds usualy can't touch , for lack of liquidity or because
they don't fit within their investment agenda. Sure you could try to run a
concentrated portfolio but in many illiquid situations, you could only put a
few thousand $ in, so you need many of them to make an impact.

I generally put the losing stocks I sell on my watch list and review their
subsequent performance
1) to see if the reason for selling was valid
2) to see if I was vindicated in exiting the position
3) to see if I'll ever find the stock so attractively low vs its current value
or the company's current business conditions, that I might want to reenter.

I only haphazardly follow the stocks of winners after I've closed out the
position.

Biggest changes I've made in past few years are portfolio/allocation related:
1. Reducing margin substantially.
2. Keeping sizeable cash reserves.
3. Moving into preferred stocks/bond funds/mlps/etf's for distribution yield
4. Making smaller $ buys with initial positions.
5. Concentrating on oil/oil service stocks. Evaluating e&p juniors differently
from other businesses. Namely, using p/cash flow, p/flow bopd, price 2pnav10,
et. al.

I've made no change elsewhere in valuation techniques. Using my same metrics
and yardsticks.

We know EKS's big change or one of them is reducing holding period. I'm quicker
to take sell too. I still want to hold on for full/fair value as I see it, but
fear of market volatility gets me sometimes. So my turnover has increased and

I only haphazardly follow the stocks of both losers and winners that I sell. My
interest usually is not why I lost or won, that's pretty clear at the time of
the sale. My interest afterwards for both categories is whether I can reenter
the position at better price and/or the business has changed for better.

I probably should track my losses as well as my gains and try to figure out why
they happened. I don't do that (yet?). My feeling is that gains are either due
to macro reversal (bought at panic, sold at "risk on") or due to business
improvement (or market acknowledging that business is not as bad as expected).
Losses are usually due to raising cash (or switching to another stock) during
the panic/downturn times when most positions are cheap and whatever I sell is
more expensive later on. Another source of losses is when the business is as
bad as market expected or even worse and decline continues.

I definitely lose some gains due to selling great businesses at high prices
that subsequently run up even more due to great execution (GOOG, AAPL, ISRG,
MA). It is tough for me to hold forever overpriced stocks though.

Regarding changes in last couple years:
- I also raised cash to ~20-25% and keeping it there. However, I think this is
part of widespread value investor underperformance in 2011 and this year. So
far my performance in 2011 and this year are below market.
- I am holding oil/oil service stocks. However, I am beginning to think that
oil/oil service stocks should be bought mostly during the panic oil price
crashes. Most of my buys during the elevated oil price periods did not yield
good returns, even though the stocks looked cheap.
- I've bought tons of prefs during 2009 crash. I have sold most of them and
have very little portfolio remaining in fixed income. I don't think this
positively or negatively impacted my recent performance. I don't think yields
are attractive right now. IMHO, if one looks for yield with good future, one
should buy rental RE.
- I've been moving from Buffettology valuation to E/EV to DCF valuation. Not
sure yet if this has a significant effect to results.

Not much activity this month. I sold some more EGY and PERI on valuation
although PERI management has increased their projections for this year's

sold part of PERI position in the summer. I still have low confidence in this
company, so I lightened even more. Probably I should fully exit the stock, but
I am keeping a small position to see what happens next.

I decided to buy more FBOD as the price collapsed to $1.10 range. It's clear
that people want to get out while the stock is trading instead of holding out
for liquidation distributions. This now seems somewhat attractive liquidation
play.

I added CJES, JPM, AAUKY, GTAT on valuation. CJES, AAUKY and GTAT are probably

Sergio; I believe CB has put fourth some great individual investors advantages.
Some I use to a degree some I don't. I personally don't invest in ETF, and no
current mutual funds, but I believe both are a great place to find individual
investment ideas. Doing this kind of gives you a glance at what the
professionals are buying and holding. Personally I think ETF are better suited
for one who is more of a active trader for specific sector participation. I've
taken some ideas (watch list additions) from both, but not necessarily bought
on those ideas. Generally you can find a mutual fund to fit most all investing
metrics you might want to participate in. Those being Values of all sorts, high
growth, small cap, ect ect. IMO A good place for Investors that don't know what
to buy, and don't want to keep track of their investments day to day. That
reasoning being they want to try an achieve a better return on their money than
traditional safe investments. Witch over the historical long haul, the stock
market has done.
IMO timing is a most important part. So is total return over the long haul. If
you do have a diversified portfolio of stocks you manage. When to buy , and
asset allocation in relation to the risk you want to take is also important.
Being most of us can't nail a bottom, or sell at the top. Bearing in mind for
those of us that do have portfolios and hold longer term. We know are
investments will be at the mercy of the market. We sometimes can make adjust to
current conditions. For those who keep a specific cash levels on the sidelines.
We can dollar cost average to a certain allocation that will fall within our
own risk level . That, If their is something we think will do well long term as
it declines. We can also buy something that becomes a value that once wasn't.
Keeping that watch list is one important newer tool for me.
I can tell you the most you can have in a single YH watch list portfolio is
200. That's because I watch more than that. <G>

I generally try to be simplistic in some of my analysis along the Buffett Lines
He is my investment idol I looked up to in my early investment year, and still
do. John Templeton is another. I've found throughout my investing years. Many
of us individual value type investors in some form (message boards, media, or
day to day conversation, will cross paths at one time or another. That being
said we will agree and disagree on points, and that is a good thing, IMO.

PS >IMO-buying illiquid stocks on most metrics is only good if they get
discovered. In general most brokerages keep track of current investment
performance from your buy price, also your realized and unrealized gains. If
you evaluate yourself based on the past performance on your schedule D over the
long haul. You can make a self determination if individual investing is for
you. Or at the very least a reason why changing your approach to get better.

You stated: <blockquote>John Templeton is another. I've found throughout my

My Dad introduced me to Sir John as a teenager. We would go through his
quarterly reports and look at the stocks he owned and was buying. I even
watched him on Rukeyser's "Wall Street Week" ( http://goo.gl/h9WBy . (Note:
Many are too young here to remember Sir John or even Wall Street Week - it was
an institution in our home every Friday night). Even 23 years later, everything
he says in that interview is true today and I suspect will be true in the
future too.

I always remembered his saying that <u>"the DOW would be 10,000 by 2000"</u>.
We did that and even more.

<img src='http://www.csharphelper.com/howto_graph_dji_history.png'>

He was honest too. Perhaps that was because he was very religious.

I remember he was always buying when others were selling as he always believed
that in the long term value would win out. I believe that today too.

As I said earlier, I don't like to discuss my winners because I don't believe
it's helpful.

<blockquote>...if these metrics have affected the stock price or was the price

value metrics in value vesting -- p/bk, p/sales, p/e, roe, etc. So of course if
the market rallies or just the particular stock does, it's the stock price that
affects the metrics, not the other way around. And if the "p" gets high enough
the metrics become less attractive, and eventually I'll want to be a seller.

Looking at a sample of my 50 past gain sales, it looks like I sold 3 (6%)
because I primarily just got tired of holding shares; there were 2 (4%)
takeovers; I made 16 (32%) sales for a combo of reasons -- fear of losing a
profit played a part; and 29 (54%) primarily because my expectations were met
(revert-to-mean; stock price made metrics unattractive).

For stocks I sell at loss, I sometimes provide a reason, or it can be inferred
if from whom I'm replying too if we're both exiting the stock. The reader ought
to be able to figure out why I might be selling. Maybe not agree with the

Hi BAZ79. I don't think there is such a thing as retained losses. I guess you
mean ongoing losses. And to answer your question, more info is needed.

To many value investors, a stock is not a value stock if the company is not
profitable.

A company that develops new drugs will have to bear the research costs until
such time as their drug is approved. If that is the sole purpose of the co. it
will always burn cash until it has a successful drug.

Another co. might be losing money because of heavy debt burden but its parts
may be worth more than the whole. Take a look at VE for example. I am using VE
just as an illustration to answer your question. VE may attract some value
investors as it sells below book value and has low multiples as the co. sheds
some of its parts in order to reduce debt.

Some businesses are cyclical, like automobiles and construction and suffer
ongoing losses during the down period of their business cycles.

Some business experience competition from new products, like the PC industry
being clobbered by the mobile revolution, and could experience years of losses
while it adapts to the new business landscape.

I'm sure there are more examples of situations were there are ongoing losses.
Your analyses should be first to figure out what the reason is for the ongoing
losses and from there determine if there is a likelyhood of profitability.

Balance sheets show them as negative retained earnings in the Stockholder's

The formula calculates retained earnings by adding net

Another Form of Value - The Company's Owned Assets

You set me on a new investment quest two years ago which shows one can always
learn new investment "value" themes. It was the buying a basket of small E&P
companies that had (or could eventually realize) value from the assets they
owned, specifically the Oil & NG under the ground.

These companies are difficult to manage in a large portfolio as one could trade
the large price swings even though the long term potential value has not yet
been met. Many times I would see a 30% gain in the price over just a few
days/weeks but knowing the potential value of the assets the company owned, I
would not sell. There are no earnings usually in these small E&P companies and
investor's expectations change daily/weekly/quarterly when new wells come in
dry, cash reserves dry up, oil prices fall and many other negative factors make
the news wire.

I am no trader buy I am learning to begin to trade the swings selling some
shares on these rallies and loading up on my position at the extreme lows. The
key continues to be the land assets these E&P companies own. Using some basic
valuation criteria like current and estimated BOPD production, acreage owned
(especially if it is contiguous to other producing acreage), recent sales of
property to large developers and other "real asset" valuations typically not
reflected in the company's balance sheet.

I am seeing this in many of the Jr. Miners I follow too. It's all about
developing the asset (an oil well and/or a mine) bringing the resource into
production and generating a new income stream (w/ some extended long life). For
both the Jr. Miners and the E&P companies, we are generally early to the party
and the true values will take months if not years to realize.

The traditional valuation metrics do not work on these types of companies and
one can be patient for only a certain amount of time too. I think your approach
of owning a basket of these companies knowing there will be losses in a few and
very large gains in others is the best approach.

It's still quite hard to determine a hard set approach on selling (at least for
me). I cleaned house at the end of 18 months, selling many of my losers at a
loss and took equivalent gains from my winners. Some of my winners lost 50% or
more of their value after my initial sell. I then proceeded to add more share
as the potential land values were/are still there IMO.

I am still figuring out the best (and most profitable) way to generate a good
return w/o letting go of the potential long term value.

FWIW, my recent Copper Mountain Mining Corporation (CPPMF) buys are up almost
80% from my lowest buy point in August this year, but long term there is
another double or two left. I may peel off some shares to cover my seed money
and load up again on any sell off. Aurcana Corporation (AUNFF), a Jr Silver
producer is another one of these companies that I believe have some very
valuable land assets. This one has been a huge winner for me from my recent
buys in August @ $0.76/share.

On these speculations, I keep my investment amount per company small but like
to spread it around to many companies (ie basket approach). I am still looking
for that 10 bagger (which all of these IMO are capable of achieving) to arrive.

Just another example where you can not use the usual valuation metrics like PE
(they have no earnings), BV and/or TBV (the real assets are valued at cost not
their potential worth), FCF small or negative (usually put back into production
costs), debt (usually quite large and leveraged to achieve the big payoff) or
other standards.

Keep posting your valuation ideas on these and anything that triggers a "sell"
for you and/or a "red flag" to watch.

E&p companies. I believe I am seeing value in Colombian e&p companies: I
continue to add to PMGLF as it falls., Also, as I posted earlier, I do like the
Australian companies that have land in USA and/or Canada. I am adding now to
Sundance (SDCJF/SEA.ax) in which I already have a full position.

The e&p universe has so many stocks that are so volatile. It has been painful
and very difficult for me to hold on. I've not traded them as they have risen
and fallen back - I should have tried maybe. The long term good potential may
be there, but in the meanwhile and near term -- it can be a disaster holding
stocks in this sector.

AAUKY - I also went back into AAUKY @14.32$. In a way, this stock is cheaper
than in 2009, when it was trading around 9$, but it's intrinsic value, earnings
and commodity prices were much lower.

Templeton: I used to watch the show every week also. And often sent in for the

others. Still have them all. I'll have to delve into my library to see if I can

Templeton:

You had no clue about his famous Dow prediction of 10,000 or the earlier one? I
sure hope you know who Templeton was though. Arguably one of the best investors
of all time. I don't see how anybody could be involved with stocks as an
investor or student of the market and not know of this guy.

How about some disk drive stock? WDC or STX. They had some nice price
appreciation this year but could be undervalued based on earnings and earnings
growth. Even though they should be valued at a lower p/e since the use FIFO.

WDC trading just over book value, .75p/s. gross margins, net margins above
average but remember they use FIFO. WDC adding new revenue stream with the
purchase of data storage from Hitachi.

Any thoughts???

I own both WDC and STX.

They are steals each with 100% upside from the current prices.

Duopoly status means and end to the boom-bust pricing cycles of the past.
