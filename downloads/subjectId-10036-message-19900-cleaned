Paul and Carl another factor I use in addition to those that Paul mentioned is
I try to find a value buy when the business cycle for their industry is at or
near a low.

For examples I picked up some LSI recently as the semi cycle has been bumping
on it's low for some time and LSI sells at a bit below book value. Their
facilities have been upgraded and their product mix is good. Their huge
depreciation expenses hit earnings but their free flow cash flow is still
positive. Once the cycle begins to turn up, then they are poised for a 24-36
month run of growing earnings. At least this is what I have observed in the
last two semi cycles going back to the early 90's.

Another example is with the building stocks. These stocks follow the long term
interest rate cycle and when interest were high and falling, this was the time
to pick up these companies. With 40 year lows in interest rates, many of the
builder stocks have gone up 10x's (or more) from their cycle lows. I suppose
there was a lot of pent up demand because I have only seen this type of huge
swing one other time in the late 80's.

I believe we are observing a cycle low in many of the commodity grain prices
(i.e. corn and soy beans) as I stated in an earlier post. The sector(s) that
would benefit from these low prices are companies that use these commodities as
a major input in their production like beef and chicken producers. I have
observed this swing once before in the mid 90's and an efficient producer can
generate significant profits from sustained low grain prices. However, these
markets generally self correct w/i 12 months as farmers grow less the next year
(or weather damages a bumper crop) and input prices to the producers swing back
to normal ranges. Now, with the use of hedges and forward contract buying, many
of the large producers minimize these cycle swings. Transportation companies do
this with oil futures. Sometimes a smart management will forward hedge more
than normal if prices are at extreme lows and this is usually disclosed in
their 10K after the fact.

Pilgram Pride (The 2nd largest Chicken operator) announced today that they are
raising their 4th QTR outlook because of favorable grain prices.
http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/041018/pilgrim_s_pride_outlook_1.html

The market is very efficient so a value investor will not try to trade on these
"cycle" factors but just utilize this and the other value metrics to help in
making their investment decision.

The key to a successful investment is to identify a "value" company, that has
good management, with hidden assets (or under utilized assets) that is
profitable even during the hard times and then pile in when the business
"industry" cycle is out of favor.

There have been a lot of good ideas posted on this board. I generally find two
or three outstanding value picks in a year (that I act on) even though I am
looking every day.

>>raising their 4th QTR outlook because of favorable grain prices.

I thought higher grain prices were part of the problem Tyson and Sanderson
faced recently:

Shares of Tyson fell $1.47 to close at $16.26.

The fourth quarter will be "more difficult, primarily due to unfavorable
results from grain hedging activity, combined with weaker than expected demand
in our chicken and beef segments," said Chief Executive John Tyson.
Additionally, raw material costs for our prepared foods products did not
decline as we expected."

The warning and stock drop came less than a week after competitor Sanderson
Farms (SAFM: news, chart, profile) was hammered when it missed Wall Street
profit estimates and warned of higher grain costs and sagging chicken prices.

Tyson probably hedged at the wrong time and as a result elected to pass on
their "current" hedge option and buy at the spot market. The problem with
hedging is management isn't always right in their timing.

If you read between the lines for Pilgrim's Pride they stated that their
operations were more efficient. I assumed they were more right than wrong with
their grain hedges.

The large producers generally hedge their grain inputs. I guess my observation
for low grain prices looking forward would be a net positive for these
operators only if (1) future hedges locked in the "new" low prices and (2)
chicken operations were diversified enough so they could maintain or raise
prices in the future.

Anyway, as I stated earlier, you can not always time these cycles but rather
you want to buy at the point where it is favorable to the operators. You are
quite correct that if the company has good fundamentals and is profitable
during the lean times, then they should do really well if they can take
advantage of the good times (like low grain prices).

I like SAFM. The value measures you posted are quite attractive. I also like
the idea that grain prices are at or near a cycle low. I plan to pick up a few
shares as I believe the downside risk is quite low and they could have a few
great quarters of growing earnings.

interesting to play guess the bottom in CL (i don't own it, so have no stake in

certainly they have tremendous brand name recognition which should continue to
give them a strong place in the markets they serve (their warning even included
reference to expanding market share)

they have a mediocre at best balance sheet, so they get zero value for that
IMHO

as such, a multiple of 15x next year's earnings would yield a price of 40
bucks, and that seems about right considering their franchise, adjusted for no
earnings growth this year, and probably about 10% growth in the
future...obviously 40 also has the added probability of round number support

i'd rather own something like PEP, but CL is probably attractive around 40,
especially to sell puts, as worst case you end up with a solid company that
would at that point pay a 2.5% dividend

Two Stocks Even a Bear Can Love
Wednesday October 20, 7:00 am ET
By Curt Morrison, MD, FACC

I'm a bear. As I argued in a previous Stock Strategist column, I think the
major, market-cap-weighted stock indexes are preposterously overvalued. Given
that opinion, you might think that I refuse to own any stocks, but you'd be
wrong. In fact, the broad market was even more overvalued in the spring of
2000, but bargains were everywhere then. At that time I purchased a small-cap
retailer, three real estate investment trusts, and three thrifts--all selling
at absurdly low prices. Those stocks appreciated substantially over the next
several years despite the decline in the major indexes. 

The key thesis is that growth has been good in the past so it must be so in the
future. Even a very casual look at MRK (and to a lesser degree KO) will show
that the past in unlikely to repeat itself....

During the last 10 years, Merck's compound annual growth in normalized free
cash flow was about 11.6%, and its dividend growth was about 11.7%. Coke grew
free cash flow at about 7.5%, and its dividend at 8.9%. Because inflation
during this period was about 2.5% to 3%, that amount can be subtracted from
these figures to approximate real growth. Both of these metrics should parallel
real earnings per share (EPS) growth over the long term, but the broad market's
real EPS growth from 1871 through 2001 was only 1.25% (according to Jeremy
Siegel in Stocks for the Long Run). If Merck and Coke do roughly as well in the
next two decades as in the last one, that would constitute outstanding
long-term growth.

on that other hand, we need to be careful what we're talking about here (not
that I'm one who knows the business or that I'm careful -g-): the

Possibly next year's earnings won't be so great. Shortages seem to be resolved;

OTOH, I find a p/e of under 4 now to be compelling. This is a p/e based on
business earnings,i.e. no one-time gain on sales or accounting stuff like
restating or getting a tax refund. And it's real revenue, i.e. they received

I am nervous about it however because of a few things. I am skeptical and maybe

dramatically over the past year, and I did not participate in it. Some devil's
advocate questions, and observations:

1. $1.6 million of income in the year was non-recurring.
2. No projections or outlook provided.
3. A lot(?) of the profitability this year was inventory write-ups due to raw
material price increases (I think.)
4. Discussions in the conf call were positive but some talk of "volatility" and
"price collapse". All risks were discounted.
5. I wonder if it is too good to be true.
6. Outlook talked of capital spending and the non-commodity products, which all
sounded good.
7. Did not find any insider selling.

I need to think on this one. Any help would be appreciated. Number 2 really

ERES I'm earnestly sniffing around. It appears their growth trajectory has

OVTI a current favorite of these guys:

The top 100 investors at Marketocracy.com are looking to image sensor company
OmniVision Technologies (nasdaq: OVTI - news - people ) to rally back from a
brutal first half of 2004. The stock lost 68% of its value from January through
mid-August, much of that coming in June when the company said it was going to
restate earnings because of questionable accounting. Most investors at the
trading simulation Web site aren't interested in the stock, but gurus like its
multiple of 13.3 times earnings and a price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of
0.6. Shares have been recovering since the August lows and closed Thursday at
$15.62, up 70% from its Aug. 12 low of $8.96. Because the best investors are
the only ones buying, OmniVision is currently rated a strong buy at
Marketocracy.

I'm curious about your take on GM versus Toyota? With Toyota's clear lead in
hybrid technology, its fanatical quality control, and its competitive
advantages across a variety of measures, why are you buying GM, other than its
dividend?

TM looks like it's a buy too, esp. imo, if p/e drops under 10. Just seems more
expensive now - p/e, p/sales - than GM.

I read where Toyota's quality is slipping - their experts are thinned as new
overseas plants are opened.

I'm hoping GM can learn from TM. GM's quality is alleged to be improving (but
still far(?) behind TM).

I don't care about hybrid technology. To me it's about product and financing.
If GM can build cars that people want instead of rental-car fleet-vehicle
stuff, GM ought to do okay. I don't know that hybrid technology is of great
concern to car shoppers. As a strength, GM has a terrific financing arm.

I don't doubt that in 10 years Toyota could be the #1 automobile manufacturer
in the world in terms of # cars sold. It's capitalization already exceeds GM,
F, & DCX combined. ($125.3B>21.4B+23.8B+41.6B). A buy of TM stock is a bet that
the winner will continue to win. My bet on GM (and F) is that the not-so-sharp
companies will muddle through and that there's more upside to GM stock (next
2-3 years) than there is with TM. Although otoh, there might be more downside
with GM than TM if car sales plummet because of high gas prices.

Just a very small position for me, although I have several stocks of companies
dependent on the car business, e.g. auto retailers, OEMs to the big three,
parts suppliers, auction houses, auto insurers, auto related reit, financing
companies (aside: upped my small ACF position a little today).

I may yet add TM.

they need to be able to achieve reasonable margins and FCF over the LT. Only

finally had the opportunity this a.m. to listen carefully to the CC, and would
highlight the following points, FWIW:

1. based upon mgmt's characterization of the current pricing environment as
having "stabilized," I would argue that the 23.4% gross margin in Q4 represents
a reasonable forecasting variable for future earnings -- although I would also
note that the supply disruptions that IIIN continued to experience in Q4
(although substantially less disruptive than in Q3) should continue to
ameliorate -- a further positive

2. beginning in Feb 2005, the quarterly amortization expense ($800 K)
associated with the terminated swap agreement(s) will have been purged from the
corporate books, thereby beefing up the bottom line (a not insubstantial bit)

3. with free cash flow of $27.8 M for the year, and total LT of $52.9 M, IIIN
is well on its way to eliminating its LT debt; H specifically identified "debt
reduction" as "a paramount concern for [IIIN]"

4. w/r/t the anticipated TEA-21 reauthorization, a few points to underscore:
(a) expected to hit in first half of 2005; (b) it will most likely represent a
SIGNIFICANT increase in spending of 35-45% over and above the most recent
spending levels; and (c) "we would view this as quite a favorable outcome for
our industry that should provide a solid foundation for demand for concrete
reinforcing products going forward"

5. IIIN has experienced "strong customer support" for its ESM product
offerings, which continue to garner a greater percentage of the company's sales
(although it still represents less than 10% of total co. sales at this
juncture)

6. IIIN has "high expectations for 2005"

7. even if the demand foreseen in 2005 and 2006 does not materialize (an
unlikely scenario), the cap ex expenditures will more than pay for themselves
in enhanced efficiencies

and the financing arm looks vulnerable

To me this concern is at least as huge as the pension issue you note. I read
recently that if it weren't for the financing arm, both GM and F would have
shown really big losses.

A close acquaintance is a banking VP whose responsibilities include risk
assessment. One of his pet peeves is that companies like GE, GM and F are huge
players in the loan industry, but are subject to none of the regulatory
requirements and supervision of the banking business.

My sense is that this credit bubble is likely to implode sooner rather than
later. I must admit, it has looked that way to me for a good 15 months or so,
but looking at the personal bankruptcy rates at record levels and perusing the
index charts, it sure looks worse today than it has in the past year. Check out
http://www.financialsense.com/Market/goldberg/2004/1021.html

All to say that I think these big blue chips like GM, GE, F that have large
financing operations are extremely vulnerable.

re Steel stocks ...

Just FYI, the reason car sales in China fell so much is because the government
halted financing of auto purchases in their effort to 'soft land' the economy.

However, volumes are up in spite of this. Prices seem to be hovering between
520 to 680 per ton depending on grade and delivery terms. The next pricing
round will be crucial.

Also note that key Steel inputs such as metallurgical coal are trading at high
prices too.

The stocks are still priced on midcycle earnings, but I suspect that the bottom
part of the cycle averages should be excluded from the calculation.

Minimal new capacity is coming online until Q4 2005. 2006 capacity additions
will be heavy (particularly in China), so it could be over a year before we see
any let-up if demand holds.

More chicken news: Pilgrim downgraded. Still long SAFM.

Thoughts anyone?

http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/041025/pilgrim_s_pride_poultry_supply_1.html

Nelson's downgrade comes even though Pilgrim's Pride last week forecast far
better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, lifted by a $23.8 million, or
22-cent-per-share, recovery from an insurance policy. Even without the gain,
the company still sees a quarterly profit above Wall Street targets, but did
not give a reason for its increase...

The industry began building an over-supply of poultry in June, when consumer
demand sagged as average prices neared 85 cents per pound at their peak in
early July. For comparison, average broiler prices were about 65 cents per
pound in the year-ago period.

Since then, however, both average prices and the cost of feed -- which some
livestock producers have blamed for thinning margins -- have fallen sharply,
but poultry farms are worried that prices could continue sliding.

Despite posting a soaring third-quarter profit in late August, rival Sanderson
Farms Inc. reduced its full-year view on indications of an increase in chicken
inventory and softer prices toward the year's end.

Regarding SAFM, I like the fundamentals, low PE (trailing), they seem to
operate a very efficient facility and they are investing $80 million in a new
facility for the future. I am looking for an entry point under $30 but I focus
on the OBV and technicals looking for a lower low on lower volume. It may be
days or weeks before the technicals meet my target.

If you focus on grain futures, you may be too short sighted as the futures are
rising and this is a company you really do not want to trade on corn or soybean
spot market prices (other than trying to buy when feed is at historical
lows...like we see now). It's going to be how well the management continues to
operate in every environment and from what I can tell, this group is pretty
good.

I plan to add some shares soon to my taxable account with the expectations that
even eventually this company will be a No. 2 or No. 1 producer. They seem to be
making the long term investments to continue their growth in this industry. I
also like the pure play with chickens rather than a mix of pork and beef.

Based on book value, cash flow and other "value" measures it looks like a
compelling buy at these prices.

Goofed on a few of my restaurant stocks. Too afraid to trust a good management
team with a business that had lousy financials (LUB), and I did sell JBX much
too early. Upped my OSI position too late and at too high a price. Still
holding OSI though. And others that I've mentioned before.

Many restaurant stocks are at, or approaching, lows. I find only one attractive
for buying now - that's ARKR which is close to its high.

ARKR is a diverse company with about 50% of its business in high-end
restaurants in Las Vegas casinos. That business is doing well in the current
L.V. tourist influx. They also have restaurants in NYC. Among their
restaurants, they manage fast food places in Florida at Hard Rock Hotel &
Casinos operated by the Seminole Indian Tribe. I don't see that high gas prices
will curtail business at these places.

Mgmt's recently declared a dividend policy whereby they'll pay out .35/sh.
quarterly. That yields about 4.6% on the current share price. IF that dividend
can be maintained, that ought to (maybe) provide some support to the stock at
its current price.

I've taken only a few shares - I'm concerned that the dividend of $1.40/yr. may
not be sustainable for a stock earning 17% on a book of about $9. (LTD is about
nil.) The payout seems too great. OTOH, the BOD authorized it, so they must (I
hope) have some idea that the dividend IS sustainable.

UPDATE 3-Merck, Schering-Plough drug beats Lipitor in trial
Thu Oct 28, 2004 04:25 PM ET
(Adds Pfizer comment, closing share prices)
By Ransdell Pierson

NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Merck & Co. (MRK.N: Quote, Profile, Research) and
Schering-Plough Corp. (SGP.N: Quote, Profile, Research) on Thursday said their
recently launched Vytorin pill controlled cholesterol better than Pfizer Inc.'s
(PFE.N: Quote, Profile, Research) popular Lipitor in a large trial.

The drugmakers said patients taking the standard starting dose of Vytorin saw
their level of "bad" LDL cholesterol cut 51 percent, compared with a reduction
of 36 percent for those taking the most commonly used 10 milligram starting
dosage of Lipitor.

The six-week trial involved 1,902 patients with high cholesterol levels.

Among patients in the trial who had heart disease or were at high risk of it,
82 percent taking the standard starting dose of Vytorin were able to get their
LDL cholesterol down to the target range of below 100, the companies said.

That compared with only 47 percent of those taking the 10 milligram dose of
Lipitor.

Pfizer spokeswoman Vanessa Aristide declined to comment on the trial. But she
said Lipitor, which was introduced in 1997, has consistently proven highly
effective for most patients.

"Ninety-eight percent of people taking starting doses of Lipitor reach their
target cholesterol levels," Aristide said.

Merck and Schering-Plough in 2002 launched a pill called Zetia (ezetimibe), the
first medicine that blocks absorption of cholesterol by the intestines. It is
used either by itself, or with any member of the "statin" family of cholesterol
treatments that include Lipitor and Merck's widely used Zocor.

Their second joint product, Vytorin, was approved in July. It combines Zetia in
the same pill with Zocor, which, like all statins, works by inhibiting the
liver's production of cholesterol.

Merck and Schering-Plough on Thursday said their new study also compared
effectiveness of stronger doses of Vytorin and Lipitor in treating high-risk
patients -- specifically, Vytorin pills that combined 10 milligrams of
ezetimibe with 40 milligrams of Zocor and Lipitor at 40 milligrams.

At those mid-range doses, Vytorin cut LDL cholesterol by 59 percent in the
high-risk group, compared to 48 percent for Lipitor, the companies said.

Recent clinical trials have shown that high-risk patients have significantly
fewer heart attacks if they can drive their LDL levels below 70, far lower than
target levels of past years.

About 57 percent of high-risk patients taking the mid-range dose of Vytorin got
their LDL levels to below 70 in the new trial, compared with only 23 percent
taking the 40 milligram dose of Lipitor, Merck and Schering-Plough said.

Together, Zetia and Vytorin had global sales of $344 million in the third
quarter. Some Wall Street analysts expect them to eventually post combined
annual sales of over $8 billion, and to thereby help revive earnings growth for
both struggling drugmakers.

Lipitor, with global annual sales of about $10 billion, has become the world's
top-selling medicine because of its potency against cholesterol and its long
safety record. But Wall Street expects Vytorin, with its apparently greater
potency, to pose increasingly stiff competition to Pfizer's flagship product.

Merck and Schering-Plough both closed up about 1 percent, while Pfizer slipped
1 percent, all on the New York Stock Exchange.

re GTI - i don't want to be too heavy into raw materials and the like at this
point. I think Steel and very likely Oil have seen the best of this cycle, and
even though they are cheap based on P?E they are quite expensive relative to
mid cycle earnings. the Chinese economy appears to cool down rapidly and the
recent interest rate hike confirms that the Chinese government is willing to
take the froth out of the recent boom.

re BUD What i don't like with BUD is that they have been increasing their debt
steadily over the last years, mostly due to the cash spend on stock buybacks.
This has steadily reduced the # of stocks outstanding and subsequently
increased their earnings/share growth rates. I feel that given the current debt
levels this is not going to be sustainable much longer. If BUD bites the bullet
and reduces the stock buyback to conserve cash the earnings growth rates will
fall deep into the single digits which will make a stock with a P/E of 19
anything but cheap.

re VIA - decent report today with revenues up 5 % and "operating" earnings up
12%. Obviously the market has been expecting worse and the stock is up today.
Stock buyback and dividend increase are helping again. S Redstone once again
looks like a smart cookie dumping Blockbuster which is ailing right now. Viacom
may deserve the bad rating they get for corporate governance but i like
Redstone stewartship. FWIW Viab is my largest single stock position right now.

Debt levels aren't so bad. Basically, by borrowing to repurchase share, Bud is
essentially "shifting" capital from one bucket to another. This type of
strategy typically enables the company to lower its WACC thereby allowing the
company to create more "economic value" each period.

I wouldn't be concerned with debt levels. I reckon that Bud is in a fairly
"stable" business and, in some way, perhaps even counter cyclical, i.e. when
the economy sucks, people drink more. They earn about 10x their interest
expense which provides additional borrowing capacity.

Dave, good comment. I do understand that BUD's debt coverage is good with about
10X interest coverage. My argument is simply that I would not pay for the part
of BUD's earnings growth that is simply a result of piling on debt. i think
this is roughly 2% earnings growth/year. Also BUD pays only 5% interest rate on
their *B$+ debt , i think this will go up as interest rates increase.

Anyone here with an opinion on AMNT?

Hard one for me to understand. A business that originates and sells mortgages.

Lots of cash on the books ($6.90/sh with stock selling @$7.94) , and cash
exceeds debt, according to Yahoo. Stock goes for .75x book value.

I don't have enough knowledge/skill to say whether this stock is either safe or
risky. In that case, it must be risky (??).

i sold my omi a few weeks ago.. very early i assume but wanted to take profits
in oil related services. My concern is there is plenty of supply in system or
about to come on stream. Prices will need to come down for demand to pick up.
imo.. oil has always been the peak and vally for decades. I believe we are at
the peak again. but then this maybe the time there is no valley.. but t. boon

how, buying up all the natural gas as it was going to huge shortages in this
country and go bankrupt(he was only two or three decades ahead of his time)...
buying up oil companies , making offers for companies that later were going
broke and had to merge because they couldn't make profits. that drilling and
e&P became so expensive small companies could no longer bid or even join in
partnerships. t.boon now into water... i wish him well. g

ps as for natual gas shortage in this country.. it is short term.. there will
be major building in canada already looking at breaking ground in new Brunswick
to receive liq gas and enter it into pipeline from Sable island to new england.
there will several more plants built in states in the next several years , more
than enough to keep this country in gas.

agreeed, he was "premature" on the end of the NG bubble (predicted for at least
20 years).
the corporate raider gig was not a high note, but very effective and legal. he
did force some big oil companies to get off their A$$ and pay more attention to
shareholder value. He also made a lot of money for himself and his
investors/followers.

as for LNG, yes, that certainly will help the supply side of the equation, but
will it really reduce the price significantly? 5-6-7$ NG will still be very
profitable for US companies. Is there a scenario of a flood of LNG into this
country in a few years as tankers and port facilities come on line? that would
be welcome! There is a huge amount of NG overseas, but getting it here will be
a challenge.
I like CBI - Chicago Bridge, which is quite involved in LNG projects. larry

pickens was a wild and ruthless , somewhat like soros imo he destroy more than
built back when oil companies were doing just fine. sure he shook out some
assest but destroyed a lot. He saw the assest and like a wall street guy went
for the cash immediately vs long term. He was a robber.

tanker business will be good until too many tankers. How many scheduled to be

There is a huge building U.S. Natural Gas Crisis

http://www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net/

The ramifications of Peak Oil are so serious, one of George W. Bush’s energy
advisors, investment banker Matthew Simmons has stated, “The situation is
desperate. This is the world’s biggest serious question,” while comparing the
crisis to the perfect storm: “If you read The Perfect Storm, where a freak
storm materializes out of the convergence of three weather systems, our energy
crisis results from the same phenomenon.”

Simmons’ investment bank, Simmons and Company International, is considered the
most reputable and reliable energy investment bank in the world.

When asked if there is a solution to the impending natural gas crisis, Simmons
responded:

"I don’t think there is one. The solution is to pray. Under the best of
circumstances, if all prayers are answered there will be no crisis for maybe
two years. After that it’s a certainty."

Go listen to this interview or read the excellent book---he believes building
multi-billion LGN terminals is absurd because of long term limited supply of
world NG and expense involved in transporting and storing.

I guess they also make great terrorist targets and no one wants them in their
backyard.

High Noon for Natural Gas: The New Energy Crisis
Darley, Julian

Other reasons:

1) There is no OPEC to solve the North America natural gas supply problem 2)
Problem will last for Years since LNG supplies only a tiny portion of US supply
and there is no way to ramp up for years. 3) Natural Gas demand by new power
plants coming online is skyrocketing-this was a result of a 1998 government
report that forecasted ample supply of natural gas for years to come 4) all the
reasons listed in the best interview and analysis I've ever seen: An Interview
with Andrew Weissman by Bill Powers, Editor Canadian Energy Viewpoint January
4, 2004

http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/powers/2004/0104.html

2) the government's natural gas policy is to hope for warm weather which is
doomed

3) Warren Buffett moved on the area in 2001 and now controls approximately 8%
of the US natural gas pipelines

4) Canadian natural gas is needed to extract oil from oil sands. The oil sands
have placed Canada second in the world in oil reserves. Most are not aware of
this fact. China's biggest state oil companies are considering investment in
Alberta's oil sands. At least the Chinese have it figured out right. There is
enough oil in the oil sands to supply North America for 50 years yet we have
chosen to spend billions upon billions in Middle East defending "our" oil
supplies. Absurd !

Bottom line is there is no solution to solve the North America natural gas
supply problem. This is the reason I've focused on the area for investment and
have made fabulous returns thus far. One of the ones I even discussed here in
January 2004 has since doubled--AOGI. I've even found one that will focus on
China's energy crisis (Americans use approx. 29-30 barrels per day....the
Chinese are at 1.5 barrels per day. A friend just got back from China. More and
more cars.)

gas - here's a nice link for the "worried" among you out there. The intro on
the bottom is worth reading.

http://www.museletter.com/Powerdown.html

and here's another recent book that a friend of mine wrote:

http://www.futurereality.org/

he tells me that he's getting lots of orders from oil companies, US government
agencies and from silicon investors.

so that tells me there's quite a few lurkers on this site, since I only posted
about the book once awhile back. I promised him i would refresh the posting.

(he's not making money on the book -- he paid to get it printed and it took him
years to write it. he's still quite negative, and would be thrilled to
break-even.)

Hi Paul - I sold some January $20 Puts which lands me new shares in January at
a price of $18.80 (as long as the stock sells below $20). I was a bit early as
the $17.5 Puts look attractive now. There is some concern that the company
still holds an over balance of leveraged T-Bill spreads but part of this was
unwound last month. Also, the company landed a huge refinance deal for a
Baltimore CO-OP property with the loan guaranteed by both the State and Feds.
They continue to grow their customer accounts too according to their last
conference call. There has been some chatter that their high dividend may be
reduced next year as earnings are not expected to grow as much as in the past
years. CEO could not provide much vision past 2005. I just hope there are no
more land mines in their balance sheet (similar to the huge leveraged T-Bill
spread that went sour on them last quarter).

My long term target is $27 as long as interest rates remain in the low range
and they can continue to grow their customer accounts.
