OT anybody see the article in barrons today about hermitage fund/ the dead
lawyer/ and the tax collector? Its definitely movie material with some very
funny lines about a very serious subject.
One of the most intriguing stories I have ever read and really should give
investors pause about putting their money in foreign countries especially
russia. Seems pretty clear from the article that people at the highest levels
of government in russia had to have been involved, or they wouldnt be sweeping
this under the rug and the tax collector who declared $500,000 in income over
the past 10 years would not be keeping her $20 million residence outside
moscow, her $4 million dubai condo and her $1 milllion summer house in
Montenegro.

The most sad fact is that in almost all eastern European countries where Russia
had influence corruption has become culture. Stealing is normal. This is why it
is very difficult to invest there if you don't have the "field" data. If you
want to do business there you have to pay bribes, but you can get along without
paying taxes. Greece is the same. We all know the result. I thought the

TOT and other oil/energy stocks

I wonder what the "exit" strategy for those investing (or speculating) in oil
stocks might be. Lybia won't get any more worse (imo) and it's small in terms
of the total pie anyways. If the situation in Lybia get's better (rebels win)
then I think the 15-20$/brl "fear" premium for crude should go away (Imo) and
the oil stocks will reflect that, in particular the Junior plays.

I do own a good chunk of TOT and E - I am holding and neither buying of
selling. Those stocks have not moved up down, but I think they still might
moved, if the unrest in the middle east. Even if the unrest remains I do think
that the current prices may prove unsustainable, at least that was the
experience in Y2008.

Hi Clown-

Re: Total S.A.(NYSE: TOT ) & Other large Integrated Oils

According to the latest McDep report, TOT is ranked as the most undervalued
large integrated oil with a McDep ratio of 0.59.

http://www.mcdep.com/mr110315.pdf

Unless you are a very short term trader, I maintain a core position of several
large integrated oil companies and recently have been building a basket of
small E&P companies. I track these holdings vs the price of crude and have
noticed that w/i the last 30 days that many of the prices I watch have not
moved higher even though crude is testing new highs.

When crude was at $70.00/barrel and moved to $95.00/barrel there was a positive
1:1 correlation w/ all of my oil holdings.

I am investing in companies that have or are building their oil reserves with
the premise that $75.00/barrel will be the longer term minimum price for crude
for the next 2 years. Therefore, I am looking for companies that are low cost
producers (can bring new oil in at or below $40.00/barrel) and are leveraged to
the success of their new well discoveries.

In the last six months, I have been building a 10% portfolio position in small
E&P companies where I believe there are still some very attractive
opportunities (even in the event crude drops down to $75.00/barrel). I am about
70% complete having invested in 17 different companies that have several
development programs scheduled for 2011/2012.

50% of my portfolio has some type of energy theme associated with it. Sectors
include, Midstream operators, pipelines, rail oil tank car leasing, LNG
shippers, offshore Oil Rig financing & support crafts, large integrated oil,
small E&P and other NG specific infrastructure.

As long as the McDep report reflects significant value in the names they track,
my over weighted energy portfolio should continue to do well. It's possible
that if the economy stumbles and the BRIC countries have slower growth, there
could be some softness in crude prices that could impact earnings.

The big long term threat I see are rising (global) interest rates. To date
historical low interest rates have helped E&P companies maintain large CAPEX
budgets and MLP and other midstream operators build out their new
infrastructure programs. Any significant rise in rates will squeeze margins and
reduce their expansion plans. This is the signal I am looking at to back off my
new buys and look to selling some of my more leveraged speculative companies.
Holding a lot of cash is not an option as it currently has a negative
opportunity cost.

I do agree w/ you that there is a "fear" premium of $15-$20 priced into the
current price of crude which should decay over time. The perfect price for
crude s/b $75/barrel-$85/barrel. This will keep the global economy in growth
mode.

Finally, I will be looking at food & commodity prices especially for the BRIC
countries. If these continue to rise I will probably up my natural resource
holdings especially those that grow, process, transport, and distribute food
products world wide (ie. soybeans & salmon farming -my favorite new Fredricksen
company MNHVF). I also expect QE2 to continue much longer than everybody
expects. There will still be some type of quantitative easing in 2012 and
beyond.

Hello Clownbuck,

This is what I'm thinking about every day...

I still have a lot of TOT, but after Libya happened, I moved my E into DKA
which owns positions in TOT, E, Shell, CNOOC, Woodside, etc...

In general I'm trimming my oil position as I think individual stocks are
getting a bit frothy. But, TOT and E both seem to be more undervalued than
most. They both haven't exceeded even their 2010 highs even with Oil so high
(maybe due to the Euro being down). Low forward P/E's and they've got to be
absolutely raking in cash flow as long as oil stays near these levels. I think
TOT will be the last company I trim/sell.

That being said, I agree that there oil should drop again if the middle east
clams down, though I think it will take some time for Libya to start really
producing again even if one side won there. And it does seem like Saudi Arabia
is supplying enough these days to have potentially more global supply than
demand even with Libya down.

But, I also think global oil Demand will continue to increase (mostly from
China) even with these high prices. Not to mention, I also have to think
Japan's going to be importing a lot of oil in the short-term for electricity
use. And then there's the question of Saudi Arabian reserves (whether they
really have what they say they have and how much they're willing to use them in
the short-term). And also, my understanding is that this is the general time of
year when refineries are coming off maintenance and buying a lot of oil and
therefore we generally have a seasonal uptick.

So, there are a bunch of offsetting factors that I think cloud the actual
short-term global supply/demand situation. I'm not sure how it will shake out.
I tend to think we'll go a bit higher as we head into summer (and then fall in
maybe late summer) and I will be trimming my positions now and as we move
through into summer, but I will also be trying to figure out what's happening
with supply/demand to change my view.

It's quite a guessing game in the oil patch. But, to come back to TOT, I
imagine I may hold TOT throughout. I have maybe a 35-40% position of my
portfolio in oil companies, about 5% in TOT and I don't see myself getting all
the way out of oil at any time in the future.

Thanks,

Grant

Why would you have a different exit strategy from other stocks? If stocks are
expensive, sell. If they are cheap, buy. :)

Sure, POI is a big factor. If you can predict oil price collapse below $70,
then you should trade like there's no tomorrow. If you can't, there's no point
IMO. The hesitant/pullback E&P action is already indicating the expectation of
oil price drop. Is market expecting $10 drop? $20? I don't know. I have
lightened my positions in the stocks that IMHO were overvalued and I try not to
buy positions in speculative stocks. However, I cannot predict a price
collapse, so I am not planning to sell stocks that IMHO are still undervalued.
Especially, since I still think that oil will remain high for foreseeable
future (it's amazing that nat gas conversion is not going on with such a huge
nat gas / oil price differential).

E_K_S nice graphic about the Niobara shale. From those independents listed, i
noticed BBG. This is an independent mostly working within the Rocky mountains
area. I have it own my watchlist, because I believe it is a company with a
stellar record of execution in terms of operating and finding cost.Their
earnings don't reflect it but based on my metric for proved reserves in the
ground over EV the stock is not expensive, although not very cheap either.
Their operating metrics very much remind me of CXG, which was folded back into
CNG eventually and was showing relatively little earnings but great reserve
growth.

BBG market cap is about 1.9B$ and they usually operate virtually debt free.
Their proved reserves at 1.1BMCFE, so a MCFE in the ground is valued at
~1.73$/MCFE. That is not super cheap but below the finding cost for most NG E&P
meaning it is cheaper to buy reserves with BBG than drilling for them.

But the most interesting part is that BBG has been able to generate a reserve
growth/share of about 15% annualized over quite some time.

The problem is that BBG is mostly gas without much oil - but still if you can
buy reserves in the stock market cheaper than you can drill for them and then
company is able to grow these reserves at a ~15% clip annualized, you are bound
to make money.

I wonder what others think about my thesis - I just talk myself into buying
this, it seems. This stock has been a quite, no interest whatsoever in boards
and only a handful posts in the BBG thread, which is another big positive, imo.

Re: Bill Barrett Corporation Common (NYSE: BBG )

When researching companies with prospects in the Niobrara region, I looked at
acreage under lease, their drilling CAPEX budget for 2011-2012 and the capital
& debt levels for each company. My premise was to try to identify those
companies with the most aggressive drilling programs (w/ successful JV
partners) and that had the necessary financing in place to complete their
development wells for 2011-2012. I also screened the companies based on their
debt/net income profile (LT debt <= 5x Net Income).

BBG seemed to meet most of the criteria especially the debt/net income screen.
Many of the others I looked at had no net income and failed my debt/net income
screen.

I also looked at what it cost to drill a new well and produce an equivalent
barrel of oil. I wanted this number to be under $40/BOE but it was difficult to
calculate the equivalents for NG. The BOE for NG is not really a good measure
for evaluating NG vs Oil. NG is priced at a historically low price and I expect
a reversion to the mean value over the next 5 years. I also believe OIL is
selling at a $20/barrel premium and is overstated in the conversion. Therefore
the resulting net BOE equivalent for NG may be overstated (especially when
looking at reserves) when adjusting for $109/barrel crude. The standard BTU
conversion is not always that accurate too. Finally, different companies use a
slightly different conversion factor when calcualting their BOE equivalents so
the resultant measures just make company comparisons that more difficult (both
in valuating total BOE reserves and net cost to extract one BOE from a new
developed well).

I really wanted to focus on oily wells especially for the new wells developed
for 2011-2012.

BBG's focus is NG. Even the two new exploratory wells planned for their
Niobrara acreage in 2011 are NG wells.

As a result, I passed on BBG.

For the more mature E&P companies, owning reserves that are below the cost of
new drilling, growing their reserves over 10% per year and having a low
debt/net income profile is valuation criteria that makes for a good long term
investment.

I am anxious to see if anybody else have discovered such emerging and/or
operating companies. Perhaps Marathon Oil Corporation Common NYSE: MRO) or
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC) meet this criteria. Both have been quite
successful developing properties in the Niobrara area.

Samson O&G advised on the three active wells in the North Stockyard Oilfield.
http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=106277

The Earl #1-13H has been under flow back since April 13th but the 19 frac plugs
have yet to be drilled out. The flow rates will be published later this week
when the plugs are expected to be removed. A work over rig is already being
mobilized to the Earl well site, and is presently expected to initiate the plug
drill out either late Tuesday or Wednesday of this week.

After completing the drill out of the Earl well, the work over rig will move to
the Rodney #1-14H location and conduct the drill out of the plugs in that well.

Separately, the drilling rig that is to drill the Everett #1-15H well is
currently being mobilized to the well site. The rig move is being hampered by
poor weather conditions and the spring thaw of the well sites. Upon completion
of the mobilization, the rig owner is planning to undertake repairs to the rig
before commencing drilling, so the spud is currently expected to occur the last
week of April.

BBG's finding cost are <2$ MCF
http://www.billbarrettcorp.com/pdf/2011/032511_Howard_Weil.pdf

Another way to find out their realcost is look at the DDE cost (depletion and
depreciation) in the income or cash flow statement. DDE is nothing other than
the historical cost to find those reserves. According to their 10K, this value
is 2.7$/MCFE. This is not a bad value for the all- in cost.

Most Oil and gas companies will present values for stuff like IRR (internal
return on investment), F&D cost that does not match up with their historical
track record. i would regard what they tell (or sell to ) investors with a
grain of salt. I prefer to see how they actually do, rather than what they
promise.

Even though BBG is not "oily", they have shown am ability to grow reserves from
internal generated funds with a +15%/annual clip and I think they can do this a
couple of years more. This should create shareholder value even at currently
depressed NG prices, with upside for their "oily" part or if NG prices rise.

I don't own it, but it's a good one to watch. All else being equal, I would buy

flow rates are not static and actually decay by as much as 50% over the first
18 months of the well's life.

The initial flow rates (of the test wells) do provide a snap shop as to the
success of the acreage for future wells and how profitable a potential
production field could be.

Also, to maintain high flow rates over the life of the well, they usually limit
the initial flow during the test period. The street usually looks at the
production figures from other drillers in the area and compare these initial
flow reports to value the new field. From my limited observations, the E&P
stock will move higher (or lower) after the initial flow results are reported.
Once the actual monthly production figures are released (in their quarterly
presentations) and continue positive, I have noticed new investors begin to
recognize the potential value in the company.

Some chatter on the SSN Yahoo board reports that the initial flow rates are
about average or even a bit lower than expected. It's all speculation as the
frac plugs have not even been drilled out yet which is necessary in order to
perform the flow test.

SSN has many projects ongoing. The North Stockyard Oilfield is located in
Williams County ND.
http://www.samsonoilandgas.com.au/IRM/content/projects_williamscounty.html

SSN has a 31% working interest in this project. SSN believes that the
[Stockyard] field will ultimately be approved for development on 320 acres, it
is likely that there will be an additional four drilling locations.

Goschen County (Hawk Springs project )(
http://www.samsonoilandgas.com.au/IRM/content/projects_goshencounty.html ) is
another one I am watching closely. This is where their Niobrara property is
located. This is what they call their Hawk Springs project. Management
anticipate several hundreds of barrels of oil a day when finally developed. I
am also awaiting news on their developmental wells for this project and their
plans for the eventual build out of the field.

Sapporo 2501.T. Sold today at 326.5Yen/share - close enough to pre- Tsunami

I guess you mean "close enough to just after Tsunami levels". ;) Pre-Tsunami

It does seem that 10-15% Tsunami discount is rather small. Obviously if you
bought at 260, you made a good 25% gain. Quick fingers there - the price was

Thank's Clownbuck -

This is helpful information to know. However, can't the company under estimate
their actual depletion numbers and can they really be trusted (are they
audited). I believe NOG had an article that stated that the company was
reporting inaccurate depletion figures, thus overstating their actual reserves.
It was a hit piece by some short seller(s) but how can we really trust these
figures?

It is a good place to start in order to determine some type of value.

I agree w/ you on those company presentations. They pretty much show you
selected information that provides the best spin for the company. They also
leave out very important information like "Our latest test well was a dud!"
(check out the latest Rex Energy Corporation (REXX) presentation).

Several years ago I held a position in Royal Dutch Shell and over night their
reserves were reduced by 30% in a press release. Over several years they had
overstated their actual reserves (it's not an exact science as management
claimed) either their depletion numbers were too low or they just lied. The
stocked tanked and as I recall there were no shareholder suits. There was some
management shake ups, committees formed to investigate audit procedures but it
proved to me that stated reserve numbers can and will be wrong.

Value investing exemplifies the art of digging. The more you dig, the better
picture you get into the company and their operations. Sometimes you will find
some hidden assets or nuggets of value that will provide you some confidence in
making an investment. For you to make money. the market must eventually
recognize this value too.

re Sapporo - i bought those on this fateful evening (13th) when the Fukishima
reactor blew up at a price around 257Yen. That day was the low point for the
market and I pretty much got prices close to it. I bought a couple of stocks
that I knew somewhat, as I could not resist the surreal bids that I saw during
the Tokyo stock exchange lunch break (between 7PM and 8:30PM PST). At that
point I have made no decision if it is a short term trade or not. Well it's
pretty much of if goes straight up, it's going to be a trade, if it goes down,
it's going to be a LT holding <g>. Others purchases were Toa Valve (1646
probably a misjudgment of mine, since I later found out that 60% of their
revenues are related to the nuclear business), Sumitomo Rubber (5110), Itochu
(8001), Sumitomo Densetsu (1949).

Overall I am sitting or have realized a decent profit - my position was >20% of
my portfolio total at some point. Now I am hooked on Japan and found quite a
few stocks that I like, including some net- nets.

However I am picky and in addition to good prices, i want a tactical advantage,
so I am waiting for price declines. There is still quite a bit of volatility in
the Japanese market so there is always a clownbuck to be made, I hope.
Currently is a lot of uncertainty about the economy (my guess is we see a 5%
GNP down quarter worst case) but I think those companies i held, all have a
good chance to recover. The situation reminds me a bit of the 10/11 2008
timeframe when the uncertaintly and the volatility were at unprecedented
levels.

Even now after a recovery the values are unbelievable for a Graham style
investor - where can you buy sound business (not too profitable but not cigar
buts either) for literally nothing or almost nothing if you back out the cash
and receivable. There are not just a few, there are dozens of stocks that are
net net or close to it. The question of course is, will this change or will
these stocks just sit there because nobody cares. But that is a risk I am
willing to take if I think the odds are good and the business has some positive
aspects that let me believe that value is created for shareholders. Well I
guess I am hooked on Japan.

I am in the process of opening another IB account (taxable) so I can do more
international trading. The nice thing with IB and international buys in a
margin account is that I don't have to worry about currency, the way I
understand it, it will just create a short position for the purchase amount of
the foreign stock in that foreign currency (yen short position for a Purchase
in Japan). Currently I have it in an IRA which does not allow short positions,
so I need to purchase the currency I want to trade in first - similar to
E*Trade, except that it's fairly cheap. Still it's an extra hassle and I would
rather take the currency risk (of a stock purchase) out with an equivalent
short position in the currency in most cases.

Mysterious Trades in a Big Block of Tokyo Electric Shares Draw Regulators’
Interest
By KEITH BRADSHER
Published: April 18, 2011

TOKYO — Japanese regulators and executives of the Tokyo Electric Power Company
are asking questions about a seemingly coordinated series of stock purchases
two weeks ago that led to an undisclosed buyer or buyers acquiring a large
block of the utility, which owns Japan’s dangerously damaged nuclear power
plant.

Regulators want to know whether the trades, valued at up to $600 million and
placed from Hong Kong during the week of April 3, were structured to circumvent
Japanese securities laws, which require the owner of more than 5 percent of a
publicly traded company to file disclosure papers identifying the shareholder.

Depending on the prices at which the buy orders were executed, they could add
up to nearly 10 percent of Tepco’s shares.

The trading and the questions surrounding it were described by a senior
executive of another company in an interview here. The executive insisted on
anonymity to protect business and government connections.

Regulators are also making informal queries to determine whether the government
of China or any other country might have used its sovereign wealth fund to
finance the purchases, although they could have been made by hedge funds, the
senior executive said.

“They’re really, really pushing, trying to figure out who it was,” the
executive said of the regulators. “There’s somebody out there that holds a
whale of a position, and structured the position in such a way that they don’t
have to file” a mandatory disclosure.

Hiro Hasegawa, a spokesman at Tokyo Electric, widely known here as Tepco,
declined to comment.

The trades were made during a period when the nuclear accident seemed to be
threatening the company with financial disaster. Panicked investors were
dumping Tepco’s shares, with as many as a fifth of the shares changing hands
each day, at prices as low as 292 yen ($3.51) apiece Before the earthquake,
shares of Tepco traded steadily at 2,100 yen ($25.25).

Now the worst of the crisis — after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami damaged
the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant — seems to have passed, although
worries remain about the possibility of powerful aftershocks and another
tsunami.

Hydrogen gas explosions have stopped occurring at the plant, a leak of highly
radioactive water has been plugged and robots are starting to enter the reactor
buildings to assess the potential for long-term repairs.

Government officials are talking about ways to help pay for the cleanup,
including a sales tax or a national surcharge on electricity . Tepco’s shares
have recovered in the last six trading sessions, closing at 467 yen ($5.61) a
share in Tokyo in Monday.

So who was brave enough to buy Tepco’s shares when investors feared its damaged
reactors could release a cloud of radiation toward Tokyo at any moment? That is
what regulators and Tokyo Electric officials are trying to find out.

Hiroyuki Hara, an official at Japan’s Securities and Exchange Surveillance
Commission, said the commission was unable to comment on specific cases or
investigations. He said, however, that the commission had stepped up checks of
market movements in the turmoil after the March 11 disaster, including any
indications of market manipulation or insider trading. He declined to say
whether any investigations had been opened.

Kazushi Sato, an official at the foreign currencies section at the Finance
Ministry, said that an investigation would be started only if there were
grounds to suspect that a foreign investor had pursued ownership totaling over
10 percent of a national security asset without telling Japanese financial
authorities and gaining approval. Not doing so would violate Japanese law. He
said he was not aware that such an investigation had been opened over Tokyo
Electric shares.

An official at the international investment division of Japan’s Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry, which oversees foreign investment in Japanese
utilities, said he was not aware of an investigation into trading of Tokyo
Electric shares.

When six bankers in Hong Kong and Tokyo were asked about the purchases, two
said that they had heard about them but had no idea who was behind them. The
other four said they had heard nothing about the transactions.

Trading records show that investors, fearful of Tepco’s liability from the
accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, dumped hundreds of millions of Tepco’s
shares in the week of April 3. Nearly a fifth of the entire company’s shares,
worth $1.2 billion, changed hands on April 6. More than a tenth of the
company’s shares changed hands each of the other days of the week; trading
volume has gradually dwindled since then.

All of the world’s biggest banks now have offices in Hong Kong. So orders
coming from Hong Kong may not have been placed on behalf of a company,
investment fund or individual located there. The money could be coming from the
banks’ clients all over the world, including in Japan itself.

Japanese officials are quick to look for Chinese involvement in commercial
matters, particularly after China imposed a two-month embargo last autumn on
shipments of crucial rare earth minerals to Japan during a territorial dispute
over islands in the East China Sea.

But bankers said that the China Investment Corporation, the country’s sovereign
wealth fund, seemed like an unlikely buyer of a large stake. China Investment
has tended to avoid controversial acquisitions. The fund declined to comment on
Monday.

A possible buyer might be a Japanese financial institution that did not believe
Japan would allow such a prominent business to collapse.

Business leaders have been hostile to conjecture about an outright
nationalization of Tokyo Electric, which has long been one of the bluest of
Japan’s blue-chip companies and plays a central role in business groups.
Nationalization seemed like a possibility two weeks ago, but has faded from the
political dialogue since then.

Japan to take effective control of TEPCO
Published on April 20, 2011 by admin

Japan to take effective control of TEPCO
Masataka Shimizu, president of Tokyo Electric Power Co (L) and executive
vice-president Takashi Fujimoto (R).

Japan plans to put Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), operator of a stricken
nuclear plant, under effective state control so it can meet its compensation
payments, a report said on Wednesday.

Tokyo will set aside several trillion yen in public funds that TEPCO can dip
into if it runs short for payouts to people affected by radiation leaking from
its Fukushima Daiichi plant, the Yomiuri Shimbun said.

The nuclear power station was damaged by Japan’s March 11 earthquake and
tsunami, and radiation has leaked into the air, soil and sea, forcing tens of
thousands in a 20 kilometre (13 mile) radius to evacuate and leading to bans on
local farm produce.

Shares in TEPCO are down almost 80 per cent since the quake and tsunami on
expectations it will face huge compensation claims totalling around 10 trillion
yen (US$120 billion), according to some estimates.

The Yomiuri said public funds will be stored in the form of interest-free bonds
that can be converted into cash at a body that would be jointly established by
the government and TEPCO, the daily said, citing sources.

The envisaged scheme would allow TEPCO to procure funds from the body to cover
compensation and repay over a long term, while the company will be obliged to
submit a business restructuring plan to the government.

The measure differs to nationalisation, under which the government would own
more than 50 per cent of the company.

Tokyo has denied speculation that it plans to nationalise the beleaguered
utility amid growing public anger at the firm’s response to the crisis and
expectations of a soaring compensation bill.

The government judged it necessary to clarify the responsibility of TEPCO by
letting the company directly pay compensation, the Yomiuri reported.

Tokyo will also bolster its involvement in TEPCO in terms of monitoring the
company’s funds and management in order to avoid disruption to the market and
electricity supply, according to the report.

The government on Friday ordered TEPCO to offer initial payouts to tens of
thousands of people made homeless by the ongoing crisis, with one million yen
going to each family living around the stricken plant.

The daily also reported that TEPCO has started negotiations with its labour
union on slashing several thousand personnel over about five years and cutting
employees’ annual salaries by about 10 per cent.

The utility at the end of last year had more than 36,000 staff.

TEPCO intends to secure funds totalling approximately 400 billion yen through
the restructuring and other measures such as asset sales, the report said.

These tax laws are just inexplicable. Form 1116 was the last straw for me, and
I gave up --- Too tough for me to figure out how to do it on TurboTax, although
other people around SI apparently have little or no trouble with Form 1116.

>>TEPCO: Looks like it will be bailed out, deemed "too big to fail". If this is

I think it is clear that the Japanese government does not want TEPCO to fail.
For one thing my understanding is that Tepco legally does not have to pay for
damages from the nuclear disaster and it would be inconvenient for the Japanese
government to get into a lawsuit about that.

it seems better from there perspective to do a "Tarp" like deal and inject
equity to keep TEPCO alive while calling the shots. Whether that is good for
shareholders remains to be seen; FNM and FRE did not go bankrupt either (again
to inconvenient for the US government) but that does not mean that it's good
for shareholders.

I don't feel like I have an edge calling the different outcomes so I don't

Hedged some of my long exposure with an SPY short position at the close. I'd
rather be short IWM (Russel 200 ETF) but can't get any borrow - how can this be
with a super liquid security like IWM?

MCHB announced earnings after the close to day - 3.8M$ in Q1 2011 earnings
which translates into 200$/share, about flat with last quarter. Tangible equity
is about 14800$/share and in addition they run a wealth management operation
with 1.345B$ in assets under management. Take a very conservative 2% of that as
a value estimate and this another 27M$ or ~140$/share in implied value.
Apparently these guys don't care about splits.

Back in Y2007, this bank made ~1500$/share in earnings and in a "normalized"
environment, they should get this earnings power back, since they did not incur
any dilution during the credit crisis. they have plenty of capacity in increase
lending with ~900M$ in cash and short term investments on their book and an
~15% Tier one ratio. I probably would not have bought this if this bank were
not local. It might take some patience for this to play out.

Hi Madharry -

First time I ever heard of somebody taking delivery for so much gold ($1B). I
wonder if they will hold it w/i the State of Texas? That works out to be around
22.85 tons of gold!

I have been watching my Gold ETF's vs selective special situation miner stocks.
GDXJ is up 7% while RIC is up over 40% from my first buys 3/25/11. I have added
SLW to my watch list but I really do not see the value in many of these
companies unless the commodity prices stay at these levels for some sustained
time.

My strategy is to continue to focus on hard asset value opportunities; Oil &
NG, trees (paper pulp), minerals, food products (soybeans, farmed fish) and
other companies that support the production, processing & distribution of these
commodities.

Too bad I sold the bulk of my silver coins a few years ago but I do own both
platinum & gold coins but they are not as liquid to sell as are the stocks. In
the past, I have used EBay to sell some coins but I am concerned about the
safety especially w/ personal information.

I thought I might use a larger Coin broker to help me w/ transactions. Do you
use one that is fair and keeps information private. Here is one I have been
considering.

http://bullion.nwtmint.com/index.php

Like my other broker accounts, it seems that it might be good to have a
legitimate coin broker account set up (w/ all wire transfer acct info) so
transactions can be made seamless. Is there an advantage to setting up
something in Canada rather than in the US?

The only thing I can think of is they plan to set up their own ETF type fund

know, some management adviser may have talked them into such a strategy.

I wonder how many other large institutions are looking at the delivery option?

I think if we see much more of this, it may be getting into bubble territory.

GFRE-I just have a boat load of it and my confidence has really dwindled as
time goes on and there is no announcement of a buy back of shares despite many
exhortations of shareholders to do so. The last situation that even remotely
resembles this one, i asked for shareholder info on a small company the seem
very cheap and the company never responded and a week later they announced some
kind of buy out. This am i was thinking that it must be very difficult for them
to find an investment that would payoff nearly as well at thispoint as buying
their company stock so I can certainly understand people being suspicious of
the company at this point. I own so much of it that if ever sells at a normal
price like $20 i will do plenty well. if it goes down the tubes I will be
unhappy enough and see no reason to add to potential sorrows.

Reno4 - I don't know what this graph about "excess reserves" means - I am not
even clear about what "Excess reserves" really are.

The sharp increases in this "whatever" still seems bothersome - it is just one
example of the chiefs at the Federal reserve and treasury yanking on so many
levers to do this or that (many of which have never been tried before) that it
makes my head spin. I don't even believe that economist are in agreement what
this might do in the longer run. The fact is however that the US government
runs a huge deficit (~1Trillion annually) and the Federal reserve has been
buying longer dated assets Treasuries) at the same clip (1Trillion annually)
which in my opinion is similar to financing LT assets with short term
liabilities. Any banker will tell you that this might work for a long time
until it blows up and most likely spectacular so.

I for myself decided after the Y2008 disaster to bring macro in consideration
too. I stick with a value theme but decided to avoid equities that are
extremely dependent on easy money and in addition decided to keep a much larger
portion of funds in cash usually, only to be deployed in a hit and run
situations like the Japan Tsunami, Flash crash or individual equity special
situations (like bank secondaries etc.). Nowadays, I like to keep 30-40% in
cash (to be deployed in special situation), the rest in equities and I try to
hedge some market risk with short positions or puts when it seems reasonable.
Right now, putting in some hedge in place seems like a very reasonable risk
reward.

However, this should not prevent anyone to put money into a stock when it looks
really compelling, so don't forget to post your value idea here :-).

I too own a boatload of GFRE and likewise am stressed out and greatly confused.
Rylee said the market is rarely wrong and GFRE is certainly selling as if it is
a fraud. However, there are extraordinary circumstances that I believe and I
guess at this point am hopeful that explain the current pps:

Hedge fund HAP selling it's 6M shares after its lockup ended ended a couple
months back and more importantly the fear of HAP selling its shares.

When GFRE slid under $5, some institutions had to bail as they cannot hold
issues under 5 - please correct me if I am wrong on this.

Unlike other legit companies which have recently rallied like CAAS, LIWA and
YONG, GFRE has not made good on it's buyback and the lack of Q&A on the last
conference call really threw a curve ball at the market and institutional
holders in particular.

So, the above reasons are what I come up with to explain what is going on
assuming GFRE is legit.

Here's why I think and again at this point, hope GFRE is legit:

BDO signed off on March 16, well after some high profile fraud blowups like
CCME and together with BDO's adverse opinion on GFRE's internal controls, BDO
had to turn over every stone is aditing GFRE's balances and records as they
could not rely on their internal controls. I have to believe they went to
extraordinary lenghts to audit the balance sheet including cash. I also know
they compared GFRE's SEC filings with GFRE's SAIC and SAT filings as part of
their audit.

There is no doubt that GFRE produces bromine and bromine is nearly $5,000 M/T.
Their production was certified by government and industry association
certifications last December as part of GFRE's response to fraud allegations.

GFRE has repeatedly asserted its honesty and financial statement accuracy... no
other blowups have done this.

GFRE engaged Deloitte to help improve internal controls... what fraud has done
anything like this? This is a key point in my mind.

GFRE management is tightly connected politically with the Party. In fact,
GFRE's chairman is a local political bigwig. Fraud would seem out of the
question because of this.

In summary, it's hard to explain the current price and on the surface the price
"says" a hit piece is imminent. For GFRE to be fraud, there would have to be
collusion with bank personel, local government, SAIC and local industry
assoction and for BDO to have missed all this collusion... Not out of the
question, but highly doubtful?
It's been many months and nothing has surfaced except last December's anonymous
allegations which were rounded defeated by GFRE. Why is this? There has been
more than ample time for the short bloggers to do their DD on GFRE and you can
bet they certainly have and yet we've heard nothing. Everyday that goes by
without news makes GFRE more legit because it hasn't been attacked.

If you can add something here, I'd be most appreciated as I'm nervously
scratching my head.
Thanks,

Joel

For a .PK stock the spreads are not bad, although I still hate to see a 2.5%

Marine Harvest Q1 profit, harvest rises 14-Apr-11 08:23 am
http://www.forexyard.com/en/news/Marine-Harvest-Q1-profit-harvest-rises-2011-04
14T061755Z-UPDATE-1

'OSLO, April 14 (Reuters) - World number one fish farmer Marine Harvest said
first-quarter operating profit soared from a year ago as harvest volumes
exceeded expectations.

<u>Operating profit at the Norwegian company grew 58 percent to about 960
million crowns ($176.6 million)</u>, it said on Thursday in an update of its
earnings before the full quarterly report next month.

The total salmon harvest of 76,000 tonnes beat its forecast from the previous
quarter of 73,000 tonnes. In the first quarter last year, total harvest was
73,061 tonnes.'

-------------------------------------------------------------------

After three years of operation, they are finally hitting their profit targets.
Overall profit margins are now around 20%, there is strong demand for their
processed products and they seem to have worked out their farming operational
bugs too.

The company has a high book value and carriers a small amount of debt compared
to their net income. Marine Harvest has a stated policy of returning a minimum
of 75% of free cash flow as dividends to shareholders, Marine Harvest also
looks quite promising as a dividend growth play as the company continues on
with its aforementioned growth.

Marine Harvest is not really a small cap. Yahoo numbers are way off:

My numbers 3.574B Shares @6.6 NOK/each *0.185 (US$/NOK Xchange rate): 4.36B$ in
market cap.

Equity is about 12B NOK or about 3.35NOK, this stock trades at 2x book. in 2008
the stock went below 1NOK when they racked up a huge loss because their Chilean
operation got wiped out, because of a disease. Diseases are one of the big
problems with sea farming, once a site get's infected it's almost impossible to
control the spread in water and the whole crop of fish is lost or possibly even
worse, the site is lost because disease cannot be controlled and the infectant
stays.

Kind of strikes me as unsustainable to issue dividends in excess of earnings
with such a high risk operation as they have done the last couple of years.
based on estimated earnings for Y2011 (they should get north of 1NOK/share if
everything goes well) the PE is below 6x so the stock is in fact cheap.

Great find!

Hello Jurgis,

Re: XNPT cash:

I've got $108M from Yahoo and their last quarterly report. And then, my
understanding is that based on approval of their drug, they get mileston
partner payments of $7M from their Japanese Partner and $30M from GSK. Those
may or may not be paid out yet, but eventually that's cash on hand.

So, maybe, we're looking at $145M?

With the operating cash bleed of 50-60M per year, this is less exciting than I

Hello Jurgis,

Yes, good point. It's total cash of $145M in the next few months, as opposed to
an additional $145M. I can see how the latter would be much more exciting. :)

I'm hoping/assuming the cash bleed is much less now with RLS royalties and
milestone payments coming in over the next year or two, but it does depend on
the success of the RLS drug and therefore may be more of a growth play. It's
hard to find value characteristics in small biotechs, but I will keep trying.
:)

Maybe the main value characteristic is that at least on a relative valuation
basis today, I generally see companies trading around $140M enterprise value
($285M market cap - $145M cash) if they have zero drugs approved. The fact that
the company is trading at this level with one drug approved and two more drugs
in Phase 2/3 (at least 2, not sure about more) makes it a value to me.

But, I also think it's not a normal value play in the way that we tend to
examine stocks here. And so I understand your view that it's somewhat cheap but
you will probably pass.

Thanks,

Grant

You are right about diseases wiping out a crop of fish. Last Friday Marine
Harvest discovered the PD-virus at one of their Norway farms. A two year old
crop of fish must be harvested early. Not sure how much they are able to keep.
Even with the best technologies diseases can still pose production issues.

<u>Fish farming giant Marine Harvest to face cull of over 680,000 farmed
salmon</u>
April 14, 2011
Reported in Adressa:

Marine Harvest is to face a cull of over 680,000 farmed salmon, due to the
highly contagious pancreas disease (PD) at an aqua-industry site in Central
Norway.

After taking samples of dead fish last Friday (15. April), Marine Harvest sent
the fish to the laboratory for closer analyses. These showed a low incidence of
the PD-virus.

The salmon at the site are just under 2 years old and have grown to an average
weight of approx. 4.5 kilos.

Marine Harvest has in consultation with the FSA (Food Safety Agency) introduced
additional security measures at the site and the Agency has formally put a curb
on the site.

Neighbouring sites are already notified, and the nearest plant belongs to
Sinkaberg Hansen, (the family owned company of the Norwegian Fishery Minister,
Mrs. Berg-Hansen) and is located 7 km from the curbed site.

In addition to implementing security measures, Marine Harvest will now seek the
FSA to accelerate the harvesting of fish from the site. This is done to reduce
the likelihood of the virus to spread, causing additional outbreak in the
nearby area. Communications Director Jorgen Christiansen, Marine Harvest said
that one hope to get started with the slaughter within a week.

Highly contagious PD is caused by the Salmonid Alphavirus (SAV) and the disease
is found in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, and is very contagious. This is
the first incident detected in the Nord-Tr&#248;ndelag County of Norway. The
SAV has previously been found at a Marine Harvest aqua site in 2009, on the
island of Sm&#248;la.

Reminds me of the outbreaks of avian influenza in the poultry industry. The
concentration of poultry farms in the Delmarva penninsula led to the
destruction of millions of birds in the eighties...and there is an occasional
outbreak every so often. These things happen as a result of geographically
concentrated high volume living organisms. Poultry industry is pretty well
concentrated in AK, NC, GA, and Delmarva. Increases the risk of infection.

AV can wipe out an entire barn of chickens within 24 hours. (That's why there
was so much concern about H5N1 -- if the virus was able to evolve to
human-to-human and had the same mortality rate, extremely serious.)

The poultry industry is well organized to take immediate containment measures.
I remember all flocks in the geographic area were destroyed, workers and trucks
going onto the premises had to have antiseptic baths to prevent the spread of
the disease. USDA and state health authorities monitor and respond immediately
to the inevitable outbreaks very well. I wonder if fish farming is on the way
towards that type of industry response, or whether they are still in the
developmental/ad hoc response stage....

this represents about a 5% portfolio position. my guess is that they anticipate
holding that % more or less intheir portfolio and will most likely rebalance
periodically. To me it means that there are new increased long term demand for
gold, and now possibly silver. I love how all the people who didnt think it was
worth buying at $600 are so quick to offer an opinion that its time to be
cautions now that its above $1500. I dont think anyone is qualified to offer
what will be an equilibrium level for either gold or silver at this point. I
can only tell you that I had an opportunity to purchase some silver bullion at
slightly below spot rates recently, mentioned it to a few of my friends. No one
showed the least bit of interest in it. My wife asked me why I was buying it as
well. She was only slightly mollified when I told her that I was already making
a profit on it. If I get all I ve requested it will be about 100 ounces. so we
werent talking real big numbers here.

I think that when interest rates start to rise even more people will switch
some of their portfolio to gold and silver. especially the baby boomer
generation who have most of their future income stream as some combination of
bonds, social security and fixed annuities, in other words very little
protectoin from either inflaton or dollar devaluation. most of the retirement
literature that ive read seem more concerned about recurrence of a severe
dollar decline than inflation and dollar decline. Now I see people are retiring
at 65 and they can expect to look forward to 25 years of inflation and dollar
declines so how does a portfolio of 65% dollar denominated bonds and 35% stocks
help them? even if you own your own house you still need to pay all sorts of
variable costs that keep rising with inflation unless you happen to live in an
area that fixes property taxes at a certain age.

re Fish farming -
How do you contain a waterborne disease agent? This is much harder to do than
with poultry that live in an enclosed environment (building) imo.
Also keep in mind that there are native fish around, including native wild
salmon around that can spread the disease from one location to the other.

The cross contamination of wild fish is one of the main reason why fish farming
is not that popular in many circles. With the risk of entire crops being
destroyed, I cannot see how paying a dividend close to 100% of the earnings is
sustainable. It has happened before in 2008 an if you look, Marine Harvest
equity is still lower than it was in 2007.

I think this is a little bit of a gamble operation.

Re: Fish farming - A business model to feed the emerging 3rd world markets

I noticed that Marine Harvest hedges their fish production with future forward
contacts. I wonder if they carry some type of insurance for catastrophic
disease loss similar to what farmers buy for crop insurance due to weather. If
so, these events can be managed with insurance coverage and added as a cost of
doing business.

The operation technology is still emerging and perhaps through breading they
can produce strains that are less susceptible to these viruses.

I do know that fish farming is one of the most efficient ways to convert feed
(usually soy beans and grains) into food protein. I know that China is the
worlds biggest consumer of chicken eggs and in time they will demand other
proteins like chickens and fish.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Like w/ traditional land based farming, I believe fish farming will eventually
become an efficient way to produce renewable high demand protein. I am betting
that these contamination virus events will eventually be controlled through new
bio-technologies. The value proposition may really lie w/ the advancement of
their production technologies (ie. patents on the non virus susceptible genetic
breeds) rather than with the annual farm's production. I will have to do more
research to see what sort of R&D patents they hold and/or might be developing.

I am not sure if their business has enough production history to justify their
very attractive dividend policy.
