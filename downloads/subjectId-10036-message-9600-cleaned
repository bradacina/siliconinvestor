OT I purchased WMB today. What I call a contrarian hybrid value play. WMB owns
over 80% of WCG which has a cross country fiber system, a communications
counsulting group and
wireless interests in different areas. looks like by investing in WMB you get
WCG at the market price and the energy business which is significant is free.
WMB price looks like it has not appreciated in about 2 years and I think these
guys know what they are doing. It also looks like there have been insider
purchases this year which I like. THQI thank goodness is rebounding, I think it
will be at least 50% higher in the next year or two. I am also buying more
MADGF at these levels. I beleive it is in never never land. The day traders are
now out, the long term investors are not in yet, the long long term investors
have thrown in the towel, but the company has reinvented itself as witness the
agreement with Real Networks. I also like the fact that Robert Madge owns
around 50% of the company so that management and long term shareholder
interests coincide. I am hopeful that this is the beginning of a long term
uptrend in the stock.

Anyone follow HRC?

-g- Just joking Dr. Burry. HRC seems to be okay as a speculative buy imo. I'm
following you in, albeit at a higher price, today.

I see in my newspaper, budget surplus is going to be larger than "anyone"
expected. Which suggests increased chances to increase funds for healthcare. I
just cannot believe we as a country will not give more support to poor/elderly
when we apparently have the funds to provide assistance to them.

So, imo, HRC should be able to improve its situation.

Meanwhile HRC insiders continue to buy, buy. Which offsets somewhat my concerns
about the negatives (uncollected revenues, etc) detailed at the Mike Burry
website.

PSR, p/bv are relatively low. Stock is up to 6+ today. Not the best day to be

Armin, re Madgf, we need one more buyer on the value thread to make the magic

to net out under 5 on the addition. Hopefully there is more than hype to the
Real Networks story.
FWIW, MAJ may be worthy of boards consideration. Recent news of retail sales

OK, you don't want to buy a basketful of net-nets? How about just one. Sorry,
but a day late. Government Technology Services, a computer distributor to
government accounts, trades as GTSI. This has been a net-net off and on (mostly
on) for a while now and it has always been on my borderline buy list. Net-net
value is about 4, and it was trading under 3 last Thursday when rumors of a
deal with Redhat to distribute Linux started to come out. I bought at 4 at
today's open and it closed above 5 on huge volume. Maybe its too late, maybe
not.

I just looked at this as 1) if you can't beat 'em join 'em, but on my terms;
and 2) an asymetric risk-reward in the very short term. Whatever the economics
of distributing Linux, here we have a stock with a downside of about 3 that
could have a reasonable shot at an exponential move if the day traders were to
discover it. It has a very small float. The rumor alone has nearly doubled the
stock already, on building volume.

I know, not a usual Jim Clarke type pick, but I did purchase it right at
net-net value. Just bought a small amount to see what happens. Probably at
least worth watching to see if value and Linux can mix.

I can't believe that BK of that percentage of SNH base won't have SOME adverse
consequences - including the possible liquidation of some of those folks, with
SNH getting the property back with no income for an indefinite period of time,
and a resulting cut in the dividend. It seems to me that the investment issue
is whether this is more than adequately reflected in the price, with an
analysis required sort of like when Michael Price used to buy debt of BK
companies.

I don't have the expertise to do this, but am curious what you guys think.

Of course tenant bankruptcies will have an adverse impact on cash flows. But
the stock yields over 20%. If you want a number to think about, consider a
dividend cut to the $1.85-$2.05 range, with that dividend being secure beyond a
reasonable doubt. I don't think the stock trades at $12 after things stabilize,
and until they do I can pocket 50 or 60 cents each quarter on a $12 share
price.

These tenant bankruptices were fully expected. It was not a probability
calculation - I just assumed they were going under and the properties would
re-lease at rents dictated by the underlying property economics.

Good question on HRP - they still own 50% of SNH, so you'd think if SNH were

$65,000 is probably high for much of what SNH owns. Traditional nursing homes,

maybe 25K, but then the senior apartment segment of the portfolio is more
valuable.

Sell side analysts are funny. AG Edwards downgrades SNH to a "Maintain

JOE is stuck at $23-$24, but looks more like value to me every day. JOE's FLA
stake is now worth $10/share, 800,000 acres timber are for sale and worth
another $6/share (at $800/acre), you're left with $8/share for the remaining
200,000+ acres of developable land (incl. 40 miles of beachfront) plus real
estate operating companies.

One key point from the Anestis interview is that "St. Joe will be submitting a
revenue ruling request that we hope will be approved by the IRS in the late
spring." Sounds like the spinoff is proceeding a bit slower than anticipated,
but FLA is eager for it to come off.

PMCO - except for the good will, and the lack of insider buying.

I would want to know what all these 144 filings are about. I would also want to
know the amortization period for the good will. If, in this industry, the price
anyone paid for any acquisition in the past is questionable now, as I think it
is, using a 20 year amortization period is really stretching things (if that
was done) - and means earnings are overstated. For example, $10 of good will
per share amortized over 20 years instead of 5 means $1.50 per share pretax
lower amortization charges -- and I am skeptical of assuming a value of a
health care service business of over 5 years, with government in the picture.

It took me a month, but I just finished the last page of Ben Graham's 1934
edition of Security Analysis. If you have not read this, you should. If you
have plodded through the agonizing prose of the Fifth Edition, you need to
recognize this is a different book. When you put the two side by side (I have
them both) its like night and day. (Graham didn't write the Fifth Edition, and
over four editions, it seems like the game whisper down the lane, where the
original sentence comes out unrecognizable after five repeats). There is only
one investment text I have ever read, and I have read most of them, that is
close. And that is the complete compilation of Berkshire annuals.

Graham has a reputation for being boring. Some parts of the book are - he
starts with 250 pages on bonds which has some pearls of wisdom, but is pretty
boring. If you want to skip that, read the first chapter, then skip to the
chapter on speculative bonds, which leads into the 300 pages on common stocks
and financial statement analysis. I find him to be quite entertaining. Very
funny at times, but only if you really understand where he's coming from. This
is by no means a book for beginners, but the kind of thing the regular
contributors to this thread should eat up.

Writing in 1934, Graham was looking at a market that had dropped by 90% after a
"new-era" bull market much like today's. In his description of the good times
before the crash, we see some familiar faces. They had "tech stocks" then -
although they are things like radios. There were stocks trading at 100 times
earnings that didn't earn a dime two years before. He writes a whole chapter
about the evils of stock options. Several chapters have detailed analysis of
what we call today manipulative use of "one-time charges". They even had crazy
IPOs then. And the psychology he describes in 1929 looks very much like today.

And in 1932 40% of all stocks on the market traded below net current assets at
some point during the year. Which is why what scared me the most about this
book is that it does not seem dated at all. I won't say it could have been
written yesterday, but I will say it could have been written in 2004.

History doesn't necessarily repeat, but it often rhymes.

Buffett biographer Roger Lowenstein has written up value investing in his
"Unconventional Wisdom" column in the Feb. 2000 issue of SmartMoney magazine.

This is no surprise--value is Lowenstein's home turf. He makes a very basic
case for value, geared toward SmartMoney's time-impaired readers. None of his
points will be news to anyone on this board. Still, it is worth reading,
especially in these times when price has become a secondary consideration for
many "investors".

I don't think the print articles from SmartMoney are available on the web (most
of it isn't worth reading, anyway, IMO). A few excerpts:

"This is a fabulous time to be buying value stocks and value-oriented mutual
funds...The time to buy them is now. Right now."

"On a relative basis, newspapers are even cheaper than they were in the '70s.
Incredibly, you could buy every public newspaper company for less than the
market value of Yahoo!"

"On an absolute basis, newspaper stocks are more expensive than in the '70s,
but they are still compelling."

[Lowenstein doesn't say it explicitly, but the obvious conclusion to these two
points is that the majority of the market is EXTREMELY expensive on an absolute
basis.]

"The true polar opposite of value isn't 'growth' but momentum, and just as
value is at a low, these are glory days for momentum investors."

"Good value is its own catalyst. You never know why or when stocks are going to
move."

"Their cheap price is a measure of their potential, not their risk."

"Today is anything but a terrible time for value investing. It's the best time
in years."

[Lowenstein notes the reinsurance and supermarket sectors in particular.]

FWIW, there was also a "Contrarian" article in the same issue on Furniture
Brands Int'l (FBN), which made a value case for FBN.

Some interesting observances I have read in this week's of issue of Business

Concerning the Surge in M3 Growth

Paul L. Kasriel of Chicago's Northern Trust Co. thinks the recent explosion in
M3 has more to do with strong credit demands in the economy than with past Y2K
concerns. And that suggests that the Fed will be far more aggressive in pushing
up rates in coming months than many people expect.

Greenspan thoughts on Future Risk

However, as memories of the Depression fade and the economy enters an era of
technology-driven change, Greenspan argues that at least part of the recent
decline in risk aversion should be permanent. "The rise in availability of
real-time information has reduced uncertainties," Greenspan said in his Oct. 14
speech.

For me, it's the $64,000 question.

It's been noted here before, but one of the biggest traps that novice value
investors can fall into is that of the "growth at a value price" when in fact
the market already is just showing that it knows that the barriers to entry
simply splinter in the face of fresh capital.

What really gets me about the internets is not so much the valuations, but that
so much of it is indefensible. For instance, Exodus Communications is borrowing
$1 billion at 10% to build data centers round the world. Intel could do the
same thing, with greater brand name, and would hardly have to borrow to do it.
And if it did, it could borrow at much less than 10%, and provide much of its
own hardware.

Now, it's easy to pick on the Exoduses of the world, but the teasers with PE's

The company is THQI feel free to pick holes in it. My only knock on the company
is that I would be happier if management owned a decent sized chunk of it. You
are familiar with MWY, I think THQI has demonstrated that it is a better run
company. BTW I do not know why you mention internets most of them have no
return on equity at all. Certainly unless something is patented there are no
barriers to entry. THQI has shown that they have been able to deliver hit video
games in a variety of genres. They have long term rights to many of those
properties. Anyone can publish a video game but they also have to be able to
make it entertaining, market and make it and distribute it at a low enough
cost. THQI has made great strides in the past year by acquiring a distributor
in EUrope, a couple videogame developers and now a company geared toward
internet video games. My fear is that they will be acquired by a media
conglomerate like Newscorp or TImE Warner before they can produce the several
years of continued strong growth that I anticipate.

I just watched Greenspan's speech on CSPAN. My favorite line was "If a trend

Greenspan speech. One minute he sounds like he's telling you to short the
market, the next minute he's telling you to buy tech stocks. My read is that he
does not want to go down in history as the guy who broke the bubble. I don't

Armin, this idea is not original with me, but I have heard these video game
software companies referred to as sort of like movie companies.
I think this is not a ridiculous comparison and my recollection is that when
there were several publicly trading movie companies they did not carry
especially high P/E's -- because they had event risk - a series of flops and
there go earnings, as MWY sort of had for a while.

I would also add that I think the game console paradigm for the industry has
more risk of shifting somewhere else, like the PC or the Internet, than 10
years ago when there were no potential alternatives.
This might or might not have some impact on the valuation - sort of like laser
surgery is not good for the valuation of solidly growing contact lens company
COO, even though it has minimal actual impact on their business.

Wright - thank you for your post on the Lowenstein article. I think that it's
important for value investors to be willing to explore the 'road not taken'.

I had to chuckle this AM because as I posted during December 1999, my January
Effect vehicle was BRKb. In final frustration because BRKb had a 'painting the
tape' bounce on 12/31, I bought WSC. All of this was predicated on exploiting
Buffett and Munger's ability to spot value. I was guessing that WSC was about
to be merged into BRK.

Now I see that WSC has sopped up their free cash by buying CBZ. Office
furniture stocks such as Steelcase WERE discussed on this board, because they
were looking cheap. No one ever thought out of the box enough to consider what
the dotcom industry does to traditional industry. In the spirit of "Why didn't
I think of that?", I realize that I have had personal experience with virtual
companies that appear out of nowhere, grow very fast, merge, die, and reappear.
An axiom in silicon valley is that doing business in a garage is fun history,
but if you want to get VC funding, you need to inhabit some credible-looking
space with partitions and 5-legged roll-about chairs. To buy it requires
capital that's not available before IPO. CORT makes sense.

Who says Buffett doesn't understand technology?

Then I saw this on Yahoo: << some of the posts on the CORT message Board say it
owns a company called HOMESTORE.com, which was featured in Forbes January 10. I
can't tell much about this company, but one message says that CORT owned $18
million worth of HOMS when HOMS was $41.1 a share, and today HOMS is $81 a
share. >>

Which may indicate that WSC is buying a Buffett-type stock that contains a
hidden cigar butt.

"Have you considered how the margins of airlines will fare if oil sustains

Fluctuations in fuel costs effect ALL airlines. Resulting fare increases would
likely mean lower passenger miles and reduced margins. However, the impact is
greater on some than others.

I considered this when I chose to buy MAIR. They have shown consistent earnings
growth over the last six years in spite of fuel price fluctuations because they
serve markets with minimal to no competition using fuel efficient planes. Far
different than competing on a New York to Paris with a 747.

I might be wrong, but I've taken a small position. They are reporting good fare
increases in the Dec Q and IMO it will be reflected in earnings.

I smiled at your recent post on Cort and Buffet's understanding of technology.
Buffet understands smart management and a quality businesses at a good price.
Cort has a great business model and a talented management that was also smart
enough to make a $3 million investment in Springstreet.com, which then merged
into Homestore.com. Cort's September 30 10Q, showed this $3 million investment
had increased to $18 million (HOMS was @ $40 at the time). Today, HOMS is now
worth(?), but sells for $80+ (and would of course, be truly valued at market
value less taxes which would be due on sale).
Interestingly enough, this smart management team, carries the investment in
HOMS as a marketable security on their financial statements and can sell 90% of
this investment in February 2000 and the remaining 10% in August 2000.
Very careful following of this company resulted in both AGONY and then ECSTASY
in my portfolio.
I loved the company and its operations and took a large position in the company
as a long term investment last year in the mid-high teens. Then came the
management buy out at $25 about six months ago, (not exactly how I expected to
ride alongside citicorp venture capital (44% owner)and jointly monitize our
investment).
But I felt the company's predictable earnings, increasing cash flow, HOMS
investment and a very low takeover price would assure a quick buyout and
ultimately benefit management and Citicorp. Therefore I doubled up my position
around $22.50, expecting to add to my profit with a little low risk takeover
arbitrage. I thought having 60% of my portfolio in Cort would now be a great
easy, no problem profitable investment. I seem to remember - a fool and his/her
money are soon parted.
A third party, Brooks, raised the ante when they stated publicly in a press
release and over an internet chat that his firm was willing to offer $28 cash
for Cort and had the financing arranged for the buyout with a reputable third
party.
I was ECSTATIC (more profit), but management and citicorp did not want an
independent third party to take over Cort, and they refused to engage Brooks in
discussions. Litigation and more delay. Citicorp also had the SBA looking over
their shoulder quite closely because their investment was made in an SBIC
vehicle.
Great artcle summarizing Brook's position appeared in USA Today, about
shareholders in small companies not being able to get a fair shake from
management led takeovers, when shares of a small company are unloved and
undervalued (using CBZ as an example).
T Rowe Price - with over 10% of Cort shares,refused to go along with the
management led buy-out.
After much discussion, management raised their offer to Cort shareholders, not
to the $28.00 cash which Brooks had tried to offer Cort, but to $25.50 in cash
and $2.50 in paper. A few weeks later management claimed they could not arrange
the financing for the buyout transaction. NO BUYOUT AND STOCK DROPS - no quick
profit - rather a loss.
What a mess and AGONY for shareholders (like me)who felt they had done
substantial due diligence and then were blindsided by what appeared to be a
great management, which had a very respected 44% shareholder, but who together
appeared to place profit over a fair, just and equitable transaction for all
parties.
After expecting some quick resolution, and no action for the last six or seven
weeks, with a stock now slightly below my average purchase price, I reluctantly
placed orders this week to sell enough shares to bring my holdings down to a
normal size position. Prudence over greed. My sell orders were placed around
$17.50 but they were not filled and have now been cancelled(luck anytime over
skill).
Imagine my ECSTASY when I glanced at the recent news release, which said two of
the greatest investors in the world (Buffet and Munger), agreed with my due
diligence, and they were willing to pay a 67% premium to all Cort shareholders.
I am sure the position became available to Buffet/Munger ONLY because shrewd
investors like Citigroup and T Rowe Price, and an excellent CBZ management
team, got themselves entangled in a position wherein they were unable to
unravel the problems and resolve easily and equitably without extensive time
delays and litigation expenses.
So Buffet and Munger were called upon and they were able to add a jewel of a
company to their portfolio at a very reasonable price and provide all parties
with a fair, just and equitable solution to a difficult problem.
Hope this background information provides some interesting insight to your
post. Although I am sorry for such a long first post, I have lurked on this
thread for some time, and was waiting for the right opportunity to add a tidbit
of knowledge/information, and to also say THANK YOU to James Clarke, Paul

Wright, you quoted Lowenstein saying "The true polar opposite of value isn't
'growth' but momentum". That really really made me think.

So many institutional value managers (actually just about every one I know) are
trying to work momentum into their value strategy by avoiding stocks with
falling estimates, avoiding stocks hitting new lows or with declining relative
strength, or trying to buy only when the stock is already rising. I fight hard
against such ideas within my own firm, but it is what our clients want to hear,
and in an environment like this for value investors you have to think about
survival. But this is why stocks with falling estimates, poor relative strength
and temporary problems trade at ridiculous prices - my mission in life as a
value investor is to take the other side of that trade, especially if everybody
else who calls himself a value investor is afraid to join me. The problem comes
when you are early - if even value investors are playing the momentum game, to
be early is to be killed. The response of a "momentum-value investor" would be
that this keeps me from being early. Pull up two charts - CMH and KM. These
momentum value investors piled into CMH at 10-11 and KM at 11 a month ago.
Those were not good trades - you could have bought the same business 20%
cheaper before, and after. They are piling into HRC now - we'll see how that
one turns out.

I'll add that line to my lexicon, because the more I think about it the more I
realize he's right. I have never been one to say that value and growth are
incompatable - I, like Charlie Munger, consider growth simply a tool to value
companies. The notion in institutional investing that a low multiple by
definition equals value is a terrible misunderstanding of the meaning of
"value".

But momentum by definition is buying what other investors want at the moment. I
don't see any other way to cut that one. Value investing is precisely the
opposite in my view, and to try to mix the two may have worked better than
value investing last year, but I wouldn't make my long-run bets on that basis.

The way I think about momentum is that these are the "investors" I want to sell
to. The best value investments are the ones that turn into "momentum
investments" for somebody else.

I agree with your comments entirely- however THQI is a publisher of video games
that mean that their talents are independent of the means of transmitting the
video game. For example how much did Disney stock, a movie maker, benefit from
the popularity of the VCR. The more means of getting the product into the hands
of the consumer the more money that THQI is going to make. ALternatively the
more valuable it becomes as a acquisition candidate for a multimedia company.

Deb - Thank you for putting this deal into context. Nothing better than to
demonstrate facts flying in the face of reason.

I do believe that these two guys understand technology better than most of us.
They understand how technology will change the way business will be operated in
the future. This thought was driven home to me at the Wesco annual meeting last
year. I sat next to Lou Simpson, who lucidly described how GEICO was going to
buy market share, and later harvest their economies of operation in the auto
insurance market. (Concepts of direct distribution is very similar to what is
talked about by the Barron's Roundtable beginning this weekend.)

The way you describe the CORT fight reminds me of the old adage "when the
elephants fight, the grass gets trampled".
I guess that one take-home message might be to identify great businesses, and
then be willing to wait patiently with the bat on shoulder until the pitch
(price) gets so fat (skinny) you just can't lay off. And another take-home
lesson might be the very real risks of merger arbitrage.

I have always tried to buy growth at a value stock price -- close to book value
and the like. That has led me more often than not to busted technology stocks
(like XICO, my largest holding thanks to your last sentence), where there was
some sort of problem, with the trick being to determine whether or not the
problem was temporary. Still, I have tended to think I was buying a value stock
versus a growth stock. The idea that I was buying a value stock (which might or
might not be a growth stock) versus a momentum stock is interesting.

I personally think of it more in terms of buying high valuation versus low
valuation. For example, EBSC is clearly a low valuation stock, while MSFT is a
high valuation stock (like the "nifty-50" 30 years ago), but not necessarily a
momentum stock. For me, low valuation does not always mean a traditional value
stock. What I really look for in an investment is something that catches my eye
and leads me to give it my highest accolade "the stock is mispriced". An
example of a non-traditional favorite category of mine might be a company which
has had non-fatal problems and a depressed stock but has attracted new first
rate mgmt investing significant money in the company. (Nearly 50% of my current
holdings have that as one characteristic.)

we believed a couple of equity-income & stable growth funds would and will
serve our objectives. Maybe they are. And yet I am very unsatisfied. I have
three funds, all with good historical performance. This year they returned
7-10% according to the statements I rec'd this week. I haven't a clue what real
performance for other people's funds is - but I see returns like 20%, 40%, 100%
- fairly commonly among the choices within fund families.

I just can't tolerate 7% in this market. Getting what I asked for, but not what
I expected. And I just won't have it. I'm too jealous of other people's
performance. Sympathetic -but not supportive- of professional money managers
who have delivered me these 'poor' numbers in this, possibly the best bull

I agree with your statement, "identify great businesses and then be willing to
wait patiently with the bat on the shoulder until the pitch (price) gets so fat
(skinny) you just can't lay off."
However, it is very difficult in this market to not attempt to work momentum
investing into a value strategy.
I find it easier to use this strategy when I find an investment that is not
quite a value investment, but "a special value situation" because, as James
Clarke says, "the best value investments are ones that turn into "momentum
investments" for somebody else."
James Clarke - you asked for additional ideas to my Cort purchase. My key is
great management and a great niche product.
Here is another long term hold idea and one for you or others to analyze and
improve upon my research.
Recently, I began adding to my position in a small mystery company, wherein I
first bought a 2% position around $3.00 U.S. in 1998.
I love the management's cost controls, great nich product line, so when the
mystery company's stock price recently dropped to $7.50 per share (where it is
now but up from $3.00 in 1998), I made the decision to buy more as it declined.
I recently bought a 1% position at each of 71/2, 77/16, 76/16, 7 5/16, 71/4,
73/16, 71/8 and 71/16. Maybe this is easy for James Clarke to do, but it is
very tough for me (I was very happy to stop increasing my position at the 8%
additional portfolio level). I made the decision to go up to a maximum 20%
position, because I thought the downside might be as low as $6 U.S., if the
market declined in the U.S.
Now the requisite information.
In 1998, I met Rob Bakshi, an impressive, take no prisoners, cost conscious and
hard charging CEO of a tiny, illiquid Canadian company which wanted to design,
develop, and manufacture high technology closed circuit television monitering
and surveillance systems.
Bakshi, a cofounder of the company, had left his company shortly after its
founding, and returned in 1991, finally gaining full control around March 1996,
when annual revenue approximated 600,000C (all as part of a hostile takeover
and the removing of directors and the forcing out of senior management).
Bakshi has established a culture of innovation, intense focus on consumer
satisfaction and the UNRELENTING PURSUIT OF COST EFFICIENCIES. How has he done?
Revenues have increased from $600,000 Canadian in fiscal year (June) 1991, to
5.6C in 1995, 8.3C in 1996, 13.4C in 1997, 21.7C in 1998, 34C in 1999 and is on
its way to 45C in fiscal year ended June, 2000.
Earnings wise, the company has done even better and achieved break even by its
June 1996 fiscal year, then earned .21C in fiscal 97, .38C in 98, .65C in 99
and I anticipate they will exceed .80C in fiscal 2000 (June) and they are also
well positioned for the future.
The company is financially well managed:
-1- ROAE has approximated 40% + over the past three years;
-2- NO DEBT;
-3- Price to sales is less than one;
-4- PEG is less than .5;
-5- Revenue growth of 40-50% per annum;
-6- earnings per share growth of greater than 50% per annum;
-7- PE of 11.5 times my estimate of June 2000 earnings
-8-Bakshi has beat estimates every year since gaining control in 1996
(underpromise and overproduce).
The company has four publicly traded peers in the U.S. - Vicon Industries,
Loronix Information Systems, Ultrak and Sensormatic Electronics.
The company has the highest gross margins of its peers which translates into
high operating and net profit margins. Its high margins appear to occur because
it competes on product performance characteristics rather than price.
The company has smart management (my real key) which efficiently uses its
capital. They outsource virtually all of their production, undertaking only
final assembly and testing in house.
The company is increasing the amount spent on R&D from 3.3% of sales in 96 to
5.5% of sales in 99 and expects to spend 6% of sales on R&D in 2000.
Although a Canadian company, 75% of its sales are now to the U.S., with 12% to
Europe mostly France and Germany). The majority of its raw materials are
purchased outside of Canada, as such, the company faces exchange risk; however,
since most costs and revenues are based maily in the U.S., a natural hedge
occurs in most cases.
Another risk is an extremely short product life cycle; however, since Bakshi's
takeover in 1996, the company has won numerous awards for design and
manufacturing excellence. The company has developed leading edge products, but
has been somewhat lax in patenting its products. The company is correcting this
problem and indicates it is a process now well along.
The company has two main operating divisions.
Twenty percent of revenue (and declining dramatically in importance to the
company) comes from its mobile video division in transit surveillance systems.
Its growth business is the traditional security market, (eighty percent of
sales), which includes offices, hotels, casinos, prisons, industrial sites and
residences.
The company has a GREAT CEO (adding additional management for backup) and has
established a great NICHE by designing and manufacturing the world's toughest
and most innovative surveillance camera system, be they infrared, weatherproof,
or even bulletproof. Their cameras can be set to activate when they detect
motion. It then records at up to two frames per second in a digital format. No
VCR is required, although images may be recorded or viewed on a VCR when or if
desired. The maximum recording time exceeds ninety minutes, with images saved
even when a power outage occurs.
Its distributors include the likes of Brinks and ADT, while servicing
impressive clients like the Department of Defense and Lockheed Martin, amongst
others.
Over the past four years, the company has grown from 25 to approximately 125
employees.
The company's competitors are goliaths, but I believe the company's NICHE
products and great leadership, with its outstanding track record make this a
comfortable value like investment.
The name of the mystery company? Silent Witness. It was listed on the Toronto
Stock Exchange and only recently listed in the U.S. as SILW. It is very thin. I
always just insert a bid and it eventually gets hit. A cheap stock which I hope
will do even better than Cort, which luckily was too large a position in my
portfolio.
The real kicker with Silent Witness! SILW has decided to list on NASDAQ
national market and has stated that they will begin the procedure in the second
quarter of 2000. In their conservative manner, they expected to complete the
process in the normal time period, but they could not give any assurances on
how long it would take NASDAQ to complete their work. That additional
visibility should help bring this company's above average record and low pe to
the markets attention.
I can find no US brokers who follow this stock. However, the Red Chip Review, a
value line like publication on tiny companies has followed the company for
several years and gives the company its highest rating. The Red Chip Review
recently sold a portion of their equity to Cruttenden Roth, so I anticipate
that SILW will eventually make their way to one of Cruttenden Roth's investment
conferences.
I understand that SILW implemented a shareholders rights plan in December 1999
(at their annual meeting).
James Clarke, I would be interested, if after a review, you would concur that
this is a story that could become a "momentum investment" for somebody else.

"I am a bit concerned about your un-scepticism of the CEO, tho. Every CEO has
serious flaws; I wonder what his are?"

A very interesting and pertinent observation.
My venture capital friends tell me that a great entrepreneur can take a company
to the annual sales level of $50 million. Through the sheer force of will and a
dynamite personality, a true entrepreneur can and will sacrifice everything to
make his/her company (baby) a success. And that is what Bakshi has done for
SILW.
But at the level of $50 million in sales, a different skill set is needed. One
can't simple resolve a problem and, if necessary, simply do it himself. One
becomes spread to thin and therefore must delegate, if the company is to
continue its success in the future.
That is why venture capitalists often change horses in midstream, bringing in
new management to actually run the company and move the founding entrepreneur
to the honory position of chairman. They do this because it is necessary for
the success of the company and the venture capitalists have the power (through
the funding needs of the company or actual stock positions).
Obviously, with a hot IPO market, the founder opts for the public funding route
and public shareholders take the immediate risk of the entrepreneur being able
to be a successful manager of a large company. Yes, I know that the venture
capitalists today hire the management team for the public offering only a short
period before the IPO.
But that is today, in stock market boom times for IPOs. In more normal times,
the entrepreneur develops the company, then come the venture capitalists, then
management changes, if necessary, then the IPO.
Why the discourse, because SILW is today at the level of $50 million in sales,
and a strong, cost conscious and hard driving CEO has successfully driven the
company to this point. Can he take the company to the next level. The level
that venture capitalists say is the major hurdle. That is the question.
I believe the CEO has the ability to delegate successfully and build the
company. Will he be successful? I can only say that the CEO is adding staff
with good resumes. Will the CEO and the new additions meld into a strong
cohesive management team, or will they be in conflict which results in a

Paul,

Personal story. My return last year was ~2X%. However,
excluding 401(k) in a tech company stock and go-go
mutual (IGRYX), the return is about 14%. Good, bad?
Outran most of the value managers. ;-)

Personally I still own TAVFX who did ~13% last year.
From value funds, it looks like Weitz prospered
in the last couple of years. OAKLX did well, but they
as TAVFX were overweight in semi-equips that had
a great run. Now comes a question whether they know
when to sell and what to buy next.

Good luck

P.S. If any of you know why Yahoo gives two totally
different return numbers in their "performance"

Debra, a great presentation. I have three questions for you.

What would you estimate is the size of the overall market served by their
products and at what rate is it growing? The reason I ask is to have some idea
as to whether they may or may not be approaching a peak in market penetration.
Their larger US competitors may have a lock on most of their customer base and
unless their industry is growing at a healthy rate they might be approaching
some limit to their penetration.

Lastly, when reading your piece my first reaction was why hasn't this company
been bought by a larger competitor?

Deb, one more question on SILW.

Whom do you think is selling and why? Since the beginning of September every
single day in which the volume has exceeded 10,000 shares the low for that day
was lower than the day before (usually), or unchanged, except for 1 day
recently. I call that persistent distribution.

Interesting questions.

Hopefully interesting answers...
1.) Why hasn't the company been bought by a larger competitor?
Simply because the CEO, Bakshi, believes he can build a world class company.
In reality, Silent Witness (SILW), until very recently, has been an extremely
tiny company that wasn't on anyone's radar screen. If the company continues its
rapid growth, I believe that Bakshi would have a difficult time remaining
independent. However, my understanding is that his sole objective is remaining
independent and building value by dramatically growing the company.

2.) What is the estimate of the size of the overall market served by their
products and at what rate is it growing?
The closed circuit camera business is booming, and various studies show the
industry has doubled over the past four years.
The closed circuit television surveillance camera segment of the market (the
segment in which Silent Witness participates), is roughly estimated at
$500,000,000 U.S.
J.P. Freeman (an industry research group) has indicated that the closed circuit
television surveillance camera market should continue to grow rapidly over the
next five years. They believe the outlook is very strong because our underlying
economic, technological and social trends (crime, security etc.), remain very
positive for the industry.
My best guess is their industry is growing at the rate of 12% to 15% per annum.

3. How has Silent Witness performed?
Over the last four year (1996 to 1999), Silent Witness has increased its share
of the U.S. market from approximately 4% to approximately 9%.

Hope this is helpful.
Deb

Sorry, I don't have any information on the selling.
I tend to attempt to analyze a company and set my buy price, and act
accordingly, wherin a drop in the stock price allows me to buy my perceived
value. Historically this has worked for me.
My best guess is that several competitors which were rumored to be attempting
to produce a similar series of cameras, and when successful, the competitors
would undercut the prices of Silent Witness.
Eventually, the competitors will of coursebe successful, and therefore, I
assume that the profit margins of Silent Witness will decline by several
percentage points to match the competition. Silent's margins have been
increasing dramatically over the past few years, because of what I believe to
be their superior top of the line product.
I expect Silent to come forth with an updated product line when this occurs. I
noticed a press release of Silent Witness yesterday, about a superior cabling
solution, so the competition may have just or be about to release their
competitive product. Note that Silent won't release an updated product until
the competition shows its hand, so that the competition can't immediately and
cost effectively copy the Silent Witness product. That's what Silent has done
for the last several years.
Also, the company's second quarter ending January, 2000, is traditionally its
weakest quarter because of the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday period (sales
to schools etc.).
Or someone could know something that I don't know...

"Could someone tell me what would happen to a mutual value fund, such as

If the market corrects rapidly, this fund will get taken down right along with
RHAT and kin. Why? Because in a major correction, the fund houses must cross
fund lines just to maintain liquidity.
We all agree that once the dust settles, there will be a rotation into "value",
and the value funds will hold if not rise.

But if the market corrects slowly, value funds won't get washed with the rest
of the market, and you might benefit from rotation without the collateral
damage from the tech bubble.

Here's a question for the thread.
Does the speculative bubble break first - then rotation, or is it the other way
around?

Jeffrey,

You would have to ask someone other than me about oil & gas as it's unfamiliar
territory for me.

As I understood it, PETD uses investors to do the drilling, then keeps a
percentage (20%?) of the gas & oil revs from the wells. While they profit from
the drilling, I was attracted to the long term G&O revs.

What do you think improving prices does to PETD's drilling revenue?

"and perhaps with oil exposure."

You must accept that oil, like gold, is a political commodity. Once you're
willing to deal with that, ask yourself if you think $30 oil is sustainable.
It's not. It's going to stay above $30 for a while (if you want an explanation,
look at my stream of consciousness post on the "Oil economics" thread), but it
will come down from there, and your over-balanced oil play right along with it.

A balanced, or ng-weighted low cost E&P carries less risk.
EEE is trading at around a 50% discount (some say more) to it's NAV. As the
this thread title says, it's an obscene value play, and currently stranded at
port. A large cap in the same situation is GOU. GOU also has a preferred you
might want to look into.

Good Luck,

Blair Corp (BL) trading around 13-14 with about $19 of net current assets and
$24 of book value, profitable with a big dividend.

They announced a few days ago that they repurchased some stock. Not a lot, but
its a start. Then they announce the other day very quietly that they have
retained an investment banker. They announced this stuff so quietly that I
missed it. Some guy on Yahoo caught it, and it is confirmed in the company's
press releases.

I'm in at 13. Is something happening? I'll nibble a little more around $14

I must not have made my point clear on PETD. The majority of their revenue
apparently comes from conducting drilling programs, not from sales of energy
for their own account. Therefore, they do not materially benefit DIRECTLY from
an increase in energy prices. They might materially benefit indirectly, if the
price increase was perceived to be long lasting and resulted in increased
interest in their drilling programs. However, if long-lasting higher prices
were in store, why not own an energy company almost entirely exposed DIRECTLY
to those benefits?

As far as my comment of being interested in companies "with oil exposure" you
answered with the typical polemical trick of responding as if I had said
ENTIRELY oil exposure. In my opinion, some oil exposure is desirable and the
duration of the benefit can be extended by selling futures contracts against
future production. Even if "backwardization" reduces the benefits of hedging
over time, the benefits are usually still positive.

"by the way, speaking as a property owner..."

Are you familiar with a company called Timberline Software (TMBS)?

I happily sold my large Cort (CBZ) postion yesterday at $28 1/16, one-eigth of
a point over the Munger/Buffet offer, despite a counter offer from Brooks at
$29.25. I Believe Citigroup, with its 44% ownership of Cort, will opt for the
friendly Munger/Buffet offer.

Therefore I was looking for new ideas.

I remembered spending some time in the Northwest during IBM's recent takeover
of Sequent Computer. Made a nice profit because a weekly newspaper there
(Willamette Week), said Sequent was playing fast and loose with its financials,
and Sequent's stock tanked. The local paper was obviously wrong from my checks
(Wall Street was not on the local scene)... and I bought SQNT on the false
decline, and sold it shortly thereafter to IBM at a nice arbitrage profit.
While I was doing my due diligence on that transaction, I ran into a small
company (145 million market cap), with a management that is highly thought of
by its employees, and a neat looking product.
This morning I took a small position at 11 3/8 in this company, Timberline
Software (TMBS). It is a software company selling accounting and cost
estimating computer software for the construction and property management
industry.

The Company intrigues me because:
1.) great management;
2.) a neat and hopefully excellent niche product;
3.) NO DEBT;
4.) sales growth over 20%+ per year;
5.) earnings growth of 50%+ per year;
6.) price/sales less than 3 versus software industry price/sales @ 15
(excessive discount for their industry?);
7.) price/book 6/1 versus industry price/book of 15/1 and;
8.) p/e ratio of 15 versus software industry p/e of 50-60;
9.) Kayne Anderson Investment Management, who I think highly of, are the
company's largest instituional investor (as of 9/30/99).

Curtis Peltz, president and ceo of TMBS appears to do an excellent job and is
very well liked by the employees. Employee turnover (in an area where Intel,
Informix and other software companies are located), is quite low, especially
for the software industry.
My plan is to dramatically increase my position in this out of favor company,
if and when the stock price continues to decline. My full position will be
accomplished when interest rates peak, and/or interest rates start to decline.
I will probably follow the bank index and/or the major banks to time the taking
of my full position.
This is a long term investment hold in a quality company, but a small company,
with excellent management and a software product that looks attractive on
initial analysis.
P.S. - Kicker is that their largest holder is smart and active, not passive, in
improving the value of their portfolio investments.
Also a possible internet play? I wish, but in November TMBS did announce a
partnership that will allow customers to post project information onto
buzzsaw.com's web site.
If anyone has used their products or is familiar with this company's products,
please post or private message me.

Deb, on TMBS, I suspect the valuations in the industry served and the only 6%

"I suspect (TMBS)the valuations in the industry served and the only 6% growth
in software sales in the latest quarter contribute to the valuation and the
downtrend. Also do not like seeing the insider sales at $17, although not a big
deal."

All points that I think contribute to the OPPORTUNITY here.

1.)Valuations in an out of favor industry. - When interest rates peak and turn
down this company will be well positioned to participate with out of favor
banks and real estate companies.
However, TMBS is a REALLY a SOFTWARE COMPANY (with a P/E of less than one
quarter of that industry's P/E). It competes for employees with high tech
software companies, not construction employees. Very successfully too, because
sales and earnings are growing at 20%+ and 50%+ per annum, respectively.

2.) Only 6% growth in software sales. - From the TMBS recent October 13, 1999
press release..."Revenue for the (third) quarter ended September 30, 1999 was
$13,350,000 an increase of 21% over $11,078,000 for the same quarter a year
ago. Net income rose 43% to $2,465,000...compared to net income of
$1,726,000...for the third quarter of 1998."
Quarterly sales increases of 6%+ (compunded)per quarter (and even faster for
earnings per share), doesn't seem like a negative to me. Few companies with a
P/E of 15 or less have a track record with this type of performance.

3.) insider sales at $17.00 - Good point. But a more detailed analysis shows
the majority of these sales were from Thomas P. Cox, executive vice-president
and age 65. Who, in the last proxy filing in 1999, indicated that he was
retiring from the company. A valid reason in my book to sell shares.
Salaries are also very reasonable for a software company, with the top senior
management receiving approximately $150,000 per year in total compensation
(salary and bonus). Compare these compensation levels, and very reasonable (not
large) stock options packages to key employees, with the mind boggling
compensation packages of many other technology companies on the west coast.
This is my kind of management team, because they look out for BOTH shareholders
and employees.

I believe for these reasons and others, the company is misunderstood and
therefore creates an outstanding investment opportunity.
If you disagree, or I am missing something, please advise.

On TMBS, this is the sentence from that release that I did not like:

" Software sales grew 6% to $6,749,000 in the
third quarter of 1999 from $6,360,000 in 1998."

I also believe that the Street (and I) give more weight to progress on sales of
products than service revenue. While service revenue can actually be more
important, because it can have higher margins, the sales give a good measure of
how dynamic their product array is. As an example, how would you feel if
service revenues were up even more and
software sales were actually down - in my opinion, the stock would get killed.

I am not intending to say the company is no good, but perhaps it is not
materially undervalued. Have you asked the company about the outlook for
software sales growth?
