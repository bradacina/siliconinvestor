Hi Paul -

I have not done a thorough search in this site but my preliminary searching
shows a host of small cap pink sheet companies come up in their search screen
results.

I really believe when companies are small (say less than $50M in Market Cap),
they are outside the scope of the average (institutional) investor. This
presents a lot of inefficiencies in the market.

If you discover anything interesting w/ a lot of hidden assets, please post.

Have fun turning over those rocks and hopefully you will discover a nugget or
two.

Perhaps the seasonality is based on when they are able to drill (due to
weather, due to constraints of the environment, due to rules).

If you drill in spring, the drilling results probably don't start coming in
until august and a lot of the smaller miner's market caps will jump (up or
down) based on results.

I know that in the muskeg in CAN, they don't allow and perhaps cannot drilling
for oil when it thaws - they must go in to drill when it's frozen - so there is
a season.

rllee,

re: technicals: I'm reading Jack Schwager's book "Market Wizards" right now -
just finished the chapter with his interview w/ famous trader Richard Dennis of
the "turtle traders." One significant takeaway from his interview was that he
said most of his systems don't necessarily work in the stock markets, but do
better with many other markets, esp. commodities. They talked about why that
would be - and Dennis said in his studies of the stock markets he finds that
the basic nature of price movements in the stock market tend to be different -
more random, and non-trending in most cases. When pressed Dennis attributed it
to lack of information flow - or lack of meaningful new information in most
stock price movement. He feels other tradable markets lend themselves more to
trending because of a generally richer information flow.

anyhow - I keep coming back to that statement - and we really do only get
quarterly checkup w/ our companies in most cases, and beyond chit/chat press
releases not much meaningful tends to happen in a quarter - makes me wonder if
that's why most stock investors tend have long holding times - that the trends
present in stocks have to play out over periods of multiple years - that
meaningful datapoints and feedback loops occur much more slowly in most cases.

Big in Japan <g>:

Sold Sakura Japan 5189.T @180Y (flat). Reason: lousy forecast
Bought: Nissan Chemical 4021.T @693Y. Interesting chemical company - products:
Semiconductor material, Agrochechmicals, with above average profitability,
shareholder friendly (30% of the earnings dividend payout ratio, plus
additional stock buybacks). PE is around 10x and their forecast (5/13/11) looks
OK. This is a starter position.

A decent presentation is given here:

Bought Nippon Seisen 6569.T@392Y: High tech (imo) stainless steel and metal
fabrication company) PE ~6.5. I was impressed with their capabilities after
looking at the products on their website, coming from a material science
background. Their financial performance over the years has been good too, they
never lost money, even in the recession. Products seems to be special alloys
for springs, shape memory alloys and specifically they are able to produce SS
wires with a Diameter of 1.2um. one application of this wire material is to
make Semiconductor gas filters. For this year they forecast 59Y/share (almost
flat), which is not too bad given the recession and their industry. Their
balance sheet is in great shape too, with net cash of ~0.5 their market cap

AGII - I rode it once from below 30$ into the the high 30's, so I hope to do
this again. As for the chart and 2005/2007, that is somewhat misleading because
in 2007 Argonaut merged with PXRE and the chart is that PXRE. Right or wrong, I
looked into that matter and decided that i would not blame them for what
happened with PXRE before the merger. At least that is how I recall from memory
when I first looked at the stock a year ago.

I think they underearn for their capital base but they don't blow themselves up
with undue risk. They buy back stock mostly when it's cheap. Good enough for a
decent but not an overweight position.

As for BAC, the problems are well publicized. My bet is that the mortgage
putbacks peter out soon, since it appears that Y2007 vintage has peaked
(Y2005&Y2006 putbacks are already shrinking) and Y2008 the mortgage market was
already in full retreat and won't be as bad as Y2005-Y2007. Even in the new
framework there is 2-2.5$/share earnings power. The new CEO still has to prove
itself, but should be better than Ken Lewis. I hope to ride it up to 15$, when

>>i wonder how long they will manage to keep it above the offering price.<<

Looks like the high of the day was 28.75$, the magic number for the treasury to
break even. So, the answer to your question is 0sec.

AIG is interesting imo, trading at a little more than 50% tangible book, so
there is a decent buffer. There are issues with the reserves for the property
insurance parts plus ongoing legacy issues that probably fade away over time.
You would thing however, that management has a strong incentive to start out
with clean books, they don't really have any incentive to hide losses.
Government may have an incentive to hide losses and float the turkey again, now
that it's not systemically important any more but I think Benmosche is a strong
enough personality to resist pressure.

With so many other cheap insurance companies out there, I'll take a pass for

I dont know the guy is battling cancer, and like so many things the valuations
of assets and future claims is in the eye of the beholder. Someone on another
issue made the point that frequently loss reserves are based on historical
experience which could be vastly different from the future- I kind of doubt
that P&C companies have adequately reserved for 2011 one in a 100 or 500 year
events, and it seems like we are having one in a 100year events annually now.
Now when an entity is more than adequately capitalized like a berkshire
hathaway one can be off with these reserve calculations, but when the leverage
is high this could spell doom and or future bailouts for other entities and my
confidence in regulatory authorities has been completely shaken after the
events of the past 5 years. The only thing I am confident about is governments

Started a tracking position in Algonquin Pwr (AQUNF). This is not really a deep
value play but I do like their assets. According to YAHOO the company is
selling at 60% of BV. They own regulated NG and Water utility franchises in
Canada and the US. Therefore, there are some barriers to entry into their
business. Operating in a regulated environment, they are allowed a "fair" rate
of return on their capital which translates into future price increases (2012
price increases submitted to regulators in three of their U.S. markets).

I am not too sure how much value you place in their regulated franchises but I
believe actual BV understates it's true value.

This is a Growth of Revenue play (GARP) as I expect revenues will double in
2012 as a result of recent acquisitions. Eventually I expect their PE to fall
to 15 (w/ increasing revenues & submitted 2012 price increases to regulators)
from a trailing PE value of 25 (Forward PE for 2011 is 19 & I expect 2012 to be
near 15). (Note: Stock up 4% since their announcement to Buy ATO NG assets.
Also AQUNF is thinly traded so do not chase.).

The company continues to Buy these types of assets in the U.S. which I feel
they are getting at a good price (especially when they are using their high
valued Canadian dollars).

My Buys were done in the IRA so dividends are exempt from any Foreign
withholding Tax (US/Canadian treaty). I sold 40% of my ATO (bought 3/2010 @
$28.59) to finance the purchase. My buy was triggered by Algonquin buying Atmos
gas (ATO) distribution assets for $124 mln announced 5/13/2011. I originally
bought ATO because of these assets so I am just following the revenue
generating assets.

Hi Grommit -

These are the land mines one likes to avoid. I bought my initial lots in 3/2010
at $18.03. I owned a pretty good chunk as they paid a higher than average
dividend and owned a profitable NG distribution franchise that included a lot
of NG pipe line assets. Schwab did not participate in their company sponsored
dividend reinvestment program and the stock was up almost 20% from my initial
buy, I sold everything but a stub in March 2011.

This was an extended dividend payer as their yield was much higher than the
industry norm (over 7% when I bought) and consistently had a payout ratio in
the high 95% range. Any problem in their service area (ie like a tornado) would
cripple their cash flow. I never thought a one storm event would affect the
stock so much.

The positive is most of their NG assets are under ground and not impacted too
much other than some of the above ground meters. I bet the insurers and
re-insurers are impacted from all of the natural disasters this year (earth
quakes, tornadoes & floods).

I do not see this as a possible buying opportunity unless the stock trades down
to its 2009 levels (ie $14-$16 price range). Looking forward, the long term
interest rate environment is going to be higher which is typically not too good
for capital intensive businesses like utilities.

Hi Paul -

I see the real wild card in valuing these transactions in their estimate for
calculating the flowing BOPD from the new wells that are drilled on the raw
land in inventory. Their calculation assumes a cost of $3,000,000 NPV/well but
they mention no minimum production amount of BOPD from the new well to arrive
at this price.

Is this number the average cost to drill a new well? Or a back of the envelope
average $NPV/well figure based on experience. Wouldn't this number change
significantly based on the area of the new well (and past BOPD from drilled
wells on contiguous sites), current drilling costs for the region (some wells
cost 2x more because of site issues) and nothing I see takes into account for
dry holes or non economic flow rates.

Finally, one must be careful with generalizing BOPD rates from new wells and
amounts booked from producing fields (especially into the future). BODP rates
diminish significantly over the first 16 months of production and also over the
life of the entire field. Rates are different for "oily" wells and for NG wells
too.

Therefore, I would look at the valuation in two separate parts. Use their
average purchase/sale price for oil weighted production as $/BOPD average
figure ( in Q4 2009 was $100,000 per flowing barrel) and then add the raw land
$ amount based on the average $/acre (based on last sales in the geographical
region). This might be a more conservative approach to arrive at a minimum
"fair value".

If one gets to aggressive with their valuation based on "expected flowing BOPD"
there are too many factors that could impact the actual production of those
BOPDs like dry holes and disappointing production flows.

Re: Empire District Electric Co. (EDE)

Followed your lead and closed out my remaining stub position in the company.
It's at most dead money for the next 6 months and who knows if the dividend cut
will be extended and/or if there are any other unexpected costs to the utility
from the tornadoes(s).

I put the proceeds into GMXRp which has sold off in the last few days. It now
yields 10% based on the discount to Par (Par @ 25 yields 9.25% w/ stock selling
around $23.00/share). The reason for the recent fall, is the company is selling
more shares to raise the needed cash to finance their 2012 drilling program.
Rumor on the street is their price floor is $22.50/share (reflects a 10.28%
yield).

When the company completes their sales, I expect the stock to inch it's way
higher back to Par ($25.00/share). The stock was selling right at Par before
they started their recent sales. This reflects a potential 8.7% capital gain.
Therefore the total potential return is 18.7%.

Thank's for the heads up as w/o your lead, I probably would have done nothing.
I booked a $1.00/shares gain on my stub and locked in a potential 18.7% gain on
the proceeds.

ENH - they did grow book value per share at 12%, but the book itself only grew
at 8%. Repurchases at discount are good, but you have to look at core growth
too.

I am not saying ENH is bad.

Right now there's tons of insurers all claiming great growth, conservative
underwriting, shareholder value, strategic vision and special business acumen.
I must say I doubt at least some of these claims. It's obvious that even with
"conservative underwriting" a lot of them are suffering losses this year -
including BRK. As Buffett says, in coming year when tide goes out we may see
who was swimming naked. ;) (Note that Buffett sidestepped the question of which
insurance company is the best apart from BRK...)

So you kinda have to make your picks or just buy a basket and see how it goes.

positions in STO and LDRXF as these stocks dropped.

In telecom space, I bought some AMX and sold PTNR on disappointing results. I
am still trying to figure out this space and possibly not doing very well. :)

In miscellaneous, I added to BBD, UVIC, UFPT positions as prices dropped.

I sold VSEC on an announcement of them buying a big company.
I sold tiny DCIX position I received as a spinoff from DSX.
I sold PSDMF on Asian rumor runup.

I bought more ARO and then sold part of position on disappointing earnings. I
may sell the rest too.

I bought some CSR which is a Chinese company in the process of management
buyout. The belief in buyout is shaky so the arbitrage margin is big. It is
risky though. I sold part of my position as stock ran up and rebought as it
dropped again.

re Insurers - i don't have strong preferences - I am pretty much buying a

I also pretty much have the same criteria as you:
- Past track record: book value growth, book value per share growth, not many
funny transactions. Unfortunately you can't discard insurance company due to
lumpy results and losses in some years.
- Management. Unfortunately, BRK and Fairfax are the only two companies where I
know about the management long term.
- Credit rating and AM Best rating. Definitely.
- Investment portfolio. Again, only with BRK we know what it is. Also somewhat
with Fairfax. With L we know a bit, but the structure is a bit complex since
it's a holding company. For the rest you can only see some distributions and
glimpses like AFL's Greek writedowns and some MBSes in a number of companies I
looked recently. But even there it's tough to say whether they bought MBSes pre
crash or post crash unless you spend detective time going through 2007-2010
annuals.

Finally, on the valuation side, it's pretty much P/book. P/E is pretty much
useless as seen by looking of reinsurer 2010 P/Es and this year's losses. It
might be possible to use 5 year earnings for P/E, though I am not sure this
would work well. ROE and ROIC are also not indicative of performance
unfortunately. Maybe I should read "Security Analysis" on how Graham suggested
valuing Financials/Insurers.

If someone else has other measures for valuing insurers, please chime in. :)

I have taken a very small position in ASTC. I think Paul calls this a "tracking
position.". You mention a large amount of cash (relative to market cap), which
is good for liquidity. However, they have about the same amount of debt. Also
their book value is mostly property plant and equipment which I suspect has
little value in a stress sale position. So bottom line I do not see this as a
strong Graham type of investment. But I have not studied it, and may be wrong
about the property plant and equipment.

What intrigues me is the potential for them to report large earnings relative
to share price. Also since they have a humongous "accumulated earnings," it
should mean they pay no taxes even if they start earning money.

I saw on the Yahoo board some comment about the company being run by finance
guys and not engineers. I consider that a very good thing.

At any rate my impression now is that this is a trading investment. I see this
as the sort of company that makes money, loses money, makes money, loses money,
and eventually goes out of business, never having paid a dividend, sort of like
an airline. The large accumulated deficit supports this view.

At any rate, it seems a good chance to double, and if it does one can always
sell half and never worry about a loss on the investment after that.

How will they replace the energy they get from the Nuclear Plants??? I cannot

source of abundant electric energy. As with all unwise decisions this too will
come to pass, but may keep the prices depressed for a long long time. It cannot
be replaced with solar or wind. So natural gas or coal or both. The pollution
will be a lot more than nuclear. Similar to the decision to make energy from

>>How will they replace the energy they get from the Nuclear Plants??? I cannot

I can - in fact I expected this, based on the sentiment in the German news.
Wether this decision makes sense or not from our perspective is irrelevant imo-
all that matters for the investment decision is the financial impact for the
operators RWE.DE and EON.DE

Based on what I am hearing from Japanese sources, I would not bet on the LT
future of nuclear energy in Japan either. Currently they cannot really afford
to shut down nuclear power plants (one plant has been shut down nevertheless by
the government) but once the current supply constraints are resolved, I expect
that the nuclear energy in Japan will be slowly phased out too. I believe that
nuclear energy will be having a hard time in most democracies. China will
soldier on, but Korea (which has a large build program too) may have political
issues too to execute their program.

What I take home from this is that I would not want to own nuclear energy
related stocks until they are dirt cheap. I own some (Toa Valve) in japan that
just revised their earnings down by ~30% due to cancelled/on hold project and
they trade at 7x FWD earnings will almost all the market cap in net
cash.Nevertheless the stock has been very weak, as well as his Peer Okano Valve
(5x FWD earnings).

Well, that is what I am talking about, when i talk about cheap nuclear power
related stocks, most stuff besides Japan still seems to be very overpriced,
given the new realities.

These are the ones I have already listened too but there are quite a few other

It looks like BG is getting out of the fertilizer business and expanding their
milling facilities. They acquired 4 new milling facilities in Brazil , opened
up a new plant in China (new factory w/ two productions lines) and completed a
new facility in Vietnam. The company touches a lot of the food production &
distribution channels w/ the goal to earn a small piece on every value added
piece they handle.

They are bringing a lot of efficiencies into the global market(s). The CEO said
their market sweet spot is the average earner that nets $20.00/day
($7,240/year) . This group will be the consumers of the food products they
bring to market.

Hi Paul -

My E&P Basket has 18 positions and it is up 4% (based on my cost vs Friday's
market close). I have booked another 1.5% gain on sales and other option
income. The gain is mainly from selling 50% of my MHR which was called away in
May @ $5.00/share.

Use the WCAT index to compare your results. My E&P basket tracks this index
pretty closely. I will try to post my holdings and their % of the basket when I
finish updating my spreadsheet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jefferies TR/J CRB Wildcatters Exp&Pr Eq (WCAT) - The INDEX is designed to
track the overall performance of a universe of listed U.S. and Canadian small
and mid-capitalization companies engaged in the exploration and production of
oil and natural gas.

WCAT is a pretty good INDEX to look at for how the small cap E&P stocks have
performed. When you compare to the S&P 500 YTD it shows the wild correction
that the E&P small cap companies have had. Now look at the 1 year gains (still
very positive for the year).

I still believe there is a lot of value in these names. As long as crude stays
above $80.00/barrel, they all make money (on both old and new wells). The wild
card (at least in my picks) is how successful they are in their new wells
scheduled for completion in 2011-2012.

As you can see from the 1 year chart of the WCAT index, another 10% correction
could be on the table. This could provide another buying opportunity for more
of the quality names.

Yep, I need to learn sentiment and patience from you. In the mean time Germany
will keep importing nuclear energy from from France and if Germany keeps
growing its economy by 3% per year will have about 20-30% more need for energy
by 2022. If they are ready to pollute they can make it. But you are absolutely
right that uranium stocks will get beaten in the near future. I wish I listened
to you, but I bought Cameco and I am going to keep it because I am quite under
water. There must be a very strong will from the world to replace nuclear
energy, the way Brazil did with oil. The rest of the world still uses oil.
As for Japan, I think there should not be any nuclear plants there. I cannot
understand where is the logic to close your plants if your neighbor country has
many of them and will build more and in many countries in Europe there are
plans to build more nuclear plants.

re Gogo - I believe that the Electricity consumption in Germany has peaked and

shrink) and part of it will be energy savings, which for sure will be part of
the package.

I also believe that carbon sequestering technology will be developed in Germany
(pilot projects have been underway for a few years) , which is important,
because Germany uses lot's of coal and lignite for power generation. I regret
the decision to shed nuclear I have to accept facts as they are not the way we
want it. By the way, France has opposition to nuclear energy too, it's just not
as strong as in Germany, at least not yet.

SYEV - I took a look at the new 10K.

Great sales, earnings growth, great ROE.

The company is really obnoxious in self promotion. I hate the microcaps that
throw around nebulous promises of 100 years of expertise while quoting $400
billion world water market and 6000 people dying in Africa every day from water
borne diseases.

Bottles manufactured in China by subcontractor, filters in US by SYEV.
"Seychelle’s filters include powdered water-activated coconut"... seriously?

"As of February 28, 2011, we had a President and two (2) executive employees
managing the Company with two (2) administrative employees supporting that
effort. In assembly, operations and warehousing we had twelve (12) full-time
employees and four (4) independent contractors working to fill orders. " - so
they hired 12 new employees more than doubling their workforce in a year!

They did not spend anything on R&D. Their CEO who draws no salary does R&D in
his spare time. o.0

3 customers 20% sales each = 60% of sales to 3 customers. A bit risky.

They recorded 700K of deferred tax assets. Therefore their OCF is only $1.2M
compared to earnings of $1.7M. This is not particularly good.

6.5M warrants were forfeited (???) but 8.4M were granted... Their accounting
for warrants is a bit fuzzy IMHO.

They dismissed their previous accountants in June 2010 and hired new ones for
half cheaper fee. They also had to change accountants in 2009 when their
previous accountant Moore&Co were disciplined by regulators.

Their president/CEO/chairman works for free. Their executive VP (??) and
COO/CFO work for 50K salary a year (previously they worked for free too). Not
sure if this is a plus or a minus... Do I really believe that great inventors
and managers work for 8-man company for free for 6 years?

Every time I start longing to buy SYEV, I reread this and I lose my appetite:

Hi Jurgis -

I am still watching SYEV from the side lines. When I talked to the company last
month there were a few items that caught my attention:

(1) They had no plan for a warehouse/distributor for Australia and/or Europe.
Every order was fulfilled from their CA warehouse and shipped individually
(expensive). They were getting a lot of orders from Australia/New Zealand but
no plan for any ramp up.

(2) The had huge WEB site order growth but no way to process international
orders through their foreign distributors.

(3) Their CEO handles all the one time "emergency relief" orders through U.S.
Gov agencies (including military). These are huge dollar orders and I would
expect a full time position be established to service this very profitable
segment.

I am expecting a shortfall in sales growth until several of these logistic and
sales channels can be fixed. The business is also a one product company even
though they have different types of filters and bottles. Maybe they could also
look at other "emergency relief" products that might complement their current
line which they can bundle in a kit (ie plastic tarp. vacuumed pack food bars
etc). At the very least cross promote their product(s) with other companies
that are already in that business (ie. green promoters, emergency relief,
promotional give-away). They currently do nothing that taps the potential in
these other markets including no inserts in their shipping package and/or cross
promotion on their Web site.

Therefore, the company is a work in progress with lots of potential but may
very well stumble w/ future sales growth by not capitalizing on their current
sales growth momentum.

Re: CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR)

NYSE stocks posting largest volume increases - May 31, 2011
Top 10 New York Stock Exchange-traded stocks posting largest volume increases

CoreSite Realty Corp. : Approximately 2,151,400 shares changed hands, a 1,438.0
percent increase over its 65-day average volume. The shares rose $.75 or 4.4
percent to $17.70.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not sure what the reason was for the huge volume Tuesday ( maybe end of month
buying), but it was 6.5X avg daily volume.

No position at this time but watching the nice recent price action.

IPCC: Non-standard auto insurer. Decided I'll take a few tracking shares to
start as stock falls a little on today's down day. (Dow -150 now)

Company has been profitable in each of the past ten years. Stated book value
generally rising; has doubled in ten years. Trades now (~$52) a little below
stated bv (~$54)and above tangible (~$47) (SI numbers)

I see the business as being intact in its niche, but a very slow grower.
Similar then my expectation for the stock. Which is okay by me for a
conservative holding within a diversified conservative portfolio.

COR. My guess is that some mutual fund decided to buy some shares. A temporary
(and minor) assist to the price. No complaints here. I bought my shares May 2 -

Hi Paul -

Your TOT made this list. I own two of the six (INTC & MSFT). They are all
better bargains after today's 279 point (-2.2%) drop.

I dont know who writes this stuff but its pretty flimsy. if a respectable
auditing firm doing its due dilligence should catch most problems, and that is
what investors need to be relying on. if we lose confidence in auditors then no
one will invest in anything. The problems with deloitte not being able to
confirm bank balances correctly and not picking up on loans, speaks poorly of
all cpa firms. at the very least you should be able to confidently comfirm
cash. Fact is GFRE subsequent to its reverse merger had registered sale of
securities to institutional investors and sold several million shares at $8.50
I believe. Theoretically they have over $2 in cash on their balance sheet and
the auditors havent resigned yet anyway. that hasnt stopped numerous
allegations of fraud and questionable accounting from being posted about them.
Would it surprise me if it turned out to be a fraud? I cant say it would
anymore, especially after the latest chinese fraud du jour.

I dont know who Bill Bishop if but if he says only invest in things you can
research yourself it pretty much limits yourself to local domestic exposure. I
guess i will take my chances.

That's my approach to most China stocks now; once their growth story comes out
from under its current slowdown cloud, I might go for some large caps there
again. But I wouldn't touch anything selling into their local market with a
short operating history as a public company. Not worth the risk when I can look
for similar companies in countries with better audit records.

INTC: Fill for me on a few tracking shares of Intel. I shoulda followed several
of the guys who were buying it here at lower prices. At $22 now, I'm a little
late. (Or maybe in this market I might be a little early -g-). For some reason
it's only now that I find the metrics (relatively low p/e of 10, and okay roe}
to be attractive for at least a few shares.

Very hard to argue with this list of 6 value plays. I would throw in GLW and
CSCO to this list for a list of 8, but I like his reasoning on these.

I own MSFT and TOT already, I'm trying to find a stock to sell to buy some HPQ.
I like his reasoning on RIMM, though I will have to think about that one given
that I love my Android phone. I own a different Solar stock, but I think all of
them are worth a look these days. I would normally call them
speculative/growth, but at p/e's of 3 & 4, I see why they're looked at as value
plays.

Thanks,

The 20% drop of student enrollment in Strayer definitely warrants
investigation. I can somehow understand the big drop of enrollment in
Corinthian or Apollo, since these two have to change their marketing practice
and drop certain student candidates to comply with the new rules. But based on
what I read from Strayer's annual report, its business model should not be
impacted too much.

This becomes a much bigger deal now. When Strayer was beaten down around $120 I
believed there was enough of a margin of safety in the price to absorb some bad
enrollment news. Now that it looks like the regulatory cloud has lifted, and
assuming these stocks are going to revert to something approaching their
previous highs, the questions (for most of these companies, not just Strayer)
become a lot tougher.

Hi Paul -

Re: Voyager Oil & Gas, Inc. (VOG)

I added to my VOG this AM. I am betting that their Williston Basin Bakken
property will eventually pay off. Stock at the lowest level since my initial
buy.

My top 10 E&P positions (by market price) are now as follows:

SSN
VOG
PVA
GMXR
RAM
LEI
MHR
GST
USEG
DBLE

AXAS is one of my tracking positions I plan to add to if the price moves 10%
lower from current levels.

Here's an example where mechanical magic formula investing beats the
post-selection of magic formula stocks. I'm pretty sure most "post-selectors"
of magic formula screen decided that for-profit-ed stocks are too risky and
avoided / underweighed them. And now "post-selectors" are probably hugely
underperforming the mechanical screen... :/

Disclosure: I am one of the "post-selectors" who never bought for-profit-ed and
I am probably underperforming magic formula mechanical screen this year.

Hi EKS. re. VOG: I'll add a few shares here as well. VOG's a speculative
position for me, because I don't know how to pin down a number for the
company's value, only that it's been an early mover in acquiring
Bakken/Niobrara land holdings. And so it's part of a basket of these stocks
that I've wanted to acquire.

Perhaps a mistake, I keep adding to my shares at ever lower prices. My avg cost
basis before today's small buy is $4.51, so I have a looong way to show gains,
if ever.
