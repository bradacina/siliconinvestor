AAPL is not a hardware company any more. They are an ecosystem company where
each product synergistically supports other products. that way they gain a
bigger percentage of their customers wallet.

My feel is that at some point they will sever ties with the telecom service
providers at least in the US and just rent the networks or several of them to
provide a seamless user experience. The customer at this point will not care if
they run non Verizons or ATT's network, it will be just an Apple device that
does stuff that the customer wants.

I don't own the stock and think there is quite a bit of execution risk but
there is significant upside too. Now for AAPL to appreciate 20%, people need to
put 100B$ in the market. That is an enormous number and will limit AAPL's
upside, unless they make it worthwhile to hold the stock with a fat dividend.

WILC,

I am still holding a fair-sized position here. At first glance, the
announcement of the end of the share buyback was disappointing. On the other
hand, they made pretty good progress on it in a short time period, having
bought back $2.9 million of the $5.0 million authorization. Also, it looks like
their related entity will be buying shares now in the market, so that will
support the stock.

Finally, taking a contrarian point of view, I see that a couple of large
institutional shareholders have sold out, with very few of them left. This
makes me think that there will no longer be a big supply of stock to sell in
the market. Good from a supply/demand of shares point of view.

All that being said, it seems like the company's results will be mediocre for
the indefinite future, while at the same time there will be currency and
political risk (Israel bombing Iran?) that I am not eager to take right now,
making it a long-term value play that definitely could get cheaper.

It really depends on you. Don't trust the experts. For some people 1 position
works wonderfully, for some 10, for some 250. And if the 1 position person
tried to hold 250, they would fail miserably. If 250 position person tried to
hold 10 positions, they'd fail miserably too. And both of them could outperform
market by holding their "comfortable" number of positions.

It also may depend on your experience and on particular set of market
circumstances. You might be holding 100 positions, then spot an incredible deal
in your circle of competence and then bam you have >50% in a single position.
Very few people can do that and execute that well though. ;)

Agree w/Jurgis Bekepuris. It depends on one's risk profile, one's goals, one's
patience level.

For you --- given I know nothing about you except that you seem to be
struggling with the issue -- I'll assume you're a young guy just starting out,
whose eyes light up with the idea of getting results of the "greats" (Burry??)
-
So my guess is 3-10 positions for you. My reference is pp 242-243 of <u>One Up
on Wall Street</u>: "In small portfolios I'd be comfortable owning between
three and ten stocks." (P. Lynch)

My opinions:

1. Being comfortable is overrated if you want to make big bucks. Overrated in
general.

2. Regarding Lynch, the other "greats": There's the element of survivor bias.
You don't hear much of the people who kept a few stocks who weren't successful.

3. "He (Klarman)'s only had a 10% position 10 times in the last 20 years."
Could this also mean he started with a "3-6%" position and as the position
doubled or tripled or more in value, even after selling some shares, the
position had just grown to be a 10% position. That would be a "let your winners
ride and cut your losers" aspect, which I would view as a tactic within the
framework of how many different stocks should I optimally hold in my portfolio.

4. For me, I like to believe (although perhaps just fooling myself) that I
control risk by position size. Starting positions, tracking positions, low
conviction/cigar butt positions, seemingly high-risk stocks--- their position
sizes in my portfolio are smaller than other stocks there...... Uh... have I
confused what's being meant by "ideal position size within a portfolio"? My
point now seems be there's no one ideal for "position size". That could be
different from "ideal number" of stocks. For that too, it depends on the
individual imo, as I was referring to in first two paragraphs.

Good advice. :)

"3-10 positions" is also IMHO a good advice when you want to show someone what
investing is about and how it works (or doesn't). I.e. your kids, relatives,
friends, enemies... ;)

1 position is too much a dice roll. It either succeeds and then the person
thinks that it's very easy or it fails and the person thinks that investing is
rigged/foolish/does not work, etc.

>10 positions and they are lost in too many companies, news, price swings, etc.
Too overwhelming, boring, etc.

3-7 (OK, I'd say 7, not 10 ;)) - prices fluctuate. Some go up, some come down.
It's potentially interesting and not overwhelming. Smart people start learning
from there. Not so smart ones provide you with the humor value in their

Portfolio positions: I'm re-reading now pages 27ff of Spooner's <u>Do you Want
to Make Money or Would You Rather Fool Around?</u>

http://www.amazon.com/Want-Money-Would-Rather-Around/dp/1580625274

It's about a one "Your 'Stake in Life' stock". It's about how Spooner (a
stockbroker/author) repeatedly hears variations of this story: "I inherited all
this Coca Cola stock from my grandfather, and I took it to (financial people )
and they told me I had too much Coca Cola, that I was too concentrated, and
that I had to diversify". "Too risky to have all eggs in one basket." "Spread
the proceeds over a variety of investments." To which Spooner replies "I say
this is bad advice."

This is one of the few writings I've seen where the author it seems to me,
argues for a VERY concentrated portfolio. One major stockholding.

Spooner in his younger days, talking with a "financial counselor" who advises
Spooner to sell down his (Spooner's) large stake in American Express -- because
it was the largest part of his assets, says no, he's sticking with all of his
AMEX and might be adding more on dips. Because Spooner believed "...If you
don't own your own business, you have to own enough stock in a public company
to set you free when, and if, the stock moves up substantially in price. "

His idea: "...to structure the ideal financial life you should identify, as
early in working life as possible, one or two companies that you believe in for
the future. They should share certain characteristics":
Universal global appeal
Instant name brand recognition
Products or services you "dispassionately believe" will continue to be in
demand "for years"

---
I mention this because although I'm a believer in diversification, and I'm a
VERY big diversifier, gee, I look back at some stocks that seem to meet
Spooner's criteria and that I could've bought them 30, 40 or more years ago,
and if I just held on, I would've done really satisfactorily at this point in
my life. Better than really good if I had reinvested dividends and/or bought
dips.

Perhaps it's 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years too late for me -- time is not my
friend now -- I am starting a small tracking position this week in
Church&Dwight (CHD). Not a value stock at current p/e. I suspect it could be a
stock I might hold though for the remainder of my years. Terrific chart here:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=CHD+Basic+Chart&t=my

CHD's products:
http://www.churchdwight.com/

I suspect if I were younger now, and somebody I respected kicked my butt and
said, just buy a few shares and put 'em away, you dummy... I might be very
happy in 2022 or 2032 that I listened and did.

Of course, all jmo, nobody's got a crystal ball that works, and I've been wrong
many, many times about many, many things.

One of my first "conservative" investments as a teenager; I believe at the time
met all the conditions from your book:
Universal global appeal
Instant name brand recognition
Products or services you "dispassionately believe" will continue to be in
demand "for years" 

The Answer: <u>EASTMAN KODAK CO</u>

(Note: I sold it only holding only for a few years)

Longest held investments:

BHP Billiton Limited Common Sto (NYSE: BHP)
A gift from my Father's estate. 4th largest holding in portfolio (5.5%)
Purchased 12/11/90

Chevron Corporation Common Stoc (NYSE: CVX)
My top holding adding shares from time to time (2003, 2004 & 2006). Represents
almost 10% of the portfolio.

One of my fist Long Term investments in early 1980's was Texaco. I believe it
was selling around BV and paid a very good dividend at the time almost 5%.
Texaco was merged w/ Chevron/Mobile. I added a few shares in 2003. Should have
reinvested the dividends.

Sempra Energy Common Stock (NYSE: SRE)

A college graduation gift from my Father. Originally known as San Diego Gas &
Electric. This one I just continued to hold beginning in the early 1980's. It
always paid a good dividend. Sempra Energy was created through the 1998 merger
of Los Angeles-based Pacific Enterprises, the parent company of Southern
California Gas, and Enova Corporation, the parent company of San Diego Gas &
Electric.

I sold about 20% of the position over the years but the original gift in 1980
(after selling 20% of the shares) has increased 680% not counting dividends.
Their biggest gains came from their NG pipeline subsidiary Sempra U.S. Gas &
Power ( http://www.sempra.com/about/our-companies/semprausgp.shtml ) which
today is probably their most valuable asset.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------

My best investments (and themes) came from my father which I continue today. I
am not the eventual "Gold" Bug he became (he was loading up on gold and gold
stocks when gold was $320/oz) but look to all the Natural Resource Companies
for "Value". Many were Oil companies but others included both junior and major
mining companies. His value investing criteria to me was (1) Buy stocks that
sell for a 10 PE or less and (2) Look to companies that own hard assets (as a
store of value). I believe both those suggestions still work today.

here we are trying to figure which company will offer us sustained growth and
untold riches in 20 years. My guess is that just like we talked about apple
several times as a value stock, but no one said this is the one stock we need

Thanks for all of your thoughts re: position sizing within a portfolio.

I've found that I typically initiate positions at 2.5%, then add from there,
unless it's a total speculation, in which case I start at 1%. Let's just say,
at this point, I'm very conservative (aren't we all, as value investors?).
Maybe it's all of the "macro headwinds."

Does anyone have thoughts about American Greetings (AM)? I'm new to the thread,
so sorry if there's been discussion in the past.

It's attractive to me, currently trading at 76% of tangible book value, 4%
yield, P/E 7. At $14.75, AM's within 15% of its 52-week low. Anyone else

Would you be confident to advise someone to hold KO, MSFT, JNJ for another 20

JNJ (not very cheap), MA (expensive), TJX (expensive).

The rest? Either not cheap (enough) or do not satisfy the criteria.

Honestly, it would be very hard for me to recommend holding any of the above

The examples of companies failing to live up to expectations include several
tech stocks. Maybe that would be an area to avoid. Some of the failed stocks
seem to have provided clues to dispassionate stockholders that going forward
their companies would have difficulties in the marketplace. For example, the
effect of digital photography on Kodak's business built gradually, and there
was time for Kodak stockholders to reassess their predictions of Kodak's
future. I presume Mr. Spooner, being a rational person, would of course
occasionally reassess his long-term estimates for his "stock for life".

You mention a time frame of 15 years. If you look at JNJ as a lifetime stock
over twenty years, a ltb&h person would seem to have done okay, maybe better
after reinvesting dividends. "Okay" being a relative term
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=my&s=JNJ&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=&c=
^GSPC&c=^IXIC&c=^DJI

You seem to have added another criterion: "attractively priced". I don't know
if any of these stocks are attractive on a price basis at this time. In my
case, I expect I did not find any of them attractive when I looked at them 30
or more years ago. They didn't seem to be values to me. Then though, I wasn't
interested in buying a "lifetime" stock, so I didn't consider paying up for
such.

At this point my lifetime stock of choice is Nestle (NSRGY). Chevron (CVX) as a
second. Maybe Diageo (DEO) a third. I expect I'll be holding on to all three (I
only have a very few shares of DEO though). Exxon (XOM) has been discussed here
as a ltb&h stock. (I've no shares) People with no real interest in the stock
market have gotten rich over time by holding one or another utility stocks for
30 or 40 years.

I give you your point: "It's not as simple as Buffett-Spooner-concentrated
portfolio proponents try to make it sound." I don't conclude though that this
method of investing should be avoided.

Sure, I picked a timeframe that suited my point. However, you seem to forget
that Spooner's advice is to pick a single stock. What if you pick KO or JNJ in
1999? These are not techs and there was no indication that they will have
problems for 10+ years. Do you believe that holding them another 20 years would
rectify low returns in the first 10 years? It's very hard to catch up once
you've fallen far behind.

Yes, I added another criterion: "attractively priced". Because if you don't,
you get 12 years of subpar performance. This might be OK in diversified
portfolio, where other stocks will potentially negate your few hold-forever
underperformance. But IMHO in a concentrated portfolio 10 years of subpar
returns are pretty deadly. Especially, since there will be a tendency to bail
out just as the stocks become cheap, since they have not moved anywhere for so
long.

But overall, I don't care. I don't plan to hold a single stock. And I don't
plan to hold a single stock of overpriced company even if it was KO. So, yeah,
I will miss some huge runups like HANS (renamed MNST:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=MNST+Basic+Chart&t=my ). But I also won't get
stuck in 10+ years of going nowhere. Or at least if I do, I will know that I am

I may have incorrectly stated Spooner's idea(s). I don't have any of his books

Paul -

Some people say that their best investment over their lifetime was their home.
The average home is held 7.5 years. I think that the only thing that this
proves, is that any good producing asset held over 10 or more years, will be
more valuable.

Most people are consumers, do not save and want immediate gratification. Simply
holding an average producing asset (like a utility and/or good dividend payer),
reinvesting the dividends will produce an above average return.

This does not occur in stocks anymore. You even stated that the average holding
period for a stock is now down to 20 seconds (due to high frequency trading).

HPQ expected earnings per share for next 12 months are 4.49 and yesterday it

Giving us a forward PE of 6.5, thus I called it ridiculously cheap. Giving it a

As far as debt; the debt to equity ratio for HPQ is 0.5 which seems quite

Yes, SFL is at a breakout point. This is my No. 7th position with my last buy
in September 2011 at $14.86. The whole shipping sector is breaking higher. SFL
is the major lender to FRO (at least has the most exposure) and is benefiting
from the Sector bounce. Awhile back, SFL did renegotiate some of their lease
agreements w/ FRO to help avoid a default by FRO. In doing so, SFL reduced
their minimum lease guarantees in favor of a larger profit sharing percentage.
They had no choice to to the deal as Fredricksen their largest shareholder
structured the deal.

Therefore, if this move higher in the bulk shipping industry is real and the
Sector is in for a long sustained uptrend, SFL could be the beneficiary of
higher profit sharing returns. It's still small when compared to their previous
guaranteed cash flows from their long term leases w/ FRO. With the cost of
capital so low, this new arrangement provides a better deal for both companies
until rates start to increase.

There is still lots of value in SFL but their business is only as good as the
market they are lending to (ie. dry bulkers, oil tankers, and jack up drill
ships). I expect to see more financing deals as Fredricksen said that he would
be deploying more capital on new ship builds. SFL would be the beneficiary.

If the chart signals the possibility of a break out, the fundamentals that I
watch seem to support a much higher price. Earnings, PE and future cash flows
support a $15.00/share stock price and if/when those new ship orders come in w/
long term leases, $19.00-$20.00 share price is not unreasonable.

If all of that occurs, SFL should move from a #7 position in the portfolio to a
#2 position. More importantly for me is their $1.26/share annual dividend is
secure. It should yield around 8% which would indicate a $15.75/share price. So
that would be where I would expect the break out would find it's first major
resistance.

I am not an AAPL bull. However, people who call it overvalued bubble don't have
a clue either. Look at the E/EV or even just plain P/E. Look at the growth.
ROE. Any cash flow metric really. None of them are overvalued even if the
growth stops.

The only big risk with AAPL is a nosedive in phone sales. If the trendy public
moves to something new, AAPL could get hurt really fast.

The still big opportunity for AAPL is capturing any percentage of the remaining
80% (?) Windows PC market. If AAPL manages to move to 30-40% PC market share,
the current valuation is way low.

HPQ was 20% lower just recently and you could of bought it. I don't think it is

coverage is greater 10x.

Mine did. Especially as I occasionally come across folks who're not much
interested in stocks/"the market" but who've bought one or two stocks and just
kept them and maybe reinvested the dividends. With the result it's made a
significant difference (hundreds of thousands of dollars) to their retirement.

Some participation in market is better than no participation at all. If the

I won't deny that investing all my money in GOOG after its IPO or in BRK in
1995'ish when I started investing would probably have led me to good/better
results than what I did instead. I'd have to double check though ;). But it's

Hi EKS. The numbers are incorrect on home ownership and on stock ownership

The avg. holding period for a stock is about 6 months according to NYSE data.

NSRGY and DEO are IMHO too expensive. Not a buy for me.

Well that's a key point. If I were buying because they were undervalued and
maybe to be sold when they would reach fair value-- or maybe only buying when
they might be undervalued because only then would they provide a margin of
safety I'd require, -- then I would likely not have ever bought them.

NSRGY mentioned several times here. I started accumulating in '03 with stock at
$19, more in '04 at $24, '05 at $27, '08 at $35, '09 at $32-33, '11 at $55. (
Never reinvested the dividends.) Possibly at any of those times and purchases
it was never a value buy.

I started buying DEO in early '09 when the stock dropped back to the price
point at which Mr. Buffett apparently had given up on it. (His buys of '05, I
guess. When he was reported to have been considering making an offer for the
company. Perhaps he agreed with you that the company was/is too expensive.). In
at $45, adds later at $61, a little more 8/11 at $74. Just a few shares overall
as I imply. With DEO and also similar sector company PDRDY a few months ago, I
made these buys on dips - ignoring that they might not have fallen low enough
to be considered value plays. My intent here though was for them to be a ltb&h
(ten years, min.). I am wondering if I can do that with Church&Dwight (CHD), a
stock that may have started this conversation, a stock I'm stepping up for (for
just a few shares) even though it's now near its all-time high.

yep NSRGY was never a real value stock. my first buy was at a 14x PE. I believe
I have almost a tripple on this first buy (this position still sits in one of
my accounts:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=19110144&srchtxt=NSRGY

For a lifetime stock, quality and consistency beats valuation.In my opinion,
it's better to buy NSRGY at a PE of 16 (which is the current valuation) than a
mediocre company at a 12x PE. MGDDY (which I own) would not be in the cards for
a lifetime stock, due to being too cyclical. JNJ looks good and I think NSRGY
is an even better business. of course you would never want to pay let' say
25-30x earnings for a business like NSRGY, that would set you up for a long
period of subpar returns but as long as the valuation is just OK, one should do
fine.

Sometimes, all I think I would need to do is buy these kind of stocks at good
prices, which do come up every couple of years. In the meantime just let the
money accumulate in bonds or something similar. During the financial crisis in
2009, NSRGY could have been bought at 11x earnings - I got some but clearly not
enough. That lot is up almost 2x, same than the SP500 from the lowest value but
with much lower risk, imo. in fact NSRGY even during the financial crisis,
never skipped a beat and increased their earnings and dividend. FWIW, they just
released their Y2011 earnings and those were excellent again (earnings up ~8%,
nice topline growth etc.).

It is a key point. If you are buying without doing valuation analysis, you are
no better than Gorilla Gamers. And we all know how that ended.

OTOH, Clownbuck is completely self contradicting when he says 14PE and never
was a value stock in the same sentence. 14PE can be a value stock. 20PE can be
a value stock. A stock with no valuation analysis though is not a value stock.
It is a belief investment. A belief in management, a belief in brand, a belief
in demand or whatever. I refuse to do belief investments, but you guys can do
what you want.

And BTW, when Brian mentioned DELL, he made a great point without noticing it:
most of lifetime stock successes are small caps that grow fast and more than
anyone has expected. The megacaps like NSRGY or KO or JNJ may have been
lifetime stocks. They won't be such in the future. It is impossible to grow at
tremendous rates at these sizes.

On the third hand, it is very hard to value small cap growth story and predict
where it will end up. But once again, just refusing to do the valuation because
it's hard, is a road to a lot of lost money.

Well, I disagree. Low single digit growth will not outperformance make if you
buy overvalued stock. Sure, if you buy it at 11PE and sell when it goes to 20PE
and repeat, you will have OK performance. But not if you buy and hold forever.
Valuation is extremely important for megacap slow growers. You cannot just say,
I'm gonna buy it at any price, since it's a great brand, great management

Bought some UPL at 23$ despite some reservations. Since my valuation framework
for E&P is reserve valuation, i believe that UPL is cheap: Currently they have
5TCFE and EV ~ 5.5B$, which means the valuation is 1.1$/mcfe. This is way below
replacement cost (>2$/mcfe). They announced that they want to live withing
their cash flow in Y2012, which is a good thing, imo, considering their debt.
1.1$/mcfe is a very low valuation for a company that has decent management and
is a very efficient producer. Even though NG pricing outlook looks crummy right
now, myt bet is that this is a low enough price to start bottom fishing.

Seems somewhat disingenuous to suggest value investing is not belief investing.
There's belief and hope associated with almost any stock purchase. The belief
that something will change (or maybe not change, eg. that an announced takeover
actually occurs), something positive, to drive the stock price higher. In the
long run, Graham said, the market's a weighing machine. To me that means for
any value stock I'm about to buy, the belief part is that I have to believe
when I go to sell it, that market participants will have bid up the price.

"...most of lifetime stock successes are small caps that grow fast and more
than anyone has expected." I interpret this to mean it's mostly the small caps
that become lifetime successes. I believe that for most people (including me)
most success with a lifetime stock will come not from rummaging among the
small-cap lifetime possibilities, but rather going with the fewer larger-caps
that have already established themselves.

"Buying a stock without valuation analysis is not value investing."

Yes, although I'm not understanding your point. I do a value analysis on every
stock I review. Something like CHD, DEO, others, I don't claim them to be value
stocks. Because in my analysis I put them up against my value criteria of p/bk,
p/e, roe, etc., and they don't fit. I believe I lead off posts on them with an
"ot", and/or I try to say that I can't call them value stocks in the way I view
value stocks and/or in the way I believe others here might describe a value
stock.

So as to avoid the definitional/connotational aspects of the words
"invest/investing", I'll just say you enter the stock market in the way you
believe is best for you. And I enter the market in a way I believe is best for
me. There's a category of stocks or a number of stocks that have performed well
over the past 20-30-40 years. I know real "normal" workaday people who've made
small fortunes buying such stocks and holding on to them for 20-30 or more
years. To me they are successful in that they made good money and achieved
financial independence in this way of being in the market. I want to join them
and participate in that way of being in the market with some of my monies too.
I believe I can find such categorical stocks as these people. I may not have
the fortitude to hold on and I may pick the wrong stock or two, and at my age
time is not my friend. I will continue to try though. I would find it foolish
not to.

Armanino Foods of Distinction, Inc. Announces Record Fiscal 2011 Sales,
Profits, and Earnings Per Share

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Armanino-Foods-Distinction-bw-3524749862.html?x=0

From the article:"...Armanino Foods of Distinction, Inc. (Pink Sheets Symbol:
AMNF) today reported record sales and profits for the year 2011.
Sales in the fourth quarter were $5,981,843, reflecting an increase of 3.3%
from the $5,793,003 posted in 2010. 2011 fourth quarter pre-tax profit from
continuing operations was $644,063 compared to 2010’s fourth quarter profit of
$793,139. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $487,434, compared to
2010’s fourth quarter net income of $562,584. On a per share basis, fourth
quarter net income amounts to $0.015 as opposed to last year’s $0.016, which is
a decrease of 7.8%.

<clip>
Edmond J. Pera, President and CEO, stated, “Armanino is pleased that it had
another record breaking year in sales and profitability. Our success is further
amplified in our earnings per share which have been positively affected by our
first and second stock buyback programs. Demand for our core products in 2011
was strong and we continued to add onto our customer base including some
national accounts.” Pera added, “Although our sales have grown annually in each
quarter of 2011, our profitability in the fourth quarter was adversely affected
principally by higher raw material costs. We are managing our margins
accordingly, cognizant that we are in a highly competitive environment.” In
conclusion, Pera stated, “We are optimistic in our ability to grow sales in
2012. Our light basil pesto, which contains 50% less fat and 25% less sodium,
is currently being introduced to distributors whose sales teams are dedicated
to selling health food products to retirement communities, hospitals, and
schools. So far, our light basil pesto has shown favorable responses, although
it is too early to tell if material sales will follow. As Armanino continues to
gain market share and visibility we expect stronger competition in 2012.
However, given our strong sales momentum and stable financial position, we are
well poised in this landscape. Our balance sheet remains strong and we are
confident in our ability to continue to pay dividends, amortize our debt, and
fund possible future stock purchases and/or increase dividends from working
capital.”

Armanino Foods of Distinction, Inc. is an international food company that
manufactures and markets frozen Italian specialty food items such as pestos,
sauces and filled pastas to the foodservice, retail, and industrial markets. In
addition to a classic Basil Pesto Armanino offers other flavors such as
Cilantro, Dried Tomato & Garlic, Roasted Red Bell Pepper, Southwest Chipotle,
Artichoke and Roasted Garlic. Armanino’s Organic line includes classic Basil
Pesto. Frozen pastas, sauces, meatballs and Focaccia are also offered by
Armanino Foods...."

Auto loan company NICK. Stock seems to be lagging other auto loan companies
that I am following. Meanwhile used auto sales seem to be strong as apparently
are new car sales now. Each auto loan company that I am following has a
different business model from the others. One is a buy-here/pay-here (I have no
shares. This model being investigated by state officials because of some such
companies' business practices); one company partners (shares loan profits) with
its dealers; and there's NICK which basically has small retail shops in
southeast & midwest US.

I sold most of my shares as stock has moved up (now at 12-mo) high. P/e is
about 8 now. ROE is 17%. Company has been profitable right through the '08-'09
auto manufacturer's rough patch. NICK recently (Sept) instituted a quarterly
dividend. One guy (Mr. Vosotas) is the founder and controlling stockholder.

I'm guessing and speculating that given the apparent strength now of the auto
market and because NICK with its good metrics (low p/e decent roe, as I view
it), NICK shouldn't be lagging the other loan company stocks that have had
better moves. Or seem to me to have had better moves. So the stock looks
attractive to me.

I'll call my exit of shares a mistake, and at NICK's current high price, I'll
add back some shares.

Biggest negative I see now would be the low trading volume in the stock and the
stock's volatility. So there might be a better (lower) entry point coming.

I'll just arbitrarily tack on a 10% earnings improvement for HNZ for the
following year. P/e would be $54.47/$3.62 or 15. At a p/e of 15 I'm indifferent
to the stock. I decided I'll just close my stub position today and average up
on my few Emerson (EMR) shares. I like EMR for a reversion-to-mean play
(forward p/e now is relatively low (i.e. relatively to EMR previous years) at
about 13, per Yahoo).

I'm guessing that if stocks in general are going to move up, it'll be because
of multiple expansion and not so much due to great increases in revenues and/or
earnings. That is, in a continuing low interest rate environment, I am hoping
for a general market p/e expansion.

The others are far more leveraged which explains why NICK has underperformed
compared to them.

But, it was a lot less risky stock.

I own it from much lower levels but have sold much of mine.

I figure they will eventually be bought out.

Its hard to pin down actual earnings because of past over-reserves and more
recently under-reserves related to past over-reserves. Its clear they make a
lot of money but exactly when it was/is made is up for debate.

The the bottom line is its a low risk way to play high risk subprime lending.
But how much upside does it really have ? I expect Peter would take his marbles
and go home if an offer of $16-17 materialized.

I used to own CRMT but sold out way too soon and never bought CACC because they
are the slimiest of the slime.

What state is investigating buy here pay here ?

Its effectively impossible to police because SO many people have bad credit &
little money.

So even if they charge a low interest rate, they jack up the price of the car
to make up for it.

Is a state going to limit how much a dealer can charge for a used car ?

Regarding bhph dealerships:

http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/25/business/la-fi-buy-here-bill-20120125

http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/25 |By Ken Bensinger, Los Angeles Times
"New legislation in Sacramento aims to protect car buyers from being
overcharged at used-car lots by requiring the dealerships to post the fair
market value on each vehicle they sell.

The goal, Assemblyman Bob Wieckowski (D-Fremont) said, is to help inform
consumers who otherwise have no idea what a fair price for a vehicle is before
agreeing to buy it.

<img src='http://articles.latimes.com/images/pixel.gif'>

Although the bill applies to all lots selling used cars, he said AB 1534 is
aimed specifically at Buy Here Pay Here dealers, which sell to people with low
income and bad credit.

Because they are often the lender of last resort, Buy Here Pay Here dealers are
able to mark cars up far over fair market value because their customers are
desperate for transportation and have little bargaining power. Combined with
interest rates that can exceed 30%, customers of such lots often end up paying
10 times what a car is worth."

This Los Angeles article described the situation the writer saw:

"A vicious cycle in the used-car businessWheels of Fortune
Sign, drive, default, repossess and resell — that's the game at Buy Here Pay

First of three parts

"Tiffany Lee wanted a car. She was weary of the two-hour bus ride to her job at
a UCLA Health System clinic. She hated having to ask friends to drive her
7-year-old son to his asthma treatments.

<img src='http://articles.latimes.com/images/pixel.gif'>

But as a single mother with three children, bad credit and a $27,000-a-year
salary, she couldn't find a bank or dealership willing to give her a loan.

Then a friend steered her to Repossess Auto Sales in Hawthorne.

Another buyer might have balked at the deal she was offered. Lee figured she
had no choice. She put $3,000 down and drove off in a 2007 Ford Fusion,
http://documents.latimes.com/tiffany-lee-experience/#document/p1 $387 a month
for four years. The interest rate: 20.7%, nearly triple the national average
for a used-car loan.

A year and a half later, Lee fell behind on her payments and filed for
bankruptcy. So she was relieved when the dealership called and offered to make
her loan more affordable. The sales manager even promised to throw in a free
smog check. Lee, 35, drove back to Repossess Auto on a rainy Monday evening,
handed the keys to an attendant and sat down with the manager.

Moments later, she said, employees parked four cars tightly around the Ford,
blocking it in.

There would be no new deal. Lee's car was being repossessed. She and her
children waited in the rain until a friend could drive them home.

Lee, who described that night as “one of the worst experiences of my life,” had
stumbled into the bare-knuckle world of Buy Here Pay Here used-car sales.

In this little-known but fast-growing corner of the auto market, dealers
command premium prices for road-worn vehicles and finance the sales at interest
rates that can top 30%.

In a kind of financial alchemy, they have found a way to turn clunkers into
cash cows and make money off the least creditworthy customers: the millions of
Americans who are stuck in low-paying jobs, saddled with debt and unable to
qualify for conventional auto loans.

For most of those people, having a car is the only way to stay employed, and
they'll accept almost any terms to get one.

Buy Here Pay Here lots sold nearly 2.4 million cars nationwide last year, up
from 1.3 million a decade ago, according to CNW Marketing Research.

CNW estimates that there are more than 33,000 such lots nationwide, compared
with about 20,000 dealerships selling new cars. Buy Here Pay Here dealers make
$80 billion in loans every year, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.

<img src='http://articles.latimes.com/images/pixel.gif'>

<img src='http://articles.latimes.com/images/pixel.gif'>
Although dealers are loath to open their books, profit margins average nearly
40%, according to a trade group, the National Alliance of Buy Here Pay Here
Dealers. That's twice what new-car dealers make.

Many of the lots require customers to return once or twice a month to make loan
payments in cash -- hence the term Buy Here Pay Here.

A key reason for the industry's growth in tough times is that dealers can come
out ahead whether or not customers keep up with their loan payments.

About 1 in 4 buyers default. In the real estate and credit card industries,
that would be bad news. In the world of Buy Here Pay Here, it's just another
avenue for profit: The car can be repossessed and put back on the lot for sale
in short order. A new buyer makes a down payment, takes on a high-interest loan
and the cycle starts anew.

Provided they don't get wrecked, these recycled vehicles just keep paying
dividends. At some dealerships, cars have been sold and resold over and over --
three, four, even
http://www.latimes.com/business/buy-here-pay-here/la-fi-buy-here-pay-here-timel

Im not sure they call it an over/under reserve but thats the impression I get.
Not saying they are doing anything wrong or shady, its just hard to exactly
predict loan loss reserves. Thus, Im skeptical that current earnings are going
to continue to grow & grow & grow.

That article regarding BHPH is not really accurate.

Sure, the cars are priced way high but its a very tough business because for
every honest down on their luck customer, theres 2 who are professional
con-artists.

Not sure "forced" regulation is going to solve anything. Sure, most people
would be better off not buying from a buy here pay here lot. But the liberals
arent going to drive them to work everyday.

NICK really deals in the higher end of the subprime market. People who have
encountered a single issue that has now passed, like a divorce of job loss, and
otherwise a great record of paying.

Theres money to be made in the buy here pay here business but its just not as
glamorus as the article makes it out to be.

Indeed, the objective of the better lots is to NEVER repo a car. A paying
customer is worth 2-3 repos.

Its just hard to take $1200-2500 wholesale pieces and expect them to last 24-36
months without needing sometimes significant repairs. The better lots will
often repair the cars of good payers & tack it on their note.

The easy solution would be to close all the BHPH lots down. I guess they would
go after the subprime lenders next.

Yes, they all serve or prey on the credit & cash constrained customer.

The liberals dont have any answers though.

The way those lots work is this (learned from brother in law who once worked in
such a lot for a month). They buy cars at auction. Say a Chevy for $2,000. They
price it at $5,000, deal down to $4,000, and want $2,000 down, and finance the
rest at 10% They put a GPS device in car telling you it helps you, but it is
meant to help them repossess.

But they do provide valuable service. They wash the car and do a minor tune-up
before sale.

I would not say so much that they are taking advantage of the poor as that they
are taking advantage of the ignorant. After all, with a little effort one could
get on Craig's list and buy a car for $2,000, and avoid the markup and interest
fees.

I am not sure if they cheat or not but we are talking about proved reserves

Of course there are those that are conservative and those that are not. UPL

Except for he disaster with Shell, I am not sure I heard much about issues with

Buy here pay here is an illusion to be a new car store experience on a low end
used car purchase.

Unsophisticated people with bad credit or no credit go there.

These are buters who are generally not savers.

Generally this business is at its strongest after the government gives low
income people more than they have put into the federal income tax system as a
tax return.

This once a year money burns hot in their pocket and they are able to buy a
better car than they have money to pay cash for, with usually weekly payments.

Good BHPH develops and works with a very loyal clientele.

That being said,there is a core of bad credit, high risk people that create
huge losses from accidents and no insurance or skips (Leave town/state).

BHPH offers transportation to those who would not be touched by banks and do
not know how to go out and make a good used car purchase.

Most BHPH charge the limit interest rates.

The mark ups are twice the cost plus a thousand with 35% being reserved for
repo losses.

I have attended several national conventions held by Leedham and associates
regarding BHPH.

If you are good at collections BHPH is very rewarding - if you are not good at
collections BHPH can be a disaster.

I started a BHPH back 1998 in a very small way with just a few customers in a
low income area of East texas.

I found it trouble free.This was before I learned about the big markups. kept
it to strictly local people.

My most rewarding experience was from a perfect payment customer who paid like
a clock.I had documented her perfect record and GMAC allowed her to buy a new
car on the First Time Buyer program.

I remember as I delivered her first new vehicle - she began crying with
pleasure.It was far beyond her initial dreams that she could ever become a new
vehicle purchaser.

BHPH has a place in the overall scheme of automobile purchases.

they announced on Friday as they worked through the large inventories. They
need to increase revenue fast. They need at least 100m a qtr to be cash flow
positive. Rev's are increasing but is it fast enough to save them from running

Robert, interesting color on BHPH business. I am not sure if BHPH really should
have a place in car sales, at least from a customer perspective. The math just
simple does not add up - you can buy a car without the markup from craiglist (I
have done this several times with good results). OK there is fraud there too
but if you have a little bit of smarts, it is quite easy to get a fair deal
there.

I agree that BHPH preys on the ignorant rather than the poor. Somewhat OT -
many of the poor are poor because they are ignorant. It is amazing to see the
number of seemingly poor people with Iphones and 100$/month cable bills. It
seems that basic financials skills are lacking for many.

Speaking of ripoffs, I tried some social games with the ipad myself after I saw
my wife playing. These games are mostly free to download and the developer
makes his money selling virtual currency to buy goods in their games. Seems OK
but I realized that as you progress in this game, there is often no way to play
this with even halfway reasonable odds against somebody who spents real money
so I lost interest.

I dug into this a little more and found out a scathing article about ZGMA ) the
leader in these social network time games. Apparently, the company (and
probably it's competitors) make money by milking a small fraction of users
(called Whales) that spent thousands of real $ to buy virtual goods. I always
thought that the idea of these games is to suck in large amount of users in
their free games, that later purchase small amount of virtual goods. As it
turns out, a very small fraction of users buys virtual goods (5-10%) and only a
small portion of these are whales that spent thousands of $, however that small
fraction is responsible for a huge amount of total revenues. It strikes me that
these users are probably in some sense addicted and in any case this situation
strikes me as completely unhealthy and unsustainable. Anyways, here is the
article. This also affects my view of Facebook, since gaming is a huge revenues
source and they get a 30% cut of the revenues from the game developers:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/347951-the-number-1-reason-to-avoid-zynga

Seems odd that someone would pay thousands of $ for a game, when you can play
World of Warcraft for a 10$/month or so subscription online or Civilization on
the ipad for 13$.

and this one:

Nothing I see there has convinced me that your first hypothesis that most
revenues are due to a large base of users is not true. Obviously companies
cater to whales too as do casinos in Vegas, but their number and money spent
was IMHO highly exaggerated by the thread author to create Internet drama. I'd
go with ~0.5% player base being whales and ~10% revenues being from them.
Depends on the game a lot though.

Casual games are mostly crap, so I don't play them, but obviously companies use
elaborate methods to get users pay for at least some features or items. In
Free2Play MMOs (which are different from casual games), usually paying
subscription is cheaper than buying features piecemeal through points. But it
does depend on the game, on the player, etc.

No positions in Zynga or Facebook and no plans for any in the future. I am sure
that GRVY, GAME, PWRD, etc. make most of the money from casual players and not
some kind of whales. ;)

Maybe it's internet gossip but I bet it contains a kernel of truth. My wive
played a restaurant sort of casual games and she definitely noticed people that
were dropping hundreds of $ on virtual goods that you could not possibly obtain
just by playing.

I also noticed myself that the game I was playing was heavily skewed towards
buying stuff. Basically the fact that I don't really have to play well to
succeed but just drop money takes the fun out of it for me, so I uninstalled it
on our ipad. But I can see how one can get sucked in into dropping more and
more to get ahead in the game. So i gathered the dusty Civilization Revolution
game for my PS3 and played that for a little. Much more fun and much cheaper.
