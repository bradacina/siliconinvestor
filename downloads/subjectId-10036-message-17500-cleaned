Portfolio update - NHY, E, APC, JNJ, NRGN
I sold my remaining position in NHY. The stock seems fully valued now. I am
considering to take a new position in the oil sector. My current favorites are
E (the italian multinational) and APC. I don't have a position yet.

I bought a first position in JNJ. Not super cheap but reasonably priced. PE
about 19. AAA credit rating, very clean balance sheet and stellar LT record.
Chart looks good as long as 50$ resistance hold, IMO. The stock is weak because
of the botched coated stent rampup. I still bet that JNJ will solve the
problems (after all the product is approved) and that this will be a multi
billion dollar product. I am looking to buy more on weakness.

I bought a speculative position in NRGN, a small biotech outfit trading at
moderate premium to cash. NRGN is specialized in neuro/brain drugs and has a
couple of molecules in the clinic. All of them address big markets. the
flipside is that the company has been in drug development business forever and
never came beyond Phase II so far.

regarding PXT -
I looked at PXT as well. it seems to me that they are in the super catastrophe
reinsurance business. Loss ratio was only 38% during the last year which is
very low, however there were no real supercatastrophes either. Expense ratio
was 32% which is very high, IMO.
I think the big if with PXT is what happens when a big catastrophe happens.

Buying WLM this am.

Cigar butt(?): Always lousy ROE. And just such a fun and glam. business being a
manufacturer of polyethylene terephthalate packaging resins.

I'll characterize WLM as a revision-to-mean play. Stock's near its five year
lows, and if the business is cyclical - as it has been (but may not be now) -
then I'd expect stock to be performing closer to its historical p/sales
numbers. That would see the stock ($9+ now) somewhat closer to its stated book
value ($13.65). I'm guessing maybe some point in the next 18 mo. or so.

According to those posts, the conversion price slides down were certain price

Eastman is in the same boat. If you notice Eastman Chem. Their earnings were
down for the quarter, below expectations, but the stock was up. I think Paul is

I was just studying the May 27, 2003 proxy for Wellman. Although this is not a
"floorless" preferred financing the floor on the preferred is $ 6.75 versus
initial conversion price of $ 11.25 (40% difference). This represents a deep
discount. This preferred has a lot of teeth and hair (Preferred has accretion
factor meaning dividends not paid in cash are added to liquidation and
conversion preference).

On pro forma basis book value would have been diluted from $ 13.39 to $ 12.75
had the preferred been converted on 12/31/02.

One wonders about the timing of such a financing. Hats off to Warburg Pincus
who could own 48.9 % of the company at the end of five years for approximately

Re MRK -
I don't like MRK at current prices and the reason is Zocor. Zocor is MRK's
largest cash cow but its patent will expire in 2006 and in some foreign
countries earlier than that.
I don't see with the pipeline currently visible and even with Zetia (which is
shared with SGP) how they can grow out of this gapping hole once the patent is
gone. MRK's recent quarter has a lagging topline growth (7% despite positive
currency effects) and sharply increasing SG&A and R&D costs (17% and 25%
respectively). I think this is a sign of more things to come.

"They say" it's much more difficult to talk somebody out of an investment that

(coupled with your track record from what I can see from your posts here) are
very strong.

As I look at the investment choices that I see, it seems ABC is a safer
(whatever that means) bet than MRK now. And yet ABC also offers the possibility
of growth by being involved with both big pharma and generics.

As regards MRK, I just wonder if the issue I need to address is not whether to
add more MRK shares, but rather, what to do about Medco. You can assume that
since the terms will be .12 sh. for every 1 MRK share, that I'm not going to be
receiving many Medco shares. So if I want just a small position in this
distributor, I'll have to add more Medco at some point. I've got to game
whether MRK shareholders will be dumping Medco because they just want MRK,
and/or if Medco might be a buy at time of issuance. (Anybody here with an

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/030723/cgw072_1.html

Stock's come down to near year's low after having had superb run since 1/'01.
P/e is reasonable especially given excellent profit margins still being
maintained.

Per Yahoo, "The Company assists distressed companies in improving their
financial position, or their creditors or other stakeholders, in maximizing
recovery of their claims."

Maybe FCN stockholders have been selling and taking their profits, because
things have been so good for this company they can't get better. Especially if
the general economy is now improving, and so there's less need for this
company's services.

I don't sense that though. And even if it is so that an improving economy will

that'll push up prices of most other stocks.

I post it because this is what I basically use too. I like to use ROA because
it's so readily available and easy to screen for. Also, as the article says,
moving to a "threshold" of 2% ROA is, I agree, a desirable goal.

Just having a 2% ROA is unusual (in the universe of banks I look at). A 2%
sustainable ROA and a low p/book is very unusual and indicates a potential

Wellman not alone-BASF- Some Foreign chemicals having a hard time to.

LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany (Dow Jones)--BASF AG (BF) reported sharply lower second-
quarter net profit Thursday due to high corporate taxes, and sales fell on
negative currency effects.

But cost containment efforts by the German chemical company led to a gain in
operating profit before exceptional items, beating consensus forecasts.

The company was guarded about business developments for the rest of the year,
however, saying "major efforts" would be needed to match 2002 sales and
earnings in 2003. The comment was interpreted by some analysts as a profit
warning.

It expects risks associated with volatile oil prices, the uncertain development
of the U.S. dollar and persistent stagnation in important economies to stand in
its way, and said it doesn't expect a general economic upturn until the fourth
quarter at the earliest.

For the third quarter, it expects sales to be flat year-on-year and said
earnings before interest and tax before special items would likely fall.

ABN Amro analysts took BASF's outlook as a profit warning, but said its
second-quarter results were decent under the present industry circumstances.

Bernd Schnarr, chemicals analyst at WGZ Bank in Duesseldorf, Germany, didn't
see it quite the same way. "It's not a profit warning, but it's very bleak," he
said. Schnarr isn't planning to change his accumulate rating on the stock, but
said he will likely reduce his full-year earnings estimates.

BASF shares fell sharply on the data and on overall negative sentiment for the
sector following weaker-than-expected earnings data from its rival Bayer AG (
BAY) on Wednesday.

At 1050 GMT, BASF shares were trading down 5%, or EUR2.05, at EUR39.25. Bayer
shares continued their decline Thursday, trading down 3.6%, or 72 cents, at
EUR19.15, after falling to EUR19.90 from EUR21.28 on Wednesday.

BASF's second-quarter sales slipped 1.6% to EUR8.25 billion, short of consensus
expectations for a slight rise. Forecasts ranged between EUR8.04 billion and
EUR8.65 billion in a Dow Jones survey of six analysts prior to the data.

Operating profit before special items inched up 1.2% to EUR832 million,
slightly ahead of expectations for EUR832 million. Forecasts ranged between
EUR796 million and EUR870 million.

Operating profit after one-time items fell to EUR744 million from EUR817
million, hit by EUR58 million charges to restructure operations in the North
American Free Trade Area and to integrate a recent acquisition at its
agricultural chemicals division.

Net profit slid to EUR195 million from EUR502 million, burdened by a one-time
corporate income tax expense of EUR124 million, which BASF said it's appealing.

The charge is related to a change in German tax law regarding corporate income
tax credit on dividends, BASF said.

Sales volumes and selling prices rose by 3.2% and 3%, respectively, in the
second quarter, but a sharp rise in the euro against the U.S. dollar wiped 8.9%
off overall sales.

Chairman of the company's Executive Board, Juergen Hambrecht, said the company
wasn't pleased with the performance from its North American business in the
second quarter.

BASF's sales in the North American Free Trade Area fell 13% year-on-year to
EUR1.98 billion in the second quarter, and operating profit before special
items slid 33% to EUR52 million from EUR77 million.

"We are not and cannot be satisfied with this," Hambrecht said.

The company has decided to step up restructuring efforts to boost earnings, and
said it expects to book an additional $14 million charge in the second half of
the year.

Hambrecht declined to talk about possible site closures, saying he would
provide further detail on the subject in the latter half of the year, but
executive board member Klaus Peter Loebbe said the company expects to cut
around 1,000 jobs in the NAFTA region by the end of the year.

While mega-mergers or major acquisitions are not part of its immediate growth
strategy, Hambrecht said the company plans to significantly increase cash flow
this year to help finance targeted acquisitions, partnerships and regional
expansion.

The company plans to raise its investment spending this year, but Chief
Financial Officer Kurt Bock said it will exercise "strict capital discipline"
in its expansion strategy.

The company also plans to continue its share buyback program next year. By the
end of the first half of 2003, it had spent EUR226 million on repurchasing 6.9
million of its own shares, and repeated its goal to spend a total EUR500
million on share repurchases this year.

Regarding Costco, we want to separate the business from the stock. Imo anyway.

The business is great from my customer perspective. I like the merchandise,
food, prices, service, relatively quick checkout, free food tastings. Looks
like others agree. My local stores are generally pretty busy it seems to me
(and I try to shop off-hours).

Considering just the stock, I would try to categorize the stock as either a
value stock or a growth stock. When I bought Sept.-Nov. of last year between
$34 and $31, I considered it a growth stock.

Now I'll want to consider re-categorizing it. After price drop of past couple
days, it's still no value stock. If it's a growth stock, it's a busted one.
Sales are up, but earnings are now expected to be similar to last year
($1.48-$1.50 vs. $1.48, diluted,).

So I want to know if the earnings problem is systemic or readily fixed.
Marketwatch says, "On a conference call with analysts, Costco said that half of
its profit shortfall is the result of pricing skirmishes with Sam's Club,
particularly in the high-margin commodities and drugs categories. Though the
aggressiveness in cutting costs to consumers is just short of a pricing war,
analysts worried that it could go on for some time." So it seems to me that
some major issues hindering bottom line performance aren't going to go away.

I see COST still in an expansion mode (opening new stores), and I expect that
COST's good management will somehow work through and resolve some of the issues
that are hindering bottom line performance. COST had a drop in earnings from
2000 to 2001, and the company came back from that. So did its stock if one
bought after the stock had abruptly dropped. I acknowledge that the stock price
now is relatively high with a p/e of about 20. OTOH, in the past decade COST
has sported a p/e that high or higher in most every year.

I'm holding on to my shares, and I'm considering adding a bit if COST drops a
little more. I'd be guessing that the bad news is mostly out, and that with the
passage of time, we'll see some improvement in bottom-line performance (in

Re: Costco -
I agree with you that Costco is neither a growth nor a value stock. PE is about
20 now. I have it on my radar screen but I do not on the stock. I would become
interested when it falls to 25$.

I don't think the business model is broke. Costco is the price leader in most
categories it chooses to compete and despite having one of the lowest growth
margins in the retail sector (<20%), the company is fairly profitable. The
Internet may be a threat in some categories (electronics, jewellery) but who
orders a rug, a pair of jeans,a case of beer or a refrigerator over the
internet? I am member and for me as a single person it pays off - a family
without doubt will get back the membership fees many times.

I stopped into Costco last week to grab a couple of steaks and sides - potatoes

Walked out of there with three nice steaks. Had to buy 20 lbs of russets and 5
lbs of fresh mushies though. Smallest packages I could find. lol.

Can anyone shop at Costco and NOT spend more than they figured when they went

fwiw: Closed an exploratory position in PSMT last week at a small loss.

It's the Costco model (i.e. Mr. Price's Price Club) translated to Latin
America, the Caribbean and Asia. Except that the translation's not working out.

Stock at lowest point since inception. Sells below stated book value. If Mr.
Price and crew can turn the business around, the stock should do very, very
well. (although maybe from a lower level than today's $9.24/sh!) I just don't
understand the problems, don't know if the business model works in foreign
settings, and I've no desire to ride this thing while waiting for a turnaround
in which I have no positive expectations.

Great comments about Costco, but as a Costco member since 1984 and a former
Costco shareholder, I have to agree with Paul: the company is so much more
attractive than the stock.

Admittedly, I love shopping there. Their buyers are good and tough, know
quality, and work with the suppliers to help lower costs. Parking lots and
lines are always full. People are always helpful. They keep refreshing the
inventory and always seem to pleasantly surprise.

But the stock is a different animal. I'm not attracted to the thin margins and
a business model that depends on expansion and competing on lowering prices.
Yesterday's WSJ story about rising inventory, rising worker's comp and health
care expenses are troubling if I were a shareholder. As the WSJ put it
yesterday, "Customers love Costco...there is clearly little wrong with the
store concept.....The problem is SG&A costs are too high....Costco can't hide
rising costs....Can a company that does so well by customers and employees
possible be a bad investment?"

I sold my shares a few years ago when I started getting troubled by its
valuation and growth prospects.

But I still shop there.

Wallace,

You may be right.

I don't buy watches, I don't eat meat, so can't comment on these. :-). Books I
buy used on Amazon.com - never paid more than $1-3 per book + shipping. Even
better, since I read mostly SF&F stuff, I sometimes order bulk from local
online merchants and pick it up at their place instead of paying shipping
costs. :-) (I guess I am value investor after all :-)))

Yearly fee is good to shareholders. I can bet that if a serious study was made,
lot of people won't recoup it, as it is with yearly gym fees. Also it
psychologically MAKES you go to Costco even though stuff may be available in
more convenient places. I can't understand why the store keeps the fee if all
people recoup it. E.g. I would try the store if there was NO fee, so presumably
they would have more customers?!?! And as Buffett said: "if after three rounds
you can't understand who the loser is, it's you", so I don't go there. :-))))

Ahh, there's the rub! Then it means that the people don't "recoup it" :-P

Consider this: if all people recoup the fee, Costco could eliminate the fee,
raise the prices by ($866mln/yearly_revenue) percentage and come out even *with
prices still lower than the competitors'!* (by the logic that the all fees are
recouped and people still end up ahead from buying somewhere else)

pressure is from retail grocery. Many chains feel the threat, and are
sacrificing margins to maintain share. Many grocery retail stores have posted
dismal results recently. I haven't looked into it, to in depth, but I suspect
retail grocery chains margins are even thinner than Costco. There have even
been some chapter 11 filings recently (retail grocery and wholesale supply).

GSH: This is a great China play, sole railway operator in the richest area in
China, paid 6-8% dividend in the past 5 years, business growing.

I bought couple thousand shares when SARS news was all over the place (this is
my style, once I determined a good stock to own, I always buy/add when short
term bad news hit). I paid $8-9.5 and already got a $0.60/share dividend last
month. I was hoping to buy more but the price moved pretty fast trading on thin
volume. Look like it is being discovered by some big buyers and the train is
leaving the station...

I do think GSH will be able to make a 20-30% gain comfortably in a year,
potentially a 50-100% gain in the next 1-3 years, even from the current $11.40
price.

Book Value (mrq) $14.27
Earnings (ttm) $0.84
Earnings (mrq) $0.39
Sales (ttm) $3.51
Cash (mrq) $2.76

GSH - The Company operates the sole railroad, 147 kilometers long, between
Guangzhou, the capital city of Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen, one of the
original special economic zones of the People's Republic of China established
to promote economic reforms in China. The Company's rail line connects with the

Any good insider buying plays ?

I am just not finding the kind of stocks I like to buy.

Under $10, significant insider buying at or below current prices. A book
value,NCA and/or low P/E play.

On one hand, I hate to have so much cash sitting around with rates so low, on
the other, I dont think buying stocks just to be buying them makes sense.

I have this "seat of the pants" approach. Last time i found stocks I liked, I
was still kind of in shell shock from some of the stock value losses and thus,
I did not buy as aggressively as I should have.

But then, I am getting older and less willing to "swing for the fences"

I might even look at real estate.

I just see a possible scenario where the next 20 years the market underperforms
to make up for the prior 20.

But, I will keep an eye out for both insider buy/sell ratios and insider buying
in specific situations.

"I just see a possible scenario where the next 20 years the market

That has been the historical pattern for over 100 years. I suspect the reason
for it is that when you wipe out one generation it takes a new one to start the
cycle all over again.

Although I expect some period of accumulative underperformance - after all we
are already way under water since 2000 - I do not think it will last as long.
In the old days, investing was much more an individual affair. When you wiped
out the individual he was really gone. Now, we have a less risky investor
profile, with continuing inflows through 401-K's. I think this change in the
"investor" mix will result in a shorter period of underperformance.

On the other hand, the economic management of the country's finances borders on
incompetent, in my opinion. This offers significant risks of very bad things
happening.

Paul, on PIOS, I have some comments:

-17 times next year's WS estimates of 49 cents is hardly a super bargain for a
distributor. I wouldn't want to bet we have a recovery lasting longer than next
year.

-I think the trend toward overseas electronics production is an important long
term factor for USA electronics distribution companies. It used to be that
these companies were always great investments for about a year or so after
cyclical bottoms. That possibly is still true. However, it now looks as if the
recoveries will be to ever lower peaks as the domestic market shrinks.

-The balance sheet is worse than it seems. The cash just covers the debt and
the mandatorily redeemable preferred. The book value is only $5+ if you take
out the good will. With some of these companies, like SEMI or JACO, selling
under tangible book value, you would have a tough time persuading me that good
will incurred in a different era is worth anything. Another example, NUHC,
sells below tangible book value, has no debt, and has nearly $2 a share in
cash.

I think you won't get hurt, but won't do terrific either.

I recall seeing something on this on Barrons in the past 3 months. The person
who was short this company mentioned a few caveats- the company's loan loss
reserve is not under a lot of scruitiny unlike that of a bank, and also unlike
a bank the company can only generate more funds by being able to sell shares.
On a personal note- when i first started in banking- a lot of smallish banks
made loans to finance companies and each of themm would get their lines cleaned
up once a year. But when their loans turned south they had good collateral but
it ws real estate and suddenly the banks realized they could never really get
cleaned up in this business, at which point most of them decided to stop
lending to finance companies- as a result most of them had to be liquidated. My
bank at the time had an auditor whose only job was to go to these finance
companies and audit their files to make sure the collateral was what it was
supposed to be and that they maintained good records. That is enough to make me
cautious here.

ACAS --
this is a hard company to follow. But I follow it VERY closely.

2 things happened recently. 2nd Qtr results had lower NOI than prior qtr.
Management has always said qtrly results are lumpy -- they said that this was a
blip. Said 7 cents of the 9 cent drop was due to raising more equity then
necessary prior to the war, just to be safe. listen to the conf call. look at
their website and view the slideshow. they also reaffirmed the ACAS will meet
all profit, dividend and other goals. said that already in the qtr, have
resolved 2 major non-accruing investments favorably. also said that NOI would
be so strong in 2nd half, that dividends will be paid from NOI, although that
was not a firm commitment. they may use capital gains (that's normal).

the second thing - today -- a disclosure that the SEC asked for some documents.

http://finance.messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&action=m&board=7080674&tid=acas&si

http://finance.messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&action=m&board=7080674&tid=acas&si
=7080674&mid=22968

Finally, we note that the current valuation remains attractive from the
historical perspective. ACAS shares recently traded at approximately 8.1X our
2004 NOI per share estimate of $2.90. Our price objective of $28 assumes that
ACAS shares trade at 9.7X our 2004 NOI estimate, or about 5% below its
long-term historical average. ACAS' 5-year historical forward multiple is
10.4X, while its 2-year (i.e., during the recession) average historical forward
multiple is 10.1X.... Our forecasts of $2.90 NOI in 2004 mean that almost all
of our $2.93 dividend estimate for next year will be covered by NOI. We
forecast that dividends will
rise by approximately 5% in 2004 from $2.80 to $2.93 and that NOI will grow at
a faster pace. It will increase by about 14% from $2.55 in 2003 to $2.90 in
2004.

'In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of all such proceedings
is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
conditions, or results of operation of the Company.'

.................

i hope this just is another bump in the road and added to my position. insider
buying is very strong and reassuring. i've found mgmt to be honest and open in
the past. all my holdings are solidly in the black, even excluding the
dividends received. i think it will take 3 to 6 months to resolve, because they
need to put $250 million to work, and that could take a little effort. If they
become more fully invested in Q3 (now), then Q4 will be quite healthy with
added interest and fee income. in the conf call, they said deal flow is very
strong.

the conf call had a number of pointed questions from skeptics and possible
short investors -- it was good to hear them addressed. they asked about
specific valuations, deals, accounting for investment banking fees, whether
cash was used to help non-accruing loans to recover... solid answers...

Oh, there was a 3rd ithem -- the barron's article a month ago. it was a poorly
research article and has been refuted in various places. it caused the stock
price to drop temporally. a lot of the shorts used to opportunity to cover
their positions. darn.

I calculate very impressive NOI in Q4, when the $250 million is invested.

Email Teaser

I always like to try and figure out the "mystery" company in email advertising
teasers without paying the piper for a subscription. Anyone have any ideas on
this one?? Talk about a value play. P/E 5 under book value

"This month in Extreme Value, subscribers learned about the
Extreme Value version of Buffett's own Berkshire Hathaway.
It's a company that has earned 20%+ returns on capital
every year since 1985, doing exactly what Buffett did. It
buys distressed assets in various sectors of the global
economy. It usually buys them at deep discounts to their
reasonable net asset values. Some assets are not producing
cash. Some produce copious cash flows. Its portfolio is a
hodgepodge of seemingly unrelated businesses and assets,
just like Berkshire Hathaway... and the Extreme Value Model
Portfolio.

The company I'm talking about is trading at 5 times
earnings and less than eight-tenths of book value, and it's
holding the equivalent of over 70% of its current market
value in cash and securities.

Extreme Value subscribers get the name of the company, its
stock symbol and the Extreme Value maximum buy price, which
has yet to be reached, even though the stock is up 25%
since our buy recommendation."

unique. I have not liked the cumlative unrealized depreciation in their
portfolio. They have yet to demonstrate they can perform over a long period.
Thus the jury is still out.

I believe this will still trade close to its 52 week low over the next couple
months. That will be another great trade opportunity again.

re: "OT has anyone looked at TSO?"

Sure. Have had a very small position since '02.

TSO's not an OT subject to me: at current price it's a value stock (imo). (low
price/stated book, and low price sales)
Refinery biz. hardly ever good and not very exciting (except when there are
explosions). With this sector, I prefer to buy a package. I have HOC, VLO, TSO,
GI. HOC's being bought out. My fav. is VLO (I like its aggressiveness, presence
in Ca., size, p/bk). Possibly VLO's still within buying range for a value
investor. With TSO, my notes show negatives are questionable competence of CEO
and his high salary. (Also note high salary for VLO's sr. mgmt.)

Thanks, Grommit and Brinks. Appreciate the diverse comments on ACAS.

I added yet more ACAS today.

Brinks, hard for me to see ACAS trading again close to its lows. If it were to
trade down at stated b.v. it'd provide an annualized dividend yield of
$2.76/$16.11 or 17%. (I assume the dividend isn't going to be cut, and I could
be wrong.) OTOH, history might repeat: the stock has traded below 16 in the
past 12 months. I've seen dividend yields at 18% before; scary to be owning the
stock then, because one knows something's not in equilibrium or sustainable.

re. NWL. I spotted it on the new lows list. I'm wondering if Chinese
competition exists and is significant enough that it might cause investors to
permanently value NWL at these lower levels. Something's not right with NWL:
sales have increased slowly but as you report, earnings growth seems to have
been stymied.

Dividend seems high in relation to earnings. And that debt/eq. level is
relatively high too.

I was negative on NWL the last time it was discussed here, and I was wrong.
Stock was about similar price, moved below 20 and commenced to move up. For me
now, I'll wait on NWL and see how it might look if the stock comes down to
those lows again (19-20+).

I note the author's opinion that the distinguishing feature between value and
growth is low price/book value vs. high price/book value. That wouldn't be my
first cut for separating the two classes: I'd say more low p/e (or low avg. p/e

no growth in sales/sh.vs. high sales/sh. growth.

re: TSO. Book value not increasing over past few years. Profit margins continue

INVESTOR SENTIMENT

Substantial growth in investor optimisim and complacency is in evidence.
For instance, at the market bottomlast october, investors were pulling money
OUT of mutual funds at a substaintial clip. But, Lipper reports investors
poured $`9.5 BILLION into stock funds in June, the largest inflow since March
of last year. (The market topped out on March 19 last year to begin 6 down
months in a row)

Bullishness amond investors as measured by the AAII,II, the VIX index,etc, have
also shown significant growth. All reached extremes of optimisim in recent
weeks that have not been seen in a number of years,and in the past were
associated with important market tops being near.

INSIDER ACTIVITY

There has also been an impressive growth surge in the amount of selling by
corporate insiders.
According to Thompson, insiders are selling $25 for every $1 they are buying.
Anytime its above $20, its usually been bearish.

This is only the 2nd tyime in the last 10 years the indicator has been over $20
for 3 months in a row. Last time was July,august & september of 2000. (6 months
later the S&P 500 was down 25%, the nasdaq 54%)

LACK OF INSIDER STOCK PURCHASES SENDS A WARNING TO THE MARKET

By Tony Cooke

--The message that insiders are sending to the market can be summerizerd in one
word :Sell.

The sustainted drought in insider buying versus selling that began 3 month ago
has been matched only once in the past 10 years,according to data from Thomson
financial.

That occasion- july through september 2000- preceded a 19% drop in the market
in the ensuing siz month period and a 28% drop in the following year, said Lon
Gerber,director of insider reseatch for Thomson Financial.

"It just so happened that was the worst 12-month performance in the decade,"mr
Gerber said.

Mr Gerbers measure of insider sentiment compares the dollar amount of purchases
to the dollar amount of sales. Last month, that ratio stood at $32 of sales for
every dollar of purchases,the third consecutive month in which the ratio topped
the 20 to 1 measure that Gerber considers a sell signal.

Gerber said a dearth of purchases rather than a glut of sales, has driven that
ratio higher in recent months. He said he suspects market valuations have
gotten ahead of earnings results,making insiders reluctant to add to their
holdings.

"Executives right now are not willing to buy...untill they see more earnings
visibility" gerber said.

Michael Painchaud, reseatch director for market profile therorems,tracks
insider transactions by their number rather than their dollar value,but reaches
conclusions very similar to Mr Gerbers.

"We dont think its an accident that the markets have been moving sideways.
Insiders tend to be very good predictors of value".

Other trackers of insider data are similarly gloomy about the stock markets
prospects. David Coleman of Vickers has moved his model portfolios out of the
market and Jonathon Moreland of InsiderInsidersm recently took positions in
funds that are betting on a drop in technology stocks.

Gerber said that in the past 10 years there have been 14 months in which the
ratio exceeded 20-to-1. On 11 of those occasions,the stock market was lower 6
months later.

Painchaud said that although there have been limited signs of improvement in
insider sentiment in the past week,he remains wary.
"we wont begin to turn bullish untill the insiders turn bullish" "We're
waiting. They'll tell us"

Comment - why do you let these intangible macro factors affect your decision to
invest in value stocks?

Are you investing in the broader markets and trends these stories discuss? Are
you investing in all the companies with insider selling? Do you plan to buy
index components that could be affected by mutual fund flow direction changes?

Most value investors don't work that way. We look for specific situations that
present compelling values. The broader picture is one whit away from
irrelevant. Value investors can always find sectors moving up and identify good
plays within those sectors.

You are mixing momentum market timing issues with "value investing". It's a
complete contradiction, IMHO. Value investors don't follow the herd. Otherwise
we would just buy index funds and find a new hobby.

I might even look at real estate. 

I think that might be a classic case of buying at the top. Although not quite
rivaling 1987, I am seeing what I consider the beginning of classic bubble
indicators. When I go to cocktail parties, more people are bragging about the
values of their r/e holdings than stock holdings.

The stock market, having taken the huge hit over the past few years, is
certainly below the bubble mode. As this thread suggests, it's a time for
finding values. Values can be low PE or they can even be story stocks with a
good chance of a turn around or which are already turning around through new
products, mergers and acquisitions.

In general, I've found successes in even OTC BB stuff (although I prefer to
stick with listed stuff). If you pick the right stock, with solid fundamentals,
real sales and prospects for profitablity, with little debt and beaten down in
terms of historical pricing, that's the way to go IMO.

I also usually hold 30-40 of these so that a total collapse by any one or two
is usually just a blip. I've experienced even during the market collapse that
major wins can be expected in at least 5-10 of a well picked small cap
portfolio. In the worst year, I had probably 5 bankruptcies. However, I also
had 5 4 to 10 baggers. The net result in the entire portfolio had a tremendous
return despite the general market collapse.

I believe I have seen evidence that periods of extreme overall insider selling
tend to be followed by periods of down to flat markets. Similarly, I have seen
& believe evidence that when many investors are optimistic, it pays to be the
opposite.

Combine the above with my inability to find the kind of buys that I find
compelling and it makes me wonder if I should not take it a step further and
look to further lighten up my overall equity positions in order to have more
cash available for when both overall and specific situations appear more
favorable.

I believe a rising tide lists nearly all boats and vice versa. Sure, a few
stocks might react otherwise but I doubt my or anyones ability to consistently
choose those stocks that react favorably to any market environment.

I disagree 100% with your statement that I am mixing momentum market timing
with value investing.

I agree that value investors dont follow the herd. Indeed, the herd is BUYING
stocks that the ultimate value investors (insiders) are selling them.

I am suggesting we go opposite of the herd and take advantage of what may be
short-lived market highs to lock in profits that we can later use for buying
when more & better opportunities present themselves.

Are you suggesting that value investors must remain 100% invested or nearly so
at all times ?

I have the largest cash position than I have ever had.

I am not contemplating placing a market sell order for every position I own
monday morning, but as value investors, I think we can & should factor our
overall view of the market in our decisions.

In other words, I know that WHEN i find stocks to buy, I can often find a lot
of them. But if I have limited funds, I cannot buy as aggressivly as I might
have liked.

It may well be that later in the year we have a number of situations driven by
tax loss selling or whatever that create buying opportunities. If I was fully
invested, I would not have cash available to take advantage of those buys.

I am not suggesting that I or anyone can perfectly time the markets, but we can
zig when the majority are zagging. We can sell when the insiders are and buy
when they are buying.

I view both as extra wind at my back.

Alternatively, If I am fully invested at all times, and come Nov. the market is
down significantly and there are a number of stocks i like, I would be in a
position of HAVING to sell an undervalued stock during a period of market
weakness in order to buy another.

I appreciate your comments despite the fact that they surprise me and we
disagree.

"inability to find the kind of buys that I find compelling"

I suggest being careful as to the standards you are using. Just as we may not
live long enough to see the general level of excess seen in early 2000, I also
doubt that we will see any time soon the kinds of valuation in tech stocks (and
many others) that existed last Fall. Somewhere in between is the kind of
valuation levels that will exist most of the time. If you sit there in cash,
thinking about those Fall valuations, you may be earning 1% for a long time.
The biggest mistake I have made this year by far is to spend too much time
looking into the rear view mirror - "It was a great buy at $10 and it just has
to be a bad buy at $20".

September and October look to me to have the potential this year to be real

I doubt my or anyones ability to consistently choose those stocks that react

Personally I stay fully invested most of the time. I decided long ago to focus
my energies on stockpicking (where I can figure out a company) instead of
market timing (where there are zillions of factors to consider and precious few
reliable patterns).

FWIW, the top midcap value fund over the past few years did pretty well staying
invested:

^spx,^ixic,^dji&a=v&p=s&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l

We each have our own styles. You asked for comments and I gave you my
perspective. My own portfolio has outperformed this fund by several points over
the same two-year period.

You should do what works for you. But I agree with the other poster who said
you may wait so long for the perfect pitch that the game passes you by.
Dwelling on macro issues seems to lead most people into a paralysis of
analysis. And I can't see how most people who aren't economists or market pros
can sort out the macro data any better than they can analyze individual company
fundies.

Last idea - I own a lot of international stuff now that doesn't correlate with
US indexes. It's still cheap value stuff but it's also my way of adding a hedge
against the overvalued US market index concerns (not that I own much in the US
in the major indexes either).

Good luck.

wolfdog2, regarding SR. I consider it a weak hold at current price.

Competition in document management is strong (e.g Xerox, imo). SR's annual
revenue shows declines for several years. It's my guess that SR's best days are
behind it until evidence shows otherwise.

I suspect the stock's where it is because of the generous dividend yield. I'm
not willing to bet the dividend's secure.

I sold most of my position last year. If I see $20 this year (stock's at
$17.85) on no news, I'll likely close the position.

Dale, I think that is very well put. In my opinion, 90% of people should just
be buying a fund like the one that was just mentioned, or a DODGX, or an index
fund like VTSMX, or an index trust stock, month in and month out. They will end
up with loads of money at retirement over a lifetime of doing that. 90% of the
remaining 10% should focus on buying stocks in companies with good prospects
and good management, at good prices, and just hold them so long as the company
they presumably understood well enough to want to own performs according to
their expectations, does not get very overpriced, or a better idea doesn't come
along. The remaining 1% might have the ability to try to do it all and

Paul, thanks for your response. My thinking was that SR's business should pick
up as the economy recovers, which it (the economy)appears to be doing. I agree
that the dividend is propping up the stock, but I don't see it as being in
jeopardy. My concern, when I first started studying the situation, was that the
company wasn't migrating quickly enough away from paper into digital
applications. Their web site is a horror and gave me little hope that they were
doing what they should. However, I finished listening to the last cc a little
while ago and came away with the feeling that they have a better handle on the
situation than was apparent at first glance. You are quite correct about heavy
competition in some of their areas. But the shares go ex-dividend on the 20th,
so I'm thinking of purchasing a small position before then and watching. I
don't think this stock is a home run, but it might be a nice single with a 5%
dividend to compensate for the wait.

rjm2, agree with you that aggressive insider selling is troublesome. Chart of
major indices (COMP, SP500, RUT) are showing signs of topping out.

On positive side, treasury bonds sold off significantly, as we all know that
Warren Buffet sold 9B dollars of bonds. We may expect the herd following him
continue to sell bonds, those fresh cash need some place to invest - and it may
continue to pour into stock market.

Some survey says investors are optimistic on stock market. Depends on the
survey happened in what "circle", the result may not be the same. I do see many
newsletters being very bullish in the past couple months, and they were proven
right. But when I talk to my regular friends who are not investing pros, most
of them are still on the sidelines, showing some interest in stock market due
to the recent rise, most of them are bragging about how their houses
appreciated in the past couple years, in the range from $50,000 to $200,000 in
5 years. Many firmly believe that their home price won't go down, or if they go
down, they won't go down much.

I am still holding many deeply undervalued stocks bought in the past 12 months.
I did unload some of them that became fairly valued, and bought some small tech
companies that survived the crash and demonstrating 10% sequential revenue
growth. I am also taking some short positions (such as SPY) as a hedge. I am
currently 65% net long versus 100% net long 3 months ago. I have been wrong in
the past so I may be wrong this time. But some hedging is needed to ensure my
great gains in the past year don't just go away.
