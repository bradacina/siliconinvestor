The flip side is to buy when others are fearful and your favorite stock has
been put on sale at a discount, Buffett's rule.

Stocks are the only thing I know of in the world that people don't like to buy
when they are cheaper. Human nature is funny that way.

My largest portfolio position now was averaged in well under a buck when the
herd was at its most fearful. Now it isn't far from $5 thanks to some fortunate
events in the last year.

Doesn't always work, but a real value hound has to be ready to dig in and fight

"Strong irrational downward" creates many a value investor's dream potential to
buy. The rational ones are the problem. Of course, renewed due diligence is in

Dr Ipsofacto. I'm not so sure it's correct to say that Mike Burry advocated
selling on new lows. I don't remember it that way anyway. He usually or always
seemed like he was willing to go against the crowd esp. if it was behaving
irrationally, afaik or remember. Perhaps I'm wrong.

There are two situations. One would be irrational selling to lows of a stock
you are already in. Perhaps he might say get out if the person's emotional
state causes him/her worry. I don't know. The other case would be irrational
selling of a stock you see or are following, but don't own. I have to believe
he'd consider entering at that time, if the value were there.

Paul Senior, this is from one of Mike's posts on this thread

"As you know, I have a simple philosophy: sell on new lows.

There are two reasons for this:

1) Many people do this. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. I try to do it
quicker.

2) If I know something is a fundamental value and it breaks to new lows, the
selling is irrational by definition and I don’t want to be in the way of
irrational selling. Better to wait for the buyers to show where they are
willing to step up and give support.

I suffered for several years trying to be stubborn in the face of irrational
selling and all it got me was a lot of 50% haircuts on stocks that had already
been too cheap. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned was that PE 8 stocks
can become PE 4 stocks and stay that way for a long time..."

Yeah, something not right there with that post. Although Mike claimed several
years of investment experience, I always believed he was coming off of, and
still had, a very small bankroll. That may have influenced some of his
decisions. If you're up against the wall when your stock declines, and you're
astute or aware enough to see other possible stock opportunities, it becomes
difficult, I believe, on a very limited bankroll to hold on or add more to a
losing position... a position that's moving down although the fundamentals
remain intact when they are rechecked.

Or maybe this too. You have a profit and it affects the portfolio results (and
maybe you are trying to become a pro investor, so you publish your portfolio),
well you don't want, can't afford, to show a big temporary loss, so are willing
to crowd-follow and sell on lows.

I'll have to go back and look, if I get interested enough. I don't recall Dr. B
being a big user of stops. Which he might, if he were concerned about beating
other people in a rush to exit a stock if it dropped.

Selling new lows doesn't work for my style of value investing. For my type of
value investing, it would be a complete disaster. That being said, I think if
your stock continually hits new lows, you should consider whether you missed
something big in your original analysis.

After being on the value board for years, I tend to get a little jaded about
disciples of top value investors hanging on to their every word, treating it as
Gospel rather than thinking for themselves. This is not to say ignore these
greats, but to try to learn from them as much as possible in developing your
own investing style.

I view the wisdom of the masters as helpful, but I certainly don't feel
constrained to do something because Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, Michael
Burry, etc said so. I think each of us has to find our own path to investing
success given the particulars of our own investment situation.

It's called buying at the point of maximum uncertainty.

This is very difficult to gauge as buffett put out his stock purchase call in
Oct 2008 and markets just collapsed feb-march 2009 to lower lows. The problem
with selling at the new lows is you do not know whether you will be whipsawed
out. What if the stock just rebounds sharply after hitting the low and you sold
already? Do you chase it?
I was lucky enough to talk to Ed Schloss and Walter on a few occasions. They
had one phone so Walter would kind of rush Ed off sometimes. Ed used TDW as an
example how he purchased it in stages not all at once. They did not do anything
different than what I did. That is what was so amazing. The advice Walter gave
me was to take a few acounting--investing courses and use value line. Investing
is not that complicated unless you are hunting in complicated territory kind of
like General growth properties/bankruptcies...I kick myself for not working a
little harder on that one.
I was also so surprised in that many of the so called the great value investors
did not have any more experience than me in handling this devastating collapse
of 2008-early 2009. As a matter of fact I feel I saw more of the risks than
they failed to see like chris davis and dodge & cox and even whitman who found
out some of his safe and cheap were not to safe after all.
You need to keep it as simple as possible while keeping your decisions to a
minimum so to avoid keeping emotion out of investing. Munger says to use a

Sell Rules - Interesting Topic

I used to struggle with this a lot. When do I buy more, when do I sell. I felt
like this was much more of a problem when I only had a couple of stocks I
really felt strongly about. But now that I'm trying to build a base of 20
stocks I'm considering, if not owning, my sell and buy rules are mostly based
around where I think the % return potential is at.

I guess my two rules at any point in time are:

1) What is the expected gain of this stock over 6 months to a year

2) Am I exceeding 5% of my portfolio with this stock (though I'll admit to
breaking this). :)

Basically, these two rules now govern my buy and sell rules and I allocate my
buys and sells based mostly on #1 with a check on #2. As stocks go up and down,
that forces me to re-evaluate my position and move balances. I tend to leverage
in and leverage out of positions as opposed to buy all at once and sell all at
once.

I think it used to be much harder to invest and pick buy and sell points before
I adopted this strategy. Then you're left with rules like selling on new lows.
That works sometimes, but backfires at others.

Just my two cents.

Thanks,

cwg

Kelly Criteria: I get the feeling Klarman uses something like this, hence his
big bet on News Corp. Do any of you use it? I've been contemplating it and I'm
sure I'll implement it to some extent. About 10-12 years ago some of us here
were into a little net-net play (I forget the company) that was selling for
about 1/3 book value, and it was nearly 100% cash. Before stopping operations,
the company had been burning cash. It was bought out within a year by a small
investment firm. I wish I'd used this criteria then. But on the flip side, you
get KDUS which looks similar, but has forever had no catalyst.

If you haven't heard of Kelly Criteria before, it is used to determine optimal
bet size when odds and payoff are known or can be estimated. A Bell Labs PHD,
oddly enough named Kelly, came up with it in the 1950s:

f = (bp-q)/b

f is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager

b is the net odds received on the wager (that is, odds are usually quoted as "b
to 1")

p is the probability of winning

q is the probability of losing, which is 1 - p

Agreed. It’s certainly not my intent to be a Burry disciple, but I just found
his idea of selling on new lows (if it is his strategy) counterintuitive and
thought provoking.

"I think each of us has to find our own path to investing success given the
particulars of our own investment situation."

I'm glad I brought it up because it's awesome to read everyone's strategy. I
appreciate everyone's input.

It does seem logical to use a stock's irrational movements/momentum to your
favor. Whether getting out of an old position until the trend breaks or
starting a new position to capitalize on a trend, it’s obviously situation
dependent. I know patience is an investor's creed and one often needs to
weather the storm, but if a strong trend is seen why not capitalize on it? It's
a game-time decision, but why just play offense and not defense? Even the
Cowboy’s have to punt every once in a while (lately all the time).

Personally, I'm still learning stock analysis and don't yet feel comfortable
playing defense. I'm too worried I'll miss "something big in [my] original
analysis". I'll just err on the side of patience. It’s my hope a good
fundamental value investment will unlikely present extreme irrational trends
warranting a defensive play.

Kelly Criteria: Thanks for the links...good info on Kelly there. Its nice to
have a simple, accurate model for sizing investments. Unfortunately, it is like
valuing a company by PV'ing future dividends in that the formula is accurate
and precise, but the inputs are usually guesswork so the answer has bad
precision.

The Criteria would drive me to fewer and larger positions than I'm comfortable
with yet. I suspect I'll eventually get to 10-12 holdings with 10%-8% in each,
but I'm not there yet. For one thing, I think Kelly applies to sequential bets,

Dr. Ipsofacto,

Sorry if I sounded critical. It is good to discuss these ideas from time to
time, so thanks for bringing it up.

One thing about my strategy is that I often focus on cash-rich or
current-value-rich companies with low debt. As these go lower, they become more
attractive and less risky IMO. I realize they could lower, which is why I don't
like to take a full position on the first buy, so that I can buy more if they
go down.

However, a highly cyclical, debt-laden company continually making new lows
could be in a death spiral to bankruptcy. If you are playing in that space,
then you might to stop yourself out.

tomsawyer. Welcome to the board. We've got people interested in discussion of
overvalued securities. Some people here are looking to short them too, I
believe. So post your suggestions and reasons.
--------------------------
"...I hope the board considers shorting as a part of value investing also"

Speaking for myself and not as moderator, I believe that shorting is NOT part
of value investing. It's not, primarily because, imo, it requires a very
different skill set from buying and holding value stocks. Also the margin of
safety with shorting is different from buying undervalued stocks.

Imo, it's simplistic and wrong if somebody has the operating idea that value
people find stocks that are undervalued and then buy them, and in finding them
we also come across stocks that are overvalued, so we might or could just do
the reverse and sell (short) those.
My analogy is that in walking, we walk forward with no problem, and it might
seem that we should just reverse the process and be able to walk backwards as
well too. It doesn't work there, and imo, reversing the process of buying then
selling, doesn't work for value investors either.

I'm not saying shorting doesn't have it's place, just that in value investing,
it is not part of value investing. That's imo, based on my experience and
observation. Other people may differ.
--------------------------------
PAY may be overvalued. It almost always seems to be. My small position
established last year at $6.72 with a later buy at $14.03. I've never
considered it a value stock for the reasons you mentioned -- high p/e and
lawsuits. Also competence of management is an issue for me. As mentioned by
Jake Straw though, their verifones are ubiquitous, and at some point when stock
was low, it was worth a shot to me to buy a bit. Every time I use their
machines for a credit card transaction I consider selling my shares, given the
high share price as you mentioned. Grateful that I am for the few shares I
have, I also consider too that I shoulda/coulda/dint buy heavily when I might
have.

On the one hand, the stock seems like people are rushing to the exit doors
again. That seems to have been a mistake in past. Otoh, there's new info --
health care legislation is going to hurt the company - at least this year -
more so than management expected. Also some slower selling drugs. The earnings
miss itself doesn't seem to justify such a sharp sell-off, bwdik.

I have a small BAX position established last year, and I believe I'll stick
with it. I added a few more BAX shares today at $49.70 with the intent that if
I can catch the stock in $48+ area, I'll add a bit more.

Here's where I am regarding some of my recent health-care purchases/sales:

The way I look at it - last quarter's earning is inflated because they don't
pay taxes. If you cut cost and maintain revenue at run rate, the business has a
potential EBIT margin of 10% - in that case, the stock should be in mid teens.
Also, if you subtract the goodwill from the assets, tangible equity becomes
negative. 33 patents and negative equity? That doesn't make sense especially

I agree the stock is not cheap at it's current price using a variety of

A undervalued insurer that weathered the credit crisis quite well and even got
an am best credit upgrade to A during the crisis period. at 60% of book value
this one just needs to close the gap to be profitable. NWLI invests mainly in
corporate bonds and did not suffer the large losses of the other insurers.
mainly a life and annuity insurance company. Run by conservative folks. The bid
ask can be wide and the share price can be quite volatile. the firm had two
lawsuits against it, one settled for 17 mil and another outlier lawsuit had
some ridiculous jury award over $100 mil which will be overturned. Got to
believe this is what is holding it back from creeping higher. check it out for
yourself. In at much lower levels but 60% of book for A rated conservative
insurer seems a little ridiculous. It does tend to trade at a discount to book
value because of the smaller float and closely held family run business.expect
the gap to close to something like 85-90% of growing $307 book value
eventually. love these high priced boring stocks.

Leibnitz, because I've said I'm not claiming VTRAF to be a value stock, I'm not
buying it because it's undervalued. Although it may be undervalued, given the
info. that you see a couple people here have provided. I'm buying it because of
what I presume to be its ability to provide food commodities from Australia and
Canada to the peoples of Asia. It's a growth story for me.

And a sleeper stock. Apparently like several others in the business. They seem
to operate in the background, behind the view of most investors. Cargill, the
massive privately-held corp., Asia's Noble Group (NOBGF), for example. Maybe
SEB. Last year I learned of VTRAF in the sector. Like NOBGF, I'm expecting my
position in VTRAF to be a set-and-forget stock. If I catch the stock near 12-mo
lows, I might add to build up my small position. Otherwise, I'm expecting I'll
just hold the stock at least five years to see how its business performs.

Re NWLI
Item 8.01 Other Events

National Western Life Insurance Company (the “Company”) is the named Defendant
in the case of Sheila Newman vs. National Western Life Insurance Company which
alleged mishandling of policyholder funds by an agent. On February 3, 2010, the
415th Judicial District Court of Parker County in Weatherford, Texas, entered a
Final Judgment against the Company of approximately $208,000 for actual
damages, attorney’s fees for preparation of trial, and prejudgment interest on
the actual damages. In addition, the Final Judgment included $150 million for
exemplary damages.

The Company will continue to vigorously defend this case by filing an appeal of
the Final Judgment with the proper Court of Appeals in Texas. The Company
believes the Final Judgment is inconsistent with current state and federal laws
and intends to establish on appeal that it is not liable for the Plaintiff’s
actual or exemplary damages.
=========
This is how foolish some judgments can be. I believe it was an annuity sale and
the customer was reimbursed for all losses and fees of 208K but the judgment
penalty is 150 mil??? Real great legal system. we allow the entire Real estate
complex to collude on selling over priced houses and write a large # of
Fraudulent loans but where are the arrests??

I'd prefer to see a list where price is emphasized more.
To my mind, value is related to price. Here you have a screen that sorts by S&P
ranking, d/e, roe, and yield. Yield is the only thing that's related to price.
And not too well, imo.

About the yield bogey. It is stated as "Dividend Yield greater than the S&P
500". However, there are two yields for the S&P. The S&P yield for stocks that
pay a dividend (which is 2.2%) and the yield for the S&P based on all component
stocks, whether the companies pay a dividend or not (which results in a 1.65%
yield). I question why use the S&P index this way for somebody looking for
"high quality and dividend yield". Steve Felix's lists of Aristocrats and
Achievers seems to me a better place to look.

If somebody were to be buying any of these stocks in that list, they 1) ought
to be concerned about the price they are paying -- and most of those stocks are
already up near highs, I suspect. (A little more work by the authors on the
screen could have told us); or buyers are 2) unconcerned about stock price
because the intent is to hold for a very long time (e.g. as in Dividends for
Retirement thread). The bar at 2.2% seems very low to me for this.

Oh well.

Something tells me that the best strategy is to buy both units and warrants
because if the warrants are not exercised the units become much more valuable,
but I suspect that the manager will do anything in its power to get the share
price above $12 to encourage the warrants to be exercised thus doubling funds
under management. The only question is what the proportion should be between
units and warrants. I would think that there is some smart mathematician out
there with an answer. Im not smart enough to solve this on my own.

Hello Paul,

Thanks for the back and forth on this topic. This last post you made had me
doing some financial digging over the last few days into an investment I have.
Basically, I own a closed-end fund - CET - which sells at a discount to NAV of
about 17-18% these days. Low admin fees. In general, I like it.

One interesting part of their portfolio is that they have about 30% of their
NAV in an insurance company - Plymouth Rock Assurance. This is a private
insurance company out in the Northeast. From my research, they have about
1,816/share in equity and 281.47 earnings per share.

Now, what was confusing me is that Plymouth Rock seems to get an independent
valuation done, that valued the company at 2,610/share (3,265/share if it was
publicly traded, but 80% of that as a discount because it's private) at the end
of 2009.

When I was initially going back and forth with you, I was alluding in general
to this situation. I was high-level estimating a price/book of 2, when it's
more of a price/book of 1.44 or 1.80 (depending on which valuation is used
above, private discount or public) and a p/e of 9 or 11. Even at a price/book
of 1.44 and a p/e of 9, I don't think you would think this as a tremendous
value compared to your company list below.

That being said, I dug into the situation more and found out that actually, CET
does its own valuation of Plymouth Rock, giving it a current valuation of
around 2,200 a share (p/b 1.21 and p/e 7.82). Since this is the value that's
really in the NAV of CET, I feel much better about this. Especially, when you
count in the fact that it's at a discount of 17-18% putting the p/b at 1 and
p/e at 6.45.

So, for a while I was feeling a bit concerned about my CET position, now I'm
feeling pretty good about it and considering adding to my position at these
levels given that I'd be getting 30% of the NAV in a decent insurance company
at a p/e of 6.45, p/b of 1 as well as getting a 17% discount on another 35% of
NAV in the stocks of A, COHR, BRC, BK, CVG, DOV, INTC, MUR, and DVN. Given that
I'm aiming at the Energy sector these days, this concentrated portfolio at a
17% discount seems decent to me compared to the other valuations out there at
these index levels.

Thanks for the back and forth that led me to research my investment more. It's
tough to be a value investor with stocks so much off their lows. I'm being a
bit creative with this one, but I've held it for a while and am looking to have
a least some position long-term.

Thanks,

Hi cwillyg

RE: Central Securities Corporation (AMEX: CET)

That's a good value find on The Plymouth Rock Company. I like that they have
held it since 1982 (over 28 years) and I bet it generates a lot of cash flow
for the fund. The one big problem with discovering a hidden Gem that holds a
lot of potential value is it takes time for other investors to notice the value
too (sometimes it will never be discovered!).

Looking at their Web site there were only two instances (9/97 & 6/96) were the
NAV of the fund was higher than the Market Price (and only by 0.2%). Over the
17 years of history the NAV was always selling at a discount to the Market
price and at time as much as -20%. The average NAV (over 62 quarters) was a
discount of -13.58% which is only 4% below the Funds average NAV discount for
the last 8 quarters.

I would expect that there is a fair chance for the Fund's NAV to eventually
revert back to their average historical NAV value of -13.58%, so unless they
get a buyer that pays full price for their Plymouth Company holdings, the Fund
is at most selling at a 4% discount to their historical value.

However, if the privately held insurance company "The Plymouth Company" is sold
at something close to their valued market price, there could be a huge windfall
for the Fund share holders. Perhaps as much as $10.00/share-$11.00/share.
That's a nice bogey to have.

<u>Expenses to Income</u>

My only big issue with any of these managed funds are their annual expenses.
You can see this by looking at their total annual expenses to their total
annual investment income. According to their 2009 annual report their total
investment income was $ 10,259,295 from which they had $ 3,880,707 of expenses
(37.83%). They had $397,853,061 of assets under management at the beginning of
the year in 2009. That represents a 1% management fee. When the fund only
earned a total return of 2.6% (net return was only 1.6% after expenses) on
their assets, their management fee seems a bit excessive. Compare this to the
dividend yield for the S&P 500 ETF or index fund for 2009 at 2.11%. The index
beat the net return of the managed fund by 0.5%.

<u>Summary</u>

Therefore, although there are some significantly undervalued assets in the
basket of stocks that the fund holds, unless they are sold to a large buyer,
they generally never get valued at the current market price (only 2 quarters
out of 64 quarters). During this time, management is paying themselves some
very large annual fees to operate the fund (in excess of what it takes to run a
typical index fund). It may be worth buying the fund when it becomes
significantly undervalued to it's historical NAV but just holding the fund long
term may not produce the best overall returns. It just may be better to own an
index fund.

Hello E_K_S,

Thanks for the analysis. I realize that a Closed-End Fund is not something
necessarily normal for the value thread, but I thought I'd throw it out there
since we're not seeing a bunch of crazy values in individual stocks out there.

I appreciate your point about expenses. That's a decent knock against most
Closed-End Funds. I personally think CET is on the low-end of CEF's in regards
to expenses, but maybe I'm wrong. Though, I think 2009 is kind-of a wierd year
to compare Investment Income to expenses due to dividend reductions across the
board at various large companies to conserve cash.

What still has me holding CET is that even with these expenses, the fund looks
to have beaten the S&P on both a NAV and Market Price basis by about 4-5% a
year on a 5, 10, and 20-year basis. With 20/20 rear-view vision, I'd choose
4-5% outperformance over low expenses. I guess my hope is that this performance
continues.

I guess my hope is that Plymouth Rock continues to perform well and that CET
continues to get dividends from it and other companies and pass through cash to
shareholders (averaging about $2/share over the past 10 years or so?). Plymouth
Rock may never be bought out, and I don't expect it to. I'd like the overall
CET discount to NAV to revert to a mean of maybe 13% or higher.

I guess overall, my goal is to try to outperform the S&P by about 5% a year.
Overall, I've been able to do this over the last 10 years (the problem with
this being that the absolute return over that period is not so hot). But, one
thing I've noticed is that as my stocks rise and take profits, I tend to start
'reaching' for valuations as I rotate from profits to new stocks. Then, we
correct, and my new 'value' stocks go down 50% whereas my CEF's decline by
less. So, my strategy is that when I think we've gone up too far too fast and
I'd rather not rotate into new 'values', I'd rather rotate into a good CEF like
this, wait for the correction, and then rotate part of the position back into
better values.

So, that's what I'm looking to do with CET. I've had a position in it for at
least a year or two already, though I've made some buys and sells.

I appreciate your analysis on the last post. Always good to constantly evaluate
current investments.

Thank you,

re Warrant -
>>Here is the question: you own warrants in a closed end fund. the close end
fund has a nav of 15 and a diluted nav of 13.5. it trades at $10.50. the last
date for exercising the warrant is approaching. the warrant allows you to
purchase one unit of the closed end fund for $12 and would then give you a new
warrant that gives you the right to purchase 1/2 unit for $7.50 for two years.
Do you exercise the warrant or not?<<

It seems like a no brainer to exercise the warrant and maybe sell some shares
later. If you sell the warrant (assuming he warrant trades) right away you are
selling in a temporarily depressed market), if you let the warrant expire it's
even worse, you get diluted anyways without the benefit of owning more shares.

re CET - a 17% discount would not be enough to entice me to own a closed end
fund with mediocre management. in addition you need to take into account the
tax liabilities - if the fund were liquidated the gains on sale would be taxed
- most likely would end up with less than the valuation. the only way to solve
this would be to do so would be to find a tax free way to roll over the current
holdings into a new business. With minority holdings that is not feasible, so
you CET would have to pay capital gain taxes. on those.

re Warrant - OK the intrinsic value of the first W1@12$ =-1.5$. The second
warrant W2 is wort: 10.5-7.5$=3$ but you only get 1/2 of W2 for every W1. So
the combined intrinsic value of warrants is really zero right now. The
interesting thing about the 2nd warrant is that it's basically a 2year call
option at a 7.5$ strike price.

I assume you only get an W2 if I choose to exercise W1 (1W2 for 1x W1). I'd say
forget about the stock, buy the W1 and exercise, then sell the exercised stock
after a while while it is not depressed any more after the offering and the
discount to NAV is reduced. Then you basically got a cheap 2 year option for
the stock at a 7.5$ strike.

Instead of dealing with 1 warrant now and 1/2 in future, I double al quantities

Deconstruct this to cost of $3 2x($12 price - $10.50 market value of 1 share)

DTG wasn't meant for me, I guess.
I missed it -- both of them

Hertz at $1+, now a 10bagger. Looked to me as if they were going broke though
at the time. Debt and business travel collapse.

these two highly (DTG, HTZ) leveraged high risk investments have been double
grand slams. I looked at both of these high risk investments and passed back at
the market meltdown. There were to many safer cheap investments at the time.
Unfortunately many of them are only up 100%-150% vs 1000%. I would consider
these cos still high risk.

Commercial prop. reits: Fwiw, closed positions in LXP, FPO.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FPO,LXP&d=s

I like the companies. I don't see though how the companies will increase their
business or their profits to such an extent that the dividend yields - now
about 5% -- will increase significantly in near future. So I also don't see a
decent capital gain from the current stock price.

For div yields, I'd rather continue hold LXP-PD (the preferred) or go for
something else now.

small e&p's: As I've said in earlier posts here, I like these small oil
exploration and production companies that have nav values based on
proven&probable reserves that are higher than current company enterprise value.
Not that that is the proper way to determine under or over valuation, but it is
a key determinant for me.

I continue to build my sector commitment by adding to small positions I already
have, and by buying small amounts of others that I spot. Since there's a lot of
risk with these companies and with oil/gas in general, imo, I figure I'm
somewhat safer by holding a basket of such companies.

Anyway, adding small today to some positions I've had for a while: NPE.v and
NNN.to today, and ATGYF on Friday.

Regarding NNN: Highly positive post by Ed Ajootian in SI today will generate
interest and buys by SI people who follow him into his picks:

took my loss on gs calls and started a small position in the stock. cowen
moving up nicely today now slightly above bv. I like them both at these levels.
But Im prepared to average either up or down on GS. Not often you can buy the
absolute leader in a field for 7.5 x earnings.

SPU. I like the Chinese food/ag stock sector. Some of these companies seem to
have better (lower) p/e's than USA companies. And some seem to have high roe
coupled with low p/e. Almost like growth stocks. Maybe they are. Plenty of
risks with these little companies though.

I've attempted to acquire a small group of Chinese food/ag companies which I
intend to hold for a few years to see which bloom and which fade.

Fwiw: I've had SPU for a month or so. Informative SPU website. SPU and China
are big producers of apple juice. SPU is very big in kiwis, and apparently kiwi
juice (echhh).

Today I started a tracking position in HOGS. I also hold SEED GRO ALN SPU
SIAF.PK YHGG.PK HQS ADY.

The current problem with SPU is its secondary. I don't like dilution and most
Chinese companies dilute like crazy. I usually sell the most egregious ones and
keep the others. I'll think what I am going to do with SPU.

I am not interested in HOGS due to ethical reasons. I'm pretty sure I looked at
the others on your list, but I don't have my notes on this computer - will
comment later when I have them.

Fwiw, SUSS quietly blew through its 200-day SMA today. It's gaining momentum
into earnings. Up almost 16% since this article:

http://www.mysmartrend.com/news-briefs/news-watch/susser-holdings-stands-out-be
t-value-food-retail-industry-suss-gap-ptry-svu-

Those guys at SmartTrend must have quite a following. A lukewarm earnings
report might shake out some of these buyers.
It's still undervalued IMO. My target price is $14-16.

re MBHI - what is the news? Why is the stock going up? I see that the stock
price is up but I don't see any reason justifying it. What tells you that the
bank (or at least the common) is not toast?

Congrats, but i think it's time to sell if you are holding.

Short comments:

SEED - losses, avoid.
GRO - accounting issues in 2008, do you think they fixed all the issues?
ALN - I may take a closer look
SIAF.PK - not current on reporting? avoid.
YHGG.PK - not current reporting. avoid.
HQS - low ROE, skip
ADY - not cheap.

RE: EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD)

o Revenue rose 23.5 percent to $8.48 billion. Analysts expected $8.06 billion.

o DuPont boosted its 2010 earnings outlook to a range of $2.50 to $2.70 per
share, having previously forecast $2.15 to $2.45. Analysts expect $2.39 per
share.

DuPont profit more than doubles; forecast raised
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/DuPont-profit-more-than-rb-1818750234.html?x=0&.v

From the article:"...Sales jumped across the globe for DuPont, including in the
United States, where chemical sales had lagged in 2009. In the Asia Pacific
region, sales increased 71 percent.

DuPont said demand for its photovoltaic and semiconductor materials helped fuel
much of the revenue jump. Sales to the automotive and industrial markets also
increased during the period.

In a surprising move, pretax income from the company's pharmaceutical income
was $60 million higher than expected. Profit from this unit was slowly fading
as DuPont's patent for the heart drug Cozaar expires in stages this year...."

===================================================================

This report bodes well for the overall U.S. recovery and is another data point
that we have turned the corner. Their Asia Pacific sales jumped 71 % and it was
a surprise to see their pharmaceutical income higher too.

Hi JackStraw -
http://www.technologyinvestor.com/
From the Blog report:"...The company’s stock should trade around book value,
Whitney added, which would place the price just above $120. Goldman’s stock
currently trades at 1.26 times book value, according to Thomson Reuters....".
