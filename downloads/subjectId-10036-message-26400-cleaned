Yeah, I think commercial real estate is relatively safe, which is why I expect
semi-recovery in FMT. Will check on FPO. Anything better than 4% is worth
looking at, IMO.

I don't think residential real estate has bottomed yet, but haven't really been
able to gauge how it's doing locally. I live in an area where the only new
houses being built are very upscale, and they're continuing to be built and
sold.

I'm watching out of the corner of my eye for an opportunity to take money out
of equities to get a little more into real estate. All I've got right now is
the land my house is on and some empty lots at a local lake community that was
so successful (so few are) that it actually became an incorporated city. My
expectation is to eventually sell those to baby boomers further along than I
am. I really lucked out on one of them. Corner lot right across from where a
church ended up being built.

I'd been trying to buy a nice 80-acre piece that adjoins my land but the darned
guy sold it last year for the same price I told him 3 years ago I'd give him
and that it was a non-expiring offer. I don't foresee the current owners ever
being motivated to sell it for anything less than a steep profit.

Thought it'd be a great place for a landing strip if I ever got that brave and
affluent, or a bunch of "gentleman farmer" lots that I still wouldn't have to
see from my place.

SI Bob - Followed you in with a starter position on WPL as their dividend is
attractive and with a rising stock market their business should do well. This
company will complement my other bank stocks. Based on their past trading
history, there is price support in the $18-$20 range. Hopefully they can
continue to build their client accounts and management can collect those
management fees (averaged 1.10% of managed portfolios).

I will add a few more shares on any sell off below $10.

Actually, I think Dave brought that one to my attention a while back but we

It can do sub-$10. It did it briefly not too long ago.

I'm really not any kind of chart reader and when I just look at hourly trades

I did receive stock dividends over the years that annualized over 10% per year.

The platinum version is for traders and 1 minute chart users etc, something I

Then, last summer, they cut the dividend by 23%, and the stock dropped 1/3 in

good for their portfolios and their business.

No, I don't have that much confidence that the dividend will hold.

The loss of people at the top (or at the bottom or the middle in such
companies) typically means the loss of at least some of their accounts.

I think the return of the founder will stem the outflow of accounts, but I
can't quantify it beyond "not as bad as it otherwise would've been".

My thinking on this is mostly along the lines that I've already earned one
quarter of dividends on it and have another coming up next month, so my
downside tolerance is pretty high, and especially that even if the dividend
were cut, it could likely still be fairly high.

WPL,

I recall few (if any) stocks that went up on the announcement of a dividend
cut, but I do recall many that went down very significantly. For that reason, I
make it a policy to try to never own stocks into a possible dividend cut.

I may make a mistake and own a few shares of a dividend-cutting dog (HDL as an
example), but then I try to sell immediately on the news, since for smallcap
stocks the first trade is usually the best one.

Founder, Swift Transportation come to terms on buyout
Monday January 22, 2:06 pm ET

The founder of Swift Transportation Co. Inc. is buying back his Phoenix-based
trucking company.
The deal is for $2.74 billion, and it will give former Chief Executive Jerry
Moyes control of the third-largest trucking company in the nation. The current
offer follows a $1.6 billion bid last year that the company rejected.

Moyes founded Swift (NASDAQ:SWFT - News) more than 40 years ago with his father
and brother. His buying group, which includes family members, also will assume
$332 million in debt.

Pending shareholder approval, the deal is expected to close in the spring.

Stock price is up by a few dollars since the announcement, trading just over
$30 per share Monday compared with Friday's close of $27.74.

( a couple of days after the post) until to today. Close enough to a year for
government work. I will use the avg price on March 31, 2006.

The rate of return calculation I use is

<pre><u>Market Value @ end of period - Market Value @ beg of period</u>

Market Value @ beg of period</pre>

or simply<pre><u>
MVend - MVbeg </u>

And the answer is:

W.P. Stewart (WPL) cuts quarterly dividend to $0.15/shr

LOS ANGELES, March 29 (Reuters) - Investment adviser W.P. Stewart & Co. Ltd. on
Thursday cut its quarterly dividend to 15 cents from 23 cents a share, saying
it is moving from the historic pattern of four equal quarterly amounts to a new
policy of paying lower amounts in the first three quarters and a final fourth
payment in January.

The new dividend is payable on April 28 to shareholders of record on April 14.

=================================================================

The current divided rate of $0.15/shr annualized equals a rate of 5.45% at
current prices. The fourth quarter dividend could range from $0.15-$0.47/shr
depending on the previous years total accumulated earnings. The stock should
rally at year end to reflect the anticipated Q4 dividend payout.

It will be interesting to see how this new policy is interpreted by investors.

Hi gcrispin - Regarding WPL - The Q1 outflow (of $325 million) represent about
4.6% of their total assets under management ($7.1 billion). It's small but not
a good trend.

What is interesting however is management expects a long term analyzed
portfolio return of 15% which seems a bit high. If they can deliver this
performance then their clients will be quite happy.

If investors do expect the outflows to continue, then WPL will sell off
further. Management has talked to their larger clients about their performance
expectations so I think any further large outflows will be limited. A lot
depends on how well their future overall portfolio performance is and that they
stay diversified and do not leverage their investments with risky speculations.
Many hedge funds have got into trouble with this type of investment style.

Therefore, the fund managers must be careful not to chase performance returns
but rather stick to good solid investment values. This is one that needs to be
watched closely. If portfolio turnover is high and is on going, that may raise
a red flag to me.

I have a very small starter position which is just enough to keep me interested
to see how things develop.

I've been feeling that a dividend cut was priced in and that it would go up
substantially if the dividend weren't cut, but had been prepared and willing to
hold through a cut. Of pretty much exactly this amount. It looks like the
market nailed the amount of the cut. Took a third out of the value of the
company before the company took the same amount out of the dividend.

I don't think the reverse of "buy the rumor sell the news" works when the
expected news is bad, so I expect some pain short-term. Holding long-term, want
to be in for the 4th quarter provided Q's 1 through 3 don't disappoint and
might get a buying opp. I'm going to work under the (hopefully correct)
assumption the 15 cent dividend will hold (unfortunately, no way to predict Q4
dividend) and base any future buys on dividend yield. I tend to find 6% pretty
tempting and 7% irresistible and it wouldn't have to come down much to get that
kind of yield.

Knee-jerk selling could very well present those kinds of yields short-term.

Could be (dividend-earning) dead money after the next few trading days, though.
There's too much uncertainty around this company for it to easily get bought up
to an effective 5% yield. Before the shakeup at the top, though, the yield hung
out in the upper 5% range for a long time.

Claiborne brand to be tucked too far down amongst all the other LIZ product

If the GE price was much higher it was probably 5-6 years ago, and you have

BDR,

Dropped to 1.85 today on not-a-good-enough earnings announcement after a huge
run-up the day before.

Book value is now up to 3.25 per share from 2.76 per share, which the company
in its ineptitude failed to mention in its press release. Noting the earnings
starting to stabilize (with prospects for improvements due to low-cost Chinese
operations later in the year), it seems worthwhile to hold a position here and
possibly buy more on dips as a long-term value play (don't see any short-term
catalysts, but who knows with thin stocks like these).

Valueminded,

The CEO has been selling stock for several years through a program (I mentioned
this in a prior post in case you care). I'll grant this is a negative, but the
guy is 76 years old and I don't see any pattern of his dumping based on price
as you seem to imply. He has sold at much lower prices and he has sold at much
higher prices, basically wherever the stock traded at the time.

Feel free to pass on the stock, but this is a reason why I am comfortable
owning some. Basically, if one of these below-book dogs becomes profitable, the
stock price can go off to the races. A portfolio of these has served me quite
well in the past, although no guarantees that any one issue will work out, and
you have to have a lot of patience.

ECGI and TAIT are a couple examples that have worked out well for me recently.

It was a little expensive, and I figured maybe the word was out (too late to
buy). So I hesitated. A niche product... how big could it get? Changed my mind
when I saw racks of the stuff show up at Costco couple weeks back. Forgot about
it though. (common apparently at my age)

Problem with being all over the investment space is that I get sidetracked
and/or I forget. In my favor, I don't have to make a decision to kick something
out before I can buy something else, and I don't keep a concentrated portfolio
so I don't need to be as careful with the buy decision as someone who might
only purchase if he/she took 2-5% portfolio bets. Still, nobody likes to lose
money, so I don't want to be cavalier about a purchase either.

These soda/beer/beverage companies can be and have been great performers if
bought right. Don't see much posted on Jones on SI, but it's already been

Fwiw, I'm in the same hem/haw state now with restaurant chain BJRI. Lot of room

has stalled in the past six months. Nevertheless, the stock price is still VERY

thought Q results were excellent, and feel I am taking advantage of selling
pressure due to fear of declining margins. I personally don't think the forward
look was bad enough to merit a buck or so selloff on the stock today. I also
feel, to take a page from Cramer, that BBY is best in breed, CC is a weak
sister, at best. CC's replacing higher salaried employees with lower salaried
ones is totally perplexing and short sighted, as well. BBY adding AAPL products
to its mix is a smart move, additionally.

While I'd normally see this as quite a plus, it really underscores one of the

typically doesn't go anywhere, but when it moves on news in either direction,
it can be dramatic. Which is also why when I recently added a fair chunk to my

American Home Mortgage Expects Reduced Earnings in the First Quarter and Full
Year 2007
Friday April 6, 12:23 pm ET
Market conditions are expected to reduce gain on sale revenues and necessitate
write-downs of low investment grade and residual securities
The Company now sees first quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.40 to $0.60
and full year 2007 earnings per diluted share of $3.75 to $4.25
Common stock dividend policy is changed to $0.70 per share per quarter or $2.80
on an annualized basis

MELVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. (NYSE:
AHM - News) announced today that it expects lower income in the first quarter
and full year 2007 than previously forecasted due to conditions in the
secondary mortgage and mortgage-backed securities markets.

Michael Strauss, American Home's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
commented, "During March, conditions in the secondary mortgage and mortgage
securities markets changed sharply. In particular, these markets were
characterized by far few buyers offering materially lower prices, both for loan
pools and for "AA", "A", "BBB" and residual mortgage securities. These changes
had a significant, adverse impact on our Company's first quarter results,
reducing our gain on sale revenue and causing mark-to- market losses in our
portfolio. While the market may recover, and while we will attempt to restore
our gain on sale margins by raising interest rates charged to consumers, our
working assumption must be that current market conditions will persist and that
our gain on sale margins will not recover through the balance of the year.
Consequently, I am disappointed to report that our Company is lowering its full
year earnings guidance and its dividend policy."

First Quarter Results

The Company's first quarter results will be adversely affected by lower gain on
sale margins. As March progressed, loan pools offered for sale by the Company
received relatively few bids at lower than expected prices. As a result, those
loans originated by the Company in late February and during March earned lower
gain on sale revenues than were anticipated.

The Company's first quarter results will also be adversely affected by
write-downs of its portfolio of low investment grade and residual securities.
In particular, the Company's approximately $484 million of securities rated
"AA", "A" or "BBB" will be written down to account for an unusually large
widening in the first quarter of the spread over LIBOR at which these
securities trade.

Additionally, the Company's first quarter results will be adversely affected by
ongoing high delinquency related charges due to the Company establishing
additional reserves for increases in non-performing loans. While high
delinquency charges were expected, their impact on quarterly results continues
to be significant. A disproportionate share of the Company's non-performing
loans are repurchased Alternate "A" loans. The Company has ceased offering
those types of Alternate "A" loans that have resulted in a high proportion of
its repurchases, and consequently believes the portion of delinquency related
charge resulting from repurchases will diminish toward year-end. While
non-performing loans increased during the quarter, the Company did experience a
decline in early stage delinquencies, with loans in early stage delinquencies
lower at the end of the first quarter than at year-end 2006.

During the first quarter, the Company's loan production was approximately $16.7
billion. Also during the quarter, the Company's net interest income and
mortgage servicing income were near forecast levels.

First Quarter Earnings Guidance

Investors are strongly cautioned that the Company has not yet closed its first
quarter, and its actual financial results for the first quarter are unknown and
difficult to forecast. Given information currently available, the Company
believes its first quarter diluted earnings per share will approximate $0.40 to
$0.60.

Full Year 2007 Earnings Guidance

Due to the Company's first quarter earnings shortfall, and based on the
possibility that current market conditions will continue to prevail for an
extended period, the Company is lowering its full year 2007 earnings guidance
to $3.75 to $4.25 per diluted share. Assumptions underlying the revised
guidance include slightly lower gain on sale margins in the second quarter
compared to the first quarter, and gain on sale margins in the third and fourth
quarters similar to the first quarter. Also underlying the revised guidance are
the absence of further write-downs of low investment grade and residual
securities, and delinquency related charges similar to the first quarter
through the balance of the year, except that repurchase related charges are
projected to diminish slightly in the fourth quarter.

Dividend Policy

Due to the Company's first quarter earnings shortfall and the Company's revised
outlook for the balance of 2007, the Company is lowering its common stock
dividend policy to $0.70 per share per quarter or $2.80 per share on an
annualized basis. The new dividend policy applies to the second quarter 2007
dividend payable in July 2007. Please note, however, that the Company's
dividend policy does not represent an obligation to pay dividends, and that
dividends are only due and payable upon their declaration by the Company's
Board of Directors.

Earnings Release and Conference Call

American Home will announce its first quarter results in a press release that
will be issued before the market opens on Monday, April 30, 2007. The Company
will hold a conference call that same day at 10:30 AM EST to discuss earnings.

Let me count the ways this is not good news for ahm shareholders:
1. release on a day when markets are closed

2. reduced dividend coupled with caution that there is no obligation to pay a
future dividend.

3. first acknowledgement that they need to increase the loss reserve

4. first acknowledgement that they are having problems and having to repurchase
alt-a loans.

5. willingness to predict full year earnings but cautioning against accuracy of
first quarter earnings? I dont know how they can possibly project earnings
going forward.

I dont think any savvy investor is going to try to guess where this one ends
up. I expect a dash for the exits early next week.

Investing is a marathon, not a sprint.

The best buying opportunities historically come when things look the bleakest.

"Buy when there is blood in the street" has worked well for me over the years.

All that being said, It seems likely that AHM will come under selling pressure
Monday.

I do NOT intend to sell into weakness.

The valuation based on PE ,dividend yield & book value is very reasonable.

I would like to see some more insiders step up and buy next week. If they do, I
would consider adding to my position. If not, I will probably hold tight.

Im long at an adjusted avg cost of $22.74.

I bought the stock expecting to own it for several years and nothing has

When a company is on the hook to repurchase loans in excess of their capital,
its not investing, its speculation. No one can attach attach any reliance to
either E or BV at this point and the company is practically saying that in its
release. I agree that investing when things are at their bleakest sounds great
but you have to do so knowing that there usually is some degree of bankruptcy
risk and it helps to be able to quantify that. Things are at their bleakest
when the cpa starts issuing going concern letters, not when the dividend is
reduced to yield over 10%.

I guess thats what makes a market.

There were a lot of folks talking like you are after the 87 crash....the whole
worlds going to hell and so on.

I went heavily on margin and it really jump-started my investing career.

Im nowhere NEAR as bullish as after the 87 crash, and I hold a lot of cash.

I think you are going WAY overboard. There is no "going concern" statement by
their auditors.

There has been no mention of a liquidity crisis.

I dont know exactly when AHM is on the hook to repurchase loans but I do know
that most of their customers have really strong credit built over decades and
most they arent likely to walk away from their houses because the market value
may have dropped 5-10%.

I was also under the impression that they didnt have to buyback loans except
for early defaults or obvious underwriting fraud. (But I wouldnt bet my life on
that)

The director who bought at $30.75 and more at $22.11 also bought MSON at $3.07
in Dec and its doubled. He put a lot more in AHM too.

Do YOU really know more about AHM than a guy who sits on their board and has

I did not talk about any other company and I tend to be fully invested since I
am not a market timer. You were the one who brought up investing when there is
blood in the streets, and I dont believe that there is blood in the street at
this juncture. No I dont claim to know more about the company than the
insiders, however I have personally followed insiders into situations where the
company subsequently went bankrupt, it turned out that although investor
relations denied it to me at the time, the insiders had borrowed money from the
company to purchase stock, and those loans were subsequently forgiven by the
company so I am more skeptical now.

AHM is a financial company as such works with other peoples money. Because of
that it depends on those other peoples trust in order to keep operating.
Loosing this trust (or creditworthiness) for whatever reason right or wrong
means that a financial company cannot operate any more the way it used to.

That's the reason why i do not invest in financial companies in crisis any
more, with the exception that they are too big to fail. I take my chances ten
times more likely with an industrial/retail operation which is way less
imperiled by the perception of it's creditors.

just so that things are a bit more accurate:

- issuing this release on friday in the middle of the day, with a full press
release (not just an 8-K filing) is no different than warning thursday night or
monday morning

- they have said since they first went public, every quarter, without fail,
that until the dividend was officially declared by the board of directors, it
was not an obligation

- they increased their loss reserve in Q4, and said they expected a tough year
in 2007

- they said in at least the last two quarters that they would have increased
repurchases of loans...again, in Q4, they said 2007 would be a challenging
year, and they hoped that repurchases would start to slow down by Q4 of
2007...all they did friday was reiterate that statement

- no doubt that the mortgage business is in flux now, you want them to give you
firm estimates of something that is an unknown?

this is not to say that AHM is by any means a buy...it's just a wish (dream)
that housing/mortgage stocks could be discussed by looking at the FACTS, not
with a bunch of innuendo...i know SI has turned into a wasteland of hyperbole

Buffett buys a train
by Charles Mizrahi

Investors were treated with a surprise on the afternoon of Friday, April 6.
Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought at total of 39 million shares of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe (BNI) for $3.2 billion. Berkshire is the largest single
shareholder of BNI owning 10.9 percent of the shares outstanding.

Some maybe scratching their heads in amazement, thinking it can’t be. A
railroad is a far cry from his other common household name stock holdings like
Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart and Anheuser-Bush. For years Buffett has talked about
buying companies he can understand, that have a sustainable long term
competitive advantage, good management at an attractive price. The common
stocks he bought in the past most often centered around consumer products with
brand names. With his purchase of Burlington Northern, is Buffett swaying from
his circle of competence and changing his stock selection process?

On the surface, a railroad does not seem to fit the Buffett model. However on
closer inspection Burlington Northern fits like a glove in Berkshire’s common
stock portfolio and here’s why.

Understand the Business

Burlington Northern owns one of the largest railroad systems in the U.S. They
have 32,000 miles of track, own 6,300 locomotives and have 220,000 freight
cars. They transport: coal, agriculture products, and intermodal. Not many
moving parts here. Rail is an easy business to understand but not a simple one
to operate–a perfect Buffett combination.

Sustainable Long Term Competitive Advantage

Buffett likes to think about competitive advantage in this way: if he had $10
billion, how could he hurt the company? In fact he said that if he was giving
$100 billion and told to hurt Coca-Cola, he would have to give the money back.
He couldn’t think of a way to harm a company whose brand is so entrenched in
consumer’s minds.

If given $10 billion how would he hurt BNI? I think he came to the conclusion
that he couldn’t. How do you compete with a company that operates 32,000 miles
of track, has been decreasing overhead and has the lowest prices on delivering
low-sulfur coal from the Powder River Basin? As the U.S. turns to alternative
fuel like ethanol, BNI should benefit since they are one of the largest grain
haulers in the U.S. Also, ethanol can’t be transported by traditional pipeline
due to tainting by corrosive waters and other chemicals; rail service is the
only way to go which will increase the company’s bottom line.

In addition Burlington Northern is:

* the largest transporter of aircraft parts by rail in the United States.
* the largest transporter of beer and wine by rail in the United States.
* serves more of the nation's major grain-producing regions than any other
railroad.
* one of the largest grain-hauling railroads in the United States.

Due to their extensive network of tracks, the intermodal business should see an
increase in earnings and revenue. Since BNI operates in the western half of the
U.S, goods delivered to ports in the West Coast (Seattle, WA, Los Angeles and
Long Beach, CA.) can easily be transported via the company’s current track
system. Due to the cost of higher gas prices, traffic congestion and driver
shortages; rail is becoming a cheaper and quicker alternative form of
transporting goods. The average Burlington Northern intermodal train moves the
equivalent of what 220 trucks could move at a rate of 760 miles per day—200
miles more than single-driver truck service. During the peak season between
Thanksgiving and Christmas, Burlington Northern moved more than 50 million
packages for UPS.

Good Management

Matthew Rose has been in the conductor’s seat (as Chairman, President and CEO)
since the end of 2000. Under his management, Rose and his team have been able
to increase shareholder value by:

* Increasing operating margins from 29.7 percent in 2001 to 31 percent in 2006
* Increasing net profit margins from 8.8 percent in 2001 to 13 percent in 2006
* Increasing ROE from 10.4 percent in 2001 to 18 percent in 2006
* Shares outstanding have decreased from 391 million at the end of 2000 to 358
in 2006
* Generated Free Cash Flow of over $1 billion in 2006

Attractive Price

Buffett paid an average of $81.50 per share. While I don’t know what
projections he used to come up with that price, I have been able to come pretty
close in my own calculations of an attractive price. Over the next five years,
based on growth in all three facets of the company’s earnings segments, I
projected Burlington Northern to grow EPS by 12.5 percent per annum which is
lower than most analysts’ five projections of 14 percent. Over the past five
years the stock has been trading at a P/E high of 23 and a low of 11. I used a
conservative P/E of 13, which is closer to the five year low. Based on Buffett
requiring at least a 10 percent ROI, an attractive price to buy the stock would
be between $79-$80 per share, a little lower than his average cost.

Conclusion

Burlington Northern seems to be a play on a theme that Buffett and Munger have
been shifting towards over the past several years–energy. It fits right in the
stock portfolio’s energy holdings with Conoco Phillips and PetroChina. It also
makes sense given Berkshire’s current MidAmerican Energy holdings. If fuel
prices remain high, alternatives like coal and ethanol will certainly rise. The
hauler of choice would be Burlington Northern.
