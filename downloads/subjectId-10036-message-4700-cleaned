Wayne Crimi: The problem I have is that these types of articles are
generalizations because they reference an aggregate model. I guess maybe they
would have to be general because of publishing times and the rapid changes of
stock prices before and after the writing. But to me, that means the article is
useless. What is someone who reads this article now supposed to do? Buy
something? Sell Something? What? Get scared because stocks are high in the
aggregate? Run and Hide?
I have no issue with dividend models. I use one myself. And my model is
actually used by others-- since I usurped it from professional managers who use
it themselves -g--- or report that they do. Further, unlike some PhD who tells
us what life should be like in the stock market, I am HERE right in front of
you telling you what I think a good dividend model predicts and what I myself
am buying based on what my model shows: Like Penney last year @ 46, Cooper Tire
now @ current price, ConAgra @ current price, BOX at current, maybe soon WY.
Not saying I am right or that the model I use is any good, but rather that
these are specific stocks that anyone who believes in a dividend model can at
least put into their own model to see if they agree/disagree. To me this seems
much more helpful than general academic articles which purport to show that
dividends matter and then merely conclude by such analyses, be careful, the
market might be overvalued. JMO, Paul Senior

Featured a few days ago in the WSJ was an Lufkin Industries (LUFK). It pays a
good dividend and earnings are growing at 22% per yr. It yields about 2.2%
which is growing at 4% per yr. Note the yield is above the current mkt average
of 1.3%.

Its PE is low at 10.48. It has several businesses: it makes oil production
equipment, which is depressed now, but its truck trailer unit is picking up the
slack, and then some, but analysis lump it into the oil service sector. So this
may be depressing it. The stock appears to be timely as VectorVest says it has
change 286% from its 50 day moving average. (maybe due to WSJ coverage, last
Wednesday, in the "Texas" journal part of the WSJ.

The stock has risen about 10% over a recent low, but is still a good buy, IMHO.

Gordon, I can add a bit to what Paul said, Inco is the largest producer of
nickle in the world, its gotten itself into a bind with their purchase of
Voisey Bay(Newfoundland), a huge easy to mine(if you take politics out of the
equation) site. With the collapse of nickle prices and the problems at Voisey
they are in a real bind. Im in agreement with Paul about mining companies, most
of them are holes in the ground to pour money into, at least with oil you get a
steady(reasonalbly predictable cash flow), Ive looked at Inco in a very
tentative way a couple of times, if I were to get in I would look much cloer at
2 convertibles, one an Inco debenture and pays (I would guess 10% without
chking) and another from Teck Corp (another large mining compnay) converts
which also convert into Inco. They might both be busted since Inco has dropped
so much..

Company Press Release
International Airline Support Group Reports Record Fourth
Quarter and Year End Results

ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 19, 1998--International Airline Support Group
Inc.
(''IASG'') (AMEX:YLF - news) Wednesday announced results for
the fourth quarter and year ended May 31, 1998.

Total revenues for the fourth quarter rose 53.8% to $9,874,000
from $6,418,000 in the prior year's fourth quarter. Fiscal
1998 fourth quarter net earnings were $2,055,000 versus net
earnings of $881,000 in the fiscal 1997 fourth quarter, an
increase of 133%. For the year ended May 31, 1998, revenues
increased 31.7% to $27,963,000 from fiscal 1997 revenues of
$21,232,000. The company's fiscal 1998 net earnings were a
record $5,563,000, compared to net earnings for fiscal 1997,
prior to the extraordinary loss on the restructuring, of
$2,259,000, an increase of 146%. Net earnings for fiscal
1997, after an extraordinary loss of $531,000 relating to
the restructuring, were $1,728,000.

Commenting, Alexius Dyer III, president and CEO, stated:
''We are extremely pleased with both the top and bottom line
growth that IASG experienced in fiscal 1998. More importantly,
we met several internal goals that should help us sustain
this growth. We added new management who were instrumental
in several aircraft transactions, expansion into the A300
product line, increasing out commuter parts business and
growing our customer base. Financially, IASG dramatically
strengthened its balance sheet. Stockholder equity more than
doubled from $4.7 million in fiscal 1997 to $10.8 million in
fiscal 1998. The company's debt to equity ratio fell below 1
to 1 as we were able to lower outstanding debt from
$13.7 million in fiscal 1997 to $9.6 million in fiscal 1998.''
Dyer concluded: ''The excellent work accomplished in
fiscal 1998 has created a foundation that positions us to
take advantage of the opportunistic challenges that we
foresee in the aviation marketplace. We continue to explore
suitable acquisitions, sizable leasing transactions, and
other means to increase shareholder value.''

I think you would be interested in this one "curve-wise:" OFIS. From its
action, it seems a short-term bottom has been reached. Altho I am no longer
interested in low-price stocks, I did use my investment challenge's "fantacy"
money to buy OFIS. The chance of winning the Yahoo game is alomost zero-
somebody just posted a million percentage gain today! Have you checked out the
E-trade investment game? E-trade is not willing to give out money prizes as

Mike, that Gabelli piece is phenomenal. He is not usually so open about his
firm's technique. I will distribute that to my firm's investment team tomorrow.
I like to think I am good one-on-one with management, but you can always get
better. The best way to do that, I have found, is listen hard to what questions
other people ask and file away their techniques for your own interviews.

And on N (aka Nickel), a lot of value investors have blown this one, so be
careful. It looked cheap at 25, it looked cheap at 20. We are in a period of
commodity deflation, so valuing the assets in the ground may provide no margin
of safety if the commodity price drops further. To say nothing of valuing a
mining company based on historical earnings. That was when commodity prices
were much higher. Before you think of buying INCO because it looks cheap, take
a good long look at Phelps Dodge, Asarco, Freeport (FCX), etc. They all look
cheap, and PD is the class of the industry. You could have invested in INCO in
1960 and still be down. This business destroys wealth systematically.

And USEC has started to run. It is very unusual for a "busted IPO" to bounce
back above the offering price so quickly. Usually these stay down for a long
time, if not forever because the buyers of the IPO are forever disillusioned.

Just my thoughts,

Jim

I really know nothing about OFIS, except that it has a lot of employees.. and
PE ratio is like 2 or 3, etc.. just the Yahoo info. Action of the stock is

OFIS just went through a restructuring, conducting a self-tender for a large
number of shares and selling part of the company to a leveraged buyout firm.

OFIS took on a lot of debt to accomplish this. Pro forma results have not been
reflected in earnings on Yahoo. And the balance sheet numbers have not been
updated. After spending some time on the effects of the restructuring, I think
its more realistic to expect earnings in the $.50 to $1.00 range next year.
Their interest payments are going to be ~$80 million and last years EBITDA was
about $175 million. That doesn't provide enough of a margin of safety for me.

Of course, I say all this without have a seen a 10Q since the restructuring
occurred. I've just looked at the pro forma information in OFIS's 8-K:

TO: James Clarke & Paul Senior re: N

Paul ;

I just threw in the bv bit as a point of beginning, I'm sure what you say is
correct ... " i'm not sure that high book value relative to current price is
the key" .
I can't help but wonder if N doesn't meet the Graham concept of buying "
unpopular large companies" or " the purchase of bargain issues" as laid out in
the Intelligent Investor 4th revised edition( pages 80 - 85.
Graham warns though that neither currently disappointing results nor protracted
neglect or unpopularity if considered alone can be relied upon as a guide to a
successful common stock investment.
He gives examples of similar situations that turned out poorly... ie Anaconda
Wire and Cable (circa 1956).
He suggests that if this type of company is being considered ( for investment)
then the investor should require an indication of at least reasonable stability
of earnings over the past decade (ie no year of earnings deficit)and that the
company be of sufficient size and financial strength to meet possible setbacks
in the future. The ideal combination according to Graham is an enterprise that
is large and prominent and selling both well below its past average price and
its past average price/earnings multiplier.
I think N fits the bill in the majority of these conditions.

James:

Your comments would seem to suggest that historical earnings are of little
significance in this situation. If you accept the premise that the long run
equilibrium price for Nickel is about $3.00 per pound and with Inco slashing
and burning and showing a relatively small loss at current nickel prices, would
you not expect a return to profitability in the medium ( perhaps 2 - 5 years)
term?

%BOM---------------------
Date:8/19/1998 11:35:00 PM
From:James Clarke

I agree with everything you say about INCO, but I still wouldn't buy it. What
we are looking at is a very very (VERY) cheap stock without a catalyst. If you
know something about nickel prices and trends that I don't, by all means, buy
the stock. But when I see a stock that trades at a lower price than it did 30
years ago, I have to think there is something more going on here than commodity
prices. Like I said before, if you want to play commodities, take a look at
Phelps Dodge, which is a very well managed company. I guarantee you, if Nickel
goes up, so will Phelps Dodge. And PD pays a generous dividend (which is not as
rock solid as people think, but even if cut will still be above Nickel's
miserly .9% yield). But at the same time, my Graham angel is whispering to me
that Nickel at 9 could double and still be cheap. Your instinct is absolutely
right that you are looking at perhaps the most unpopular stock on the US
market. VALUE investors are the ones selling now, and these are the Graham
value investors. The value investors who get scared sold it at 15. Trust me, I
know - my firm took this from 23 to 16 and then bailed. Looked really stupid at
the time, but brilliant now. I'm almost talking myself into buying it now.
Probably worth a lot of research. Do I lose credibility as a value investor by
virtually talking myself into something?

then it's a value stock. You got me. I feel -- now that's just a feeling not a
fact-- that you're holding me to THE absolute letter of the Graham law -g-. But
crimini, there are so many other companies out there that have other better
value attributes... like sales/earnings growth, dividend, insider buying,
trading ranges above and below book value (and I don't mean just a couple of
times every 15 years).
I point on your name and you are posting only on mining companies/mineral
companies/Canadian resource companies???? To me, it's not just about 'a' value
stock. It's about a diversified portfolio of value stocks. Perhaps that might
be one of the Graham tenets to which you are not adhering -g-??

But if you are very knowledgeable about such mining/mineral stocks, then of
course, I defer to your expertise (no sarcasm intended)-- there's no way I
would want to bet on my opinion vs. a really knowledgeable investor. (But, on
the other hand, you won't convince me to buy N now either.) And so if and when
N doubles from current price... you are welcome to come back and tell me what a
jerk I was for downplaying it. I just hope I will have had CYM, TIE, others,
and that they performed well also.
Good luck to us all. Paul Senior.

(Note, my intent is not to disparage N and pump the stocks I own. I just don't
think N is worth making a long term multi-year investment in, and I think
that's what it's going to take to realize a profit. (Short term I think N is
down. They all seem to be going down.) JMO, and as I say, I've been wrong many,

INCO: The estimates on Yahoo for N for 99 ran from -.75 to 1.05. Estimates
usually reflect too tight a range due to analyst herd behavior. This indicates
what a crap shoot N is. There are stocks available offering PE's of 9 and below
[Inco's most optimistic] so it's possible to duplicate the best case scenario
with IMO far less risk that is implied by lower estimate outcomes.
Completely agree that this is driven by Nickel prices which are largely
unpredictable - If Russia is a large producer, supplies could soar if they dump
it to get hard currency, or supplies could freeze if Russia collapses.
Disclaimer: I have not researched N in depth and am just offering a not too
terribly informed opinion.

People often ask me why I don't recommend or invest in medical companies. One
of the reasons is that I find the field on the whole very unpredictable. Few
people on this thread take any idea and buy without proper due diligence,
however. And so I am going to recommend that those with the inclination for
discovery take a look at Incyte. Incyte is a biotech company, and it is very
hard to find or define value for such companies, largely due to incredibly
negative cash flow and a reliance on a cheery future. However, Incyte is now
significantly profitable with decent cash flow and low liabilities. It is a
service company that sells info re: genes. IMO, this company can be to medical
research and future therapies what Microsoft is to software. In other words, it
has and will continue to have the info that other companies require to prosper.
There are high barriers to entry in terms of technology, time, and capital
requirement, and the field is narrowed down to really two significant
competitors, Perkin Elmer and Incyte. Incyte IMO has the edge for the long
haul. Recently, the share price has been tanking on the perception that it
overpaid for a recent acquisition. Overpaying for acquisitions is often a sign
of desperation, and Incyte is not desperate. I've been waiting patiently for
the low 20's, and lo and behold this market correction has taken Incyte to that
level. I have not bought yet, but am nearing a buy, and figured I'd throw the
idea out there.

I am aware that this is no single digit PE or asset play, but with
understanding of the business comes a margin of safety at the right price.

And for you Bill Staton fans - make it a point to read between the lines. He
will put companies onto his list (and perhaps, take them off?) retroactively.
For example, check it out the next time he makes a press release about "10 year
performance" of the Staton 100 Index. To be a member of that index, supposedly
the 10 years of higher earnings or dividends is required. Fine - that means
that all members of that index would have to have the 10 years of higher
earnings or dividends prior to being included on the list. Yet he will list
companies as members of that index which were not even in existence for 10
years prior to the period for which he will proclaim the 10 year track record.

Are others having a similar problem? NH is beginning to look very inviting to
me right now, but I am unsure how deeply cyclical the business can become. They
had big losses in the early nineties.

Wallace, I've been the YPF promoter on this board, now down over 10 points from
where I bought it. This is just the whole "avoid foreign stocks" issue.
Telebras, Deswell, New Holland. It doesn't matter the country. If it's not the
US, or even if it is in some cases, then valuation doesn't matter. People just
don't want to be there.

After having a personal-worst 5% down day a few weeks ago, I'm down nearly 5%
today. I haven't bought hardly any new stocks for four months. Many of mine are
down 50% and they keep falling. Every time the market crashes like this, I
check my portfolio to see if for once I am outperforming to the downside, and
so far this year I have yet to do so. Last year I did it only by being up to
50% cash. Today with the market down 3%, I thought, with how beaten down my
stocks are and with a moderately differentiated portfolio of value stocks with
fat yields, I have to be down less than that. Checked my portfolio and instead
I'm down 50% more than the market. Are any value investors having any luck out
there? Is anyone finding a margin of safety that is protecting them. Cash
doesn't really count. I'm just looking for someone with a portfolio of value
stocks that is mostly invested and still is outperforming the market this year
on big down days.

Anyone interested in discussing what a margin of safety is? Value has lost big
the last decade, and in the three real tests (90-91, last fall, and this
summer) value stocks have done much worse than the indexes.

Mike, I personally am feeling the same pain/frustration you are. I've prided
myself in beating the S&P 500 for the last decade. Definitely far from it this
year - I have a list of stocks which have gotten shot. YPF has now round
tripped to my purchase price of about three years ago. My broker's sales
assistant mentioned something about devaluation in Venezuela: I said to him, I
thought we were an Argentinian company?! Have you heard anything about this

My understanding is that the Venezuelan devaluation is a
rumor only. Although I wouldn't be surprised if it's true. That country
probably needs it. In any case, it shouldn't matter for Argentina, maybe a
little for Brazil.

This seems like a good opportunity to rotate for tax loss purposes.
YPF is moving with Latin America and oil. So now I can realize that loss and
move the money into Telebras or another stock that will move up with Latin
America and oil. Commission's cheap, and it repositions me from a tax
perspective without much risk. This can only come about due to the large amount
of parallel values worldwide out there right now, and seems a rare opportunity.
JOE and FLA might be a good example with a loss in JOE or vice versa. I'm
making preparations to wire a 50% cash injection into my account today. I see
an awful lot of opportunity, even though it pains me some to see my supposed
margin of safety fail me.

Thanks for your ideas on FAST. I looked on the Buffett thread but wasn't able

I agree that the growth of 30% plus will probably not continue. However,
depending on the price, I think it can still be a good investment. I bought an

Todays news:

Fastenal Shares Fall on Lower Asian Fastener Prices (Update1) (Adds analyst
beginning 4th paragraph. Updates share price.)

Winona, Minnesota, Aug. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Fastenal Co. shares fell as much as
11 percent on signs the retailer of nuts, bolts and screws won't see relief
anytime soon from a strong U.S. dollar that's causing the price of Asia-made
fasteners to fall.

Fastenal fell 3 1/8 to 34 3/4 in midafternoon trading, after hitting a 52-week
low of 33 5/8 earlier. Shares have declined 39 percent since they hit 56 7/8 on
May 1.

Winona, Minnesota-based Fastenal last month said the price of Asia-made
fasteners had fallen about 20 percent from the year- earlier period as the U.S.
dollar strengthened against Asian currencies. The company had to pass on some
of the lower prices for low-carbon and stainless steel fasteners to its
customers. ''There's not a lot of rocket science involved that Asia will affect
our economy,'' said Barbara Gordon Cohen, a Schroder & Co. analyst who
downgraded Fastenal shares to ''perform in line'' from ''outperform'' today.
''This is purely a macroeconomic call and not an adverse comment on the company
or its business strategy.''

Cohen pared her 1998 earnings estimate from $1.53 a diluted share to $1.49, and
her 1999 estimate from $2.08 to $1.75. The company earned $40.8 million, or
$1.08 a diluted share, on sales of $398 million last year.

In a report today, Cohen questioned Fastenal's contention that it can raise
revenues 26 percent or more, a rate it bases on its 20 percent increase during
the 1991 recession. Achieving 26 percent growth would be ''a challenge'' for
1999, she said. ''In 1991, the company only needed to grow revenues $10 million
to reach 20 percent revenue growth,'' Cohen wrote. ''Today, the company needs
to grow $100 million to realize 20 percent revenue growth and $130 million to
achieve 26 percent growth.''

Fastenal said last month that it had been hurt by lost sales related to the
General Motors Corp. strikes and said that it will open only about 170 stores
this year, less than the 180 it planned. Fastenal had 727 stores and satellites
open at the end of the second quarter.

Mike:

My sympathy on your (and everybody else's) bad luck. It is very frustrating to
have made a sincere effort to intelligently invest and then have it not seem to
matter. But something we should keep in mind is the time scale. It seems to us
that this market behavior has been going on a long time, but when we look back
on it years from now, we will realize it hasn't.

In Dreman's book he points out that after he called the Japanese market a
bubble, it went up another 50%, over a couple of years. But today, seven (?)
years later, it still is below where it was when he made the bubble call. The
two years of going up seems insignificant now, doesn't it?

In a similar vein, we are seeing the market repeatedly make little drops. We
see the bargains appear! But you know what? This can keep going for a very long
time.

I would also be interested in discussing the margin of safety. I'll throw out
some of my opinions for a starting point.

1) The first source of safety we should seek is business safety. This stems
predominantly from qualitative factors, with financial strength as the
predominant quantitative factor.

2) We should be very careful in our use of "value" guidelines. One of the
scariest for me is P/B. Book value is subject to at least as much distortion as
accrual earnings, and it takes more effort to figure out "true" values. Unless
you can work full time on it, I am of the opinion that this one should be
rather avoided. Exception: when book value has a large cash component.

There has been some recent discussion on this thread recently about specialty
metal producers which might seem cheap. Unfortunately, a company bleeding cash
might seem cheap by P/B (or some other measure) but it doesn't change the fact
that it is bleeding cash. Now these companies may be dominant in their field,
but it is not a field with high economic returns. Indeed their stocks may turn
out to be out-performers over some time period, but with companies such as
these, it is really difficult to pick the time period.

Just opinions, just a starting point.

My point exactly...the avg. (not Dow) stock has not been faring well. My
opinion is that we are near a downturn in the economy (the bond market is
telegraphing this, even as there is a "flight to quality"), and the Fed will be
forced to lower Fed Funds at a minimum 25 basis. The Fed has, to a large
degree, been appeased by the bursting of the bubble of asset inflation (read no
more "irrational exuberance"), thus easing by the Fed.
I personally do not see Dow 4500 with interest rates at historic lows...unless
the Fed allows the economy to free fall.

While I generally agree with your view, I believe there are stocks which have
only moderate risk even in that scenario. I think NH at $11 paying 5% is one.
The only reason I did not buy it today is that I think there may appear better
opportunities elsewhere down the road. But if I were an income investor, which
I am not, I would have no problem at all expecting NH to outperform cash or
bonds over a reasonable period of time.

By the way, I am not as pessimistic as you. However, the typical NASDAQ stock
is already down a lot more than the blue chips and in a bear market for far
longer. The lack of any stability there tells me we are nowhere near the
bottom, as I would expect them to get washed out first and start showing some
resilience.

Well, to clarify my thoughts.....

I meant to say if multiples on the Dow go to 12x and earnings there decline by
20%, what does one's portfolio look like.

I use the Dow, not as a proxy for the market, but as a proxy for the largest,
most noticed and generally high quality companies as compared to the thousands
of small public companies.

Before the LBO's hit the market in the 1980's, there were many, many small
(i.e. not huge) companies at PE's of 7x and under - and they had been there for
quite a while. Some had good growth,non-cyclical good balance sheets, good
management, et cetera.

My point is if the market is in the doldrums, valuations can become quite
reasonable such that one would want to buy lots of stocks and the whole
companies, too. But it might take quite some time for the market to recognize
one's acute intelligence. In this thinking, dividends are indeed an attractive
characteristic.

My broader point is - patience is a virtue. One might be well-advised to let
the pendulum swing on back for a while before going whole-heartedly long.

There are some major changes taking place in the world economy and there's a
good chance that all the resultant uncertainties will confound the markets for
some time to come.

For Mike specifically, though, if one has significant outside income which will
almost surely continue for decades, then I should think it's fine to put
everything you've got today into the markets.

Best to all. Be careful out there!

I knew what you meant. My comment was in jest. Just trying to
keep my sense of humor on a day when once again the markets dived
deep and rebounded, pounding my stocks down yet another grand or so.
This repetitive deep dipping and rebounding is killing the non-tech and
non-nifty 15, which collapse with the Dow down 250 but barely move back up when
it rallies to break even. This happens over and over and what do you get. The
Dow has hardly been representative of the broader market. Has there every been
a time when big stocks crashed and small, mid, and ADR's rallied? I don't know.
If not, then I should wait. Should my new criteria be 10% yields and P/FCF of
2-3?
Sounds crazy, but many stocks, especially ADR's, aren't much above that.
Mike

In any case, today INCY hit 20ish, but by the time my money was
cleared it was at 23. I was going to add more NH below eleven but
what do you know it's up on the day. So yeah, I'll buy your patience theory.

I am more than 50% in cash, and raised another 10% today, but what I have in
stocks is outperforming on down days. (Though underperforming on up days). The
reason I think is dividend yields. Half of what I am still holding is in USEC,
yielding 7 1/2% and two REITS yielding 8 and 10%. Also have a large part of my
remaining portfolio in PSO, which is trading below net-net value, has a decent
yield and is not owned by institutions. FWIW, I sold the last of my St. Joe
today.

The problem a lot of value investors are having is that they considered beaten
down cyclicals defensive. I am working on a statistical study for my firm which
I will post when appropriate, but the gist of it is that you're not going to
see a bounce in these until the end of the year. In the '87 crash, already
beaten down cyclicals got murdered even worse than their overvalued
counterparts. Cyclicals have definite seasonality, and going into the fall is
absolutely the worst time of year to own them. I'll develop this further over
the next couple months if anybody is interested.

Yeah, I should have said "except Jim." We knew you were largely cash, and only
owned a few high yielding or net net stocks. I assumed that you have been
beating the market on down days. I am largely invested in cyclicals that have
been beaten down, so I can guess what your study will show. If you count the
cash I took out of the market a few months ago, I guess I did ok (I could say I
was 33% cash and hence my percentage losses were only 2/3 of what I have
sustained). But I had intended to use that to potentially buy a car. Never got
up the guts to do it (couldn't get myself to pay that much for such a
depreciating asset), so now it goes back to the market (which may depreciate
even faster <g>). It means that my account now looks like it's doing a little
better, but it doesn't change the fact that my "fully invested" portfolio
crashed 20% in the last few months.

Mike,

I'm hurting quite a bit, but I am unable to compare to the market since I was
not fully invested going into this year and have been regularly adding money to
my stock account throughout the year. Was down 2.4% today. Deswell is by far my
worst loser, and HIHOF - which I bailed from a month ago - was my 2nd biggest
loser. I am currently down in every stock I currently hold except for ORCL,
which is barely up. (I just started my stock account around Christmas, so I
don't have any long term holdings yet.)

As far as margin of safety goes, I'm trying work relative strength into my
stock picking. Recently read O'Shaugnessy's "What works on Wall Street" and he
found that Relative strength combined with value investing seems to work pretty
well. AAII as well as William O'Neil CANSLIM investors are also big proponent
of buying stocks with good price performance. It does seem that there's
something to momentum, even if it's only a measure of improving market
sentiment for a stock.

Buying into Relative Strength, however, really prohibits us from doing things
like averaging down, or buying beaten down stocks. Some of the stocks with
value/growth characteristics I like which also have decent relative strength
are SRI, DVD, BNE, and perhaps CXP. I don't own any of these yet because I've
tended to buy value stocks that are in the dumps, but as I move out of these I
am going to be more careful about buying the falling knife. I was tempted to
buy NH just a few days ago, but kept telling myself that I've got to quit
buying stocks that are in a downtrend and start listening to Mr. Market who is
telling me something.

A margin of safety to me is starting to mean less about defense and buying a
company at rock bottom prices, and meaning more about buying some offensive
companies with a brighter future - with something to get excited about, even if
that means paying for higher ratios than a typical value investor would prefer.

I'm finding that even solid value stocks, like Deswell, can find a way to go
down 50% if sentiment is against them, so I'm becoming more willing to take a
50% hit in a more growth oriented companies with good prospects. (Not that
Deswell is not growth oriented. It is IMO. I simply would've saved alot if I
would've just not continually averaged down on this stock, which would've meant
paying attention to poor RS.)

Well, I better quit now. Have been typing too long. If anyone has comments on
Relative strength I would love to hear your views.

I think we should first define how we are using "value" stocks in this context.
When companies start to outperform, they become less discounted.

One portfolio, 99.98% invested, is beating the market YTD and on down days.
But...

Please share your secret.

that portfolio is not composed of stocks that I would consider values at the
present. They were purchased with a good margin of safety, but I would go so
far as to call a few of them overvalued now.

This comes back to what I was saying in my last post, about time frames. These
last few months have seemed very hard, but a few months is a very short period.
The important thing IMO is to concentrate funds in companies which you know
will be worth holding for at least a few years, even if their stocks

On Paul's note, I think it was Graham, or it may have been Buffett paraphrasing
Graham who said there are two rules in investing. The first rule is not to lose
your principal. And the second rule is don't forget the first rule. Virtually
everybody today, including value investors and especially insitutional value
investors has forgotten both rules. Institutional value investors are chasing
the index whatever it takes because that is what their clients tell us they
want. I hear the ghost of Ben Graham whispering to me "What are those clients
going to be telling you when you lose 40% of their principal and your only
answer is 'Come on, the S+P is down 42%. I thought you wanted us to try to beat
that'? The moral of this story is that virtually every institutional investor,
including value investors, have forgotten that the S&P can go down. You would
not believe the pressure institutional value investors are under right now to
"perform".

Picking stocks is about finance, accounting and economics...and psychology.
Nobody will ever capture that psychology better than Ben Graham - the market is
a constant battle between fear and greed. Obviously greed has been winning over
the last few years, but all of a sudden it seems we have some fear. Or do we?
Look at Dell and the internet stocks and it seems to me that greed is still
dominant for a large segment of investors. If the gains in the market are
predominantly from insanely valued stocks like Dell, Coke, Microsoft, GE and
the like, is that really relevant to me. If I see the disaster ahead, what do I
care if I am six months early in selling? That is a real danger for
institutional investors, who may get the last laugh, but have no clients left.
But individual investors don't have to play that game, which gives individual
investors a real advantage. (I know of what I speak because I am an
institutional investor who also invests individually.) I'm with Paul. If you
own a company which you are willing to, and will, hold for 5 years that is
virtually certain to make a more than fair return even if the market drops to
normal levels, what are you worried about? Buffett says buy a stock as if there
is no such thing as a stock market - would you be willing to own this business
forever if there were no stock market? But if the reason you're worried is that
you think your stocks are only cheap relative to other stocks, you've got a
problem.

Sorry for the long post. I hope it was worth the length.

Relative strength - I have scoffed at it too, but in this kind of market, the
value stocks with relative strength are the ones that double. The ones with no
relative strength are the falling knives. I have learned that the hard way, and
I don't think I'm the only one. Listen to this - he's right. You all know
that's not how I invest, because I buy tiny or weird stocks. But if you want to
buy anything institutional quality that "looks cheap", Shane's advice will save
you a lot of misery. New Holland (which I am down 40% on) is just one of many
cases in point - if I had been listening to people like Shane I'd still be
drooling on the sidelines over this gem. Maybe it meets the relative strength
test when it has already popped 10% from the current level, but that would have
gotten me in at 13 instead of 19. This is an idea to be explored, not
dismissed. But it is so difficult for value investors (including me) to buy
something going up. If I had waited on New Holland, then it popped 10%, I'd
probably act like an idiot and say "I missed it." That's a mistake I've made so
many times...one of these times I'll learn from it.

Yes, I'm thinking that in the future I will be less afraid of growth stocks as

burn that Deswell or New Holland has put on some of us. And if I had bought
Ciena, then I probably owned MSFT, DELL, CSCO, AMZN, YHOO etc, which have beat

doesn't keep up during the uptrend and gets killed during the downtrend, then

Axel, re: time frames, value investing is not synonymous with long term
investing, and it is not incompatible with tax-loss selling and other
maneuvers, IMO. Value in the Graham sense means buying undervalued and awaiting
fair value. If you get to fair value in a few months, then take it - holding on
longer only further enhances the return-depressing realization of value problem
that your other stocks will experience. So in fact long term holding is the
opposite of what we would like as buyers of undervalued shares. Value in the
Buffett sense - which is what it sounds like you have done - is buying and
holding, which depends on a particular art that he has perfected above everyone
else and involves growth investing. The Graham method is much more accessible
to most of us, and just by its nature, long holding periods for mediocre or
cyclical businesses - the only true Graham values available the last few years
- are counterproductive. So when the Graham type stocks fall 50% in a few
months it really is significant. It makes a long-term investment out of
something we would rather have been a short-term investment, and therefore
depresses overall returns for years into the future.

Beating the market, meaning the S&P, is the only goal, IMO. No matter what you
invest in you are wasting your time if you aren't beating something you can
easily track thoughtlessly with a mutual fund. You can argue risk-adjusted
returns all you want, but if over neither the long haul nor the short haul are
you beating the market, then there is no reason to invest in stocks
individually. This is not a hobby, and it is not a thrill. It is work in
exchange for superior returns. If one proves to oneself that one cannot get
that out of one's work, then one shouldn't be investing in individual stocks.
Value investing isn't a crusade. Just a means to an end. My hypothesis is it is
the best means, but still it's not for everyone (possibly not even me).

Ok, as long as we keep Graham and Buffett separate. If you are buying what you
think is a Buffett company on Graham's criteria, then you're probably in error
on one or both fronts. Mistaking a Graham value for a good company and holding
on too long is as grievous an error as selling just because a stock is down.
The former is apparently too often not recognized out of fear for executing the
latter.

Man, but if you fall for relative strength (past as predictor), then you've got
to give credence to many of the most elementary tools of technical analysis. No
problem for me, but as a strict value guy with interest in the Hyde's and Tejon
Ranches of the world, that's thin ice for you. So the relative strength is
good? Well there's that trend line that was violated so don't buy, and that
suppport you might as well wait for. And those moving averages and MACD. And
hey ADX/DMI is uncannily accurate...don't forget to wait for the breakout on
high volume but it's ok to sell into those 2 years of overhead
resistance.....and what do you know you bought Hyde at 7 and TRC at 35? Jeez,
can't figure out what happened...

The relative strength typically doesn't kick in until the stock has been on the
move for a bit, especially if it has been beaten down or hasn't done anything
for a long time. So it is a trend-following, late indicator. IMO not for deep
value investors, though superficial ones (gee the PSR is low) may want to give
it a try.

Well, and I know this is the Value Investing thread, but you just mentioned
Ciena, which was demolished yesterday. My thought process and questions go like
this (and I suspect it is from a bit of a value/arb perspective). The TLAB
purchase for CIEN was to be, I believe, stock for stock on a 1-1 basis. If the
deal were to go through on that basis (the almost unanimous consensus is it
won't) $60 to CIEN shareholders, with the stock at about 31.
I have heard reports that the deal will go through on revised terms (there
supposedly was another buyer for CIEN out there when the original deal with
TLAB broke). Let's say TLAB retraces to 50 and CIEN shareholders only receive
.75 of a TLAB share - that's 37.50. Anyone following this potential marriage?
On another topic, someone on this thread has mentioned LHO (LaSalle Hotels). I
used to own, and still follow, Winston Hotels (WXH), which is trading at new
all time lows, well below book, and yields 11%+ (now that scares me!). I did
notice there is one Sell reco (not good!) out there which I will delve deeper
into. Any thoughts on this owner of medium priced (primarily Hampton Inn)
hotels?

Mike: re beating the market. I don't see it relevant or important. Objective I
think is to make and keep money because the goal is creation of wealth. What's
the point of beating the market when market is down 15% and individual is down
10%? That's the easy point to see of course because, investor still lost money.
Not so easy to see on upside, but still valid. So what if market is up 15% in a
year and individual is up 11%? The 11% gets one moving to one's goal. After all
this thing of investing is a process--- it's something that's going to be done
for 50 or more years. (That is, investing in all its asset allocation forms--
adjusting bond/stock/real estate/cash/savings components based on
family/lifestyle changes.)

Holding oneself to artificial goals like comparisons to S&P performance or to
others, IMO diverts attention,leads to frustration, and encourages faddish

My point is that it takes a lot of work to read proxies and perform fundamental

efficient use of time. What's the point of spending 300 hours a year to achieve
the returns that you could get with one hour (or less). If index funds didn't
exist, then your point is valid. But with the ease of investing in index funds,
I don't see your point. I believe Graham would have my view if index funds were

Sorry, but I don't understand what you are saying. I have no argument that
index funds are an efficient use of funds -- that is --efficient in that they
require less time than individual stock selection. Also I will give the point
that they have been in general, for most everyone, a higher return provider
than a portfolio selected by individual investors. Being in an index fund I
would think mirrors the market, not beats it. Therefore, anyone going into such
a fund can only beat those many of us who pick our own stocks (including most
fund managers). Which is fine. For me, I'd rather pick my own stocks to reach
my goals. In either case, the goal is not to beat the market. I'm saying having
a stated goal to beat the market is spurious-not relevant for investment
success if one is trying to build financial security. (Unless one is trying to
achieve billionnaire status, or wanting to retire in 5 years but only starting
to invest now with 10k, or has such other extreme goals) Paul.

Paul, I disagree with you and agree with Mike. I believe the goal of
buying individual stocks is precisely to achieve superior RELATIVE returns from
individual stock selection over the practical alternative, index funds (index
funds over mutual funds because they beat most mutual funds, primarily because
of lower expenses). I for one would be quite happy to lose 10% if index funds
were losing 25%.

The cost of individual stock investing is the significant amount of
time required and often a degree of stress that may have long term effects on
one's health, both mental and physical. If there is not a material return in
terms of superior performance or personal enjoyment
as from a hobby then I think it is a bad idea.

It is just one property, but not a bad return.

IMHO, some properties on the REIT's books may be carried significantly below
market or replacement cost. With many REITs selling at close to or below book,
it may be a good time to buy. The interesting thing is that the assets on their
books may be more liquid than many other value plays.

Absolutely. My portfolio is like a barbell - Graham stocks which I will sell at
the first opportunity on one end, and Buffett stocks which I bought well and
will not sell without a very good reason on the other. Its an unusual strategy,
but it works for me because I see no reason to abandon either strategy. Its
just a matter of recognizing immediately which one you are looking at when you
start researching an investment. When I started to look at Penobscot for
example, it is obviously a lousy business. All I care about is valuation. But
if I sense a Buffett type opportunity, it is the business I spend my time on.
Not that you buy it at any price, but my valuation methodology on one of these
is a completely different technique. The difference is that the "Buffett"
company has a target price which will rise 15% every year if I'm right. The
Graham target may be $10 now on a $7 stock, but if it sits there for three
years, the target may still be $10, or $9 or $8. Two very different games, and
like Mike said, value investors get themselves in a lot of trouble when they
mix them up.

And I agree the point is to do better. That's always the point IMO.
But I am saying that if stock market happiness is dependent on beating the
market or beating index funds-- there will mostly be disappointment. Very few
people who call themselves investors can beat the market consistently (by
'investors' I exclude people who worked at MCD or WMT for 20 years and just
bought or took company stock.) Why set yourself up for disappointment when it's
not necessary? When it's about trying to reach goals and using compounding.
Or are we just talking asset allocation here? If someone has a large portfolio
consisting of bonds/stocks/cash/ and within that, stocks amount to say maybe
15% (or say stocks amount to 40 percent, but 25% are in index funds), well then
maybe I could see setting a beat-the-index goal. But in this case, just
reallocating more funds to the market from bonds/cash would seem to me less
heart-wrenching and accomplish the same goal than trying to beat the indexes.
For someone with an 90/10 stock/bond ratio, trying to beat the market is crazy
if one's portfolio is already substantial.

You don't understand? It seems so simple I thought there must be a disconnect

If this is part of what makes one's day worthwhile, then picking stocks in the
face of underperforming the market may make sense - there are then nontangible
benefits to being an individual stock investor. I guess my personal choice
would be to do something else with my time and make at least market returns -
if I knew that all my individual stock picking would not beat the market.

So let me restate: Beating market is the only goal for individual stock pickers
. (this is what I meant in the first place)

Failing that, the goal is matching the market over the long term with next to
zero effort.

All this talk about beating the market. Its getting confused. I don't hear Paul
saying he doesn't care about beating the market. He's just talking about doing
it over a lifetime. And underperforming by 5% in bull markets, but breaking
even in bear markets might do just that. The key to Buffett's long term return
is not outperforming bull markets, although he does that too, its making money
in years the market goes down 30%. Soros has the same kind of record. But the
big difference is that Soros shorts stocks, which makes Buffett that much more
amazing. I think Michael Price said it best in a speech I heard him give at
Columbia. A value investor should not lose sleep about underperforming a
speculative bull market - but he better make damn sure he outperforms big when
the market gives it back.

Trying to "beat the market" over single years (or God forbid, single quarters
as institutional investors must) mean simply that you will be the guy fully
invested at the top, which also virtually guarantees you will be the guy with
no cash to buy at what you know is the bottom. But what Mike said about index
funds should be common sense. If you are not confident that you can outperform
index funds over a lifetime (and many individual investors, especially the ones
making money now, should not be), then call 1-800-VANGUARD.

First let's pretend it's not mildly pathetic that on a Saturday night this
board gets so active <g>. This may explain some of the uncomfortableness with
passive index funds here<G>.

TimbaBear, I remember you from some thread somewhere a long time ago. This one?
Well, in any case, I disagree with the premise that a margin of safety comes
primarily from "if liquidation occured what would we have." Two reasons:

1) Even on value stocks, the liquidation value is often a fraction of the price
paid. In a liquidation, even value investors lose a large part of their
collective shirt. Net nets are one exception, and even most of them aren't
really an exception due to inventory bloat.

2) Value stocks are more likely to undergo liquidation as a group than the S&P
Index. Often these are poor businesses and there is a reason they are trading
just above or near liquidation value. This is my hypothesis, and I have no
proof for this.

That said, I think that the liquidation value is indeed one component of a
margin of safety (and it may even be the first thing to look at), but the rest
comes from time-consuming research that confirms liquidation won't occur and
that the business should be valued much higher for one reason or another, IMO.
This part is an awful lot of art and not much science IMO.

thanks for the O'Shaugnessy link. One thing to watch out for IMO w/ O'Shaug is
that his screening methods, which favor low P/S ratios, are going turn up alot
of low margin companies such as retailers. I noticed a retailer on the list
that I have been watching: Musicland Group MLG.

I enjoyed the conversation on the thread concerning beating the indexes, and I
think that, despite the problems with O'Shaugnessy's approach, it holds out the
"holy grail of investing" - that there are time proven methodologies which
consistently beat the indexes. The most intriguing opportunity to me was
glossed over in the opening chapters of the book - microcaps under 25 million
market cap average returns of 24 or 25% annually. I'm looking into this now,

This is not directed to Mike or Paul, but to the many individual investors I
have listened to in the last couple years. I'm not sure where this is going to
go, but let's try a top ten list. This is a brainstorm - if it turns out
adequately I'll hit the post button.

The top ten reasons you would be better off in an index fund.
10 You own a stock whose 10-K or proxy you haven't read. Or even more, you
don't know what a 10-K or proxy is.
9 You regularly buy stocks your broker pitches to you
8 You expect returns of more than 10% annually over the next 5 years
7 You have a credit card balance as well as an investment in stocks
6 You don't read the Wall Street Journal, Barrons nor IBD
5 You own a stock whose business you don't understand
4 The concepts "accounts receivable", "free cash flow" and "P/E" mean nothing
to you.
3 You own any stock trading at more than 50x normalized earnings
2 You do not spend more than 10 hours researching any stock you put more than
2% of your net worth into
1 Your explanation of why you own any stock includes the phrase "Its gone up"

I am not directing that to most people on this thread, but my point is this.
When you buy a stock, somebody is selling it to you. And when you sell a stock,
somebody is buying it from you. Do you have any reason to believe you know more
than them? I take the train to and from work for an hour every day and
regularly sit next to "investors" who want market advice from me. It boggles my
mind how many of these people have most of their net worth in stocks they
picked themselves who fail most of the above tests, if not all of them. And
then they laugh at me when I tell them I have sold just about everything.

Nobody on this thread or the Buffett thread is claiming they are actually able

I'm new at this (5 1/2 years), and I started to have trouble really since late
96 (only coincidentally <g> just before I started this thread). Part of the
reason I migrated to value investing was that I started to fall behind - the
main reason being I was moving from technical analysis to incorporating
fundamental analysis because it seemed logical, and I was getting devastated
because I didn't know what value was. I also needed something that was less
time consuming for an upcoming busy several years for me. Last year I got lucky
for most of the year, avoided the worst of October, only to crash miserably in
the last two months. Then up 20% for the first Q of 98, now down over 20% since
then. I can't say that I have had enough time or experience to know first hand
that value investing is right for me and that I will or won't be able to beat
the market long-term. I do know that my research leads me to stocks that other
value investors have already found or are finding. So I figure I'm getting some
of the research part down. But rather than experience conquering hope over
time, I would say it is tomfoolery to know with the confidence of years of
experience that you can't beat the market and still not get an index fund -
unless you "enjoy the hunt."

Jim: O'Shaughnessy's method calls for 1 year relative strength - this won't
catch NH or any of the other recent nosedives with just a 10% pop unless they
first build an extended base. If the market collapses then goes thru an
extended base building, I would be fonder of this method.

Since you like REITS and good yield ,consider Alexander Haagen, ACH bond
maturing in January 2001 and yielding about 10 % to very near term maturity. (7
1/2 % coupon) I feel very safe with this because of the large equity to debt
ratio. I recently added to my position at 95.

The market for the last two years has been dominated by Ponzi schemes
masquerading as stocks. If you as a value investor think, as I do, that the
market has been crazily overvalued, I think it is not a useful goal trying to
beat that market in the short run. I think when the big correction occurs, most
of the stocks favored on this thread will fall, but not as much as the
high-fliers. I bought NH at 19, 16, and 12, because I saw value at each level.
I'm not losing sleep over it and the other stocks I've gotten at what I think
are bargain levels. I sure wouldn't trade them for MSFT, INTC, DELL, yahoo,
amazon, etc at this point.

On RUM, if you split the $8 1/2 price into a risk free return price (of about
$7 1/2) and an option price (of about $1), I will bet (without even checking)
that $1 for the 6 year option is a lot cheaper than the implied pricing on
LEAPS on something 25% out of the money.

Another way of looking at it is if the Russell goes up at stocks historic
annual rate of return of about 10% for the next 6 years, you will end up with
about an 8% annual return from RUM, with no risk of worse than a 2.7% return.

<<stocks historic annual rate of return of about 10% >>

There is no such law/rule - it is just a current numeric value, that changes
every few years. Was 7% in 1982.

There is a rule: inflation + dividend return, in the very very long run. That's
for US. In other countries returns were often lower than that.

I agree, but had to pick some number to show how the returns varied between RUM
and Russell.
