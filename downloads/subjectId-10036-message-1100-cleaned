Are analysts' estimates relevant?

Just going to have a little fun .
This isn't intended to be a scientific study.
Very unscientific. One day's data.
Not even a full sample. Not even a complete
(or competent - preselecting data to prove a point?)
analysis.
(But could be okay and enough for me:
got to take a lesson from Mike B --
I am spending too much time indoors.)
Just want to reconfirm for myself
that basing buy/sell decisions on analysts'
recommendations is not a good thing (for me) to do.
I try to avoid even looking at analyst
summary recommendations, and I know I am in trouble
when I start thinking good analysts' earning estimates
are yet another reason to buy,
or bad estimates a reason to stay away.

Just clumping off some stocks from the latest
- yesterday evening - Motley Fool column
(Registered trademarks where appropriate -g-)
"Goats" and then adding Zacks:

Stock & avg & weekly
$ change rating change

EUSA -? 1 1 2 2.3 0
SQNA -1.8 2 1 0 1.7 0
USAD -6.1 1 2 0 1.7 0
APCC -2.9 3 3 0 1.6 -.1
EDS -9.5 5 7 7 2.2 +.1
CSC - 4.8 8 2 6 1.9 0
FRTE -8.3 1 2 0 1.7 0
MAZL -6.6 0 3 0 2.0 0
CBRYA-2.9 2 0 0 1.0 0
MAXM -2.0 4 1 0 1.2 0
DURA -4.5 7 2 1 1.4 -.1

Stock change is absolute dollar as reported by Motley Fool 2/25/97
Rating is three columns: strong buy, moderate buy, hold
(there were no other ratings for these stocks) per Zack's.
Avg is avg rating, with change from prior week.

Reasons for drops - well, we really don't know, but Motley says:
Co. accounting - SQNA
WSJ article (accounting practices) - DURA
Eps announced -down - EDS, CBRYA, MAXM
Sympathy drop - CSC (in sympathy with EDS)
Eps fears in upcoming conf. call - MAZL
(aside: 13D filing for 500k sh. per this week's Barron's)
Eps okay, sales is now issue: APCC
Better than expected EPS but one analyst downgrades - FRTE
(Look at that price drop!
Only 3 analysts but what power!
Maybe Reginald is right -
it isn't about earnings driving prices -g-)

I count 34 "Strong Buy " recommendations.
If you or I made such recommendations on this thread,
and these price drops occurred,
our opinions would be considered contra indicators!

Only 1 analyst downgraded his/her/its
(maybe these analysts are really computer programs -g-)
opinion in the week before these stocks dropped.
An analyst change might've been helpful because it
might have alerted investors to a potential problem
this week (EPS issue and/or drop in stock price).

Be interesting to see if how ratings change
for these particular stocks as of next Fri.
As a value investor, if the value (intrinsic est)
is still the same (or even if it has gone down somewhat),
then I believe the lower prices today
could be better values and there might be more,
or even stronger "strong buy recommendation's .
But no! In the real world, my bet is there will fewer
strong buy recommendations for these next week.

To look at the other side briefly,
here are stocks that went up -per Motley,
with the Zacks numbers:

CNF 3 2 3 2.0 0
ADAC 5 4 1 1.6 0
BEL 8 6 4 1.8 +.4

The overall average doesn't seem much different
from the stocks that went down.
A .4 upgrade (Bell Atlantic) and a very positive price
change seen this week in the stock.
Somebody could actually have bought on the upgrade
and made money. That's one.

Okay, have to pass on to next person
for additional analysis/comments.

Too sunny outside to be inside.

Re: accounting, analysts, talking to management

Paul, thank you for your efforts. The issue of
accounting intrigues me. A lot of stocks (e.g.
AOL, PSFT, etc.) got pushed up thanks to aggressive
accounting practices (capitalizing software R&D and/or
marketing costs). Trying to please Wall Street and
the analysts. And they were pleased. How stupid are
these analysts anyway?

They seem to have the one-time charge concept
understood, as well as the "dump-the-stock-if-
inventory-or-A/R-grows-faster-than-sales" concept.
But how can they be fooled by aggressive accounting?
They ignore it because the stock is moving up. Hence,
"Strong Buy." Expensing everything quarterly at
the expense of short-term EPS does not earn as high
marks, in my unscientific opinion.

This momentum-side bias -- downgrading
(to "hold," of course -- no business to be made in "sell")
at lows and upgrading at highs -- IMO seems to allow
value investors to safely ignore the majority of analysts
except maybe as a contrarian indicator. As I believe
Jeff Maresh mentioned he does, it can pay to look closely at
the Zack's 4's and 5's.

If we are to ignore analysts, though, we likely
need to develop skills in talking to the company.
Does anyone here frequently talk to the management of
the companies in which they invest, and can he/she
give us some pointers on how to do it? Or pointers
on how to either bypass IR or to squeeze the necessary
info out of them?

Good investing,
Mike

I'm an owner of SVGI too, and have some thoughts on the company...

First the good news:
1. Intel is using SVGI's Micrascan II+ for the critical work on their new .25
process. They are currently buying SVGI's steppers heavily

2. SVGI's steppers are still clearly ahead technologically. They are the only
ones actually shipping Step-and-Scan DUV systems

3. Orders in the lithography division have been going gangbusters and they are
going to be limited only by production for some time. They plan a major
increase in production next year...

4. They stated in their last report that track divisions orders finally
stabilized last quarter

5. The thermco division announced a big order last week

6. $9 a share in cash and no debt, this for a company trading under $20...

The bad news...
1. You're right about management

2. They have a history of production problems

3. The track and thermco divisions have been killed, orders and shipments are
way down from last year. This has masked the growth in the lithography
division.

4. Three major competitors, all of which are much bigger than SVGI

The bottom line is this...
IF they stay ahead in the Stepper race...
IF they successfully increase production next year...
IF the market for Semiconductor Equipment recovers next year...
then SVGI is going to rack up truely huge gains.
A lot of IFs though..

<A lot of stocks (e.g. AOL, PSFT, etc.) got pushed up thanks to aggressive
accounting practices (capitalizing software R&D and/or marketing costs). >

How is the capitalization (treatment as an investment in an expense, if the
investment has a positive net ROIC) of these items considered agressive. If
anything,that is how it should be done. These are not expenses, they are
investments. AOL actually cooked the books though. Capitalization is a good
idea, but the EPs figure still has considerable weaknesses which can allow this
to get misconstued. Yet, this happens easily, even without investment
capitalization.

<Expensing everything quarterly at the expense of short-term EPS does not earn

A good analyst without the hidrance of conflicting interests would ignore
accounting earnings and EPS as an accurate measure. It is too heavily
influenced by accrual accounting measures that do not affect actual cash
receipts and disburesments (as well as being very manipulable and not very
telling of a companies actual value).

<If we are to ignore analysts, though, we likely need to develop skills in

It would be unwise to ignore analysts, for they are paid and educated well for
what they do. What you should do is ignore those analysts with a conflict of
interest, for they may have a problem giving straight advice (they don't get
paid by you). Your best bet is to follow the advice of buy side analysts (the
guys who advice institutions (on the institutions pay roll, not the
broker/dealer and paid via a meritocracy). The problem is getting access to
these expensive people as a layman.

The most efficient way to gain access to management is to have a superior
knowledge of that companies financial and strategic situation. Trust me, if you
exhibit such, they will find you.

I look at analysts as a contrary indicator. If they all are on one side of the
fence (buy or "hold"), I would much rather be on the other. If all the analysts
have strong buys on some stock, then any change of opinion can only be
negative. If all the analysts hate a stock, any change can only be positive.

What really surprises me is how little difference of opinion there is among
analysts, even on some pretty unpredictable stocks. If people are buying on
their recommendations (which the price tells you there are), then your odds
have got to be better putting your money on the opposite.

In that sense, analysts are very useful.

Hi All :

I found the following material in "Graham and Doddsville Revisited". Since it
has the phrase "Value Investing" somewhere in the article (readers are
encouraged to search for the said string :-) ), I thought this is relevant to
this group.

Further discussions on this topic would be very welcome.

Thanks

Dipy

Here goes...

----------------------------------BEGIN_EXCERPT---------------------

August 1996 Graham-and-Doddsville Revisited

READER: Just out of curiosity, your opinion of the Dow Dividend strategy
(buy highest yielding Dow stocks each year)? I'm sceptical, despite
historical evidence.

GADR: Michael O'Higgins has written a book entitled Beating the Dow . It's a
lively discussion of the stock market generally, and, particularly, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), including its history and lore. It provides
step by step instructions for outperforming the oldest and most august Index
of them all: The Dow.

O'Higgins: Dow Stocks Provide "Asset Allocation"

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) posits that "asset allocation" is essential to
rationale investment, in order to reduce portfolio volatility. Asset
allocation is dividing an investment portfolio amongst stocks, bonds, and
cash instruments, with diversified holdings within the first two categories.
O'Higgins makes a persuasive case that owning a handful of Dow stocks *is*
asset allocation. As multi-nationals, all of the DJIA stocks provide
international exposure. All of them make direct investments in small caps
and emerging markets. Want to diversify a part of your portfolio into bonds?
American Express and JP Morgan both own high quality bond portfolios. All
Dow stocks have significant holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The sum
total of the products and services sold by Dow companies covers all of the
major growth themes, and more. In other words, a concentrated portfolio of
Dow stocks can still provide a significant degree of diversification and
asset allocation.

(Note well: These same qualities can be found, generally, in what Graham in
Chapter 5 terms "large, prominent, and conservatively financed companies"
(see GADR March '96).)

With the help of the Yale Hirsch Organization, O'Higgins has studied a
number of strategies for chosing a subset of Dow stocks that would
outperform the Dow 30-stock average as a whole. Of these, the one that best
combines long term total returns (5% better than the Dow as a whole,
assuming reinvestment of all dividends), along with low annual turnover
(about 50%), low commissions (an average of 2.5 trades per year), low
volatility, and simplicity of execution, has come to be known as the
"Beating the Dow" strategy.

How To Beat The Dow

All that is required is to buy a newspaper once a year, open it up to the
business section, and buy the 5 Dow stocks with the lowest price from a list
of the the 10 Dow stocks with the highest dividend yield. One year later,
adjust the portfolio according to the foregoing criteria. That's it. We have
taken a look at the Beating the Dow data. It is not an anomaly of the fact
that the Yale Hirsch group began tracking results in 1973. Nor has this
strategy's effectiveness diminished in recent times. We have computed the
results using 1977 as a starting point (thereby removing any outliers
resulting from the abnormal declines in the Bear Market of '73 - '74, and
the abnormal increases in the '75 - '76 recovery). We have also looked at a
number of 5 year time spans along the way. The results are consistent: Over
a 5 year or greater span, this strategy will produce total returns about 5%
greater the Dow average as a whole, and do so with less volatility.

Why It Works

There are, more or less, 20 cylical stocks (companies whose earnings are
closely tied to the overall swings in the economy) in the DJIA. The ones
paying the highest dividend yield, with the lowest price, are those that are
likely to be at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, yet nevertheless
have the financial resources to continue to pay an attractive dividend.
History has shown that a good percentage of such stocks are likely to
recover their earning power, and, therefore, their share price, within a
year. If they haven't left the list in the first year, they often have even
more impressive gains the second. The Beating the Dow strategy combines
elements of technical analysis (cycles will recur), Value investing
(dividends don't lie), dollar cost averaging (trades are made once a year,
regardless of market conditions) and Contrarianism (if it's out of favor,
it's probably a good buy), to come up with a rough but effective way to time
purchases and sales of Dow cylicals.

We like the Beating the Dow strategy. It's a "point-and-shoot-photography"
strategy for neophyte enterprising investors who aren't yet ready for light
meters, f/stops, depth of field, etc. It should be cautioned that its 5%
advantage over the DJIA is a gross return. Commissions and taxes will impact
this strategy to a degree largely avoided by, for example, an S&P 500 Index
fund. Nevertheless, even a 1% or 2% net advantage has significant
consequences for wealth accumulation over the long haul. And, the Yale
Hirsch data (they have identified many long term "pricing anomalies") must
be a source of accute discomfort to all but the most empirically-challenged
adherents of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and Model Portfolio Theory.
Figuratively speaking, by putting on a blindfold once a year, with two pin
holes -- one for price, the other for dividend yield -- anyone can identify
Dow stocks that will outperform the Dow index with an annualized total
return advantage of 5%. Five hundred basis points annually is an
extraordinary long term "pricing discrepancy". If pricing discrepancies of
this magnitude in the components of the most widely known and closely
studied index in the investment universe can be identified this easily, just
how "efficient" (vis-a-vis EMH) could the pricing of the more than 10,000
stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc., that are not part of the DJIA, possibly
be? And, why is it essential to incur the added transaction costs of
diversification (along with guaranteed mediocrity of performance), in order
to avoid volatility (vis-a-vis MPT), if the five Beating the Dow stocks
haved exhibited less volatility than the 30-stock Dow index from which they
were selected?

Dipy,

I discarded SVGI because of their option repricing
decision - they decided to lower prices of already issued
options to July 1996 stock price levels. I consider this
cheating by the management. For details, see SVGI thread month
ago. I don't consider BRKS a buy anymore for the same reason.

This is why I don't buy SVGI, you have to decide
by yourself.

Reginald,

Re: analysts and capitalization of software R&D

When I speak of the analysts, I most definitely
am not talking about the buy-side analysts. I should
have clarified that. What most of us have access
to are Zacks ratings and First Call, both dominated
by sell-side analysts. Those professionals that
disseminate their opinion freely earn my distrust immediately.

Re: capitalization of software R&D rather than expensing
all of it immediately, it seems to me that just about every
software company does this, whereas only a few software
companies actually make it big time. It is an optimistic
approach, but my understanding is that it is a very
tempting tool for aggressive accountants trying to hit
the analysts' mark. In any case, since I'm not an insider,
it is safer for me to assume so.

Hi All :

Sometime back, I have seen posts here, of people getting frustrated with value
investing and getting back to their "regular" investing mode (whatever that
is). Well, here is a website that one should check out :

http://www.coos.or.us/~wbern/ef/bull/riskless.htm

The author discusses the following points :

* How value investing (whether in the small cap or large cap area) has proved
to be a more profitable approach than growth investing (in the corresponding
cap segments)

* Why, during the last 10 years or so, growth investing *appears* to be doing
better than value-oriented approaches.

* How the "tyranny" of the benchmark, i.e. the S&P 500 index, has led to this
strange situation.

* How a lot of mutual fund managers have come under the "tyranny of the
benchmark", and in an effort to save their jobs, are exposing their clients to
the market segment that has the lowest return/risk ratio, i.e. growth
investing.

* Whether this is a situation that can last.

Hope this sparks off some interesting discussions.

Regards

Dipy

Hi Mike: MUEL is a cash cow. PCU is the pits (-g-).

(I just could not stop myself ;-))

Here's what I've found more about these two:

MUEL:
ROE of 11% (1996), which is its high since '91.
Sales creeping up from 75 to 84M ('91-96).
Book has gone from 31 to 34 ('91-96)
psr fairly steady at .5
div. increased in'96 by .10 from $2.00 past years.
(good yield, likely well-protected)

I think this one's fairly valued given flat sales, P/BV, ROE.
Except that ROE is up (don't know why, and 11% isn't so hot), portending good
things in '97 or regress to earlier levels?

(Aside to all, mostly to myself: I am, as always, just another ******* jerk
with an opinion. Even if I am right -g-)

PCU:

Only saw 2 year history available.
Book at $12.7. P/B = 1.4 according to my look up.

(have looked at and passed on Cyprus Amax, large domestic (and int'l) copper
(and gold,etc) producer. Not sure what short term (1yr) outlook is on copper
-down I think. PCU has div. for some downside protection.)

HCIA valuation: thanks Paul

You are quite astute in your analysis and I appreciate your input. I am kind of
new to all this but it seems that the drop in earnings you refer to was
entirely due to onetime charges related to acquisitions. During those quarters
HCIA was profitable before the charges. Last year they made .68 per share
before the charges. IF you use this last quarters earning of .21 cents and
exclude the charges they made about .75, giving a PE in the mid 20's.
Estimates for '98 = $1.27. suggesting a forward PE of 15.
Price to Book = 1
PSR = 2.3
I guess it still looks cheap to me.

Nice call on REAL when it was at 7 3/4! Numbers really (-g- sorry) did look

think I keep wavering between investing strictly by the numbers, and wanting to
also have some sense of (and comfort with) what the business is about. REAL
looked like a small PCBA test equip maker in a competitive, cyclical field.
(That's my excuse anyway, pitiful as it is.)
Price about 10 looks tad high for me here though.

Clarke's pick of the week. Every weekend I'll try to come up with something to
post. If we all do that, we could get a lot of good ideas on this thread. We've
had a few great ones already - personally, I liked WHX the best (to be fair, I
generally ignore tech investments) Obviously, don't trust me or anybody else -
do your own homework.

Last week I posted Tejon Ranch. Thank you to all of you who sent me feedback
privately, and pointed out some important information I did not know. Feel free
to do the same with this one.

Jenny Craig (JC) at 5 5/8. I will admit I made a major unforced error on this
one, buying at what looked like a bottom at 8 1/2 in December. It bounced to 10
1/2 in January, then went into a free fall for no immediately apparent reason -
at least nothing that was not known before January.

The company operates weight-loss centers nationwide. A large portion of their
earnings comes from sale of their special low-calorie food through the centers.
The company had a great year in 1996 (year end June), and if you believe they
can get back to that level of earning power, the stock trades at like 6 or 7
times earnings right now, and about 2-3 times EBITDA. The balance sheet is
pristine.

Last fall, the problems started. Weight loss drugs such as Redux and Phen-Fen
became enormously popular, and Jenny Craig was very conservative about
incorporating these new drugs in its program. As a result, customers went
elsewhere. In December, Jenny rolled out the drugs to most of its centers. If
there are problems beyond this, I have not found them. The whole industry has
been struggling since these drugs came out.

My rationale for owning the stock is this:
1) The stock is dirt cheap if it can return to performance anywhere close to
what it has already achieved.
2) One of the top two brand names in the industry (+ Weight Watchers)
3) The weight loss drugs are not the ultimate solution to obesity. They are not
meant to be taken over the long term, and they pose health risks which make
them inappropriate for the typical Jenny Craig customer - just trying to lose a
few pounds. Jenny Craig's formula is a more traditional, eat less and change
your lifestyle, approach.
4) When the company is hitting on all cylinders it is a cash flow machine with
extremely high return on equity. This is (was?) a "Buffetesque" business with
very little investment required to grow.
5) The company has no debt, so even if the current problem lingers, time is on
my side.
6) The stock is down 40% on me, but I don't see 40% less fat people out there
on the street.

Negatives
1) Little hard asset value
2) The weight loss drugs could be a more serious long-term threat than I think
3) Management has been less than candid in the past. The Craigs gave way to a
new management team in 1995, which put together a very good year, then found
itself back in the doghouse.

A little update on Tejon Ranch. I am "replying" to the original message, so you
can bounce back to that to refresh your memory.

The basic story was that 270,000 acres of land 60 miles from LA can be had for
less than $800 an acre. I was thinking development at $5-10K an acre, but some
people have told me that may be iffy. I'm not convinced of that yet, but don't
think houses are going to spring up tomorrow.

I was perusing the web site of another California land developer, Newhall Land
& Farming (NHL) and found a very interesting land sale. A substantial sale of
undevelopable land went for $10,000 an acre very recently. This is on the Suey
Ranch, probably about 20 or 30 miles south of the Tejon property. The key word
is undevelopable. That, in my view, is the downside unless there was some
special value in that parcel which I don't see. I am looking for some more
feedback from you guys in California. There is a reason why you usually don't
buy real estate over the internet. But if undevelopable farmland in the area is
going for $10,000 an acre, I don't see how I can go wrong in the long term
buying land at $800.

Re: Tejon Ranch

This is the content of my e-mail to James re: TRC --

The Tejon Ranch area is not just an easy 1 hour
north of LA. It is a grueling 1 hr drive, over
a mountainous stretch of road we call the Grapevine.
Underpowered engines slow to a crawl, and there is
a history of a lot of accidents. Then there
is the San Joaquin Valley fog, which can practically
bring things to a standstill. If you're driving from
LA to SF then you can take either 101, which is
coastal, or the 5, which runs through the vast
and empty San Joaquin Valley. The 101
is 1.5 hours longer, but a lot of people take it
just to avoid the Grapevine, especially in foul
weather. So, IMO, this area will not be developed
because there is only farming to the north and
few people would want to commute the Grapevine
to LA. The 101 route is developed all the way up
to Santa Barbara because it is such an easy drive.
I for one would rather live in Ventura and commute
1 1/2 hours down the 101 to LA than live over the
Grapevine.

It is not that this land doesn't have value--
the San Joaquin Valley is one of
the most vital and fertile breadbaskets
of this country. It's why things always
seem to be in season for the western US.
So if the company has the land
on the books at 1930s (Depression-era) prices,
it is exciting to think what
it would be worth now. Also, since real
estate in California is volatile
and cyclical, who knows, during the next
upswing some developer might even think,
"Hey, I'll develop this land because people
would rather commute this Grapevine
than pay 600,000 for a 2 bedroom, 1 1/2 bath,
1000 sq foot pad in LA." This is an intriguing
story, but I just need to confirm.how much people
will pay for the land currently. I also need
to find out exactly where the
boundaries of the land are. I remember seeing
signs "Tejon Ranch" in the
area, but I don't know how far it stretches.

*************
I'd just add that the highest point on the
mountain pass is called Tejon Pass, at
about 3000 feet (LA of course is sea level).
Any disputes with this story are welcome,
since I've been in Nashville the last
four years and my memory ain't always the
best.

I guess one of the things that has lead to some lost interest in this thread on
my part is the apparent preoccupation with the numbers. Obviously the numbers
have to be in the right ball park for a company to be considered a "value
stock". But researching the management team by individual I believe will help
you make better decisions. I'm sorry if this sounds condescending as my
comments are intended to try to help improve the decision making process, and
ultimately personal ROI.

Relative to Jenny Craig, I might be wrong here, but the possible scenario that
has happened might be as follows: The stock falters. Craigs get a new
management team pushing for big improvements. New management come through on
nice "short term" gains but neglects to make strategic decisions which hurt the
company down the road (aka now). If I were you guys, I'd look hard at the new
management. Determine where they came from, what experience they have that can
help the company, and what kind of influence do the Craigs have on management.
You might also want to check the proxies on Edgar to see how much they are paid
and how much stock they own. Are they getting paid big fat salaries or is their
income tied to their performance via stock options? Also, how do their salaries
stack up against their competitors?

Good advice, Jeff. And you're right. Value investors often ignore management
and buy because it "looks cheap". I think you'd agree though that if something
is cheap enough, it could represent a very good investment despite shaky
management. i.e. there is some cost of bad management which I believe the
market often exaggerates. Likewise, there is some price you should pay for good
management, but I think the premium today is often way too high. But that's the
conventional wisdom now being taught in the business schools - buy good
management at any price.

Both. Let's separate buy-side and sell-side analysts. The sell side analysts
create the institutional imperative, but are also influenced by it. Even if
they think the consensus is wrong, it is extremely difficult for them to
deviate from the other analysts. To paraphase Warren Buffett, lemmings as a
group have a bad name, but no individual lemming has ever received bad press.

The sellside dynamic should give value investors a great opportunity, but it is
very difficult to act on it. As a buyside analyst myself, let me tell you it is
hard to invest client's money in something the whole world hates, even though
you know you should. If you're wrong, you don't look stupid if everybody else
was too. I'm not justifying it, and I hope I can avoid doing it myself, but its
a fact of life.

The institutional imperative is extremely powerful, and pervades the industry.
Somehow I don't see Warren Buffett reading Wall Street analyst reports.

<Reginald: How DO we gain access to buy-side analysts? >

The short answer, pay for it. That is how Buffet, Soros, and the big hedge
funds get much of their buy side info. Many of them have analysts on staff, and
some work on contignent profit. If you are in the market for such info, be sure
to look out for potential conflicts of interest, such as revenue derived from
sources outside of pure analytical advice, transaction related subsidaries, and
equity ownership by b/d's. If you use your imagination, you can even consdier
RCM a buy side analyst :-)

I have seen a couple of posts relating to analysts success ratios, or lack
thereof. Analysts happen t be very successful at what they do. the problem is
most retail investors don't have a clue about what they do. Analysts (sell
side) are there to support sales, period. Look at the logic, they serve the
hand that feeds them. They are paid (indirectly thourgh th B/D) by the
institutional clients that require distribution and support of their
securities. They are paid directly by the B/D to support sales in the movement
of inventory. At no time are they paid by the retail investor to do anything,
therefor the old adage applies, "You get what you pay for." Buy side analysts
are paid by people who buy things, hence the difference in approach to
analytics.

<Reginald: How DO we gain access to buy-side analysts? >

I agree with Reginald's analysis of this. You can't get access to buyside
analysis in real time. I am a buyside analyst myself, and I would be
compromising my firm if I posted information on a stock we were buying when we
were buying it.

The best media sources, though flawed, are in my view
Barrons
CNBC
and of course, if you don't read the Wall Street Journal every day, get a
mutual fund.

You see a lot of buyside analyst picks in these media, but you have to be
skeptical. If you are a buyside analyst and you get a shot to speak to the
public, what are you going to pitch? The things you are buying? Hell no, the
last thing you want there is for the price to rise. Or the things you want to
sell if they go up a couple points?

Probably the best source for what buyside analysts think is what they own. For
each of the stocks you are researching, find out who owns them. If Michael
Price or Mario Gabelli owns the stock, you know you are in good company. If
you're looking at a "screaming value investment" that has been out there for a
while and Michael Price, et al, don't show up on the Bloomberg ownership
screen, ask yourself why not. Am I smarter than them? I could have avoided a
lot of mistakes if I had practiced this. That brings up the question - how do I
as an individual investor get access to Bloomberg? Thats a tough one. As a
small investor you have to recognize that you have less access to information
than the big guys, but you also are not under the institutional pressure to do
stupid things that I wrote about in my last post. They may balance each other
out.

Re: buy-side analysts and MPT

Thank you to all with the industry-insider insight.

If anything, this is a strong argument for finding
value among the smaller caps. Price and Gabelli
are somewhat limited re: the size of company
they can invest in, are they not? As are the large
pension funds? Even for shares of large companies,
my understanding is that the big players need
3-5 days either to liquidate a position or to buy in.

But it seems you need some institutional ownership to
provide "go" to the stock when the value is recognized.
I look for between 15 and 40% institutional ownership.
I generally like to know someone with money is watching,
but that there aren't so many that if 5% dump on bad
news the stock is shattered. Any other opinions?

Re: Barron's it seems that if the pro's pick is really

Is anybody else getting hammered on small-mid cap value, or is it just me? I
have a portfolio that is fairly well diversified (12 securities) with only one
large cap. The rest is $100-800 million market cap, value style. I had a great
January and February. I was up about 15% in two months, well above the market.
Through the correction, I held up pretty well. I was still well above zero for
the year when the big indices bottomed. Since then the indices have bounced and
I have been getting annihilated. Is anybody else seeing this, or am I just on a
cold streak?

No matter what you say, I am not selling. I feel in my gut what Buffett says -
I own businesses, not pieces of paper. With one exception, the businesses are
just as strong now as they were two months ago, but the prices are off 20, 30
even 50%. I only wish I had some cash to buy more now.

In my opinion, what we are seeing is a very shallow recovery. A Potemkin

We must be in the same boat (see the water pouring in?). I just finished a
12-day down stretch with a measly $81 gain on Monday. My overall loss has been,
uh, significant (in mid- and small-caps). I'm not selling either.

At least during the drop, my attention has been focused on other matters, like
dealing with a chopped-up left hand (courtesy of my lawn mower and a touch of
inattention). So there are worst things. Typing with one hand really sucks.

I wonder though--if interest in the stock market drops (interest rates up) or

James - My 13-stock portfolio just went negative in the last couple of weeks. I
also have a lot of small caps and a few big caps. Somebody on the COHU thread
(small high-tech) just commented about how rock solid the stock has been. In my
own portfolio, some of the interest rate sensitive rate stuff is getting hit
but the other small caps are not off by much. I have been reading however, that
institutions have been dumping small caps because they want liquidity. Also, I
have been talking to several friends of mine in the past few weeks because they
have been interested in my much-scorned value-investing style. The momentum
folks are off by as much as 40%. Other more conservative (traditional NAIC
types) are off 20% or more. So I feel vindicated.

> I only wish I had some cash to buy more now.

As for more buying, I am being more selective than usual. I have been building
cash but not by selling.

>In my opinion, what we are seeing is a very shallow recovery.

IMHO, the 10% "correction" was meaningless. I don't see any real net effect.
Tech was already in its own bear market before the correction and it continues.
The two-tier market continues. From the historical perspective, looks to me
like a set up for another October crash. Many of the same trends seem to be
falling into place. If interest rates continue to rise (which happened before
past October crashes), it's going to take several quarters to affect earnings.
The big caps continue to beat estimates but eventually they will miss and when
they do, look out below.

Also, does anybody know of a definitive work on circumstances leading up to the
big crashes this century? I've kind of pieced some info together but I still
have a lot of holes that need to be filled in.

Unlike the experts with their conflicting
opinions, the middle-class investor didn't even
have the courage of his convictions; when it came
to the market, he didn't have any convictions. He
was new at this. He didn't have the faintest idea
about whether, or when he should get out. And
what was worse, even when he paid attention the
way he was supposed to, his path became no
clearer. Paying attention taught him that Alan
Greene disagreed with George Soros--but it didn't
teach him who was right. In September of 1987, as
the market dropped forty-six points (2%) one day and
gained seventy-five points (3%) another, as it
ricocheted from 2700 to below 2500 (down 7%) and
then back up to 2600 (up 4%) again, this was not a
pleasant sensation. It was paralyzing...

Jeff, Thought your posts on SGI were excellent. Thought I would solicit
comments on an SGI competitor, Intergraph (INGR). Kind of new to the financial
analysis, so forgive me if I misstate anything.

INGR

Price = 6.5
Book Value = 10
PSR = .36
Distressed = 4 years of losses and flat sales ($1 billion annual)
Market Cap = 310M
Current Assets = 541M
Current Liablities = 280M
LT debt = 40M

Share price at last profitable quarter (12/95) = 18

Intergraph has been transitioning from a proprietary UNIX environment to
Windows NT for the past 4 years. On the hardware side the transition is
complete, with competitively priced workstations and servers, with an emphasis
on high-end 3D workstations that compete with offerings from SGI.

On the software side, NT based mapping, mechanical and drafting applications
are now in the second release cycle, and management has hopes that they will
begin to sell in volume.

Management has been promising that profitability is just a few quarters away
for some time, so the analysts have apparently lost interest in the stock.

Any comments on this stock as a "value" investment? I would assume that there
is value (ie. absence of downside risk), with the main question being if
current management and strategies can return the company to profitability
within the next 3-4 quarters.

Any comments?

you can find if you go to the dossier section and search for Intergraph.

INGR is set up as a number of business units. Although the new workstations are
nice products, they don't comprise a large part of total revenues. But the
Barrons article stated two things I found interesting. One was that the
workstation unit is growing the fastest and was one of the few (if not the
only) profitable business unit. The second was speculation that INGR would "cut
loose" the workstation unit as a separate company to "enhance shareholder
value".

I have growing skepticism of anything NT-based competing with SGI over the long
haul. The supporting data is that NT is growing fast but the graphics side of
SGI is growing faster. By mid-February, they already shipped over 20,000 O2s
which is the new box to compete with NT. I think they were production
constrained. SGI is actually gaining market share. There were several
discussions about this during the recent SGI conference call. Yes, there are a
lot of apps being ported from SGI to NT-based systems with several Pentium Pro
processors. But the entire architecture has two several severe limitations that
will not be solved anytime soon. 1) PC-based architecture and even DEC Alpha
are dreadfully inferior to what SGI has. SGI's busses are over 100 times faster
than PC-based PCI bus. The issue here is that it doesn't matter how fast the
processor is if the bottleneck is how fast data moves between different system
components like memory, CPU, and graphics processors. Pentium Pros on PCI are
kind of like having a huge room full of workers running an assembly line but
there is only a 1-foot by 1-foot door to move product in and out of the room.
For real applications a dual processor Pentium Pro system on PCI/NT is still
slower than the low-end single processor SGI O2 box that sells for $6,000. 2)
NT isn't scalable. It falls apart fast beyond 4 processors.

NT is getting two segments. 1) Low end applications and 2) market segments
where people need to run something more than a dedicated graphics processing
task on the same box. I think the risk on NT graphics companies is quite high.
History is littered with companies that tried to compete with SGI and lost
(Xtar, Division, etc.). And I don't know of a company that has made money on NT
graphics boxes for more than 1 or 2 years. There is also fierce competition and
I don't see anyone that really has a clear advantage for the long-run.

Value investors,

I've got a new Value Investing thread on
my web site. This SI thread is very good, but
if you're interested in another serious value
investing hub away from the momentum-based
Silicon Investor crowd, please stop by:

http://www.sealpoint.com/

The site is on Infoseek and will
soon be on Yahoo, Excite, and several
other search engines, so the people
attracted to the site may be different
than the SI crowd. The key search
words are things like value investing,
Graham, margin of safety, etc. This
will always be a free site with no

that many visitors.

Good investing all,

Suggestions for Tech Stocks On The Value Thread

It appears several on this thread have
been seduced by the "value" in the tech
sector now that so many of the stocks have
been crunched. I'm no exception.

When posting any stock ideas here,
let's try to follow these suggestions:

1) Give at least a brief summary of where
the value is. It is completely ok to ask
the thread's guidance, but give us a reason
to check it out. To avoid rubbing readers
wrong, ticker-tape stuff should be avoided.

2) In tech, many of us have expertise in
a certain area. In that case, even if a
stock doesn't meet the "numbers" required
by many value investors, there might be
value or a margin of safety because of
an overlooked aspect or a temporary stress
by the company. Hence, Jeff's perfectly
appropriate post on SGI. Please share
this expertise if you have it and you
want the thread to take the tech stock
seriously.

Good Investing,

Mike +Everyone Re WHX
Whx has been mentioned as a value play a number of times here, however what I
took a quick look at based on Mikes request was
the convertible securities (sort of discounted value at a discount).
There are 2 convertible preferred paying good dividends, if you were going to
buy the common, I would really look at the conv's since they have good yields
and in these type of situations I can not stress enough you are a CREDITOR not
an owner. With the convert it opens the posibility of also hedging by writing
options or shorting the common.
WHX Corp 6.125
Dividend Price 5/3 Yield Call Price When Premium Conv Ratio
WHX Pr 3.25 33.5 9.70% 52.28 anytime 72.64% 3.168
WHX Pr B 3.75 32.625 11.49% 52.625 Sep-97 117.32% 2.451

Estimated Price based on Stock
WHX 4 6 8 10 12
WHX Pr 30 33.5 37 40 44
WHX Pr B 29 32.625 37 38 40

Benifit to owning Preferred over common
1. Creditor, not owner
2. Pays Regular Dividend
3. Could be called at call price
4. Can write calls
5. Could short shares with protection if share goes up
(E.G. short 50% of the conversion value)
6. Better downside protection

Disadvantage of owning Preferred over Common
1. Common Dividend not received
2. Buy out of company may not offer same value to preferred owners
(Probably do better, no guarentee)
3. % increase in common will not be as large in preferred.

Hi all :

I recommend the book "The Dividend Rich Investor" by Joseph Lisanti and Joseph
Tigue that has been published by S&P recently. I bought the book from the Money
Book Club, of which I am a member (web address: http://www.moneybookclub.com )
and am currently reading it. I think every one of us who is a serious
participant in this thread should read that book.

The book describes how to pick blue-chip stocks that pay dividends and the
various strategies that investors can employ to build a solid portfolio of
stocks that not only pay dividends but also increase them year after year.

There is a section called "free stocks", which lists stocks that, had they been
bought 10 years ago, would have "paid for themselves" (in some cases like
Philip Morris, several times over) during the last 10 years, just by way of
dividends! There are dozens of stocks in that list, almost all of them
blue-chips.

A must-read for any investor who has a long-term outlook, is conservative, and
yet is looking for market-beating returns.

Regards

Dipy.

While on the subject, a good book is the Alcehmy of Finance, by George Soros.
Though difficult reading, it is very insightful and tells the tale (through a
real time experiment) of the folly of those lacking the inability to value
financial assets. His second book, Soros on Soros, simplifies manh of his
notions for those who do not wish to struggle through his (at times) lofty

But doesn't Soros have a rather unsavory reputation for being a crooked guy,
dealing with options, futures, puts, calls, derivatives and other such stuff
(whatever they are!) which are of little use to normal investors anyway? I
thought Soros is in the same or nearly the same category as the "junk bond
king", Milken.

People don't seem to have the same dislike for Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch as
they have for Soros, though they might have disagreements with their styles. As
for me, a few tried and tested (and trustworthy) investors like Buffett and
Lynch are good enough. For technology stocks, I have recently come across

I have never heard of this.

<dealing with options, futures, puts, calls, derivatives and other such stuff
(whatever they are!) which are of little use to normal investors anyway>

According to his book, he says since he got burned by allegedely unsavory
futures traders, he doesn't like futures,and he refueses to pay a premium on an
aoption whose risk/hedge characterics he can build from scratch on cheaper
basis.

For the record, derivates are very useful to investors who are knowledgeable in
their valuation. It is the media that paints them as being a "bad" thing. The
dollar bill was a derivative until the early '70's, did you have any
compunctions against using it? So are mortgages, CD's, mutual funds and car
loans.

<People don't seem to have the same dislike for Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch
as they have for Soros, though they might have disagreements with their

This should be irrelavant in your search for the truth. Soros is disliked for
his ability to manipulate the ignorance of the common investor, it is not his
fault that ignorance exists. Buffet does the same thing, or he would not be
able to beat the market. Soros does seem to have a superiority complex , but
who am I to talk for I suffer from the same malady:-)

For the record and as I remeber it, the Soros, and now Quantum fund, has (had,
I haven't checked for a while) a better track record than Buffet's Berkshire
group on an absolute and risk adjusted basis according to several independant
parties (don't ask me to cite them for I can't remember the sources, you will
have to research that for yourself).

However, from what I remember reading, Soros is said to have gone out of his
way to lay traps for investors and benefited from their mistakes (similar to
what Vinik is alleged to have done by hyping Micron Technology, just before he
left Fidelity Magellan). This is very different from exploiting the normal
mistakes that investors make, like paying too much for a stock during bull
markets and staying away from buying opportunities during bear markets. And
that is what Buffett does. So there is a qualitative difference between the two
guys that might make people detest Soros and admire Buffett.

As individual investors, we might want to fashion ourselves along the lines of
Buffett rather than Soros purely for that reason. (Besides, if I were to hype
up a stock, who would care anyway!).

All this is not to say that I would never read Soros' books. It's only that
they have to wait until I can find nothing else in the library!

Re: Soros his main weakness in terms of PR is his

He is at heart a communist, but got rich manipulating

just knows every nook and cranny where money is
stuffed. A lot of this stuff was before certain
areas were regulated -- hence, in retrospect the
stuff he did may not seem particularly savory.
I have a friend who got rich taking advantage of
the futures markets just before and after regulation
in the mid-late 70's. Can't hold it against him. The
rules weren't there.

Buffett likes to invest in monopolies, and both

This sounds like absolute nonsense. The difference between an amateur investor
and a professional investor (circumventing the technical defintiion that pros
do it for a living) is the ability to value an asset, not formal education nor
credentials. One cannot be fooled, one can only fool oneself by not pursuing
the facts but instead relying on faulty, third party info (such as reporters -
very few of which have made it big in the stock market, which should tell you
something). My advice to you is to heavily discount what you read in magazines
and newspapers. Remember, they make their money primarily from advertising and
subscriptions, not from investing in the markets. A good example is the current
pooh-pooh that the media has instilled in the lay person regrading derivatives,
before that it was high yield bonds, pit bulls and rottweillers (these happen
to be the sweetest dogs :-)), etc., etc.

Hi Paul - Update on Euro-Nevada mining. I'm working on my semi-annual review of
the company this weekend having gathered everything I can find on the company
since the last review. With the stock market "losing its marbles" again on the
upside, the price will probably start to fall again thus creating a buying
opportunity.

There have been several new pieces written about the company. It was on the
front page of The Dines Letter, another report by Gordon Capital, and an
article in The Northern Miner covering Barrick's ribbon cutting at the Meikle
Mine which EN has royalties in. Everything is rosey. Dines Letter recommends it
as a STRONG BUY.

After owning this stock for awhile, I finally found a concise explanation of
this company. From the front page of the Dines Letter:

"A reason these two blue-chips [Euro-Nevada and sister co Franco-Nevada] are so
unknown by most investors is that they represent a brand-new type of industry,
plus they are not listed on the NYSE, where they belong. They are neither
gold-mining companies, nor are they simply lenders. We describe Euro and
Franco-Nevada as "owner-operated, gold-royalty companies," a new industry.
Putting it as simply as possible, EN/FN lends money to a gold miner with a
large property, and gets a percentage of all the gold to be found on that
property in the future! The more gold found, the more EN/FN gets, but the miner
does all the work and investing in the infrastructure of the property! EN/FN is
not merely a lender, but a "percentage partner" with income growing
commensurately with development of the mine. EN/FN does no mining, does not
need a large staff, and takes none of the risks - provided gold is found. What
a sweet position in which to be, truely a royalty."

Another quote:
"What boggles the mind is there are merely 45 people in the entire EN/FN
organization, including engineers, lawyers, geologists and accountants handling
enormous assets with only a few people. Your editor said to him [Chairman
Seymour Schulich], "You're better than a bank in that I don't know of any bank
in the world with over a half-billion dollars and no debt." To which Mr.
Schulich drily replied, "We're not too leveraged." "

The article goes on to say that they expect to make their money in a bear
market. The stock is still "undiscovered." It's a great bear market hedge.

Current scant info is here on the TSE:

http://quotes.telenium.ca/get_corp?EN...T#quote

Get other info directly from Euro-Nevada IR at (416) 480-6480. Their investors
kit is great. Lots of analyst reports, trade pub and newspaper articles.

Ticker symbol is EN on the TSE, or you can find it as EUNMF on this quote

Remember that you have to have a Super Company before you have a Super Stock. I
think the only quality that Apple has going for it is the low PSR. Here are the
problems I have with the company in light of Fisher's book, any ONE would
severely disqualify it as a Super Company:

1. Management is lousy. Among other things, they cooked the books last FY so
Amelio and other top brass could get their bonuses. Top management has been a
revolving door. Bringing Jobs back was merely a nostalgic PR ploy. If
management was really responsible, they would be taking low salaries and most
of their compensation would be tied to stock options. Although Amelio was able
to turn Motorola around, why he has been unsuccessful with Apple can be
attributed to a number of things, none of which are good. They keep on finding
more creative ways to make red ink.

2. They continue to invest in the wrong technology. At every turn in the past
5-6 years they have made bad strategic decisions. IMO they don't understand the
significance of industry standards. Power PC? AppleTalk? Their OS's? They still
don't get it. They do have something unique and they do dominate their market
but the masses don't want what they have.

3. As they continue to lose market share, they continue to lose their life
blood which is software development companies. Why is any company going to
develop software for Apple which is much more costly to develop than for
Windows, and then they have less than 10% of the potential market?

IMO Apple is either going to get taken over or just go bankrupt. Management
continues spurn takeover offers. Compare Apple with computer maker SGI which
IMO is as close as it gets to a Fisher Super Stock and they haven't lost money
pro forma. Still a good buy.

Elamex sounds quite interesting but it's a bit small for my style. Do you know

Hi Mike - In response to your post on SGI:

> SGI announced a reorganization and the resignation of its CFO today:

When McCracken became CEO last year, he made deliberate and strategic moves on
several fronts. They were (are):

1. Reengineer product line to become competitive with Sun and HWP. Start
focusing on the fast growing Unix server market (45%/year) which also includes
internet commerce products. (Internet is growing at 100%+/year) This has been
completed now and initial sales numbers are pretty remarkable. Sun and HWP were
forced to take price action as a result of the new O2 workstation. I don't
recall when this happened before and this during the time of the product cycle
when O2 should be the least price competitive. Modest versions of the new Unix
server products are setting world records in performance and are competitively
priced with Sun and HWP. So he came through here.

2. Convert the corporate mentality from small to large. McCracken comes from
top management at HWP. All of the key people who are leaving I regard as small
company mentality folks. The small company mentality lead to both strategic and
tactical errors over the past few years and seemed to get worse as the company
continued to grow.

3. Kind of a corollary to #2 is that the arrangement of the product lines into
business units. This provides for better efficiency and internal controls and
was necessary for a company as large as SGI. It should have been done a few
years ago.

McCracken has shaken up the organization from top to bottom which was needed if
SGI was going to compete with the big boys in the server market. They recently
stated that they were just installing an integrated Information Management
System to handle everything from sales to manufacturing. The fact that they did
not have such a system in the past is part of the small company mentality that
caused a lot of their problems. The goal here is to better control costs and
more easily manage growth of each product line.

What it comes down to here is "how much faith do I have in McCracken" and my
answer is "a lot". This is based upon studying how he has handled planning and
execution in the past few years.

Hi Mike - Re: SGI, here are a couple of posts that might help fill in some
gaps. I will post some links of interest to this thread periodically that I
believe are relevant to value investors. Also, for the more ambitious, SGI has
its own thread.

I think you are being a bit harsh on PMOR mgmt. and its business model. The
people at Shopko were interested enough to want to merge (albeit the deal fell
through). I do think Mr. Haft is quite competent, his background is certainly
sound. And, I believe that the stock he owns, he owns at considerably higher
prices, so there is motivation to get higher stock prices. The fact that they
compete against "big national chains" should be looked at in the context of my
statement that there has been tremendous consolidation in this industry...and
that PMOR may be a target of consolidation.

Hi all: I am recommending the 5-6/'97 "Bloomberg Personal" mag:

1) Interesting interview with 3 value investors. Discussion of volatility; and
insight into picking value stocks from a statistical prospective (grab a bunch
of 'em) versus company specific process (just what is the value of doing in
depth research on value stocks?).

2) Article entitled "Getting the Inside Scoop" gives tips on becoming your own
investigative reporter. How to find and interview company representatives.
Article lists "50 tough questions from skeptical reporters" such as: "Is this
company's industry facing an overcapacity", "Why is the stock market
overvaluing or undervaluing this company?", "What's the name and phone number
of that gadfly at the annual meeting, and what are the details of his gripes?"
Some of these questions I think will be useful to me in researching a company,
and some useful in addressing management (if I ever do that -g-). I liked the
article because it indicates how business journalists operate and some of the
resources they utilize. The author shows readers how they may utilize these
techniques to ferret out info. and possibly gain insight into competence of
management. The article to me is kind of a counterpoint to earlier posts about
the bias of journalists and their usefulness. Also it seems relative to some of
the on-going discussions we've been having: getting info., getting access,
evaluating management, weighing worth of popular press. JMO, Paul Senior

Any feeling on what should be interpreted as less than favorable news today for

Wallace - You are referring to the fraud investigation of Quantum Health by the
Mexican Govt.? The release stated that the it occured between '92 and '96 which
is prior to it's acquisition by OLS. Quantum did about $286M last year so it
wasn't that big a company.

My knee-jerk reaction is buy the dip!

>Any feeling on what should be interpreted as less than favorable news today
for OLS?

OLS management lead by Frank Ligouri (CEO) is top notch in my book so I doubt
they knowlingly bought a company alledgedly engaged in fraud. They obviously
have to sort things out but I doubt it makes a difference in the long run. Stay
tuned...
