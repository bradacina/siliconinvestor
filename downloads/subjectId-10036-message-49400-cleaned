Hi EKS. There is an interesting reaction to a first time Alpha writer's
contribution. He chose PSEC as his subject and reveals that he does not like
BDC's as an investment vehicle.

49 comments already and the article was posted today.

Grommit, sorry for your brokerage troubles. Within an ira, if you sell a stock
and buy another stock, but 1) there wasn't enough cash already in the account
to pay for the new buy, and 2) the stock you sold didn't yet settle (settlement
usually being on the 3rd day after the trade), then according to the fed's, you
have bought that other stock on margin. Has happened to me. As I recall, the
broker allowed the trade (allowed the sale and allowed the new buy), but I got
a warning letter. Couple/three of those letters within a year, and I get my
trades restricted.

Maybe that has something to do with what's happening when you switched from A's
to B's???

Situation very strange and unusual, I agree.

OT In this case it is like they are voiding the sell. I have had IRA accounts
restricted for 90 days because i sold something before it settled (I screwed
up), but this is different. I sold this stock before they even announced a
partial redemption. Normally etrade changes the stock symbol to make it

The September Yield Screen

The September Dividend Screen, which highlights the yields and ex-dates for
every dividend paying stock in the Russell 3,000. From the report, we pulled
the highest yielding S&P 500 stocks going ex-dividend over the next month and
ran them through our popular trading range screen, which allows you to quickly
analyze each stock's recent momentum and overbought/oversold levels.

Windstream (WIN) is the highest yielding S&P 500 stock going ex over the next
month at 9.35%, followed by Verizon (VZ), Safeway (SWY) and DTE Energy (DTE).
Other notables on the list include Philip Morris Intl (PM), Staples (SPLS),
Merck (MRK), General Electric (GE), Dell (DELL), Cisco (CSCO) and Deere (DE).

Windstream is the highest yielder on the list, but it's also the most
overbought at the moment, so an entry at these levels is not favorable. Stocks
that may be worth taking a look at are the ones trading in neutral or oversold
territory that have seen upside momentum over the last week.

This is completely off topic but I would appreciate your comments. for years i
have been taking my 2002 hundai to a repair place thats' 5 minutes from my
house. the place run by an older man and his wife. are friendly and try to
accomodate me whenever possible. Now about a month ago my check light comes on
and after a couple of days i take it in for them to take a look at it. they
tell me they didnt find anything but the replaced the gas cap and charged me
$100 which i cheerfully paid. two weeks later the check engine light comes on
again and i make an appoint but a couple of days later it disappears so i
cancel the appointment. A week later the check light comes on again and so i go
back to the repar place. Now they tell me that the diagonistics revealed that a
cylinder is misfiring, and they want to do a tune up and replace the spark
plugs. i say fine. after a few hours they tell me the car is ready . when i go
to pick it up the engine is idling and sounding a lot worse than when i brought
it in. I mention it to the owner and he tells me that i left the spark plugs in
too long and that put in a a heavy duty fuel injection cleaner and that i
should drive the car around for a few days and if it doesnt improve i should
bring it back in as they may not have gotten to the bottom of all the problems.
I pay another $300 or so. when i leave the garage the check light is off but it
comes back on the next time i leave the house with the car.

the car continues to sound terrible while idling but a lot better when i drive
it so i drive it for about 5 days but the check light stays on . I have a
friend listen to the car and he says it sounds like a gasket in the manifold
problem, I take it to a different mechanic the following day. i park it outside
and he drives it into his garage. he comes out and tells me he cant believe any
mechanic would have release the car to me in that shape. then he comes back
five minutes later and calls me into the garage. tells me that without running
diagonsitics he know what the problem is. he shows me that there is a gasket
missing from the manifold tells me that i should have not have driven the car
and shold not drive the car because i risk damaging the catalytic converter. He
also says he cant believe that the other guy didnt recognize the problem right
away.
He suggested that i might want to go back to the neighborhood place and tell
them what the problem was . that they might apologize and fix it for free. but
given what he has told me I dont want to move the car and am now questioning
their general competency. Now I wonder if its possible that they somehow damage
or lost the gasket while they were working on the car before and didnt notice
what they had done. or whether they were just so oblivious in their work that
they missed what appears to be a pretty obvious problem.

After thinking about it, without any input from etrade to explain what
happened, here is my guess. Normally a redemption is 100% and they give a date
in the future. Then trades are halted for a few days until things are sorted
out and they add a .CL to the stock symbol. But in CDR's 9-11 press release,
they give no redemption date but say that documents are going out immediately.
??? see below.

Press after the close on sept 11: "The notice of redemption and related
materials will be mailed to the registered holders of Series A Preferred Stock
on or about September 11, 2012."

Even though I sold on 9-11, I am still the register owner until settlement. I
would have thought that if the redemption was "immediate," that they really
could not do it for 3 days, and that they would at least have to notify
Etrade/SEC (or whoever) and trades would be halted for a few days to allow
settlements of trades already made. I don't know.

Etrade reversed the trades in my IRAs for the % being redeemed (i.e. bought
shares back at exactly the same price as I sold them earlier). And those
accounts have negative cash balances now. They are not margin accounts. They
did this because they said that they could not force us to buy shares in an IRA
that had no funds. And in taxable accounts they bought back shares at the
market and the cash balances are lower in those accounts as well. It looks like
shares will stay in the accounts until redemption date, whenever that is. They
said they will reimburse all margin charges, price changes to re-buy, and any
fees. So I think we have free funds in the IRAs until redemption. Thanks.

Also strangely... Etrade said their margin dept would re-buy the shares but
they would rather that we authorized it in each account. I asked "why? what's
the difference?" They said the margin dept charges $45 when they do it. I said
"who cares? you are going to reimburse me anyway?" TMI... but they still wanted
to make the trades before the margin dept got involved.

If this guess is true, then it is not etrade's fault. CDR may have slipped a
problem in under the radar. But no one will tell me the cause of the mess. The
account rep at etrade told me that he's never seen anything like this happen
before.

AAB.TO

I wholeheartedly agree with Madharry and have been increasing my exposure to
AAB.to, despite it being a value trap to this point.

See the latest press release from the company. Sulliden and Bridgeport are both
extremely positive for the company, plus announced going-public transactions
for several private holdings, plus QE3 and gold's rally should be helping the
other stuff. Basically, the stock is trading at 52 week low, while its holdings
are ripping up.

The worse case is a Dacha merger goes through, where there is 17% merger arb
premium. More likely, the deal is restructured and cancelled, which is even
better.

Junior mining is a very risky, so I still call this speculative, but I think a
good bet at these levels.

OT -- E*trade -- I am not sure who is at fault, but after my initial
frustration, etrade handled everything 100%. They credited my accounts for a
more than any transaction costs, and I came out better than whole. I earn
interest on the CDR-As that I now re-own (until redeemed), and pay no margin on
any accounts that went cash negative. No complaints now, except for the time it
took to sort it all out.

There were two issues. Shares of CDR-B were issued (under par) before the press
release, and CDR-A shares were being called before having a chance for existing
trades to settle -- this occurred before the press release and before trading
was halted.

One more AAB.TO update,

The stock has rallied a bit from 0.355 opening this morning to 0.38 CAD . Seems
small but that is 7%. I still really like the stock, but the merger-arb
valuation has tightened (about 10% now -- 0.8 * 0.52= 0.416).

Although it was a short time window, I hope you realize that Madharry and I
posted while the stock was at its cheapest -- it traded 0.355 and a lot of size
at 0.36 this morning.

One of the pet peeves of mine is that some folks only post the ideas after the
stock has gone up a bunch, which is a little frustrating, but still
understandable given that they should have first right to buy at the cheapest
levels.

Myself, I am greedy too, but still try to give a heads up when I think the
levels are the most attractive.

has a significant and very profitable business, so any backslash may really
hurt. When the market is liquidity driven, like it is the case now, it

DJ AT&T CFO Sees Quick Sales of iPhone, 3Q Financial Impact

By Thomas Gryta

AT&T Inc. (T) expects a rush of initial sales of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iPhone 5,
noting that the previous generation of the phone sold 1 million units for use
on AT&T's network in the first five days.

The telecom giant, once the exclusive provider of the popular smartphone, has
held the lead in quarterly iPhone unit sales despite Verizon Wireless and
Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) entering the market. <span style='color:

of dollars for contract customers, bringing a short-term hit to profits when

OT Etrade. A new chapter for those following the story. Some IRA's have a
negative cash balance because they forced a re buy of shares that will be
redeemed.... Etrade cannot let our IRA cash balances be negative due to
compliance issues. So they are going to put cash into the IRAs to bring them to
zero. They are doing this by prepaying the redemption that will occur on Oct
11. This just goes to show that whoever screwed up is paying the price for this

aab.to I wouldnt have given that heads up but its about 7.5% of my portfolio so
I personally wasnt adding more anyway. hopefully someone on si benefitted and
will benefit from such a cheap price. I have not encountered anyone but you so
far mcsweet who would even consider voting for this merger proposition. I
suspect that the current nav is around $.95 and prices for junior miners are
still very depressed. meanwhile the dividend is over 5%. I would also point out
that on september 1 i posted that the silver uptrend i suspected had been
confirmed by my technical analysis. People who acted on that have done very
well in the past two weeks. I contininue to hold all of my slw, axu , anv,
aab.to, cmp-un.to , and egd.v a driller and part owner of a silver mine through
its 10% ownership of impact silver. in the gold space i have held on to my
dgc.to and my speculative shares in pelangio px.v,. In the oils i own cnq su
and mhr. this week i took positions in kft, ms, and gnw. MIL is far and away my
biggest position. I look at that as having given a good chunk of my portfolio
for mr smith to invest. so far I think he has done a great job. if he can build
book at a 14% clip or better over a number of years i will be very happy to
hold shares for a very long time. as value investors we have to be patient.
another company whose management i like and who has been very successful is
als.to. even though the share prices has not performed very well over the past
two years. I believe i have already mentioned almost all of these companies
here many times but i continue to own them. fwiw. i bought kft because of the
plans to split into two companies. ms and gnw because they are cheap and the
fed move will help them both. I dont know how long i will hold on to all the

in time and have no obligation to disclose any subsequent buys or sells. good

NWLI/ANAT: Ha,ha. I see him in his job possibly outliving me... outliving my
patience anyway. I was reluctant to say if Mr Moody Sr "dies", because I felt
it would put me in the churlish position of seeming to hold the stock only
waiting for the guy to die so the stock might pop on the news.

Maybe instead of using "retiring" (for "dying"), I should just have said it
this way: "the stock would perhaps do better if there was ever news of a new
ceo appointment."

Granted the Moody family controls. There may be more options for the family and
the minority stockholders if there's new or different (more vigorous?)
management team in place though. Who knows?

Meanwhile, NWLI stated book value continues to increase. Price/bv seems to be
at lows now.
Stated bv for ANAT seems to have fluctuated more over past few years -- it's
apparently rising now. Again though, like some other insurance companies,
p/stated bv seems to be at lows.

Hi FIFO_kid2 -

Re:Omega Protein Corp. (NYSE: OME)

I really do not know any of the specifics regarding OME contracts, but that
price arrangement will eventually end. I am bullish on all commodities
especially food and OME as you state produces a lot of fish meal which is used
extensively in growing farm raised salmon. OME also owns an efficient
production facility for producing fish oil. This is a high margin business and
not impacted too much by the price of the inputs. As they develop their
distribution channels, I see this division providing a steady consistent cash
flow to their operation.

You will notice that their per share cash flow increased substantially after
their acquisition of http://goo.gl/RSGXc . This division and other JV partners
help process and distribute their fish oil tablets

FWIW, I am also upping my position in Marine Harvest ASA (MNHVF) as I feel
their long term production will be higher as they bring their new fingerlings
into production (usually a 30 month cycle to harvest). Here fish meal is an
important input to the production of healthy and quality fish. I may have
missed the bottom as the stock is already up 100% from the low in 12/2011. Once
the new production is available for sale and distribution, I expect salmon
prices to be higher (remember pork & chicken prices will be much higher due to
the poor corn harvest) and the stock could run back to $1.20/share (that's a
50% gain from current levels...last $0.83/share).

The premise for my investment in fish, fish meal and fish oil is that chicken,
pork and beef will all be much higher in price due to the poor corn harvest in
the U.S. and Canada. Overall demand should be greater for fish (a substitute
for the other animal proteins) absorbing the previous over supply of farmed
raised salmon that has held prices down in 2010 and 2011.

EKS I sold my OME immediately after the earnings report jump which I didn't
understand the initial rise in the stock given the negative pricing effect from
contract sales but am looking for a point to get back in again. It is just a
matter of timing for me. The price of the stock is certainly off from various
short term reasons. Honestly, I was looking for a blowout number from the
higher volume and commodity price rise as a catalyst and pricing didn't
cooperate. I thought their commodity part of the business would have better
pricing power. Fish meal prices are up by huge percentages year to date but
those prices have not been reflected in unit sales prices. I am trying to look
for an external sign that now is the time. I think the stock price is an easy
double if they can implement pricing at the same percentage of the commodity
price rise.

Re: INTC, I don't profess to know a whole lot about it...I began to get
attracted by it due to their dividend growth...but if you take pc sales for
example, the trend (according to Gartner anyway) has been going down in the
past 2 years, so pc makers such as HPQ or DELL have definitely suffered...and
this has carried along with it INTC...but similar to MSFT, INTC's processors
are everywhere! I think the forecast for pc sales for 2012 is something like
300 million, and if INTC can maintain their market share of roughly 80% of pc
processors, they can still milk it very well...at least for the next few years

But there is no denying that if they continue down the same path, they will
suffer a death by a thousand cuts, being inflicted ever so slowly. I understand
that they managed to corner the pc market when it was just starting out in the
1980s...so if they want to maintain the profitability of their business as a
whole, a fraction of that previous innovation would propel them forward...

INTC is definitely still a great business and I would hesitate to buy this

"hyundai for example...really wished I'd own this stock"

I looked closer now because I have posted in past how difficult it was for me
to actually buy any Hyundai -- it didn't trade -- or rarely
traded(http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HYMLF) -- on the pink sheets. (And buying
anything on the Korean market I found to be too tough --- brokerage
fees/middleman fees/exchange fees make small buys not worth it.)

Turns out I appear to be wrong --- I don't know how I missed it, but the
company shares seemingly can be bought as HYMTF. Thinly-traded, but available,
according to Yahoo:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=HYMTF+Historical+Prices

------------
Korean companies seem to me to dominate the USA in so many sectors. Perhaps
it's combo of government trade policies, Korean mindset to "buy Korean", their
focus, education, bribery/ business practices, infrastructure, conglomerations
- whatever -- but they seem to be decimating the USA in many sectors.

I am holding a few shares of EWY. I bought it because it was the only way I
could figure to buy some Hyundai. Also get Kia, Samsung, LG in appliances. (Of
course, also get, typically, some companies I don't know about or would prefer
not to own, e.g. steel manufacturer Posco).

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hl?s=EWY+Holdings

----------
If I could find and understand what Hyundai's p/e, balance sheet look like, I
might be more enthusiastic about buying the stock. Especially if the p/e were
to be as low as for GM or F. As it is, I'm becoming more concerned about my
shares in GM (and I also have F). I may just swap out some GM for HYMTF. Not
sure where GM is in having product that consumers want. With Hyundai though --
apparently the company can't meet the demand for its cars:

Your car experience report here has something to do with whether or not the
stock is a buy?

------
Seems off-topic. Otoh, maybe not to me. Again...and risking the disdain again
of Clownbuck and Grommit -g-... I say if somebody (esp. a value investor!) is
going to buy a new car (assuming value investors would ever buy new) and is
likely going to keep it five or more years (would that even be the minimum time
a value investor would keep a car?) they should at the very least
<u>consider</u> buying stock in the auto manufacturer. Anecdotally, you add to
my belief, Madharry. Had you bought Hyundai stock (through EWY) anytime at or
in the few years after you bought the car (2002), and held the stock as long as
you've held on to the car (until now), you would have a pretty good capital
gain imo:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=EWY+Basic+Chart&t=my

Looking forward from the present, if someone were to make a decision that a
Prius is the best value buy for them, and bought the car now, should the person
now, in current environment, consider buying the stock (Toyota) at the same
time the purchase is made? I say, yes, because although the stock of Toyota may
or may not be a value buy at current price, IF the person bought the stock now,
AND held it as long as they held on to the Prius, imo, the investment would
show a decent or better gain at the end. Less confident, but sticking with the
approach, if someone bought a new Chevy cruze diesel, I'd say the same: at
least consider betting on a few shares of GM for a buy-and-hold if they're
going to make the car buy expecting that they'll be happy to keep their cruze a
good several years.

The land they own has significant Oil & Gas potential. Just if they sell their
U.S. shale land holdings based on 85% of the last acquisition price (say from
QEC), stock could/should be worth around $3.00/share ( or more). The value is
in their land not their drilling expertise. In fact, they have JV partners that
have been drilling their wells. Some are quite good and others are not that
good.

According to their annual report, their 3D geographical studies show a high
probability for "rich" oil and gas reserves in their Niobrara property.
However, drilling their test wells (out sourced to a 3rd party) has been
expensive due to several factors but still significantly over budget.

Therefore, for me, it's a land bank "buy" at a very cheap price. Drilling
partners can be found w/ incentive deals structured to make the operation
efficient and productive. None of their properties are really in "production"
mode. When/if they move to this phase, the potential cash flow from the wells
will drive the stock price much higher based on BOPD valuations.

You will need to study the company and their land holdings to come up w/ your
own valuation. I have (w/ my first buy 10/2010 @ $1.17/share). They still own
that land but now have a few test wells completed and geological reports that
show excellent reserves.

I have 10 buys over this two year period ranging from $1.05/share to
$3.60/share. My average cost is around $1.50/share. I have seen some analysis
that value their holdings around $8.00/share (if developed).

<blockquote> http://goo.gl/XIGCi </blockquote> Note: I have been wrong in the
past and could be wrong in the future. All these E&P companies come w/ risk and
high reward. For me , the risk/reward at current levels is a value buy.

Upped my position by 25%

Upped my Salmon Farm holding (MNHVF) by 25%. With pork, chicken and beef all
going up in price due to the high cost of corn (as a result of the drought),
salmon steaks will be a good substitute. In 8-16 months, the new fingerling
crop of salmon should hit the world market and demand should be strong.
Hopefully, demand will outpace supply and salmon prices should remain stable
and/or increase.

I peeled off a few of my high priced shares in NOBGF which is a commodity play
(soybeans, rice and other grains) and put the proceeds into MNHVF. I also added
to my fish meal & fish oil producer OME. They supply the fish meal to the
salmon farmers which has also increased in price.

These products are all commodity price driven and based on the past
correlations, beef, pork and chicken prices affect fish demand and their
prices. It should be early enough into this cycle that there is a good move
left in the fish and fish protein story. However, MNHVF is already up 50% from
it's recent lows this year but I am guessing we could see the past cycle highs
of between a $1.20/share and $1.35/share as salmon prices and demand increase.

EKS - Everyone can be wrong hahaha. but i appreciate the disclaimer. There has
been lot of M&A happening with land properties lately, but its mostly
divestitures to restructure balance sheets or pure M&A.Those who are buying are
looking at it as a value buy for future profits.

If not, then people are trying to play it in a different way. NBR for example
got rig contracts to drill for YPF. Argentina ( who now owns YPF) is looking at
making the falklands an LNG hub to export gas to peeps like japan, where gas is
selling at north of $12 per million btu. so you can play O&G that way.

So the question is - they do have land, how are they going to monetize it? so
unless we are just investing for a quick trade, that questions of monetization
needs to be answered.

Hyundai. Ha!

This again is my issue with SA: bunch of talkers mostly, and very few doers.
Like the SI guy, who owns no shares. If he actually tried to buy the stock, he
might be surprised:

About my recent comment here:
<blockquote> Turns out I appear to be wrong --- I don't know how I missed it,
but the company shares seemingly can be bought as HYMTF. Thinly-traded, but
available, according to Yahoo:</blockquote>I now add: Available maybe, but as
before, not so convenient or inexpensive to buy.

So I will <u>reaffirm</u> my comment here, <blockquote> I have posted in past
how difficult it was for me to actually buy any Hyundai -- it didn't trade --
or rarely traded(http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HYMLF) -- on the pink sheets.
(And buying anything on the Korean market I found to be too tough --- brokerage
fees/middleman fees/exchange fees make small buys not worth it.) </blockquote>
My experience is again, Hyundai stock (HYMTF, HYMLF, HYMLY) cannot (at my
brokerage anyway) be bought without broker assistance. Which results in a
higher brokerage fee + a Korean middleman fee. Result: more than 10x my usual
commission on any trade. Although, IF you bought enough shares at one time, or
if you kept the shares as long as you might keep your Hyundai car, it possibly
makes the expensive acquisition/sales costs negligible (if the stock works
out). I'm just not willing to pay the price of entry though.

Anybody's experience with Hyundai different? Might I be the only guy around
here who actually has placed or tried to place a buy order? It's a growing
company, and p/e seems to be under 9. May be a good buy. I'll continue to play
it though through iShares Korea Index.

PetroFrontier (PFRRF): I am slowly adding to my few shares. In my view, since
it's all speculative at this stage -- company has control of lots of Australian
land but hasn't found shale oil -- the stock could drop as well as rise. Maybe
more likely drop. So no hurry to buy the stock. Otoh, that insiders are buying
now, that may signal the stock is low enough for small speculators (i.e. me) to
purchase shares.

I like that Heritage is a buyer of the stock. I've done okay following CEO
Buckingham as he made and capitalized on his first-mover foray into Africa. Its
Kurdistan operation though has been a disappointment so far. I still have some
HTGLF shares which I intend to continue to hold.

I like that Statoil is a partner with Petrofrontier. STO is pretty aggressive
for a big oil company in going into new areas, and with going into Australia
through PetroFrontier, it should/could bring needed capital and expertise. (I'm
also a holder of STO.)

My home computers are HP, ASUS and Dell. I think that Dell is not very
competitive price-wise for home users. IMHO they are targeting businesses more.
I was somewhat impressed with Dell warranty when I had it. Support was
definitely India-outsourced, but they agreed to change the video card twice
without any fight and offered to change motherboard on the second time since
they were not sure that the video card was faulty. They even sent a guy to my
place to change the motherboard - I actually refused it since I knew it was
video card that was bad. All this for free on a warranty that was almost at the
end.

In terms of businesses, I know quite a few Dell-only companies. I've also seen
one or two IBM-now-Lenovo-only places. Never seen an HP-only company. IMHO Dell
has pretty good corporate position and it's harder to push it out from there

ETP- Bought a few units today at 42.05$. ETP has been stagnating since 2008 in
term of it's distribution. The company is now completely remodeled with the SUG
acquisition (via ETE) , the pending purchase of SUN (for it's crude and refined
product pipelines) and the sale of the somewhat ailing propane business. I like
the collection of asset they have assembled and I think that growing the
distribution again ought to be possible.

My rough estimate is that ETP (ex the GP contribution) should dom 1.6B$ in
EBITDA with a ~20B$ in EV (roughly 12x EBITDA) which is not extremely cheap but
no expensive either. The high yield if 8%+ is the main attractikn and
distribution growth would be icing on the cake. This MLP is a good one to pick
up on secondaries, which are most likely firthcoming this year, due to need to
finance the acquisitions, dropdowns and organic growth projects. I am buying
some units here with the intend to pick up some more later opportunistically.

FDP getting good traction +4.37% today last $25.05/share. Still under it's GN
values of $38.30/share. I currently own ADM and have owned BG in the past. It's
interesting to see that at least according to the GN valuation, several of
these AG companies continue to sell below their GN valuation. It's possible
that the market has discounted this sector due to low "industry" product
margins.

BG is moving to higher margin end products utilizing new bio technology
processing facilities. It's a slow move but eventually overall product margins
will be higher. Therefore, I like BG below $60 and continue to add shares to
ADM below $27/share.

Ag companies, comments:

I'm still holding FDP. I switched out from DOLE after considering comments
here. FDP seemed to have the better balance sheet. A day or so ago, DOLE
announced it was selling couple of its divisions, and that may be a factor why
DOLE has risen lately. Also, all through July and August, Mr. Murdoch, the
dominant and controlling shareholder, had been buying shares. I saw that, (DOLE
being on my watch list), but I passed on the stock. I suspect FDP's current
small rise is spillover from news of the DOLE divisions sale . DOLE itself
might now be a buy -- assuming corporate debt reduction from the sale and
better roic going forward. I don't know.

The last time ADM dropped to the $24 range I wussed and didn't buy. I'm waiting
for another chance.

TSN does not meet the Graham criteria imo because it's not in the subset that
Dr. Graham applied his formula to. Namely, TSN isn't consistent because it
doesn't have profits in enough years that Dr G specified.
It might be a value buy though based on some metrics (low historical p/stated
bv) that I like. Because I'm not understanding the current corn/feedstock
affect on TSN's profits, I'll pass pass on TSN.

EKS - If you run a grahm number on DE Master Blenders and HSH, what does it
give you?
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:9/19/2012 6:54:30 PM
From:E_K_S
Neither of these companies meet the minimum GN criteria for EPS. De Master
Blenders is too new as they were spun off from Sara Lee in 2012. There is no
history of EPS specifically 10 years of positive EPS. A GN for this new company
is worthless w/o the financial history (EPS & Tangible BV).

HSH has negative EPS for three years out of their last five. Their tangible BV
is negative ( probably from acquisitions w/ goodwill). The calculated GN is
meaningless.

You just can not apply a "formula" to some company w/o understanding the basic
fundamental financial criteria that goes into their historical financials.

The GN approach was developed as a conservative way to value long lived
companies with a high tangible BV. Positive EPS are key to the analysis as the
10 year period allows a company to have experienced a complete business cycle
(both peek's & troughs). Sometimes I will use five years of positive EPS but in
most all cases EPS need to be positive.

The best undervalued "long lived" company that is selling http://goo.gl/Veh8m .
Of all the GN and EKS$ values, GLW always comes on top. Their GN value last
time I checked is around $21.00/share.

Everybody says their LED business is a loser and they overlook all the other
business segments they own and have been growing. The company has been able to
maintain and even grow their high margins (maybe not in the LED business
anymore). I evaluate the company w/o their LED division and I see a group of
very profitable business units that are growing. The company has been around
since 1897 and continues to "reinvent themselves". That's 115 years!. New
investors says that it's different this time. I say it is 69% undervalued and a
strong buy & hold.

I still hold shares I bought back in 2000 around $5.00/share. Sold a bunch of
those shares around $22/share and have been buying again in the $12/share
range.

The company knows how to grow their Tangible BV (more often organically not by
acquisition).

Hi Nik. The formula for calculating the Graham number is pretty simple.

The GN = square root of (22.5) x earnings per Share x book value per share.

HSH appears to be undervalued using this calculation but Graham excluded any

Re ETP -
>>I have got this one on my watch list if it should fall below $40.00/share<<

I guess it depends on your confidence to hit the best price. I think the
current price around 42$ represents a pretty good value, so I am buying some
now. It will go lower, if they announce another secondary now, but since they
just had one done recently, I think the next secondary will occur a few month
out. Also to consider is that you are missing out on a distribution (0.89$)
potentially by holding out.

These MLP's are really beneficiaries from QE3, by means of having access to
cheap debt financing and because they own assets that will increase revenues
with inflation (via FERC FEE indexing to inflation+2% or so), while. My MET
(which I sold a few days go) is really hurt by low interest rates, which it
seems is the market starting to figure out.

Somewhat off topic, a lot of folks are recommending to sell puts, as it is the
same than putting in limit orders (which is how I like to buy my stocks). Well,
I think the two are not really comparable. I can pull my limit order (unless
they hit) at any time without penalty but if you sell a put, and the market
starts to weaken and volatility goes up, the put starts to increase in value
even though it is not in the money. So, at that point, the trades starts to
loose money, which is not the case with a simple limit order. For this reason,
I am not really a big fan of selling puts, even if I had the cash to buy
shares, unless we have a special situation, where the premiums are very high.

and CVS are each the source of more than 20% of CAH's annual revenue, and amid
losing ESRX to ABC on price "the risk of margin compression upon contract
renewal with WAG and CVS appears higher than normal," the investment bank
contends. It adds, "While we understand that Cardinal has done a very good job
servicing both of these long-term clients, we understand [WAG] is at least
considering moving brand purchasing in-house (suggesting most, if not all, of

Black Hills Corporation (BKH) - Closed out position selling the last of my BKH
shares @ $36.00/share

I plan to move the proceeds into more MLP's. Most of my BKH position was bought
during the market "crash" 5/2009 around $15.98/share. I was alerted by your"
buys" as it was a pretty crazy time as there were many excellent "value" buys
available at that time. BKH is now selling close to a four year high, perhaps
with a bit more upside left. My premise for selling is BKH did just complete
the sale of some of their acreage with a good price/share and stock rallied to
new highs. Dividend now around 4% which is ok (anything below 4% generates a
sell signal for me). Because the company has a lot of exposure to Coal (w/ a
separate coal mine division) and coal fired generating plants, this is a net
negative for me. If their exposure was w/ NG and owned NG/Oil wells, I would
hold and/or add to the position.

MDU is one of the utilities I like because they have extensive NG exposure in
their non-utility assets (including storage, distribution, and E&P w/ lots of
acreage to develop). However, I am a buyer below $20.00/share, not at current
levels.

Therefore, for many of the reasons Clownbuck stated, I am building positions in
MLP's, those w/ strategically located Pipelines, processing and NG gathering
facilities and/or JV w/ E&P or any of the major integrated oil companies that
are developing their shale properties (ie XOM).

As a footnote, it is interesting that XOM chose to purchase new acreage from
DNR that lacks the infrastructure (roads & pipelines) since they were able to
obtain the land at a bargain price. I suspect their long term plan is to
develop the infrastructure w/ one or more partners. Many of these integrated
oil companies have (or had) very profitable pipeline and NG processing
facilities (ie COP before the PVX spin off). They are excellent cash flow
generators.

I also noticed this week that Noble signed a NG exploration deal w/ Falkland
GAS off the Falkland Islands: http://goo.gl/C7ah2

The goal is to eventually build a LNG facility to export NG to Japan & Europe.
Nobel is also the drilling partner for CNX to develop their vast NG reserves.

There is a lot of new money finding it's way into the development, distribution
and delivery of NG (even LNG) worldwide. Both Japan and Germany have stated
that new nuclear facilities are out of the picture and NG and NG liquids will
be the replacement fuels.

FWIW - Some of these MLP's offer automatic dividend reinvestment w/ a 5%

program. To be sure that a 5% discount DRIP program is available, you can check
on the Web site under investor relations.

Schwab is clueless on these programs and/or discounts and have no master list
they can distribute to customers. They will check if you ask them but may not
offer the discount (especially Canadian companies) where other brokerage firms
do.

Both EPD and ETP offer the 5% discount dividend reinvestment. So those of you
who bought ETP today and want the 5% discount on dividends reinvested, need to
notify your brokerage company accordingly.

You will notice on the dividend period new shares added to your account.
