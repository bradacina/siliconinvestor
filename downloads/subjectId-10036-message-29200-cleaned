The Foreign Tax Credit has been discussed here and elsewhere.

I'll state again my opinion based on MY experience. Others may differ.

Yes, " you can file to get a 1 for 1 tax credit off your US taxes". This is
what is wanted. (I.e. it's preferable, rather taking the Canadian tax as a
deduction on US tax forms, or (heavens!) just doing nothing with it.)

It's really no problem as long as the Canadian tax is not more than $600 per
year (for someone married,filing jointly). I assume anybody here asking now
about the tax consequences is maybe, if they are even going to buy one of these
things now, is only going to get one month's or one quarter's distribution for
tax year 2007. (I don't want to believe there's anybody here who's been in
these things for a long while and only now gets around to asking about the tax
consequences.)And so unless the distribution amount is fairly substantial
($4000 distribution x.15=$600 taken in Canadian taxes), it's just a simple
matter of filling out the amount on one line, if I recall correctly.

However, if the Canadian deducted tax is OVER $600 (for someone filing
jointly), then Form 1116 MUST be completed in order to get a credit against USA
taxes.

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1116.pdf

I have found this form completely incomprehensible. As I have stated elsewhere,

"You enter line items from worksheets and other referenced forms (e.g. on line
17: "Enter the amount from line 1041 (minus any amount on Form 8914 line 6)"
and then this: "caution: If you figured your TAX using the lower rates on
qualified dividends or capital gains, see page 16 of the instructions". You
have to figure capital gains or losses long-term vs. short-term for the FOREIGN
stocks you might have sold. Or maybe it's for the USA stocks after subtracting
the FOREIGN stocks in each of these categories. (I can't tell.)"

Maybe, maybe for somebody who's only foreign credit (dividend income)and stock
sales are in one foreign country (Canada), then maybe the form might be
completed. But for anybody who's been around here or the other value threads,
that person, imo, has very possibly bought or sold or received dividends this
year from several foreign stocks. E.g. we would be talking Norwegian oil
stocks/income, Chinese stocks/income, Taiwanese stocks, Mexican stocks,
Brazilian stocks, Canadian stocks, etc. etc. Not to be ignored in the
calculations: the income and buys and sells of emerging market funds or any
foreign funds where a dividend was paid and a country tax withheld.

My summary: You will see many media reports or tax advisers who (blithely) say
"complete Form 1116 for the credit". I say humbug. I claim it is not possible
for any normal person to understand or correctly complete Form 1116. (Stumped
my TurboTax program too in my attempts at using it.)

What I've done last year, (having more than $600 in foreign tax credits), is to
do the alternative thing, which is to sum the foreign tax credits reported in
the taxable brokerage 1099 statements and take the total as a deduction. It's
just reported on one line. Of course a deduction is not as good as a credit,
but there you are.

All just my experience and from my abilities.

Sorry that you missed them Jurgis, they were cheaper when I posted the message.
And yes, SGTL was selling less than cash.
None of the three have any debt to deduct. Not sure what kind of calculation
you're using. I'm glad Paul got it.
Besides, the word I used was "near" which definitely qualified for GNSS as
well. And by the way, they were not "buy now" calls. This is the "value thread"
so I put them out there for all to see. Exactly when or if to pull the trigger

Re: Foreign tax withheld in IRAs, 401ks, or any tax excluded account...

I received an inbox asking if the rules had been changed in regards to
receiving a tax credit (you can't receive a tax credit) for IRAs (and other
accounts which shield you from US taxes) when foreign tax is deducted from
interest or dividends. Sorry my post wasn't clear, the answer is no:

http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i2555ez/ch01.html

Foreign tax credit or deduction. You cannot claim a credit or deduction for
foreign income taxes paid on income you exclude. If all of your foreign earned
income is excluded, you cannot claim a credit or deduction for the foreign
taxes paid on that income. If only part of your income is excluded, you cannot
claim a credit or deduction for the foreign taxes allocable to the excluded
income. For details on how to figure the amount allocable to the excluded
income, see Pub. 514, Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals.

I have some suspicions too about that Canadian withholding tax taken out of
distributions (dividends) of Canadian stocks held in an ira.

I almost understand this part:

"You cannot claim a credit or deduction for foreign income taxes paid on income
you exclude. If all of your foreign earned income is excluded, you cannot claim
a credit or deduction for the foreign taxes paid on that income. If only part
of your income is excluded, you cannot claim a credit or deduction for the
foreign taxes allocable to the excluded income."

I interpret that as, you'll see in your monthly broker's statement that in your
ira for every dollar of Canadian trust dividends you got that month, 15 cents
has been funneled off to the Canadian tax authorities. That 15% tax money is
lost, kaput. You can't take it as a deduction or a credit on your income taxes.

EXCEPT, maybe and subject to various people's various opinions, that is "only"
for money on "income you exclude" which I interpret as "money you exclude from
your reporting on your 1040."
Which means for people who are just contributing to an ira and/or letting such
money accumulate, they can do nothing with the 15% tax of those ira dividends.

However, if you are WITHDRAWING money from your ira and therefore paying tax on
this previously tax-deferred money, that is now (they say) "included money" and
you can maybe, possibly, some people say, claim somehow that the money you are
withdrawing consists of Canadian dividend income and therefore you can and are
permitted to use the 15% Canadian tax of ira dividends as a deduction or
credit. Seems kind of arcane and maybe not important, unless maybe you're over
70, have to make withdrawals from an ira, and have lots of Canadian trust
income. Searching SI will bring up a link to a person who has explained the
steps he undertook to get this deduction. I've no idea if it's legal or
correct.

Not doing well with my few shares of CLI (Mack-Cali Realty Corp). I'll average
down with a few more shares now on today's stock drop (possibly associated with
an analyst downgrade to "market perform"). The dividend yield is attractive (to
me)*. I also like that among the top institutional holders are several foreign
firms (Barclays, Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro, Invesco). Perhaps the lower USA
dollar makes CLI even more attractive now to Pound/Euro holders seeking "cheap"
USA real estate assets. (Otoh, I could assume if the Europeans believe the
dollar will fall further, they might be exiting or slowing investments in
dollar denominated assets.)

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cli

*The current annualized yield is 7.1%. I just wonder if I'm better served if
instead of adding to CLI, I continue to diversify my reit bet and capture
greater yields by adding to something like RIT. That cef too has dropped from
where I bought.

Re-established my WON position (after 31 days) and doubled my share holding.
This is my speculative pick for next year. The stock is trading near its all
time low and the only thing it has going for it is the company continues to
generate positive free flow cash almost $1.00/share.

The company has been experiencing negative growth which I believe is at or near
its end in their spiral down. That's my bet...the growth rate decline is over
and revenues at current levels stabilize. Expectations are still quite negative
which allows the value investor to pick up shares at a discount. The company
sells below book value, continues to make capitalized investments in their
network (in Dec, 2007 have updated their network with new digital equipment),
signed a new distribution contract with Citadel broadcasting and even reported
a profit in its last quarter (Westwood One 3Q Profit Tops Analyst View
http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/071101/earns_westwood_one.html?.v=1 )

The company wrote off $5/share goodwill in January 2007 and has accumulated a
tax loss carry forward from their annual losses to-date. Be warned that the
company does carry a large amount of revolving debt which is serviced from
their current cash flows.

My new fair value price target is $6-$8 per share which is based on the current
price media companies sell for based on their free flow cash (6x-8x $1.00 share
TFCF).

The one bogey is CBS has a standstill agreement that expires Dec 31, 2007 to
not sell their 16 million shares (almost 20% ownership of the company). After
that date, these shares probably go on sale. It's an interesting value
proposition but this company is not without risk. Based on the current price,
my dollar position is small (less than 1% of the portfolio) but represents a
lot of low priced shares.

Started a position in WAG (WALGREEN CO ). Company selling near its 52 week low
and the P/S is quite low. The forward PE at 15 is a fair price but only yields
1% at its current dividend payment. This is a reversion to its mean play as the
company has sold off from its 200 day MA at $42.69 and is below its 50 day MA
of $38.56.

In April 2007 the stock was booming trading near $48 and same store sales were
at 9%. Goldman Sachs analyst John Heinbockel reiterated a "buy" recommendation
on the shares with a $55 one-year price target.

Now as the stock trades in the $37.70 price range, seems like a a good value.

Written 15 April 2007:
"At any rate, at 22x current and 19x times potential TFCF, Intel’s stock isn't
likely to reward investors with large gains in a year or less, but it should

Hi Paul - I guess that is why one should evaluate an investment with several
different value measures.

From the article you posted for DIS:"... Free cash flow is key to evaluating
media firms, DeGulis says. Disney's free cash flow is expected to equal about
$2.35 per share in fiscal 2008, which ends in September.
"That should be slightly above earnings of $2.15 a share," DeGulis said.
"That's a very healthy situation. Generally for the S&P 500, free cash flow is
about half of EPS." ..."

I have had DIS on my watch list and maybe it is time to start a position
especially if the analysts sees a 10% growth in their ESPN unit.

One of Buffet's value measures TFCF (True Free Cash Flow) is one I have used
with a lot of success especially if the company has a long term track record of
posting positive TFCF.

The media sector has underperformed the S&P 500 so perhaps now is a good time
to build up your positions.

Yes, I agree: it's good to evaluate on several measures.

It's a philosophical thing too. I assume most people look for reasons to
exclude stocks from purchase. That is, for any stock somebody comes across, it
isn't a buy for them because maybe the person won't buy large caps, or won't
buy any microcaps, or the dividend is too small, or the p/e is down, or there's
too much debt, or analysts are issuing sell ratings or the psr is still too
high, etc. etc. All supporting reasons for somebody to avoid making a purchase.
Valid reasons too.

Obviously for anybody who looks at all the various stocks I am buying, my
philosophy is going to be different. I am trying to find reasons to include
stocks for a purchase, not exclude them.

So as regards DIS, it does not pass my requirement for either p/sales
comparisons or for p/book measures. It did though in the past go 'round on the
thread ('02-'03). However, on forward p/e -- acknowledging that basing
purchases on forward estimated earnings is VERY dangerous -- I can include the
stock now as a buy. Jmo of course. And it helps - confirms sort of - that
people who use cash flows to make their buys, also say it's a value at current
price.

DIS, i have been looking at DIS too and i think it's a buy now. Instead of P/S

debt is accounted for and DIS has less debt than most other media companies.

Net cash imo is: Total cash & equivalents minus all liabilities. If you start
using accounts payable and inventory to cover liabilities, you cannot claim
that it's "net cash", since they are not cash equivalents and in the worst case
they are worthless.

However, net current assets = current assets minus all liabilities

So, you can say that SGTL trades at net current assets, but I dispute the claim
that it trades at net cash.

net cash. Okay, the result though, the way "net cash" is defined, makes no
substantial difference to how I might invest here.

If SGTL had no current liabilities and still had $2.06/sh. in cash and sold for
$2.04/sh or even traded at $1.50 or lower, I doubt I'd consider it having much
more of a margin-of-safety than where it is now with those current liabilities.

That is, because I don't know what management will do with the cash, the
company is not currently profitable, I'm an outsider with no expertise in the
business or understanding of the talent available (or missing) in their tech
and management teams -- I am not likely to punch up my small bet on SGTL very
much just because it would have lots more cash/sh. and lots less liabilities
than what it actually has already.

I am guessing that it wouldn't make much difference to you either. That is, for
these net current asset plays or net cash plays, you seem in previous posts to
want the company you're looking at to show some profits and not losses. So I'd
guess, that even if SGTL had no liabilities whatsoever and still had $2.06 in
cash/sh., you'd not much be interested in buying many, if any, shares. Which is
a more conservative and perhaps a better way, or at least another way, to play
these things.

One other factor I consider for a company with a high net cash position that is
marginally profitable is a large insider holdings position by key management.
This must be stock that they have purchased in the open market during or after
any company restructure announcement and hopefully at higher market prices.

I also like to see some long term incentive program for "key management". This
way, key management has a vested interest in getting the company profitable and
staying there for two or more years..

This still does not always work as the BOD can change their compensation
package by a "back room" vote and distribute any extra cash to key executives
w/o shareholder approval.

This happened to me on a company turnaround situation. Everything was set up
with a restructure announcement (cash in the bank from a refinance), key
executives were well vested but underwater with their current stock holdings
and it appeared that the company was setup for a slow and profitable
turnaround. All that was needed was for the company to run lean and mean for a
few quarters and begin to post consecutive higher profitable earnings.

What happened was the BOD entered into a "back room" deal that forgave two key
executives loans paid by the company with no performance or time requirements.
Once their new compensation package hit their bank account, they left the
company and did not follow through on their restructure plan. As a result, the
company took another two years to return to profitability, a lot of that free
cash was pissed away and the company was left with substantial long term debt.

Therefore, I prefer a company that can generate quarter to quarter free cash
flow rather than having a large position of net cash on their books (unless
management has a large vested interest in seeing the company survive and grow).
There are too many situations I have seen where a large net cash position (from
a sale or company debt refinance) gets spent with no direct improvement in the
profitability of earnings other than lining the pockets of management.

IMHO, from looking at these two companies from Buffettology point of view,
neither stock is a bargain though CSCO is closer to being one. I am not sure
INTC is a great growth company that it was anymore. Although it still remains
one powerhouse in processor business, so it's stock will fluctuate wildly as
profitability varies depending on capex, sales and price pressures. INTCs ROE
is varying all over the place in the last 5 years, and unfortunately I believe
the trend will continue.

CSCO I believe is much more back on the growth track and I really missed it on
its rebound and couple drops into teens.

Whether FCF is very useful vs. other metrics, I am not sure. Most of the time I
think it's splitting hairs where like Buffett says "it's more important to be
approximately right than precisely wrong". But I agree that there are - perhaps
few? - situations where FCF vs earning difference may make a huge story. I am
not sure this is the case for INTC and CSCO.

"Undervalued tech companies"

Well, I actually believe such beast exists and can be profitable:

ARMHY definitely was when it fell into 2's and 3's way back. That was a great
buy.

QCOM before the whole big runup in late 90's. I remember looking at it and
passing and then everybody made their millions. ;)

ADBE was cheap once when Microsoft was supposed to kill them. Another mistake
of mine.

I think ORCL was also cheap once. ;)

But those are examples of great companies at cheap prices. I also have some
examples of crummy tech companies at cheap prices that made money:

- Whatever that government software company was in 2000 which Jim Clarke I
think sugggested, which was trading at book or something and a bunch of us made
money on.

- HRAY and KONG recently.

- Some crummy semiequips a way back.

- OVTI. We can call it crummy. :)

But you are generally right - crummy cheap tech companies rarely make a lot of
dough. You have to understand what they do to figure out if they have a chance.
Most of the time they don't. :) And even ones that do, don't necessarily win.

favorites....

well, some changes since here:
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=23923973

I lowered TDW VLO and trusts., but over all I am satisfied with my mix. I was
up 30% ytd on oct 31, but now only +18% YTD. Of course, happy to be there with
REITS dropping this year. If favorites are measured by $$$ held, my favorites
are ACAS, oil sands, and REITs.

Reits were overvalued a year ago, but now may be the time to buy a few. I have
been upping my bet here.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1y&s=%5ERCI&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=%5Enya

Here is a list to get a diversified mix. -- Office: HRP, BDN, and possibly PKY
CLI. -- Mixed: DRE and possibly LXY. -- Industrial: FR. -- Health: MPW. --
Retail: RPT., and possibly PEI, CBL. -- Lodging HPT, maybe FCH. -- Residential:
not great, but UDR and SUI are probably the best. I own a small amount. ---
(HRP is the best of the whole lot.) My main criteria is Price/FFO.

.....
Back to which stock to recommend...
TRN.

Profitable. 50% railroad business, which is slowing down, but they expect to
remain nicely profitable. I am underwater on this one. "Trinity expects to post
a profit of $3.10 per share to $3.50 per share next year on flat revenue.
Analysts polled by Thomson Financial expected earnings of $3.64 per share, on
average." They expect railcar and barge builds to increase 2008. We'll hope and
see. The point to aging railcar and barge fleets.

check their presentation:
http://www.trin.net/invsrela/presentations.html

got some idiot buying a lot of shares:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=TRN

$27.40 / $3.20 = 8 1/2 PE.
I think it is a solid company. Nice ROE, clean balance sheet, cash flow, etc. I
like the long term outlook for rail and barges given that I expect energy
prices to continue to increase.

It's been a while since I've posted any "best idea" here on SI.. almost three
years? (That was CCL Industries, a very boring but very undervalued Canadian
packaging company.) So I'm sorry to say that for the first time I have no
stocks I'd be willing to recommend in public as "likely for substantial gains
next year" from my own portfolio. I am keeping only four long-term long
positions in my stock portfolio: RNR (held 10 years), FR (held 8 years), MSFT
(held 15 years), TRMD (held 4 years). I do reserve the right as a radical value
investor to continue shorting certain financial stocks :-)

Some of the best value I see now is in commodities (this was long before I
heard of Jim Rogers) and that's where I intend to switch most of my investing
for the long-term. I do still intend to be involved in the stock market, but
I'd be interested to correspond with anyone else who is also making the switch
from stocks to soybeans...

RE " I would prefer for the company to show profits"

I don't think I've ever seen that in a price to net cash stock.
A company that is profitable would never get as cheap as selling for net cash.
The reason(s) a company does trade as low as net cash is because there are
problems/losses or something negative like high cash burn.

As for calculating net cash, your method is overly strict in my opinion.
Obviously debt (if any) needs to be deducted, but deducting current liabilities
from cash isn't required because some or most of current liabilities can be
offset with accts recv and inventory, prepaids and other current assets. Now if
inventory is extremely high that would need to be discounted.

In any event GNSS was a quick lucky winner I'm happy to say, but the bottom
line is when stocks get that low, unless the cash burn rate is high, there's
not much room for them to fall, and if the downside is minimal, there's only
one way for them to move. :-)

SIBob, yes, always a valid question or concern ("What are we missing?") when a
complicated and diverse business like ACAS tumbles along with other stocks that
also have words like "loans, mezzanine, CMBS" associated with them.

I continue to hold all my shares. I am hoping management has had the savvy to
prevent a debacle from happening with the loans they bought or made, or the
leverage they've employed in doing such. To date, management's record has been
good (afaik); I hope it continues.

I don't think that my net cash calculation method is "overly strict". What you
and Paul are calling "net cash" is called "net current assets", i.e. total
current assets minus all liabilities. I don't see a point to use "net cash"
term for something that has a different term used by other people and
describing the situation more precisely. :) Therefore I will continue to
distinguish "net cash" and "net current assets", although sometimes they are
the same. :)

If I am not mistaken both HRAY and KONG traded this year below net cash while
still being (marginally) profitable. Not for long though. :)

my favorite ideas continue to be plg.to and sil. both speculative. Ive
discussed them at length here in the past. I believe the cheapest stock I own
is a uranium company in Mongolia kri.to. The uranium is there, a lot of the
infrastructure is there. It had been developed in the past by the russians, and
management is very experienced in the uranium business. whats needed now is a
formal feasability study and financing. But most important and the reason the
stock has tanked from over $5 to $1.40 is the waffling of local govt regarding
how they want to regulate and tax mining and specifically uranium. The fear is
that the waffling will go on so long that by the time the mine sees production
there will be oversupply of uranium and prices will crater.

OMG, pure growth investment and even one with a negative earnings through all

Sorry Jim, just kidding. :)

But also, sorry, I don't see what you see in KONA. OK, it might be spectacular
growth story in Peter Lynch tradition. But come on, how can you justify buying
negative earnings restaurant stock? What we lose in income, we'll make up in
volume? I assume it's growing its network and the earnings are negative because
of CapEx? But even then, how are you sure that once they stop CapEx'ing, they
will be profitable? A lot of restaurants have managed to kill themselves while
CapEx'ing. No, sorry, not for me.

OK, my suggestion. Since HW and WSC are mostly beaten to death by me, I'll
suggest CRDN. Nicely killed stock in a profitable high ROE company trading at
low P/E. So everyone is sure that their armor is so good that it will last
forever and army won't need to buy it anymore. And that USA won't go to any
wars anyway come the election. At the current valuation, I am willing to risk
on these, especially since CRDN has other possible growth areas. If these pan
out, the stock can take out recent highs. So sure the time to buy this was at
~$5 in 2003 or $20 in 2005. But what's wrong with ~$50 in 2007? :)

My understanding is nca = net current assets = total current assets minus all
liabilities (both long and short term). (Some people exclude the balance sheet
category 'deferred taxes' from this liability, on the assumption these are
never going to be paid.) Some people search the 10k's and other reported stuff
for total (future, not just current) 'pension liability' and other off balance
sheet liabilities which they then add to the liability total. In Ben Graham's
day, from my understanding, there weren't so many of these off-balance sheet
items.

Net cash -- my understanding of it -- is either defined as cash less total long
term liabilities, or more commonly but less strictly as: (cash+cash
equivalents+short term investments) minus long term liabilities. My
understanding is that "short term liabilities" are not included in the
definition of 'net cash', because, by definition, these are items expected to
be paid off within a 12 month period.

Perhaps to my detriment (perhaps not), I generally calculate from the balance
sheet only and so I ignore off-balance sheet liability items unless someone
else points out that these are or could be significant for the particular
company, and so should be included in the calculations.

I agree that this might be a relevant reason to buy commodities instead of
their producers.

The next question then is: all commodities are already up a lot. Which would
you still buy? What are the targets of their prices and why?

As I said, I have only thought about oil, but I am not sure oil is going up
another 100% from here anytime soon. And remember: you need for commodity to go
up a lot to make good returns, since commodity is not a company and is not
"growing". Commodity futures usually sell at a discount current prices for that
reason. They are different from stock options in that respect, i.e. future will
always be around current price + storage cost, since otherwise you could just
buy commodity now (theoretically), store it and sell to cover the contract in
the future. It's a bit more hairy than that but essentially this is both good
news/bad news to investors. The good news is that futures might not cost as
much as options. Bad news is that there is no "organic" growth which is what
gives stock investing natural boost.

KONA does look interesting. Considering the stage they're at the numbers look
pretty good. They look like they aim to be the next PF Chang's, and that's
certainly a possibility.

A couple of things I wonder about. First, why invest this early? They still
have plenty to prove about the sustainability of the concept, and there's
probably going to be plenty of time to get in at a good price (unless you're
betting on them selling out early to a bigger player). Second, management seems
light on experience in the restaurant business. To me that's the most critical
variable in the success of restaurant startups.

Re my ideas for 2008, I've got very little. This is about as light on ideas as
I've ever been - probably because the real values are in the financial area,
and I don't do financials.

One thought on the other end of the upscale casual growth curve - PNRA is
looking pretty cheap.

My idea stock is PLA.

Bad management (the Heffner clan) but an iconic and underexploited brand name
with a licensing stream (40M$ annually). Total EV value is about 400M$. There
is valuable real estate for a fraction of the current valuation on the books
(Playboy mansion, which is currently inhabited by Hugh Heffner).

My thinking is that Hugh finally will let go and a different management is set
into place or the company is sold out. the Playboy brand alone is worth more
than the current market cap in my opinion.If you consider 10x of the licensing
stream only that would be worth 400M$. The publishing business is basically
worthless but then we have online and TV plus the real estate.

The Playboy brand is known allover the world and lends itself naturally to
casino's clubs and many other things to play with :-). Years ago they damaged
the brand by licensing to cheap underwear and T Shirt makers, but i think they
are slowly learning. If we get a capable management i can see 20$+ easily. if
current management just screws up a little less we still could get to
15$/share.

Bingo! KONA looks very much like PF Changs when it had 20 restaurants. There
was a five year huge growth curve after that where early investors made a lot
of money. Thats why you don't want to wait until the concept is proven.

The concept has been around since 1998. Management is not new to this - the COO
is the founder of the concept in 1998 and the CEO was the financier of the
concept in 1998.

What is different about this and every other chain that says they are going to
go from 20 to 100 restaurants is the unit economics. $5.5 million of revenues
per unit at a 22% cash flow margin at the unit level. You won't find many
restaurant chains with those unit economics. CAKE is one. PFCB is another.

I also fully agree with your takeover insight. At this price for a proven
concept with all the room in the world to grow it KONA just looks like a
sitting duck for a takeover by PFCB or any one of the public restaurant chains
which have saturated the growth of their brands but are kicking out a ton of
cash they don't know what to do with.

WOW, can I say WOW. I guess PLA is the best example of how to screw up a great
brand. No earnings, no growth, nothing to show to shareholders for ages.

You are right that it would be tremendous takeover value. The question is then
what is the time value - how long do we wait? I think that your recommendation
could have been written in any of last 5 years, no, make it any last 10 years
and the shareholders would have nothing to show for their investment (not
counting couple of spikes for possible trading...). What's different now?

I guess one thing is different that Hugh is older and may keel over soon. On
the other hand, the brand is not getting fresher with overall decline of print
pubs. If nothing is done for another 5 years, a lot of people may not know the
brand any longer... I do read Playboy - just for articles you know ;) ;) - and
it is already not really geared at teens and twenty somethings. Soon the people
who know the brand will start dying like Hugh...

Interesting, but I am not sure... history on this one looks depressing. :(

I'll pass on KONA.

"$5.5 million of revenues per unit at a 22% cash flow margin at the unit level.
You won't find many restaurant chains with those unit economics. CAKE is one."

Operating margins though at the corporate level are negative.

If CAKE's like KONA,l'd rather have CAKE. And do. At higher prices sadly. Very
positive two articles on CAKE in this month's SmartMoney mag. I may add at
current price. Places I see are still crowded.

KONA may have some sort of theme that's unique - as I scan, it seems Happy Hour
and big fish tanks and sushi --- other than that, it looks like any other
dishes that could be copied by anybody else. Maybe though, it's like ROY's,
Hawaiian themed which was bought out.

For me, for themed, I'm sticking with BJ's Restaurants (BJRI), another fast
grower (increasing store count), that's come down in value. Also am holding
GRIL (Daily Grill), and I am in the fry pan too with Ruth Cris (RUTH), whose
stock has been about halved this year. RUTH discussed here:

http://biz.yahoo.com/ms/071212/216076.html?.v=1

It's possible maybe likely that KONA will add add stores and also see
revenue/store increase. In the current environment though, I suspect KONA will
not see earnings/sh growing and maybe not even positive. There are too many
other growing chains, other well-financed chains, other managements who are
flexible and used to competition. I say it's debatable whether the novelty of a
new upstart (KONA) will keep attracting customers.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BJRI,CAKE,RUTH&d=s

People here who have no exposure to the restaurant business and would like
some, well KONA could work for them. For me, I'm more willing to up my bet the
RUTH survives to better times. And I'm willing tu up my shares of CAKE, which I
consider a proven performer that has several options to improve its performance
in the restaurant competitive landscape.

KONA looks very much like PF Changs when it had 20 restaurants. There was a
five year huge growth curve after that where early investors made a lot of
money. Thats why you don't want to wait until the concept is proven.

I think that Peter Lynch's advice about not investing in the "next" anything
applies here. I don't doubt that their concept is good, if it wasn't they
probably wouldn't have made it this far. However, every region has "concepts"
that work (Long Islanders can point to Green Cactus Grill or Ayhan's
Shish-kebab but there are literally hundreds if not thousands of examples). The
question if you're going to invest in them as a growth story is how well they
can manage expansion. With Kona there are a lot of question marks, and the fact
that the founder/creator is in charge of operations may be more of a hindrance
than a help. The person who created the concept is usually not the right one to
move it to the next level. That's been true from McDonald's on.

Just out of curiosity I went back and took a look at the 1998 10-k for PF
Chang's (at which point they had 23 restaurants). First of all, take a look at
the difference in the 10-k. It is well written, well prepared, and clearly
explains their concept and strategy. The best way to describe Kona's 10-k is
"sloppy". Also note that PF Chang's already had in place a well thought out
expansion plan with a formalized management structure that created a bunch of
employee "partners" from the regional down to the restaurant level. I don't see
that at Kona.

Kona may very well prove to be a winner, and I'm certainly going to keep an eye
on it. I also agree that the economics look good for a restaurant concept at
this stage of development. However, when I invest in growth I'm investing in
management more than anything else. Right now I don't have confidence that
Kona's management is ready for the big leagues.

Paul,

ACAS even more confusing now. I'd dismissed its violating the lower trend line
of higher lows because it'd similarly violated the upper line of higher highs.
It's just getting more volatile, which has allowed me to trade it while
maintaining a core position and even adding to it occasionally.

What really puzzles me is that though it even more seriously violated the lower
line yesterday (I added some but well above the low), immediately in afterhours
it traded decent volume at much higher prices (and higher than the additional
shares I bought), yet I can't find a fundamental event that would've/should've
triggered that happening. Up 3% in afterhours, regaining substantially all that
it'd given up during market hours, seems pretty significant to me.

It didn't get back inside the channel, but a similar gain next week would put
it there.

Am I the only one kicking myself for realizing only in hindsight that BIIB was
pretty richly priced? It wouldn't surprise me if its recent tankage was a
life-changing event for some of the owners of puts.

I'll continue to watch it pretty closely. When a pharma is trying very actively
to get acquired and fails, I worry.

A local company that used to trade under the ticker MKC (Marion Labs --
blockbuster drug Cardizem, and run by my personal hero whose leadership example
I try to follow, the late Ewing Kaufmann) went through a similar situation but
did get acquired. After the acquisition, it came out that in the opinion of
many people, including its founder, it needed to be acquired to survive. This
coming on the heels of a 3-year run in which it had 5 stock splits. The Kansas
City area has many "Marion Millionaires" who were former employees.

dividend yields well over 10%. It's hard for me to account for that kind of
sentiment. I can only assume that the sellers of such stocks believe that oil
and the economy will totally tank and that dividends will have to be slashed to
half or 1/3 of current rates.

Oil trusts, REITS, insurance stocks, BDCs.

I like RDN (book value, Whitman investment, not yield), CSE, HTE, ERF, HRP, and
MPW, all for yield.

While things like ISRG and FSLR sell at 3-digit earnings multiples. What a
bifurcated market. Weird.

SI Bob: I've no idea about violations relating to trend lines. I never pay
attention to such indicators or alleged warnings or alerts. Somebody jumping up
and down yelling you got to look at a particular trend line on a particular
stock and immediately see it's a buy or sell, then once in a while maybe I'll
look and try to come to some decision.

Regardless of trend line violations or current position, if ACAS falls to a new
low on no adverse news, I will likely want to buy more. Will be scared about
doing it though. The relatively high dividend yield suggests people are
believing it's not sustainable.

I don't follow BIIB. Seems not to be a value to me at current price. As a
strategic acquisition for somebody, maybe it's worth much more than currently.
I've no idea.

SI Bob, you being a car nut (ref. the thread), I don't see anywhere that you
are looking at or buying or holding any car-related stocks. Do you follow such
stocks? I am holding a little HMC and TM. Tata (TTM) I see today may be
acquiring Jaguar. I'm going to look at Tata. I am upping my positions in car
retailers. Rent-a-car companies may be coming into buying range also, imo.
Some car part companies too are hitting new lows; I'm looking at those, but not
willing to step in for any buys yet.

Yes, I have to admit the very high dividend yield on ACAS gives me pause
because the first thing I noticed about Worldcom was a lofty dividend.
Fortunately, I didn't buy. And just as fortunately, one thing ACAS has been
very reliable about is increasing its dividend.

Regarding car stocks, now that you mention it, it's surprising I'm not invested
in more of them. I'm a proponent of sticking primarily with industries you
understand, and the better you understand an industry, the more active you
should be in it.

However, I only own one automotive stock. F. Have owned it seemingly forever.
And it's one I simply ignore. Though I should reconsider. It's been dead money
for ages. And I haven't personally bought a new American car in quite a while.
I did get a new 05 Chevy pickup a while back, but have bought 4 Subarus
(including a Tribeca last weekend and have ordered an 08 WRX STi, which will be
Scoob #5), a Toyota Camry Hybrid and a Honda Civic Hybrid more recently. And a
used 94 BMW 530i and 70 Datsun 2000 Roadster. Man, it's been ages since I've
bought American! I'll likely be buying a used Ford with the 7.3l Powerstroke in
the next few months, but that's not enough to say I like American cars or their
manufacturers.

Bob, now that you mention it, let me ask you about a car related stock that
I've drawn a blank on when I've asked others about it: Finish Master (FMST.PK)
- a pink sheet company that is "the leading national independent distributor of
automotive paints, coatings and related accessories to the $2.5 billion U.S.
automotive paint refinishing market."

http://www.finishmaster.com/

They went Pink because they felt that complying with Sarbanes-Oxley was too
expensive, but they still file audited financial reports with the SEC. A value
shop that I have high regard for (Tweedy Browne) highlighted them in their
latest report to holders of their funds. I'm curious to hear from anyone who is
familiar with the business, or with that sector in general. It looks like a

Do you own some or know anyone who does? I'd be very curious to learn if the
$4.00 per share dividend actually gets paid.

The market didn't seem to give that PR much respect. The price got bid up the
day before it went ex-dividend, but the volume was paltry.

Interesting idea, though, backing off to Pinks to save on the cost and burden
of SarbOx. I've heard (but don't know of any such situations directly) that
some companies are moving to foreign exchanges, or at least not IPO'ing in the
states to avoid SarbOx. But I also understand that staying public in the UK,
for example, is becoming just as onerous.

I'll have to add this to my watchlist just out of curiosity about a Pinkie
trading at this value and having enough cash to find it worthwhile to pay out
$32 million of it in dividends.

I took a small position in PBY recently. While $10 would obviously be a better
price than $11. PBY has had SIGNIFICANT insider and activist outsiders buying.
Recently and months ago at prices over $14.

Apparently they are going to do a sale leaseback on a lot of their owned
property and that will really help book value.

PBY is already significantly cheaper than AAP,ORLY, and AZO on a price/book and
price/sales basis.
(Using yahoos figures anyway)

The combination of multiple insiders buying and a large activist outsider
continuing to buy is pretty rare and I think significant.

At around $11, we can buy at about the same prices they have recently paid. And
less than the $14+ they were paying a few months ago.

I usually prefer to stick with smallercap stocks my thinking being that in
large caps, there are a lot of people who are smarter than me and have a lot
more money doing research.

But in this case, Im siding with the Insiders & BARINGTON & MITAROTONDA et al.

I don't know anyone personally, but Tweedy, Browne owns it and thought it
worthy of highlighting in their semi annual report. That's enough to make me
very interested.

Re the Sarbox issues, I actually work for a company that went private because
of Sarbox. Nothing nefarious, they're small, they didn't need the equity
markets, and the expense wasn't worth it. According to the press releases and
the filings, pretty much the same reasons apply here. And I wouldn't worry
about the dividend, though it probably isn't a good idea to buy until it goes
ex on the 21st - the market in this stock is far from efficient.

Anyway, what I'm really curious about is how good their business is, and how
good their moat is. For that matter, I'd be interested in hearing about any
other company in the auto supply sector that might be a good value investment.
Everyone hates this sector right now, and when everyone hates a sector I get

corporate name and a new CEO.

of $ 1.2 Billion (3 year growth 3,500+%)

"It's more important than manufacturing, technology and healthcare inddustries.
I'd even go as far to say it's more important than oil. It's right up there
with water because it's still absolutely essential to man's survival. And
without this vital mineral, the world would not have nearly enough food to feed
its growing population. Now, supply and demand are gettubg seriously out of
whack. Thanks to Potash, crop production has stayed in line with agricutural
demand. The U.S. consumes 4.5 million tons of potash but produces only 700,000
tons. This is a 85% deficient. China consumes 4.5 million tons of Potash but
produces only 430,000 tons. More than 70 countries use potash but only 12
countries produce potash. 82% of all countries are net importers of potash.
Potash prices have gone from $ 80 ton to $ $180 ton. 53% of the world's potash
production comes from the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Repeat: 53% of the
world's potash production comes from the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.
However, Saskatchewan isn't located anywhere near a major shipping port so
every single ton of potash has to go by railcar to Vancouver to be shipped
overseas or taken to the U.S. via rail. There is no other option.

In the Canadian province of Saskatchewan Potash One controls over 97,000 acres
of previously explored potash-bearing property which is directly adjacent to a
large potash producing mine to the south of the Company's property (owned by
Mosaic).The Legacy Project shares the same geological structure with this
currently producing potash solution mine.

Potash One's property is perfectly situated for an in-situ recovery (ISR)
operation. This is the process in which you pump water into the ground, letting
the minerals dissolve into a solution and then pump them back up. The process
has proved extremely efficient. Mosaic -- a major producer whose stock has
increased substantially-is using ISR on the property beside Potash One to get
its potash out of the ground quite easily and Potash One will be doing the
same.

In Potash One's official report filed with the Toronto Stock exchange the
compnay states that it has potentially 972 million tons of potash or $ 174
billion worth." *

Corporate presentation: http://www.isxresources.com/i/pdf/Presentation.pdf

Company Overview

Potash One is a Canadian-based resource company engaged in the identification,
acquisition, exploration and development of advanced resource properties.
Potash has a solid balance sheet and experienced technical and corporate
management to advance its current project to the next level. The primary
interests of the company include an option to acquire 100% of a 97,240-acre
Potash Exploration permit in Saskatchewan, Canada.

In his inaugural speech to Potash One shareholders, Mr. Matysek (New CEO and
President) expressed his confidence that the Company has a ground floor
opportunity to develop one of the largest greenfield potash projects in the
world. Potash One controls an established historical potash resource in
Saskatchewan, the largest potash producing region in the world. The Company
completed a 43-101 report on the property earlier in 2007.

With the recent appointment of Mr. Paul Matysek as the new CEO and President
and the name change, the Company is now solely focused on developing its
significant potash property in southern Saskatchewan, the largest potash
producing region in the world. The Company controls over 97,000 acres of
previously explored potash-bearing property which is directly adjacent to a
large potash producing mine to the south of the Company's property (owned by
Mosaic).The Legacy Project shares the same geological structure with this
currently producing potash solution mine.

Potash One's Legacy Project in Saskatchewan was previously explored by Imperial
Oil Ltd. (now Exxon) and Lumsden Potash Corporation.

The 43-101 report completed earlier in 2007 confirms 40 million tonnes in
indicated resource category and 390 million tonnes in inferred resources. The
grades are consistent ranging between 19% and 22% of K2O.

The Company entered the potash sector early in 2005 before the potash prices
started their current uptrend. The market fundamentals such as rise in demand
for agricultural goods for food and biofuels are expected to remain strong and
even grow stronger. This demand is driven by continuing growth in emerging
economies such as China and India where the quality and quantity of food
consumption is on the rise. A new source of demand for fertilizers, thus
potash, also comes from the use of grains for biofuels such as ethanol. On the
other hand, the arable land worldwide is rapidly shrinking. These factors put
an upward pressure on demand, driving potash prices to record levels in the
recent months.

Paul Matysek, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:
"This is an excellent time to be in the potash industry. We are very pleased
that we could secure a company defining trading symbol, "KCL", which clearly
reflects our commodity focus. The new name and symbol affords Potash One the
opportunity to create strong brand recognition in the fertilizer market and
investment world. We are in the best potash producing area of the world with an
established infrastructure that will significantly facilitate our development
plans. Potash One is already conducting a number of technical and financial
studies that will allow us to advance our previously explored potash project to
the next development stage."

Management & Directors

Paul Matysek, M. Sc, P. Geo
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Matysek is an experienced geochemist/geologist with a Bachelor of Science
degree and a Masters of Science degree in Geology. Mr. Matysek has held
management and director positions with several natural resource exploration and
development companies.

Most recently Mr. Matysek was the CEO and President of Energy Metals
Corporation, a premiere uranium company traded on New York Stock Exchange and
Toronto Stock Exchange. Energy Metals became one of the fastest growing
companies in Canada in the last two years having grown from a market
capitalization of only $10 million in 2004 to $1.2 billion when it was sold to
a larger uranium producer earlier in 2007.

He has been involved in raising over $200 million for various exploration and
development projects since 1999.

Fertilizer has really been a growth business of late (forgive us). As
prosperity spreads across the planet, swelling the ranks of the middle class,
agricultural needs are growing too. At the same time, higher energy prices have
increased global demand for ethanol, raising corn prices. What's more, as
developing countries like China convert more land to industrial use, the
acreage left for agriculture is shrinking. All that points to a bull market for
fertilizing nutrients.

Mr Matysek stated: "The potash market sector is driven by solid fundamental
economic factors such as world population growth, increase in the quality and
quantity of food worldwide as well as the emerging demand for biofuels in the
countries like the United States and Brazil. These macroeconomic developments
promise strong growth in fertilizer application which in turn increases demand
for potash, a key nutrient for plants."

Potash

What is Potash?

The word "potash" is derived from the Dutch word Potasch, and originally
referred to wood ash. Potassium carbonate, a basic chemical of pre-modern
times, was extracted from it. Today potash refers to potassium compounds and
potassium-bearing materials, the most common being potassium chloride (KCl).
The term "potash" comes from the pioneer practice of extracting potassium
fertilizer (K2CO3) by leaching wood ashes and evaporating the solution in large
iron pots.

Potash, or carbonate of potash, is in fact a mixture of potassium salt with
impure form of potassium carbonate (K2CO3). In other words, it is the common
term used for the fertilizer forms of the element potassium (K).

Potassium occurs abundantly in nature, being the 7th most common element in the
earths crust. Some clay minerals which are associated with heavy soils are rich
sources of potassium.

Potash bearing rock deposits occur in many regions of the world. They are
derived from the minerals in ancient seas dried up millions of years ago.
Fertilizer potash is mostly derived from these potash rocks. It requires only
separation from the salt and other minerals.

Functions of Potash

Potassium fulfills numerous vital functions in various processes in plants,
animals and humans. For adequate nutrient supply of potassium, soil reserves
are essentially required, which commonly contain more potassium than any other
nutrient, including nitrogen.

For an adult human being, approximately 2 gram of K is required per day and the
typical intakes are 2.8-4.5 grams/day. One good thing about potash is that
there are no health risks associated with this element. The rich sources of
this nutrient in human diet are milk, fruit juice, root vegetables and bananas.

Potash is one of the three most important nutrients to plants, which are
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.

Uses of Potash

Potash has three main uses: fertilizer, feed supplements and industrial
processes. 95% of world's potash is used in fertilizers, while the rest is used
for feed supplements and industrial production.

Potash is a key ingredient in fertilizers that enhances water retention of
plants, increases crop yields and plants' disease resistance. In feed
supplements, the key function of potash is to contribute to animal growth and
milk production. Potash is also used to produce glass, ceramics, soaps etc.

Global Potash Market

Global Potash Market, Long-term Sustained Fundamental Growth

The potash market has been experiencing a rapid growth in the last decade
primarily due to more demand for food, fiber and feed. This trend has been
reinforced by increased demand for biofuels.

The current potash market is estimated at 50 million tons annually, and is
projected to grow at 3-4% rate.

Several factors contribute to the increasing use of potash in the world.

Rising World Population

Simply put, the world's population has been steadily growing at an increasing
pace in the second half of the 20th century and is expected to reach almost 10
billion people by 2050.

Rising population obviously consume more food, and farmers need higher quality
fertilizers in order to increase the crop yields and quality. Potash is a
critical element that contributes to these qualities of fertilizers.

Increasing Wealth - Better Diets

The world economy has been expanding at average of 5%, however, the economies
of the developing nations especially of large countries such as China and India
have been growing at a rate of 10% and 9% respectively. The expanding economy
means rising wealth level in these countries. With the increasing income,
people significantly improve their diets, especially the intake of meat, which
is rich in protein. The meat consumption in China, for example, tripled in the
last 20 years to 70 million tonnes, and is expected to grow further.

Thus, the feed for animals becomes an important factor. And again potash serves
as a key ingredient to improve the quantity and quality of feed.

Higher Oil Prices, Environmental Concerns and Drive for Alternative Fuels - New
Demand for Potash

In recent years, crops like corn and sugar cane have found new applications, in
production of biofuels. High oil prices, increasing concerns about carbon
emissions and subsequent drive to use more alternative fuels has led to the
boom in the ethanol and biodiesel use as alternative energy sources. These
biofuels are produced from crops such as sugar cane, corn, oil palm, soybeans
etc. To increase the yield of these crops from ever decreasing agricultural
lands requires more use of fertilizers. Also this new demand for crops puts an
upward pressure on crop prices. This directly increases the demand for potash.

The use of ethanol worldwide has doubled between 2003 and 2006 to over 14
billion gallons.

Potash Production

Potash is used in 150 countries while only 12 countries produce it. The main
producing countries are Canada, Belarus, Russia, Israel and Jordan. The United
States that produces only 1,200,000 tonnes a year consumes 5,200,000 tonnes,
thus, being one of the largest net importers of potash in the world after
China, India and Brazil. The total global potash mine production in 2006
reached 30 million tonnes.

Saskatchewan is the largest potash production centre in the world. Potash One
property is located in Saskatchewan adjacent to the Belle Plain potash project
operated by NYSE listed The Mosaic Company.

The potash industry is currently running at its maximum capacity, and no new
greenfield projects have been announced. The new demand for potash is expected
to exceed new supply.

identifying the upward trends in resource sectors driven by solid fundamental
factors. We believe that the potash project in Saskatchewan is our next great
find that matches all the key criteria for establishing a strong,
growth-oriented resource company.

Potash One is capitalizing on strong potash fundamentals:

World population growth
Strong income growth worldwide
Growing demand for better diets
Boom in the biofuels
Supply/demand imbalances in the industry
Based on these strong fundamental factors driving the increasing demand for
potash use, Potash One has also secured a large potash property that has the
following advantages:
Proven resource base in Saskatchewan, one of the largest potash resources in
the world
Immediately adjacent to a producer (Mosaic's Belle Plaine production centre)
Same geological setting as above
Amenable to solution mining which has low CapEx and a minimal environmental
impact
Existing transportation infrastructure
Attractive gross margins

In addition to the strong fundamentals and very attractive property
characteristics, Potash One has an experienced corporate and technical
management team to build a growing potash operation in Saskatchewan.

KEY

At its recent Annual General Meeting held on November 21, 2007 discussed and
approved matters critical to the future of the company. All the matters
discussed at the AGM were approved by 99% of the votes.

At a Board of Directors' meeting held following the meeting, the Board
appointed Mr. Paul Matysek M.Sc., P. Geo., as President and CEO of the Company.

Mr Matysek has a keen understanding of the global commodities market and having
followed the agricultural sector for the past several years, he brings the
awareness and thorough understanding of the potash market.

In his inaugural speech to shareholders, Mr. Matysek expressed his confidence
that the Company has a ground floor opportunity to develop one of the largest
greenfield potash projects in the world. ISX controls an established historical
potash resource in Saskatchewan, the largest potash producing region in the
world. The Company completed a 43-101 report on the property earlier in 2007.

Mr Matysek stated: "The potash market sector is driven by solid fundamental
economic factors such as world population growth, increase in the quality and
quantity of food worldwide as well as the emerging demand for biofuels in the
countries like the United States and Brazil. These macroeconomic developments
promise strong growth in fertilizer application which in turn increases demand
for potash, a key nutrient for plants."

Below is a chart of IMOS and some of its competitors. I included MU because its
chart shows how it has mirrored the general decline of the price of DRAM chips
right now.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1y&s=IMOS&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=amkr%2Cspil%2C+asx+mu

This article generally sums up the pressures on DRAM and NAND chips.

That's my take on it. SPIL owns twelve million shares of IMOS. There has been
speculation what might happen between the two companies. Here is the filing
describing SPIL's ownership in IMOS.

Coldwater: CWTR - Limit Order Hit at $6.71.

http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=cwtr&p=W&yr=3&mn=0&dy=0&id=p09769228257

Not sure I want the stock now that my order hit.

Noted following insider buys:

Dan Griesemer: Oct 17 30,000 @ $8.43
Mike Potter: Oct 17...... 13,000 @ $8.45
Frank Lesher: Dec 3... 10,000 @ $8.21

At 6.71, my purchase is 18% below lowest insider purchase
on Dec 3.

Admittedly Financial ratios not all that great.
However, stock appears oversold, and insider purchases
of $8+ gives me some hope of a dead cat bounce possibility.

CWTR did open 65 new stores this year.
Same store sales fell however about 10%.
But frankly, whose apparel sales didn't?
Chicos, Limited, Talbots, Gap?

Retail totally unloved.
Seems overreaction?

Would have been a great short 3 months ago.
Not sure who would want to short this after it
has fallen -44.3% over last 3 months and -71.6%
over last 6 months.

Plenty of blood on the street on this one.

Got this on a tight leash.

Live to fight another day is my present mantra.

The aircraft lease stocks right now would be my favorites going into 2008. See
article by Markham in rllee post.

As is the way I prefer to operate, I am building a position in a package of
these. Specifically I've been buying GLS and to a lesser extent (so far), AYR.

The demand for aircraft apparently is still strong. Perhaps only a world
recession will diminish it. (I am guessing and presuming here without real fact
backup.) These companies seem to be able to get their funds for financing.
Their customers are a diverse lot so the risk of a disastrous customer default
(i.e. returning the planes before contract expires) is diffused.

Basically I'm looking for aircraft demand to continue, and the earnings (and
dividends) of the companies to increase. While waiting, both companies provide
a dividend yield over 10%. (And AYR just raised its dividend.) Consequently I
am looking for a total return consisting of capital gain and dividend yield.
The capital gain could come from investors bidding up the stock for it high
dividend yield, growth in earnings, or some other factor(s).

Some caveats.

"favorite going into 2008". I'm looking to buy now through maybe early 2008.
I'm not expecting results in 2008. With these stocks - as with many others I am
buying - I am planting now with a view for harvesting in 2009/2010.

My "favorites". Generally my latest buys. For me, there's no relationship
between "favorite" and "best performance". Sometimes my "favorites" work out;
sometimes they do not. My best performers have always been stocks that were a
surprise to me, and if I remember right, have never been my favorites at the
time I bought them.

"for it's high dividend yield". I considered 8% high several weeks ago; now
many of my stocks are at 10%, several 12%. So it's quite possible selling in
AYR, GLS might continue and could drive their "high yield" even much higher.

I have Cramer on at 6 PM, mostly for entertainment value, and I recall him
featuring GLS a while back. Likes it (apparently still does) as a global demand
play. I'm watching it now, perhaps this one is a case of people are selling
pretty much anything to which the "R" word can be attached, plus year end tax
loss selling contributes to price declines.
Speaking of that selling, I more likely than not will swap out of
underperformer (like virtually all its peers) WB into relatively small regional
PBKS. Read a very positive article about PBKS in the Baltimore Sun a couple of
weeks ago. The article did not deny the company was immune ftom the problems
facing virtually all banks now, but felt that the company could manage thees
problems effectively enough. Also, PBKS is one the last ones (small
independents) standing in the Baltimore area with Mercantile being taken over
by PNC.

Briefing.com's summary of IMOS press release concerning DRAM prices.

8:04AM Chipmos Technology lowers Q4 guidance to approx flat to slightly up,
compared to 5 to 9% sequential growth (IMOS) 4.44 : Co announces rev for the
month of November 2007 was $64.4 mln, a decrease of 2.3% from the month of
October 2007 and an increase of 4.3% from the same period in 2006. The co also
revised its guidance for the fourth quarter of 2007 to reflect the rapid
decline in DRAM pricing and inventory oversupply in the channel. The co had
expected Q4 revenue growth of 5% to 9% compared to the third quarter of 2007
revenue of $184.1 mln. The co now expects Q4 to be approxi flat to slightly up
compared to the third quarter of 2007, with US GAAP gross margin on a
consolidated basis for the fourth quarter of 2007 similar to the 24.2% achieved
in the third quarter of 2007. The co continues to counter falling DRAM A.S.Ps
with execution on cost controls and diligence in its capital expenditures.
Capex for the full year 2007 is expected to be approx $190 mln compared to $487
mln for the full year 2006. The co remains cautious but expects market
conditions will improve during the next few quarters with DRAM pricing
improving first due to manufacturing constraints. Demand and pricing remain
stable and continue to improve in the co's flash and driver IC segments.

Buying CWTR was a mistake.
Negative cash flow, falling profit margins,
higher operating costs with more stores,
falling same store sales. Negative sector
and individual outlook. Took a small loss
on this, this morning. Still looking around
for something to bottom fish.

RE: AYR & GLS

It appears that the dividend is not a qualified dividend for US investors.

http://investors.aircastle.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=200805&p=irol-tax

From their Web site:"...Generally:Dividends received by a U.S. holder would
generally be subject to tax in the year received and would not be eligible to
be treated as "qualified dividend income". In addition, unless a U.S. holder
makes a "QEF election" as defined in Section 1295 of the Internal Revenue Code,
a U.S. holder will be subject to special rules with respect to (1) any "excess
distributions" and (2) any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of
the shares...."

=====================================================

Have you researched this and do you plan to make a QEF election?

Also, Do you have any concern that the dividend payout ratio for AYR is 125%?

I like your theme for the investment especially with the order backlog for
Boeing and AirBus.
