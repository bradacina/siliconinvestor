SGD used to pay .10 dividend, is NYSE listed, was @ $9 with all time @ $32, can
recover $3 million in insurance for $5 mill EPA settlement, and has had
profitable sales in last 2 Quarters.

A director purchased 26,000 shares in February @ $2. ADDED profit coming from
selling paid-up non-performing real estate.

Float is 10,000,000 shrs. Check details @ MISC: Under $5 Share, I will answer

Hi All:

Any discussions regarding the recent capital-gains tax-cut that is of relevance
to us value investors? My feeling is that the lower taxes would increase
trading and lead to more volatility, thereby making value investing more of a
necessity than ever before...

OK, I have set the ball rolling. Responses welcome.

Lower capital gains taxes will apply only to long term (over 1 year)
holding periods. Will not help the short-term trader any.

I also have heard rumors that one way the treasury
can afford a capital gains tax cut is to remove the short-term
deductibility of losses i.e. if you sell a stock for a loss after
holding it less than a year, you might not be able to deduct it
any more against your short term gains. This might actually
cut down on trading drastically. Again, it is just a rumor.

Paul:. SGD had EPS profits 4Q96 of .19 and 1Q97 of .07

Curves (charts) are interesting but bucks ($) count. Your questions are valid
and I assure you SGD is a unique turnaround.

Look at the EDGARS and you will see the 1996 loss is structured around settling
the EPA lawsuit. Nobody wins a EPA suit and here SGD pled poor-mouth, reduced
it sales purposely and got a $5 million slap.

It also simultaneously won/settled a product infringement suit on its Alpha
Hydrox product line and now are free of $500K in legal fees.

WWW.businesswire.comm/cnn/sgd.htm (I wish I knew how to hot link) will display
SGD's return to profits, but the EDGARS contain the strategy.

SGD has a solid product line but unfortunately Paul SGD's Alpha Hydrox (red

Check www.lombard.com and you will see a insider (director) bought 26,000

Has anybody taken a good look at Mercer International (MERCS)? I'm not

75% of book value (and the book value is arguably understated)
9 times trailing earnings, and the earnings are bottom of the cycle

Mercer is a European paper company which trades on Nasdaq ($150MM market cap).
If there are no hidden negatives here, you could buy a cyclical at the bottom
of the cycle at 9 times earnings. The company trades at $9 and change and
earned $5 a share at the top of the cycle in 1995.

I just can't figure out why its so cheap. It has sponsorship - Fidelity owns
over 10%. The one big negative I see is that management plans to spend $300MM
(twice the market cap) on a capital expenditure program I can't understand.

Hi All :

Sorry, I am responding after quite a while...

I came up with a value screen for this one. What we do is look up the Handbook
of Dividend Achievers for the *dividend* growth-rate of the company. Assuming
the same growth-rate for the future (or a somewhat lower or higher rate,
depending on your outlook and comfort-level), calculate the number of years
that it takes for the stock to yield 10% on your investment. If it is less than
10 years, then the stock is attractive. If it is more than 10 years, the stock
is currently overvalued.

Going by this, we find that Sysco (SYY) and Philip Morris (MO) pass the test.
Automatic Data Processing (AUD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) do not qualify
right now (but maybe sometime in the future they will)...

Thanks, James. I thought a little bit about how to estimate the future dividend
growth-rate of a stock and this is what I came up with :

* Get the dividend numbers for the past 15 years (as far as Value Line can take
us).

* Compute the growth-rate of dividends for every 5-year rolling period (the
approximate duration of a
business cycle). So for a 15-year period, we would have 11 growth-rate numbers.

* Take the median growth-rate number as the projected future growth-rate of the
dividend (the choice of the median ensures that you are neither overly
optimistic nor too pessimistic in your outlook).

I haven't yet compiled the list of stocks. As you might imagine, it involves

qualify, given its fairly low dividend yield, and also a low dividend
growth-rate (7.9% in the last 10 years).

(Exxon is worth checking because it is one of the high-yielding stocks at

Hi :

Nope, XON doesn't qualify either! Its dividend yield is 2.8%, but its dividend
growth-rate (I only have data for the past 5 years) is very low -- about 2.5%.
At current yields, it would have required a growth-rate of 13.6% to qualify.

Or, at its current growth-rate, its dividend yield should have been at least
7.8% in order for XON to make the grade.

Have the companies increased their dividends every year for the past 10 years?
Looking at Ford, I see that their 1992 dividend and 1993 dividend are the same
($0.80). So it doesn't qualify.

Remember, the company has to INCREASE its dividends year after year after year
for at least 10 years. If the dividend stays the same as the previous year, the
company doesn't qualify; it has to keep increasing every year! Rather rigorous,
isn't it? In spite of this, as many as 342 companies made the cut in 1996!

I don't have enough data right here about AWK. But from what little I could see
(a current dividend yield of 3.6%, dividends increased for the last 5 years at
a rate of 11%, it probably merits a closer look...)

James: very nice ideas here which I've not recognized before. I've basically
looked at three methods: Geraldine Weiss - she seems to have a proprietary
method for chosing dividend stocks; relative dividend yield which I've
discussed in an earlier (much earlier) post; and your basic "Dividend Rich
Investor" mentioned by me also, and later as recommended book by Dipy. At this
point I prefer relative div yield in which the price of the stock (American
large cap) is tracked back 20 years against its dividend yield compared to the
S&P 500. So, for example, a graph of JPM (A Dow Dog stock) indicates a buy
point when that ratio is above above 1.3. Well, the ratio is now 3.4/2.0 = 1.7
(S&P yield is about 2.0% I think). Good exit point IN THE PAST - has been about
1.1. (If S&P yield is and stays at 2.0%, and JPM's div. doesn't increase from
$3.52, you'd sell at 160 (vs. about 100 now) 3.52/160 = 2.2% ) A good buy point
for Ford is - again this is based on historical figures, assuming cycling of
the stock around a "fair value" and reading of graphs - when Ford's rel div
yield. is twice or more of the S&P's. Proponents of this method claim good
results (assuming one has patience and diversification). I like the method
because it is mechanical, I feel assured of a relatively high dividend, I am
paid to wait, and it does seem as if some of these large caps go in and out of
favor and do have cycles. I don't like that I have to have several years of
patience, that it is rote, and that I've not had enough experience with it in
times of really increasing interest rates (or increasing S&P yield). (I
purchased JPM and some others using this method, but passed on F) Paul

Hi Scott :

I checked out the company. Looks pretty good. Dividend yield of 3% and a

Dividend Achievers.

Probably, somewhere along the line, it didn't increase the dividend on one
occasion. Once something like that happens, the company is out of the list and
has to wait for at least 10 years (and pay increasing dividends during each of
those 10 years) before it is allowed back in!

However, RPM Inc. (RPOW) could get into the list sometime in the near future
and deserves attention at least for that reason.

Dipy - How about 20%+ dividend. I've mentioned Terra Nitrogen (TNH) in the
past. They are a limited partnership which always brings concern from investors
but I've owned this one for several years now over which time the price has
doubled. According to their LP agreement, they have to pay out all earnings
over and above set limits for reserves, etc. That amounted to around 25% last
year.
They are in the business of making agricultural nitrogen products. As long as
the US keeps farming there will always be a need for their products. Foreign
competition has declined over the past few years which is why TNH has become so
profitable, along with stable natural gas prices which is the primary raw
material used to make ag nitrogen. They have two plants located in the farm
belts. The stock is somewhat cyclical over each year. Price fluctuations occur
due to the weather in the midwest since this affects the need for its products.

Hi Mike

>(1) Is this a Master Ltd Partnership (MLP)?

TNH is just an LP and gets its tax breaks because it is an agricultural
concern. I don't think Congress is going to do anything to damage TNH as it
would also do considerable damage to other ag concerns which would be political
suicide. I spoke with Craig Cosgrove at IR in 9/96 about the legislation and he
stated that the MLP legislation didn't affect TNH.

TNH buys options to lock in good gas prices and prices have been pretty low
because of the mild winter. This hedging locks in good gas prices and they
usually lock in prices a year in advance to help stabilize earnings. The
prediction is for gas prices to be flat or lower in the next 6-8 months. TNH
usually doesn't drop fertilizer prices when this happens which means the
investors pocket the difference. I use TNH as a rather conservative market
hedge and also a natural resources play.

I read the MorningStar article. I was particularly

were outrageous, but I did not know they were THAT
outrageous. Come on:

Price/Earnings 39.80
Price/Book 10.90
Price/Sales 4.90
Price/Cash Flow 30.80

I agree that these companies did better than
S&P 500, but buying them now (or even holding) is a way to
hell. Of course, Buffett cannot sell even if he wanted
to. ;-)

I still support the Buffett's idea
of buying "inevitables", but I want to buy
at low prices. :-) How about NKE and PEP as
discussion topics. Both are not cheap, but
lower than 2 PSR.

PEP is a turnaround and a spin-off play. They have a
great Frito-Lay franchise and a pretty good Pepsi
soft drink line.

NKE is a "I don't believe in rumours" play. It dropped
from $70 to $55 without fundamental changes. It still is
a great company.

Please respond here or in NKE and PEP threads if these
companies are too far from value investing. :-)

fundamentals to determine why the price dropped. If fundamentals have
deterioriated, is it because they are trying to get more market share and are
taking lower margins? This relates to the company's bull dog status. Otherwise,
the price drop might be caused by overvaluation, pressures from competitors,

them when they become fully valued (or fairly valued), then Buffett is not a
value investor by this definition - as regards Gillette. Being who he his, the
publicity he garners, the extent of his position in G, the small number of
stocks he owns, the opportunity risks in reinvesting the proceeds from a sale,
and the tax consequences,... yes I could see why it maybe makes sense for him
to hold the position. Paul.

Well, you won't be getting such an analysis from me. I am against the use of
such models. They are all dependent on estimating (choosing) the value for
input variables. And each person makes different choices, ergo several
different outcomes are likely. Also, use of these types of models IMO reduces
the thinking process - a mistake I believe -- by concentrating efforts on
making variable choices. Even more important, IMO, these models - being
analytical - purposely remove (a mistake again IMO) the emotion and pain
associated with stock selection. Choosing to invest with models in effect,
attributes the choice and responsibilty to the model. If you argue, that use of
the model is only one aspect of thinking about an investment, then I say okay,
but if the decision requires the model, it's too sophisticated, especially as
there are almost always some obvious buy candidates to choose from. Using such
models for making sell decisions is again, IMO, a copout - just a way of taking
away the pain that accompanies (and should be part of) the selling process.

Most value investors use fundamental analysis as part of their buying and
selling decision process. It's purpose is to put some rational and logic behind
their decisions. The VPA model is simply a tool that allows users to organize
various financial assumptions and make their decisions in an orderly way. It
encourages users to seriously think about the factors that effect value. I
would think that this thread would welcome the opportunity to discuss Value
Investing based on the fundamental factors that affect value, and not soley on
chat.

I'll try again. I believe all value investors use fundamental analysis in their
buying decisions. I believe mathematical models of valuation - those that
generate output numbers from input variables are inherently limiting (which I -
my opinion - find onerous), and often dangerous, especially if used by someone
other than the author of the model. Just opposite from you, I believe that
these models discourage serious thinking about factors which affect value
because: 1) focus is on determining the values of the inputs (which may/may not
be key aspect relevant to the specific security 2) are rote in their use 3)
give a false sense of security or no security, especially in down markets.
These are my opinions only, based on my experience. OF COURSE this thread
welcomes discussion of fundamental factors. Are you saying I am substituting
mere talk for fundamental analysis, especially organized, considered
(numerical) analysis? That is not correct. Everyone who is an investor by
fundamentals eventually IMO develops models for use in fundamental analysis. I
am saying that mathematical models beyond ratio analysis are a tool - - and for
me a very poor tool. On the other hand, if you have evidence that the VPA model
"works" (e.g. screens effectively, gives good buy/sell points, makes lotsa
money for its users), that's great. Let me in the door... I'll try it too

To All: Looks to me Value investing gets to much credit..you get
one Buffet who happened to get some picks right and at a time
every one else was go go dancing and that makes value investing
the rage from now on. Buffet was at the right place at the right
time and went aginst the crowd..and was right, from there on out
money makes money and he understood that.
---------------------------------------------
I'm tracking mutual funds, and if value investing is the thing
they don't show it. The value funds have done worse over all than
most of the growth funds, and the value fund managers
are pro's. and I turst can do as good as I can when it comes to
FA..so why has even good FA not worked a least not for this
past year ?
----------------------------------
I think primarly it's the dynamics of the "savings" and "retirement" money,
were this money goes, stocks go up, to leave this out of
the picture and just judge a stock buy value p/e or what have
you is to have a picture that is no were near compleat..and
can be very misleading as well. There is no real justice in the
market..nothing that says a good company with all the right things
going for it, won't get undercut..or forced out..a lot of cut
throut goes on, if it is not big enoung to fend off underhanded
attacks it better be very smart.
----------------------------------
One thing in general that seems to work is size..the big seem to
get bigger..that's maybe why large caps have done so well, and
the ones who can claim, or at least fake growth have done the
best, were many value stocks have declined , particularly the
Small cap value..has done so bad in the last year it's dishartening.
--------------------------------
In the last month the small caps have made a showing..many of them
up really good..in the Small cap grth some funds have shot up
as much as 20% in the last 30 days..remarkable as that is what
staggers my mind is that thoes same funds dispite that gain
are still down,some of them down as much as 25% from this time last
year, after the correction last July the market seemed to recover,
but it was just the large caps..the small caps not only did not
recover..they slowly got worse.
------------------------------
Why am I focasing on small caps, well by and large that is the only
sector left that has any value stocks in it. So much money was tossed
at the large caps and S&P 500 stocks it's hard to call them value
stocks.
--------------------------------
Will the value stocks make a come back, I think so as long as the
big boys don't crash..if the big boys just sort of level off
then the value stocks will make ground..if the big sell off it will
take them all down. Any more rate hikes will be a disaster.
----------------------------------
All in all , FA can't be ignored..but what I'm saying is it can't be
counted on either..the majority of money is in mutall funds..they
are calling the shots..they compeat for money..to do that they
compeat for profits..the funds doing the best last week had the
best money inflows..they bought stuff, what they bought went up
just from the buying..momentum players jumped in..up more..
as people get antsy about the big caps prices and put money in
what is called value funds, the the value stocks will kick in,
as some of them have recently..but I still think this has more
primarly with the inflow of money into the funds, than with the
FA of a stock..
----------------------
Last week;(5 days) S&P up 2.08%, SML Grth up 3.15%; SML Vlu up 1.66%
MId grth up 3.04% Mid valu up 2.26% ; Lrg Grth up 2.25% Lrg v 1.69%
( large value may be a misnomer..) as what was lrg value has already
gained so much that it's not fair to call them value.
NOTE: this is not data I got from somewere else, I generatated this
useing the NAVS of 147 funds, broke down into L M S, with sup grope
of each in GROTH and VALUE. These funds focas on a sector and are
not diversified..but they are generally the best preformers.
There is such a thing as over diversifaction..the manager loses
focas..and grabs and plays what the next guy plays. I think if
you want diversity "fine"..buy more than one fund buy into
several sectors, by all means stick with funds that focas
on a primary area, you offset that with having seveal funds
the broad based funds are over divesified not focased, and do
not do as well. It's just to much to think that any human can scan
the whole sector and pick as good as thoes who scan smaller sections.
The models I have looked at all seem to bear this out,
putting the same amount of money in each sector..and using the
specalized funds, so far has show improvment over
any one broad based fund I have found..the ( focased funds )
simply put pick better, and to have diversity "if" thats what
you want, use several funds, you still come out ahead.
NO-load funds don't always beat load funds, but as a grope they
do. IT takes a lot to make up for a 5% front or back load. The
results they seem to show off..does not take into account that
the 5% if put into a no-load would make money..so in effect that
5% becomes 5% plus the profit off of it , gone now and forever.
even in a not so hot fund that 5% adds up to the same as a 10%
charge in about 5 to 7 years. The load funds do not outprefrom
many of the new no-loads and hardly any ever as much as 10%
----------------------------------------
BACK to DATA:
In the last month the most dramtic changes were to Smal Grth, they
many of them were up 15 to 20%..this fast rise is subject to cause
some profit taking, but "it may not" as this is the sector that
never got over last years sell off..and has still to make up ground
to get back to were it was a year ago. Wall street indexes may not
show this, as they are greared to paint the picture a little more
rosy than it is. Small caps as a grope, have really trickled down
the whole time untill just recently.
----------------------------------------
In addition to tracking stocks, I started tracking funds, the specalized ones,
"to get a feel of were the money is flowing"..it's causeing me to question
every thing I thought I knew..so if you don't
see were I'm coming from, take it easy..we don't need to slam dumk
one another..my modles were not really working and some new ideas
had to be developed..and are still on-going, I'm just sharing
some newer thoughts, kinda as they take shape..nothing here is
written in stone..except the actual DATA..thats factual..but exactly
what it means , well the jury is still out on that.
Can't ignor FA, but can't count on it either..justice is for sale
to the higgest bidder..water don't always find it's own level, obsrutions, many
of them man made can be opened or closed, a good
boat can be beached and looted..the market is not an orederly
place were common sence prevails, if it held to rules then
almost every one would make money, and one not so much more
than the next, the market is more like a jungle.

Hi Paul - I agree with you on your comments about Value Investing and analysis.
IMO the reason is that it's become too easy to run a screening program that
dumps out the stocks that fit one's criteria. The difficult work is spending
the time researching the company's management, its products, and how they sit
relative to the competition and it seems people don't like to exert this kind
of effort but it's often the only way to ferret out the good value plays.

HI Paul: ALSO the ground I covered looks scarry to me, there is
a lot of hype to the market, when you peal the cover off for
yourself it's not a nice picture.
I'm using a magnifying glass on a grope right now, how can these
people look investers in eye..and tell the lies they tell..do
they really belive their own crap..that must be it.
In the Small Grth..I have 19 funds..going back just before last
summer sell off to June of 96..only 3 of these funds have made
money 16 are in the red, recent gains included.
take VWMCX went from 13.5 to 9..thats a 33% loss now back to
10.5..the kicker is to go from 9 back to 13.5..were it was
a year ago it has to gain 50% to make up for that 33% loss
it's gained 16% in a mounth..24% more to go to get back even
that don't give you a red cent profit..and it's just a mess
if 16 of 19 professionals are lossing money..in this sector
what chance do we have ?
There are some alfull stories..huge losses, swept under the rug,
retirement money gone..hundreds of thousands of people have been
skined..they seem to timid, or embarrased to talk of it..many of
them don't even know the money is gone..that with the market at
just about an all time high, how could this happen ?? how
in a bull market so many mutall funds go backwards ??
This is scary..and getting worse as I dig into it, does all that
market gain go to just feed the monster..in spite the gains
( investors ) who lost money outnumber the ones who gained,
and thats a fact..as the funds represent most of the investors
and most of them are down from last june to now..the monster
eats most of the gaines..commisions, spreads, and out right
thievery has taking the majority of the people who invest in the
market to the cleaners..to lose money is the rule, not the
exception, and that seems to be the fact of it, they hold up the big winners
like any body can do it..but you don't get the real numbers till you dig..and
nobody wants them..we prefer the dream..no matter the cost. At first running
these all these portfolios was fun,
adding up the numbers I was sure I'd find a combination to come
out a winner, now it's got depressing..even if I do find a winning
style..knowing that it has to be at the expence of so many people
don't make me feel good..if just a few lost and the average Joe
at least broke even, but with inflation and such, it's no way.
------------
The average Joe is better off in CDs, because in the stock market
the lossers just outnumber the winners, and in spite of a bull
market,. I know we would all like
to think we are above average..well to some extent I suppose
thoes of us that bang away and find our selves on SI..are going
to have an edge over the vast majority that just let some
broker do his thinking. All my life I heard how you have to look
out for used car sales men; hmmm they look like boy scouts compared
to this Wall Street gang. In my last note I may have hinted or
sounded like FUNDS was the way to go..well only if you do it
the way they don't want you to..check that fund every day..
and you have to do market timeing , or it's like if you don't
become a loser, you just got lucky.

To Paul / Stan and the thread
Ref: Value and recent postings

Value relative to what?? As I see it one can use various
FA database screens and come up with a list of stocks that
pass some canned statistical definition of " value " based
on balance sheet items; however the odds of the results
containing viable investment ideas vs future bankrupts
are probably 50-50. " Value " relative to specific company
past and future financial performance is probably more important
but harder to codify. Even Buffet has come to admit that identifying
the correct businesses to own is more important than the price paid
to buy in. James F. Hopkins' observations of the performance of
so called "value" funds is more telling of the absurd short term
performance standards that most active fund managers are held to
these days rather than a comittment or obligation to invest per
the fund prospectus.. Take a good look at what securities various
funds actually own you'll be amazed.

I try to utilize two Buffet principles in my own investments,
first identify simple understandable businesses with consistent
operational histories characterized by recurring revenue streams,
some barrier to entry, high returns on equity and low debt;
second, calculate CYOE ( current year owner earnings ) and have
the patience to wait for a price at or below CYOE before you buy.
Easy to say..hard to do!!

could be in and of the company (the stock) itself. So compared to where
Gillette has been (price of stock, cf/sh, bv, etc.) it's nowhere near
undervalued. On the other hand, consider someone posting on this thread saying
NVLS is undervalued or BS (that's the steel co -g-) is a screaming buy. I
always want to say... and some day I'm going to start saying it... "Okay, a
value compared to what? Tell me how many stocks did you screen, what other
stocks you looked at and did you reject, to come to the conclusion that NVLS or
whatever is just that one company we should all look at?" I've actually started
doing this for myself. Peter Lynch says somewhere (Worth Mag?) that if you look
at 5 co's you'll find 1 good idea, 50 will find you 10. I seem to screen now
about 15 for every stock I want to really look at, and about 1 of each of those
3 or 4 I actually buy. And my research methods and discipline are nowhere near
as good as some people's on this thread (for example, Jeff Maresh) And I

and profits made and stocks not purchased/opportunity profits forgone.)

Except for a SP500 index fund - that should be within .5% or so of the
SP500. Guess too many funds are underperforming the SP500.

GM

PS: there's another reason for NAVs being low: most funds have a distribution
near the end of the year. This means they give customers extra shares in lieu
of dividends. So to calculate total return of a fund, you have to know how many
shares they distributed.

Adding my .02 about goals. If your goal was to beat the S&P 500 you had to make
17.08% compounded over the past five years (if you were in the market for 5
years.) The average US stock fund did 13.65% (compounded 5-year annualized).
Data per Morningstar as of 5/23/97.

Morningstar chose 17 funds (why only 17 I don't know) which beat the average
stock fund but which Morningstar says took significantly less risk (than other
funds I presume). Only one fund beat the S&P. (Mutual Beacon) My point is if
your goal is to beat the S&P 500, you're apparently going to have to take on a
bunch of risk to do it.

Secondly, and I have had this discussion on other threads, my opinion is you DO
NOT have to beat the S&P 500 to make a heck of a lot of money in the market.
Even just equaling the S&P is IMO very very excellent (and tough to do outside
of an index fund - but that's another story.) The money you put in the market
in 1992 has doubled and more, the money you put in in 1993 has doubled and
more, and the monies invested in 1994, 1995, 1996 have also grown in value. Or
should have -g- if you just equalled the S&P. And if you just had the results
of the average stock fund... 13.65%, you made money too. And if you chose any
of the 17 funds by Morningstar you beat the average fund, made money, and had
less risk doing it.

1993 or 1992. Anyone investing monies in those years, even with the losses they
had in 1996, maybe still has a profit? The one fund you mentioned Van Wagoner
Micro Cap, I recall all the hoopla about it, the interviews on CNN, and the

of beating this benchmark by 1 1/2 and 1.9 percentage points in '96 and YTD,
respectively. With most mutual funds badly lagging, I feel pretty good about
this. Like others have mentioned here, my goal is to beat this benchmark. What

re: Baron and OLS. No idea why he sold or if entire position has been

go down and he is willing to buy more at lower prices. Plus, he holds for
several years apparently. If he revisited his situation after OLS dropped and
decided the Co. wasn't for him, maybe he did use current rise to sell. He knows
this business (temp. help bus). A big winner for him has been Robert Half which
he's held and added to for many years, I think. This is not a good sign for us
OLS holders. On the other hand, IMO, it is not a cause (for me) to sell (yet,
-g-). OLS has resources to come back, to stick with or change their business
model; and the stock reflects an okay price for long-term investors. IMO.

you, the Texas y'all - I am not speaking to a specific person.)

But something is wrong or at least confusing to me. How can people beat the S&P
in accounts overall or in IRAs in particular? Take IRA. There's no margin
there. There are two conditions: Either there is a cash/bond/money market
component or there is not.

If there is this non stock component, then for the IRA account, in total, to
beat the S&P, the stocks chosen had to have done fabuously well because the
cash/bond/etc. part can "only" contribute what... maybe 7-8%?

On the other hand, if there is only a stock portion (no cash,etc), then
everything must be invested in stocks. Wouldn't you say that is mighty risky
for a retirement account (okay, yes I don't know how much money we are talking
about here, how important the IRA performance is in a retirement plan, and that
I also don't know anyone's personal situation). Further, if anyone like me owns
OLS or stocks like OLS in a retirement account, you are in effect planting
seeds... no one actually expects stocks like this to do really well for a while
do they? You have to figure on at least a coupla years IMO. So to beat the S&P,
you are doing it with only a portion of your stock choices. Or else you you
don't buy stocks for their long term potential, but just for short term
performance. I think that's risky. I think the whole thing is risky. But what
do I know...it's a bull market and you guys are the ones making the money -g-
(Or maybe the S&P is only up a little so far this year??)

Hi Paul - Re: OLS - I've got a friend of mine in DC and he has first hand
experience with them. He is a management consultant and CFA and does great in
the market. I went long OLS about the same time he did last year purely by
coincidence. We had lunch recently and he stated he was accumulating and plans
to continue to accumulate. He stated that OLS has bought up so many temp
agencies in the area that they now dominate the market. Some of these agencies
still operate under the old names (not as Olsten) but Olsten does all the
training and management.

We both concluded that they are sacrificing short term earnings (perhaps for
1-2 years) to gain market share in the most lucrative areas. Like a true
gorilla company, they want to dominate entire markets and he stated that at
this point, they practically own DC and are still acquiring.

While I was a bit queazy about the prospects of their home health care business
because of all the political crap flying around DC about Medicare, he was more
sanguine. They spent a tremendous amount of money to get into that market and
the politicians are threatening to do things with Medicare that could damage
the home health care industry. Also, some hospitals are also adding their own
home health care services and cutting companies like OLS out of the picture.
This may be what spooked Baron. But on the positive side, they continue to sign
big exclusive or near exclusive deals with big HMOs. Like CIGNA last year,
which doesn't come out of the government pot.

Paul,

I'll try to answer a couple of questions you ask the
other poster. Hopefully, that will clarify my strategy for
myself too. :-) First of all, I don't consider myself a "value"
investor. But if I had to summarize my investment strategy
it would be close to a "value Buffett" approach:

- Understandable business (but not in Buffett sense: I am
comfortable with some semi-equipment companies, though
not with software companies or semi companies)
- Franchise value (high barriers of entry)
- Great balance sheet
- Low valuation (primarily PSR < 1.5-2)

How many stocks have I looked at? 100-200? I don't count.
I classify them, buy some and revisit others later -
especially the ones that were overpriced but excellent
companies.

It's not fair to ask whether some stock is
"a value compared to what". First, it's clear that somebody
who posts an idea, thinks it's a good one. Second, I would
be hardly pressed to say which of the stocks I own is
"a better value". If I knew, I would own only one stock. :-)

I try not to chase returns and especially not to
compare my returns to SP500 or some other benchmark.
I don't do window dressing, so my annual return may be
horrible on December 31 while it may be excellent
on January 5.

Sometimes I hold stocks for a long time and sometimes I
trade. But I think that having the stocks complying to
my selection criteria allow me to sleep at night. I don't
know how risky my portfolio is - it went down a lot this
April, but then SHVA went from $80 to $8 and hasn't
recovered yet. I found out that holding through the
corrections last summer and this spring worked well for
me. I don't know if the same strategy would work for
a big bear market.

You asked the other poster to give some stocks he owns.
My buy list is shrinking rapidly since April, but
there are still some interesting ideas out there.
I wanted to discuss NKE and PEP if anyone is interested.

Also if you want to discuss in more detail my approach,
let me know.

Good luck

Didn't mean to cause you angst, and must state that I have been VERY lucky in
that I have owned for a long time and large proportionally, big boys like GE

passive manner I've been helped. As to OLS, I am contrary to your thinking in
that you can make money in a short period of time if you buy it when it was
most disliked (it was below 14 back in November!) Yea, I guess the market is
risky, but I guess the true long term risk is not being in it and not beating
inflation. Stocks in an IRA are great depending on your age. Don't know your
age, but those just starting out are probably best served if they are as
aggressive as possible. Good luck to you and all OLS longs.

As for beating the S&P, I'm in small cap value mainly. I look back on the last
two years and think I'm an idiot, until I look at how small caps have done
relative to the S&P. That has got to turn around at some point. The guys who
get really creamed are the ones who change horses in midstream because a
strategy (of course, one that makes sense) has been inferior to another
strategy. I am very confident that two years from now I will be looking good
relative to any index. A cash flow is a cash flow, whether it is from a big
company which is outperforming (temporarily) or a small company which is
underperforming temporarily. The best way to lose money is to jump on the
bandwagon (i.e. buy the big companies now when you KNOW they are overvalued).
Stick with value, but just understand your time horizon has got to be long

Hi Raimondas: Yes, some- even many - stocks are like old girlfriends... they do
keep reappearing in your life... and sometimes (unlike ex-wives -g-) they are
better the second time around :-)

Nope, I disagree with you on asking people where they are coming from. People
taking the time to post I would agree think they have a good idea, but
sometimes I think they are in love with their picks or have just stumbled
across them with no evaluation or consideration of competitors or even
opportunities that meet their stated (or unstated) criteria. Sure it's up to
the readers to delve further into the specific stock that is mentioned, but I
just would like to add a little spice to the conversation - and maybe help me
and maybe the author - to see a little clearer a little quicker.

Okay let's talk about NIKE and PEP. I rejected PEP at 30, but old ladies I know
in investment clubs bought. So let's see, that's 7 good points or 20% this
year.... it's just sooo easy to beat the S&P -g-. But I don't get it; yes we
suspect they'll split out Burger King and KFC - when (if?) they announce... the
stock will jump again, I'd say (say it I will, bet on it I won't). How do you
describe PEP earnings... erratic? non-heading up, poor compared to KO?? PSR,
P/BV all high.

With NIKE, I passed on it at higher levels, and I think it's no bargain here
either. I'm a little fixated today on the Morningstar Buffett articles that
were mentioned earlier. I'm thinking I can't be sure where this company is
going to be in 10 years. Sneakers - aren't they fads - or if not faddish,
fashionable now, but in 3 years what? Does a brand like Nike on clothing have
some lasting value or worth paying up for its (NIKE's) multiple compared to
other clothing mfger's? Can't find a compelling reason to buy NIKE. JMO.

Here's a Buffett-type stock per the screen provided by Morningstar.

Of course if it were really a Buffett stock, Buffett would own it. Which he
probably doesn't. IGT = International Game Technology.

I went through all the stocks Morningstar provided in their articles about
Buffett criteria stocks, and I also reviewed the 10 top holdings of
Buffett/Graham funds listed by Morningstar in their Buffett report of last
week. I removed stocks from the list that I own already or were stocks in
industries in which I already have a position (e.g. skipped over Wells Fargo
because I already own others somewhat similar). Then I censored out all the
stocks that were selling near their high (Valassis Comm, Brown Forman, Franklin
Resources) or were in businesses that I completely don't understand (Comcast,
Tele-Comm TCA, 360 Communications) or idosyncratically don't like what little I
do know (AmEx). What's left... for me anyway is my unenthusiatic choice of IGT.
I've been looking at CSDS - Casino Data Systems. It's losing money, but sales
are starting - seems like - to pick up and there's some fundamental value at
the PSR and p/bv. Still IGT is the dominant player.

P/B = 3.6 absolutely high, but low compared to past
PSR = 2.8 absolutely high, but similar to past
earnings up and down, but since '91 pos. and doubling since '92
sales = near doubling since '92
d/e = 17%
and of course for Buffett types: high ROE ....17-19% last 2 yrs.

price of stock is closer to its low than its high.

What I don't like:
Small competitor has come out with a hit competitive product (slot game).
The big rush to casino gambling may be cresting... at least in USA
Something is not right - and maybe it's with me. I won't buy one of these
companies if they are selling at their high price. Yet I am concerned about
buying a company near its low price. After all, this is a bull market we're
supposedly in... so what's with IGT (and the casino stocks in general)?

What I've done: Bought a tiny amount to refocus my attention.

Ha, the only enthusiasm I can generate for IGT right now is that I like it more
than NIKE or PEP!

Paul,

You are right in saying that you should check
where people are coming from. I will listen to you,
Jeff Maresh, Andrew Vance much more than I will listen to
Joe Schmoe. However, a quick check on a stock
takes only 2 minutes: go to Yahoo, click on quote and
profile. That screens off most of the picks, so I do it with
most stocks that are mentioned. For the rest, I already either
know them, or I know that they are junk (Bre-X? :-))
Now, the second and the third rounds of checking take longer.

There are a couple of people that I listen to
even if I discard the stock in my 2 minute check.
I don't necessarily buy it, but I regard their suggestions highly
enough to do a second level check.

Now for PEP and NKE. Both are running out of my
tentative buy zone. PEP - the short story is that it's a
great chips (Frito Lay) and soft drinks franchise.
The restaurant spin-off should leave the company with
less debt and a great positive cash flow. Even assuming
that their growth will not be outstanding, they will be able
to spend the cash in debt pay-off and share buybacks.
The problem is that the PSR was 1.9 recently and
EVSR (Market cap + debt / sales) was around 2.5. So I would
buy it at $30, but not heading to $40.

NKE currently is a global juggernaut. They have
outstanding management that has burried all competition.
They have a global outreach. They have a brand name that goes
to everything - not only sneakers, but clothing, equipment, etc.
The "swoosh" is cool and will remain so both in US and in the
rest of the world. The company reminds me of KO.
I personally don't like the NKE's CEO approach, but he got
results and will get even better results in the future.
Of course, PSR was 2 at $55, which is rich for me. It seems that
this will run away too.

Now for my favorite question: "Where this company is going
to be in 10 years?" Nobody knows. Buffett is deceiving himself
if he thinks he knows. Read the story of his favorite Gillette.
It was almost burried when BiC introduced the low cost
disposable blades. Only the ingenuity of the management
saved the company - the company went for the high end of
the market, saving both brand name and margins. But this story
indicates that all companies: KO, PEP, G, IBM, NKE, DJ, might
go to dumpster if their management changes or makes a mistake.
Notice that some of the great franchises already went that way.
Of course, you can claim that KO will survive and
prosper with greater probability than some generic
fast food restaurant. I don't disagree with that. But I think
that NKE is closer to KO than to a generic fast food restaurant.

Finally, if you're interested another two companies
from my shrinking buy list: METHA and WDHD. Both
manufacture bits and pieces. Both have high margin niches.
Both are pretty cheap. And in both cases I can't figure out
how much they will grow and whether they will retain the
profitable niches. Ideas and explanations welcome.

Good luck

Plus, with the proposed curbs on advertising, MO will do even better. Mention

"increased their dividends over the last 10 years". Exxon is an excellent
comapny and provides a very good hedge against inflation/sharp market decline.
To put it in another way...let's say its 1915 and there is a buggy whip company
that has increased its dividend 10% every year for the last 15 years. Would you
still buy it? Don't try to make investing a science, its more an art, IMHO.

As a matter of fact, Exxon happens to be a Dividend Achiever! So we happen to
agree on that one.

And re: your query, yes, the strategy would have led me to invest in a buggy
whip company in 1915, but remember, I would have gotten out anytime they didn't
increase their dividend! So I would be out of the buggy whip stock long before
the company went bankrupt. In order to get back on my screen, they would not
only have to survive the next 10 years, but also increase their dividends
during every one of those years!

Yes, investing is more a craft than a science. However, I would like to define
my boundaries using strategies like this (and the "Dow Dogs" (again, Exxon is
one of the current Dow Dogs!), "Dogs of the S&P" strategies, and the
Cornerstone Growth and Value strategies proposed by James O'Shaughnessy).

I believe following strategies like these keeps me on track and prevents me
from chasing the "fad of the moment". I would rather leave the "craft" (or art)

But Dipy, that is the art...figuring out what is fad and what is a solid
long-term investment. It is almost possible to turn this into a "near science".
Figure out what adds value to business in a general sense. If a company can
make another more productive and increase margins, both prosper. The "fad"
ideal sounds Buffetesque. Times change, so should investment ideals (nothing
against Warren, he is a brilliant man with a proven track record...but times
are not the same today as 30 years ago). I don't believe in following other's
paths...you have to combine knowledge of other successes/failures with your own
style to get ahead in investing. Never forget that those who fail to heed
history are doomed to follow in its faliures, but don't be afraid to branch off
and explore new territory. I own KO, XON, MRK, ADM, PFE, SGP,FRE, AHP, MCD,
GPC, ADM, SLE but I also own CSCO, INTC, COMS, SEG (newly added), SUNW, and
TMO. All have a specific role in my investing philosophy. Not all pay
dividends, nor should every investment especially from a tax perspective. Some
are pure growth. Consider a non-dividend paying stock to be a zero-coupon bond.
The bond pays a higher return because it carries greater risk. At some point in
the future, you cash out...much like a zero coupon being called or coming due.
Like a tax-free muni, you pay no taxes while the investment grows. Every
portfolio, IMO, should have some of these non-dividend paying stocks to
maximize returns.

It's obvious that you are a very experienced investor. But me, I am quite
inexperienced. I feel that beginners should stick to value investing and as
they gain experience, should begin investing gradually in growth stocks,
attaining a reasonable balance by the time they have about 5 years' experience
(which incidentally, is the duration of a typical market-cycle).

Growth investing can generate higher rewards but also involves higher risks.
And for a beginner, especially in a mother-of-all-bull-markets like this one,
it is quite easy to forget the risks and look only at the rewards.

I agree that a balanced investing philosophy like yours is wonderful but I also

Raimondas: Concur with your summary of METHA and WDHD. WDHD seems to be a
cyclical with good ROE past few years -- maybe now at peak - stock hitting new
highs. Too hard for me to analyze easily. More so hard with METHA. (Maybe the
fact that info is a little more difficult to get gives someone an advantage who
takes the time to look closely.) There's a Methode thread on SI which I reread.
(Passed on the stock @ 14 range - didn't see the opportunity for me then and
can't see what's changed at this higher stock price.)

These two stocks are interesting to me because, if nothing is fundamentally
different from a few months ago, they anecdotally (i.e. not statistically)
support my belief that we (or at least I) am not in a bear market for small cap
stocks.

Thanks for the reminder about KO and G and others. Market dominant they are,
but they have no lock on the future. Maybe at these prices, investors are
thinking they will always be on top, always do well in any environment. But as
you say, some of these companies, maybe all, have had critical junctures, and
not all that long ago.

I'm with J.Clarke on looking at cigarettes for the 10 year horizon. If people
can be get themselves addicted, then maybe there's a sustainable competitive
advantage or lock or whatever you want to call it.
