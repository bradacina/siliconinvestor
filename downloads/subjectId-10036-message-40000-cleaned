ok once again you have forced me to do more research. I conclude that CCCL is a
small player in a very large market. I believe that they produce less than 1/2
of 1 percent of china tile production, which produces something like 60% of the
world production according to at least one source. chinese tile production has
been growing at double digits for the past 6-7 years or so.

They are issuing more shares in order to expand production so clearly they
believe that they can sell this additional production. so far looking at their
exports I see that there is not export to north america so perhaps they will
expand there in the future. Bottom line this seems to be a cheap stock but
there is not a moat like there is with gfre. I dont see any evidence of fraud
either.

re CCCL
>>ok once again you have forced me to do more research.<< <g>

I don't know if CCCL is a fraud. I said maybe, which really does not say much
with respect to Chinese microcaps.

I did go through the filings and looked for what I considered BS statements.
The brand name value is surely one of them that is fairly obvious. The other
one is that CCCL claims to concentrate on Tier II and Tier III cities. But even
if that were the case, if the RE building boom in Tier I cities stops, the tile
market would still break down just about everywhere since tiles are more or
less a commodity.

CCCL like many other Chinese microcaps has a 4 layer cooperate structure with
two holding companies between the US subsidy and the Chinese operating company
(one HK holding and one offshore (Cayman)). Again this does not prove of imply
fraud, it just makes it more convenient for management and virtually assures
that in the case of cases nothing will be left for shareholders.

Hi Jim -

I have WPZ on my MLP watch list. The company carries a lot of debt which seems
to be typical of these midstream companies. You might also check out EPD as
they have gathering & processing operations in the same area.

Enterprise Products Partners L.(NYSE: EPD)
Williams Partners L.P. Common U(NYSE: WPZ)

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=EPD,WPZ&d=s

I started a small position in EPD in October and will add more if prices drop
10%. Based on the forward PE's of both companies WPZ seems to be the best value
(but still a bit expensive). I will look at a starter position in WPZ on a 5%
drop in the $42.00-$43.00 price range.

I really like the sector especially for it's growth potential. I wonder if
there might be a better play by finding those E&P companies that have built
their own gathering and processing facilities and are ready to sell their JV
interests to a larger operator. Usually they sell up to a 50% interest which
requires the JV partner to make a large lump sum payment. Usually the small E&P
developer will rally on such an announcement and the JV partner is able to lock
in more capacity for their distribution & processing operation(s).

Any thought of some names of smaller E&P developers in the region that have
built (or are building) their own gathering & processing system(s) that might
be ready to sell to a larger operator? I think this is where the value is
hiding.

seems to be that the landscape has changed for them because now that there is
overcapacity in the shipping business the shippers are looking to cut costs
anyway they can and a big component of that is fuel. on another conference call
with a ship owner and carrier i heard that they had reduced speed in order to
conserve fuel and im sure others are doing the same which contributes to fuel
oversupply and reduced spreads. i expect these cost saving measures to continue

CSCO is an interesting speculation as historically the company has outperformed
the market and is strong financially. But I think, at best, it's a market
performer and I'm not crazy about the valuation of the market.

A couple of points.

The downgrades haven't started. Yahoo lists thirty-five analysts rating CSCO as
a buy or strong buy. Only three list the company as underperforming. I suspect
that ratio will change.

One of the reasons Chambers listed for the drop was orders from state
governments. The continued budget problem by state governments won't change any
time soon.

"Everyone in the world will probably see government spending" fall, said Mr.
Chambers in an interview, adding that "we were surprised how quickly it
occurred." About the decline and softness in Europe, Mr. Chambers said: "I
don't think those are specific to Cisco at all."

Declining margins suggests increased competition. Decreased demand will
increase price cutting for the remaining business. Hardware is a commodity and
I think there will be more companies chasing a smaller piece of the pie.

I don't think a US Core Equity fund in a family of funds is a fair way to
evaluate his company's performance. GMO has lots of funds. The question is
where money is allocated.

http://biz.yahoo.com/p/fam/gmo.html

The strength of his commentary is his asset allocation and his macro-view on
what is going on in the US economy. Much of this has been said before (emerging
markets, commodities) but you don't hear many people saying that cash still has
value even though the fed is trying to make your money worthless. I also
thought his views that lowering interests to nothing could actually hurt the
economy as it takes away from savers who would otherwise have money to spend.
Regardless, I found it valuable as I have raised cash levels and don't find the
market particularly inviting at this point.

BDC. I still have concerns about bdc's. However, everything is price-related,
and with bdc CODI down today on its share offering, I will somewhat fearfully
up my shares a significant amount.

1. CODI acquires and controls small businesses. Therefore, unlike many other
bdc's, CODI should have insiders knowledge of their investments. More
significantly, CODI controls the future of their businesses, i.e. when it might
be time for CODI to sell the companies in its portfolio.

2. CODI current share price is above stated book value, so in that sense
current holders are not diluted by the share issuance.

3. Of course there's the good annualized distribution $1.36 on a now $16.70
stock, which translates to about 8%.

4. According to the company there's no significant debt that matures before
2012. And the debt level doesn't look excessive to me.

5. The key reason I'm willing to add now and to this particular stock is that
among all the bdc's I follow and have followed, CODI is one of the few which
has not cut its distribution in the 2007-2010 time period. If the distribution
can hold, I expect there to be a margin-of-safety with the stock at current
price. (Of course, in a down market like we've seen and might see again, that
expectation might be very wrong.)

Hello Madharry,

Are you still in SD? I'm considering starting a position in this stock, but
wondered what your thoughts were.

I guess I'd like to add to CHK or start positions in SD or BEXP. These natural
gas plays are seeing some acquisition activity but are still at low stock price
levels. I'm not sure if Natural Gas prices will go higher, but I like the fact
that companies like CHK and SD are moving more into Oil drilling as the price
of oil goes up and ng goes down. That should help the earnings of these
companies as well as help the price of ng itself if enough drilling switches.

Any thoughts on this? I already own a bit of CHK and I'm not necessarily super
excited to add more there. SD has a lot of debt from their recent acqusition,
but also a lot of oil. I think, for example, that SD is producing oil per day
at around the same rate as ATPG is now.

So far my impression was that WEB in his early days was solely a value investor
buying very cheap stocks and cigar buts at time. it appears however that his
early success was in part due to him playing a very active role in realizing
the value, which is more of an activist investors approach. He acquired a large
enough stake to directly influence the boards. That way he could realize the
value much quicker, which is just about the only way to get 30% annualized
returns. otherwise with cigar buts you can wait for years until something
happens to unlock value.

CSCO may indeed go back to $16-$18. If it does, then we will have to revisit
our diversification discussion and how crazy I am to have CSCO as 10-20% of my
portfolio. :)

I've been thinking a lot about normalized earnings and cash flow in this
environment. We saw how some companies went from eps per share of $1 in 2007
down to a loss of a $1 or worse in the recession. So, when we're looking to
apply p/e ratios to companies, what eps value should we use? The one from the
growth period or the one to come in the next recession? Anyways, I'm not quite
at a point where I have a systematic view of this, but I do think that if I'm
looking at two value plays right now with decent p/e ratios and one still had
solid earnings and cash flow through the recession, while the other didn't, I'd
rather pickup the one that was solid. And that's what leads me to these big
techs like CSCO.

Anyways, no need to talk me down on lack of diversification yet with CSCO. :) I
have more MSFT currently, but under $18 will have my buying more.

I am not a prognosticator, so I have no clue if CSCO will go to $16 or not. If
it was cheap here at $20, I would buy it now without thinking whether it will
drop more or not. However, for me - and that's just for me - it's not cheap
enough yet. So I'm not buying, but I gave a price range where I would relook.
;)

For company to get to 10-20% of my portfolio, it should be very cheap. Not
saying that this means a guaranteed success - in fact some of my former big

guess I should be careful not to grow my positions by buying into value traps.

Hello Madharry,

Yeah, that's kind-of my read on SD also. My hunch is that these companies
really need to be in bad shape to be pushed into bankruptcy, given the amount
of reserves they have in the ground that could either be leveraged for
borrowing or sold.

That being said, it's got to be hard to feel really confident about any of
these companies either with the price of ng going down so hard for so long.
But, if SD can do one of these 3:

1) Continue to move into Oil prodution aggressively
2) Get lucky with a bounce in ng price
3) Sell some NG assets at favorable prices

then they could pare down their major debt and turn around the stock price. I
think I like SD's chances to do that, so I may add shares, but I'm not going to
make it a major position at this point.

Thanks for your thoughts.

Hello Madharry,

Good point about tech companies. In the early 2000's, before I was involved in
value investing, I was more of a 'Gorilla Game' investor and followed the
associated threads and stocks here on SI. I think part of the reason I'm into
CSCO, INTC, and MSFT over other techs is that they are gorilla stocks, with the
idea being that their products have incredible stickiness.

Maybe you're right that INTC, CSCO, and MSFT's products could be replaced
someday, that's possible. But, I don't see it happening in the next 5 years and
I do think that the stickiness of their products in the meantime allows me to
somewhat gauge a normalized earnings at least for these 3 companies. But, good
point in general...

Jurgis,

Yes, point taken. I've only got about a 5% position in CSCO at this point and I
would definitely think hard about taking any position to the 10-20% position.
Right now, the company is still holding to it's 12-17% long-term earnings
growth targets. If those rates are right, I think this company is undervalued,
and would be more at 16 (and I would add at least some shares there,
definitely), but if the company can't hit even 12%, the value proposition gets
trickier.

I've only had a 10% position in one stock in recent years, and that was ATPG
when I initially built a strong position before the oil spill. But, I was very
uncomfortable at that point given ATPG's risks, and I reduced my position
quickly. I think I would only go back to a 10% position in a stock that I was
certain had virtually no bankruptcy risk.

came out with an exciting revolutionary product despite all their billions. I
remember 4 years ago I met a computer consultant and Microsoft was coming out
with some new program and i asked her what she thought of and she told me that
she tried to avoid using microsoft products as they were more costly than less
costly or sometimes free products.

That is why I am more comfortable with goog ibm and even yahoo. Despite all the
disparaging remarks about yahoo. I use it daily, and I love their chinese

Williams to buy Bakken oil acreage for $925 million
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Williams-buy-Bakken-oil-rc-3327921804.html?x=0&.v

From the article:"...Natural gas producer and pipeline company Williams Cos Inc
(WMB.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) agreed to acquire about 86,000
acres in the oil rich Bakken shale for $925 million, in a bid to minimize
impact of weak gas prices on its bottomline...."

===================================================================

That's $10,755/acre. The price per acre is getting pretty expensive. I wonder
if they are late to the party of they have other revenue streams they are
considering (like gathering, processing & transportation) in this transaction.

Hi Jim -

I wonder if WPZ will be involved w/ this investment. WMB may structure the deal
where WPZ develops and operates the gathering & processing side.

Williams Buys $925 Million Stake in Bakken Oil Play
http://noir.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=ahV_BopY_ybI
From the article:"...The property has potential reserves equivalent to 185
million barrels of oil in the Middle Bakken and the Upper Three Forks
formations, Williams said in a statement today. The property has 24 existing
wells producing 3,300 barrels of oil a day, the company said.

“They are getting production with the acres, so it’s actually a better deal
than it looks on a per-acre basis,” said Lasan Johong, a New York-based analyst
for RBC Capital Markets who rates the shares “sector perform” and owns none.
“It’s in the core of the Bakken.”

<snip>

"...RBC calculates Williams is paying about $8,000 a net acre when production
is included, less than Enerplus Resources Fund agreed to pay in September for
leases in the same area, he said...."

===================================================================

The adjusted price paid per acre turns out to be a potential "Value" price.

They always seem late to the party with their land acquisitions. It's one of
the reasons why their ROA for the exploration business is so low and does not
earn it's cost of capital, imo.

I had hoped that the new CEO coming from the better run midstream part would
change directions and put the exploration business either in runoff mode or
sell it. So far no dice (Disclosure: I don't hold WMB right now).

FWIW I really like WPZ long term but am not in a rush to invest as I would have
to sell something first.

The article makes the case that the value is more in the WMB side.

Why do take an exponential factor like growth rate and apply it in a linear

Hello Dan,

Good question. I don't always use it, but I think it's useful for these 3
companies that may have more dependable future growth rates than others. It's
loosely based on the PEG ratio which is equal to price to earnings/annual eps
growth. If that ratio is less than one, then in general, a stock might be
perceived to be undervalued. If it's greater than 1, then perhaps overvalued.
So a rough cut at valuation for me is to assume that a fair valuation for these
3 would be a PEG ratio of 1. Therefore, I take eps and multiply it by the
projected future growth rate to get a fair value rough cut.

A good question for the group is whether others use this or not? I use this
more for growth at a reasonable price plays.

Thanks,

I was alway curious about that methodology. does that it mean it is predicting

Good points, Madharry.

1) My view is that if I were to go do an Net Present Value calculation on
discounted cash flows, that anything beyond 10 years or so doesn't mean too
much. So, I tend to use a 5-year growth projection hoping that will be long
enough to be material in the calculation.

2) Regarding a tail-off in growth, I think you'd have to just choose an eps
estimate and then from that estimate, project a growth rate to get your end
value. So, it's your projection that means a lot to the calc, and that
projection can be hard to make, I agree. But, I think future growth rate has to
go into any value estimate, so whether we use this formula or not it's still
tricky.

3) For these companies, since I'm adding in cash at the end, I think I'd have
to pull out the cash I add at the end if I thought it were to decrease to get
the projected growth rate.

4) If options were material, they'd have to factor in somehow. I will admit to
not paying enough attention to options in any of my investments no material
what formula I'm using. :)

Hi Jim -

I would definitely not short WPZ like the author suggest. In fact I am tempted
to up my position in WMB based on their 76% ownership interest in WPZ. The
article goes on to state that WMB's E&P business is grossly undervalued.

From the article:"...Williams Companies’ E&P business is valued by the market
at just $2.7 billion. We think it’s is actually worth $9 to $24 billion, even
with sustained low natural gas prices....".

That translate to $12.00/share to $35.00/share UNDEVALUED!

Is WPZ so overvalued that one would short it? No way!

When I looked at WPZ based on your earlier post, I concluded that WPZ had the
smallest debt structure (even though high to my liking) than several of the
other competitors. The key to valuating these midstream companies are their
steady cash flows. The author uses 15x forward year cash flows as his valuation
factor. I also like to factor in an adjustment for LT debt. WPZ has much less
LT debt than EPD for example. Therefore, I still would not short WPZ even as a
hedge to owning the parent company WMB in his example. I may now look at some
of my other "pure" midstream MLP's to sell (ie. DPM or EPD) but if I sell I
would roll the proceeds into WMB (remember every share of WMB you buy, you get
.76 interest in WPZ).

WPZ could be a buy for me if the price is 10% lower but I like WMB better.

From the recent run up in many of these midstream MLP's, it is interesting to
wonder why WMB is not much higher even with the recent announcement that the
CEO is going to retire. How long can their WPZ assets and/or their other E&P
holdings remain so hidden from the market's real valuation?

I never short and consider WPZ a long term buy. Valuable article none the less.
The reason I like WPZ is the growth potential with very long lived assets. A
value that will be apparent in the next down cycle in the economy. I like MLP's
in general but am willing to let cash build in the near term as the asset class
has had quite a run.
WMB on the other hand might be worth some risk capital that is not designated
for cashflow. I am heavily biased on dividends or distributions but will
consider value propositions if I can generate return with options.
If WMB's intrinsic value is such that I can afford to wait for the value to be
recognized I would not mind owning and selling calls. It might seem illogical
since WMB is one way to own WPZ on the cheap and I recognize it as such.
Companies that pay cash to owners have been on a tear this cycle and not sure
when it will be over played.
I am sure like all things it will be.

re YHOO - I use yahoo daily too, because it is my portal and I like

The portals have been replaced by facebook as the goto space. These facebook
guys clearly know how their customers are using their product. I think they
will get even more exposure and relevancy if their new email/messaging product
works out. Even now the facebook messaging is fairly powerful - my wife used it
as a replacement for texting for example. you can basically text via facebook
from phone to phone (even internationally) and avoid all charges as long as
both parties have a facebook account.

Yahoo has lost track how their customers use their software. I for example
still use yahoo classic email more than 2 years after the launch of their new
product simply because the new email was slow and hung up on my many times.
They messed up their message boards, search is gone and now outsourced. Only a
hollow front without any original engineered software is left and the new

EKS. I've added to my position in MPET recently, and may add more.

I can make a case for it as a value buy based on its assets.

Issues: Although Australian-based, they're changing their focus away from being
an "energy production company" in Australia into a developer of "strategic
reserve positions". And when a company evolves like this, there's always risk.
Significantly, the company needs a cash infusion through debt or equity to pay
for its recent Evans Shoal nat gas field acquisition (off north shore
Australia). So maybe stock dilution is forthcoming and with that, a drop in
stock price.

I'm attracted to this stock for its Montana holdings, and because I can see
some indication that the stock sells below fair value.

I find it interesting that the company of all things holds drilling rights to
some shale prospects in England (south of London). Their partner is currently
drilling one well there now I believe. (Previous wells have been abandoned.)

re GFRE: Skimming through the annual report I noticed that they did not buy
back a single share under the buyback program announced in September. The
buyback was announced mid September and the release numbers are per 0/30/2010,
so not much time was available for a buyback although prices in that timeperiod
were clearly favorable.

Also, given the fact that they are not shy about publicity, i'd expect that
they announced if buybacks have commenced after 9/30 anyways.

This is not good, management does not do, what it says it would do, imo. What
they don't say (any word about buybacks) can be more important than what
actually talk about.

Another thing that was noted about Chinese reverse merger companies is that
they have incredibly low G&A expenses. For examples GFRE's G&A expenses are
only ~1M$/Q which are just 2.2% of their 44M$ in revenues. No company that I
now if can run on G&A expenses that low unless maybe it is involved in
wholesale trading. This is strange at the very least considering their top
heavy holding company structure with 3 holding company layers on top of the
operating subsidies.

As you can tell, I am still somewhat skeptical of GFRE's numbers.
