That and .50 will get you a small coffee (not at Starbuck's, though).

Brendan Watt: re TOY

Diversification into kids-r-us, babies-r-us seems like a natural progression
for them. From what I can tell (anecdotal-- from some family members), prices
are competitive to very good with their kids' clothes. Given they are still the
killer in their segment (toys), new mgmt, new ways of buying (supply chain
mgmt), selling (internet), and delivering--- stock price point here suggests
buy (to me anyway -g-). Of course, as I've stated, TOY does have their troubles
too. Paul

Paul, my understanding gained from Merrill Lynch research of 3/26/98 was that
changes were to the flagship stores (obviously, complaints about kidsRus and
babysRus are not going to be voiced by me).

>>>>>>>>>
Some categories to be added to all stores will be those that
did well in the larger KidsWorld stores. These are candy,
portrait studios for kids, and reintroduction of apparel....
each new focus area will pit the company
against very well established competition where the
company has less "customer authority" than its main toy
area....

Though the market has been in a pronounced decline for a week and a half, and
though most stocks are already in a bear market, today was the first real fear
I have seen as an institutional investor. Getting calls from brokers asking
"what's going on, when are you going to buy" (and laughing at them, reminding
them of the fate of their last buy recommendation!). Its fun being a value
investor on a day like today, being totally at peace with the world. ABC News
led with the stock market story tonight, which is usually the sign of a bottom.
But unlike before, they didn't have the soundbite of the expert saying "buy the
dips", they had a soundbite of the expert saying "diversify [read: sell] now".

I think this may be the big one. (And by that I mean a 30-40% decline) - we're
talking a Dow with a 5 or 6 in front of it. To me it looks very different from
past dips. The valuations were extreme then, but you still had profit growth.
When you cut through the smoke, what you are looking at now is a market trading
at more than 20 times earnings, when nobody can make a credible argument for
profit growth more than low single digits. Sure, interest rates are low, but a
high multiple assumes both low interest rates and double digit profit growth.

Tomorrow probably starts just as today did, with buying on the dips - a relief
rally (the Dow started up 60 points today and finished down 300). If tomorrow
starts down (Asia is going to be brutal overnight, so it very well may), then
Houston, we've got a problem. Three times in this decline, the smug "buy the
dips" guys have bought their dips and gotten smacked. Eventually they either
run out of cash or confidence, then look out below. I'm having fun with this.
My boss was very upset with me today because I was having so much fun watching
the market go down. I missed the November crash last year because I was on
vacation - I didn't even know about it until the next afternoon when I saw an
Italian newspaper with the headline "Il Crashico" or something like that.

Though admittedly, I've said this before just before the market rebounded to
new highs...

And...Amazon was up today. Go figure.

Brendan: re tracking large portfolio.

Yes, I have a large (in number of positions) portfolio. Possibly approaching
100 issues. I try to keep turnover low - even in tax-deferred accounts I plan
to hold issues at least one year or more. Sometimes I'll trade within a
position though (buying/selling while maintaining a core holding amount). I
only very, very rarely sell short, and never use options. My portfolios are all
unbalanced (i.e., the stocks in them are not equally weighted). I have one
Buffett stock which I bought when it was inadvertently (IMO) mentioned by him.
(I've posted my story on this stock here before.) This stock, over the past
years, has performed Buffett style --so I find myself with very outsize profit
gains - which I trim occasionally --and which always has been the wrong thing
to do for maximizing profits, but I just can't live comfortably knowing so much
of my financial future is with one stock (albeit one VERY good stock).
Similarly, I have some very outsize positions in pharmaceutical stocks, bought
I thought, when they were value stocks.

Most of my positions and watch lists are up in portfolios in Yahoo.
They asterisk latest news for each stock. Very easy to get latest info and
quotes. I don't know of an alert signal to notify me of new highs/lows in these
stocks. (If I had such a signal, I'd use it). My brokerage accounts all provide
telephone access for quotes, and I use this feature during the day when I'm not
near my computer to check on prices. The biggest issue for me with such a large
portfolio is finding the point at which to focus on a particular stock. I own
stocks that go up, yet I don't focus enough on them when they are at this up
stage... but they surely get my attention as they slip back down -g-. On the
other hand, sometimes this has worked to help me. For example, I own a small
position in IBM, others. Not sure where I bought IBM-- $50 after the split
maybe-- I wonder if I would have been able to hold if I had seen every news
item, every brokerage downgrade, upgrade, article on accounting, future biz.
prospects.
Same with other stocks I own but choose not to follow so closely... just want
to give them time to work out and not get myself sucked into the day-do-day
excitement/depressions that occur. (I would say I have about 10 stocks like
this that I only rarely check on.)

I try to be very clear about the stocks I include in a particular portfolio. I
have a conservative (I think) relative-dividend model portfolio, a strict (I
think) value portfolio, and a miscellaneous portfolio. This gives me an
opportunity to catch different stocks/industries/investment styles as they go
in/out of favor. For example, having bank stocks (rel.div and misc) and
experiencing their profit rise (until today anyway -g-)protects or offsets
declines in recent purchases of value stocks.

The overarching focus is the bottom line value of each portfolio. Because of
this, I don't get so wrapped up, panicky, whiny with a particular stock or
stocks if it or they decline 50% or more. Obviously though, in this bear
market, with many mid/small cap stocks declining as well as the overall
market... I too would be focused on confirming exactly where and why each stock
is in each portfolio.

This approach seems to work okay for me. Obviously, we all have different goals
and outlooks, so different ways of investing too. My summary for my way of
value investing would be: if you've found a stock that's a good percentage
below what you think is fair value, buy it. Don't overbuy-- there are, and will
ALWAYS, be other opportunities. Add them when you find them too. Don't trade
out of a position because you think you've found something better. Save trading
up for your cars and women (or men, depending on preference, or neither if
married -g-). It's too difficult to predict the time, the if-and-when that will
make a value stock pop up to fair value. Once you buy an undervalued stock,
give it time to show.

Hope this helps somewhat, Paul

It seems to me that a large decline has already taken place. The only
difference being that the blue chips are now being hit. I agree with Mike.
Deswell is a company that has done nothing wrong so far and it just keeps going
down. I think it dropped over 15% on volume of a little over 20,000 shares.
What is that? margin calls? This is a company with cash that pays a nice
dividend. As long as it keeps paing a good dividend I think it should hold up
better long term than the US dollar. But what do I know?

Whoa Paul,lets look at the facts. You, I and Jeffery Bash may be the few who
lived through the 60s and 70s markets. I believe Jeffery's caution is well
founded, but agree with you that prudent buy decisions are still warranted
since inaction may be more costly than action. First the facts from recent
history based on a rather imprecise reading of yahoo charts(log scales hard to
read). During 87 bear, dj65 down 25%, Russell 2000 down 38%. During gulf war
correction, dj65 down 17 1/2 % and Russell down 28%. Russell may not represent
value stocks but sure is a good proxy. Moreover, no one under 40 has ever seen
a bear market. The recent experience of the nikei may be closer to a true bear.
Here is another interesting fact, the nikei dipped twice in the past 5 years
,22 1/2% and 27 1/2 % , recovering and dipping, the behavior of a secular bear.
Guess what over priced (p/bv,etc) Toyota did during these dips? Down only 5 and
11 %. Every good mutual fund manager in Japan feels that he must own Toyota. So
if my reading of Jeffery is right the premise is that IF, big IF, a real bear
comes along then value holdings are not immune. In fact it is my opinion that
if the stocks being held are not quality companies they will be hit harder than
microsoft, intel and cisco. Quality and diversification are key attributes of a
good investment program.

re: question yesterday about NH. At least three or four of us own this puppy. I
talked to a senior executive today, and they are just baffled by how the market
is treating this industry. They see flat sales in the next year or so, but they
absolutely do not see a massive downturn coming. Pricing has firmed up a little
bit since Deere and Case called a truce in late June.

As for finance receivables, he said companies in the tractor industry get in
trouble when they get greedy and lend outside of agriculture. Farmers tend to
be good credit risks, with land value backing the collateral and the government
often willing to bail them out in a crisis. If problems were to develop, it
would probably be residual value assumptions. If the market were to fall apart,
used tractor pricing falls and the assumptions grounding some loans could turn
out to be overstated. New Holland is about as conservative as a management can
be, and my instinct is that that conservatism extends into their credit
portfolio. Deere is also rock solid. Worry about Agco.

Hope that's a little bit helpful. Bottom line is that management thinks their
stock, as well as Deere, is very very cheap. And there is no reason to question
this management team's intergrity or ability.

I agree with your view and would emphasize that what happens in this kind of
market is not that we compromise on what is value (PSO was value, for example)
but we compromise on quality (PSO is not quality).
That compromise can be dangerous if a selloff were to continue - a second tier
stock at a P/E of 8 that no one cares about can just as well sell at a P/E of 6
(and maybe the "E" goes down as well to compound matters).

Nice catch. The earnings report looks awful on the surface, but go back to the
argument about the accounting made two weeks ago. 97 cents of pro forma
trailing earnings looks like a p/e ratio of 13. But I have argued that you
should add back the project development cost line item after tax. This brings
earnings to $1.79, making the "economic" P/E 7.3x. And, as you pointed out, its
always nice to see a business which is supposedly in terminal decline signing
new long-term contracts in new markets. This one will require patience, but I
bought a full position at 14 1/4. I was willing to pay much more. I am willing
to double that if the stock drops another point. And you all know my view of

re: "Worry about Agco"
I wasn't necessarily referring to the credit portfolio. Just considering the
source, I thought the statement stands on its own. Another tidbit about Agco. I
visited a Case dealer a couple months ago, and he had a map on his wall of all
his competitors within 200 miles or so. Green pins in the map for Deere, Blue
for New Holland and Red for the Case dealers. I asked him, "What about Agco?",
and he said they're not even relevent to his business. As an institutional
holder of Agco, that should have terrified me. If I had ran to the nearest pay
phone and called in a frantic sell order we would have gotten $19 for our
shares. But I didn't and we sold them at a price much lower than that, but now
at $11 Agco deserves at least a look. Recognize that the balance sheet is a
disaster, but the 10-Q should be a must read for a value investor when it is
released. Should be any day now. I'm not saying its a buy - your first task is
to assess bankruptcy risk. Don't even think about the P/E multiple until you
are comfortable with the balance sheet. Because if we do go into an agriculture
downturn and somebody goes "poof" that will be Agco.

Be extremely careful when you buy cyclicals at high earnings just because the
P/E multiple looks cheap. Even when it looks extremely cheap. (Case traded at 9
times earnings a month ago and now it trades at 6 times earnings) Agco had a
P/E of 11 or 12x when it traded at 30. It looked VERY cheap, even relative to
its competitors. And now the stock price is 11, it trades at 5 times earnings.
I made a terrible mistake on this one which cost my firm's clients dearly.
Thats a lesson learned the hard way.

the next 6 months. Is this a correct assumption?

2. What are the disaster scenarios:

I come up with 1. environmental liabilities ( are they insured or do they self
insure?)2. RUssia blows up and cannot supply product( are they on the hook to
supply product no matter what?) 3. What will the impact be of energy
deregulation- is this a plus or a minus for this business. 4. Are nuclear

Oh, you had another first question. You are absolutely right. Management is
essentially short their own stock for six months. Then that will change 180
degrees. So if you are interested in timing this, wait a couple months and see
if you can pick it up at 12. With a two year time horizon, I was more worried
about missing it on the upside. Now that "risk" has diminished (i.e. the stock
is falling) so I am waiting to fill my position (I bought half of what I want,
and what I want would be a very large portion of my portfolio.) If you're not
quite sure, pick a price (remember, the dividend is $1.10) you'd buy it at and
see if it gets there. It might). Don't wait too long though. Your judgement
about the options is the catalyst for the stock. Options get priced in January,
and management would love for the stock to be trading at 9 at that time. A
couple days later, you will likely see announcements of share buybacks, cost
cutting and new contracts.

More on what's happening with the market. Similar comments by Mary Farrell on
Nightline last night.

Blue Chip Stocks Hog Spotlight

By CHET CURRIER
AP Business Writer

NEW YORK (AP) -- On Wall Street, they're calling it one of the worst cases of
''badbreadth'' in modern memory. A few big-name stocks have been strong through
the early summer, carrying some of the market indexes to new highs. But
thousands of other stocks, particularly those of smaller companies, are
languishing.

What analysts call market breadth -- the number of advancing stocks versus the
number declining -- struggles along way behind the averages' progress. That
explains why big bull-market gains aren't showing up in the portfolios of many
individual investors or mutual funds, except those funds that specialize in
large growth companies.

Sign of the times: Standard & Poor's Corp. reports that just 15 elite stocks --
names like Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT - news), Intel (Nasdaq:INTC - news), General
Electric (NYSE:GE - news) and Coca (NYSE:KO - news)-Cola -- now make up 25
percent of the total market value of S&P's 500-stock composite index.

Thanks to stalwarts like these, the S&P composite index boasts a return of
better than 15 percent for the year to date, while broad indexes of smaller
stocks barely show a gain at all or even have slipped into negative territory.

''Probably the most frustrating aspect of the present market environment is its
narrowness,'' says Byron Wien, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter & Co.

By some measures, the trend in favor of consistently growing blue chips, and
away from smaller companies and undiscovered value stocks, has been in force
for three to four years now.

It has gone on so long it has turned into a movement of its own, complete with
a name -- ''momentum investing'' -- and a growing body of commentary to explain
why it has occurred and how it may continue indefinitely into the future.

Investors who follow the trends in the market from day to day or week to week
are left with a dreadful sense that anyone who sticks with small stocks, or
value stocks, instead of blue-chip growth, is committing some grave error in
judgment.

Analysts suggest that big stocks will keep excelling because of demand from
multi-billion-dollar mutual funds. These funds are so big that only big stocks
will work in their portfolios, the reasoning goes. Besides, they want to own
the big stocks because those are the ones that are doing well.

But many diehard fans of small and mid-size companies say this circular effect
won't keep repeating forever. The longer it continues, they say, the more
overpriced big stocks get, and the more attractive small stocks become by
comparison.

Ultimately, these observers say, stock prices must be determined by the earning
power of the companies they represent. So big stocks can't keep running ahead
of the rest of the pack unless earnings of big companies do likewise.

''The Dow blue chips and the S&P big caps are likely to remain high-priced
relative to growth, because they are still attracting lots of mutual and
pension fund money that is seeking presumed safety and quality,'' says Stephen
Quickel in his newsletter U.S. Investment Report.

''But their growth potential is limited. Meantime technology and other growth
stocks, including a smattering of medium- and small-caps, have greater
appreciation potential because of their underlying earnings drive.''

In the eyes of Richard Moroney, editor of the advisory letter Dow Theory
Forecasts in Hammond, Ind., ''Plenty of good values remain in the small-cap
sector, but most have been ignored in the market's latest flight to quality.

''Playing the small-cap segment of the market may require continued patience.
But investors looking for longer-term gains shouldn't overlook the growth
potential many small-cap companies offer.

FWIW,
Ron

I guess its a question of semantics. I agree that USU is a great value at 14.25
I bought it there as well. It is even a better value at 9 at which case I will
double my number of shares. I just do not view it as a full position. If I full
is $10000 then I usually buy 1/2 position $5000 and then fill out if the price
declines futher with no change in fundamentals.

I am amazed that this market is trashing "value" portfolios. If you bought into
NH at 19 or USU at 14.25 or others they are taking it solidly on the chin. Down
about 15%. The amazing thing is if you bought internet or large "following
stocks" with no or negative cash flows (such as Micron technologies) you would
actually have done very well in the past 3 months.

At this point, I see a number of stocks with very tempting cash flows that are
just "hated" by the street. One in particular is OTL, a spinoff of GLK.
Declining business with decent earnings, good cash flow, paying down their debt
(about 10% of debt this quarter) Would like to hear your analysis of it if you
have the time.

Another one (which has been trashed) is CFWY. Good cash flow, decent earnings,
Tisch (of value fame I presume) just filed 13d on it.

My conclusion is that by and large, investors are paying no attention to
fundamentals and are investing on a "well it went up yesterday" approach."

back shares, so I as a shareholder would have to put total faith in
management's ability to allocate capital. Management seems to be gearing up for
a risky diversification strategy. Also, they have just one competitor, so you'd

my value analysis. You wrote:
<Also, they have just one competitor, so you'd think they could keep prices
high. But no, they are in a price war. That tells me management is simply
inept.> In any business, where supply exceeds demand, there is a price war.
Check out MPC's at the <200mhz end for example. I would hardly use that as a
basis for ineptness in management.

You wrote, management is not buying back shares. Latest press release on July
17, they allocated 15mil for share buyback. I agree allocation is different
then actual buying. They won't buy till option pricing set. (USU will behave
same way imo)

Now my reasoning for it being a value at current price has to do with cash
flows.

Price: 19/share, Outstanding = 14.4, Total Debt = 348
TEV = 19/share*14.4 +348 = 621 mil
EBITDA (June 30qtr) = 56.3 mil
Net Income (June 30qtr) = 16.6 mil
Amortization (June 30th qtr)=10.2mil

1st Debt payment was June 30 for 40mil, leaving them with 42mil in cash and
348mil debt of which ~ 200mil is snr debt. Expect them to finish pay down of
snr debt in ~2 years.

TEV/EBITDA ~ 3 which represents a pretty good value even for a declining
business. Since excess cash is being used to pay down debt, I expect this
number to get better if stock price doesnt respond with the reduction in debt.

I'll throw this one out for thread perusal. I've recently decided to take a
closer look at it. Rock of Ages Corp (ROAC) - owns granite quarries, markets
products from the quarries. Very good results last Q, excellent current ratio,
minimal debt. Busted IPO, trading down from price of $18.50 (but what isn't
busted in this environment!) Trades at about 1.3 times book.

AG: Major negative I saw in balance sheet was not much cash. But they've
operated that way for several years possibly using revolving line of credit.
One interesting item is that the collection period for AG is much shorter than
others. Perhaps this implies they abstain for financing channel stuffing thru
extended terms. On the other hand, income statements appear to show net income
year end 97 exceeding operating cash flow - a serious red flag. All this from
annual not quarterly data (Usually my database is accurate, but these numbers
didn't come directly from SEC docs).

Thanks for your comments, Wallace.

I am new to this thread, and am impressed with what I have seen so far. One
stock that is worth considering is COHU. They make semi-conductor test
equipment, a segment that has been severely beaten down in the past few months.
Here are the fundamentals:
P/B = 1.4
P/S = 0.9
P/E = 7
COHU has no debt, conservative management, almost $6/share cash, and has fallen
below 20 in the recent downturn. I bought this one two years ago at an average
cost of 20 and sold half last December for 53 1/2. The company is stronger now
than ever, and when the sector turns I am looking for it to trade near 60. This
is a great growth and value stock in the high tech arena. All IMHO.

Good investing to all,

Wallace: re: ROAC. Well, this one might work out okay also. Looks like it could
be or is a steady, real business. On the other hand, p/bv, psr, pe(current)
don't jump out (to me) as screaming bargains. Based on estimated future
pe--looks to be a nice,steady business -- maybe okay to go out in the future a
little with this relatively new issue --- current price might be the floor.

On the other hand --g--, giving some more thought to argument that value stocks
will drop as large caps come down, and so drag value stocks even lower... well
maybe here's a situation for example, that, at this point in time, large caps
stocks could now drive investors away from (not necessarily out of)such small
caps. My argument is thus this: Why buy this particular small cap stock now
when we (I think) are seeing (I think)bargains also among larger cap,
established co's. that also have good prospects and similar or better p/bv, pe,

AG mostly & NH, DE from Barrons: Share buybacks are the rage in Corporate
America, but sometimes they are executed poorly. Take the case of AGCO, a
leading maker of farm equipment.

AGCO repurchased 3.5 million shares of its stock during May and June, or 6% of
its stock outstanding. At the same time AGCO was buying back its shares, its
business was worsening. AGCO ended up paying an average price of $25 a share
for stock that now trades for 11 1/4 .

AGCO's stock has fallen sharply in the wake of weak second-quarter profits and
the company's downbeat outlook for the rest of 1998. Wall Street analysts have
sharply cut their 1998 and 1999 profit estimates. AGCO is now expected to earn
$2 a share in 1998 and 1999, down from earlier estimates of over $3 in both
years.

AGCO's management came under fire during a conference call after the share
buyback and earnings were reported recently. Wall Street analysts couldn't
understand why the company bought back so much stock at a time when its
business was deteriorating. To make things worse, AGCO said that it was
suspending its share-buyback program and that it will now use cash for debt
paydown and acquisitions. For the same money it laid out to buy back 3.5
million shares, AGCO could now repurchase more than double that amount.

The entire farm-equipment sector has been rocked lately. AGCO has lost half its
value since late June. New Holland has fallen by 25%, to 15 5/8, while Case is
off 33%, to 31 11/16. Industry leader Deere is off about 20% to 42 1/8 in the
past five weeks.

The Asian, African and Russian markets are weak, and low grain prices are
hurting farmers in the U.S. and Europe, resulting in higher levels of
discounting. That said, the sector could offer opportunity if current earnings
projections are borne out because the stocks now trade at rock-bottom P/Es.

AGCO changes hands at 5.5 times 1998 profits. New Holland and Case have P/Es of
around six, and Deere has a multiple of under 10. AGCO trades at about its
tangible book value.Share buybacks are the rage in Corporate America, but

Just back from a three day vacation. It felt so good not to know where the
market closed on Friday, and when I checked everything out today it seemed my
value stocks both at work and in my own portfolio outperformed huge on Friday
after getting creamed for the last three weeks. St. Joe up 8%, Trinity
Industries up 4%, USEC back up to its IPO price, and more. That LaSalle Hotels
that I posted the other day is up 15% for me in less than a week. And USEC came
back nicely too. Did others have similar experiences Friday? The move seemed to
be to broad through the watchlists I follow to have been an insignificant
event, but Barrons didn't seem to have noticed. Also the Russell 2000 index of
smaller stocks outperformed the S&P by a lot Thursday and Friday (like 2% or
so). I find that to be a very good sign that the market acted rationally, at
least for a short time. We'll see if it continues.

Nice post from Barrons. Barrons also ran an excellent interview with Bob Marcin
of MAS Value. He quanitfied his results over the last two years, which have
been absolutely dreadful, after outperforming for 7 years in a row with his low
P/E strategy. He's sticking to his guns. Largest holdings are things like Case,
Cummins Engine and Owens Corning. This is a must read for any frustrated value
investor.

We brought home a stray kitten today and I wanted to name it Buffett, but my
wife wouldn't let me. So its name is Marmalade. Ich. (I'll call it Buffett when

in the year's range of 5-10.3/4, and 39 employees-- I sure can't see any margin
of safety. Especially in an industry (oil drilling, explor., maintenance??)
where other companies are struggling now... how this co. can still earn 50%
ROE, I question. Yahoo (all my info from Yahoo)says some sales, earnings due to
replacement parts, so maybe there's a good proprietary "razor blade" product or
products there. When I think of seismography, I think SLB. Sure would hate to
go up against those guys. BTJ reminds me of one of those small dink businesses
that went public and never should have public investors. JMO, and I've been

I have also been looking at BTJ, and almost bought on Monday, but held off
because I am working on some extreme microcap screens based on O'Shaugnessy's
book "What Works on Wall Street".

The company you mentioned, Schlumberger, is listed as a major customer of Bolt,
so apparently the product is good. I wonder, however, how many of the "guns"
Bolt can sell before demand is sated. Some first hand information from users of
the product would be very helpful on this type of co. Concerns are noted, but I
also see a company with revenue and earnings going through the roof. Revs up
70%, earnings up over 100%, and price momentum is good. Trailing PE of around
9. Forward PE should be significantly lower if revenue trend continues.

(And here's the kicker <G> they also have a "division" making motorcycle

Appreciate the comments. I did note the deficiency with regard to "value" as

current low PE also is aided by tax loss carry forwards. I was (and am)
impressed by the revenue and earnings growth but cautious because of some of
the facts you stated as well as insider activity (almost all sales).

On FI, I could not find the rationale for holding on with the reorg.
Petrofinal will acquire 100% of the subsidiary paying 90% of the current market

at well above recent market prices. And the proposal was approved by

From:James Clarke

19 new highs, 462 new lows on the NYSE. We are in a bear market, and have been
for months. From here until whenever it turns (it could be two days, it could
be two years), we must monitor two things as value investors and bottom
fishers:

1) Reliable quality companies selling at obscenely cheap valuations. Several
are there now. New Holland is one we all know too well. But we have already
seen the danger of buying these secondary companies at cheap valuations before
the industry leaders have taken their pain. The S&P is still only down 10% from
its peak. That's amazing to me considering how much carnage there is across the
market. Most of the quality companies I look at are down 20-50% from their
peaks. So we should probably resist the temptation to buy until the market
(i.e. the indices) have done their thing. If you look at the GEs or the Dells
or the Microsofts, they have barely begun to drop.
2) A bottom. This is worse than anything we have seen in the last two or three
years. The kneejerk "buy the dips" crowd can't have much buying power (i.e.
cash) left, though they still have plenty of sanctimony. At some point these
guys are going to get scared. They are still very complacent. The pundits on TV
and the individual investors I talk to and Abby Joseph Cohen are saying this
too will pass. Maybe two or three months of dead money, but if you're patient,
then you'll be rewarded with new highs by the end of the year. How about the
possibility of a further 30% drop, virtual panic, and not being whole for 5-10
years? When people start realizing how likely that scenario is, you are going
to see panic selling by the retail investors who we all depend on to prop up
the market by buying at idiotic valuations. They are not ready to sell yet, but
this dynamic is what will take the "correction" from 20% to 40%. We have not
seen that panic sell (in the industry, we call it "the puke stage"). When I see
signs of that I'll think about putting my cash to work tentatively.

Or maybe this is just the frustrating (to us bears) 10% correction we have seen
before. That would make this the bottom. But I don't think so, because the
fundamentals (except for interest rates) have deteriorated since those past
corrections and the valuations may be even higher. If the market bounces from
here to new highs, I may just consider selling everything and joining the
priesthood. I guess if I'm married I can't do that, so I'll just have to come
back and fight another day.

The stuff we look at on this board may have some tax loss selling pressure, but
most of the "Correcting" here needs to be on the upside. Perhaps this is a good
market to mix longs and shorts. Problem is rational valuation just doesn't seem
to be working and with "value" stocks getting killed and highfliers still
flying high, I'd like to see some evidence of rationality before betting
long/short on valuation.

With most stocks I follow down 40-60% depending on the sector, and the average
NYSE and Nasdaq stock down 25-30%, a significant correction has already
occurred. It would take a crash of historic proportions, which may happen, but
I'm ready to move another 50% cash into the market to take advantage of the
current valuations on my favorite stocks.

Another stock that goes on my buy list when I get the cash in there is
Telebras. Now at 94 for the system on a 23% 9 day crash in Brazil. Glad I got
out above 120. But that was luck. Now there's opportunity again. Here's hoping

Hi Papaya King! Weren't you the person who got me interested and into TCMS??
Ouch!! Cripes, it's less than 50% of bv now. Luckily - or wisely - for the
others on the thread, they did not succumb it seems.

Dividends haven't been more important than capital gains since about 1958 IMO.
(About when people stopped thinking they had to have high div's on their stocks
to compensate for bonds which were thought less risky--- or so I've read.)
Dividends will return to favor (have a much stronger influence in investing) in
17 years. That is, I figure you're about 35 and at about age 52 you'll actually
focus and act on the realization - as you already suspect or know with your 20
years of experience - that dividends do matter-- both as a safety prop for the
stock price and as a discipline for management (who often need it). IMO,
dividends are the one and only claim investors have -- just try claiming your
share of discounted cash flows or earnings or of assets - ha. (Of course,
investor claims to dividends are subject to change of div. policy by
management- but such changes in div. policy are - should be - rare.)
My idea is that it's not either/or. Some stocks should be bought for dividend
yield -- there's a clue there for inferring under- or overvaluation based on
historical dividend yield- or bought for growing dividend yield (ref.
Tigue&Lisanti-"The Dividend Rich Investor"). Other stocks are bought for other
reasons (e.g. capital gains). Paul.

Paul,

You don't feel there will be a trend towards dividend stocks as the baby
boomers retire? Less than 17 years.

It seems to me that the trend would be to income producing stocks and it will
pressure corps to change policy from buybacks to paying dividends. IMO most
corps buyback primarily to benefit insiders (stock options) and don't pay
dividends because wealthier insiders don't want the taxes.

IMO the ideal company is growing and paying a percentage of income out in
dividends. Over a period of years, you get a cash return on investment, price
appreciation from the growth, and increasing dividends. The growth of this type
of stock is usually less than a non-dividend paying stock because the company
isn't keeping the capital, but the overall return is equivalent and the risk
lower.

JMHO,
Ron

Agco could be a home run at 9, but monitor the balance sheet carefully. For
ELY, just my opinion, but I can't see any margin of safety there. But unlike
Agco, it has no debt, so you know its not going to zero. I just see no reason
why it doesn't go to 8 or 9. On the other hand, I was out golfing today and
tried my uncle's Big Bertha - I'd never tried one before. This puppy would take
3 strokes off my game. I refuse to pay $300 for a golf club, but I'll buy a
used older generation Bertha for $100 or so. Doesn't help the company, but
hopefully it will help my game. I really think you're looking at a case here
where virtually everybody who will buy the product already has. On top of that,
there is no barrier to entry. Before you buy ELY, read the prospectus for Adams

Jim,

Re: ELY. I felt the same way as you, but after talking to some of the hardcore
golfers at work who have the money to afford the clubs (Regional VP and
Controller) I find that they're constantly trying out new clubs despite the
high cost. There seems to be the perception, valid or not, that the next new
technology will make the old clubs obsolete. Whether or not ELY has the next
new technology is another matter, but certainly the competition could steal
marketshare where successful innovation is the key barrier to entry.

This said, I'm not buying ELY now. Like yourself I can see it going lower.
Asia, and Japan in particular, seems to be much of their problem and the
company has said they don't expect this to get better anytime soon. In
addition, a privately held company called Orlimar seems to be the maker of the
club everyone's talking about right now.

re: ELY The names of the product should have told you when to short the stock.
Bertha. OK, it can get bigger, so maybe you buy the stock. Big Bertha. Its
already big - can't get much bigger - sell your position. Then "Biggest
Bertha". Once something gets "biggest", you know one thing - it ain't getting
bigger. Short the stock.

What can they possibly name the next product? "Bigger than Biggest Bertha"? I'm
just saying this facetiously now, but it would not have been a bad way to trade
the stock in hindsight.

As for Shane's post before, if that's the company's story now the stock is
going lower. Rich people may indeed trade up to the "Bigger than Biggest" club
at a higher price. But rich people trading up is not where the company's growth
has come from in the last few years. It has been middle class golfers buying
their first "killer club". The clubs don't wear out, so there is no replacement
demand. And will a blue collar golfer who is pretty happy with his Big Bertha
buy the new product? In their growth phase they were trying to convince this
consumer to replace his cheapo wood. Now they have to convince him to replace
his Big Bertha. That's a very different game, and I don't think they can do it.
If I have to buy or short this stock, I short it.

It is also important to understand that the marginal consumer (me) who wants a
high tech club has a used market now. As I understand it, I can get a used Big
Bertha for 1/3 the price of a new generation club, and there is not that much
difference given the level of my game. A used sale has virtually no impact on
the company's prospects.

Kelloggs I would wait for the announcement of a price cut - the company is

Hi Investor2: I take it that these are stocks you already own- and maybe for
many years, if not decades.

IMO,

Kellogg is a buy somewhere around current level. For starting a position, maybe
a small amount could be committed now. Rising div. (3%), good ROE, new key
manager... but competition is hurting them.

RPM: A stock from the '70's. Great investment. Always seems to be around $15...
but lordy, with split after split after split. Wish I had bought some in those
days. And the same was said then as now: Who're RPM and yeah, they've got a
good record, but what are they going to do for us in the next few years? So I
asked that question in the '60's and didn't buy, in the '70's and didn't buy,
and in the '80's I think too... and didn't buy. And in the '90's and didn't
buy. There are just some stocks out there that are like that I guess. For a
buy-and-hold guy like you... a good time maybe to add to positions. I still see
red when I think about RPM... if I bought now, always would feel like I missed
the boat (which I did). I've taken a small position this year in LI - also a
specialty chemical mfger instead.

RBD. Another stock ---very popular growth stock of the '60's. Never owned it.
Was too overpriced then, not priced low enough now. They pride themselves on
coming to market VERY QUICKLY with new things for the home. I see them as a
competitor to Sunbeam (which they only occasionally are, but it colors my
judgment of RBD.) I'd avoid, only because I can't see how they can overcome
competitive threats from others.

Pep Boys... Another stock from the '60's. Hey! We've gotta find some good
non-tech growth companies from or for the late '90's! PBY - Good business, but
many competitors IMO -- too many HI-LO, etc. I'd avoid unless price was
compelling (and it's now not IMO).

ADPT. Well it's a stock of the '90's all right. But I can't figure its value
based on p/bv; psr, sales growth, etc. And not knowing that much about the
business, the industry, competitive threats, etc. etc.... I have to avoid ADPT.

BT... Now that could work at current price. Earnings increasing with dividends
as back up support. I'll have to look further.

Hi Ron: re trend in dividends. It's possible with changes in perception, aging
of investors, and changing tax laws, that there will be a trend to focus on
dividends - the yield number and/or the increasing $/sh amounts. But who knows?
Phil Fisher said, forget dividends... if you need money, just sell some shares.
Which is easy and cost-effective enough to do now IMO. But Ibbotson says that a
heck of a lot of the return that common stocks have provided over long periods
of time (like I recall maybe 60% of the 10%??) are provided by dividends.

My general take on dividends and companies is this: Once a company commits to
its dividend policy... it must and should stick to this policy. Otherwise, it
is sending a definite signal -- like sell - to investors. That is, I can be
comfortable with a company that has a policy of no dividends, or a policy of a
constant dividend amount, or a company that occasionally and sporadically
increases its dividends, or a company that increases dividends every year. But
not a company that changes such a policy.

ROAC: Since we may be needing a tombstone for this market and many of its

commodity business which won't be helped by more competition from foreign
sources due to cheap foreign currencies.

However, I think purchasing retail operations and diversifying geographically
are very smart moves, reducing seasonality, getting into higher margin areas,
and controlling demand for their product.

However, I think we could see the price hit book value of about $10 on this, or
less, and a P/E closer to 10.

Can't figure out how to evaluate or what the underlying value is for CSWC. Joe,
thanks for link to Dallas Morning paper article. This venture capital firm is
reported to have 20 years of 22.5% growth. Maybe it's not Buffett, but it's
close enough for me. Andrew, James, others -- I can't figure what the
underlying stocks in CSWC portfolio are worth (vs what CSWC says they are
worth) vs. the current CSWC stock price. And Andrew, I know you analyze these
things pretty good --ala Craig-- could you give a once-over and offer an
opinion? (Or maybe your opinion is that if I can't figure it out myself, I
should just move on -g-??) Maybe the right question is.. if the pres. and
chairman, William Thomas, really delivered these sterling results, what's the
outlook or odds that he/his team can continue to do this for, say, another 10
years? Anybody ever hear of Mr. Thomas and his CSWC? -- I never have before the
Joe Dancy link. Or maybe I mean to ask, is this company unknown or
misunderstood, and is that still reflected in the stock price (even though the
stock has increased quite a bit) and so now would be a time to buy for someone
with a long term outlook and confidence in Mr Thomas and his team and their
record?
Note. The referred to article can be found now in Yahoo, under CSWC, in Msgs,
number 8 and 9. Actually, I'd recommend the read just because I think it's a
pretty good interview with an apparently down-to-earth, successful, long-term
value investor (Mr. Thomas).

Kathleen,

>What did you see regarding unclear growth in FAST?
>The only mention I've seen in
>the press has been fear of being hurt by the GM strike.

I had in mind long-term growth. I started
discussing FAST at Buffetology thread, so I look at it
as a Buffett stock. What is a major risk for any
Buffett stock? The possibility that the history does
not repeat itself anymore. I.e. the stock had great
growth, great ROE for 10 years, but the party is over.
Look at ELY and NKE as examples that can have this future.
Look at RBD as a busted Buffett stock.

Now, I look at FAST and I am trying to figure
out whether the future will be as good as the past.
I don't know much about the business, but I notice that
they have 644 shops in 48 states. They plan to add 200
more in 1998. IMHO, geographical expansion
is limited. I notice that they released mail-order catalog
last year, so this growth venue is covered. Are they going
to sell their products over Internet? Even so, I am not
sure where the growth is going to come from
for next 10 years.

Fastenal also added 4 new product lines in 1996
and 2 lines in 1997. This is additional growth, but
some of it may mean diworsefication and lower margins.

Buffett owns some retailers. But most of them
are no-growth cash cows. This is fine within Berkshire,
but in the real world management usually goes different
way. They usually diworsify. Nobody likes to say: "We can't
grow anymore without loss of margins, so let's stop
expansion plans and give all the FCF to shareholders".

Both inventories
and accounts receivable increased in 1997. This may
correspond with the site expansion.

Finally, FAST had negative free cash flows
for the last three years. This may be fine for
fast growing company, but I wonder what is going to
happen in the future.

In summary, I am not very comfortable with
business because I don't know it well. The future
growth therefore is unclear and the return to
shareholders uncertain. I would invest in
FAST if I got satisfactory answers to my questions, or
if it fell to "value stock" level. But that's still
far with PE 30 and PSR 3.

Good luck

Dividend trends: From a rational perspective dividends are a poor way to
deliver value to shareholders: They aren't deductible to the corporation and
they're taxed as ordinary income to the recipient. There's been a growing
awareness and trend away from dividends to share buybacks as a result.
Nevertheless you see discounted closed end funds like GHS trying to narrow the
discount by setting up a 10% discount policy so rational or not dividends are

Re: "I take it that these are stocks you already own- and maybe for many years,

Yes, I've been dollar-cost averaging into most of them (along with others) for
a LONGGG time. Every time the dividend rate approaches historic highs and/or
the P/E historic lows, I throw a little more money into them.

RE: "BT... Now that could work at current price. Earnings increasing with
dividends as back up support. I'll have to look further."

Yes, BT's got a nice dividend, relatively speaking. Of course, I bought when
the yield was 7% to 9% in the mid- to late-1970's, and 4% to 6% in the early
1980's. The yield dropped down to 3% in 1986/87, before the crash, and then
jumped back to about 6% in the late 80's and early 90's.

Recenly, the yield has been in the 3% range, but the 30% drop in the stock
price bumped it up to about 4%. Given the fact that inflation is 1.5%, and the
S&P 500 yields about 1.5%, 4% isn't too bad.

No problem - we all got a chance to think through an important issue. What did
we learn? 1) Dividends are double taxed; but 2) That does not by any means mean
you don't want dividends. I like Warren Buffett's take on dividends. If a
company can reinvest its earnings at 15 or 20%, it should not pay any dividend.
Most companies feel a need to pay a dividend - but I would agree with Buffett.
If the business I have invested in can reinvest better that I can, I don't want
the dividend. But on the other hand, most of my investments now pay 7-10%
dividends. These businesses can't reinvest any better than I can (though I have
to reinvest after paying taxes on the dividend). But the reason I have invested
in these companies is the safety the dividend gives me. With the long bond at 5
1/2%, if I can find a secure 8% dividend (plus the potential for a double, like
USEC), I'm all over it. That's two ways to win. That said though, in ordinary
circumstances, dividends are irrelevant. What you want to look for is free cash
flow, and if the company doesn't pay a dividend is that a rational decision.
This market is not "ordinary circumstances", so I am looking for high
dividends.

re N: IMHO, very H at this point, the answer is maybe. I'm not sure that high
book value (relative to current price) is the key. Rather, overall economic
trends and expected demand for the metals. If you've looked at the long term
chart of N, you've seen that it has traded at bv before, but also below 10. And
depending on where one bought, e.g. at 10, one has had a very, very long wait
for stock to be rise - maybe too long for it to be a worthwhile investment @
$10. And I assume that there is value to the stock-- the minerals/elements are
still in the ground.
I'm not sure, but N may be majority owned by another company, which may have
better prospects or at least more flexibility/diversification. Possibly someone
else on the thread has more or better info. here.

Many of these metal companies are selling at long time lows. So, it's not just
a matter of picking N because of bv. For example, I own CYM and TIE - both IMO
of similar genre to N. At least with CYM, selling also below bv, there's a good
dividend yield (until they maybe cut it), diversification among metals and
geography, and perhaps a repeat of CYM's history of trading at 17-18 or better.
With TIE, also trading at multi-year lows, TIE remains (for the next couple of
years I believe) a contracted supplier to Boeing, and I expect TIE to remain
profitable.

This whole mining arena is ugly IMO. With so many value stocks out there now,
it would be difficult for me to recommend N. (Maybe for somebody with TONS of
patience, well-diversified portfolio, very interested or knowledgeable of the
business or knows people employed there). I just don't see any compelling
reason to buy now. Please note though regarding my opinion and positions: I've
been wrong many times before - and the way things are going, I may have to
amend that to wrong most times before -g-.

investing that has within it, a sentence which begins:
"Mathematically,..." or uses exponential factors to try to make a point.
These articles are written by academics or 'strange and wonderful'
people whom no rational person should trust with their financial future
or their investing funds. JMHO, and although I've been wrong many,many
times... I've never been wrong on this.<<<

In general I completely agree with you. This is especially true when it comes
to complicated mathematics. In this case however the model is the most basic
demonstration of how total stock returns are achieved. (Dividends + Long Term
Earnings Growth) It then just demonstrates what kind of returns one could
expect given various assumptions about the dividend yield in the future or a
reversion to the mean aggregate market level. I believe it is a very useful
model. If one applies this model on a historical basis, I know of no model that
would have produced better results on the aggregate market if it was used to
compare returns on various asset types and make educated guesses about risk and
reward. Despite the mathematics, this one is worth it. Buffett uses a similar
model for individual stocks.

Re: "But on the other hand, most of my investments now pay 7-10% dividends."

Wow, I haven't owned a stock that paid 7% in some time. My most recent, which I
still own but the yield dropped to below 7%, was CSR.

What still pays more than 7%??

Best wishes,

<<What still pays more than 7%?>>

Dividends are boring. Even to me. Watching a stock go up is much more exciting.
But I have never been through a bear market, and I know they're good for me
even if my portfolio puts me to sleep.

What I am trying to do is play offense and defense at the same time, buying
undervalued stocks with dividend yields well above the long bond where the
dividend yield is more or less secure.

1. USEC (USU) is my largest investment. We've heard alot about it here, so we
don't need to go through it again. Its up signficantly the last couple days as
two of the bankers came in with buy recommendations. While I ordinarily
discount buy recs from the bankers, Morgan Stanley's was significant because
the guy really believes the story and is looking for a double. $1.10 dividend
which is rock solid on a $14 3/4 share price. Whats that, 7 1/2% or so?
2. EastGroup Properties (EGP) A REIT with a solid long term track record or
wealth creation paying a dividend north of 7%. The dividend is especially
secure because they are in the lowest volatility property type - warehouses.
Very boring, but in the long run these guys will make you money.
3. LaSalle Hotels (LHO) - a little more risky, but I can't resist a 10 1/2%
yield. This is a new IPO, and the stock tanked from the start. But I met with
the CEO last week and tried to shake the story but couldn't. Hotels are the
most volatile property type though, so if the hotel supply/demand balance
deteriorates, the dividend is not secure. I'm not looking to hold this one
long-term, but the current price just doesn't make sense. Don't trust your
screens on this one. The dividend is $1.50, even though some databases have the
wrong number.
4. RJR I don't own, but it pays an 8 1/2% yield which is secure based on the
cash flow, but is definitely vulnerable to tobaccos settlements with the
governement or class action defeats.

Just a few ideas. With the long bond at 5 1/2%, a yield over 7% is very
enticing.
