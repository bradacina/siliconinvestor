What about ONE times cash flow? U.S. GREXF

Near-Term Production Story More Compelling Than Ever

By David J. DesLauriers
23 Aug 2006 at 04:34 PM

TORONTO (ResourceInvestor.com) -- In late April of this year, your
correspondent published a well-followed story on Gold-Ore Resources [TSXv:GOZ],
which at the time was trading at 49 cents. The stock, which at one point
reached 75 cents, has come back down with the sluggish summer markets, closing
today at 52 cents.

We said then that GOZ was “an excellent bet, and with shares changing hands at
50 cents, or essentially 1X cash flow, investors could well be rewarded with a
10 bagger over the coming year if Gold-Ore executes on its plan, and goes on to
trade at the standard 10X cash flow multiple of its gold producing peers.”

The crux of this story is the cash flow - and Gold-Ore’s current low multiple.
Since our piece was published, GOZ has made significant progress in its mine
development program at the Bjorkdal mine in Sweden (which looks bigger than
ever), and continues on track to begin production mid-2007.

Progress / Timeline

1/4 way through 8,000 metre drilling program - Expected completion in November
3/4 done on the almost 1 kilometre of tunnelling - Expected completion first
week of October
2/3 done on 75,000 tonne bulk sample - Expected completion mid-October
1/3 done on estimated 10,000 total samples - Expected completion end of
November
Engineering Studies - Expected to begin December
Resource Update & Results of Engineering Study – Q1 ‘07
A Growing Resource: An Even Better Story

In our last article, we said “The company is testing an area previously drilled
by widely spaced holes, which is sufficiently large to host 500,000 to
1,000,000 ounces of gold.”

A couple of things have happened since then:

The company has looked at this again, and has concluded that there is no reason
to doubt that the mineralization continues, and that the 500,000 to 1,000,000
ounces of gold which the company was targeting could actually be more like
2,000,000, to 4,000,000 million ounces. There is a logical argument to be made
that the target area could easily be expanded in the direction of the tailings
pond, and all indications are that the mineralization is consistent. Take this
picture and cast the red net over the area that is not covered, and this could
be a 20-year mine life, very interesting to mid-tiers, and to the way the
company would be valued by the market.
The second thing is that Gold-Ore has uncovered some historical drilling
results which indicate significant grades below the Gold-Ore tunnelling
program. Mines in the area have operations at between 1 - 2 kilometres depth,
and GOZ is currently only at around 200 metres depth in the open pit. Part of
the drill results, which will be released in Q4, will include testing to depth
where it is wide-open, and would appear to be high-grade.

Valuation / Conclusion

What remains true, as we stated in April (see link at beginning of article) is
that “What investors who capitalize on this now are betting on is that:
Management, who between them have discovered several million plus ounces mines
in the past can expand the resource at Bjorkdal, a fully functioning mine
currently in production in a safe part of the world which demonstrates a number
of exciting new targets, and areas where grades are consistent, but definition
drilling is warranted.”

But the story has improved since our last piece because it is believed that the
size of the deposit at Bjorkdal could be much, much larger than previously
thought. This is obviously still conjecture until tunnelling/drilling defines
the area in detail, but geologically (and Gold-Ore Geos are first class) it
makes perfect sense, and indications are that consistent mineralization
continues in that direction.

In addition, the period between September and December of this year should be
full of news flow as results come back from the drills and tunnelling.

Last, but not least, the company remains on track to produce between 75,000 -
100,000 ounces per annum starting in mid-2007, which equates to 50 cents per
share of cash flow at the low end. That means that on the cash flow side,
Gold-Ore remains a hidden gem which trades at 1X cash flow, and could well
trade at 10X cash flow (the average among peers) a couple of quarters into
production. This could be a $5 stock in 12-18 months time.

What I wanted to point out with my hypothetical example of a 30% grower that
you option math can make a company look bad when in fact management makes
totally responsible decisions. In this example that I have been referring to,
the free cash flow would all be used up to prevent dilution, yet the
shareholder would be doing OK. 

How is the shareholder OK if the supposed free cash flow is all used up by
being an expense? The touted earnings aren't earnings and the main thing the
shareholder is left with is a feel good story about how great the company is
doing without getting any meaningful benefit. Thus they are forced to rely on
the the Greater Fool to come along and pay more for shares of a company that
isn't showing any meaningful real return to them on the price.

There are other problems with your math - the dilution that you have been
calculating is really caused by stockoptions granted many years ago.

The math is fine, you are questioning the approach. Now in doing that, show me
where the expense of the stock options issued years ago was deducted in the
years of (or subsequent to) the issue. You won't find it. It was never treated
as an expense, yet now to honor the vested options they use treasury stock.
Treasury stock was never treated as an expense when acquired. So...if the
picture wasn't muddied by the purchase of more treasury stock than currently
used to meet vested options demand....the impact on current financials would be
that shareholder equity would be reduced by the amount of treasury stock issued
to meet this demand.

What does reducing shareholder equity mean? It means that prior years earnings
that were not paid out to shareholders and thus became retained earnings and
added to shareholder equity were less than previously reported. Just because
current accounting regulations don't call for the restatement of prior years
earnings doesn't negate this simple fact.

This is somewhat accomplished by directly expensing stock options using the
Black Scholes model.

Pure hogwash! Black-Scholes is meaningless in the evaluation of the cost of
internally granted stock options. In fact it is worse than meaningless, it is
extremely deceptive in that it gives the reader the perception that
mathematical review has determined that there is no cost. Until investors
become more sophisticated and more proactive, it will continue to serve this
purpose.

In the absence of accurate reporting of the expense of options, I have found
that my approach works pretty well. Am I counting against this year's revenues
the cumulative impact of prior years largesse? Yes, I am. Does that then mean
that the answers derived have no relevance? That is a question I've given a lot
of thought to.....and it seems to me that:

1). The company is buying back shares in part to prevent dilution and they want
to prevent dilution in part because they don't want any attention drawn to the
magnitude of the options being exercised.

2). In the absence of any other way of quantifying the magnitude, the
difference between the amount spent on the buybacks and the amount of
difference recorded in diluted shares is the key.

3). Stock option grants are embedded in corporate culture and are unlikely to
go away.

4). Stock options are not ever expensed.

5). There is a true cost to stock options.

Therefore, I conclude that stock options will continue to be awarded and the
current system provides the least amount of pain to the beneficiaries of those
options and thus will continue to be used. Therefore using the cost as I derive
it and deducting that cost from net profit in the year that it is calculated
probably reflects a fairly accurate assessment of net earnings from the
shareholder's viewpoint.

If a company adopts an aggressive plan to reflect accurate expensing of these
costs, then using this methodology will not be necessary as it would then be
double-counting an expense.

If a company just eliminates the stock option grants in favor of some other
award system that is accurate and expensed, then the cost of honoring vested
options will continue as long as though options exist and still need to be
factored in any estimation of value.

Paul,

Purchased CHS and ESV for the first time today.

Near term issues with CHS are apparent, but I think they may be too
conservative with their projections at this point. Unless some hurricanes hit
the U.S., one would think the year-over-year comparables would not be as
difficult to meet. Also, valuation metrics compared with ANN are more
reasonable to me at this point.

ESV looks attractive here, even if there is some short term softness is Gulf of
Mexico operations. Worldwide demand appears solid (I also own THE but they are
more focused on the U.S. market).

Keith Jamison, I've been considering adding to my small ESV position. This
based on forward p/e multiple. It's been a cyclical industry, and while I'm
willing to bet the down part of the business cycle will at least be postponed
for a while, I might be very wrong that the forward p/e (6.2) is actually
relevant. (The time to buy being when earnings are nonexistent)

Also, I'm just not familiar enough with the jackup business to evaluate ESV
properly. That hasn't stopped me from taking on a few shares though as part of
a package. However, my strategy for oil/gas stocks has been to add more on
scale up, and that's not worked for me with some companies like ESV. (Have '04
shares in $30's and 4/'06 shares in $50's, for an overall net loss with stock
now selling in $40's.)

I see on my screen that several others have low p/e's too, and I have
considered adding to these also:

PTEN: 6.0
RDC: 6.1
ESV: 6.2
GW: 6.6
NSS: 7.0
UNT: 7.0

----
About that "several others have low p/e's" phrase above: that's the worrisome
part for me. It's that the many others DON'T have such low forward p/e's and I
don't know why there's that discrepancy. (Different businesses sure, but could
the market be anticipating none of these six specific companies above are going
to do that well in '06-'08? I don't know.)

I was also a buyer of more CHS today, but I don't take the short term issues
lightly. After listening to the Conference Call I found them fairly convincing
when they were talking about how difficult the second half will be. They are
going through some fundamental changes in their core Chico's operation, and
much of their future growth is dependent on promising, but unproven, new
concepts. It's true that comparisons will be easier next year, but if they
screw up they could lose some of their loyal customer base. OTOH, WH/BM does
remain a stalwart for them.

Long term I think this is a good buy, but short term I wouldn't be at all
surprised to see this go lower, maybe a lot lower.

Bought a little XEC. Cheap gas play, IMO with a pretty good track record. Stock
has stagnated after the Magnum Hunter acquisition. The company feels a margin
pressure as drilling cost increase and NG prices have remained stable. XEC is
cheap as each MM Cft in reserves is valued at around 2.5$. XEC balance sheet is
very conservative. I think XEC is a very attractive takeover target and NG is
cheap now compared to Oil.

Besides XEC I own CVX in the energy space.

How much of the business is WH/BM?
Retailing can turn on a dime, on the next "great" concept or fad. I guess
that's what you're betting on if you are buying CHS, which I haven't yet.
I still like WSM at these levels better. I think less risk, because of being
less of a one trick pony (granted that CHS has the WH/BM and fledgling Soma
concepts).
For the same reason, CHS probably has more upside, if the company is able to
properly execute a turnaround. In the last five years or so, trough PE has been
15, so I'm guessing there is still downside to low 15s based on revised '07
earnings of 1.10-1.15.

In my previous post I talked about the impact of MSFT's Vista OS on DRAM
prices. The following WSJ article is about PROMOS a Taiwanese DRAM producer.

The long-anticipated release of Microsoft's Vista operating system, expected in
thefirst quarter, is likely to benefit all makers of dynamic random-access
memory, or DRAM, chips - the part of the personal computer that holds data
temporarily.....analysts say Vista will require computers to carry twice as
much DRAM as existing versions of Microsoft Windows.

DRAM prices have already started rising, along with the share prices of several
DRAM makers - providing a rare bright spot for investors...

....some analysts and investors say ProMOS, one of the smaller DRAM producers,
could reap an outsize benefit. That is because the company is drastically
increasing its output this year....

Its new factory in central Taiwan produces DRAMs from silicon wafers that are
12 inches across - which yield far more chips, more cost effectively, than
older eight-inch wafers. The new plant is ProMOS's second 12-inch facility, and
the company is building a third....>

I own a position in IMOS which has ProMOS as one of its major clients. I still
like IMOS at these prices and believe it could trade forty percent higher by
the beginning of next year. IMOS is also showing up on some value screens.

http://www.forbes.com/2006/08/18/cheap-stocks-grey-wolf-cx_jd_0821sf.html?partn
r=yahootix

At five times earnings and trading at a valuation much less than its peers,
IMOS appears too good to be true. Many of the reasons for this cheap valuation
were explored in the the Q and A in the last CC which one should listen to if
considering IMOS as an investment. I think most of the issues will be resolved
positively and a more reasoned valuation will be placed on the stock. Lehman
Bro. who brought the stock public and sold their fifteen percent position
several years ago has recently started to purchase shares again.

Don't have the revenue breakdown handy, but the store count as of EOY was 544
Chico's vs. 204 WH/BM.

That's not Chico's. They have an extremely loyal customer base (women over 40).
That's not to say this can't change, but if their core base does erode it will
be a much more gradual process than at your typical apparel retailer. Chico's
has had an amazing string of SSS increases that has just been broken -
certainly there is a worry that this is the beginning of a long decline, and
that's a big reason why the stock got spanked so badly.

In the last five years or so, trough PE has been 15

The current problems for Chico's are unprecedented in Wall Street memory, and
are quite significant in terms of investor psychology. We could go well below a
15 PE.

I believe this stock though very small qualifies as a deep value play- I
purchased 40,000 shares at much higher levels and added 20,000 shares today at
.24 and .25. Be advised that the float is very small, which is why i had to pay
up unless i wanted to chance it and wait. The symbol is CNVT. the company is a
very small venture capital fund which seemingly invests in clean technology.
Due your own dilligence I would appreciate any comment you may have. When I
last checked the Biorem Stock was worth about $4.5 MM. Also please be aware
that there is a dispute with the IRS involving some $2.5MM.
I guess being a small investor allows one to take advantage of opportunities
like this, which should bear fruit over time . I imagine shareholders will have
to fend off a privatization bid soon enough.

CVF Technologies Corporation Reports 1st Quarter Results
Monday May 15, 8:17 pm ET
Makes New Investment in Electric Vehicles
Repurchases 1,093,861 Shares

WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y., May 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- CVF Technologies
Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: CNVT - News) reports on its first quarter
results.

ADVERTISEMENT1st Quarter Results - CVF's financial results can best be
understood by examining the growth prospects for its portfolio companies and
the strength of its balance sheet. In this quarterly report CVF will emphasize
these two areas. Judging CVF on its income statement alone is not very helpful
due to significant changes in revenue and income that can occur from quarter to
quarter and from year to year. This results from the business model of CVF
which is to invest its capital and human resources primarily in small, clean-
tech, early stage companies with significant growth potential. The intent is to
develop these companies until they either go public or are acquired as occurred
in 2005 with Biorem which went public in January 2005 and Gemprint which was
acquired by Collectors Universe Corp in December 2005. These two events created
significant growth in CVF's assets and income in 2005.

As an overview of the CVF balance sheet, CVF reports total assets of $5.6
million. However under GAAP accounting rules CVF only carries Biorem for
$576,700 when Biorem's market value as a publicly traded stock is $6.4 million
or approximately $5.8 million more than it's carried on the CVF balance sheet.
If the market value was included in the balance sheet then CVF's assets would
be $11.4 million of which a significant portion are liquid assets. These asset
totals under GAAP rules give only nominal value to CVF's other holdings which
include Ecoval, Petrozyme and the future potential royalty stream from G.P.
Royalty Distributors Co. (formerly Gemprint). Subtracting CVF's total
liabilities of $3.8 million from its $11.4 million in assets as described above
leaves CVF with $7.6 million in net asset value (not including its private
holdings).

Stock Buy Back and Preferred Stock Redemption -- as previously announced, on
December 30, 2005, CVF began a stock buy back program. As of May 1, 2006, the
company has repurchased 1,093,861 shares. In February of 2006 CVF also redeemed
its Series C 6% convertible preferred shares for $1 million plus accrued
dividends of $121,166.

Portfolio Highlights -- Xylodyne Corporation -- In March and April of 2006 CVF
invested $325,000 (Cdn) in Xylodyne Corporation, a newly formed company which
will focus on the sales, distribution, and manufacturing of electric vehicles
and electric vehicle technologies. These vehicles will be offered to the
personal recreational market as well as to government agencies, conservation
authorities and the mining industry. Xylodyne will also offer engineering
services to help manufacture, design, develop and test electric and hybrid
vehicles. CVF owns 40% of the equity of the company plus holds a two year note
for $313,000 (Cdn) from Xylodyne.

Biorem -- (27% owned by CVF) reported first quarter 2006 sales were $3.3
million (Cdn) up from $1.6 million (Cdn) in the first quarter of 2005. The
sales backlog was $9.4 million (Cdn) compared to $4.9 million (Cdn) in the
prior year. Biorem reports a net loss for the quarter of $200,000 (Cdn) due to
increased expenses in sales and marketing and engineering personnel as the
company accelerates its market penetration. It also experienced lower margin on
some of its projects due to large amounts of sub-contracted flow through costs.
Biorem expects its gross margins to increase back to more traditional levels
for the remainder of the year.

Ecoval -- (84% owned by CVF) has made significant progress in Canada in the
first quarter. Its licencee, Scotts Canada, has launched two additional
herbicide sizes this year for a total of three under the Scotts EcoSense brand
name. The EcoSense herbicide is available in every major retail chain in
Canada. Ecoval has also signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Plant
Products the largest commercial, non-retail horticultural distributor in Canada
for Ecoval's EcoClear herbicide product. The Scotts and Plant Products
agreements are expected to make Ecoval's herbicide the most dominant of the
non-chemical herbicide products in Canada. Ecoval now plans to leverage off its
success in Canada to begin an aggressive marketing campaign in the US as it
seeks out partners similar to what has been achieved in Canada.

G.P. Royalty Distribution Co. (formerly Gemprint Corp,) -- (65% owned by CVF)
was formed to receive potential royalty distributions from Collectors Universe
Corp who purchased the assets of Gemprint in December 2005. The royalty
agreement is for $1 for each Gemprint over 100,000 Gemprints per year until
December 2010. Based on Collectors Universe's recent press releases they appear
to be making good progress in their penetration of the diamond market for their
grading and Gemprint services.

Petrozyme -- (50% owned by CVF) is continuing to explore marketing
opportunities for its proprietary biologically based remediation technologies
for the petroleum and petrochemical industries.

CVF GAAP financial results for quarter ending March 31, 2006 -- On a
consolidated basis CVF reported a loss for the quarter of $481,000 on revenue
of $21,000. The revenue decrease was due mainly to Gemprint no longer
contributing revenue to CVF except for the potential future royalty stream from
Collectors Universe. The seasonality of Ecoval is such that its revenue
typically occurs in the second and third quarters. It should also be noted that
Biorem's revenue of $3.3 million (Cdn) for the quarter is not consolidated in
CVF's financial statements as CVF owns less than 50% of Biorem.

CVF Technologies Corporation (http://www.cvfcorp.com) is headquartered in
Williamsville, New York. CVF is a technology development company, whose
principal business is sourcing, funding and managing emerging pre-public,
clean-tech companies with significant market potential.

MCsweet, Carl Worth, et. al.: WNMLA: You may want to relook at this one again
now. It's seems to me, it's selling just above cash, and management might
attempt to do something to benefit stockholders.

Here's how I see it (I could be wrong!):

There's Bexil (BXL): While they announced (8/16) some problems,
("BEXIL CORP Files SEC form 8-K, Non-Reliance on Previous Financials, Audits or
Interim Review"), they also gave a 2nd q report:

http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/060815/103865.html

Here are some key points:

"The Company consummated the sale of its fifty percent interest in York in
April 2006 and realized a net after-tax gain of approximately $20,000,000."
(This is a cash sale, I believe, and represents all or almost all of holding
company BXL's business. BXL has no ltd.)

"Approximately 25% of Bexil's shares are owned by Winmill & Co. Incorporated."
(So WNMLA gets/controls/deserves $5M of the above sale proceeds.)

Turning to WNMLA, I see from Yahoo, 1.54M shares outstanding.
So BXL's cash equivalent to each WNMLA share is 5.0M/1.54M =$3.24/sh. WNMLA has
no ltd. (This is cash-in-search-of-a business because BXL is seeking to invest
the $20M cash in another business. (Aside: if only they could get another York!
That was bought for about $3M in 2002; BXL subsequently eliminated York's ltd,
squeezed $12M in dividends out of it, and now has sold the thing for an
after-tax $20M. So sweet!)

WNMLA owns 24% of dink (and cigar-butt?) reit, Tuxis. TUX. TUX ,selling near
its low for the year, has a market cap now of $5.9M. There's no ltd, according
to Yahoo. So WNMLA's share is $1.4M or $.91 per share.

Another dink company: WNMLA owns 24% of Foxby (FXX) trading at $2.20 with a net
asset value of $2.64 (as of 5/'06). Maybe that's worth .50/sh. to each WNMLA
shareholder.

There's Midas funds: I believe that's privately held (not part of FXX). Value
depends on how much you want to pay for "assets under management" (AUO, the key
metric for this business) I've had discussions on other threads where
apparently I've been too conservative and wrong: I value these things as a
buyer of the business at 1.5% of AUO. Others use 2-5% depending. Anyway, AUM
for Midas is $190M (a/o 5/'06). Because that is really tiny in the asset
management world, I figure Midas funds to a buyer might be worth only 1% AUM or
$1.9M/1.54 = $1.23 to a WNMLA shareholder.

There may (or may not be) more. WNMLA has cash on its balance sheet of $1.17
per share and no ltd, according to Yahoo. I'm assuming that's an accounting
number (equity method?)where the cash is actually in accounts of WNMLA's
investments, and so already counted in the above valuation.

------
In past on this thread there's been some concern about how management doesn't
seem to deliver value to shareholders. Some of that might be resolved with this
(July 28 report)

"The Company also announced today that the Board of Directors of the Company
has authorized a program to buy back up to 500,000 of its shares in the open
market and in privately negotiated transactions over the next five years, which
may provide additional market liquidity as it returns excess cash to
stockholders." (Not soon and no assurance it'll happen, but maybe. Could be a
negative if insiders are privately offered buy prices above market value -
which I (and my attorneys -g-) have had happen at other companies I've been
in.)

--------------------------
Anyway, I'm back in the stock today.

Can you explain to me some numbers from Yahoo in regards to DPTR (which I know

DPTR I will look closer at it but your numbers work out perfectly.

93% institutions+ 20% insiders (as a former public officer and CFO I know they
normally include options in the insider position for proxy disclosure but let's
ignore that) MINUS 13% Short sales EQUALS 100%.

Sprott's entities (which includes all kinds of different pockets--not just the
one people see) has to own about 17-20%.

All the analysts shake their head at the short position at prices they were put
in. Stock is not that liquid.

Hi Bridge Player - The SFL dividend looks safe to me for about five years out.
If there is any slow down, they will cut their profit sharing portion of the
dividend first which is now at $0.05/quarter. The company just recently added
the financing of drilling rigs to their fleet of oil tankers so they have a new
source of revenue. From my brief review, the terms are just OK but do generate
an IRR of 10% if you assume no appreciation of the asset and historically low
rental rates. This is enough to cover the current dividend.

SFL is a finance company similar to a REIT and will spin off qualified dividend
income (taxed at $15%). Their assets are secured by ocean oil drillers, and a
fleet of oil tankers. Do not expect much price appreciation of the stock but it
should provide a modest hedge against a falling dollar and/or inflation. As an
example, drilling rigs take several years to construct and tend to be worth
more in the future than at today's price. The cost of a new rig also tends to
vary with the price of oil and the day rate fees they can charge.

I have not looked at any earnings estimates but this issue is new and not too
many analysts follow the company. It appears that the biggest gains (so far)can
be achieved is by buying the stock when the shipping stocks are in the dumper
and locking in a low stock price that pays a very high dividend. Finally, FRO
has finished spinning off their SFL stock holdings to their shareholders, so
any selling pressure on SFL is over.

nice payoff, so i bought more recently at 3.76

with the BXL position, the cash as you mentioned, and positive earnings more
often than not, the stock should be worth 6 bucks or more...perhaps the buyback
will help it eventually achieve that level, though i think they would better
serve the interests of whatever few investors still remain by instituting a

in any event, it's less than 1% of my portfolio, and i probably won't add

Looks like refiner GI could be taken out at $83/sh. in a cash offer.

I am only a little sorry I sold some at $26. One has to count one's blessings.
If deal is announced, it's a 16 bagger on the remaining shares I bought at $5,
and I have more bought at $18 too.

Once again, I certainly didn't anticipate a ten-bagger plus move when I first
bought, and I never figured that I should have more than a partial position.
Perhaps I've been very wrong to have sold some and not to have added scale up.
OTOH, at least I've been in for a taste.

Great Work on GI (Giant Industries). What was the value proposition that caught
your eye on this one (high book value relative to current market price?).

I have been reviewing my top holdings and evaluating if my original value ideas
still hold water. Most of them do and in fact I would buy more but I have a 5%
rule max holding for any one security.

Could you share two or three of your top 10 holdings, how long you have been in
the investment and your target price for fair value.

EKS

FWIW a stock makes it into my top 10 holdings only after I have accumulated
shares over a period of time, usually more than a year. If I am right, it
appreciates in value over then next 18-36 months and becomes one of those
multi-baggers.

My most recent candidates are EP (El Paso Corp) w/ an average cost of $6.00 and
GLW (Corning) w/ an average cost of $7.00. I continue to like both companies
and have a $25 target for EP and a $55 target for GLW.

E_K_S, about GI: Yes, I bought GI based on low p/book primarily. Well-known
that new refineries weren't being built, so maybe the GI assets were actually
worth somewhere around book or maybe even more. Also bought based on very low
p/e. PSR was very low too, but price/sales always seemed to be low for this and
other refiners, so this was not an important metric for me.

OTOH, I bought small because:
1. Maybe no NEW refineries were being built, but old ones were continually
being upgraded & expanded, and there were better capitalized players with these
big old refiners, e.g. Chevron, Exxon.

2, GI had a high d/e ratio.

3. I didn't (and don't) understand GI's geographical locations and
benefits/risks thereto. They had two refineries in New Mexico and a pipeline to
some New Mexico/Arizona cities. They also owned some retail stations in those
areas. Very dinky company, imo. Additionally and scary, there seemed to be
persistent rumors that a bigger player wanted into GI's territory, and it could
& would do this by building its own pipelines to the areas. An even worse
competitive threat rumor was that another refiner might want the crude supply
sold to GI, and if such a deal were made, it could leave GI 'dry'.

E_K_S. Looking at my top holdings over several portfolios, the two subsectors
that stick out now are refineries and Business Development Companies.

As is my tactic, I like to look around and diversify within a sector, if I find
one stock I like in the sector. In a cursory look, it seems I started buying
the main BDC stocks in 1999, added a couple others a few years later, and when
it seemed to me I had enough of those, people on this thread this past year
suggested other BDC's to look at. I have bought almost all of them - mostly all
in exploratory amounts.

GI wasn't the only downtrodden refiner in 2002. I bought several. And
subsequently I added to positions in a couple.
Missed a few too (aside: I should have held on to your MRO @ $24,
Spekulatius!); there were some that I ignored (I can't figure out why now);
there were some I didn't know existed. (I only recently have a few shares of
DK.)

Cumulating other stocks, depending on what one includes or excludes, I guess
major and minor oils are a big component of several of my portfolios now. So
for example, while I can't say I have a big position in XOM, I can say that if
I add my XOM to my OXY, to CHV, to COP, to E to PBR to PTR to etc. etc. etc.
that's a big slice of my pie of stocks. Most of these bought and added to since
2004.

Three wrongs and one right make a right - in the stock market anyway...
sometimes.

Gulf of Mexico oiler, EPL.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=EPL&t=2y

1. I failed to sell when stock near highs of 25, or when near all time highs in
hurricane season (32) (pre Katrina).

2. I sold some shares for small loss after Katrina.

3. I failed to add to position after EPL announced discouraging post-Katrina
results and stock drifted and sank to new lows.

OTOH. I kept most shares. (in those 4/04 @ $13.75; 10/04 $17.80)

I wrote: "As regards PQ and EPL, I hold shares of both. But because these
stocks have not performed well - relatively, (and because EPL's been hurt by
Katrina), I've been only holding PQ and selling some EPL... Of course, a value
player could certainly argue that the price/value has improved for the
companies because their stock prices are relatively low, and that the companies
are real takeover candidates. It's certainly possible."

Today EPL received takeover bid @ $23-24.

I see according to the Wall Street Journal writing today about EPL:
"The Gulf has become a magnet in recent years for energy investment,
particularly from foreign companies, as new discoveries have energized the
region and the U.S.'s predictable tax and regulatory system have contrasted
favorably with the changing fiscal regimes of foreign governments controlling
promising fields elsewhere."

Thank's Paul - I generally have not focused on sector themes but on individual
stock themes when I look at unique value propositions. However, with your
"sector" approach, you may obtain a better chance of hitting a home run
especially if you buy into a sector that is at a multi-year low. One good
example of a sector that you had good success with is the home builders.

By buying into several companies in a beaten down sector, you are able to
diversify out any specific stock risk. Then as the sector comes into favor
again, all stocks in the sector rise. I have also noticed that many times the
weak companies in the sector usually get bought out or consolidate with the
stronger and larger companies.

E_K_S. Yes, I started doing that after so many times of being wrong in trying
to buy the "best" stock - i.e. trying to buy the stock with the best prospects
in a downtrodden sector. It always seemed like when things improved in the
sector, the other stocks went up more than my pick.

I couldn't figure or guess which had the best prospects: if it was the
strongest company by balance sheet, the weakest company (with the most debt,
hence most leverage and greatest impact to bottom line),the dominant market
share company, the smallest company (which could develop a takeover premium),
the most innovative company, the fastest growing, the alleged 'best of breed',
the company whose stock was beat up the most, the company whose prospects were
liked best by analysts, etc. etc. I just always seemed to choose wrong. So for
me, my preference now is to go for a package.

Water Stocks, I don't see many bargains in the sector. Imo, a buyer now has to
pay up for these stocks.

I have CWT. The stock seems expensive to me now at $36, and outrageously so
when it was over $40/sh. I'll likely want to trim more again if the stock gets
there again. Positives for this stock (as well as others in the sector):
there's a long history of dividend increases, and the stocks do rise over time.
Negatives are the dividend ain't grand, the div. increases are small, and the
stocks' rise until recently have been slow. Quicker and more volatile recently,
possibly because so many people are concerned about a "water problem". Maybe
water stocks getting cachet as a "clean water shortage" play more so than as
the dull utility stocks which they were seen as in past.

I prefer SJT over CWT. I have SJT, but imo, it's too expensive to buy as a
value stock. It'd be one I'd might look at though as a speculative bet on the
sector rising. Because it seems more aggressive and does more with its
landholdings. (Jmo, I could be wrong.)

I've been in cyclical NWPX (large water transmission pipes) for a few years.
NWPX business is good now, and the stock is up. It's a fight for me between my
patience (get out finally while the getting is good) and my expectations (where
the heck are all those supposed funds to be spent on USA infrastructure
rebuilding, i.e. will NWPX ever get some really big big orders?).

I have CWCO. Looks to me like it could be a little monopoly in its little
geographical area. The stock has done well in past, but I've come in recently
(maybe too late). It's a speculative buy for me. The stock is very expensive
(p/e).

I have SWWC. It's very, very expensive, but for some reason unknown to me, it's
traded higher than currently. If the stock can move back up there, I'll really
want to sell.

I like SBS for a buy. It's a Brazilian company, and perhaps there's more to it
than what the positive (imo)Yahoo financials and metrics show. I do not know.
Still, I'm in. I've mentioned SBS here several times this year.

Regarding MDT

THREE LONGTIME MEDTRONIC DIRECTORS purchased shares of the medical-devices
maker, which has been giving investors heart palpitations amid concern over the
health of the defibrillator market.

Five days ago, Jack Schuler, Michael Bonsignore and William Brody collectively
spent $1.34 million to buy 29,000 shares in the first open-market purchases by
Medtronic insiders in over two years, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Shares were priced from $46.19 to $46.30 each.

Medtronic had 1.15 billion shares outstanding as of June 23.

The company didn't return calls seeking comment.

Medtronic shares have steadily declined since the start of the year, declining
20% year-to-date compared to a 9% drop in the Dow Jones U.S. Medical Equipment
Index and a 4% gain in the DJ U.S. Total Market Index. Rival devices-maker St.
Jude is down 28% so far this year.

With the stock hammered, Ben Silverman, director of research at
InsiderScore.com, says "the directors' buying is a nice show of confidence."

"It's a good long-term signal," he adds. "When you look at buying like this
with two years of guidance, these [directors] feel very comfortable with the
guidance and position as to where the company is going."

Guidant's safety recall for its medical devices and concern that the U.S.
government would slash medical reimbursements for medical devices (resolved
this summer with slight cuts) have created an overhang on Medtronic shares.

However, Les Funtleyder, Miller Tabak & Co.'s health-care strategist, says the
real problem has been the "unrealistic" growth rate of the implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) market. Medtronic recently lowered its
guidance for fiscal 2007 and 2008.

Rather than 20%, he expects annual growth rate for these devices, which make up
about a quarter of Medtronic's revenue, to be in the high-single or low-double
digits.

Meanwhile, the decline in Medtronic shares has raised speculation that the
leading defibrillator maker could become a takeover target, particularly after
Johnson & Johnson lost its bid for Guidant to Boston Scientific.

Funtleyder, though, points out that Medtronic's management is against the idea
of a takeover. With Johnson & Johnson, he notes that there "is too much
overlap" between the two companies' operations and would likely require them to
sell off too many assets to gain regulatory approval for the deal to be
feasible.

For now, Medtronic's growth should be slow and steady, which "reflects the
long-term outlook" the directors are affirming with their purchases, says
Funtleyder. He won't recommend buying shares unless they fall closer to $40 or
growth picks up.

Medtronic insiders last purchased shares in June 2004 when Schuler, a director
since 1990 and chair of the corporate governance committee, acquired 40,000
shares in the open market for $2.1 million. The stock was trading at around
$53.

Last week, Schuler bought 25,000 shares for nearly $1.2 million, increasing his
holdings to nearly 200,000 shares, including options and his wife's 8,800
shares.

Schuler has also been chairman of Stericycle, a medical-waste treatment and
recycling company, since 1990 and chairman of Ventana Medical Systems, which
makes medical-diagnostic systems, since 1995. Previously, he served as
president and chief operating officer of health-care-products company Abbott
Laboratories.

Bonsignore, who was appointed a director in 1999 before retiring as chairman
and chief executive of Honeywell International in 2001, made his first
Medtronic transaction in five years. He bought 3,000 shares for $138,800 on
behalf of a personal trust, increasing his overall holdings to about 64,000
shares.

Fellow director, Brody, who joined the board in 1998 and has been the president
of Johns Hopkins University for a decade, doled out $46,300 to buy 1,000
shares. He beneficially owns nearly 74,000 shares. Brody last purchased shares
in December 1999.

Neither Bonsignore nor Brody has ever sold Medtronic shares. Schuler last sold
shares in June 1999.

Given Medtronic has a $50 billion market cap, InsiderScore.com's Silverman says
"you are going to have serious experience on the board and these guys have
pretty exceptional pedigrees."

Medtronic directors are encouraged to hold shares but are not required to,
although they must retain 75% of the shares acquired through options for at
least three years. The company has indicated in its filings that its management
team meets the minimum stock-ownership thresholds as stipulated by Medtronic's
corporate guidelines.

My opinion regarding SCU (Storm Cat)

this is still a show me story. The stock was overhyped about a year ago and now
the stock is trending down since the Momo players have left. What prevented me
from buying when i heard the story from you was that it appeared to me that the
stock is managed for news flow rather than numbers. Why did I think so:

1) The ridiculous project with Coal bed methane in Mongolia. Way to much to
chew on for a dinky company like Storm Cat imo.

2) With all those acreage in frontier Coal bed methane, Storm Cat decided that
they do want to be operator when they bought producing properties in the Powder
River basin, where everybody knows that the gas is there and leases and are
expensive. The Powder River basin at this point is simply a matter of economies
of scale and low cost operation, not of exploration. Storm Cat does not have a
business there. My take on this is that the claims of a huge reserve base on
their large acreage must be taken with a grain of salt, otherwise they would
just go out and drill. I think the Powder basin acquisition was also done for
news flow. From the numbers i can see (Depreciation cost is around 2.7$/mmcfe)
they are unlikely to make much money there as long as gas stays around 6.5$.

In order for me to get interested, Storm Cat would have to show some success
with their own acreage in Canada. However even in the latest presentation on
their website i don't see much evidence that they are going to explore (10M$ in
Capex won't go very far at current dayrates).

So my short answer is that SCU does not make the grade right now for me to
invest in, but it's interesting enough that i keep it on my watch list.

Interesting analysis of Dell vs. rivals. WSJ

But in the past few years, buying behavior in the PC world has changed. Much of
the growth has come from consumer demand rather than the business market on
which Dell focused. What's more, people looking for a new home computer are
increasingly turning to laptops. There Dell is particularly weak: Its models
lack the pizzazz and features of rivals. For laptops especially, consumers
prefer to hold and test models in a store, but Dells aren't sold there.
According to NPD Group, 56% of laptops sold to consumers in the first quarter
of this year were bought in a store, up from 50% two years ago.

Dell has largely ignored the consumer boom although it says it still considers
consumers an important market. For a while it had part-time workers with an
annual turnover rate of 300% taking calls from customers who wanted to buy a
PC. The company has poured money into corporate products such as printers,
storage systems and computer servers. It nixed some overtures from retailers to
sell its wares in stores. At a conference in 2004, Dell Chief Executive Kevin
Rollins declared, "We have never focused on the consumer as a company."

At the same time, rivals such as H-P, Gateway and Apple Computer Inc., have
charged ahead in the consumer PC market. In particular, H-P cut costs to become
competitive with Dell, began working more closely with retailers and redoubled
its marketing efforts. As Dell cut prices, H-P invested in consumer-friendly
features in its notebooks. H-P computers, using a laser, can write a label on a
specially coated music CD with artist and title so users don't have to use a
marker. And people can watch movies on H-P laptops without booting up the
computer, a feature that Dell now offers too

Im losing money on it too right now. but somewhere i read that when you buy a

What annoys me to no end is that I missed the bottom of the oil shares because
all the technical indications point to it being a bottom but there was no
insider buying anywhere so I bought zilch. I was looking at drillers like rig

any insider buying.

more on CHou from Moneysense a canadian business magazine:

"Reading Graham taught Chou that most people buy stocks the wrong way. They get
carried away by emotion and buy shares that are rocketing upward. But that
strategy is doomed to failure. Think about the mentality of a smart shopper:
she doesn't load up on eggs because their price is shooting upward. Instead she
looks for bargains. "All you have to do is transfer that mental approach to
stocks," Chou says. "But when people buy stocks, instead of looking for
bargains, they tend to listen to stories and chase stocks that are going up."

To put his reading into practice, Chou helped launch an investment club at Bell
Canada in 1981. He and six co-workers began with a total of $51,000. Five of
those original investors are still in the fund to this day, and four of them
are now millionaires. In fact, if you had invested just $50,000 with Chou when
he turned the investing club into the Associates Fund back in 1982, you would
be worth $1.6 million yourself.

His mantra from day one was to always invest with what Graham called a margin
of safety. Chou won't buy a stock unless he can get it at a 40% or 50% discount
to what he estimates its true value to be. When he began investing in the '80s,
he was delighted to find that the market was swimming with such bargains — but
he now finds that the obvious deals have disappeared. "As recently as 1999
there were some sectors that you could buy for cheap," Chou says, "but right
now, almost all sectors are fairly valued. The mispricings disappear when
there's a lot of money chasing deals."

If that sounds discouraging, keep in mind that Chou is a natural pessimist, and
his investors have become used to his annual forecasts of doom and gloom. In
his 2004 annual report, for instance, Chou wrote: "In today's climate, almost
all sectors are overvalued … We would caution all investors that from these
overvalued levels the chances of a large permanent loss of capital are
extremely high." He added that the double-digit returns of the past would be
"virtually impossible to duplicate." So what kind of return did his Associates
fund reap in 2005? A rock-solid 13.7%.

Despite his dire warnings, Chou has been remarkably consistent through good
markets and bad. In 24 years of investing, his Associates fund has had only
three losing years, and because his strategy doesn't rely on rising markets,
his performance has almost no correlation with other funds. For instance, his
worst year in recent history (-9.6% in 1999) took place during the tech boom,
when most Canadian investors were flying high. After the crash, in 2001 and
2002, he posted successive annual returns of 21.4% and 30%.

Chou applies Graham's value strategy using three tactics. First, he keeps his
eyes peeled for what he calls "special situations" — companies facing
short-term problems that result in temporary mispricings under unusual
circumstances. Second, he likes to buy shares in what he jokingly refers to as
CRAP (Cannot Realize A Profit) companies. Chou says the market is prone to
overreacting when stocks are heading for the toilet, so failing companies are
often irrationally valued for less than they would be worth if they liquidated
their assets. He buys baskets of such companies, knowing that he may lose money
on three out of 10, but more than make up for those losses with profits on the
other seven.

His final tactic is more akin to the way that Warren Buffett invests and it's
increasingly Chou's favorite. It entails spending countless hours searching for
well-run companies with growth potential that, for some reason, are trading for
much less than they're worth. Because the market is so efficient, such
companies are extremely rare and often only found among those with short-term
problems, but they offer excellent long-term prospects if they're blessed with
strong management. Chou is lucky to find one or two during a whole year of
searching. But once he's found one, Chou doesn't hesitate to bet 5% or more of
his portfolio on that single stock. "When you know you're buying a good
company, it's like getting a straight flush," he says. "They're hard to find,
so when you've got one, you have to capitalize on it."

Taken together, Chou's three approaches have delivered a very strange
portfolio, packed with unfamiliar names and companies most investors wouldn't
touch with a barge pole. Just over six months ago, for instance, the troubled
retailer Sears Holdings made up a whopping 16% of the equities portion of
Chou's Associates Fund. MCI, which is basically the smoldering remains of an
imploded WorldCom, was his No. 2 holding, along with Boskalis Westminster, an
international dredging contractor that clears mud out of waterways.

What does Chou see in these dogs? As always, a margin of safety. He invested in
Sears Holdings, for instance, because most analysts thought Wal-Mart was going
to crush the department store chain, so the stock was selling for peanuts. "But
I calculated that the real estate holdings alone for Sears were worth more than
$40 or $50 (U.S.) a share, and I was able to buy it for just $25 a share," Chou
recalls. "Later, the analysts said the real estate was worth more like $75 to
$100 a share." A year and a half after Chou bought its stock, Sears was trading
for over $120. "

I initially liked Redstone as a somewhat responsible owner of VIA. Recently I
have more and more doubt regarding his judgement:

1) While not related to VIA Redstone's investment in badly managed MWY seems
pretty stupid especially considering his stock purchases at around 20$/share
(now around 7$)

2) Canning Tom Cruise is one thing and maybe a sound business decision but
announcing the reasons like Redstone did is going to cost him when trying to
find new talent. Even worse, this would have been Freston's job to do what
Redstone did and was one reason why Freston left, IMO.

3) I predict that Frestons departure will be followed by more departures.
Freston is a founder of MTV and has been with the company for 20 years. I don't
think he will have much trouble to find new employment and draw management
talent from VIA.

3) VIA stock may be setting up as a bargain again but i regard todays weakness

pcyhuang - you are into cheap thrills apparently and MLS is one of them.

FWIW, i found S*P ratings pretty much useless as an investment guide. in many

am particular careful with higher rated stocks whith charts that are turning
south, it seems that inevitable they start to loose their S&P stars when it's
to late. S&P's predictive power is so bad that i started to look at low rated
S&P stocks (2 stars or less) <g>.

As far as MLS is concerned, i think it is a pure speculative play. Management
is still in place and it seems that further reevaluations of their properties
are inevitable. Their a substantial financing risk and also a large liability
due to shareholder lawsuits. Add to that rising interest rates and it's clear
that this is a pretty dangerous stock to own. The recent sale of Xanadu has

None would appreciate reading the off-the-cuff cynical opening statement of
your remarks. Otherwise, you may just go on one's "ignore" list.

I think MLS is worthy of serious investment consideration.
Here is a sensible assesmemt of the current state of affairs from Morningstar.

"Analyst Note 08-22-2006

Mills Corp. MLS is handing over its Meadowlands Xanadu project to Colony
Capital, an opportunistic private real-estate-related firm. Mills will issue
Colony (and its partners in the project) 4.5 million common shares as well as
dole over its $480 million equity investment in the project, which will become
subordinated and could likely prove worthless. While Mills may have the chance
to recoup some of its investment upon undisclosed financial transactions (most
likely a permanent loan being placed on Xanadu), we have decided to write off
the investment as well as include the cost associated with issuing additional
common shares in our fair value estimate. We had previously written down Mills'
investment in the Xanadu project, but since the cost associated with unloading
the project and all future funding obligations exceeded our expectations, we
are inclined to reduce our fair value estimate by an additional $6 per share.
In addition, we are also electing to incorporate into our fair value estimate
the potential costs associated with a possible legal liability related to
previous aggressive accounting practices, as opposed to capturing the potential
liability in our margin of safety. As a result, we are reducing our fair value
estimate to $39 per share from $46 and do not foresee any further reductions in
our fair value considering that nearly all of the value associated with the
company's development pipeline has been removed. Without the Meadowlands Xanadu
project, Mills exploration of strategic alternatives seems increasingly likely
to speed along rapidly once the company's financials are produced in September.

Thesis 08-22-2006

After cruising along as one of the nation's top developers for 10 years, a
series of jolts has forced Mills Corp. to seek out strategic alternatives.
While this no longer seems like an opportunity to invest alongside a management
team that will compound value for shareholders over a long period of time, we
still believe the company's assets offer tremendous value."

I believe that MLS will overcome its temporary set back and misunderstanidng by
the investment community.

is that there problems are way way larger than what i consider a "temporary
setback". i might consider this label for PSUN maybe (which at least has a
decent balance sheet.

When MLS was trading in it's 50's, a large part of the perceived value was in
MLS development pipeline (Xanadu's etc.) which apparently is worth less than
zero (they wrote of 500M$ on Xanadu). Now their balance sheet is damaged, cost
of capital is way up, which is really a problem with a REIT like MLS. I think
they need a buyout to extract value for their shareholders, but with all the
liabilities, buyers will most likely ask to buy their properties outright,
rather than the whole MLS mess.

It was one of the most reliable REITs to own, a nice total return play.

ran her own cooking school, and I'm strongly guessing she REALLY REALLY does
knows more than the snobby(?), snotty(?) clerks she's had the misfortune to run
into in the stores she's visited.

OTOH, for those who shop there - all right, so the clerks might be okay, but I
just must support my wife here. Stock needs to be a heck of a lot cheaper
before I will consider dealing with it and my wife -g-.
