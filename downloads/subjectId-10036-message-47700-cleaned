CLF at 61.85$ - decided to buy a first lot of this iron ore and coal company. I
like the recent dividend raise (yielding 4%) which appears to indicate a more
cautious capital allocation. The stock is cheap based on metrics like PE and
EV/EBITDA but of course earnings could drop if prices for their products fall.

Negatives are problems to keep the cost contained and they still have not
figured out what to do with the Chromite asset. I find it positive that they
supposedly have a nice FCF this year ~700M$ by some estimates, which gives them
ample headroom to pay a dividend.

I think there is more pain to come as china uses 50% of the iron ore in the
world. They don't have a choice, but to cut down on construction. And they are
doing it, no matter if they are admitting or not. Canadian dollar started
creeping down. For me this is one more proof of the lower demand for natural
resources.

re China - yes China is a concern. However, I believe that the fact that China
uses 50% of the iron or in the world is misleading. My guess is that China
imports 50% of the iron ore in the world is probably correct, but since China
is the manufacturing plant for the entire world, most of it is re-exported as
finished or half finished goods.

What matters is not where these goods are build, (if they weren't build in
China, they would be build elsewhere) but in what quantities they are consumed.
To that end, I just don't see a crash in demand coming, with Europe flatlining,
US showing slow growth and still health growth in the rest of the world in
aggregate.

Secondly, CLF valuation is very undemanding and it is obvious that quite a bit
of fear is already reflected in the stock price. Now, even if earnings fall for
CLF significantly and CLF reacting and scaling back their Capex, as they
apparently are willing to do, they could hold or even increase their dividend,
which I am guessing would support the shares. So, unless we have a total crash
for iron or and coal prices, i can see a potential for lower CLF share prices
but it would not be a sure thing.
If it happens to be that the Chinese slowdown fears are overrated (as the
recent rise in Chinese manufacturing indicators and the health steel production
recently may show), the shares have strong appreciation potential, unless you
believe that a stock with a health balance sheet, trading at 6x earnings and a
4% dividend yield is not cheap.

Last not least, with CLF modest market cap and low valuation and record low
interest rates, I can see one of big resource companies like BHP, RIO or Anglo
American make a bid for this company, as it is probably cheaper to buy mines on
the NYSE, then to build them on a green field where cost overruns are the norm
nowadays.

Generalized studies IMHO are not worth much. Almost none of their conclusions
are mechanically repeatable (as poor O'Shaughnessy results have shown) and
there is no proof that you still outperform if you use their criterion but
filter on it (or use another worse criterion and filter on that one).

Isn't EBITDA/EV (part of) magic formula and also what Clownbuck uses? (Or

I own some Posco and prefer it over MT. Both are cheap. I am thinking that the
upside for CLF is higher because iron ore is more of a constraining resource
than steelmaking capacity.

Posco is supposed to be a low cost leader and they have a very strong balance
sheet. 3rd Avenue likes them and wrote about the stock in their quarterly
newsletter.Posco did have mixed success to venture into iron ore ventures (to
become supply self sufficient), which is a negative.

Thanks for the info on the French withholding tax.

I am very familiar with the process to recover the withholding tax in Canada. I
don't know how much money you are talking about to make it worthwhile but you
can recover the withholding tax with Form NR7-R but it has to be filed through
by your broker in their accounting department. You cannot make application
yourself. But the catch is the fairly punitive fees involved to make
application which applies to each separate calendar year filed. There is 2 year
statute of limitations so it is now too late to file for CY 2009.

.
Considering the fees with my broker you would have to earn roughly $1700 in
gross annual Canadian dividends to break even.

Hi Sergio, not changing my mind, just following through with the plan.
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=28060940

PS: we think a bit differently here- a 10 year old article<g>

Vermont State Rep. Fred Maslack has read the Second Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution, as well as Vermont 's own Constitution very carefully, and his
strict interpretation of these documents is popping some eyeballs in New
England and elsewhere.

Maslack recently proposed a bill to register "non-gun-owners" and require them
to pay a $500 fee to the state. <u>Thus Vermont would become the first state to
require a permit for the luxury of going about unarmed and assess a fee of $500
for the privilege of not owning a gun.</u>

Maslack read the "militia" phrase of the Second Amendment as not only the
right of the individual citizen to bear arms, but as a clear mandate to do so.
He
believes that universal gun ownership was advocated by the Framers of the
Constitution as an antidote to a "monopoly of force" by the government as well
as criminals. Vermont 's constitution states explicitly that <u>"the people
have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the State" and
those persons who are "conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms" shall be
required to "pay such equivalent."</u>

Clearly, says Maslack,<u> Vermonters have a constitutional obligation to arm
themselves, so that they are capable of responding to "any situation that may
arise."</u>

Under the bill, adults who choose not to own a firearm would be required to
register their name, address, Social Security Number, and driver's license
number with the state. "There is a legitimate government interest in knowing
who is not prepared to defend the state should they be asked to do so," Maslack
says.

Vermont already boasts a high rate of gun ownership along with the least
restrictive laws of any state it's currently the only state that allows a
citizen to carry a concealed firearm without a permit.

This combination of plenty of guns and few laws regulating them has resulted
in a crime rate that is the third lowest in the nation.

"America is at that awkward stage. It's too late to work within the system, but
too early to shoot the bastards."

This makes sense! There is no reason why gun owners should have to pay taxes to
support police protection for people not wanting to own guns. Let them
contribute their fair share and pay their own way.

Sounds reasonable to me!

Non-gun owners require more police to protect them and
this fee should go to paying for their defense!

I did not own any warrants prior to your post, but I am buying now. Thanks for
the reminder.

Barron's had a good article on ROIC a few months offering an opinion on the
warrants:

<u>What's potentially more interesting than the shares, however, are its
warrants, which trade under the symbol ROICW. Each entitles the holder to buy
one ROI share at $12 before Oct. 23, 2014; they expire after that date.

Given the stock's rise, the warrants are becoming attractive to some investors.
The warrants closed around 85 cents last week, down from a high of 95 cents on
Feb. 8.

ROI is run by Stewart Tanz, whom Robert Fields, a co-portfolio manager of hedge
fund Ana Partners calls a well-respected CEO. He says the company is
underleveraged and is in a good position to continue growing. ROI has about
$700 million in assets to $170 million in debt, for a total debt to assets
ratio of 25%. Ana Partners has lately been buying the warrants,

The stock is effectively trading at the exercise price. Assuming ROI continues
to lift its profits in the next two years, Fields figures ROI could add $4 to
$5 to its stock price before the exercise period ends.

The firm, he adds, is motivated to do some kind of deal to take out some of the
warrants or delay or stagger their exercise period because of the potential
dilution. There are about 41.4 million warrants outstanding, compared with the
50 million-share float. In the most recent fourth-quarter earnings call, the
company alluded to working with warrant holders to "structure a mutually
beneficial transaction."

Fields says the warrants are worth however much the stock price moves up from
current levels. The higher the share price above $12, the more valuable the
warrants. If the stock rises 25%, to $15, the warrants could more than triple.
But the risk is much greater too, as they could expire worthless in 2014 if the
stock doesn't top $12.</u>

So help me out on which metric is best for measuring value when looking at
these companies:

Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) -NasdaqGS
Walt Disney Company (The) Commo (NYSE: DIS)
CBS Corporation Class B Common (NYSE: CBS)

http://goo.gl/jNnX0

I peeled off 25% of my CMCSA bought 10/2005 (@ $18.85) as the stock was trading
near it's all time high and their recently reported earnings were not that good
(at least based on expectations). CMCSA recently acquired NBC to diversify
their business away from direct cable services where margins are dictated by
the content providers and monthly customer cable bills are at the highest
levels in the history of the business. Internet streaming may/will displace
premium cable channels. As a result, I decided to take 25% of my long term
capital gains off the table.

Similar companies are CBS and DIS but neither have the investment in the
infrastructure to deliver internet and cable services as CMCSA has. I know you
believe that EV/EBITDA is the best measure to use where the lower value is the
better value buy.

Here are the links where I obtained the relevant company financial statistics:

CMCSA:
http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&btn=s_ok&mode=&symbol=NASDAQ%3ACMCSA
DIS:
http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&btn=s_ok&mode=&symbol=dis&s_ok=OK
CBS:
http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&btn=s_ok&mode=&s_symbol_select=NYSE%3
DIS&symbol=cbs&s_ok=OK

<pre>
<u>EV/EBITA</u>

CMCSA: Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDA 6.88
DIS: Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDA 11.39
CBS: Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDA 11.58

<u>PE</u>

CMSCA: P/E Ratio (1 month ago) - LTM 20.0
DIS: P/E Ratio (1 month ago) - LTM 16.5
CBS: P/E Ratio (1 month ago) - LTM 17.6
</pre>

So based on the EV/EBITA, CMCSA is probably still undervalued by 2:1 when
looking at the alternative candidate stocks DIS & CBS. I know that the core
asset composition for each company is different but the market cap for CMCSA
and DIS are equivalent so some of the same value measures are reasonable to use
(ie EV/EBITA).

If you look at the long term (greater than 5 years) price chart for the three
companies (CMCSA, DIS & CBS), you can see that CMCSA has had the best
performance with DIS & CBS coming in at 30% less.

<img src='/public/342737_9aa96941ca4d61825763ce93b5ad2516.png'>

So can I conclude that CMCSA is still the better value of the companies? What's
your take?

Disclosure: I own shares in CMCSA but have no position in DIS or CBS. I have
considered DIS (who owns very profitable ESPN ) and CBS as replacements for
CMCSA.

re GM -
 Any thoughts ?

My thought is that your calculation of the EV value is wrong. You have not
taken into account. When I subtract net current liabilities from net current
assets, i get about a 12B$ surplus on net current assets (which is not quite
cash).

However there is ~ 10.3B$ in cash and there are 32B$ in Pension/healthcare
liabilities.

Look at it another way, GM's intangible assets are ~ to GM shareholder assets,
which means that tangible book is about zilch.

Also as far as pensions are concern, keep in mind that for GM pension plan, the
gross liability is 133B$, which is covered by 108B$ in pension plant asset for
a 25B$ deficit. the dangerous thing about the high gross liability is that the
return assumption is still 8%, which is hard to achieve using a high fixed
income allocation. If the expected return of assets were lowered by 10%, the
gross (not net!) liability would increase by almost 10%, do the math.

If you now calculate all those liabilities and add them to the EV, you will
find that GM trades at a premium to other and much better positioned car
companies like Daimler and even VW.DE (if you eliminate the finance ops from
the passive and active side).

re DIS, CBS, CMCSA

I think you got the basic idea right to look at EV/EBITDA. I don't think that
CMCSA can be compared directly with DIS and CBS, the reason being that CMCSA
has significant capital expenditures, which reduce FCF (or owners earnings).
DIS and CBS can be directly compared and I would choose DIS because it has a
larger moat.

For CMCSA I would also look at the FCF yield (FCF/market cap) and decide if
that owners yield is high enough to justify holding the stock.

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: UVIC, GLW, MSFT, MHR-D, GAME,

New positions: BH, MAUXF
Positions increased: PMGLF, SNDK, MGDDY, MSFT, GLW, PWRD, CYOU, AMNF
Positions reduced: GST-A
Positions eliminated: CTEL
Flip-flop:

On the sell side, I decided that there is a risk of GST-A price dropping as
natgas prices are going down and GST results are not so great. I sold a
substantial part of GST-A. It still might be safe, but I decided not to hold
it.

CTEL managed to sell its business for more than market cap, but decided to
return only part of the cash to shareholders investing the rest into TV content
business. Since this may not yield earnings soon, I sold the stock.
Fortunately, my basis was low, but I am not happy with the result. Perhaps it's
yet another example of risks involved in Chinese companies.

For some reason CEOs of a lot of successful Chinese internet companies are
drawn to movie and TV businesses. It's unclear whether glamor, fame or
something else drives them from their successful businesses elsewhere, but a
number of companies have invested into TV/movie/content while distancing
themselves from their cash cows. That's part of the story with GAME where SNDA
is becoming more content company while paying less attention to quite
successful online gaming part.

I continued buying PWRD and CYOU as the valuations are quite cheap.

I started exploratory position in MAUXF - at the current 52 week high. Probably
that's a kiss of death for the stock. The results so far and the valuation
seemed attractive though.

I decided to pay the entrance ticket to BH drama and bought a small position.

BH - yeah, it's a bet on the jockey. He is obviously arrogant - definitely not
Buffett :). The question is whether he's Charlie Munger or Aubrey McClendon (or
Donald Trump). :) Being arrogant might be OK when you're a passive investor; I
am not sure it's a great quality for operational manager and activist investor.
Even if activist investor has to push for changes, this can be done with some
modicum of respect.

This said, I am interested in how things progress, so I bought a small
position. I will consider buying more or selling depending on how things go.

NMFC - Nice find.

High div., very attractive margins, three consecutive Qs of div. increases (and
not sure if this is good or not, but I recognize several of their investment
companies).

I followed you on this stock and will stay in as long as they stay the course.

Sergio,

what is your opinion about FTR. I see they pay more dividend than they earn. Is
it that Google is wrong?

Re: National Fuel Gas Co. (NFG)

With the market down 1.25% (-162 Dow points), NFG is one of the few gainers
+2.5% at $46.90/share +1.11. This was one that I wanted to buy (and still on my
watch list) and glad to see a lack of sellers. A $44-$45 entry point would
still be quite good.

No news on the company and the volume traded is about average too.

There is news on NFG - earnings.
I haven't dug too deeply, but I guess, given that NFG has a substantial nat gas
component, they weren't as bad as expected.
I'll take the 2% plus move in a down market.

I was looking @17B cash and 14B marketable securities - 8B LTD

They do have 32B pension shortfall

I did not include pension/post retirement benefits. This is what appears to be
hurting the stock price. Since they don't have put any money in it until 2015
this could decrease some as the stock market rise.

I have started buying Rising cash hoard and auto inds rebounding, also GM and
UAW are agreeing to handle the shortfall.

Georgi, FTR pulled a fast one when they cut their dividend dramatically after
issuing a press release stating that the dividend was safe. The stock now
trades at a discount to its peers and still offers a higher dividend than its
peers. FTR carries a lot of debt with a large chunk due and payable next year.
They don't have much cash, so the div. cut is understandable.

The payout ratio is now just over 40%. I don't know why Yahoo has 500% or what
Google has. So, overall FTR is a value play relative to its peer group and now
has a generous and substainable dividend. I don't own it and won't be buying
because the same management is in place that lied about the safety of the
dividend.

I had followed Ditchdigger into FTR and he was more nimble than I in getting
out.

Google has. So, overall FTR is a value play relative to its peer group and now
has a generous and substainable dividend. I don't own it and won't be buying
because the same management is in place that lied about the safety of the
dividend.

I had followed Ditchdigger into FTR and he was more nimble than I in getting
out.

Georgi, FTR pulled a fast one when they cut their dividend dramatically after
issuing a press release stating that the dividend was safe. The stock now
trades at a discount to its peers and still offers a higher dividend than its
peers. FTR carries a lot of debt with a large chunk due and payable next year.
