Abe: What I'm interested in discovering is how to use facets of Buffet's
approach to find stocks that are not yet "toll bridges" or "consumer
monopolies." In others words, how could his concepts be used to find good
values with only five years of history? Surely there must be a way to
synergistically (I know, I hate that word too) combine a traditional value
approach with Buffet's criteria.

Or how else do we satisfy our need to invest when Buffet type stocks are not to
be found? Arbitrage? CANSLIM? Webs? (g)

Mike, Dr. Mike: Well we all have different value investing styles. Guess you've
taught me that. I think medical doctors have it extremely tough in the market.
My belief is that medicine - even if it is a practice - is still based on a
very analytical, reasoned approach. (At least I hope it is -g-) A cause and
effect type of thing. Logic first then maybe insight. If this translates into
an investing approach, then danger no. 1 IMO is to overlook or downplay
extremely important non-analytic factors --- the emotional aspects of BOTH the
market and the investor himself/herself.

Second I think Doctors are expected by their patients to be right. Doctors as
infallible beings. Maybe doctors come into the world confident in their
rightness and righteousness. And Doctors I'd guess are mostly right their whole
lives (well the ones in my undergrad classes were). Win every award, ace (if
people still use that word) every test, been told since they were three that
they are very smart. Can do anything. So maybe the expectation of society or
their own expectations are that since they succeeded in becoming a doctor, they
should certainly be able to succeed in conquering the stock market. If one can
fix people one ought to be able to come up with a solution for stocks.
(Overconfidence or inabilty to deal with failure = danger #2).

Getting an MD degree is an isolating experience I'd guess.
(might be very wrong here). Not too much contact with businesses as they are
run or the crooks that run 'em (Danger #3 = the MD who listens to brokers' tall
tales). And MD's with plenty of money (well -g- compared to some of us) who
constantly get sought out by these sharpies (danger #4)for all kinds of
investments (not just stocks).

Hey nothing intended here to slur or degrade the medical guys. Just that
whereas MD's might think it's nothing so difficult that they can't
win/succeed/overcome/get wealthy at/etc. - I think it's very difficult for
them. But heck, so what? It's difficult for everybody.

Don't you screw up!! Not even once. Else your error reflects on the method and
on you personally, Dr. and journalist Mike who is expected to know everything

Actually, I hope I'm not quite judgmental like that. After all, I told Honest
Abe - and I believe - it's a statistical game (most times) . I'm not one for
Buffett here at all. Only Buffett never seems to have losers. Everybody else
not only has losers but makes mistakes all the time and I mean ALL the time
(well maybe James Clarke and some rare few others might be excepted) - fail to
sell, sell to soon, sell too late, buy too soon, never bought, bought too much,
bought not enough. And repeat these same mistakes over and over again in spite
of best intentions. Therefore, it's not a matter of avoiding mistakes (Buffett
losses), it's a matter of learning to live with mistakes that will inevitably
be made. And in this light, for some people, it would be especially helpful for
their performance if they could give themselves permission to own a stock that
turns bad.

First, I think it should be easier to find the next consumer monopoly than the
next toll bridge. The latter is more of a true monopoly than the former.

So, how to find the next consumer monopoly? I'd follow Peter Lynch's "Beat the
Street". Find a company that makes a product you can't do without, but the rest
of the world hasn't discovered it yet. Then, see if that company's growth rate,
ROE, etc. are consistently going up.

Of course, it is easier to find a consumer monopoly than the next consumer
monopoly, and it is easier to find good financials with a consumer monopoly
than the next consumer monopoly. I'm guessing that your concern is all the
consumer monopolies right now are just too expensive. I simply plan to wait
until I find one that's not.

Ron: Yes I do indeed think we learn more from our mistakes (than our
successes). That is why you will see me advocate that people - especially young
people just starting out - try everything. The best advice -
conventional-wisdom-advice - investigate before you buy, buy value, do what
successful investors say to do, read everything you can, -- phooey. Nobody
wants to listen to that dull pedantic stuff anyway (except maybe smart guys who
started off as kids with paper routes or something -g-). So I say: try options.
Dance with futures. Margin as much as you absolutely dare. Sell short. Day
trade. Try going with a few hot tips - see how it works for you. If it's a hot
stock, jump on it. Pile it all on one or two or three positions. If your stock
goes up and up, buy more of it.
My idea is that the more you lose and the quicker you lose it, the faster you
will learn (the risk being that you must keep going and not give up and buy
real estate or something -- as so many must have done who gave up in the '70's
-g-)
If I think again about pressure to be successful, I think about some people I
see in gambling casinos who must win. They need the money. Their lives seem to
be on the line. You know this to be true yourself right? (the impression I mean
- not that you gamble in casinos -g-)that if you HAVE to win, you will not.
Don't know why that is, but it is -- anyhow that's the way I see it (have no
empirical evidence of course).
Kinda sorta the same with stocks; if you have to win, have to be successful
with every pick, I just think this puts pressure on and that is antithetical to
making good business judgment calls. Not that people won't be successful, just
that it adds an additional burden. To any people here who might believe they
have their job or ego or reputation tied into making a stock call, my request
is, please... don't hold back here for that absolutely perfect pitch (ONLY
Buffett is a 1000% hitter)... just give us (and more importantly yourself)the
best you've got when you've got it and it looks like it's reasonably over the
plate. you are going to strike out sometimes... and it's okay --we all ('cept
one Multibillionairre) do. Relax and enjoy the game.
Not intending to give any specific advice to any general or specific
individuals. More like trying to get my own needs met. I want the best
unhedged,unwashed, unvarnished opinions - and I don't mean stock screen lists -
that I can get-- I still need help too. I own WDC and APM, and my $3.50 RACC
just went into bankruptcy at .25 -- and foolish me... I STILL see value with
all these companies -gg--. (Yes, still own those WBB shares too)

Your analogies about playing stocks and casino gambling ring true. As a kid I
used to gamble at the race track (horses), and there the old timers used to
say, "Don't bet with scared money!". This is similar to your thought about
having to win. Many put themselves in a position where if they lose, they must
keep on going until they win. Instead of winning though, they just throw good
money after bad. I believe this to be because one starts to think irrationally
when they start to lose, they don't stay within themselves and regroup, instead
they "go for broke".

I guess what I'm saying is that you need to have a basic plan and always come
back to it if you start to get out in left field. This I believe is contrary to
what you have said, but it put me through college with my track winnings. Being
a novice to stocks though, I just hope that I can duplicate my good fortune, in

I agree - maybe not quite as passionately, but I agree.

Momentum investing, small caps, the next big thing are all a lot more exciting
to invest in than long term value stocks. And if you try the others first and
realize they fail, or at least are a lot harder than they look, you will become
more disciplined to the noble and boring attributes of true value investing.

I started investing early on and tried everything but value investing, except
for McDonalds - I bought it and forgot about it. After two years of trying out
CANSLIM, Zacks top ranked stocks, etc., I was fortunate enough to break even -
but only because of my now long term gain in McDonalds.

"Copy Shamelessly" are words to live by - I saw that quote in a Business Week
article one time. With millions of people trying out millions of theories on
investing, why try to create your own? If it truly works well, it will continue
to work well. Therefore when I see Buffett 'discover' a method of investing
that beats the pants off of everyone, I will simply do my best to Copy
Shamelessly. If someone else comes along and through some other method starts
to beat Buffett year after year, I will most likely simply become a new student
of that discipline. But, at this point, it would take many years of superior
returns to convince me there is a better style in the stock market. So a
Buffetologist I will remain!

Paul,

Don't knock the real estate. I bought two warehouses in the '70s that are now
returning annual lease payments equal to 60% of the investment in addition to
400% value appreciation. Farm land that brings in 6% above taxes, value gain
doubled in 10 years in addition to underlying mineral deposits worth 25 times
purchase. IMO Real Estate is still the safest and best long term value a person
can invest in. IMO - REITs have gotten full valued in the last couple of years,
but it's hard to ignore the 8% dividends and value appreciation.

I've always been a risk taker, but options and day trading are things I
wouldn't consider. While on vacation I talked with a professional day trader
that, with a dozen others like him, sits in front of a computer all day
investing hundreds of thousands looking for 1/8, 1/4 gain on big caps. Trades
are made instantly by computer tie to exchange. He makes over $100K a year ON
COMMISSION. The layman investor can't begin to compete with an operation like
this.

What's an SOES broker?

This guy has a fund of money to invest - I didn't get the amount but I'd
presume at least $1M - and he collects 25% of profit he makes. The amount he
has to work with depends on past success. Their computers have business news
running across the screen and they look for stocks they think will move, try to
get in and out for short term gains. He starts 2 hours before open and runs to
market close. They have some kind of computer tie in that puts the orders to
the floor immediately. He trades stock and options, only large cap issues. The
company he works for owns the computers and funds the operation. He has a
salary fund that he draws against but has to keep so much of it in the fund to
hedge against losses.

If he collects 25% of the profits, that would be an incentive fee, not
commissions.

SOES stands for Small Order Exchange System. There are lots of SOES brokerage
houses set up in the larger cities across the US. The SOES system was set up to
give small traders access directly to the exchange.

I have never traded through the SOES system, but I have some friends who do.
The brokerage houses that offer SOES give the trader full access to all the
computer and software needed to trade. The traders are primarily looking to
arbitrage across SOES and Instinet - I think those are the two systems, and
some play off momentum moves, but from what I've seen they are all going for
1/8 and 1/16ths of a point. The trading is point and click, and it is
automatically done in round lots of 1000 shares.

I know one guy making a ton of money trading, but it's the brokerage houses
that are really making the bank.

Look up 'SOES' in a search engine, you will find all the information you need.
Keep in mind that it is the complete opposite of value investing!

be reflected in the next earnings report, a nice positive surprise that I
expect will attract a lot of attention and new investors.

Accounting is conservative and management eschews hype. I would never describe
CKFR as a "value" stock, but I am so personally convinced that it is building a

selling time. You pick calls further out in time..at a price
to risk factor you chose, you buy the calls, short the stock
then sell puts. "You sell puts," if she gets put to you it closes
your short. Normally you sell puts in shorter time frames as you
get more for them. There has been a lot of money made this way,
go ask Michel Burke when it got started some years ago.
It is not a play for dim wits you really have to crunch numbers.

I will add you have to find were you get more over time selling
the puts than you have to pay for the calls, that's your
profit margin if she don't fall. If she does you make the short
and the puts u sold pays for the calls, it gets more complicated

Could not disagree more with you on AOL, though I would not pay the current
price. No barriers to entry? Let me name two.
1. Content. Many AOL users value the proprietary content. An entrant with 1% of
AOL's user base can't provide that kind of content because they can't afford
to. AOL's product is not simply internet access.
2. Switching costs. This is my favorite, because everybody thinks there aren't
any. I can switch providers tomorrow, right? But what about that e-mail address
I have given to so many friends over the years? It is of great value to me to
keep that address the same.
Sure, there are ways AOL could blow it anyway. They nearly lost me a year ago
when you couldn't dial in except at 3:00 in the morning. But they did solve
that problem. A $2 price increase for a product I am satisfied with is not
going to matter to me. I already think I get much greater value from the
service than it costs me.

If you want to talk stock price, there's a different story, but I don't think
its as crazy as it looks. I was very close to buying this stock a year ago, and
missed it. Believe me, it looked just as crazy at 40 before doing some real

I generally disagree with you on AOL. I was patient with them in the winter a

for the cable modem @HOME service.

I had no problem changing my email address and I value my time.
@HOME is so many times faster I can't possibly imagine how I could have wasted
so many hours on AOL. The cost difference in immaterial for anyone who needs an
extra phone line for AOL, to avoid tieing up the primary home line for long
periods.

I think AOL is at the current price because of momentum players, short
squeezes, stupid investors, AND because it does have a franchise. (You
can have a franchise without offering the best product or service in town.)

On AOL, watch cash not earnings. You don't see it yet, and I wouldn't expect to

Remember the flack about AOL capitalizing marketing costs to boost earnings? I
had no problem with that. Its the same reason Merck always confounds value
investors by always trading at "ridiculous" earnings and book multiples -
capitalize R&D and it has always looked like a bargain. Once again, I wouldn't

Trying to justify valuation for Merck by saying how much lower its P/E would be
if you capitalized R&D is, in my opinion, just as questionable as capitalizing
the huge ad expenditures for a consumer products franchise like Coke to justify
its P/E. Both are essential expenditures to the respective companies survival.
The former creates hidden value on the balance sheet in terms of research in
progress or value of patents and the latter brand value.

Furthermore, if these expenditures were constant (which they are probably not)
restating their historical records to capitalize them would increase assets but
have no effect on current earnings - because the depreciation charges related
to all past years' capitalized expenses would just equal this year's current
expense.

and recognizing the markets tendency to evaluate puts at different volatility
level than calls. Using these formulas and an assumption of 6.2% standard
deviation for puts and 7% for calls both for a one week interval I compared
current market prices and verified the formula against actual prices for March,
April and July AOL options. Using the mean value of CBOE closing prices on Feb

Sell 100 share AOL +1145 Sell 1 March 105 put + 291 Buy 1 July 115 call (1518)
Proceeds +10198
If you hold the position until March 20 the following values would accrue(I
know that adjustments can be made during the interval but my experience is that
whipsawing is just as likely as a successful rollover):
Stock closes at 95 105 115 125 135
Close short (10500) (10500)(11500) (12500) (13500)
Sell call 500 859 1383 1983 2537
Feb 13 proceeds 10198 10198 10198 10198 10198
Net less 80(com) 118 477 1 (399) (845)
Seems like a good strategy only if you are confident that stock is heading
down. I agree that AOL is way overpriced but dont like to argue with momemtum
players.

Solid argument on capitalizing R&D. Same reason you don't add back depreciation
without subtracting capital expenditures. You convinced me.

In special situations, however, it may be appropriate. Merck is not one of
them, but I still think AOL may be. Since it is new, you might not have the
historical amortization offsetting today's investment spending depending on
what kind of assumptions you made about. But your argument is not to be taken
lightly.

Hi Allen; Well my first post was just an offhand comment,
generally I suggest individuals to stay away from options.
I may post a position from time to time, but at this time I
have no option positions, and I'm not really looking for
any. I may look into writing some puts this week on PCU,
but only because I would not mind increasing my position
in her.
---------------
Getting into exotic options takes a lot of time.
You just about have to specialize in them, and you need to
be able to get very cheap commissions on your trades.
Options are mostly tools for institutional investors, the little
guy who just wants to trade options may think he is going to
get rich but all of them get burned bad sooner or later.
---------------
I'm into market timing now and have too little time for options,
except if they are simple long or short bets. When I did
gamble with them I got a discount on commissions but only if
I played at least 20 contracts at a time was it worth while.
I'm not going to get into analyzing any options on any stock
if I'm not ready to bet on that stocks move. Then I start with
tracking the short interest in the stock, or at least finding
out if it has any to amount to anything.
-----------------------------
BTW trying to catch the TOP is far more risky than catching
a falling knife. One that's falling can only go to zero I can
show you many that more than doubled while shorts tried
to catch them. AOL is just one such case. Buy stops are for
suckers. If reverse conversion numbers don't add up, don't
short the stock.

Insight on UMR requested

This turned up on a screen with a P/E of .4, P/Rev of .08, P/B .11,
Debt/Equity 0, Div yield 105%.

Partnership is called Unimar
last four dividends:
02/11/98 0.410
11/12/97 0.320
08/12/97 0.490
05/13/97 0.690
02/12/97 0.640

10-K for FY ended Dec 96 here:
http://www.edgar-online.com/bin/gethist.pl?choice=2-620356&nad=0

This is how much they payed out in the FYs ended Dec 96 and Dec 95
Participation Payment per unit $ 2.41 $ 1.76
======== ========

Further digging leads me to believe that shares in this company are
actually "IPUs" that expire in Sep 99. I think the financial
information that resulted in this showing up in the screen are
attributable to the partnership but not attributable to these IPUs.

However, with the current trading price at $1.81 and six dividends to
go...I think the upside is 18-33%...

I think there are some very misleading financials posted out there but
anybody else who'd care to look...

right, the equity traded as UMR is an "Indonesian Participating Unit" and does
expire worthless in September of 1999. With that in mind, I passed, because I

Agree with what you say. I use Brown and Co because their commission minimum is
21 dollars per position and 3 dollar comm for options less than 1 dollar and
sliding scale up to 7 dollars comm for options priced greater than 5.
Commissions are less for more than 10 contracts and I get rebate of 10 % for
over 350 dollars per month in commissions. As a conservative investor(ie hate
to lose money) I will rarely write more than 7 options and prefer to spread out
positions over both time and stock choice. Diversification is also important
and I sell way out of the money naked calls, naked puts on low priced or beaten
down stocks with willingness to hold stock(APM,ULTK,TLK,WDC,etc), ratio writes
of calls against stock in which I expect recovery, and arbitrage positions (ie
MCIC vs WCOM). Since I am retired I can watch all positions very carefully and
would not suggest this strategy to anyone without the time to monitor.

I'm buying and selling-- but what a lousy day today to be a buyer. Seems very
difficult to get good prices. I am stepping up anyway.

I've bot WES or Wescorp, a small California-based bank with a subsidiary that
does sub-prime financing (yes, I have not apparently learned my lesson with
this business!) as well as refi's. President has increased his ownership of the
company about at current price. Stock does seem reasonably priced relative to
others - (although as I've stated before, investing in "relative" bargains is
no bargain at all - really very dangerous.) However, there's a reasonable
increasing div., okay pe, and prospects (IMO) for growth over next fews years.
I'm diversifying my banking interests here - still own all regional bank stocks
I've mentioned before. It was a toss up for me to add to my small position in
NB or start here. Started initial position in WES last week before recent pop
in its stock. I expect stock to settle back down, but just lost patience to
wait. (Got sucked into excitement of rising market --that's an oops -g-)

Buying CCS which is the real estate operations of old Castle and Cook. Run by
Dole's Murdock. This is basically a real estate play in two areas - although
the Co is trying to diversify. Company is heavy into Hawaii land (not doing so
well in selling their houses there though - market is down) and Bakersfield
Calif (near to Tejon Ranch? -g-.) Stock is down in its trading range (very
limited history with the stock though), mutual fund buying. Market cap below
assets (I would like to believe).

Added to my position in ICOC (ref. my posts here 2098 and 2876)which I bot @
5.7/8. I like it still and better at today's buy price (for me) of 4.7/8. Lots
of cash (debt too). Below book value and okay business model. Nice dividend
supports stock price (-g- that's what I thought at 5.7/8. Wonder if I'll be
saying that too at 3.7/8 -g-)

Been selling off relatively large positions in TOY and SRM (Sensormatic). I've
got to update my records, but it does seem like with my stocks, they 90%
probably go UP after I sell them. Been waiting almost 3 years for SRM. Now that
I've given up, it's going up. I hate that -g-. And I'm tired of riding TOY up
and Down. My long time purchase of McFrugals was bought by Consolidated Stores
which stock I'm still holding -- they own KB Toys. That's too many toys for me.
So I've been reducing TOY holdings. Looks like I may be pitching out the wrong
stock.

FWIW, I've added today to my position in Flextronics (FLEXF). It's a big
holding by Ron Baron (his fund). Not really a value play IMO, but a speculative
buy. Anybody who follows Electronic Contract Mfging thread can follow extremely
well done (IMO) detailed analyses of this and other such stocks. (Paul
Klemencic, who posts occasionally here, is the moderater and Guru (in my view).
This stock and others like it are really almost paradigm shifts (sorry -g-) in
the way some businesses will manufacture products. It's no longer necessary or
perhaps even desirable (this can be debated) for companies to sustain their own
manufacturing facilities.

I am reviewing my position in Exide (Ex) which I still hold. I wrote it up here
about March of '97 when I bought at about 17. Now it's about 23. Starting now
to see a number of mutual funds come in and take positions (but I can't figure
why they're buying now). This might indicate a signal for individual investors
to buy again (???). Lead pricing and plant consolidations in Europe hurt
business last year. The lead pricing issues may be resolved (I'm not sure -
don't follow spot/contract prices.) President's reputation also is somewhat
tarnished in past dealings with analysts apparently. (That's Exide's president,
not referring to OUR Pres. -g-) Also el nino has meant warm weather---not so
good for battery sales. Any opinion anybody has on the battery biz or Exide, or
especially, any analyses anybody has done or seen regarding buying stocks after
value funds come into it -- I'd be interested in reading here or on Exide
thread.

re: icoc: 21m sh. out and 85m cash. $4 cash/sh on a $5 dollar stock. Lot of

fiscal 1997 EBITDA was $1.18 sh. Looking backward (I've got an excellent rear
view mirror -g-) that's about 4x given current price. Very low and MAYBE they
can do it again in '98. Div over 4%. You get paid to wait. Sales up 8x since
'92. They say: "We have consistently remained the leader in all the market
segments in which we operate. We are the leader in inspection, reclamation and
corrosion control of oil country tubular goods and sucker rods in the US, and
the leading provider of petrochemical size reduction, concentrates and
compounding services in the US and Europe." If they will work on profitability
(SAG doubled in '97), they will be profitable and stock should perform. They
are revenue growers now -- that's okay too. At some point psr will turn and
price will rise and reflect potential from sales growth (I say -g-). Some
evidence of insider buying at these prices. All in all, not a bad li'l value
stock at current price, IMO.

<Trying to justify valuation for Merck by saying how much lower its P/E would
be if you capitalized R&D is, in my opinion, just as questionable as
capitalizing the huge ad expenditures for a consumer products franchise like
Coke to justify its P/E.>

IMO, the problem is using capitalized earnings as the measure of value, and not
the use of capitalized R&D and/or marketing. R&D and marketing are actually
investments, whose efficiency can only be measured realistically if they are
capitalized and amortized over a reasonable period of time. You then apply the
amortized amount to the return on these investments to ascertain the actual
value of the investments. To adhere to capitalized earnings in lieu of
discounted cash is to submit your valuation to all of the inherent noises and
inaccuracies that are known in GAAP accounting and accrual accounting.

Reference the reconciliation to net income (to "un-GAAP" the earnings) and the
discounting of future cash flows that I performed on MSFT and INTC.

The distributions vary according to the price of natural gas and oil, and

Considering the lack of good value plays, and the high prices, how do you

In my view, a good short is a company with both poor short term and long term

Most interesting post and situation IMO. I see from your profile you are a
mature adult with a technical education and 2 years experience in the investing
column. With not such good luck with your short positions, and not finding
value plays. Excellent! By my standard advice you should be doing other things
also. I would advise you to try margin - as much as you can stand - as well as
maintain a very concentrated portfolio. Also at this point you should be buying
and selling calls and puts. The idea - my idea anyway - is the sooner you go
bust, the quicker you will learn.
You should by now also be getting that queasy feeling: you already know that
all stock indexes are at record highs (IMO), and in some areas, it's been near
impossible to lose money in some investments (like banks and pharmaceuticals)
or certainly with a package of some others (REITs perhaps, or tech stocks
bought about 2 months ago). So with most of us "investors" seeing record gains
in this the best of times and you realizing you're not part of this picture
(based on what I think you are saying and info. you've supplied) you should
indeed be asking yourself two questions: The first you got: How can I make
money by improving my short tactics? You are almost ready for the second
question. Can I make money shorting stocks? This will come from testing the
common assumption that if stocks are cheap, you buy 'em and if stocks are too
high (or have no value behind them) you just do the opposite - sell 'em short.
You are about to realize that most people - and you may be one of them - will
not make money shorting stocks. It's like comparing walking and walking
backwards. Seems like backwards walking should be the mirror and simple reverse
of forward walking. It ain't. And shorting successfully is way different too.
But also unnecessary for investment success.
It seems to me I am finding what I consider a value stock about maybe once per
week or so on average. I buy it and I post my comments here (some exceptions if
I'm still building a position in it, or maybe it doesn't quite fit the value
mode - maybe a spinoff like NCR for example, or dividend play like NationsBank,
or I'm out of town, etc.) Generally I don't get much response - maybe no
response - which I've learned over the past year - I would like to believe this
anyway - is a function of each person's somewhat unique definition of value or
their particular interests. Sometimes though- I hope not too often - it's
because
people flat out believe I am totally incorrect about a stock and there's no way
they could ever see the stock as a value stock, so they pass by without
comment. (And sometimes they are very right -g-). And sometime people post and
try to be nice about telling me I am wrong (and again, they are sometimes
right). But all through the past year I have had to read through posts where
people bemoan the lack of opportunities for value stocks. So of course I am
going to say BALDERDASH. The blithe comment "given the lack good value plays"
just smacks too much of the conventional wisdom. I think you've been hanging
out too long (or too short -g-) with the players on Mike Burke's thread. You
will begin to make money when you begin to know what kind of an investor you
are - and that's not about learning tricks of the trade. If you are for value
then you are a value investor. If you are for short term or quick turns then
you are a PLAYer. You will be one or both. And not at the same time. This means
there are NO VALUE PLAYS.
Sorry if I am harsh with you. It really relates to me though because I feel as
if I'm in the very small minority (who believe they are finding value in a
variety of stocks), and I am fighting the consensus. And they may be right ---
and I could be very, very wrong. If so, I am going to face some financial
consequence which will be very painful. On the other hand, I continue to find
beaten down large cap stocks, small cap stocks selling below net assets per
share, stocks reasonably valued in book value, sales per share, dividend, cash
flow, etc. - and I am buying them. Every week or so.

Although I appreciate your sarcasm and the evidence of your utter disdain for
anyone who would dare doubt the value of this market. my question still
remains. If you were to look for valid short candidates, what would you look
for ? The opposite of value plays (your analogy to walking and walking
backwards) does not work. Nor should it

My letter said there were a lack of value plays, not that there were not any.
If you run screens of net current assets, (classical Graham) screen you find
maybe 10 hits - if you further filter by looking at insider holdings, how they
received them etc. the list falls even further.

Additionally, although this may be anathema to those on this thread, I think
that a portfolio should be balanced. In my case, I am long 90% and short 5-10%.

A good short doesn't necessarily have to be a high-flyer. As I have found (from
being long these stocks at the time) is a stock with collapsing fundamentals,
down from 20 to 10. Then short it to 5. Not my instinct, but its not a bad way
to go as long as the fundamentals are going from bad to worse.

Take Reebok for example. Its industry is in bad shape in the short term at
least. Though the stock has hardly been a highflyer, there is no reason why it
should be. It has lost 50% of its U.S. market share in the last five years, and
that trend is accelerating. Visit their outlet stores - they are almost
literally giving product away. A lot of potential customers think their shoes
fall apart. And they are at a serious competitive disadvantage to Nike and
Adidas. On top of that, they have the worst balance sheet in the industry. The
stock has run up with Nike this week on rumors that Buffett is buying Nike. It
makes no sense to me why Reebok would go up too. That's what a short looks
like.

I agree that to short a stock, you should first wait for it to fall. For full
disclosure, I must say that I never have shorted a stock, yet I have always
been interested in it. I have 'paper shorted' stocks before like AOL, and
realized I would have lost my shirt. But, again, those stocks often had all the
short characteristics I want to see, except they still had price momentum.

I think the key is to find a point at which the momentum players have been
burned to the point they will not get back in for a while. So a 10 percent fall
probably isn't a good entry point, but a 25 percent one may be.

I'm very interested to hear about other people's successful short trades and
the timing they used to trade them.

PS - What does -g- mean? I can't figure it out.

Paul Senior should call Michael Price. Price seems to be having trouble finding
good value. From reading Senior's posts, I sense that he is really a market
timer, who finds oodles of stuff. With a rising market his stuff will stick to
the wall; with a falling market, oops.

Shorting against this momentum crowd is difficult and dangerous. I haven't
found many 'investment grade' shorts. On the other hand as a hedge against a
long portfolio, it costs nothing, and prudent. Given my cash position that I
can't seem to find anything to use it on, I'm considering erecting some boxed
positions and bombing away when the punch bowl gets pulled.

Do not understand what you are saying.

If you say that you understand doing reverse of value investing does not work
I'm still confused. Why would you come on a Graham-type value thread --or any
value thread- and ask about rules for shorting? No value investors I am
familiar with - who have published their works - have written about how to
short. They all avoid subject or say don't do it. I recall only one value fund
manager who says, nah - he just does essentially what Jim Clarke says (previous
post). (Not sure, maybe Sanborn?? of Oakmark fund???) So far, as I read
comments back to you, you are getting what you asked for - good ideas and
suggestions. (From me you get something different -g-.) I don't see where the
posters flat out state that this is a method that they themselves actually use
or recommend that someone employ.
My sarcasm stands as my advice. It's advice that works (after the point where
someone goes broke -g-). My paradigm is that I believe if I want to make money,
I have to do the things that successful people who have gone before me have
said works. That means - you are correct - no shorts as small component of an
overall portfolio -. Not to say I won't take a flyer (short position) every now
and then, but no conscious hedging long and short.
Let me try a different way. Having a 10-15% portfolio that is short IS to me
entirely logical and reasonable. It should offset some risks as the market
rises or offset some losing positions, and it give some comfort in these
turbulent times. It should work out okay.
But it doesn't (at least for me and about 90% of other people (I've read
somewhere) who've tried this. Of course, who cares what I say or do? But when
proven value players avoid these types of machinations, then there IS something
to be gleaned. I don't know why it doesn't work but it does not. Maybe because
they are two different mindsets. Maybe because it's too diverting from the
process of finding, buying, and sticking with good stocks, or maybe because
it's too risky in a reactive sense. 10-15% now, but if situations change it
becomes just too easy (for some anyway)to go 10-30 percent - like if the market
rises to even further highs or if stocks start dropping (jump on 'em as
shorts). Since this conclusion - folly for most people of shorting,using puts
as a pursued technique in portfolio management - is counterintuitive, it must
be experienced before being understood and absorbed. Therefore IMO, most people
HAVE to try it and lose money before they understand this. Then they can cease
and move on.
My disdain is somewhat less than utter about finding value stocks. Everyone on
this thread I'd guess has, or is finding, value stocks. I'm saying there is NO
lack of them. Unlike everyone else apparently, I am finding MANY, maybe too
many. You should have read that I am quite worried that I am in the minority,
and that I might be very wrong in what I am doing . But I have a method or
methods of sorts, and I am trying to follow it (them). At this point it's not
about buying net-nets. Graham's rules (per Intelligent Investor, 1974) also
allow several other methods. These opportunities still seem to be available.
IMO.

Price and Garcia buy and sell every day. Because you and Price say they can't
find stuff, well I'm a small investor and I can. Characterizing me as a market
timer, I do not understand this. I can be a follower of Tony Gray (A Thousand
Miles from Wall Street) who says he buys stocks like he buy his suits - when
they are on sale. But, he says, you've got to be ready - got to know what you
need, got to shop, and have got to know when there's a sale (they don't put red
tags on them). So for example, I've followed CCRO for a year and jumped on it
when it hit a new low and below its book value or business value (IMO). Others
recently posted like that (below what I think is value point) include UHAL,
ICOR, GNT, CYM, WDC,LSI, VO, WES, CCS. And many more.
At some point, price drops below value (value by conventional measures) and I
buy. In this sense MAYBE someone could say it's market timing. Mr. Market wants
out. I will step in ala Tony Gray. Other stocks I posted here are straight
value plays at the prices I've found them. ICOC, HYDEA straight net-nets.
Relative div. plays - I guess I am the only one interested in this - posted
here last year or late '96 - EGG, JPM, MEL, JCP. PSR plays of NCR (bot between
25 and 35), OLS. All I still own. Selling down now outsize positions in TOY and
SRM that I've had since '95-'96 that don't seem to be growing like I thought.
Slowly peeling off pharmaceuticals owned for several years.
Does this all sound like market timing to you? I call it trying to buy low and
sell fair or high. Most people call it value investing.

Rising market my stuff sticks to wall? Some of the stocks go up, some of the
stocks say where they are, and some go down. Just what anybody would expect in
a diversified portfolio. And when the market drops, my stocks will too. No news
there. It's what will happen after the drop that is important.

You say you can't find value. Just what is it that you are looking for on this
thread? Other than to bully people. I am finding stuff large cap and small.
Things under book value with insider buying. Stocks at low price to cash flow.
Stocks with good business models and increasing dividends. Stocks selling at
net-net. Technology stocks, consumer staple, foreign exposure, local only,
stocks with no sales growth but good roe, stocks with increasing sales every
year for 7 years, some with 25 years even. Stocks selling for low pe's compared
to their historical range. All stocks with good attributes - psrs, p/bv, roe,
roa, etc. etc. If you don't see from my view - don't see any of this - what
about some of the other posters here? Jim Clarke's SJP - straightforward
analyses - working out per plan - a BIG favorite of Price. Did you pass also
DSWLF by Mike Burry? Not pick up on any ideas from Paul Klemencic? Nothing from
Richard Baron? (I notice for example - STILL - I am the only buyer in the USA
for the month of Feb. for one of Richard Baron's choices - microcap with 4%
div. yield, pe under 5, selling 1/3 of book.) Or converts from Scott? Or Ron's?
Or anything from some of the other posters who offer concrete, well-developed
potential buying ideas?

Real easy to sniff and dismiss methods when you're in a casino crowd standing
behind people who are at the dice table. For those of us who are trying to make
money, we're bellying up to the table, putting our money down, and taking our
best shots. I just need to learn now to ignore the kibitizing of those who
haven't a clue or are too scared to play.

Very interesting posts- I pretty much agree.

I think it is possible to find shorts and make money shorting, but it takes a
whole different mind set and even more hard work and energy. Since most
investors, including some of the best SI investors, don't put enough time and
effort into researching and understanding longs, i doubt many could do the job
on shorts. Another way to say it, we have a lot of role models for value
investing, growth investing, etc. ...people who have consistently beat the
market over a long period of time. They demonstrate the efficient market theory
is not applicable to all investment strategies and/or investors (otherwise, we
should all be buying index funds).

It is much harder to find and emulate people who have beaten the market by
using short positions. One of the most famous shorts of the nineties was
McDonnell Douglas- look what happened there. The shorts got eaten badly. Having
said that;
1. If there was someone very experienced,
2. Who had taken the time and effort to research various short selling
strategies,
3. And examined historical evidence on the success of those strategies,
4. And who had the time and made the effort to research potential short
candidates,
5. And who had access to the information on the company and industry sector to
properly evaluate the extent that the stock was overvalued,

then, this person might be able to find and identify some shorts that could
generate 20-30% annual rates of return. Of course to really do well, the short
seller needs to have access to the funds generated by the short sale, or at
least receive the interest earned on those funds (instead of their broker--
remember brokers love short sellers). Also the short seller has to be
constantly aware of short term news or events, ownership changes, short
positions, etc that could trigger a "short squeeze".

In short (pun intended), the individual short seller has the odds stacked
against him, whereas the institutional and hedge fund managers have these
factors giving them a decided edge. The playing field is not level.

Our best advantages as small investors, is our ability to get in and out of
stocks without influencing the price much, and the fact that we answer only to
ourselves (and our spouses). These advantages can be used effectively to gain
advantage over the fund managers for the dedicated small investor. Short
sellers are at a disadvantage to the professional short sellers and hedge
managers.

If one was going to short sell, I recommend taking a sector, and thoroughly
investigating all the stocks you can in that sector. You may find some where
the valuation is particularly out of line. As you know, I did this with the ECM
sector last year, and found two possible shorts, Centennial Technologies and
Sigmatron. For your amusement, I'll post several relevant links:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=796172
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=799043

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=931734
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=959418

I never did short these stocks though. Short selling takes a lot of time and
effort. On the two stocks I just mentioned I spent over 400 hours researching,
and still wasn't willing to short.

BTW- Have you read Barron's very unfavorable article on Exide this week? Its in
the Follow-Up section.

Shorts are logical ways to use cash, IMO.
If most of the portfolio is long, it is just
a hedging mechanism. I've had success
with it in the past, so maybe I am overconfident.
I strictly do not margin greater than the
account value, but I am not
against covered writes or selling puts. I've
played options, futures, you name it. I'm
young, but I've tried a lot, and value investing
is the way to go no doubt. But it doesn't
preclude sensible shorts or options strategies.

The idea is not to write off whole investment
areas and to keep one's mind open to
possibilities. I've tried to do that, and it's
put me in a pretty good position investments-
wise over the last few years.

Re: how to short, I use technical analysis
combined with weak fundamentals going
forward. I shouldn't admit it, but hey,
I use it. I used this on Netscape at 55,
but covered too quick. I feel certain technical
analysis does lend insight into psychology, which
is what drives successful shorts IMO. I am of
course wary of getting caught on the wrong
end of an overhyped stock, but I use quick
stop losses, which got me out of Autodesk
for instance before it moved up. It's
a tricky game, but no more so than arbitrage.
I think the same principle applies in the
shorts game - calmer heads prevail. This
opinion may change as I get more experience
with them.

I'm still looking, and I've got lots of overvalued
candidates, but no great technical shorts
yet. If both criteria aren't there, I won't
do it.

Maybe I should reveal my resolutions for
investing in 1998 and beyond:
1) Write up rules and stick to them - you
all saw that in the Out of Sight Value article,
although my version is 2500 words, not
1300. I review them with every stock.
Insider trading (esp at these market heights)
seems a logical marker for me, and I am
using it more, as you can see with my
recent opinions on BMC, Tricon and Nike.

2)Don't over-concentrate or over-diversify.
All the studies I've seen say that you can be
properly diversified without diluting stock
picking ability with 8-12 stocks across
different industries. Now I consider initial
full initial positions to be 12% or less.
My 6 stock and less portfolios were too wild
and got me too emotionally involved in stock
movements.

3)Before selling, figure out all the costs
of switching stocks, do the math, and
think about taxes. This year, I am using my
financial calculator in every situation I come
across, even buy-sell decisions. It's another way
to remove emotion. The net result is that
my turnover is way, way down.

5) Continue to keep an open mind and
try new things.

Discipline, low turnover, and the proper
concentration were what I needed, and it's
working so far. Now that I see the market
is ignoring Asia again, I'm keeping
my mind open for ways to profit. Hence
the short idea.

Good Investing,
Mike

Paul K: EX and questionable/incompetent managers. Thanks for pointing out
article. Possibly the reason the stock has been declining (inside knowledge of
Barron's forthcoming report).
Regarding management problem: this does seem to occur with many "value" stocks
which I buy. For example also UHAL, RACC (now bankrupt), VVTV, APM (perhaps),
VO (perhaps), and NTAIF (We both know about this one!). I'd guess most
investors bail - this causes the price to drop. And sometimes never to recover.
I'm trying to buy where I think problem is well known and will be overcome
within a couple of years. Where the business will continue to move forward in
spite of current problems. Where the alleged poor management can say, yeah that
was long ago. We're better now. (-g-) (note to Honest Abe: I use -g- to mean
grin or I'm smiling or there's supposed to be a little joke or humor here.) And
I'm trying to diversify so that the inevitable RACC type doesn't devastate the
portfolio. My feeling is (have no facts) it's the crooked managements we don't
know about in the stocks we own that will really hurt. And as implied by the
Exide article - the hurt could come from middle management too. This level is
much harder to identify by funds/individuals who visit mostly the top
management team. (Although in the case of EX - the top guy himself has a
terrible rep with the investment community IMO - from what I've read. It's a
pity if this is true and filtering down.) Company really has an opportunity to
consolidate and do well. I like how they've taken a commodity item and expanded
the service they provide: maintain customer stocks, remove old batteries,
refresh pos advertising, etc. They are the dominant player in the auto battery
business. Now if they could just get a decent return on their equity -g-.

IMHO unless you are hedging the short, in the long run you have the natural

I looked at this company and have the following concerns: Management- do they
know what they are doing? Are they shareholder friendly? Sales growth seems to
have come from buying up 17 business in the past couple of years. I read that
these businesses were purchased for shares but the votes tied into the shares
were stripped as long as they were held by the current owners. This effectively
gave control to management, which seems to be the Pacholder family. Also they
adopted some sort of shareholder rights plan. Can you confirm any of this? How
easy will it be do manage these disparate businesses?

on a general note does anyone have any opinions on NCR or Eastman Kodak? NCR
looks like a cheap but poorly managed company. It has a pSR of .5 and $10 a
share in cash and no debt. But i keep wondering why can't this company make
some money and what is its plan to do so? It has a franchise in ATM machines
and good connections with a lot of banks and presumably some expertise in year
2000 issues. Also some 20,000 employees (room for cost cutting) Any views?

Kodak is a global consumer franchise, which also seems to have problems making
serious money.

The last idea is Spyglass. it may seem farfetched to consider as a value play
but for an internet stock it looks almost reasonably priced relative to
revenues. It is focusing on developing browsers for use with non-pc-s, using
cheaper code. It also has some cash on hand and no debt. If nothing else it
looks like a cheap investment for a telecom stock like lucent or motorola. I
say all this as someone who is a non-tech and would would appreciate any
insight on the company and its prospects.

Your first two, I have some comments on.

I think NCR sort of fits into that category of tech company like DEC, DGN,
Apple, and Wang, (or NOVL on the software side) which were early leaders but
lost their way in an industry where rapid change is the norm and inability to
keep up can be fatal. I have bought value plays in the past in tech without
much success, when they were companies with weak mgmt and behind the curve, as
opposed to a stock that got sold off for an extraneous reason. IBM is one of
the few that came back from the dead.

I have owned Kodak and think that is a different situation, long term.
Short term it seems to be competition with Fuji and an old-line company without
a sense of urgency, despite newer mgmt. Long term, the
reason I am concerned is the stability of its franchise, which is film sales.
VCR cameras took a bite out of growth. Digital cameras may kill it over the
long term. For example, I see no reason whatever why five (or some number of)
years from now we will not have inexpensive digital cameras using disks capable
of hundreds of pictures. One disk maybe costs $10 and covers you for a year -
equivalent to maybe twenty times as much film and developing cost now.

with emphasis on the ideas of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett.

[I believe SI has a "New Threads" announcement linked to their home

to catch the weekend warriors. --RR]

But, maybe it's not a good idea, so if someone on this thread thinks porc
shouldn't do it, please say so now, before it's too late.

[(Hopefully Final) Draft of Proposed Introductory "Box" for Silicon
Investor Thread -- Feedback, Objections, etc., Desired (yea *or* nay,
si vous plez)]

[Title:] Graham and Doddsville -- Value Investing In The 21st Century

Superinvestor Warren Buffett named "Graham and Doddsville" (the
mythical hometown of Value Investing) after Benjamin Graham and
David Dodd, who co-authored the monumental work on Value
Investing,
"Security Analysis".

Simply stated, Value Investing is "bargain hunting" for stocks. If,
as a consumer, you have found bargain hunting to be a good way to
"maximize your returns" on shopping for consumer goods, then, as an
investor, Graham and Doddsville may be the place for you.

The welcoming committee of Graham and Doddsville (alphabetically):

Wayne ("Dark Side") Crimi is a computer analyst, investment and
economic researcher, and long term shareholder in Warren Buffett's
holding company, Berkshire Hathaway. Wayne's currently Bearish
views
(subject to change as valuations warrant) are elaborated on his Web
site (which has links to all of Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports):
http://members.aol.com/WCrimi/workshop.html

Axel P. ("Axel") Gunderson is the nom de plume of an engineer and
research scientist who ferrets out "socially conscious" Value
Investments.

Barbara ("Meerkat") Laffan uses on-the-job hi-tech experience and
intuition to identify likely winners for her "Darts Hit The Charts"
model portfolio.

Bernard F. ("Berney") O'Rourke is a CPA and financial planner. Berney
uses both fundamental and technical analysis. The extent of Berney's
research into what has worked in Value Investing makes most other
researchers seem lazy by comparison.

Reynolds ("porcupine") Russell is a registered investment advisor who
is neither a Bull nor a Bear, but rather a "cautiously optimistic
porcupine". His Dow Value Portfolio (and other model value
portfolios) may be found at:
http://web.idirect.com/~telcomm/value_04.htm

We hope that Silicon Investors who have an interest in applying the
principles of Graham and Dodd (and Buffett) to today's Market will
join us. We learn more from questions than we do from answers, so
let's see what we can figure out together.

It appears a nice dividend AND a tax credit are involved
in Torch Energy ( TRU ).

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/980220/tx_torch_e_1.html

I think there are some credits in the tax code, i.e.
not income deductions, but a real tax credit appears
involved here. But I am no expert on it...
I think just the dividend alone seems very appealing.

It may not be a consistent dividend, but certainly
nothing to shake a stick at.

Hope someone better qualified to answer, will respond.

Well, I'd guess there's always room for one more value investing thread. Some
of the stocks in the portfolios look interesting - worth looking at a little
closer. Thanks for info. On the other hand...
Kind of a shame in some way though that you invoke Graham. Personally I think
you guys are doing probably as much harm as good - especially for people new to
Graham. For example: Graham gives the definition of value upon which his whole
work is based. It's not "simply" just "a bargain" as you say. It's a much more
salient issue than what you accord. Like the crux of his philosophy. It's
pretty sad when you screw up the man's definition of value and yet you presume
to use his methods. And come on a value investing - Graham based thread and
mess it up. Pretty egregious -g-.
You've got a guy who does fundamental AND technical? That's not value
investing. A guy who follows Buffett? Buffett is not a value investor by Graham
rules. A female who uses intuition?? Model portfolios? Where is your own money?
Anybody can run screens - and anybody does -g-. This thread on value has been
around for more than a year. Where have any of you posted anything on it? I see
from scanning your posts which go mostly to Pairgain, you are essentially
diversified in one stock? Where's your Grahamian diversification?
Really not going to like seeing this sluff and stretch and ruination of Graham.
By non disciples IMO. However, if I can find one or two stocks to buy, it'll
probably be worth going through the agony of reading the thread's "hosts'"
interpretations of the Master and how their latest stock picks fit into a
Graham, Dodd, Buffett framework.. Eeech.
On the other hand -g-, I'm sure others here will encourage you in a much more
friendly and positive and open-minded way. And I will look forward to reading
their stock comments and stock suggestions when your thread begins.

Just not willing to overlook these things on this thread which has always set
high standards (IMO). If I'm out of line... chalk up my behavior to El Nino.
The rain storms here are affecting my otherwise pleasant and easy-going
personality.

<< "Porc Does Value" >> There's much to be said for such a title <g>, but it
wouldn't do justice to the fact that GADR is a collaborative effort.

Personally, I think that Mike Curry and the rest of the "Value Investing"
thread are doing a great job. But, there is a whole "crowd" of us in the midst
of an ongoing debate over how best to value the overall market, and we don't
want to "hijack" an ongoing site.

From a draft of "Graham and Doddsville Revisited" [the Book]:

But, Graham is not saying [in "The Intelligent Investor"}, in
our reading of his work, that per share book value is the one and only measure
of intrinsic value in any and all markets and economic
conditions. As Graham states in the Introduction, "The
underlying principles of sound investment [i.e.,
rationally quantify value; buy or sell accordingly] should
not alter from decade to decade, but the application of
these principles must be adapted to significant changes in
the financial mechanisms and climate."

Supporting this interpretation are Graham's words in the
Introduction's opening paragraph, "Comparatively little
will be said here about the technique of analyzing
securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment
principles and investors' attitudes." If Graham thought
that book value is the single timeless measure of
valuation, it is unlikely that he would begin his most
widely read book on investing by writing that
"Comparatively little will be said about [any one
valuation technique]".
