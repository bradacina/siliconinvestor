If the rally holds, I will probably stay put. I am still not convinced to buy

I own hundreds.

If trading is defined as buying and selling, then no, I don't do a lot of
trading. I do a lot of buying, not much selling.

I often look to buy beat up stocks. Often I find such stocks are in a sector
that's beaten up. I have usually found it difficult to pick the "best" stock
opportunity in a sector, so rather than buy just one from the sector, I will
purchase a package of what look to be downtrodden stocks. As a result for
example, I have positions in several oil refiners, several integrated oil
companies, several business development companies, several commercial property
reits, etc. etc. Over several years, that's become like having my own personal
mutual fund.

I listened to some of the abk conference call today. It sounded like they were
definitely going to try stay in business in one form or another. I didnt
understand a lot of the conference call but there were some pretty good
questions and i was impressed with some of the candor in which the questions
were responded to.
When asked why the CEO responded abruptedly the gist of it was that the CEO
felt strongly that they should raise more capital via Capital Notes rather than
dilluting equity . When the board took the opposite side he felt that he had no
choice but to resign. But apparently he continues to be in daily contact with
management. Given what has taken place in the equity markets I seriously doubt
that the government will let any of the bond insurers default. Just like I dont
see them letting CFC go out of business, leaving the federal loan board to
collect $50Billion of mortgages. if I knew for sure that BAC cant renegotiate
the price downard i would be a buyer of cfc at these levels.

From:Carey Thompson
American Express is getting pummeled in the market. Here is an article that
looks at the long term record of AXP and states now is a good time to buy. I
agree. I have owned AXP since Jimmy 3 sticks (James Robinson III) was CEO, and
added more shares recently.

I have owned and followed American Express (AXP) for many years. In that time,
I think the only time I purchased it this century was just after 9-11-01. It is
rarely cheap, because it is a great business and a great franchise and everyone
knows it. You need some serious fear to get this company on the cheap. 9-11
provided one such opportunity, when it plunged for a very short time to $24.20
per share.

I thought Thursday morning was a great opportunity when AXP dropped on Capital
One's announcement. Remember that COF has a banking arm and is directly exposed
to the mortgage mess. It also has a much less affluent client base than AXP,
lower average FICO scores, and its balances revolve, whereas most of AXP's
balances require monthly payment. In other words, AXP has a "spend-centric"
model where they earn the majority of their revenue from the so-called discount
fees earned each time a customer buys something with their card. Loan interest
is a secondary revenue stream.

So I bought some AXP for some managed portfolios, and watched the stock climb
the rest of the day. Then the 4pm press release hit that indicated AXP expected
a weaker 2008 due to reduced consumer spending and more write offs. Great
timing on my part, but in a few years or less it won't matter much in my
opinion. I bought some more Friday morning as the market knocked another 10%
off the stock, even though AXP still sees double digit topline growth in '08.

Let's compare AXP's current valuation to that immediately after 9-11. A major
concern then was that AXP was leveraged to the travel industry, but it is far
less so today. AXP had earned about $2 the year before, and earned about $2 the
year after. So it bottomed at a little over 12-13x earnings. Today, at $44, and
assuming '07 earnings of about $3.40 and '08 earnings of $3.50 or a bit more
(earnings comparisons in '08 are affected by some one-time items in '07, so
growth looks lower than it is), it valuation right back at post 9-11, sub-13x
levels.

AXP is a fantastic worldwide franchise that would be impossible to replicate.
It will benefit from increasing global affluence. It has growth prospects and
returns on equity far better than the market. I think this one should be bought
and put away for the long term. As usual, it could go lower in the near term,
but for longer term investors, it is a rare opportunity indeed.

One final point: You don't have to take my word for it. Just look at who holds
AXP in their portfolios - it is a veritable rogue's gallery of the best
investors on the planet: Buffett, Greenblat, Davis, Eveillard, Olstein, Ruane
Cuniff, Dodge & Cox, Gayner. Joel Greenblat, arguably one the finest value
investors ever whose hedge fund has averaged 40% annually for more than 20
years (achieved not with smoke and mirrors, but with good old fashioned stock
picking), and author of the must-read "The Little Book That Beats the Market",
had 16%(!) of his multi-billion dollar portfolio invested in AXP as of his
September filing. So - who to side with here - a bunch of scared sheep (the
market) or the best investors of all time?

Tough choice...

I like AXP as well. Have had some trouble today getting fills, and have missed
some stocks that were attractive at lows. If AXP falls to lows again -- and I'm
alert enough (and still have money enough) -- I will add to my position.

Maybe 2008 isn't going to be good for AXP. Company isn't going out of business
though, and its franchise seems strong and intact to me. I expect stock price
to move up eventually. Forward p/e of 12 would be very low for this company if
it should happen.

I received Marty's last quarter investment letter yesterday. He stands by his

adjustments of contracts that companies plan to hold until termination. He does
make some sense: if you don't plan to sell the contract/CDO/CDS/whatever, it is
not very important that NOW it is worth 50% less than yesterday. You were not
going to sell it anyway and you don't plan to sell it now. The important part
is really what happens at the end of life: how much did it cost and how much
money you got out of it. Anyway, I cannot repeat it better than Marty himself,

Hi Jurgis - I continue to like COP long term especially with this announcement
earlier this week regarding their 1/2 interest (a $2.6B investment) in TRP's
Keystone pipeline project. The Keystone pipeline project is a new oil pipeline
capable of shipping 590,000 barrels of Canadian crude daily to U.S. refiners.

http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idCAN2254130520080122?rpc=44

From the article:"...The line is one of several new conduits planned to handle
the burgeoning output from the oil sands, where new projects are expected to
nearly triple production to about 3 million barrels a day by 2015...."

Therefore COP is investing now so they can take advantage of the huge pipeline
and distribution demand that should triple in the next 7 years.

I continue to add to both TRP and COP.

the only problem is that frequently companies that have gone under and are
operating under bankruptcy protection may have a competitive edge over those
that havent. I guess this is particularly true of union situations. so may not
apply in the cabinetry case. However not having debt can lead to poorer

WLP, UNH, CAH - those recession proof stocks have not fared well very lately.
WLP especially has been hit by rising medical cost. Still it seems to me that
those stocks are valued fairly reasonable - at about 12x forward earnings. Also
I am willing to guess that those earnings are much much safer than those of
banks that are trading at around 10x earnings if one were to believe the

So I am thinking about adding to WLP if it comes to it's lows as I think that
those stocks should do OK in a tough economic climate (be it a recession or

Its actually inconceivable to me that the banks and the government would risk
the possible downgrade to hundreds of billions of credits when it could be

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner Sean Dilweg believes
Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABK) to be "strong and well-capitalized," and
believes that the troubled municipal bond insurer will be able to attract
capital.
"Ambec, when you look at their financials, they're strong, they're well
capitalized, they have a strong municipal bond market," said Dilweg in an
interview with CNBC.
"I'm comfortable that there will be capital attracted to the plan they put
together," Dilweg said.
The Wisconsin insurance commissioner is working to attract capital to the
company after complex securities guaranteed by the bond insurer plummeted in
value amid the credit market turmoil.
He would not comment on where capital might come from, but stated that Ambac
"is a strong financial company; it has some challenges ahead of it, but as an
insurance regulator we come at it from protecting the policy-holders," said
Dilweg.
Stocks of bond insurers were down Thursday, a day after Ambac, which was cut to
double-A by Fitch Ratings and is on watch by the other two ratings agencies,
saw its shares soar 72%. Thursday afternoon, the shares are down by 17%.
Bond insurers such as Ambac and MBIA Inc. (MBI) guarantee about $2.4 trillion
in outstanding debt, and the loss of their top-notch ratings means a repricing
of insured debt and a chilling effect on the industry.

Cut my position in ABB Ltd. (ABB) by one half. Took my 10% gain from my initial
purchase in July 2007. Stock is expensive with a trailing PE of 23 especially
if there is a slowdown in global infrastructure projects. The dividend is very
small (less than 1%) and is not worth holding based on this small payout. The
company is below it's 50 day and 200 day MA, so the downside risk is probably
low.

I bought this as a play against a falling U.S. dollar so I will deploy these
funds into some other foreign stock that pays a higher dividend.

I continue to hold my starter position and would consider adding to these
shares at prices below $20 and if the global growth outlook looks as though it
is improving.

I don't blame you. The massive selling we saw in January really threw me as
well. ABB has never been a cheap stock on a PE basis, and I don't expect it
ever will be. But when the market psychology changes from hate to love, ABB is
the King of the power transformer market, more so than even Siemens and the
fundamentals of the worlds need for power generating capacity has not changed.
The key to buying ABB seems to be buy it as cheap as possible during periods
where it gets repriced lower by the market. Pick your spot. Like many stocks,
nothing has changed with ABB's fundamentals and they just get stronger.

OT: It was another day of very wide and erratic swings in many of the

at 238 yesterday for a ride up to 317, where it resides in AH. That's an 80

I can't figure the value of these satellite companies. I've got DTV
somewhere--- either through NWS (which I've added to recently -- it's a buy
under $20, imo.) or through one of Mr. Malone's companies, i.e. LCAPA. I am
guessing fair value for LCAPA is about $150. (Stock now about $106). While
waiting, there's the occasional Malone buyback (Dutch auction). I'm out of LNTA
now. Have high hopes for LBTYA though, which I still hold.

I'll go with you on ORI. Have placed an order to up my position now.

I'm one who compares/contrasts WTM with MKL. Every time I do, I'm a just more
comfortable with adding to MKL on drops, than instituting a new buy of WTM
whenever I look at these two.

HUBB. Funny it should get mentioned now after all these years. I've been
selling it for a while last year and now, and have finally exited stub position
a couple days ago.

I have GE on my watch list to add more, and am watching UBS with a view to
starting a small position. I'd like to buy UBS closer to lows though.

Aside: In my personal experience, I find I'm very happy with VZ's FIOS service
for internet connection. My DirectTV is okay just. I don't like DTV's dvr -
poor in comparison to TIVO; I don't like the way DTV censor some adult stuff;
and I really don't like that they turn up the sound level loudly when
commercials come on. I also don't like the way they seem to blast me suddenly
with violent commercials when I don't expect such (like sudden adds for
wrestling shows showing guys pummeling each other, or adverts for movies that
suddenly show people shooting/hitting each other or in ugly/hurtful slapstick
comedy). (end of rant -g-) Anyway, my intent is at some point to drop DTV and
go bundled with VZ's service.

Suma, everyone has it's own perspective based on what he see's. As for me, i do
not see an recession yet. I work in the components business which is volatile
and vulnerable to slowdown. We still see a healthy business activity and the
low US$ helps a lot to win business in Europe that we never even pursued
before. this slowdown does not feel like 2000/2001.

I also talked to neighbors who do architectural work (contracting). I was
expecting an Armageddon perspective but all they only told me that the news
they are hearing is far worse than the actual business reality that they are
seeing.

Also i have not seen contractors all that hungry for work that they offer
substantial discounts. maybe prices are not that ridiculous any more than they
were 2-3 years ago but that's about it.

sats is a new company and is being valued below book. It's just getting off the

experience than Cable, the largest competitor. fios and uverve will take years
to impact sat tv in a significant way. dtv/dish are currently valued at about 6
times this year's ebitda, which is way too cheap. Both have capacity to buy
large amounts of stock. Gabelli talked about them this past week in Barron's. I

ABB has never been a cheap stock on a PE basis, and I don't expect it ever will
be 

Depends on how far you look back. i have watched ABB before it was ABB (the
swiss BBC and ASEA together created ABB) inthe 80's. before and after ABB has
been cheap (PE<10) quite a few times if i remember correctly. During other
times, the "E" part was missing since after all ABB is in a very cyclical
business. Then the stock was cheap based on P/S ratio. in my investment carrier
I expect ABB to become cheap again, probably more than once, if history as any

Well a few session and the favorites of yesterday are the sells now. CAH, SNY,

go down as well but not for the same reasons than my other stocks <g>.

CAH is a buy at current prices but i bought already some at the same price. I
might add if the stock falls more on no adverse news.

Between UNH and WLP, WLP is the closest to a buy, IMO.

SNY is almost a buy. i never figured why it got up at 48$ in a miserable
environment but i think it is a buy below 48$ (I bought it for 38$ in the last
go around in August 2006).

I sold GEHL and BCS. in return for BCS I bought some DBSDY (the Singapore

growth ahead for Singapore banks:

I also bought some chang this week, a stock I owned and sold last year. I
wasn't crazy with the third quarter figures and the recent 8-K means there is
more dilution on the horizon.

http://biz.yahoo.com/e/071231/chng.ob8-k.html

But the SNEN CC transcript added some color to the CNG business in China. Below
is an excerpt

"The CNG vehicle market continues to experience strong demand and support from
both the public and the Chinese Government. Last month, the National
Development Reform Commission, or NDRC, instituted certain policies to
encourage the use of CNG powered vehicles, such as mandating wholesale natural
gas pricing for the CNG vehicle industry and granting vehicles using CNG
priority access to natural gas supplies.

In addition, the NDRC requested the provincial municipalities increase the
local CNG retail price so that it falls between 60% and 75% of the local price
for 90 grade octane gasoline. This policy was designed to improve the
profitability of CNG filling station operators and therefore encourage greater
investment in the sector. As a result of the new policies, Hubei Province
municipal government raised prices from $0.40 to $0.45 per cubic meter. Wuhan
City implemented this policy on November 19th and Sinoenergy's two stations are
now selling CNG to vehicles at higher retail prices.

To a CNG filling station selling 10,000 cubic meters of CNG per day, this could
increase net income by approximately $73,000 per year. We view the development
of our wholesale and retail CNG distribution business as an important
contributor to future ongoing revenue and profits. With the opening of natural
gas pipelines to cities in Eastern and Central China, and with strong
government support for CNG vehicle business in place, we expect rapid growth in
the use of CNG vehicles and associated infrastructure."

I like CHNG's business model better than SNEN. The company's guidance for 08 is
as follows:

"The Company continues to expect net income to increase 70% to $9.3 million in
2007 from $5.5 million in 2006. For the year 2008, the Company continues to
anticipate revenue and net income growth of at least 70%."

Assuming they grow "at least 70 percent" and there is added dilution to the 27
million outstanding shares, you still could have a stock selling at a ten to
eleven PE.

About MHP. The stock price is historically cheap. When it's been this low
before I have bought.

I am not sure this time though. Here are some considerations:

A cyclical part of the business is their textbook publishing. I'm not sure but
it seems to me the cycle is starting up again (schools buying newest editions),
and so this is a positive for the company.

Mr McGraw apparently likes his Business Week. There is some question in some
peoples' minds as to the relevance and viability of such a weekly mag. in a
world of internet. In any case, MHP is Mr. McGraw's fiefdom.

The key franchise is Standard and Poors and all that it delivers.
My idea is that there's a possibly strong competitor waiting. And that is Mr.
Murdoch when he turns his attention to his Dow Jones. That is, imo, the DJ
industrial average is staid now. There could be though a DJ 500, a DJ money
management or money rating firm (ala what S&P has), and so on.

Anyway, A good quarter reported yesterday, it seems to me:

Bond insurers - like in the "Big Lebowski" words, the bond insurers are the
"carpet that holds the room together". Problem is that it's a small carpet now
combined market cap of MBI and ABK is 3B$ and the sums that I am hearing are
needed are >100B$.
http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUKN2563522120080125?rpc=44
Raising that amount of capital is not feasible for any private institution, so
it would have to be some sort of a government backstop. I am not sure that this
would leave ABK and MBI operating as they are but it sure would beat bankrupty.

Then there is another assumption that a few B$ might be enough to have them
keep the AAA rating and banks would provide that capital because it be cheaper
for them to keep the bond insurers afloat then let them be down graded, which
leads to market- market losses at those banks with the myriads and hundred B$
of papers that has been insured (and Armageddon scenario I described earlier).
this idea sounds like the Munchausen story to me where he managed to pull
himself and his horse out of the swamp by pulling on his own hair.

What is really going to happen is hard to tell. What I do know is that I don't
want to be part of this. I don't own US bank stocks (except for overcapitalized
thrift conversions maybe), much less so the bond insurers. Sure there is money
to be made but there is also the very real potential for total wipeouts.

I try to stay out of the crossfire for now. Better to buy a 1$ note for 80c,
when I am 90% sure about the value than the same note for 50c when I am only
50% sure to be correct.

i think that hundred or two hundred billion dollar number is phony. Initially I
thought that it would be a no brainer for the banks and/or sovereign countries
to pony up some equity/ capital notes so that everyone stays in business and
keeps their AAA ratings. It is ironic in a way that the banks and
municipalities are actually in way worst shape than the bond insurers in the
sense that if the bond insurers rating decline they go into runoff but they are
selling at such a small fraction of their net worth that existing shareholders
will do pretty well. On the other hand banks will have to write down more of
assets and municipalities will face increased borrowing costs. However I dont
see some astute guy from either the investment side or the regulator side
acting swiftly and silently to get this accomplished. Instead we have some GS
analyst talking out of both sides of his mouth, and a ratings guy who is
clearly in cahoots with the shorts trying to upset the apple cart. On top of
that the House wants to have public hearings-- what a bunch of morons. Because
of this, the one thing im sure of is that there will continue to be lots of

the rest is BRKa buying directly.

With no SEC reports from BRKA about the October-December period we can only
speculate about Buffett's investments. All that we know is that he did not buy
any company outright. We don't know how much money he invested from his cash

More macro stuff i have been tinkering about. My favorite country right now is
Taiwan, via EWT. Reasons:
1) low PE (around 12.5)
2) the latest election win of the opposition party may lead to less
confrontational course with China. Although Taiwan companies do a have
substantial china business links they are in the Shadow of HK and Singapore. I
bet this could change.
3) No resource exposure with Taiwan. I do not like resources going into a
economic slowdown. I think that Taiwan high tech bias will get the country
through a slowdown better

Besides EWT, i do own TSM the king of Chip fabs. this stock is also

Many possible value stocks discussed in Barron's this week.

Excerpt from cover story by Andrew Bary:

"...We couldn't resist rooting around to find 10 excellent stocks that look to
be oversold. Some, such as Chubb (CB), ConocoPhilips (COP) and Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold (FCX), have especially low price/earnings ratios. Others,
including Boeing (BA), General Electric (GE) and Cummins (CMI), are attractive
because they stand to benefit from economic growth outside the U.S. CBS and
Disney (DIS) are alluring plays in the depressed media sector. Marlboro-maker
and tobacco giant Altria (MO) is likely to do well even in a recession, and its
looming breakup makes it a restructuring play. Motorola (MOT) is controversial,
given its faltering financial results, but it trades at a low multiple of sales
and well below its estimated breakup value."

Hi Jurgis - I was happy to see that MICHAEL H. WINER portfolio manager of THIRD
AVENUE REAL ESTATE VALUE FUND increased his position in RAIT Financial Trust
Common Stock (RAS) by 1,000,000 shares. This is my speculative REIT pick in my
portfolio. I recently doubled my position in this stock on the recent sell off.
(http://www.thirdavenuefunds.com/taf/documents/shareholderletters/aboutus-lette
s-07Q4.pdf)

If Winer likes it, perhaps he sees the same potential value I see. I plan to
hedge my position by selling some covered calls because if the dividend is cut,
the stock could fall another 25%. The Trust is selling substantially lower than
book value (at least according to the company's latest quarterly report). It
may take several years for the market to price this value back into the stock
but the value investor "bottom fisher" expects this.

It seems like Marty and his management team are trolling the bottom for many of
these deep discount value plays but they may be a bit early in the cycle on
some of the companies (like the home builders). Also, you also have to look out
for those land mines when you do this type of fishing because some of these
positions can go BK.

It will be interesting to see what their holdings and sales are in their funds
after some time has passed for the market to digest the recent sell off.

My biggest concern looking out to 2010-2011 are the new tax increases on

>From the article:"...2009-2011: Tax Cuts Expiring

The 2001 and 2003 Bush income tax cuts lowered rates throughout the income
range and reduced capital gains taxes. But if the provisions are not made
permanent, those reduced rates will expire soon.

* In 2009, the tax bracket for the lowest income earners will rise from 10
percent to 15 percent.

* The highest earners will face an increase from 35 percent to more than 39
percent.

* In 2011, the capital gains tax rate will increase from 15 percent to 20
percent for most taxpayers, and from 5 percent to 10 percent for taxpayers in
the 10 percent and 15 percent federal tax brackets.

* The tax rate for dividends will rise from 15 percent for most taxpayers to
normal income tax rates, which can exceed 39 percent...."
