to ALL: Comments invited on CHRB as a value investment.

Chinese co., mainly involved in natural rubber.

Dec 95 was at $60/sh. Now down to 3.25-3.5.

Decline because of fall in rubber prices among others. Currently have positive
earnings. PE 3.1, price/sales 0.09. Zero debt.

Book value around 4.5 of which $1.70 is cash.

Obviously, one would have to factor in political & economic uncertainties
(currency fluctuations) in evaluating this.

Technically, there is some support at 3.25.

One more point on Agco. I think today was very significant. The company
released earnings and missed estimates by two pennies. The market was down over
2% today. Ordinarily you would expect a company that misses earnings on a day
like that to plunge. But Agco was actually up for most of the day and closed
unchanged.

That is the classic sign of a bottom. When bad news does not affect a stock,
even on a day like today. 30 and change is a great level to get into Agco. I
think the stock is worth 40-45, and there appears to be very little downside at
this level.

James: re Ag. Well here's what I like: very interesting webpage. They say
they're way ahead of their competitors in providing satellite layouts for crop
yield improvements. So they seem to be trying to add a real sophistication and
service to their primary (IMO) tractor business. This is very good IMO.
I always wondered what happened to 'ole Maaaaaasy Ferguson and now I know (it's
part of AG!) I once read up a lot on the history of this company from the '40's
'50's and '60's as a business school exercise. MF was as a lousy co (with a
loyal following though) in a punk business then.

However, I'll have to defer to you about AG now - the numbers look attractive
and you seem to be on a roll.
I will argue still about competitors. There're more than 4. Just you wait 'til
Komatsu and Honda get rolling. IMO, if it's got an engine, Honda will make it -
ATV, motorcycles, gas generators, ... and if the business is that good...
tractors. And I still say there's downside risk in the stock. Given that
earnings are up, so there's some support, still, the stock has traded 30 or
below for much of '96 and 97. We haven't necessarily seen the end of the drop
in this latest selloff. And if we have, sometimes IMO, there's a delayed
reaction in stocks that haven't been hit. As for me, I can't see what will push
this stock to 45. BUT... as I will reiterate... it's not about what I see or
don't see, it's what you see. And you seem to be seeing pretty good these days.
James, I will think about AG some more and weigh against other opportunities I
think I do see. Paul.

Has anyone noticed that Sears hit a 52 week low today - trading at about 43
down from 65 in early August. Seems like a pretty severe haircut for a quality

the stock slide (as well as general market anxiety).

bounce in this rubber company stock (I just could not resist --g--). Would have
to dig deeper and know more, as you say, than just buy on fundamentals.
Same with your previous FI. Looks good on surface too and could/should work out

Looking over the Microsoft Investor site Mike is writing for, I notice the

On Fina & CHRB: Appreciate your comments.

Fina is set to expand their chemical (polyethylene etc.) side of the business
and have a joint venture recently signed with BASF (big chemical co.) to
convert petroleum to simpler organics (in huge volume) to meet, to some degree,
their "internal demands" for raw materials in the chemicals operation.

In any case, what attracted me to the stock was the reasonable PE and good
dividend associated with a stock that has been growing steadily for the last 5
years. The management must be fairly good. For yearly financials comparison,
one may resort to

http://www.zacks.com/docs/ShowHist.html

On CHRB, there is room for a bounce (-G-) since the current earnings are
positive; and I suppose for trading in the US, they must go through a
reasonable audit (mainland chinese co., not Hong Kong or Taiwan).

Still believe the two big risks are competition from finance arm of big auto

accepting loans. My pick in this beaten-up industry is still RACC (purchased at

Paul,

Might want to sublease part of that truck bed. Took my biggest hit ever
yesterday, lost a big chunk of my October gains (JWC). Almost everything red,
DSWLF the big loser because they're based in HK. It's a case of people owning
it and not knowing what they own. They are not on the HangSeng and a decline in
$HK would help them as they keep cash in $US. (like bailing out of ELAMF
because the Peso falls) Crazy market. I'll get it back when they report
earnings in two weeks.

HMY - I looked at it once before and passed purely because the furniture
business seems so volatile. Any downturn in the economy and the first area to
show weakness is household goods. With consumer debt so high and them being
discount furniture, it just didn't seem attractive long term in spite of
current value.

SThomas,

I look at CHRB earlier and didn't find it attractive because the demand for
natural rubber products is weak and they have an infrastructure problem. If
transportation system in China and demand for natural rubber improves, they
might go somewhere.

Also - the price drop is mainly due to added dilution, almost 5X from the high
stock prices and they've underperformed ever since the stock issue. I rated it
high risk in spite of the numbers.

For what it's worth,

In keeping with the recent agriculture theme, can anyone offer
an opinion on American Rice Co. (RICE). They process and
sell rice and olives. I think they are #2 in the US in both products
and do substantial exporting. As for value, the stock sells at around
a PSR of .01 and .1 of book. They've reported recent losses that
seem largely due to interest payments from purchase of olive
business from Campbells. One factor that's hard for me to gage
is the relationship with the parent company ERLY. I don't know

How about that -g-. APM is a company in a very competitive business, and a
company in transition to a new technology which serves their very few
customers. "competitive", "transition", "new", "few" = scary, very scary.
I say all this is built into the price, and we will see better times (52.3/8)

I like Banctec (BTC): low pe, rising sales, improving ROE (17%)

May be that the company is misperceived on Wall Street (more likely I'm the
patsy in the poker game -g-). Funny though how its pe seems to hang in the 13
range, year after year (except that in '95 they lost money). Rev's have more
than doubled in past five years; earnings are at a record; co. has just
announced authorized sh. buyback of about 10% --- all good stuff IMO. Price
seems a tad high though based on my valuation model (19 would be good)- but at
current price and pe, and perhaps continued revenue growth, it's still worth a
buy IMO. Bot a small amt at 24.1/4 today.

Also today, I added to my NCR position. Sold IGT which I proposed here in June
as a Buffett type stock (Yeah, I know... if it were a Buffett stock, there'd be
no good reason to sell, but given that I have a number of stocks in my
portfolio(s), I have some difficulty in knowing as much as I'd like about each,
so sometimes, I've got to sell when it looks like a stock has reached fair
value. Also selling some GBOT (low p/book)because I don't understand or believe
the business model; and eliminating TSG = The Sabre Group = my play on growth
of airline business -- they have announced earnings and 1998 outlook below
expectations (the Street's and mine). I still own KLM. Also selling small amts
of fairly-valued (??) BMY (Bristol Myers) (which I actually thought was fairly
valued at half its current price) to trim the position in my account(s) and
free up some cash. And when I get cash, I can be dangerous! Yes!

Mike: re: APM. I'm looking for 1996 pe of 13 on 2000 yr earnings of $4.00 (big
guess). (That could/should/might/might not get APM to $52.) Based on recent
announcement of lower earnings for FY '98 and the unsettled nature of the stock
now - and especially given the product transistion it's trying to get through -
there's not much margin of safety at the current price. Some positives are that
a lot of the bad news is already out, and the company is a viable competitor in
a business for which I think there will be increasing demand (disk storage).
I'd not buy this stock at the current price -- I can see the price easily
dropping to new lows from here (especially in a few months if more bad news is
forthcoming). And, on the other hand, I can't see the price so readily moving
up from its current levels. There are apparently a ton of shorts on APM - and
with good reason it (now) seems :-(

Mike and thread, saw a good article at < http://www.thestreet.com > written by
Ted Murphy, who writes a regular column there called Quant View.

It seems that last year, Murphy devised a stock screen which he called his
Buffet Screen, using (Murphy claims) the factors which applied when Buffet
bought KO in 1988. Interestingly, one of the 16 stocks which survived the
screen was Dairy Queen Intl., which Berkshire Hathaway recently purchased.

Murphy says that these stocks are not pure value plays, but (he says) neither
was KO when Buffet bought it. Anyway, he just re-ran his Buffet Screen on
10/23, and spit out a new 16.

I don't think Quant View is one of the free sections on TSC, but they do offer
free 2-week trials. I have subscribed (the only $$$ I have ever spent on the

Knape and Vogt Manufacturing (KNAP)

This company is interesting. Sales have been flat for years,
but it has been increasing margins, generating cash to pay
down debt. It now has less than 25M in LT debt to go, sells
for about $120M, and is generating a run rate of about $25-30M/yr
in cash after capital investment AND after paying it's
dividend but before paying down debt. There is a 3.2% dividend
(49% payout) while you wait. Relative to the industry and the it's own
past, the stock is at the average and at its highs in valuation,
but the company is improving, starting with a new COO in
1995 -- the first non-family member to run the company.

This is like the Sybron pick -- a very well-run company on the
upswing - not the cheapest, but for good reason, and it is not
by any means expensive. As it pays off the rest of its debt in
the next year, you get all that cash flow for a low price, with
room for dividend expansion. A long-term hold, but with good
prospects.

Micron Electronics (MUEI) at 14. Added to
my position. PC makers and components got
hit 10-15% today, even the undervalued
ones. This one is one of the undervalued
ones that got more undervalued today. The
best quality, the best customer service,
a great balance sheet, and solid multiples,
now at a PSR under 0.75 despite growing
sales and profits.

Little Switzerland (LSVI) at 6 1/4. LSVI
has an offer from a suitor which would give
each shareholder rights to put to the company
their shares at 6.15 up to a year after the takeover.
Not approved yet, but I'll vote for it at the

sheet suffering from non-recurring employee theft, but
still looks good.

Looking at Telebras (TBR) in the 80's,
Quantum (QNTM) at 28, Western Digital (WDC) at 26,
Seagate (SEG) at 22. Heck, even Dell and Intel --
just kidding :) Never thought I'd see these
prices, but with the end-of-day halt in the midst
of a freefall, it's virtually guaranteed.
Also looking at Huaneng Power (HNP), Shandong Huaneng
Power (SH) -- both almost there.

Not Chris Craft fell today just because it's on

selling for less than the 77% of BHC it owns.

Don't be in such a hurry. In 1987 it was a good 6 weeks after the blue chip
bottom before most secondary stocks hit bottom. Furthermore, anyone who sold
anything this year for a gain and put it back into the market probably has a

Mike,

China stocks -
I had decided to hold only one stock per region and chose DSWLF. $19.00,
PE=9.5, growth 35-40%. I just added to my position as it has taken a beating
for the wrong reasons. They are Hong Kong based but trade on NASDAQ, factories
in China, keep substantial cash funds in $US and convert currency as needed to
meet payroll and other expenses. No debt. Growth has been 35-40%. In May they
completed expansion to meet order backlog. They report earnings on 11-5 and
should beat projections by a large margin.

All equipment is new and state of art (like an $8.5M computerized circuit board
stamping machine capable of 300K boards a day). In plastics extrusion, metal
stamping, circuit boards, growing as earnings permit, paying 40% of earnings to
dividends, maintaining a 'no long term debt' policy, keeping a high margin
(18.5% net).

DSWLF for common or DSWWF for share warrants. (Two warrants plus $9.00 for one
share of common.)

Weaker currencies in the region lowers their costs and improves the bottom
line. It's worth a look,

While I do not know enough to disagree or agree with your assessment of dswlf.
The area you did not mention was that we invest with $us in a company based in
hong kong. If they cut their currency loose, than the devaluation of the
currency can take the value of this investment down. i.e. you are buying a
foreign company with $us and when you sell the investment must be converted
back to $us. In the meantime if the exchange rate vaires significantly than so
do your returns. Is this right or am I missing something

All,

NPK? Not much of a business, but trading at $38, 1.18 times book which is
almost $30 in cash. The "business" is profitable though somnambulant. Major
shareholder-chairman is nearly, if not, eighty years old. Any opinions?

Cary Chubin: re NPK. Hey, the 'ole Ben Graham fav. Wondered what happened to
it. Plenty of opportunities to make money in this stock since my copy of the
Intelligent Investor recommended the co. And I missed every one :-(

Here's what I see based on what you report: There's not much of a business now
but it's got $30 bucks a share in cash. For this the stock is at $38. There's
an old guy running the co. so maybe he'll be gone soon. Then something will
happen to the business or the $30 bucks or both.
What the???? I fit that profile! I'm kinda old (not that old), I got a part
time business that ain't going anywhere and I got $3000. Anybody want to buy me
out for $3800?

Paul, (& Chris)

I've been hit pretty hard because I've about 60% of holdings in foreign
companies like DSWLF, ELAMF, NH, FLSHF. Am off around 15% after yesterday. I
took some profits yesterday (far less than I could have earlier), selling all
of my US stocks to raise cash and am now waiting to see what happens. Foreign
stocks going way under value.

I wouldn't recommend buying of DSWLF or NTAIF this morning after what happened
last night with Hang Seng. Will be down pressure because investors don't know
about the operations of the companies. They are good buys at current prices,
but likely will be even lower.

Chris - DSWLF is a $US asset based company. The only conversion is when they
convert $US to $RMD for payroll and expenses. They own machinery valued in $US.
They own very little in the way of property and lease nearly all of their
facilities in China. Assets are very liquid - in $US, liabilities are current
and in RMD. Sales are $US. Currency devaluations will lower their costs.

This is a solid company to watch for that right buy opportunity.

For what it's worth,
Ron

Ron: Oh, these companies are going south all right. IMO investors (and
speculators) know very well what these companies do and what currencies the
companies deal with. And if investors/speculators don't it's irrelevant.
In an abrupt downdraft like last few days, many stockholders MUST sell to
prevent margin calls or total disaster to their "investments", many of which
are trading vehicles. I recall reading that in '87, only about 15% of
shareholders (individuals) sold. If true, funds or these 15% were enough to
drop us 25%. (Ron,I am sure you know quite well about the

Paul,

I disagree when you say that investors and speculators know what they are
buying and the effects of currency and other variations. As an example I offer
ELAMF and the frustration you've had with those that think a devaluation of the
Peso would lower their earnings. You see this on DSWLF and NTAIF also, but you
don't see it on a company like NH, CWP, and others that deal in their own
currency.

I see people investing in companies that don't know what the company does, who
they supply, their competition, or even the financial condition of the company.
This is very obvious in some of the tech stocks that are bought purely on hype.

I agree on your margin comments and I think you can add option traders to the
list. I know virtually nothing about options trading, but I imagine those that
bought before last Wed. are feeling a lot of pain.

I guess my question will bely my ignorance but here goes anyway. I sold out my
dswlf at 23 with a small loss because I thought that a decoupling of the
currency to the dollar would devalue my investment. Lest you think I was wise,
I put that money into morgan stanley asian pacific fund which promptly
proceeded south about 13%.

My question is why is dswlf any different than a foreign closed end cef. If the
currency devalues I know the earnings will go up as their products become more
competitive. But my question is why wouldnt the value of our investment go down
as it does in the cef's such as asian pacific fund.

I didn't want to admit what I'd done, but it now looks like it will work out. I
had sold off everything that was near value - OAS, SWS, JWC, NH, and some FLSHF
I had to raise cash. When I looked at the bid/ask this morning it was pretty
obvious Deswell would be hit hard at the open. I began buying warrants up to
5.50 ending up with almost all of the free cash in the warrants in addition to
yesterday's buys at 6.00 and my earlier buys at 7.50. 55% now in Deswell.

Talk about a nervous morning. It just hit 6.50 and I'm up 16% on total, being
drug down by ELAMF off 1/4. Likely tommorrow I'll be down a gob, but it's a
chance I decided to take.

From:Ron Bower

Chris,

Paul S. could answer you far better, but I'll try.

I don't know about the Asia Pacific fund, but I imagine they have invested in
Asian stocks that hold assets in local currency. DSWLF bases their value on
$US. If Deswell held large amounts of property in Hong Kong like NTAIF, the
value would be reduced, but their assets are primarily cash and machinery
valued at the $US dollars paid. They hold $US, they sell in $US, and expense in
RMD or $HK, converting as needed. Their receivables are $US, payables $RMD or
$HK.

ELAMF is another one. They hold and sell in $US and convert to Pesos as needed
to meet expenses. If the value of the peso falls, they have a better conversion
rate resulting in higher profits. It lowers their expenses and current
payables. They also lease most of their facilities in pesos instead of owning.

Each of these companies is helped by a strong dollar conversion. They are
almost US companies using lower costs of China and Mexico. I like them because
they are both diversified in their customer mix. DSWLF is growing faster. NTAIF
is rasing cash and may be thinking about acquiring DSWLF. EALMF supposed to
report earnings tonight.

The way I interpret it anyway. Paul can correct my mistakes.

I thought I would mention to everyone that I just
bought a lot of NUKO for the long term at 1 1/4,
(http://www.nuko.com) a major patent holder of
MPEG2 technology. The recent market crash has
put this stock at a very attractive price. NUKO
is probably one of the best values on the market
nowadays. From their web page, "NUKO is a leading
provider of products and solutions for Digital Video
Networking." The thing I found about this company
that was particularly enamoring was their collection
of partners. They are partnered with ADC, Cisco,
Northern Telecom, and PacBell. Their technology
both looks great, and from an SI newsthread is
"expensive, but has the best quality in the industry."
1998 will be the year of MPEG-2 and NUKO, in my
opinion is a leading vendor of MPEG-2 technology.
I wouldn't bet the farm on them, as it is a high-risk issue
and they have some financial problems, but this might
be one of those few great plays. See their web page

Re: broker problems

I am as upset as you re: my broker, Schwab. I pay all those commssions, and for
what!!!! I couldn't log on via phone, client/
server software, or web! I was looking to pick up Telebras at
85 and Quantum at 28. I couldn't believe it when the stocks actually
hit those prices (in real time). Then I couldn't get to my broker.
By the time I did --- Quantum at 34, Telebras at 100. I know this
sounds like short term trading, but honestly I felt that 28 and
85 were sound values for these stocks, and even if the market kept
falling I would think so -- I posted as much on my
web site this weekend. I also was looking at Tejon Ranch in the
25's, but same prob.

My blood pressure still gets high just writing about it. Moving
to the sub-$20 commissions -- at least if I can't get through, it'll
be expected.

Now I'm really starting to steam -- I just saw the closing
prices (I had been asleep most of the day).

Quantum at 34, Telebras at 115, Tejon Ranch near 30 - even
a value investor would feel crappy after not getting 10-30%
one day gains due to communications snafus. I'm so ticked at Schwab...

What's more disappointing -- Chris Craft, Little Switzerland,
Jan Bell etc. all continue to be down despite the massive gains today.

My portfolio was only down about 2.5% yesterday, but that was
mostly due to my cash position of about 45%, no so much my stock
picking. Still at 34%. Just wish I could've spent more today. Now I've got GTC
limit orders all over the market -- WHX at 12, TRC at 26, Telebras at 85, CREAF
at 22, Quantum at 28. I'm still sticking by my original prices, and I'm not
going to chase them -- just counting on the fact the market will double bottom
at some point in the future, hopefully when I'm not looking.

Re: SYC, JBM, KNAP

Sybron Chemical arbitrage opportunity. The market crash brought
the stock down to $30, and it has a buyout offer FROM MANAGEMENT
for $32-33/share. It had been trading as high as $33 1/4 prior
to the market fall. Even if the stock doesn't get bought out, it
is a good deal at 30.

Also, Jan Bell Marketing as previously discussed here is now
at a @2.50 bid/$2 3/4 ask. That's a good price for a net net

Still like Knape and Vogt myself (KNAP). Would appreciate comment.

margin to build infrastructure. At $150/trade, there's no excuse.

have to investigate the products some more. I get the feeling the products are
in highly competitive areas and that only through great effort are they able to

Maybe your way of protecting yourself with limit orders will work, esp. as you

through to a couple of my accounts. Although I knew this day was coming and
will come again (one day they'll even close the market again-- I went through

record qtrs of revenue growth:

Mar 4,103,000 versus 1,778,000

DEC TBD versus 2,147,000

BIPL will be one of 20 fast growing small caps to present at the Red Chip
Review Investor Conference on the 20th of November. . .see press release today.

The merger with the BGS group will more than double revenue and earnings are
just starting to benefit from the elimination of certain transitional operating
costs at BIPL's BCA Division and gross margins have improved due to sales
growth which will continue to reduct unit costs into the future.

I have a report on BIPL , send me an e-mail and I will send it to you or anyone

Actually thats on a trailing p/e. If you look at MINI's last three quarters
earnings are at 0.30 and they state in the quarterly report that they will have
continued improvement in the 4th quarter meaning the company will earn at least
0.40 for this year which would give it a p/e of 15 which is substantial. Also,
net income is improving substantially as the company continues cost-cutting and
moves into more profitable areas. Revenues were only up 5% but that is because
they are expanding into more profitable businesses.

2nd qtr. 3 new products being launched offer the potential for some great qtrs
in the future. Insiders seem to like the outlook. They have the best available
information on this company.

BIPL and TSSW continue to show great relative strength through the market

Any other small cap value plays / turnarounds that held up well during the
correction?

Mike B. Well, I took your advice on SYC and day-traded it. Not much profit, but
it was fun...been a long time since I've tried that -g-. First can't-lose
situation I've been in where I actually didn't lose -g-. Thanks, Paul.

Paul, I missed out on SYC -- I got back late from my night shift
and didn't get the open. By then it was at 31. Oh well. Shoulda
used a limit buy, but I thought I'd be back in time - I seriously considered
putting all my money into it for a day since it was such a can't lose
proposition. But that would start a dangerous precedent.

Good Investing,

Mike, do you know of any stocks traded on the Hong Kong

economy will still grow 7% plus for the next 5 years. If the
declines continues. The values could become rediculous.

Paul, James, Jeff, Ron, thread:

What stocks are you watching as the market dips again?
I am basically watching a small basket of potential stocks,
waiting for prices: I added Creative Technology at 22 1/2
to TRC at 25, QNTM at 28, and WHX at 11 1/4.
I broke down and entered my buy for TBR at 92 last night. Don't
know if I got it yet. The thread might appreciate
a peek into the situations you all are watching?

Hi Mike. Yes, watching many, buying a few.

Today, bot. small amt of GUCCI (GUC). Not recommending this one to anybody.
Asian spenders may disappear from their stores. If earnings should hold or get
back to $3.00 range, pe of 10 is too low IMO at current price. Thought same
when pe was 15 and price 45 :-(

Bot small initial position in LSI Logic (LSI). No good value reason that I can
explain. The stock cycles, it's relatively low now. $5 in cash. Stock should
move up over next 12 months. I have a lousy record for predicting these things
though -g-.

Buying scale down (is there any other way in this market? -g-) of Kemet (KMET).
Their business (capacitors)is booming (now, but wasn't earlier in the year);
and might continue to do okay because so many electronics use their product.
Their main competitor offered to buy them out at $25 earlier this year, but
they refused the offer. I am trying to believe this price ($25) offers an
intrinsic value for the stock priced today at 22+.

Adding to position in NCR. At $30 with $10 in cash. This stock could move up if
they can get some profits in their service bureau business (like EDS today) or
announce a buyback (like IBM 2 days ago). No matter if it does or does not
happen. Stock should work to higher levels over next 18 months IMO.

Added to position in Banctec (BTC). On-going rev. growth. Seems to trade around
pe of 13. I expect the stock to sell at this pe level again or higher in '98.

Also looking at Fluor (FLR) at 40. Doing some prelim. research on this one.
Anybody got any opinions here? And Heilig Myers at 12+. Also considering adding
to a small position in Mellon (MEL).
Anybody know who makes parachutes? I'm gonna need one.

Would you please make the fundamental investment case for TBR.
What is this I saw in Yahoo news about company splitting up into 13 pieces and
will ADR holders be adequately compensated issue.
It seems of interest but, technically, it traded a long time in the 70's which
in a lousy market it may go back to irrespective of earnings.

Has anyone looked at HEC? WORTH has it as a buy at $6.40, may open at 6 1/2
today! Fundamentals show a lot of cash due to a big loan. Still thier $50M loan
to buy land has already netted them $25M by giving up just 5% of 3 wells! Trend
has been getting better on earnings, now at breakeven with potential to score
big in the next year. Comment?

stocks come to my mind that meets your criteria are:

1. Eicon or EIC $3.40 on TSE (A wan access company with 40 mil cash, less than
1x of its $120 mil sales, 60% insider owership and just reported 6c Q, EPS
power is about 40c, est growth rate is about 25%);

2. Network Equipment or NWK or NYSE $16 (again, a WAN company with $140 mil
cash and about 1x sales; a weak competitor of Newbridge but quite profitable
with EPS at about $1.15 for 98);

3. Xicor or XICO $5 3/4 (a semi company, although insider ownship is less than
10%,; a weak competitor of Atmel and Microchip; good new product pipelines for
98).

Mike,

After buys of DSWWF and profit taking reduction of others, have decided to sit
tight. My plan for next 30 days is to build cash for a December sell down. I
see a small recovery, then better opportunities later. Will likely be wrong,
but...

Mike,

Couldn't resist. Bought 1K of ROC at the open. Selling at 8.625 and a BV of
14.75, has to come back. I now notice large scale buyers are bidding it in, so
I may have timed it right.

Taking another look at CHERA/CHERB. They and METHA/B have been oversold because
of their international subsidiaries.

Re: ROC

The book value of 14.75 is likely not a BV of 14.75 now. Through
yesterday, the 30% drop in the Hang Seng (as a proxy for the Taiwan Stock
Market) plus the 8% devaluation of the Taiwan dollar during the month of
October would give the book value at about 9.576 assuming that they performed
in line with the market.

So it is now selling around 90% of book, in my estimation. Some
downside protection. Now that I've got Telebras, I'm looking to
Asia for my next international investment. CEF's might be the
way to go for the value investor. I'm looking into them more.
BTW, Huaneng Power has already moved up above 21. Still looking
for 18.

Good Investing,
Mike

Mike, Paul, Ron,

Please comment on Oxford Health Plans (OXHP).
From Yahoo:
BV/share: $8.8
EPS: $1.58
Cash: $8.8
ROE: $22
ROA: $10.5

The stock lost about $43 in one day (over 62%) and has not recovered. The news
that brought it down was the revelation of their first-ever quarterly loss and
lowered earnings for 1998. According to a WSJ article they also admitted to
computer problems that caused them to overestimate revenue and membership
enrollment while underestimating costs. The CEO claims the problems have been
fixed and to report membership growth. As a result of this situation they have
laid themselves open to a slew of shareholder lawsuits.

I took a very small position at about $26. I would greatly appreciate any
insight to this stock or the HMO industry in general. It seems that Oxford was
the industry leader until this event and if this is a temporary thing then I
will add to my position.

Thanks,
John

Jeffrey,

This is from my web site:

. Currency worries have driven the Brazilian market and Telebras, its largest
stock, down severely in recent weeks. Yet the British government is committed
to defending the currency and maintaining ties to the US dollar. In any case,
the long term story remains intact, as privatization of Telebras is scheduled
to occur by mid-1998. Brazil has the largest GDP and the largest population in
Latin America, but only 1 phone for every 10 people, compared to 6.5 in the
U.S. The opportunities for growth are impressive, with 70% growth in phone
penetration over the next 3 years. And Telebras boasts 62% operating margins,
the highest of any telecom worldwide, but only a price-to-sales ratio of 2.5 at
a share price of $100. This compelling value in the face of such expected
growth makes Telebras a stellar bet for the long-term investor who can tolerate
extreme short-term fluctuation.

****
If it hits 70's, I've got limit orders down at 74 and would be happy
to take it.

Good Investing,
Mike

John Kolb: re OXHP. The morning the stock crashed, I thought I heard they
announced they would earn under $1 next year. I figured then the stock would
settle at 24-26. (It was trading before mkt opening at about 35-39.) I'm in
Olsten which is suffering also because of weak profits from gov't health
payments. I don't see why or how companies like OXHP which also rely on govt
monies will maintain their 20% roe margins. I just don't see why OXHP is a
value play at its current price --- of course, I don't see a lot of things, so
perhaps someone here closer to the company or industry would have a better or
more factual opinion.
I want to add also that I believe it is very dangerous for your success with
this investment to ask for an opinion here right after you have bought the
stock because you do risk getting opinions which may diffuse your focus just
when you need it to hold on to a position.
So don't be getting "post purchase dissonance" (aka buyer's remorse) based on
what I think -- I'm just a jerk with an opinion (even if I am right -g-).
