I2 -

I have to empathize with Paul's statements. I have sold stocks in the past in
which I felt the 'story' deteriorated. I have only sold one stock because it
had become 'overvalued'. That was Microsoft at 88 with a 90% profit. What a
huge mistake.

On the other hand, I have held TXN from 9/13/96 ($23.5 split adjusted) up to
$71.25 around 10/97 (+203%) down to around 42 in 12/97 (-41% from high, +79%
from purchase) and back to 58 today (+147%). So, sure I have had a 41% pullback
at one point, but even at that low I was up 79% in 15 months.

I would be interested to see how many people who had been in and out of TXN
made 147% in the last 17-18 months.

The two other things I like to take into account, in defense of buy and hold,
are the positive tax implications as well as buy and hold's track record -
Buffett is the most successful, documented investor ever, and he is buy and
hold. Why argue with that?

Can you point me to that O'S strategy thread? I'd like to check it
out as I've done a lot of reading, thinking, and screening re: his
strategies but haven't committed to it yet. He presents a lot of
data to back it up and as someone in the science/engineering field
that appeals to me. Overall, his concept is simple buy stocks with
both momentum and value - that way you make conservative investments
without having to wait forever for the market to smile on them. He
also doesn't market time but does do 100% turnover each year. Of
course, those that don't believe in 'relative value' won't care for
his approach. Neither will those who consider momentum a bad thing.

Paul,

I don't have the experience of most on the thread, but I don't understand why
any individual investor would 'buy and hold'. It seems to me that you might as
well put your money into a Fund.

If one buys an undervalued stock, according to the individual investor's
criteria, and that stock rises above the value, why keep it when there's a very
good chance that it will fall in price?

IMO - Just because a stock went to a price above the value you put on it
doesn't mean it should be held because it might go higher. I seems to me that
it's a good time to use sell.stop orders.

Also, why keep monies in a full value stock if there are better buys? I think
people become too attached to certain stocks and their perception of it becomes
skewed. I have seen some postings that refer to historical performance,
ignoring the probable future problems the company faces. (Kodak and Nike come
to mind). Just because a company has performed well doesn't mean that it will
continue to do so.

We both have bemoaned selling too quickly, but as you have pointed out to me,
"that's likely to happen in a bull market. Be happy with the profits you got
and ignore the ones you didn't get"(sic).

For what it's worth,

Ron,

Buy and Hold vs. Short Term (Fund)

Once again, tax advantages and historical track record. But some won't give
enough weight to Warren Buffet, so I'll just give an example with numbers:

Even in a buy and hold time frame as short as two years:

If an investor is in the 36% tax bracket, and trades short term (holding period
less than a year) he will have to make 15% a year pre-tax to match the two-year
buy and holder's return of only 11.87% pre-tax. The buy and holder can have a
21% reduction of return, yet after taxes net the same amount.

That leaves a pretty large margin of error for the buy and hold advocate. With
the track records I have seen, I don't believe there is a valid argument for
ANY performance penalty for a buy and holder (see my previous post re: TXN).

So, if you give the 'trader' and the 'buy and holder' both 15% pre-tax returns,
the buy and holder is ahead of the trader by 5.68% assuming a short two year
time frame. Extend the time frame to 5 or 10 years and the results are
geometrically higher.

Ron, of course the major assumption is that the stock keeps going up, with a
Microsoft or a Home Depot everyone does well and buy and hold works, however if
you were into Apple or Novell buy and hold doesn't work., and tax free accounts
can also eliminate the tax discrepancy.
I certainly don't have the answer and try and be somewhere in between with some
long term holdings over 4 years and some short term 4 days. If I have a general
rule its quality long term and volatility short term.

Abe,

I fully understand what you are saying - we must think after tax gains and I
wholeheartedly agree.

However, using the methods of investing I proposed, you would have followed TXN
up with stops and let it go when it started to drop, then followed it down with
stops (presuming you believe the stock will rebound). During the period it was
falling, the monies could have been in another stock that was gaining. The
overall gain would more than offset the difference in tax rates.

Very few individual investors are in a 36% tax bracket and many are dealing
with non-taxable accounts.

BTW - Buffet has a different situation in that any trade he might make
influences the market. When he started, he did not hold nearly as long and made
frequent trades. The same can be said for most anyone that has been successful
in the market.

For what it's worth,
Ron

BArron's has a very interesting interview with an absolute value investment
manager. The play I found most intriguing was New Valley Cumulative Preferred A
shares. I had never heard of the company before but they own office buildings,
a real estate complex in moscow and a brokerage firm, which I can never spell
correctly or pronounce-something like Landberg- Thalman. The Coupon is 19.75%,
and because it hasn't paid its dividend in a while, I guess the face value is
now about 250, which means that interest accrues at 55% annually!! The article
indicated that these shares had to be paid out by 2003 and that there were now
significant assets available to cover the outstanding amount which is around
$250MM. I suggest you all read the article and let me know what you think.
Based on my crude calculations and giving no value to the russian real estate
and no further appreciation on the existing properties I came to about 22%
annual return if held to maturity. It seems too good to be true, and a heck of
a play on both russia and real estate. I bought some today for my roth ira! The
spread is high because the float is very small. In the morning I was quoted
80-90 I put a limit in at 90 and I did not get it. That is the first time I put
a limit order in at the ask and failed to get a single share! Apparently 600
shares of earlier orders somehow traded ahead of me and then they raised the
bid/ask prior to executing my order so Caveat Emptor on this one.

Ron. Selling is possibly the final frontier in the art of profiting from the
stock market . As I say I don't have a real good or even consistent method. I
think that for some companies - Buffett companies or even lesser - something
maybe where a person can peer into the future and say, yes this company will
still be around - and it's a company that I want to partner up with - then at
some point it's reasonable to expect that company's stock price will exceed
fair or full value. Perhaps common sense or a natural inclination would be to
take profits, move on to something else (or just hold the cash), with perhaps
the intent to move back into the company when its price is lower. That does
sound very reasonable to me---BUT I do not think it is necessarily a basis for
selling the stock. I see stories of people who've traded in and out of the same
stock very successfully; their rationale being worse comes to worst they'll
hold 'til the stock comes back. Other people sell and never (well maybe once a
decade or two) get their chance to buy back in at what they consider a
reasonable price. I just think there is a place or time in investing where one
says, okay the stock is too high, but I'm not going to sell it just because
it's high-- I'm a partner in the business and I'm in it for the very long
term-- Especially if I sell, I know I'll have trouble getting back in. As you
know, a least a couple of people on this thread do IMO a super amount of
research on a stock or industry before they commit funds - large amounts of
funds. This is the old Phil Fisher method. That rationale goes something like
this: if the company (stock) is chosen correctly, the best time to sell is
never. If people are spending that much time and effort and dollars to find a
good company - their partner company I call it - then it could or would be a
mistake IMO (Phil Fisher's too I recall?) to sell the stock just because it's
20 or 40% overvalued now --because its sales & earnings will grow and bring the
value in line. And as Honest Abe says there's a good mathematical case that can
be made for not selling so quickly. Unlike finding undervalued companies,
opportunities to buy into partner companies at reasonable prices are few IMO
(and again Phil.). (There aren't a lot of new companies being mentioned on the
Buffettology thread! -g-)
My idea is this (and yes, I seem to be trapped into it - using the rationale
after I've got myself in this long term position with a couple of companies I'm
learning to live with): Do both. Hold something you like - the partner co. -for
as long as possible - 'til nerve fails or situation or whatever changes. (For
me, as I've said,I trim positions occasionally.) ALSO and in addition - buy
companies where the ruling reason is that the companies are undervalued and
WILL be sold when they get to fair or full value. These would be net-nets,
cyclicals (mining, steel, homebuilders,etc.), some techs, 2nd tier companies,
small caps maybe, etc. I think even here though, the same issue will occur.
It's in the nature of being a value investor. The value investor is cursed
(sometimes) after selling out at full value with seeing his/her stocks go even
higher. IMO it happens all the time sorry to say -g-.

Paul,

It's probably foolish for me to disagree with you or Abe (or most others on the
thread) because I don't have the experience. BUT - I very much disagree with
the 'buy and hold' strategy.

Our objective, at least mine, is to maximize returns. I'm not interested in an
attachment with a company, just using it to make a profit. As value investors,
we should be looking for undervalued stocks to buy. It doesn't matter which
company, but that it's worth more than it's selling for. By the same token, if
it gets to a price above it's value, we should sell it. If the market pushes it
above that point, the market is either foolish or they know something we don't.
In this market, I vote for the former.

As you've posted, if one looks hard enough, there are numerous stocks selling
under value. Why should your money be in a stock that's overvalued when it
could be in one that's undervalued? Why should one hold a stock that will gain
20% in the coming year when it's possible to buy one that should gain 20% (or
more) after the next earnings report? It takes research and effort but any
individual investors that aren't ready to work at it should put the monies into
a fund and let others work at it for them.

IMO - Value investors only have two advantages over the professional Fund
managers. First, we don't run with the herd. Secondly, we can move in and out
of stocks without effecting the price. We don't have the research capability of
the Pros. When we call the company, we can't talk to the CEO. We are usually
unable to attend the meetings. We can't go to the company and ask questions or
to their suppliers and customers for opinions. We are limited to financial
statements, press releases, and discussion on these threads. Most major stocks
are fully valued and we would be the last to know if they are going to fall off
in value.

There is a third advantage - we don't have a pot full of money we MUST invest
in something with restrictions on what we can put money into.

I would rather pay high taxes on a 200% portfolio gain versus low taxes on
30-40%.

I'm not trying to change anyone's investment style, just giving reasons why I
disagree and why I invest the way I do.

For what it's worth,
Ron

New Valley. When I read it in Barrons it sounded too good to be true. My best
value investments were too good to be true, but this one sounded just a little
too good. Are there assets to cover the interest payments? If so, why are the
payments accrued? Is there some hidden liability? Russian real estate...OK, you
wrote that off to zero. If you have done your homework, now you've bought it -
fill us in. If you bought that just off the Barrons article, I hope that's just
"play money". Remember, that investor in Barrons only manages $15 million. He
talked a good game, but if he had any kind of track record, I would think he
would have attracted more investors. There are several reasons for skepticism.

On the other hand, I was intrigued by the article too. Reading (RDGE) looked
most interesting to me as a Ben Graham investment. But there are so many
classes of stock and hidden options that we're talking a lot of research before
I can be comfortable. I won't invest until I do enough homework to be
comfortable, but I read the 10-K and things check so far. That is only the
start of my research. It might take weeks to make an educated decision on this
one. But it does look interesting so far. And it didn't move much today off the
Barrons story.

James, it isn't play money, and I haven't done as much homework as I would have
liked. But usually I find that when something comes into the public view like
this, by the time I have analyzed it to my satisfaction the price has gotten
away from me and I do better to look at what I can quickly, make a preliminary
decision and then reassess.
Especially here, the float is less than 300,000 and the spread is large. And
there are many reasons an inefficiency here could exist. In this case I
reviewed the 9/30/97 10-K. Verified the interest rate and face value of
preferred and assets on the balance sheet. In my review I did not see anything
that conflicted with the article. Of course I may have overlooked something,
which is why I asked whether anyone else had looked at this. I am far from from
infallible. It would be nice to know the current market price of the real
estate assets but that might take weeks and by that time the price of the issue
could soar. Leasing income for nine months was $19MM. I will try to get more
info on this and report back.
With respect to the small amount of money he manages don't forget he runs a
hedge fund not a mutual fund and that his returns have probably not been that
great on his "shorts".

two year time frame. Extend the time frame to 5 or 10 years and the results are

"if" is the key word, the goal of a trader is to catch many small upward moves
(or short downward moves) during the year. What most investors seem to do is
look at trading the same way as investing, while they are 2 total different
animals. As an investor one might have 10 different stocks each being 10% of
portfolio, so if the average gain is 15% they make 15% for the year. while a
trader might own each of those same 10 stocks 3-4 times during the year making
say an average of 3% each time. The real advantage is that as a trader, is that
on each of those times a trader will have 1/3 to 1/2 of his/her equity in the
stock. There for a Trader might well make 40% (40 x 3% x 1/3) playing the same
stocks while only averaging 12.5% on each stock.

Trading for the most part is based on technicals and news vs. Investing which
is based on fundamentals. Both can help you reap higher returns in the other.
Good fundamentals adds an added margin of safety to trading, and the technicals
better entry prices for investing. There are many ways to make money in the
market. Each of us has to find what we are comfortable with and what works for
us personally.

To the Traders:

I can't argue with your logic that theoretically you can make much more money
'trading' than 'investing'. Obviously stocks move up and down from point A to
point B, and if you can time the moves to some degree you can make more. And if
you aren't in the market all the time because of these timing efforts, you can
argue you have taken on less risk.

But, with the thousands of mutual funds that operate as 'traders', why have
none of them consistently outperformed? Your arguments make it sound as if it
is easy, yet I have not yet seen an example of it even being consistently
possible.

With investing, you have to pick the company and an entry. When the story
changes, sell. With trading, you have to pick the company, entry, exit,
reentry, reexit, and are disadvantaged with commissions and slippage (though
commissions are certainly becoming less of a factor these days!) as well as
negative tax consequences.

But MOST IMPORTANTLY, the point I find hardest to argue with:

(I have seen these studies before - I found this info here:
http://www.planretire.com/newsletter/June97.htm#disclosure)

"With the market showing more than the usual downside volatility recently, it
is common and understandable to want to find a way to get out to side-step the
drop,
and then to re-enter in time to get all the recovery. Such a technique is known
as "market timing".

Such ability would be nice, but history shows it to be difficult at best and
nearly impossible to pull off consistently.

Here's why. From 1983 to 1992, the Standard & Poor's 500 achieved a 16.2
annualized return for those fully invested there for all 2,526 trading days.

But if you had missed out on just the ten best days, your return would have
been reduced to just 11.2%.

Missing the best 20 days caused the return to fall to 8.6%.

Failing to participate in the best 30 days whittled the return to just 6.0%.

If one missed the best 40 days, the annualized return fell to a miserable 3.6%.

Many of those "best" days came roaring out of the depths of the deepest drops,
without time to observe a turn in the market in time to get in.

Over the long haul, the risk of being out of the market is greater than the
risk of being in.

(These examples assume assets not held in stocks earned interest at the average
rate of 30-day T'Bills over the same period.)"

(I got the next example on a different web site, but lost the link...)

"If you invested $100 in the
stock market in 1926 and simply kept your money there through 1993, your
investment would be worth $80,000. But if you tried to time the market
and "missed" the 30 best months, your $100 would have grown to only about
$1,200-the same return you would have received investing in U.S.
government T-bills. "

Just saying that there are other methods that offer good results also. Phil
Fisher says, I think, that there is much or more profit with less risk in a buy
and hold of just a very few-- the correctly selected few--- stocks. And as I

You said, "With investing, you have to pick the company and an entry. When the

My point exactly. An investor should buy in when a stock is undervalued and
sell when overvalued. This can be an increase in price, a change in company
situation, a change in sector situation, or various other reasons. An investor
should not continue to hold a stock when the price is over the value of the
company.

The argument is how to determine that value. I find the market values most
companies much higher than I do.

I didn't clarify myself. When I say, "when the story changes", I am referring
to the company fundamentals, not price.

Here is my process:

Find a great company, because of whatever reasons (balance sheet, market
leader, innovative products, whatever). Just a great company.

Next, buy if the price is undervalued.

Sell when it is no longer a great company. No analysis on price whatsoever. If
the reasons that led me to believe it was a great company changed, I will sell.

Example: TXN is a great company because of its willingness to dump the majority
of their sub-par divisions and focus practically all their energies into DSP. I
believe DSP will be a lot bigger than the market realizes. As long as TXN is
the market leader in DSP's and they are holding their margins, and as long as
the internet bandwidth problem still exists, I will hold onto TXN. If they
start making less money off of DSPs I will sell. If the internet bandwidth
problem is solved, and a couple years pass, allowing full market realization of
the enormous potential for DSPs, currently and in the future, I will sell. If
TXN goes to 1000 tomorrow, I will hold. And all of you would have gotten out at
100.

The recent posts on 'buy and hold' make me reflect on our differences and the
reason we often post in disagreement.

I have been reading every post you've made on SI for over a year because I
highly respect your opinions. You are one of seven that I bookmark. I also
track many of the companies you have bought even if I didn't chose to buy them
myself. With some exceptions, the list is very impressive.

I follow you because I agree with your 'value appraisal' of the various
companies. You have an ability to find the weakness and the reasons not to buy
rather than looking for the reasons to buy. I feel this to be a mistake many
investors make: letting emotion override good analysis of a company.

We differ in two areas: You are holding some stocks I would have sold. I prefer
intensive research into a concentrated portfolio. We both 'value invest', just
have a difference in strategy. I likely should lean more to your thinking,
perhaps you to mine.

BTW - You have criticized my posts with much sarcasm. I encourage you to
continue in that manner (as long as you intersperse it with some -g-). It is
your wisdom I seek and I would hate to see it inhibited. Besides, your humor
more than offsets the rancor. (Met your match with porc didn't you? I loved

I have never seen a study which says that IF you had been OUT of the market for

This discussion on when to sell comes at a very important time for me. In the
interest of adding to the discussion I would like to submit my "problem". I
have had a ~%100 gain in 14 monthes with a company called Tyco International
(TYC). They have four major business units which have grown through
acquisitions (and continue to grow). I have been very impressed with management
and basically have no complaints. I could not recommend it as a value at this
point although I admit to losing track of its balance sheet after all the M&A
that has been going on.

I have no specific use for the money except to maybe feed an already bloated
cash supply. My question is who on this thread would sell this company and take
the gains and who would hold based on my faith in management and confidence in
their business plan?

I hope the thread could use this "real world" example as fodder for more
discussion on when to sell. Clearly selling at the right time is just as
important as buying at the right price.

Thank you,
John

I wasn't trying to convince anyone that trading is the way to go. I personally
do both and understand the risks and rewards of each. What lead me to making my
post was a typical investor mentality statement were using only one stock a
argument is made that trading wouldn't do as well. This may well be true, but
really has nothing to do with what trading is about.

Some of my current value holdings are stocks like SFC & CRG.

May whichever way you play the market may your gains be large and your losses
tiny.

<<But, with the thousands of mutual funds that operate as 'traders', why have
none of them consistently outperformed?>>

I can think of two major reasons. First of all the funds out there are dealing
with a lot more capital than we are and they need to stay fully invested. They
have a major problem with being able to play concentrated positions. By law
they can't own more than 15% of a company. The second reason is liquidity. So
if they do want to trade they can only trade really big companies that offer
the proper liquidity to do that. The only problem with the big companies for
trading is that those companies lack the volatility needed to get the short
term large price moves to make money trading. There are some exceptions like
INTC, CPQ, AMAT. But who wants to tell their clients that hey, look how much
risk I'm taking as a fund manager. I have all your money in three companies.
They don't have the balls.

The good news is that me and you don't have to play by these restrictions.
Really can't say that if the professionals can't do it then I certainley can't
because they are the best that's out there. Not true. We have the advantage
because we don't have to abide by the same rules. We have excellent liquidity
in just about any company we trade and we can take concentrated positions. We
can put 100% of our capital in a $3 stock if we want to. They can't.

In value investing as defined by its two greatest
practitioners, Graham and Buffett, there are two
main methods of finding undervaluation - looking
at the present, and looking way beyond Wall Street
to points 5+ years in the future.

The key to knowing when to sell is to know why you bought.

If you bought based on an undervaluation of the
company's current situation a la Graham, then you should look
to sell when fair valuation is approached. You should
gladly give up any further momentum-driven appreciation.

If you bought based on future expectations a la Buffett, then
you obviously have a strong company that meets Buffett's
criteria, and may be a candidate for a long-term hold. Note that
relatively few of even Buffett's stocks meet this.
Perusing Berkshire's portfolio over the years reveals many,
nay most, are 1-3 year deals.

I do not know TYC but I will address your question generally.

If a company's stock becomes materially overpriced by anyone's standard it
should be sold, whether or not it is a good company. A good company whose stock
has merely become fully priced should be sold if you have a better idea, but
not otherwise - since it will probably continue to be good, and recover if
there is a price setback. A mediocre company that you bought right but is now
fully priced should be sold if you have a better idea, and probably otherwise -
because the fact that it is mediocre likely as not means they will do something
not so smart again. (That advice probably cost me a million dollars to learn;
and I do not follow it enough.)

It sounds like TYC is in the second category above.

After re-reading my post I realized that it sounded like I was trying to get

the real-world example but thanks for responding.

I had actually made up my mind this weekend to continue to hold. My opinion
isn't very educated but I believe TYC to be a good company that is a leader in
many of its areas, with acquisitions that are accretive to earnings and solid
management. Again, I can't recommend it as a "value" but then I wouldn't have
bought MSFT at $90! (pre-split). Perhaps it would fit as a Slightly Buffetty
Value Stock? :)

Anyways, this discussion is excellent and aptly timed. Thanks for the response.

Ron,

You said, "I can't make an intelligent response because I am somewhat in awe of
these
statements. What is your purpose in investing in the market? To own a piece of
TXN?"

You say this as if I'm an idiot if my purpose in investing in the market is to
own a piece of TXN. Yet, that IS my purpose in investing in the market. I don't
consider it investing in the 'market'. I consider it owning a piece of TXN,
which is literally exactly what I am doing, and you are doing, and everyone is
doing when they are buying stocks. They are buying the companies. Period.
Losing sight of that fact is totally ignorant and perhaps dangerous.

I fully respect market timers, and I am obviously in the minority here as a
buy-and-holder. But if you consider yourself a value investor you are flying
with one eye blind if you don't at a minimum read about Buffett's style. After
that, your call. Buffett's primary mentality is that you are buying a piece of
the company, and should treat it as such. Michael Burry contrasted the two
value approaches perfectly - they are different, yet they are also both value.

I have actually seen the other stats (what if you missed the 10 worst days...).
The results are as you'd expect - much, much higher. I will entertain the
notion that one can time a stock's movements to some degree, but I will argue
strongly against the ability to call the 50 best/worst days. Timing a stock can
keep you out of either side, I guess. I'd rather take the volatility and KNOW
I'll be in the good days, than try to time it and, hey, who knows?

I don't think this argues that you need an index fund, though. (Although it's
not that bad of a way to invest, IMO). I just think it argues to always be
fully invested.

RE: Buy and Hold

I began purchasing stocks in the mid- to late-1960s. I've gone through many
stages, including short term trading, options, etc. The investment style that
works the best for me is to dollar cost average into quality growth stocks over
long periods of time. I try to "double-up" on my purchases when the stock is
out of favor or undervalued. Of course, this strategy is based on the buy and
hold approach.

Please note that the above strategy is my most profitable approach, not my only
approach. My sucker spot is "bottom fishing." I find it hard to resist buying
severely beaten down stocks, even though my bottom fishing efforts are far less
profitable.

Today, a company called The Money Store (NYSE-MON) is being acquired by First
Union Corp. At 34 dollars acquisition price, it would be valued at
approximately 3.7 times book and 17 times earnings.
I own a company called Resource Bancshares Mortgage Group (NASDAQ-REMI), which
is in a similar, though certainly not identical, business. It is valued at less
than 2 times book, 11.5 times '97 earnings, and 7.75 times '98 estimates, which
I feel are doable. Comments and analysis from the thread would be most

I have only briefly looked at MON vs. REMI, but my impression is that MON deals
with niche lending opportunities that involve higher interest rates (currently
they are primarily into home equity loans). From their commercials, I believe
they are helping people consolidate their higher-rate debt (credit cards, etc.)
and pay it off with a lower home equity loan.

REMI simply packages mortgages up and sells most of them to Fannie Mae, etc. In
dealing with these other companies, it seems to me to be a much lower risk
strategy, and since they are not taking on the credit risk that MON is, I would
assume their margins are much smaller.

So, yes, same business, but one seems rather conservative and one rather
aggressive. That should explain the differences in their ratios.

Not trying to say if one or both are a good value, though. No opinion there.

Stock should be able to do okay in next 18 months. Aggressive management and

and sell at more reasonable multiple than 10 which analysts seem to be

My portfolio http://www.sealpoint.com/star.html has had

That said, I will be looking to acquire Intel. It appears
the market is focusing on the short-term, when in fact
we are in a lull in the software/hardware cycle. No new
software is around to stimulate the purchase of Intel's
latest greatest products. But it will come. Intel's R&D
edge is just huge. As with Nike, I won't touch Intel
unless it's ridiculous (below 60), and I won't look at it
as a cost to me if I miss an opportunity.

like Temic IC was just dumped at a bargain price. The increased European

winners. Pretty diversified company in terms of products - some relatively low
tech (e.g. EEPROM), some advanced stuff (e.g. programmable logic), some
commodity products (e.g. flash unfortunately). Near term, you have to consider
the debt and whether you can get over the write-offs (mostly wireless

Noticed Nike's bounced today as institutions run for liquid value -
bad on me, but my portfolios are up over 1% today so I'm not
throwing a tantrum, as emotional youngsters like me are prone to do.

I have no gray hairs, but I've noticed something - I monitor about
80 stocks on Yahoo that I like fundamentally for one reason
or another. Every once in a while one will just start falling
or will really light up the screen with a large daily percentage
loss, like INTC is doing. That will cause me to look into it.
And sometimes, one of these stocks will just look like a can't
lose situation. And sometimes, the stock will remain there
long enough for me to do my due diligence. And sometimes,
when I like a stock, I'll actually end up buying it. So missing
out on a lot is part of my strategy.

YUM, SJP, BMC, MSA, PHSYA, ELAMF, DSWLF, and TBR were all values
found by being patient and waiting for my price. And they've
proven solid so far - more my strategy than the stocks
themselves, I presume. HYDEA is the only one that I didn't
have to wait on since it'd been flatlining so long.

Like I said, I look on myself as young and in an experimenting
phase. I've only been investing now 6 years, and I feel like
it's just in the last two years that I'm seeing a light. I wasted
a lot of money on so-called growth/momo investing - in 1992, my
total return was 14% on over 100 trades with >1000% turnover,
cut to 5% by commissions and then cut again by taxes. And in
1996, I was there sifting through the broken remains of tech
during April-July 96, but bought and sold too early on just about
every stock I had. I moved to value investing just under two years
ago, if that - my summer 96 foray into tech was a first
experience. Recently I incorporated a 10-stock goal concentration
for my portfolio, which I like a lot. Can I be overdoing the
patience-on-the-buy thing - another newish concept for me? We'll see.
But I took the 10-stock goal from statistical studies re: risk,
and I'm taking the waitnsee approach from Buffett. I'm not
presuming to re-invent investing.

I am reading every reasonable book on investing I can
find. I've just finished Mike Murphy's tech stocks book -
my biggest frustration has been an inability to value tech stocks,
so I'm trying to correct that. Based on his methods, techs are
way overvalued as a group, but there may be individual values.
I don't agree with everything he says, but overall he is
a long-term investor looking for values. I liked the book.

75 on INTC, althought both Nike and INTC languished for extended

you were aware of them at the lower levels (as was the
world). INTC's fall is spectacular today, but does that help you make
your decision? Or do you see a fundamental change that you

Re: HYDEA/B

HYDE is up today on huge volume -g-.
Latest SEC 13G indicates that Bill Nasgovitz of Heartland
is still buying shares and is up to 28.8% of the B shares. He must have been
the only buyer in recent months. Recently the B shares were selling for the
same as the A shares. Though
I own the A shares, only the B shares get any future dividend,
so they are the better buy given the same price.

Reviewing the last Q report, backlog was up when most shoe
cos except Adidas were reporting down. Saucony is an undervalued
asset, and I am moving toward looking at HYDEA as more than
a net net, though for now I would still sell at net asset
value. The Yahoo thread is all doom and gloom "I'm getting
out of this dog but I can't cuz there are no buyers." The
way I look at it, they've cut businesses, acquired businesses,
and even made a half-hearted marketing effort in the last
two years. And they're profitable. My other net-net JBM
took off from 2.5 to 4 in short order on a single acquisition
announcement. Sometimes it just takes recognition.

HYDEA looks like a good private business, but a lousy public
one, as someone on the Yahoo thread said. With its float getting
smaller, it wouldn't take much for someone to realize that
there's no difference between the two and bid the price up.

It's no coincidence that on a bad day for the
markets I'm posting like crazy - I'm just giddy
in times like this.

I want to clarify my post on Mike Murphy's book.
I like his underlying approach, but he doesn't follow
his own advice with his stock picks. And I don't
quite believe "growth flow" although it might point one
in the right direction. He has good reviews of the major
industries, and the strategy is there. Looking over his
own picks, he doesn't follow that 15% ROE rule very well.
Nor does he follow his <50% downside risk rule well.

That said, here's something about the book and him
that makes him sound like Wade Cook and may dissuade
anyone here from buying the book. It's from the Boston
Globe in February.

Michael Murphy is a man with a message: The "New Economy" is technology,
and investors stuck in the "Old Economy" are destined to be left behind.

It doesn't matter if you buy technology stocks or technology funds, says
Murphy, the
founder and editor of the well-known California Technology Stock Letter. The
point
is to buy technology - and BUY IT NOW!

Murphy was in town yesterday, hawking his vision and his book, "Every
Investor's
Guide to High-Tech Stocks and Mutual Funds" (Broadway Books), which is getting
good ink in places such as The New York Times and Business Week. We know
Murphy from his daily CNBC ads, and somewhere along the way yesterday we
asked him what kind of numbers his newsletter put up last year and how it
stacked up
against the competition.

"I'm not sure. I just haven't seen them," said the 56-year-old Murphy
curiously. An
investment letter writer not able to cite his most recent returns is a little
like Wade
Boggs not knowing his batting average. What's the chance of that?

Let's just say the numbers aren't what you want to take out on your next book
tour.

In last year's roaring bull market, Murphy's model portfolio produced a loss of
36.7
percent while the Wilshire 5000 was up 31.3 percent. That ranked Murphy's
letter
number 140 of 142 newsletters followed by Hulbert Financial Digest, which has
long tracked the advice business.

The numbers get better over the long term, but not a lot better. Over 10 years,
his
letter was up 135 percent, vs. 405 percent for the Wilshire. Hulbert says over
15
years the California Technology Stock Letter is up 124 percent, compared with
911
percent for the Wilshire, ranking it 24th of 30 letters over that period.

We're going to pay $27.50 for the book or $295 a year for the newsletter for
this?

Murphy's record illustrates perfectly what a few stinko years can do to an
investor's
bottom line. The California Technology Stock Letter did do very well for a
decade
starting in 1986, and was in fact rated the number one newsletter by Forbes in
1996.
But the letter was a loser from 1983 to '85 and has had a couple of bad years
of late.
The result is what you see.

In picking stocks, Murphy focuses on research and development spending and an
unusual approach he calls "growth flow."

Murphy says his growth flow concept is a little like tracking cash flow. But
instead
of using depreciation as analysts use in valuing "the old industrial economy,"
growth
flow combines earnings per share and R&D per share as a way of capturing the
intellectual capital that is so important to New Economy companies. He then
divides
growth flow per share by the price of the stock to determine the "crucial
ratio" for
buying cheap stocks.

"That's all there is to it!" Murphy tells us on Page 137. Well, maybe not quite
all.
Murphy says Michael Metz, Oppenheimer's chief investment strategist, has
started
using growth flow. In an interview, Metz said growth flow is "a beginning," but
adds
that it has "many shortfallings."

High-tech companies, in particular, can spend hundreds of millions on research
only to have an entire sector leapfrogged and become obsolete overnight, he
says.
"Suddenly the whole thing goes down the drain," Metz says.

Certainly the world has not been going Murphy's way.

Three mutual funds he started late in 1996 did poorly last year. The Murphy
Technology fund was down 17 percent and Murphy New World Technology
managed a bare 0.35 percent gain; meanwhile, the Morgan Stanley High Tech index
was up 17 percent. The Murphy Biotechnology fund was up about 1 percent,
topping
the Standard & Poor's biotech index, which was down about one-half of 1
percent.

Murphy says his mistake in '97 was betting big on biotech in all the funds and
doing
it on margin, which magnified the losses. "We thought 1997 would be a year of
biotech," he says. "We think this year will be the year for biotech."

The good news for investors: There is just $ 5.5 million in the three funds.

Besides California Technology Stock Letter, Murphy also publishes Overpriced
Stock Service, which he touts as "the premier short-selling investment advisory
newsletter in the world." Hulbert's numbers for that newsletter: down 16
percent for
one year, down 85 percent for three years, and down 89 percent for five.

What's Overpriced? You can figure it out. Here's hoping the book sales are
going
better.

Wallace,

I am a shareholder of The Money Store, and am looking into a new place to move
some of my money. My database says that REMI is experiencing growth in its
subprime division (where MON specializes). Revenue growth for REMI seems
comparable to MON.

One concern: The sub-prime lenders such as MON have gone through a shakeout,
with many restating financials (consider Green Tree) and increasing loss
reserves. This in turn leads to lowered debt ratings which lowers their
margins. It's difficult for me to assess the quality of loans that a company
has on it's books, but if REMI is following conservative accounting I'm
certainly interested. I will look into this stock as time permits.

Mike,

I agree with you on INTC. I would love to get in at under $60, but would be
surprised to see it drop to that level. Calloway is also near the top of my
interest list but I have revenue growth concerns. Do you think Calloway can
continue to grow revenues at 15 to 20%? If so, I like ELY. (Did we also agree
on Deswell Industries?)

2 Small Cap Tech Stocks of interest to me. Note: I currently own neither.

Innovex (INVX): supplier to disk drive industry (and is similarly depressed in
price) but trying to diversify. Many on the INVX thread argue that INVX's
technology is most cost effective. Mkt cap around $320 million. ROE over 27%
for last 3 yrs. 90+% sales growth in recent year. Trailing PE @ 10. Almost zero
Long term debt. 24% margins in recent year.

Electronics for Imaging (EFII): color printing. Market is set to explode IMO
and they are well connected to major manufacturers. Recently some have begun to
doubt management, however, so I am cautious. 20+% ROE, 40% sales/share growth,
PE around 11, no Long term debt, margins around 20%.

In addition to INTC, one other tech stock that I think may just qualify as a
value stock, although so many of the traditional valuations say "no" is Cisco.
Despite high PE, high P/S, we're talking about a company with growing market
power, ROE of around 25%, Sales/Share growth of 40% (although this growth rate
may be slowing), around 17% margins, and no debt. This company can grow quickly
enough over time to justify it's current high valuation. I estimate that _if_
Cisco can maintain 17% margins and 30% sales growth over 5 years, ROI should be
at least 20% annually. It's not as cheap as INTC, but it's not nearly as
inflated as it may seem at first glance.

I obviously like REMI, as does the analyst at the firm I do business with

target for the stock.
On the down side, we have the long bond backing up over 6% (IMO that's still
pretty low and a good refi environment for REMI) plus a negative report today
from Emergent Group (EMER).
On the positive side, you get a fast growing company trading significantly

(This is pre-split). I was looking for 60 a couple months ago, and maybe was

the stock is cheap, maybe its not...but there are other much smarter people who
know the business much better than I do. And as Buffett would say, I will be

I hear talk of MOT, which I would suggest is an attractive Buy at mid to high

PE to its (now reduced) growth rate. IMO the most expert company in the big cap
universe at the earnings warning - they do it just about every Q!
I am much more interested in CPQ at what will be lower levels on Monday.
Neither long nor short but contemplating entry. Their earnings will obviously
come down significantly after their warning Fri. But in my mind still remains a
dominant company with respected mgmt. - much more so than MOT. MOT seems to
have been absolutely destroyed by Nokia and Ericsson and their digital lines,
as well as other mgmt. missteps. The computer biz changes so fast that pre

My only comment is that 1 1/2 years ago, after much research, I bought a high
end Dell - and stupidly did not think to draw the obvious investment
conclusion!

Also, with @HOME cable modem service and a (slow?) 200 mhz setup, I see no need
at all to upgrade my computer ever for current uses. The obvious investment
conclusion is that the growth rate of computer sales will likely slow until new
applications are developed requiring more power. Admittedly there is room for
growth in sales of $1,000
machines to people who have never bought one. But it takes about 3 of such
people just to come out even with one purchaser like me for a $3,500 system
deciding the old one is fine.

I just had a thought - maybe there is more similarity between NIKE
and CPQ than you would think - like who needs another ........? If
I am at all near the mark, this would not be a good development for the tech
industry, or its stocks.

In the Compaq/Dell euphoria over the last year, I have been on the sidelines
somewhat perplexed. My first purchase was a Compaq, then I bought a Packard
Bell to save a couple hundred dollars and never regretted it. This is a
commodity business if I ever saw one. Dell so far has been a different animal.
But I can't for the life of me understand why nobody can duplicate their
strategy. Where am I wrong here on my industry analysis (this is an industry
about which I claim no special - or any particular - expertise) - but I would
like to think I could understand a superior industry at least in hindsight. But

I also claim no special expertise. However, I believe for the reasons

computer power. That combined with the enormous advances these stocks have made
in the last several years suggests to me that these are not "Value Investing"
stocks. Of course, I am sure someone also said that about MSFT years ago.

As far as duplicating DELL goes, didn't Intel attribute some of their problem
to Just-In-Time ordering by computer OEMs? Maybe others are now figuring out
how to do it. Therefore, I would now regard CPQ as a
possible trading buy on a selloff, not a cheap long term investment.

You're not missing anything big. Dell's whole edge is its
inventory management, which has allowed it to avoid the inventory
problems of every single other PC manufacturer. It rarely
gets the highest marks for quality, and just as rarely gets
the marks for customer service.

Micron, Gateway and the other direct sellers have to
replicate the inventory system in place at Dell. No simple task,
but doable over the next year or two. And then Dell loses its comparative glow.
It will still dominate corporate sales, but it
becomes a widely recognized pure commodity business that is cyclical
nonetheless and hence not worth 54 times earnings at the top of its cycle. It
seems like an obvious short to me. The last 20-30 points

I actually tried to short Dell Friday afternoon, but the order
didn't go through in time (although my computer said there
were two minutes left, the market was "fast moving" and mine
wasn't filled in time - figure that one out). I saw it go back
to near its high at 138 1/2 and just couldn't stand it any longer -
it was too obvious a short.

Well, I was right. Today it stands at about 126 pre-split. My
idea of shorting is to start positions on value/technical basis,
but exit on pure technicals. That's how I'm doing it. I haven't
had my head handed to me shorting anything yet, because I short
at technical inflection points with tiny buy-stops. My buy stop
on Dell was 140, or less than a 2% loss.

I'm not shorting anything else right now - I want future ones
to be as obvious as Dell. IOW, I still want the margin of safety
in the short - both technical and valuation tools have to be
extreme. I look at it as arbitration and special situations - a toppy

I read each issue of PC Magazine and Windows Magazine, cover to cover. Other
magazines may judge differently, but those two have given Dell computers more
awards than any other brand over the last two years. Presently, Windows
Magazine has five Dell desktops on the "WinList" and only one Micron. For
notebooks, the ratio is three to one. Dell has also been in the top category
for service in every survey I've seen. On the personal level, people I know who
have Dell's in their business swear by them.

I have never owned a Dell computer or their stock. Over the last year, I have
often thought about shorting the stock, and I have even made at least one
failed attempt at a limit short order. Michael Dell stubbed his toe a few years
ago with ironically poor management of memory chip inventory. I thought they

Re: SUNW and UNMG.

FWIW, added to my position in SUNW (Sun Microsystems) today.

Started initial position in Unimark -- UNMG. Here's the story as I see it:
Company "makes" citrus, other juices. Essentially a new management team has
come in - bought out the former guy (who was Pres. CEO, and Chairman)@$5.00 sh
for his 6% stake. BV is about $5.4/sh., per Yahoo. If this is correct (and I've
seen many Yahoo cases where it hasn't been -g-), then either the new guys got a
good deal or the former top guy knew very well what he was doing when he sold
control for less than BV. During the time of all these negotiations they
apparently also brought in an investment firm to help maximize shareholder
value. And the investment firm is continuing to work with the new controlling
management team.
Notwithstanding the perks the new managers (at least some of whom worked at
UNMG before their purchase) get with their ability to control the company-- I'd
like to believe they would want to see maybe at least a one point gain in the
price of the stock from where they bought. $5 going to $6 dollars say in maybe
a couple of years. Seems like it might be doable. PSR looks okay, growing
sales, not much earnings though. Numbers seem okay in comparison to competitor
Odwalla (although I don't have access to the big boys'= Minutemaid, Tropicana
numbers or strategy). I bought UNMG at $4 today -- so my bet is a 50% gain ($6)
within those two years. Seems like a reasonable expectation to me. 'Course I
have reasonable expectations every time I go into a bar and yet nothing ever

What I've heard is that when crude drops below $16/barrel (obviously which it

I'll insert a few reasons TMAR is worth a second look.

1. A couple of value fund managers have been plugging it. Not that this SHOULD
have any real effect, but the PR has been positive.

2. At one time recently the P/E to expected earnings growth rate is (was?) one
of the lowest in the entire market. It showed up in a few stock screening
tools.

3. Although there is fear of future earnings, earnings for the next year will
not likely be impacted. There shouldn't be and downward suprises come earnings
day.

4. Call premiums are high for us chickens that want to remove some of the risk
holding an 'oil related' stock. Make no mistake, these stocks are low because
of real fear in this sector and often fear is irrational.

Sorry for butting in, just had to inject my opinion!
