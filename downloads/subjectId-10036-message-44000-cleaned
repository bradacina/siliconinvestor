I've decided to hedge my euro exposure in VLKAY with ProShares Ultra-Short Euro
(NYSE:EUO) ETF. I think with the euro sitting at $1.44 and both Germany and
France unwilling to share credit with their southern brethren I don't
understand why the premium over the USD, but as I said it's just a hedge. If
the euro goes down to $1.20 and share prices in Europe don't change, we'll be
able to pick up more shares at a 17% discount.

EUO gives -200% on the exchange USD/EU based on daily spot prices - hence
short-term gains/losses to be considered and also K-1 will be given at yearend.

Let me know if you are doing something else.

No hedge for me, Difco. Although I have been considering shorting Honda HMC as
an offset to VLKAY.
I've heard that Honda cars are losing their technical and/or marketing edge. My
understanding is that several models are not competitive, not doing well in
sales in US.

I rarely short, and when I do, I do not do well. Plus, HMC stock is down for a
number of reasons already, and it could be temporary (shortage of product?). So
for these reasons, I'm reluctant to attempt shorting Honda stock.

If euro does drop, and if my wife says okay, our next vacation will be in
Spain, Portugal, or France. A consolation this, in lieu of a hedge. -g-

PE is not that low at around 12x but there is net cash on the balance sheet and

Lucas Energy, Inc. (LEI)

Hi Paul - I have done more analysis on the valuation of LEI and have concluded
that this stock is still quite undervalued at $1.86/share..

Your previous review looked at the valuation based on their Eagle Ford land
holdings only. Your conclusion that the company was undervalued just on this
basis. I have added a bit more clairity and added in the increased value based
on actual BOPD production too.

I have reviewed all of their property interests including both their (1) deep
well mineral rights and (2) their two different JV agreements w Marathon and
Hill Corp. They own a 4,400 net acreage interest in the Eagle Ford. (Note: Yor
post on 7/20/2011 verified this as well).

Recent sales have topped out at $21,400/acre.<u> For this analysis I am
assuming a fair value price of $11K/acre. 4,400 X $11K/22M shares Out =</u>
$2.42/share value.

<u>Here is the interesting "Value Added" based on current 2011 BOED and 2012
(forecast) BOED.</u>

Based on their June 2011 presentation: (
http://www.lucasenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LEI-Presentation-060811.p
f ) they state their BOPD production from (1) Operated and (2) Non Operated
properties.

<u>On page 17 of the presentation: </u>

Operated Production 2011 - 200 BOPD
Forcasted Production increase 2012: - 600 BOPD

Total for 2012 Forcasted: 800 BOPD x 60,000/BOPD = $48M/20M share Out =
$2.40/share

(Note: $60,000/BOPD is the back of the envelope value drillers use when
calculating a fair value for current BOPD production when they Buy E&P
companies. This number can vary based on the price of Oil but is pretty
accurate when you look at past sales).

<u>On page 18 of the presentation</u>:

Gross Non-Operated Production 2011 - 400 BOPD
New Eagle Ford Wells to be completed in 2012 - 600 BOPD

Total Non Operated Gross - 1000 BOPD x 32.5% = 325 BOPD X $60,000/BOPD=
$18.5M/20M share Out= $1.05/share.

(Note: Their new JV entitles them to 50% interest in their Marathon deal & 15%
interest in their Hillcorp deal, their average vested interest in the
non-operated acreage is 32.5%.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------

Therefore, my low end valuation of LEI is $5.87/share. This is the price I
would begin to peel off shares. You could justify up to $8.29/share based on
the $24K/acre last sale price but that would be the high end. The key is how
they meet their 2012 BOPD production targets especially with their operated
wells.

I feel quite comfortable with my most recent buys at $2,83/share on 7/21/2011 &
08/17/2011 @ $2.13/share. With the current market price at $1.86/share, I am
tempted to buy more shares. LEI currently represents 8% of my E&P basket. I may
go in for another Buy next week to bring it up to 10% of the E&P basket.

I don't know that there's much less competition among the airlines. Seems like
a pretty competitive sector to me.

You might look at http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=AER:US , the

I continue to hold shares in this one. There are other aircraft lessors; this

Only that it might be sort of an alternative to airline stocks to look at.

re LEI - but you need to account for the dilution due to the ongoing operating
losses. They increase their sharecount by a couple of million shares each
quarter. Now they have only 700k$ left, so it looks like another "ATM offering"
is due. They are asset rich but cash and cash flow poor - a combination that
does not work well in the current market.

In addition, I believe you may be making a mistake to double count assets, if
you add the flowing barrel value to the land value, since they are the same
property. At the very least, you are counting 2012 flow rates but do not count
the cost to develop these properties, which I think is going to be significant.

Based on the prevailing land prices, you have probably enough of a safety
margin to account for the factors mentioned above, assuming that management
would do the right thing for shareholders (which may be to sell out if the
shareprice goes too low to allow for accreditive financing using secondaries.

Hi Madharry -

When LEI announced their JV with HilCorp in July 2010, they gave up 85% of
their interest in their leases for $8.9 million in cash. This cash inflow
should support their drilling operations for another year (maybe).

Lucas Energy Closes Part II of Eagle Ford Shale Joint Venture
Monday, July 05, 2010

From the article:...Lucas Energy, Inc., an independent oil and gas company
based in Houston, Texas, announces that the Company has closed the second part
of its Eagle Ford joint venture with Hilcorp Energy I, L.P., an affiliate of
Hilcorp Energy Company, one of the largest privately owned oil and gas
companies in the United States. Hilcorp Energy I, L.P. has acquired interests
in additional leases in the Company's Eagle Ford acreage in Gonzales County,
Texas. Additional Eagle Ford properties will be part of a third closing that is
expected to take place by the end of July. To date, Lucas has received $8.9
million for an 85% working interest in approximately 10,500 acres in Gonzales
County, Texas...."

They did two other JV in 2011 (1) Seidler Oil & Gas, LP on 4/2011 and (2)
Marathon Oil (East Texas) LP, a subsidiary of Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/headlines.html?symbol=MRO ) on 4/2011.
Both of these are 50% deals and they received some cash but not as much as in
the HilCorp deal.

Cash reserves will be tight going forward.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------

They have to pay for their proportion of expenses in their JV deals (15% w/
HillCorp & 50% w/ Marathon) as well as 100% for their company owned operations.
Hopefully, the added BOPD production from 2011/2012 will generate the necessary
cash flow to operate their company owned wells and have enough left over to
complete one or two additional wells each year. It cost about $3M to complete a
retrofit fracking well which is primarily their expertise. They take old non
producing wells and use the new fracking technology to make them productive
again.

It's still a speculation.

My preference is Cummins Inc. (CMI). PE is similar to PCAR but CMI's debt

JV with NV for their diesel engines.

What do you know about any German (or European) made diesel engine companies
that sell world wide? I own a VW TDI diesel and the engine was made by some
Italian engine manufacturer. I do know that many of the next generation diesel
engines meet the new US EPA standards and w/ their durability and high fuel
mileage may sell well in the US and other parts of the World (ie China). I am
not too sure, if any of these European engine manufactures make a heavy duty
(or even medium size truck) diesel that competes with the CMI lines. The
European car diesels are quite good much better than anything currently made in
the U.S.. In fact Jeep stopped production of their SUV diesel because it was so
bad.

My partner is a large HD dealer Mack/Kenworth and Volvo.

Natural gas engines will come ,but all OEM's are going to use their own design.

This eliminates aftermarket parts sales down the road.

Used to be you could buy Detroit Diesel or Cat or Cummins in a PCAR chassis or
other.

Mack always had exclusive parts and they had better fixed absorbtion.

Emissions in Europe are ahead of USA for diesel.They have had DEF Diesel
Exhaust Fluid for several years.

It injects Urea (nitrogen) before the convertor and rather than NOX it creates
water.

Brilliant design and renders diesels soot free (frome a diesel particulate
filter) and NOX free from DEF.

Europe has developed diesels before the USA ,because gas is more expensive in
Euro land.

FWIW

Pcar has both Kenworth and Peterbuilt in the USA and domestic dealers do quite
a lot of export for OIL exploration.

Doubt natural gas rigs would be anything but Domestic due to infrastructure.

reno4 - I have looked at airline stocks somewhat. I sort of tracked LCC a bit
since they don't hedge fuel, which means that they immediately benefit if fuel
prices go down, as they are doing now.

Both UAL and LCC trade at very low EBITDA/EV multiples (~3x) so they are cheap
by that measure, but of course most of the cash flow (if trhey generate enough)
will go towards upgrading their aging fleet (I think UAL is actually worse in
that respect than LCC). Both UAL and LCC trade sort of like options, with the
expiration date being the next bankruptcy.

ALK may be the better pick, they have very little net debt, trades at a 2.6
EBITDA/EV and does not have to deal with unions, I believe.

re CMI, PCAR - don't you think that the trend would go from modular design
(where you can choose your own engine for the truck chasis) to an integrated
design? the modular design is unique to the USA, as far as I know. For better
performance (gear, chasis, load) and integrated design would be better, imo,
which would leave engine only suppliers in the cold (or they get bought out).

I laughed at the story from decades ago, when Mercedes/Daimler bought
Freightliner and did not understand why anybody would choose a truck engine
from a different manufacturer. I think they got their ass kicked until they
realised that things work differently in the US.

Still, I think performance requires tight integration and I believe that this
will do away with the "Choose your own engine" a la carte menu when purchasing
trucks eventually.

SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU)

You get the dividend too. I considering another buy but want to see if I can
get a bit lower. I bought some shares last week at $7.17/share. I have some
higher priced shares that I would sell in 31 days after my next Buy.

I did buy some SeaCube Container Leasing Ltd. (BOX) yesterday around
$11.50/share. Dividend yield over 8%. PE is low at 7, Forward PE at 5.9. The
company does carry a lot of debt but this is the nature of their business. FCF
is pretty good.

I was trying to add a few shares to my Abraxas Petroleum Corp. (AXAS) but never
got my fill at my price. I want this batch below $3.00/share.

I am setting up the account for end of year tax loss harvesting. This year
since I missed selling some positions at their high, now at 52wk lows, I plan
to double up on shares I need to sell, wait 31 days, sell my high priced shares
and leave w/ my booked loss but the same equity position but w/ a lower cost
basis. SVU fits into this category.

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: UVIC, GST-A, IDCC, GLW,
MHR-C/D, EGY, GILD, ARY, COPJF, DRAGF, MSFT. Changes in top-10: Out: CSR,
NRF-A/B - sold all, UFPT - price drop. In: ARY, GLW - bought more

New positions: COP, NICK, TSRA, MGDDY, IGK, AEF, CTEL, CMI, AAPL
Positions increased: RE, GLW, ENTR, DSX, ARY, MHR-C/D, GST-A, GRVY, INTC,
DRAGF, SNDK, AGXKF
Positions reduced: IDCC
Positions eliminated: CSR, NFR-A/B, ELD
Flip-flop: None

Big market drop and volatility has led to a lot of purchases in my portfolio.
Though sales size-wise were also big, they were more concentrated and had more
market-independent reasons.

Fixed income portfolio looks very different from last time. I decided that I am
not comfortable with the income and balance sheet games NRF plays and I
liquidated my position in NRF-prefs. Should have done it earlier, but luck does
not always shine. I received OKish prices and even some dividend. I replaced
most of the NRF positions with a combination of ARY, AEF, IGK, GST-A and
MHR-C/D. Quite possibly I should have flip-flopped out of AEF and IGK on their
bounce to 24.X. Might do this if they approach the price again. Today's drop
was a great time to add MHR-C/D. Unfortunately, I have also added at higher
prices.
I also sold small ELD position since I was not sure where it will go in current
market environment. This was pretty much a wash with some income earned in the
meantime.

On equity side, CSR and IDCC continued to be two big sales. Now I am out of CSR
and I have substantially reduced IDCC position yet again. It might be good idea
to get rid of IDCC totally now that GOOG is out of the takeover play, but I
have not done it yet.

On the buy side, I must say that so far all the buys were mistakes. ;) Of
course, this is exactly what long investor feels in a bear market: the fear
that all their investments were mistakes and will never go up. So usually they
sell at break even or at the bottom. Anyway, coming back to my mistakes, the
biggest ones are probably additions of DSX and ENTR. DSX business sucks right
now. ENTR itself is unclear whether their business will recover. The other
mistakes are:
COP - mediocre supermajor, might not go up as much as small E/Ps even if oil
recovers
NICK - consumer finance company that will suffer in recession
TSRA - another patent company, yet GOOG is not going to buy it
MGDDY - Euro and France are doomed as we all know
CTEL - HK people want Internetz for free, the business is doomed
CMI - like Clownbuck says, every truck manufacturer will use their own engines
AAPL - Steve Jobs will die and AAPL is too expensive anyway
RE - buying reinsurance company with another hurricane coming...
GLW - big TVs in a recession???
GRVY - Ragnarok 2 is delayed again
INTC - NVDA, AMD, QCOM and ARMH will eat them
DRAGF - why would Europe need oil and gas when they are going to down the
drain?
SNDK - commodity business and nobody's buying flash memory
AGXKF - junior gold producer during gold top

Oh well, I hope you guys have better ideas than I do. :)

Hi clownbuck,

The HD truck business is all about fixed absorption covering all of the
dealerships overhead.

Truck sales are so cyclical - at times you starve - so service and in
particular parts are huge.

This is why as you say the integrated approach is what PCAR is striving for.

They don't want cheap knock off parts hurting 50% margins on big parts sales
revenue.

They want to retain exclusivity amongst their less than 100 dealers nation
wide.

I pulled the trigger on a bit more SVU. Hopefully they have hit their low on
today's low volume. Citicorp came out with a down grade and a $8.00/share price
target. SYSCO the food company was rumored to looking at SVU's wholesale
distribution business. I have that division valued between $2.00 - $3.00 per
share. Don't think they will sell but it could be spun off to shareholders as a
separate company (once overall SVU debt is paid down to a manageable level). I
see the two pieces worth more separately than at the bundled $6.80/share price.

Cleaned house on harvesting some losses on MHRpD with a small sell and an
equivalent Buy in GSTpA. The yield on the GSTpA is 11.1%. I will hold for at
least 31 days and if I can reenter the MHRpD at a lower price than $43.00/share
then I will stay with GST. I own common shares in both MHR and GST. I am
satisfied with the GST preferred shares more so than buying anymore of the
common.

The Utility pipeline companies continue to perform well especially those that
have a high yield. AGL is holding fine. Unfortunately, the many I sold have not
fallen back to buy zones including : UGI, LG, NI. I see a big bonanza in these
pipelines as there is the need to move Oil & Gas from all of the new shale
wells to the Gulf for processing and/or shipment to Europe. There was some
discussion that rail is an alternative w/ only a $6/barrel premium to get the
oil to the coast. Maybe will investigate the rails for an entry point as they
continue to grow even with a slow economy. I sold my tank car leasing company
(GMT) but I think I prefer the rail companies since it includes coal and grain
commodities which are actually growing in transport volume.

Both SEP and TCLP own the interstate pipelines that should see growth from the
boom in shale gas. I missed buying TCLP below $40/share so, that one is still
high on my list.

I was lucky to pick up Buys on MDU at $18.87 earlier this month but only got
1/2 of my original order. Right now it is money management for me, harvesting
losses and picking up a value buy here and there. Fortunately, I have a lot of
gains booked earlier this year that I would like to off set by losses. If I can
net that out to zero and reduce my overall cost basis w/ new value buys, the
portfolio should be set up well for next year.

I have read a lot about how the financials are such bargains etc. Rethinking
this, I would submit that banking has changed a whole lot. It used to be you
bought a bank stock you were supporting your local community, getting a decent
dividend to boot and as the community grew so would the bank and the value of
your stock. later on as banks become larger they became like growth stocks
expanding into new areas. Now we are left with mature turn around situations
where there is no dividend no assurance when the dividend will be reinstated
and no assurance of return of capital either. So under what circumstances do I
want to be a shareholder as opposed to being a bondholder? I really think the
game has changed. The big banks have turned into highly speculative ventures
and i just dont see how the small investor will ever get rewarded. I would
rather put my money into bdcs that return most of their profits to
shareholders. I think it will be more difficult for banks to raise equity going

re HIG and life insurers. I looked into this sector quite a bit. As I mentioned
before - i have a few concerns, some general and some specific to HIG.

1) I know that HIG came under pressure in 2008/2009 because of equity based
annuity with a guaranteed payout floor. This become very problematic when the
equity indices went down a lot and of course HIG did not have adequately hedged
themselves, so they were on the hook with annuities sold before. I also know is
that the have increased their hedges but i am not sure it is sufficient - or if
they just got lucky that equity indices recovered before this become a problem.

2) the book value in most US based lifeinsurers is of low quality as I see it.
For example HIG has a 21B$ book value but on the asset side they have 9.5B$
deferred acquisition costs (which means basically that they activate the cost
of the sales commission for life insurance contracts - in some cases the
deferred acquisition cost exceeds the even the sales commission basically
claiming that once a insurance is sold it is worth more than the cost to sell
it!). this is very aggressive accounting (accrual accounting) and I also
noticed that comparable insurance companies in Europe do not seem to have as
much deferred acquisition cost as a percentage of equity (more typical <20% of
equity). MET (which is seen as a gold standard for US life insurers) has the
same issue - almost - the deferred acquisition asset is equivalent to almost
50% of the equity.

3) Extended low interest rates could be a big problem. The basic issue is that
they have some contracts that have a minimum implied return that may be higher
than what can be achieved using low risk bonds in the future. This was a big
problem for life insurers in Japan when interest rates went to zero - some
apparently went belly up because of this. I looked for disclaimers and it seems
that 2011 is not a problem but MET for example states that it could be a
problem in the future. I do not know how to quantify this issue - I think there
is a chance that this will become a huge issue in 2012 if indeed Bernanke
states that the interest rates stay close to zero for an extended time. How is
an life insurer going to get any return in such and environment unless they
decide to go into equities (which is risky given their leverage).

Anyways those are my thought, I don't claim to have specific knowledge.

HIG. Yes, I wonder too how insurance companies are going to pay out on their
annuities when government bond rates are so low. They will have to stretch
and/or be diversified in the assets they hold (which I assume they are), and
maybe not be so dependent on their annuity business.

HIG: Take the $9.5B out of assets, so the bv becomes $21-$9.5 = $11.5B. That's
still $25.8/sh vs. share price about $17. Still a favorable p/bk in my view for
a small bet.

Re: Seaboard Corp. (SEB)

Hi Paul - I am still making my way through their latest annual 10K. I was
trying to see how their different divisions have performed over the last few
years and in particular was seeing if any one division accounted for extra
ordinary profits (from historical years). A few items caught my attention and I
have held off on starting a position.

First, they paid an extra ordinary one time dividend of $6.00/share and
management stated that no other extra dividend would be made until after 2012.
No big deal but no rush for me to enter if it is dividends I want. For SEB it's
small.

Second, they were planning on some significant 2011-2012 Capex investments in
their shipping division. I am not interested in buying another shipping company
and their shipping unit makes up a large portion of the company (and use of
funds) perhaps 30%. The new Ship financing for 2012 was a pretty big deal and I
needed to look into that before I felt comfortable investing.

I really like their pork and Turkey operations. In fact, they have built a
state of the art bio diesel plant that takes the effluent from the pig
operation as input for the bio diesel plant. I believe this is at their
Colorado facility and is a test bed for future bio diesel plants at their other
feed stock operations. Don't know what the capital costs will be and if they
will have sufficient funds to finance these plants from cash flow. They
recently invested $150M in the privately owned ButterBall Turkey operation. I
think it was for a 50% ownership interest.

The company uses very little debt to expand their operation(s) and do have
lines of credit but are short term in nature. The new ship financing (which
needs to be done) is a big deal IMO. I guess it could be looked at as a
positive since interest rates are historically low and probably a good time to
look at putting the division into a debt leveraged position.

The shipping operation is integrated w/ their milling facilities and up to 50%
of their shipping revenues are from their own internal transport requirements.

Their 10K is very long (over 50 pages w/ no pictures) and I may have made it
through the first 15 pages. I like everything I see so far except for the size
and capital impairments needs of their shipping arm. However, it looks like it
plays an integral part in their world wide milling and sugar cane operations.
So, their shipping division helps build value in these other low margin high
volume operations.

<u>Other food for thought:</u>

SEB sold all of their domestic (U.S.) milling facilities to privately owned
Cargill in the 1980's. This was where the family (the grandfather and father)
originally built the business.

In 1991, SEB started a very successful salmon & shrimp growing operation which
was later sold to Marine Harvest in the late 1990's.

The company is very successful in growing their milling and food businesses
world wide. They recently invested in a fairly large sugar cane milling
facility in South America. They are building a very profitable integrated Pork
business and working at adding Turkey production too.

Like you stated, there is and has been a growing increase in BV but when they
sell an operation (like the fish business) and buy into another (like a new
mill operation or Turkey business), BV could change substantially depending on
how they do the accounting. 

Finally, because SEB has so few shares 1.2M, the stock is thinly traded and
probably is one that s/b held for 5 years or more to realize the long term
value. This looks like a perfect Buffet company as it is still family operated
(the son is CEO) and continues to grow it's core operations.

It does not matter for how much BAC can borrow short term debt. What BAC needs
is the confidence of their customers that they are going to be around,
otherwise the stock price deflation can quickly become a real issue in their
business dealings. The main asset of any financial company confidence - if
their customers loose confidence in BAC, they are dead in 24h.

Confidence is what WEB provides to BAC, in exchange for a yield premium on the
5B$ in equity (preferred count as equity for regulatory purposes). From the
strictly financial perspective, this deal is of course dilutive for
shareholders, but this is not strictly a financial perspective. The advantage
of WEB is he is a loan shark that is perceived as a "good guy" and well
meaning.. All the more reason to buy Brk.b stock, imo. I believe this is
actually a win-win situation even for BAC shareholders too.

Anyone looking at AMAT (I am, this would be re-entering, have traded several
times). 3% div. yield, goes ex 8/29. Reversion to mean play in the mega cap
space.

I also think WEB investing in BAC is good for the shareholders. I like this
blogs analysis http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/ . I purchased some 2013 call
options al la Greenblatt purchase of Wells Fargo options described in his book
You Can Be a Stock Market Genius. I have a good feeling about this because
following Buffett into Wells Fargo was my first stock purchase (Greenblatt
bought the options at this time but hadn't written his book yet). I wanted to
buy Brk but couldn't afford it as a student. I have been hooked on stocks ever
since:)

RE: SINO-FOREST CORP (FG (SNOFF.PK)

Stock off more than 60%. CEO and other board members asked to step down.
Misrepresentation by management regarding their hard assets. A few hedge funds
take big loss. Even the big boys get misled after their do diligence failed
them.

AMAT. Held it for a year, sold yesterday. I should have traded it as you did,
or at least traded out of it when stock was up. I guess this one has to be
followed closely because its business and stock are cyclical. AMAT does seem to
me to be a value stock at this point. I'll have to consider that if I reenter,
I'll have to be watching it more closely than I otherwise would have expected.
Meanwhile, my preference is for stocks now where I believe earnings will be up
in next six months. (That doesn't seem to be AMAT, given management's current
outlook.)

Well, I had my share of Chinese RTO crashes and delistings this year, but so
far I am a bit ahead of -21% where Paulson was... He has a hard job with 35B
assets and couple B of continuous redemptions though. :)

OT: I'm in Brussels for a week. Gonna go demonstrate at Euro parliament. "Fluck
the Euro!" :)

I flew through Dublin. The press is somewhat positive that Ireland will recover
as compared to Greece/etc. Irish agricos are doing well presumably. RE is still
in shithole though, resales at <400k for 1.2M bubble houses. Aer Lingus service
was great, partially because I got an exit seat with tons of legroom. :)
