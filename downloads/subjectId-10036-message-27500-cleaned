I have been a net seller Wednsday and Thursday. Sold my 0004.HK (Wharf
Holding), CSCO, some USB in my taxable portfolio for a tax loss, most of my
oversized position in PVD and some others.

Today i went on a small buying binge:

More NVS, rounded up my ADVNA and NBR position and 1/2 positions in HPT and
COV.

You mentioned a while ago that you sold your position in COV because you do not
the the value proposition. from my perspective it looks as follows:

490M shares @40$ = 19.6B$ market cap
4.4B$ net debt, so total EV: 24B$
10B$ revenue, 2.1B$ pretax profit
0.9B$ FCF

In terms of EV/Sales and other metrics COV appears to be the cheapest medical
equipment company around (compare with BAX which has a very comparable size).
of course the problem with the lackluster growth (5% this year) and low R+D
expenditure 92.75 of revenue - half it's peers). COV has to invest and they
clearly state so. Profits will be under pressure as expenditure ramp up,
however I dare to guess that they are in a good field and there are many deep
pocketed companies that want to expand into medical equipment: Philips,
Siemens, GE and others that have deep pockets. My guess is they could easily
pay 60$/share and strucuture a non-dilutive deal (would be 15x operating
earnings)

Van Den Berg's purchases in their clients' accounts are buy-and-hold, typically
with 3-5 year or longer horizons.

They are bullish on large-cap "Dow" type stocks over the next several years.
WPL's investment portfolio shares a similar strategy of buying and holding
undervalued blue chip stocks.

It's a leverage play. They expect WPL's portfolio to do well over the next
several years. As the client portfolios appreciate in value management fees
will increase, and they expect the PE to rise as earnings accelerate. By
holding WPL shares they can get a multiple on the overall market advance.
Assuming the market cooperates, that is.

In any event, that ~25% of outstanding they hold is pretty much out of the
float for the next several years, absent a change in strategy.

Your comments on AHM were very prescient.

Do you have an opinion on RAS. I think the conventional wisdom (which may also
be the correct wisdom in this case) is to run away from everything mortgage
related especially when debt is much greater than equity?

I think what you meant about BWEL when you said it was liquid is that there is
normally a bid for 100 shares at just a percent or two below the last sale?

I agree that debt to equity might be misleading. Here is what I did for ALL the
homebuilders I knew:

- Took assets at face value
- Discarded any goodwill, mortgages for sale, and other assets. Some of these
may be worth more than zero, so I am conservative. ;)
- Discounted the inventory and land at 20%. This might not be enough, but
without knowing specifics about exact markets and how many houses are there and
where they are, it is very tough to do a better job. I am not willing to do it,
but if someone suggests that I should discount company A inventory at 40%,
while company B should be discounted at 10%, I will gladly plug this into my
model.
- Subtracted all liabilities.

I took the resulting number as my "buy" capitalization. Interestingly, some of
the "buy" numbers did not change much in the last 3 months even with the
write-offs.

I also ran the ratio of buy number to liabilities. This is again not a great
measure - any investor should know that a company with non-zero liabilities can
go bankrupt even if their assets more than cover the debt. But it still tells a
lot, IMHO. In fact it tells that ALL homebuilders could go bankrupt. ;) But
some are closer to it than others. ;)

The result is that MTH was the only one trading at buy value and with quite
high buy/debt rating of .40. MDC is the best capitalized with a rating of .80,
but it is quite far from the buy price. Remaining companies fall in between.
Most of them have buy prices at about half of current capitalizations,
confirming your and others intuition that the bottom may be still far away.

After all is said and done though, most of these companies move in tandem. So
unless the weak ones with ratios of .11-.20 will go bankrupt, buying any of the
remaining ones might lead to the same investment results without doing a lot of
legwork trying to choose the best one. /shrug

I am interested in any comments about my model. :)

Good luck

Im really not having a tough time with it.

I only bought a small amount relative to my overall portfolio and net worth.

I obviously dont understand the leverage they use on a daily basis.

Still, the stock appeared cheap. Their customers, for the most part are decent
credit risks.

The issue I have were the option loans and the negative amortizing loans and so
forth.

Still, I didnt expect this. But, stuff happens in the markets that you dont
expect. Ive learned to expect it.

If AHM goes belly up, Im fairly certain it wont be the last stock I own that
does so.

I have a hard time believing they are going to go belly up.

If they do, someone is going to make out like a bandit because Im pretty
confident that masses of good credit customers are not going to stop paying for
their residences.

It would get pretty crowded under the interstate or whereever they will end up
living.

While I detest those who blame hedge funds & short selling for all their
losses, I believe such parties do have a vested interest in creating fear &

Still, my losses on AHM and/or any stock are my responsibility. I cant fault a

Good access to deal flow via CB Richard Ellis.
Healthly dividend.

I believe the insiders are probably prohibited from buying recently which made
the downturn more dramatic than it otherwise would have been.

If & when they return to buying, and I expect they will, the stock should
rebound.

The only reason Im not buying more is I have a large position in FSP as well as
a number of high yielding ETFs that havent really held up as well as Id hoped

(Im fairly new to income investing, I was a more swing for the fences type, but

ABK. Maybe.

We just don't know the extent of this subprime or other prime mess. ABK has now
written down some of these loans. Perhaps though, that's just for this quarter.
I've no idea if they mark-to-market and what could happen if the market value
continues dropping. Or even if there is a market for these debts. For an
insurer, man, I would expect these guys to better protect themselves from these
risky investments. If they, with all their analysts, couldn't avoid the current
problem, maybe their reach for ever higher earnings has exceeded a prudent
height. Apparently not only are they a holder of these type loans, they are a
writer of such complicated financial instruments. ugh.

The p/bk for ABK is now about 1.15. That is very low indeed for this company.
The company is the dominant player in its business of municipal insurance. In
past, it's been very profitable with earnings increasing about every year for
the past ten (10-yr. S&P chart).

On balance, I say it's worth a small bet. I'm in now as of a few minutes ago.

FSP announced earnings. EPS, FFO & FFO+GOS all below last year for the quarter
and the 6 months. Yet the CEO remains optimistic. (Can we get an independent
psychiatric evaluation ?) LOL

http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/070731/0284643.html

But, at least it appears they are going to buyback stock again.

FSP believes its shares are undervalued and currently intends to resume
repurchases of its common stock from time to time during the remainder of 2007.
The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by FSP's management
based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors and will be made
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stock Repurchase Plan.
Repurchases may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit
shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from
doing so under insider trading laws.

-------------

Another thing that bothers me....when they announce property sales, they dont
give the purchase date. Kind of hard to evaluate their performance on a
property not knowing how long they held it.

On July 16, 2007, we completed the sale of a suburban office property located
in Westford, Massachusetts. Gross proceeds from the sale of the property were
approximately $11.5 million, which resulted in a net gain of approximately $1.9
million. Supplementary Schedule D presents our continuing real estate portfolio
of 27 properties as of June 30, 2007.

I've taken just a very few shares of Freddie Mac (FRE) today.

I'll go on this thesis: The mortgage market is going to get tougher for
borrowers because many non-bank lenders of sub-prime/alt A are going
out-of-business or already are. The bank lenders are now more cautious. That
suggests there will more demand for FRE as an insurance backup. While FRE does
have sub-prime loans, I'm under the impression their lending standards have
been more strict than the anybody-qualifies/no checking- income loans made by
those firms that are now in trouble.

I suspect there's not much risk of FRE going bk or defaulting. The business and
stock have fluctuated over the years. I'm expecting FRE business will improve
as it steps into the void left by the departing companies, and that the stock,
now about $56, will again hit $65-70 in the next twelve months. (The stock has
touched $65 or greater at some point in each of the past nine years.) There's a
3.5% dividend yield now, and the dividend seems to get raised every year.

All jmo. I have been wrong many, many times -- especially in the last few weeks
as my stocks have fallen. So, just a few share buy for me now. I'll add more
if/as stock drops on no adverse news.

ultimate repository of trash. Since they don't publish financials there is
little worry that bad news will ever leak out. -g-

That said FNM bounced off the 200 day MA today on the reversal so I concur that
long FNM/FRE is a safe bet for now. If they ever do release updated financials
I imagine there would be a bloodbath in FNM. Don't really follow Freddie much.

Hi Paul - That's a good theme on FRE and if it develops as you describe, they
should grow their market share. It's possible that if they eventually decide to
offer a slightly riskier loan product (ie the new Prime Minus), they would be
the best institution to dictate the guidelines and manage the risk. The Federal
Government might even help in providing a segment of these loans with
guarantees if an industry restructuring is necessary. It would all benefit FRE
and it's future growth.

The current sub-prime market developed w/o strick underwriting guidelines. Many
of the companies that are getting hurt now provided their own products that
never were tested through a complete real estate cycle. These non-standard
sub-prime loans were packaged and sold in the third market w/o much
transparency to the buyer. Now they come home to roost.

The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines are the gold standard in
the industry. They underwrite billions of dollars worth of loans that follow
very strick underwriting guidelines. The buyer of these loans knows exactly
what there getting and the historical risk profile associated with the loan
type.

I wonder where most of the future hurt will come from (the customer, other
banks, brokerage industry) if more of the business is consolidated by FRE?

On another footnote, I guess I am beginning to like NYB more as this sub-prime
scare is working itself out. NYB's loan niche is multi family construction
financing that generates high fees at high rates with loans that turn over
frequently. If the bulk of the future sub-prime loans either go away or are
consolidated into an organization like FRE, NYB's product portfolio now becomes
more profitable (at least until new competition arrives). It's certainly
something that will take years to change. Many of these sub-prime banks will
have to downsize their business, leave the market or be bought out at a steep
discount.

The smart investors will look to the new opportunities that occur when fear
hits the street. I think you may be on to something with FRE.

regarding CBF - i think it's a crabshot. roughly 400M$ equity and 1.4B$ debt.
If their loans loose 20% of their value they are toast. Are their loans
healthy? We do not know. Commercial RE as a group is not doing too bad right
now, so i would assume that they are not in the residential mortgage swamp. On
the other hand the risk premiums for almost all riskier loans have been at all
all time low and are going up now, so it seems that the market market value of
their assets would go down somewhat. Also their earnings have been down YoY by
75% 9a mere 5x last quarter). We also have recent management departures, the
recent Wachovia loan restrive loan extension as negatives

I see in their 10Q that they made loans with Loan to value ratios from 67% to
77% which does not sound too bad. From their 10Q it does not sound like a belly
up situation unless there are skeletons in the basement that we do not know
about. i do not see how this company is supposed to make money based on the
interest rate spreads they are earning (1.5-2%) for loans of above average
risk. if that's all they can do they should liquidate, IMO.

But, as you also pointed out, those loans have LTV of 67-77%.

For CBF to lose money, first the borrower would have to be wiped out and then
CBF would own the property at a discount to market value.

So theres really a double margin of safety.

Just 3 months ago they said
"For fiscal year 2007, the Company reaffirms its expectation that it will
generate AFFO per diluted share and diluted GAAP earnings per share of between
$1.10 to $1.20 and $0.86 to $0.96, respectively."

So at $8.05, the stocks trading at 7 times expected AFFO, less than 9 times
expected earnings while yielding 10.43% and trading at about a 37% discount to
book value.

All that and $7+ million of insider buying at higher prices ?

Find me some other stocks with those kind of things going for it. They are my
kind of situations.

Tomorrow could be an interesting trading day for RAS. If they could buy 5
million shares at $11 I think it would be great for the investors in the
company (it looks like they bought 2.7 million plus shares at $27 in the last
quarter- ouch, that hurts even worse than even my recent purchase of RAS-A at
$15). I wouldn't expect the market to give them that opportunity, but given the

CBF, I do not think they'll do 1$/share this year. They earned 5c during the
1st quarter and with credit markets as they are i do not see how they possibly
could make their numbers. because of the above and the loan covenants that have
been discussed before i think the dividend might be cut as well.

I see plenty of bargains in REITS. I own SNH, HPT, HRP, CBL, CLI. They are
doing quite well and show FFO growth of around 5%, earning 6-8% dividends and
trading around 10x FFO (10% cap rates). i have not seen many private deals
below 75 cap rates for good properties recently, so i believe that those REIT's
substantially undervalued by the market. An with those i do not have to worry
about the dividends or bad loans.

Bought back some BMW Vorzug (BMW3) using Interactive Brokers. BMW had a bad
quarter (due to launch costs and high material prices) but their earnings
always are lumpy. Revenues and sales look fine and their earnings projection
for the year looks good. The stock has come down quite a bit and the preferred
even more. BMW3 trades at 35.5$ versus 44$ for the regular shares BMW
(Stammaktie). The difference between BMW3 (519003) and BMW (519000)is the lack
of voting rights for the BMW3, but the BMW3 pay a slightly larger dividend. A
discount of 20% just for voting rights is unusual.

Interactive Brokers worked like a charm. I bought only a small position and my
commission was only 4 Euros, plus 2.5$ for currency exchange. This allows to
cost average cost efficiently even for foreign stocks. Executions was

Whitney Tilson: Not-to-be-missed tips for value hunters [FT]

By Whitney Tilson

Published: May 18 2007 18:25 | Last updated: May 18 2007 18:25

My recent column detailing the 10 investment traps I’ve identified prompted
several readers to ask if I have a comparable list of the opposite – types of
opportunities that are likely to lead to good investment outcomes.

I do, and happily it’s a bit longer than the list of traps. Given that the
first step to successful investing is knowing which ponds to fish in, here are
the 15 most common types of value opportunities I have been able to capitalise
on in my investing career:

? Out-of-favour blue chips. Even the greatest companies encounter problems or
otherwise fall out of favour. We bought McDonald’s a few years ago when it fell
below $13, believing in its assets and that it could return to its former glory
through better management. The shares now trade above $50.

? Turnrounds of broken businesses. It’s difficult to fix a truly broken
business, but when it happens, the returns can be extraordinary. One of my best
investments ever was CKE Restaurants, which engineered a spectacular turnround
at Hardee’s due to its new Thickburger menu. The shares, as low as $3 in 2003,
are now above $20.

? Cyclicals at the bottom of the cycle. Success here usually involves correctly
anticipating when a cyclical industry will rebound, though precision is not
necessary as long as the company has a strong enough balance sheet to weather
the tough times.

? Distressed industries. Our buying auto-systems maker Lear last year below $20
when its prospects were considered most bleak is a successful example of buying
a good company in a distressed industry. Its shares have more than doubled off
their lows.

? Overlooked small-caps. Among the 5,000 or so publicly traded US stocks that
have no analyst coverage are fine businesses that are cheap because no one is
paying attention to them or the stocks are thinly traded. A good example we’ve
owned for years is Weyco Group, which makes Florsheim shoes.

? Fallen growth angels. When high-growth companies slow down, growth and
momentum junkies often sell indiscriminately, which can create great
opportunities for value investors. Just be careful not to anchor on the stock’s
previous price or earnings multiple, which are no longer relevant.

? Growth at a reasonable price. These are also high-quality growth businesses,
but the stocks haven’t fallen. They may not appear cheap on traditional
valuation metrics, but can be excellent investments if the high growth can be
maintained. Starbucks over the years has been a great example.

? Piggybacking on activism. There are select opportunities to invest alongside
experienced activist investors pushing for prudent change. One of our most
profitable investments over the past two years, for example, was following
Pershing Square and Trian Group into Wendy’s International, which has more than
doubled.

? Spin-offs. Many significant stock-price inefficiencies can occur when a
company is spun off. A recent example we currently own is Mueller Water, which
operates largely under Wall Street’s radar and is uniquely positioned to
benefit from needed investment in US water-system infrastructure.

? Post-bankruptcies. There are also many reasons why companies emerging from
bankruptcy can be inefficiently priced, not the least of which is investors’
reticence to back a recent loser. We’ve almost tripled our money in less than
two years owning shoe retailer Footstar, which came out of bankruptcy with a
solid balance sheet and plan for reviving itself.

? Let someone else do the investing. Certain public companies, including
Berkshire Hathaway (which we own), Loews, Leucadia National, Alleghany and
White Mountains Insurance are structured as investment vehicles for proven
value investors. At a reasonable price, it can pay to let these investors do
the heavy lifting for you.

? Free/mispriced option. In these situations, one or more ongoing businesses
justifies the current market price and an investor gets a valuable option – in
the form of a new market opportunity or turnround of a floundering business –
for almost nothing. In Wendy’s, we thought the value of its Tim Hortons
restaurant franchise was worth the entire stock price two years ago, so we were
getting the Wendy’s brand restaurant and franchising business for free.

? Declining cash cow. At the right price – and if management wisely milks the
business and allocates capital – the stock of a declining business can be a
great investment. The shares of Deluxe, the leading check printer that many
investors had abandoned, have tripled over the past year thanks to cost cutting
under a new chief executive.

? Oddball companies. Certain companies have revolutionary business models that
are poorly understood, resulting in cheap stock prices. Classic examples are
Southwest Airlines, Dell and Kinder Morgan.

? Discount to the sum of the parts. Many companies lend themselves to valuing
their different pieces and can be a great buy if the whole is trading at
a sufficient discount to the pieces. We own Tyco because we think the three
companies that will emerge from it in the next few months are worth more than
$40, versus today’s share price below $33.

Good article on HRP:

A High-Dividend REIT With a Kicker
By Emil Lee August 2, 2007
5 Recommendations

With a low share price, high dividend yield, and some unseen upside from
properties in paradise, HRPT Properties Trust (NYSE: HRP) seems to offer
compelling opportunities for Foolish investors.

If a REIT yields more than 7%, it's usually because the company has credit
exposure that makes investors nervous, such as commercial mezzanine loans and B
Notes, or subprime and Alt-A residential mortgages. (We all know there's a lot
to be said about credit exposure these days.)

However, HRPT's biggest tenants in 2006 were the U.S. government,
GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK), and Comcast (Nasdaq: CMCSA). Despite its
high-grade tenants, the REIT's shares trade at $9.80. That's a roughly 39%
tumble from its high, giving the stock an 8% dividend yield. The funds from
operations (FFO) yield is even higher, at 11%, meaning that the company's
making more than enough to cover its dividend.
I was perplexed by HRPT's valuation, so I recently spoke with its manager of
investor relations, Tim Bonang, and his analyst, Katie Johnston, to try to
understand what the heck is going on. Here's the breakdown.

Company snapshot
HRPT is a REIT that owns and leases about $5.8 billion and 60 million square
feet worth of office and industrial properties, with a focus on government and
medical office buildings. The company's property is located in 34 states and
Washington, D.C.

Comparables
Although Tim noted that HRPT operates in many different and diverse markets, so
do most such companies. Rival office REITs include Brandywine (NYSE: BRT),
Mack-Cali (NYSE: CLI), SL Green (NYSE: SLG), and Maguire (NYSE: MPG).
Examining the forward FFO multiples for that peer group, I find that these
firms trade anywhere between eight to 16 times 2007 estimated FFO, compared to
nine times trailing FFO for HRPT. The company doesn't give forward guidance, so
I couldn't do an apples-to-apples comparison. But based on its low historical
multiple, we can safely assume that its forward multiple will be even lower.
Why is HRPT valued so cheaply, compared to its peers?

An eye toward the long term
Tim noted that HRPT doesn't buy and flip its properties, instead holding onto
them to produce income. As a result, the company doesn't report a lot of gains
on sale, and its long-term approach probably doesn't excite investors hoping
for a quick buyout.

In addition, HRPT's properties aren't marked to market. Instead, REITs take
depreciation charges against the carrying value of their properties. HRPT is
currently trading at roughly book value, which includes roughly $700 million of
accumulated depreciation. Over time, real estate tends to increase, not
decrease, in value; in 2006, HRPT sold five buildings for 30% more than
historical cost. So it's reasonable to assume that HRPT's book value could be
quite understated.

Whereas the aforementioned points are generally true of most REITS, the key
difference is that investors give other REITs much more credit for having
intrinsic values that exceed their book values.

Company Share Price Book Value Premium/Discount
Mack-Cali 39.04 21.39 82%
SL Green 120.73 54.44 122%
Maguire 26.45 8.86 199%
HRPT 9.48 8.96 6%

Running a tight ship
HRPT actually has no employees, instead contracting out management of the REIT
to Reit Management and Research (RMR). RMR also runs other REITs, including
Senior Housing Properties (NYSE: SNH) and Hospitality Properties Trust (NYSE:
HPT). Although some investors may fear that RMR's attention is spread too
thinly, through the end of 2006, HRPT had appreciated 12.2% annually since
inception on a total return basis.

The corporate structure also means that expenses can be leveraged quite nicely.
HRPT's G&A expenses consume only about 4% of rental income; Tim noted that the
company's peers spend 6% to 7% on average. Sarbanes-Oxley costs and other
expenses, which might run $750,000 for a company, only cost REITs in general
about $250,000, thanks to this ability to leverage G&A costs. Nice.

Island treasure
Lastly, HRPT has a nice catalyst buried in its balance sheet. The company owns
18 million square feet of industrial land in Oahu, Hawaii. Thanks to
development and the passage of time, that land in Oahu has appreciated in value
over the past couple of years, and Tim mentioned that rent renewal rates have
increased between 50%-80%. Although it will take a while for leases to expire
and rent increases to roll through the income statement, the Oahu property does
seem like a very nice driver for future growth.

The bottom line
HRPT has a very nice collection of high-credit-quality tenants, a very
efficient cost structure, at least one hidden asset, and a steady 8% dividend
yield. Seems like a decent opportunity to me.

HRPT. And then there's other ( negative)view of HRPT mentioned at the bottom of
that article:

"Our Motley Fool Income Investor advisor James Early has a different point of
view on HRPT, recently advising subscribers to sell shares of the now-former
recommendation. Find out why by signing up for a free 30-day trial.
GlaxoSmithKline is a current Motley Fool Income Investor recommendation."

And, as I find irritatingly typical of Motley Fool's writers, after his very,
very positive viewpoint does the author actually have any money in the stock?
Heck no!

"Fool contributor Emil Lee is an analyst and a disciple of value investing. He
doesn't own shares in any of the companies mentioned (in his article)."

I have the feeling these fools are all twenty-something's with more brains than
money. Sometimes with as much brains as money, i.e. none. -g-.
Maybe they're mostly English majors a couple years out after graduation. I wish
Tom Fool and the brother would pay their writers a decent wage so the authors
(like Emil Lee who here claims to be a "disciple of value investing") could
actually afford to invest in the stocks they seem to like so much in their
articles. Or maybe these writers are all like lawyers: they're trained to take
either side of any argument. Whoever pays them, that's the side they'll
advocate. Will they invest in the stocks themselves on their positive write ups
of them? Well, that's a big "likely not".

end fund. This fund used to be trading at 10%+ discounts for quite some time,

RIT. That's right about the nav discount. From the graph on the link I gave, I
see that both nav and RIT price have fallen. I'm guessing if nav falls further
RIT price will not. That's because RIT's high annualized div. yield, now $2.28
annualized on an $18.58 share price, already promises a yield over 12%. That
should or could put a floor on how much further the stock price might drop. A
floor unless we see some bad news coming out from RIT with its reit holdings or
money management.
Legg Mason took over this fund (RIT) when they bought Citi funds. They changed
RIT distribution to what I believe they believe is a more stable monthly
dividend. I hope it will not decease, and so I'm hoping/expecting the $2.28
number to hold.

If the underlying reits that RIT has do turn up, I expect RIT share price will
rise too. Lagging up though, because I figure RIT stock will again drop to a
more normal discount to any newly improved nav. And if RIT doesn't move up,
that's okay with me too - I tell myself-g-, because if RIT just stays where it
is, I'm getting or expecting to get, a 12% return on my money at this buy in.
(And some of that will be return of capital, for less immediate tax consequence
(as a USA taxpayer).)

Hi Madharry - I have been monitoring RAS perhaps for a speculative buy. It
appears that RAS may have quite a bit of this sub-prime debit in the form of
tranches and special equity holdings from marginal home builders.

The Street.com provided a good overview on RAS's recent earnings call and even
they were unable to quantify the extent of RAS's holdings and special entity
deals.

RAIT Fails to Shed Light on Debt Deals
http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/newsanalysis/banking/10372065.html?cm_ven=YAHOO
cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA

From the article:"...The worries about some of these CDO deals are that they
are just a mix of a lot of risky debt. As skeptics say: It's similar to putting
horse dung and other garbage into a grinder to make some sausage.

Technically, a BBB tranche is considered investment grade. But that doesn't
mean there isn't a lot of questionable debt underlying that tranche...."

I may nibble at a few shares towards the close for a very speculative one or
two day trade. The question is what is the "real" value of the debt RAS now
holds and do they hold a leveraged position of additional debt that they have
yet to sell and at what discount.

This stock could go much lower on the uncertainty of their portfolio debt.
There may be a "value" play here as the market typically over reacts but at
what price?

P.S. I have an order to buy some WM if it can crack $33.50 (a multi year low)
and then buy a few shares of RAS to complement my speculative urge.

Bought some WM to add to my current shares purchased 18 month's ago. As long as

next week and will sell some August $10.00 covered calls if they are still
offered. Who knows, maybe some more bad news over the weekend and the stock

This is just silly. I bought RAS when it had a dividend yield of 14%. Now it's
at 35%, with a p/e of 5.3 and positive earnings growth. Why wouldn't everybody
want a stock with those numbers?

(This is how I keep my spirits up: the size of my portfolio may be going down,
but my dividend yield percentages are way up! Yay!)

I generally avoid real estate-related investments because I live in a
counter-cyclical place and don't have a good feel for the situation on the
ground, but my understanding is that the real estate market is still reasonably
solid, so I can't see how this panic, with people running from any investment
which has "mortgage" or "real estate" in its name, makes any sense.

I did not follow HW in 2005. Looking back, revenues and earnings almost doubled
for couple years leading to 2005. From what I remember Fools had it as a great
(alternative?) energy play and of course all energy (and alternative energy)
stocks ran up then.

The case is pure valuation plus rather interesting initiatives. The company has
had over 20% ROE for the last 5 years. Now ROE dropped to ~13. It might
recover, but even if we get 13 ROE going forward, the stock is hugely
undervalued with 20% expected annual return. If it manages to go back to 15 or
20%, it would be huge. Now it is being pushed lower for housing material
business and maybe for the earnings from tax credit legislation that is
expiring. Are these two things a big issue? I don't think so, but I may be
wrong. :)

For me it seems that HW is a innovative company looking and finding new ways to
play in the energy and alternative energy fields with low valuation. :)

Because, if you look at the balance sheet, it may have no tangible book value
if sufficient amount (20%) of its "investments" are bad loans. Which may mean
that it might just go "poof" bankrupt. :/ And BTW, even if the company is not
technically worthless, it still may go bankrupt if the creditors come calling
loud enough.

This does not mean though that it HAS to go bankrupt. It may be fine and then,
yes, it may be a great investment at this price.

The same thing applies to the homebuilders. Most of them are fine if the
inventory is only 20% overvalued. But what if it is still overvalued by 30-40%?
Same thing.

Disclosure: no position in RAS and won't buy one, I don't understand these kind
of companies anyway. Position in ITB and MTH which I may or may not increase as
prices change.

My limit for panic investing into yields is usually at about 18% max. By then
those who want out are gone, and the value players who want in and have studied
the situation, will have taken on the bet for the dividend and later stock
recovery.

At a 35% dividend there's essentially not enough people who believe that either
the company can turn itself around or that the dividend is sustainable. I just
don't recall any companies with such high dividend yields ever turning around.
My memory could be faulty, or RAS could be an exception.

I just figure I've lost enough, and nobody - afaik - can say or is saying just
how safe or toxic RAS's business is. I note that the d/e ratio of RAS is about
7.6/1. There's a multiplier affect there if some of that debt - like only 15%
is toxic.

All jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times. Certainly with RAS.

I'll try to stick with RSO. That reit also exceeds my 18% limit. Here though
you have acknowledged value investor Leon Cooperman as a director and he is
buying. And the company has announced a buy-back as well.

my understanding is that the real estate market is still reasonably solid, so I
can't see how this panic, with people running from any investment which has
"mortgage" or "real estate" in its name, makes any sense.

The real estate market only works when buyers can sell their existing homes
and/or get financing for newer homes (or first homes). Right now, the buyers
are already drying up due to overbuilding and a price bubble, and the lending
side of the operation is choking because the people who buy the loans that make
lending possible stopped buying those loans.

And when the loan buying stops, the people left holding the loans have no idea
what they are worth in the credit markets. Which leads to the panic, chaos and
confusion we saw on Wall Street the last few days.

It's all very far from reasonably solid until the various securities reprice
and find real buyers, allowing the money flow and buying flow to resume. It
won't affect all areas but nationally, it has scared the living crap out of the
money guys in New York. Already some mortgage companies have raised rates and
standards, and cut out the iffy toxic loans.

That alone will impact home sales going forward.

High & Low Finance
Without Cash, Instant Profits Were No Help
By FLOYD NORRIS
The problem faced by American Home Mortgage Investment in the weeks before it
collapsed was aptly summarized 134 years ago by Walter Bagehot, the English
journalist:

“Every banker,” he wrote in “Lombard Street,” his exploration of the banking
world, “knows that if he has to prove that he is worthy of credit, however good
may be his arguments, in fact his credit is gone.”

So as American Home — a big mortgage lender structured as a real estate
investment trust — faced a crisis, it kept quiet and tried to act as if all was
normal.

For three weeks, it struggled to meet margin calls on its highly leveraged
portfolio of mortgages and mortgage securities, but said nothing to its public
shareholders. To admit that it was having such problems would only have
encouraged other creditors to demand their money.

But hanging over it was the fact that it had promised to pay $30 million in
dividends to common stock holders last Friday, and an additional $3 million in
preferred dividends this past Tuesday. Not big numbers for a company with $20
billion in assets on its books, perhaps, but more than American Home could
raise.

So after 10 p.m. on Friday, it announced that it was delaying payment of the
dividends “in order to preserve liquidity.”

Of course, as Bagehot knew, such a delay assured that any liquidity it might
have possessed would vanish.

It was not until Tuesday afternoon that American Home Mortgage started to come
clean. It was, it said, “currently experiencing a hindering of access to its
traditional credit facilities.” That meant no one wanted to lend it money. It
had “substantial unpaid margin calls.” It would not make at least $750 million
in mortgage loans that it had promised.

Yesterday, the company gave up and said it would make no more loans. “Our
business is no longer viable,” said Michael Strauss, the chief executive. The
common shares are likely to be worthless.

American Home had ranked No. 13 in mortgage lending in America, well behind the
No. 1 lender, Countrywide Financial, which decided last night that it needed to
prove its credit was sound. Countrywide said in a news release that it has
“significant short-term funding liquidity cushions.”

Bagehot would not have been happy to hear Countrywide thought that was
necessary.

At American Home, there had been clues that all was not well.

The company managed to report a first-quarter profit only by changing
accounting policies in a way that allowed it to report profits on sales of
mortgages before it had, in fact, managed to sell them.

It had disclosed that it was borrowing money with shorter maturities than
previously — a possible indication that lenders were getting a little nervous —
and that it had fully drawn down a line of credit intended to finance working
capital needs.

Some of its mortgages were reeling because customers with good credit scores —
not subprime borrowers — were allowed to buy homes with little or no money
down, no proof of income and payment terms that did not even require them to
pay the full amount of interest being accrued. In April, Mr. Strauss promised
that no more such loans would be made.

But, says Zach Gast of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, the
company did not disclose how much of its reported profits came from such
phantom interest payments, even though it was supposed to do so if the amounts
involved were significant.

One lesson that should be learned is the hazard of new accounting rules — like
the one American Home Mortgage used to report a quarterly profit — that allow
companies to report earnings when the market values of their assets rise.

Such market values are what investors need to know, but the rules provide an
invitation for companies to make very generous estimates, particularly if the
company is trying to cover up what it hopes will be a temporary problem.

Some analysts figured out that things were going wrong. Donald Fandetti of
Citigroup put a sell on the stock on April 9, after it disclosed the
first-quarter numbers. That did not, however, stop Citi from acting as the sole
underwriter for the company’s April 30 offering of four million shares, at a
price of $23.10 each.

In connection with that offering, the company made one disclosure that turned
out to be prescient:

The company’s borrowings “are collateralized by the value of our portfolio of
mortgage assets,” it said. “If the value of the assets falls, we could face
margin calls that we are unable to meet, in which case our assets would be
liquidated on unfavorable terms. In such event, we would likely experience
large losses of our equity and sharply reduced income or losses from our
portfolio assets.”

Having given the warning, however, the company was very slow to let on that the
threat had come true. During the three weeks that it was facing margin calls
quietly, 56 million shares traded, and the stock fell from $17.58 to $10.47.

That is more than the 54 million shares outstanding, and an indication that
American Home’s travails were not a secret to all.

It was those who trusted the company and its management who were left holding
the bag.

This is the reason I don't usually invest in financial and highly-leveraged
companies.

I wonder if Countrywide would like to buy back my mortgage for 50 cents of a
dollar. ;) I would be happy to oblige. ;) Maybe I should call them? ;)

Financial and highly-leveraged companies are fine on the upside of the cycle; I
think I added about 15% to my account with NFI years ago and I was out before
it doubled again from there.

But chasing them down in a panic can be very hazardous to your financial
health. While they are crashing, they should depress prices for a lot of
unrelated stocks which will be the best buys once the dust clears.

The wave of foreclosures from the coming ARM resets will compound that problem

I'm not blind to the fact that real estate financers can go belly-up if the
real estate market crashes. In fact I've seen it in person, back in the 1980s
here in Alaska when houses lost about half of their value, people were handing
the keys back to the bank in lieu of foreclosure, and about half the banks in
town failed. But the reason real estate went down so badly, was that the local
economy tanked. Oil prices dropped, with the result that oil companies and
state government sliced jobs, which resulted in a lot of people moving out of
state because they couldn't pay for groceries, let alone the mortgage.

I don't see anything like that happening in the US right now. People still have
jobs, and people very rarely walk away from mortgages unless they absolutely
have to. If the market was a little bit overleveraged, it may come down a bit,
but we're surely not looking at a complete real estate crash.

One company, AHM, tanked. Rather than take that as an indication that the
company was doing something wrong, investors are jumping to the conclusion that
the entire mortgage lending industry is about to crash. I can't see it.

people very rarely walk away from mortgages unless they absolutely have to.

They do if they have an adjustable rate 100% mortgage that is due to go up
dramatically this year and next and they can't pay because their stated income
and assets were a lie. Millions of mortgages like that were made nationwide.
The ultimate fallout from them remains to be seen. It will be more than "a bit"
and less than the end of the world.

The side question is how much economic growth and employment were driven by the
real estate boom.

From WSJ today:

"The fright among investors is forcing lenders to go back to more-conservative
practices that were the norm before the housing boom of the first half of this
decade. Many now are focusing on loans to borrowers who are willing to document
their income, can make a down payment of at least 5% and have a history of
paying bills on time.

Alt-A loans accounted for about 13% of U.S. home loans granted last year,
according to Inside Mortgage Finance, and subprime loans about 20%. Industry
executives have said subprime lending is likely to shrink by more than 50% this
year, and now much of the Alt-A market is vanishing too.

This credit squeeze "will further crimp the effective demand for housing, and
will make the late summer home-sales season even worse than the dismal spring
season," said Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Vienna, Va.

Tom Lamalfa, managing director of Wholesale Access, a mortgage-research firm in
Columbia, Md., expects that half or more of the market for no- and
low-documentation loans will disappear.

Some people use so-called low-doc loans to avoid paper work or because they are
self-employed and have trouble showing a steady stream of income. But low-doc
mortgages also can be used by people exaggerating their incomes."

The scary outlook I envision is two-fold.

First, a lot of the mortgage-originators/packagers/sellers are now gone and
lending standards are getting tougher. And so it's obviously tougher for people
to get a new loan if they are trying to buy a house.

That's not good, but what could be worse, is all the people already in houses
who have to re-finance. How will these people do this if the the
mortgage-originators/packagers/sellers who got them in, are themselves now
gone? There will be others who can and who will step in, I'm sure.
I'm speculating though they'll say something like:

"Okay, we'll refi you, but you have to qualify by our standards -- you will
need to prove your income and your fico score at a certain level. And oh, by
the way, we'll refi you -- at current rate of course - which as you know is
higher than the rate you are now paying---, but we'll refi only for 80% of
appraised value of your home. And we want a current appraisal of its value. So
if your appraised value has dropped to $300k and your note is $290K, we'll
grant you a mortgage for 80% of $300K which is $240K, and of course you will
have to come up somehow with $50K to pay the difference (between the $290K
payoff due now and the $240K).

In the first case, somebody is living somewhere but they can't move to buy a
house because they can't get financing. In the latter case, somebody is or
could be in big trouble if they can't quality and/or can't come up with a bunch
of money pretty quickly.

In either case the housing market sector - the homebuilders, banks, Home
Depot's, etc. suffer. As do we stockholders in such companies.

Looks interesting but a bit speculative in a market that is temporarily fleeing
all risk. [HW]

Do you take the mood of the wild beast that is the market into account at all,
or do you maintain a solid contrarian bent at all times?

But we know the banks and other folks who hold the current mortgages are going
to get very flexible about finding ways to keep people in their homes, just
because the cost and hassle of repo'ing thousands of homes will overwhelm them.

It's an impossible situation for all parties involved. I can't wait to see how
it shakes out and who blinks first.

The banks will just transfer employees who formerly wrote loans to new jobs
which oversee the acquisition and disposal of repossessed property.
The banks becoming flexible to assist people to remain in their homes?
Possibly, but I'm not one who believes bankers will willingly help anybody, in
this down cycle or any other.

Kenneth Kirk. Not satisfied w/my reply to you. I'll amend.

As most adults know, there often are several levels to truth.

I gave you some reasons for selling RAS. I believe it's also because of a
different truth:

I'm selling because of fear. Maybe panic on my part.

I'm concerned the worst isn't over for RAS, for banks, for brokers, and also,
for the market in general. Because unlike what I believe I saw in Feb. '07 and
maybe other downfalls ('03), I don't get the sense that anyone is panicking
this time. Everybody's learned to hold through the declines. Especially
erstwhile value investors who seem to be holding on to positions. Yes the media
gives negative comments on the decline, and the decline affects many. Still, as
I read value threads, there's been no sense of panic or exit. I don't see
people setting stops such that they are being stopped out of positions (those
who use stops), and I don't read of people selling to protect profits or reduce
losses on non-financial stocks. This is different from previous recent drops
imo. Therefore, because so many people are apparently still in the market and
have not sold (yet), for the first time in several years I am worried that
there's a sort of complacency, and that this time, this might be the decline
that goes further than I expect or would be comfortable with.
So I am reducing some of my speculative positions, some of my financial
positions, etc. and looking for stocks that seem clearer to me to have a
margin-of-safety.

Jmo. And I've been wrong many, many times.
