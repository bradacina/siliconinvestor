If it is not too difficult to run these screens I would be interested in seeing
a broader list meeting these criteria:

Cap < 500 million
Debt/Eq < 40%
ROE > 15%
Price/Sales < 0.75X
P/E < 15X
Current Price within 15% of low

The idea is to loosen up on some of the standards to toughen up on the
price/sales (one of my favorites) and to get a larger list.

Normally this would be considered a somewhat commodity business, except for the
convergence of several macro economic trends. First is that the number of
availible has been shrinking since the early eighties and no new rigs were even
built for 6-7 years. This has caused the age of the rig fleet to age and is now
getting old and long in the legs. This requires new rigs to come on line JUST
to keep the # rigs constant. The same is true with the boats except that boats
are easier and less time/money consuming to build.
Secondly technology has increased so that it is easier and more cost effective
to find oil/gas. The success rate for drilled holes is up to ~65% up from the
mid 30's. This makes it more cheap and cost effective to search for oil.
Also worldwide demand for oil has increased dramatically since the early 90's.
This has put a strain on worldwide oil production capacity. For much of the
eighties most wells/companies/countries were pumping below 80% capacity.
Therefore most of the increase in production has come from already
discovered/existing fields. Currently the industry is running at about 97%
capacity. So any meaningful increase in production would have to come from new
wells.
The major oil companies realize this and have now stepped up there exploration
schedule so that several years from now the new fields will be ready to come on
line for the new increase.
So what we have is a smaller number of rigs, more worlwide demand for oil, and
near capacity restraints on current wells. Not to mention the depletion rate of
~2-3% on current supplies. So this creates a long term bullish scenario for
drilling and service companies.
While some people point out that there are several new rigs being built, most
of these are already under contract(except 3 I believe) for 3 or 4 years and
wont be in service until 1999. Also people point out that several
jackup(shallow water) rigs will come up for contract renewal this year in the
Gulf of Mexico. This is true but also realize that a lot of shallow water Gulf
activity is related to natural gas(which hass not been under pressure). One way
to see if there actually has been any drop off in drilling activity is to watch
the earnings reports and 10-k's from Global Marine since they have the largest
turnkey drilling operations and would be the first to notice a fall off in day
rates.
With all that being said, some stocks I like in this sector are FGII, HMAR,
RIG, FLC, and NE.

With regards to MAVK they are a specialty steel tube maker and will feel seom
pressure from cheaper priced Asian imports. PDS is an onshore driller and right
now there is pressure on dayrates on land, but so far nothing offshore.

For more information I suggest reading the strictly drilling thread here on SI
and follow the posts of Big Dog(who works with in the oil business as *rig*
broker so therefore knows what is going on in the front lines) and a few
others.

I have a few questions as well. How would you rank land drilling, vs water
drilling, vs boats in terms of attractiveness? Doesn't increased success rate
decrease need for rigs and is their any play on the (technology?) source of the
improvement? Where do TMAR and Nabors fit in your list of companies? These
companies have come a huge way from when GLM was a "penny" stock - how
confident are you that this is just a brief downturn? P/E's are low but
price/sales are quite high suggesting a lot of room for margin pressure.

I see the other "sneaker", so to speak is falling at NIKE. However, I believe
that the brand has franchise value and if the stock price is materially lower
in a few quarters it might be worth a look. Maybe a bit like McDonald's - there
is a fast food place on every corner, the business is not what it once was, but
"Mickey D's" is still a solid,
valuable franchise.

Their troubles might raise some question marks for how high is high for HYDEA?

HYDEA hasn't had the same problems so far - their backlog is
growing. Together with Adidas, they're the only two publicly
traded athletic shoe firms I know of that have this "problem."

Of course, the entire reason I bought HYDEA was because it
is a proitable net net. For now at least, my goal is just
under $6 in two years. Not that high - that gives it a
PE of about 15 if it can simply maintain its current
earnings. I am currently evaluating HYDEA for an even
longer-term hold based on improving business fundamentals,
but haven't gotten there yet.

OK everyone here goes some answers :)

RE: TMAR,HMAR- TMAR and HMAR have been consolidating the offshore
supply/crew/anchor handling boats in the Gulf and elsewhere around the world.
TMAR has the greatest concentration of its boats in the GOM and therefore is
more susceptible to a fall off in dayrates there. Currently dayrates remain
above last years level at ~8300 a day. However there is some concern abou the
number of new ships destined to come online later in the year. This could put
some downward pressure on rates in the GOM. Elsewhere in the world dayrates
continue to climb and have not come close to the rates commanded in the Gulf.
HMAR on the other hand has its boats spread out around the world and is
therefore shielded somewhat from GOM dayrate pressures. Also HMAR is
consolidating the tugboat/towing industry in the USA. This will help offset any
fluctuations in oilservice dayrates. They also have a patent on a tug that
requires a 2 man crew as opposed to the normal 3 and is also operationally
superior to other tugs.
All that being said, there is still room for more consolidation in the energy
services area for both these companies and the effect of ships coming out of
drydock, aquisitions, and increasing dayrates should bode well for both of
these companies. I personally like HMAR over TMAR, but own both for the long
term.

RE: drilling offshore/onshore

I would rate the drillers this way: Deep water > shallow water/boats > land in
terms of earnings stability and current demand. However that being said the
land drillers have the most potential in terms of appreciation when land rates
turn around since there costs are fixed and any increase goes straight to the
bottom line. This is true for all drillers as well, but land is more suceptible
because the length of contract for a land rig is much shorter than for a deep
water or shallow water rig.
The following is a link to worldwide offshore rig count and utilization rates.
http://www.offshore-data.com/rigcount.html
Main thing to notice is the rig utilization percentages as compared to a year
ago and five years ago. Notice that the worldwide total has fallen about 20
rigs while the utilization rate has increased 15%.

One other event that I forgot to mention is the expiration of leases in the
Gulf of Mexico esp. deep water leases. Its either drill now or loose your
rights to that land. This is keeping the demand high for deepwater rigs.

So here is a breakdown of some stocks and where they are in the scheme of
things.

Deep water: RIG, DO, CDG, FLC, NE
Shallow water: GLM, MDCO
Land Drillers: NBR,GW,PDS
Boats: HMAR,TMAR,TDW
Rig buidling/maintenence:FGII, GIFI, UFAB

If you want to play the land drillers I would go with either GW which has a lot
of exposure to natural gas drilling and NBR who has the deepest onshore
drilling capability.

Has anyone in CA visited a HOMEBASE store?

The stock (HBI-NYSE) was recently featured in a $10 Store article at
theStreet.com. Company has been hurt by direct competition from Home Depot and
by a store remodeling project, but same-store sales at remodeled stores are up
10%. HBI, while relying on its basic building-supplies business, attempts to be
different from HD by emphasizing its decorating business.

Company warned of 9 - 11 cent loss. PSR is just 0.2 on sales of $15B.
Long-term debt is just 10% of total capital. Projected 1998 book is $8/shr.
Trailing PE = 18, projected 1998 PE = 13.

Bob Rodriguez of FPA Capital recently bought 10% of shares and Mike Price of
Mutuel Series is in for 11.4%. (BTW, Rodriguez, like Price, also loves COL,
but, like Price, would prefer to buy it in the low 20s).

Short Analysis for all...

I set up an excel sheet to run through some numbers to determine how
well a company's position is according to some of rules/guidelines
for picking a value stock.

Company: Boundless Tech.
financials: There statement from this March 2nd

Here are the numbers:

Total Assets $54,548,000
Intangible Assets $0
All Liabilities $39,141,000
Stock Issues $0
# Common Shares Out. 514,000
Total Share Holders Equity $15,407,000
Current Assets $34,078,000
Current Liabilities $25,298,000
Inventory $13,682,000
Long-Term Debt $8,000,000
Share Price $0.75
Earnings per Share $0.60
Gross Profit/Loss $2,627,000
Total Sales $26,898,000

Results:

Book Value $29.97
Debt/Equity 2.54
Net Current Asset Value - WC $8,780,000
Net Current Asset per Share $17.08
Current Ratio 1.35
Net Quick Asset Value ($4,902,000)
Quick Ratio 0.81
Net Net 1.02
Net Net Current Assets per Share$1.52
Price/Earnings Ratio 1.25
Profit Margin 9.767%
Intrinsic Value $13

My conclusion is something must be wrong...these numbers look too
good to be true. Besides the Asset Value, with strong forward
momentum with new contracts and partnerships, good management and the
current price...this is something I'd like to drop $5K on and look
back a year from now. Can any one point out what I may be
overlooking.

Numbers look aligned in the text editor...don't know how to enforce the
tabs...sorry.

Well, on the subject of patience and waiting for the price - a
subject about which I have been somewhat stubbornly extreme of late -
let me just relate how I recently lost money by ignoring my
own rules and advice.

I recently purchased Swisher International (SWR), knowing that
inventories were high, that the cigar fad was fading, and that they
would not be able to improve as drastically in the near future as they had in
the recent past. The stock price was down near 52 week lows,
and the valuations all looked in order -~60% ROE and a P/B of
1.2. Insiders had bought at the 14.5 range last year, and I felt
comfortable buying at 15. So I did.

If I had only applied the same logic to this one as I had to Nike.
I failed to notice that all the analysts still had strong buys
on the stock. The day after I bought, the company preannounced -
earnings and revenues would be flat with last year. I think,
we knew this - last year was stellar, and in any case even with
flat earnings the numbers are still great. As the stock opened
the next morning, I noticed it didn't budge. Great. Dodged a bullet.
I patted myself on the back.

No shares traded until the downgrades. Then came the downgrades.
4 X the avg daily volume traded in short order,
and the stock fell over 10% to 13, which is where it stands
now. Since my original position was a partial position, I'll
now convert it to a full position.

I am still comfortable with the stock, and it's a long-term holding -
it's a 137 year old company and I bet it won't be going down the
tubes, but I didn't get the best price despite having all the knowledge
necessary to do so.

Nike has had a bit of a low volume suckers rally here to 47. The
shorts may become the true suckers when Berkshire posts its annual
report this Saturday on its web site - Nike shares would surely
jump on any positive mention. We'll see if I pay for my patience
with Nike, but I am thinking I won't. Patience hasn't hurt me yet.
I'll try to remember that.

Good Investing,
Mike

Hello thread! I just stumbled across this thread, and would like to pose a
challenge to all of you. I don't believe a good valuation model exists. The
ones that I've seen so far ignore what I believe to be the underpinnings of a
rational stock valuation methodology: expected free cash flows, expected
growth, risk, and finally, the discount rate with which to tie it all together.
I've seen heuristics from the various incarnations of Graham and Dodd, along
with PEG and YPEG systems, and frankly, none of them make any mathematical
sense.

Nothing up my sleeves, Paul, honest. I've been trying to come up with a good

some good ideas that will stand up under scrutiny. There is only one sector I
can think of now that is probably a great value play -- the oil service sector
-- but there is no way I could demonstrate it objectively.

Since I have a proclivity for investing in growth stocks I would love to be

Paul/Thread. Would appreciate reference to internet source of insider

conservative investors consider this idea ,sell covered Leaps on low cost stock
which has solid financials, ie should stay in business for a while. I did this
on UIS and KM when stocks were in single digits and earned about 25% on
annualized basis. Currently have HM,ESST and CRUS. Initiated CRUS last week
buying stock at 10 3/16 and selling year 2000/10 calls at 3 3/4 for stock price
of 6 1/2 net of commissions. Researching stock , I believe it is a survivor and
if so the annualized return will be about 28% if stock above 10 on Jan 2000.

Thread: I would appreciate some comment on UCR. The stock was discussed here
last year. Seemed like a couple of knowledgeable owners commented on my concern
about the "non-existent" book value. (And they were right - I was wrong to be
concerned----the stock climbed appreciably.) But that was then.
Today the stock is at a new low - dropped 4+ points (that's about $200M cap
drop based on 45M outstanding shares) because - according to the news I read -
of the "abrupt" (that's my word) retirement of the top two execs. Given that
the industry is being investigated for price fixing -- a smaller competitor
(they're all smaller --- UCR has 70% of the market apparently) paid a $29M
fine, perhaps some of these events are interrelated. In any case, UCR is a
viable (dictionary meaning,= growing) business. My question is, given the
modest pe multiple, consumable and stable (?) nature of the business,
possibility of some large fine ($200M???).... for the long term investor is UCR
nevertheless a buy at today's price?? Paul Senior

And what a tragedy - this man is a brilliant strategist. Without him, I worry
about whether this industry will once again be the brutal commodity business it
was ten years ago. Expect a very large fine from the governement plus a civil
settlement. They have a ton of debt already. Can the balance sheet weather this
kind of abuse? Tough question. There is little margin of safety here. Either
this scandal blows over (we're talking two years though - its pretty bad) and
the stock goes to 50 or 60 based on earnings power, or it files for bankruptcy
and you lose everything.

For the record, I'd buy it though. I'm just getting the issues on the table
here, but it could be a textbook value investment because Wall Street is
terrified. If the balance sheet were normal this would be a no-brainer. But
there is the possibility of "lights out". Also recognize that this puppy has
had three sickening plunges in the last six months as the news got one step
worse. At each stage some very smart value investors (and me) thought they were
"catching the bottom" The huge bounce today (and the sucker bounce three weeks
ago after the second piece of dreadful news) shows that value investors are
starving for anything that smells like value. Be careful to understand all the
risks, but the potential reward may outweigh the risk in my judgement. Be
prepared for the possibility of losing everything though. There is no margin of
safety here.

Ok, it wasn't a no-brainer, but this is: buy it now. This merger
is good news, and once the price started falling from its open,
a lot of panicked investors who couldn't believe their luck sold,
causing it to fall over 4 points from its open. I'm holding this
one for the long term still. I'll get my Southdown shares and hold
those too. S&P has it on credit watch with positive implications,

From:Michael Burry

Paul, I apologize. Yesterday I said buy it now (which
was totally irresponsible), and today I just sold half my position.
The reason: I still like the company and the merger, but I got
carried away. I have a 50% gain in just two months.
A rule I have been toying with is:

When you buy a stock for discount to intrinsic
value, sell 1/2 if the stock gains 50% in less than
a year. If it gains 50% in more than a year, evaluate
for long-term hold/quality of business.

So today, after checking my emotions, I
enforced the rule. I sold half my Pacificare and half
my Medusa. It's hard to do that to my best stocks -both
of which I really like - but that's probably why I should.

I now have money for two more positions - my four stock
portfolio became a six stock portfolio became an 8
stock portfolio then a 10 stock , now a 12? Pretty
soon it'll look like yours.

Again, I apologize for the switch.

Mike - What if you think you originally bought it at 50% of intrinsic value?
Your rule would say to sell half at 75% of intrinsic value.
Would that make sense? Most of the time you would be delighted to buy at 75% of
intrinsic value, which hopefully is steadily increasing.
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:3/19/1998 2:25:00 PM
From:Michael Burry

That's a limitation of the rule. But my logic is

1) It removes my emotion and greed from the sell
2) I should be happy with 50%/year, let alone months
3) I am not selling everthing - I still own half the
number of shares, which is 75% of the original
monetary investment.
4) It reduces the volatility of the portfolio as the
the portfolio becomes less top-heavy.

Personally, I feel very satisfied knowing that I've
got the gain, a loss is unlikely, and there is still
money working in the stock.

BTW, I am really interested in HWP, and am looking to
buy next time it touches 60-61. I see a business at
near fair value, but with a proven history of growth,
a diverse base, judicious use of debt, 20% ROE, and
a stock that has done nothing for about a year. PE is
20, but I would be looking at it as a Buffett-like
long-term hold. Any opinions?

Go-video (AMEX:VCR)

VCR has broken out of its "development stage" to produce profitable
financial results for the last year and a half. However, it continues to
be undervalued by the market, and only carries a PE around 10.
Profits from its core business are growing rapidly, and a stream of very
compatable new products appears likely to maintain this growth into
the future.

As the sole marketer of Dual-Deck VCRs, which incorporate patented
proprietary circuitry and software to perform duplicating, dual
recording, editing, and video view switching functions which cannot
be performed by single deck VCRs, the Company occupies a unique
niche in the consumer electronics market. With the rapid growth of
"Home Theaters", demand has risen for a VCR with these capabilities.
In addition, Go-video has successfully reduced the manufacturing cost
of this equipment so that it has been able to position its product line in
price brackets which have greater consumer appeal. Since the
Company manufactures these VCRs in Asia, it can be expected that its
manufacturing costs in US dollars will continue to decline.

This is a Summary of an in-depth Analysis of VCR which can be
found on the Napeague Web Site at http://www.napeague.com . I
encourage you to read the entire Analysis as well as the Company's
investor relations information and its reports to the Securities &
Exchange Commission prior to making any decision to invest in this
or any other Company.

until at least Spring 1999, but they're backing 1.92 for
fiscal 99 with single digit/teen earnings next quarter.
So we're shooting back to 40-50 cents late this year?
Cost-cutting might get them there, but they've still
got to charge off those inventories and the job cuts
are a tiny fraction of their recent hiring. Didn't
they recently build a world headQ - the sure sign
of a cyclical top? And are we even sure that there is
a Nike/brown shoe cycle?

Mike: re MSA buy/sell

No problem here. It's in these instances that I can move forward a little in
stock picking skills.

So many good ideas and successes on this thread. But seems difficult for a lot
of us (me for sure) to actually buy based on the recommendations posted here.
To me it looks like we all mostly ignore each other's picks. I am trying to
learn to listen (and understand)and actually follow some of the ideas that are
mentioned on the thread - and I am having a hard time of it. I think at some
point I will need to move from living with my indecision with a particular
stock to having some faith and trust in the proposer of the particular stock.
Such with you and MSA. I bought yesterday am. based on your recommendation. I
have more faith in you being right about MSA than I do in my being right that
it's too late for me with MSA. And I followed you again and sold MSA yesterday
(Thur) pm. based on this, your last MSA post. Another day trade for me!

Change of strategy or tactics, rapid responses to surprises in the market,
portfolio adjustments, etc. all are part of the game. Sometimes they occur at
awkward moments. That's okay. Sometimes though ego gets in the way of
acknowledging to oneself that a change is required or desirable. That's not so
okay. (I admire your ability to take a second look at MSA after the initial
enthusiasm created by the merger announcement.) And from my perspective, I
appreciate the word that you've adjusted your thinking. That gave me a chance
to tag along also on the way out. Paul.

Hi Mike, threaders,

My first post on the value thread. I read an article in WSJ sometime in the
last quarter about HWP; my recollection is that 83% of revenues came from
computers. The gist of the article was that the company wants to become more
like GE, with more diverse business lines. I'm suprised to learn that they have
telco test equip market. Near term it may be a better strategy to position my
purchases in small internet test equipment makers that they may acquire; MTST
is the only one that I know; suggestions?

As for NKE, here's a company getting slammed by the Asian recession worse than

Mike,

"Yeah it's all common knowledge, but the market isn't acting like it"

Couldn't agree more. Nothing but bad news and the market just keeps climbing.
Ran thru 146 stocks this week and found seven worth further research. The
companies with potential weren't at a decent buy-in price, the rest not worth
looking at.

Recently reading a survey about "graying of America". A majority of the
respondents indicated that they would be spending large amounts of time on the
internet in retirement. Add projected growth of Third World telecom and the
increased number of internet users this will bring plus normal internet and
networking growth. IMO - Telecom and internet will replace PCs as the big
growth sector in the next few years.

It will be highly competitive but certain companies will do very well. Latest
IBD has an article on the large growth of a Tower construction company due to
wireless comm. It's these niche market companies that will show the largest
growth.

There will be a big battle among software and the various hardware companies
for product acceptance. Be tough to figure out which ones will be dominant. For
investing, I would likely lean prefer the ECMs supplying sector OEMs for the
best potential growth.

Just some input,

I would argue a stock growing at an estimated (reduced) 35% growth rate going
forward with a PE multiple of 10, a price to book
of less than 1.2 is a helluva bargain in a frothy market. This co. just
presented at the Raymond James insitutional conference, and the general
consensus there was the current state of the oil market will have a minimal
impact on this company's prospects. Raymond James has a price target of 40, DLJ
a target of 36. If you only give this stock a 15 multiple on this year's
earnings you get a price of about 39 dollars. I feel the risk/reward is
outstanding.

It says something about the emotional nature of stock-picking
that so many ideas here are generally ignored. Many of us do-it
ourselfers just love homegrown ideas the best. That said, I've
made significant profits off several ideas here, and it is hard
to say what it is that makes me follow up on certain ones and
not others - probably how they are presented.

Ironically, I am horrified that someone actually acted on
something I said and that it turned into a daytrade - eegads
more money to the brokerage industry.
I don't think I've ever used the words
"buy it now" before and I never will again. That said,
I'm not at all down on Medusa - I still have the equivalent
of a 75% initial position in it. But an investor giddy

oil would be in some instances advantageous for the likes of TMAR and HMAR as
one of their relatively significant expenses (oil for their vessels) has
trended significantly downward? Obviously, I will have to investigate what % of

Mike,

Nice timing on Medusa.

Thinking with my fingers--
Medusa and Southdown are very much alike. I really haven't looked at them, but
it appears that the combination will improve Medusa's financial situation. The
two companies are not conflicting in territory so they become basically they
have just joined forces. This doesn't really give them added advantage in
marketing. If they were competing it would be a different story. As I said
before, the trend in the sector is to take out your competition so you can
control the market, close down the low volume operations, minimize overhead
from higher volume, etc. They are both so large already that the overhead
savings isn't much of an issue, they aren't competing so that isn't either.
About all I can see that it will do is make revenues more stable as they have
more operations - shortfall of one operation offset by increases in others.

The market really likes it, but I think it will look at it differently after
they review the situation. I would probably take some profits by reducing my
holdings and look to buy back to full position later.

The combination should outperform the market in the next few years and would be
a good hold.

You have me wrong - I own a stone quarry, mining operation and had a
asphalt/highway/heavy construction company before I started this. Cement is
another area, similar but different. They are covered in the trade magazines I
receive.

re: SWR - cigar and smokeless tobacco co. (also BAB)

re: SWR Positives (as pointed out by Mike B.): very high roe, insider buying,
mutual fund buying, low pe, price near its low, understandable business with,
IMO, some barrier to entry.

Negatives are "tobacco", trendiness of cigars - possibly a "last year's story",
announced flat sales, precursor to subsequent flat or down earnings, stock is
owned by Mike B.**, and not too much history as a public co. Personal negative
is that SWR seems now to be the best value idea I can see--I hope I am not
dragging from the bottom of the barrel.

Neutrals maybe are: co. has been in business many, many years, "correct" bv is
hard (for me) to determine, tobacco co's are coming back as of this day, but
not SWR.

** -gg-. --just joking -- (I'll categorize Mike's purchase as a positive.)
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=3687997

I took on a position today. SWR meets a lot of the profile characteristics I'm
looking for in a value based stock. However, I do not like the business, and I
AM concerned about the trendiness of cigars. The stock's been mentioned here
twice. Absolutely no discussion. Therefore, I assume no interest -- maybe
because everyone thinks as I do..."Geez, not a tobacco stock, Puleez...and
...oh no--not cigars fer cryin' out loud." Well, if it's this ugly and there's
surely no momentum or growthies around... then we may just be near the base low
for the stock (13). That's how I'm betting anyway. ('Course maybe there will be
plenty of interest if the stock drops to 9 or 8 -g-.)

Starting also a very small position in British Airways. Yes, I'm very late to
the party, but BAB should continue to do well over the next couple of years.

which is the worst of the three big cigar cos and is Perelman

fading cigar fad since it's mass market not pure premium. Glad
to see someone else interested. Even my wife hates me for liking
a cigar stock - we talked about it again at dinner. That high
ROE should be halved since it has a D/E of a little over 1, but
even halved it looks good. Last year's story was "yay cigars"
and this year's story is "cigars were last year's story" which
I think of as positive.

To the Count: re. CYMI. Buy now.

My first take is that it can't be evaluated as a value play based on
financials. Numbers - psr, p/bv are still too high. Interwoven with this is a
large cash hoard (good for margin of safety) and sales that look like they've
gone up about 4-5x in a year. Plus some indication on SI that co. has a lock on
mfg. requirements for next gen. of sub. .25u stuff? (If so, very positive and
valuable -- but how to dollarize?) Some odd stuff about CYMI: some bullish
reports saying it's undiscovered. On the other hand, there are over 8000 posts
on it in Yahoo. Great future apparently but also lots of shorting. What do the
shorts know about that supposedly great future?

Here's why YOU should buy now IMHO (and from a kinda/sorta value point): You
say you have spent a lot of time researching this co. You believe it will
double in 2 years from your desired entre purchase point of 15. So you figure
it's going to 30 bucks. Okay.
Stock is selling for $20. At 20 it's going to move up 50 percent (20 to 30) in
two years. Stop fiddle diddling around and buy it now. Take that 25%/yr gain.
You got too much time and brains into CYMI now, not to.

And what are you, a track star -g-?? Why else would you "jump into this with 2

Good morning Paul. It's Saturday morning and time to sit back and begin to

re-examine the very core of my soul. It turns out that the Beardstown Ladies
have been lying to us!

Yeah: Beardstown ladies. They are still teaching us a lot.

Never trusted their numbers. Never. Every time I thought of them, I always
asked myself these questions and in this order:

1. How could these nobodies have a better record than Warren Buffett?

2. How can people who have real lives like these folks - outshine professionals
who spend their entire business lives - and a lot of their personal lives
-picking stocks and who have tons of backup resources and access to info. which
The Ladies don't have? (And that's the whole schtick right... bunch of grey
haired grandmas from nowhere doing so great and compared to the sophisticated
city boys of Wall Street-- anybody can do it, folks.)
(Actually, I have a couple of answers for why they could be so very good: this
per B. Graham which is that in investing - it's the only activity where the
more you do, the more you try, the less good you might do yourself. Or Phil
Carret in "A Money Mind at Ninety": having a money mind is a gift. You've got
it or not. -- I don't like either of these answers -g-.)

3. So how come these ladies aren't rich? Given all that compounding for so
long. Or if they are rich, so how come they don't live like they're rich? (I've
got an answer for that too: Value investors live cheap (Graham and Mike Price
being the only two exceptions that come to mind now)). Or is it because
compounding a couple of thousand bucks at at real good percentage over 14 years
is still not enough to make much of a difference. ($2000 x 1.23**14 = $36,000)
Unless of course you're a folksy, white-haired, grandmotherly, venerable
septageniarian who's avowed purpose is "education" and who enjoys being a media
darling and getting cash advances from book publishers.

(Okay, okay, I admit that was a little sarcastic and I liked it -g-. But
really, there are still some very good learnings we need to take away from
these ladies, their books, their media rise, and their subsequent predicament.)

Well Paul you raise some interesting questions. But I think your cynicism is
somewhat misdirected. So let me go down your list.

1. How could these nobodies have a better record than Warren Buffett? 

This one is easy. If you invest in high quality growth stocks like Dell or
Lucent or Microsoft you will outperform Buffet virtually all the time. But
given the kind of investing these women did -- no way!!!

2. 2. How can people who have real lives like these folks - outshine
professionals ... 

Actually, this one is even easier. The pros churn and generated large expenses,
so even a passive index fund routinely outperforms the pros. I routinely
consistently outperform them by a very wide margin. All that is required is
some patience.

But again, given the kind of investing these women did -- no way!!!

3. So how come these ladies aren't rich?

They probably are! selling bogus investment advice is a growth industry!

The real problem is that trying to time the market or outguess the market is
generally a losing proposition. And most investment schemes fall into either
one or the other of these categories.

Not sure if I agree or disagree. For me there are no easy answers.

Yes if one invested in Microsoft or Dell or Lucent one could maybe beat
Buffett. But who actually has done this investing? And for 15 years? Dell
wasn't around, nor Lucent, nor Microsoft. Which meant a person would have had
to continually readjust portfolio. Consciously select these winning type stocks
from a whole host of potential candidates. If it was so easy to beat Buffett,
where are all these billionaire success stories?

Regarding beating pros. We need a definition of stocking picking pros. I don't
see expenses as that relevant. 23 percent for Beardstown, top pros at 20 before
expenses, maybe 17-19 after. If we're talking about people forced to by their
business model (fund requirements) to be small cap stock pickers -- yes these
guys are getting creamed by the market which now favors large caps. If we're
talking large cap - take the Davis brothers - generally reputed to have an
outstanding long term record. Percentage wise not as good as the Beardstown
numbers (before their adjustment). Pick value funds - Tweedy Brown - again,
maybe among the best long term records - not as good as Beardstowners. It's
fashionable now for mutual funds not to keep cash. But 15-20 years ago, in down
markets - you had to have cash IMO. That hurts fund percentage performance when
looking back, but at the time it was a very reasonable thing to do (hold cash
in down markets). The Beardstowners didn't have to hold cash. Maybe it's easy
for some individuals to make 20% on money every year for 15 or 20 years - but
it's durn hard for most people -- especially people who maintain real
portfolios (that is, don't have 10K shares of SUNW because they worked there,
and just don't hold only KO because Warren likes it, and don't have just have 3
or 4 types of stock, and don't use margin, and don't just run dinky amounts of
money.) It's about making 17-19 percent over the long run with real amounts of
money, and I don't and didn't believe the Beardstown people could do this for
15 years - esp. oh-so-easily - when it's so tough for pros. Paul Senior

Paul, here's how you can beat the funds:

1. Get a portfolio of high growth stocks. They don't have to be the sexy stuff
like the LU's or the MSFT's. They can be the more mundane things like TYC. Try
to have a portfolio with a beta of 1.3 or higher. Hold those stocks so long as
the underlying growth story is intact. Exit only if the growth story is
compromised. Economic downturns are temporary in nature, and do not compromise
the ultimate growth. The kind of thing you fear is technological obsolescence.
If you see that kind of thing happening get out fast.

2. Don't try to time the market; it can't be done.

3. Real value plays are rare, and in a sense you too are trying to time the
market. This is a mistake because the value plays are frequently value plays
for a reason. The one exception I see in this market is the oil service sector,
and I anticipate that it will continue to be a good investment for the next
three to seven years depending on how rapidly new rigs are brought on line.

The results of this kind of investing are startlingly good. For example, on an
all equity base my portfolio increased by 58.3% over the last 12 calendar
months. The previous twelve months was almost as good -- a bit under 40%.

I am interested in CYMI also. The problem is they told us a while ago that the
current quarter would be lousy. The Street may choose to worry about that again
as earnings time comes closer, and how much better or worse the next one will
be. Therefore, I suspect it goes lower before it goes higher.

I find semiconductor test equipment mfr LTXX interesting from a value point of
view. Solid balance sheet, price about 30% above tangible book. The stock would
have to rise over 130% (not 30%) to achieve the price/book or price/sales
valuations of the average of peers KLAC, TER, and CMOS. Their recent quarterly
release said the new Fusion product "has greatly improved our competitive
position". They made $.02 for last quarter and converted some cash to inventory
"for coming shipments of Fusion". It would not take too much of an increase in
sales for the P/E to get to be pretty low and the valuation to rise toward its
peer's levels. Price obviously reflects industry category weakness and
skepticism based on their past record. State of Wisc owns quite a lot - they
tend to be value investors. Gruntal is the Street firm with a strong buy - $.70
earnings for FY ending 7/31/99, with target of $11.

I have started buying small amounts on an average-in basis. It appears to have
many times larger upside than downside potential, which I have to see to buy a
stock, and tough to find these days.

Jeffrey, I'm of the opinion that most of the time it doesn't pay to try to
outguess the market. I do believe that the oil drillers are an exception for
the following reasons: the market has been using the spot price of oil as a
leading indicator for profits in the group. However, the group's profitability
depends on the supply/demand balance of the rigs. While it is true that
prolonged cheap oil will result in curtailed exploration budgets, it would
probably require oil to be art about $12 for six months for this to happen.
This analysis is based on the premise that the market is mistaken, and so far I
seem to be correct based on the recent Gulf of Mexico lease auction and the
continuing increases in day rates. My favorites in this sector are ESV, GLM and
VRC.

Semiconductor equipment stocks are another issue altogether, because they
depend to a great extent on the vibrancy of the Asian markets. I simply have no
feel for when these economies will turn around, so I don't know that investing
in these companies is a true "value" play. I define value as either the
probable break-up value of a company or the risk-adjusted present value of
future free cash flows. The impact of the Asian currency crisis is such that my
crystal ball is very murky on this, and I would be very hard-pressed to come up
with anything reasonable.

My approach is to assume that all stocks are more or less fully valued by the
market. This approach lends itself to a buy and hold philosophy which I believe
is the way to maximize you market returns.

Paul

I agree with what you say. However, I think your "fully-valued, buy and hold"
reasoning does not apply to MOST stocks with either inflections in industry or
company fundamentals. I think it is here that mistakes in valuation are USUALLY
made. Your example of Wall Street using the wrong premise for valuing
oil-drilling stocks is an outstanding example. That is why most of the stocks I
spend a lot of time looking at are ones with such changes in fundamentals - to
try to figure out whether the Street is correct or not. (Change in mgmt is one
of the most important.)

Paul: I don't buy any of this. Too much opinion and too much anecdotal
evidence. Hard to take you seriously when you say to me that value plays are
"rare" and a "mistake" - when that's how I make money.

"2. Don't try to time the market; it can't be done." Every standard book on
investing says this -- but is it true? Hulbert tracks performance of
newsletters, and he's got some market timers who he says do in fact beat the
market (on a risk return basis), do so consistently, and do it for many years.

"3. Real value plays are rare, and in a sense you too are trying to time the
market. This is a mistake because the value plays are frequently value plays
for a reason." Not sure what you mean by rare. I find such opportunities once
per every couple of weeks maybe. Don't need too many opportunities to make good
money. Of course there's a reason they are value plays. That reason is possibly
why the price might be below fair value. Value investors buy below fair value
and sell at full or fair value. Couple of weeks ago somebody said this was
momentum investing. Now it's market timing. You seem to imply that choosing the
point to buy and choosing the point to sell is market timing. Okay. It
certainly is compared to the method you are suggesting which is buy some growth
stocks (regardless of price apparently) and just hold them until they ain't
growth stocks any more.

I will reiterate my desire: I am looking to invest to make money - not to make
percentages. I believe I have to do the things that successful people who have
gone before me have done if I want to be successful too. The Graham value
methodology works. The Buffett way works. The O'Shaugnessy way may work too.
What you are saying may work for you- but IMO, there's no evidence that it's a
method that is viable throughout a market cycle or any evidence that it's equal
to the work done by the people who I am trying to follow. Paul Senior

Jeffrey, let me give you one example. I bought TYC about twelve years ago for
approximately $4.50 (split adjusted). It is currently selling at about $55.
Neglecting dividends, this works out to an annual rate of return of a little
over 23%. If it were originally bought as an "undervalued" security and sold
when "fully priced" (in the words of the analysts) I would have probably sold
it a year later at $6. But now, consider this. The short term profit would have
been decent (about 33% per annum) BUT 1. I would have had to pay capital gains
taxes which would have reduced the gain by about 1/3 or 22% after taxes; and 2.
the investment returned 22.3% (pre-tax) for the remainder of its life! (it is
still live and well).

Notice the fact that taxes significantly reduce returns. That's why a buy and
hold strategy is so effective -- you avoid paying taxes. In effect, you could
think of capital gains taxes as zero interest non-recourse loans from the
government.

So, the bottom line is: give me a TYC anyday of the week over a "turnaround"
that is undervalued that does not have prospects for long-term growth. And
that's why I like companies like ATI and ASI and TLAB and PSFT.

Don't understand what you are saying there either.

1. "Fees are derived from trading". I thought fees were derived from assets
under management. You are saying fund managers who have MBA's know very well
that MPT is the greatest, but that they (the fund managers) have sold out for
the prospect of high salaries garnered through trading?

2. And I step back now and ask: Why is it even important to discuss beating the
market? We're talking about the philosophy of investing, so okay for a Sunday
-- but in real world, it's not necessary in order to make good money. (ref.
Jeremy Siegel, his book).

3. Nothing wrong with buy and hold IMO. I just don't agree that this is the
only or the best method. And you seem to be advising buying stocks that have
appreciated a ton. You don't talk much about risk. Which is okay for you: your
cost basis may be low and you avoid a capital gain, so you're in good shape.
And I will give you that that the pe was high too when they were lower in price
and expensive then too. But at this market juncture and at current valuations,
I will need to see something concrete, to believe this is the correct
interpretation of MPT (which you are saying is: buy growth stocks apparently
regardless of current prices).

Do you really believe this is the best advice to offer anyone at this point --
that is, to buy the four stocks you listed earlier or such stock of similar
characteristics? Given the possibility that "anyone" includes people with less
than five years investment experience, and maybe a good bunch of people who
have never owned, or been able to own, the same stock more that 18 months?

From:Chuzzlewit

With regard to your comments,

1. Fees are in part derived from trading. Major brokerage houses like ML and
Fidelity run mutual funds.

2. My use of the term "beat the market" was ill chosen. The philosophy of buy
and hold is not to beat the market, but to ride with the market. I should have
said out-perform the market averages.

3. The essence of MPT is this: Risk and return go hand in hand. The greater the
return you desire, the greater the risk you incur. I like rapid growth, so I
look for those kinds of companies, and my trigger point for selling is not
price. It is when the underlying reason for buying the stock (rapid growth) is
compromised. The MPT theorist would point out that a value play is one in which
the risk is lower than would be implied by the expected rate of return.

And finally, yes, I believe that the best advice for people is to buy and hold
growth companies at levels at which they feel comfortable with the implied
risk. This does not mean the companies I listed -- I am happy with that kind of
risk.

To my mind, there is little point in investing in a company that is not
expected to grow its cash flows. Would you invest in a buggy whip company if it
were selling at less than book value? Potential "value" plays are to be found
in companies holding undervalued assets like land (which is carried on the
books at cost). But the key is not what the break-up value of the company may
be, but what is the probability that an investor will realize the break-up
value. What are the chances that Weyerhaeuser will liquidate itself?

In my experience, the less you are tempted to churn, the better. The effect of
taxes on portfolio performance is profound.

I do spend quite a bit of time doing thorough financial analysis on any company
I invest in. This is done not with an eye to finding value, but to garner a
better understanding of how management operates, its efficiency in handling
inventory, potential liquidity problems etc. I also make sure that the price
the stock is selling for has some reasonable relationship to the company's
expected long-term growth. All of the companies I listed pass these litmus
tests.

In looking at my portfolio over the years, I found that I tended to hold stocks
on average about 26 months.

Paul,

If MPT is taught in all the business schools, and claims there are value plays
in which risk is lower than the expected return, does this not go against the
Efficient Market Hypothesis, also taught by all the business schools and just
as respected in the *academic* community?

MPT relies on the assumption that correlations between the stocks/asset
classes/etc. being compared will hold. The efficient portfolios under MPT
typically use historical correlations between the instruments to form the
conclusions.

The problem is this is a curve fit dream. I have seen countless examples of
this theory being used, assigning historical correlations between instruments
where there is no valid assumption that the correlations will hold. The
correlations used are simply a historical extrapolation of noncorrelated data.
You can always find a correlation number.

If you make enough optimal MPT portfolios, and carry them on into the future,
my findings have consistently shown that the portfolio is no longer on the
curve.

I know I may get some strong feedback from this, since MPT is so entrenched in
'common knowledge'. All I know is that academia is very often wrong. The world
was once flat, you know.

Abe, there are several forms of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, and I'm not
claiming that the strong form is correct. Probably all on this thread would
agree that the weak form is correct (TA is nonsense -- there is no "memory" in
past price behavior). In addition, most people would agree that it is possible
to "beat" the market. All you have to do is look at the Value Line effect.

I also agree with you criticisms of MPT as taught in elementary finance
courses. It is a purely hypothetical construct that bears little resemblance to
real behaviors. Nevertheless, it is an excellent starting point because it
avoids many of the pitfalls in stock selection methods, and it underscores the
concepts of risk and rate of return.

You are quite correct in making the point that MPT assumes that historical
correlations persist in the future. We know, for example, that as companies
grow their betas tend to converge to 1.0. That's because we really don't have a
good handle on multiperiod horizons, and it's really the same problem in
valuing a growth company based on expected growth rates.

Nevertheless, I believe it is the best starting point from which to construct a
portfolio. It has stood me in very good stead.

Dear Paul Senior,
Great reply to the cymer challenge. You have my
respect as someone who's knows how to evaluate a
company. My strategy of waiting for $15 a share is
as follows. Next quarter earnings will disappoint.
I have until Fall to buy in before earnings pick up.
It reach $15 just a few weeks ago. Asian crisis is
not over. The Dow is too high. First quarter earnings
will be bad for semi (INTC, MOT,Compaq). My point is
the probability of getting in at a lesser price later
is pretty good. The difference between $15 and $20 is
25 percent, quite significant. If things don't work out
I can put my money in other stocks. My strategy has
worked for 3 years so far. I play the probability game.
You don't think timing can be done? I say never put your
money in unless your sure. If in 4 months I can't buy
Cymer for $15-$16 I will admit on this thread your
right about timing. I know one sample is not

I am not sure Paul would really disagree with you. When there is nothing
timing-wise you can point to on a value-priced stock, you should buy some now.
But CYMI has just had a 1/3 rise in price and
you can point to several disappointment "opportunities" just ahead.
I am watching it as well and will be patient, and maybe miss it.

I own a small amount of DPMI and just bought a small amount of LTXX,
and am being patient for more material positions, for similar reasons.

ZIGO has been taken out behind the woodshed. New products
being accepted, a great long IMO...

ZIGO seems to offer decent value but uncertain earnings prospects just ahead,
because of declining backlog. No insider buying at reduced prices. Is there any
hurry in your opinion? I'd like to see another quarterly earnings report
"card".

Paul,

I am just wondering why you are posting here? Most here, including
me, so violently disagree with just about every statement you say.
You obviously know this. I just don't even feel like it's worth
my time to write the required essay in response to your statements.
Most of the regular posters here are well aware of MPT and the flavors
of EMT and have rejected it. I think you're looking for a different
thread, unless you're looking for a pointless argument.

As a tip, I would just say that posting unsubstantiated self-congratulatory
statements will only perturb those of us that
a)don't know you and
b) haven't seen any prospective public record of your success.
c) recognize many complete idiots are making a killing over the
last 10 years

It seems like everyone I talk to these days says, "I make 40%/year
easy in stocks." Congrats to everyone.

Good investing,
Mike

"I make 40% a year easy in stocks" scares the heck out of a guy like me who
lost a major percentage of his invested assets in the 1973-4
bear market.

I take it with a grain of salt. But even more scary, I half-feel
these statements reflect expectations as much as hope as much as
inflated history.

I don't know if anyone has posted this here, but oil is already on an upward
trajectory as a result of an agreement over the weekend. There has been some
discussion about oilfield services stocks on this thread. They will probably be
on a tear tomorrow and merit watching.

RE: ZIGO < Is there any hurry in your opinion? >

IMO, it all depends on the recovery of the semi & DD sectors.
I have a moderate position in ZIGO near the bottom and I'm
watching the sectors like a hawk. My tormented favorites
include CYMI, NVLS, AMAT, VECO, CFMT, and PRIA. IMO, all of
these, along w/ ZIGO will be easy doubles when Mr. Market says
it's time.

Wallace,
I sometimes lurk here. I noticed the interest in oil related stocks. Thought
this might be of interest.

Paul, you are in value land here. If you want to convince us to take up growth
investing you're going to have to do a lot better than that.

So you buy high beta stocks. And you outperformed the market for the last two
years. Congratulations. If you understand portfolio theory as well as you say
you do, you realize of course that if you're not outperforming in this extreme
bull market with that strategy, you're either incredibly unlucky or braindead.
But what MPT also tells you is that you are going to get murdered in a bear
market.

Yeah, I'm one of those MBA-types. I'll stop now before I get everybody else mad
at me.
