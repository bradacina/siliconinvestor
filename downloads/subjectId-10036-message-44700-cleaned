I'll bottom fish now with dry bulk cargo shipper Diana Shipping, DSX.

Per Yahoo, cash exceeds ltd. That's certainly better than competitor NM (in
which I have a losing position). DSX has been profitable in each of the past
nine years. 18 Analysts (18? Geez) who cover DSX according to Yahoo, and who
have an opinion on 2012 earnings, all seem to be saying now that DSX will be
profitable through 2012. At a much lower level than projected for 2011 though.
Still, if stock drops further, at some point, if not already, the company will
be valued below its scrap value.

I'm in for just a few shares.

Company is doing well, according to the 1H results they show.

ROE is now 17% on $.73/sh stated bv. 24% cagr in bv since company was listed in
Singapore in 1997.

I'm not sure about net debt/capitalization which is 51%. I've no context in

Hi Paul

Re: Noble Group Ltd. (NOBGF.PK)

The YOY growth in BV is encouraging. I like their their recent asset buys in
Brazil;

Nobel completed the acquisition of two more operating sugar and ethanol mills
in Brazil, an acquisition which we first announced in December 2010. These
mills when combined with the imminent completion of the second of the two mills
that we have built ourselves, means that we are now a top tier integrated sugar
producer in the most competitive locations in Brazil, which is itself the most
competitive producing country in the world, accounting for over 50 per cent of
the seaborne exports of sugar.

These are the same things Bunge Limited Bunge Limited (NYSE: BG) and Archer
Daniels Midland Company (ADM) have invested in. Nobel's ROE of 17% is much
better than BG (8.4%) and ADM (12.06%) too. Their high use of debt probably
helped them achieve their superior ROE number.

I like also that they have a play in the Brazil electric grid generating
electricity from their bio mass plant.

They do deploy the use of a lot of debit which I would rather they would not
do. The positive is that they did not get hurt too bad by that in the 2008-2009
credit freeze crash. Either they were lucky or management was able to navigate
the land mines.

VITERRA INC (VTRAF.PK)

Good find. I have added it to my watch list. I have very little exposure to AG
companies located in Canada and Australia. According to Yahoo, total debt to
annual net income is a little too large for me at 7x .The seeking Alpha article
states that they paid down over 40% of the amount reported on Yahoo.

From the seeking Alpha article:"...Debt has declined quite nicely, reducing
interest expense. Currently, management carries $925 million in net debt, after
retiring $436 million during the last quarter..".

That still makes their LT Debt 4x their annual net income right at my
acceptable threshold level.

Their PE & Forward PE is still a bit high at 15 & 13 respectively. I really
only want to pay around 10 PE.

I will go through the Web site link you posted as they may have some hidden
assets on the books that are not reflected by their earnings numbers. The stock
is selling below BV ($CAN 10.48) which signals to me that there could be some
value in the assets they do own.

Hi Grommit -

Medical Properties Trust Inc. (MPW)

I am tempted to nibble at some MPW. It has recently sold off quite a bit and is
now selling at $8.95/share and getting close to it's 52wk low ($8.76/share).
MPW comes out with earnings next week. If they meet annual earnings
expectations ($0.76/share) they will sell at 11.5 PE. I am not too sure what
the future holds but during the 2009-2000 crash this one sold down as low as
$4.00/share.

I sold half of my shares earlier this year around $11.00/share. Their dividend
is yielding 8.9% but I am not sure if this will be maintained or not.

Are you still looking at the other (non medical) Reits and/or would consider
upping MPW on current or lower prices?

GOV is holding well on these sell offs and both COR and DLR have been in a good
trading range. I would think that MPW would be seen as a necessity like food
when times are tough'

Perhaps I will use my standard rule of buying shares at a 10PE or less. That
would translate into a price of $7.60/share.

Any thoughts on this one?

With market down more again today (Dow -240), from my perspective there doesn't
appear to much safety to seek out dividends for safety.

It seems to me with stocks dropping:

My industrial dividend-paying stocks have moved from yielding 1-3%, to now
yielding 3-4%
My reit stocks that were yielding 7-8% are now yielding 8-10%
My bdc stocks which were yielding 8-10% are now yielding 10-14%

Just one sector I'm aware of where yields are holding up or falling. That'd be
utilities where prices are being pushed up as market participants enter areas
where they believe consumer demand will continue to exist even in a double-dip
recession. That would be of course pharma (people will need medicines),
consumer staples (people will buy their toothpaste, paper goods, cleansers,
etc) and utilities (people will want gas/water/elec).

These are all excellent points, which only solidify our joint opinion of the
company - I hope that more people would ignore the long-term and we can benefit
from even lower prices in the short-term. I was thinking about the impact of
the euro woes:

<ul><li>If Germany would stick by the European Union and help the other states
and if George Soros' piece in the FT today is correct, an increased function of
the ECB would result in quantitative easing and lower euro, which in turn would
lower costs in the euro zone, thus making the auto sector more
competitive.</li><li>On the other hand, the less likely scenario of EU breakup
would reinstitute the Deutsche Mark, which would have higher valuation than the
euro, thus we would benefit from the currency appreciation of our
positions.</li></ul>Both scenarios seem possible and there's something to be
gained regardless of what happens - I guess that combined with your points
below contribute to the formulation of margin of safety.

in their fight with Blockbuster and still they prevailed. I think what he's

pay off in the future, but it impresses me how swiftly he acts in the pursuit
of his vision of the future. That said, I've never used the service and the
recent subscriber losses show that there isn't much of a pricing power. Also, I
don't see what superior viewer experience would distinguish Netflix from the
service of the competition. A level of uncomfortable imagination is required to
value the stock and I feel I'm still short of even partial insight. I know you

Hi Paul -

So are you selling some of your dividend paying stocks (w/ good capital
appreciation) for those other value stocks that pay little or no dividends?

Conclusion form the Seeking Alpha article posted:
<u>
Conclusion</u>
The clear message that should be derived from this exercise is that dividend
investors should not be indifferent regarding the capital appreciation
prospects of that “piece of paper in someone’s vault.” In the end, unless
holding periods are extremely high, the majority of the value from an
investment in a stock will tend to come from the capital appreciation. Most
dividend investors recognize that capital appreciation is important. However, I
think that many do not appreciate just how big of a role capital appreciation
plays in the total picture.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------

Grudgingly, I have been peeling off shares from some of my good dividend payers
(even some shares from my dividend aristocrats) to buy some of the truly beaten
down value plays. I have parked a chunk of money in some preferred shares that
pay a nice dividend AND offer some "potential" capital appreciation. My blended
dividend return remains the same but I now have a better capital appreciation
"growth" profile in the portfolio. This is an incremental move I have been
making.

The group I am peeling shares from are those utilities making new highs and
some KMB also near all time highs. I hate to do it, but I agree with the author
that longer term the real money is made from capital appreciation.

FWIW, many of my utility sales were still a bit too early but my new buys are
holding steady too. That's why it's an ongoing process and not an all or
nothing move.

re: dry bulk and DSX

Paul, how do you analyse the dry bulk players? I spent some time in May trying
to understand them. But eventually I concluded they don't lend themselves to
analysis.

Here are bits and pieces derived from what I wrote down in my notes in May. I'd
like to hear your and other's opinions.

=====

Shipping is a commodity business. Charter rates are at the mercy of supply and
demand of the ships. Supply/demand curves from M. Stopford's "Maritime
Economics":

<img src='public/9144338_4576ffcc592ab7438b4680a224d2eac1.jpg'>

Demand is driven by worldwide economy. It is pretty inelastic (i.e. insensitive
to charter rates). As the worldwide economy grows or shrinks, the demand curve
moves left or right. Supply curve has a "hockey stick" shape. Say we are now at
the equilibrium point at freight rate $15k. When demand shrinks, there are more
ships then needed in the sea. Freight rates drop. There is a floor to the rates
as there are minimum fix costs to run the ships. In short-term ship owners can
do 2 things: (1) cruise the ships at slower speed to save fuel consumption
and/or (2) lay-by the ships or send the ships to drydock for maintenance. Both
will reduce the effective number of ships in the fleet, but not by a huge
margin.

In the opposite scenario: when demand grows beyond the size of the fleet. Since
new ships can't be added to the fleet at wish, freight rates skyrocket. Hence,
the almost vertical slope at the right. And this can happen in very short time,
in the order of weeks/months as seen in the past. The figures in the graph are
in scale and real. Freight rates can go from $6000 to $44,000 within months.

The above are the short-term dynamics. In long-term, when demand grows, ship
owners become optimistic and start ordering new ships. However, a new ship take
1-3 years to build. Besides, shipbuilders have finite capacity. By the time the
shipbuilders expand their shipyards and new ships are built, the demand is no
longer there. We now have an oversupply of ships and freight rates tumble. At
this point, some ship-owners will start scrapping their old ships (age > 25
years old) for the steel. This will permenantly remove the ships from the
fleet. Eventually, the equilibrium will tip the other way and the cycle
restarts again.

Historically, shipping cycles last for 8 years on average. We of course can't
assume it's like a clockwork ticking every 8 years. But this gives us a sense
of the time scale.

Because of these structural reasons, the magnitude of boom and bust cycles is
extraordinary. BDI was at its highest 11,000 in mid-2008 before the GFC,
tumbled to 700 in Dec 2008, recovered to 4,600 in Nov 2009 and is now hovering
around 1,270. At the moment there is an oversupply of dry bulks. Even scrapping
rate has picked up a lot, it still can't counteract the rate new ships rolling
off the shipyards.

The important implications of all these are:
<ul><li>Everything is driven by supply/demand: Supply/Demand drives charter
rates; charter rates drive ship prices; ship prices drive scrap values;
historic ship prices drive book value. All of them are moving target.
</li><li>Book value is misleading because we are looking at the historic prices
the shipbuilder paid at particular points in the cycle which are no longer
relevant.
</li><li>Mark to market and scrap value are also not useful because both are
sensitive to present charter rates.
</li><li>Because the industry is in constant boom and bust and the shipowners'
earnings swing hugely, it is not meaningful to talk about "average earning in
normal business environment" in Graham/Buffett's context. EPV analysis is
meaningless.
</li><li>Conventional metrics like ROA and Profit Margin are also not useful.
The denominator in ROA is very sensitive to the timing the ship were purchased.
At the same time, since shipowners can decide between locking in the revenue
using time chartering or gambling on the spot market, the numerators in the ROA
and profit margin are sensitive to the timing of these decisions.
</li><li>Dividend yield and earning yield are not useful. Once the time
charters expire, they can fall off the cliff.
</li></ul>In short, I can't find something on which I can anchor the valuation.

My best attempt is to treat the ship prices and scrap prices at the height of
GFC as the floor and calculate the liquidation value of the shippers. As in
May, only PGRN, NM and DSX have positive value.

I reckon the way to play the dry bulk game is to find a shipper which
<ul><li>has strong liquidity, cashflow and no threats from debt convenants to
go through the hard time </li><li>has limited exposure to counterparty risk.
Because of the high concentration of clients (i.e. the charters), any single
failed one will have huge impact on a shipowner's time charter income. So we
need to verify its charters financial strength. (In Feb, a Korean charter went
into bankruptcy protection and affected a few US shippers.) </li><li>has a
liquidation value above its share price. </li><li>has meaningful exposure in
spot charter so that once the industry recover, it will take advantage of the
higher charter rates</li><li>has meaningful exposure in Capesize because its
charter rates swing the most</li></ul>Apparently, DSX is the safest bet. But it
doesn't have much exposure to spot charter. So, when the industry recovers, it
doesn't get the ten bagger return we need to compensate for the risk we take.

The current market cap for NFLX is around $6B. The DVD business can be spun
off, and will still generate very nice cash flows with minimal capex for quite
a while. I don't have a good handle on what the DVD business is worth, but it
should be a decent percentage of that $6B market cap. Google paid $1.65B for
YouTube way back when, in retrospect that price was probably cheap for what
they were able to realize from the acquisition. So the big question, in my
mind, is how much is NFLX worth to MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, or anyone else who is
looking to offer streaming content?

I don't have a good answer to that question, but I do believe we've moved from
insanely overvalued to a price where this company starts to become attractive
as an acquisition target.

Also, FWIW, there are no recent subscriber losses, there are projected
subscriber losses based on the change in pricing. The price increases will
offset decreases in subscribers, and a scenario where revenues increase despite
the losses is far from unlikely.

I read a Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns research paper, which showed
that a $1 invested in US Equities in 1900 grew to $600 by the year 2000 when
dividends were reinvested. When the investor relied solely on the capital

The dividend yield was much higher for most of the 20th century, that is why
dividend yield used to matter that much. However nowadays the dividend yield is
about 3%, less than the 5% averaged that is used to be for the better part of

Compounding with dividend works just as well as compounding with capital gains.
In fact I would argue that if companies indeed would manage capital allocation
well and only buy back stock or do acquisisiton when it is accreditive for
owners, stock buybacks are better for investors than Dividends because
dividends have the drawback of double taxations. That is one of the reasons why
a company like BRK is likely to outperform and index like SP500 buy a couple of
points annually (quality of management is another one) even though BRK does not
pay any dividends right now.

NFLX - I think you are asking me a wrong question "what do you think would be a
good metric for valuation?"

If you have to invent special metrics to value a company, then it's most likely
you're just fooling yourself that it's cheap. Comparable takeover prices
proposed by Mark Marcellus in his response is IMHO one of such metrics. Lots of
people lost tons of money expecting comparable takeover pricing - including
some IDCC investors very recently (I still hold some IDCC that I coulda/shoulda
sold at "comparable takeover" pricing runup though I sold most of it.)

If I am misinterpreting your question and you are asking "what is good price to
buy NFLX", then my answer is maybe at $3B valuation, but even then I'd not be
sure. As I said, part of this is unanswerable, because for NFLX to trade at $3B
valuation some really bad things have to happen and these things would have to
be evaluated before buying.

Disclosure: I think NFLX CEO is stupid to split NFLX into two companies. My
arguments were outlined here:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27649675&srchtxt=Amazon . In

Declaring bankruptcy of an significant subsidiary for a financial cooperation
is not a minor issue, because confidence is the most important asset of a
financial institution and a bankruptcy is not exactly inspiring confidence..
There is a still a question if Countrywide can be ringfenced and an attempt to
bankrupt if will certainly be contested by numerous parties that have claims
against countrywide (debtors, mortgage holders etc.), as well as regulators.

it would be akin to a nuclear option where an embattled person surrounded by
thugs, pulls a handgrenate out of his pocket and threatens to pull the trigger.

My thinking is that the threat to pull the nuclear option is more viable than
executing it and may lead the opposing party to keep their claims and
specifically the putbacks at a reasonable level. My sense is that this talk
about Countrywide bankruptcy is more a threat than an real option, since the
fallout is unforeseeable. Just my opinion of course.

J Mako, yes nice analysis you've made on DSX.

As I understand DSX's strategy it's to have a cash position and access to debt
such that management can grow revenue by acquiring ships when the shipping
market is distressed. So buying DSX is a bet that management can determine lows
in the shipping cycle well enough to astutely deploy company cash.

I use Yahoo numbers here (Which might or might not be correct): If DSX stock,
now about $7-8, were to drop to ~$4.5/sh., then the market cap of the company
would equal its current cash position. I guess I'd call that a very good price
bottom, because management could take the company private with its cash
(assuming loan covenants permit that, and management has any incentive to do
it). During the depths of '08-'09, DSX didn't get below $8, and if the company
can muddle on in 2011-2012 as analysts predict (assuming at least a few of them
did actually evaluate DSX's time-charters), I'll go with $4.5 being my call as
a bottom for the stock. (Of course, it's a guess because anything can happen at
any time.)

Except for this year (2011), in each year since 2005, DSX has traded sometime
above $15. I'll guess and bet that if I can hold on for a couple/three years,
DSX will again trade sometime at $15, a gain of about $7 on my buy price.
Versus a risk that the stock continues to drop to maybe $4.5, a $3-3.5 loss.
The way I'm looking at it now, if I don't change my view or scare myself out of
the stock, if the stock does drop to $4.5 I will want to up my few shares.

Clownbuck,

Thanks for the chart! I think what it also shows is that dividend yields are
probably going to go up from here.
I agree with you that buybacks in general add more value than dividends, but
not always. Buybacks are most effective when they are done at the right (low)
prices (your example of BRK.A/BRK.B is valid below), but then you would see a
lot of companies purchasing their own shares in bull markets at inflated prices
just because they are enjoying business optimism at the time. It doesn't take
much brain to declare a dividend, whereas capital allocation is more complex.

You bring another good point that I've always been wondering about. I still
don't understand why dividends are taxed at the same level as capital gains?
They are fundamentally different animals. For example, preferred dividends are
a pre-tax expense item, which is not double-taxed. Just because regular
dividends are reduction of stockholders' equity, does it make it right to
double-tax? I would argue that capital gains ought to be higher and dividends
on the common lower.

How do you get to the $3 billion valuation?

I think that when the stock was popular, people were mostly focused on how
quickly it was adding subscribers, which probably was not the best metric. I
used to own China Mobile and every month I would see millions of people being
added, but then when it reached 400 million I realized it had already been
factored in. Maybe sales per subscriber is good metric?

Whether it's a good idea to split the business or not, nobody knows and once we
do know it won't be a good buy anymore. I hope you are right that it goes even
lower from here.

I'd tell you, I think your household might be a good catalyst of what happens
to NFLX. Similar to people asking you whether your wife is excited about stocks
or not - honestly you might be having the best metrics at home. Keep us posted.

Good Morning EKS.

Thanks for pointing out the conclusion on the dividend article. Just wanted to
add that beyond that, the author also concluded that free cash flow was the
underlying theme in analyzing the dividend because that is the primary driver
for both capital gain and dividend.

You mentioned moving funds to preferred shares seeking "potential" potential
capital appreciation and selling stocks hitting new highs to buy beaten down
value plays. I am curious as to both of these strategies.

We may want to discuss BAC preferred ?

CCM,

To date this has been a really dumb idea, even with a 0.18 dividend the stock
is way down.

However, the just announced a $20 million buyback, which is 13% of market cap
and 1/3 of float. No guarantee they will buy it all back, but they did complete
a buyback last year, and just paid a special dividend.

CCM is a Chinese smallcap listed in the US, but I think it is legit. First, it
had a sponsored IPO with JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley, not a reverse merger.
Second, there is almost no short interest. Actually, there is no interest at
all, even after the big buyback announcement. There are few Yahoo postings, no
recent Seeking Alpha articles, etc. I have found that this is usually the best
time to buy -- when nobody cares. Third, the company is putting its money where
its mouth is. For me, the clearest sign of a scam is that the company won't buy
back stock (or only token amounts) when the ratios are "no-brainer" cheap.

That being said, this is not a widows and orphans stock. I cannot guarantee
that the company is not a fraud. You could lose all your money. Also, see my
prior post on the stock.

I have been doing the same as you here:

EKS:
"Grudgingly, I have been peeling off shares from some of my good dividend
payers to buy some of the truly beaten down value plays. I have parked a chunk
of money in some preferred shares that pay a nice dividend AND offer some
"potential" capital appreciation. The group I am peeling shares from are those
utilities making new highs and some KMB also near all time highs."

me:
I sold all of my NI, and most ATO recently. AGL will be next -- a little at at
time. In the last crash, utilities also were nailed, so we are fortunate that
they have held up this time. I was holding them this time as a cash substitute,
and it worked. KMB: I sold a small amount, and will consider more. Which pref
shares do you consider to have cap appreciation potential? Prob the energy pref
shares, I guess. My exposure is very limited there, whew.

MPW?, you ask. I own a small amount. I see better potential in AHT, LXP, DRE,
BDN, OFC, GOV, because I do not accept the future earning projections of MPW. I
got out of medicaid dependent OHI, LTC.

Just sold all KWR for a tax toss, and bought GLW as a substitute. Not related
businesses, but maybe I will swap back in 30+ days. I am attracted to trains,
and will prob buy some UNP with utility funds.

I am still even YTD (well, really -0.9%), counting dividends received, with a
portfolio div yield at 6.9%. :o)

Utilities at 8% of portfolio, vs 16% on Jan 1.

utilities 8%

Hi Grommit. Same question for you as to EKS. Selling high to buy low? Buying
beaten up value stocks or buying stocks that have value below market price? And
how much capital appreciation can you expect from a preferred stock?

I posted a few days ago questioning KMB's downgrade on valuation while the
analyst raised the price target and have been posting against the grain on this
thread about watching the range because the market is being run by computer
programs.

Same opinion here:

Hi Grommit -

I should start a Grommit stock watch list.

I added AHT, LXP and DRE to my REIT watch list as these might make good future
additions. I think buying some deep discounted preferreds could be a good
strategy (and perhaps a safer) value play than picking up common shares w/
little or no dividend. In the 2008-2009 crash there were some good
opportunities to be had buying deep discounted preferreds if you bought at the
right time. The key is to buy several of the deep discounted preferred series
in a few different sectors and hope the companies will be a survivor after a
2-3 year recover period. Buffet has done this with his own BAC preferred deal
but now he says this could be a 10 year marriage rather than something shorter.

I have been building up my preferred watch list which I monitor everyday. When
I see the market sell off, I check this watch list to see if the preferred
issues are selling off too or perhaps it might be just a sector and/or company
issue. For example, GMXRp has been tanking along with the common shares. I own
a small position and do not plan on buying any more of their preferred shares
as the current weakness may be a company specific thing rather than a sector or
market event.

I do plan to eventually sell my common shares in GMXR on any positive run
higher and may just put the total proceeds into the GMXRp and collect the
dividend and use the discount to Par as my way of participating in company
capital appreciation.

<u>Here are the companies on my Preferred Watch list:</u>
http://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/DFT-PA,OFC-PG,GST-PA,FR-PJ,DFT-PB,EPM-PA,OFC-PH
MHR-PC,OFC-PJ,MHR-PD,GMXR-P,FR-PK/view/dv;_ylt=Av575vxz9PBg1VAkmzqHqLsLv7gF;_yl
=X3oDMTEydDA3OGxkBHBvcwMxMQRzZWMDeWZpVGFibGlzdARzbGsDZGV0YWlsZWQ-

The OFC group may be candidates for buys if they every sell at a significant
discount to PAR. I will begin buying more of the MHRpD once it breaks
$40.00/share (PAR $50). I own MHRpC and use it as a source of funds to buy
other stocks when I can sell over $25.00/share (Par is $25.00). I add to it
from time to time at any price below PAR.

GSTpA is one I have recently been adding to below $20.00/share. I see this as a
speculative Buy at this level or lower. They have a clean balance sheet and a
well capitalized JV investor (see my earlier posts regarding their JV investor:
The South Korean Investor - Atinum Partners Co.
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27635227 ). If their JV deal
proves profitable, their investor could easily just buy GST and if that occurs
this preferred series would be paid off at PAR w/ a slight premium.

<u>With any of these preferred shares, they are thinly traded especially if an
institutional holder needs to cash out. You can scalp shares and put in low
ball bids but do use "All or None" limit orders so you get a complete fill. For
example, on August 8-10, 2011 DFTpA traded as low as $21.75/share on large
volume (82K shares). I missed the opportunity. In only a few days it was back
trading around par again. An institution could not transact a separate third
party deal and sold their shares ATM offering a 15% discount to the previous
day's market price. That was a pretty good and safe bet.</u>

Sergio H mentioned why not buy discounted Bank preferred shares (ie
BAC,JPM,WFC)? I just do not like this sector at all but eventually if the
discount to Par is w/i a reasonable "Value" range it may make a good candidate.
I probably should add a few to my preferred watch list as well as other
sectors.

I still own a few shares of ATO and a fairly large holding of AGL (obtained
when they merged with NI). I like Both for their NG Pipeline storage,
processing & distribution assets. Along with MDU (they also own some of the
largest NG storage facilities in North America), AGL and ATO should be good
growers as the domestic NG shale is developed. These companies should benefit
significantly from the NG reserve expansion w/o directly being impacted by
changes in NG & Oil prices (they move volume irrelevant to what prices are).
They have diversified regulated operations that shield them from specific
sector slumps.

Lv7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTEydDA3OGxkBHBvcwMxMQRzZWMDeWZpVGFibGlzdARzbGsDZGV0YWlsZWQ-

Presently, my long term theme is that Oil & Gas and the infrastructure that
supports this industry is a better collateralized bet (based on the assets they
own and the FCF they geneerate) than with a mega financial bank (like BAC, JPM
or WFC) and their mortgage loans collateralized by a very weak domestic real
estate market. I would rather own a basket of Oil & NG assets than a basket of
mortgage loans at this point in the cycle.

EKS, thanks for posting your watch list of preferred stocks. Many of the stocks
on your list do not have historical price information through Yahoo. I'm trying
to gauge volatility as well as capital risk/reward.

I have to confess that I've never looked at preferred stocks previously due to
their low volume although this has never stopped me from buying thinly traded
small caps, so this is educational for me.

Just a quick note on GMKR, I see a large shot position as of 9/15 but much
lower than as of the prior month. Short covering has something to do with the
price movement for Sept.

Thanks again.

The Schwab Street Smart Edge along w/ Street Smart Pro platforms is what I use.
They have a chart module that pulls all the preferred share trading data (by
minute if needed) which allows you to distinguish between noise vs a large
institutional Sell or Buy.

For those preferreds that make monthly distributions, you can view trades pre &
post their ex-dividend date, look at daily trading spreads along with volume
(low vs high volume days) and if patient can move into and out of positions w/o
having to pay up on the full spread. I do find it is easier to buy "below" the
market when there is a large seller. The market maker on most of these issues
will transact a sell based on their bid price. On rare occasions will they meet
me in the middle when I am selling.

If you go into these with this trading mentality, you can take advantage of the
inefficiencies in this market. For example if I need to increase my source of
funds for the Day/week, each morning I will place a sell order for a few of my
preferreds based on the previous "highs" traded for the past few trading
secessions.

If time is of the essence or the need of funds is immediate, you will have to
accept the spread prices. I have even noticed that the typical ex-dividend drop
reflecting the dividend payout does not always occur as it should.

Therefore, BOTH the Buyer and Seller need to be careful.

Little discussion on mining stocks that have absolutely getting hammered
recently on fears of a Chinese slowdown. These stocks are dirt cheap based on
current prices. Even if one were to discount metal prices another 20%, the PE
ratio would be very low.

I own some Vale and a little bit of TC. I believe from the remainder of the

One hears a lot about the Dr Copper, supposedly smart indicator. Copper is used
in a lot of constructions but with all those influences from the future
exchanges (don't tell me that futures don't matter because there is no physical
settlement) I am wondering if anything is a reflection of anything else but
expectations of players in the future markets rather than real demand right
now.

I believe we should look at balance sheet leverage, including cash flow
commitments from mining expansion projects, production costs and management
quality. What we don't want at this point of the cycle is buy a company that
runs out of money and needs to dilute at the bottom like Rio did. I know that
BHP (BBL is the cheaper twin) and Vale are very safe from this perspective but
I am not quite sure about the others.

EK. Kodak's been a ltb&h stock for me. Have held it maybe 80 years. Well 80
years in my family. My cost basis is $41.22 per share, so I've lost 98% of its
value. Fortunately...or unfortunately... I've only 15 shares . Kept just as a
souvenir. My grandfather worked for the company for 45 years and received stock
as part of salary during and after the depression (the '29-'32 one, not this
current one -g-). My mom inherited the EK shares. Her only stock. She made a
decision to sell most of it, and her timing was excellent -- selling most of
Kodak when the stock was near an all-time high in '97 I believe.

Kodak was a great company in so many ways. With advent of digital cameras and
its sale of Eastman Chemical, there was no financial reason I could see to
invest in the company or hold the stock that I had inherited from my mom. So I
sold most of my shares.

Our family is grateful for benefits received --jobs at EK were had during
depression, which helped my grandparents to get through it and to help their
neighbors who weren't so fortunate. There were medical benefits and later a
full pension.

Of course it's fun to speculate what could be if my grandad started his working
days at Exxon instead or some other great company in the day, got stock, stayed
45 years, and if the family still had all shares, even without reinvesting
dividends.

I looked at CCM briefly - the company is expanding fiercly, revenues went from
76M RMB to 350M RMB. Property and equipment as well as Sharecount are expanding
even faster than revenues (Sharecount: 17M (2007)---> 49M (2010)). My take is
the dividend is payed for by share issues

Star (CV) isthe largest shareholder and is a Maurcie Greenberg vehicle and GE
is also a significant shareholder (I presume they buy some of their equipment)
Both are no dummies and Maurice is an expert on China and serves on the board
of several US hospitals.

Then on the other hands they own stock in scams like China Media holdings and
China cord blood:
http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1340459/000114036111040407/form13fhr.txt

They also have some debt for which they are paying ~7% interest rates (despite
having a lot of cash on their balance sheet which pays only 1.5%). This has
been another indicator of fraud for Chinese companies. At least the interest
rates earnings on their cash are somewhat believable.

I am staying away from this because I don't get the business expansion that is
financed by issuing increasingly cheap stock. The dividend may just be there to
dupe new shareholders in a Ponzi scheme. I don't think that Starr's holding
means anything given their record with Chinese stock investments.

My concern is a Lehman style meltdown that will cause a sharp reduction in Real

as the fallout on GNP growth. I am sure that the Chinese government would step
in at some point and also a program to build 32M affordable housing units in 5

If you have to invent special metrics to value a company, then it's most likely
you're just fooling yourself that it's cheap. Comparable takeover prices
proposed by Mark Marcellus in his response is IMHO one of such metrics. Lots of
people lost tons of money expecting comparable takeover pricing

Well, since I'm not investing in NFLX, I guess we agree on that point. However,
I'm not suggesting comparable takeover prices as the metric. I tossed the
YouTube price out just to give some perspective. My point on valuing NFLX was:

- You have the DVD business which is fairly easy to project and is perfectly
suited to being valued with a terminal DCF analysis.

- Once you've done that, you will know what an acquirer would be paying for the
streaming business. Anyone with detailed knowledge of the industry should be
able to do a reasonable estimation of the range of values that would make it a
good acquisition for a GOOG or MSFT. (IMO, MSFT is the most likely acquirer in
this hypothetical scenario, they need it more and it nicely complements what
they currently have).

I'm not equipped to do the analysis to determine what NFLX is worth to an
acquirer - and as you said comparitive takeover prices aren't going to get you
there. Anyone who isn't equipped to do that, and who is looking at this stock,
should realize that they're the sucker at the poker table.

Having said all that, my hunch is that your SWAG of 3B is way too low, but both
of us will have to sit on the sidelines and wait to see. I also think the
decision to split the business was right - creative destruction and all that.
The split was inevitable in the long run and for that matter NFLX has clearly
stated that this was their long term strategy. The business is consolidating
rapidly, and I think Hastings was right to get out in front of this so he's in
a position to strategically combine with partners or get taken over outright.
The streaming business is a powerful franchise, but it is getting to the point
where they won't be able to go it alone. They need strong partners.

destruction and all that. The split was inevitable in the long run...

I continue to disagree. There's only one situation where the split was right:
selling both parts of the company to different acquirers asap. If they do it,
OK they win. :) If they don't do it, then:

From company standpoint: See Amazon analogy. The split of e-books from paper
books is inevitable in the long run. They should split it now... Nah, it's
stupid.

From product acquisition standpoint: Acquiring DVDs and renting them was
relatively straightforward. Acquiring streaming rights is totally dependent on
the major content providers attitude on a given day. Becoming hugely dependent
on your supplier goodwill is a very risky step.

From the customer standpoint: Split just forces customers to rethink their
decision to have the service. And it comes after a significant price raise. If
Netflix did not split, the decision would be: keep Netflix, cancel Netflix or
try to find two or more companies to replace a single convenient Netflix
service. Netflix wins. Now the decision is: keep both services, keep Netflix
(streaming), keep (Quickwhatever) DVD, switch one service, switch both, and so
on. There are so many more variants and most of the non-Netflix-no-Quicksh
become much more attractive. E.g. Amazon Prime with free streaming is a prime
contender for me personally. (Ah yes the "stupid" Amazon that never split their
books from their movies and is trying to bundle book delivery with free
streaming - how could they compete with the genius Noflix CEO ;))). Although
bundling is somewhat disgraced by the telcos/cablecos of the world, it makes
huge sense for customers when the products are overlapping or practically the
same.

CCM,

Clownbuck, good points but you miss the obvious.

There was a US IPO for CCM in 2009. That is why the sharecount increased so
much. The reason they have been expanding is that expansion was the entire
purpose behind their IPO. It could be a sign of fraud, but you can't blame a
company for following up on its IPO business plan. What's more, if they are
continuing to expand then taking on debt while they can makes sense, as the
remaining cash can be used to fuel the expansion later on.

Since IPO they have decreased sharecount, having bought back stock last year.
And of course they just announced a huge buyback.

Good call on Platinum. Sharp drop in Sept.

And even sharper a drop when compared to Gold's recent slump.

This is highest price gold has been relative to Platinum in history.
Interesting development. If we look at history, Platinum is where to put your $
now. But if due to the overwhelming confusion and instability in the world's
economies, this time is different ?

Sunday OT stuff: Yes, that's right, Madharry. Rochester was Kodak.

Maybe #2 or #3 at the time in Rochester, 1930-1950, might have been the
clothing industry with its many and various tailoring companies. When workers
at a little company called Haloid in Rochester that made photographic paper
chose a union, they believed themselves lucky to get the large Amalgamated
Clothing Workers of America to represent them. Maybe it was the only union that
would accept them.
Which is why when Haloid grew to become Haloid-Xerox then Xerox , you had the
odd situation of thousands of workers in Xerox's NY manufacturing plants being
members of the ACWA.

I'm a UofR grad. Bad memories of my time there. Maybe I started too young
(sixteen). Uncaring professors/administrators, and I needed a little tlc. (Do
colleges in this day & age still get away with having foreign-born grad
students whose English is incomprehensible as teaching instructors for
undergrad classes?)
Looking at tuition cost now, and looking back at my experience, an undergrad BA
degree wouldn't be worth spending $200K for at that school. ("The term bill of
tuition, room, and board will grow a total of 4 percent from $51,120 to $53,160
for the 2011-12 year.")

Funny how generations repeat errors. My parents knew of Haloid/Haloid-Xerox
when it started its growth phase. They never seriously considered buying stock.
(Maybe they never had any money to "gamble" in the stock market.) My turn: I
knew of Paychex in its early phase and later, and knew about ADP and the
success it had, yet, although I had cash to buy, I never considered looking at
Paychex as an investment during those early and middle years of PAYX's growth.
Finally I did buy a few shares 8/'10 (based on company's history, especially
history of raising dividends).
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=PAYX&t=my&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=
(If stock drops to new lows on no adverse news, I'm likely to add a few more
shares. Eventually there'll be jobs created in this country by small
businesses, and PAYX will benefit, I expect.)

More Sunday OT: Where would you go for a good job? Where would you advise
somebody to go for a job?

I was just mulling that again as I made my morning coffee. Not sure that we
could get agreement on what a "good" job is. In the context of, a young
person-- right out of high school or just graduating from college (with $100K
in debt), or maybe age 25 and looking to finally get some sort of good
opportunity -- where are good places to go for a job?

Sipping my coffee, I see three choices. This is what I would say to somebody:

If you are from and in Rochester NY and/or you are of a certain cultural
background, say Italian-American, the answer for you is likely, stay in
Rochester NY or Corning or Brooklyn or any other area where you were born and
raised. Because the number one thing in your life is Family. You do not want to
be far from parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins, and friends. Your best
bet is to get the best job you can find with the skills you possess. Or get new
skills that might fit jobs that might be available in your local environment.

Second. Move to where the jobs are, or will be. Right now it seems (to me) to
be in the gas/oil business. Go where there's going to be development of shale
oil. An activity which seems to be a given. There will be, or are, jobs for
unskilled and skilled, people wanting to get in early and grow as the sector
grows. Jobs that pay well and where there's advancement opportunities. The
drawback might be that you might have to live for several or many years in
places such as North Dakota, Montana, desolate Canada, maybe some "less
desirable" spots in Texas. Live where life might be very different from what
you experience now - - life where there's not a lot of pleasant things --- not
good weather, where social services might not be so good, nor infrastructure
nor cultural activities.

Three. Go where you want to wind up. If your dream is to work, make money, move
out of cold climes to someplace warm or exciting --- maybe for you Florida or
California -- or someplace that's attracting business like Texas (presumably),
or someplace that's your exotic dream and desire -- maybe Hawaii or South
America or China -- then go there now. If you are struggling to find a job and
career and are not successful where you are, move to where you want to be and
try there. Start and raise your family there.
If you can, pick up new skills in this new area that might meet the job demand
that might exist there.

Oh well, for me, if I were starting out now, I'd make the sacrifice, and I'd
try to go choice Two. At least give it a year to see how the pluses and minuses
work out.

In my day, I went with choice Three: Out of cold NY to California. My coffee
finished now, it's sunny and 75 here, and I guess I'll get up and go for a walk
along the beach.

I think I'll be sitting on the sideline. I must be influenced by Pabrai who had

the same "leveraged" return from spot charter players.

One tiny pure spot charter player in drybulk is Baltic Trading. But it's not
independent. It's a spinoff from highly indebted GNK. It's basically the spot
charter arm of GNK, I reckon.

Btw, all these shippers are registered in exotic countries. Any idea why they

I'm thinking there maybe be a different reason. While back when Netflix
negotiated streaming rights with content providers, they had to agree to delay
new DVD offering. I found myself quite often getting a new movie at Redbox,
instead of Netflix. Having two separate businesses, Netflix can be competitive
on the DVD rental side, and price online streaming according to deals they get
from content providers. My guess is streaming rights negotiations are tough,
Netflix does not have as much leverage as they would like.There were few
streaming services that already went bust. I dropped my Netflix streaming
service, documentaries were about the only interesting movies I found there.

My advice - get out of the country. Some place where the economy is booming,
the weather is good, the salary buys you a good lifestyle and where the women
are good looking and plentiful. Try China or Vietnam, which works great if you
are from an Asian background and speak the language. Hire with an US company
that has operations overseas. Give yourself 2 years to find out if you like it.

If it works out if can be a great carrier move and even if it does not the

During the time that period where share count has increased from 17M to 49M,
net income has increased from roughly 17M RMB to 131 M RMB. Income has gone
from 1.02 per ADS to 2.66 per ADS in that same period.

Regarding the loans, the following excerpt is from the most recent 20-F.

Our short- and long-term debt obligations as of December 31, 2010 represent
bank borrowings obtained by our subsidiaries. Our short-term bank borrowing
outstanding as of December 31, 2010 had a weighted average interest rate of
4.60% per annum. Our long-term bank borrowing outstanding as of December 31,
2010 had a weighted average interest rate of 5.30% per annum.

The 12 million is loans is principally with China Construction Bank and
Agricultural Bank of China. I look at this as a positive since most Chinese
ponzi schemes are debt free and, consequently, don't have to undergo the due
diligence process of getting a loan.

Since the latest IPO, CCM has repurchased 11 million dollars of stock and paid
out, to my estimation 8 million dollars in a special dividend. This doesn't
include the recently announced buyback on Friday.

So if the company is trying to "dupe new shareholders" they are going to
extreme measures. That also means they have duped Ernst and Young, General
Electric, which owns 500,000 shares, two of the major four banks in China, and
the short sellers, since there is are only 9000 shares short as of 9/15.

Of course, anything is possible. (Anyone remember Worldcom, Enron, Tyco, and
Global Crossing, if one believes that the Chinese have a lock on scandal) At
least management has been proactive in supporting shareholders in the process.

Hi Grommit

Thanks for reminding me to look at KMB. No longer close to it's all time high.
I was looking at peeling off some shares and moving the proceeds into some of
these deep value buys (Gov trading under $20.00). I am trying to pick up
another lot of GOV now yielding close to 8.5%.

Fortunately, I have a good chunk of money stashed away at Vanguard in their
GNMA fund. I just moved a portion to the brokerage account (it takes 3 days
through ACH transfer). I agree w/ you that this could be a long (several month)
drawn out move to the down side so my new buys have to be done with patience
and in small amounts.

The other strategy I am looking at is to peel off shares from my profitable
high dividend paying stocks (several are near highs and have stalled out from
moving higher) and move the proceeds into beaten down multi year low dividend
payers many which are selling at 10PE or lower.

For example I am looking at selling some VZ and/or T and buying some of the
many REITs that have been discussed (COR, GOV, DLR). The idea is to maintain
the portfolio dividend stream but have a better capital gain grower.

My backstop for parking money into preferreds is not working today as the MHR
series is dropping to the point where I s/d be buying more and the series C is
now $1.00 below PAR. The D's are yielding more than the C's. Much of the 3%-8%
moves in these is due to the lack of liquidity and a few holders liquidating
for "fast" cash.

I plan to be moving some more funds into these and selling at some what higher
levels with a market rebound. This works fine as long as the underlining
companies remains sound.

It's a fun market as there are a lot of opportunities to make money and refresh
the portfolio with a lot of good value positions. It's just a bit frustrating
that next week the value buys may be a better prices than I am getting today.

FWIW doubled up my losing position in Fibria Celulose S.A.(NYSE: FBR ). Company
is impacted by the strong Brazilian Real and even as the company reduces their
LT debt, they still are leveraged more than I would like to see. This one goes
into my AG basket.

I've been selling everything in my portfolio that is not a value stock. I'm not
buying anything just yet as the major indexes have broken under their recent

buying back soon. I've held on to stocks that are near their highs which is
quite remarkable in this market sell off and will be buying more shares of
these stocks soon as well as buying oversold stocks.

Historically, Sept. has been the worst month for stocks and the fourth quarter
has been positive. We should see a rally soon. I think its a good time to start
loading up on high quality stocks. With all the cash sitting in the till at so
many companies, we should see more share buybacks soon or acquisitions. Fourth
q earnings reports with a positive spin would help too.

I am keeping my eye on <u>Tortoise Power and Energy Infra (TPZ).</u> When we
experienced the sell off in August (especially in Oil) the TPZ close end fund
sold down below $20.00/share briefly. It reflected over a 10% discount to it's
NAV.

http://www.cefconnect.com/Details/Summary.aspx?ticker=TPZ

Shares in this fund usually have a one or two day lag in adjusting it's NAV to
the oil price drop. Sometimes it over shoots the "fair value" price by as much
as 10%. A lot depends on the sustained fall in the oil & NG price, the general
market sell off and the number of shareholders limning up at the exit door and
willing to sell their shares at a loss (just to get out!).

I am monitoring TPZ and the price of Oil to see if there becomes a significant
price imbalance. If Oil stays in the $74-$79/barrel range, TPZ could see it's
all time low at $18.50 (10/5/2009).

Depending on the severity of the sell off and price of Oil, TPZ could overshoot
again and provide a good entry point for a relatively safe play for some income
producing assets.

As you recall, TPZ uses less leverage than <u>The Cushing MLP Total Return Fu
(SRV) </u>and is less volatile and more apt to reflect a better discount to
it's NAV. SRV usually sells at a premium to it's NAV. I sold all of my SRV
because of this and continue to hold my TPZ.

I have a small GTC Buy in for TPZ at $18.50-$19.00/share as a way to play the
Oil & NG sell off.

On an energy rebound, I would think the equity might bounce faster giving

From:E_K_S
High CusterInvestor - It's not worth paying the premium for SRV IMO. To do a
profitable trade you need to time the bottom of the Oil price drop (not
exactly) so you can participate in the reflex rally. By approaching this from a
value perspective, you have a bit more safety and flexibility with TPZ (because
of their low use of leverage) and you typically are buying at a discount to
it's NAV. Therefore there is more of a "level of safety" to the TPZ buy rather
than the SRV buy.

I always try to error on safety and value. If I have to stay in the trade
longer than I expect , I was able to buy in at a discount to NAV that generates
a good yield so it can be held if the market freezes up. There is less risk in
holding a fund than a specific stock so you are not going to have the dividend
disappear either.

It's still a bit early for a TPZ trade but one to watch in the next few days or
weeks.

They also have the most complete set of products in many of their business

Buffett Adds Tesco Shares to Basket 
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204422404576594510606269894.html

From the article:"...Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Buffett's investment vehicle,
bought 34 million shares in the group in the last week of August, valued at
around &#163;120 million ($185.5 million) at the time, raising its stake in the
group to 3.64% from 3.21%, the person said...".

TESCO PLC SPONS ADR (Other OTC: TSCDY.PK ) - Maybe I should buy back the few
shares I sold 8/29 for $18.29/share. It's been over 31 days.

I actually like SVU better but am bullish on the entire sector especially in a
slow growth economy. The key is to buy at the right PE (less than 10 is good).
TSCDY's PE is 11.63 w/ a forward PE of 10.63. I will add this name to my retail
watch list since Buffet likes the name. However, I will be looking for an entry
point in the $15.00/share price range. Stock tested a 52wk low of $16.25/share
on 9/22/2011. The stock did trade in the $12.00/share to $16.00/share range in
the 2008-2009 time period.
