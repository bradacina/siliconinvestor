From a Bill Gross roundtable interview in Barrons

My other pick is a company that borrows short, relatively safely. It owns
government-agency mortgages and borrows against them at about 25 basis points,
which is the real thrust for both of these investments. The company is
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=NLY [NLY], a
mortgage REIT [real-estate investment trust]. It has a $12 billion market cap.
The problem with Annaly is that the stock can go down if the company's repo
capabilities [its ability to borrow short term using repurchase agreements] are
diminished. That happened in 2008 when none of the banks or investment banks
would take agency mortgages as collateral.

Where is Annaly trading?

Gross: It's at 17.75. The stock can't go up much because the minute the price
gets above book value the company issues stock, as it did in late December.
This is a dividend-earning vehicle. You wouldn't look for Annaly to rise from
17.75 to 22.50 in 12 months. But it produces a 14.5% yield. This is a finance
company like AmEx or GMAC or
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=CIT [CIT],
although CIT is lower-quality than Annaly.

Annaly is changing its personality a little bit, so it has to be watched. But
for the most part it owns government-agency-guaranteed mortgages. We're not
talking subprime mortgages here. We are talking about floating-rate adjustable
mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and you and me, the taxpayers.
What they own isn't really subject to default risk. It is subject to a lag in
interest rates. The rates on these mortgages adjust every six to 12 to 18
months. If interest rates went up by two percentage points tomorrow, Annaly's
cost of funding would go up by that amount, but the rates on the mortgages it
holds would go up 12 to 18 to 24 months later and the company would have to cut
its dividend. So there are risks here, but not in terms of the creditworthiness
of the collateral. It is more in terms of the cost of financing, which gets
back to my original thesis: the benefits of borrowing at negative real interest
rates.

Annaly has a book value of about $16 a share. You are basically buying it at
book, and giving the company the privilege of investing money for you, levering
it 5-to-1, and offering you a 14.5% dividend yield. In the absence of another
crisis, you'll do well.

Thank you, Bill.

Welcome to the thread, Fred Rhodes.

I'm pulling stocks to buy from a watch list I maintain and from my current
holdings, also from the new lows lists, from brokerage firms that provide
research screens, from AAII screens, and from ideas other people on SI offer.

Regarding Terra Nitrogen: Fwiw, I hold a few shares of CF. I've given up my
YARIY.pk shares today though. They reported lower than expected earnings in
July; apparently they're in drought areas, and farmers just aren't planting
enough. Perhaps YARIY.pk might be a buy on the expectation the next growing
season will be better.
I decided if I am going to wait for a turn-around in the ag business, I'd
rather wait with a domestic company, and with a company that's less complicated
to me than something like YARIY. Terra too complicated for me to figure also.

Fwiw, I raised my position in SENEA today. (Seneca Foods Corporation engages in
the production and distribution of processed fruits and vegetables, frozen
vegetables, and other food products in the United States.)

2VQLv7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTExOGsxN3VxBHBvcwM5BHNlYwN5ZmlUYWJsaXN0BHNsawNkZXRhaWxlZA--

I like SENEA based on stated book value (bv). It's had steadily rising bv since
'02, and in good times should sell again at .95-1.00x. Stated bv (per Yahoo) is
$28.93/sh. The stock closed at $22.35.

I am doing a bit of reading of GRVY. I've not done any of the fundamental
calculations but I've come across some concerning things:

1. The PFIC thing. Does anyone know how this affects Canadian investors?
2. The fact that another publicly traded company on the Japanese exchange,
GungHo, owns nearly 60% of the common stocks of GRVY. This company is also an
online games developer and distributor, just like GRVY, which is a giant
conflict of interest. I haven't had time to do more research on GungHo yet, but
I'll keep an eye out. Has anyone heard anything about GungHo in regards to
GRVY?
3. The major income source for GRVY is Ragnarok online, which is an ok game,
and seems to be doing the best in Japan, which is their major market. The
sequel hasn't come out yet and I haven't heard much about it in the press. I
wonder if it can compete vs other large games like WoW. If Ragnarok fails, GRVY
is toast.
4. They seem to have bad relationships with their major minority shareholders.
Given this, they have no business insurance. This looks like a risky situation.

I'm gunshy about approaching this company for an investment. It seems it just
has a whole lot of money that it doesn't know what to do with. Anyone else care
to share their assessment?

>>What else should I do, and where else should I look, when searching for and
evaluating value stocks?<<

Here is what I do:
1) I follow several investing threads. I get many of the best ideas from other
posters.
2) I use screener every once in a while. I also work a lot with yahoo finance
even though they work hard on making it less and less useful.
3) I identify themes or sectors I want to be invested in and then try to find
stocks to buy - anywhere in the world (Japan, Europe, US etc.)
4) I try to find special situation and invest in stocks that are beating down
due to temporary impairments
5) I keep an eye or two on macro.

I think psychological contrianism is OK but can be dangerous. Contemplate the
following situation - you are in a fully occupied movie theater near the exit
door and someone cries "FIRE!". You think that there is no fire (but you cannot
be totally sure too since the theater is fairly dark. Now what are you going to
do - in this case the best thing is often to run for the exit. Why- if you are
correct and there is no, you may still get overrun by the crowd that tries to
run for the exit. if you are not correct and there is a fire, you are better of
running too.

This is simplified of course, but I as an investor always like to think that I
am the guy close to the exit - my position are small, relative to daily volume
so I can sell or buy at market almost as I wish. The big institutional
investors cannot do that - their positions are too large. So, if you think that
there may be a calamity (the debt ceiling was a rather good example because it
was visible to everyone, it is a good idea to step aside in many cases. I did
follow my own thinking but not enough <g>.

I also think that GLD is a similar thing, just in reverse - you are betting on
a panic that may entice people to buy Gold. However at this point it is a Momo
play and an mature one at that - just remember that when somebody cries fire
(or SELL GOLD!).

Hi gcrispan -

I put in a tracking order in for CSCO at $13.65 as I do believe there is value
especially once the company gets focused again on their profitable product
line(s). They need to cut back on their future acquisition buys and streamline
their product development cycle so new products (and upgrades) are delivered to
the customer in a timely and efficient manner. Perhaps they can expand their
service division similar to what IBM has done. This would get them closer to
their end users as well as become a sizable profit center.

d9oLv7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTEydDA3OGxkBHBvcwMxMQRzZWMDeWZpVGFibGlzdARzbGsDZGV0YWlsZWQ-

I sold 40% on my INTC and will take part of the proceeds and move them into
CSCO. I plan to re enter the rest back into INTC below $19.00/share where my
other buys were I also have interest in adding to my MSFT at prices below
$24.00/share.

You need all three of these technology companies to become an efficient global
competitor. They all have significant cash hoards, pay a dividend, sell below a
10PE and IMO are in "Value" Buy territory.

I am trying to identify the companies that will lead us out of this recession.
Generally it is always a different group based on a different theme. I am
speculating that the next group will be those companies that provide products
and services that produces and deliver AG products globally. The key is to find
these companies at a "value" price (PE below 10) that provide a significant
value added service or product which increases the efficiency (and/or
sustainability) of this limited resource (food).

All of the companies listed above sell at a PE of 9 or less, do not carry too
much LT debt when compared to their annual net income and provide a product or
service to the AG sector. I am still adding new names to my AG basket as I
discover them but many of them do not have the "Value" characteristics that I
require (like low LT debt).

One thing I am focused on are finding those companies that drop in price on low
volume on big sell off days and participate in the bounce back rallies with
larger than normal % up moves on heavy volume. OME was up 22.5% yesterday on
the 429 point up move on the DOW. The stock touched it's 200 day MA (briefly)
but is still near it's 52wk high.

Several of the AG producing companies/divisions have operations in South
America. Brazil, because of their huge commodity exposure is down over 35% YTD
and could present a buying opportunity in this next cycle. Therefore, I have
been focused on those AG companies that have some exposure to Brazil and/or are
establishing new operations in Brazil as I believe the current prices represent
a good value entry point

Grommit brings a really good point, which leads me to the following thought -
if the market goes down hypothetically 50%, I would need a 100% return on the
way back to make up the loss or that's a 100% of make-whole movement instead of
pure profit. My experience of March 2009 was that I was fully invested 2 months
prior to the bottom and had nothing to bet with - there are two losses in my
mind: capital loss and opportunity loss. I don't know know how to prevent
either, but some cash helps me minimize the latter.

CSCO certainly hits all of the value metrics with its financials. It's a cheap
stock. I am not so sanguine about the competitive landscape. Competition
against Huawei will increasingly threaten margins. Since the future growth
areas will be Asia, not the US or Europe, this will put a crimp on CSCO's
bottom line. Below is a link to Huawei's ambitious plans.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-08/huawei-moves-up-the-food-chain-in-cisc

I find CSCO interesting. I do have a bias against large tech companies as I
believe they are not shareholder friendly. CSCO, in particular, sits on a
mountain of cash and yet pays a paltry dividend. With nearly five dollars in
net cash and 1.50 in free cash flow, they could reward the shareholder with a
larger dividend during this downturn.

My experience of March 2009 was that I was fully invested 2 months prior to the
bottom and had nothing to bet with - there are two losses in my mind: capital
loss and opportunity loss.

And both are only known in the hindsight.

OK, I am not for 100% stock-0% cash allocations. However, it is stupid when
people say "oh, if only I didn't put all my cash into stocks in Jan 2009, I
coulda bought at bottom in March 2009". No, in Jan 2009 you did not know that
the bottom will be in March. And in March, you did not know either that it was
the bottom and that market won't go lower in May. So you only could have had
20% cash in January and 0% cash in March by chance.

There are 3 feasible approaches:
- You spend cash while market is dropping. You are very likely to be out of
cash before bottom. (I am somewhat in this camp).
- You never go below X% cash. (Buffett is in this camp). Well, you will have
cash at the bottom, but it will stay cash, so you can't boast that you bought
at the bottom.
- You only spend cash when the market is recovering after bottom. (Dale is in
this camp, AFAIK). Once again, you won't have bought at the bottom.

In all three scenarios you have similar experience as you had in March 2009.

Anyone who says that they had 50% cash and spent it all at the exact bottom is
either extremely lucky or boasting at the party. It is not believable and even
if it's a fact, it's not repeatable.

Sure, you can try to distribute cash spending so that you won't run out of it
today or this week. But if the downturn takes 6-9 months like it was in
2008-2009, it's very likely that you either will run out of cash before bottom
or that you will have cash during the bottom and after it and it won't be all
used for investments at cheapest price.

And coming back to your statement:
opportunity loss - yes, but hitting the bottom is not opportunity, it's winning
the lottery chance.
capital loss - no, if you did not sell at the bottom. You would not call it
capital loss if stock went from $10 to $12 and you bought it there and it went
to $15, so why would you call it capital loss if stock was at $12, you bought
it and then it went to $10 and back to $15?

- You only spend cash when the market is recovering after bottom. (Dale is in

Not quite - I look for some signs that the panicked mass dumping of stocks has
passed, and we are bumping along a bottom of sorts. While that condition is
being formed, I will be nibbling here and there if I think a stock is
objectively cheap regardless of market conditions.

My cash level was 42% on 10/31/2008 and down to 14% by 3/1/09. The difference
this time around is that I am almost 60% cash much, much earlier. The goal is
to limit losses in a bear market correction (which I consider this to be) and
have a big store of dry powder for a multimonth buy period once the panic burns
out.

Good response - your 3 choices def make me think more about this,

I just want to clarify the final point between opportunity loss vs capital
loss. In March 2009 when fully invested, the choice I would have had is either
a) sell something I had bought few months earlier at a loss to buy something I
like better now or b) forgo the stock that I really liked given the new
opportunity. Maybe that's an easier choice when you have obvious losers.

I agree with you that you can't time the market and that's the last thing I'm
trying to do, but opportunity cost is not timing it but seeing something that
is even more misvalued (either on the up or down) - otherwise the moment you
become fully invested you've already called the bottom, hence you are playing
the lottery that you've already had your best shot.

Re: Electronic Control Security Inc. (EKCS.OB)

One big seller today @ $0.21/share moving the stock down 10%. I am still quite
positive on their next quarterly report and am anxious to see how many new
government contracts they landed. Stock selling below BV and if their earnings
come in as I expect should be selling below 10 PE.

Stock not very liquid and could be considered a lottery ticket or a very cheap
option (which should not expire). I still see $0.48/share as the possible
upside for this stock. September 22, 2011 is when they report their FY annual

DuPont Fabros Technology, 7.625% Series B Cumul Redeem Perp Preferred Stock
http://www.quantumonline.com/search.cfm?tickersymbol=DFT-A&sopt=symbol

Preferred shares had a trade @ $23.00/share which translates into an 8.576%
yield. I now have a GTC bid in @ $22.00/share if anybody wants out. Issues can
not be called through 10/2015, sector is very strong (all my Data Center REITs
positive today) and that yield is quite attractive.

Stock tanked to $3.00/share in February 2009 and rebounded to over $23.00/share
when the preferreds were first offered. On 8/8/2011 the Series B traded down to
$23.10/share an effective yield just over 9%. There were only 7K shares traded
but shows how illiquid they are when the buyers dry up.

This is a pretty good series of preferreds to put in the basket on yields over
8.5%.

I didn't think of it this way - good point...

I think you suggest that cash should only be considered medium between asset
classes and is itself zero value asset class (correct me if I'm understanding
it wrong) - if not zero, it definitely has destructive value. Of course other
assets could be more destructive, but the assumption is that the market always
provides a better opportunity . Maybe the only exceptions would be at the
market extremes (lows/highs), but that's timing the market. But how could we
preserve capital if we are not aware of those extremes? Should I ever keep

Cisco Profit Tops Analysts Estimates

From the article:"...Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), the world’s largest maker of
networking equipment, reported profit that beat estimates as the company reined
in expenses while refocusing on its high-margin routers and switches. The
shares soared.

Excluding some costs, profit was 40 cents a share in the fiscal fourth quarter,
Cisco said today in a statement. Analysts had predicted 38 cents on average,
according to Bloomberg data. Sales rose 3.3 percent to $11.2 billion in the
period, which ended July 30, compared with an estimate of $11 billion....".

Stock up 8.52% in AH to $14.90/share. I got too fancy w/ my low ball tracking
order which was at $13.75/share that I later changed to $13.65/share. Stock hit

My experience of March 2009 was that I was fully invested 2 months prior to the
bottom and had nothing to bet with

Difco,

Bingo - I agree. My tendency is to pull the trigger too fast and I have to
fight that urge. There's no worse feeling than being out of ammo as valuations
pass "cheap" and "stupid cheap" into the "ridiculously cheap" range. Like
yourself, studying past trades has told me I tend to buy too fast on the way
down. Even trades that work out very well for me could've been so much better
if I was just slower about buying into aggressively down markets. I would
ALWAYS run out of cash before the market ran out of DOWN.

Market timing may be impossible, but the recognition that I tend to be
"over-optimistic" during market collapses is something I _can_ guard against.
They generally last longer than I expect, and tend to fall farther than I
think. A big part of investing is understanding our incorrect tendencies and
your observation is dead on in my view.

That said, this is the first market panic where I've luckily been positioned
with a large chunk of cash (I'm sitting well over 50% cash right now) so my
emotions are very different than in previous collapses. I'm in uncharted ground
because my emotional detectors are all messed up - these kindof drops used to
dumbfounding to me - I'd be like a deer in headlights without a plan except to
ride it out and take my losses. Now I'm almost eager to put money in - but
based on previous collapses that's telling me I haven't waited enough. Previous
bottoms have a selling fatigue about them that hasn't had a time to develop -
that "just get me out - I don't care - just make the losses stop" feeling about
them.

Maybe it's because of my different cash positioning that my emotions are
mis-calibrated this time, but I feel I have to pace myself, lower my buy sizes,
set a phased multi-month buy plan - pick up cheap stuff when I can - maybe sell
some rallies. I even purchased a short fund the other day to make my position a
bit more market neutral (I'd never done that)... but overall trying to stay
small, small small until that capitulation/fatigue sets in.

Long: AAPL, EBIX, TEO, CHL, and INTC right now. Added a bit to TEO the other
day during a big drop but consciously reduced the buy size to address my
tendency. (EBIX is the one that's really killing me - but I can't bring myself
to break up with her.)

anyhow, all imho

Unfortunately it is one of my largest positions. I have a buy order in for some
STT at lower prices (which I hope we are not going to see, but who knows). I
remain my these that the trust banks STT and BK are invulnerable to credit

I disagree with Paul. Selling equities and keeping cash can be market timing,
but it also can be portfolio allocation (where you decide that you keep X% in

This has been an excellent discussion - a lot of viewpoints and I don't think
anybody is necessarily wrong, it's more of a preference and comfort level...

We're all allocating capital under different approaches to achieve maximum
absolute level of return, so however you do it as long as it works you've done
well.

My personal view is best summarized by the following experience: I had owned
Amex (NYSE:AXP) at an average cost of about $30 back in early 2009 and in
February of 2009 I really liked BNSF (former NYSE:BNI), so I sold out of AXP in
the teens to buy BNI. BNI did well due to the later acquisition by BRK, but I
missed a lot on my AXP investment. Personally, I find it hard to make such
decisions of picking my "favorite" stock in a declining environment and rather
have the option not to choose, but simply buy. The decline in AXP had
manifested itself in a reduction of purchasing power, which also limited my
upside on BNI.

Hi Kid -

Welcome to the Value Investing Board. Good call on SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU). Have
you arrived at a fair value for this company. I have been wrong on this one for
many years but actually have mad a little money buying shares on the way down
and selling them on the surprise pops to the upside.

Earlier this week, I increased my position by 63% thinking this was a pretty
good entry point w/ a Forward PE around 5 and more importantly excellent FCF to
cover LT debt (to spare). I have put this in my AG basket as the company has a
profitable Food distribution business in the U.S. which I value at $3.00/share.
I also view the company as a defensive holding especially in a low growth
environment. People have to eat and buy groceries.

I am looking for a fair value price around $15.00/share - $17.00/share over
three to five years especially as they pay down their debt and real estate
values stabilize (SVU own a lot of real estate). The key is for them to keep
generating that FCF and building their distribution business and their
Save-A-Lot stores.

According to their last 10Q "...Fiscal 2012 total debt reduction is estimated
to be approximately $500 to $550...." which translates to $2.61/share. BV at
$6.68/share (according to YAHOO Finance) would then increase to $9.29/share.

Seems like a low risk high return value opportunity (potential 212% return
$7.00/share to $16.00/share) w/ a 5% dividend while you wait.

Switching is always fraught with difficulty and risk. I sold a bunch of
companies during 2009 slump at low prices (including AXP at some point). In
some cases the switch worked. In some it didn't. Like I mentioned earlier on
this thread, buying BRK in 2009 bottom was a bad decision, since it never even
doubled unlike some other companies that went 3x-10x (including AXP ;)).
Unfortunately, predicting which stock out of two undervalued ones will perform
better is very tough IMHO.

Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)
By: Zacks Equity Research
August 11, 2011
http://www.zacks.com/commentary/18484/Archer+Daniels+Midland+%28ADM%29

From the article:"...We recently downgraded our recommendation on Archer
Daniels Midland (ADM - Analyst Report) to Underperform following a lower-than-
expected fourth-quarter 2011 results. ADM's quarterly earnings of $0.58 per
share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.84 and dropped almost 16% from
the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a higher income tax rate.

Although, <u>ADM is expanding its global footprint into key agriculture regions
through acquisitions and joint ventures, the resourcing of commodities and
stringent external finance may pose a threat to its operating performance.</u>
Moreover, intense competition and adverse currency fluctuations may undermine
the company's long-term initiatives and dampen the financials of the company.

Our long-term Underperform recommendation on the stock indicates that it would
perform below the broader market. Our target price of $25.00, 7.8x 2012 EPS,
reflects this view...."

---------------------------------------------------------------------

It seems to me this is exactly what they should be doing especially when the
FED has announced they plan to keep interest rates at 0 for the next 24 months.
Their financing alternatives could not be any better in the cycle. With a
Forward PE of 7 and a pretty conservative debt profile (Annual Net Income/LT
Debt <5), I see this as a good value opportunity at current prices.

Upped my small tracking position by 100% and put this one into my AG basket.
Will double my holding if this one sells below $25 as the article suggests.

Had an expectation when BRK was bought. BRK maybe met that expectation? Other

Was it therefore a bad decision to buy BRK? Or was it the right stock for the

Or was it that the expectation changed?

Maybe it's a matter of viewpoint or perception and adjusting expectations. If
I'm a salaryman and I work hard and I expect to get a 5-6% annual raise, and I
get a 12% raise, I'm very satisfied. Maybe only though until I find out some of

I assume that as you pay down your debt, BV increases by the same amount since
your liabilities are being reduced. Share amount stays the same but liabilities
go down. In SVU's case that's $550M. They have 212M shares so that's an
increase in value by $2.29/share.

It's similar to paying off a mortgage over thirty years. When you make the last
payment you own the home free and clear. I am assuming that SVU is paying down
principle so it's possible that the amount they state in their 10K also
includes interest then the actual debt payed down would be less. In either case
it is large (relative to the shares outstanding).

What is encouraging is their new CEO has been very consistent in paying down
their enormous debt incurred from the Albertson's acquisition done 6/2006.
Since his tenure, he has already whittle down $1B of the $7B in debt at close
to $500M/year.

What's your take? Many here have stated that SUV is a value trap. I think the
company will be 50% higher rather than 50% lower from the current market price
of $7.20/share.

Paul,

Even though I make fun of "performance", in the end performance is the only
thing that matters (to me ;)). So if I could go back to the past and switch
from BRK to $$$$ stock that went up 10x, I would do it without thinking.

Sure, one can make all kind of explanations and justifications why BRK was a
good choice/investment then. It was more stable, it was less likely to go
kaboom/BK, it is a great company run by a great CEO, and so on. And you are
right that some of these explanations/justifications are forgotten post-factum
and that they matter in some way. Professional portfolio managers would talk
about risk/volatility/beta/sector allocations, etc. There is some reason in
that too.

Do I complain that I bought and held BRK? Not really. I am just using it as an
example how it is very difficult to pick the best performers. I think you said
that yourself about the stocks you "favor" - that they don't necessarily end up
your best performers. :) So the switches to/from things sometimes are just
futile. And if they don't work out performance-wise, they are sometimes
rationalized/justified post factum, which is bad.

Maybe in other words: if someone chooses to invest in AAAA vs. BBBB and says at
that moment that they are choosing low volatility/less risk/great company and
are potentially sacrificing better performance in BBBB, then it's fine. If
someone invests in AAAA vs. BBBB on hunch or thinking that AAAA will outperform
BBBB and then two years later looks back and sees that BBBB outperformed AAAA
and starts looking for another justification why he bought AAAA, then it's
probably not very useful or productive.

You are right, they have payed about 2 billion of debt in the last 4 years, but

more shares at a price above book value and pay debt. But if you use your cash
to pay debt book value will not increase. In fact their book value has
increased from minus 3 B to minus 1.8 B. This is if you deduct the good will
and intangible assets, If you don't deduct good will and intangibles, the book
value has decreased from about 5.9 B to 1.3B.

Caterpillar And Navistar To Pursue Strategic Alliance
Cat And Navistar To Focus On Global Truck Business And Cooperate On Engine
Technologies
http://www.midnighttrucking.com/Article.asp?id=786021&spid=26831

From the article:"...Under the alliance, Caterpillar and Navistar plan to
cooperate on engine development, incorporating "best in class" technologies
from both companies. Caterpillar and Navistar intend to work together on
development of mid-range engines for diesel applications, such as school buses
and utility trucks. This engine development would support each company's stated
path not to utilize urea-based Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology.

"There are many opportunities for technology sharing and development that would
result in the ability to better meet the worldwide demand for diesel engines in
both on and off-highway applications," said Jack Allen, President, Navistar
Engine Group...."

I know that Europe has been a leader in diesel engine design and efficiency and
really do not know who will be the leader in the next generation technologies
for heavy duty trucks. CAT must have some confidence in NAV's new heavy duty
engine designs to enter into the strategic relationship described in the

Thanks Paul - I didn't know it. How long have you been following it? I'll read
through the 10-K as I'm learning more about the industry and hopefully it dips
at some point.

I have not sold any shares in gure so i have my full position. I contacted this
organization and was not particularly impressed with either their response or
use of english. I kind it more than difficult to believe that this short seller
has it right and that two cpa firms, fidelity, and brean murray analyst who
looked at their facilities have it wrong. It may take a few years but i am
hopefully that this will sort itself out eventually and that the company has
done something useful with the $85 million it got from their last issuance of
shares.

I do not believe in cash in the investment account, unless you are prescient
enough to see a correction coming. If you do see one coming, and have
confidence, then sell half your portfolio or more. But don't just sit with 10
or 20% cash all the time because crashes sometimes come.

When a crash occurs, sure you do not have cash. But you have your holdings.
Some will be holding up well, and others will be tremendously down. So sell
some of the stocks holding up well and buy some of the better bargains. This
approach works a lot better if you are able to be on the computer during the
market day to make some moves quickly.

Geoffrey Wren, what's the reasoning that you'd sell the stocks that are holding
up well, assuming you even had some of those in a crash. Right then, if such
stocks are doing relatively well or absolutely well, the market's telling you
or agreeing with you that it believes you are right to hold such stocks. Why
wouldn't you instead sell losers that look like they might not recover? Or look
like they might recover much more slowly than other more attractively-priced
stocks you could exchange them for?

Would you call it value investing if, to use your approach, "it works a lot
better if you are able to be on the computer during the market day to make some
moves quickly."? That's depending on market-timing, prescient buys (or sells) ,
wouldn't you say?

Not saying your approach doesn't work or isn't effective. Seems like some of
the suggestions though (sell 1/2 your position if you see a market correction
coming) are more market timing than value investing. Which may be appropriate
to the situation, or maybe even the best strategy, I don't know.

Another bad feeling would be to miss the boat on the turnaround? How do you
know that 50% cash is the right call at this point in time? How sure can you be
that things will get "stupid cheap"?

I don't. Nobody does. what my post was trying to convey was that my tendency is
to move in too fast - always has worked that way for me - so I'm trying to
correct for my incorrect tendency. I'm trying to be more patient deploying cash
this time. I could be totally wrong :-)

Paul,
From what I have read so far, even value investors get out of the market if
they consider it overvalued. Buffet in his early years for example. I still
cannot understand how they were considering the market overvalued. Buffet could
not find companies that he would invest in and he dissolved his partnership.
Benjamin Graham had a formula. Mr. Womack was looking at the panic as a sign to
buy and the exuberance as a sign to sell. Some american president (forgot his
name) got out of the market before the crush in 1923 when the boy who was
polishing his shoes gave him a stock tip. Jurgis once said that his wife wanted
to invest and for him this was a sign... I personally got out when i read about
mr. Womack and the letters of Jeremy Grantham to his shareholders.
Just my observation...

Yes, Mr. Gogo, when the market's overvalued, getting out. I'm with NikhilJog
and others: this is not a market that's overvalued to be gotten out of. It's a
beat up market that has many value stocks, and so to be going into, not out of.

Paul:

I was referring to crazy days when apparently fantastic buys are available.
People say they have no cash. But they can raise cash by selling something that
is more reasonably priced. Stock picking individuals are always choosing among
stocks in investing. Pretty much anytime I buy something I am selling something
else to do it. Normally that might be a weeklong process. All that gets
compressed in crazy days.

I will give an example of something I did on Tuesday (or was it Monday). UMH
was holding up well. I checked and it was down something like 10% in the
correction that started last Friday, while CWH was down 30% or so (I own both
stocks and so previously had an understaning of them). Now one might say this
was rapid efficient market adjustments and that CWH was more exposed to a
financial meltdown. But I feel that the efficient market theory loses traction
in flash crashes, especially for thinly traded stocks, and we should look upon
those times as opportunities even while our stomachs turn in seeing all the red
on the holdings page. My feeling was that CWH had become a relatively better
holding and sold some UMH and bought CWH. So far it has worked out. It was a
gamble, but so was doing nothing.

Anyway my point is that if you think a stock is ridiculously underpriced, then
sell another stock that you think is just somewhat underpriced to buy it.

More generally, I was not advocating market timing. My point was that holding a
large cash reserve is sort of like betting on both black and red at the
roulette wheel. If the wheel is tilted and you think you see a pattern, then
make up your mind and just bet one color. Another point I would make is many
bonds have stable enough prices. Such a bond is near enough to cash and should
be sold if one sees opportunity.

Thanks for your comments. This is a worthwhile board. One of these days I
suspect I will be buying SVU which gets a mention here from time to time.

To all: Discussion over cash holdings continues...

On December 17, 1959 Ben Graham delivered a speech at UCLA with the topic:
"Stock Market Warning: Danger Ahead!" At the time he compared the PE ratio of
18.2x to the 1929 high of 19.0x and stated that "The more it changes the more
it's the same thing." He was a decade early!

On May 29, 1969 Warren Buffett wrote a letter to his partners that he's
liquidating the partnerships as he was discouraged by the investing
environment. At the time, Buffett said he would put much of his own money in
municipal bonds. He was about 3 years early!

From this we can derive the following:
<ul><li>value investors move into a defensive position when the market is at a
high</li><li>value investors are often early (same thing on the buy side - so
if you feel you buy early, you are in good company)</li></ul>How about on the
way down:

In 1929 Ben Graham did fine, but he didn't foresee the 1929-1932 fall the
followed. It took him until 1937 to restore his financial position as it was in
1929.

In 1974 Warren Buffett was buying so much that he said the following: "I'd run
of of gas. I has used all the $16 million of cash I got out of the partnership
to buy stock in Berkshire and Blue Chip. So all of a sudden I woke up one day
and had no money at all."

It's harder for me to conclude on this, but it seems that from this experience
Buffett felt that money is never enough during the downturn and at some point
you'll run out of it.

IMO everybody on this thread does a good job excluding the overall market and
instead we focus on the market of specific securities we know enough about that
we could estimate a margin of safety.

For example, Paul and I, we like Volkswagen a lot: back in 2009 it declared
plans by the year 2018 to become the largest auto manufacturer in the world
(i.e. production of about 10 million cars a year) and achieve an operating
profit margin of 8% (it has since revised that it would achieve it probably by
2015). At the time most people thought this was crazy, but looking closer at
the numbers I figure that the Germans know what they are talking about. First,
VW was the first foreign car manufacturer to enter China back in the 1980s,
thus has an established position and name. It also has entered the Indian
market through its 19.9% ownership in Suzuki and its sales in the US are less
than 200,000; this spells growth. If VW is correct and if we assume that the
average price of all its vehicles would be 25,000 euros and it sells 10 million
of them - this results into 250 billion euros in annual sales. When we apply
the 8% of operating profit margin, this yields 20 billion. If 50% of that goes
for interest expense and taxes, we're still left with 10 billion euros. Last
year's profit was 7.2 billion euros, so it's not that unrealistic. When you
consider a cash pile of 20 billion euros sitting on the balance sheet, the
current valuation of 50 billion euros starts to look silly - but that's based
on my assumptions. So at these levels it's a buy and I really don't care if it
goes much lower because I plan to stick to it. (Remember that this is a
cyclical, so if the world economy turns sour, autos will be some of the first
to go down and figuring out when to sell on the way up won't be easy either and
also if the euro goes down we'll be scooping up the shares with cheap euros).
Then why do I have cash equivalents - I like being liquid a bit and also I just
think I haven't had my best idea yet. This is a risky proposition, because I
might be waiting for a long time but hopefully not forever - I'm still debating
on how to approach that and this conversation has been a good medium.

re VW.D - the 20BEuro cash pile number is a little bit misleading - at least
the way I look at it the 20B Euro cannot be considered net cash. I see current
assets are roughly 87B Euro (including 17B Euro in inventory) and current
liabilities 77B Euro for a net of 10B Euro - if you consider inventories not as
an liquid asset (I don't)
there is actually 7 B Euro in net short term debt. Hardly a problem but it's
not like VW is sitting on a mountain of cash either. Also consider that they
did a capital raise of about 4 B Euro in 2010 (for 65 Euro).

Overall I agree with you regarding VW.DE bullish outlook. I just hope with all
that expansion drive that they find some Euro's for a generous buyout offer for
MAN <g>.

Cash holders have been severely punished during the 1974(1983)-2000 runup.

are=
^gspc;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;sou
ce=undefined Sure you had downdrafts, but if you held KO or SPY during that
time, you made out much better, while holding cash led to severe
underperformance. By 2000 nobody even thought about holding cash.

Looking at 2000-2011, holding cash was great for most of the decade. Especially
if you held it in bonds - bonds practically outperformed stocks. Plus you had
couple huge drops with no positive trendline for the market.

^gspc;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on

So currently 100% stocks - 0% cash folks are pretty discredited. Market
"timers", 80% stocks - 20-50% cash mixers and even 90%+ cash (gold!) bears have
much more credibility than 100%-stocks folks. I am surprised we got couple of
100%-stocks bulls on this thread. ;) I guess they have not capitulated yet,
they are not ready to throw in towel and so we are not yet at the moment when
100%-stocks will outperform everything for a long stretch. :)

Personally, I don't give a crap about ideological arguments. My best example is
last spring. I was forced to sell most of my portfolio due to account transfer.
I was lucky to have sold just before summer swoon. I'd rather be lucky like
this again than hold an ideological position that 20-50% cash is "market
timing", not "value investing" or some other odious personal habit that should
be shunned by gentile true investor's club. ;) If I had to summarize my
approach, I sell when things are overvalued and hold some cash until they
become undervalued. I try to "upgrade" my portfolio by switching to "better"
securities on drops. I try to leave some powder dry. But I break a lot of these
rules on various occasions. So sue me. :)

Clownbuck is correct - the cash position should only be taken as a cushion, not
as a pure value to be extracted. In such a capital intensive industry
liabilities will be always high. Thanks for the clarification.
