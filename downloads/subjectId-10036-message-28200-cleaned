We are on opposite sides of the trade on this, that's what makes a market. And,
I don't see all that much in terms of risk/reward. On a chart basis, my

That is, unless the US economy implodes, and the consumer runs away, which is,

I am not sure why you have different opinions about BRK and WSC. Most of WSC
earnings comes from its (re)insurance float invested by BRK (Buffett?
Simpson?). So if you think that WSC earnings are weak, you should say the same
about BRK. What am I missing? ;)

WSC. I'm not saying WSC is a bad investment. Only that I don't see it as good
enough to warrant establishing a supersize position in it. To me, for a
supersize position, I want to see very strong reward/risk ratio, and I don't
see that with WSC. For the reasons I mentioned.

With BRK, you get a company that's seemingly on the move - big - unique - in
catastrophe insurance, making big stock buys (e.g. with railroad stocks
recently), having potential acquisitions, in the news frequently, recommended
by professional value investors (e.g. with reports that fair value may exceed
$150k/sh). WSC just looks moribund. I don't see a catalyst, I don't see sales
growth, I don't see special niches.

That's jmo. From a surface look, and I admit I don't see that well. So I could
be wrong.

For me, I just don't see where WSC is a better value play at current price than
many other insurance stocks out there that I've purchased. Not saying it's
worse, just not better enough to attract me into a buy.

(Edit: I've no shares of Berkshire either.)

If you compare WSC to insurance stocks, the big advantage is that we know that
Munger (and Buffett) don't chase questionable insurance deals. If they don't
like the pricing, they walk away. This cannot be ascertained in any other
insurance companies.

I have not compared WSC to other insurance companies quantitatively though.

For me the most interesting is recent divergence of BRK and WSC. On one hand,
Munger was saying for years that WSC is not a "smaller Berkshire" and the
performance should diverge. On the other hand, it never happened up to now. So
the question is: has something changed or is the gap going to close again?

I cannot really understand why WSC is a separate company anyway. BRK owns 80%.
Munger probably spends more time at BRK than at WSC. It would be more efficient
to handle all the WSC float internally at BRK - it is already being invested by
BRK! I guess there is some issue regarding shareowners - Munger may not want to
haggle with Buffett over the price and low price would not be acceptable
maybe...

OK, let's ask another question: is WSC or BRK a better investment than SP500
index fund? Why or why not? ;) (Both companies have worse 5 year returns than
SP500).

It would be weird. WSC price is not in any way higher than historically. It has

the share price was "bid up" when stock is experiencing such mediocre returns,
then he would be saying that WSC intrinsic growth is much lower than S&P...

Hi rllee - Same type of move for AAV up 5.46%. There is chatter that based on
the $CAN now at parity with the $US, their current reserves translate into a
NAV around $19.23 US. Also, the dividend distributions to US holders are higher
this month because of the $US conversion even though the $CAN payout has
remained unchanged. Some investors feel that the underlining assets are
significantly undervalued and have been buying AAV shares.

The big move IMO is yet to come. NG prices need to increase to better reflect
the longterm price of the equivalent $mmBTU for oil. Based on the chart below,
Natural gas is selling for about half its value from December. The price per
BTU s/b roughly the same for NG and oil. At current prices, NG is 56% less
expensive than oil for the equivalent amount of BTU energy.

http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/05/natural_gas_and.html

The spot market prices (9/20/07) of the equivalent mmBTU: NG $6.18 vs oil
$14.14 mmBTU based on $82/barrel). (
http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/ngw/ngupdate.asp ) That's 2.29x more for oil
than for the equivalent BTUs in NG.

Many factors make up the total cost of each resource but it appears that the
current ratio of 2.29 $Oil/$NG seems to be at the high end of their historical
level.

Some economist even argue that a premium should be paid for NG because of it's
efficiencies over oil (less pollution, limited refining & processing, easy to
transport through pipes). Many of the large integrated oil companies are
expanding their refinery capacity and making huge capital investments that add
to their total cost of production for oil which they do not have to do for NG.
Therefore, looking forward, these efficiencies for NG should further promote
switching from the use of oil to NG.

I believe crude oil prices need to go down or NG prices need to move higher.
Time will tell where this eventually adjusts out. My guess is NG prices will
move substantially higher in the longer term.

If retail is going to crater, if the country is in serious trouble with
mortgage loans, job growth, cash-strapped consumers, then this stock too should
continue to fall.

I vote for muddle-through. Company has a good history of good profit margins,
roe, increasing book value. At current price, analysts (per Yahoo) give
consensus p/e of 8+. That makes the current stock price too cheap based on my
model (p/stated bv, p/e, etc., and which assumes no dastardly recession).
Kicker is that company will begin to pay 25% of earnings as dividend (approx

share swap valued at 1.25 billion dollars.

Both trusts are predominantly natural gas producers, and both have suffered
from low gas prices and a new tax on income trusts, announced last year...."

===============================================

It looks like Dhabi sees these Canadian properties as a good value. This
acquisition makes TAQA North one of the top 14 producers in Canada. They

JC feels that BBY is eating CC's lunch and dinner. He confirms what Jim Clarke

The primary reason he is bullish on BBY came from the conference call -
international growth. They have something like 15%-17% of total sales from the
international arena, and growing in a fairly rapid fashion. Hoping to have 50%
of sales from international in a few years.

If memory serves, Cramer said international is growing much faster than
domestic, with higher margins. That info can be gleaned from the conference

Is WSC cheaper than BRK?

OK. Quick and dirty round:

Yahoo numbers (not thoroughly checked but spot checked, so should OKish):

BRK
Market Cap (intraday)6: 180.84B
Enterprise Value (25-Sep-07)3: 167.83B
Trailing P/E (ttm, intraday): 14.95
Forward P/E (fye 31-Dec-08) 1: 19.30
Price/Sales (ttm): 1.62
Price/Book (mrq): 1.57
Enterprise Value/Revenue (ttm)3: 1.50
Enterprise Value/EBITDA (ttm)3: 7.9

WSC
Market Cap (intraday)6: 2.77B
Enterprise Value (25-Sep-07)3: 531.47M
Trailing P/E (ttm, intraday): 29.05
Forward P/E (fye 31-Dec-08) 1: N/A
Price/Sales (ttm): 4.63
Price/Book (mrq): 1.15
Enterprise Value/Revenue (ttm)3: 0.87
Enterprise Value/EBITDA (ttm)3: 2.848

So WSC is cheaper based on P/book, more expensive based on P/E and P/S.
Unfortunately, I don't think this tells much. You know yourself that Buffett
tells how lumpy BRK (and WSC?) earnings are. So I would discount P/E for BRK at
least. WSC P/E and P/S are not very good though, but this is partially
explained by cash on the balance sheet.

WSC is even more than BRK loaded with cash: it has ~$170 per share of cash,
which is almost half of the book value. This, of course, is not good for
investors, since half of the book is "unproductive" earning subpar returns. BRK
also has about 1/2 of book value in cash, but this is not directly comparable
to WSC, since BRK also has much more liabilities, some of which are not real
"liabilities" (per Buffett). Looking another way, WSC cash is ~1/2 of the
assets, while BRK cash is only ~20% of the assets. If Munger/Buffett could
deploy this cash somewhere, it would be great.

In general, both BRK and WSC are not easy to value: there are (re)insurance
operations and associated float, partial ownerships of businesses, etc. I don't
even believe that comparing to historical ratios is valid, since both companies
changed quite a bit in recent years. And therein lies conundrum: how to value
and compare both of them?

So here is where I stop for now. If you have any other metrics that would help
you to decide if WSC is cheaper than BRK, I could calculate them. Just let me
know. :) Any comments are welcome.

P.S. Actually, looking at recent history of WSC, I am not really sure what
Munger/Buffett are doing with it. If BRK is investing in PetroChina or
railroads or whatever, why WSC is not doing the same? If Munger is running his
own investment portfolio at WSC, shouldn't Buffett evaluate its performance and
withdraw WSCs cash for subpar investment returns (like he proclaims about his
other subsidiaries: if you cannot show that your cash earns certain rate of
return, you don't get to deploy it). As I mentioned before, the most logical
thing would be for BRK to buy the rest of WSC, pool the resources and be done
with it, but I believe some non-financial factors are preventing this.

I would appreciate if you pointed me to a reference to this quote.

If this is real, I am very surprised. Is Munger saying that WSC, which is one
the best-performing companies of all time, should be valued at lower than 1.3 x
book (which is what $438 is)? Of course, half of this book value is cash, but
still... this implies very low expectation for his own company?

Overall, thinking more, I am very surprised about how WSC is run. Buffett
always complains that BRK is too big, so he needs to do huge deals. Why doesn't
he do small deals through WSC then? If WSC did some great small deals, it could
have grown much faster - and given a nice boost to its parent BRK. And if he
does not do small deals through WSC, then why is it independent? It makes very
little sense... except perhaps as Munger's sandbox. But then why Munger does
not do more? Is he given total laissez faire from Buffett, but does not see any
great opportunities? This is probably the case, but it is still weird, since
Buffett told more than once that he could get great returns with smaller amount
of money. Now Munger HAS smaller amount, so why he does not get great returns
and is holding tons of cash? ;)

From Whitney Tilson's notes:

It’s been very awkward in my position. The truth of the matter is that
Berkshire is a better business operation by far. First of all, the guy there
[Buffett] is 76. The momentums are way better. That advantage of Berkshire has
increased. We would have long ago avoided this duplication except for people
like you. You bid Wesco so high that we’d be giving more than we’d be getting
if we merged Wesco into Berkshire. So people like you are responsible...

The entity that should be thinking about this is Wesco. It has a lot of
capital, capital gains taxes are at all-time low, and we don’t have the same
prospects as Berkshire, but you cult members make that hard to do because you
keep bidding up its shares above intrinsic value. Anyone who wants to leave can
sell above intrinsic value. Those of you holding the stock hope we can create
more than $1 of value [with each dollar of our retained earnings], and I’m
hopeful we can do this, though we won’t do as well as Berkshire.

OK, so the bearish position on WSC is presented in my previous post: Munger
does not consider Wesco an independent company and does not run it (in
investing its capital) as if it was one. On the other hand, he and Buffett are
not willing to merge it fully into BRK because they believe it is trading above
intrinsic value.

The bullish position is based on similar premise really: neither WSC nor BRK
will ever trade below intrinsic value (at least while Buffett/Munger are
alive), since the moment they do, BRK/WSC will start buying their own shares.
So the only opportunity for investors is to buy above intrinsic value or as
close to it as possible.

So I return to my original claim: WSC is now trading closer to the intrinsic
value than BRK, so it is a buy. The caveat that WSC is hamstringed by Munger's
dual-role in WSC/BRK remains...

Thanks for your good luck wishes. I've made enough investing that I "semi
retired" at 41 from HP where I did IC and fiber optics design in the R&D
department. I'm 50 now and still look for great value.

You are in good company with your beliefs about tech. Your comments remind me
of some other comments from some very famous people of the past:

"Everything that can be invented has been invented."
-Charles H. Duell, Commissioner, US Office of patents, 1899

"I think there is a world market for about 5 computers." 
-Thomas Watson, Chairman of IBM, 1943

"640K ought to be enough for anybody." 
-Bill Gates (Founder and CEO of Microsoft - 1981)

"Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?" -- H.M. Werner, Werner Brothers, 1927

I also heard those comments when I bought MSFT and Intel in the early 1990's...
who needs a better OS and 200MB/s for a processor should be good enough for
most folks. I worked for the current CEO of Agilent and he told me he thought
it was too risky to buy AMAT back in 1995... for a couple of bucks.... now AMAT
might be the next big solar play.

Good luck with your investment. I still think BRKA is over valued due to the
Buffett Premium. More at

Spekulatius,

Since you posted another bank stock, I thought I'd mention SSFC is trading in
low 7's with 0.40 dividend and book value at 8.52.

It is delisted (did transaction to go private this year), but financials are at
http://homesavingsbank.org/about_2.asp

Earnings are down, but basically no subprime exposure according to IR.
Underearned dividend last quarter, but no immediate intention of cutting the
dividend.

Might be one to track for tax loss selling as well.

Well, I already wished you good luck and I can repeat that again. I doubt we
can see eye-to-eye partially because I am not interested in LRCX (anymore) or
VRGY to argue about them more than that they are incomparable to BRK. You may
find it fine to throw out companies that don't even have 5 years of positive
earnings and compare them to one of the finest corporations ever. And these
companies might even perform well for a year or two. None of them are going to
grow and last for 40 years like BRK.

And note that I am not saying whether BRK is over or undervalued as I am not
saying anything about valuation of LRCX or VRGY.

Fair enough. I agree that BRKA has been a great investment. But, what do you
think about the Buffett Premium? What would it sell for if he is run over by a
bus tonight?

Also, the stock doesn't pay a dividend and its return on assets now tells me I
don't want to reinvest dividends... as Warren has been looking for "great
ideas" for a long time and he hasn't really hit any out of the park.

If he is not growing earnings and the return on assets is less than what I can
get in a CD, then isn't a big reason to own it... the safety... gone?

I know people follow Warren like a religion so it can be seen as a blasphemy
for doubting it can continue for another 40 years.... but hasn't Warren himself
said his stock is not a good deal?

FWIW, I don't hold on to my great GARP stocks forever... I usually take big
profits and spread the money into other stocks I hope will follow a similar
price trajectory. If I still like the company, I usually hold some "core
shares" but often I've taken two or three times my original investment out in
profits first. Quite often, they are very volatile so it makes sense and I
often get to do it for the same stock many times.

the second paragraph is quoted somewhat out of context and is a part of an
answer to a question "Will Berkshire ever pay out its excess capital?"

Yeah, I was a little lazy, but I don't think I distorted his meaning as to the
value of WSC relative to BRK.

So I return to my original claim: WSC is now trading closer to the intrinsic
value than BRK, so it is a buy.

Maybe you're right but I think it's pretty clear that Munger disagrees with
you. I also don't agree with your rationalization as to why they aren't folding
WSC into BRK. If they would really like to do it, and they think that both are
above IV but BRK is more above IV, why not just use BRK stock to acquire WSC?

I think that BRK would drop if Buffett died. I am not sure how much and whether
it would be a screaming buy at that time. I don't want to guess either. :) I'll
cross that bridge when it comes to me. ;)

BRK and WSC poor ROA/ROE is well known. There are couple explanations: high
cash position and rather complex balance and income sheets (for BRK only),
invisibility of "owners earnings" of investments and so on. You cannot judge
these companies by mechanical ROA/ROE without looking deeper. Unfortunately,
only very few people look deeper. Most invest on belief - or do not invest
after looking at superficial measures. I can't claim that I understand these
companies fully, although I have looked at them more than superficially.

I agree that a cash pile is somewhat an issue. Even more so for WSC which, if
it was independent of BRK, could probably find a lot of places to earn high
returns. BRK can be somewhat justified for holding all the cash to earn AAA
reputation and supercap reinsurance deals.

Regarding other stocks, I also invest in companies that I sell in 1-3 years (or
even months if they runup fast). I just don't compare them to BRK/WSC. IMHO,
only "ageless" companies like KO, PEP, maybe GE, JNJ, maybe C, AXP can be
directly compared to BRK/WSC. :)

As I said, I practically do not invest in companies that have less than 5 years
positive earnings and less than 15% ROE, so I cannot comment on LRCX or VRGY
valuations or attractiveness. :) (Although I had invested in SemiEquips in
90's, so I know the sector and I still believe they are more cyclical than
growth ;)).

I am not sure. I still think that WSC is Munger's sandbox. When he dies, it
obviously won't continue as independent company. Until then I think Buffett and
Munger spend very little thinking on folding WSC into BRK. If there was a
screaming discrepancy between the two, they might do it. Maybe they will now
that the gap is widening. Maybe they won't.

Did you understand what he meant about capital gains taxes? Did he mean that
because of BRK buyout WSC shareholders would have to pay capital gains or
something else? Or did he mean that WSC should just buy its own shares even
though that means cap gains tax for shareholders? It was somewhat cryptic...

Hey Paul,

As I said in a prior post, I owned a bunch of NAHC from $8 last summer and met
with the CFO (I think the buyback might have been a result of some of my own
and other investors prodding) but I am looking at it again as well.

Last summer I owned these stocks:

PKOH

NAHC

HAST

TBAC

------------------------------

I had a margin call, so I sold NAHC and PKOH. I am looking to reenter NAHC
right now.

Also, I am thinking of putting 30% of my holdings into DDS and selling the Jan
20 calls against it for $3....

Think HAST should keep working as HALO 3 and the huge blockbuster box office
slate hits their stores. Should be interesting, as according to my model the
company is worth $17.

DDS is surely worth $40 a share. If you sell calls all along the way, your
return per annum can be 20% or so with almost no risk.... that's my poker hand.
3 names. That's it. Wishing you "luck" (hard work, patience, valuation
analysis, tenacity, heart, courage, etc...)

Peace,

I've owned FRA and FRB, but not now. I own VVR, and have for a long time, in an

diversification within the fixed income sector.

JMO, but I don't think that now is the time to buy the floating rate senior
loan funds, with more rate cuts likely to come. They typically trade at a
discount to NAV, I'll have to go to etfconnect to see how much of a discount
currently.
Bond funds which will adjust less rapidly to a drop in interest rates would be
a better bet IMHO. It would be necessary to see the discount to NAV
historically, and you can see that, again, on etfconnect.

Such funds - floating rate, convertible, high income, etc. are difficult for me
to figure. There's the management fees - some fees being waved temporarily on
one of the funds (Eaton Vance?) I recently have been looking at some of the top
holdings of some funds where none or just a few of the stocks have high
dividend yields, yet the fund overall yields 8-10% say (on NAV). From which I
infer the fund must be using leverage in some way to get those high yields. And
then there are the individual stock holdings of the funds: lots of those stocks
I often already have. When I look at MY holdings of them, I'm willing to hold
the stocks, but have no desire to add to the positions. Which essentially I
would be doing if I bought some of these funds which have these stocks. And
where I feel the funds have got into these stocks well after I have (and at
higher prices).

The number of the funds from these asset managers is overwhelming. Just to toss
a few more into the thread now, I'll note I have a few shares of AGC, RWX, and
have IGR, NCZ, AVK, LCM on my watch list. (No particular reason for these last
four on a watch list now --- just that I found them soon after Aug 16 and have

Dividends would make sense, but then the rest of his sentence does not make

Added a bit to my small HTGC position.

I see nowhere any comment about about prospects for HTGC given its announced
sale of Sling Media.

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/070926/20070926005214.html?.v=1

I have to assume I'm missing some valuable information, and that possibly I'm
very wrong on what's happening. What "seems" to be occurring is that venture
fund HTGC is selling its holding of Sling Media for $380 Million.

Okay that is in cash + EchoStar options, and that $380M is what somebody in
management says the deal is worth. I don't know the cash/options ratio. (So I
am missing some important info.)

Nevertheless, ASSUMING Sling Media is totally owned by HTGC and that HTGC gets
the money (i.e. Sling Media management has HTGC options or other incentives
such that HTGC stockholders don't have to share the $380M with Sling Media
management), then $380M is one heck of a lot of value for HTGC which has a
market cap of just $430 Million (and $33M in debt, according to Yahoo).

HTGC's website portfolio contains a surprisingly large portfolio of companies
for such a small firm. I'll just guess and bet there could eventually be
another pony in their pile:

http://www.herculestech.com/portfolio/portfolio.asp?IndustryID=0&CompanyID=1802

At current price, a buyer of HTGC stock gets HTGC management's access to a
bunch of money (somewhere in that $380M), a swath of companies in HTGC's
portfolio, and a current 9% dividend yield while waiting for something else to
be monitized (another pony?).

Possibly I'm missing something --- some significant info. to obviate some of my
assumptions about cash inflows or prospects or something. I'll assume the $1.20
dividend might be solid and maybe provide a margin of safety though.

Well, 120M+45M is not that much even if you subtract it all from the remaining
asset value. ;) Though I may have already accounted for it, I'm not sure.

Being debt holder may be a way to go as is waiting "3-4 years". You are
gambling that the downturn will be very long and severe though. (And I am
gambling that it will be short and mellow ;)). If not, the stocks will recover
without bankruptcies and as a debt holder you won't benefit much.

Why I think the downturn will be short and mellow? I don't think the house
prices are extraordinarily out of whack. I don't know Florida (except for the
claims that prices already have fallen 50% in parts of it), but California (not
counting Silicon Valley and Golden Coast where prices won't fall unless we have
another super tech crash) is not that overpriced IMHO. LA for example seems to
be at 5-6% rental yield, which is not very bad IMHO in the current rate
environment. Other parts of the country are even cheaper from what I hear.
Expecting prices to drop another 50% to >10% rental yields is IMHO unrealistic.
Although possible if we get really bad/crazy seizure of mortgage market +
recession + some oil/terrorist/Katrina whatever calamity.

re: Contrarian Alert!

Since a contrarian investor makes investment decisions contrary to prevailing
beliefs—for example, buying when most other investors are pessimistic and
selling when most others are optimistic.

So when an alert is issued on a stock with prevailing downtrend -- ETFC, for
example, the alert should obviously be taken as a buy recommendation. At least,
I think so.

In order not to confuse anyone, I intend to change all "contrarian alerts" in

Jim Clarke, what sectors or stocks are you in that have caused this "horrible
six weeks"? I'm interested because their not having performed well coupled with
your analytical expertise to get into them in the first place - they may be
just the things to buy now. (I know,..er ..hope, you won't tell me it's
homebuilders.)

TLB Ach. After/or in midst of, heavy duty Italian spaghetti dinner with the
accompanying beverages, I reply:

"I got back into TLB today." If I can get tonight's closing price tomorrow, I
will add a little more to my few shares also.

"Very tiny position" . Agree. Control risk with position size. Small position
for me also. (We might be going into a recession, and the class of people who
shop at TLB might hold back.)

"I am not very comfortable with it." Of course. Who is? I cannot match comfort
to success. I.e. more comfort doesn't lead to better performance. Seems like
more discomfort leads to better results (sometimes).

"I sold a lot of stuff this week." Yes. Looked like the time for me too for a
few stocks, so I sold some stuff as well. (OTOH, I have a lot - a HUGE LOT - of
stuff I still want to hold.)

"...so I wanted to buy something too." Oh Zen student, it's your wants that
will lead you wrong. The stocks must come to you in the flow of life. (-g-)

 guess that depends on your definition of "mild". In most things I read here on
SI, people consider US the consumption engine of the world. thats why the trade
imbalance, weak dollar, etc. Our market seems to panic if GDP only raises 1%
Imagine how we would react if it fell 5%. Seems mild, is it? 

A recession with a 5% decline in GDP would exceed all of the worst US
recessions of 73-74 and 81-82 by at least 66% and those were considered severe
recessions. Possible I suppose but I envision something milder.. more like a
2001 redux.

 As standard of living increases people will buy food and better food.

Yes...

 Just because your laid off or downsized or get less hours, the last cutback is
likely food. 

For Americans ad Europeans, I agree... for many Asian countries (China,
India..) prosperity is very recent. Cutting back on meat during a severe
downturn would not be too hard for them to do. Metal consumption is more
predicated by governmental entities.... infrastructure build out is done
generally by spending other people's money. (And most importantly in China, it
creates jobs..)

 Remember the original statement bill made was hiding places. With the
historically high oil inventories (especially the US) Oil will plummet as
should most raw materials. 

Oil discoveries and greenfield mines for most metals are decidedly behind the
curve.. the articles I have read about high oil inventories do not take the
dramatic rise in total global consumption. Oil inventories in relation to daily
consumption are actually fairly low historically.

 Going INTL? 

I was not referring to international stocks but international economies. Stock
markets can drop severely in the face of growth recessions / mild recessions
(let alone severe recessions or depressions)

China, India, and to a lesser extent Latin America are behind the curve in
terms of infrastructure and are now (and have been) allocating funds to rectify
this. Government policy for the first two countries (esp. China) dictates that
they continuing building infrastructure in the face of a recession.

I had a terrific sept. up 12%. also new high 35% ytd. this last six weeks was
like earlier times. Not only do we have foreign countries like india , china
etc growing fast. but it appears with oil at $80 we have mid east buying stocks
, other investments vs buying into treasuries etc. Their actions of bringing
more money into the market has to be pushing stocks further.

I think ive had a string of good weeks recently. I went from +4% on july 23 to
-18% on august 23 to -5% as of yesterday for this quarter. However, I am
confident that my portfolio could go up 30% from here and still be undervalued.
My focused portfolio is vastly different from most on this thread being mostly
natural resources and a couple of Macao stocks. What hurt me this quarter was
RAS, MOG.to, and the severe tumble of uranium stocks, many dropped 50% from
their highs. My largest speculation- gold explorer plg.to is down about 15%
from its highs despite the increase in the price of gold. go figure.

No. Though don't ask me about my homebuilder positions. :P

Positives: MM buyout, KONG/HRAY (yeah, I missed yesterday's KONG 40+% jump, I
told you I am bad with cigar butts), TLB trades, starting AEO position, I think
that's mostly it.

Negatives: Homebuilders. Tell me something else. :)

FWIW, my portfolios hit new highs yesterday. I bought into the downturn with a
mix of reits, alt. energy, and high cash flow stocks. I also have been trading
more, taking my profits in tax deferred accounts. As you have preached many
times, it's important to have international exposure and my overseas shares
have helped greatly. I've hit my financial target two years early, so I'm
playing a little more cautiously with cash still on hand.

There is a definite change in mentality for most of us as accounts grow from
trading stakes up to serious money. I didn't buy much at the lows since my
brain had kicked into "capital preservation" mode instead of "time to double
down and swing for the fences".

Newer investors benefit from the ability to take bigger chances with smaller
amounts. The grizzled crowd gets to enjoy the benefits of compounding
portfolios over time, and benefiting from the results.

I reinitiated my position in lev as it dropped back down to the 2.03-2.05 area
as i thought it might. perhaps im early, but i didnt know what would happen by
october 9th. so Im on board for a small position now. I feel comfortable paying
a slight premium to what the controlling shareolder is gonna be paying for the
capital infusion of $2 a share.
