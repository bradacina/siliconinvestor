Starting a small position in Smithfield Foods.

At current price not a great bargain, but imo, value is there. Reasonably low
p/e, p/sales, p/bk. Okay ROE for the price you pay for it. Company profitable
every year for past ten (as far back as my chart goes), and book value
generally rises.

Earnings have fluctuated (so too then ROE). Company pays no dividend. Recent

-with a K, bruwin, E_K_S, others who follow CAT or JLG (new highs continuing on
those stocks as of today), do you have an opinion on competitor TEX?

This stock hasn't moved up as much as the others recently, yet I'd guess TEX's
prospects are equally good (or poor).

A negative aspect is that it seems TEX hasn't filed earnings reports for quite
a while, and the company is a rollup of several apparently mediocre businesses.
That that has kept people out of the stock might indicate an undervalued or
relatively undervalued situation.

CAT and JLG seem too expensive for me. But TEX maybe not.

C - JMHO Suma - and I could be wrong - but charts I look
at show C is in distribution since May.
My opinion only - but I think it is more likely to see
32-35 rather than 55 next. Probably a 70-80% chance of that.
I started looking into C once Cramer on Mad Money talked about banks. He is
very negative on most large banks now (of course he could be wrong also.)

I don't own C, and am not short it, so just my opinion.

BAC chart looks better to me - but it has already risen from around 30 to 45

IP - don't really follow that one - but quick charts I use
show contradictory indicators. One positive, one negative,
for the intermediate term.
Longer-term this actually looks pretty good to me, on the charts.
It's down from 43 to 31 - so that's good in my book as a
possible value.
I would think it has a fair chance of going back to the 45-50 range - but it
might take 1-3 years. 3% dividend though is good too.

So looks decent to me for a 1-3 year investment.

Sales Rise at International Paper

By TSC Staff
7/26/2005 8:52 AM EDT

International Paper (IP:NYSE - commentary - research), which is in the midst of
considering a massive operational restructuring, said second-quarter sales rose
from a year ago, and the company's adjusted profit surpassed Wall Street's
estimates.

The Stamford, Conn., forest products concern reported second-quarter earnings
of $77 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with $193 million, or 40 cents a
share, last year. The 2004 second quarter included 27 cents a share of earnings
from discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing operations totaled 13
cents in the prior-year second quarter.

Earnings from continuing operations and before special items in the quarter
fell to $150 million, or 31 cents a share, from $159 million, or 33 cents a
share last year.

Quarterly net sales rose to $6.5 billion from $6.2 billion a year ago. Analysts
polled by Thomson First Call were, on average, looking for a profit of 27 cents
a share and sales of $6.5 billion for the quarter.

"We anticipated some modest improvement in the second quarter following our
strongest first quarter in years," Chairman and Chief Executive John Faraci
said in a press release. "However, while pricing was up slightly from the first
quarter, sales volumes in our printing papers and industrial packaging
businesses were lower than we expected."

For the third quarter, the company said demand looks mixed and overall pricing
appears flat. "Our raw material costs remain at high levels and continue to
impact our profit margins," the company said.

TRIB. I don't know expected vs. actual quarterly earnings. This thing - like
some others in the sector, doesn't seem to trade on multiple of earnings. (By
trade, I mean here "evaluated by the marketplace"). Maybe it should trade on
earnings, I don't know.

I'm buying for a couple of reasons:

1. Sells now at a low p/bk and low p/sales.

2. Company is doing something odd, and maybe positive, imo: They are going to
give away their product:

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050627/ukm017.html?.v=10

(Well, they SAY they are going to do this. Whether they DO or not, I don't
know.) Perhaps it's just a marketing ploy or a way to get noticed. I could be
cynical! OTOH, the use of the product by people who might not get access
otherwise could possibly help save lives. And if the company is really, really
hurting and didn't believe that their employees serve some higher interest than
in just grubbing out profits, maybe they would not be doing this. So I will
back their confidence with my stock purchases. I could be very wrong here - I'd
not be surprised.

From:- with a K
Paul, it's interesting how differently investors see things sometimes! I look
at CAT vs. TEX and I see lots of things that tell me CAT is a better managed
company and a more attractive stock: better margins with a similar forward PE;
significantly higher ROE and ROA; a dividend; a better return the last 3 years;
and more.

TEX got mentioned on Cramer's show Thursday and then Friday he did a profile
piece on them as his pick of the week for Monday. Yahoo showed it up AH
yesterday to $50.

That said, I may not have been interested because of the cloud over their
filing, as you correctly pointed out. But I would expect both (and others, of
course) to benefit from the transportation bill, which may pass next week.
Cramer's plug should push TEX higher but I am reluctant to chase it at this
point.

My thesis for getting into CAT was its growth and attractive valuation, strong
management, rising estimates, strong quarterly results in April and bullish
outlook, dividend (which subsequently was raised 22%), geographic and business
diversity, pending transportation bill and CAFTA.

On Thursday the House passed CAFTA, adding six Latin American countries to the
list of nations with free-trade agreements with the United States.

CAFTA would boost U.S. manufacturing exports by $1 billion a year, while
preserving $4 billion worth of existing exports that could be jeopardized if
Central American textile companies lost business to cheaper Asian rivals, the
National Association of Manufacturers has estimated.

Jim Owens, chief executive of construction and mining equipment maker
Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), is one of the industry leaders urging lawmakers to
approve CAFTA.

"For Caterpillar, the benefits of free trade are very real," he wrote in a May
letter to House of Representatives Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois. 

After a free trade pact with Chile went into effect last year, Caterpillar's
U.S. exports to that country nearly doubled, Owens said. Caterpillar is hoping
to benefit from the $10 billion in new infrastructure projects planned in the
CAFTA countries.

As with any trade issue, China is a factor in the equation. By gaining
tariff-free access to another market, U.S. exporters hope to elbow out overseas
rivals.

While some tariffs would not be lifted for 10 years or more, exports of nearly
all construction and agricultural equipment would receive duty-free treatment
from the start. 

Now I read that CAT is trying to buy a controlling interest in China's number
one machinery maker, Xugong Machinery.

I think CAT is the long term play here but I gotta think TEX will get a boost
next week from Cramer and the transportation bill.

FWIW, here's my Graham fair value calculation for CAT and TEX, using the
average expected earnings, after hours price for TEX, and forecasted growth
estimates from Yahoo:

Company: CAT
Date: 7/29/05
Next year's expected earnings: $4.81
EPS growth rate used for estimate: 12
Multiple Graham used for estimate: 8.5
Graham Fair Value: $110.05

Company: TEX

TEX, in my opinion, doesn’t represent a Value stock. You’re quite right that
it’s behind with its financial statements. Last Annual for 2003 loaded on
20/2/04, and last Quarterly for 9/2004 loaded on 3/11/2004.
What one can see, from what’s available, is a stock with flat recent Quarterly
Turnover compared to better Annual numbers. However, for me, its Operating
Margin is far too low. It has far too much debt, which it doesn’t appear to be
utilising very effectively. And as a result, that debt is costing it too much
money. It’s last Annual Result showed a pre-tax net debt cost of $92.8 mil.
with a corresponding Bottom Line LOSS of -$25.5 mil. With Greenspan likely to
continue raising interest rates in the foreseeable future, things won’t get any
better for TEX.
Finally, it’s getting a negligible return from its Employment of Capital.
Personally, I wouldn’t be spending any money on TEX’s stock.

Without being too argumentative, I think you are plain wrong
on Technical Analysis (charts)

Charts show where prices have been, with volume, and how moves get overextended
on the upside and downside.

Yes - I use chart filters and fundamentals - and don't understand how anyone
could make money if they don't do this.

With C - you're assuming the US banking industry business is healthy. I'd say
we are in a major debt/real-estate bubble like the US has not seen in the last
century.

Don't you think that major US banks will be impacted if consumers can't pay
when rates rise? Isn't that a huge investment risk? Maybe that's why the stock
is going down.

And - if their business changes - is the dividend of any bank "safe".

Want an example of how I made money with "charts"?
Take a look at a chart for SYNX. I bought in the low
1.30-1.60 area and sold last week for 5.60. I made over 300%

C going down to 32...Just my guess, as I said, based on the

This could change, but it looks very weak to me now.

Regarding the 32 price - it was there in March 2003 - just
2 1/2 years ago - I don't think that makes it that unlikely - do you?

Regarding a PE of 8 then at 32 - well, it might not be 8 if the earnings sour.
It might be 20. Who knows in 6-12 months?

Again, this are just my opinions and speculations on C.
I was looking to buy myself for the good dividend etc., but
will wait for now.

I wouldn't be surprised to see 30-35 on it - 32 is just my educated guess in
the next 9-18 months...take care...t

re SYNX, C -
well congrat's on SYNX but retroactive analysis has no value for for us. If you
can predict an action like SYNX in the future that's an enitrely different
story.

As for C and the doom and gloom you are predicting, i think it's a possible
scenario, but how likely and when? Will a housing downturn undo C? Based on my
interpretation C does a better job managing risk than let's say BAC. Also with
50% of it's business and earnings coming from abroad, C is buffered better
against a domestic downturn than most other banks.

Besides it is not entirely clear that the end of a housing boom will lead to a
downturn at all. Australia for example had a much stronger RE boom in many
respect, but stocks (including banks have done well since RE is going in
reverse).

The flat yield curve right now is HURTING C (and other banks) and moderately
higher LT interest rates would help them increase earnings rather than causing
their demise, IMO. you crash scenarios is just one of the many potential future
outcomes

Spek,
FWIW, most of my investment life I've been an investor with an appreciation for
both value and growth stocks. I had a nodding acquaintance with chart analysis,
but never really studied it in earnest. Having been trained in economics, I
usually looked at the forces driving future demand and supply.

But this year, I started reading dabum3's excellent thread on Strictly Buy and
Sell Setups. He is a masterful teacher and has been providing daily commentary
on his trigger, target and stop prices prior to executing his trades during the
past 9 months. His expertise at reading the charts and explanations of what is
going on behind the movements leaves no doubt that informed chart reading is a
valuable tool. I'm a convert now and believe tgisprofit is correct that a
combination of chart analysis and fundamentals provides a good strategy for
managing risk in your investment choices. I daresay that if I had read some of
the books dabum3 recommends when I was younger, I would have timed my entry and
exit of many stocks much better.

I'm very much a neophyte in this type of chart analysis, but from what I've
learned so far, you would be reducing the risk of investing in C if you wait
until it gets out of its stage 4 downtrend. This isn't to say that you may not
time it perfectly on catching a V-bottom. But the percentages are not usually
with you on that type of move. Excellent chart readers provide a tool for
managing risk.

Connacher announces results of GLJ reserve and resources study - Great Divide
oil sands property
Tuesday August 2, 2:00 pm ET

CALGARY, Aug. 2 /CNW/ - Connacher Oil and Gas Limited (CLL - TSX) is pleased to
announce the results of a reserve and resources study of its 100 percent-owned
Great Divide oil sands property, which is comprised of 101 sections of oil
sands leases situated approximately 80 kilometres southwest of Fort McMurray,
Alberta. Over 538 million barrels of original oil-in-place probable and
possible reserves and resources were assigned to Connacher's acreage, with
initial and remaining recoverable reserves and resources of 311.2 million
barrels. Pod One was assigned 69.6 million barrels of probable reserves with
the eight percent pre-tax present value of future cash flow, calculated after
royalties, operating costs and capital, estimated at $290.5 million ($3.12 per
basic common share outstanding).
The study was conducted at Connacher's request by Gilbert Laustsen Jung
Associates Ltd. ("GLJ"), independent petroleum engineers of Calgary, Alberta.
The results are contained in a report dated July 29, 2005 with an effective
date of September 1, 2005, and contemplate Connacher proceeding with the filing
of an application to develop Pod One at Great Divide with the relevant Alberta
regulators, as expected, within the next several days.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation
Handbook and with National Instrument 51-101 ("NI 51-101"). The report was
accepted by Connacher's Board of Directors earlier today, on the recommendation
of its Reserves Subcommittee and its Audit Committee.

The report utilizes GLJ's July, 2005 full-year escalated pricing for the
quality of crude oil to be produced at Great Divide, as follows:

Reserves were only assigned to Pod One, in the proved and probable ("2P")
and proved, probable and possible ("3P") categories, although no proved
reserves were assigned pending startup of production, forecast by GLJ to occur
in 2007. Economic forecasts were generated for 2P and 3P reserves. The study
assumed 45 SAGD well pairs for the 2P case and 63 wells for the 3P case, with
cumulative steam-oil ratios ("SOR") of 2.6 in both cases, but declining to 2.3
during peak production periods.

A summary of the 2P and 3P reserves assigned for Pod One is as follows:

(2P) (3P)
(mmstb) (mmstb)
RESERVES
--------
Original Oil-in-Place 128.9 178.6
Remaining Recoverable 69.6 108.3

Connacher's 2P reserves at Pod One were forecast to generate $2.1 billion
of future working interest revenue ($1.9 billion after royalties). The future
undiscounted cash flow after deducting $735 million of forecast operating
expenses, $4.7 million of abandonment and restoration charges and $310 million
of net capital over the 25.3 year life of the project (11.9 years half-life)
was estimated to be $821.4 million with an eight percent pre-tax present value
of $290.5 million ($3.12 per basic common share) and a ten percent pre-tax
present value of $226.3 million ($2.43 per basic common share). Connacher
presently has 93 million common shares outstanding (100.3 million fully-
diluted).
Connacher's 3P reserves at Pod One were forecast by GLJ to generate $3.7
billion of future working interest revenue ($3.2 billion after royalties).
After deducting future estimated operating costs of $1.3 billion, abandonment
and restoration costs of 7.1 million and the estimated net capital investment
over the 36.3 year forecast life of the project (17.2 years half-life) of $468
million, the project is forecast to generate future undiscounted cash flow of
$1.49 billion with an eight percent pre-tax present value of $384.4 million
($4.13 per common share) and a ten percent pre-tax present value of $287.4
million ($3.09 per common share).
The cutoffs used by GLJ for probable reserves were 15 metres of net pay
for 2P reserves and 10 metres of net pay for 3P reserves.
The report also provided calculations of "Best Estimate Resources
(greater than 15 m Pay) which included probable reserves at Pod One and "Low
Certainty Resources (greater than 10m Pay)" which included probable and
possible reserves at Pod One, as well as recognizing the presence of four
other pods on Connacher's lands. These additional four pods have insufficient
drilling density, seismic mapping or project definition to be categorized as
reserves at this time. Additional drilling and seismic activity could result
in upgrading these to reserve status over time. In the interim, contingent
resources were assigned based on best estimate mapping of these additional
pods and the application of best estimate and low certainty recovery factors,
as follows:

BEST ESTIMATE RESOURCES (greater than 15m PAY)
----------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL INITIAL
OIL-IN-PLACE RESERVES RESERVES
(mmstb) (mmstb)

POD 1 (2P reserves) 128.9 69.6
POD 2, POD 2 South 53.8 21.8
POD 3, POD 4 79.5 36.1
---- ----
TOTAL 262.4 127.5

LOW CERTAINTY RESERVES (greater than 10m PAY)
---------------------------------------------
POD 1 (3P reserves) 178.6 108.3
POD 2, POD 2 South 82.3 45.0
POD 3, POD 4 116.8 66.0
----- ----
TOTAL 377.7 219.3

The GLJ report also concluded that along the channel trend, there was "a
likelihood that additional pods will be discovered with additional drilling."
Two additional undiscovered pods were assigned 160.6 million barrels of oil-in-
place in the prospective resource category, with initial recoverable
prospective resources of 91.6 million barrels.
In total, then, GLJ assigned 538 million barrels of probable and possible
oil-in-place reserves and resources to Connacher's existing land base, at its
present stage of development. Initial and remaining recoverable reserves and
resources aggregated 311.2 million barrels of bitumen. All reserve and
resource estimates were done on a volumetric basis.

Grommit. I have considered your post and my reply to it many times.

I still say, an abrupt move within a portfolio like that is very, very risky.
However, I'm not so sure that what I have been doing is less risky - maybe it's
even more risky. That is, instead of making large purchases at one time (your
May buys for instance), I have been gradually averaging up on my positions in
these stocks, and now they too for me account for a substantial part of my
portfolios - not 60% though! The risk as I see it, is that if there is a sell
off in these stocks (oil/gas sands, integrateds, e&ps, etc), then - whereas you
have a substantial profit cushion built up since May purchases) - my purchases
are spread over time. So any gains for me can quickly become losses as the
latter purchases at higher prices move easily and quickly into the loss column,
offsetting gains from the earlier buys.

Anyway, I continue adding. Fwiw, here are SMALL buys I've made today in the
oil/gas arena:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?s=coswf.pk+ceo+br+pbr+cnq+tot+nxy+chk+pcz&d=v4

And there were these sells:

DTV. Trim and re-allocate funds to oil sector. Losing patience with
company/stock - boredom. My problem.

FRO. Trimming a little of relatively large (for me) position. Oil tanker sector
stocks doing poorly. Other oil related businesses are seeing stocks rise.
Re-allocate funds.

DCRKF. Closed position on buyout offer.

re: travel related companies:

Have had some difficulty in resolving conflicting aspects of some of these
businesses.

Grommit, others who have been long-time followers of car rental companies: I
closed my position in DTG. I see Dollar Thrifty as the low price company among
the major players, and one of the few independently, publicly-held companies in
the sector. I see the travel industry as booming still. Therefore, it came as a
surprise to me that DTG recently announced a difficult pricing environment and
lowered expectations. I don't understand how this could be- given my
assumptions. The stock dropped on the company's report, and at current price,
it's not a value - especially if earnings might be impaired. I sold on the
announcement and now have completely exited my position.

I sold ASR recently too. This originally was a Dale Baker pick in '03. ASR
operates and administers nine airports in southeast Mexico. It's primarily
controlled by Danish partner Copenhagen Airports with a Mexican partner. I sold
because I read hurricane Emily damage reports coming from Cancun. I believed
that tourism would be greatly and adversely affect from the damage. But that
doesn't seem to be so - hotels and airport, etc. are operating, and ASR stock
still remains near its 12-month highs.
I've re-entered the stock today with a small purchase. While the buy now is not
the bargain it was when Dale Baker mentioned it, it still offers okay value and
decent growth potential - imo. Although the psr is high, the profit margins
from those sales are high too. The stock still sells below stated book value.
The company is a toll booth: It extracts a small fee from each passenger who
passes through its airports. And as per my assumption, tourism is booming.
Furthermore, I now read that several (maybe four) low-cost airlines may receive
gov't approval to enter the Mexican market which heretofore (I like that word
-g) has been characterized by "monopolized, high-cost air travel". Opening the
market to additional passengers/tourists has got to benefit ASR - I will bet.

I've also taken on a few shares of recent IPO, Macquarie Infrastructure Trust
(MIC). Too new and perhaps too diverse for a real value investment, but I'll
take a few shares assuming I'm holding a conservative investment that provides
services at airline terminals, and that it might have a good dividend yield.
(Div. yield shown by Yahoo is based only on one quarter's dividend.)

Moore-Handley Reports Results of Operations for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2005
Monday August 1, 2:48 pm ET

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Aug. 1, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- Moore-Handley, Inc. (Other
OTC:MHCO.PK - News), a Birmingham-based distributor of hardware and home center
products, reported net income of $258,000 or $0.17 per diluted share for the
quarter ended June 30, 2005 vs. $317,000 or $0.21 per diluted share for the
same period in 2004.
Sales for the quarter were $41,173,000, up 6.5% from the same quarter last
year. Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2005 were $85,522,000 or 4.7%
above those in 2004. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was
$423,000 or $0.26 per diluted share vs. net income of $647,000 or $0.39 per
diluted share last year. Lower earnings resulted from pressure on gross margin,
increased marketing expense, and higher interest costs.

May I ask, what are your short positions?

In a posting, you said:
"Alas, our joint account is 95% margined, mostly short, oh well!!"

Awhile back I posted (on the 50% gains thread) that I thought a "good
old-fashioned, lift all boats, rally" was coming. Now that my portfolio is up
15% since that posting, I'm beginning to think that maybe I need to start
balancing my quality long positions with some GOOD QUALITY short positions (or
would that be bad quality companies?).

Value swings both ways: like a company, go long - don't like it, go short. The
problem with this is, some people hate companies even though they are
fundamentally sound (like NFI). I always need to take someone else's short
recommendations with a grain of salt: is this personal or is the a business
reason for shorting?

My top four favorite current shorts are:
1) DRYS - a POS IPO in boring overbought dry goods shipping industry where the
CEO used IPO money to buy ships from his sister's company. Remember, this is an
industry that has razor thin margins and really makes its money on timely asset
sales. Ask yourself, who got the deal between him and his sister? I'm currently
long at 14 to take advantage of a minor upswing to maybe 16 where I will
re-short. I had been short at 19.60. This is a $5 stock.
2) NWAC - Airline with a mechanics strike delayed by a federally mandated
"cooling off period", currently seeking billions in cost reductions. How can
they possibly avoid BK?
3) TIVO - Comcast is giving away the same service they're trying to sell on
subscription? Dish TV doing the same... how long will they last?
4) IPII - over-hyped micro float stock, float is 1.93MM. As soon as the pumpers
are done inflating it, this should be a classic short back to reality, life
below 10.

So, what are your favorite companies to short?

You all be careful out there,
Ray

Hi Ray - I like Drys from the stand point of their long term business plan
(shipping transportation specifically to/from China & India) and their
potential to generate huge cash flows from their operation. DRYS is currently a
leveraged play where the company has used the equity from their recent IPO to
double the size of their fleet w/ limited amounts of new debt. As a result,
their 2nd quarter revenues doubled and their per share earnings (adjusted for
the new IPO shares) came in today at $1.43/share. This beat the analyst
estimates of $1.23/share but more importantly demonstrated how huge cash flows
can be generated by incrementally increasing their fleet size. More ships are
scheduled to come on-line in the next 12 months. DryShips Inc. Reports Second
Quarter 2005 and First Half Results Tuesday August 2, 4:15 pm ET
(http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/050802/092229.html)

It is a leveraged play as a large amount of the cash generated goes to pay down
the new debt used to buy the used ships but after 24 to 36 months, most of this
new debt will be paid down.

I see it as a "value" play in that the company buys used ships for $0.50 on the
dollar (they do hire that "sister company you mentioned to manage their fleet
and pay a high "service fee" to compensate the group for the day-to-day
operations). There are incentives built into their operating contract so they
run an efficient fleet. They utilize both long term fleet pricing contracts and
day rate fees. The key is to keep all the ships in use and minimize the down
time.

I like this "value" play because the operation has physical assets (used ships)
that generate consistent cash flows, where industry demand is expected to grow
annually at 10% or better due to global demand constraints. The value
proposition (IMO) is if they can extend the operating life of each "used" ship
from 4 years to 7 or even 10 years. I believe the average age of the fleet is
just under 10 years and many of these ships have a useful life of 18-22 years
depending on the type of maintenance done. Therefore, if they can stretch the
average useful life by 1 to 3 years, their free flow cash flows will more than
double. These huge free flow cash flows go directly to the bottom line because
much of the debt was paid off in the first 36 month's of ownership. Also, you
will notice that the salvage value for all these ships have gone up over time
too because the basic commodity "scrap" prices are higher.

I continue to accumulate shares at the current level and believe the stock is
worth around $25-$30/share which equates to a forward PE of 5. The company
recently implemented a quarterly dividend of $0.20 share or $0.80/share annual
or just over $5% return. This is a qualified dividend too.

If you look at the payback period, cash flows and other ROI measures for
similar assets like truck fleets, planes and even rental property, this is a
pretty good business to own. My analysis shows that on average each used ship
is paid off in under 48 months.

Finally, some insiders in the business say that the CEO is very smart and now
that he has a vested interest in the new IPO shares (and probably options too),
will do his best to grow the company and will continue to buy "used" ships on
the cheap.

I just do not see this being a $5/stock unless it is mismanaged, ships become
idle, and some catastrophic event hits the company.

Since this here's the value thread, "good calls" should mostly get lost to the

value, and the thead has moved on to other stocks during that time. That seems
to be the case many times. Here's an example: Tonight I see Cramer on TV

re ,OFG,C,VIA - earnings review

C: earnings look clean - the earnings shortfall is mostly due to "Corporate and
Investment banking" shortfall. Consumer banking, Cards and Consumer finance
have done OK. Nothing in the balance sheet that raises my concerns. I may add a
last quart to my position on weakness.

OFG: Earnings were subpar and the way they were accomplished indicates low
quality. Balance sheet was expanded (buying securities) to increase interest
income but with the current narrow margins in the carry trade that does not
yield much. Still OFG leverage is fairly moderate (9% equity). It's obvious
that OFG needs to control cost better. No serious red flags and writeoffs. I'll
hold.

VIA. Earnings beat estimates. Revenue increase larger than expected but margins
are narrower. The buyback has helped to increase earnings/share. FCF down some
also YOY, but still good. Cable networks are now 40% of revenues and the much
talked about problem division Radio (which had higher earnings YOY this
quarter) is now less than 10%. I think the stock buybacks and the split will
create shareholder value. The stock is quite cheap for a high quality
entertainment company. I'll hold my full position.

SXT: in a downtrend, but in buying range for the patient investor.

Upon reviewing a 5 year chart, there seems to be serious resistance at 18 and a
5 year low at 15.50 after 911.

The 6 month chart says you're still in a downtrend, but the band here seems to
be $18 to $24 in a 1 year oscillation. That's a 33% gain while receiving a 3.3%
dividend.

Maybe a 1/2 position now and a 1/2 position in 3 weeks.

re FMD - not a buy for me. Here is why:

1) Cash earnings are only 40-50% of total earnings, the remainder goes into
"Residuals" which are expected future cash flows from Loans. no market to
market fopr "Residual" according to 424B statement. Discount rate is 12% which
sounds high but that includes amortization over 24Y lifetime (I believe).

2) High stock option dilution - 105 of outstanding in 2004
3) IPO proceeds mainly went to stock holders very little wen to the companies
equity. Owners are eager to sell out, why?
4) More than 50% of revenues are coming from one customer . I believe this
customer is Wachovia/Bank One.
5) earnings are 80% dependant on securitisations - i would expect them to be
lumpy based on timing.
6) What exactly are FMD advantages against competitors? 424B mentioned a
database of student loans, dating 18 years back. Other lenders will certainly
develop their own data and many (SLM, Wells Fargo, etc.) should be attracted by
the high margins that FMD is achieving right now. More competitions will
pressure margins.
7) It appears to me that the "Residuals" mentioned above are fairly interest
rate sensitive. Is FMD adequately hedged. Rising interest rates could lead to
tripple whammy of increased defaults, increased prepayments, and FMD being
forced to use a higher discount rate.

This one is about the steepest discount I've found; if not the steepest, pretty
close to the biggest discount to NAV in its class. Cohen and Steers funds seem
to have been hit harder in the recent downturn, perhaps, as I've mentioned,
because of the flat results at CNS. If that's the case, I feel it is
unwarranted to punish Cohen and Steers funds for the lackluster results at

re RTU - quite a few REIT funds area trading around 15% discount to NAV. Do you
realize that most of the REIT funds boost their yield with a 50% (based on
equity) leverage? This really hurts when the price of the underlying assets
goes down.

I would only consider buying a Closed end investment fund when i like the
underlying assets. REITS had a fantastic run until; recently and trade at very
rich valuations still. They would need to come down a lot (15-20% based on
current valuation) before I would be interested.

Hi Spekulatius - The problem I have with any REIT is that their dividend payout
to shareholders is not treated as a "qualified" dividend (taxed at a maximum of
15%) but rather is treated like ordinary income and taxed accordingly. Same
goes for any interest earned on cooperate bonds or dividends from ADR's.

Therefore, IMO, the REIT investment returns must be discounted for this tax
rate differential. Once this adjustment is made, the after tax returns on REITs
is just OK. If you are looking for a good "qualified" return, I always come
back to SFL a new company set up to provide long term financing for oil
tankers. In many respects it's very similar to a REIT but it is a revenue
stream based on the lease agreements for the use of oil tankers not apartments.

Many of the other shipping companies provide qualified dividends (you must make
sure they are not ADR's) and reflect income from the leases of these assets.
The nice part is that the maximum tax rate is 15%.

===============================================================

I was looking at the 5 yr. returns on many of the natural resource companies
including integrated oil (XOM, BP, CVX), mining BHP Billiton Ltd (Australian
minerals) and Timber (GP, IP, WY). I was surprised to see that all except for
timber seem to show pretty good growth. It appears that the rise in price of
many of these commodities (oil, copper, ore, coal, grains) track the rise in
the company stock price. This may be the result that many of these companies
own the physical proven reserves and the market has priced them accordingly.
For example:
5 yr. chart XOM: (up 100%)
(http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=XOM&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=)
5 yr. chart BHP: (up 300%)
(http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=BHP&t=5y)

I have two observations: (1) timber resource valuations have lagged this
commodity price trend increase (i.e. lumber has increased but paper companies
have not increased in price as much (if at all). and (2) The infrastructure to
remove and deliver these natural resources to the end user have lagged in price
(i.e. caterpillar, deep drilling oil rigs, transportation trains & ships).

Is there a value play somewhere in this theme? On several valuation matrix, the
companies that own the natural resources are fully valued but those that
provide the products or services to deliver these resources to the end user or
manufacturer have yet to benefit. We have discussed several small caps that
were undervalued (like JLG) but have already run up in price. Can you suggest
any others?

My evaluation seem to always lead me back to the shippers.

Finally, I do not think that the current way our government calculates the CPI
(or PPI) begins to reflect the "real" cost of commodities (oil, minerals,
timber) that are demanded by global consumers today. Just more food for thought
. . .

RTU addresses some of your issues in its latest quarterly report .

And the best I can tell, they are not margined, but rather
41% in REITS, 42% in utlities and 17% in preferred stocks & debt.

Another option, I guess is ZTR but I dont believe its discount is as steep.

Both have the level rate distribution policy which can involve a return of
capital.

My comments in bold. Thank for your comments about FMD, Spekulaitis.

re FMD - not a buy for me. Here is why:

1) Cash earnings are only 40-50% of total earnings, the remainder goes into
"Residuals" which are expected future cash flows from Loans. no market to
market fopr "Residual" according to 424B statement. Discount rate is 12% which
sounds high but that includes amortization over 24Y lifetime (I believe).

This and the overall complexity/lack of transparency are the biggest risks IMO.

2) High stock option dilution - 105 of outstanding in 2004

Some dilution has happened. The 10-Q for quarter ending 3/2006 shows no
significant difference between basic and diluted shares (66 and 67 million
respectively), however. I don't understand the asserted 105 million shares. I
wish I knew what the option exposure was at higher stock prices, but I don't. 

3) IPO proceeds mainly went to stock holders very little wen to the companies
equity. Owners are eager to sell out, why?

 This argument is not developed well enough for me to respond to. Insiders sell
for the reasons insiders sell and I have not heard anything to suggest FMD's
insiders are selling more than others, although you may know this to be the
case. Also, I'm not going to take it as a negative that the company didn't
itself feel like it needed to raise cash from the public. Clearly, this
investment would be more compelling if book value and cash were higher.

4) More than 50% of revenues are coming from one customer . I believe this
customer is Wachovia/Bank One.

The big customer is BankOne/JP Morgan Chase. I believe Wachovia has no relation
to it. Bankone accounted for 43% of service revenue in 2004 and 59% in 2003. If
the private student loan market continues to grow at rates anywhere close to
the 30+% over the last decade, the concentration risk should diminish. I don't
know what JPMorgan accounts for. I think Charter One, Wachovia, and Bankamerica
are big customers.

5) earnings are 80% dependant on securitisations - i would expect them to be
lumpy based on timing.

Yes, lumpiness should be expected, but the PE is such that we're not paying for
consistency.

6) What exactly are FMD advantages against competitors? 424B mentioned a
database of student loans, dating 18 years back. Other lenders will certainly
develop their own data and many (SLM, Wells Fargo, etc.) should be attracted by
the high margins that FMD is achieving right now. More competitions will
pressure margins.

The claimed advantages are in the 424b for all to review. Yes, competitor entry
will hurt margins. But I look at the other side, which is this business has
been around for almost a decade, and where else would the margins come from but
competitive advantage? If you don't believe this company functions in a highly
complex environment and that complexity is not a moat, I would not invest. I'm
pretty comfortable that it will take 10+ years to come up with competing
databases, and they won't be as valuable. FMD's customers (e.g, the big banks)
have not forked out tens of millions if they thought could do it cheaper
in-house.

7) It appears to me that the "Residuals" mentioned above are fairly interest
rate sensitive. Is FMD adequately hedged. Rising interest rates could lead to
tripple whammy of increased defaults, increased prepayments, and FMD being
forced to use a higher discount rate.

 This is true, and the increased prepayments is interesting. The loans I
believe are variable rate, so increased rates can mean increased prepayments.

If I thought higher interest rates were going to occur, I would reconsider this
investment. However, the yield on the 10 year US bond has risen .2% over the
last year to 4.4% in the face of multiple 1/4 point Fed rate increases. So I
see no justification for great concern here. The renmimbi valuation is a
wildcard.

The napkin case for FMD: assuming trends continue, assuming FMD has some
durable competitive advantage... and Yahoo's ROA 44%, ROE 51%, forward PE of
11, triple digit trailing revenue growth... I'm taking the risk and have added
to my position.

Standard disclaimers on duing your own due diligence. I wish I had more
confidence in FMD so I would invest more, but I am leery. And a special warning
that I invested in Enron, Worldcom, and Healthsouth, so be prepared...

Can you beat that, Paul? (I made enough on WCOM to offset the other two.)

P.S. FMD's earnings release is on 8/11.

Brendan - re FMD, thanks for your very detailed response. I see some of the
points you are making. I know i tried to play "devils" advocate. I am confident
that FMD is not an "Enron case" case, however it could become a "Doral" case if
you substitute "Residuals" with "IO stubs". Non cash earnings need to be
heavily discounted, this in the end is my biggest gripe with FMD right now. if
one believes that FMD's balance sheet and cash flow statement are Ok, it's a
buy.

I owned some WCOM because I thought at that point that WCOM's balance sheet and
cash flow didn't look that bad. My lesson from that investing episode was that
not all cash flows and balance sheets are created equal.

I picked up a 1/4 position of AVID today. I may be early and it may keep
dropping, thus the small lot. AVID indicated last month that it expects some
softness in Q2 and they've been dropped like a hot potato.

They have decent margins, a healthy ROE, and no debt. I saw a presentation that
laid out a compelling market opportunity for prospects yet to upgrade to
digital technology.

While they got approval from the EU for their acquisition and it happened
today, it will be dilutive, yet they claim it will be accretive in the 4th
quarter. AVID enjoys a market leadership role (professionals) and from what I
read of the acquisition this will expose them to new markets and new customers
(consumers). Of course they have to integrate systems, culture, people, etc.,
and this never goes as smoothly as you'd think, unless you're Cisco and you do
this every quarter.

Morningstar listed AVID and others as good value plays recently: These shares
are selling at a deep discount to what we think is fair value--thus the 5-star
ratings. The volatility in these share prices has created, in our view,
excellent buying opportunities. When Avid dropped off its cliff a few weeks
ago, Mike Trigg, who runs Morningstar's GrowthInvestor newsletter, was buying
the stock for the Morningstar Growth Portfolio.

Today's PR snip:
The completion of this acquisition immediately strengthens Avid's ability to
serve the industries that Make, Manage and Move Media," said David Krall,
Avid's president and chief executive officer. "Broadcasters who are
transitioning from analog to all-digital production will now have immediate
access to a wider selection of capabilities from Avid, and in the months ahead,
they'll experience tighter interoperability between Pinnacle's broadcast
products and Avid's end-to-end all-digital production environments. At the same
time, we have formed a new Consumer division that will continue to leverage
Pinnacle Systems' market-leading brand in the rapidly growing consumer video
market. All told, with Pinnacle among the Avid family of companies, we've
further cemented our position as a leading supplier of products and services to
the world's digital media creators."

AVID. Right, that forward p/e is attractive. Profit margins are also very good
now (now=key word). IF margins are sustainable/sustained, the stock is a buy,
imo. Turn off for me though is that the company hasn't always been profitable
in recent past, and when it has, sometimes those profit margins weren't so
good. Looking forward, maybe one ought to go with you. I look backwards though
(maybe wrongly so), and so I won't commit funds because p/e of 13 is too high
when I conside the past lousy margins.

MVSN. Uh oh, my metric got me on this one - maybe -g-. It's just too easy to
dismiss some of these stocks because of high p/bk, high p/sales, high p/e. If
we're going to try to be inclusive (I am), then like Mr. Miller whose fund
keeps beating the S&P for what 12 consecutive years? - then we are going to
have to find some other metrics that give us a clue to "value". Apparently, you
like p/e and growth rate. As I say, I like historical measures, so I like past
profit margins. On that basis, a p/e of 17 is not - imo - too high to pay for a
stock that has the historically very good profit margins that MVSN has had. But
those margins are coming down (this year's according to Yahoo vs. historical
average). Still, those margins are good enough to buy the stock now - IF the
high earnings come through to raise the 'e' on the p/e to drop the p/e to 17.
(Last earnings report disappointed though.)
Anybody reading this thread for a Ben Graham type stock or something in that
"safer" vein maybe ought to pass on this stock. For those who study and are
knowledgeable about the company and its prospects and/or will take an
appropriate risk--- I don't know. For me, I will pass.

But that's jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

This_is_the_end. No, missed ACC when it was lower. I have a position in GCT
though.

These REITs are all newly public, and I don't know the dividend policy. I am
assuming the current quarterly dividend will be consistent throughout the next
year (next three quarters)

So I make EDR (.30 payble now) to be $1.20 on a stock under $18. (6.7% yield)

I make ACC (.3375 payable Aug 29) to be $1.35 on the $24 stock (5.6%)

Bunch of if's with this. I don't know enough to make the yield estimate more
accurate though.

re CSCO - probably time to add some shares to my starter position in CSCO.
Revenues up a respectable 11%, earnings/share up 20%, sharecount down 6% YOY
roughly (although CSCO has been spending more than it's FCF to do so). Those
are fine numbers. The market is really not valueing CSCO's earnings with a
premium PE any more, like it did in the past. Next years PE is around 18. For a
company with extremely high earnings quality (except for the option expense
issue) and a wide moat, that's a pretty modest valuation. The dilution due to
options appears to be falling slowly and with a flat stock, the expense is
somewhat theoretical anyways. if it falls below 18$, I amy add some shares.

Cisco has a wonderful business one would hope to own, except for that big item
you mention. I find it morally reprehensible. I had to save this paragraph from
a Wall Street Journal Online article from yesterday. Where is the outcry on
their practices?

Cisco Posts Higher Net
As Revenue Jumps 11%

By PUI-WING TAM
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
August 9, 2005 6:51 p.m.

"Cisco will start expensing stock options in its fiscal
first quarter, which ends in late October, according
to new rules by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board. To reduce the impact of the looming accounting
shift, which could potentially crimp net income, Cisco
has been seeking Securities and Exchange Commission
approval to use some new financial instruments that
would mimic employee options."

IASG: A cigar butt, worse than ever. Stock down on lousy quarterly report -
expenses up, customers defecting. Revenue up, a positive. (Might be crucial to
understand how revenue is determined though, and I do not.)

I'll reenter with just a very few shares.

FMD update.

FMD released earnings this afternoon. I bought some more in the afterhours,
because of what I perceive to be a lack of negative surprises in the report. In
the conference call, they said the client concentration risk did decrease in
fiscal 2005 (ending 6/30/2005): JPMorgan/Bankone dropped to 30% from 59% in FY
2003. Earnings came in 5c ahead of the company's projections for the year and
fourth quarter. They mentioned a backlog that will get securitized in the fall
but I don't remember the exact number, nor do I know how to judge it. They
confirmed growth expectations of 30 plus percent for fiscal 2006.

The one potential negative I heard was that client spend on advertising student
loans (though growing rapidly) was being deferred to later in the fiscal year.
They cast this in terms of the clients trying to match ad spending with when
the loan activity was actually occurring.

It was somewhat comforting that FMD views federal authorization of student loan
funds as a positive. The rationale was (a) it would grow the overall market for
secondary eduction and (b) greater private student loans would be required to
supplement the always inadequate federal loans.

Also, interesting was the CEO poopooing the idea of selling their servicing
assets at par because they would then not be able to recapture the value of
their truly "conservative" assumptions on the servicing assets.

We'll see.

Bought back again into BFCF at 7.15$ Discount to NAV is around 30%. I like the
BBX and the BNHN holding but could do without the LEV. BBX looks pretty
reasonably valued at this point - they are doing a tremendous job growing the
Florida franchise with good margins and strong deposit growth. A 15% discount
to NAV for a holding company is OK but a 30% discount appears too high. I am
for a starter position. Sometimes Dale's discards work out OK:-).

Take a look at MACC & RAND, they both trade at substantial discounts to NAV.

Some discount is valid given the illiquidity of their investments as well as
what I consider less than conservative accounting.

Many BDCs structure investments with a large dividend which allows them to
offset their high expenses.

The problem is, they maintain the valuations of these companies despite the
fact that they just gave back 10% of its valuation.
(Or whatever)

BFCF sounds a little different. Still, the insider sentiment bothers me.

BFCF: I'll add a little here to my position.

As you know...
A problem with these undervalued types like BFCF is that if the stocks held -
LEV, BBX, etc - drop, then so too will BFCF. Yet BFCF will still continue to
sell at a discount to its underlying holdings. Thus a possiblity for being the
classic value trap, imo.

Homebuilders have been taking a hit recently; if it continues, LEV will drop
further (I presume) and so too BFCF. Also if bank stocks turn down because of
increasing US fed rate hikes, BBX will decline (I am guessing)and this will
also be reflected by a drop in BFCF stock (my guess).

Still, the businesses aren't disappearing. I'm willing to hold on to see what
develops.

Didn't know anybody had RAD at such a high level that they could still go ahead
and downgrade the stock. -g- I've assumed RAD's been put in the basement by
everyone.

I've recently cut my few RAD shares back by about half, taking losses on a
purchase made last year. I still believe the company will muddle through - get
its share of business. Prospects don't appear particularly great - anecdotally,
where I live there are drug stores on every corner it seems. Hard to believe
there're so many sick people around here or so much business that the companies
still keeping putting up new stores.

Have been using funds to add to my positions in the oil sector.
