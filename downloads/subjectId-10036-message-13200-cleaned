ISTN settled its lawsuit on Friday

This was the main issue that worried me with this stock. Now, I think this
stock is very attractive despite a large degree of unsystematic (e.g.
company-specific) risk. The reason: They've got a boatload of cash and a low
PE.

On a selfish note, I'll admit right now that I bought more shares before
posting this message. Unfortunately, this is a very illiquid stock, and I
wanted to get my orders in before posting. Although I doubt that many people
pay attention to my postings, one buy order can make a difference if daily
volume is only a few thousand shares.

Hi MC!

I decided to take a small position in ISTN today.

The value for the cash flow seems to indicate a nice rate of return. I get
about $1.05/share free cash flow through the 9 months reported this fiscal
year. Buying the company in the low $5s seems like a bargain.

I had already done the research on this, but put it on the back burner some
time ago. I'm glad you mentioned it here today!

BEAV..I sold about 13% of small position afterhours on 10/2 @ $12.49. Holding
the rest. Not really expecting much in the nearterm but expect it could be much
higher in 18-24 months.

Took a small opening position in cash cow ASCX at 38-40 cents. They are burning
cash fast, but have a lot. A lot of speculation they could liquidate and
shareholders would get $1.50-1.70 per share. No sales to speak of.

Took a small opening position in FTG which seems alfully cheap.
Continue to add to my CRTQ position.

Oh and bought some MDA because it looked cheap. Dont know much about them but
the balance sheet looked pretty good.
I am being conservative and taking small positions in most things. Nervous I

eventually WE are going to have to PAY for all this money they are spending on

I started a small position in your pick of MAXF this morning.

I see your link where you've listed some of the positives today:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=16511330&s=maxf

I look at it this way: The company offers a margin of safety:

Cash assets apparently (Yahoo!) exceed stock price. Company is mostly
profitable (3 of past 5 years). It's a steady-eddie in that sales over past six
years have been between 150M and 200M per year- mostly around 150M-160M

This outweighs the negatives I see:

They are a broker/dealer(?) specializing in a niche market that may have growth
potential (although I don't see it from the revenues generated) as people seek
a haven from stock volatility or declines. MAXF revenues are a function of the
number of brokers on the payroll, and MAXF, located in the WTC, was hurt. Also,
to my way of looking at it, MAXF now is trading at the higher end of its
price/sales and price/book history; and book value is growing only slowly.
Return on that book value (ROE) is not great and is higher now than in previous
years. It seems to me that the stock price is relatively high and already
reflects most of MAXF prospects - unless MAXF can see substantial growth in its
revenues. (And that is not apparent to me--however I have no expectise with the
business or about MAXF.)

I conclude though that with the margin of safety one apparently gets, and the
steady business that seems to be there, I can hold this stock for a while to
see if MAX prospects or performance or investor interest can move this stock up
again to say, 4 (from 2.83 today), where the stock has traded occasionally when
it's at its best times.

Jmo,
and I've been wrong many, many times.

By my way of thinking, unless MAXF business drops sharply for some reason, it

"House2Home Revises Outlook for Third Fiscal Quarter
Company Exploring Various Strategic Measures
IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2001--House2Home&#174;, Inc.
(NYSE:HTH - news) said today that sales for the third fiscal quarter ending
October 27, 2001 have been running approximately 25% to 30% below the run rate
prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks. This is expected to lead to
substantially lower sales and a greater net loss for the quarter and full year
than was previously anticipated.

``We continue to believe in the House2Home concept but acknowledge that the
unforeseen events of September 11 have exacerbated an already strained economic
environment,'' said Herb Zarkin, chairman and chief executive officer. ``The
continuing impact of these tragic events has raised the level of uncertainty
surrounding ongoing sales levels, putting increased pressure on the company's
liquidity and our bottom line. We remain focused on developing programs to
strengthen sales and attract customers to our stores as well as considering any
and all strategic measures with respect to the future of our business.''

To this end, the company also announced it has retained the services of
Barrington Associates, an investment banking firm, to assist in exploring
various strategic and financial alternatives. The company noted that it remains
in compliance with its bank covenants, although the margins of compliance under
its financial performance covenants are decreasing as the sales downturn
continues.

House2Home expects to announce third quarter results in mid-November. "

MFW....an update to the board....

I was holding on to a small position of MFW to see how things played out.

This article: http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/011016/161122_1.html has had the effect
of moving me off of the fence. I sold the remaining stake today.

It's a shame! This company has wonderful fundamentals, but is making what
appears to be terrible decisions with the free cash flow. I am forced to agree
with some posters to this thread that suggested (some quite strongly) that it
was due to Mr. Perlman's influence.

I think I broke even on this transaction, maybe just a couple of dollars ahead,
but the potential for return was awesome, but I believe now that it is too much
of a crapshoot as to whether that potential will ever be actualized. Since I
don't play craps with investment money, my money will be employed elsewhere.

INT now up about a double for me, so I want to take profits. Selling 1/2. INT
was mentioned here several times starting 12/99 as a value pick vs. QCOM, when
QCOM had so much going for it apparently.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=qcom&k=c1&t=2y&s=int&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

In retrospect, the most profitable play would've been to short QCOM (and buy
INT). However, the risk of shorting such a popular stock where everyone (or
almost everyone?) believes in the future success of CDMA technology and QCOM's
strong patent position, meant that there would've been a risk that the momentum
crowd could have pushed the stock higher again. One would need very strong
nerves and a strong belief in the overvalued nature of the stock to hold a
short, imo. I assume most normal short players would protect themselves also by
making only a small (dollar value) short bet on QCOM. This has the offset that
gains would be limited too.

I believe somebody posted interest in HMT and HPT (hotel REITs) recently. I am

listened to the HMT call of 10/18/2001 and was surprised to see the
characterization of them in the news pages available on the web.

The company expects to:
o suspend the December dividend
o resume dividends later at substantially lower levels
o be in violation of loan covenants of their credit facility by January

I didn't read any of this... I just got it from their webcast (still available
from their website).

rjm2: my notes regarding some of your stocks:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=hth+ascx+ftg+crtq+mda&d=t

Aside: not trying to argue against these or dissuade anyone. Just offering a
response while the thread is quiet today.

Imho, the best thing going for these stocks is that YOU own them. (We have seen
how you have got tremendous success with some of your previous mentions here.)

HTH: I can't figure it. Whether to sell now for the tax loss if I owned it or
hold it to see if they can pull through, or buy more or again in Dec. and hope
for a new-year bounce.

ASCX: Another "cash-in-search-of-a-business stock"? I've never had any luck
with those. (I should go back and look at some of my picks here. I actually
suspect I've had zero winners in this category.) ASCX sells way below net
current assets, although it's not a Ben Graham net-net, I believe, because co.
is not profitable.

FTG: Struggling little company. Cheap enough (price/book, net current assets
about $2/sh)), but can it survive? When I see companies like this - small,
refurbishers - I always suspect they'd be better off as a mom-n-pop business
instead of issuing stock and being publicly traded.

CRTQ: a biopharmaceutical r&d business. Too dangerous for me to consider and
too tough for me to evaluate.

MDA: cheap enough, imo. It's been profitable 4 of 6 years (not sure about now
though), and at $1.98/sh sells for less than 2/3 net-net of $3.75. It's a
business dealing with fine arts/reproductions/collectables and seems very
dependent on just one or a very few artists.

My guess would be that if I just picked my opinion of the best stock on this
list, I'd pick the wrong stock. Has to be done your way, imo, which is to buy a
package of these type stocks and try to be a patient holder. For me, given that
the market is down and there seems to be so many values in large and mid-cap
stocks now, I have trouble focusing my energy or patience on these cigar butts.
Again: which is not to disparage this method or your picks -- after all some of
these stocks can and maybe will, triple or more from current prices. Plus, I
already have some cigar butts I'm holding (a couple of which became cigar butts
after I bought 'em - ouch!)

I havent had that bad of luck with cash-searching for business stocks. A lot of
trading opportunities really.
ASCX has not really publicly given up on their core business yet so I guess
liquidation is a possibility. LBPI is one from a few years ago that is sending
me a check soon for $5.10 with another 75-85 cents coming later. I think I own
it at $3 & less.

CRTQ is NOT your typical biopharmaceutical r&d business. It has its UPSIDE with
NONE of its downside. And they have like $3.70 per share in CASH searching for
a business with value investor Paul Koether in control. They are mediating
against Ono Phamacueticals because they believe they are owed royalties.
Koether, the company & a bio-tech fund keep buying too. Its just a matter of
time here. Realize however that the biotech patents ARE inhibiting the search
for other businesses. CRTQ likely values them for more than any aquisition
would. But the cash DOES serve as a "buffer" on the downside. Also realize that
Koether is 64 and would probably not be content waiting for ten year payoff.

I have read in numerous studies that small & microcap stocks do better in the
long run than large & midcaps. I figure I lose any advantage I might have when
smarter guys with bigger wallets are right along beside me. They cant
effectively play in the small & microcap market.
I theorize thats an advantage for me !?

Why do feel the opposite ?

I guess my overall strategy is combining things that work (based on longterm
studies). Like low P/Es, price to book,Contrainism, price to sales, NCA
cheapies,insider buying and my own feel for inherent "riskyness".

I have had a suprising number of stocks hold up or actually increase in the
last 2 years which kind of validates my approach. (In my mind anyway)
Of course, I lagged the averages during the heat of the mania too.

I'd say the reason I don't like "cash in search of a business" stocks is that
I'm not good at selling them. They spike, I get hopeful, I don't sell. Mistake.
Seems like it may be an ability or an agility which I just do not have.

I get in a mindset with these things that tests my patience also. Where I
figure, here's a management that screwed up one business but were lucky or
smart enough to have a bunch of cash left. And now they're going to try
something else. What makes them (or me) believe they can do better the 2nd
time? When they are likely competing with an already-entrenched company or else
will be trying something totally new, how do I assess management's chance for
success?

And as I say, other issues beckon me. For example IPG (I am using this as an
example & not a recommendation for anyone), an umbrella of the world's biggest
advertising agencies. Yes, the stock's come down, yes it's relatively expensive
(compared to net-nets for sure), but it's selling at a multiyear low in terms
of price/book and price/sales. It's hard for me to believe there's a business
risk for this company (in the sense that they are likely to go bankrupt) or
that they would ever have a problem in hiring competent managers in the depth
they required (unlike microcaps which can be woefully understaffed and
incestuous). At some point the advertising market will pick up. Imo. I expect
IPG can get back to its prior years' average price/sales or price/book
(assuming that low interest rates will tend to keep p/e's high as compared to
the 1970's when there were high interest rates and low p/e's on growth stocks.)
I can envision having a profit in the stock as the stock price climbs upward.
That's something I just can't see with "cash in search of a business stocks".

I assume it's a personal issue for me, that I don't like and avoid "cash in
search of business stocks". I will buy net-nets occasionally, and some of these
may be close to being in the "have cash-seek business" category. I'm just not
logical or consistent here, I guess. One for you to check in this possible dual
category might be ECOM (I have it on my watch list.)

Hard to figure these oil/gas exploration plays.

Gasoline prices coming down as demand drops as recession nears and people
afraid(?) to travel.

We, as a country, may make more of an effort to be less dependent on foreign
(Arab) oil. That could be through more social pressure (patriotism?) for
conservation (decrease demand => lower stock prices) or having increased
incentives for domestic exploration (increased oil prices and/or more tax
breaks for oil companies => higher stock prices?)

Possible that Arab oil countries might again use their oil supplies as a
weapon. Or their terrorists interrupt supplies. Oil prices could surge quickly
again => higher stock prices

On the assumption that stock prices of the e&p companies will ebb and flow with
current events, that maybe we're closer to lows than highs, but if not, that I
can hold on through declines that will occur, I'll add just a little to my

I'll start a position in CLHL today.

http://www.carlisleholdings.com/index.php3?page=4

negatives:

Hodge-podge company
-Has banking interests in Belize. What's that all about?

Overly diversified for its capital structure?
-Staffing services is a tough/rough business to be in now.

Too much insider (chairman's) control?

Possible that larger companies (ABM) freeze out competitors by locking clients
into long-term contracts. CLHL also at risk if they (CLHL) improperly structure
fixed-price contracts.

Hurt by WTC collapse

A thinly-traded, two-buck stock no one's heard of or cares about?

positives:

With low stock price ($2-2.15 - perhaps an 8 year low), price/sales at .1 is
low, and price/book at .3 is low.
Ltd/eq should be manageable at .2.

If company can one again earn .68/sh (it did this or
better in '96,'97,'99,'00), that'd be a too-low (imo) p/e of 3 if current stock
price did not advance.

Some of CLHL's businesses are necessary even in a recession: facilities
maintenance (janitorial services, building maintenance and repair) and manned
security.
--------------
In looking at this sector, the safer/bigger/better company seems to be ABM
based on track record. (It's a nice dividend-grower too). I choose CLHL because
a large capital gain (percentage-wise from about $2.10) seems very feasible.

Spekulatius, I am watching both companies also. And I agree with your

ENE (now at $19.79/sh). I calculate fair value at best about $28/sh. That's IF
they can ever get their ROE to where it was back in '95-'96 and if we don't see
increased interest rates from here.
I've worked with people who were previously employed at ENE, and they've told
me ENE is one Very Tough place. Enron people are very lean/mean competitors,
and their trading desk takes no prisoners, I'm told. This company will once
again get institutional interest imo, and the stock might very well be a good
investment 12-18 months out. Maybe. For now, I waiver in what to do.

I've recently been going through my pharmaceutical stocks - taking profits in
ones I guess are fully-valued and trying to find ones that are relatively
undervalued. PHA is a potential buy for me, and it's on my watch list.

BMY: holding (some additional shares purchased/sold in short term trading
attempt)
ELN: holding
MRK: sold some and bought some back. (Added to position at higher price than

NVS: holding (starter position)
AKZOY: holding; recent purchase (Co. has pharma. component)
KNBWY: holding; recent exploratory purchase only (Co. has pharma.

AHP: took profits, exited position (last year)
AVE: took profits, exited position (last year)
PFE: took profits, exited position (last year)
ABT: continuing to take profits, position mostly gone
BAX: (not usually classified as a pharma. co.) taking profits now
CHIR: (not really a pharma. co.) took profits, exited position.

Enron, etc.

Bought Enron (ENE) at $15.60. This is 50% off of prices earlier this week.
Management credibility has been gutted based on a lack of transparency.
Management says S&P and Fitch have reaffirmed bbb+ ratings. Prudential issues
"sell" based on "not what we know" but "don't know". The worst case scenario
seems to be the company having to issue $1 - 2 billion in equity to maintain
their investment grade rating. At 7.3x re-affirmed 2002 eps of $2.15 and 8.7x
2001 eps of $1.80 and the company trading at 5 year lows, I am stepping up for
some uncertainty. I don't know the facts and am relying on the market and the
credit agencies not being this stupid for this long about Enron.

Added to Owens Illinois (OI) in the $4s. The company says unexpected strong US
glass demand from the Smirnoff Ice type beverages will force them to source
production from Canada. Company reported 44c versus 41c expected. Asbestos
gross payments still flattish around $240m annually... insurance proceeds seem
to be ending. The CEO again expressed confidence that energy price increases
will go into effect Jan 1. The company expects to be cash-flow positive next
year and is trading at 3.2 times 2002 eps of $1.40. Management believes that
the market is not looking at OI because of the asbestos taint. I accept their
presentation of the asbestos problem and am encouraged that management thinks
this is the story and there is no greater liquidity/business performance issue.

I've started positions (mostly underwater now) in mutual fund managers
(Stillwell (SV), Franklin Resources (BEN), and Amvescap (AVZ)). I have never
owned them before but was impressed with Marty Whitman's description of the
basic business model. Revenues are based on a straight percentage of assets
under management in the 1 to 2% range. Even in a down market they get their
cut. As the markets improve, profitability improves. These stocks can be bought
with earnings yields of 6 to 7 percent. Apparently, historically the earnings
yield can go to 10 percent, but I am not waiting for that given the 10 year
bond yielding 4.6 percent.

Spek, Wallace, Brendan: re. Enron:

Brendan, I've followed you into ENE. At current price the numbers (price/book,
div yield, figures you gave) look attractive. With the analyst's uncommon
"sell" rating issued and 75 million shares trading, I am hoping most people who
want out of this stock are getting out, and the selling pressure will abate.

Reflecting on what my business colleagues told me about Enron, I believe I
mis-characterized it. It wasn't their point that the Enron managers were just
lean & mean. They were MEAN and lean. As in nasty and rough mean - even when
they didn't have to be. Apparently carries over to the way they treat
shareholders too, as I now see. (cf: Motley Fool ref. in Yahoo news)

The company is too big and its people too focused not to be a big force in
energy. 18 months from now, the top managers' and BOD's shabby performance will
have faded in the background -- maybe. And the stock should/could/might
recover.

Only a small bet for me though until the the stock steadies and/or I can assess
better.

I'll try again with BLX. They primarily make short term loans to Latin America
companies/banks to finance trade. (primarily exports to USA)

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=blx&d=t

Negatives are:

Potential disruptions/decline in trade due to increased security
measures/recession.

Potenitial - if not probable - default by Argentina on huge loans. IMF may not
bail them out this time. Many Argentinian banks are stockholders in BLX. They
might have to sell their shares. I'll guess that even if BLX business is safe,
news will headline Argentina default (if it happens), and this could further
lower the price of any US-listed Latin American stock related in any way to
Argentina (or Brazil)

Stock has traded lower - cratered, imo - when investors have lost confidence in
prior foreign trade crisis (i.e Asia in '98).

Competitor is having accounting issues and may be overextended or may not have
properly assessed its credit risks. Perhaps an issue for investors with BLX too
- of not knowing much about BLX loans or customers.

Not that much revenue growth.

Positives:

Good history of fairly steady 14% on ROE. Stock price below book value. Stock
price has come down from highs of this year. Company reports very
difficult/challenging business environment now, but stock still at a good p/e
(I assume earnings will not crater), and good dividend yield. Their loans -
from what I guess - are mostly short term in nature. Latin American countries
will still want to export to USA.

Steadily rising dividends; common stock buyback in place.

Geoffrey Wren: REITs.

My opinion is you might want to solidify some of your ideas before accepting
specific recommendations to review.

1. REITS are in diverse categories. You will need to figure if you will
concentrate within a category or diversify among categories to spread risk.

2. You are coming late to the party. Buys aren't so obvious (if they ever were)
now.

3. Some REIT dividends include a significant component called "return of
capital". Which means that that portion is not taxable if the REIT is held in a
taxable account. But if the REIT is held in an IRA, you could be paying tax on
that portion. (since everything that comes out of an IRA is taxable.) I'm
saying it's possibly not an optimum decision to just simply place all
high-dividend REITs in a non-taxable account.

Imo, if you will go to Richard Baron's thread called "REITS - Buying 1 - 2
weeks before going ex-dividend" and seek suggestions there, you will be well
served. You can get good sources of information and good suggestions for REIT
categories to consider plus specific stocks too. (Don't let the thread name
dissuade you. Many, if not most of the guys there seem to be long-term buy and
holders.)

just my two cents,
and I've been wrong many, many times

and congratulations on having a nice run in GNSS. Seems to be one of the few
tech stocks that's had such an ascent lately.

Brendan, tax consequences: I'm no tax expert, and the only tax advice I am
implying is to "see your tax advisor" for the wisest approach to holding REITs

I look at it this way: Regarding federal taxes: An IRA is a tax-deferrable
vehicle. If you control what goes into it, you can put in say, REITs or growth
company stocks, or junk bonds or municipal bonds or etc. Those investments grow
(tax-free) until you begin to make withdrawals. When withdrawals are made,
EVERY dollar that comes out (i.e. that is withdrawn) is subject to tax at the
person's then current tax rate. That means the "return of capital" dollars that
went in, and, for example, any municipal bond interest dollars that went in
that otherwise would be exempt from federal taxes -- these dollars come out
subject to tax. (I use 'subject to tax' rather than "they get taxed" because
there seem to be many exclusions, off-sets, tax brackets, tax angles, etc. with
the federal tax code such that the actual tax dollars (if any) one actually
pays might depend on one's particular circumstances at withdrawal times.)

We're not talking here about a ROTH IRA, where the point with the ROTH is that
nothing (Big?) that comes out of it (is withdrawn) is federally taxable, if
ROTH rules are followed.
(Again, I'm not competent here. For example, I don't know the relationship
between ROTH withdrawal amounts and how that might affect or be affected by any
"alternative minimum tax" calculations.)

Are these tax considerations not true in general (without having specific tax
and situational knowledge)??

Date:10/26/2001 1:35:45 PM
From:Brendan W
This is how I see it. The only "tax basis" you have in an IRA for reducing the
ordinary income tax bite when taking withdrawals is the sum of the
non-deductible IRA contributions you made. This sum should not be reduced until
you make actual withdrawals from the IRA. I don't think the tax law "cares"
about what you buy, sell, or receive as distributions as long as the
investments qualify (i.e., I don't think you can own land, or your own
business, or uncovered puts in the IRA). The IRA is substantially like a black
box where the law looks at what comes in and out.

Anyway, my angina is over because I hold my REITs in a Roth. I, too, just have
a lay understanding.

Well, I have liquidated most of my CLHB position recently.
The stock jumped from $2.25 to $4.90 on news they did Brokaws office for
anthrax.
I missed the day it really jumped but got out of my position over the next few
days at about $3.40 avg.
They announced their second straight quarter of poor earnings comps. There has
not been much insider buying of late and I do not think the anthrax cleanup
will mean as much as the market is expecting for them over the next few years.
It will help, sure. Just a matter of degree.

2 more things. I was NOT pleased with their refinancing a few months back. I
had hoped for a better rate and they ended up giving a whole lot of 1 cent
options too.
Perhaps my biggest reason for getting out is the fact that a whole lot of
clueless neophytes are hyping the crap out of it on the yahoo board. I tend to
want to be on the opposite side of that kind of mania.

I have traded CLHB well for many years. My average cost was probably in the
$1.80 range. My guess is eventually these shares will retreat and I will be
able to get back in.

Honestly, if not for the anthrax thing, I suspect the shares might have fallen
below $2 on the recent quarters results.

Finally, I have a hard time owning a stock hoping for more Anthrax problems so
it will get more business.

I will begin buying back at $2 and expect the shares to go back to $1.50
eventually as these johnny come latelys realize they did not strike gold.

Hi Guys,

Been awhile since I've posted but always been lurking.

Was wondering if anybody has looked at OCCF as a 'special situation' stock. Not
sure if it qualifies under any other value criteria.

Amazing story of a founder of a successful company who uses his controlling
interest of stock in his own company (~95% of outstanding shares) as collateral
for margin loans, makes many bad investments and now is faced with the
brokerage firms selling his entire holdings on the open market to pay back the
loan.

I won't go into the details unless there is interest but the story serves as a
warning to those that buy stock with borrowed money! A good cautionary tale.

Great work on the thread guys. I am still waiting a bit longer on Enron myself
- where there is smoke...

LHO. Yes, could go much lower. I'd say though the stock already reflects quite
a bit of the bad news people expect. At some point the stock has got to be
selling below replacement value. (Of course, if people believe LHO will never
be able to rent a satisfactory number of their available rooms or rent them
only at lousy rates, then the value of the assets is greatly diminished,
replacement value or not.) I'll ride LHO down and assume better times will come
again. If they do and if LHO remains a REIT, some dividends have got to be
reinstated eventually.

Perhaps, with the stock down and tax loss selling coming soon, maybe more
people will give up on this stock, and the price will go lower. On the other
hand, the dividend cut to one cent today could be near the low point. Hard for
me to believe that such a sharp drop in investors' sentiment about this stock
recently(see chart) really reflects LHO's intrinsic value. We'll see.

Sold Enron. Added others.

I closed Enron at $13.76 at a small profit... I had added in the $11s bringing
my average cost down into the $13s. After seeing my original purchase decrease
30 percent I regretted ignoring some bad experience with complex accounting. I
will re-start a position if it tests its lows again.

Added to Pacificare (PHSY) at $16.67. Cash EPS still looks to exceed $4.00 in
2001 ($1.70 eps, $2.30+ in amortization). They got a new bank facility that
lasts till 01/2003 and they are paying a 6% interest rate. The cost of capital
discrepancy puzzles me. The one concerning thing on the call today was there is
apparently contingent liability when they exit capitated contracts if the
provider network is not sufficiently capitalized. Medical cost ratios declined
70 basis points but they are still dangerously high (89%).

Continue to add to PCL, UNM, EOP.

Sold Ford (F), Brunswick (BC). I'm lightening on consumer durables given that
the market seems to be pricing such a short recession and I'm not so sure.

I stand somewhat corrected on characterizing the tax law's general treatment of
IRAs as a black box in my last post. Apparently, one is taxed on a security's

Thanks for the feedback. Nice entry price for ISTN. With the unusually large

Over the next few months, I hope the buyback in tandem with a small-cap effect
will start to kick in. However, I will be willing to hold onto this for quite
awhile unless fundamentals change or the price runs up. (This patient value
style worked for me on MOVI, where for about a year I looked like an idiot,
buying at 4-4.50 and seeing it drop to 3.50, until it finally skyrocketed to
$30+ on a split-adjusted basis).

Picked up WM today. Avg cost 27.72. On next years estimate of 3.94 the PE of 7
is at a 67% discount to the S&P 500 based on it's est next year earnings. Both
estimates are probably high, but this discount seems more than a bit overdone.
There was a lot of talk about the yeild curve flatting thus cutting into spread
profits. The idea is that by eliminating the 30yr, demand would migrate to the
10yr and lower mortgage rates will result. Hogwash! Demand will migrate, but so
will supply -discontinuing the 30yr did nothing to curtail gov't spending, with
the war and fiscal stimulus and homeland security, spending is in vogue. This
will result in higher rates down the road not lower. And that means higher not

I would 2nd McSweet's ETT endorsement with these further comments: The
emergence of Genesis from BK has restored confidence in FFO. Dividend
restoration should follow soon: Based on current price of 8.25, projected FFO
of 1.48, Est Div 1.20 [83% with conservative adj]
Return to AVERAGE yield for HC REITS [with outliers removed] would imply 72%
share price gain
Return to 10% yield [Higher due to concentrated GHV exposure] would imply 45%
share price gain.
Add that to the dividend. Michael Walker is CB of both and owns chunk of
ETT...his Genesis shares evaporated in the BK, so likelihood of Genesis
screwing ETT is slim, IMO.

A few years ago when Greenspan was raising fed rates we saw a contraction of
WAMU's stock price because of the resultant squeeze on their margins. Most
thrifts suffered then. The recent fed cuts, which make it cheaper to borrow
money, have fueled a surge of mortgage business as buyers move to take
advantage of lower rates through both refinancing and new loans.

Savings and loans stocks are generally viewed as defensive plays. They perform
best when the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates and the stocks of more
fast-growing companies, like technology firms, are falling. Banking analysts
say that much of the money that's poured into S&L stocks during the past year
came from money managers rotating out of tech stocks. If you're convinced the
economy has bottomed out and tech companies are ready to get back on track,
then you might not want to buy WAMU. But I think there's a lot of uncertainly
about the economic recovery.

I follow WAMU for my investment club; this summer I put together these 9
reasons why we need - and should increase - our "portfolio anchor" of WAMU:

1. Washington Mutual has a history of successfully integrating acquisitions. In
Feb they bought Bank United ($18b in assets) and in April they acquired Fleet
Mortgage ($6 bil in assets). They also recently bought the mortgage arm PNC
Financial Services Group Inc. Dime has assets of about $27 billion.

2. Size counts, and so does geographic coverage. WAMU is now the largest thrift
in the country (assets of $220 billion) and they would likely make bids for
other East Coast banking companies if it succeeds in buying Dime. (Remember
they are already in the greater Atlanta area.) As they grow and integrate, they
Increase efficiency, lowering relative costs while increasing scale.

3. Favorable interest rate reductions lead to better margins. S&P says in their
last WAMU report, "A wider net interest margin will drive an increase of over
40% in net interest income....Non interest income should also climb more than
40%, bolstered by higher mortgage banking revenues resulting from refinancing
activity......we anticipate EPS will advance about 32% in 2001." And WAMU's
trailing PE is 9.6 or so for a company growing at over 20%! (Yes, we must
remember that banks are valued differently than tech stocks and that S&P - like
other Street analysts - may be overly optimistic and their estimates should be
taken with a grain of salt. Still, that's good growth at a very reasonable
price.)

4. Because WAMU is both a lender and a mortgage banker, they can generate
income throughout different interest rate environments with products and
services like commercial banking, consumer finance, securities brokerage,
mutual fund management and property/casualty/life insurance, and CDs. They
attract new checking account customers with no-fee checking, and then can
cross-sell other products.

5. They have a strong and growing brand. It test well, perhaps because of the
connotation of George Washington, or perhaps because people associate
"Washington" with the word "trust," D.C., or whatever. The brand has
successfully crossed the chasm from local thrift ("The friend of the family")
to national player.

6. The Occasio retail concept pioneered in Las Vegas has broken all internal
expectations. It's innovative. It's low cost. Customers like it. It tests well.

7. They have a higher quality loan portfolio than some of the larger banks,
mainly because of WAMU's emphasis in residential, rather than commercial,
loans. They seem to take fewer loan risks.

8. They know how to treat customers. In May, WAMU was the winner of the
Satmetrix Best Customer Satisfaction Award for the financial services category.
"Washington Mutual distinguished itself further by being one of only a few
national banks to score higher than its regional competitors." WAMU uses
comprehensive feedback systems and a number of incentive programs to assess and
reward high levels of customer satisfaction.

9. They have a seasoned management team that's been together for many years.
They know how to grow. They are innovative risk-takers with a conservative,
careful bent, in my opinion.

K Thanks for the WAMU input. The 9 points were deeper into qualitative issues
than I'd gotten. While it's received wisdom that this isn't the best time in
the cycle for financials, WAMU isn't a deep cyclical. There are instruments to
hedge various adverse rate scenario's and I just don't see the kind of
flattening or reaction to flattening that the market is fussing about. Here's a
historic yield curve charter
http://www.smartmoney.com/onebond/index.cfm?story=yieldcurve
play with that and long term chart of WAMU...it just doesn't justify a 7 PE on
forward estimates. Even if the estimate was off by 50% it would be at an
attractive multiple. And this is too big and too followed to have that big of a
miss [If subprime were a significant part, I'd be more concerned, but it's less
than 6% of loan portfolio and is carefully selected....lot's of subprime is
sold].
Thanks again for your comments.

Financials look attractive to me compared to other restaurant stocks. They are

Back into Enron at $11.04.

Can management screw this up any better? Still no help on the transparency. Now
Enron is definitely junk... some of their bonds' yield-to-maturity exceed 20
percent. The credit rating agencies are trying to "help" Enron by deferring
removing their investment grade. Yet their bankers are now insisting on
collateral for the new banking facility. The smell is bad.

Sold Medallion Financial at $8.03 for a 17% loss. I held it in a taxable
account. I am guessing the quality of their New York taxi medallion collateral
has been compromised. Yet no peep out of the company since August. Combine this
with management issuing equity at $11 which did not please me (which in
retrospect now looks prudent)... I am standing back.

Sold Officemax (OMX) and Office Depot (ODP) with gains of 45% and 104%
respectively. These now look expensive relative their replacement... a purchase
of Linens and Things (LIN) in the low $18s. LIN has no debt and presents itself
as a 15 to 20 percent earnings grower. The trailing eps is $1.36, next year eps
is estimated at $1.52. LIN does not compete very well with BBBY, but it is a
whole lot cheaper than BBBY.

Sold Merrill Lynch (MER) for a 22% loss. Proceeds went into Morgan Stanley
(MWD). MWD is not cheap but its earnings are holding up better.

Sold Conagra Foods (CAG) for a 21% gain (including dividends). This was
discussed over the summer on this thread. The historical earnings growth on CAG
is anemic and I am reinesting the (non-taxable) proceeds into Safeway (SWY) and
Kroger (KR). These grocers are cheap only if you accept their earnings growth
projections of 15%... which I do.

Sold Mellon Financial (MEL) for a 4% loss. Mellon's earnings projection has
been gutted. Proceeds went into State Street (STT) and Bank of New York (BK).
STT is comparable on a current year PE basis and it's earnings growth
expectations are both higher and more certain. BK is substantially cheaper on a
current year PE basis.

Sold Manpower (MAN) for a tiny profit. It's 2002 earnings projection have been

You have good points on WAMU, however, unless you are intimately familiar with
their underwriting guidelines, I'm not sure of the validity of your point 7.

"....7. They have a higher quality loan portfolio than some of the larger
banks, mainly because of WAMU's emphasis in residential, rather than
commercial, loans. They seem to take fewer loan risks...."

I don't know that I would concede that a higher percentage of residential
mortgages is inherently safer than a portfolio of commercial loans. The key (at
least for me) is the delinquency and default rate of the portfolio, which is
dependent on the quality of underwriting. Since underwriting guidelines and
policies can change without notice (i.e a new head of underwriting, change in
management or management philosophy, or change in product mix), the evaluation
of the risks embedded in the loan portfolio by an outside party appears to be
largely a matter of speculation.

Just my two cents.

Dyer & Shuman Announces Class Action Suit On Behalf of Purchasers of
Sport-Haley Securities
DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2001--The Denver, Colorado, law firm of Dyer &
Shuman, LLP today announced that a class action has been commenced in the
United States District Court for the District of Colorado on behalf of
purchasers of Sport-Haley, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPOR - news) common stock during the
period between September 4, 1996, and October 16, 2000, inclusive (the ``Class
Period'').

If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the court no later than
60 days from November 2, 2001. If you wish to discuss this action or have any
questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact
plaintiff's counsel, John M. Martin of Dyer & Shuman, LLP at 800/711-6483 or
303/861-3003 or via e-mail at jmartin@dyershuman.com. Dyer & Shuman, LLP has
extensive experience in securities class action litigation, and has played lead
roles in major securities fraud cases in Colorado and throughout the nation,
resulting in the recovery of hundreds of millions of dollars to investors. Any
member of the purported class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff
through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an
absent class member.

The complaint charges Sport-Haley and certain of its officers and directors
with violations of Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint alleges that during
the Class Period, Sport-Haley continually reported artificially inflated
earnings via false and misleading press releases and filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''). As a result, on October 16, 2000,
the company announced that it would be forced to restate its financial
statements for the 1998 and 1999 fiscal years. This disclosure prompted the
NASDAQ to suspend trading of Sport-Haley stock. It also prompted the SEC to
commence an informal inquiry.

On November 6, 2000, the company announced the extent of its restatements.
Specifically, defendants admitted that they had materially overstated the
company's earnings for the 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 fiscal years, and that the
company would restate its net income for the year ended June 30, 1998, from
$4.3 million to $2.5 million, and from $814,000 to $147,000 for the year ended
June 30, 1999. When the NASDAQ finally resumed trading, the company's stock
initially lost 37% of its value. Moreover, after receiving documents from the
company and interviewing company employees, the SEC began a formal
investigation into possible violations of the federal securities laws.

I'll take on that Forbes guy about what he says is Ben Graham's formula.

That's not the formula I see in my copy of "Intelligent Investor" (p. 158. '73
edit.) There's no factor. (i.e. 4.4 divided by some bond rate number)

The Value is based on current or normal earnings, according to Dr. Graham. So
imo, even if we're close to being in year 2002, the earnings figure for the
example PFE ought to be 1.31 (est. '01) not the Fool's 1.59 (est. for yr.
ending 12/'02). I wouldn't be surprised if an argument were made that even the
'01 figure is too much of an estimate.

I don't get the four caveats the Fool says Dr. Graham provided. Number 3, for
example, "Eliminate all firms with share prices above net working capital per
share." That eliminates so many firms, including the Fool's own aforementioned
PFE.
(I show PFE with current assets - current lia. = $7.6B. And a market cap. of
$266B.)

It's too bad, Dr. Graham can't speak for himself. Unless he had changed his
ideas over the past 25 years, I'd guess he wouldn't want the bulk of his
teachings to be boiled down to a formula that so heavily uses projections of
future earnings and earnings growth rates.

Also, the Fool didn't go quite far enough, imo. Because they left out an
important warning. That is, PFE is trading at $42-$42.50 and the formula gives
$52 as PFE's value. "If you were to take this as gospel (and you better not),
you might conclude that the stock is about 25% undervalued at current prices."
It's not so much that the value might be or might not be $52 or that PFE is
undervalued. For many readers of the article it's at what amount under 52 could
the stock be considered a buy by Graham's methods? (The article
"hints?/implies? that it might/(might not?) be the current price.)

For Dr. Graham's enterprising investor (as compared to his defensive investor),
Dr. Graham says, (p. 91, '73 edit.)"...the enterprising investor is to buy them
only when obtainable at bargain prices - which we define as prices not more
than two-thirds of the appraisal value of the securities." So, PFE could be
considered a buy only under about $35/sh. For the defensive investor (p.55)
maybe $26 (p/e 20 on a generous 1.31.)

Of course nobody is going to buy based on what some Fool says somebody else
said. I'm just saying undervalued doesn't mean buy-able by Dr. Graham's
methods, and it would've been nice if the author had made such a qualification.

----
Not disagreeing that WM could be a buy here. I'm holding on to my small
position. (My opinion on PFE is that it was fully-valued at 43 when I sold it
last year.)

Let's see. Assuming you used the Fool's formula, you'd have plugged in $3.96/sh
earnings ('02) est. And if you used the Fools other numbers too, then solving
for the growth rate - I get about 10% that you must have used. If I plug that
10% into the Graham model I see in my book, (I'll use the last 4 quarters =
$3.16/sh earnings), I get a value of WM = $90. I can hardly visualize that.
Still, IF WM can grow earnings 10% annually, then $6+/sh. (in 7 years) at a p/e
of 15 would get us there. IF this is all so, then imo, the only significant
question each of us stockholders must ask of ourselves is, "How long am I going
to be willing to hold this stock?"

Re: acquisitions. Yes, it took a while for WM to digest the big acquisition of
Ahmanson two years ago, but that was a case of a small fish swallowing a bigger
fish. I think that was the start of what catapulted WM into being the largest
thrift in the country. The Dime takeover, while still impressive, is a much
smaller target. 

I would also argue that in doing repeated acquisitions over the years a company
learns from the mistakes and creates a level of competence and efficiency.
Cisco is the acknowledged leader in doing this, to the point that they are
studied by visiting management teams. IMO, WAMU is also very good.

Re: They have a higher quality loan portfolio than some of the larger banks,
mainly because of WAMU's emphasis in residential, rather than commercial,
loans. They seem to take fewer loan risks...." Yes, it is somewhat anecdotal
and I haven’t compared default rates with other institutions; it’s something I
heard at an annual meeting I attended. So perhaps they were tooting their own
horn. I know the management team is known for their careful assertiveness. I
hear about all the due diligence they do in everything from researching
takeovers to studying customers. A lot of research and planning went into this
Occasio program.) I know they have sophisticated systems in place for hiring
and in screening loans. (They were featured in a IBD story a while back for
their leading-edge hiring techniques.) And I know that they recently increased
their allowance for bad loans, causing the stock to fall last week. But that
could be for any number of valid reasons, I suppose. I’m not a banker. On the
other hand, I do recall Bank of America had to write off $600 million or so
(two years ago?) for their loan to Sunbeam. It seems to me that the stakes are
just so much higher on the commercial side, especially in today’s economy with
the record number of warnings, lay-offs, and bankruptcies.

Re: the Graham FV calculation. I have never read his book (it’s on my list!)
but I’ll take Paul’s word on it.

FWIW, here is my calculation using the Motley Fool formula. Note that the

I've been dancing with PVN, trading in and out currently at breakeven and in
with a small position @2.14. The value proposition rests on the slender reed
that Merrill says the assets should go for somewhere between book - .50 to book
+ 1.00, that's 7.9 to 9.41. Clearly the market disagrees. Given the relatively
high level of debt to equity in any lending institution, it doesn't take much
erosion of asset value to have an ugly impact on equity. We are now approaching
the point, however, where this could be considered a bit like a warrant or an
unexpiring option [unless the co. expires]. In the event of bankruptcy, which,
I haven't seen mentioned in analyst reports, there seems to be folks that will
bid them up, despite pretty clear evidence that shareholders generally get
wiped out in the final resolution. So I figure the downside is probably
somewhere between here and .50 to .75 [If they filed tomorrrow]. The upside is
something like Merrill's aforementioned 7.90 to 9.40...or whatever someone
might pay. Like ENE, this one is a real shot in the dark, so play with play

SELLING in bold letters. At this point, I'm still in a trading mode on this.
Was a bit surprised it didn't bite just a bit when institutional tax selling
ended OCT 31, but it's been nearly cut in half since them. Perhaps the funds
sold them to traders and market makers that thought it would be done...now
they're unloading.

I am still contemplating about CVS. After the last earnings disappointment, the
stock was reduced by 25%. At 23$ and earnings of 1.6$, we have got a P/E of
14.4. I also like the conservative balance sheet.
The drug prescription market has been growing by at least 10%/year. This would
be CVS's intrinsic minimum growth rate.

Yes, Bob, sorry to say you present a good case for avoiding HLR.

Yes, I'm with you on CVS, Spekulatius. CVS is on my watch list, and I keep
trying to evaluate it, but I can't come to a conclusion I like. I'm still
figuring these drug store companies have oversaturated the country. CVS stock
looks expensive to me based on absolute numbers. Also based on other stocks
that are available that look more undervalued (to me). But based on relative
numbers (CVS's historical record for p/bk, p/sales, p/e), the stock is a buy.
Debt/eq is fairly low - they've got the ability to expand as they see
opportunities. OTOH, there are competitors out there who also have expansion
plans and resources too.

Aside: nice move on your PHA since you mentioned it here. Sorry I was not quick
enough to establish a starting position.

Paul: It's a very incomplete, quicktake case, so there may be offsetting
positives. Sometimes I'm reluctant to present negatives since a posted holding
represents a positive view based on research. But I feel it's better to get it
here than in the market. I always appreciate hearing the other side of the
story...and this thread has saved me a chunk of change by offering it up from
time to time.
Blew out my PVN position flat this morning...I indicated in the post that this
would be traded. There's still a lot of selling pressure out there.

good timing- sometimes with these its hard to tell if there is really good
value or is one just a moth near the candle and sooner or later the wings are
going to get burnt off. I found it interesting that that the CEO of Conseco
purchased a million shares at $2.50 the other day. The media made a big deal of
this and the stock immediately surged. However this represents only a fraction
of his $45MM signing bonus. ENE continues to drop- an ominous sign. It will
certainly bounce but the question is when.

Starting to reduce GAN position today. My thanks to the person here who posted
to me (4/'00) and encouraged me to hold this one. Has been very helpful advice
to me.

(Just losing my confidence with GAN is all----> no company facts involved here;
my comfort level with GAN has gone to discomfort, so I'll take some $ off the
table here.)

Any ideas for parking extra cash ? ING is down to 3.5%.
Are there any convertables or preferred issues with a good dividend that are
not likely to lose principle ?

I am just SCARED to go hogwild buying stocks and need a short term place to
park cash.
