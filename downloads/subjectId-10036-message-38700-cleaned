Hi Paul - Followed your trade on BDN-PC and peeled off 30% to take my seed
money off the table. This one was bought between 11/2008-3/2009 at prices
between $7.40/share-$9.00/share.

Big thanks to Grommit for alerting the board to these opportunities. An
excellent example of a discounted "value" asset selling for $0.50 on the $1.00.

RE: Brandywine Realty Trust 7.50% S (BDN-PC)

Now the challenge is to find a home for the funds that yields 7.5% and is
undervalued so as to be a multi-bagger in the future.

SEMX.PK @ 24$ emerging from bankruptcy play

40M shares out, 986M$ in book value (~25$/share), ~500M$ in debt. Last
quarter's earnings about 9M$ (0.2$/share) net, 54M$ EBITDA.

Some will remember Semgroup, who went belly up in 2008 because the owner did
speculate in crude futures. todays business is less exiting, thew own pipelines
for crude and gas, gathering systems, terminals etc. with mostly fee based
revenues.

The re-orged in late 2009 with an estimated equity value per share of 25$.
Earnings are not great yet but it seems like the financial results are getting
better for a variety of reasons

1) Some customer who left during bankruptcy are coming back
2) New pipeline and terminal assets coming online
3) Cost related to bankruptcy are mostly gone
4) Interest cost (Currently ~10%) will be reduced

From my point of few, these look like very nice hard assets that are trading at
a discount to other comparable assets. many of these assets (if not most) could
easily be folded into an MLP which would unlock value. I also assume that
post-bankruptcy asset values are conservative (management has not incentive to
create a tall bar for themselves). the company as actually underleveraged with
a 2:1 Equity/Debt ratio (most pipeline companies run at about 1:1 and achieve
BBB rating). The PE is still a little high but i think this could change very
rapidly if earnings improve further.

Any thought? I bought a starter today, but I think it'll fish for more. SEMX.PK
is trading in the pink sheets but at a healthy volume (around 500k shares).

re MSFT - what makes you buy MSFT, it's so not Madharry -like <g>? While I
think it's cheap with 12x Earnings it's huge market cap while make it difficult
for this stock to make am move unless the market moves too.

I am also somewhat concerned that MSFT core business Office/Window business may
get eroded by a combo of Apple and Android (for tablet PC) systems. They do
have some good arrows in the quiver (like the gesture recognition for the XBox
and Bing) but none of those could make up for market share erosion in their
core business.

FWIW, I believe that the Ipad and the Android based tablet PC's could be
gamechanger and replace a lot of Note/Netbooks. A lot of Note/netbooks are
nowadays used for media consumption/email access and internet and all those
things can be done with a tablet PC as well. Tablet PC's will be lighter,
cheaper to build and have a better user interface and will probably NOT run
Window 7. GOOG's Android operating system which right now us distributed for
free seems to be a huge hit with Smartphones and I think the Tablet will run on
something similar.

Since all the growth in the PC sector came from Note/Netbooks, the profit
impact of loosing a lot of this market could be huge for MSFT.

Bigger cap companies: BPKEF.pk, CRZO, CSCTF.pk, EOG, FRHLF.pk, KWK, MDU, NBL,

I'll step up for a start in HES on Monday. I'm primarily now adding to small

them even as they move up - if I can still find price under nav or if they seem
to have a lot of opportunities in their acreage in those oil shales I'm
interested in. Every few years I get in a spot where I find a sector that looks
really, really good to me. These small e&p's seem to be it now for me. Of

re NSRGY - interesting to go back and look at how some LT holdings are doing. I
still have those shares from the purchase done in 2003. The stocks was
purchased in Euro and has increased by 110% in 7 years.

if I calculate the dividend yield in Euro - my purchase price in CHF was 17.62
Euro and the shares pay 1.11 Euro (1.6 CHF/1.435) are about 6.2% on my purchase
price.

If I add the dividend yield to my appreciation, I get and IRR of about
14%/year. This is not enough to make someone rich of course. Currently the PE
ratio seems to be about 15.5 so it's a little bit more expensive than it was in
2003. They still have the L'Oreal stake that I have mentioned back then. I
think there is a good chance that a buyer at current levels will make a 10%
annualized return on his investment, including dividends.

Well I also have a LT investment in RBS, purchased in 2007. It lost about 90%
of it's value. At least I did not participate with the capital raises.
Survivorship bias is powerful.

FRHLF does not seem undervalued to me on the face of it: enterprise value
exceeds nav.

Company though owns a lot of land in oil shale plays in which I'm interested.
Freehold will eventually lease these out to get royalty payments on oil
produced. I'm hoping and expecting that there's a lot of oil there that can be
extracted.

Rate to unitholders now is C$.14, which annualized is C$1.42, after the current
Canadian 15% tax is taken out. C$1.42 is about 9% on a US$15.9 stock price.
Royalty streams will continue, albeit cash to unitholders may be less initially
after the corporate conversion. Or before, if bod changes distn. amounts.

hit until 2012 (if I remember correctly.))

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: IGK/IDG, NRF-A/B, UVIC, GPOR,
EBIX, GILD, FR-J/K, COPJF.

New positions: MA
Positions increased: UVIC, PBEGF
Positions reduced: AEH
Positions eliminated: CPBY, MILL, OXY

With market mostly going up, the number of cheap companies has gone down. I
have started a small position in MA. MA is not cheap and faces regulatory fee
restrictions. It is also affected by worldwide consumer recession that lowers
the transaction amount. Finally, I am not sure whether competition with V, AXP
and novel payment solutions is as benign as expected. So I wouldn't say that MA
is a great buy. However, it is attractive for more research and investigation.

I sold my gambling position in MILL. MILL's financial statements are pretty
weird in my opinion and I'd rather not hold the stock of a cat in a big bag.

CPBY is another company with not pretty financial statements. Over 80M billed
and unbilled (2/3!) A/R is too much for my peace of mind. Sold.

I did not like OXY's purchase of Citi's commodities trading operation, so I
finally exited the position. Somewhat too late though.

With the pref share runup, I have reduced my AEH position and may reduce
others.

I purchased some PBEGF to partially replace the OXY and MILL positions.

Hi Jurgis -

The July 2010 McDep report (pg-7-) shows FRHLF with a McDep ratio of 0.89.

http://www.mcdep.com/rtweek100701.pdf

A McDep ratio of 1.0 signifies "fair" value (ie EV/PV) so one could conclude
FRHLF is 11% undervalued but several of the Candian Income Trusts have a McDep
ratio below 0.90.
<pre>
Pengrowth Energy Trust (PGH) 0.88
Penn West Energy Trust (PWE) 0.87
Enerplus Resources Fund (ERF) 0.76
Canadian Oil Sands Trust(COSWF) 0.69
</pre>

For a high yield U.S. company you might want to look at is Hugoton Royalty
Trust (HGT). They have a McDep ratio of 0.90 and yield 7.2%. Other U.S. company
notables based on a low McDep ratio is Berry Petroleum Company Common (NYSE:
BRY) and Whiting Petroleum Corporation C(NYSE: WLL).
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HGT,BRY,WLL&d=s

The article below provides a pretty good description of how they calculate the
McDep ratio.

There is no explaination in either of the reports as to how the valuation is
impacted by a change in the corporate structure but it appears that the
Canadian Unit Trusts still sell at a discount to their U.S. corporate
equavalent companies. However it is hard to quantify the exact amount.

Five Pure Plays in Reawakening Oil and Gas
by: Kurt Wulff June 28, 2010 | about: CRT / DMLP / FRHLF.PK / PBT / SBR
http://seekingalpha.com/article/212121-five-pure-plays-in-reawakening-oil-and-g
s?source=yahoo

From the article:"...McDep Ratios range from 0.96 to 1.12. The denominator,
Present Value, is a median 13.8 times unlevered cash flow. PV/Ebitda depends on
reserve life and whether the resource is natural gas or oil. We attribute the
apparent disparity between reserve life and cash flow multiple for DMLP and SBR
compared to CRT and PBT to restrictions on operating information available to
royalty owners and differing interpretation of reporting rules. Actual volume
history paints a more consistent picture. The same considerations apply to
FRHLF where we have boosted reported reserves with the addition of probable
quantities that Canadian companies provide...."

I continue to hold Penn West Energy Trust (PWE) McDep ratio 0.87 and Enerplus
Resources Fund (ERF) McDep ratio 0.76.

PWE released their earnings last Friday and I plan to buy a few shares Monday
as the stock sold off for no apparent reason (to me) based on their report.

re E-K_S - i look at the McDep ratio and find it an very iffy measure. The
problem as always is how to calculate the NPV.

As for PWE, i actually think it's overvalued because I my opinion, it cannot
sustain a 8.4% distribution. Just look at production and reserves / share as a
metric. This year again, production is down 10% (due to the partial sale of the
heavy oil partnership) which just seem to be a continuation of the trend that I
have observed a couple of years. Sharecount is up another 5% - gop figure.

If you have a stock yielding 8% that shrinks by 3% overall then you really
getting only 5% yield on your money, the rest is returen of capital. it's one
of the reasons I don't like producer (Oil/Gas) MLP's at all. Some Producer
MLP's can sustain yields for a while if they are able to issue new shares (to
buy new producing assets) for a while - this works as long as the shares trade
at valuation that acquisitions can be performed accreditation to the NPV.

once you quote someone a price and its agreed to that's the end of it. He said
he didnt have the authority to make that decision. I asked to speak to his

new innovation and situation that comes up while refusing to return any money
to shareholders..

Windows and xbox is not going away in the near term, and there entrance to
cloud computing and different enterprise segments i suppose is interesting....
But in my opinion Flattening sales, higher R&D spending = contracting PE for me
(similar to RIMM which i have been short since April).

Everytime MSFT comes out with a new product, just like RIMM i want to almost
smile though i hate to see companies struggle because i just know its most
likely not going to end well. With that in mind i bought some JAN 11 $25 Puts
today for $1.70, put my money where my mouth is i suppose.

I would like differing opinions, it is almost nerve racking to be short a big
cap at moment because funds are pouring into these names as they are viewed as
undervalued compared with 2011 earnings.

oh and FYI if you are nervous about your MSFT purchase, instead of buying the
VIX, just buy some puts, implied volatility is coming in around 28% making it
not to expensive for a little protection.

Hi Bordeauxman -

Welcome to the Value Investing thread. I see that you are a recent member to SI
and hope the different ideas here help you pick future winners.

I only pay attention to institutional holders if they are known for their value
approach to investing. It reaffirms my pick.

One of my more recent buys was supported by a very large "Buy" from a Sovereign
Wealth Fund. The company was Noble Group L (OTC:NOBGF). Although the company
had doubled in value from when I first discovered it, I started a position
because I liked the assets they owned. I was lucky to have established my
position prior to the announcement that a China sovereign wealth fund became a
minoity owner in NOBGF.

Here is a site that provides a List of Sovereign Wealth Funds and their recent
activity.

http://www.swfinstitute.org/tag/noble-group/

From the article:"...According to the NY Times, “A company here that is partly
owned by the Chinese government has quietly purchased a 5.1 percent stake in
the only American-owned provider of enriched uranium for use in civilian
nuclear reactors. The company that bought the stake, the Noble Group, is the
world’s second-largest commodities trading and logistics company after Cargill
and is based here. One of its minority owners is the Chinese government’s
sovereign wealth fund...."

====================================================================

Therefore, institutional ownership is just more information you can use in your
due diligence. I generally do not put too much weight in the information but I
like it when I am in at a lower price when one of these institutions starts
their position.

I do pay attention to large successful individual equity buyers such as Buffet
or Icahn. Sometimes I will follow them in on their large "buys". MOT is one
example but it has not paid off yet.

Hi and welcome, Bordeauxman.

I generally check Yahoo's Top Institutional Holders for any stock I am
interested in. If one of the mentions is one of the value funds I like, that's
a good sign for me. That would be somebody like Kahn Brothers, Glickenhaus,
Fairholme. Baupost too - always a puzzlement, but also a positive.
Hotchkis&Wiley, Davis Select, Baron Asset/Bamco, Columbia Wanger esp. if Ralph
Wagner is involved, Ariel, FPA, Oakmark, -- man, the list goes on.

Royce Funds for me had a history of being good, then not-so-good, and now
apparently they're seen by some as good again. I'm stuck in the not-so-good,
show-me-otherwise mode. So I rate Royce Funds now as of no consequence to me.

I ignore Fidelity.

Soros Fund is a zero or negative for me. He's got guys who pick for him and
they trade in-and-out too quickly for me. T2 Funds/Tilson is a negative for
me-- He's a media hound (a positive if you're in his pick) who who doesn't seem

Redeemable Preferred Shares
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Colonial-Properties-Trust-bw-4086218556.html?x=0&
v=1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the BDN preferreds were trading at par ($25.00/share) today. I wonder
if this is a trend to just pay them off. It appears that it's all debt over 8%.

From what I see, EKS, it looks it could become standard operating procedure: If
a company's preferreds are callable and they get to par, and the yield is over
7.5%, I'll guess there's a good chance they will be called. Holding a preferred
with such characteristics that trades OVER par, that would be very dangerous of
course.

As for me, with the few individual preferreds I have, if I see that they're
trading close to par, I'm selling. For me, it's not worth it holding for just
the yield, even if it is 7.5-8.5%. The upside to such callable preferreds is
limited when the stock's already so near par. And on the other side, we've seen
in a market drop that these stocks have dived indiscriminately, and they could
again.
Limited upside and unknown-but-possible downside. I don't like that.

re GFRE - it is apparent that there is a lot of concern about the integrity of
the financial statements- the fact that the filing of he 10Q is delayed
certainly added to that. Last year, they filed at 8/10 - this year they are
apparently later.

There is also the overhand from the S3 filing - how much and how will they
raise and for what purpose? 120M$ is almost 40% of the current market cap, so
we are not talking chickensh$t here.

Personally, I don't look at who the Top Institutional Holders or in general
holders (e.g. here on SI) are. I've tried to play this game and mostly it was a
fool's game for me. Even when one saw Buffett buying or selling positions,
following him did not really work for me.

Sure I respect Buffett's positions and arguments about them, I also respect
investments and choices of some other professional investors and a number of
people here on SI. I look at almost every stock someone mentions but ultimately
it's my decision whether I invest or not. Some people have a better fit to my
investing style so I might look at their choices more or sooner, but that's it.

Somebody else buying or selling or holding might have a very tiny influence,
but mostly not. As you saw from other replies, other people here on SI and some
professional investors look at the holder data much more than I do.

Some names create opportunities for buying or selling. Cramer's followers
sometimes pile into a stock which leads to good sell point. Or they sell-off
something which leads to good buy. Still the decision for me is based on a
price and a company and not on what other people do. :)

MA's bull case is well known: global move to cashless society and huge
competitive moat. MA's bear case is pretty well known too: transaction drop due
to recession, government regulation in US (and possibly other countries?),
not-so-friendly competition with V (and AXP, Discover that matter less), new
market entrants in spite of the moat (cell phone operators, etc.). IMHO the two
important bear points are government regulation - MA is a very easy target
globally - and possible huge war with V where MA is in runner-up position.
Also, IMHO the price of MA is still pretty high and margin of safety is not
that great when all things are considered.

 MSFT - Reminds me of (insert analogy here) who was once great but now has been
behind the tech curve for 10 years and who continues to throw money at every
new innovation and situation that comes up while refusing to return any money
to shareholders.. 
Well Windows 7 is a huge hit,Bing is winning market share, Xbox overtakes
Sony's PS3, gesture recognition potentially a huge hit. PE ~12x, iron clad
balance sheet,2% dividend yield, shareholder friendly management (special
dividends). I just don't see the short case at all.

You did not listen. MSFT IS IBM. Already. If you don't realize that, you have
not looked at its business. There is no need of any acquisitions. I completely

Hi Matt -

Re: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)

I started a position in MSFT in 9/2009 at $25.24/share. At that time and now I
consider it a value play. This was the first time I have owned it with my
previous "software" play in ORCL.

One of the reasons I started a position was that MSFT has lots of cash and very
little debt. In fact they are able to pay off their LT debt from net income in
4 months (or 120 days). My Buffet rule is LT debt should be paid off from net
income in four years or less. MSFT can do it in 4 months!

With the credit markets in free fall (back in 2009 and not too much better
now), this was a metric I wanted to have for any new purchase I might make (if
not I must make a good argument why not). Only until the credit market improve
would I change my view for this metric. Cash is King.

Second, their PE is below 10. I like to buy stocks when the PE (or forward PE)
is at 10 or below. It's a simple rule but has worked over the 37 years I have
been investing.

The company has excellent free flow cash flow and they continue to deploy it to
expand their revenue streams. They have not been too effective recently but do
continue to invest in new products for the future while still booking qterly
profits.

Finnally, it is one of a few technology stocks that pay a dividend. Although
small it is 6x the yield I am getting at my local credit union. My downside
risk is small and since I look for a 10% return per year, I have a target of
$30.00/share where I will begin to peel off shares to book my profit.

I already sold 50% of my shares at $30.11/share on 12/09/2009 and continue to
hold the rest as I believe the value I saw in 9/2009 is still there. My
position is small (<.05% of the portfolio) but makes up one of several "value"
technology stocks I own (INTC, GLW, VRGY, HON, DD - their solar cell division,
MOT, NOK).

As you can see, VRGY is the only company that does not pay a dividend. I
received these shares from the Agilant spin off but continue to hold them for
the exposure to the semiconductor sector (they build test equipment). I no
longer hold Agilant (sold in 2009). MSFT is my most pure play in the software
sector. I hold 87 positions in my taxable portfolio and my technology basket of
stocks represent maybe 3% of the total portfolio value.

I suspect other value investors see MSFT the same way I do. The downside risk
is very small (I am a big buyer on any pull back below $20.00/share). The
upside is small too perhaps 20% with a 2% dividend. I earn 2% while I wait for
my $30.00/share target price. I also like the Call Write strategy if I can pick
up cheap shares.

Hi Paul -

Re: Range Resources Corporation (RRC)

Do you still own this one? I am thinking of starting a small position because
of their shale land holdings.

The most recent McDep report (I posted the report earlier) did a profile on
this company which they concluded was fairly valued and a good long term
speculation. Stock is selling near its recent lows too.

http://www.mcdep.com/rtweek100701.pdf

=================================================================

Paying full price but started a position in Waste Management, Inc. (WM). This
is a small position I want to build over time. The dividend is good and their
forward PE is acceptable at 14. This is a defensive play. The company has a bit
more debt I would like. They have increased their dividend every year in the
last 6 years. Comparing WM to Republic Services, Inc. (RSG), I chose WM.

Hi Wallace -

Those are two other good examples INTC and AMAT. I bought INTC (9/2009 @$19.54)
the same time as I bought my MSFT. Never pulled the trigger on the INTC. I had
two opportunities at the $24.00/share level and could have reloaded my
inventory.

At the current price INTC seems like it is in the value range again. I have a
full position now (avg. cost $20.40/share) but may add if it ever reaches the
$17.00/share. My target price of $24.00/share is where I plan to peel off
shares.

I sold my AMAT completely in 11/2008 at around $11.50/share. I am not too sure
I will add unless the dividend yield gets into the 3% range (around
$9.35/share). They cut back significantly on their solar energy division where
they were losing money. This should be where they need to expand and innovate.
Any case the last news story I read was a cut back and no discussion from
management on their next generation research in this area.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AMAT,INTC,MSFT&d=s

It's interesting that several of these Technology leaders are priced at 2008
levels. Many are still the world's innovators and will be around for years to
come.

ADDvantage Technologies Announces Results for Fiscal 2010 Third Quarter
Total Revenue of $13.3 Million and Net Income of $0.14 per Diluted Share
On Tuesday August 10, 2010, 8:00 am EDT

BROKEN ARROW, OK--(Marketwire - 08/10/10) - ADDvantage Technologies Group, Inc.
(NASDAQ:AEY - News) today announced its results for the three and nine month
periods ended June 30, 2010.

Revenue for the three month period ended June 30, 2010 was $13.3 million
compared to $9.1 million in the same period a year ago, an increase of 45%.
Sales of new equipment increased $3.4 million, or 57%, to $9.4 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2010 from $6.0 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2009. Net refurbished equipment sales increased 39%, to $2.5 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2010 from $1.8 million same period last
year. Service revenue remained flat at $1.4 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2010 and 2009.

Net income attributable to common stockholders in the third quarter of fiscal
2010 increased 113% to $1.4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, as compared to
$0.7 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the same period last year.

For the nine months ended June 30, 2010, revenue increased to $35.6 million
from $32.1 million, for the same period last year.

Net income attributable to common stockholders for the nine month period ended
June 30, 2010 was $3.3 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, as compared to $2.3
million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2009.

Ken Chymiak, President and CEO, commented, "We reported strong third quarter
results, which were driven by a $4.1 million increase in sales of new and
refurbished equipment. This increase is primarily attributable to our
customers' demand for headend equipment needed to add channels to their cable
systems or upgrade their equipment to provide HD programming, an overall
equipment supply shortage in the market, which we were able to meet utilizing
our On Hand On Demand business model, and an increase in sales to international
customers, either directly or indirectly via our alliance partners. Equipment
sales also benefited from our new master distribution agreement with Fujitsu
Frontech, which started generating sales in the third quarter. While these are
positive trends, our large and small multiple system operators ("MSO")
customers in the U.S. continued to delay significant plant expansions and
bandwidth upgrades as part of their continued efforts to conserve cash and
limit capital expenditures.

"As we look ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic regarding consumer trends
and will continue to focus on tapping into new or developing markets through
our reseller and distribution partnerships, while managing our inventory and
costs," concluded Mr. Chymiak.

RRC. EKS, I'm out and won't reenter. I'm not interested in their shales. The
exploration on their shale properties is for gas, and I'm buying for oil.

I'm building a position in HES, if it will fall. (Bought some today). I
continue to buy small e&p companies where it looks to me like net asset value
exceeds company's market cap. (Net asset value does fluctuate though depending
on several factors, not the least of which is the price of oil.) Fwiw, I've
posted that I've been buying these recently:

adding to Equal Energy (EQU): Although only 52-55% crude and ngl, I like
company's prospects for oil in its holdings in the Cardium and Pakisko fields.

adding to Arsenal Energy (AEI.to/AEYAF.pk). Bakken/Three Forks play. 2pnpv
(before tax) = $200M, vs. enterprise value of 120.5M sh. out x .82, plus net
debt of $29M = $128M.

adding to Ithaca Energy (IACAF.pk/IAE.v). North Sea. My notes show npv10 =
$832M before tax, with company enterprise value, roughly, = 255M sh. out. x
$1.65sh, plus net cash $6.5M = $427M.

starting a tracking position in Emerge O&G (EME.to): 95% oil. Canadian heavy
oil. Company producing 4800 boe/d now, and forecasts it will hit 7700-8000 by
year-end. If it does, and that's viewed to be sustainable, stock might be at
least a 50% gainer from current price.

==========
Disclaimer: These numbers taken from my notes. I may not have the
latest&greatest numbers that are published by the company; the way I'm
intending to value these companies may not be correct or standard practice; and
I may have made errors in assumptions or fact or in my calculations. In other
words, just as I've been wrong many, many times, I may also be wrong now here
on a number of significant industry/company/analyst aspects that I've failed to
consider properly. I'll keep adding to my positions though.

re ITT, I have been watching this one for a while and decided that today's
price is a good entry point, although I could argue that it's truly cheap. PE
is around 11 but considering that 60% of their earnings are related to defense
and government business that may not be that cheap. Defense peers for example
trade at 9x PE so if I back this out, I would get a PE of around 14 for the
industrial part.

For a variety of reasons, i think that ITT defense business, which is heavily
into infrared optics and electronics 9often weapon system upgrades), is
superior to let's say GD's or LMT big program focus.

Management has done a good job running this business. the defense part has been
providing most of the growth but that is stalling so they want to go from a
60%/40% Defense/industrial to 40%/60% by 2014. This makes sense to me but will
probably depress growth in EPS somewhat since acquisitions in the industrial
sector don't come cheap (see the last 2 pump company purchases). I believe the
sale for CAS is a step in that direction.

Poor cows! They are not underperforming, they are just milk-challenged.

Maybe the capitalist pigs did not cow-municate the party 5-year plans to the
cows correctly. Maybe some cow-munist re-education was needed. But now there's
certainly going to be some cow-munist revolution in China. All cow-mrades of
the world unite! :) Some cows have to be more equal than others!

CLP-D

strangest thing. the pref stock is delisted and is not trading any more. when
these have been called before, I thought that they still traded (at close to
par value) and then a few days before maturity, they delisted. but for this
one, we have to wait until sept 10 to get our money. what if someone really
needed the money?

anyway, I cannot reinvest until sept. 10. so I want the stock market to drop
40% between now and sept 10, because CLP-D was 12% of my portfolio. (bought at
average of $12.70 in 2008 and early 2009)

anyone know -- is this delisting ASAP an unusual case?

Re: CLP-D

It's possible that the broker is changing the CUSIP to reflect it is being
called and the trading "halt" is temporary (48 hours). They probably changed
the symbol to reflect that they are now being called.

From their press release: ... CUSIP 195872403. The redemption date is September
10, 2010 and the redemption price will be $25.00 per Series D Depositary Share
plus accrued and unpaid dividends for the period from August 1, 2010 through
and including the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price per Series
D Depositary Share of $25.2257.

I would think that the security would trade up to the period of the actual
redemption less the settlement period. Check with your broker and see what
their procedure is.

Part of my strategy was to have some of my preferreds redeemed w/ the option to
take the money (less some small discount) and reinvest. This is what occurred
with my "hybrid" preferred stock when Albertsons was acquired by Supervalue.

I traded it on Fidelity where I have my income portfolio; they had added a CL
to the end of the symbol, presumably because it was called.

I got 25.11 which is still the bid. The symbol CLP.PR.D still works on ETrade,

Personally I prefer companies that only have E&P - I think refining is just
baggage. Also I did not particularly like XOM's purchase of XTO, since I prefer
oily vs. gassy companies. However, you'll probably do OK with XOM, it has been
great company so far.

I only own a bit of E in super-major camp.

Yes, MHR's still a buy by the way I look at it -- price to nav.
Not among my favorites for an e&p buy now, but okay, maybe 50% undervalued at
this point. Maybe more so if/as its reserves are increased (and assuming no big
fall in oil price).

Couple other aspects as well: A bet on the jockey (can the CEO repeat his past
performance? -- certainly seems so now), and the company's in some excellent
oil sands areas (imo).

I don't like to step up and in when they're as popular as MHR is now; I'm
focusing on what seem to me to be more obscure plays.

GMXR. EKS, as regards RRC which you like for its shale holdings, I'll mention
one gasser I am buying, GMXR.

GMX resources has contiguous holdings in the Haynesville, Bossier Shale and
Cotton Valley Sands areas. Giving me some confidence, the company says the
Haynesville and Deep Bossier have among the lowest break-even points among all
(or almost all) the major gas shale plays in the US. Secondly, the company
seems to pride itself on its gas hedging activities.

Based on the company's drilling plans, based on the company's expected
financing costs for that drilling, and based on current values, the company has
said its stock price (now about $5.55) might be/could be/should be/ought to be
at about $30.12 by 12/31/2012. Seems like an outrageous statement at this
point. I'm in though (for a few shares), and I'm intending to wait to find out.

===
I believe some investors are going to get rich buying the right e&p companies
now. If only I knew what the right companies were and had the confidence and
desire and guts to make big enough bets on them.

Hi Paul -

Re: GMXR and other E&P companies w/ proven reserves (ie Hard Assets)

Here is my thinking, The 10 year bond market rate is pointing to deflation and
a general concern of a contracting economy. My strategy is to acquire "real"
assets that have an instinct long term value and use my high priced dollars to
buy them.

That's why, I am not too concerned to speculate with a few of the E&P companies
as long as they do not have too much debt and have sufficient current cash flow
to pay their bills. Proven reserves "in the ground" are good too.

Proven reserves are good if they can be bought at a discount. The land assets
are good as long as they own it out right and have not liened it to the banks
to run their current operations.

Picked up a speculative starter position of GMXR based on this thinking. Their
balance sheet shows sufficient cash to maintain their operations. LT debt is
about $5.00/share but not too high based on their proven reserves. Stock
selling at 0.60 BV.

As of December 31, 2009, it had proved reserves of 355.3 billion cubic feet of
natural gas equivalent; and 252 net producing wells in east Texas.

Hi Matt -

Probably the latter which could morph into a Japanese stagflation. I suspect
the Fed will do everything necessary to nip it in the bud and eventually the
U.S. economic engine will roar forward. Inflation is inevitable but that can be
contained too (just debase the $ U.S.).

I guess the shadow foreclosure market is much worse than originally suspected.
Some say that if the big Banks had to mark to the market, they would all be BK.

There should be some good asset plays to buy if the market over reacts (which
it usually does).

I bought a few shares of psec figure the yield is about 12.8% in the tax free
account. Still seem like a generous div. if it can be maintained. Sounds like
they bought that other bdc company on the cheap and the bdc-s could do ok in
this environment since banks dont seem to want to lend. Do you still own it?
Right now I m looking to increase the yield part of my portfolio? any

Re: CenterPoint Energy, Inc (Holdin(NYSE: CNP)
Tortoise Power and Energy Infra(NYSE: TPZ)

My CNP was called away this AM for the dividend. Out of CNP and put the
proceeds into TPZ which yields 7% (pays monthly, dividends automatically
reinvested).

The strategy for CNP was to sell the Nov covered calls strike price $12.50 ( I
got $1.05/share) and see if the stock traded back to their secondary offering
price of $12.90/share. Stock never tested that level. Will be a buyer of CNP at
$12.50/share. For now TPZ provides a higher dividend and keeps me in the same
sector w/ a more diversified group of MLP's and preferred stocks.

Booked the CNP call premium and capital gains (bought 6/2009 @$9.95/share) for
a 64% return (including dividends) in 14 months.

Hi Paul. I hold PAYX in my taxable account and it has been one of my worst

A while back you took a look at UVE. A little higher than your previous look,
but down 33% since March. I'd appreciate your view if you care to look again.
