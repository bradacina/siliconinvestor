Jeff, I make the rounds of computer retailers probably twice a month.
Another tidbit of info: plenty of Iomega ZIP drives available here - all

WHX emerged from bankruptcy in 1991, I think. Right now, the company and union
are fighting over a defined benefit pension plan versus a defined contribution
plan. The company is stating that this could mean the end of WHX/WPSC as an
operating steel company and is adamant that it will not give away the store
again to the union, which it contends pushed it into bankruptcy in the first
place. The cash figure I believe I saw mentioned (several times) was $400M.
With @25 million shares outstanding, the result is $16 / share in cash, which
agrees with "the STREET's" assessment. The company has recently bought a dog
track and a casino, I think. They are also talking about the possible sale of
the steel processing operations. I do not know whether this is just tough talk
for the sake of the union negotiators or real intent.

I found the WHX/WPSC website, http://www.wpsc.com . The 1995 annual report and
the 6/30/96 10Q are available. I will download and/or look around on EDGAR for
more recent filings.

Steel is a lousy business. Competition is tough and margins are thin. If WHX is
serious about selling off its steel business and making other use of its cash,
it could be an interesting situation.

Teri - Thanks for the notes on COHU on Friday. Here is my analysis.
I bought some today and depending upon the earnings report might add
some more.

Comments to all:
This is strictly my analysis and conclusions and should be considered
as such. I've documented sources for verification where appropriate.
I use Ken Fisher's value investing methods but I don't quite have the
guts yet to buy companies that are losing money. I'd rather buy at
slightly higher PSRs and take lower profits in exchange for lower
risk. The 10 points in the summary basically "spell out" the overall
requirements I look for in value stocks except point #7 which is an
editorial comment based upon COHU. There are other good semi
companies out there but I don't want to put all my eggs in AMAT's
basket.

I obviously would have been better off buying at the bottom but my
APCC stock was doing very well and I didn't want to run my portfolio
over 40% in tech stocks. Also, how do you know the bottom and how
fast its going to rise?

Regards
Jeff
********************************************************************
Why I bought COHU
2/1/97

Summary:
1. No debt.
2. Depressed price (40% above 52-week low).
3. Good value (reasonable PSR and PRR)
4. Insiders own 14%, institutions own 27%.
5. The company did an excellent job of handling the latest
downturn. R&D spending increased 40% year over year but
operating income increased 33% and gross margins widened. SG&A
expenses were also lower. They obviously saw it coming. (S&P,
3558J, 12/8/96)
6. They have the largest US market share of "pick and place"
backend processing equipment for the semiconductor manufacturing
industry and are #2 worldwide.
7. One of the "last calls" for high-quality low-priced semi
conductor companies this turn-around.
8. High ROE (35%)
9. High margins (26%)
10. Good past and future growth.

The business: Manufactures test equipment for the final testing
of semiconductors through its subsidiaries (Delta Design and
Daymarc which accounts for 82% of 1995 sales. The remaining 18%
is generated by manufacturing specialized television and imaging
equipment. Daymarc was acquired in 1994. Plants are in several
locations throughout the US. (1995 10K) Equipment that they
manufacture is considered "back end" equipment and is usually
ordered 1 to 1.5 years after primary semiconductor manufacturing
equipment. (10K pg 5) There is currently a high order backlog.
(S&P) Business should grow larger as chips designs grow
smaller. (Follow a Web Search on Cohu, Inc., Gerlach, NAIC
Better Investing BITS, 9/96)

Size of Industry: Significant growth is expected to over $350B by
2000 for semiconductor industry. Over 140 fabs are currently
under construction. In 1995, the industry was $140B. No
estimate could be found for COHU's direct market.

Marketing: Systems are sold worldwide through direct sales force
and independent sales reps. Marketing operations in Europe,
Singapore, Taiwan, and other parts of SE Asia have been
established. (10K) Cohu maintains its customers by offering
ongoing upgrades to existing equipment. (10K pg 5) 40% of COHU
sales are foreign in 1995 up from 37% in 1994. (S&P)

Market share and competition: COHU has 30% of the marketshare of
the worldwide market for "pick and place" chip handlers. Aseco
and Aetrium are the largest domestic competitors and also have
clean balance sheets. (Seasonally Depressed, Rhonda Brammer,
Barrons, 12/28/96).
COHU is the largest US manufacturer of final test equipment for
IC's. (A 40% Off Sale, Rhonda Brammer, Barrons, 12/21/96)
Largest worldwide manufacturer is Advantest of Japan (30%), Cohu
(22% up 9% from 5 years ago), MIRAE of Korea (15%) and around 15
smaller companies. Expect consolidation. (Gerlach) Delta
Design has won several prestigious design awards. (10K) Company
noted difficulty in selling to Japanese companies since Japanese
companies tend to buy their test equipment from other Japanese
companies. (10K - pg 4) Orders to Micron and Motorola accounted
for 34% of sales in 1995 and 32% in 1994. (10K - pg 4) Also sells
to Intel, TI, Siemens and SGS-Thomson (Research Report, Torrey
Pines Securities Research, David Allen,10/27/95)

Expectations: Scott Black (Delphi Mgmt) expects mid-30s in 12-18
months. (Brammer)
ACE growth rate is 22.5% (Zacks)
Currently 2 brokers follow COHU and both recommend STRONG BUY.
(Zacks)
Current Zacks rank is HOLD.
S&P ranks: 4- (1 lowest, 5 highest), high risk, bullish
technically.
Value Line ranks: Performance, Technical, Safety all 4 (below
average) (4081, 1/17/97)

Management: Interesting structure. Pres/CEO (Schwan) and VP
Finance (Allen) are 56 and 44 yrs old respectively. Schwan was
promoted to current position after Pres Barnes retired 3/1/96.
Each of the 5 business units have presidents ranging in age from
40 to 58. All units are profitable. (Sounds similar to DOV and
ECH where this structure works well) Salaries of executives
appear reasonable. CEO is payed approx $250K in salary and
$225K in bonuses. Other executives compensated in similar
proportions. They also have stock options. The board is
comprised of 6 men ranging in age from 56 to 81 years of age.
(Form 14A Proxy Statement 3/7/96)

Research and Development: PRRs (Price/Research) were computed
based upon the average share price for the year.

1993 7.3
1994 11.4
1995 21.3
1996 16.4

Fisher suggests a reasonable PRR range between 5 and 15 for
"Super Companies". The value in 1995 and 1996 were outside of
this range indicating that the company may not be spending enough
money to further product development. However, the company noted
that most R&D money is spent on the primary business which is
semiconductor testing products which accounts for 82% of sales.
If the 82% sales figure is applied against the research dollars,
the 1995 and 1996 PSRs are 19.6 and 13.4 respectively. (10K pg 5)

Valuation: Results using NAIC Stock Selection Guide software for
Windows and Value Line data. Sales have increased fairly
steadily since 1988 at 25% average and earnings have grown at
31%. 5-year ACE projections are 22.5% for earnings. (Zacks)
From a price of $24.50 and a yield of 0.8%, the total projected
long-term return is 26.7%. Current P/E=8.1, 5-year historical
high P/E=11.2 and low=5.5. There is room for P/E expansion.

Current PSR (Price/Sales) = 1.2. Historic high PSRs are in the
1.8-1.9 range in 1995 and 1996. Low PSRs in 1995 and 1996 are
0.55 and 0.79 respectively. PSR is currently above that
recommended by Fisher for a "Super Company" but it is not an
unreasonably high value.

Industry Comparison: Compared with 27 other semiconductor and cap
equipment manufacturers in the $100M to $500M range:

Measure COHU Industry

PSR 1.2 3.0
Sales 179M 202M
Pretax Margin 26.1 13.3
D/E 0 40.7 (note: 12 other companies have no
debt)
ROE 35.5 20.5
P/E 8.1 16.6
LT Growth 22.5 21.6
% abv 52 wk low 40 68
Inst ownership 27 42
Inside ownership 14 23

(Note: COHU is not classified by SIC with other semiconductor cap
equipment manufacturers)

Industry comparison:
1. COHU management is better than industry average based upon
debt and ROE.
2. It appears that it can control its own destiny relative to
competition (Margin).
3. Stock is still undervalued based upon PSR, P/E and % abv 52 wk
low. The stock is probably still low because it sells back end
equipment rather than chips or front end equipment as other
companies in the comparison group.
4. Institutional ownership is still low. Buying by institutions
should be expected.

Miscellaneous issues:
1. No data was found on insider trading.
2. The conventional "Super Company" wisdom is to sell off
divisions that do not fit into the core business. For Cohu,
these include a number of divisions that deal with measurement
and television gear where there appears to be little synergy.
These divisions accounted for 18% of 1995 sales. But at least it
appears that these divisions provided some cushion to earnings
when the semiconductor cycle turned downward so maybe it's not a
bad afterall. But selling these divisions would provide good
funds to purchase other companies to build the core business.

Interesting investment style which is much like my own. I'm currently
heavy into semi equips which I picked up June-Dec last year and have been
actively searching for laggards in the group to purchase as I sell some that
have moved. I'm considering COHU but will wait until
Monday after earning release. I have a couple others I'm looking into
that I'd appeciate your comments on. First aseco, which is much smaller company
that competes with cohu. They have little debt, ample cash,
and trade at only a few dollars over book. Management seems solid
as they have kept the company profitable despite recent downturn without
cutting R&D. My second pick is SMTL which has run up a bit
lately but still seems cheap based on PSR and industry. Good luck.

Gottfried,

Being from San Jose and now living in Nashville, I can tell you that
Silicon Valley is an awfully unique computer retailing market. There
is not only Fry's and CompUSA but hundreds of tiny outfits that
advertise in local rags like MicroTimes. CompUSA may be too full-service
retail-oriented to thrive in such an environment. Here,
CompUSA is doing awfully well. No Fry's. No tiny outfits (the
few that do exist charge ridiculous prices). I usually shop mail order but
CompUSA sure appeals to most people out here. Packed on
weekends and bustling on weeknights. CompUSA is the best deal in
town.

Michael, thank you for broadening my horizons! Another reason Fry's
is so popular may be that they sell electronic parts as well. This
would appeal to the thousands of computer professionals and tinkerers
here. On top of that they have a video and audio section - which
CompUSA lacks. BTW, Fry's neither advertises in MicroTimes nor distri-
butes the magazine these days. They must have had a falling-out. You
now have to get MicroTimes from boxes across the street (Sunnyvale).

Does anyone know of a good place on the WWW to get current
net asset values for closed end funds, preferably for free?

I am currently evaluating Morgan Stanley Asian Pacific Fund (APF)and the Chile
Fund (CH), having received tip-offs from The Value Advisor
Newsletter on these.

Following is an excerpt re: APF.

Morgan Stanley Asia-Pacific Fund

Ticker APF Exch NY Price 9.625 Net Assets 11.6 Discount -17% 52 week range 9.5
- 14.5 Yield 5.4%

"This Asia-Pacific fund is a closed-end investment company investing in Asian
securities markets. We feel that APF is one of the better vehicles in which to
invest in Asia/Pacific and that this region appears to be as good of an
investment value as it has been for years. The markets in Japan, South Korea,
Thailand and India have all suffered major losses this year to contribute to
the region's 2.2% drop through three quarters. APF, whose net assets actually
grew slightly during this period, takes a value approach by selling equities
that have run up significantly and increasing their weightings in stocks that
offer the greatest value in the long term. At the end of the third quarter, the
fund's investment weighting was Japan-39.8%, India-12.8%, Hong Kong-11.9%,
Australia-6.9%, Thailand-6.3%, Singapore-5.9%, Korea-3.4%, Malaysia-2.9%,
Indonesia-2.7%, Philippines-2.6% and the others 4.8%. At a time when most
closed-end funds in the beaten-down markets such as Korea and Japan are trading
at a premium, this fund's 17% discount is a welcome sight. In addition, its
dividend and low price are compelling reasons to use APF to invest in a region
that undoubtedly will have substantial long term rewards. "

Thinking of an investment here. It appears that we have a deep
discount on a bag of depressed stocks in a region that absolutely
must grow, no? I'd appreciate comments as I am just learning
about closed end funds.

Joby - In tech stocks, I always try to buy the market-share leader unless there
is a case like Cohu that is a top competitor and is rapidly gaining market
share against its primary competitor. Aseco is a great company but they are
competing against Cohu. I haven't done all the research on Aseco so perhaps
they have other products. However, this market is consolidating and based upon
Cohu's past, they **may** acquire more companies go gain market share.

I don't know about SMTL so I can't comment at this point.

months that might interest you. IMO, this is how I would sum it up:

1. Asia sans Japan should be good.
2. Japan's troubles are just beginning. Banks in crisis, social crises' (teen
prostitution, domestic violence on the rise), big infrastructure problems
(roads, buildings, etc.).
3. Nikkei shows no signs of a bottom yet.

There has been an article almost every week now including one in the current

Re: FRDM

You are 100% correct. A big reason for their price weakness is
they expanded too fast, hiring less-than-qualified store managers
with little credit experience. Secondary reasons are some poor
same-store comparisons and a slowing of growth in # of stores from
30-40% to 20-30%. Still, the market may have discounted this,
now at 14 from a high of 29 3/4 despite being more profitable, and
a PE of 11 despite no debt and fairly sure 20% growth. Just an
Idea. I am actually trying to get in at 14 today. Management
has indicated that they are rectifying their hiring mistakes and
are reconfiguring for solid long-term growth unhindered by the
credit problems that have plagued them the last year.

Jeff, Aseco is a direct competitor of cohu and has no other product
lines. In your reply you seem to discount aseco since they are not
the market leaders and I can't deny that selecting only market leaders
is a way to avoid some risks. I actually prefer smaller companies since they
may have better growth potential as long as they have
competitive products, solid management and a clean balance sheet. My research
on Aseco indicates it has all of these. The icing on the cake is that this
combination along with it's relatively low stock price and the trend toward
consolidation may make it an ideal takeover candidate (just my opinion). I now
own a few shares of aseco
and will likely be purchasing some more soon along with Cohu. Good
luck.

Joby - I agree with most of what you say about Aseco. The reason I get pretty
anal about market share leaders is because they usually control prices at will.
Usually because of economies of scale, margins are better for market share
leaders and if they feel like it, they lower prices at will to gain market
share. Their competitors cannot do so.

Atrium has a 15% margin and I couldn't find one on Asceo. Cohu's margin is 26%.
Suppose Cohu wants more market share. It lowers its margins by 15% and still
makes money leaving Atrium (and Aseco?) at break-even! Even if a competitor has
near equal margins and is able to lower margins to compete with the gorilla, it
may force them to alter their business plan which usually has a negative affect
on prices. I don't see the little guys making big market gains by lowering
margins very often because they are trying to increase margins to fund R&D and
grow the company.

Aseco definitely has good numbers and lots of cash and is a good potential
buy-out candidate in a consolidating market.

Has everyone visited The Value Advisor Newsletter site?

I've been pouring through their picks and one that intrigues me
is Numerex (NMRX, 4 1/2 with $3.11 cash and no debt). Their
analysis follows:

"Numerex designs, manufactures, and markets its proprietary Derived Channel
Systems to perform alarm reporting & other monitoring functions over telephone
lines. At first blush, Numerex looks like anything but a good value after the
year they've had. They took $0.61 per share in charges for restructuring,
obsolete inventory and a litigation settlement (wiping out their $0.10 per
share in operational earnings). Also, their annual sales were down nearly 14%
and they discontinued their $0.20/year dividend. Our position, however, is that
Numerex now has only one direction to go - up. After trading at a price of 18
less than two years ago, Numerex's slide is overdone in light of the fact they
should make money this year and they have over $3/share in cash with no debt on
their balance sheet. With this financial strength, it is worth betting that
Numerex will turnaround. 1997 results should be helped by the recent contract
with Canada Bell (with their business concentrated in the United Kingdom,
Numerex is looking to expand to other regions). Numerex themselves feel their
price is a bargain, authorizing the buyback of up to one million of their 11.6
mm outstanding shares (they've repurchased 220,000 through September 9). The
Value Fund took a position in Numerex at a price of 3.875 after following
Numerex for a year. "
*********
One brokerage rates this a "speculative buy." No kidding. But with
4.27 book, an operating profit, fistfuls of cash sans debt, I'm
thinking I'm willing to pay $1.39/sh for this business. Current
ratio is 6 thanks to all that cash. That the company is buying
makes me like the scenario all the better. It's a micro-cap at
50M and I discovered the contract with Canada Bell is really only
a trial, so I'm open to input. Any comments?

Some other picks I'm following:

Anchor Gaming (SLOT, 36 1/4) down off its high of 71 despite 50%
profit growth relative to a PE of 16.7. With 70M cash and no debt.
Current Ratio of 5.96. Story here is a busted growth stock (currently at its
lowest PE ever) that hired Merrill Lynch as an advisor to seek ways of
increasing shareholder value back on Dec 5. This news sent the stock from 41 to
46 that day, but it has settled back down since then.
Resistance is approaching rapidly in the form of a down trendline, but
if it clears that, why not buy? Growth still estimated at 23%, and
we still don't know what they're cooking up in terms of "increasing
shareholder value."

NCI Building Systems (BLDG, 37 1/4) has sales of $41 which are increasing in
the parabolic manner we all love. P/B up there
at 2.74, but has CurrentR of 2.13, .03 D/E, PE 12, and estimated
growth at 17% long term. A strong story. Barron's Dossiers
is a good way to get to know this one. Approaching all time highs
set in April 96, so may want to wait and see how it handles this
overhead resistance first.

During the second half of 1995 and first half of 1996, Burke Mills
(NASDAQ:BMLS) implemented a major strategic investment. This
effort temporarily reduced the Company's profitability, which led to a
decline in the price of its stock. This investment is now largely complete
and is showing results in terms of (a) lowering the Company's
production costs and (b) raising its manufacturing capacity. As a result,
the Company is more competitive and has the manufacturing capacity to
met the resulting increased demand for its products.

BMLS generated a strong increase in revenues in 1996, capped by a 39%
revenue increase in the most recent quarter. With the final stages of
the strategic investment completed, the third quarter produced a
328% increase in gross profits, and earnings per share of $0.11, versus
a prior year loss.

BMLS appears to be undervalued at its current market value of $3.00 per
share and appears to have a "theoretical value" in excess of $6.00 per

I think it looks great. This company is in the alarm business and long term I
think this is a growth business. The company is just starting to expand their
technology to other contries, and there is also insider buying and no selling
at these levels. Also it seems as though they have bank financing. Looks like a
real low-risk value. Thanks for bringing it too my attention. One last thought
the comapny believed its revenues declined because of the economic slowdown in
England. That's not going to last forever either.

Montgomery analyst sees buying opportunity in gaming stocks ...

SAN FRANCISCO (DBC) -- After being labeled as a business gettting too far ahead
of itself, gaming stocks may be poised for new investment opportunities. So
says Montgomery Securities gaming analyst Dave McDonald, who argues that stock
in gaming companies has become a bargain now that so many investors have
shied away from the industry. "Investors who focus on well-capitalized, proven
operators with substantial growth prospects will fare well," said McDonald.

The only ones I know of are Aseco, Atrium, and the Japanese firm. I did a lot
of scouring here and these are the only ones ever reported as competitors. So I
don't think any of the big boys are a threat here.

This is true. I own AMAT too. But my understanding is that COHU's products are
unique and well protected with patents. The optical inspection stuff AMAT
bought is not what COHU sells so they are not competing. I also tried to
determine if COHU's technology was at risk to some new technology that would
replace it (like buggy whips) and I couldn't find anything.

I'm an NAIC member and I use their analysis to judge growth rates, etc. where
possible after I've qualified stocks by Fisher's methods. The problem with the
NAIC SSG method is that it uses PE which is often not a good measure for
companies with volitile earnings like tech stocks. So you get garbage out of an
SSG if you have a company with somewhat cyclical earnings. PSR works better
here. Also, SSG will indicate a great stock with a tremendously high PSR which
is a problem.

DSWLF was in IBD New America section today 2/7. If it doesn't break out today,
it will proably trade in 17-1/2 to 21 range until next Friday when the 20 days
above 12 occurs and they can call the warrants.

ACAR is another extremely cheap stock that carries a lot of risk with huge
potential. Earnings grew from .12 in '95 to .65 in '96 and could come in at .65
or higher this year. 1st quarter was .15 in'96 vs. .19 in '97. Stock is trading
at 2-1/2. The major risk is heavy losses on risky car loans. This is already
built into the price, so while there is some risk, a normal loss rate would
value this stock closer to 6. It is trading near book value now and pulled back
sharply due to MFN and OLM. If the books are cooked like MFN, then it won't be
around in a year. If not, lots of upside potential. I only bought 1/3 of a
position the other day when it had a blowoff low down to 2. I have called the

Winston - Good stuff here!

You Wrote:
If a "Super Stock" has the highest profit margin and the lowest PSR, then
it would mean it would have the lowest P/E as well.

Company A: $100mm in sales, 20% margin, $20mm earnings, $200 mm
capitalization for a PSR of 2 and a P/E of 10.

Company B: $100mm in sales, 10% margin, $10mm earnings, an
equivalent PSR of 2 would put it at the same capitalization, but
with a P/E of 20.

Using the analysis in your response, would we not come up with
one of the following conclusions?

1. The two companies are equivalently valued because they have
identical PSR's, or

2. The P/E ratio (which reflects the margin) better reflects value.

If Company B were priced at a P/E of 10, that would lead to a market
capitalization of $100 million, and a PSR of 1. Under PSR it would be
more undervalued, but P/E rates the two identically.

My answer:
Also note both cost $200/share.

This is classic PSR analysis! Fisher's method uses PSR as the final
deciding factor - you've got to have a Super Company first which is
decided by things like market share, management quality, past and future
growth rates, etc. Some of this will be reflected in the numbers. All
other things being equal (debt, ROE, market share, industry, earnings
stability, growth rates) I would choose the high margin stock as the
better value and ignore PE. But this is a theoretical case which I doubt
exists in the real world and doesn't illustrate the power of PSR analysis.

Here are some real data which is never as pretty as the theoretical but
it illustrates my points. I looked at companies >$1B sales who's business
is in a single industry that were within 20% of their 52-wk highs. Bear in
mind that I haven't qualified any of these companies as Super Companies so
we are strictly looking at the numbers. Historical growth rates have also
been ignored.

A B ROE D/E C D PSR E

STK 83.47 15.0 15.9 12.8 11.1 2,040 1.47 16.39
EMC 94.35 23.1 29.5 21.6 22.7 2,274 3.84 23.97

WDC 95.64 18.2 32.5 0.0 4.8 2,865 0.95 22.66
QNTM 97.30 18.4 14.1 109.8 -3.8 4,423 0.44 27.14
SEG 100.00 22.1 21.9 32.4 5.5 8,588 1.32 21.15

DELL 94.38 23.3 43.9 11.7 8.4 5,296 1.83 31.12
CPQ 100.00 18.5 24.2 4.9 10.4 18,109 1.33 18.38

A=% abv 52-wk low
B=EPS growth
C=Pretax margin - most recent quarter
D=annual sales
E=trailing PE

STK and EMC are direct competitors in the high-end storage market. Here's
the case of high margin with high PE and PSR. Note sales are similar
and EMC's growth rate is higher. Huge PSR difference. EMC is good stuff.
One of my customers has several big Symmetrix boxes and they are fun to
play with. But its a WSD (Wall Street Darling). IMO EMC is overvalued and
STK marginal based upon PSR. What happens if EMC has a glitch?

WDC, QNTM, SEG are in the disk drive market. All have similar growth rates
and PEs are close (24 +/-3). Two points here: 1) WDC and SEG have similar
margins and different but relatively close PSRs. If you believe Fisher's
data, you'd expect SEG to have a lower PSR because its a much bigger company.
So its not a value play. How long will SEG go up? How high is too high?
What's the exit strategy?

Point 2) QNTM vs. SEG and WDC. This is the primary use of Fisher's Super
Stock analysis. WDC has negative margins but nice sales. PE is high.
It could be 100+ or even infinite if they continued to sell at negative
margins. But PSR is the lowest of the three suggesting its a possible
value play. The point being that once it returns to profitability the
PSR and margins are likely to trend to the industry average. Quantum
(the glitcher)has the lowest PSR which is half of WDC and a quarter of
SEG! So QNTM is a **candidate** for a value play.

DELL and CPQ in the microcomputer market... PSR trend is correct - larger
company has smaller PSR. And supports your theoretical case of higher margin
with lower PE. But huge PE difference. Due to growth rate? IMO it
indicates overvaluation of DELL - another WSD.

Again, you can slice and dice these numbers in a bunch of different ways
to make most any argument you want about a stock - which is why there is no
single method of stock picking. But I'm too chicken to buy high PSR stuff
because there is a lot of historical evidence that indicates after a broad
market correction, the high PSR stuff never comes back but the low PSR
stuff comes back and goes on to new heights. And I can get close to the
returns of other more risky stock picking methods. My point here is that
why should I take the risk when I can make just as good or better returns
without the risk? I like to make my initial buys at PSR < 1.3 but will
buy higher on a strong short-term move upwards but exit shortly thereafter.
Thats as much gambling as I can tolerate.

A market wipeout is inevitable. For the risk averse, one can either sit
on the sidelines while the markets go up and up and up, or buy value stocks.
I choose the latter because there is more long term risk by not being in the
market (IMHO).

You wrote:
BTW, do you know offhand what the PSR's for AMAT, COHU, MSFT, and
INTC were before they made their lowest moves? I can tell that AMAT's was
probably around 170mm x 23/4500 or about 0.88. What of the others?

My Answer:
I don't know off the top of my head how low they were. If I'm serious
about buying a company, I do a full analysis of the PSR history. Here's
roughly what the PSRs are now:

AMAT 1.6
COHU 1.2
INTC 7+
MSFT 13+

There are number of different margins to look at. Most people look at pretax
margin which is pretax profit / sales.

If you are in this for the long haul, you will greatly improve you ability to
pick companies on your own if you know the terms and can interpret Balance

Hi Pete,

I have recently been considering Bethlehem Steel as a long-term turn-around
play. The company is in the midst of a major restructuring and is selling of
some of its business units, including the rumored sale of their Sparrow's Point
Shipyard to WHW.

Now, WHX appears to be a better value. I too read that they have $400 million
in cash/equivalents to weather out the storm, but the talks do not appear to
being going well at all. First call had their 96 at (.56) with a considerable
loss in the 4th Q. I am sure these earnings have already been released, but I
am not sure exactly what they posted.

If the rumors are correct and they are considering the purchase of Beth Steels
Shipyard, I don't see them attempting an exit from the steel industry, in which
it was doing pretty well over the past few years, with consistent earnings
growth.

If the union talks work out decently at least, I see this stock as an excellent
long-term turn-around candidate.

Book Value: 30.52
Price to Book: .28
Cash/Share: 15.92

The trick is just to find the bottom, as the stock appears to still be sliding.
Are you already a shareholder or still considering? I am definitely gonna do a
little more research on WHX.

I took an entry position in WHX. There was some question in this thread about
the accuracy of the $400M in cash. I have the 1995 Annual Report and the
9/30/96 10Q on my desk and the $400M is correct! Most (@90%) of it is in U.S.
Treasury Bills! We are talking about $15-16 a share in cash! That's Value! Many
of the stocks mentioned in this post are not true value plays, they are merely
cheap. There's a difference.

What we have here is a situation where you can buy a dollar bill for about 50

Jeff and All,
I think I have stumbled on a Jewel of company...but let me put down some facts
and figures and we'll see. I know you told me that you are already semi-heavy,
so this may hold you back. But, I have to share this information. The company
is Fusion Systems (FUSN). They are coming up with a PE of 3.0. Yes, your eyes
are Okay. There is a reason for this though, they recently sold a UV lighting
divison for mucho bucks. The stock price is ABOUT 27.
PE = 3
PSR = 2.0 (approx.)
I came upon a Salomon Brothers report by accident, and it has some extremely
interesting observations. The report is dtd 7 Jan 97 and they have rated FUSN
"Strong Buy"; Stock Price at the time was 22-3/4. Here are some clips from the
report.
--"We are becoming more bullish on Fusion despite disappointing third-quarter
results, due to a vastly improved outlook for 1997. Three new products have now
rolled out, and acceptance of these has been excellent."
--"We raised our 1997 earnings estimate to $1.15 per share from $.60. Our
preliminary 1998 estimate is $1.50 per share."
"Company Overview. With the September 6 sale of its UV Curing operations to the
Fairey Group, Fusion Systems became a pure play in the semiconductor equipment
sector. The company is a leading supplier of ashers (systems which remove
residues resulting from the etching process) and photostabilizers (systems
which apply high-intensity ultraviolet (UV) energy to photoresist in order to
lock the photoresist into place) to many of the world's largest semiconductor
manufacturers including IBM, Intel, Samsung, SGS Thompson and Texas
Instruments. We think it is noteworthy that these customers are broad-based
from a geographical and product perspective."
One more snippet...."In addition, we think the risk/reward profile is
attractive since Fusion currently enjoys over $14 in cash per share and almost
$19 in book value per share. We reiterate our Strong Buy recommendation on the
shares."
If anyone wants to hear more, I will e-mail them with more details. All I have
on this research report is a hard copy.

Teri

Video Update (VUPDA, VUPDZ, $4.25)

Video store chain with high top line growth (mainly via acquisitions)
muted by share offerings, most recent 6.1 M at $4 on 9/27/96.
Sells at discount to $5.9 Sales, $4.9 Book; has little to no debt
and about $.75 in cash. Same store growth of 7%. Strong technical
support at about $3.75. Weekly MACD is strongly positive.

Right after its 6M share offering in September (which depressed
the share price 21%), several brokers, including Piper Jaffray,
came out with favorable recommendations. It now has 18M shs
out and on 12/17 boosted its authorized shares to 60M from 50M.
I worry that this company will keep moving back to the public
offering well to finance its growth. Certainly it doesn't show
any sign of altering the course that has driven its share price
down from $13. IBD gives it an earnings rating of 36, a strenght
rating of 12, and a A/D rating of C. PE remains up there at
27, though based on 97 est it will be 16 -- still a premium
to its industry. Management holds only %12. I wonder where
they cashed out? Of course they may just have diluted down their
own holdings.

There is also the issue of the Class B warrrants (VUPDZ) selling
at 1 3/16 with 1.15M outstanding. I am no expert on warrants and
would appreciate some insight here.

I find better buys out there; though on a P/B or PSR basis this
company is cheap I worry about the impact of many more shares and
management's low % holdings. I am now holding REF, NMRX, OTEXF, APF, and PRNI.
Waiting on DAYR for a slightly better price.

1.86 0.89 PSR on annual sales
3.61 0.79 PSR on quarterly sales FOR YOUR BENEFIT CARY! <G>

It looks like we missed the bottom on FUSN. They bottomed out at 17
in October and price on 2/3 was 29. Sounds like they are the leader
in their niche.

Centigram's numbers (CGRM) are interesting. No debt, lots of cash,
low PSR, high insider ownership (almost too high), and its butt is
firmly planted on the ground. Cash and no debt is nice. At least
they can't go bankrupt for awhile at least. I also noted they
recently got a new CFO. Margins stink but hopefully they will
increase.

I do have some experience with voice technology. I've done a lot with
voice recog/voice synthesis over the past 10 years from the real
cheapies to the big $40K Tucker-Davis systems. I currently maintain
the FAA's control tower training sims in OK City which is a fully
automated voice recog/synthesis system. Voice recog is going to be
hot soon. It takes a heck of a lot of power to do voice recog which
is why the good systems are so expensive. They use DSPs (Digital
Signal Processors) which are specialized CPUs (not quite but similar)
to analyze voice input and match it with its defined vocabulary. It
would take the power of many Pentium Pros (which is a general purpose
processor) to run these algorithms with any kind of speed
which is why you don't have voice recogition on your PC yet. And for
continuous speech recognition? Maybe 50-100x Pentium Pros to do this.
I'm not an expert in this area but these should be pretty reasonable
figures.

I'd like to find out more about what Centigram has. I haven't worked
with their stuff. But here are a couple of potential problems. Did
you hear TI's announcement in the past few days about their new
multimedia DSP? Its supposed to targeted for the consumer market and
one of its uses **may** be voice recog. If this is the case,
centigram **might** be making great buggy whips. There are a number
of voice recog algorithms that use common mathimatical functions which
are usually implemented on DSP chips in some flavor. So eventually
any patented stuff that does voice recog faster will become worthless
as processor speeds increase, particularly if its implemented on a
DSP. A current DSP **may** be able to process these algorithms 100-500
times faster than the fastest current Intel chip could. (Speeds double
about every 2 1/2 to 3 years) The TI DSP is something that **could**
show up on a vanilla sound board in a local computer store for $149 in
the not to distant future. The last part here is strictly speculation
because I haven't seen the technical specs on the new chip yet. But
if you have anymore info on this co, I'll take a look at it.

Jeff

I do more a handicapping style of looking at a stock than just sticking to the

Michael,

If you go to Barron's Dossiers and check out the news section for WHX, the last
article, dated October 2, 1996, confirms this information. Most of their cash
is in short-term investments and does not show up under cash and equivalents
under some of their balance sheets, but should be there under investments or
something. You can also go to their web page and read their 10-K's and Q's,
which show that they have been quite aware that this might happen for quite
some time and have been quite prepared to deal with it.

Actually, I found confirmation of 400M in cash and cash equivalents

ratio is .3. How much debt do they have and what quality/type is
it? I notice one can buy their senior 9.75% 2003 notes.

Is their debt so large or troublesome that it knocks some dollars
off WHX's share value? Also, it looks like the strike negotiations are
worsening. No matter-- if it turns out I can buy a dollar for even
90 cents I'm in.

I'll keep looking.

I got my management holdings number from IBD and did no further
research in this area. If you did any research at all you are
probably correct.

Weekly MACD is a technical indicator; The weekly MACD is sometimes
used to pin down that most slippery yet most vital information --
the "long-term" trend. It turned up after a few weeks at 4.25 and
has been rising strongly since then.

PSR is Price to Sales Ratio. A book released in 1996 studied
what works on Wall Street and found that the PSR is one of
the best predictors of future stock appreciation - the lower
the PSR the better. Jeff Maresh on this thread has posted
extensively on it. As with all indicators it is a useful number,
and may be incorporated into your screening process. I like
to look for PSRs < 1 but that is not absolute because I don't
want to miss some high-growth areas. Use PSR's in conjunction
with growth rates and profit margins for more effective screening.

I talked to a friend who knows a lot about public offerings. He
said PO's are a shady business and the underwriter may be
manipulating the company more than we know if the company
keeps going back to the PO well despite a detrimental effect on
share price. The underwriters are the only ones guaranteed
to come out winners with a public offering. I don't understand
this too well myself and am staying away from VUPDA for this reason.

VUPDA Warrants

The warrants are a lot like option calls, giving the holder the right to
purchase stock at a givin price when certain conditions are met.
Might be at date, or the stock trading over a givin price of so many days. With
the price of a 3/16 I'd bet the conversion price is $3.00-3.25. Reguardless
somewere down the road there will be another 1.15mil shares outstanding when
the warrants are converted. What normaly happens when the conversion takes
place is the stock will move lower to reflect the additional shares on the
market and reduced EPS because of it. Looking at the quote for the Warrants
they are good until 7/99. If there is no other trigers for the conversion they
would be a good way to leverage your buying power. The price of the warrants
will move more or less dollar for dollar with the stock at this level. Hope
this is of help

Hi Cary - The figure of $9.38 cash/share is from Zacks RM database as of 2/3.
I'm not sure where they get their data but I have run into errors before. Also,
"Other Assets" could include inventory if its not broken out separately, or
even marketable securities. Zacks number may lump in anything thats liquid but
definitely not inventory.

I will do some more research on CGRM products. I'm not sure what the "claim to
fame" of TruVoice is but I do know that a lot of money has been spent to
develop algorithms to get human-sounding speech. One of the big problems with
most products when it comes to text-to-speech software is that inflections on
words don't come out quite right. If their product solves this problem, then it
is probably patentworthy and would be very difficult for competitors to
reproduce. This would definitely be worth something.

TI's DSP would affect them negatively if their product was for voice
recognition. It doesn't sound like it is. The interesting thing about software
is that as machines become faster, the more practical it becomes to run
mathimatically complex algorthms. The performance improvements render some
fancy proprietary algorithms obsolete if the primary benefit of the latter was
to solve the problem on a slower machine. We need to make sure that TruVoice is
something more than this. I will post again when I've had a chance to do some
more research on it. If you have any sources (other than Edgar, home page,
etc., please pass them along) Otherwise, the new DSP would probably help their
product because the price would probably be reduced and would be more
affordable.

Here guys, I just posted this on Microcap Value Stocks thread I started,
thought maybe you would like a look. This one should do pretty well...

ATS Medical (ATSI) -- rising star?

First of all, I want to point out that I have no financial interest in this
company. I have no money in the market, but I am researching the financial
markets for my economics graduate work.

ATS Medical is going to be one of my case studies. They have an open pivot
mechanical heart valve that is gaining worldwide acclaim by doctors. Today
their Japanese partner bought 1.5mil shares of the company for $9.40. The stock
currently trades at $8.375. That's a fair difference between the two prices. My
prediction is that the price gains momentum here (it already had some) and
crashes through the
double-digit barrier, ending up at new highs in the $12-$15 range in the next 6
months.

Throw in the wildcard, ATSIW (ATS warrants) and you have an exciting story.
ATSIW may be worth either $.10 or $2.00 in the fairly short-term future, if
ATSI moves significantly upward or downward. It will be an interesting story to
watch!

This stock hasn't exactly been "beaten down," its p/e has merely slipped from
around 500 to the 100-150 range (but that is actually probably quite low for a
stock with such potential). I thought it was worth a look anyway.

There is a thread on SI if you would like to contribute:

WHX, in 10Q, reported buyback of 3.9M shares for an aggregate price of $40.9
Million, including @1Million purchased in 3rd Quarter 1996 for approximately
$9.9Million. Company is also retiring preferreds (39K shares of A, 75K shares
of B). Board also authorized repurchase of another 10% of common and up to 10%
of A & B preferred.

I take the fact that they bought back shares @ $10 as a strong positive; they
are putting a floor under the stock, and a purchase at current levels (closed
at $8 1/2 on 2/10/97) would appear to be a low risk opportunity. Upside
movement in the share price appears limited until the strike is resolved, but I
think in a year, February 1997 will look like a great time to have bought WHX.

Answer to my own question re: WHX

From its 10Q of Sep 96 WHX has $276M in long term debt. While this
is manageable given its assets, it does detract from the valuation
of the stock. With 130M in free cash (several million) and
short term investments (the remainder) over and above debt the company appears
to be valued on this basis (130/26M shs = $5/sh plus the business at $3.5/sh).
This is all rough and not necessarily
cogent, but it just indicates that one isn't getting $16 cash for
$8.5. Now, is the business worth $3-4/sh? Management seems
to think so. If the company directly pays $3000/worker X 6000 worker
in order to end strike (as it proposed)that's an extra $18M that is
no more.

WHX

Dug up a little info on the convertable preferred isuses. From what I can tell
here is the story

Class A - The holder may convert any time into 3.1686 shares of common
Company may buy out any time at $52.275 share, Yeild 8.4%

Class B - converts to 2.451 shares, buyout is $52.625, yeild 9.5%

The company has been buying back class A and from what I read will be
continuing to do so. In the year 2003 for Class A, & 2004 for Class b the
buyout prices drop to around $50.00.

From:Jeff Maresh

Teri, Cary - Here are some points I pulled from the 10K and 14A
and from Teri's web research on CGRM.

Market Share: Not sure where they stand at this point but
definitely not #1 or #2. Teri pulled some email from Motley Fool
that indicated they were #7 with 3.8% of the market. A lot can
change in 4 years. Also data she pulled from Hoovers indicates
some formidable competitors like IBM, Norther Tel, Lucent,
Siemens, and Unisys. It also looks like the some of the telecom
competitors sell a voice messaging system as part of an entire
package. I think this would give them a lot of pricing
flexibility against somebody like CGRM that sells it as a stand
alone product. Exports have been going up over the years: 16%
in 94, 23% in 95, 30% in 96. The entire market is estimated at
$1.2B which seems like too small a market for the big guys to be
in.

Financial stuff: margins are very low - 1% according to Zacks RM.
IF these go up, it means big gains in earnings. Inventories
nearly doubled from $6M in 95 to $11M in 96. Cash and ST
investments decreased from $55M in 95 to $42M in 96. They also
had a tax rate of 5% in 96 because of loss carry forward. Their
top 5 customers accounted for 48% revenues in 94, 42% in 95, and
35% in 96. At least its going in the right direction. Also
I'm not sure where we are getting these high cash/share figures.
I'm looking at the Barrons dossier and its reporting $12.7M cash
on 6.9M shares, or $1.85cash/share.

Products: They spent 16% in 94, 21% in 95 and 19% in 96 and they
said they will continue to spend more. These numbers are already
high before you spend more. Also, they blew a wad of cash
developing a new system that started shipping 1Q96. Why isn't it
producing a good revenue stream? They claim upgradability as a
key feature on their system relative to the competition but
customers have to buy the entire new system to get the new
features. Tru-Voice is software that runs on their products and
they license it to other companies but I couldn't find a
breakdown on revenue. This is a patented product but it doesn't
appear to be a big revenue generator. They also licensed it to
MSFT. There is no other real silver bullet I could find that
makes their product great relative to the competiton.

Insider ownership: The numbers seem to contradict data from Zacks
which claims insider ownership of 62%. Numbers from SEC docs
indicate Kopp Investment Advisors owns 17%, pres has 3%, board
has 6% and there are a lot options to the board that expire by
3/1/97.

Management: Pres has been there since 85 and makes $250K and
$30K-$90K in bonuses. Pretty reasonable. New VP&GM of Service
Provider div in 1/96. Looks like #2 man in organization. New
CFO 12/96. Obviously they are looking for answers and heads
rolled. Pres is an Engineer. If engineers can pick up
marketing, they do well. If not, they continue heavy spending a
lot of cash on R&D but never generate good profits. Looks like
that might be the case here. Also, management really doesn't own
a lot of stock. Are they really going to be motivated to build a
successful company when they continue to get nice salaries and
bonuses in spite of poor performance? Pres still got a nice
bonus when they lost money in 95. I think he should have gotten
no bonus and taken a 10% salary cut which is similar to what
companies like AMAT do in similar situations. The problem here
might not be the #2 & #3 guys in the company.

Other stuff: They are in the final stages of buying Voice-Tel by
issuing more stock and assuming $11M in debt. I don't know what
this company does and how it is going to help CGRM. They didn't
discuss this in the 10K but only noted the deal.

Conclusions: I can't evaluate the product because I don't know
the competitors. My guess is that they are getting killed by
pricing pressure from the big players who might throw in a voice
messaging system real inexpensively just to get the hardware
business. The systems CGRM make are much more capable. You can
network systems between different cities worldwide, send fax,
email, messages, etc. all on the same system. I don't know what
can be done with competing systems. Also, it looks like these
guys did well when the Voice Messaging boom started and have
fizzled since. Cary - what's your insight here? What am I
missing. When it comes to buying stocks, I like to know about
the worst scenario but hope for the best.

From:Bob Davis

The Napeague Letter identifies undervalued small-cap companies which are
investment opportunities. The February 9th edition included the following
updates on stocks that I am following:

ABATIX ENVIRONMENTAL - ABIX:
About a week ago I talked with Frank Cinatl, the CFO at Abatix. Of
course I asked whether there were any "events" which would cause
the recent decline in its price, and he confirmed that the Company
was generally on track, and that there were no internal forces
driving this price movement. He indicated that revenues for fiscal
1996 were in line with the Company's previous projections of an
approximately 20% increase for the year. The Company is aiming
toward releasing their 1996 financial results around March 4th. As
soon as I have this information I will e-mail it out to you, and I will
update my Analysis of ABIX and publish it in The Napeague Letter.

Although the price of ABIX has gradually dropped to below $3.00,
it has done so on relatively low volume, which indicates to me that
this decline is driven by a lack of demand, and not by "impending
adverse news" For the last several days, momentum-based
indicators have been signaling potential upward price movement.

CANDELA CORPORATION - CLZR:
On January 27th, Candela announced a 60% increase in net income
on a 19% gain in revenue during the second quarter of fiscal 1997.
These results exceeded my quarterly projections, upon which I based
the fiscal year projection for 1997 which were published in The
Napeague Letter on January xx ; Revenues were $9.4 million versus
my projection of $9.1 million; net income was $736,000 or $.13 per
share versus my estimate of $541,000 and $.10 per share.

I have not yet received a copy of the Company's 10-Q Report, but I
will update this Analysis after I read it and e-mail it to all Napeague
Letter subscribers.

On Friday, the Company issued a press release announcing the
opening of the worlds first combined spa, salon and cosmetic laser
center on February 11th in Scottsdale, AZ; plans for this center have
been announced previously.

Technically, momentum-based indicators are showing that the
upward price momentum for the stock has slowed, and that it may
currently be overbought. This may signal an upcoming short-term
price decline.

TRANSNET - TRNT:
In my TransNet Analysis published in The Napeague Letter on
January 10th, I projected that the second quarter results would show
revenues of $19.2 million and net income of $316,000, or $.06 per
share. On February 4th, the Company released its second quarter
results, which exceeded my projections. Revenues came in at $19.5
million and net income was $340,000 or $.07 per share

I have to admit that I am surprised at the subsequent performance of
the stock, which has declined consistently since the announcement,
although on relatively low volume. I especially found Friday's
trading to be quite interesting. Although the stock had been
reasonably strong earlier in the day, around 2:30 a single transaction
of about 10,000 shares momentarily pushed the price down below
$2.50. However, as soon as that transaction was cleaned up, the
price rebounded to $2.75. Unfortunately, I was not monitoring the
market at that point, so was unable to add to my position at those
prices. If this continues next week, I will be buying TRNT

Guys; as value investors you might enjoy reading the CTN thread.

This stock was the best performing stock on the NYSE last year. The Centennial
Technologies story is one of the best examples of stock manipulation I have
ever seen. If you read the CTN thread from early December until now, you get a
picture that exemplifies a lot of investing mistakes and emphasizes the
importance of understanding and analyzing financial info and stock valuation
methods. I think it is a teriffic read for people somewhat experienced in
investing, who want to learn more about market psychology, fundamental
analysis, financial statement shortcomings, and stock manipulation.

It is a great learning experience, check it out. Jeff, it certainly makes one
want to embrace your PSR investing approach. How did you put it? Company
management can play fewer games with sales (revenues) data than with the other
numbers they report?

Pete,

Thanks for pointing that out.

Although, BESSIE is still the second largest steel producer in the US (over $4
billion sales), they don't appear to be as well-positioned as Nucor and Trico.
Furthermore, this is the second major restructuring (occuring just after they
had returned to profitablility after several years deep in the red), their
sales are down, cash is not great (.95/share), and I don't see how they are
going to attract big bucks for divisions they can't even make profitable.

I do believe that eventually Beth will effectively cut their costs and return
to consistent profitability, but I feel that Wheeling-Pittsburgh is a MUCH
better value.

Aaron - By most accounts, NUE is going to run over the big 3 real soon here.
There has been article after article about NUE gaining strength. These have
been in mainstream pubs like Business Week, Etc. And the employees (nonunion)
love the company. They make a whole lot more ($4-8K/year) than their union
counterparts in other companies and have better benefits. NUE even pays a chunk
of money for their kids college education - I think up to 3 or 4 kids at the
same time. They also encourage formal (college) training for their employees
which they pay for. The mills are pretty high tech and NUE has the highest
educated workforce. About 30% of their compensation is performance-based.
Management is tops. They are nearing the end of a 3-year capacity expansion
program so capital spending is going to decrease. Last plant coming on line
2Q97. They pioneered the minimill concept. Everything expected to be running at
capacity by end of 1997. Its not a cheap stock by any means but IMO its still a
very good value. I've made good money over the years on NUE and I bought more
during the current weakness. VERY BULLISH ON NUE!

Bid/Ask price

I was checking out the heavy volume on Monday on DSWLF and was just curious
about a couple things. I saw on Bloomberg big block trades going on the Bid
(sell) price. How does one purchase shares at the bid? I thought you can only
purchase at the ask (buy) or is that meant only for the small investor like
myself. Also, if we see heavy trades going at the bid, should it be considered
a sell? Someone has to buy those heavy trades so is it a swap of shares from
one fund to another? Basically, I'm wondering who's receiving big block trades
at the ask. All post welcome.

Me experience with the NasDaq is it basically depends on the stock,
some are "honest" in that there really is an open auction, other stocks the
market makers basically force you to buy at the ask and
sell at the bid. (You end up paying a double commission)
E.G. today I had a limit order in to buy at 6.75 on a stock, the stock
traded at 6.5,was 6.375-6.875 however I didnt get a fill.
I refuse to play this "game" since I know not only will I get screwed
on the way in, Ill also get screwed on the way out, I use limit orders and if I
can't get a "honest" fill I forget about the stock.
I have never had this problem on NYSE or ASE, but quite frequent on
the NasDaq, just ho[pe the SEC cleans up their act a little quicker.

Also HTHR details can be found in the same thread. only problem with this one
is the the bid/ask spread but you should be able to buy at 1/4 under the ask.

A description follows straight from my Omega Supercharts 4.0.
I apologize to those who feel this has no place on a value thread.
I just like to use TA to time my entries once I've found a stock.
By the way, I entered SLOT and JOB on bullish technical signals yesterday. Now
hold SLOT, JOB, OTEXF, PRNI, REF, APF, NMRX. Looking
to get into SUNW (I have a 24 hour optimization of my trading
system running right now specifically for SUNW).

Description:

Gerald Appel's MACD is the difference between a fast exponential moving average
(FastMA) and a slow exponential moving average (SlowMA). During rising markets,
the fast moving average will rise more quickly than the slow moving average,
resulting in a rising differential line or a larger value. During falling
markets the FastMA line will fall more quickly than the SlowMA line.
The specified length of FastMA must be shorter than the specified length of
SlowMA; if not, the oscillator will invert (that is, buy signals will become
sell signals and sell signals will become buy signals).

Conventional Analysis:

Crossover of the FastMA line over the SlowMA line is a buy signal. Crossover of
the FastMA line under the SlowMA line is a sell signal.

Additional Analysis:

MACD is generally better at signaling the beginning of bullish moves than
bearish moves, and should be applied accordingly. In addition to the
conventional usage, careful attention should be paid to changes in MACDMA. A
downturn in MACDMA while a bullish signal is in force is often an early
indication that the current up move is losing strength and long positions
should be closed. Similarly, an up turn in MACDMA while a bearish signal is in
force may indicate that the market is finding support and is ready to rally.

<<How does one purchase shares at the bid?>>

One can't, unless one is the market maker in the stock.

<<Basically, I'm wondering who's receiving big
block trades at the ask.>>

If the trade is at the ask, then chances are it is the market
maker selling stock (and receiving the ask) to an individual
or institution. If it is a particularly large order through
a large broker like Merril Lynch, then the broker can arrange
a trade between individuals or institutions and cross the stock at a better
price for both buyer and seller (usually between the bid/ask). Also, market
makers can buy from or sell to other market makers, in which case the trade is
usually crossed at a price in between the bid/ask. The whole practice is shady.
Hopefully the new Nasdaq rules will help.

I agree with Scott. If one can't get a good price on a stock between
the bid/ask, then chances are either your broker doesn't make
a market in the stock or the broker isn't willing to give you
a break. You see this latter process when you deal with deep
discounters who clear their trades through a larger firm, e.g.
National Discount clears through Sherman. I often get in between
the spread with Schwab, which makes markets in many stocks itself.
If you can't get a good price on a stock, try another stock. If
you can't ever get a good price or you repeatedly get bad fills
I would change brokers. I'm on my 3rd broker myself.

NumereX (see my post 318 on this thread) has a pretty nice
announcement today. In line with my rationale for buying it. You're
right -- they don't seem ready to lay down and let the English economy
dictate its fortunes. A great value play.

Tuesday February 11 5:00 PM EDT

NumereX Corp. Announces Derived Channel Trial System for Argentina

MEDIA, Pa., Feb. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Numerex Corp , announced that DCX Systems
Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) has received an order
for a Derived Channel trial system from Telemonitoreo S.A. The technical trial
will be conducted by Telemonitoreo S.A. in Buenos Aires in conjunction with
Telecom de Argentina (one of the two telephone companies providing service to
Argentina).

Dr. Oscar Ghillione, President of Telemonitoreo S.A., stated, "We are pleased
to be conducting this technical trial of Derived Channel equipment. We believe
the
deployment of Derived Channel throughout Argentina will raise the level of
security for the citizens of Argentina and will provide a valuable tool that
the alarm
industry can use to improve their level of performance."

Jack Reis, President and CEO of NumereX, stated, "The receipt of an order for a
Derived Channel trial system from Argentina represents an opportunity to
establish our initial presence in South America and demonstrates that our
strategic initiative to increase Derived Channel penetration, particularly in
new markets, is
beginning to yield dividends. I am looking forward with enthusiasm to working
with Telemonitoreo to bring the benefits of Derived Channel to Argentina."

NumereX designs, manufactures and markets its proprietary derived channel
system which enables the transmission of data over existing telephone lines to
perform
alarm reporting and other monitoring functions without interfering with regular
voice communications. The Company's Derived Channel products include network
equipment traditionally sold to telephone companies and related subscriber
terminal units sold to alarm system distributors and installers for use at
protected
premises. In addition, the Company offers a line of intrusion alarm products
and network management systems. SOURCE NumereX Corp.

Jeff- Some things on this SI system have me confused; for instance, how does
one reading Value Investing enter a comment to the group without specifically
"responding" to one particular individual? I'm a rather unsophisticated
technician who is getting stuck in "analysis paralysis" and thought that if I
explained my stock picking strategy some one out here could comment and I could
learn and get better at this. I find your comments to be thought provoking so I
entered this entry in a response to you.

From the entries in Value Investing and from people I talk to I get the names
of various stocks that they have come across and like for one reason or
another. From there I look at the charts. First I look at the 5 year chart to
determine if the stock is at a historical high or low. If it is near the
bottom; I take the 5yr high subtract the low and divide by 5. This provides me
with 5 zones; and gives me the breadth of each zone. I follow the stocks that
are in the lowest zone or as I call it "zone 1". By concentrating in this zone
I limit my downside risk and maximize my upside potential. I then list all of
my zone 1 stocks in an order; largest breadth first, smallest breadth last.
Then I concentrate on a short term 6 month chart and look for which stocks are
moving up and which stocks have a rising 50 day ma. Picking stocks that fit all
three criteria has provided me with 9 potential investments. In order to test
my strategy I created a paper trade portfolio with all 9 stocks on Feb 6th;
investing $1000 in each. For the sake of realism I created an identical
portfolio which includes comission costs. The beginning of March I will check
my results and determine the next course of action to take. For now I will list
my February Top 9 and my paper trade price. Some stocks do not make my list
simply because I cannot get a 5yr chart to If anyone has an opinion or comment
I open to learn and adjust my thinking; and if you can help me learn how to
enter a posting without "responding" do so.

H. Sullivan - The only way I know to respond to the group is to respond to one
of your own prior messages. This of course won't work if you haven't posted on
a particular thread.

As for your stock picking technique, it looks like you will exclude growth
cyclicals - like semiconductors which might 5x price during a cycle and 1/3x
when the cycle ends. The upward trend is always upwards but stairsteps so you
may never get back to the 5-year low even at the bottom of a cycle.

Also, sometimes turnarounds don't happen for a couple of years so your span
might be too short.

I stick with Ken Fisher's "tried and true" low PSR method which is based on
fundamentals. It will be interesting to see your results.

Re: NMRX Your numbers look good.

$2.69 net cash per share as of Oct. 31st. However NMRX has arranged a $10 mm
unsecured revolving credit facility, I suppose to fund its purchase of 60% of
Broadband Networks. This will cut net cash per share to $1.80 if it is fully
used.

$3.82 solid book value per share made up mostly of cash, a/r and inventory.
NMRX recently wrote down its inventory so what is left must be solid. Only $3.8
mm of intangible assets vs over $48 mm of shareholders equity. However goodwill
may increase when/if this purchase is completed.

Regarding insider transactions two officers made purchases last summer of less
than $10,000 each, not exactly compelling amounts. In addition two insiders
(not sure their affiliation) recently sold small amounts of stock in the $4.00
range.

Pru Bache recently issued a hold on NMRX with FY97 estimates of $0.32 per
share. Assuming NMRX does not tap its new revolver facility, earns 5% on its
$30 mm of cash and has a 40% tax rate this gives the company earnings per share
of $0.24 net of interest income. So at $4.00 per share one is paying only 5.5x
these earnings net of cash.

I don't really understand the business that NMRX is in, its competitive
dynamics or whether today's announcement was good or bad, (I would guess that
it is a slight positive), however NMRX does appear to be a cheap stock. Many
stocks are cheap for good reasons and the company's recent problems may justify
its low valuation. NMRX needs some sort of catalyst or trigger which will help
unlock the company's underlying value. I don't know what that catalyst will be
or if it exists but that is what is needed to turn NMRX from a cheap stock into
a solid investment.

Thanks, Michael.

Your insight into the rainmakers is very correct. But you would be wise to keep
all three brokers, if you have sufficient reserves. You can become all the
market by yourself, if you use all three brokers. You can corner the market so
to speak and create a large market without people knowing it. But when you sell
you have to program it at the same time at all three places preferably 5
minutes before closing.

You know the MMs and you know the TA. What you want to know is the management,

I would look into their annual report and look at the above on the company in

(Sales/employee), quality control, marketing, etc. Then you own the company.
You will not go wrong.

Jeff, Thanks. I'll keep that (stairsteps) in mind when evaluating. In the back
of my mind, I know that I'm probably missing out on a ton of opportunities by
restricting myself to "zone 1" stocks; but I have limited funds and while I am
not adverse to risk, I don't want to burn up all my seed money with my
mistakes. I'll look into using margin to give myself leverage.

Concerning turnarounds, what do you mean "your span may be too short"? 5yr?
6mo?

Where can I read up on Ken Fishers method?

What do you think of Browns "Cyber-Investing" book?

Finally, I just started looking at Telescan on the web. Any thoughts?

The classic work is called "Super Stock" by the author and was written in 1984.
Also, Jim O'Shaughnessy "What Works on Wall St.", 1996 further validates the
PSR method against about 25 other stock picking methods. Cary Salsberg who
frequents the AMAT thread has often stated that in this market just about any
technique works. However, Fisher's method has been proven against the bears
going back to '29 so I'll stick with it.
