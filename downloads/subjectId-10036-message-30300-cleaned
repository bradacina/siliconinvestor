I am not on margin but I am almost always fully invested so if i choose to buy
something i have to sell something else to do so. Illiquidity invariably means
a sharp decline in prices so I am chagrined if a market shuts down or a stock
does not trade. with respect to tma i clearly stated it was a lottery
ticket-that is a far cry from an investment. as far as being an investor as
opposed to a speculator. Unlike WEB I cant pick up the phone and have an
extensive conversation with a ceo any time i want to, nor can i buy a big
enough position to have the ear of the board. I doubt that any of us here can
do that so on some level does the label investor/speculator matter? I am trying
to scratch out a living in whatever fashion I can. Now it would appear that
someone is going to take advantage of the firesale prices in long term
mortgages but who is that going to be? any ideas?

WLP/UNH are of course Buffett investments, but I never found them attractive,
so I never bought. And Buffett is holding, but he seldom if ever comments on
his smaller stock investments nowadays.

LM - I just don't know (even after selling yesterday). I remember reading
quarterly (annual?) report and call transcript and liking it. On the other
hand, they have now to make infusions into money market funds, which is not
good. Finally, Bill Miller is still underperforming. And if recovery is
predicated on Bill getting his results back, isn't it better to invest in his
fund rather than in LM, which will be a secondary beneficiary? Or will LM act
as a call option on LMVTX results and pop back much more than the fund?

I had the same question about PZN, which I sold: is it better to hold PZN that
invests into beaten-down financials in its funds or just buy financials
directly?

Actually, only certain of Buffett investments rely on him picking the phone and
talking to the board. He may know the people who run KO or JNJ, but I doubt
there is a lot of advantage there, you can buy these companies as well and
actually at prices (for JNJ) lower than what Buffett paid. And his influence on
the boards is not as big as I would want: he never got any CEO to lower his
salary/bonuses in any companies he almost controlled.

Label speculator/business investor matters only in so much that if you own a
business, you really don't care what it's trading at. You care what is its long
term prospects and future earnings/dividends. It is like a house - you don't
sell the house you have as an owner just because it is overpriced. And you
definitely don't sell it if it is underpriced, but may fall lower. And if you
are a part owner of a business/house, you may buy more if its cheap and may
sell a bit if its expensive, but you won't sell when it's cheap... ;)

Being speculator is not necessarily negative. However, if you are a speculator,
you may need all the TA, macro, investor psychology and whatever other stuff
that is not really needed by business investor. And even then it's not clear -
at least for me - whether that many speculators succeed. :)

I am also 100% in the market, so I do understand that you have to make choices
of holding vs. switching into more attractive investments. Nothing wrong with
that. Personally, I do not sell the "core" holdings though, even if I doubt
they will return more than some of the new buys.

Upped my position in Massachusetts insurer SAFT.

Earnings report doesn't look so bad to me. I am expecting stronger competition
in the basic business, auto insurance, as regulators open that market to more
competition. So far, with their reported combined ratio, their only small drop
in earnings, they still seem like they might be a player.

Some persistent insider selling by one guy. Still, the p/e is low, the dividend
is okay (4.8% yield), and now the stock once again sells below stated book
value. Their float (which I presume is "Average cash and investment securities
(at cost") is up 9% to over $1B. That, in a good year (of no significant
catastrophes) could provide good earnings to be spread over the 16M shares
outstanding.

i did my housekeeping today. Sold LM (big loosing position, SHO (concerns about
recession), TYC (taking a good profit for a change, stock is at fair value),
1/2 position in CPX (poor results from competitors BAS, UDRL)

I bought some more WLP today near todays low. I think it is a chance to buy
into a good business very cheaply. WLP simply miscalculated the cost trends at
it seems. UNH may well be affected but possibly less. they have been receding
market share to WLP recently ( amongst others Spekulatius family is now insured
by WLP instead of UNH). However in the CC, WLP noted that they have renewals
coming up during the entire year, so while this may take a while, i think this
trend will reverse over time. Both UNH and WLP are the biggest HMO (next to
nonprofit Kaiser) so I doubt that anyone can underbid them consistently. this
should pass and I am planning to buy more UND/WLP when the dust settles.

Valueminded's post regarding SHO and deflation has got me thinking about
companies that might do well in a stagflation.
In a stagflation I want to own companies that have pricing power , plain and
simple.
I think that North American Natural Gas may be a great angle to play this
theme. I own some service company's (CPX, BJS, UNH) but reduced positions in
BJS and CPX because of poor results from companies in the same sector. Those
service companies don't have much moat,and neither do the drillers. So i
purchased pipeline stock WMZ and think of adding more pipeline/midstream LP's.
The high dividends are attractive and my thinking goes that those companies do
have a moat that allows them to raise their margins and grow their business
over time/ When NG stays where it is, they should do OK, when it rises the
better. And i think NG will rise, it's price will follow oil and in a few years
this resource may become even scarcer than oil.

MCsweet, yes SUAI might work out okay given its current discount to stated book

I believe I'll pass on it though. I'd rather fill my insurance plate now with
larger beat-down companies that have a longer public history, have had more
consistency in being profitable, and have generally increased their book value.

In a beat-down sector, as I say, it's been impossible for me to determine a
priori which company stock will do best when the sector turns. Very possible
here that the weakest, smallest could be the best performers. Possible to see
something like SUAI stock double or more, and do much better than the more
well-known issues. (Assuming that there eventually is a recovery in the
sector.) And of course, there could be something specific that drives SUAI too.

OK, I relooked at WLP and UNH. WLP I did not look deeply - the ROE is too low
for me to buy it. UNH - the ROE looks nice, but margins are low. So WLP is a
definite no-buy, UNH, I am not sure. It dropped a lot since I last looked and
it is definitely lower than where Buffett bought it, but still the expected
return does not look really hot. The debt is rising too. I would not buy it if

WLP, what do you use as an input for ROE. Do you use tangible equity or
nontangible? Both have a lot of goodwill on the books due to mergers, WLP more
so than UNH. Both also have been buying back lot's of stock, which reduces
tangible equity. Based on tangible equity the ROE for both UNH and WLP is
extremely high.
What this means is that incremental new business does not require a whole lot
of capital. the way I see it, medical costs are going to rise in the high
single digits, so assuming that market share is constant and they won't do any
mergers, their revenues should do likewise. not a bad business in that sense.
the problem as we found out is that it really depends on getting their cost
trends right. They pay back 80% or thereabouts on premiums and have about 14-15
SG&A cost and the remainder is profit. if they miscalculate costs by 1% their
profit will tank 20%, everything else being equal.

Hi Spekulatius - Do you have any idea if the industry SG&A will drop
substantially once the industry completes their conversion to digital patient
record accounting? I am not sure what percentage of the overall SG&A is made up
in patient record administration (including digital prescription accounting &
tracking) and billing but I suspect it is large. The current paper system is
inefficient and costly. Many of the Doctors I speak with are in the middle of a
multi year transition from paper to digital patient record systems.

As the first phase of these systems get installed and integrated with patient
prescription and billing functions, my guess is that overall costs will fall
(or at least stop rising) and operating margins will increase. The big benefit
is that management should have more accurate and timely information to manage
their costs and account collections (especially Medicare reimbursements).

It's still early for many of these companies to see these direct costs savings
but once this transition is completed, continued savings will be sustained for
many years. Eventually the market will reward the quality and sustainability of
their earnings and prices should move higher.

I looked at regular ROE, so you are right that assets get inflated by goodwill.
But the problem is that if I look at tangible ROE for WLP, then I should look
at tangible ROE for JNJ and KO and others too. And WLP will still be an
underdog in that comparison - JNJ had a tangible ROE of >100% at some point. In
addition WLP does not have high ROE since 2001, so it's not as if the recent
acquisitions and goodwill depressed it.

You are right in your business analysis. I would guess Buffett saw the same
economics that you see there, so you are in good company. I will keep it in

MLP's Started some MGG and MWE
What both have in common is that they are General Partner (MGG) or GP and LP
combined (MWE)

MGG - General Partner for MPP
5% yield, distributions should grow at 2x of MPP's rate. This should result in
15-20% distribution growth for MGG.
MWP - gas midstream MLP. They also own the General Partner (they merged GP into
the LP shares in return for an ownership stake)
Trades at 12x EV/EBITDA (Y2007). looks like 10%+ growth for a couple of years.

http://www.markwest.com/files/MWE/2008%20Lehman%20Presentation%20FINAL.pdf

For whose who don't own General Partner / limited partener shares, the general
partner only get's paid once the distributions for the limited Partner reaches
a certain thresholds. In the case of MGG/MMP duo, MGG reached the 50% threshold
and now get's paid 50% of the incremental cash flow of the entity (IDR rights).
This results in MGG have approx. 2x MMP's the distribution growth. of course
MGG's downside is that it's yield is currently lower, but if things continue
the way they have in the past that should change in 2-3 years.

Most GP units have not done well. Obviously a deceleration in growth hurts the
GP much more so than the LP. So for there has not been a growth deceleration in
cash flow growth although the current credit crunch could impact the ability to
obtain financing. The above mentioned MLP's however have below average debt
loads,a good interest coverage (3x+) and a stable cash flow, which should work
to their advantage.

I like the pipelines (especially the gassy ones) as recession & inflation
plays. Pipelines have a large moat (mostly), stable and inflation adjusted
income and profit from higher energy pricing, since they are the cheapest mode
of transport. Also inflation makes the pipelines that are already build more
valuable. Of course right now the market has a different opinion.

I have thought somewhat along the lines myself. I purchased a motorcycle (not a

commuting. Even though my commute is < 10miles each direction, I do have enough
gassavings to pay for maintaining my motorcyle.

I don't think that HOG is the way to go to play this trend. The big hogs are as
expensive than a small car,gas guzzlers relatively speaking and don't save much
gas compared to an economy car either.

The right stock to play this would be PIA.MI, the Italian company that builds
scooters (Piaggio, Vespa) and motorcycles (Aprilia, Moto Guzzi). Unfortunately
Interactive brokers does not allow to trade Italian stocks yet. And the stock
looks very weak, most likely due to the high Euro which crimps export profits.

If we have a meltdown in financials tomorrow, I am going to be loading up on
Buffett financials: WFC and USB are first on my list, but AXP and BAC are also
possibilities. I am looking for at least 15% down from Friday's close for such
opportunistic buys. If this does not happen, no worries. :)

JPM maybe another one to buy, but I have not looked at it yet, so this is not a
recommendation.

re Bear - I wonder where the 2$ come from. The value of the fixtures in Bear
Stearns building? The value of building itself would have been about 12$/share.

I wonder about the 30B$ in illiquid assets the Fed is backstopping. I sort of
believe that JPM got a great deal here, they got some good assets for free and
the Fed get's to deal with the toxic stuff.

I am clear of US financials except some dinky overcapitalized thrift
conversions trading below tangible book. i think I plan on keeping it that way
for now.

JPM does not seem to have the subprime flu but I am concerned about their
derivative book that exceeds tangible book. I have no clue what they are for
and if they are posing any risk and i have no desire to find out. in these
times, the simpler the business, the better.

WFC is probably the first bank i'd buy but they are big in the mortgage
business as well. In my opinion the next stage after the subprime is done are
prime mortgages from bubble vintages 2004-2007. All mortgages originated in
that period that a are substantially under water are subprime in my opinion,
regardless of the credit rating of the mortgage holder. Lot's of folks will
walk away, even if they could pay up. so this will be concerning all mortgages
of 2005-2007 vintages with < 20% down. many home equity loans are going to be
questionable as well,a dn WFC has quite a bit of those,e ven so they did
already a partial writeoff.

AXP i like better but i first want to see dealing them with loan loss reserves.
In my playbook they have another 1B$+ reserve boost ahead of them plus pay for
increasing ongoing cardmember defaults. their reserves levels even after the Q4
boost are very low in the historical context, too low for a recession, IMO.

I am going to buy financials tomorrow. I am interested in purchasing some more
pipeline MLP's, and if i get 5% off from current prices , i might bite. I have
about 10% liquidity in the IRA and 25% in my taxable account.

$2/share is overpriced imo. They should just let Bear Stearns Fold. Backing it
up with the Fed is plain dumb. Mgmt ran it into the ground, (imo) let it go
belly-up. Maybe we will start to see some serious reform in both the way these
managers are compensated as well as the fiduciary responsibility of the rubber
stamping Boards of Directors. (my opinion)

Warren Buffett has it right. Look at the management team and if they are
aligned with or independant of the shareholders.

Re: USB. I gather that they were more circumspect in their home mortgage
lending.

From a 2/22 report:

 Analysts have taken note of this cautious strategy, with Dick Bove of Punk
Ziegel going so far as to tell investors in a note that U.S. Bancorp's main
strength right now was that "these guys were not at all innovative in banking."
"[U.S. Bancorp] did not become involved with the capital markets activities of
their peers," Bove said. "The net result is that few problems are being handed
to the current management team. This is a huge benefit in today's markets."
Although Wells Fargo did warn that it added $1.4 billion to its credit reserves
for losses it expects to incur from poorly performing home equity loans, its
status as the nation's second-largest home lender has many analysts agreeing it
dodged a major bullet in 2008 by avoiding riskier loan products.
"[Wells Fargo] has a 'sweet spot' given market consolidation and market share
gains," Goldman Sachs Managing Director Lori Appelbaum wrote in a note to
investors last month. The bank enjoyed a return on equity of more than 17% last
year, the most of any of the nation's five largest banks.
Appelbaum noted the bank could see its shares rise as much as 15% over the next
year, with the stock currently trading 11 times higher than her original
estimate for 2008.
U.S. Bancorp, too, may be poised for gains as investors' general distaste for
bank stocks causes them to overlook another solid franchise.
The bank's presence in 24 states allowed it to see even distribution of
deposits in 2008, a recent report by Moody's Investor Services noted, with no
single state accounting for more than 14% of total deposits. It saw stable
earnings last year and maintained healthy market share, but perhaps most
importantly, it managed to avoid problems associate with the subprime mortgage
meltdown.
The Minneapolis-based bank has also raised its dividend several times in the
last two years, most recently Jan. 15. End of Story

BP - trippled my position and bought both in my taxable and IRA account. This
is my only oil stock at this point.

I doubled up on MGG (MMP's General partner) as i got my desired 5% off today. i
have replaced now my REIT holding (except HRP) with MLP's, WMZ, MWE and MGG. I
plan to add more to MWE when the opportunity represents itself.

All those MLP have been weak, especially the general Partner shares, which have
lower yield but better distribution growth prospects. it also appears that one
can hold quite a bit of pipeline MLP in an IRA account without getting into
trouble with the 1k UBTI limit, since most pipelines produce fairly little
income relative to the distributions. The only case when this is not true is if
there are large hedging gains, but one can reduce the risk by purchasing
positions in small chunks.

re MLP and UBTI.

my understanding is that you only have a problem when you UBTI in an IRA
exceeds 1000$. Most pipeline MLPs luckily produce very little UBTI, in many
cases as little as 10% of the distribution. What can throw UBTI off are one of
gains (like hedging or sales which are fairly rare. Hedging gains occur with
some midstream (like MWE) and really depend on when your purchase your shares.
I gleaned the little knowledge I have from Investorvillage "MLPs" board. Lot's
of great info about MLP's there.

I do not follow E&P MLP's. in my opinion the problem with E&P MLPS is similar
than with Canadian trusts - they trade at a premium to taxable corporations in
terms of reserve valuation and deal with wasting assets (reserve depletion).

A pipeline is not a wasting asset (at least not over foreseeable periods of
time). On the right locations they become even more valuable as the owner can
branch out the network and achieve incremental cash flow growth with relatively
little new investments.

"Most pipeline MLPs luckily produce very little UBTI, in many cases as little
as 10% of the distribution." If so, that's new knowledge for me. I have ASSUMED
that the distributions were mostly, if not all, UBTI. For example 438 shares of
MWE held for a year in an ira and through a distribution of $2.28 per share
(per Yahoo),is - I have believed - UBTI income and at the limit for UBTI in an
IRA (<$1000), or else great tax consequences ensue. If that total distribution
is not UBTI, then I presume there will be some calculations that will have to
be made to make the adjustments become whatever the UBTI amount is. What those
calculations might be and how complex and difficult they might be, I have no
idea. Or else one just disregards the distributions and the K-1 forms or
whatever that the company sends. Neither of these possibilities is attractive
to me. I keep my total K-1 distributions under $1000 in my iras. And try to
skirt the problem (the problem for me, anyway) in other ways.

Hi Paul - This one looks interesting as it tested a new multi year low last
week. Their current dividend is now over 5% but it might be cut like Ford did
with theirs last year. GM's debt is huge but according to Yahoo they still
generate positive free flow cash flow. As interest rates are cut, GM's
financing arm should be able to generate a healthy margin spread on new loans
they originate.

I noticed my last Buy was around $35 so I would like to double up on my very
small position if we get a test of the lows again on small volume. This is a
multi year recovery play and GM may again see their price in the $40's if they
can work down their debt and other pension liabilities AND get a foothold in
China with their different new car & truck brands. Also, it looks like the
company is committed to "hybrid" car production as by 2012 1/3 of their fleet
will incorporate "hybrid" technology.

I have GM on my radar screen but its something I am not actively chasing to get
into. I will let the price come to me and would pick up some shares below $18.
