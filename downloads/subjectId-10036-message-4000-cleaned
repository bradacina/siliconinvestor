YELL & SIMN are both good choices. Some thoughts:

YELL...
If the economy starts to slow, then YELL could benefit with its emphasis on
Partial truckloads. YELL seems to have a handle on labor costs for the next 5
years(was the Teamsters contract ratified?).TA wise the chart looks very good.

SIMN...
Well below book value so has the possibility of a takeover(I'll tell my friend,
his close friend owns WERN<G>). I would think that spring/summer is good for
cooler triucks so earnings should improve if they can get drivers. Sounds like
they are trying but getting unqualified ones(increase in accidents).

Michael,

As a doctor, do you have any opinion on ENMD? I would have thought, and it
appears that the market is in agreement (at least today), that the stock has
jumped way out in front of itself given the research that has been completed to
date.

Sure, it is interesting that they have an agreement in place with Bristol, and
the potential is fascinating, but at these prices it seems a little
unrealistic. Any thoughts on either the scientific or financial viability of
the claims?

Thanks,
Tim

Check your numbers on EMITF.

I just read the EMITF thread a bit, and I got the following info, (which in
some cases are approximations). The mistakes some of the posters made in their
post here
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=3525879
and elsewhere, was to adjust for the taxes due on the sale proceeds.

1. They bought Diasonics for $70M and sold about three years later to GE for
$228M. Allowing for some expenses related to the sale, the before tax gain was
thus about $150-155M, which after taxes gave them a net gain of $104M. The
after tax proceeds (cash realized) is about 104+70= 174M. They have $40M in
debt, so net cash is $134M. With about 21.5M shares out, this leaves net cash
of about $6.24 a share. This is not a net-net with the stock selling at 8.

2. The company owns parts of two other companies that could be worth $2.50 a
share (or more). So the cash plus other equity holdings could be $8.75 a share,
a bit more than the current stock price. Their other businesses would increase
the value of the stock even further.

It seems to me that the possible reason to invest, would be to get a piece of
the action in a company that seems like a budding KKR or Hicks Muse (LBO
firms). After all, they seem to have turned $30M in invested capital into $134M
in after tax cash in three years. Not bad. But if this is the reason to invest,
I'd need to do a whole lot more work analyzing the company.

I admit the analysis I've done so far, is pretty superficial and I could be
quite wrong and low with my valuations.

Now that I've said this, I suspect these guys will go on and make you and them
a fortune. Good luck.

My opinion on ENMD:

IMO, what they are saying their drug does is the
only realistic shot at a cancer cure. Halting
mitosis, immunologic targeting - these have
had a run. But for the last several years doctors
have known that the key to killing cancer
(and curing diabetic retinopathy and other
diseases) is cutting off its food supply - the
new blood vessels that are requisite for
tumor growth.

Angiotensin is the first drug to show possibilities
on this front, and it is exciting indeed.

But, doctors have known about this for
quite a while. Entremed has had its run
due to the speculative fervor in the
market place. Did you see the other
unrelated "cancer" companies rally today?
Pure stupiditiy.

Entremed is no Bre-X or Centennial. It is
a bonafide ethical biotech, with two potential
blockbusters. But a better bet is to wait for a market
correction and buy BMY at cheaper levels, IMO.

Abatix Environmental - (NASDAQ:ABIX)

ABIX is in the midst of a relatively dramatic turnaround. Fourth quarter
net income increased 723% versus the same quarter in 1996. Concurrently,
the Company's Balance Sheet strengthened significantly, with accounts
receivable and inventories declining as a percentage of revenues, thus
freeing up working capital to support future growth.

However, ABIX continues to be undervalued by the market, although there
are recent signs that it is beginning to gain recognition as a solid
investment. Its market price has risen from from below $2.00 in late
July 1997, to its close today (4/6/98) at $4.00. However, it still trades
at a PE multiple of only 9.3, versus a market multiple in the low 20's.

Late last night I posted an updated, in-depth Analysis of ABIX to The Napeague
Letter web site at http://www.napeague.com and also e-mailed a copy to the TNL
subscriber list. Basically, the Analysis update is relatively positive, and
provides additional information about the Company's turnaround.

rogermci: re: RDO. Thanks for bringing out that article. I've relooked at my
reasons for buying RDO. I can't really justify it to anyone here or to myself
just by its numbers. Per Yahoo, the pe is 17 and we're talking a good year.
That's high IMO for a very likely cyclical out-of-favor
agricultural/construction company. HOWEVER. This guy Offutt sure seems like he
can make money. He beats conventional wisdom while doing it too, as I interpret
the article. My guess is he will try very hard also with RDO. (Grow vertically
and horizontally to overcome the boom/bust ag. cycle perhaps?) If what you say
is correct - half of insider buys are by Offutt - then at least some on his
team (the other half of insider buys) believe he and they can do well owning
shares. My ruling reason for buying stays: which was-- "It's worth it to me to
take a small position in this company to see what the top guy can do." In the
past, we've had some discussion on this thread about the importance of
management. Many of us thought it was the key indicator influencing stock
performance. So here is indication that for RDO, at least at the very top,
there is one very talented businessman. Further, the stock is near its lows, so
maybe (m-a-y-b-e) somewhere around here is a time to buy if you were to bet on
the man. I take it as Buffettesque (sorry -g-)in the sense that although RDO is
not a wonderful business - stockholders here are able to go partners with a guy
who is pretty lucky or smart. And in developing his/our business... it's going
to take some time to work out ... like a couple of years maybe. So I agree with
you about an RDO thread: We need patience, not posts. (Note please, that as
usual I am diversified and RDO only represents a small position for me. But if
the stock did crash, I probably could not look at a potato again for a while

The ABIX turnaround continues. After the close of the market on May
6th, the Company released its first quarter financial results,
announcing that "The net earnings for the first quarter of 1998
increased 62% from 1997 first quarter net earnings."

First Qtr.
1998 1997 1997 1996 1995
------- ------- -------- -------- --------
Net Sales 8,675 8,470 34,955 33,066 19,085
% Increase 2.4% 6% 20% 6% 36%

Net Income 187 116 841 756 813
% Increase 61% 11% -7% 275% 56%

Earnings per Share $0.10 $0.06 $ 0.43 $ 0.35 $ 0.36
% Increase 67% 24% -4% 46%

The Press Release went on to explain, "This increase primarily
resulted from increased sales volume, improved pricing and lower
interest expense."

The press release gives an encouraging view of Abatix's future
performance:

Mr. Terry W. Shaver, President, stated "The earnings increase is a
result of efforts from all Abatix personnel. The continued focus of
our sales force on pricing, while increasing our customer base, and
the efforts to better manage assets and control costs have been the
major factors in our improved results. Continued efforts on these
items should provide quarterly and annual results that exceed 1997
results. As previously stated, our primary focus for 1998 was to
increase revenues. Several marketing programs were implemented
late in the first quarter of 1998 and are expected to increase Abatix's
visibility and name recognition in the industrial safety market.
These new marketing programs will provide additional tools to
improve our sales force's efficiency and success, while broadening
the geographic area covered by Abatix. We are currently designing
a new and improved internet site which will also increase Abatix's
visibility. In addition to product information for current and
potential customers, our internet site will also provide more
effective means of communicating financial information with
stockholders and the investment community."

Since late July 1997, ABIX has moved from below $2.00 to close on
Wednesday, May 6, 1998 at $4.25, up $0.25 for the day. Technically,
both momentum-based and volume-based indicators appear to signal
that this trend will continue. Frankly, I expect that today's
announcement may generate additional buying interest in the near
future.

Although I would like to review the Company's 10-Q Report for the
quarter before updating 1998 projections or theoretical valuations, it
should be noted that my latest projection for the 1998 year calls for
earnings per share of $0.50, and that, at $0.47 per share, current
trailing 12 months earnings per share are just $0.03 below that target.
For this reason, I feel relatively confident that ABIX can justify a
theoretical market price well in excess of $8.00 per share.

As soon as I am able to review the Company's quarterly 10-Q Report,
which should be filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission
within the next week or so, I will update the Summary and the in-
depth Analysis which can be found on the Napeague web site. I
encourage you to read the entire Analysis as well as the Company's
investor relations information and its reports to the Securities &
Exchange Commission prior to making any decision to invest in this
or any other Company.

that they have been successful in servicing debt in the past. Of course, if the
business totally falls apart, they are in distinct trouble. This is a
possibility we live with in just about every company in the equity markets.
The most recent debt to equity ratio I have for Hvide stands at 60/40. A

I promised you a net-net. Here it is. This is what I put my HYDEA profits into.
Another footwear company.

Penobscot Shoe (PSO - 6 1/4)

The market capitalization is only $8.6 million, and it is the most illiquid
trader I have ever seen. You won't believe me until you try to buy 1,000
shares. LIMIT ORDER this one, and be patient.

Here goes. The company imports women's shoes and sells them under the Trotters
brand name. I've never heard of it either, but their biggest retail customer is
Nordstrom, which tells me all I need to know. Average price point of about $70
a pair. The company has been in business for a long time under the same
management. The stock is controlled by the founding shareholders. Lets cut to
the chase - this is a crappy business. BUT...
1) It is profitable
2) It pays a 3.3% dividend yield that is not going anywhere
3) Orders have been up over 10% for the last two quarters
4) The company has bought back a very large percentage of its shares in the
last couple years, and may buy back more.

Thats not what you tend to see in a company with a valuation like this:

I will use Ben Graham's net-net technique of valuing the company. Very simple.
What do I own if I buy this business? Start (and finish) with the balance
sheet. In this first cut, we are going to consider fixed assets worthless. We
are only going to value current assets (much more likely than fixed assets to
be worth what the balance sheet amount), though we are going to subtract all of
the liabilities. Here goes ==>

There are 1.4 million shares outstanding, which trade at 6 1/4. So lets start
with the "asking price" in mind (remember, we are buying a small piece of a
business). That asking price for the whole company is $8.7 million.

Now lets go to the latest balance sheet:
- There is $4 million of cash and marketable securities. I know what that's
worth.
- Then there is $4.2 million of accounts receivable. I considered this suspect
until I talked to the company and found out that their creditors are not
middleman distributors, but rather Nordstrom, Dillards, and other big name
retailers. This is a sound number.
- Inventories of $4.7 million. Once again, suspect, until you ask some
questions. For you accounting guys, it is LIFO. And last year, the company sold
into inventories and booked income on LIFO liquidation. In English, what that
tells me loud and clear is that the inventories last year sold for much more
than their value on the balance sheet. So I consider the $4.7 million number
neither conservative nor aggressive (they already took the LIFO liquidation),
but I see no reason to haircut it.

When we add a smidgen of other current assets, we get to $13.3 million of
current assets, or $9.65 a share. Remember, the stock trades at $6 1/4.

Now lets move to the liability side. This is easy. As Buffett and Graham teach
us, question assets, but always assume liabilities are real. Total liabilities
are only $2.6 million.

So that gives me a net-net valuation of $7.78 per share. In Ben Graham-speak,
at a 6 1/4 price, this is a 25% margin of safety. I would have invested on the
above, but there is more.

Remember, we assumed fixed assets are worth zero for our net-net valuation. So
if the fixed assets are worth anything, its "bonus points". What do we find
when we look into Penobscot's fixed assets?

Well, they own just two things (remember the business, they're an importer,
which requires no factories or anything). They own two pieces of real estate.
(Incidently, I am a REIT specialist, so I know how to value real estate.) One
is an industrial property in Maine which I valued very very conservatively at
$500,000. I assumed it was termite and rat infested. i.e. - its got four walls
and a floor. what is the LEAST it could be worth. Then I called the company,
and found out two very important things. 1) the property is literally for sale,
and 2) the asking price is $1.6 million, and they think they could sell it in a
second for $1 million. So take the $1 million number. That's another 70 cents
per share, or 13% of the stock price. If they sold this property and used the
proceeds to buy back stock, its worth even more to me as a shareholder.

The second piece of real estate is the company headquarters, and is not for
sale, but we are talking about a leased building of about 70,000 square feet.
The very least that is worth is $20 per square foot, or $1.4 million. That is
VERY conservative. Add $1 per share.

So lets wrap this up.

Net current assets $7.75 per share
Real estate 1.75
Total asset value 9.50 per share

and the stock trades at 6.25. That, my friends, is what a 35% margin of safety
looks like. i.e. I could be high on my valuation by 35%, but you would still be
paying fair value for the assets.

And don't forget, we would be getting a business (a net-net valuation values
the assets in liquidation, not as an ongoing business) which a) makes money,
and b) pays a dividend yield twice the market's yield.

This is what a value investment looks like. This is my second largest
investment, and my largest U.S. investment. With the dividend and the
valuation, I don't think it has any market risk.

I would be more than happy to answer any questions from anybody who read this
far. Sorry to be so verbose, but I wouldn't put my own money into anything
somebody pitched me in a one liner. Check my facts. The numbers are straight
out of the 10-Q and you can read about the real estate in the 10-K. And the
corporate treasurer takes calls.

Respectfully,

Jim

Nice post. Four questions.

I do not like one customer companies. They have a habit of eventually losing
the customer. It was not clear if Nordstrom was the largest of many, or a
dominant customer? Have you seen the shoe line with an experienced shoe-buyer
of the female persuasion, to assess quality and style?

You said the headquarters was leased (from some owner, I presume).
Please explain how this contributes value. Isn't this someone else's asset?

I think patience may really be required with this one because of the warning
that went with recent quarterly release - of weak orders for the fall/winter
boot line, presumably because of high inventories on hand with dealers due to
extremely warm recent winter. This past quarter was very strong. It is possible
that there may be four quarters in a row now of flat to down comparisons. What
do you think?

On PSO: I answered one question - the largest customer in 1997 was about 13% of
sales. Also, I would characterize the stock buyback program as minor; I did not
see any "very large percentage" repurchased.

Good questions. Given the valuation, I would not expect perfection. That said,

The largest customer is Nordstrom, but this is by no means a one customer
company. Just $1.9 million out of $14.9 million of 1997 sales were to
Nordstrom. Second largest is Dillards.

Sorry for the confusion on the real estate. My bad. The company owns both
buildings I referred to, free and clear. What I was trying to say was that IF
they sold the headquarters, it would be valued as a fully leased (to Penobscot)
property. Of course, that would mean they would pay rent on the income
statement. Irrelevant. I am not valuing the company on income. I am looking at
the balance sheet. What do I own? I own that building.

I will have to go back and check what you are referring to with the boot
orders, but orders were up 10-15% in December and the same magnitude in the
latest quarter. That certainly does not point to down sales. In this business,
the customers forward order, then the company orders from the manufacturers.
The orders are not binding, but are usually not cancelled. Nike tends to ebb
and flow with these forward orders. And let me tell you, Nike would kill for
the forward order growth PSO is showing!

Oh yeah, and the pension plan is overfunded. Not a reason to buy, but just
another few cents of margin of safety.

PSO share repurchase. The company bought back roughly 83,000 shares, or 6% of
the shares outstanding, since year end 1996. Thats sounds like a lot to me.

Once again, remember the valuation. You don't want to hold a net-net to a
standard of perfection. You just want to make sure the company is not
disappearing anytime soon, and that management is not stealing from you. That
said, I don't know many companies that have reduced their share count by 6% in
18 months.

Brendan,

Check out Greenpoint Financial (GPT). GAAP EPS is estimated at $2.36 for 1999,
while cash EPS is estimated at $3.56. The large difference is because they
acquired bank branches a few years ago for cash, and are in the process of
buying BankAmerica's manufactured housing lending operation, also for cash.
This latest acquisition will add roughly $600 million of goodwill to their
balance sheet. It will be immediately accretive to cash earnings, however.

Most bank investors are not used to looking at cash EPS, so GPT is undervalued
compared to other banks, IMHO. Currently trading at 11.8x 1999 cash earnings,
with good growth and a solid balance sheet. I've owned GPT since their IPO 4
years ago, and it is up 455% in those 4 years. Not bad for a "stodgy" bank
stock.

Hi James,

Have been lurking on this board and enjoy your posts.

Yahoo seems to indicate that volume in this stock is less then a 1000 shares

In an earlier post you advised that you were accumulating a position.

It seems that it would be difficult to buy 1000 shares in this stock without
causing a significant price adjustment. Did you accumulate your position buying
relatively small blocks of shares?? How many trades did you have to make before

Roger, I'm not an accountant but I know that some types of acquisitions don't
produce goodwill, and that there is some leeway on how long you amortize it.
Also, I imagine it's harder to screen for acquisition dates than it is for
amortization. My problem has been that of the services available to individuals
it seems like they lump depreciation and amortization together. The trick would
be to screen on (market cap)/(cash flow less depreciation) ... again where
depreciation does not include amortization.

The only thing I can think of is to look for low price to cash flow on
companies in non-capital intensive industries (i.e. where depreciation isn't
likely to be a big factor.)

On PSO, the (mediocre) forward looking statements were contained in the latest
quarterly announcement - both by cause and sales outlook.
As I said, it is possible there might not be a good earnings comparison for the
next four quarters. The next quarter was a loss last year, if my memory of the
10K is correct.

This valuation level has persisted for years it appears. In the absence of a

James,

Thanks for posting the info on PSO. I took a look at the SEC financials on
EDGAR before the market opened and liked what I saw -- then decided to buy 400
shares (which were bought at 6 3/8).

I am familar with their brand of shoes. Trotters are found in stores and from
mail order catalogs that carry "hard to fit" shoes -- I wear a very wide shoe
so I'm always on the lookout for these sorts of shoes. The reason they are
carried in Norstrom and Dillards is that only the top of the line Dept Stores
carry a wide size range of nice shoes. A few chain stores carry wide shoes but
it's their own branded products (i.e. Red Cross Shoes and Hush Puppy). You will
also find "Trotters" in mail order speciality shoe catalogs.

I imagine you will find high customer loyalty -- once people find they like a
brand of shoe (and especially if they are hard to fit), I expect that they
would be repeat customers every year. Of course it's important that the quality
stays consistant -- they aren't selling these shoes based on their being the
latest in trendy style. What they are selling is fit and confort in a
reasonably fashionable package.

It is funny you should ask. I have just finished compiling some data
for the last five years. If you look at the average stock price during the year
following a fiscal year, the discount to financial statement book value at the
prior yearend has ranged from about 20% to
about 40%. Therefore, the current discount of about 20% is high in the range.

Also, there have been 5 insider sales of 28,000 shares over the last
1 1/2 years at an average price of about $6.00, and no buys. I like insiders on
my side in these kinds of situations.

However, I do think this was quite an interesting idea to look into.

Re: "historical discounts" for net nets

This just does not seem to be relevant. These are
not CEFs. A few observations:

1) We are in no way imitating Graham by buying one
or two net nets at the top of a bull market. 3 profitable
net nets found in the last 2 years of looking doesn't
leave much room for diversifying among a basket of them.
And the bull pretty much rules out any great businesses
being among them.

2) Hence, those of us buying the JBM's and HYDEA's and
PSO's are not following Graham, but a separate unproven
theory that they will eventually reach net net value.
Why am I buying PSO? Because JBM and HYDEA both would
have worked out very well. To Graham's criteria, I add:
improving balance sheet, a trigger or other new developments,
and positive cash flow. This is empirical testing IMO.
So far it's working, but I wouldn't say I'd have Graham's
backing here.

3) Do we know that historical discounts for net nets
are predictive at all? Would it have predicted HYDEA's
or JBM's price movements? Not that I can see, but
I don't know and I doubt it's been studied.

4) That said, hey, we're all trying to find value in
this market, and sometimes its good to just follow
rules. Buy a couple profitable net nets at the
top of a bull and wait for a 50% gain
or 2 years, whichever comes first. This is a theory
in testing right now, and we'll never have the numbers
to generate generalizability or validity to any
conclusions we make.

Mike, you took the words out of my mouth. I am testing a theory too, and so far
I am two for two within a year of purchase. Not conclusive by any means, but I
only wish I could find more of these. And Mike, don't tell me we're not
following Graham. Sure, he advocated buying a bunch of net-nets in good
businesses. We clearly can't do that today. But when the alternative is buying
systematically overvalued stocks or parking in cash, at my age, I will try to
do the best Graham act I can. Buy what undervalued stocks I can find, stay at
over 50% in cash or uncorrelated stocks (Asia or high dividend REITS). And pick
off relatively good net-nets whenever I can find one. Something tells me Graham
would have done the same thing in this kind of market. Its a matter of keeping
powder dry for the inevitable time in the next 10 years when value investors
can do their thing while everybody else is licking their wounds. So what you
look for is first LOW RISK, and only secondarily return. If the market were to
drop 50%, would PSO trade at 1/3 of its net-net value? I don't think so.

The criticisms of PSO have deepened my conviction, though I do commend the
thought process. That's the reason why I take the time to post on this thread.
But this business trades at below the value of its net current assets! And its
got another $2 a share in real estate. And it pays a dividend twice the market
rate. OK, there are warts, significant warts. I feel like I am being pushed to
respond to these, and assure those who invested that PSO is the next Microsoft.
Its not! I respond, look at the valuation. You should not expect perfection
when you buy a dollar bill for 60 cents. Part of their product line, boots, has
an inventory problem. OK. Management is less than stellar. OK, but I have no
reason to believe they are dishonest. There is no reason for the stock to break
out of its history of similar valuation. That's a tougher one, and that's where
you have to step back and say, what is the risk/reward? Maybe the stock stays
at 6 for two years. So I collect the dividend and sell. But if it gets
discovered, or God forbid does something to enhance value, I make 40% or more.
I am not speculating on a move before the market corrects. I am investing in
real "stuff" worth $8 a share at the very least, and which is still going to be
there no matter what the market does. If I could find that in a better quality
company, I would. But I can't.

But have you persuaded me that historical
discount to net net means anything? No.

On a practical level, should it mean anything?
We're talking about illiquid profitable
stocks that are net nets for lack of
publicity, high insider holdings/low float,
crappy industry, poor management rep, or just plain ignorance
on the Street. Obviously, Wall Street can
be pretty sudden about its decisions when
it does recognize one - both JBM and
Hyde have had 40% moves over a few days.
If ignorance is the issue, then why
should historical discount mean anything?

I think historical discount makes sense if
you feel the market is efficient in the
stock. I obviously don't feel that way
about any of the net nets I've proposed.

Hyde had a historical discount for just
about ever - Al Frank pointed this out
in 1987. My rule involves buying net nets
at a discount in this kind of market,
and waiting 2 years or for 50%, whichever
comes first. I added some other criteria,
and now I'll see how my particular version
of Graham's classic cheap stock screen does.
So far, it's working, but that's not to
say it will or won't continue.

With any net net, I expect poor earnings
comparisons. I expected them when I brought
up Hyde here, and I expected them when
I brought up JBM on MSN. Nothing in my
conversation with JBM's CFO indicated
earnings would improve, but that was
irrelevant to my focus - were the
assets good, and were the inventories
moveable. In this market,
as James says, if a net net doesn't
look like it sucks, then look deeper.

to the middle of its historical valuation range.

I look at this like I would a closed end fund selling at a healthy discount. A
net-net is really similar with all of its liquid assets invested in one
business. When buying a closed end fund you really should look at the
historical discounts for that specific fund, and understand any changes from
the pattern.

Jeff, you raise a very good argument. I tend to agree with Michael's rebuttal,
but I hear you. As Michael has pointed out, we are not literally following Ben
Graham's doctrine - actually we're not even close. It is impossible in this
market. So it is extremely valuable to really think this through. Thanks for
your input.

As for those of you thinking of buying PSO, Jeff is right. Being patient and
waiting for a price toward the lower end of its historical range is a perfectly
reasonable strategy. (As is not buying it at all if you are uncomfortable with
the investment). Your only risk in doing that is if it runs away from you, but
you don't lose money if that happens. So maybe we say, buy it under 6? That was
where it was when I first found it two weeks ago, but then I ended up having to
pay 6 1/8. Even I did not buy all that I want. I will finish my position if I
see a 5 in front of the price again.

We have beaten this particular investment opportunity to death. What would be
much more enlightening now is if somebody else would take up the challenge of
evaluating another true net-net in detail, and would subject themselves to some
questions. I would love to find two or three more of these on which I can have
a similar level of conviction. I don't think they exist, but I would love to be
proven wrong.

Thanks everybody for a great discussion. I'm going to stay up late looking at

a cautious investor might wait for the shareprice to return to the low end of

Of course the dividend and basic value of this stock make holding it much

Jim (and those interested in net-nets)

I'm going to post a list of profitable net-nets if anyone is interested.

Criterion: 12mm earnings > 0; exchange not equal OTC, mktcap > $5 mil

The screen generated 23 companies.

Here goes:
ACMM, ASFN, VOX, CSTL, CHRB, CRAN, EDIN, ESP, HBW, HYDEA, IDG, ISRL, JLN, MAJ,
NICH, PLAN, OROA, PSO, QSYS, RAGS, RGFX, SCCO, TAIT.

I think something may be wrong with the figures in the database on IDG (i.e. I
don't think it's a net-net), but I posted it incase anyone wanted to look. All
of these are tiny companies.

One that I was somewhat interested in was Taitron TAIT, but decided against
investing in any of the above.

I ran this screen on data from 2 yrs ago, and it not produce compelling
results. It seems an inordinate number of these kinds of companies tend to stay
stuck in the mud. The screen from 2 yrs ago produced 37 companies, with an
average return (pchg Y1/Y2) of 16% and produced 68% winners. The maximum gain
was 92%, maximum loss was 86%,median return of 15.5%. I have not tried to
refine the screen, because it seems these are companies you must dig into and
evaluate individually.

For a snapshot - some of the big winners from the Year 2 pool were. Looking at
these may help identify qualities of net-nets with big potential:

FARL Farrel Corp +92%
HPWR Health Power +82%
KSWS K-Swiss +64%
UEIC Universal Electronics +82%
WTBK Westerbeke Corp +76%
HAI Hampton Ind + 52%

Mike,

Stock options - you just hit the first thing I look for when researching a
stock - hidden dilution. Those stock options, warrants, convertible preferred,
etc. may not show up on the balance sheet, but they are 'stockholder
liabilities'.

Best one I've seen: A weakly profitable company bought out shares of primary
stockholders by issuing a note. Reduced dilution by 66%, tripled EPS, greatly
lowered PE. Close read found a clause in the note given to stockholders that
gave them the right to buy all of the shares back as long as the debt was
outstanding. Would take years for the company to pay down the note, If the
company was successful, note holders exercised their option. If it failed, they
were a creditor getting interest payments and the stockholders would be left
with nothing.

For what it's worth,
Ron

In the early 90s I subscribed to a newsletter(Astute Investor) written by a PHD
who simply ran screens and let individual investors do their own research. This
was before I discovered the AAII and subsequently internet screening
capabilities. The author always had one page that was a list of net-net value
stocks. At the end of one year I recapped the results and was impressed that
these stocks did significantly better than the S&P Index. In those days his
lists contained from 25-30 stocks each month and there was a good turnover
because many of the net-net stocks had good pops based on some surprise
announcement.
I guess the moral of the story is that net-net criteria is useful and if market
corrects significantly the number of opportunities will increase dramatically.
Also it is interesting to note that both hydea and pso were on those 90s lists.
Corollary is that they haven't done much in 7-9 years.
Another comment for the thread. If you believe that a major market correction
is highly probable before the end of the year consider writing bear spreads
using January puts. Today I did a 10 by 10 of Dell Jan 90 over Jan 85 for $2400
net of commissions. Havn't the nerve to sell short as a hedge but willing to
speculate that Dell will fall from its own absurd weight. Choose your own
favorite overpriced stock.

For a last idea for any other conservative senior citizens consider ORU. In my
opinion the ED buyout has a very high chance for success. Shareholders(2/3)
would be nuts to turn down offer of 58.5. Because ORU is so small compared to
ED, monopoly concerns not likely. Downside is that 3 state commissions must
approve. I am willing to take risk for 14 % annual return if merger
completes(20-25% loss if deal collapses).

Shane: re your net-net post here. Thanks for posting candidates and performance
record. Very helpful and IMO much closer to what Graham has espoused.

I thought I recall that Graham looked at these net-nets solely through the
balance sheet, so that in his rules, it wasn't necessary that the companies be
profitable. However, in reviewing my Intelligent Investor ('74 edit.)after
reading your post, I see that for the the defensive investor in net-nets, he
does say the companies should not have a deficit. For most periods in which he
invested in net-nets,I think there were so many candidates that this was a
reasonable condition. (Yet I do think he changed his profitablity rules later
on; I'll have to relook deeper in my Graham materials if I get time.)

Anyway, I do own a couple of the net-nets you mentioned. I'll go through your
list to try to get more I could be comfortable with. And here I believe I
arrive at the same dilemma as others on the thread --as regards Graham's
net-net methods. Because - per Graham's way - it's not a matter of comfort, or
of looking at co. business prospects, or of trying to pick the best from among
the screen sample --- it's a matter only of holding a large enough diverse
quantity of these things, and then playing a percentage game with them (some
will work out okay, others will not).

And as you are showing us, there may indeed still be enough companies with
which to play net-nets, and the method is working. But man, it's a very, very
tough mechanical way to invest. Surprisingly so, if you've never tried it.
Maybe that's why many of us - perhaps all of us - try to make it more
comfortable by trying to whittle down the list to a select very few potentials.
Paul.

Mike B.: re PIOS. Yes, I briefly looked at it a week or so ago. The component
distributor stocks that I've been looking all seem near their lows - MI and
ARW. In the past, I'd never consider buying distributor stocks unless they were
near book value. After all, they are "just" distributors, and so one can't
really expect big profits or high ROE's. However, in this market, and with
distributors consolidating, one-stop-shopping, electronic invoicing, etc.
etc.-- I am not so sure how to value these companies now. Maybe step up to 1.5
book or perhaps by relative psr's. In that case, PIOS might be a buy. I passed
on it because I can't figure out why I should buy PIOS vs. ARW. (I'm watching
ARW now). PSRs and price/book are relatively low for PIOS and ARW. I also view
MI as an aggressive competitor. This might be a reasonable time for someone
with patience enough to wait for better times to begin establishing a position
in one of these larger companies.
Another company I will consider is TAIT (brought to my attention by Shane M's
net-net post) which is selling at a somewhat attractive price. They are very
small (the big drawback IMO), they are profitable (okay), they have authorized
a second share repurchase (positive).

I have no positions in any of these companies now; I'd be interested in how
others view these businesses. Paul.

Jim and I regularly cruise for decent net net opportunities
and I was somewhat surprised to see such an extensive list
of not only net nets but profitable ones. Recognizing many
in the list immediately, I concluded that there are two
major problems here:

1) the data for the screen is faulty
2) the list confuses the difference between a net net and a net net
buy, i.e. there has to be a margin of safety in the discount to
net net value ( Graham wanted a 33% discount at least).

I went through the first bunch of companies you listed - by
going through the SEC filings- and came up with the following
ratios (market cap/net net).

ACMM 1.0
ASFN 0.97
VOX 0.90
CSTL 1.66
CHRB 1.70
CRAN 0.92
EDIN 0.94
ESP 1.10
HBW 0.95
IDG 2.07

I stopped at this point, though I may go through the rest
of the list when I have more time. It is obvious that these
are not at all "profitable net net buys" a la HYDEA, JBM,
or PSO. These three had ratios < 0.70 at the time they
were discussed, thereby providing a decent expected return
of near 50%. The best ratio in the bunch - 0.9 - only provides an
expected return of 11% - not a significant margin of safety IMO.

Moreover, VOX and ESP among several others seem to be
actively collapsing, with sales shortfalls greater than
30% and recent ventures into negative income.

I have commented in the past that I can take a list of
15 net nets down to 1 or none in about 30 minutes with
SEC Edgar. This is not because I am seeking the best ones,
but because I am simply seeking true net nets at 2/3 of
net net value, as Graham advocated. To do this, I don't
even look at the income statement or the business they
are in. If I find one, then I will look at the other aspects,
but I rarely take this next step because 2/3 net nets a la Graham
just are not out there in any great quantity.

Screens have inherent limitations - even the best ones.
Historical testing of the net net hypothesis should recognize
the problems in the data and the potential pitfalls in not
recognizing the 2/3 criteria for a buy.

Good Investing,
Mike

re Graham's 2/3 margin of safety with net-net.
This would be for the "defensive" investor I believe.

For the "enterprising" investor it looks like Graham suggested only "... a
diversified group of stocks selling under their net-current-asset value". There
is no mention of 2/3. Some examples show purchases at 2/3, but some show at
net-net. (These though are of 'prominent' companies (ref. Table 15-2) -- a
category of net-nets that disappeared looong ago -g-).

I'll take any list of net-nets. I'm going to censor it and make choices
regardless of whether the stocks are selling at at 100% or 66% of net-net. Paul

Mike,

Re: Net-Nets

You are correct concerning the discount on the net-net. If you are looking for
net-nets selling at 2/3 discount there aren't many.

You are correct that some of the market cap data is wrong. For example, IDG
stood out to me as one of the best companies in the group, but when I looked
into it I found that the market cap value was faulty as you mention. I
mentioned this concerning IDG in my original post. The data in the database can
also be dated (this is particularly true with microcaps as most of these stocks
are not updated as rapidly as the larger companies).

In my original post I was going to post the discounts to net net, but given the
limitations of my data that you point out, I decided not to. I apologize for
not expressing my reservations.

As you mention, alot of these companies are dogs. I did look into VOX and
quickly excluded it from consideration because of the collapse you mention. A
case might still be made that it should be worth the current assets less
liabilities on it's balance sheet.

One thing I might mention here is that a deep net-net discount might not be
needed to generate solid returns. In the dataset from 2 years ago the top
performers had a net-net discount greater than 85% or higher.

Since there seems to be interest in this I will post the data when I have a
little more time.

Two examples of ugly businesses but what I believe pass for net -nets with a

but may rebuy in again if it drops below $2. Desi, I have established a
position it already. Both of these based on my analysis are businesses with
blemishes but none the less, I believe they will pass the Graham criteria of
net/net. ie. My analysis shows DESI trades at >30% discount to net current

Shane M. re: Bowne (BNE). Well, I'll respond, but I'm not the expert you are
looking for. (I gave him/her/them a couple of weeks to respond, but I didn't
see anything). BNE is one of the few printers who supply the legalese documents
in takeovers, mergers, etc. It's a niche business IMO --secrecy and trust are
important as one might expect, so there's some barrier to entry. Yes, in market
downturns, this stock has dropped - and IMO - both because it's a stock itself,
and because volume of work decreases and BNE customers (financial cos.
themselves come under cost constraints)put pressure on BNE. That's IMO.
In the past few years, BNE has expanded in at least two ways. They've got very
digitalized, and IMO have used this expertise to manage or outsource the
stockholder info reports that companies use to communicate with their
shareholders. BNE as a value stock could generally have been bought in the $10
range over several years in the '80's and 90's. (Still sorry I didn't!) But now
we may be looking at a growth vehicle rather than a mundane publisher.
Therefore, from a strict value perspective (that is, from MY perspective of
value)I see the stock price as high, the pe as fair, the psr though as
relatively too high (now compared to past years), and the price/bv. also
relatively high. Not a particularly great value play. However, if BNE is viewed
more as a growth vehicle (or comes to be viewed that way), then the current pe
of 15 is (or may be) low, the revenues are increasing nicely, business is
expanding, and the stock price might just be a good buy at this point
(especially if this is the point at which the perception of the company is
changing to technical/niche/growthie from stodgy/publisher). Just my thoughts.

Paul,

Thanks for the comments on BNE. With merger mania in high gear at the moment it
does appear a strong possibility business will slow in the near future for that
segment of the publisher.

The digital portion of the filings through SEC Edgar has in a way _expanded the
pie_ for all of the financial publishers. They must file electronically through
EDGAR now, but I don't think that the paper reports will diminish to any
significant degree.

In reading 10K for Bowne and Merrill (competitors), they both indicated major
growth opportunities in electronic filing. It seems that the players in paper
filings are remaining players in digital filing also. This would seem to be
appropriate, but it's nice to confirm that the transition is not creating a new
competitor.

Overall I like BNE. Nice growth characteristics for its current valuation. But
like yourself, I wish it were a little cheaper for entry. I'm waiting for a dip
that may never come.

Two discounts to net value are shown, each using the different mkt caps.

doesn't sound so good for someone who's counting on a book value figure (or
net-net). TAIT is at 2.75. If it were to drop to maybe 2.375 again, I'd
probably like to buy some with an intention that the stock would eventually get

I'm surprised at how little we are hearing on this thread about tobaccos. I
can't think of anything more contrarian except Indonesia, and I'm in that
already. I have not bought tobacco yet, though I have made money on them in the
past. I posted this on another thread, and thought it might be worth posting
here:

There are several ways to play the tobacco industry, all of which are very
contrarian, and each of which look like "value" in their own way.

1. RJR - bankruptcy risk is very real. Yield of 7.4%. Plus you've got the
non-tobacco value of Nabisco worth four dollars more than RN's stock price. If
it sounds too good to be true, it very well may be. I would not touch RJR.
You've got much more risk than Philip Morris because of the balance sheet, but
since Camel's business gets killed by Marlboro, especially internationally, you
get none of the long term reward.
2. MO - one of the greatest money machines in the world - the key is they have
the foreign tobacco business which RJR lacks. We're talking Coke vs. Pepsi.
4.4% yield? Very tempting. The stock would go to 50 if things in Washington
calm down. But what about bankruptcy? It is a risk, and I would not call it
remote. I cannot quantify the liability as long as politicians and lawyers are
running the show, so I am going to be conservative on this. But at 30-33 I
would almost have to bite. If I decide to buy tobacco, I am going to buy the
best company in the industry.
3. UST - a different segment of the industry (smokeless) and one which is not
being directly targeted by the politicians...yet. Lousy management, but the
kind of business that my dog could make money out of. 6% yield with a balance
sheet and a unique Washington risk profile that make bankruptcy unlikely.
4. LTR - Loews. Say their tobacco business were worth zero. The stock is worth
about $110-120. It trades at $89. Same story as RN, without the leverage. This
puppy's not going bankrupt anytime soon, but I would not invest in this
industry for an upside of 20% (whatever the settlement, LTR is still going to
trade at a big tobacco discount). Plus, I want the tobacco economics if I am
going to take this kind of risk. LTR's tobacco business is a small part of an
investment in the company (except when you're talking risk).

I own no tobacco stocks, so don't misunderstand me. But if these go much lower,
I probably will start buying. Then believe me, you will see tobacco stocks on
this thread regularly!

If I am going to be paying $20 a pack for cigarrettes, the dividends will be
helpful.
