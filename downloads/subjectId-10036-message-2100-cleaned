Paul,

Re: CCN

Yep, still in it. I called the company just a few days ago
to straighten out how they account for everything.
The 18M class B BHC shares they own are convertible
to class A shares at a 1:1 ratio. When asked whether
we should therefore value the shares at the current
~130 price of the A shares, one of CCN's finance guys
assured me, "yes of course, maybe more since they
are controlling shares." With the cash tossed in, you
can still buy CCN at a fully diluted price less than
it's assets net of liabilities. I detailed this some
more under the Portfolio portion of my web site.

You get a large cap for free with about 120M left over. Not that common an
occurrence. Take a look at the
income statement and it becomes even more of a no-brainer. A
profitable, cash flow positive large cap for free?????
CCN is still a buy at these levels, IMO. It's 15% of my
portfolio.

Good Investing,
Mike

carl, as a regular on mike's thread, i think i can explain what mike was
talking about - he can clarify when his compaq is up and running again.

mike plays undervalued or overvalued stocks that he expects a decent move out
of over time (of course, the valuation is in his opinion). let's say he feels a
stock s/b properly valued at $20 and it is $12.

he'll buy a 1/3 position so that he has powder dry if it drops lower. if it
goes up immediately then he's happy he''s in. his 1/3 system is designed to
counter the fact that nobody knows what a stock will do short term. it is
designed to minimize risk.

mike's comment about the short term traders is that when they are right they
get a half point or so. when they lose, it may be a couple points. they'll win
more than they lose, but, overall, they'll tend to lose over time.

they look more at trends and stock price noise vs an actual fundamental
analysis of a company.

come on over to the thread. it is the best one on si when mike's computer is up
and running :-)

anyway, i KNOW he'd enjoy your analysis of txn ;-)

Ron:

I appreciate your mentioning of JWC. I did some of my own dd last week and
decided to get a few shares. It seems waayyy undervalued even after the current
runup. I did pick up some news that they are being considered for a buyout by
some firm in new england but did not catch the name or any idea of the purchase
price. Based on my rough calculations, I would put it in the 20's.

What are your thoughts and have you heard of the above information. Supposedly
it was on the dj news service but I have been unable to pick it up.

Alsso, would you mind posting a few more of your recent picks (or if you have

Chris,

Paul S. posted the news article. From my read on the company, they will resist
any attempts at a take over. On Friday afternoon, they made a PR stating this.
The management of JWC wants to run their own show, but an offer around 20 would
likely be too tempting. I would likely be out of it before it got there.

Have no stocks I like a LOT right now. Directors of one of my recent buys filed
144s last week and I'm still evaluating this news.

earnings growth next two Qs. Paul S. can tell you far more about ELAMF than I
can. Insiders just filed 144s on DSWLF, but it's a small portion of their

Mike: I'll go for now with a small amt of CCN and increase as I get more
comfortable. Thanks for your work on this one. Numbers look good, but that's
not why I'm buying. It's something about St. Joe and Tejon, CCN and me. At this
point I would rather be in CCN for 18 mo to 3 years and see it do nothing, than
be out of it and see it rise. Like the other 2 stocks, the underlying values
ALWAYS have looked good -- and these stocks slowly (until James Clarke buys
-g-) have gone up. (Aside: Mike Price says, I recall, that St. Joe was in Max
Heine's portfolio at a now split-adjsted $1/sh. when he (Mike) took over the
fund in '75.) I have been refusing to swing at the same good pitch by Mr.
Market year after year. So I've missed Tejon and St. Joe. For CCN - time for a
change in thinking.
I see the CCN value based on the numbers, but I've not ever been able to see
the value behind the numbers. TV stations seem to be having a rough go of it -
everything's cable and/or being wired to the internet. TV and Siegel's network
are passe ?? Maybe he won't be able to give away the business in 5 years. But
maybe too, all this is already reflected in the stock price. And so far, anyone
who's bought the stock has made money (although the stock performance itself is
not so great compared to some stocks we've discussed here).

Siegel is one smart cookie - or so I've read. He is a winner it seems, and the
smart bet - being made by Gabelli and Price - is to keep betting on the man's
being able to survive and thrive in a business he knows well. A billion five in
the till doesn't hurt either -g-.
So count me in.

Note to Mike Burry: Mike, apologies if I implied that I didn't/don't use your
website.. I do, and did check Sealpoint before asking about CCN, but wrongly
had stopped at stock-of-the-month, so I incorrectly assumed you didn't still
own CCN...And now I do remember you saying here that you post your portfolio in
the (of course) portfolio section of Sealpoint. I'll make sure in future I
check that section too. Paul.

Re: Market Trends

I've thought a lot about this -- I have shorted stocks
like Coke and Wells Fargo, I've shorted the S&P, I've
raised cash and then bought back in. I am coming to the
conclusion that I will focus on the value in individual
stocks. When the market crash comes, I will be hurt
less by it, and if it doesn't come for another two years,
I won't be hurt by my shorts. That said, I manage two
accounts, and one is nearly 40% cash, the other 30%.
This must have something to do with the lack of value
out there, because believe me I am looking. I am tempted
to keep 30% cash until we see a significant correction,
just so I can have some fun buying some screaming
bargains. But if I find a good value, I won't let my
cash goal stand in the way.

Market trends are not worthless, and they do warrant
discussion to an extent. Certainly year-end trends
matter. I would have to feel awfully good about a
stock that has been down this year to buy it now.

Mike

PSR has been below 1 on average every year since '91. (It's above 1 even now

Price to book is high compared to previous years. Sales have really increased
over past years - but can co. keep doing this? (Probably would be smart for an
investor to learn something about this business before investing.) Seems like
these drops are now common with small co's - customers play end-of quarter

FWIW Red Chip review feels this should be bought esp. on the price drop.
Although PE is high (although not stratospheric), IMO it is very reasonable if
one looks at recently reduced levels of growth in the 30% plus range. I really
felt a 40% price drop in one day was unwarranted, given that the inventory
adjustment problem with LU could be considered a one time event. It was
incredible to me that the market cycled through the float in one day! Approx. 4
mil. shares in the float, so this is obviously a stock prone to a lot of
volatility (the fact that it resides on NASDAQ contributes to this, as well)

Mike,

I don't have the experience, but I last year I noticed the Funds making major
adjustments to their portfolios in November and December. They were getting rid
of stocks that had gone down thru the year and replacing them with stocks that
had gone up to make their portfolio report look good at year end. They didn't
want to report that they had bought losers and were only holding winners, even
if they hadn't owned the winners when they went up. It made for some very good
buys of oversold stocks and some good sells when they readjusted the first of
the year and brought in new monies. I found some really undervalued stocks just
by watching the biggest losers list. (SNDK @ 8.5 was my best buy)

It seemed to start mid Nov. and got really heavy the last couple of weeks in
Dec. Is this a common occurance?

Ron

Re: end-of-year trends,

Two aspects of the end of the year make certain
depressed values even better values.

1) Window-dressing by mutual funds/money managers

As you point out, losers are dumped and winners
are bought with abandon. I've noticed this happens
less when the market is really doing well and everyone's
up. More common when the quarter has been a difficult
one.

2) Tax-loss selling

It makes sense if you have a big loss in a stock
you are holding, but have taken profits in more
successful stocks, to sell the loser. This way
you can offset some of your profits. Because everyone
does this, there is a good chance you can buy
that loser back in 30 days at an even lower price,
pay very little taxes on your profits as a consequence.
The difficulty here is timing it right. There's
always the danger that the long-suffering holder
of a poor stock will miss the two-day double for
which he/she had yearned.

This tax-loss selling has made for the much-publicized
January Effect. Since selling hits small caps so
much harder than large caps, small caps tend to become
very depressed as the year closes out. Then in January,
because the renewed buying bouys small caps so much
more, the small caps jump, yielding historically outstanding
returns for small caps in January.

Many people have been amazed that the January effect keeps
happening despite the widespread recognition of the fact.
It makes sense though -- the will to avoid taxes is matched
only by the lust for making money quickly.

Since, by default, most of us here are small cap investors --
that's where the value is -- it's important to be aware of this
fact. For those of us who have not been sitting in losing
stocks and truly have cash to deploy, the end of the year
is a great time to snap up small cap values.

Good Investing,
Mike

Wallace, IMHO -DATM was way overpiced in the mid 40's and the drop was just
waiting to happen anyway. I listened to the CC, and as long as it is just a one
time 'inventory' event, everything will be fine in three months. I think it's a
nice growth play, but definately not a value play at 25-30. (I like it at 15 :)
If this adjustment keeps Lucent happy than it is worth it in the long run. The

Mike's post deserves more comment. The January effect is very real if you are a
deep value small cap investor. Every December 31 I pick a couple stocks I
already own that are likely to go up in January, and I have never been wrong.
10, 20, 30%. What you want to look for are 1) small cap 2) down year over year
3) really tanked for no reason from October to December.

After two years watching stocks I already own, this year I want to be
proactive. I plan to do this:
1) Anything with a profit (and favorable tax holding term) that looks extended
I will sell in the next month or two to raise cash.
2) Stocks with a loss I will sell right now but will look for the opportunity
to buy them back cheaper. CAVEAT - who knows tax law - aren't we only allowed
$3,000 in tax losses in a year to offset gains, or will that change with the
new tax bill? I've taken my $3,000 already, unfortunately.

3) And this is the fun part. START IDENTIFYING STOCKS THAT ARE DOWN THIS YEAR.
SET A REASONABLE TARGET PRICE TO BUY AND THEN DISCOUNT THAT PRICE BY 15%. AT
THE END OF DECEMBER (b/t Christmas and New Years) BUY WHATEVER FALLS INTO THAT
RANGE. You'll find some very profitable buys. The key is to raise cash now,
because you won't be able to do it then in small caps.

A few I might suggest to start researching. JC, WHX, HYDEA.

I have no info beyond 10Q and 10K analysis. I have held for a while and
recently added. You say growth sector and I do believe that there is potential
growth but wall street said differntly. Their peer group declined steadily from
100 to 66 from 5/92 until 5/97 as shown in the performance graph in the annual
report prospectus. The peers are dm,eaco,
eei,mcon,fdgt,gzea,itx,trr,watr,vsr,and wstna. I am familiar with some of these
companies and believe hrdg to be better than most. Hrdg declined from 100 to 45
in same interval. There is quite a bit of stress in the sector and
opportunities for consolidation are good. With almost 5 dollars cash per share
the company would be a nice acquisition but more likely they are in a position
to acquire. Executive salaries are modest. Not a greedy company. President owns
142 k shares and directors and executives own 16.7% Board seems to be solid.
P.S. Always request annual meeting proxy with investors package because peer
group review and executive compensation and qualifications can be assisted with
data in this report.

for those interested in NCR news:
DAYTON, Ohio, Oct. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- In a move to bring banking
convenience to Kmart customers, NCR Corporation (NYSE: NCR) and Kmart
announced today that they will install more than 1,100 ATMs in Kmart
stores across the United States. NCR and Kmart also will partner with
several banks nationwide to provide banking services throughout Kmart's
retail network.

"Consumers now place greater emphasis on convenience than ever before,"
said Andy Orent, vice president, self service, NCR. "In the last five
years, there has been a 74 percent growth in ATMs outside the
traditional bank branch -- in locations such as convenience stores, gas
stations and retail stores like Kmart. NCR's long-standing expertise
in both the financial and retail sectors, enables us to provide
world-class quality ATMs to help meet the needs of customers."

NCR will install its ATMs in the highest-volume Kmart stores in every
state in the continental United States. In addition to the ATMs, NCR
Worldwide Customer Services will provide implementation and support
solutions that includes site audit, wiring and daily support services.
The NCR cash dispensers will deliver an added service to Kmart
customers and enhance the overall convenience of shopping in Kmart
stores.

"NCR brings world-class ATMs to Kmart, enabling our consumers to access
cash whenever they need it most," said Paul Hueber, senior vice
president, store operations, Kmart. "NCR has distinct capabilities and
understanding of the retail market, making them the best ATM provider
for our stores."

Last year, the number of ATMs installed in non-bank locations more than
doubled to almost 22,000 -- 10,000 more than the number of ATMs placed
in traditional bank locations. According to Orent, this explosion is
driven by consumer demand for fast, convenient access to cash.

Kmart Corporation (NYSE: KM) common stock is listed on the New York,
Pacific and Chicago Stock Exchanges. Kmart Corporation serves America
with 2,122 Kmart, Big Kmart and Super Kmart stores. In addition to
serving all 50 states, Kmart operations extend to Puerto Rico, the U.S.
Virgin Islands, and Guam.

NCR's Financial Systems Group is an industry leader in three primary
areas: financial delivery systems including self-service, relationship
banking data warehousing solutions and image and payment systems.
These solutions allow financial institutions to reach customers more
effectively and to develop more tightly linked relationships through
self-service, traditional bank branches, call centers and home banking
channels. NCR Corporation designs, develops, markets and services
information technology products, services, systems and solutions
worldwide. NCR is located on the World Wide Web at www.ncr.com .

Chris,

I have sold 1/3 of JWC and have a negative cost basis on the amount I plan to
keep long term. It sure was great timing to have it just before the news
article came out on it.

Sectors - no great science and not a matter of experience. There's major money
coming into the stockmarket and the brokers will profit so I looked for
undervalued firms. I have sold my AMTD because they rely on trading volume and
are now, IMO, overbought. I'm keeping SWST and JWC because they will do well
even in a bear market.

I'm in DSWLF and ELAMF because of strong US dollar, tight US labor market, and
companies increasing oursourcing. DSWLF has already started up and will reach
30 in next 30 days, ELAMF is at 11 heading for 16 around year end.

For what it's worth,
Ron

Corrections,

CERB - BV is $24.08/Share, Cash is $25.03/s but deduct current liabilities
reduces this to $16.88.

Uncompleted contracts 6-30-97 of $24.4M vs. 6-30-96 of $5.1M
Backlog 6-30-97 of $16.1M vs. 6-30-96 of $4.9M
Last year's fiscal revs were $26M, loss of $199,000 = EPS(.137)
Last Q revs of $8.3m w/earnings of 661K = EPS +.46

Any input appreciated.

Stuart,

Near as I can determine: The deal was closed just before the end of the Q and
they don't really have any plans for the money. Capital apparently exercised an
option to buy back the shares. I found no mention of it in the 3-30 Q report.
They have used excess funds well in past and I think they'll put it to good use
now.

I took a position because of the BV and cash. Looking into it, I find they have
almost as much under contract as last year's sales and backlog on 6-30 of $16M
is double the revs for the 6-30 Q. Reported a loss of .13 for last 4Q with .46
gain 6-30 Q. They look like they are going to be doing very well next Q on
operations plus they'll have +/-.20 EPS interest on cash. It's now looking like
a good PE buy along with the equity.

I also looked at their historical growth and they've shown respectable growth
on operations plus appreciation of investments made like Capital that they
don't report. Book Value of assets looks greatly understated. They're taking
high depreciation and amortization write-offs, the properties look to be in
good locations and has been owned for a long time so it's likely on books way
under value. They hold some good patents and they aren't afraid to protect
them. Looks like potential in many areas. Take over is unlikely as the B shares
are non-trading shares held by insiders and have 10x voting power of A common,
otherwise equal. All this does is insure that current management makes the
decisions.

I like it more now than when I first looked at it.

Just MO,
Ron

Cash of $16.88/s is amazing considering that DBC-Online reports their
debt/equity as 0.01! Does the figure for cash/share take into account the
dividend paid out immediately after the sale of Capitol? With such a backlog of
orders I would hope the cash to be used for expansion/acquisition. Does anybody
know any specifics of this industry (such as what exactly "excavationless sewer
and pipeline rehabilitation" means?)?

I'm new to this so my opinion is probably not worth much but this appears to be
quite undervalued despite the recent inrease in shareprice. My only concern is
management. What makes you say that they have used excess funds well in the
past? In general, what do you look at to judge management effectiveness?

Sorry for all the questions but I decided to pick one of these stocks as a test
case for my value skills. Still working out the bugs and would appreciate the
help.

Thanks,

The "excavationaless sewer and pipeline rehabilitation" is a proprietary system
= process and materials = a sleeve that they install in sewers to stop leaks
and repair damage. The process is "trenchless" in that they do not dig up the
ground to get to the old pipes or damaged areas. Obviously, it saves the
municipality a lot of dollars if it can repair its pipes this way instead of
digging them up.

Insituform used to have geographic franchises, each of which traded as a

to review this). Their business has mirrored the municipal infrastructure
repair cycle. Profits have been spotty. I believe that during the past couple
of years there has been an attempt to consolidate the franchises. I believe
that there is competition. I'm not sure that the sleeves they pressure into
pipes can only be bought by them. Spend time on the K's and Q's. I worked them

Yes, too amazing,

Check out the 10Q and you see that once you subtract out the
current liabiilities and substantial long term liabilities, you
get much less of a value. The company is not selling for free,
and is not at a discount to its net net assets. You are indeed
buying the business, so it is up to the investor to find out how
much the business is worth. I'm passing based on my review.

Mike & others - CERB,

I am not recommending CERB, I bought and posted to thread for others to
consider.

We seem to have different numbers on the company.

Long term debt = $0.00
Only major debt in long term is Deferred taxes.

$36M liquid assets = $24.50 /Share
$13.4M TOTAL liabilities = 9.12 /S
Pay every debt off leaves $15.38 /S liquid plus understated fixed assets of
$12M = $27.38 BV. Deduct non-owned interest in assets of $8.84 for a net BV of
$18.54 /S.

At 10.25 is selling at 55% of BV.

Sporatic profits. Equity has more than doubled in 4 years in spite of
accelerated depreciation and amortization.

Backlog on 6-30 amounted to double revs for the Q when they had a .46 profit on
continuing operations. IMO the next two Qs will be strong without new
contracts.

I have taken a small position for long term hold intending to review each Q. As
the new cash from sales of Capital Office would easily add .20 to EPS, the next
two Qs could be in the .60-.70 area giving 4Q earnings over $1.70. IMO price
could be $16+ after next Q report.
The strong cash position doesn't just improve profit potential, it could make
them a take-over target.

Time will tell,

John,

Questions are exactly what I'm looking for on CERB. That and arguments about
why I shouldn't have bought so I can get out break even.

The dividend was before the report and should be in the numbers, but I would
have to look at again to be sure.
I would imagine they will put the monies to work in expansion. There's a lot of
territory they aren't covering. However, they may look for another investment
like Capital Office. I still think this came sudden and for now they have no
definite plans for the monies.
I've been in construction for years and, while I haven't done it, the use of
liners in old sewer and storm water piping is a growing field. It saves the
cost and inconvenience of having streets torn up but it's only good if the
existing piping is large enough.
When I look at management, I base most of my evaluation on past performance.
CERB has doubled shareholder equity in four years. A drawback and a strength of
CERB is the two brothers that totally control the company. They draw small
salaries and take very little in the way of stock options in spite of the
company growth. How many CEOs of companies worth $25M earn $300K salaries? They
have been very responsible to stockholders and I expect this too continue.

I also have little experience with the market as I took monies away from an
inefficient broker about a year ago to do it myself. I've also been asking a
lot of questions, mainly about the market. I have been making out and reading
financial reports to evaluate companies for years and do feel comfortable with
my ability in this area.

If you want to test your skills, look at Inland Casino (INLD).
Don't buy it!!

I haven't quite figured out why, but on quarterly sales of about $8-9M earnings
from ops should be in the $0.10/share range, not $0.46. THis is based on
historic quarterly earnings from ops as in the 10K. Somehow, they also earn
another $0.30/share elsewhere (not just interest) which I haven't quite tracked
down. It must have been the contribution of Capitol Office Solutions. In any
event I think we have to deduct about $0.30/quarter in earnings from here on to
account for it.

Even so, if they earn $0.10 from ops and $0.20 from int that's $1.20/year for
an PE under 10 and a PSR of around 0.5.

BTW the 12 month backlog in March was $19M so it's down by $3M or so this
quarter.

I'm still digging. Can you help me understand how to factor in the non-owned
interests. I see you deducted that from the assets to arrive at BV. I don't
understand what that is. Also I don't see where their equity in INEI shows up
on the balance sheet. It is worth about $2.75M for the common but I don't know
the value of the preferreds.

How about a $9 billion stock that trades at 50% below its value? Before you get
too excited...its an airline. What a crappy business, but everybody knows that.
The crappiness (if that's a word) of the industry is in the price. The industry
is earning much more than it ever has, but it trades at 8 or 9 times earnings
in a market trading at 21 times.

But lets say airlines are fairly valued at that price. And that is highly
debatable. What if the leader in the industry were trading at a 40% discount to
its comparables. That sounds like an opporunity.

Every value investor needs to take a look at AMR, the parent of American
Airlines. It trades at $120 and absolutely blew out estimates today but didn't
move. To keep you reading, I think it is worth at least $170.

Back out its holdings in Sabre, which are quoted on the NYSE. That's about $35
per share of AMR even after its plunge today. (AMR owns 107 million shares.)
Then back out the cash, which is $18 a share. There is another non-core
business worth $5-10 a share. So there's about $60 out of a $120 stock. Now
lets look at the airline.

American Airlines is among the leaders in its industry. It makes over $3
billion (with a B) of EBITDA + lease payments (cash flow) per year. United,
Delta and Continental trade at 5 x EBITDA + payments. So that's $15 billion.
There is 4.7 billion of debt and leases. So we'll back that out to get to
roughly $10 billion for the airline's equity. Divide by 90 million shares and
you get to a $111 per share for the airline. Now we add back the $60 of
non-airline value and you get to $171 a share. The stock trades at $120, blew
out estimates today, leads its industry, and has a great balance sheet.

Look forward to responses.

Stuart,

You are good!! You just shot my analysis of CERB to pieces. It never occured to
me to compare the earnings/revs from prior Qs. I think you were off in the
numbers and it's worse than you stated. The .46 profit last Q came from a .57
tax credit and the actual earnings were a -.11. The company had a tax liability
due to Capital Office profits. When the Capital numbers were put into
'discontinued ops' the tax liability went with it leaving the losses from INEI
= a .57 boost in earnings.

The order backlog reduction you mentioned is significant. If they had revs of
$8M with a $3M reduction in backlog, they only added $5M in new contracts.

Combine the two items you've pointed out and it really reduces the earnings
projections. All that's left is the price at 55% of BV and the cash. Rethinking
position, but will likely look for an opportunity to get out of it without
getting burnt too bad. Thanx loads!

As to the preferred - you must be referring to the B shares. These are
convertible 1:1 to A common. These shares aren't traded on the market and are
held primarily by the Eriksons. Each share has 10X the voting power of an A
share. The 200K+ shares = 2M+ voting rights to the outstanding 1.2M+ A common
rights of 1 vote = 1.2M+. This gives the power in the Eriksons with each owning
1/2 of B and if they disagree, the A shares decide. In the sale of Capital
decision, the Eriksons abstained from voting.

The non-owned interests are the float of INEI. They had on books at share value
before the Capital sale, then changed it to equity basis. I may have done this
to offset some of the capital gains due.

Really appreciate the work you put into this and for the posting. I didn't and
don't know if I would have caught the earnings discrepancy. You've given me a
new thing to look at when I research a stock. This really changed the
situation. I now have the feeling that CERB may sell INEI and dissolve netting
the $16+. One could hold on speculation like this, but not me.

Thanx again,
Ron

I think you're right. These guys should sell INEI since it doesn't make money,
take all their marbles and do something else. Looks like they did well in the

higher market share than Deere, and they have a big competitive advantage over
anybody in the developing Indian market. Their product can rival Deere across

web site, oriented to the US investor. Current as of 12/96.

http://www.newholland.com/nh/finsta.htm

Looks like PSR 0.80, Current Ratio 1.7, has 727M cash
and equivalents relative to a total market cap of
4.377B. LT debt of only 80M, but LT liabilities
up in the 600M range -- cash covers it.

Looking at the income statement, earnings and sales growing,
with improving inventory management. Love the cash flow
statement as well.

A solid, dividend-paying stock with no sell-side analyst

I like Agco very much as well. Either Agco or New Holland is a better buy than

though they compete in the same business. Agco is the consolidator of the
industry, and they have a lot of cost cutting still to come in the acquisitions
they have made in recent years. Their product is not the best in the industry,
but I think their economics may be. One thing after another has gone wrong for
Agco in the last year, and much of Wall Street hates the stock. But I think the

James,

I had a different opinion of AG management.

They've shown growth by acquiring smaller companies with cash and shares,
adding to their debt and dilution. The dilution has made the EPS lower to flat.
The heavy long term debt is a potential downside risk I didn't care for.

Unlike NH, they haven't centralized the management as well as I think they
should. Each operation seems to run independent of the others.

I deal with farmers daily. New Holland/Ford is broadly accepted, not like Deere
or Case/IHC, but much more so than all the Agro brand names. IMO- They would be
far better off if they would put forth ONE brand name for recognition and
advertising.

James/Ron:

Thanks for replies. As I am not as familiar with the industry in toto as I
should be. Most of my questions will be comparing the two companies agco and
nh. Looking at the 2nd quarter earnings statements from both companies, I see a
remarkable number of similarities. Both have good earnings growth.

I fail to see why looking at the balance sheet, one could make the story that
either is better than the other. As I am still new in this, any help would be
appreciated.

A couple of points did stick out. NH appears to be suffering from the strong
dollar (maybe not as much as agco but it is mentioned in their second quarter
report) Also, NH appears to have a huge increase (year over year) in
receivables and short term borrowings, is that a good thing ? To their credit,
earnings are up sharply. But they appear to be up at agco as well.

As I said, looking at the balance sheets of the two companies, I find it
difficult to pick one over the other. would appreciate any commentary
thanks

Agco's balance sheet is clearly one of its weaknesses, but its not as bad as it
looks when you consider the cash flow being generated. It covers interest very
comfortably. New Holland's balance sheet is probably overcapitalized. Nothing
to worry about there. You've got to spend some time learning this industry
before distinguishing these two companies. They have extremely different
cultures, histories and strategies. To grossly oversimplify, I would point to
Agco as a "higher risk, higher return" play on agriculture, and New Holland as
a safer investment.

James,

Reviewed AG and NH last night. My notes on the two date back to when I bought
the NH. I believe now that I chose NH because I was more familiar with their
products and their strategy is more defined and easier to understand. AG is
moving fast and it's difficult to understand just what they have in mind except
to acquire small agricultural manufacturing facilities in every continent - a
piece of everything. This could pay off huge if agriculture continues it's
current growth.

You were on the mark with the higher risk-higher return. Rather than pick up
more NH, I've decided to try for a similar position in AG. Owning both looks
like a fairly good strategy.

Thanks,
Ron

CEMX earnings up strong

CEM REPORTS IMPROVEMENT IN FIRST-QUARTER
EARNINGS

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 21, 1997--CEM Corporation
(Nasdaq/NM:CEMX) today announced an increase in net income for the first fiscal
quarter ended
September 30, 1997. Net income for the quarter totaled $241,000, or $0.07 per
share, compared
with $106,000, or $0.03 per share, a year ago. For the first quarter of fiscal
1998, net sales totaled
$6.6 million, unchanged from the year-earlier period.

''We are encouraged by the improvement in profitability for the first
quarter,'' remarked Michael J.
Collins, President and Chief Executive Officer. ''The first quarter was also
highlighted by the
introduction of MARS, our next generation closed-vessel digestion system with
revolutionary
capabilities. This new instrument, which is the result of an intensive two-year
development program,
was shown to customers and prospective accounts in key European, Asian and
Latin American
markets during the first quarter. In early October, the marketing campaign was
expanded to include
a series of seminars throughout the United States that is part of the most
extensive launch by the
Company for any new system. The advanced performance characteristics of MARS
have been well
received, and we are pleased with the initial interest in this instrument that
we believe will become the
new standard for microwave-based, digestion systems.''

Collins noted, ''We experienced some difficulty in achieving a year-to-year
gain in net sales for the
first quarter partly because the introduction of MARS reduced demand for our
existing digestion
systems. We believe this effect will prove temporary as shipments of MARS
should start to
contribute to our revenues, especially during the second fiscal half. In
addition, we experienced some
softness in Asia, particularly in Japan. We continue to emphasize the
importance of containing
expenses and improving operating efficiency to enhance CEM's competitive
position in the
instrument market.''

CEM manufactures microwave-based instrumentation for testing, analysis and
process control. The
Company's products are used worldwide in the general analytical laboratory
market and in many
manufacturing and processing industries, including chemical and food
processing.

Chris Pedicini: re AG and NH. I look at it differently. What is the purpose of
the investment in these ag co's? If these stocks popped out on somebody's
screen because of low pe or psr, I say that the psr's and p/book and pe
(figures for AG anyway) are not low compared to past years. The industry has
been cylical - maybe now the bet is that with China & other markets, that's no
longer true. My opinion is that there's not much room for improvement in the
ratio's, and there's some risk that the current valuations reflect a cyclical
high. From the very little I know, it seems that there is a number of strong
competitors - sort of like with auto manufacturers. I'd pass on both these co's
at current prices unless I really knew the industry. And if I had to spend the
time to really learn the industry, I wouldn't spend my time on this industry
unless I was already ancillarily involved (like being a farmer). I think the
time to buy these companies is when they are in the "losing money" part of the
cycle. JMO .... and I've been plenty wrong before (I looked at Navistar and
figured it to be in the same category-- and the stock's gone up 3x)

Leman: re CEMX. Sales are flat. And been so for years. They get now about 8-9%
ROE on a book of $7. According to Yahoo, in previous quarter(s) they've had
some warranty expenses which dragged down earnings. Now they're introducing a
new product. Hmm. I see some risk here... Based on what I see, stock is
overvalued at current $10 price IMO.

All, Re: market levels:

Take a peek at this article that DBC has been
keep up on its web site:

http://www.dbc.com/cgi-bin/htx.exe/newsroom/special/future.html?source=core/dbc

My guess: once 1987 has disappeared from the 10 year
rating systems, even more investors who shouldn't be
100% in stocks will pour their money into mutual funds,
resulting in one final climax of overvaluation.

Good Investing,
Mike

Paul,

I try to look at sectors I think will do well, then find companies in those
sectors that I think have potential. This is why I looked at agricultural
machinery. I deal with farmers on a daily basis and am certainly no expert, but
I do follow the sector closely.

Farming has changed and it's requiring new equipment. It is highly profitable
and will continue to be for many years to come. I won't go into why, just to
say that farming is now highly profitable BIG business.

The depressed farm economy of the early '80s weeded out the poorly managed
manufacturing companies. There are now four dominant companies: Deere,
Case/IHC, NH, & AG. Deere and Case have the highest recognition in the US, but
NH is gaining. In the world market, NH is equal or even better positioned. AG's
strength is in small equipment rather than the tractors, combines, etc. and
they also are well positioned in the international market. Deere and Case are
being hurt by their construction divisions. CAT is entering the ag market
because of poor construction sales and strong potential of the ag machinery
market.

You make a mistake when you refer to China as 'the' emerging market. They are
currently a major buyer of farm products, not farm equipment. The emerging
markets are Russia, the former Soviet block, and South America followed by
Africa, and Middle East (India). Each will develop as the infrastructure of the
countries develop. (doesn't do any good to grow it if you can't get it to the
market) China is future market.

I have targeted both NH and AG at least 25% above current levels in 6 months
and have added them to diversify portfolio.

For what it's worth,
Ron

Mike,

I'm not sure that the 10 year ratings will be that important,
since a huge % of today's mutual funds are less than 10 years
old anyway.

I totally agree that most stocks are overvalued, though. Do
you or anyone else know what the Price/Sales ratio of the S&P
500 is today, and where it is in historical context? The
S&P P/E is definitely high, but I think that P/S is a better
indicator with all of the financial engineering that goes on --
revenues are harder to fake than earnings.

Thanks,
Zach

From:James Clarke

Strong argument. There's the bear case on ag equipment stocks and you presented
it as well as the best Wall Street analyst after what seems to be about 10
minutes of thinking. Thats why we have this message board.

Rebuttal. The ag equipment industry is indeed cyclical, but so is the
construction equipment industry. Caterpillar trades at a 15 multiple while New
Holland and Agco trade at 10-12. Weak argument, I know. I don't totally buy the
"secular growth" argument in agriculture, which is why I would say no to Deere,
but I will present it briefly. Ag equipment is now a global industry. It wasn't
when it was cyclical (Deere was the only pure play public company and it was
almost totally U.S.) It is hard to argue with the thesis that global
agriculture is a growth industry. Populations grow. Countries prosper and want
better food. Production methods have to improve. The difference between what a
U.S. farmer and what a Chinese or Indian farmer can produce on an acre of land
is incredible. There are really only four global competitors in this industry -
Deere, Case, New Holland and Agco. That looks like an oligopoly to me.

Like I said, I don't totally buy it, but at 11x earnings on New Holland and
especially 10x earnings on Agco, you're not going to lose. I'm really thinkng
about buying Agco now. 30 has been a real support level - there are alot of us
institutional investors who will buy the hell out of it at 30. Agco, unlike the
others, is able to grow earnings at 20% for the next couple years. (Don't get
fooled by the last few quarters of New Holland. This is a 10% grower at best
that left itself a free ride for a year when it went public last November). Its
cheap, but its not as cheap as Agco.

employees and 14M in sales, and being a technology co... man I'd really want a
margin of safety (like maybe being a net-net, which it isn't) or having some
really detailed knowledge of the management or the product/service they
provide. Not sure what my investment/speculation goal would be here. Waiting
for some publicity to push the price of the small-float stock back up to yearly
highs? Might work. Might not. At least the co doesn't make farm implements -g-.
