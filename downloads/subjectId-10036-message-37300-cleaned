Ever since Walter's post, I've been sorting thru the shipping stocks and
reviewing the industry. Walter brought up a lot of good points in general about
the industry, and across the board I find a great deal of undervaluation in the
stocks. While that doesn't remove the dangers from investing in the sector, I
still find what one might deem timely plays here and there. OSG to me looks
like the highest quality in the sector, clearly undervalued on a balance sheet
examination basis, having suffered its worst year in 2009 so I ask myself, do
stocks bottom against a backdrop of bad news or good news. Do they peak against
the best news and best earnings ever? In general I agree that stocks often
bottom when the news is bleakest and the market begins to anticipate less bad
news and some improvement going forward.

While OSG is undervalued, when things improve, if they improve, the
undervaluation will shrink. This is not a recommendation to buy, although I
have a tad. For the more venturesome among us, I think FREE could be a timely
speculation. With a tangible book value of $4.62 a share, and recent PR about
short term charters at increased prices, it has potential for some percentage
gains. Below is the link where one can find the 4th qtr and 2009 full report by
navigating their site. Below that is the PR from April 1.
More interesting to me, below that is the chart where the indicators in the
lower windows look poised. Click on the actual chart when it comes up to

Anializer - the book value seems to overstate the value of their assets (ships)
on the balance sheet. I am not sure how much below stated book value FREE is -
they had 140M$ in equity (before the secondary) and 120M$ in debt, yet they
were in violation of their loan covenants by 12/31/08. those loan covenants are
based on NAV of the tankers not the book value, so clearly the banks got
worried and that forced them to do a secondary rather than getting a waiver
from the lender.

I also notice that FREE ships are rather old - >10 years - with a glut of new
ships coming to market the value of older ships could fall even more.

In order to make an investment decision we would need to be able to determine
the actual value of FREE's ship, right now we don't know if FREE trades above
NAV or not. Anybody has any number how much the value of ships has plunged?
From memory I recite about 20% for newbuilds but I have no clue about value
changes for well used ships.

It is an interesting industry, and certainly volatile compared to many others.
70% fall in value in some vessel values, and in many cases they remain above
long-term average pricing. To your points:

- I don't view many "book values" as being related to real asset values: for
example, vessels costing $150m each in 2007 are now worth just $50m in some
cases due to the huge bidding-up in the boom years. Write-downs are unlikely
until the charters fail to cover financing and opex costs
- Short-term charters expose you to spot transportation market, which while
nice if you have an interest in riding any foreseen curve are distant in my
mind from a Graham value investment
- Long-term charters are more stable, but charter counterparties have to be
stable and honest. There is anecdotal evidence of strong steel firms breaking
long-term charters that were valued far higher than the spot market. It is not
an industry full of top-notch characters that Buffett would invest in
- Be aware of orderbooks, prices at which contracted, and loan commitments
against those orders.
- Be aware of loan refinancing (lower LTV than would have been possible in boom
years)
- Cash balances can easily be eaten away by operating expenses if charters do
not materialise or management is poor

My problem with investing in them from a value perspective is that there is not
really a floor to their earnings in general, and no enduring franchise. Much
depends on forecasts that I discount entirely in my analysis.

My earlier points stand as well on the industry in general.

Good luck

Alex

DPTR - the sale is positive IF the property is sold for more than what it is
carried at on balance sheet. DPTR carries 1.1B property/plant/equipment on
their balance sheet. If they sell something at a higher price than what it's
carried at, the balance sheet improves (book value rises) and it is positive.
If not, then it's negative. So what is the carrying value of the sold ops?

It does not matter that they are selling a part of the company for more than a
market cap. These are not directly comparable numbers. Assume some company has
assets of 100B and liabilities of 99B with book value at 1B and market cap
equal to book value 1B. Then it sells half of the assets for 50B at 50 times
more than its market cap!!! :))) Should we rejoice? Is that something that
would affect book value and market cap of the company at all? ;)

re FREE - they only disclosed the problems with their covenants in the fine

balance sheet. I don't think FREE's disclosure policy is all that great.
I know this because I found it misleading then. it looks like they were able to
reduce the leverage somewhat (crisis has ebbed) and they issued 10M (approx.
50% dilution) shares at 1.13$. I know this because I found it remarkable that
they had to do this despite a seemingly decent looking balance sheet even
before the capital raise. I believe the reason why the bankers are so anxious
is because the value of FREE's ships (which were purchased in boom years,
except one ship that was purchased in 2009) and are still on the balance sheet
at inflated values.

Spek,

You think a form filed in 2008 supersedes the year end 2009 report?

I'll agree the Co. has issues, but major issues look resolved for now, and each
short term charter has been taking full advantage of higher day rates in spot
charter market.

If tangible book is stated at $4.62, how much overstatement on the value of
ships would you say is appropriate. As long as they are employed and bringing
in money, they must be worth something and the stock already sells at a 70%
discount to stated book. That equates to 30 cents on a dollar worth of ship
value. Should they be valued at 20 cents, 10 cents? I have no idea.

I have to remember we are talking about a speculation here, not a blue chip.
And we're not talking about some long term holding, but rather a trade. So I'm
thinking worthy spec. and took some. It may not pan out, but at these prices,
I'm willing to take a stab that large volume upside days could drive this into
a decent percentage trade. Small caps and microcaps appear the place to be, and
you know how it goes when they get hot, value or not.

A bunch of traders ganging up on a stock like this could move it and usually a

Marcellus Shale Land Deal

UPDATE 2-Reliance to pay Atlas $1.7 bln for Marcellus JV
Fri Apr 9, 2010 9:08am EDT

* Reliance to pick up 40 pct in Atlas Energy's acreage
http://www.reuters.com/article/idAFSGE6380G220100409?rpc=44
From the article:"... India's largest-listed firm will pick up a 40 percent
stake in Atlas's operations in the booming Marcellus Shale -- a gas project
that spans parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New York in the United
States and which, according to some geologists, could hold enough natural gas
to satisfy U.S. demand for a decade.

Atlas's core Marcellus position consists of about 300,000 acres, largely in
southwestern Pennsylvania, out of which about 120,000 acres will go to
Reliance, the companies said...."

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The deal provides 120,000 acres in the Marcellus shale region to go to
Reliance. That's $14,167 per acre.

The MDU story you posted had MDU acquiring 40,000 acres in the Bakken region.
Based on the price Reliance paid, the value of MDU's acreage could be worth as
much as $566.7 million.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/MDU-Resources-Subsidiary-bw-3896338388.html?x=0&.
=1
The Bakken lease purchase includes approximately 40,000 net acres with the
Three Forks play as the primary target. The acquired leases have three to five
year primary terms and increase the company’s acreage position in the Bakken to
approximately 56,000 net acres. In the Niobrara oil shale play, the company has
signed an agreement to acquire approximately 27,000 net acres with five-year
primary lease terms.

I am not too sure if the two regions (Bakken vs Marcellus) have similar
production profiles but the market seems to be bidding up all shale acreage
leases.

Any idea what MDU paid per acre for their Bakken share acreage?

Yes, I see you are correct. Although it may be an unusual situation (in my

equivalent of its market price, with only that fact alone when you look at the
numbers "It does not matter that they are selling a part of the company for
more than a market cap." Thanks for pointing that out.
To make a buy decision primarily on this situation (partial asset sale ~=
market cap) which in fact has been the reason to attract me to the stock -- is
wrong.

DPTR has several e&p properties that interest me. I don't know what DPTR debt
covenants are. (The sale may require them to pay down some debt.) One way or
another though, the sale will enable the company to spend substantial cash for
developing the properties under its control. That should be a benefit to the
stockholders, if those to-be-developed properties produce satisfactorily.

Maybe irony. Spek knows my requirements for a value investment that merits

not disagreements of a personal nature. It's always cordial discussion and
opinions I respect. That's why I bounce ideas off the board.

My requirements for a value stock are simple. If it sells below tangible book
value on a balance sheet basis and they make money or have some reasonable
prospect to have positive earnings in the near future, it merits a further look
and a decision. It is not a comprehensive value investment strategy. There are
many other forms of value one can recognize. I have much more in high growth,
hi pe stocks than I do in value stocks and don't have the time to be a strict
rigid value investor. I rarely mention the high growth hi PE stocks on this
board because they sell at 3X to 10X book - on this board.

Sorry for the rant. I just don't want anyone to misinterpret my dialog with
Spek. I'm fairly confident that the stock price of FREE is going higher and

RE: Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC)

Jacobs Engineering shares rise on takeover chatter
2:38 pm ET 04/09/2010 - Reuters

BANGALORE, April 9 (Reuters) - Shares of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc <JEC.N>
rose as much as 9 percent, and options activity surged, on speculation that the
construction services firm is the target of a private equity takeover bid.

Call option activity was brisk on Jacobs Engineering "after a CNBC commentator
mentions the company as a private equity takeout play, rehashing previous
speculation in the name," said WhatsTrading.com option strategist Frederic
Ruffy.

During the afternoon session, overall option activity in Jacobs was 19 times
the normal volume with about 26,000 calls traded, more than twice the number of
puts, according to option analytics firm Trade Alert.

A statement from the New York Stock Exchange said it contacted Jacobs
Engineering on the market activity and the company responded by saying that its
policy was not to comment on unusual market activity and rumors.

Shares of the company rose as much as 9 percent to $48.27 Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange. They later pared some of their gains to trade up 7 percent
at $47.20.

===============================================================

Your post of 12/3/2009 suggested JEC as a undervalued construction company.

Anializer - thanks for your kind words. Be assured there is no personal
animosity. I think FREE is a potential winner here, but I am not sure about the
margin of safety. I am pretty sure that the tangible book value is higher than
the NAV but i don't know how much. management disclosures don't give me a warm
fuzzy feeling either.

We discussed OCNF and FREE at the same time last year and OCNF has not done too
well - too much dilution close to the bottom. FREE is better but I am not sure
how much. The shipping companies overall have not done too well, I think most
of the equity prices are correlated to the intrinsic NAV of their fleet and
that NAV has not done much.

Why is the NAV so important? Well those companies don't really have any moat,
ships are plentiful, as there is a glut coming to the market, based on newbuild
orders placed a couple of years ago.

The shipping sector is volatile and good money can be made here based on what
happened a couple of years ago. I was trying to get more information regarding
NAV of ships and was unsuccessful although a more ambitious investor may be
able to find the answer - i just don't know with the limited time I have.

From a 1st order principle perspective I expect the value of ships to be a more
or less linear function of a) age and b) tonnage (assuming ships are a
commodity and more or less the same), so one should be able to build a
correlation chart and estimate the value of a ship fleet with a decent margin
or error. problem is, I can't really find decent transaction values to do this
correlation, but I am sure someone smart has done this and knows what these
companies are worth in terms of tanker fleet NAV. Frustrating. if someone can
find a source regarding recent transaction values that list age and tonnage, i
would appreciate it.

Let me take a stab at relative NAV valuation:

GNK:2000M$ in asset book value for 2900 DWT fleet 9).68M$/DWT) ,average age: 7
years

FREE: 270M$ asset value for 225 DWT fleet (1.2M$/DWT) ,weighted Age: 15 years

FREE ships are much smaller than GNK, so they should trade at a premium to GNK
on a $/DWT ratio price. however on the other hand, GNK ships age is only 1/2
that of FREE's fleet, which should make GNK's ships more valuable on a $/DWT
ratio basis.

Ok,that is just a lazy mans analysis of two fleets. both fleets have different
characteristics but still, it seems to me that based on the data I am seeing
that GNK looks better - they do have the better operating earnings too and
despite their seemingly higher leverage based on stated book, less trouble with
their lenders. My 10 min conclusion would be to prefer GNK over FREE. I would
very much welcome other opinions or other ways co tackle the valuation angle.

FREE looks interesting. I'm not too pleased with P&L nor the cashflow, but
here's a few views of the balance sheet:

Key items:

22 current assets

4 other LT assets
297 assets
11 A/P
15 current portion bankloans
30 current liabilities
123 LTD bank loans
153 liabilities
144 equity

Now suppose 25% unbooked impairment on fixed assets:
203 fixed assets
229 assets
153 liabilities
86 equity

Or suppose 50% unbooked impairment on fixed assets:
136 fixed assets
162 assets
153 liabilities
9 equity

I see 31.2M wtd avg # shares for 4Q2009. I haven't found total shares anywhere.

Assuming the 25% impairment is close, and the 31.2M shares is about right, at a
price of 1.42 this looks like a nice margin of safety with P/BV of about 50%.

Are vessel values available based on size and age to verify what impairment
rate is appropriate?

I've not taken a position so far.

Not to worry - I am here for the debate and discussion, and to learn more about
value investing myself!

On shipping, let me play our some scenarios for you as to why I think it is
dangerous, in addition to the comments I left on the shipping board and my
earlier elaborations:

- Drybulk fleet is c.450m DWT, with an additional c.250mDWT on order, c.100mDWT
of which is due for delivery this year and the remainder before 2014.
- Pre-2008, 25mDWT was the most deliveries in any one year
- 2009 resulted in c.50mDWT of deliveries
- Excepting a spike in 2004 as China enters the fray, max growth in ton mile
demand was c.7% p.a.: vessel deliveries far exceed this growth, and scrapping
of old vessels would have to far exceed all historical precedents to re-align
supply and demand
- Oh, and the largest fleets are the youngest as well, which is not going to be
conducive to pushing owners to scrap those nice young vessels

So, even with strong growth and halving of deliveries as compared to orders,
the fleet supply and demand is heading towards being well out-of-kilter by
year-end and into 2011-12 as well.

- Vessel values today remain above historical long-run averages, including
inflation. Most public companies have yet to write-down fleets if they are
still earning on long-term charters or at least covering operating and finance
expenses.

I would not even look at price-to-book, historical dividend records or past
earnings record in this industry, as they don't provide any margin of safety or
guide to future.

That is before any thought of refinancing, covering balloon debt payments,
covering newbuilding finance commitments (if any), two-pocket situations,
dilution etc.

I don't buy the China arguments for taking all this new demand - the ports
don't exist, and the internal demand doesn't exist that can permit demand
growth of 20%pa to absorb this new capacity.

What do you think of my reasoning?

Best regards,

Alex

Think of it this way:

A 5yr old Cape vessel has fallen in value from $150m to $50m

FREE:

$274m fixed assets = $90m today at the extreme (before we get the newbuilding
orderbook delivered in full across the industry)
Debt = $138.5m
Commitments on newbuildings: unknown

Net Current Assets = -13

And, shareholders have been diluted this year (was it a capital raise or a sale
of treasury shares, and where has the cash gone?)

All in all, a very bad balance sheet.

Earnings:

Dire. I don't know if they are on spot charters or not, but it is generating
only $500k of earnings p.a., with rates heading down if supply continues to
exceed demand.

Cashflow has turned negative as well, which is crucial for the debt position.

Now...if it had no debt, and I was holding for 3 years, and the management was
kosher, I might agree with you on it being a value investment.

Walter - great analysis. I agree with your conclusions and the impact of future
deliveries that has yet to peak. One argument however that some shipowners make
is that deliveries of ships will be delayed or cancelled. The problem is that I
have not seen many cancellations (presumably because of the penalties), so i am
guessing that everybody hopes that the other guy cancels his orders.

As for anializers point , the different size of GNK and FREE does not matter
since I normalized to the $/DWTr ratio. i also clearly stated I look at the
$/DWT ratio noted in the book and I still believe ,even adjusting for the
different size of ships, FREE does not look good in that regard.

If one were to look at valuation only the right unit to look at would be
$(Enterprise Value)/DWT.

FWIW, I checked EXM and GNK and they both seem to have their ships on the book
for 0.69M$/DWT, so i think there is some validity to my approach.

FREE part of the issue in just discounting total fixed assets is that some were
bought at the lower prices. If I take their recent handysize add at 11M, and I
make some rough estimates of current value of each ship based on age and

Many thanks

I think your method of $/dwt has some validity given the obscurity over the
fleet valuation, particularly given the limited public market information that
they have disclosed - my caution would be that, while looking at comparables is
valid, many are in the same position financially and psychologically, having
floated in the bull market.

I don't know what the "floor" $/dwt is historically, but if you were to find
that, coupled with low debt, I might be interested in that particular stock. I
seriously doubt there are any though.

The true value play was in shorting them in 2008 at the peak - I wish I had
been educated enough about value investing at that time, but I am later to this
game unfortunately.

Regarding deliveries - they may be able to delay or cancel, but at what cost?
With commitments signed, the builder in China and the main customers in China,
you risk being blackballed from the country with your main customers in it if
you don't keep your promises to commit to the new vessels. That play is the
option of the shipyard, but not the owners in my opinion, so I discount it.

Too much to hope for and too little margin of safety in my book.

Your reasoning sounds logical to me, but the stock market is not always
logical. Quite often its the reverse.

You seem to be forecasting a picture here that even with strong growth and
halving of deliveries as compared to orders, the fleet supply and demand is
heading towards being well out-of-kilter by year-end and into 2011-12 as well.

2011 year end and year 2012 are a long way off and handysize short term charter
rates are going up now.

There is no way I'm going throw cold water on your analysis, about year end
2011 and year 2012. But my experience has been that most analysts have trouble
predicting exactly what conditions will be 2 -3 years out. It's too easy to
extrapolate a scenario into the future that far based on a current set of
fundamentals from the past which was one of the worst years in the shipping
industry for many carriers. In 2000, analysts were extrapolating infinite
growth of internet 2 years out and it didn't work. The majority thinks the
shipping industry will be a clunker 2 years out. I wouldn't be too rigid in
sticking to your pre-ordained scenario and avoiding a sector completely should
the market start contradicting that scenario soon.

So all I can say is that we know certain carriers are in better balance sheet
shape than others and its a stock pickers market.

You're right - the stock market is totally illogical, hence my attraction to
investing from a value perspective where I don't have to forecast the future as
far as possible.

What I am trying to do is to gain a feel for where the downside would lie, and
hence where the floor might be, and what a margin of safety would look like in
this industry - I do have some criteria that I previously mentioned would cause
me to invest in a stock in the sector, but I don't see any businesses with
those characteristics available to me.

If there were, and I could invest with no regard as to the forecasts, sleep
soundly, and not have to hope for many moving parts to go well to get my money
back, I would be investing in that business.

My scenarios were intended to demonstrate that there is an illusory margin of
safety in buying these stocks at a low P/E, and awaiting a re-rating upwards.
On the contrary, I don't see a trigger for such a re-rating given the
supply/demand imbalances involved.

Handysize rates, in fact all rates, will move in a volatile manner as demand to
move particular shipments will depend upon how many suitable vessels are in the
area of a particular port at a particular time; I ignore those rates as they
have little bearing in my opinion on the investment characteristics of the
market.

As Graham wrote "the speculator's interest lies in anticipating and profiting
from market fluctuations; the investor's interest lies in acquiring and holding
suitable securities at suitable prices"

I just can't view many shipping stocks as either suitable securities or
suitable prices at present.

All in, an interesting discussion though!

Alex

The most enlightening thing I learned from this is to look at leverage adjusted

or EV/EBITDA is. I look at these metrics often when looking at a particular

The author has not summarized the Ben Graham interview right.

I just have to go through my little library to find my lost journal issue, the
one with that original article. It's a significant reference for me since it
has formed the basis of most of my investing in the past many years. It's
important because in the article Dr. Graham essentially dismisses the relevance
of security analysis (as practiced by him post depression era) for the
individual investor.

In essence, following Dr. Graham's latest research at that time of the article,
it is less of a reliance on individual security analysis and more emphasis on
sticking to "one or more" criteria with a sufficient number of diverse stocks.
This to concentrate (my words) on portfolio results rather than individual
securities themselves.

The criteria Dr. Graham suggested - but he specifically did not say these
exclusively were the only ones - were, as I interpret the interview, p/e at 7
or below and/or dividend yield (7%), and/or p/bv under 1.2. Also, the time
holding he suggested could be 2 or 3 years (not just the two years which he
suggested earlier for net-net situations).

The problem with Graham is that he has proposed a lot of different formulas. In
a single edition of "Intelligent Investor" he has at least three different
criteria sets for stock purchasing. And it is even worse if one goes across
multiple editions of "Intelligent Investor" and "Security Analysis".

Now we are supposed to believe that in 1976 he had an Eureka moment and decided
that one year PE < 10 + PE < inverted 2x AAA bond yield and D/E < 1 is enough.
I'd say "no way" although I am sure Graham qualified the above with his
customary: buy stocks only in established companies with a history of positive
earnings and so on. I am not sure even with additional caveat that these
criteria are good. IMHO, in normal market (March 2009 does not count :))),
there will be very few companies satisfying Graham's criteria. Furthermore,
most of them will be on the verge of earnings decline that market would assume
to be terminal.

But, please suggest a list of companies currently satisfying the criteria and
let's look at them. :)

P.S. Although <1 D/E already pretty much precludes financials, let's remember
that Graham always excluded them into a separate category too. So please no
banks, BDCs, insurance, MLPs, companies with finance subsidiaries, REITs and
other exotics. :)

Hi Paul -

Would this imply that Graham's portfolio turnover rate was 24-36 months?

The only thing that may be a bit different this time is more company's have
more cash on their balance sheet. Some company's have even deleveraged their
debt by raising more equity (through secondary stock offerings) As a result
more companies will have more free cash than normal which could be used to (a)
repurchase stock, (b) increase dividends or (c) even pay down debt.

For this recovery cycle, I expect to see more companies announce dividend
increases even as the Fed increases rates to more normal levels. This might
raise investors earnings expectations (especially if payout ratios don't
increase much) and as a result individual company PE's should expand.

Graham's strict sell criteria might extend into a three year holding period
(rather than the 2 years stated in the article) as long as the reported
company's financial condition remains strong (w/ twice as many assets than
debts).

I just did not realize that Graham had a rule to take profits when a 50% gain
was reached even though the other value financial criteria was met.

The financial crash experienced in 2008, stock "values" got so out of line with
market prices that IMO selling out the entire position once a 50% gain was
achieved would have resulted in selling way too early. In some cases leaving
another 50% on the table.

I certainly follow Graham when screening and buying "value" opportunities but
follow a Warren Buffet style when selling (if the company continues to grow and
is still earning money and priced w/ a PE to its peers - continue to hold).

EKS, his 50% rule was for net-nets only, afaik.

One thing about Dr. Graham was that he seemed to me from my reading to be
pretty reasonable and practical as regards his rules. I don't believe he had a
hard stop sell point at 50% gains. I'd assume he'd use some balance: if the
stock still continued to meet his criterion/criteria (e.g. p/e and/or p/bk), I
assume he'd still hold. Otoh, maybe (just maybe) because his last methods were
kind of like screening and not doing all the in-depth security analysis he
formerly did, maybe he'd opine that it would be wise to be taking some profits
surely after a double, and finding another candidate as a replacement. (Or
selling to conform to his idea of selling stocks when prices are high and
shifting to a higher bond percentage.) The net result I guess would be that the
portfolio value turnover could be 2-3 years.

I'm not looking at my notes now. I recall reading that somebody, maybe W.
Buffett, related this story: That although Dr. Graham did well or well-enough
with his methods, he really made his "big" money with Geico. Somehow Dr Graham
and Mr. Buffett acquired a large position in the stock when it was a value
investment. Dr Graham became publicly associated with the company further as a
major stockholder and as a director of the company as well (edit: if I remember
the story correctly). The result was that as Geico's fortunes improved and the
stock rose and rose and rose, Dr. Graham confided he would have liked to but
could not, sell his position. His relationship with the company and/or his
involvement with Mr. Buffett kept him from doing so.

So his big win (Geico) was made almost in spite of himself---through a
'self-forced' buy-and-hold, not a buy and sell at 50% gain, or at a double or
quadruple or fair value.
--------------------
--------------------
For my net-nets, I use a three year holding period to see if they'll work out.
And for other kinds of stocks that don't seem to do anything and where the
business doesn't seem to be doing anything either (i.e. value traps), I also
try for a three-year hold. I generally would have more $ in each stock in this
latter category, so I get antsy after a couple of years, and it's harder for me
to hold. What do you guys do?

From my experience, I generally perform a much broader stock screen and then
pick through the balance sheet to try to find hidden or under valued assets.
For example, real estate is carried on the books at cost not market value.
Companies with large real estate holdings acquired many years ago will
typically have an understated BV.

I did discover that Graham had some basic rules for selling which I never was
aware of. I guess if one had to have a "Magic Formula" for a value investment,
Graham's definition seems to fit. However, they don't come available that
often.

You seem to me to be making two points:

1. Dr. Graham has several rules, and he's changed them with time.

2. Very few, if any, stocks meet his requirements now.

There seem to be four requirements: low pe, low p/k, low d/e, "good" history.
We're also talking about his last 1976 interviews wherein he says <u>one</u> or
a couple or a few metrics might be enough. I don't know of any source where
he's said in his last interviews that all four of the metrics are required.
Especially not anything about a good, long history. Which was so for 1973's
Intelligent Investor (five years and no deficit), but not in his last
interviews, afaik. (That requirement for the good history might be there, I
just don't see such in the notes that I have about those later interviews.)

It would seem that if we are in the current situation of very very few or no
qualifying stocks, then no stocks should or would be bought by Graham people.
But that leaves a conundrum. If somebody were investing through an IRA or
otherwise had money to invest now and were following Dr. Graham, what about his
teaching (requirement?) that investments should be made by categorical
balancing of stocks and bonds. But if there are no stocks to be bought how can
balancing be done? And if there are only a few stocks that meet requirements
and they are all what Dr. Graham would characterize at 2nd Tier, isn't
allocating money to just a few 2nd tiers overly risky?

My opinion is that Dr. Graham would loosen up or maybe eliminate one of more of
the 3-4 screening metrics. I'm fairly sure he'd loosen up the debt requirement,
but keep a lid on p/e though (which seems to me to have been his favorite
metric).

You may be right about loosening of the requirements. Personally, I keep "good"
business requirement and loosen P/B and P/E, i.e. go for Buffett approach. And
try to remember Graham's quote: "The risk of paying too high price for
good-quality stocks is not the chief hazard... Chief losses ... come from
purchase of low quality securities at times of favorable business conditions"
People fast forget what happened when they bought crappy stocks at <10 P/E with
high D/E in 2007-2008.

I'm pretty positive that he would change the requirements.

You had to be there and be a Graham-type person at the time.

As I saw and see it, he had two interwoven objectives:

1. What are the best measures for the defensive and enterprising investors to
use? "Best" in the sense of measures that screen purchase of stocks which might
appreciate because they're undervalued, and yet that might also provide some
sort of margin of safety. If a portfolio, say about 30 stocks were to be
selected in a balance among stocks and bonds.

2. Given that I (Dr. Graham)want to provide a facile way for the average Joe
investor to use some sort of screening mechanism to buy stocks, then from among
the "best" measures that I know, what and how do I deselect to come up with
measures that ARE available to the average investor, that he can screen for?
It's not realistic here in 1976 that the average guy is going to send away to
get and wade through piles of annual reports or buy SEC filings.

So, what this comes down to is this: Back in the day, we average Joe's got our
S&P monthly stock guide (It was affordable at maybe $75-100/yr for a
subscription) with the thousand or more companies listed alphabetically and by
exchange - about 26 companies per page, all with just the same few metrics, and
we just quickly started looking at each stock's metrics - current assets, total
debt, p/e, five year history, etc. -- and we screened and made the simple
calculations and decisions to find stocks that dropped into Dr. Graham's box.

Now, with the internet, very possible I'd say, that Dr. Graham would perhaps
move much closer to you, Spekulatius, and others who use enterprise
value/ebitda or other "sophisticated" and/or "better" screening tools that are
so readily available in 2010 to the average investor. All those metrics Dr.
Graham would be back-testing so as to come up with his latest requirements for
the defensive and enterprising investors.

----
Edit. After writing, and considering further, maybe I have it backwards all
these years. I'm assuming Dr. Graham used S&P Guide numbers as a very important
factor for the metrics he was recommending, and that what he provided
additionally was the numerical number, i.e p/e was there, and Dr. Graham said,
okay, no more than 7x; 5-year history was there, so Dr. Graham said, okay, no
deficit in those last five years.
Possible though that I have it somewhat backwards: Perhaps S&P saw a bus.
opportunity and said, Dr. G. likes p/e and five year history, etc., we'll just
issue a stock guide that has only those metrics he likes.

From:Walter Bagehot
I think you are right to some extent; however, I expect his thinking would have
evolved to placing value on inherent growth in defensive and strong investments
(eg. Buffet's moat) rather than loosening his analytical criteria to instead
focus on EV/EBITDA or new metrics.

The real change has, in my opinion, been that in losing the gold standard since
his experiences, the world faces inflationary boom and busts rather than
deflationary recessions. Thus, your thinking has to be modified to considering
assets (tangible and intangible) that are always going to be repriced upwards
to some extent, leaving the accounting behind if it is simple based upon
historic cost.

I don't agree that simply as the world has (seemingly) become even more
speculative, and capital structures more debt-laden and complex, that it would
cause him to now look at EBITDA as a metric - the debt remains a risk to the
equity investor and the capex still has to be financed to create long-term
value.

Instead, I would expect him to consider whether companies with strong
franchises are likely to be able to take a higher debt load, as their inherent
value in expanding the franchise (eg Coke, GEICO et al) deliver a different
margin of safety.

Problem with taking the view that he loosens his rules is that you lose the
essential principles of being a value investor, and find yourself justifying
ever higher prices just as the crowd are doing so.

Although I have at times thought we are entering a double-dip recession, I
don't really take a view on that in my investments; it is the protection that I
seek for the long-term. With the double-dip now potentially averted, and
inflation instead forthcoming, I haven't changed my perception that I should be
invested in strong-franchises. Inherently, their value should move with
inflation so I don't have to worry, and likewise it will endure through a
secondary dip if that occurs.

A bull market is just an upside to that, but I don't want to chase it or
speculate.

Would you consider that a sensible approach for the new paradigm?

Hi Paul - Your memory on Graham's Geico investment is correct.

Top Five All-Time Best Mutual Fund Managers
http://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/08/top-mutual-fund-managers.asp

From the article:"...Best Investment: GEICO (NYSE:BRK.A) - It spun-off to
Graham-Newman shareholders at $27 per share and rose to the equivalent of
$54,000 per share. Oddly, the GEICO purchase became his most successful
investment, although it didn't fit into his deep discount strategy very well.
Most of Graham's positions were sold in less than two years, but he held GEICO
stock for decades. His main investments were numerous low-risk arbitrage
situations...."

Here are the Top Five All-Time Best Money Managers according to the article.

Benjamin Graham
Estimated Return: Reports vary due to the time period in question as well as
the calculation methods used, but John Train reported in "The Money Masters"
(2000) that Graham's fund, the Graham-Newman Corporation, earned 21% annually
over 20 years. "If one invested $10,000 in 1936, one received an average of
$2,100 a year for the next 20 years, and recovered one's original $10,000 at
the end."

Sir John Templeton
Estimated Return: He managed the Templeton Growth Fund from 1954 to 1987. Each
$10,000 invested in the Class A shares in 1954 would have grown to more than $2
million by 1992 (when he sold the company) with dividends reinvested, or an
annualized return of about 14.5%.

T. Rowe Price, Jr.
His first fund was started in 1950 and had the best 10-year performance of the
decade - approximately 500%.

John Neff
Results: John Neff ran the Windsor Fund for 31 years ending in 1995 and earned
a return of 13.7%, versus 10.6% for the S&P 500 over that time span. This
amounts to a gain of more than 55 times an initial investment made in in 1964.

Peter Lynch
Results: Lynch is widely quote as saying that a $1,000 in Magellan on May 31,
1977, it would have been worth $28,000 on by 1990.

Walter Bagehot. Seems reasonable. Dr. Graham, if he were still around, would --
like every other investor--, be influenced by Buffett's success, writings,
wisdom.

I'm not one to use Ev or Ebitda. I mentioned it because at least a few people
here like it or use it, and so do several published value investors. I like
roe. An issue though with just looking at roe by itself is that returns can be
skewed or pumped by the company having or taking on more debt. Someone just
using roe by itself as a value metric doesn't capture that. Whereas it is taken
account of if someone uses Ev.

Update on GRVY - Looks like this company reports primarily through the SEC
these days. Another report came out a few days ago.

I did an off-the-cuff breakdown based on today's exchange rates (I did this
quickly, so sorry if there are errors) and I get:

2009 Results:

Cash per Share = $2.06
Current Assets per Share = $2.40
Total Liabilities per Share = $0.58
Book Value per Share = $2.66
Earnings per share = $0.10 in 2009 vs $0.03 in 2008

Current price per share is ~$2.

I still like the valuation here. A good amount of cash per share and a solid
earnings rise as well as seeming stability of earnings in tough years. New
products coming out this year. Decent growth potential with a good value
backstop.

But, from a price target standpoint, I don't know. I actually had an overweight
position and sold some of my $1.55 shares at $2 recently to get to a more
reasonable position. Maybe I'd sell another chunk at $2.50 if it made it there
this year? I think this stock would be fairly valued somewhere above $3.

I look at EV/EBITDA to compare companies with similar business and compare

there is an endless discussion if intangibles should be included or not. I
think they should be (in most cases).

Also earnings before interest is one of the hardest metrics to fake and
earnings is one of the easiest. If EBITDA values are false, the whole balance

I prefer to use stated book value for ROE. I find it doesn't make much
difference in most cases if I am comparing a company to itself over a span of
many years, or if I compare the average (over many years) ROE performance of
one company to the average ROE of another company. Agree with you, that many
people have a definite preference for tangible book value (tangible roe) over
stated. After all, tangible is tangible. I try to be pretty careful in
reporting roe on specific stocks to always specify if it's tangible or stated
bv that I am using.

Worked for a large multinational for many years. Top and division managers
didn't find it too difficult to fudge and fake. (And fool me and other
thousands of underlings.) Ebitda or not. Seems, in retrospect, pretty easy when
you start with sales that don't exist or aren't really sales, and begin
dropping these revenue numbers down to get ebitda or net income. It took
somebody -- whistle-blower I believe -- to finally put an end to it. My point
is that I believe it'd be imputing a false sense of security to believe using
ebitda offers the investor any insurance or protection or warning of fraud.
Perhaps though I'm wrong about this. Anyway, jmo.

Regarding the remainder of companies you found:

NTII - has lost money for most of its life. I don't think it's a Graham buy
APT - I think it is a Graham buy unless there are some skeletons somewhere. I
won't buy it, since it has too low ROE and margins for me.
YTEC - too short history for Graham criteria.

Paul, sounds like you worked for Worldcom <ng>

you start with sales that don't exist or aren't really sales, and begin

The case that you are describing is full fledged accounting fraud. I agree
there is very little defense against that because once management fudges
topline numbers, everything else is fair game. That however is much harder (and
much more likely to be persecuted) then just fudging some depreciation rates
for equipment or accruals for work yet to be completed etc. the latter would
change income much more so than EBITDA.

Just remember our discussion of NWPX with their low depreciating rates for
equipment.

Any idea what a good entry level might be? I am looking to start a new

used to reduce 6 1/8% LT debt. Stock current yields 7.6% as long as the

the alternative is like buying any other stock that goes down, You lose money.
You cannot assume that every stock that goes down will once again rebound so
every time you make a stock purchase you have a chance to lose money. Is that
what you meant? With every purchase you weigh the good with the bad and make a
decision.

Hi MCsweet - If it goes like the secondary for GOV, the best entry point was
right after the offering. GOV is up 17% from that low. I will be watching the
tape Thursday to see how fast the 24 million shares are gobbled up. Lately
these secondary offerings are oversubscribed. I plan to buy some shares for the
IRA and the taxable account. Just a small buy as these are new starter

I see Cramer people strongly recommending CSCO as a buy.

Margins, roe have slipped in past year. Maybe bullish view is that they will
come back, given CSCO's market presence, breadth of product offerings, cash
position for acquisitions, etc., and the improving economy where companies' IT
groups make more purchases.

Otoh, maybe Cramer hype is the signal to consider standing aside.

I've sold 1/3 of my CSCO position today.

Also exited TXN, fwiw.

I'm not aware of any tech stocks that I could recommend as being value buys at
this time. (Edit: Tech stocks as most people view "tech"--- I'm excluding from
my comments here those dink cigar-butts that may or may not be viable
businesses that are in the tech sector and that have or had a stock price below
net cash per share.) I do have a small package of some tech stocks I've held
for several years. MSFT being one, for example. Also fwiw, as you, I hold GNW,
which I'm glad to see has come back from lows (where I shoulda/coulda/dint buy
more).

In January, I added to my GOOG position at $598/sh.
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26238933&srchtxt=goog
It seems like every year of the past several I model GOOG to have a fair value
of over $700/sh., and it never gets there. I'm still saying maybe $740 might be
fair value at end 2011, if margins hold up. However, with speed of technology,
companies entering each other's space, and either my model's continuing failure
here or GOOG's failing my model, I'd not recommend GOOG to anyone now, other
than as a speculation.

I closed my position in dink electronics distributor NUHC today. It's an
electronic distributor stock that met my criterion for a buy that did not work
out for me. Held stock for my limit (about 3 years) and finally, it just seemed
to be a value trap when they recently lost a key customer.

As speculations, I've made these two recent buys of these microcaps: SIO.v, my
play on 3D tv/movies; and ZSTN, a small Chinese company that I like for its
current roe and low p/e. Gambling money only.

ABT. Have kept reducing my position, and now it's a stub. Company has good
business history, good dividend history, and forward p/e (per Yahoo) for ABT is
unusually low at about 11.

Otoh, the stock hasn't done much in the past ten years to break out of a
trading range:

Its humira drug accounts for $8m of ABT's $30M in rev. And the humira patent is

gfre ended up +12% on the day. They seem pretty conservative so i think if they

will be about 50% ahead of last years numbers. Certainly see $18-20 doable as a
year end share price. I continue to hold an oversize position here. I am in a
mostly watch mode now as far as my portfolio goes. I like all my oversize
positions and selling for short term capital gains doesnt seem efficient in a
taxable account. Since ive achieved pretty much what I shoot for in a year as

Following Mike Burry's rule (or Jesse Livermore's) to sell on new lows? I sort
of agree with you that HQS looks suspicious in terms of doctoring <g> their
balance sheet but that is true for many Chinese microcaps. I also suspect the
complex legal construct of an assetless (in the US) holding company and several
holding companies in between may facilitate fraud. that concern is not specific
to HQS (I don't even now tie legal construct.

I am going to dig a little bit in their SEC statements once I have same spare

Some concern that they are paying down 6.125% debt w/ new shares paying an 8.2%

According to Yahoo BV is $8.35/share, Their Web site should answer your other

The secondary prospectus also lists the properties they plan to purchase with
