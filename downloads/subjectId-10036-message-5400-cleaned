Public Storage (PSA)

PSA looks good to me, also. I like the facts that (1) it
is the dominant player in self-storage, (2) with its strong
financial position and cash flows it is not subject to the
whims of the capital markets for fueling future growth, and
(3) storage does not seem to me to be as cyclical as other
types of real estate investments.

The fact that PSA announced it was buying back stock (altho.
I don't whether it will follow through given the Storage Trust
merger) was also encouraging.

PFINA picked by Al Frank's Prudent Speculator as "stock of month" in 12/2/98
issue.

according to report ".5x sales; 1.15x book; 8X current earnings" They just
closed on immediately accretive acquisition of Green Mfg which adds over 20% to
historical revenue stream. Currently at $9.share, their 3-5 yr target $18. 3.3
mm shares outstanding. 9/30 debt was used to close on green acquisition the
last week of september so enterprise value vs trailing numbers is not apples to

and the stock ($9) sells above book value. (Maybe I just already own too many

Paul re: PFINA. It sounds as if you measure companies equally by their employee
number as ROE. This biases you to large cap names that may or may not have
crummy ROA. ROE can be manipulated by capital structure. P & F Industries is a
company with substantial ownership by management that has consistently grown
continuing op income for over 6 years through internal growth and now nicely
accretive acquisition of decent relative size (which btw increases employee
count). While no longer below book it is at very low multiple of cash flow and
earning thus book wont be long below price if this holds. catalyst is that
there is no coverage on this thing and they have recently retained IR firm and
are visiting with buy/sell side once month to gain more proper exposure and
expanded multiple on obviously growing business.

Re: SWR. Yeah, now I see it too. Dirty, rotten crooks -g-. But of course, they

the whole company is $9.50-- a 39% premium to the current price. Not a fair

My favorite story (per CNBC) today though, would be the St. John's Knits buyout

A few comments on Public Storage (PSA)...

Hello everyone! I have enjoyed being a lurker on this thread for a while now
and feel that it is time to contribute something!

Public Storage was originally a series of Limited Partnerships that started in
the 1970's. I understand that they were actually a play on Southern California
land. The storage facilities were just something to do until land prices went
up! But the storage facilities were so profitable that the original purpose of
the partnerships was forgotten.

I have bought several of these partnerships in the secondary market, and am not
impressed with the management. At least as far as the LPs are concerned, they
are definitly looking out for themselves, not the limited partners. For
example, they sell storage related materials (boxes, tape, locks, etc.) from
the facility, but the profits go to a separate company (I believe a privately
owned company of the general parnters) not the partnership. Management takes
the attitude that the desirability of the facility is enhanced by the
availability of these materials, and they do not share any of the profits.

PSA is gradually buying the partnerships up, generally at values below their
real value. They send out a new tender offer every year or two, gradually
increasing the price, until they have a majority of the shares, and then
dictate a buyout price to the remainder of the limited partners. I guess this
is good for the stockholders, but sucks for the limited partners who should get
a better deal. I should not complain, I have received 20-40% annualized returns
on my public storage partnerships, but feel sorry for the original investors
who have not fared nearly as well.

If management treats its shareholders as bad as its limited partner investors,
I would stay away from this one.

Good Investing to All, and to All a Good Investment!

paul, like you my only investments are value plays and also sold when fully
valued. What I meant was of all the different types of value plays, the ones we
have had best irr on always seem to be those that unlock into growth stories
and we sell to others who take them to even higher levels. our best ones seem
to be where we actually leave the most on the table. the other plays like PSO
(which I still own james) really never convert into growth story and, while i
make good money and good irr, never get to or take forever to become fully
valued. thus I hold too long and reduce IRR albeit the investment was always
more defensive/conservative due to its perpetual undervaluation. how about you?

Capstead Mortgage (CMO)

Stock was up 33% today from 3 to 4 on news that
CMO is selling its mortgage banking portfolio to
GMAC Mortgage for $550 million.

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/981210/tx_capstea_1.html

With book value around $8.00 (market cap of $250 million),
I think there is room for much more appreciation. Stock
price was below book value due to leverage and lack of
liquidity (potential bankruptcy bait), but this sale
should help allay those fears.

I bought some before the close today. Of course, I would
suggest anyone else interested to do a lot of research
before buying --- these mortgage companies can be tricky.

James,

Note that I buy my limited partnership units on the secondary market at
substantial discounts to the underlaying value of the unit. Unlike the original
buyers of the partnerships, and unlike the stock market, I have never lost
money on this type investment. I do a lot of analysis before I buy, but then so
do I when I buy a stock, where my returns are only fair. I have been
"Swishered" by PSA in that I have "only" received average annualized returns in
the low 20's. Have the holders of PSA done as well on a consistent basis?

Nonetheless, Public Storage has a fiduciary responsibility to its investors,
whether they are in a limited partnership or stockholders. They do not meet
this responsibility, leaving them open to lawsuits. They have a duty to more
than just their stock options. I would also think it likely that if they treat
one set of investors a certain way, then they will likely treat other investors
the same way if given the chance. Integrity of management is an important
consideration of mine when I invest in a company. If it is not one of yours, I
respect that. Differences of opinion and style are what makes a market.

(Disclaimer: Limited Partnerships are a highly specialized investment. They are
generally illiquid. In no way, shape, or form am I promoting this type of
investment.)

Good Investing to All!!!

It seems to me that the overall market is very weak on the fundamentals. The
earnings warnings are really starting to pile up among big name blue chips and
the broader market doesn't feel healthy.

On the flip side the Fed has engineered a further expansion of the financial
asset bubble by lowering rates. There is a ton of money out there. It has to go
somewhere and techs are getting most of it right now because they haven't
disappointed yet. That's why the S&P500 and Nasdaq are outperforming.

It's my view that when this period is finally over, Alan Greenspan will have a
much different reputation than he currently sports. That is of course unless he
manages to pass the mess he has created to his poor successor.

He has repeatedly flooded the system with money every time there was an attempt
by the system to remove the excesses through market forces.
Wall St. loves it. The public and much of the media doesn't understand it.

The bubble is now so big that its deflation threatens the REAL economy and the
financial future of millions of Americans who own overvalued securities by
historic standards.

There may be some values out there, but there are few among S&P500 stocks and
the middle class is a net indexer! Thanks Alan!

Andrew: re: best value plays. Yes, my experience is similar to what you report.
For example, with these small value plays -- microcap (under $75M) stocks
selling at net-net, they seem to take forever to work out. (So, IRR is
reduced). I think Ben Graham in Intelligent Investor says stick with larger
firms. (Although in some writings, he just says (I think) that he bought a
basket of such stocks. )Perhaps these larger companies, because they are
familiar to investors - or more familiar than dinky microcaps - there's more of
a chance that someone will bid them up to fair value or higher and sooner than
with microcaps. Anyway, I've not had very good success with net-nets, but I
keep trying. (Idea is sound; perhaps I just don't have the requisite patience
to hold, plus there's a dearth of these kinds of value stocks now.)

Buying low pe and low p/bv stocks has been much better for me. Here again
though, it's been better when growth or momentum investors pile in later on. In
one recent example, I bought a home builder at mid teens, sold some last month
at mid twenties a year later. The same day I read SI posts in
beaten-down-stocks-poised-for-a recovery-thread where the thread owner now
recommended her followers buy it. Similar with VVTV which I bought last year as
a value stock (and it still may be), but profitably sold a couple of weeks ago
as VVTV got pulled up in the internet craze. For me, I seem to do better when I
just sell since my ruling reason for buying was that it was a value stock. When
I start thinking they're now growth stocks, I succumb to holding and I seem to
lose out. Paul Senior

Considering he asked whether the current market felt like July, I thought that
a yes it does FEEL like July answer was satisfactory. The original poster and
myself were obviously talking about the market action and the broadness of the
rallies. This sort of stuff is outside the scope value investing but it
addressed the question. The market IS acting like it did just before the recent
correction.

I never act on my feelings when I invest or otherwise. Nor did I suggest anyone
else do so either.

I never said I think Greenspan is a Turkey. We have a monetary system that can
create excesses. In general, easy money causes consumer price inflation. But in
this case it caused asset inflation because that's where a lot of the easy
money was directed. Mr Greenspan had every opportunity to cut those excesses
short prior to the problems in Asia. He chose not to because he believes asset
prices are outside the scope of his job. (even though he thinks we are in a
Bubble too!) I think he has made a great error for which we are all going to
pay eventually. The experience of Japan in the 80s and the U.S. in the 20s
suggests that central bankers should pay attention to asset prices.

I also don't believe that understanding why we are where we are is outside the
range of useful knowledge for any investor. Without an understanding of the
nature of what is going on, it isn't possible to value companies properly. In a
bubble, the income streams are suspect because outsized capital gains are
driving the economic activity to a larger degree than is normal. There are also
all sorts of corporate pension allocation and other considerations that make a
bubble different from a normal economy.

How many companies that presently have multi-billion dollar pension funds for
their employees would be forced to come up with enormous amounts of money if
the stock market reverted to its mean and they were suddenly very underfunded?

Where would consumption levels go if we had a bear market and everyone started
saving at normal levels instead of negative levels?

That's why I bring it up. That's why it's important for VALUE GUYS too. Many,
if not most companies are earning more than they would under normal conditions.
Some companies in the financial services industry aren't worth anywhere near
what their current earnings streams suggest. Since I am trying to help, I hope
you will at least think about why I am talking about these sorts of things
instead of trashing my every post because I didn't say what YOU wanted to hear.
Your companies may not be worth what you think! I am addressing general
valuation considerations that most people are overlooking. You don't have to
agree. You don't have to read what I say. Some people would like to though.

I realize that most investors consider value investing and growth investing to
be separate disciplines, but I don't think they really are. They are joined at
the hip. Future probable growth is a significant factor in determining
intrinsic value. If two companies have identical book values, ROE, EPS,
management, balance sheets etc... yet one has a greater opportunity to reinvest
capital, it is more valuable. The trick is to value the growth component of its
prospects. There are all sorts of approaches to this. I think it is worth the
effort to try to do so. Even Graham would agree with this. He just discouraged
pie in the sky valuations. Buffett on the other hand has done a great job of
identifying companies whose growth is almost certain and long lasting and
therefore extremely valuable. Compound interest/growth at high rates over long
periods gets one rich. Especially if it is purchased at a bargain and you get
to participate in multiple expansion also as it reaches fair value. Cheap but
lousy companies often work out poorly because even a CD grows at the rate of
reinvested interest. You must be able to grow or if the revaluation occurs
slowly the investment will be poor. Don't you agree?

value plays". If I can't identify value plays myself or pick up on value plays
that others have mentioned, or if nobody is mentioning anything they think is a
value play, then it's a waste of time thread. Nice to have discussions about
Buffett vs. Graham, or relative pe's vs relative ROE's or importance of
management, or asset bubbles or whatever-- but such discussions are, IMO and
from what I can tell, not the purpose of this thread.

To me, at least some of the concerns you bring forth are Red Herrings. For
example, there's been stuff written in the literature for at least 25 years
that I recall, about the sorry state of pension funding, and how, if the true
costs of pension liabilities were known, some of our largest and smallest
companies are in big trouble. Well, that's 25 years of this. And these
companies are, from what I can tell, mostly still muddling through. Anybody who
spent much time trying to determine true pension cost exposure in each company
he/she looked at, or made investing decisions based on pension issues (like
avoiding such companies), wasted time and missed, IMO, some wonderful
investment opportunities.

Obviously, I don't understand what you are trying to do to help. For example,
you bring in Greenspan, asset bubble inflation, central bankers, and we are
going to pay for this. Well, what would you have me or anyone else do? Sell all
our stocks which we own and think are undervalued or all our growth stocks? Not
buy any stock that anyone posts on on this thread because of this and other
dangers you can point to? You may be entirely right if you are saying that
market is going to punish us all. But that's not been the right belief in the
past few years. It has been a hurtful rather than helpful position for anyone
who's followed it.

Everyday there are new lows being made in some stocks. If alleged value

The key is that the value of any company is related to its pension status in

that are underfunded are going out of business. They are worth less than they
appear to be. It is not a waste of time to know if a company has or could have
a bunch of liabilities that are now not clear. It's one of many things to think
about. I think it is an issue now because all such pensions have been
generating very superior returns for the last 4 years. That means allocations
to those pensions for SOME companies have been running below ususal. That
translates into higher NORMALIZED reported profits. At this stage of the game,
I would prefer to own a company that doesn't have such a pension or is
overfunded like IBM. There will be fewer potential negative suprises if we have
a bear market. To me that is a VALUE issue.

>>Obviously, I don't understand what you are trying to do to help. For
example, you bring in Greenspan, asset bubble inflation, central
bankers, and we are going to pay for this. Well, what would you have me or
anyone else do? Sell all our stocks which we own and think are
undervalued or all our growth stocks? Not buy any stock that anyone
posts on on this thread because of this and other dangers you can point to? You
may be entirely right if you are saying that market is going to punish us all.
But that's not been the right belief in the past few years. It has been a
hurtful rather than helpful position for anyone who's followed it.<<

In most cases I am just trying to explain my view of what is going on and what
the expectations for stocks are IN GENERAL. I think POOR. The fact the the
BUBBLE has continued to grow (in my view) is and should be an irrelevant fact
to value investors. Many stocks are just more overvalued than before. I am
giving no advice at all. At my page I just explain where we are in relation to
history, some valuation issues that are not getting adequate coverage (like
stock option compensation) and that sort of stuff. I also like to discuss
valuation theory. To me, understanding this stuff makes for better investing
and I appreciate when someone points things out to me too. I think that
understanding the banking system can only help even if it generally has little
to do with the values.

>>Everyday there are new lows being made in some stocks. If alleged value
investors cannot or will not find at least a few of these stocks as
undervalued, then it's my belief that these folks are not really value
investors - Buffett investors maybe, or something else investors - but not
value investors. That again of course, is in my opinion. Paul Senior<<

You are correct. No doubt. But the issues of BUBBLE level consumption,
Pensions, stock option compensation, and investment theory are still applicable
to those stock too if we are trying to get at real bargains.

I would love to hear YOUR ideas on how to value companies. But I have little
interest in specific companies because of my own limited area of comfort.

twist...

Why is it that there are people who want to "censor" others on an "open" forum
such as this? I mean, isn't this a "two way" communication set up? I guess we
can all insert posts that say "buy this stock...it's a "value"...without even
explaining—other than that it's below book (whatever that is these days,) why
it's a so called value. In fact, most of these so called "values" as one
admonished participant who is so far resisting the veiled invitation to exit
points out, are nothing of the sort. Can you imagine twist, still trying to
look for net-nets in 1998-99 with the s&p selling at, what 5 or 6 times book?
When Graham originated the idea, the s&p fluctuated between BELOW book and two
times book. But I guess there STILL is a flat earth society meeting going on
SOMEWHERE too.

SI has this set up really nicely my man. Theres a next button. And if you don't
like someone or you know you aren't even going to attempt to even "try" and
understand what a guy is trying to say, then hit the next button. And you'll be
free and clear from having to branch out and open your mind, one more time. Got
that twister? Then you can get what YOU WANT, plus allow others to get the
"opposite" of what you want, which is to EXPAND their minds and try and pound
some NEW ideas into them. After all twist, the WORLD has changed and it doesn't
make sense to rely ONLY on the CRUTCH of a dated investment philosophy.
Granted, there's residual value in that dated philosophy, but the state of the
art has progressed much further, if one can only open their eyes to it.

Finally twist, I say if you want to have an "exclusionary" board, start a new
one that says, "A thread for me.. and this guy and that guy and that's it."
When posting HERE, you SHOULD ALWAYS tout a stock, but you MUST SAY it's a
value. You should not, however, under any circumstances, PROVE that it is one.

On the difficulty of "proving" that a stock is a value stock. (longish post)

This thread has been in existence for more than two years. I'd guess there are
perhaps 5 to 15 active posters here, supplemented with a bunch of occasionals.
Among the active posters, there seem to be a couple, maybe more, of
professional value investors, perhaps one current or ex-fund manager, a number
of serious and determined "amateur" value players, and a range of investing
experience from maybe 3 to 50 years. Some of the occasional posters seem to be
very, very knowledgeable in certain fields - accounting, oil & gas, REITs,
electronic contract manufacturers, and so on. (Of course, this is my general
understanding based on what people have said here over the two years -- there's
no survey -- but I think I'm pretty much in the ball park.)

Now given this background, and given that this generally, and by the stated M.
Burry purpose of the thread, is a Ben Graham value investing thread, one would
think -- or more precisely, in 1996 and 1997 when this thread was new, I would
have bet, that since Ben Graham provided several methods for evaluating and
classifying value stocks for his two categories of investor (defensive vs.
enterprising), that it would be straightforward to identify and agree on stocks
to purchase which fall in such classifications. Maybe not so easy to find such
stocks, but once they were mentioned on such a thread as this, and if they fell
into some Ben Graham classification or perhaps the classification of even a
more current value player's ala Dreman, Davis Brothers, etc.... that there
would be a resulting general agreement that such a stock was a value stock.

But, surprising to me, what I found is that, of the hundreds of stocks
mentioned here, including those by the active posters as well as the occasional
"industry specialist", not only is there no general agreement, there is rarely
any stock mentioned that more than two other people will agree is a value
stock. I just cannot believe, with the expertise that some people have here,
that the suggestions are bogus value stocks. And it's not in the dearth of
information included in the post. (Because I believe too many people here are
checking further - either cursorily or in detail - on every stock that is
posted here.)

Rather, my conclusion is that it is nearly impossible to "prove" a stock is a
value stock, because we all have a different perception of what a "value" stock
is (in spite of what Ben Graham or Dreman or O'Shaugnessy or anybody else
says). And secondly, and maybe more importantly, because we all have different
risk tolerances and different portfolio management strategies, "proving" the
value (the margin of safety) in a value stock is different for each person.
Thus, for a person very concerned about losing money, who might only hold 5
stocks at one time - that person must, I assume, utterly convince
himself/herself that any stock must unalterably or unconditionally be a value
stock. Perhaps also for someone who invests "pig at trough"- which is what I
refer to someone who will kick out a stock already owned in order to make room
for a new purchase. (So value investing becomes a relative and
portfolio-dependent thing for this person.)

Anyway, I've come to believe that anyone who is here looking for 'proof' that a
stock is a value stock just from the information people post on that stock,
that person is not going to get the proof or should not expect the proof, in
the post. Certainly not in any initial post.

One thing that has been helpful, IMO of course, and as I have posted on last
year, is the absolute number of people who will discuss then buy (or buy then
discuss) a particular stock after it is initially mentioned on this thread. I
went back and looked at all the posts where 2, 3, or 4 people admitted to
buying the posted-on company. I found that when the original poster led to 2
other people buying the stock that was mentioned, that investment worked out
profitably (e.g. JOE) And when 3 other people bought the stock, that worked out
very well. There were very few of these though (I don't have my paperwork with
me-- I seem to think there were maybe about 4 such companies each with 4 people
buying). For example, a couple of picks by Mike Burry or Jim Clarke --- WHX,
Saucony (when it was a net-net) generated much discussion -- there were at
least 4 people who posted to buying these companies at that time-- and
ultimately (and fairly quickly IMO), these two investments were profitable.

Currently there is a discussion going on about HLX. IMO, a stock with many good
points a value investor might find attractive. Discussed by two people who IMO
are pretty thorough, knowledgeable, serious, smart value investors (that'd be
IMO-- sorry if I've misclassified or attributed to them qualities they don't
actually have -g--- I only know them from some of their posts): but my point
would be here we have a very good opportunity to perhaps purchase an ongoing,
profitable business where the stock is out of favor-- although it's been more
out of favor before. Not to say that HLX is or is not a good investment, only
that it is a typical kind of post that may identify a value stock. And that,
with all the people reading this thread and thinking about HLX, I'll guess that
not more than two other people will see value for them in what the original
poster is identifying and consequently, soon buy the stock. But if two people
actually do, and post about it, then there's an empirical reason for others to
very seriously also REconsider HLX.

All just my opinion. Paul Senior

Wayne Crimi: re: "I thought this thread had a duel purpose". Well, about now I
sure feel that way -gg-. LOL! But perhaps you meant 'dual' purpose. That(dual
purpose), as I read the thread header, I am not sure about. But regardless of
what I think, this thread gets a lot of useful input from a lot of people about
the philosophy and ideas of value investing and other investing ideas.

Also to clarify some English further, the person who posts to himself/herself
after me and accuses 'people' here of trying to 'censor' people --- please
don't think that I am trying to censor you. You say whatever you darn well
want. I am not trying to censor you. But I am trying to censure you. (def:
adverse criticism). I think your way of investing is dead wrong. That would be
my opinion of course. On the other hand, I am not at all saying I have the only
way or even the right way. Or even that I can use the way I have successfully.

I am basically and essentially looking for proven methods that work -- Where
there is some academic or historical support. On this, the Ben Graham value
thread, it's entirely reasonable to assume that I and others would be trying to
use Ben Graham's methods to the extent I/we understand them and that they apply
to today's world. Thus, IMO there are two recommended methods for valuing
stocks (per B. Graham, FAJ, 1976): the first is the "more limited technique of
purchasing common stocks at less than their working-capital value" and the
second, which

"...consists of buying groups of stocks at less than their current or intrinsic
value as indicated by one or more simple criteria. The criterion I (Ben Graham)
prefer is seven times the reported earnings for the past 12 months. You can use
others - such as a current dividend return above seven per cent or book value
more than 120 per cent of price, etc. We are just finishing a performance study
of these approaches over the past half-century - 1925-1975. They consistently
show results of 15 per cent or better per annum, or twice the record of the
DJIA for this long period. I have every confidence in the threefold merit of
this general method based on (a)sound logic, (b) simplicity of application and
(c) an excellent supporting record. At bottom it is a technique by which true
investors can exploit the recurrent excessive optimism and excessive
apprehension of the speculative public."

I enjoyed your post very much. In my mind there is no such thing as a "value
stock" per se. At a certain price, any stock (even an internet stock) can
represent a good value. I suspect that Graham was simply trying to set up a
series of guidelines for locating good value. I don't think he was trying to
set up definition for "value stocks".
Different investors use different models and methods to identify companies that
are selling below their value.

Paul,

Thanks for the spelling correction on "Duel". I was in a hurry when I typed
that before leaving for work.

>>I think your way of investing is dead wrong. That would be my opinion of
course.<<

I don't believe you really understand my method. It is very Graham/Buffett
like. My writings at my web page and occasionally here cover general market
valuation stuff and economic issues. But I never invest based on my ideas about
where the market is going or what I think the economy will be doing. I do like
discussing it though, because I think there are tons of people out there that
think 31x earnings and 20%+ annual gains are normal!

I use very Graham like models. I have just supplemented Graham with insights
that I have gained from reading about Buffett and reading everything he has
written about valuing businesses.

I buy when I find a company that meets my criteria of value and quality. I sell
when they become significantly overpriced or I find a better idea. That's all I
do.

But I also dig deeply into the financials in an effort to make sure that a
company is really making what they are reporting. And I also think about the
sustainability of certain conditions in the economy that may be benefiting my
company in the short term.

I general, I like to buy above average companies selling at average prices or
average companies selling very cheaply. That is my version of Graham/Buffett.
Right now I am having a terrible time finding companies that possess both my
valuation standards and my quality standards.

<< At a certain price, any stock (even an internet stock) can represent a good
value.>> No argument there. I just might differ from others about the number of
digits on that price. One digit sounds about right for most of them, at least
the ones with potentially viable business models.

I think there are two misunderstandings emerging here
1) This is a thread dedicated to Ben Graham investing. That's not censorship -
you don't tune call Rush Limbaugh to talk about gardening. If you are not that
type of investor, then this thread would either be a learning opportunity or
probably a waste of your and everybody else's time. I do not spend my time on a
Ben Graham thread to learn other investment styles.
2) Value investors have some overly rigid ideas about what a value stock is -
Warren Buffett has proven to us just what you say, that value investing does
not just apply to things trading at book value with no prospects. But there is
a limit there. At the core of Graham and Buffett investing is the notion of
risk. Any time you are forecasting earnings, except in the case of a
Buffett-type inevitable (but even then, forecast conservatively and God forbid
don't buy at that price) - you are taking risk. Today everybody calls himself a
value investor - only an idiot would buy something at a price they know is more
than the business is worth, right? You'd think so, but it is incredible to me
how many people do that, admit to doing it, and ridicule me for my
conservatism. Which brings me back to the attitude toward risk. And I think
Wayne Crimmi agrees that risk should be the foremost thing on our minds today.
Ben Graham's discipline is the best way I know to control risk. That doesn't
mean only buying net-net stocks. What it means is asking yourself honestly what
am I buying, what's the least it could be worth, and am I getting fair value on
that basis. That stodgy attitude, Twister, has made me a quite satisfactory
return in this frothy market, but unlike the other approaches, it will protect
me when things collapse.

Wayne, the fact that you are NOT pitching stocks in this market tells me you
are a value investor, possibly more disciplined than the rest of us. When you
do find something to buy, I hope you will let us know, because it will probably
be something we should all look at. Unlike Paul, I do think market timing is a
reasonable pursuit when you are dealing with extremes. Timing when the market
should trade at 14 or 16 times earnings is probably a fools game. But when the
market is trading at 27 times earnings, being very very conservative is not
market timing, its just common sense. And if the market went to 7 times
earnings tomorrow, selling the cat to buy stocks is rational in my book. I
don't think Paul disagrees completely - he just looks at individual stocks
individually - if he can't find anything to buy, I'm sure he'd be in cash. And
there is stuff to buy at cheap prices now. But are we kidding ourselves
thinking that we won't be able to buy LaSalle for 6 and Cyprus Amax for 8 if
this market falls apart?

I think my last post was probably directed at a couple of others who were
posting yesterday, not at you Wayne.

I am fully invested again - though only because I pulled out 70% of my
portfolio to buy a house. But I am uncomfortable. I am still sleeping well.
When I can't sleep well, I'll do what I did last July - as Graham said, sell
until I can sleep well. I'm not there yet because the stocks I have left I
consider low risk and so beaten up that Mr. Market shouldn't bother them too
much when he does his thing to Dell and GE.

Jim,

>>Wayne, the fact that you are NOT pitching stocks in this market tells me you

I have very conservative standards/definitions of a bargain. And I can assure
you that all my investment decisions are based on value.

I have no problem telling you my current portfolio and other recent holdings.

BRKA - I accumulated BRKA in 1988-1990. I will never sell it no matter what the
value and if I tell you that I am going to at some point in the future, please
talk me out it. I would obviously be having some sort of breakdown.

LUK - I bought a token amount of this earlier this year because I think the
management is brilliant and I want to closely follow what they are doing and
saying. Their investment record is on a par with Buffett's.

APPB - Bought at an average price of 18. I think it was late last year. Don't
really love it but it was an idea when I had none.

SBA - Bought during the recent decline in the low 20s after a 28.5 offer was
just rejected by shareholders as too low. (A new offer just came in from the
family for 27.50. I am getting involved in a class action suit on this one.
They are trying to steal it)

ESV - I really know nothing about the oil business at all. The group was so
beaten down I took a very small position recently and hope that I don't get an
expensive education. But I think it is a bargain from normalized earnings power
perspective.

MCY - Bought in then recent downturn at 32.

DEO - Bought in January. I think it is fully priced now. It paid a special 10%
dividend due to the merger of Guiness and Grand Met. I am a former shareholder
of Guiness and I liked the combo, dividend, and potential capital gains. (which
came through)

I have a very high cash percentage for me. I like to be almost fully invested
but I am nowhere near that now. I am as dry as a bone for ideas. I'm not even
thrilled about APPB, SBA or ESV.

In the last year or so I sold:

Kimberly Clark (this was a quick in and out after the recent decline)

Tootsie Roll (I love this company to death but it got too pricy when it
announced the split)

Mcdonalds

Cadbury Schwepps (Britain)

Novartis (Switzerland)

Investor AB (Sweden)

Tele Danmark (Denmark)

I started investing in Europe in 1996-1997 when I ran out of ideas in the U.S.
The experiment was successful but I have a very limited range there and prices
are high there too now.

I have a list of about 70 companies that I either follow closely or would take
a crash course in if the price was right. They are all what I consider as very
above average businesses.

Tomato: Thanks for the post. I think I saw that same Harvard guy on Wall St.
Week a few years back. He made a lot of sense to me -- I like trying to be
aware of the psych./emotional aspects of investing (which you might even guess
if you've read some of my posts -g-), but this guy spoiled it for me by
recommending a stock - actually almost guaranteeing a profit with it -- and it
was some cockamayme Canadian coal-transforms-into gasoline company.

As I recall, Mr. Rukeyser himself did not disagree, or he commented favorably
(and as you must know, he is pretty careful to caution investors about his
guests' picks). Well he missed there, and as a result there was quite a
maelstrom of criticism directed Louis's way in the financial press, and by
viewers.

Anyway, I'll look for his book in the remainder section of my fav. bookstore in
my fav. outlet mall. (I'm currently reading Seth Klarman's Margin of Safety--
bought there @ $3.00-- thought it was a good value -g- . As I think about it,
I'm doing better at buying investment books than I am at buying stocks. -g- )

Wait, wait wait... I've got my notes from the program (May 24, 1996--- Dick
Geist) right here. I can't believe it's just right above me on my bookshelf

"Eighty to ninety percent of all investment mistakes are psychological not
financial". "I think in making decisions... about investments, most people have
the same information and can learn the financials. (note: ah now I see --- the
FINANCIAL CALCULATOR -gg_) And what they're really missing is the psychological
stability to engage in a market that is so volatile at this point that it
affects them every day." And later...
"I also like Solv-Ex, which has discovered a technology for getting oil and
minerals out of tar sands up in the Athabasca region. It will be the biggest
oil company in the United States and maybe the world." Ruckeyeser: "That one's
been highly volatile and has sold off sharply in recent weeks."
Geist: Sold off sharply, down to $6 from $30 because of media hype, negative
media hype, and then it's come back to $26 today.
Rukeyser: "Now we've had some positive media hype. Let's turn to our panel...."

Later:
Rukeyser: "If you could give just one piece of psychological advice to people,
what would it be?"
Geist: "It would learn about how one reacts ahead of time to anxiety and
volatility in the market."

Well as I say, I do like some of his (Geist's) ideas.

his book is that he was comfortable with United Asset Mgt. growing at 22.5% a

my eyebrows.

Besides that, it was a pretty interesting book. The best one I've looked at

sure you can find it at any big bookstore. I read through it while sitting on

well below bv (per Yahoo), they seemed to have taken a big sales drop from '96
to '97 from which they haven't recovered.

EMT, looks too tough for me to figure out.

UBB: some nice posts on it in Yahoo thread, esp. reference to recent Barron's
article. (It's hard for me to get stated, let alone "real" bv. figures on some
of these companies, but Barron's' quoted analyst gives some indication for me.)
Is that actually a 10% in USA$ dividend?--I'll have to check further.

You like Brazil I take it? Can I move you over to Rep. of Panama for
Banco Latinamer. De Exp. doing business in Brazil (35%)and Mexico (26%)? BLX,

Armin: Some of my stocks also down from my original positions - and I am also
adding.

Today bought more MMI (@14). Bv($21+) is understated imo. Professional value
investors buying, also some insider buying.

Today added to NOC. Northrup trades about 4x cash flow and maybe 10x '99
earnings (sorry... sometimes I do think about future earnings -- but I try to
avoid doing so -g-). Sales, margins seem to be increasing.

Today started new small position in BUR(8 11/16). Asian market will apparently
flood US and Mexico with textile products. Burlington Industries looks like
it's trying to focus and maybe abandon US manufacturing. Trading at pe about 6,
with BV about 12, and close to its lowest price since '92, .5B market cap.
Worth a small investment within a diversified value portfolio --IMO.

Yesterday added to GHV. Very out of favor. p/bv = .41. psr = .19 (per Yahoo).

Hey Paul, I can understand your aversion to market timing, but I don't get why
financial calculators would bother you.

Another plug for Cyprus Amax (CYM), one of the cheapest stocks I know of. I was
talking through it with a room full of value investment professionals today,
and even they made a face. That tells me that every conceivable seller has
sold. Yeah, their business looks awful, but everybody knows that. I think I
have said before that sometimes that face is the best indicator. Especially
when you also know that metals stocks tend to outperform consistently in
December, January and February. I have done a 30 year study on this seasonal
effect, and the results were compelling enough for me to buy a copper stock.
Just make sure you sell it in March.

'Tis the season to buy January bounces. My picks would be CYM, Clayton Homes
(CMH) - note that Clayton's drop last week was a 5-4 split, not a decline in
the value, and the entire REIT sector.

Hi Jim: yes CYM. Still liking and watching. Got a little away from me last few

re: financial calculators. That'd be for discounted cash flows, IRR's that sort
of thing? Which would be predicting the income stream? And choosing a discount
rate? Seems more income statement (Buffett) than balance sheet (Graham). Or
maybe it's determining car payments so don't have to tie up cash and then use
cash for stock buying. That could work. Personally I don't think they're
necessary though for Graham value investors. How do you guys use 'em?

DSSI sells at about a 30% discount to their equity in tower semiconductor.
tower semiconductor was selling around $9 and had $5.5 in cash. DSSI has other
assets besides Tower. lots of info on these on the silicon thread.

UBB just has impressed me as a well run bank which is selling at a fraction and
i do mean a fraction of what this bank would sell for if it was in any other
country except for maybe russia. I don't know how brazil will fare but i think
a significant devaluation is already priced into this and I do not think there
will be a significant devaluation. I don't know much about blandex and how it
makes its money and I am very comfortable with UBB so if i am going to buy more
of a south american bank i will buy more ubb at these levels.

EMT sells for about 5x cashflow. any internet activity in brazil currently
flows through EMT. its parent-Worldcom has an enterprise value of 15x revenue.
compared to its parent it is awfully cheap and it would be awfully easy for the
parent to increase its revenue significantly simply by buying shares of emt on
the open market. I see EMT as the cheapest internet stock on the face of the
planet- and the potential for growth in Brazil is just unbelievable.

I also own Olsten which I have not added to during its decline as I am less
than enthusiastic about its short term prospects and have concerns about
quality of management but you probably know more about this one than I. It may
be a deservedly cheap stock.

CYM - please indulge me with your method for determining that this is a 'value'
stock. I saw the original suggestion, so I dutifully went to Value Line as
Charlie Munger has told us to. Aside from their thumbs down recommendation, the
numbers and text were relatively understandable. Debt is big. My remembrance is
that the dividend could be in question. So then I went to the 10K and saw that
their operations were everywhere. They were selling coal properties in
Appalachia (sp), but keeping them elsewhere in the Midwest and West. They had
molybendenum mines that were of questionable profitability. And copper mines
were in this country, Peru, and Chile. Lithium was a loser that they are
exiting. Finally they had merged Amax Gold into Kinross.

How do you value this? I just gave up.

On the otherhand, I confess that I'm a 'January Effect' addict such that I bit
into IBC and HLX which have been mentioned here. Also LNN, YLF, and VANS. And I
wondered about WALBP - That 15% cumulative dividend looks yummy, but is this
just a 'falling knife'?

take a look at Petsec (PSJ). After drilling very successfully in the Gulf, all
of a sudden they drilled three dry holes in a row as a result a big loss this
year. However the stock has dropped from about $16 to $1.5. I think this is
overkill due to small cap, bad year, bad industry, australian company. I figure
sooner or later the weather will get cold, they will hit something, and the
stock will increase to a more reasonable level. This is a little bit similar to

LauA: Okay. Here's a way to value CYM. My way-- not necessarily the best, only,
or correct, way. First the big picture. Then some numbers. Then some other
stuff and implications.

Big picture: This is the Ben Graham value thread. We are going to own a bunch
of Graham type stocks. We will play a statistical game - not all of the
investments will work out successfully, but the ones that do will cover the
ones that do not. "Successfully" means maybe a profit of 50% over a 3 year
holding, maybe a double, and with some margin of safety. If you agree with
this, then let's discuss "bunch of stocks". Exactly how many is that? Some
people say 8-12, some 20, some 50 or more. I'm in the >50 camp. DIVERSIFY.
DIVERSIFY. Okay, now time. How much time exactly is going to be spent analyzing
each investment? How much time is required to make a sell/buy decision on a
close-decision stock (That is, with some stocks, right away you know they don't
qualify, but a stock such as CYM, it might be iffy.) I'll say DD might be 2
hours. There ought to be some time limit. If I can't figure out whether to buy
or sell the thing with 2 hours of research and some thought, then PASS on it.
Come back later. THE POINT IS: With this CYM analysis you will NEVER do enough
research to know all there is to know, to be able to predict copper prices,
Peru expropriation policies, coal demand, or know the strength of the
management team, the number of mines they have or what all they even mine. It
is not necessary to know these things in this game.

Numbers: I will use a straight and simple valuation. But sometimes I change the
measures or weight them differently, depending on my knowledge of the industry.
Per Yahoo and WSRN: the price to sales is .34. This psr figure is about half of
what it's been in the past 6 years. The price to earnings is neglible. --They
are having a bad year. The price to book value is .4, again its low for the
past several years. More than 1/2 less than the p/bv of recent years. The stock
is about 10. My notes show that there hasn't been a year in the past 8 when
this stock has not sold above 20.

Other/implications: We know that the mining biz. and CYM are cyclical. We know
that CYM is big in Copper, Moly, Gold, and Coal. We know they are trying to
reduce costs (They got $1b for some of their coal properties.) We know there's
a big dividend and that means trouble -- the div. is likely to be cut. That
could drop the stock even further. We know when we tell anybody about buying
CYM, the shame/pride ratio is top heavy. (Everybody will look at us funny, just
as they did Jim when he presented it.) (Note: I actually am a believer in the
shame/pride ratio-- higher very often seems to be better) At some point anyway,
there just isn't anymore selling pressure. A little demand for the stock will
cause an upsurge. And at some point the metals markets WILL recover. CYM, we
are told, is lowering its operating costs, improving its productivity.
Somewhere there's a news article about them buying back some stock too.
Insiders (per Yahoo) don't seem to be selling. There's not much insider buying
though. Putting it all together, what do you think, maybe earn $3/sh and sell
for 8 times earnings. Maybe by 2001? Do we have the guts to hold that long? It
almost earned $2 in '93 and in '94 and sold for $24-25. It's going to happen
again. When? Can we hold until then?

I say this is one of the best value stocks I see out there now.

BUT.....

Only for someone who plays the entire game-- diversified and patient
(and for me, I'm diversified all right (LOL!), but not so sure of patient.) And
as pointed out to me by someone here ---Only by someone who will sell at the
full value point ----NOT ride the darn thing back down.

Please remember, if you invest based on what I say, I think you MIGHT do okay,
but you would be too trusting (or crazy). My record is just not that good IMO.
I think I talk a good game... not sure I can play it that well.

But if you invest on what Jim Clarke says, that's another story. He chooses
carefully and he doesn't seem to miss. But that would be another post -- how
Jim Clarke selects value stocks.

good investing! Paul Senior

On my best Graham investments, you're right, all I would have used would be the
+, -, x, / keys. Add up the value of what's on the balance sheet, subtract
debt, divide by the number of shares. Of course the hard work comes in knowing
what numbers to use. My worst investments have been the ones where I knew the

CYM Valuation

I tend to agree with everyone about the cheap valuation on CYM. To that list
you might add AR, FCX, and BHP. I have considered buying all of them. The only
reason I haven't is that commodity businesses are generally bad businesses.
They have very low normalized ROE and almost nothing in the way of growth. It
would seem that the ultimate return is going to be completely related to the
turn in commodity prices and the subsequent revaluation of them by the market.
That could possibly take years. I really have no idea. I own ESV. I suspect it
is in a very similar situation. My gut tells me that even though these
investments COULD work out well, they may not if the turn takes a long time. I
generally prefer better businesses.

Agree with you there Wayne Crimi. These stocks -- CYM-- they are not at all
comfortable to own. And they could, and probably will, take time to work out --
if they work out at all. I also prefer better businesses. (And I'll try to buy
them when I think I've found them.) Maybe I should be stressing more the
'statistical' nature of this game to Mr. or Ms. ALau. I surely don't want to
own CYM-- who would? But at some point --- and I thought the point was at 16
not at 10
-g- AND :>(
it fits very well the criteria for a value stock. So I buy. Because I've found
I just can't tell which "value" stocks will be winners, and which won't and of
the winners, when. My bet (and of course I mean bet), is that the odds favor
that CYM will be higher sometime in the next three years. That's IMO of course.
Maybe I also should be stating that I'm concerned about my portfolio increasing
in value in toto. From CYM, my position in it, I have no intention of getting
rich. I just want the profits I hope to see to contribute to an overall
portfolio gain.

Thanks for clue on ESV. I'll check on it further.

this started as a focused response, but turned into a brain dump on Jim
Clarke's investment strategy. Its long, but if you're not into streams of
consciousness, hit NEXT. This may just be me talking to myself. I'm still going
to post it because I think it might stimulate some thought, in light of Paul's
and Wayne's thoughtful posts on their ways of approaching value investing.
There is no one right way to do this.

***

I generally like to buy good businesses too, but at some price I will buy
anything. (I like to put it this way, "I will buy dogs%*t as long as it sells
for half the going rate from dogs%*t." Yeah, its "cigar butt investing" but
cigar butt investing can be very profitable if you know how to do it. If I make
$1000 after tax, I really don't care if its from Coke or from Cyprus Amax.
Actually, a dollar from Cyprus would give me more satisfaction because I know a
lot of morons who have made money on Coke, and I know a lot of geniuses who
have lost money on copper stocks.) As you know from my posts, my roots are in
Graham and Buffett and am willing to employ both strategies when opportunities
present themselves. Paul invited me to post a little more about how I pick
stocks with upside and little risk - he made me think - I have never really
laid it out, there is a lot of habit and instinct involved. (Not that I haven't
made some huge mistakes that fortunately I did not post here. Unfortunately,
those all seemed to end up in my institutional recommendations!)

Unlike Paul I do not diversify - I rarely hold more than ten positions. And
considering my portfolio is usually divided half and half between Graham and
Buffett (that means three true Buffett opportunities, three true Graham
opportunities, and four stocks I bought for stupid reasons. Those four are
usually the ones I wind up losing money on. I can't think of a stock I have
invested in for Grahamish reasons I have lost serious money on. Most of them
have been 30-75% gains within six months. Why do I not feel the need to
diversify and how have I gotten away with it?
1) I don't have enough money to own 50 stocks meaningfully;
2) I usually have a catalyst in addition to the valuation (Penobscot, St. Joe
and Tejon all had strong strong catalysts. CYM has a different sort of catalyst
in my view);
3) I've been real lucky
4) I don't take bankruptcy risk - if the downside is zero, I don't care what
the upside is. (Cyprus Amax bonds are still BBB, investment grade.)...and one
more I think is very important -
5) I don't get greedy with lousy companies - if the thing spikes 40%, which I
have found is usually how it happens - I sell immediately. And 3/4 of the time
it goes right back down.

Cyprus is clearly on the Graham side. When the price for a bad business gets so
low as to be virtually without risk, I'll buy it. (read: Saucony, Hyde, Tejon
Ranch). But when that bad business happens to be a cyclical where the cycle is
as far down as it has been in the last 20 years, things are even more
interesting. There you are looking at a relatively quick double if you're
right. If it takes two years to double your money, fine, so long as you are
reasonably sure about the downside risk.

I have posted this before because it represents two of my favorite investors'
wisdom. Ben Graham told this story in his class and Warren Buffett related it
in an annual report. I offer it the best I can remember, though I'm sure it
loses a lot in translation.

** A farmer brings his mule to the veterinarian and says, "I don't know what to
do with this mule. Some days he walks perfectly, and then other days he's
completely lame."

The vet looks the mule over and tells the farmer, "Its pretty simple. When he
walks, sell him." **

That's how you make money on a cyclical. Buffett points out that unlike a Coke
or a Gillette, you've got to be right twice on a copper company. You've got to
buy it within 20% of the bottom and you've got to get out before you round trip
the damned thing. Only when the valuation becomes incredibly compelling will I
mess around with one of these - I do not make it a habit of investing in
companies which can't earn their cost of capital consistently. But at half of
book value, all I am betting on is that the company is not going bankrupt.
Cyprus is not going bankrupt, unless the bond rating agencies are asleep at the
switch - its bonds are investment grade.

But that is not my strategy on CYM. I want to be out of this stock by March.
Metals stocks consistently outperform from December to March. The worse the
company, the bigger the bounce in the new year. Its not just January effect -
there is something about crappy cyclicals that I can statistically document,
but I cannot explain. I am looking for $13-15 on this stock then I'm gone. I
think that's virtually risk free money. If it doesn't happen by March, I'm
gone. And I don't think the price will be very far below where I bought it even
if I'm wrong.

Hope that sheds more light on what a nice guy like me is doing in a copper
stock (it is my second largest investment).

Sorry for the long post - hope it was worth reading.

i agree with you wayne. I have been considering this company called amcol. aco.
It has all the trappings of a "great value" stock. beaten down, low p/e you
name it. I looked a little deeper and discovered that while earnings have
generally been rising pretty smartly for at least four or five years, the
shares haven't kept pace and in fact may be DOWN over that period. I started to
really get at what the profitability of this firm was and discovered that it is
a LOW return business (less than half the roe of the s & p), low roa, low roic.
What one discovers is that, sure earnings have grown, but they have only grown
because management is using ever larger chunks of shareholder money to MAKE
them grow. In short, aco doesn't earn its cost of capital. Thus, while earnings
have BEEN on the rise, shareholders are about where they were five years ago.

Robert Sandborn of Oakmark, a great "fundamental" investor, was interviewed a
few months ago and said he pays zero attention to P/E, P/B, P/Dividends,
P/sales—any of the usual tools in the Grahmites bag. Hmmmm. Wonder if he's on
to something there. He only considers "good" businesses and holds an average of

A couple of random thoughts:

"value."

2. What about NAV? That company has been a real dog for years, complete with
reverse splits, near bankruptcy, and unmatched price declines.

No misunderstandings. I am absolutely not saying that you should look to buy
lousy businesses. I am only saying that what works for me is a barbell strategy
with great businesses at a good price at one end, and lousy businesses at a
risk-free price at the other. I employ very different target multiples and
analytical techniques depending on which category I put the investment into.
The key is to be able to tell the difference.

And surprisingly, even in this bull market for Buffett type stocks, I have
earned returns in excess of the S&P for the last two years with 75% of my net
profits coming from my Graham stocks, i.e. the lousy businesses. I wouldn't be
able to say that if I had diversified. I bet very big on St. Joe, and I bet
pretty big on Penobscot Shoe. Maybe just luck, but that luck is my down payment
on my first house next week. Thank you Ben Graham.

NAV, Navistar, has a horrendous history, and is a "value stock" in the crudest
sense of the word. I would not buy it because the truck cycle just started to
fall apart and I have done some forensic accounting on the company and in my
opinion they are playing games. At 9 two years ago you would have said the same
thing, but the thing tripled. The easy money has been made.

Twister, how about clarifying what Sandborn does if he does not use Graham's
"bag"? Like maybe his quote: "We do a lot of visiting with suppliers, customers
and competitors. We do spend a lot of time with senior management. We tend to
be long-term owners and develop very good relationships with these people
because we tend to think like owners, not just traders, and company managements
relate to that, identify with that, and so we spend a lot of time with them."

I believe his firm keeps very detailed records of what he calls "transactions
that occur in the marketplace" so that they can do comp evaluations.
Believe -but not sure of myself- that they pride themselves on documenting and
analyzing each takeover, buyout, self-tender, etc. reported in the press --
going back over many, many years.

Nothing wrong with his method. Great for him his fund investors. You say you
are wondering if he is on to something? Do you think this man has a method that
you will actually be able to use?

One of us is just not understanding. Maybe it's me. I seem to infer that you
are knocking the Graham methodology. To me, your posts are saying that Graham
methods are not as good or successful or something compared to Buffett or
Sandborn or ? To me, I agree Buffett, Sandborn -- they could run rings around
Graham (really, Graham was not THAT successful financially in his lifetime),
but my point is so what? These people you mention can't be emulated. Buffett is
the one and only, and Sandborn has too much money or resources behind him.
There needs to be IMO a value investing methodology that works for people who
want to buy stocks for their own portfolios. What is it that I am missing in
what you are saying?

Ah, Investor2. re: NAV. No--as you well know -g-, NAV is not now a value stock.
It was in 1996 when no one wanted it-- not now IMO.

Investor2: Maybe it's time for you to come back here and tell us poor folk some
more about your investing style. From some of your earlier posts I sense that
the chance of you EVER buying NAV is about 0. Over your 30? years investing
experience, you've bought Class A stocks and held them for huge gains. Are
there any of those superior companies you might recommend now for holding over
the next 10 years? (I'm kinda old--- not sure I can enjoy my riches for more
than about 15 years -g-). Looks like we've got people on the thread who like
good businesses they can hold forever... I think maybe it would be helpful if
you could again tell us how you found them/what your style is. (No impertinence

appreciate anything you might have to say though.

I am a bit confused here: buffet emphasize margin of safety so that he only
invest in the very best company, so that his risk is very low. so if you can't
calculate any thing with any certainty, then what's the point of doing it?

RE: "Maybe it's time for you to come back here and tell us poor folk some more
about your investing style."

I've moved through various styles of investing over the past 30 years. I
started with the "buy-and-hold" mentality for individual stocks. After that, I
went through the phase of short-term trading of individual stocks and rank
speculation in naked options. Then came my "long-term market timing phase,"
which was followed by the "dollar-cost-average into growing companies" phase.
(This method has been my most successful to date.) After that, I moved more and
more into mutual funds. I am now moving into a "simplification" phase, where I
am reducing the number of my mutual funds, stocks, brokerage accounts, etc. by
placing an increasing portion of my equity allocation into index funds.

If you have any questions about my opinions of any of the investment styles or
my reasons for moving on to other styles, please feel free to ask.

Throughout all of my investment style phases, I have had one big "sucker spot"
- bottom fishing. I just can't keep away from trying to catch those falling
knives.

Re: "From some of your earlier posts I sense that the chance of you EVER buying
NAV is about 0."

I am currently a proud shareholder of Navistar. The stock went from over $400
(split adjusted) down to below $10. I made the purchase a few years ago, when
the downside was negligible, when "it just couldn't get any lower." Of course,
that was before the 1 - 10 reverse split.

I believe that some of NAV's major problems over the past couple of decades
were associated with labor and pension issues. These issues, to a great extent,
have been resolved. The P/E of 6 seems reasonable, and then there's always the
chance that NAV could return to its glory days price of $400 per share.

Best wishes,

I2

DJ,

I guess maybe if you were more familiar with the thread, you wouldn't
have been pointing out to Jim Clarke that book value can be inflated by
worthless inventories (and, of course, many other factors). There are many
people who would know something so obvious, and Jim is certainly one of them.

Re: finding no downside risk in stocks, you're missing the point when you
suggest buying a CD. My thinking, and I believe Jim's, is that with proper
analysis, time frame, and stock price, you can determine whether a stock has
downside risk, and without being quantitative (foo on beta), categorize that
risk as large, medium, or small, or virtually nil. The upside doesn't need to
be in the forefront, since typically in the case of the "virtually nil downside
risk" category, it is a given that the company would be decent value at 2-3X
the current stock price. You count on the market recognizing at least a part of
that within whatever time frame you set, and count on being right in your
analsis the majority of the time.

This extreme form of value investing, with "virtually nil" risk, is very
difficult to practice. It means swallowing the fact that the market thinks
there is no upside and every other analysis you've seen says that this sh**
really smells.

So it follows that the biggest problem I've had, and I've noticed others have,
is that we buy value stocks when they are still in the "small" or "medium"
downside risk category, i.e. the story still offers some hope, and see the
stock get halved. New Holland at 17 may have small downside risk, but at 9 1/2
it became virtually nil. Then it didn't matter how long the down cycle or how
long until good news, 9 1/2 was a buy. Waiting for these fat pitches is the
hard part, and most of us can't do it consistently. The few that I've seen do
it, and Jim seems to be one of them, have had good success in a tough market
for value investors.

Good investing,
Mike

**Long Post Follows**
>>>Twister, how about clarifying what Sandborn does if he does not use Graham's
"bag"? <<

Sanborn (corrected spelling) tries to find good businesses that sell at 60% of
the price that someone who knows the business intimately and wants to hold
FOREVER, would pay for the whole thing. To calculate that, you do have to
follow transactions or at least know what the current guidelines are. This
investor pays particular attention to EBITA, that it operating earnings +
amortization which is his proxy for owner's free cash flow. If he likes a
business, he will then figure out what kind of multiple to put on this EBITA,
while also taking the level of debt into account.

What does it take to invest this way? Well it takes about as much accounting
knowledge as it takes to do Graham analysis but of course the more you know the
better. It also takes some QUALITATIVE skills and some fundamental business
knowledge, and the kind of knowledge that Lynch talks about in his books. But
mostly, you should be RATIONAL. Buffet points out that most any investor could
have determined that KO was a SPECIAL business. But at the time, the WS
analysts had labeled the thing "avoid" "hold" or “market performer" because
they did a basic P/E analysis and determined "this is too rich." Buffet on the
other hand noticed that KO had been growing its international business rapidly,
had sold Columbia, bought back stock, and reversed the "deworsification." He
noticed that KO's moat was getting deeper and wider. He then said, this is
something I want to hold forever and basically discounted the free cash flows
from here to doomsday at the long bond rate and had a fantastic business with a
HUGE MARGIN OF SAFETY on his hands. Well you know the rest. Now what SUPERHUMAN
skills did this take? Buffet would say none. In fact, Buffet says there are
plenty of investors who have more brainpower than he does (mostly in Greenwich)
<G>. But he is totally RATIONAL about investing, as is Charlie Munger.

Getting back to Sanborn. Just in the interview I read, I Learned that defense
companies tend to be bought by rational owners at 8 to 12 times EBITA and that
even the 12 times EBITA ones work well for long term OWNERS. I also learned
that good newspapers tend to be bought by RATIONAL owners who want to purchase
the entire company and also plan to keep it forever, will pay 15 times EBITA.
So now I can look at newspaper companies and defense stocks, all in one
interview freely available to ANYONE. What did I do with this knowledge? Well I
put two and two together. I remembered that Buffet still likes the Buffalo News
and WPO. I also know what these companies are purchased for in transactions. I
also know that ECP is Media Company that OWNS two monopoly newspapers. It took
me a few minutes to determine that ECP would command a price somewhere north of
$90 a share if it were sold. Since the intrinsic value of that company is
growing at 8% to 10% rates, I figured it would be a safe investment at prices
somewhere less than $60 which is where I was buying stock back in October down
to $55. Now I don't know how this will all work out but I feel pretty sure that
that's THE WAY the game is played, more or less by the "good business" bunch,
of which there are MANY practitioners. Buffet has LOVINGLY repudiated Graham's
teachings and made it safe for many so called “value” investors to invest LIKE
WARREN, if not with him.

Paul, you may not like to hear this but Buffet is not the only one who has
repudiated the original Graham doctrine. There is a long list of the most
successful investors practicing today who also have turned away from Graham.
Price, Sanborn, Gipson-Sandler, Longleaf, Sequoia, Miller of Legg Mason, Weitz,
Yacktman, Davis, Posner, Train, and Baron. Can you name me some successful,
well known investors who are practicing strict Grahamite methods?

Thought so. Why is that? Because, taking nothing away from Graham, who was an
excellent teacher, the state the art has passed those teachings by. This is a
good thing—learning. Let me add that, IMO, you aren't correct when you say that
this way of investing "can't be practiced" by the typical investor. I believe
your way has LESS practicality. Frictional costs are higher, and it is far less
tax efficient. You must also make two careful transactions, the first to buy,
then to sell.

Finally, let me leave you with something Bill Miller said in one of those
"esoteric" interviews published on the WWW:

"The market is pretty efficient and simple-minded stock selection--buy low P/E,
buy this, buy that--is highly unlikely to add a lot of value over time. At one
time they could. When no one was buying low P/E stocks, you could make a lot of
money doing that. You can't now."

Q:
So you wouldn't put much store in these historical studies, like
O'Shaughnessy's or Dreman's, that show the success of low-P/E strategies in the
past?

A:
"No, I do. Since the future hasn't happened yet, the past is the only thing you
have to work with. But I think that when you look at those things you really
have to be careful and put them in context. Let's see the context that gave
rise to them. Let's see why it might have worked. Let's see if it makes sense
with what we know about current finance theory. Let's get into it a little bit
as opposed to saying "Gee, I have these correlations and they sure do look
robust. Let's go invest this." It's like Buffett said, if all there was to
investing was looking up the data and figuring out the data, the richest people
in the world would be librarians."

Twister: re Sanborn and other mutual fund managers ala Graham.

Okay I will give you the point that there are no fund managers who strictly
follow Graham's methods. I'm not sure we can even agree on exactly what those
methods are -- he changed and adapted too, I believe. Even on this thread, we
have trouble agreeing on stocks that would be 'suitable' Graham investments.
Are there any fund managers who say they invest exactly like Warren Buffett AND
who can duplicate his success? (excluding mimickers like Ruane, Cunniff)

I will also stand corrected on Sanborn. In reviewing some more articles, I see
he uses cash flow as his "most important tool". One thing I have been wrestling
with in the past few weeks (in addition to wrestling with you - LOL!) has been
the stated methods that fund managers use versus their actual methods. For
example with Sanborn - in that interview I quoted - he says he uses methods --
talking with suppliers, customers, on-going relationships with the top company
officials - and the impression I got is that this is key to his success;
similar in another article (I can't recall where it is now,-- the extreme care
and effort he makes to track ALL takeovers, etc.) So the inference I got (and
maybe because it was intentially implied by Sanborn) -- is something like
"that's my method, that's why I'm successful, and as you can see this can only
be done by someone like me who runs a fund and has money and access to do these
things--that's what you are paying me for.) And if that's what he IS saying, I
agree, because I don't see how anyone -- any average investor like me anyway,
can duplicate what he does.

HOWEVER, when you actually look at stocks he says he is buying or has bought
recently-- they are, from what I can tell, nothing Ben Graham might take
objection to -- if I may be so presumptuous -- and many have been mentioned
here as value investments. My list from a recent Barron's article on Sanborn:
Nabisco, MO, BA, Nike, Mattel, Black & Decker, Washington Mutual. (Probably
could find some others if I checked Morningstar). But aren't these awfully
close to being Graham stocks anyway? Or Graham-Value stocks? So what's with his
stated methods? Who needs access to top management here when these stock prices
seem so compelling now --- to some of the people on this thread anyway.

Losing my logic here... forgot what I am arguing about -gg-- Because you seem
to believe you need to go beyond Graham to be successful, and I am saying I see
nothing in these stocks that is so un-Grahamlike? There's no buying these
stocks because of hidden assets, high tech, sophisticated cash flow analyses,
sophisticated knowledge of company managements? So it should be fairly easy for
a reasonable person to do-- just as you are saying about what Buffett says
about how his methods could be duplicated? Lost it here -- can't tell if I am
agreeing with you or disagreeing with you. -gg- Paul Senior

>>the point that there are no fund managers who strictly follow Graham's

But Paul, didn't you say in another post that these were his methods?

>>>On this, the Ben Graham value thread, it's entirely reasonable to assume
that I and others would be trying to use Ben Graham's methods to the extent
I/we understand them and that they apply to today's world. Thus, IMO there are
two recommended methods for valuing stocks (per B. Graham, FAJ, 1976): the
first is the "more limited technique of purchasing common stocks at less than
their working-capital value" and the second, which

"...consists of buying groups of stocks at less than their current or intrinsic
value as indicated by one or more simple criteria. The criterion I (Ben Graham)
prefer is seven times the reported earnings for the past 12 months. You can use
others - such as a current dividend return above seven per cent or book value
more than 120 per cent of price, etc. We are just finishing a performance study
of these approaches over the past half-century - 1925-1975. They consistently
show results of 15 per cent or better per annum, or twice the record of the
DJIA for this long period. I have every confidence in the threefold merit of
this general method based on (a)sound logic, (b) simplicity of application and
(c) an excellent supporting record. At bottom it is a technique by which true
investors can exploit the recurrent excessive optimism and excessive
apprehension of the speculative public." <<<

>>HOWEVER, when you actually look at stocks he (Sanborn) says he is buying or

This may be TRUE...but these stocks certainly don't come close to fitting
Graham's criteria as you and he spell it out.

Mattel, Black & Decker, Washington Mutual. (Probably could find some others if

By your definition, they are certainly NOT Graham style stocks in any way shape
or form. They are more like Buffet stocks. And how could they be both Paul?

>>and I am saying I see nothing in these stocks that is so un-Grahamlike? <<

Hmmm. Paul, you like to have your cake and eat it too, don't you?

>>So what's with his stated methods? <<

I gave you an inkling Paul in my last post but here is a refresher from the
interview.

Sanborn:
"Given that we have a long-term time horizon, we then have five guidelines. The
first is the most important. We like to buy stocks at 60% or less of their
underlying value. We define underlying value as the value of the business to an
owner who is going to own it forever and who understands the business
perfectly. One way we use to get at that value is to look very carefully at
transactions involving similar companies. We never look at price/earnings
ratios, and we don't care about dividend yields or price/book ratios because
none of those are relevant to what a business is worth to an owner."

How do you think old Ben would cozy up to that last sentence Paul?

>>Lost it here -- can't tell if I am agreeing with you or disagreeing with
you.<<

On THAT we CAN agree Paul!<g>

Check out SVIN. It's a California grape producer currently selling close to

3,600 acre land holding at the original purchase price of about $1,900 per
acre, and cultivated vineyard property is currently selling for as high as
$50,000 per acre... http://rereader.com/bergman/bergman1219.html . They have 3
lines of credit secured by acreage valued by their creditors at a very
conservative $5,000 to $9,000. Even if you ignore the $50,000 valuation and use
$9,000 per acre, the adjusted book value is close to $10. This means the stock

Twister, yes those were Graham's last reported methods that I could find.
However, he had two categories of investor, defensive and enterprising. Also,
dividend yields, which he appreciated, are now much less than they were in
1976. He liked consistency in dividends and earnings in some of his writings.
I'm looking here at page 209 of the Intelligent Investor. My belief is that in
l997 or 1998, when Philip Morris (a Sanborn buy)was posted here on the thread,
it was a value stock that Ben Graham would approve of - it would meet his
criteria in the Intelligent Investor which IMO he would have modified slightly
(like lowering the dividend %) to meet the times. MO may meet it now, I've not
checked. Boeing too, when it was posted here might qualify (although it has no
dividend) based on low price to past average earnings

As I mentioned in the last post, I have a real problem with what fund managers
SAY and what they actually do. Your question about how Graham would respond to
someone who has no use for price/book or div. yields or pe ratios - if Sanborn
actually meant what he said - that would shock Ben IMO. Or maybe not, since the
once great Sanborn was "up only 10% vs. 14% for the average stock fund" when
the Barron's article I am referring to came out.

I say bully for you if you've found the ratios Sanborn uses and are applying
them successfully. However, our discussion about Sanborn and other value
investors is no evidence that Graham's methods are invalid OR outdated for the
individual investor.

You have criticized posts here about stocks wherein the posters do not prove
that they are value stocks. I look forward to seeing posts from you which will
define those 1998-style value stocks you have bought -- ones which are not
dependent on pe ratios,div. yields, price/book or the cyclical nature of the
businesses.

Investor2: Thanks for responding. I just thought you were a growth investor
only. Pretty impressive portfolio of long term stocks you shared with us a few
months back.

Speaking about trying to catch falling knives,
and FWIW and any discussion, I've taken a small position in Central
Garden (CENT) Friday in 11+ range. Down about 3 points as it failed to meet
earnings estimates. I'll add more as, or if, it drops further. Per Yahoo, we're
looking at a bv of 19 and a psr of .39. I generally like distributors at such
prices. There's a likelihood (maybe a very strong likelihood), that CENT may
lose a very key supplier (which maybe is and should depress CENT's price). On
the other hand, CENT claims to have a "new and improved" grass seed that fights
some virus and consequently, save ranchers tons of money. IMO though, it's
worth a small bet. Bet being that we will once again see this stock at book
value or better (and assumes that bv will not decrease -g-).

Also, FWIW, started to again scale-up sell my position in WKR (hitting new
highs Fri.). Posted on here and bought by me in late '96, early '97 I think.
Many of these 2nd tier defense companies have done very well over the past year
