On EBSC, the analogy to your HGPI sale would be that Snyder might be willing to
sell a small amount at a price below $5.25, but would not be willing to sell a
large amount. Otherwise, they would have told the company to take the $5.25
offer. That is the only logical conclusion.

RJM:

Actually, (hgpi) I became interested and purchased shortly thereafter. I became
concerned though because of the debt loading and the difficulty in valuing the
properties.

On a different subject, I was interested in GTSI, but after further evaluation,
have concluded that it seems like a marginal net/net at best. The reason is
that the recievables are nearly equal to the payables on the balance sheet. The
inventories are what you are hoping will hold the company value up, and I dont
think computer hardware inventories hold there value that well. (I had a buy
order in at 3 but decided to cancel it. I may re-enter if it drops to about 2.7
however)

On another vein, I compared it to SPOR and have concluded that SPOR even though
it is up 20% from where I first bought it seems to be about the best net/net
out there for now. No debt, assets which are in cash or seem to be readily
converted into cash. Looks like a great deal to me.
I have a few other net/nets I am evaluating and will post if I find anything
interesting.

HGPI...
I have missed their last 2 conference calls but finally got a transcript of the
last one. The deal with the original buyer is done with. Over. I had thought
they were still working a deal on 3 properties with them.
The good news is several of their properties may be worth more for something
OTHER than outlet malls and by shopping them individually, they will bring a
better price.
As for GTSI, I am going to figure that the 13-d buyer who continues to
accumulate around $3+ is more knowledgeable about the value of the inventory
than either of us. So, a net-net with a savvy industry insider buying the heck
out of it and volatility to boot. I never did get a large enough position
however.

DIR/VP 15,000 B 8/22/00 - 8/7/00 $0.72 - $0.53 - 150,000 D 9/28/00 .

I do not know ISSI. However, these kind of stocks are now breaking support
levels and still have ridiculous trailing P/E's (37 in this case). The
semiconductor industry is a growth cyclical industry. If it was copper you
would see trailing P/E's on peak earnings of 6-8. Add some secular growth to
the mix and P/E's should be 5 times as high? Not in my opinion. My SEMI, which
I have mentioned on this thread, the 5th largest semiconductor distributor, is
growing both sales and earnings as fast as any semiconductor manufacturer.
After the Q3 report, it will have a trailing P/E of 9 at $20, which is a sane

I said that SEMI at $20 was a "sane valuation". I did not intend that anyone
buy it at that price. SEMI won't resist a sustained downtrend in tech stocks,
and low P/E's can get lower. That said, SEMI will do about $150M sales for Q3,
and make around $1, with a book/bill over 120%. The recently announced addition
of the large ON semiconductor line will add to future sales levels and adds a
measure of insurance against a near term downturn in results. (Long term the
semiconductor business is cyclical and all companies related to the industry
will eventually experience a downturn in results.)

Buying RGR today @ 7 15/16.

Negatives are: the gun business and the titanium golf shafts which are not
selling so well. Overall sales don't seem to be growing. Entrenched management.

Positives: 10% dividend yield. Very good ROE, high margins, no debt, low pe.
For Buffett followers, this is a stock owned by "buddy" Ruane Cuniff. Stock is
at multi-year low.

If the stock can get back to 12 or more where it occasionally has traded in
years '95-'98 sometime again in the next few years, that, coupled with a 10%
yield (if it's maintained), would turn out to be a pretty decent investment

I never have liked foreign stocks. Heck, reading their quarterly PR gave me a

Plus,they burned 20 cents last quarter. The market always discounts money

Looks like a bio-tech that was SOLD onto the public and now has little support.
If you know & understand the science, it might be a good play. A "pop" back to
$3 seems possible next year.

Its probably beyond my circle of competence (incompetence ?) and so I would
probably wait for some form 4's (insider buying)to show me the way.
I have seen a lot of these kind just piss away their monies rather quickly too.
Take CRTQ for example, it was a failed bio-tech, taken over by a value guy, now
they trade at around cash per share and still own all the technology rights, he
just turned off the R&D and spending and will only do a deal if others put $
up. I am hoping it will get marked down below cash like it did last year so I

business and integrating and bundling all of its stuff. This is a far cry from
a branded monopolistic business. there are management issues now and there may
be management issues in the future. I think that att overpaid for many of its
recent purchases because it had no choice. As far as intel- it has to transform

What about AMD as a value play. ESp. because INTC's warning may be due to AMD's
competition. It sells at $22 with analysts estimate of EPS for FY2000 of $2.55
(and I think that estimate is low. In the first half it all ready earned $1.18,
and its ramping up its capability to produce high end chips rapidly. (its
basicly replaceing K6s wich sell for about $50, with Athlon's that sell can
sell for hundreds of dollars each, while ramping up the Dresden fab so that it
can sell more chips overall). KLIC is another stock I own that seems really

One positive buying signal - for me anyway - is that my pride/shame ratio is

On USG, I briefly owned a sizeable company Eagle Picher many years ago, which
eventually went under because of asbestos liability. Two key issues are how
fast is their liability changing over time, presumably available from SEC
filings, and is it funded on their balance sheet. You have to make a guess as
to where the liability will eventually end up and how much extra cash will be
needed. If you can do this and they are still OK, then it is worth looking at.
If you are unable to make this analysis, then I would respectfully say that you
are not considering the most important investment factor, and are gambling.

at higher levels as does the Saudi Prince Warren (of course he also bought

Another ratio on EK, a more tangible one. I believe EK trades at an enterprise

I have been following this thread for a while. This is 1st post. I want to
agree with those here that think EK is worth a look. Current price/cash-flow is
cheap and somewhere down the road their large R&D budget may actually provide
some kick to earnings (ie growth). Only makes sense at this price if the buggy
whip argument is true, and soon. If this idea appeals, I recomend looking at
LEAPS (i.e. Jan of '02 or '03). They are extremely cheap (30% volatility)...one
get's tremendous leverage without nearly the cash outlay...plus can hold for
long term cap gains.

Also, wanted to mention PBI. Got hit Thurs on earnings miss (by only 2c on a
65c est.) and reduced forward est. Definitely some technology risk here... but,
dominant market leader in its segment...reasonable balance sheet, 13% L.T.
growth, strong free cash-flow...and trades at just over 10x last yrs earnings.
My bias is it's being trashed because of what has happened to X...but only 7%

Last thing...I have seen lots of favorable posts on T....curious why there's

murmur how wise you are for picking up such a wonderful company/opportunity.
And before you tell them what you've done (bought that particular stock), you
already know deep down that that is what their response will be.

Some examples could be: Someone who says (last year) "I bought Cisco. It just
keeps going up. How can you lose with such a great company, right?"

or: "I'm buying MSFT on dips - it'll come back." (or 6 month's ago: "I have a
lot of Microsoft, it's growth and future are terrific.")

JDS Uniphase was/is another imo. Okay I admit I'm not technical, but I still
suspect that when I see old line portfolio managers say they've added this one
or others like it to their portfolios - they don't really know what they have.
(Maybe they're following the analysts who they employ). To me though, a big
reason it's added is because it's a stock du jour. Other competitor funds have
added it. It's high pride/shame ratio is thus a factor getting it into the fund
(imo).

To me, a high pride/shame ratio is an indicator of a stock I want to stay away
from buying. Maybe it's something about I'm fearful everybody who wants in is
now in, so where's the stock going to go?

For low pride/shame, one of my personal category choices has been utilities. In
the past 6 months, I've bought three. Never owned any before that. Too
embarrassed though to even mention those selections on the value thread -- now
that suggests a very high shame component indeed. -g-. --- Although the ratio's
come up a lot in my mind now that I see Warren Buffett has bought some.

Re: SKO. I'm underwater on it. I'm considering adding more to my position here
though. It's another one with low pride/shame. As when I might discuss this
with people outside of this thread (and maybe even with some people here -g-),
I envision them saying (or wanting to say -g-), "A stock that seems to be
having troubles and is trading at a multi-year low? A small retail company that
competes with Wal-Mart? Senior, you idiot, guess why they're having troubles
and their stock is down. And don't you know the retail sector is terrible?
Shopko? ShopKo?? Whoever heard of them? Where do you find dreck like this?"

Wallace: USG, I picked up some during this downdraft after having sold a prior
position at a profit a while back. Marty has/had 500k+ shares @~30 based on
last report of his fund. Said it was the first asbestos exposed position he's
had, but that he thought the asbestos exposure was over discounted. The
asbestos risk is a wild card that is very difficult to quantify given legal
system, but average settlements are way lower than OWC owing to nature of
product - joint compound, primarily. Jeff Bash's point about difficulty of
nailing asbestos risk down is well taken and I do consider this a gamble. Read
the 10k for a pretty good coverage of it. Lehman put out a report on Armstrong
that gives excellent coverage of asbestos issue if you have access to their
stuff.
Beyond the asbestos, you have declining drywall prices due to capacity that has
come on line to offset shortages in 1999. Estimates are begining to converge on

TwoBear - I see the pride/shame ratio as a subset of the emotional aspect to be
considered in investing. And, in spite of efforts (especially by analytical
types or formulaic investors) to remove, minimize or deny the emotions from the
buy decision (and from the sell decision which is even more emotional), it is
not possible to remove or even overcome the emotional aspect. It can only be
dealt with or buried. If buried, it sometimes returns in financially harmful
ways. These ways could involve, for example: setting inappropriate arbitrary
stop orders to prevent (minimize) stock losses; having excessive, perhaps
exclusive, reliance on TA; or buying high pride stocks exclusively.

Paul S.
(And I do not mean to imply I'm better than anybody else when it comes to this
aspect. For example, I am either denying my emotions with SKO (or dealing with
it - I can't tell -g-) by figuring that SKO is another rote investment for me -
it has a very low relative price, very low p/bv, very low p/sales, low pe - it
fits my model, ergo, I'm buying a small quantity. Perhaps the "small quantity"
aspect lets me avoid coming to grips with the difficult emotional aspects of
buying, holding, understanding SKO if it made up say 8% of my portfolio.

Grommit, here are the utilities which I've bought:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=eix+lnt+nor&d=t

A positive (for me) is that EIX has been purchased by Warren Buffett at higher
prices than now (it is reported).
A negative is that since his purchase an EIX subsidiary (that supplies energy
in Southern California) has had to purchase power from outside companies to the
tune of at least $1B (it's more - I don't have the figures), and the state
gov't regulators are saying that the company should not charge back this
expense to rate payers (i.e. the stockholders might be forced to eat the
expense).
I've been adding to my position.

NOR is involved in several businesses. Very aggressive in increasing sales (BUT
lots of debt too.). Dividends, eps are increasing. Low p/sales. Stock's near a
low for past couple of years. Might work out for a "Mom's" account (assuming
Mom is diversified with her stock investments and will hold NOR for 18 months
or more and be happy meanwhile with the dividend and maybe its possible
increase.)

LNT - another one with many businesses. Increasing sales, fluctuating earnings,
lots of debt. Little too expensive to buy right now, imo.

I'm starting positions in EGLS and ADIC.

EGLS has a pe of 10, sells at 2x cash, and has 0 ltd. Marty Whitman (per Yahoo)
is a large shareholder. This stock, now about 15, has in most recent years (not
'98) sold at some point for $20 or more. I will bet that it sells again for
more than $20.

ADIC sells roughly at 2.4x book, 3x cash and has 0 ltd. Psr is still high at
2.7. Although all 5 analysts in Yahoo site have a moderate or better buy on the
stock, the expected pe next year will be 20. That's absolutely high (imo), but
relative to past years, it's not too bad. There's some insider buying recently
at about current price level. Fortune mag. has it as one of its 100 fastest
growing companies. (That could be the kiss of death -g-)

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/000829/wa_adic.html

Imo, value investors face a difficult time now with tech stocks. There appear
to be many choices from which to select. Also, I sense that all these stocks
are continuing to drop each day. This leads to the logical refrain of why buy
now, even if the stock is a value? It'll be cheaper tomorrow.

My general philosophy is to buy when I see value. Some of these value stocks
could get chopped 50% from current prices. OTOH, we might still see a favorable
October for tech. My strategy is to buy small amounts and prepare to lag in (if
the stock drops). So at least I've got something going if the market turns
favorable. Secondly, I will try to be diversified by buying a number of these
tech stocks. Since I'm assuming I might have to hold these stocks 18-24 months
or longer, my preference is to go with companies that have little debt and lots
of cash, which to my mind, provides me (and the companies) with a margin of
safety until better times arrive.

Hello everyone:
I'm going to mention an equity which may be of interest. I'm going to start
with all the disclaimers:
This is an extremely speculative investment with a high risk/reward profile -
proceed with caution. I own it in a big way, so I'll either be a hero or a
goat. It is illiquid and can be easily manipulated IMHO, and has a very
checkered history, being on the brink of bankruptcy at one time. This post is a
tout, as I own the stock. Like Paul, I have been wrong many, many times. Have I
scared you enough?!
MEXP is a microcap E&P play with interests primarily in the Mississippi salt
dome area, natural gas being its primary product. It will post earnings I
believe on Friday with a CC (I am going to be out town, so I am not totally
sure of these facts). Already this year through Q2 it has cash flowed positive
69 cents. Although the company is hedged to some degree, I think we all know
what a great environment we are currently in for energy, and it certainly has
improved since Q2. The company trades for around stated book value.
If, a big if, the CC and earnings release are positive, this stock could
continue to trend higher IMHO.
JMO, and good luck to all.
If I'm off base on this perception of MEXP, please don't hesitate to inform me!

D. Nadworny: Adding to my exploratory position in GT today.

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=gt

I see it this way: While there's some good stuff in the balance sheet history
(such as price below book value, and low price to sales), overall I (and I'm no
expert) call it poor (or worse) because there's no growth in revenue and yet to
get where they are now, they had to double debt.

There's a good dividend yield. But it's pretty high (relatively) which "could",
"maybe", "perhaps" signal that it's unsustainable. If the dividend were to be
cut, imo it's possible that GT could sell for the p/e's that auto parts
suppliers are going for (say maybe 4). That would mean, I'd guess, that the
price of GT could be halved.

I'm buying GT because they are the dominant tire manufacturer, they likely will
find a way to stay in business, the stock is at a nine year low and not much
has changed in the nine years. That is, competition is still tough, radials
last a long time, there's not much money to be made in oem sales. Still, GT
perseveres.

-------
This stock would normally, have a low pride/shame ratio. As in: "Tire company?
How the heck can anyone make money in a tire company? You buy Goodyear, you got
dead money. Buy Sun Micro. It's dropped and it'll come back."
However, the Firestone debacle upgrades the pride/shame ratio, as in "Hmm. Yes,
I can see that. GT gets the business that Firestone loses." (Aside: analysts
have lowered their outlook for GT because, in spite of the Firestone issue, the
weak Euro and other factors are stronger influences.) I also point out, that I
notice in Yahoo that both Templeton Growth and Bernstein (Sanford) are holders.
My first reaction is: "Sheesh. You gotta be kidding. I can't believe guys like
this would by this junk." (I can dance around the both sides of the pride/shame
ratio apparently -g- and at the same time -g-). After reflecting a bit, I
conclude though if it was value stock enough for them, I'm glad to be holding
too. Pride/shame ratio increases. --And as I looked back to check some spelling
I see now that Brandes and Franklin Resources have positions as well. If I'm
correct that all these guys are value players, then imo, now would be a decent
time for value investors here to consider having GT in their portfolio.

RAGS, a long time net-net had their best year in the last 6.
"Rag Shops, Inc. Reports Increases in Fiscal Year Results
HAWTHORNE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 11, 2000--Rag Shops Inc. (NASDAQ:RAGS -
news), a specialty retailer of crafts and fabrics is pleased to report the
fiscal year ended September 2, 2000 was a year of significant improvement.

Total sales for the fiscal year were $100 million, marking the first time the
Company reached the $100 million sales plateau, which represents an increase of
5.7% over the prior fiscal year. Sales from stores opened at least one year
increased by 4.2%. Sales include one additional week this fiscal year which
amounted to $1,529,000. Without the additional week total sales increased 4.1%
while sales from stores opened at least one year increased by 2.5%.

When the audit for our fiscal year end is complete, we anticipate reporting on
or about November 13, 2000 our highest net income for the preceding six fiscal
years. This increase is attributable to improved operating efficiencies, the
additional one week, as mentioned above, and improved inventory shrinkage
results. Moreover, while of recent we are virtually debt free most of the
fiscal year, this past August marked the first time in our history since the
June 5, 1991 initial public offering that we are debt free at the end of the
fiscal year.

Rag Shops, Inc. was operating sixty-five stores at September 2, 2000. Rag
Shops, Inc. President Michael Aaronson stated ``we are moving into the new
fiscal year with great momentum and wonderful new opportunities. We have plans
to open new stores in New Jersey, New York, New York City and Connecticut. The
first of which will open on October 15th in New Jersey. Additionally,
development is under way for the design of a new 20,000 square foot prototype
Rag Shop store''. We anticipate opening three of these new prototype stores in
the fall of 2001. The Company plans to close three stores in the new fiscal
year."

When Janus filed so that they could (not necessarily would) sell their large
position, I figured that if they threw in the towel, it'd crush the stock - or
at least keep a damper on it for a while. Just the news itself would drive the
stock down and I'd be selling at the very low. Which seems to have happened.
OTOH, in today's market, maybe Janus' actual selling process could drive the
price lower still. I am betting that 31 days from now, I can repurchase (if I
want) HLTH at near today's price or lower.

Long term, since the company is fairly new and unique and potentially important
in the health care field, I expect its stock to have quite a bit of volatility
as it gets and loses media attention and as investors wax and wane in
enthusiasm for its prospects.

Armin, I can't predict worth a darn. Not one day, let alone 31.

Correct me here if I'm wrong. I'm figuring that the HLTH shares are distributed
among several Janus funds, and that the Janus filing on HLTH will mean the
managers of each fund are now free to make buy or sell decisions regarding
HLTH.
So some, maybe not all, but some funds will sell. And maybe enough to influence
the market.

Regardless, I figure I just have got to cull more losers out of my portfolios
to offset the net gains I'm showing on my running Schedule D's. To my mind,
some of the losers rather than being sell candidates, instead invite additional
commitments now (such as CIT or TKR), and so I'm keeping them.

Grommit,

My friend also suggested VSH. I remember it from 1996
and it seems a reasonable bet, though it would be
difficult to choose VSH against NSM or TXN. Its ROE
is spotty and low. They cleaned up some debt though.
NSM is in similar situation valuation and ROE wise.
TXN is better co, but still more expensive.

Semi-equips are simple: Buy super-low, sell high.
It does not matter which one you buy - they all go up
in unison. AMAT may be an exception. I would not buy
LRCX since it competes with AMAT. It matters that
semi-equips may go from "low" where they are now to
"super low" - ridiculous prices. Last time ASYT
bottomed below cash-per-share with no debt!
So keep some powder dry.
Also don't get caught up in cycle discussions on SI
or somewhere else. The secret is: Nobody knows where the
cycle is going. Not even AMAT's CEO.

Take care and good luck

re: "First tech stock I've bought...in two years." Imo, since I believe you're
not a techie, that would suggest you are buying AAPL on a price to value
proposition. (As opposed to being in love with their products, technically
astute about their R&D vis-a-vis competitors, etc.). My opinion is that AAPL at
current price has low relative price and a low price to cash, no debt, high
ROE. I suggest it is a buy, but not an either/or buy. (That is, to buy just
AAPL in the tech sector or buy nothing technical at all) 

I propose that AAPL should be bought as part of a package of tech companies all
of which have low price, low price to cash, no debt, high ROE. And there are a
number of such companies from which to pick. AAPL is only unique in that it has
high brand recognition and is a large company. (That uniqueness though may be
quite enough. I don't know.) For me anyway, as a non-tech person, being
diversified among tech issues seems the safest and best way to minimize risks
while giving myself a shot at some good gains.

I'll put AAPL on my watch list. Thanks. Paul.

KDUS..appears to be worth 40 cents per share and they lost 5 cents last
quarter. Is the $19 million really returned ?
Is it OVER ? Or can it be appealed again by the other side ?

CRTQ is a bio-tech shell trading at about cash and has stopped the bleeding.
Some insider buying too.

I guess your .40 per share doesn't include the 19.5 million. It's over--it's a
Federal Court of Appeals case. The only possibilities for the other side are a
request for rehearing, the time for which has expired (I haven't been able to
find out if they indeed filed for rehearing or not). Winning on rehearing is
very unlikely. The other possibility is to petition the US Supreme Ct. for
certiorari. The likelihood of Rehnquist and the gang granting that request is
basically zero. So..... as I said before, KDUS has about 92 cents per share in
cash, so I don't think you can say it's worth 4o cents/share. Plus, they have
royalty income for patent(s) and own a certain percentage of Axiom, the value
of which is discussed in the depths of the Kadus thread on SI.

I simply took the last reported book value and divided by shares outstanding.
I tend to like to see insider buying in biotechs because of my inability to
judge what any technology is worth.

I do know about burn rates however.

They have one employee, i.e. they're a shell, so unless his salary is
humongous, I don't think there's much of a burn rate to worry about.

David: yes, I know that distraught feeling (that the bank robber had) very
well.

If I owned only steel stocks, for example. They all seem to be down. Let's see.
I still have X, AKS, LTV, and STTX that make the stuff, BOYD that transports
it, CLF that provides the iron ore pellets, and UCR that makes graphite rods
consumed by mini-mills. Rather than average down now, I'll just add another one
today: ROU. The industry eventually will recover (I will bet), and while these
stocks will never again be popular, they should, at some point, better reflect
improved business. Unless of course there's been a fundamental shift in either
demand (competitive products have been permanently substituted for steel), or
perhaps that imports have permanently altered US made steel as a viable (in the
sense of profitable) industry.

fwiw, I'm adding today to my position in CIT, although I'm still considering
FNV. It's scary to me though that FNV has dropped so much but CIT, although
testing annual low, nevertheless still trades at a much higher comparative
price than FNV. That is, I don't know if FNV problems are specific to it or are
industry-wide. I am hoping CIT is still outlooking eps not worse than the $2.37
- $2.43 which they stated in their 2Q, 7/27 report.

Paul, I am looking at RGR too. Like you, I am interested in the dividend and
also think that there's some upside to the story, provided that the business
don't lose too much steam ahead of us...

As a dividend play, I also like FUN. You probably know that it's been a very
good performer in the past. If you compare it to KO on a graph over 10 years,
you'll be surprised to see how well it has done.

Regarding RGR, I'd say, on the negative side, that it's definitely not a
politically correct investment. As for the law suits, IMO they are futile and
irrelevant, but they still have an effect on the stock price, I guess.

I would ask a few questions at this stage: Do you think that the dividend is
secure? When was the last time management has raised it? What will it do with
the cash? Is an acquisition a possibility or, at the very least, could we
expect a special dividend or a share repurchase program?

What's your opinion?

Marc Fortier: re RGR, FUN

Yes, good performance over time for FUN, and interesting comparison to KO:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=fun&d=my&c=ko

FUN's always paid a good div. (if I recall correctly). Sorry I didn't buy it a
few years back when they had accidents on their park rides which resulted in
stock drop.
Now that it's trading at multi year lows, I'll have to relook at it.

RGR dividend seems protected. (no long term debt, no insiders seem to be
selling, company still very (imo) profitable.) Looks like dividend was last
raised (from .70 to .80) in 1996.

I'm indifferent as to the choices RGR make with their cash flow; I'm just glad
that they have the money for choices. I'd prefer they use the money for
business expansion. OTOH, they've expanded into titanium casting (for golf
clubs), and that doesn't seem to me to be such a great business (My impression
only - I'm no expert.) They've not bought back stock; now might be the time to
begin. I believe the stock is closely held so stock buybacks would likely
concentrate ownership much further. OTOH, RGR might be at the point where, to
provide a broad market for their stock, they might prefer to not to increase
concentration further. (Aside: my general philosophy and belief about dividends
is that a company can have any kind of dividend policy - pay no dividends, have
a constant dividend, occasionally increase dividends, increase div. every year
- but once the policy is set, it MUST be maintained. If RGR were to cut its
dividend that would send a terrible message to the investment community - and
churn its stockholder base, imo. So, imo it's not an option for RGR to reduce
the div. to redeploy those funds elsewhere internally.)

I assume at this point (new lows in RGR, dividend approaching 11%), we have to
be saying to ourselves that it's becoming apparent that we've missed something
here, that business is worse than we expected, or legal difficulties and
exposure and costs are much worse than we believed, or some other horrible
thing is out there that the insiders/smart money know about and is causing them
to sell out of the stock. I'll assume though that the bad news is already
known, that even if business declines (guns as well as golf clubs), RGR will
remain profitable and maintain its dividend and eventually, business will
improve. So I am assuming there's now tax loss selling in RGR and weak hands
are exiting positions. I'll likely add a little more to my RGR position on the
premise that I'll benefit two-fold: The dividend yield is effectively increased
from this lower base, and the capital gain I expect a couple years from now is
higher.(i.e. I'll still look for a stock price of at least 12, but now off an
even lower base).

Thanks for your answer Paul. IMO, tax selling must be the main reason why the
stock is experiencing such pressure right now. Earlier this year, the agreement
signed by Smith & Wesson has probably spooked a lot of investors. (I haven't
researched this part very well yet, but S&W made it clear that without this
agreement, their survival was in jeopardy; that tells a lot about the costs
related to defend such a cause before a court, even though management was
pretty sure to win it at the end).

As for golf club casting, I'd say that it must effectively be a bad business.
Being a golfer, I know too well how golf manufacturers are switching materials
every now and then. Three or four years ago, titanium was the big thing. Next
year who knows, maybe they will use a material tested on the space shuttle...
Bye! Bye! titanium...

Sport-Haley Announces Delay in Filing of Form 10-K; Restatement Pending of
Financial Statements for Years Ended June 30, 1999 and 1998
DENVER, Oct 16, 2000 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Sport-Haley, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPOR
chart, msgs) today announced that its filing of the Form 10-K for the year
ended June 30, 2000 has been delayed and that it currently expects the Form
10-K for the 2000 fiscal year to be filed during the week of October 23, 2000.

In July 2000, Sport-Haley announced that its audit committee had recommended
that the prior independent auditors be discharged and that the Company retain a
new independent public accountant to audit the financial statements for the
year ended June 30, 2000. As a result of a review initiated by senior
management and conducted prior to completion of the audit process for the
Company's 2000 fiscal year, information was developed that indicated certain
accounting errors may exist in prior years' financial statements that, when
corrected, would result in a material impact on results of operations for the
2000 fiscal year and certain prior periods. At the conclusion of the review,
the Company determined that the accounting errors required restatement of the
financial statements for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998. The errors
consist primarily of the following: (i) incorrect recording, classification and
valuation of inventory work in process; (ii) incorrect recording of certain
prepaid and fixed assets; (iii) incorrect accounting for the acquisition of the
Company's wholly-owned subsidiary and the related minority interest in the loss
of the subsidiary; and (iv) incorrect recording of certain losses relating to
discontinued operations.

The Company has requested its independent accounting firm that was retained
following the year ended June 30, 2000 to re-audit the financial statements for
the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, which the Company is restating. The
restatement is expected to result in a material increase in reported net income
for the year ended June 30, 2000 and a reduction of net income in at least one
of the two prior years' financial statements. The audit committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company has retained an independent consultant to assist it
in evaluating the restatements that are necessary in order that the Company's
financial statements, as restated and taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the Company's financial position, results of operations and
cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1998, 1999 and 2000, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The audit committee
of the Board of Directors does not believe that the errors that have been
identified by the Company constitute irregularities."

How exactly can you restate several years income and it NOT constitute
irregularities ? Does this mean that restatements are regular for SPOR ?

fwiw, adding a little more to my small holdings of TRW today.

Stock, at 37, near its five year lows, is down like all the the other auto
parts suppliers. This quarter, maybe next, don't look so great. Ford's problem
(Firestone) also becomes a TRW problem.

I bet though, that we'll see 50 once more (at least -g-) in the next 12 months.

fwiw, selling some AHP to buy more TKR.

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=tkr

Timken's a pretty sharp company in the bearings business. (-g- although sharp
maybe isn't the word to use when talking about bearings).

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=tkr

Stockholders are suffering. Stock at a five year low. Debt's been increasing,
ROE, ROA never great, are lousy now; and sales growth is poor (all imo).

Still, p/sales is relatively low as is price/book. There's a 5.5 % dividend
yield. In a couple of years, we "should" be seeing better earnings and/or
outlook for TKR. I see the stock possibly then selling for $25 or more (1.5x
book, where it's occasionally been before).

Given TKR's excellent reputation, business longevity, current low price, and
good dividend yield, I'd call Timken a suitable bet for a Mom's account. (Mom
might not want to be selling AHP to buy it though. -g-)
