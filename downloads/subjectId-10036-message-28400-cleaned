In a recent presentation from CNE which I attended, this dividend cut question
was asked. He alerted investors to watch for the payout ratio for any
particular trust. If anytime the payout ratio is over 50%, expect a dividend
cut to occur in short order.

Question: Is there a good site to find the payout ration for the various
trusts?

I wish I were more of an accounting type so as to understand exactly how these
companies do it. The short answer is that these companies pay their
distributions out of cash flow, and not out of earnings.

At the risk of attempting to tell you how the watch is made, when all you
wanted to know was the time of day, let me clip and show a couple of quotes
from the most recent quarterly reports from both ERF and HTE.

From the ERF report for the 2nd quarter ended 6/30/2007:

http://biz.yahoo.com/cnw/070802/enerplus_q2_2007.html?.v=2

---------------------------------------------------------
"Cash flow from operating activities and cash distributions are reported on the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. During the second quarter of 2007 cash
distributions of $162.6 million were funded entirely through cash flow of
$237.5 million. Our payout ratio, which is calculated as cash distributions
divided by cash flow, was 68% for the three months ended June 30, 2007 compared
to 78% for the same period in 2006. For the six months ended June 30, 2007 our
cash distributions were $320.3 million and were funded entirely through cash
flow of $430.7 million. Our payout ratio for the six months ended June 30, 2007
was 74% compared to 79% for the six months ended June 30, 2006."
---------------------------------------------------------
And also this:

---------------------------------------------------------
"For the three months ended June 30, 2007 our cash distributions exceeded our
net income by $122.5 million (2006 - $8.3 million) however net income includes
$167.4 million of non-cash items (2006 - $71.1 million) that do not impact our
cash flow. For the six months ended June 20, 2007 our cash distributions
exceeded our net income by $172.3 million (2006 - $31.3 million) which includes
$296.5 million of non-cash items (2006 - $160.2 million) that do not impact our
cash flow."
-----------------------------------------------------------

For HTE, from the 2nd quarter report ended 6/30/2007:

http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/070813/0290190.html

-------------------------------------------------------
"Funds From Operations of $244.5 million ($1.83 per trust unit) generated in
the second quarter have exceeded any other interim period in our history, and
resulted in our payout ratio declining to 63% from 68% in the previous quarter
and from 79% in the second quarter of 2006. Our total Funds From Operations
exceeded the aggregate amount of our declared distributions plus capital
investment, giving us a capital adjusted payout ratio (distributions declared
plus capital expenditures divided by total Funds From Operations) of 87%. This
considerable improvement in our simple and capital adjusted payout ratios
reflects the addition of Funds From Operations from our refining and marketing
business as well as reduced losses on 2007 commodity price risk management
contracts relative to 2006."
----------------------------------------------------------

Note that in the case of HTE, their distributions PLUS capital expenditures was
only 87% of their total funds from operations.

I am relatively new to both of these companies, having bought them within the
last couple of years. HTE was formed by some kind of merger in 2005. I have no
knowledge of the prior companies operations.

It seems to me there are a number of factors that affect the market price of
these companies, besides the obvious one that the price they receive for their
oil and natural gas production has a major impact on their ability to continue
and perhaps increase their distributions.

1. Politics. The recent law changes in Canada that will make these trusts
subject to taxation starting in 2011. 3+ years away. Very hard to anticipate
future changes in law, corporate structures, etc. Also a recent recommendation
in Alberta that the royalties they pay be increased. As of this moment I
believe no firm decision has been reached. The companies are of course lobbying
against such changes.

2. Acquisition possibilities by major oil companies in order to acquire
reserves, or obtain positions in the oil sands. The announcement referred to in
the Kiplinger report may be the beginning of such interest.

3. Increasing costs in Alberta. Huge inflation in housing and all other
infrastructure costs as a result of the oil sands boom.

4. Technology. There are several interesting developments in recovery methods
of the bitumen and oil from the sands, as well as reservoir recovery software
being developed, that may enhance future recovery prospects and extend reserve
life.

5. Currency translation. It wasn't that many years ago that the loonie was
about .75 to the dollar; now about par. For U.S. investors, that trend is good,
because the amount distributed (in Canadian dollars) is not reduced thru the
differential rate. Future currency moves? Anybody's guess.

I am new to these companies, having bought both within the last 18 months or
so. In the case of HTE, which distributes .38/monthly, my speculation is that
they may have to cut to, let's say, .25/monthly. That is 3.00/yr. After
withholding a 15% Canadian income tax (potentially recoverable from the IRS
depending on several income factors), that would amount to 2.55/yr. AFTER tax.
Still a very attractive yield with the stock at 26.50 or so, down from a recent
34. I will be quite content to hold at that yield, since I anticipate that the
market reaction will not be particularly severe, if as another poster here
posits, the current market price is partly based on the anticipation of reduced
distributions.

The quarterlies links shown above are extremely detailed as to the operations
of both HTE and ERF. IMO they are worth a look and at least a brief reading to
give a feel for their business models. Suffice to say, I am sufficiently
impressed by their ongoing operations, accounting, and growth plans to be very
happy holding the stocks. I'm betting that the distributions continue and in
all likelihood will increase over the next few years. Although I think $65 oil
may come in the next year or so, my guess is that Asian growth will push the
price much higher over the next few years. I'm not a peak oil nut, but $100 by
2010 would not surprise me.

A final note: the various oil sands and Canroy boards on SI offer a wealth of
info, some opinion but a lot of it pretty well informed, about Alberta
companies and what is going on up there.

Hi Jurgis - I added to my earlier purchase of ConocoPhillips (COP). COP
acquired significant Natural Gas reserves in December 2005 through their
acquisition of Burlington Resources. You can see from this report that they
almost doubled their NG reserves
(http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/finance/mergers/cpbrindex.html ).

The price ratio of Oil/NG is at a 21 year high as a result of the depressed NG
prices. I expect that NG should increase in value relative to the current Oil
prices in the next five years. Of the integrated oil companies, COP owns the
largest proven NG reserves.

The forward PE is estimated to fall from 13 to 9 and COP currently maintains a
current book value of $52/share. The dividend at 2% is about in the middle
range what the other integrated oils pay.

Don't cry. KONG was up 50% or something couple days after I sold it. ;) And
let's not look at that pesky RTRSY since 2002. ;) (Which might be a great short
now, since I have no clue how the stock is still rising while sales and
earnings are declining and the valuation is totally gross, but then I don't
short stocks.)

If you consider a position fairly valued or overpriced and having no great
future, you have to sell it. Otherwise you will cry when it drops back to
underpriced level. ;) And even if it rises at some point you have to sell.

Partial sales are possible if you have large position and think that stock is
fairly valued, not very overvalued and you still see some positive future
developments.

I will disagree with Paul on stubs. Stubs are nice, but they don't solve the
problem. Assuming you leave 1/10th of a position as a stub, even if stock
doubles, you get only 1/10=10% gain from original position. Even if it triples,
you get 1/10*2= 20% gain. These may be OK, but you have to keep eye on the
stub, decide when to sell it - which is in itself very hard, since you already
sold the original stock as overvalued - etc. Too much trouble. BTW,
realistically if stock just goes up 30% or 50%, you get only 3-5% additional
return if you manage to sell the stub at the top...

Alternatively, you could sell all position and buy a call for 1/10th of its
value. Also not a good solution, since you can lose that money...

Unfortunately, it seems that net-nets or cash-nets are the ones that rally past
sell-points most of the time. Normal Buffettology/nice-ROE companies usually
don't drop as low and don't rally as fast as net-nets. Since I also lose
opportunities at selling net-nets below their rally points, I was trying to
figure out the price for which I should hold, but I have not reached a good
solution. Problem for me is that it's very tough to assign a fair-value to a
cigar butt net-net. I know how to assign it to a steady company that earns X%.
With net-nets, usually they are not earning anything, so the rallies are
usually based on changed expectations, but not actual results. So it's very
hard to say whether they will go to 1.5book, 2xbook, 3xbook or some other
level.

OK enough rambling. ;)

Bullish news for Natural Gas and TransCanada (TRP) - Perhaps this is why TRP is
up over 6% in the current week.

The Associated Press Published: October 5, 2007
Feds OK US-Mexico pipeline project that will bring more imports
http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/05/business/NA-FIN-US-Imported-Natural-G
s-Mexico.php
From the article:"...A federal regulatory agency has authorized a Canadian
pipeline company, Calgary, Alberta-based TransCanada Corp., to modify the U.S.
segment of a pipeline from Mexico to allow it to carry natural gas into Arizona
and California....The modifications approved by the Federal Regulatory
Commission involve nearly tripling the pipeline's capacity and allowing it to
carry gas north into the United States as well as southbound...."

The Value Proposition:

In the last decade, between 29 percent and 42 percent of California’s in-state
generation used natural gas. Another 10 percent to 20 percent was provided by
hydroelectric power that is subject to significant annual variations.

Almost one-third of California’s entire in-state generation base is more than
40 years old.

Fifteen percent to 30 percent of statewide electricity demand is served from
sources outside state borders.

Peak demand is growing at about 2.4 percent per year, roughly the equivalent of
three new 500-megawatt power plants.

In late 2002 Buffet stated "Pipelines are at their lowest valuations in a
decade at a time when the nation's appetite for natural gas is projected to
grow by 30 % over the next decade. Natural gas is increasingly the fuel of
choice for electric power plants..." This is when he started acquiring
interstate natural gas pipeline assets including Kern River Gas Transmission
and Northern Natural Gas The steady income stream in a sharply devalued
industry is what attracted Buffet.

It seems like there is still a lot of value left in these interstate pipelines
especially with California's growing demand for "clean" electricity. I guess
the other option is more nuclear power plants which will take decades to build
if ever approved.

It's both psychological and financial. Yes, you get a smaller gain from your
old position but what about looking at it from any new investments? You sell
$5K basis of stock that's worth $10K, and you discard $9k but keep $1k. That
$1k turns into $2k (if stock doubles say). If you reinvest the $9k you only
better hope that that can do as well (9K-->18K). You keep enough of these stubs
$1-->2, you're going to do very okay. Imo. And Yahoo doesn't make the tracking
that difficult.
Darn, I really am forced now to bring up AAPL as an example. Sorry, Madharry,
others. But really, in at 9 or something and holding a stub up through
$150+...geez, that's more paper profit from that stub than selling the whole
rest of the thing at lower $20, $30, other level.

Psychological: If somebody whines about misses, sells-to-soon, etc. they become
subject to responses (by me, anyway -g-) for just selling out their entire
position. Stocks don't always move from undervalued to only fairly valued. They
sometimes move to beyond fairly valued. Okay to take profits at fair valued,
but if somebody is going to sadly and regrettably note here that the stock has
gone past fair to full and then to overvalued, then that person becomes subject
to comments that I have regarding subs. Namely, you'd feel a lot better if you
had held some stock back some to see what happens.

OT comments.

Stubs. I think that underneath it all it is not a financial decision at all.
You want the stubs for the psychological reason that it makes you feel good. It
was a winner and you love it. I am not knocking you, this is natural. The "you"
is everybody.

All that analysis of "what if my stubs continue to go up" ignores the effect of
the alternate investment.

As to those who whine about history, I refer to Henry Ford II's practice --
"never complain, never explain". Or "if ifs and buts were candy and nuts, oh
what a merry christmas we would have" John Madden, I think.

For me, if in doubt I will sell 1/3 or 1/2 to take some profits. But stubs are
noise and complexity I do not need. Even if tracking is no issue, they take
mental bandwidth. I might watch them for awhile because they are marginal value
plays and I want to see if they drop back down and become a buy, but if they
continue to go up, they are off my radar screen with no regrets.

Stubs. I've got no method or consistent approach to selling these things. Maybe
when the stock stalls, but sometimes I'm not paying close enough attention to
see this. Maybe when the stock drops precipitously on bad news, or if the stock
is downgraded by an analyst and the reasoning makes some sense to me.

It's easier for me to hold a stub longer than a full position. With a stub,
I've already got my main money out, and I figure anything up is gravy for me
and anything down or doing nothing for months and months and months, well
that's okay too, because I've previously sold most of my shares.

Here's an example: KNDL bought '03 @ $5.03/sh.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=18876375&srchtxt=kndl

Who would/could/should hold a full or half or quarter position at the then p/e,
p/sales from the months from late '05 through maybe mid '07, when the stock
just seemed to cycle around or stall and really do nothing after making a rapid
ascent in '05. But with a stub, it's easy to just set and forget... And
sometimes time works in your favor.

Stubs and portfolio tax planning -

I build a position up over time and when I sell I try to pair down that
position over time too. My main goal is to generate long term capital gains so
after one year I will evaluate the position for sale and construct a strategy
that will minimize my tax hit. I sell enough shares to recover my original
investment (ie seed money). I then try to manage my gains so they offset any
short term losses or "average down" positions I need to establish in my
portfolio. I will recognize my long term capital gains and spread the sales
through out the year as the "over valued" opportunity presents its self.

Stub positions are nice to have in the portfolio as they provide a way for me
to spread my gain over to the next year which books a long term capital gain
for the portfolio. I can now start with a small positive portfolio long term
capital gain for the next tax year right out of the gate.

Because I hold many stocks with a very low cost basis, I can harvest my capital
gains to minimize my total portfolio tax liability. My dividend income is
substantial enough to cover my monthly cash flow needs so I tend to keep
dividend paying equities that have a very low cost basis in the portfolio
rather than selling them out.

This strategy has allowed me to pay a maximum Federal tax rate between 15% and
20% while keeping my unrecognized gains in the portfolio. Many investors do not
manage their portfolio to take advantage of the lower marginal tax rates that
capital asset accounting provides. I match my trades to obtain the lowest cost
basis and hold good performing positions for years collecting a steady stream
of dividend income.

Stub and cigar-butt positions do help me accomplish this. I have found that
more than 60% of the time, my stub positions have maintained their value or
increased substantially by the time I finally close out the position.

When certain positions increase substantially or the portfolio becomes over
weighted in a particular sector, I will trim positions, rebalance my holdings
and build up my cash reserves. I will be more liberal with my tax loss selling
or establishing a larger "average down" position so as to off set any windfall
short term capital gains I might have.

Paul, you raise a very good point on the deployment of the new funds gained
from a sale. Many investors feel they must reinvest their proceeds immediately
after their sale. I find that bad investment decisions are made when one feels
they must get this new money deployed back into the market. I keep a cash
reserve account (ie Vanguard GNMA)where I park all extra cash proceeds that I
want to redeploy back into the market. A new "BUY" is a separate decision for
me and is not tied to any sale I make unless it is an equivalent asset
exchange.

I may only make 5-6 new "Buy" positions a year which can be up to three or four
separate purchases over several months. I try to only initiate the new buy when
the value opportunity presents its self. It has taken me many years to learn
and implement this type of portfolio management strategy. You must be a
disciplined investor and try to keep emotions out of the decision making
process. No "All Out" into cash or "All In" investing.

After more weekend reading-I am staying away from homebuilders and financials.
one of the reasons LEV went up so much is that that they announced that they
might not use any of the funds raised to support their home-building
subsidiary. the fact that they would make an such an announcement is telling. I
wish there was some way to take advantage of all the law suits that will be
filed pertaining to the home lending fiasco.

FYI:

Countrywide issued a press release today announcing that Angelo Mozilo will
sell a large number of shares as one of his 10b5-1 plans. The 10b5-1 plans
allow corporate executives to sell shares on a defined basis, triggered by
stock prices and other events and set well in advance of the actual sale. The
rule was set up to allow executives to diversify out of large stock positions
in their company while keeping them from leveraging insider information to
their benefit. This is, in theory at least, how it is supposed to work.

The shares remaining in his plan will be sold in equal 20% chunks next Monday
to Friday.
From the press release:

One of these 10b5-1 Plans, which was entered into almost a year ago on October
27, 2006, is set to expire this month and covers stock options previously
granted to Mr. Mozilo. It provides that a pre-determined amount of
Countrywide’s common stock issued upon exercise of these options is to be sold
on a monthly basis in specified increments. The 10b5-1 Plan also includes a
provision that sales trades cannot take place if the Company’s stock falls
below a designated floor price. During the months of August and September,
2007, the stock price declined below the designated floor price and no trades
were executed. Another provision in the 10b5-1 Plan stipulates that if any
shares subject to the Plan remain unsold on October 8, 2007, then those shares
will not be subject to any price floor and will be sold in 20 percent
increments, commencing on October 8, 2007 and ending on October 12, 2007.

…

“The upcoming sales are driven by rules within the 10b5-1 Plan that were
established long ago, and should in no way be viewed as any indication of my
future outlook for Countrywide,” Mozilo said. “As one of Countrywide’s largest
individual shareholders, my interests are firmly aligned with those of our
other investors. I recognize that the Company’s stock is currently under
pressure. However, the terms of the 10b5-1 Plan that I established in October
2006 require that these sales be executed.”

Mozilo has come under attack lately because the typical practice for executives
is to design a 10b5-1 plan and then leave it alone. However, as the housing
market has deteriorated Mozilo has tinkered with plans to change when shares
are sold. This is highly unusual activity, according to legal experts who
regularly handle 10b5-1 plans.

From a LA Times article (now behind a paywall, important parts here)

“This raises a slew of red flags,” said Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago-based
securities lawyer. “Anytime you have revisions or modified plans. . . it is
extremely suspicious.”

…

“There are circumstances where the plans could be amended, but you better have
a good reason because it’s defeating the basis of the rule,” Carroll said. “If
a guy is changing his plan around, I would think that would send up a red flag.
I wouldn’t allow my clients to do it.”

For the conspiracy theorists out there - this share sale is rumored to be huge
and could put big pressure on the stock (which is now at about $20). If Mozilo
does dump a ton of shares via this plan next week the stock could be pressured
below $18, which is Bank of America’s trigger for their $2 billion cash
investment made in Countrywide last month. Is this the hand over of power? Is
this the sale of Countrywide to Bank of America? Depending on the amount of
shares involved it could very well be…Stay tuned.

Stubs. Yes, "tax planning/tax management" can be another good reason for
keeping stubs. I've overlooked that. Thanks for mentioning your experience and
methods.

Regarding:

"Stub and cigar-butt positions do help me accomplish this. I have found that
more than 60% of the time, my stub positions have maintained their value or
increased substantially by the time I finally close out the position."

I say let's do what works. I'm convinced stubs have helped me with portfolio
performance. I don't keep track of the numbers and so I can't substantiate it
though. If I can translate your "60%" into something like the stubs that go up
in value go up more in value in total than the stubs (40%) that might drop in
value, then that aspect of investing (keeping stubs) is something worth
considering.

I just put the portfolios up on a list in Yahoo finance. Organized by
categories such as aerospace, autos, health, oil, real estate, tech,
below-cash, pennies, watch, and so on. Within categories, I vary. Some I
arrange alphabetically; some I section (e.g. under "oil" I list stocks in
sections: oil service, integrateds, refiners, Canadian); within some categories
I just list them in order of dollar value in the portfolio or more commonly
just add new buys at end of the category.

I try to get or keep as little written stuff from the companies as possible,
i.e. I ask brokers to keep 10-k's, etc. to on-line distribution only. I
clip/copy/file articles on investment gurus, value investing, value mutual
funds. These are filed in notebooks and fill several bookshelves. I also
copy/clip articles on particular stocks I have or might be interested in. I
maintain a "premium plus" account here so I can go back to see what I've said
and what others have said about stocks that interest me.

In my file cabinets stocks are first sectioned by brokerage account. Within
each brokerage account, the stocks are arranged in hanging files alphabetically
by stock symbol. (For stocks that I have at two or more brokers, I place the
stock file under the broker where the position is largest.)

I occasionally add to my long-time accumulated collection of stock market
books, esp. on value investing, psychology of investing, portfolio management
(portfolio mgmt. written for public consumption--i.e not technical stuff with
lots of equations, Sharp ratios, etc.)

That's about it.

Hi Paul - I incorporate all my holdings into my "watch list" screen using
Schwab's Street Smart Pro. The watch list will hold up to 100 stocks. You can
set up various watch lists but I just maintain one using the 100 limit. I add
any new companies to this list from various sources. My portfolio currently has
45 stocks so the other 55 on my watch list are my current favorites.

What's neat about Street Smart Pro is each stock on the watch list is tagged
with current news,all the different SEC information that is filed and other
different news story provided by the service all in real time. The watch list
shows the real time prices that I can sort by various methods but generally I
use the "% change" and monitor those that are down for the day. Along with the
Schwab watch list, Street Smart Pro allows a fantastic graph feature when
viewing any particular security. I chart relative strength, volume bollinger
bands and all the technical stochastics.

Another screen I have displayed on my two 21" terminal set up is the Street
Smart Pro "Cost Basis" screen. This provides me my up to date profit or loss
"cost basis" based on all my buys for any particular position. Therefore, every
day I can monitor specific news stories, see what watch list positions are
selling off and if a "buy" opportunity presents its self, I can see what my
current cost basis is if I own it or add it as a new starter position. My
portfolio screen quickly ranks my top holdings, so I can see how weighted I am
in any one particular holding or industry sector. This is useful for making
sure the portfolio is balanced in the sectors I want to own and if I need to
trim positions on any specific holdings.

I usually have Yahoo Finance displayed on the other screen so I can look at
individual stock key statistics, insider positions and all the other
information provided by Yahoo. I use the firefox web browser and their
integrated PDF reader to view company annual reports for securities that I am
researching.

Even with all of this technology, I find that many of your "Buy" entry points
are much better than mine.

I find that with the 100 stock limit on my main watch list screen is more than
adequate as I now must delete a security when I add a new one. This allows me
to hopefully have the cream float to the top of the list. This value thread has
provided me a lot of good stock candidates that are on my current watch list. I
add new stocks from other sources generally from magazine articles, news
stories and stocks that insiders or gurus are buying (ie Buffet, Ichan etc).

I even have Schwab's web based "alert service" established where text messages
are sent to my cell phone alerting me if certain events have occurred such as
greater than normal volume, 2.5% price moves, new stock high or any other
specific stock alert information I might be following in my active watch list.
I modify this list from time to time and limit it to my top ten holdings or
setting an alert for specific news I am expecting so the phone only receives a
text message that I might want to act on. This is a new service from Schwab and
is quite useful so when I am on my long walks I can receive an alert and think
about if I want to do anything. Many times I do nothing but the stock is in the
back of my mind and it helps me when making my buy and sell decisions.

I have spent many years developing a systems that provides me with the
information I need to track my holdings, do my transaction cost basis
accounting and allows me the flexibility to be mobile (hiking, biking, golfing
etc) and Schwab seems to have the complete package that fits my needs.

I am still looking for a good stock screening service but so far the SI Value
thread seems to be tops on my list.

IMO, Quicken sucks. Especially for investing. Most of the time it has no clue
what stocks are in what areas. And "gains/losses" are calculated using some
kind of superweirdo algorithm that would let you believe you have whatever
returns you wanted. Don't like the percentage return it shows? Click two
buttons to change "returns by account" to "returns by category" or something
else and presto your 15% average return changes into 45%! Or vice versa. I
stopped believing it ages ago.

I use Quicken for all my finances, but would never recommend it for tracking
investments.

I use Yahoo for buy/sell limits and news. Brokerage accounts for real-time
quotes and research. Excel for Buffettology calculations. I really need to

Yes, agree with Jurgis Bekepuris about Quicken. Doesn't seem to be for me. I've

I'm not much interested in seeing daily/weekly portfolio performance. I see
where people who compare their portfolios to others or to benchmarks or for
client expectations have to have those numbers. To me it's a hindrance. If I
could keep my on-line brokerage screens from showing the minute-by-minute

Thanks for the Schwab info. Helpful to me because I am considering opening
another brokerage account to reduce a risk of having too many assets with any
specific broker.

Brokerage accounts provide stock screening services. Some better than others. I
have limited access to Validea Guru Screen (e.g. a "Ben Graham screen"). I like
it, and have often considered signing up for the full site.
I have signed up at AAII; its yearly subscription is pretty inexpensive. I like
their screens for stock market ideas. Also like it for comparing different
methods. Well I like it NOW anyway because it shows that the Ben Graham
defensive investor screen and Ben Graham enterprising investor screens are now
doing very well compared to other screens. -g-
I generally speak derisively of O'Neil Canslim, so I like it when its
performance is below value screens. (Problem with AAII screens is that
sometimes screens are sparse on candidates, so results can fluctuate quite a
bit given the few portfolio members.)

http://www.aaii.com/stockscreens/allscreens.cfm

This website occasionally has some possibilities:

I often check the daily/high low lists. Mostly it's just the low list for
candidates to check out for a buy. My usual site for that is Globe:

OT I was completely unaware of this but makes for very interesting reading:
Classic unpredictable situation of a highly regarded hedgeffund manager with
lots of illiquid positions it turns out unable to meet redemption requests:
Very Sobering.

http://www.abcapman.com/uploads/Fundsupdatefinal.pdf

and more....

Absolute Capital Management, a London-listed hedge fund with $3.2 billion
(&#163;1.6 billion) of assets, went into freefall yesterday as Florian Homm,
its co-founder and joint chief investment officer, quit amid a dispute with the
board.

The share price of Absolute, whose investments are run from Mallorca, Spain,
collapsed by almost 70 per cent as analysts predicted that Mr Homm’s departure
would prompt investors to rush to pull out funds. During a stormy day of
trading yesterday, its market value fell from &#163;389 million to just under
&#163;117 million. The hedge fund floated only last March.

Mr Homm, an architect of Absolute’s strategies and its largest shareholder,
with a 19 per cent stake, is thought to have managed around a quarter of
Absolute’s total funds under management of about $3.2 billion.

In a parting shot, Mr Homm, who ploughed €33 million (&#163;23 million) of his
own Absolute shares into the funds to help to keep them in positive territory
last month, published an open letter to shareholders detailing grievances. He
said that concerns about the fund’s performance had led him to sacrifice his
annual bonus and he called on fellow executives to do the same.

He said that his plan had been to share the payout with his colleagues, the
board having ignored his calls to pay high compensation to top-performing
staff. Mr Homm said that the five million shares he had put into three of
Absolute’s funds ensured that they ended the month slightly positive.

“However, the board of ACMH did not agree with my arguments that ACMH needs to
pay adequate compensation to retain top-level fund managers, nor did they
follow my lead in sacrificing personal bonuses and compensation, or in
contributing ACMH shares to the funds,” he wrote.

“It is apparent that I share a different investment and management philosophy
from the current and prior management of ACMH. Therefore, I have decided that
it is time that I left the company I founded to focus on other pursuits.”

Mr Homm, whose former wife and children also hold substantial stakes in
Absolute, pledged to continue to lobby Absolute “for shareholder value”. He
owns about 12 million shares, having given five million to his ex-wife as part
of their divorce settlement and given a further five million to the funds.

Executives at Absolute were locked in a boardroom meeting yesterday. However, a
spokesman said: “The board was not consulted by Florian on his resignation; nor
as to the manner in which it was communicated.” Absolute was hoping to provide
a formal update to investors last night.

Sandy Chen, an analyst at Panmure, put his forecasts for the hedge fund group
under review. He said: “Homm was a key architect of ACMH’s equity investment
strategies and, although we estimate that Homm was directly responsible for
managing less than one quarter of the assets under management, such a
high-profile departure will likely have an effect on both fund performance and
AUM flows.”

This year, Sean Ewing, Mr Homm’s fellow founder and Absolute’s chief executive,
also left the firm for “personal reasons”. Mr Ewing let it be known yesterday
that he had been approached over a possible return, although no decisions had
been made

Absolute fund is still an expensive fund company by my criterion of $market
cap/$aum < 2.0%. Well, that's how I want to buy 'em anyway. (My number might be
too tight though according to some comments on another thread and also by
recent prices paid in buyouts of funds.)

117 Million market cap (and that is after the freefall) divided by 1.6 Billion
in assets (x100) = 7%.

employment contract with the company, and contributing shares to an account to
make it profitable, although noble, seems deceptive, unethical, and illegal. I
wonder how common a practice it is. I think this is a big deal that has not

those things.

Well, I wasn't exactly dragged, it was part of a very big book fair spanning
several city blocks. Gunn's thing was just a part of the whole thing, but the
interest in him was obvious.

I did luck out, in that the person presenting before him, in the same venue,
was Martha Raddatz, who talked about her new book, then signed. She was
outstanding, but the crowd for her was a fraction of Gunn's.

When I first posted about plg.to on 2/15/07 it was about $1.20 canadian.
yesterday it closed at the $2 canadian mark for the first time, for a better
than 70% return in less than a year if you are a US investor. I think we will
see continued upside from here as there have been no reports on drilling in
Ghana yet, and it still sells at a sharp discount to DGC. However since I seem
to be the only one who posts here who owns it, this will be my last post on it

My thanks again to whoever mentioned BPTRX (Baron Partners) to me about a year

it was outperforming, added to it. It has done very, very, well, significantly
outperforming benchmarks.
I did some portfolio adjustment in my IRA two days ago, sold some partial

Grommit first mentioned SUI on this board. I bought it after listening to the
second quarter conference call. The previous post mentions some highlights from
the call and the following article from AP outlines how this lagging company
might now see higher revenues due to sub-prime lending problems

Sun Communities beats housing slump
Posted on Thu, Oct. 11, 2007Digg del.icio.us AIM print email
The Associated Press

NEW YORK -- In this dark housing market, Sun Communities Inc. looks like a
bright spot. The manufactured-home park owner survived an industry recession
and is poised to benefit as a foreclosure wave sweeps the nation, forcing many
homeowners to seek cheaper digs.

The Southfield, Mich.-based company owns more than 100 communities, mostly in
Michigan and Florida, filled with thousands of manufactured homes. Sun doesn't
own most of the factory-built units but it does own the land and provides the
infrastructure - some communities even boast a club house and pool - in
exchange for a monthly lot rent.

It doesn't suit everyone's lifestyle: Manufactured homes, long ago labeled
"trailers," have fought for respect for decades. Back in 1976, the Housing and
Urban Development Code established strict construction and safety standards to
guard against flimsy trailers. The sardine can-like structures then started
resembling traditional homes.

Their popularity grew - even though manufactured housing depreciates like a car
and, because the homeowner usually doesn't own the property, Freddie Mac and
Fannie Mae won't provide liquidity to the market.

But when more traditional housing is too expensive or out of reach,
manufactured housing can be a way to achieve the American dream of home
ownership.

Even so, not everyone raves about the stock, especially those wanting a quick
profit. Sun's net income was in the red last year and funds from operations, a
key real estate gauge, are down nearly 20 percent from 2002 until 2007. Shares
recently traded near $31, down nearly 9 percent from a year ago.

The stock trades at a roughly 15 percent discount to consensus net asset value,
compared with about 2 percent for other real estate investment trusts, or
REITs, said Paul Adornato, a BMO Capital Markets analyst. As a REIT, Sun
Communities must distribute at least 90 percent of taxable income to investors.
Since 1994, it has regularly produced quarterly dividends above 45 cents and on
Oct. 22, shareholders will reap 63 cents a share for the third quarter.

"That's the whole key to owning this stock," said John Stewart, a Credit Suisse
analyst who labeled Sun "an unloved name in an out-of-favor sector."

The dividend yield is roughly double the REIT industry average, but in the last
few years traditional home builders have eclipsed Sun Communities when it comes
to buyers' adoration.

That's because low interest rates and subprime loans helped buyers - even those
with poor credit or with little or no down payment - buy traditional "stick
built" homes. With many of those loans now headed for default, panicked lenders
are tightening their requirements and halting subprime loans, making home
ownership impossible for those who can't qualify for or afford a traditional
loan.

The rental market has seen a boost while others have turned to manufactured
homes, which often sell for less. But don't expect the stock to explode in the
next few months.

"I would caution that the benefit (the company is) getting is very gradual,"
Adornato warned. "It's not going to happen all at once."

In this case, patience might be rewarded, said Stewart, who started covering
the company in July. "Fundamentals are the best they've been in years," he
said. "We attribute the improvement in large part to the collapse of the
subprime mortgage market

Bought some EXPN.L (EXPGY)

Experian is the largest credit report agency in the world. Stock is down due to
concerns about growth (mortgage inquiries etc.) in the UK and the US. So far
they have confirmed their numbers.

Experian is the best of the breed imo, better than EFX, which is purely
domestic. Their credit database is better (it is the most feared in
creditboards forums due to the fact that inquiries cannot be bumped off) and
50% of their revenues are non US&UK. Experian also owns some web properties
like pricegrabber (also best of breed IMO) and they diversify into developing
countries (recent purchase of an agency in Brazil).

Based on 2008 numbers, the PE is about 14. earnings are high quality - about
80% of their cash flow is converted into FCF )low capex requirements).

I think Experian is a GAARP stock that can be held for a long time.

Congrats on plg.to, Madharry. Nice move and a good confirmation of your
analysis of the situation.

I looked at it of course, as I do all your mentions, but I could not understand
the value proposition. Looking back at it now quickly, I conclude same. For me,
it seemed like part of its business might be worth or trading what some
adjacent company was selling at (and I didn't get any sense that the selling
price of that company was related to its underlying value), with the remainder
of plg's business - mines or right to mine in Ghana free (i.e not valued at all
in the plg stock). I saw no earnings for the company and I'd had have to
scrounge to find any balance sheet info. Somebody you liked - Sprott - was into
it big, and recommending it. His name meant not much to me.

So many ideas here and on other threads, that for me, unless I can spot the
value quickly or see the value possibility quickly - or unless I'm figuratively
grabbed by the shoulders by somebody who says, "LOOK at this you, guys - and
really, here is exactly with some numbers, why it is a value", it's just easier
for me to say pass, and move on to the next idea.

Sorry I missed plg; glad though (so far -g-) to have picked up on some of your
other suggestions.

I'm intrigued by manufactured homes and timber REITs due to their "contra"
nature. Calling a turn on SUI requires more prescience than I can bring.

In the span 2002 to the present they have increased long-term debt by $500
million, decreased equity by $260 million, increased assets by only $100
million, turned operating income into operating losses. Effectively, they are
paying for the dividend ($220 million over the period) and buybacks ($58
million) with debt. Is there some strength over this period that I am missing,
or is your call based on forecasting a turn in operating performance?

Experian - it is interesting, but it also has a number of caveats. It is only
available on pink sheets or London exchange. No USA financial documents. As I
mentioned in another post English calculations of ROE are somehow different
from USA, so they are not directly portable (although Experian 2007 annual
report for some reason calculates everything in US$, so it's not clear whether
they use GAAP). They have just demerged, so the calculations are doubly
unreliable. Also, assuming the market cap of 10BUS$, equity of 2BUS$ and 20%
ROE (optimistic?), the company is still not a great bargain.

Now, on the other hand the PE is low, it has international presence and it is
in a good area (I own EFX). I'll think about it a bit more. :)

Added to my starter position of ERF Enerplus Resources Fund.

Here is an interesting overview dated October 1, 2007

Provident, Enerplus, and Canetic: Is it Time to Reconsider Canadian Energy
Trusts?
http://seekingalpha.com/article/48643-provident-enerplus-and-canetic-is-it-time
to-reconsider-canadian-energy-trusts?source=reuters

From the article:"...Enerplus (ERF)

ERF was in my portfolio back in 2003 and 2004, and I still kick myself for
selling it. I enjoyed a nice profit, but it has more than tripled since then
even without the dividends. Apparently this is my day for being bitter.

It is about twice as big as PVX, although PVX is also one of the larger trusts.

So, what does it think will unlock the value of ERF shares?

# It keeps debt below annual cash flow and have kept the distribution steady
for a couple years -- they think they're not getting credit for their
better-than-average balance sheet and stability (stability with a 10%+ yield
is, I agree, pretty nice).
# Enerplus noted that it also has significant U.S. operations, but that its
U.S. operations (about 10-15% fo the company) are not really appropriate for an
MLP spinoff (not long-lived enough. Even if it could spin them off, it needs
the cash flow from these wells to help pay for its oil sands projects.
# According to Enerplus, according to them, its hidden growth story is its oil
sands leases, which it still has not even really begun to explore. It thinks
the biggest catalyst in its near future will be the market recognizing the
option value of its oil sands leases. According to its rep., it has 467 million
barrels of contingent resources in Alberta that still haven't been turned into
reserves.

Enerplus has paid an unchanging dividend for several years (about 10.5% today),
so it looks to me like it's reinvesting in production, and is starting to
explore its oil sands leases instead of raising distributions as income from
higher realized prices climb.

As far as future, post-2011 plans, Enerplus, like the others, said that nothing
is decided yet. But it went further, essentially guaranteeing that it would not
just start paying the corporate tax rate when the ball falls on New Year's Eve,
2010.

So, Enerplus would like more credit for its oil sands projects, even though
production is at least four years off, and it would really like higher gas
prices, please...."

================================================

Will probably peel off some shares from some of my other integrated oil
companys that have exposure in the mid-east and move this money to ERF which
has operations in both Canada and the US. I will sell part of my stub position
in OXY too.

OXY is an excellent example of how you can hold a stub and continue to get
excellent gains. Stock split several times from my original sale and my 100
share stub is now 400 shares.

Upping my losing position in generic drug maker MYL a little now.

------------
A couple negatives (at least) re. MYL:

Generic drug competition getting more severe.

Mylan has taken on a huge amount of debt to buy a European generic drug maker.
There are questions whether they can digest the acquisition, integrate it, make
it profitable. How they will pay for it, also is a concern. (e.g. issue stock
which will dilute current shareholders?). This will all take time to resolve
itself (in a good way or a bad way), so it's understandable to me that there's
not going to be much to be enthusiastic about or hang around for, in the short
term.

I'll attempt to hold shares for a couple of years, hopefully to see positive
results.
