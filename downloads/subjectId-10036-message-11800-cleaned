Thanks for the link. It looks like the returns for cornerstone growth (closest
to the method I try to use)has cumulative returns since inception (mid 97) that
match the R2000. The link also points out that, for the fund, O'S added a
criteria (positive earnings growth yoy) that was never in his book. That's one
of the reasons I never put money in the fund itself. O'S goes through all this
analysis and demonstrates that a very simple method that outperformed over a
long period of time. Then, when he has real money on the table, he throws in
another criteria that seems sensible enough but was never studied.

Conclusion: Its very hard to stay true to any investing discipline.

My sentiments exactly, Steven.

I've built screens without the earnings factor. In one case, I restricted the
list to S&P 500 companies, while easing the relative strength requirements. In
another, I extended my "universe" to an S&P 1000 I devised (mostly by market
cap). O'Shaughnessy originally built the list from "all stocks".

In my DD of KEM and AVX, the major difference between the two companies that

company). I took this as a positive and bought AVX. AVX would not have made an
O'Shaughnessy screen.

I got in AVX around Christmas. Close enough?

I didn't buy BAMM, but yesterday morning I took a tiny position in BNBN for my
wife's IRA without ever noticing the interest in BAMM on this thread. Makes me
think I'm doing something right. BNBN was getting beat up after the negative
earnings, plus what is more contrarian than a dot.com stock? A little less than
$1.50/shr in cash, no debt, and I got in under $2. Substantial increase in
revenue growth; BN parent is major shareholder. That's enough cash to burn for
a few years, I think.

A little Peter Lynch in the decision, too. My bro-in-law is a big buyer of
books, and he said BNBN was his favorite online bookstore. Says he goes to the
B&N store, browses, then goes home and orders from BNBN online. Exactly what I
do. I can't fault Amazon's service, but BNBN has come a long way in making
their website friendlier. There were several times in the past when I sat
waiting for the BNBN servers to respond, so I clicked Amazon and purchased
there. I was in 2 different B&N stores this past weekend, and they were jammed
with customers and the parking lots were overflowing. Folks spending those
Christmas gift cards, no doubt, although the GCs were already in the numbers.
But I don't think the GCs are interchangeable betwixt the stores and the
websites. Keeping the entities separate.

BAMM: That inventory build caught my eye too, Allen. This from the April/2000
10-K "In general, approximately 80% of the Company's inventory may be returned
by the Company for full credit, which substantially reduces the Company's risk
of inventory obsolescence." While this is somewhat reassuring, I still find the
inventory build concerning considering that the K covers a period ending 1/29.
Book inventory that isn't readily salable requires substantial markdowns and
even 20% of inventory sold at a substantial loss can be troubling. As I've
indicated in prior posts, I'm on the sidelines considering reentry, having
exited when Borders warned. The key for me is whether the leaders, AMZN &
Barnes and Noble, have called off heavy discounting competition. The recent

Cash flow: Gabelli has 'evolved' and now emphasizes FCF instead of EBITDA.
EBITDA, because it's bases on GAAP and for other reasons has serious

comparison because it incorporates debt and has the smoothness of accrual-based
GAAP. By contrast, neither P/S [Fisher, O'Sh.] nor PE [Dreman] consider debt
though you can incorporate a debt criteria element in screens and achieve
similar results.

I also have a problem with adding back all Depreciation and Amortization due to
opinion I have that some of it really is a loss of useful value and therefore
should not be added back. I ran across a formula (or a limit for a screen,

don't know what I think about that yet. It is all so company-specific that it
is difficult generalizing.

Free Cash Flow evaluation

>>I also have a problem with adding back all Depreciation and Amortization due

I too am groping here but....

If you are evaluating an enterprise on the basis of FREE CASH FLOW then perhaps
you should not be concerned about such concepts as "loss of useful value". ALL
past capital expenditures are extraneous to your evaluation.... they simply
represent moneys spent in the past. What needs to be evaluated is present and
future cash flows only.

I wonder if it is necessary to differentiate between cash flow and FREE cash
flow. I wonder if one could treat ALL current and future capital expenditures
as "self supporting". If "maintenance" capital expenditures do not enhance
future cash flows, they will at least extend the term of your evaluation model
thus enhancing its PV. The problem would thus become one of providing a
rational finite life to the enterprise i.e. limiting the number of payments in
your DCF evaluation.

In a perfect world, where all business and finance managers made only the best
decisions regarding purchases, capital expenditures, etc.....then maybe I'd go
along here.

However, rarely does the "Depreciation and Amortization" equal the CAPEX. In
fact, it usually exceeds it by a wide margin which leads the suspicious part of
my personality to suspect that there might be motives other than pure accuracy
or need at play. It is in the estimation of the actual balance of "wear and
tear" and "refurbishment" and "expenditures needed to stay competitive" that I
find the greatest challenge. For the adjustment amounts to income can often
make the difference between an acceptable flow of cash from an enterprise and
one that is marginal or worse.

Leapnet (LEAP) looks like it's coming off a bottom. Trading around a buck with
$1.74 in cash and very little debt. Very clean balance sheet. Cash flow is
still negative, but what you see is what you get. Consolidation was completed
with restructuring in Q4 and it sounds like the company is expecting a return
to profitability in the second half.

There was an interview with the CEO yesterday and the replay is available at:

http://www.CEOcast.com ./company.cfm?cid=8178

The interviewer's voice is a little hard to listen to, but there is some good

Recent EPS numbers include about -.10 in amortization of goodwill related to
the merger. The company profile is available at:

Good DD should probably include pulling up last years 10K for SPR, Inc.. At

portion of it's operating cash flow to MAINTAIN existing cash flows - whether
by spending on R&D, replacing obsolete equipment, or other investment necessary
to keep cash flows coming at current levels. The second, because the earnings
power of it's capital base either doesn't deteriorate or deteriorates far more
slowly, is free to invest nearly all it's operating cash flow in new projects
offering returns greater than the cost of capital.

My favorite in the personnel field is HAKI. It is interesting to compare them

I think I like the FCF to Sales ratio converted to a percentage for comparison
purposes.

The numbers(these are both 6 month numbers but still are illustrative)are
these:

SFN has FCF of 67.853 Million and Revenues of 1,905 Million for a percentage
return of 3.56%

HAKI has FCF of 7.045 Million and Revenues of 105.638 Million for a return
percentage of 6.67%

My interpretation of this statistic is that HAKI gets twice the free cash per
dollar of revenue generated.

On that basis alone, it still remains my favorite.

Timba,

In all fairness, from the types of screens you're running, LEAP probably
wouldn't fit your investment targets. You could probably pick AAPL or COMS and
see something close to a double in 12 months. As I've mentioned, I primarily
look for potential turnaround plays. I put in a lot of hours of research to
find a few things I like enough to buy, and then reserve funds to average up or
down in case of market swings. I'm not trying to put together a huge portfolio
of stocks to build a do it yourself mutual fund. If I wanted to do that, I'd
just buy a mutual fund and let an expert do the work for me. What I'm normally
looking for is a place where an entire sector has been decimated and then sift
through the wreckage for those with the strongest financial positions. I also
tend to target smallcaps in the $1-$3 range where margin calls intensify the
damage and buyers have to pay cash during the shake out. When market sentiment
shifts and the price breaks back into margin territory, the percentage gains
can be pretty impressive.

In the case of Leapnet, the margin numbers are skewed by a number of factors. A
lot of it is merger related. As I understand the situation and doing some
reading between the lines, the pre-merger CEO of Leapnet was against some
necessary layoffs and had a tendency to look more at the top line than the
bottom line. He has since "resigned" and cutbacks in personnel were announced
at the same time. IMO, the restructuring that took place in the quarter just
ended probably should have been done shortly after the merger was completed.
The CEO did another interview today that has more in the way of progress
reports and forward looking statements. http://www.wallstreetreporter.com/ You
have to scroll down the right hand column to find the interview and it takes a
current browser and RealPlayer to listen. Some of the key points are they have
zeroed out all their debt, the consolidation process is complete and they
expect a return to profitability in Q3 with revenue growth going forward. Cash
per share should be around $1.05 now with tangible assets increased to match
the decrease in cash. A rough guess is something around a .50 hit in Q4
including non-cash charges for amortization, early retirement of debt and
layoffs. Tangible book should be around $2, with half of that in cash, zero
debt, and a clean road map to better margins and positive cash flow. The sector
is overripe for consolidation and I wouldn't be surprised to see some deals
taking place in the second half. Companies like LEAP with growing revenue and
solid balance sheets should be prime targets for mergers and acquisitions.

That's my reasoning behind Leapnet anyway. The most common mistake I hear
investors make over and over again is to have a plan and not stick to it.
Leapnet fits in with what I do, but that doesn't make it a suitable investment
for everyone who would fall into the rather broad category of what could be
considered "value investors". It's trading at a nice discount to book and none
of the steps management have taken to grow earnings are factored into the stock
price. I think it's a great value play, but it doesn't work for anyone
screening for PE numbers in Yahoo profiles.

The usual disclaimers apply. My time, my money, my opinions, etc.

LEAP might work for value investors who screen for net-nets.

I make NCA at about $1.56 with a stock price of $1.00.

It "maybe" would be suitable for a Ben Graham net-net (price being 2/3 of NCA).

I say "maybe" because there is still, after all these years -g-, some concern
on my part regarding Dr. Graham's screening criteria. I've gone back now again
to "Intelligent Investor" and and some of my copies of his later published
conversations. The issue is profitability. Nowhere (that I see) does Dr. Graham
explicitly say the company must be profitable (as one of the net-net or
"bargain" criteria). But in all his examples (that I see), they are.

You are indicating that LEAP will lose $.5. Assuming that that happens, it
would then not be suitable as a net-net buy, although, from what I can tell, it
"might" be now. (aside: I would bet that Dr. Graham would say anybody buying
LEAP as a net-net now ought to also be reducing risk by holding/buying a
well-diversified number of other issues (net-nets) as well.)

Maybe for me, who is considering LEAP as a net-net, it would be less risky for
me if I wait for the earnings announcement to see if the stock drops further.
If the stock rises or holds, but the NCA figure does decline, I'll just move on
to the next net-net possibility.

Jeffrey Bash. Doesn't your supporting information argue against your
conclusion?

If a larger company, compared to a smaller company

has multiple lines of business
less accessible management
less insider buying to guide you

then, those factors would tend to make the larger company the more
difficult/intimidating to analyze and with more analyst variability -- and so
provide the area where the market inefficiencies would be largest.

Not arguing with the conclusion -- small companies may be more likely to be
mispriced than large -- just having my Fri. night cocktail and musing on your

Fred Smith is the former Leapnet CEO who took a lesser role in the merged
company and recently "resigned". Insiders own 57.9% of the outstanding stock.
While that might affect things when it comes to voting, it would be pretty hard
to make a case for insiders not having a stake in the company. It might also be
worth noting that unless Fred has sold stock which hasn't been reported yet
(possible), he still holds 1.5 million shares and the sale amounted to about 6%
of his total holdings. Under the circumstances I'd be surprised to see more
than token purchases at best. I'd be concerned if insiders were unloading large
percentages of their positions en mass, but there has been a total lack of that
sort of activity.

Movie Gallery MOVI

Last time I posted on this board regarding video-store stock you guys slammed
me. I still think this stock is worth a look, and the market is starting to
agree.

Look at the most recent corporate release: This year MOVI grew sales and
earnings, bought back stock, and payed down some of its debt. Next year
earnings are forecast to be $1.10 to $1.20 and cash earnings (e.g. earnings
including non-cash amortization of goodwill) of $1.50 to $1.60.

Granted, video-stores aren't exactly the growth story of the 21st century, but
with a forward price-to-cash earnings multiple of 3, you need only a few years
for the company to earn its market capitalization and then some.

Moreover, MOVI is located in rural areas, where competing technologies (e.g.
VOD) are likely to take root the latest.

Any comments?

Jeff,

I'd definitely agree there's a better chance of talking to an officer of a
company with $50-$250 million a year in revenue than it would be for a large
cap. I've seen quite a few companies that use the CFO for IR. Personally, I
think the CFO is just about the best person in the company to talk to, but it
has caused me to wonder just exactly what it is CFO's do that allows them
plenty of time to answer silly questions from shareholders.

I'm not sure there is less time involved in DD between the large and the small.
If the company is big enough, there probably wouldn't be as much incentive to
do exhaustive research. When I say 'big enough' I'm thinking more along the
lines of IBM, Microsoft, Disney, etc. where it's safe to assume you're looking
at a good company. Those probably couldn't be classed as value plays though.

On insider buying and selling, I think you almost have to look for a stock that
responds to that kind of activity. Some stocks can be called almost dead on by
comparing the chart to the trades, but a lot of them it doesn't seem to make
much difference other than mass selling. Options are common enough that often
stock is never purchased on the open market, and unless the officer has a lot
of cash kicking around, the options are exercised and sold the same day they're
in the money. What I'll normally check for is a number of insiders selling to
close out positions. The flip side would be insiders buying to start a
position. The problem with good value plays is insiders frequently stopped
buying at higher levels when they missed the bottom while buying into a down
trend. When you get right down to it, insiders are just people who can screw up
a trade like anyone else.

Then you get cases like the Gateway CEO who was happily telling everyone how
great everything is while dumping around $10 billion in stock. Then makes an
announcement to the effect of, "Well, we had a bad weekend and we'll miss our
numbers.". Uh huh. Right.

"Its hard to ignore it based on cash flow."

And easy to ignore based on free flow cash. Video stores HAVE to buy new movies
to generate revenue. The cost of purchasing those new movies are capitalized.
It doesn't matter that those costs are incurred EVERY quarter as part of doing
business, for GAAP purposes, being capitalized it doesn't hit EBITDA.

Store fixtures, old movies and goodwill don't have a lot of value in a
liquidation. I sincerely doubt there are enough assets to cover the $50 million
line of credit, let alone accounts payable. My guess is the frequent opening of
new stores is also a normal operating expense as the company seeks new markets
for old inventory. At least the new stores don't seem to be adding much in the
way of income to the bottom line or even the top.

Running up the line of credit by $5 million while buying back $5 million worth
of stock also doesn't impress me. It looks like very expensive hype.

My guess is Chapter 11 within 18 months unless they can sell a whole bunch of
stock or find a sucker to buy a ton of junk bonds. No offense to those who like
MOVI, but it looks booby trapped to me. Try looking at the debt to equity ratio
after taking out goodwill and figuring store fixtures and old movies at .30 on
the dollar. Figure book value the same way.

Don Earl,

You make a good point about free cash flow --- MOVI does have to keep investing
cash in the business and that should be accounted for in the analysis, but
consider the following:

1. Video stores do not HAVE to buy new stores to generate revenue. They may
HAVE to buy new stores to generate revenue growth, but let me remind you this a
VALUE stock.

2. If you do the math, you'll set that total liabilities have decreased (see
most recent 10-Q), while at the same MOVI has repurchased $5 million in stock
and grown revenues. Furthermore, if you look at the latest press release
(rather than the dated material you are using), you'll see long-term debt has
decreased by $4 million. So your comment about running up credit is totally
off-base.

3. Furthermore, MOVI is toning down their # of new store acquisitions, which
will improve free cash flow.

Perhaps your response is a fair reaction to over-zealous cheerleading on my
part, but before you put forth your analysis in such an acerbic and pompous
fashion, make sure to do your homework.

Here's a recent story on the homebuilder sector:

Friday January 12, 5:34 pm Eastern Time
Homebuilders may get boost from lower rates
(UPDATE: Adds details in paragraph 8)

By Rachel Cohen

NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - For homebuilders worried the slowing economy may
damp demand for new homes, lower mortgage rates may help them weather the
storm.

The next few months will test whether lower mortgage rates are enough to offset
the risk of a slowing economy and rising unemployment, said Legg Mason analyst
David Weaver.

``We could see consumers sway either way over the next several months,'' he
said, adding that the outcome will be instrumental for the construction
industry.

Homebuilders are more optimistic a decline in interest rates, sparked by the
Federal Reserve's move last week to cut key lending rates, will keep homebuyers
lining up in near record numbers.

``We think we are in a highly favorable environment for purchasing a new KB
home,'' said Bruce Karatz, chairman and chief executive of homebuilder Kaufman
& Broad Corp. (NYSE:KBH - news) ``We see mortgage rates declining, inflation
under control, unemployment at 30-year lows and household formations on the
rise.''

Karatz spoke Thursday, when Kaufman, one of the top U.S. homebuilders, reported
higher fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and record full-year results and said it
expects to beat estimates for fiscal 2001, due in part to higher volumes.

Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN - news) on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings
above estimates and the homebuilder said it expects a record year in 2001. The
company said its goal is to raise earnings by about 20 percent.

The fortunes of homebuilders are an important indicator for a whole range of
other companies, such as home appliance makers, furniture manufacturers and
home improvement retailers. If orders for new homes fall off, then all these
sectors also feel the impact.

The Fed's interest rate cuts pushed mortgages rates to their lowest levels
since spring 1999, and refinancing soared to its highest level in nearly two
years, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.

MORTGAGES AT NEAR RECORDS

The outlook for homeowners is so strong, Fannie Mae, the No. 1 U.S. mortgage
finance company, estimated on Thursday that 2001 could see the second-highest
number of new mortgages in the nation's history. The closely watched 30-year
fixed mortgage rates averaged 6.89 percent in the week ended Jan. 13, the first
time they dipped below 7 percent since April 1999.

Analysts, though, are not sure that low mortgage rates will be enough to keep
the demand for new homes strong.

Consumers are getting more and more cautious, said Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder
analyst Barbara Allen.

``In the balancing act between rising unemployment and falling mortgage rates,
rising unemployment usually wins,'' Allen said. ``If you're worried about
lay-offs, you don't really care what (mortgage) rates are.''

A December survey by the National Association of Home Builders found that home
builders expected the market for new homes to slow despite declines in mortgage
rates.

Thirty-five percent of builders of single-family detached homes said in
December that they expect new home sales to be ``good'' in the next six months,
while 57 percent said they expected ``fair'' sales and 9 percent expected
``poor'' sales.

These percentages were similar to the six-month outlook last June, but off from
six-month expectations in October when 51 percent of builders expected ``good''
sales, 42 percent expected ``fair'' sales and 7 percent expected ``poor''
sales.

If lower rates aren't enough to offset an economic slowdown, the larger
homebuilders will see new orders as they gain market share, analysts say.

Credit conditions are tightening and lenders are not likely to lend to small
companies, said Lawrence Horan, director of research at investment company
Parker/Hunter in Pittsburgh.

``The big publicly traded companies have plenty of access to capital and can
gain market share,'' Horan said, even as overall housing starts go down.

Besides interest rates, the homebuilders have a backlog of orders in the first
quarter that will help their results, whether or not they have higher new
orders in the first half of 2001.

``Backlogs should sustain them for two quarters,'' said Merrill Lynch analyst
Robert Curran, who thinks GDP will grow faster in the second half of the year
than in the first half.

``If we have a relatively brief dip in the economy (homebuilders) will be able
to sustain themselves,'' he said.

I would urge extreme caution on homebuilders. The economy is slowing if not
stopping and these stocks are at their highs. Other consumer cyclical
industries are, to say the least, not at their highs (cars - look at a chart of
F and why is that so different from homebuilders?)

Those P/E's are based on trailing earnings, and in my opinion the forward
estimates may be very optimistic. Wall Street analysts are very high on these
stocks - you want to buy homebuilders when Wall Street hates them.

This is a sector that will look the cheapest on P/E ratios, (and especially the
inane PE/growth formula - NEVER use that on a cyclical industry) just before
earnings collapse.

I've been wrong before. And I've been right a few times too. Do your own
homework. Just don't use PE/G ratios on cyclicals.

Paul, I believe that market inefficiencies have almost nothing to do with the
amount of analysis work needed. For one thing, large companies provide analysts
(not us little investors) estimates which reflect substantial inside company
work. For another, I believe inefficiencies (too cheap) are mostly due to
market cap, volatility, stock ownership base, and size of company issues - none
of which needs to be an issue for a small investor.

I would add that in my opinion the best RISK ADJUSTED market inefficiency
rewards come from "busted" larger cap stocks that institutions have come to
hate and have either underperformed for a long period for "temporary" reasons
or because of bad mgmt that has been replaced. C, IBM, AAPL, and more recently
HRC (a thread stock), are historical successful examples; EK is an example of a
failure of new mgmt - in my opinion because of its core business. If you
subscribe to the Buffett idea of swinging at 20 good pitches in a lifetime, I
would say that this is where folks should look, and be patient. If you want
more opportunity, then I believe you have to go to the other end of the size
spectrum.

I am a big fan of VOD and with respect to MOVI suggest the comments of last

closed. Earnings will disappear long before rental of movies at such places
will stop, because of fixed cost issues. I do think it is OK to look at
something like this if you look at it like a depleting asset, like an oil well.
The P/E has to provide both a return of capital and a return on capital. The
problem is that you are not getting the cash as with an oil well and you are
relying on mgmt to successfully put that money to work in a different business
where they may have no special expertise. To a certain extent EK mentioned in
my preceding post is an example of mgmt failing to use film cash flow
successfully to diversify.

James, I agree that homebuilders are cyclical, and that they up a lot from
their lows. That's why I'm selling some.

My use of p/e ratios was not intended to determine whether I should be in the
sector, but rather for comparisons within the sector of which homebuilders are
most richly valued. Ditto with using the growth rates: I think it's worth
knowing that contrary to what one might expect, the stocks in the sector that
have the highest p/e ratios also have the poorest earnings growth prospects,
according to analysts.

Contrary to your suggestion, I think this is a reasonable approach for what I'm
doing: I'm not deciding whether to be in the sector, I'm choosing stocks within
the sector to dump. In particular, I'm dumping the stocks with the highest p/e
ratios and the poorest growth prospects, within the sector. Is that a bad idea?

--------
amount of analysis: Senior (left side of continuum) vs. Bash (right side of
continuum).

Does investment analysis work vary with the particular stock/situation? Low
hanging fruit vs. hidden value: low hanging should be easily (less work) seen.
Benefit of more analysis of a stock gives greater chance to discern hidden
value.

Senior's operating premise: There is no relationship between detail analysis
before stock purchase vs. investment success (the stock rises). (e.g. my
opinion that in-depth cash flow studies are irrelevant to investment success.)
(Benefit of detail analysis is to give confidence to hold on to a losing
position until it becomes successful.)

inefficiency determination. When? Before the analysis proceeds vs. after. When
does one see inefficiency? If you didn't suspect inefficiency why would you
start an analysis? How much inefficiency does one need to see before one takes
a position. What is inefficiency?

relationship of inefficiency to value: greater the inefficiency the greater the
value. What about the importance of a catalyst?

What is analysis work? -- Senior's view, Bash's, small investor's activity vs.
professional analysts?

Madharry. Well, I'm not so sure I can even define the purpose of investing
(which is different from a definition of investing, such as B. Graham's p. 1
of: "an investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises
safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these
requirements are speculative."

Basically, I want my portfolios to increase in value. And I want that to happen
whilst I consider risk too. (When the S&P 500 is up 15% or more, we might have
a discussion here again whether one ought to at least attempt to beat the S&P
bogey or just buy mutual funds -g-) I'll even live with some of my stocks going
nowhere or even going bankrupt if the ones that go up, go up enough to push up
the portfolios' values.

I try to hold stock until I see fair value. Sometimes though I get shaken out
and I sell. Like today, with homebuilder Standard Pacific. -- It's in limbo
land -- imo -- too expensive to buy, too early yet (below fair value) to sell.
But it's up strongly about 3 to a new high, so I sold about 10% of my position.

We can argue about technical analysis, benefits of following insiders in their
buying/selling, cash flow, EVA, concentration vs. diversification, etc. etc.
But I always want to ask, "So, are you making any money?" (I mostly try to
infer this from posters -- don't usually want to confront anybody.) Maybe
that's why I'll just settle (wrongly so perhaps) for a definition of success in
discussions as stocks that go up beyond their purchase price.

TimbaBear: net-nets I am just guessing, but I would presume many people here
would consider a definition by Jim Clarke to be most appropriate. (Or maybe
RJM, who seems to specialize in such investments). But since I'm here and I've
got some time, I refer you to the standard "Intelligent Investor", Chapter 15
(1973 edit), "Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor", referring to net
current asset stocks (NCA): "It always seemed, and still seems, ridiculously
simple to say that if one can acquire a diversified group of common stocks at a
price less than the applicable net current assets alone- after deducting all
prior claims, and count as zero the fixed and other assets- the results should
be quite satisfactory."
We are talking about stocks selling at price equivalent to working capital/sh.
A NCA stock = a netnet.

To me, a "Ben Graham net-net" is a stock selling at 2/3 of NCA. Dr. Graham
suggested that buying a diverse number of stocks each of which sold for 2/3 of
NCA and holding each (Patience is required!) until the stock price rose to NCA
value (or until two years elapsed) and then selling-- that that was a method
that proved profitable. There are also some notes that I have wherein Dr.
Graham said just buy the NCA stocks and that works out well. On this thread,
IMO - and I am guessing only - the strong preference is for 2/3 NCA for a
purchase.

Re. net-net, you could take current assets minus all liabilities, which is how
I interpret Graham's definition of net current assets.

You then multiply this by your favorite ratio. Graham used a ratio of 2/3. If
the stock is selling for less than the product, it's a candidate to consider
buying in this scheme.

How to choose the ratio for the cutoff?

Ben Graham's Intelligent Investor book suggests using 2/3. If the stock sells
below 2/3 of net current assets, it's a candidate for him. There's no
particular justification that I could find in the book for choosing 2/3, as
opposed to some other fraction. It's just there, in the book.

I don't think you have to use 2/3 as the gospel. You might want to choose a
different ratio as your cutoff, for this reason: Typically the stocks that sell
at the deepest discount to net current assets are very small market cap stocks,
with low stock prices. A $1 stock with a market cap of $7 million for company
selling a single product, well that would not be uncommon. If this isn't what
you feel comfortable buying, you could loosen your screen by choosing a larger
ratio than 2/3, and you could thereby find more stocks to choose, including
better capitalized companies with bigger market caps.

Lately, though, there are lots more stocks selling below net current assets, or
even below net cash, than in recent memory.

N, I've been trying to find that 2/3 figure for net-nets in Intelligent
Investor, and I don't see it. I know at some point that's what Dr. Graham
recommended, but I just do not see it in my edition of the book. Do you or
anyone else have the citation?

I see under Portfolio Policy: The Positive Side, "the enterprising investor is
to buy them (aside: I believe "them" refers to his definition of secondary - as
opposed to primary - common stocks, also ordinary preferred dividends, and
foreign bonds) only when obtainable at bargain prices - which we define as
prices not more than two-thirds of the appraisal value of the securities." I
don't see a 2/3 figure anywhere else.

In the section on "Bargain Issues, or Net-Current-Asset Stocks" he provides
(Table 15-2) 5 stocks selling below net current assets (my '73 edition which
features stocks in 1970) of "prominent" companies. Only one of the 5 is at 2/3
of net current assets. Perhaps the table is to illustrate that even "prominent"
companies are sometimes below net current assets. Interesting to me that the
"prominent" feature is what people here might deem important when they select
net nets. (include myself)

There's no mention of 2/3 for the buy criterion. "...If one can acquire a
diversified group of common stocks at a price less than the applicable net
current assets alone-- the results should be quite satisfactory." I give up
here. Maybe it's buried in the word "applicable". Maybe the book can only
provide a starting point for the defensive and enterprising investor. It's left
to the enterprising investor to dig further. Or of course, maybe the 2/3
criterion is there, but I just missed it.

Thank you Paul for that reference! I have the book, and re-read that section.

I will be happy if I uncover a true 2/3NCA investment opportunity that shows me
the potential to at least realize a valuation at book value. But mostly
everything I uncover that looks like it might be one has so many problems that
whatever "margin of safety" a supposedly low price gave me was more than
compensated by increased risk of even lower future valuations.

I must remember that Graham was coming out of a time where stock prices
remained depressed for many years and the country was poor enough after the
depression that wide spread capitulation had not only occurred, but had become
a life-style.

I am using Graham's discounting philosophy for assets, with some modifications.
I am not discounting PPE by 85% as he suggests in Security Analysis. I am
discounting all long term assets by 50% instead. My reasoning is: 1). we are
not in a soft real estate market; 2)Most PPE has already been subject to large
book discounts from depreciation and amortization, while not being adjusted(as
nearly as I can tell)for any appreciation in land values; 3). the 50% discount
on the other long term assets is probably a bit much for that class, and
therefore would tend to compensate if I'm too lenient on the PPE.

I will then add the NCA to this discounted long term asset amount to arrive at
my own approximation of hardcore value(current moment only, not addressing the
time value of money for this purpose). Perhaps it's presumptuous on my part,
but I label this figure "NetNet Value" on my spreadsheets because I have netted
out liabilities and have discounted(or netted)the value of the remaining
assets. So if you see me refer to NetNets in my posts, the above will be how I
arrive at the designation.

The question then arises, by what measure, if any, do we evaluate the business
of each company so that, when faced with 15-20 companies in various industries
that all are selling well below their NetNet values, we can be reasonably sure
that our final choices represent the best hope for safety and a reasonable
return on our investment?

What I'm looking for is some method that would provide consistency of results,
something that doesn't involve as much "intuition" on my part.

My research into CFO and FCF and DFCF, while teaching me a great deal, hasn't
given me confidence that I've arrived at a solution that has eliminated the
subjective out of my estimations and resultant valuations. Although I value
"intuition" and don't think this game can be played without it, I also believe
that prejudices(conscious and unconscious) can masquerade as intuition. When
that happens, it usually has negative consequences on the valuations achieved.

I look at a lot of net-net investments and the 2/3 ratio is a nice rule of
thumb, but not gospel to me. On this thread I think you've seen me add to
net-net a very conservative valuation of owned real estate and treat that the
same as net current assets. Graham never said this, but I don't think its
anything he would have objected to.

I also look for a profitable company, paying a dividend if possible. I also
look for postive free cash flow.

As Timba said, there ain't many of these. I find one every 3-6 months. And they
all go up 30-50% within a year. I have never lost more than a few bucks on one
of these. I probably buy 5% of the net-nets that I look at, but it usually
takes about 1 minute of analysis each to rule out half the ones I pass on. I'm
sure some of the ones I pass on triple, but that's not my game.

This is not Graham's strategy, its my adaptation of Graham's wisdom. Central to
Graham's strategy is diverification among 30 or 40 net-nets, which you might
actually be able to do today unlike any time in the last five years. The vast
majority of the stocks you buy by this strategy will look like crap, Graham
understood that - I think what he would have said is that everybody knows they
look like crap, that's why they trade below their net current assets.

My strategy has always been to use some hard work to find the needle in the
haystack that doesn't look like crap. The ones I buy aren't Microsoft, but
they're real companies. I own about five of these now. Syms and GTSI are
probably my favorites going forward although both are up substantially from
where I bought them.

Thank you for your response!

Exactly right, and we may get the opportunity to see even more, which is why
I'm concentrating so hard to clarify my thinking for this type of evaluation
and selection.

When Greenspan was talking around the time of his first rate hike, he said that
the existing barriers to inflation were starting to go away. At that time, I
think he listed the pressures of a global marketplace were increasing
competition and thereby exerting a downward influence on prices, the Asian
crisis had peaked, but that those countries were exporting their way out of
crisis, which meant lower prices here; American's fearfulness regarding rapid
obsolescence of job skills was preventing them from demanding more concessions,
although that was being offset by a tight labor market to some extent, and the
main one, productivity gains, outpaced the other sources of inflationary
pressure.

Most of those conditions have changed, global recovery means more demand and
therefore increasing prices, the Asian crisis is almost a distant memory, the
main source of productivity gains, capital expenditures, has slowed way down,
which means that gains in productivity have probably peaked, and the less rapid
change in technology means that Americans may be getting a little more
confident in their skill sets.

I'm saying all of this to lay the groundwork for my belief that inflation now
has more potential to become the problem we have been worried about for so long
than ever before in this bull run, and it may provide us with more
opportunities to get NetNets if we survive the turbulence with some investment
capital left.

Hiya James!

I've come up with a few that I like. CNET, EDEL, CVR, TSCO, OXM, MTCH and MMAN.

I'm getting the research down to a quicker pace. It goes so much easier after
all the thinking necessary to set up the spreadsheet is done.

The problem with most of these is the low share volume. That means a bit extra
of a premium on both sides of the transaction that has to be factored into the
net return equation. But if these are truly long term investments, I think I
can wait for a high volume day to exit when the time comes.

Chris,

First I'd like to point out that a press release is not a balance sheet. In the
last 10Q, the cash flow statement shows line of credit borrowings of $5
million. If they've paid that down by $4 million since the 10Q was filed, it's
a step in the right direction, but hardly impressive.

I'm not trying to be offensive, and I'll probably get flamed for saying it
anyway, but I'm pretty much of the opinion that anyone who doesn't understand
"Generally Accepted Accounting Principals" (GAAP) should probably avoid value
investing, small caps, and probably the stock market as a whole altogether.
Pick out a professionally managed mutual fund, let someone who understands the
rules manage your investments, and hope the performance is better than most
funds saw last year. There are just plain too many places private investors can
get burned for no other reason than that they didn't understand the rules. I'm
not trying to offend anyone who likes MOVI, but the company has a pure ugly
balance sheet and there just isn't any nicer way to put it. I'm not saying the
stock can't go up, but if it does it will be a hype run not backed by
fundamentals. I personally couldn't sleep well holding that kind of issue over
night, but the bottom line is it's your money and you can do anything you want
with it.

I learned GAAP the way babies learn to speak English, by spending literally
thousands of hours reading and analyzing SEC filings. A college student with a
four year degree in accounting almost certainly knows far more about specific
rules and the finer points than I do. You could probably go to your local
library and pick out a few books that would give you the basics in a couple
weeks of casual reading. I'm sure we're having this discussion because it
doesn't make sense that Company A can report $1.50 in earnings with $10 in
assets and be a solid investment and Company B can report the same numbers and
be a bad joke. I'd have to agree with anyone who doesn't think it makes sense
because it doesn't. Unfortunately that doesn't change the fact that it's true.
The rules are different.

I also think it takes a certain amount of analysis on how a business operates.
In the case of a video rental company, the demand is highest for new releases.
New releases also command the highest prices for new inventory from the
distributor. Since customers expect to find the movie in stock when they visit
the store, the company has to meet peak demand in their inventory for those
movies at top dollar. To get the best bang for their buck, the customer plays
the movie over and over before they have to take it back until they are sick of
it and all their friends have seen it. At that point they'll wait for it to
come on TV before they'll watch it again in a year or so. In the mean time, the
company now has a huge inventory of used movies with very little demand. At
least nowhere near what would justify having 20 copies in stock. They can rent
a building, put up some shelves, and distribute some of the inventory that way.
They can also sell some of the used movies at a lower price than new, since
they've recouped a lot of their costs in rentals. The problem for investors is
that the original costs of the large inventory at top dollar is "capitalized"
as an asset. Part of it shows up in earnings as "amortization", but the full
impact of the cost of doing business isn't hitting the bottom line. The only
sure acid test for this kind of business model I know of it to check debt
levels and cash. If cash is approaching zero per share and debt levels are
high, that means it costs the business more to run their operations than they
take in no matter how much they report in earnings. The PR sounds wonderful, is
fantastically deceptive, and all perfectly legal.

You've probably guessed by now that I don't like this kind of business model at
any price. The reason being that I consider the downside risk to be total. That
doesn't mean these kind of businesses can't bounce around for years without any
obvious problems, but they are so unstable that it doesn't take much for them
to topple, and when that happens it goes so fast there isn't any time for
damage control. If you want a real education in capitalized expenses, take a
look at seismic and oil drillers. They do things to the books companies like
MOVI only dream about.

I know it's a little hard to get down to specifics without discussing a
particular issue, but at the same time I'd rather not upset anyone by kicking
their favorite dog. It might be better to keep general discussions a bit more
general. I've enjoyed some of the recent discussions on cash flow and net nets.
Obviously opinions vary on what to look for or avoid while screening for value
but once you throw everything into the pot, the consensus isn't too far away
from practical application.

I have the fourth revised edition of Intelligent Investor, and on page 205,
which is in the chapter: Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor, under
the section labeled: Net-Current Asset( or "Bargain") Issues, it says:"The idea
here was to acquire as many issues as possible at a cost for each of less than
their book value in terms of net-current-assets alone--i.e., giving no value to
the plant account and other assets. Our purchases were made typically at
two-thirds or less of such stripped-down asset value. In most years we carried

Regarding MOVI, several years ago they revised their amortization policies
which were in the past far too liberal.
Now, I believe they are in line with reality. The biggest concern I have is
decreasing demand over time as video on demand gets stronger. Also note that
there has been some insider buying in the past year.
From the 10k.."The concept of revenue sharing and risk sharing between major
retailers and
the movie studios was embraced by the industry in 1998 and continued to grow
during 1999. Revenue sharing is a concept whereby retailers and movie studios
share the risks associated with the rental performance of individual titles.
Generally, retailers pay a small upfront fee for each copy leased under revenue
sharing, typically $0 to $10. As the movies are rented by consumers, the movie
studio receives a percentage of the revenue generated based on a predetermined
formula, which is generally less than fifty percent. After a period of time,
generally six months to a year, these movies are no longer subject to revenue
sharing and are either owned outright by the retailer, purchased from the movie
studio for a nominal amount or returned to the studio. Revenue sharing allows
retailers to vastly increase both copy depth and breadth for the consumers."

Some stolen comments from another MOVI holder.."While the comment made about
capitalizing new inventory is parially true, the conclusion is way off the
mark. Revenue sharing movies, the majority of inventory is expensed
immediately, thus not helping cashflow at all. Also when the amount of $$ put
into new stores and relocations is taken into account there is a lot of real
cash being spent on growth. The debt did decrease and they say new stores are
doing better than the average. I'll predict that debt will be cut in half in
the next year and that new stores will continue to open and that "real cashflow
will grow". As for chapter 11, that may be reality for Hollywood but couldn't
be further off the mark for movi. JMHO "

The thing to remember with Net current assets is that the inventory (as well as
other things) is often worth considerably less in a liquidation. So when you
buy net-nets, like I did with DIYH, and they close stores, inventory only
brings in the 65% range.

I think in Grahams day, he was buying old line companies for 2/3 NCA that were
often also selling at low p/e's and such.
Today, we get stocks where there are serious concerns over the assets. Take

Ahhh! 2/3! Thank's TimbaBear. I have the 4th edition also. The words are right
there in front of me and I missed it completely. I even had the page (205)
penciled in in the index ---I had written in my index that "net current assets"
were mentioned on pages 184,205,and 214-215. (As you know, there's no listing
in the index for "net current assets" -- one has to look under "bargain
issues".)

I don't mean sound like I'm discussing the number of angels that can fit on a
pin - it's just that I like to have some academic or some empirical support for
the types of investments I make.

I like and use the criterion of 2/3. I make an attempt to hold my nose and
close my eyes when I pick up net-nets that sell for 2/3 net current assets.
Those stocks would be cigar butts that smell and look like cigar butts and
which have nothing that makes them attractive. I try to pick up as many as I
can (diversify) as Dr. Graham implies. Sometimes though, I peek at what I am
about to pick up, and it looks so unattractive - I walk away. (That's my
problem -- I've no evidence that those avoided stocks don't work out okay.)

I'll also buy stocks selling at net current assets if I can see something
attractive about them - SCNYB for example, which will have earnings, an okay
price/sales and a very low p/e.

The best net-nets are those that others buy here or mention that they are
buying as a net-net on the respective Yahoo thread (Aside: you may see RJM's
monikers show up.) "Best" in the sense that it gives me some
comfort/encouragement that I'm not a total lone fool for buying such a stock.

I've only kept an informal record the past few years of the net-net performance
I've had. All such issues (2/3 of NCA)have worked out profitably. But some are
"sort of" profitable in that yes, I've sold these at higher prices than I paid
for, but I had to hold them 2-3 years to do it, so the ROI there might be poor.
I've no idea the overall profitability I've experienced. I suspect it's not as
good as Messieurs Clarke and Burry (who screen net-nets further) or RJM (who
seems to specialize in this aspect of investing).

rjm,

The paragraph above the one you quoted reads as follows:

"The domestic video retail industry includes both rentals and sales of
videocassettes; however, the majority of revenue is generated through the
rental
of prerecorded videocassettes. There are three primary pricing strategies that
the movie studios use to influence the relative levels of videocassette rentals
versus sales. First, videocassettes can be priced at relatively high levels,
typically between $60 and $75 ("rental priced movies"). These movies are
purchased by video specialty stores and are promoted primarily as rental
titles.
Second, videocassettes can be priced at relatively low levels, typically
between
$5 and $25 ("sell-through movies"). These movies are purchased by video
specialty stores and generally promoted for both rental and new videocassette
sales. Third, movie studios have developed revenue sharing and other copy depth
programs. Movies purchased under revenue sharing and other copy depth programs
result in larger quantities available to meet consumer demand. Movie studios
attempt to maximize total revenue from videocassette releases via the combined
utilization of all three pricing structures."

The paragraph related to amortization policy reads as follows:

"Effective July 6, 1998, the Company changed its method of amortizing
videocassette and video game rental inventory. The new method accelerates the
rate of amortization and was adopted as a result of an industry trend towards
significant increases in copy-depth availability from movie studios, which have
resulted in earlier satisfaction of consumer demand, thereby, accelerating the
rate of revenue recognition. Under this method, the cost of base stock
videocassettes, consisting of two copies per title for each store, is amortized
on an accelerated basis to a net book value of $8 over six months and to a $4
salvage value over the next thirty months. The cost of non-base stock
videocassettes, consisting of the third and succeeding copies of each title per
store, is amortized on an accelerated basis over six months to a net book value
of $4 which is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the next 30 months
or until the videocassette is sold, at which time the unamortized book value is
charged to cost of sales. Video games are amortized on a straight-line basis to
a $10 salvage value over eighteen months."

"At January 2, 2000, the Company had a working capital deficit of $12.9
million,
due to the accounting treatment of its rental inventory. Rental inventory is
treated as a noncurrent asset under generally accepted accounting principles
because it is a depreciable asset and is not an asset which is reasonably
expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business
cycle.
Although the rental of this inventory generates the major portion of the
Company's revenue, the classification of this asset as noncurrent results in
its
exclusion from working capital. The aggregate amount payable for this
inventory,
however, is reported as a current liability until paid and, accordingly, is
included in working capital. Consequently, the Company believes that working
capital is not an appropriate measure of its liquidity and it anticipates that
it will continue to operate with a working capital deficit."

As for comments stolen from another MOVI holder, I'll bet you a cookie without
even looking the comment came straight off a Yahoo message board. The insider
buys were all token purchases and the last one was in June. I see two entries
listed as "received as gift" to the tune of 2.7 million shares each. Mighty
generous of someone. I would consider the threat of video on demand to be the
least of your worries. You obviously like the stock and I honestly hope you do
okay with it. I don't see how a company with negative working capital can
viewed as a value play, but if you can squeeze profits out of it, more power to
you.

The info you provided, in my mind, is making MY case rather than yours.
The working capital deficit accounting treatment is such that it makes working
capital not a good tool for this kind of stock.
Back to the yahoo thread to help make my case..."For 2000, MOVI generated about
35 million free cash flow (Adjusted EBIDTA - interest payments - taxes). That
means they have 35 million to invest in their business. Which they did! They
opened/acquired 125 new stores, payed down debt by 5 million, and bought back 5
million of stock.

Going forward, for 2001, they plan on opening 75 new stores. The excess cash
available after this, will probably be used to pay down debt...this debt
paydown is an astounding 20 million. (long term debt is currently 40 million)

So, in about 1.5-2 years MOVI will be debt free, and will generate about 40-45
million in free cash to do as they please with... Consider
that the market cap of this company is still around 45 million....... "

To me value investing is having the forsight to see what things will be in a
few years. MOVI could well be debt free and cash flowing strong. In such case,
I suspect the shares will be much higher.

As for the token insider buying. I like to look at it as at least they bought.
Many stocks have NO insider buying whatsover. You make it sound like small
amounts are worse than none.

Well James, Thank You!

What a case of approach/avoidance here!

I had started to respond to your post with facts and figures, had rechecked the
filings to verify my numbers, had listed all the assets and their corresponding
discounting, had listed the liabilities as well, and was doing any calculations
manually(with a calculator, rather than letting the spreadsheet formula do
them)and I got near the end and discovered my manual answer was far different
from my spreadsheet answer.

After going through the spreadsheet formulas involved, I discovered the error,
corrected it, and got the corrected results.

You are right. TSCO is not a NetNet, neither is MTCH, in fact of the list I
posted last night the only two that still qualify are CVR and CNET.

It seems as though one of my formula changes resulted in a step of the
calculation being skipped, (the one where the liabilities get subtracted)and
the results then reflected net discounted asset value per share only, rather
than NetNet value.

It seems I now own two stocks that I wouldn't have purchased had they not been
NetNets. You don't know how impressed I am with myself about that!

These are good companies, and have passed a lot of my other screens to get to
this point, so I don't think I'm in any great danger of losing my investment, I
just don't have the margin of safety I thought I was buying.

I am surely glad that you took the time not only to look at the numbers, but to
post them back to me.

I am red-faced, but I'll get over it.

Timba
