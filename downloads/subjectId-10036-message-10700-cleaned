Archimedes: re: "Do you think cement producers will be spared in an economic
slowdown?"

The stocks of cement producers will drop, imo.

There are two other issues though (imo). How bad will earnings (or deficits)
really get? When, or will, the stock of CX come back (up)?

In discussing CX, we need to change our paradigm of what we consider a cement
company. (That's what CX would like us to do anyway -g-). I assume we USA
people think of cement as a bulk commodity item. (It's 95% bulk and 5% bagged
in the US.) CX says they specialize in selling a branded item to the retail
market- one bag at a time. (In Indonesia, for example, cement sales are 95%
bagged, 5% bulk). 70% of CX sales volume is bagged cement.

So for example, the "typical" Latin American consumer would buy the product,
when he/their family - only had available funds and would build their house
slowly, slowly --- maybe taking 10-20 years to do it. This consumer does not
buy on credit, so interest rates have no affect in dampening demand (assuming
the consumer continues to be employed). Demand is driven by demographics too.
New additions to family may require a new room; helping other homeowners
(family) as sons/daughters start families of their own.

What this means for CX's business model -- and they are not the only large
cement company playing this game -- is advertising for brand recognition,
educating the consumer on how the product is best used, and creating brand
loyalty, using exclusive and non-exclusive distributors.

Also helping CX, imo, is that they have - from what I read- a very excellent IT
focus. They know what each plant is producing and yielding, when, and under
what process conditions. Information and maybe knowledge which I hope they will
use to make better decisions and to be responsive to economic downturns in the
areas in which they compete.

My opinion is that given what I perceive to be long-term demand for the
product, an increasing higher standard of living worldwide, CX's broadly
diversified position across less-developed countries (They are here in the US
as well), and CX's decent financials - I bet that CX stock will recover from an
economic slowdown if/when it occurs.
(Although it certainly is possible that the stock could drop quickly and stay
down for quite some time; I hope I will have the patience and conviction to
hold on if this occurs.)

re: Case-New Holland

You realize that on June 30th, the share count is going to go up by roughly
80%, right? The company is going to issue about 120 million shares to Fiat at
this steal of a price. And they will still have $4 billion or so of debt.

The rights offering offers you the "opportunity" to buy at the same price as
Fiat converts at. Fiat's price is the average price for the 20 days of trading
ending June 30th. So if you want that price, you don't need the rights
offering. Just buy the stock.

This is a scam in my view. Management should be ashamed of this attempt to
mislead shareholders. The merger itself was an absolute travesty for
shareholders of New Holland.

I could easily make a case that CNH is a triple in three years, and I could
easily make a case that it goes bankrupt. There is so much leverage and
uncertainty that you can make it "worth" whatever you want it to be worth. I
have done the analysis, and I pass.

I sold New Holland the day the deal was announced, and I will not be back.

USX - US Steel Group
I know I have mentioned this one before, and I own the stock at about this
price, only because of a covered call position I put on.
Many are saying that the environment for steel producers is weakening with Mr.
G putting the brakes on the economy, and more foreign competition coming
onstream. Perhaps true.
One upside (significant IMHO) is that, according to Value Line, "the Group is
benefiting from improving prices in the oil patch, as tubular steels comprise a
larger share of this producer's sales mix than is the case at any other U.S.
integrated mill." JP Morgan likes Big Steel, and has mentioned the possibility
that they may spin out their oil field tubular goods operation, saying that
this part of the operation would be valued at $11/share.
Stock yields above 4.5%, and is trading close to a 52 week low.
As with Paul, I've been wrong many, many times before, but the risk reward on
this one looks pretty good IMHO.

Paul, I may be overexposed to the retail sector, and I am certainly overexposed
to the housing sector, but I do not mind in the least.

My record is decent in retail and related.

losers -- ANF, KM, AMES. I hate KM and wonder why I bought it.

even -- JNY, MAXS (+ a little, sold), EBSC (+ a little , sold)

winners -- BL, CLE, PLCE ++, ROST++ (sold), PSUN (new).

Thinking of buying my ROST back again. Will probably do it next week. KSS is
fun to watch. I has to crash and I would love to have the courage to short it.

PSUN is a mental favorite, since I owned it for a nice while last year.

TECHNOLOGIES --
CPWR is a tech I bought right before it crashed, and then I doubled up. It
appears to be coming back. I still own PLT and relly think it is a long term
winner with voice recognition and other audio uses of web/computers in the
future. I posted on PLT a few times with no takers. It is a no brainer like
SYMC (as many have posted), because they both are in a sweet spot sector.

From:Paul Senior

Grommit, I'll consider your purchase of RGC an affirmation of the undervalued
nature of this stock. Though of course, I've been wrong many, many times before
-g-.

ROST and SKS. Ross is tough for me. I went back and looked at it and at Mike
Burry's writeup. I have been following Saks (SKS) for several months. Saks
looks to be the mirror image of ROST. Ross has wonderful returns on equity and
returns on assets. (Done without LTD) Good sales and earnings growth. SAKS has
none of this. (aside: I believe SKS sales 'growth' is due to mergers-- unlike
the recent same store sales growth which ROST delivers.)

I just do not know what is key here in evaluating these retailers. I'll guess
it's sales growth (ROST has it, SKS does not) and maybe, p/e expansion. Neither
company has been awarded a consistently higher p/e. SAKS has sold in each of
the past five years for higher p/e 's (although on lower absolute earnings),
higher price/sales and higher price/book (which may be a meaningless ratio for
these retailers.) If I buy Saks now I would be betting that the stock would or
could -somehow- return to those higher numbers. With ROST, the current
price/sales, p/e, price/book is maybe midway where it's been in the past few
years. On that basis, to me, the stock is still not valued as inexpensively as
SAKS.
Anecodatally, I've shopped at Saks and its Bergdorf Goodman stores in NYC and
in Southern California. Some stores (NYC) are crowded with shoppers, other
stores seem dead. And I've shopped at ROSS. With ROSS, maybe it's their great
back office or buying ability. The stuff is nothing that other off-price
retailers can't deliver (if I recall). On the other hand, I find empty Saks
stores (which could be a function of the time of my trips - 1:30 pm weekday)
very sad, and overpriced (imo, of course) "stuff" or "fashion" very
off-putting. OTOH again, there may be only 3 large chains peddling to the
carriage trade - say Neiman, Nordstrom, and Saks. So the 'brand' may have
value. As Mike has noted in his writeup, there's not much insider buying at
Ross lately. But for Saks, you do see some in the past few months and at higher
prices than the low Saks is flirting with now.

Both SKS and ROST have low p/e ratios now and going forward (based on analysts'
estimates). I tend to see Saks as a washed out stock in a business that's
suffering at least for now (and maybe it is terminal --death by 1000 cuts). I
look at ROST, not so much as a value stock like Saks might be, but more like a
discarded growth-type stock. And having a business model that requires very
close attention to price competition. The sales and earnings growth are still
there, but people's willingness to pay for them in a higher stock price
apparently is not (for now anyway).

Not that it's necessarily a decision to buy one company or the other. I could
by both. Or maybe neither. For now, I'm very close to starting a small
exploratory position in Saks.

re: REL
I figure REL has book value of $4-7 a share conservatively, not the $10 or 12
which you will see in disclosures. What this company most needs is a strong
acquirer to put out the fire. Or maybe the leverage is so great that the case
is terminal. There is bankruptcy risk here.

When I consider my risk-reward, I notice that bankruptcies are not going to
zero immediately. The speculators move in and bounce the stock around. Thats
why I say there is a decent shot I get out of my small position at about what I
paid if I wait a bit. But that is assuming the deal doesn't happen.

If the deal goes through, I just bought LUK ($26) for $17 a share.

There are several ways this could end up. 1) Deal goes through, 2) Price is
lowered, 3) LUK walks and I get lucky and get to sell at 1 3/4, 4) LUK walks
and I get 50 cents.
I didn't say I see a margin of safety here, but the probability-weighted return
seems positive in my view. LUK wouldn't have made the bid if they didn't see
something good here, and these guys are bottom fishers - very good ones.

I didn't bet the farm on this one, though later I may wish I did. It is a small
position because I perceive some probability of losing a big part of my

re: sym: they primarily sell suits/ties, is that right? If so, then my opinion
is that relaxing of business dress codes and less-formal men's fashions
contributed and will continue to contribute to reductions in
sales/margins/profits for this co. and its competitors.

Since this company is family controlled and there is much assets associated
with the firm, the management team is able to freely milk the company (at
stockholders expense) for salaries, perks, nepotism. (First reason not to load
up the truck on this stock.)

Sym is, or is close to being, a net-net. While sym may be an exceptional case
(I don't see why though), because it falls in this general net-net category, it
should be treated as such, imo. A position is warranted. But not loading up the

Or is it that my idea is different from other people's regarding what "loading

Jim, looks like you've found GTSI a cow you can occasionally milk.

I find that many undervalued stocks do rise with a pop. Mostly small or micro
caps, but not always. It's impossible to predict when this will happen (with
one exception: a person will see a greater probability of a pop after he/she
has got tired, got exasperated, and sold the thing -g-).

These pops are significant (one sells one's shares). To me, this is one more
reason I'm against pig-at-trough investing - whereby a person eliminates one
underperforming, undervalued stock because the person has found a stock with
seemingly better prospects. It's mostly not possible, imo, to predict which or

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=13900421

(I read the story in the Times and then saw the story on SI's WAVX thread. I
assume I am not violating any copyright laws by reposting the SI link.)

What's frightening about the story to me is that it pokes into my own
experience and understanding in ways that resonate but that I can't really
explain. How it's scary that normal people who should know better, can get
hooked on a particular technology idea or a stock and keep committing time,
effort, money to it so that it becomes a significant part of their life. How
that intelligent, family-centered people who (from what I can see) have no
business experience, no business talent, no sense of value investing, who have
jobs that don't go anywhere, but who are young enough to have dreams-- still
can't get it anywhere near right when they have acquired millions of dollars of
stock market gains by parlaying under $100k on margin. (I'm not intending to be
snotty or disparaging to the couples profiled--I'm more worried that I could be
hurt bad by the market too.) That neither couple can't say "enough" or "slow
down" when they've made a small fortune -- that if they had goals - even $2M+
was not enough, BUT that $2M+ was so much more than what they actually were
willing to use, to spend (they were only willing to part with enough to go on a
clothes shopping spree for their kids). I mean what's the point -- with 0,
100K, 1M, 2M, maybe even if they made 5M - they couldn't make themselves take
money out of their accounts to buy anything of substance or retire or
contribute to charity. (Which I see as a value investor's issue too. Value
types, imo, generalized a class, are much better at making money than spending
it. An issue of balance.) For the couples profiled, they wanted more and used
so much margin to get there. They apparently never thought of reducing their
margin.

And it's something about how married couples ought to work together. Here the
husbands seemed addicted. The wives amused/confused onlookers. Not bringing the
wives in to understand the margin ramifications was an error. Maybe the men
knowing they were overextended, risking the family fortune, being afraid to
discuss issues with spouses who, imo, seemed to have better balance, who
could've/would've supported their husbands by maybe toning down the men's greed
or their addiction to daily price movements, their interent chats.

And something insidious also about chat rooms that do provide people with
support. Very dangerous. Get sucked into a cult--- we, we -- we know and we are
right, hang in there, don't sell, stock is going higher, higher, we need your
positive contribution to our thread, we value you, why would you sell and leave
our group, our team, our family.

And finally, when it was over, what did they learn? These two guys who are
teachers/college administrators. Anything from the masters - Buffett,
Templeton, Graham, Ruane, Fisher, Trane ----g-- I will even drop so low as to
mention O'Neill of momentum investing (Investor's Business Daily)? Apparently
there's nothing to learn from the records or teachings or books of people who
talk about value or growth or being concentrated-but-careful. Right back into
WAVX they went trying to build up capital by short term swings. Maybe they
learned about not having so much margin, about taking some gains when the gain
taking is good. OTOH, maybe they believe if they could do it once - make a
quick fortune in the stock market- they can do it again.

Ah well, not only is it scary, it's sad.

This cuts pretty close to home for me as I have owned WAVX on and off and sold
most of it just this week after reviewing the financials. It was not a value
play, and certainly benefited from the market euphoria. Anyone who puts a huge
percentage of their equity, let alone margin in a development stage company is
asking for trouble. I would assume that most of the companies you invest in
have tangible assets and cash flow, and that you are not on too much margin.

Paul,others interested in REITS. Has anyone had experience with liquidation of
company with hard assets? I have Center Trust Realty(CTA) convertible
debentures and have always considered them safe because of the reasonably solid
assets backing them up. After seeing the stock drop to 5 year low I researched
current status and and now am truly puzzled.
http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/comment/buildingblocks/940088.html
The company has a stated goal to sell mature shopping centers so that the Jan
2001 debentures can be redeemed. They have cut their dividend to .21 a quarter
and will be pulled out of the Russell 2000. That may be the cause of the drop
in price. But a company with a 16% yield and what I believe to be a solid 8
dollar book should not be a risk at 5 1/8. What might I expect if they are not
successful in their selling of mature properties? The reason is that I am
considering the stock as value buy since there is a possibility of the whole
shebang being sold. Has anyone had experience in this kind of situation.

Allen, a quick glance at the numbers, and that's all it was, tells me the
problem here is debt. I would never be claim a margin of safety on a real
estate company with 70% debt to equity. You could make a lot of money on this
if you're right - leverage works both ways. I prefer conservative REITs, and
this looks like a different game. It sounds like you own the debt, but it also
sounds like they are selling assets. Be careful. What kind of management are
you dealing with here?

That said, community shopping centers (supermarkets), if they are reasonably
high quality assets, are probably among the safest of real estate assets in a
downturn.

Couple of stock ideas: HON, BMHC.

I added to my position in BMHC today. I've mentioned this company before. They
specialize in building supplies for contractors. The financial numbers look
okay - to me anyway. One issue is whether the business will fall off or that
they might continue to suffer as home building stocks also suffer. For me,
bigger negative is that there's insider selling even though the stock already
seems pretty inexpensive.

I started an exploratory position in Honeywell. On an absolute value basis,
I'll call the stock @40 fairly priced or even too expensive in this market
where so many value-priced bargains still exist. OTOH, for this DOW component
to be so heavily sold down today because they will miss earnings by a few cents
- that seems excessive. Maybe this industrial - old economy - company's
earnings and stock performance are a metaphor for what can be expected if the
economy slows. And maybe the selling in HON isn't over. But with a small
exploratory position, my $ risk isn't too bad while I wait to learn more about
the issues holding HON down. For now, my belief is that the stock will
"eventually" recover to 50-60 levels where its traded from mid-1999 (since the
AlliedSignal acquisition, I believe).

This is an interesting story I spent more than a few minutes reviewing it-
Lazard Freres bought asizable stake stake in the company at around $15 a share
and then the company bought out the original family that I guess put the
company together. yahoo rumors are that LF was very unhappy with the work that
the partner in charge of this did and he and LF have parted company. Now there
is something like $120MM of convertible debt due 6/1/2001 I think and the
company has lots of leveraged assets for sale trying to come up with repayment.
The critical question maybe what the existing tenants options are as far as
renewals and how much downward negotiating pressure can be put on by the
tenants of thse mature malls. I do not CA real well so what may be important
are the demographic trends and customer options in each area. Also the impact
of more rate increases on the profits of this company. The debt sure makes
everything more difficult to assess.

this company?

Date:6/21/2000 6:49:00 AM
From:cpabobp

I don't have any first hand knowledge about MAH/GON yet, but I'll try over the
next few days. On the surface, I'd say that both companies look fairly
undervalued. GON seems to be a little better since they will get 50% of the
company with slightly less than 50% of the stock currently outstanding.
Unfortunately, I do mean "fairly" undervalued because I think the market has
reason for concern about a few issues.

GON had me a little puzzled with their 10Q. Here are a couple quotes that
seemed a little too corny:

"The earnings stability benefit of Geon's strategic raw material investment is
being demonstrated."
---How many people actually pat themselves on the back for maintaining similar
margins to prior years?

"The use of cash in operating activities increased by $26.7 million from the
same period last year, principally due to the non-cash earnings of equity
affiliates of $18.7 million in 2000..."
---Last I checked, it didn't take a pre-schooler to tell you that non-cash
earnings DO NOT affect cash flow, hence the purpose of removing them on the
cash flow statement. Wouldn't their inability to collect A/R in a timely
fashion play a bigger role in negative cash flow? A/R has increased
significantly, but remains less than 45 days sales which I'd say isn't too bad.
But I'm a stickler for A/R collections and don't see a valid reason for that
increase.

Who writes this stuff anyway?

Also, if this is a 50/50 deal, how is it that the dominant player seems to be
GON, when they have 1/2 the sales of MAH. I understand the market has them
valued equally, but why? What is so bad about MAH that deserves 1/2 the value
of GON? Is the management at either company that competent? That is what I'll
try to find out this week.

And finally, I wouldn't trust McDonald Investments to walk my dog, let alone
represent my interest in a merger. They'd sell their own mother to make a buck.

Is anyone looking at the stocks in the cruise industry - CCL and RCL?
The stocks are being hit by high oil prices, decreasing yields (as I understand
it, not occupancy, but what would be the cruise equivalent of REVPAR, or
revenue per available room). This decrease in REVPAR I am guessing is partially
being brought on by increasing capacity from new ship introductions (I am
sailing on a huge new RCL ship, the Explorer, this fall, so maybe I'll
benefit;>)).
Still, the stocks are as cheap as they've been in ages, RCL below book, both
now have modest multiples.
I would be more inclined to look at CCL, which has a more diversified cruise

LEG, which somebody (Mike B) brought to the thread a few months ago: I'm

Leg is a company that grows by acquisitions and (I am guessing), tough cost

cyclical businesses which now apparently are areas to be avoided.

I've bought just a very small amount as an exploratory position.

One very interesting company in the business is Sam Zell's hodgepodge (typical
of him -g-) American Classic Voyages (AMCV). A key point here is that they have
a monopoly position in the Hawaiian market (I've forgotten what that monopoly
exactly entails - something about sole/exclusive rights for several years for
their ships traveling among the islands or maybe between mainland US and
Hawaii.) Stock, at lows, is still too risky for me though.

little by little, that has become a huge position for me with an average cost
around 9. Initiated a position in PCAR at 40 1/2 today. I'll buy CAT and

Adding to ANF as well. I'll buy DE a few points lower. Almost done selling my

Papaya King,
Hi PK. A quick look at the chart says 25 could hold and if not its likely 21
will. I've been buying the last two days, mostly at the close yesterday. To me
that computes a downside of 4 bucks compared to an upside of 25 to 50! With the
PGM's at high prices and SWC's hedges much more favorable than in the past,
progress being made on increased production at Stillwater and the future East
Boulder, I don't believe the odds are against me.

Progress for Stillwater has been slower than expected, but what else is new for
mining companies, ggg. SWC has been prone to shakeouts before, to me this looks
like another chance to catch the bargains falling out of the shakeout tree.

If it hits 20 I may mortgage the house, VBG.

Nacco (NC) continues to drift lower, though it was way too cheap about 10
points ago. The company has three unrelated businesses, with the highest
leverage to forklifts. There is an accounting glitch here that makes the debt
look much higher than it actually is. The company has about $410 million of
real debt.

The multiples are extraordinarily low considering that this is a decently
profitable company. Enterprise Value/EBITDA of 2.9x, P/Book of 0.5x,
Price/Earnings of 5.2x, price/sales of 0.3.

Very cheap, and management has said that their earnings cycle has bottomed and
will turn up noticeably in the third quarter. That's the catalyst. For now, I'm
just accumulating stock at these ridiculous prices.

My valuation is in the 70-100 range. It trades at 34.

Jim, regarding your purchases, potential purchases. I've bought many of the
stocks on your list. I still have them, and like you, I have had an up/down
ride with some of them.

Couple of things I would like to point out. First I notice the predominant
category of the stocks you/we are looking at consist of those slow-growing,
heartland industrial and downtrodden stocks in cyclical businesses. As value
investors, we (I'll presume myself into this class) have to go where the values
are, yet at some at some point - I don't know where it is, but I myself may be
near it - I suggest one ought to limit the risk of committing so much of one's
funds to any particular category. (That would be imo - and I could very well be
wrong.)
Secondly, it seems to me the stocks you list are the stocks you follow and have
mentioned before. This suggests you are averaging down, rather than expanding
the net to catch other value stocks. Concentrating, I guess, is what people who
do in-depth research do. Whereas, for example with me, I have a position in CMH
and have added to it as it's dropped, but now I've stopped. As fine a company
as CMH is, I've taken as much as I will (note: -g- subject to reassessment).
You may be comfortable in determining that the stocks you are adding to now are
as good bets to capture a short term move, or even a long term move as anything
else- but I would rather diversify with my investable funds.

Here are a few other stocks I'm interested in:

Whirlpool (WHR), some downside risk still, but upside potential is there too.
MarineMax (HZO)--- A boat dealer consolidator with lots of debt and insider
sales and very possibly the last thing anybody wants going into a recession.
Sensible people should probably (95%) avoid HZO.
SEMI - while it trades higher than I normally would consider buying, the
alleged continuance of the good business demand for semiconductor components
implies that SEMI's business (they are primarily a distributor) will continue
to be very good also.
DNB - somewhere around here (30) is an okay place to start or add to positions.
If Mr. Buffett bought at about 25-26 (just guessing here-- I defer to Buffett
followers who might know prices where he bought), then potential for DNB stock
at 30 is still pretty good, especially as we approach spinoff. To see 26 again
would be a gift imo (if there were no adverse news announcements).
SKS - SAKS. It's at lows (like many retailers), trying to resolve its problems,
with lots of insider buying. An alternative, imo, to adding to ANF.
EW Scripps A (SSP)- I'm monitoring this one still (ref: Twister's discussion on
Buffettology thread)

PCCLF I believe, also some activity in Latin America. Lastly the company has an
agreement with Delta Airlines, COmpaq and ? to offer passengers workspace and
internet access in airports and internet access on delta planes. I think all of
that is worth a lot more than $1-2. However the company building these assets
will probably go through its cash and more. On the otherhand PCCLF purchased
around 20% of the company at around $25 a share less than 5 months ago. I
previously purchased this stock in the low 20s and sold it in the high 30s

Armin, yes, lot of good price movement today on several of the stocks mentioned
here before. I see some exceptional upward moves in a couple that I own.

For balance, I would like to list some stocks that I've had that haven't done
well. These would include:

GHV - health care for the elderly. Sold my position at 1/4. I'm too embarrassed
to give the price I bought at two years ago.

USU - uranium fuel enrichment services. I gave up @ 4 7/16. They are closing
plants. Their estimate of their earnings for '01 and '02 indicates to me stock
is fairly priced at current levels. Anybody with better info./knowledge let me
know and I'll consider reestablishing a position after 30 days (wash rule).

OWC- Owens Corning. Announced lower earnings today, but more importantly, imo,
are taking a 700M-1B charge more for their asbestos liability. And they are
still not finished evaluating their risk here. Well, if after all this time,
they aren't (lawsuits are still coming in), then I don't want to be around. I
was warned by at least one person on this thread when I posted that I was
buying and also when adding to it, but I did not listen... I was wrong. (fwiw,
OWC is a stock recommended by John Neff. That old war horse might make it work,
but he and it are too tough for me.) I'm out today.

CCRO - ClinTrials Research does contract research on drugs. I bought the stock
several years ago because of the excellent track record of the founder in
building and selling a previous business. Although the stock looks okay on p/bk

that's in, I've taken 1/2 my holdings off the table and redeployed funds
elsewhere. (All the pharmaceutical contract research co's are down-- I believe
I'm just losing patience with CCRO.)

Other stocks hitting new lows which I own include couple in the steel industry.
Also Honeywell (HON) which continues to drift down (management credibility is
shot plus fear of new earnings 'restatements') and NSI (National Service
Industry. I am guessing people are selling NSI in expectation that
soon-to-be-announced earnings will be lower than expected.) Imo, for value
investors, NSI is a stock that does offer quite a bit of value and ought to be
looked at (although maybe after earnings are announced -g-).

============
Amin (and anyone else who may be interested), I've been looking at the stocks
in the data storage business. I've been a follower of Storage Technology for
many years. I've recently looked at it again and two others: ADIC and EXBT.
I've started a small position in EXBT because some of their new products have a
potential to get them to profitability. This would do wonders for the stock
(imo). Meanwhile the stock's below book value and there's not too much long
term debt. OTOH, the book value has been generally decreasing, the company's
had a couple of bad years already, and my record regarding data storage stock
picks is worse than pathetic.

Funny Paul , I just started a position in ADIC, because it looked cheap and had
some insider buying, and the technicals had turned positive. As far as CCROs
go- I briefly owned QTRN twice because it looked cheap to me and I might have
mentioned it. I sold both times because it was a losing position and now it is
about half of where it was the first time I bought it. I am watching it as
well. It occurs to me that buying an undervalued company sounds good, but we
don;t know when the catalyst is going to come along that will give us our
profit. In general, it seems that unless it is a tech stock 40% is a great
profit in those situations and for the most part I am best off taking the money
and moving on. I mentioned that X the tracking stock for US Steel had a real
nice writeup in Barrons, but I wonder what is the catalyst that will make move
up in price? USU I also got out of with a small loss. I do not follow it
anymore and don't think I am qualified or was ever qualified to analyze its
prospects. Sounds like one needs to be an expert on both the market for their
product and understand all the politics involved.

I'm not fretting about it. It still has support above 50. It breaks 50 and
still no news, and I'll be worried enough to dump it like I dumped AT & T today
- a stock that continues to make new lows. That thing's ridiculously cheap, but
I'm not going to hang on as it gets even more ridiculously cheap. Thinking of

I picked up some LIQB at a nice price today.

Over the last 5 years they have reduced the number of shares by 30%, they have
no debt, ROE over 25%, profit margin improving to 11%, dropped from 15+ to 11
1/2 in that time period also. Sales pretty flat however.

Plastic resin (raw material) probably going up with oil prices, so I expect a
little deterioration in profit levels.

VP of sales bought $500K of stock in April at $46.88. Price in that ballpark
now.

Grommit, I believe LIQB will be a profitable investment for you. After all,
there are now 3 value thread posters who've bought. The magic 3 number!

I've followed LIQB occasionally since 1996. Wayne Crimi would be the thread
expert though,imo. There is a lot to like about LIQB-- for me the chief thing
is the high and (so far) sustainable ROE (and no l.t. debt) coupled with a low
stock price.

The two things I do not like about the company are:

Inadequate (imo) revenue growth
Heavy cronyism among the co. founder and BOD

I see that this stock often traded in the past couple of years @ $50-55. Given
its relatively low no. sh. outstanding, I'd not be surprised to see a small
push get the stock up there again. To get higher than that range, would require
some good corporate news, I'd guess.

Paul,
I do not have a position in LIQB

aside: Grommit, the VP of Sales who bought 500k worth @ $46.88 seems to be a
new member of senior management who had no stock prior to his purchase. The
previous(?) VP Sales sold his shares @53.63 on 10 Sept. '99, according to
Yahoo. Maybe the new guy was loaned the money by the corp. (?)

Armin, on SOFN, The company has a market cap of near $300 million and minor
sales. In a couple of years, at their burn rate, much of that cash will be gone
and maybe they will be doing $50 million sales. It would seem that 6 times
sales would be a reasonable valuation then, so I do not see the potential. I do
not like to rely on a bigger fool to pay 20 times sales for me to make money.

%BOM---------------------
Date:6/27/2000 1:47:00 AM
From:Michael Burry

As you know, I have a simple philosophy: sell on new lows.
There are two reasons for this:
1) Many people do this. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. I try to do it
quicker.
2) If I know something is a fundamental value and it breaks to new lows, the
selling is irrational by definition and I don't want to be in the way of
irrational selling. Better to wait for the buyers to show where they are
willing to step up and give support.

I suffered for several years trying to be stubborn in the face of irrational
selling and all it got me was a lot of 50% haircuts on stocks that had already
been too cheap. One of the biggest lessons I've learned was that PE 8 stocks
can become PE 4 stocks and stay that way for a long time. AT&T's long-distance
business is getting close to trading for 1X EBITDA, yet everyone looks at it
like this big albatross around T's neck. Maybe in the future I'll get the
long-distance biz for free. All we need is another $15 billion in lost market
cap.

That said, I love your rhetorical questions. Why do you think AT&T is getting
hit?

Armin, I too think 30-40% is great for non-tech companies without any immediate
catalyst. But at the same time I try to remind myself of the reasons I got into
the stock, and the long-term nature of value investing. More times than not I
do end up taking profits off the table, but I'm trying to become more
long-term.

Two other issues:
1) OCR announced an earnings & revenue shortfall. I owned them during part of
their recent upswing over the past year, and think 1st) the move up to 18ish
was over-speculation and not deserved and 2nd) yesterday's selloff was
overdone. I have been watching and playing OCR for about 2 years and don't
think yesterday's news was much of a surprise, actually I expected as much. I
started an exploratory position near the close to see if I may get a little
bounce at today's open, but don't expect to invest anything major until it
settles down. The support level that held last summer was around $7, and I'd
love to see that again but I'm not sure it will happen. On the negative side,
one of their competitors NCSS has had some major fraud going on and has gone
from $12 to less than a buck in 15 months or so. So even though I think the
downside for OCR may be limited from here, they could end up in the toilet with
NCSS. (P.S. Don't touch NCSS with a 10 foot pole).

2) ECIL has me on the fence. I have a hard time resisting the urge to take
profits on anyone after a 40% rise in about a month. Are there any ECIL holders
that have any compelling reasons to hold? I'm not sure I'd be willing to bite
on the recent rumors that CSCO is considering buying them. And speaking of
price catalysts, I hate to see all the ECIL Press releases as the prime mover
of the stock. Where's some external verification or I guess we should wait
until earnings season???

LIQB another Ohio company.

This one's a little closer to home. I'd like to add to Paul's negatives:

1) Inventories have increased 4 out of the last 5 quarters, while revenues and
COS have been flat. I understand that y2k had some impact on this, but I would
hate to see the inventory build up (even as small as it is) lead to other
problems or slowdowns.

2) LIQB has very low daily volume. With all the other values out there, I'd
hate to try and unload shares when there just aren't that many buyers. I've
done it before, but I can't say I like it too much.

3) I don't think you will find LIQB valued any differently than some of their
competitors.

While I think LIQB is a good company to invest in, I don't think the timing is
right for what I would say is a limited upside (10-15%)

This is my opinion only, and I've been wrong many many times before.

After THQI I no longer try to predict revenues or earnings.
SOFN has imho viable businesses and strong partners. What you are saying about
SOFN you could have said about cable and cellular companies when they were just
starting out. SOFN will be building out these networks and will be building
cash flow which it or its acquirer/ partners will be able to borrow against.
Its gpms should be very high and so should its depreciation. Pacific Cyberworks
its partners in asia has access to lots of capital. Assuming you are correct
about it doing $50MM in revenues in 2 years- what would it be in the following
20 years after that? Because that will ultimately determine the valuation of
the company?

There are a lot of rural cable systems out there, and SOFN is doing an
excellent job of getting agreements with many of them.
Lastly I note that the ceo has made purchases and exercised options throughout
2000 and has not sold any shares even at the stocks highs which was around 50.
So he thinks very highly of his company's prospects as do I . and that pacific
cyberworks purchased around 20% of the company paying $25 per share. I would
rather put my money with the insiders than against them.

Armin, I basically know nothing about SOFN. I was just trying to make the point
that valuations of 20-50 times sales of this era, when they should be 20-50
times earnings, are not likely to be prevalent at some future point in time, in
my opinion. The company is not much more than a development stage company it
appears, similar to many biotechs. Valuation of this kind of company often
depends on the whim of the market, not on sales (and earnings) you can see.
Good luck. I hope you don't need it.

you are exactly right it is a development stage company except that it is
selling for less than book, has $8.50 in cash, there aren't 10MM options
outstanding at .25, its got intellectual property, strong partners, insider
buying rather than selling, and I believe a viable business, plus a substantial
investor who has invested his money at twice what it costs now.
BTW valuation always depends on the whim of the market unless there is a cash
buyout for your shares. You are assuming that the market will value peak
profits at a certain level. I am assuming that the market will value growing
businesses at a certain level which will be more than it is now. I can use all
the luck I can get on all of my investments.

X - the writeup on X is very interesting IMHO (disclosure - long X), plus
Merrill has given a positive mention to X today.
The piece in Barrons placed a potential "asset value" on X of $100/share. That
is, obviously, just one person's opinion. Interesting, nonetheless, even if you
back out all liabilities - you still have a price one he!! of a lot higher than
a tad less than $20/share, where X is currently.
It's exposure to the oil patch (which is mentioned in the Barrons' piece), as
well as about a 5% dividend yield are two of its more attractive
characteristics IMHO.

Re: DNB, two questions.

[just doubled position...] knowing that the catalyst (spin-off of Moodys) will
come within months.

Why is the spin-off a catalyst? (Is it because Moody's will then get a higher
multiple, so that, post spin-off, New D&B plus Moody's will be valued higher
than DNB is today?)

Second, why is the D&B business not as desirable as Moody's? Less of a moat?
More capital intensive? I must admit, without knowing the business too well,
they do seem like a pretty natural pair of businesses to put together.

Adding also to my small position in DNB today.

I offer what I believe are the following "facts":

1. Warren Buffett has bought about 15% of DNB at about $26/sh on average.

2. Mr. Buffett has never lost money on any stock he's ever purchased when we
are talking about this level of investment.

3. In the few times I've followed Mr. Buffett into his stocks or kept the
stocks I've owned that he's subsequently bought into, I've made money. (May be
too soon to tell about CTO though.)

4. There will be a spin off.

5. I do not know what true, intrinsic, fair value is for DNB.

I believe the time factor is an important consideration. Imo, the closer we get
to the spin off, the more likely the stock is to move away from $26. (I have
absolutely no facts to support this contention though.) Since I assume
"everyone" who would consider selling knows that Mr. Buffett has bought the
stock at $26, potential sellers would be thinking twice about giving up DNB at
the "too low" price of $26. So $29-30 becomes an okay place to buy DNB now,
imo. Secondly, while there's a catalyst (the spin off), it may take quite some
time for the full value of the two companies to be reflected in the market.
They may never reach full/fair value. Nevertheless, my bet is that I can make
an investor's profit if I buy here, but I must be able to HOLD ON. Which can be
tough for me.

("investor's profit" as compared to trader's profit which I define as scalping
a few points from any short term moves in the stock. ---- And imo it looks like
there may be trading profit opportunities also for those nimble enough.)

Fwiw, and I've been wrong many, many times before, especially so like now when
I believe I've got it figured right.

SOFN hit $50 a share in February based on buyout interest. >The consolidation

Hong Kong-based internet company headed by Richard Li, had agreed to invest

roll out its Network of the World interactive TV service.

Moodys is the better business by far. Seems like Moodys just chugs along and

just hope the DNB stock holds up for a few minutes after the spinoff so I can
get rid of it at a reasonable price and keep the Moodys. I don't have this one

EPRE worth $8.95 a share regardless of the SWBD investment. Cash is $3.35 a

equity in Software.com $2.00 sh $46M
Cash reserved for SWBD $3.60sh $83M

Total is $8.95 a share without a business or $206M.

EPRE has a 40% stake in SWBD but since the value of that (investment) is at
breakeven with the cash position there is no additional value. I suspect that
the shorts have designs to drive the price lower, but this is a risky move.
EPRE is not going broke or burning cash very fast. I will buy at any price
