I like EONGY - a German/European utility. Their dividend projecting is 1.5 Euro
for Y2008. Stock trades at 19.XX Euro. They own a large fleet of power plants
in many European countries and run an integrated gas business and own power
grids as well. they piled on quite a bit of debt due to investments and
expansion but they are still selling bonds at 5.XX% interest rates. A- credit
rating.

Regardless of what utility you buy, first look at their bond yields, IMO. I'd
also be careful with utilities that own lot's of coal wheezers. The carbon caps
make them way more expensive to operate and they will have to invest lot's of
money to keep them operating.

Well after spending funds on EEQ (rebuy), UL (more of the same), a few more

I am getting bullish on Energy. It may be early but I have a hard time
believing that crude is going to stay down here. i have an even harder time
believing that US NG is staying at 4$/mcfe for long since the Rig count is down
to <1000 from the peak of 1600 rigs in September already. This is going to be a
disaster in the making and I don't even think an economy in shambles is going
to prevent NG from shooting up.

Spectra Energy Corp. (SE) should benefit from the long term rise in NG rates.
The stock has been trading as if they are going to slash their dividend. Even
if they cut it by 50%, it should yield over 4% at the current stock price. EEQ
is well positioned too.

I also own COP which has one of the largest NG reserves of the integrators and
is selling at a multi year low and yielding over 5%. BP also has large NG
reserves but is not my favorite.

I think the key for selecting a safe owner and distributor of NG is to focus on
their current yield (payout coverage), future cash flows (look at CapX
investments), management and overall debt. Too much debt is a red flag
especially if they pay a high dividend.

I currently own SE, TRP, COP, BP, EEQ, EP and UGI. I also own PWE (now selling
at a multi year low) a Canadian trust with a very large NG component. I
recently added to SE and COP and sold some BP and UGI at higher prices. I am
always looking for other similar companies to add to my small basket of NG
exploration & distribution companies.

Bonds/preferreds versus common,

Somebody recently posted the RCL trust preferred CWZ. I bought some of that. I
also bought some PYK (Goldman Sach trust preferred). Figured with all their
guys in the government, that their bonds would be ok. I sold that already after

"At the same time, preferreds of financials (while super cheap) scare me." I
agree. WFC pref yields 14% or 15%, but their balance sheet still might have
risk. Why try to guess the value of the mortgages on the books. I guess you
could just follow WB and assume he did his homework.

However many reit prefs are paying more, and the assets are probably less
risky. The stocks are less known and unfollowed. Very low volumes so their
pricing is more likely to be out-of-whack.

Example:
FR just came out with earnings. I do not own the common due to their debt/eq
higher than my limit. But I do own FR-K. FR-K div is $1.81 & stock price is
$7.25 = 25%. What am I missing?

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/First-Industrial-Realty-Trust-prnews-14520572.htm

My take aways:
1. They are profitable, and expect to earn $1.34 in 2009.
2. The debt maturities seem to be handled.
3. They are paying pref dividends.
4. Common dividends will be limited to the legal requirement.
5. They have pay the common eventually, and to pay the common, they have to
keep paying the preferred.
6. They will sell assets over time to reduce the debt level.
7. Let me repeat number 1, they are making money, even with worst case vacancy
assumptions.

The First Industrial team delivered solid portfolio results in 2008,
maintaining strong tenant retention and in-service occupancy levels throughout
the year... "With less than $150 million due through the end of 2010, we have a
manageable debt maturity schedule...

Yes it's easier to get gas oversupply because gas resources deplete faster
(except the shale, but even shale has a very strong decay during the first year
of operation) and the NG market in North America is local. By the same logic I
expect the supply situation to turn faster for NG than for oil.

I a just no sure how to play this yet. today i was stopped out of SE at 11.9$
Ouch! The pipeline companies are OK because they pay while you wait, but SE is
not extraordinary cheap at this point, I think. I think the 1$ dividend is
somewhat safe since they raised capital that should be enough to finance the
growth projects in Y2009 so a tight coverage should be alright.

I am considering WMB which has a strong pipeline business too but their
midstream is suffering and so is their E&P in the Rockies. This on seems to be
valued below book value although I am not sure how safe the book value is - we
have seen quite a few asset writedowns with E&P's.Then there are E&P plays like
EOG which are well managed and have a decent balance sheet but are probably not
cheap enough.

So right now I like the oil majors more. I own RDS.A and TOT , the latter is
probably the stronger one. They do pay decent dividends that I consider fairly
safe.

re FR - well the entire market cap of the common (@1.9$)is only 84M$. They
appear to have 2B$ in debt, but that does not include the JV that have about
1.5B$ in debt. Tangible equity is 800M$, but that has not been a reliable
indicator of value for REIT's, since assets values for CRE are falling fast. A
lot of leverage and the debt rollover for the JV's (400M$+) could do this one
in really fast. Preferred is certainly better than common but with so little

Hi Grommit -

I finally got my fill for HRPpD shares today. There were over 80K shares traded
so it appears that some one wanted out. Based on today's close, the yield on
this series preferred is now around 20% again. These shares go into the IRA
account. I may buy some at lower prices for my taxable account for a bounce
trade.

The company recently announced an IPO offering to establish a subsidiary that
contains 29 of their Government leased properties. They plan to sell 51% of
their IPO shares keeping 41% ownership. This should raise $288 million that can
be used to pay down debt and/or supplement reduced cash flows from any
unexpected rent roll reductions.

I think this is a brilliant way for the REIT to establish a source of liquidity
w/o fireside sales of property. If need be, they can sell shares in this
subsidiary to raise additional capital if future refinancing market are
constrained.

HRPT Properties subsidiary to go public
HRPT Properties subsidiary Government Properties Income Trust to go public

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/HRPT-Properties-subsidiary-to-apf-14441158.html

There is a small dilution factor to their common shares with this strategy, so
the company announced their intent to buy back common shares using the money
saved from their recent dividend cut.

I believe the different series of preferred shares are safer now with this new
structure as the company has a liquid source of funds that can be used as a
fall back position if future debt refinancing becomes a problem.

The common shares are selling at 70% below Book Value, so they really can not
raise new capital by selling more common shares. However, based on the over
subscription for this IPO (The Government Properties Income Trust), they should
receive close to BV for these properties. Government tenants are consider the
best renters since they always pay their rent. They will get a premium price
for these "crown jewel" properties even in this sour economic period.

I passed on the LXP preferrds as their common hit a new low today. This company
may be at risk for much lower rent rolls in the future (based on the types of
properties they own http://www.lxp.com/property.php ), They have too much
exposure to retail. Notice the Circuit City and K-Mart properties they own.

LXP -- I am betting that you are too pessimistic on LXP (see below). But who
knows? I bought more LXP-D at 7.3, yielding 25.9%. And I could not resist some
LXP common at 2.32, paying 31%. But I am trying to be disciplined and only add
pref until things clear up. My portfolio is now 60% pref stocks.

CLP:
http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/090305/20090305006155.html?.v=1
CLP-D yielding 21.4% now.
If they pay the common, they have to pay the preferred. It may be in the form
of stock, but "The company intends to continue to declare quarterly
distributions on its common shares..." But their payout ratio on the common is
a bit high. But what do they care if it is stock?

LXP:
Circuit City, which occupies a 288,000 square foot office building, generated
approximately $2.9 million of that NOI has rejected our lease and we expect
that building to be vacant at the end of February. That being said, we
currently do not have any other material delinquencies in the portfolio, and we
are pleased with how well credit quality is holding up in such a severe
economic contraction.

As of year end, we had 18 leases in our consolidated portfolio scheduled to
expire in 2009, and 14 leases scheduled to expire in 201. These amounts
represent 7.7% and 6.9% respectively of our consolidated portfolio GAAP
revenues as of December 31, 2008.

To provide some additional perspective, in 2008 we had 2.9 million square feet
come up for expiration, and in 2009 it will be 2.5 million square feet.

Anthony Paolone – JP Morgan

Natasha, I think you mentioned occupancy for ’09 projected down to about 92%
and I think your year end was 93.3% and you had mentioned Harcourt potentially
going out. I’m just trying to get a sense as to how much speculative leasing do
you need to get done to hit the 92%, given what you know about tenants that are
probably not sticking around?

Natasha Roberts

Harcourt I assume is empty through year end so that’s a vacant building. The
other big one is the Sam’s Real Estate Trust that stays vacant through year
end. Properties that become vacant in 2009 stay vacant.

Anthony Paolone – JP Morgan

And is that all that you have assumed to get to the 92%? I’m just trying to see
if you need to do any other leasing if the expected vacancies get you below 92%
and you need to do some leasing to get it back up to 92%?

Natasha Roberts

No. The expected vacancies get me to 92%. The only assumptions I’m making are
there’s leases where we either have a renewal already or are very close to
having one. The Harcourt is not one of them. The Sam’s Club is not one of them.
Federal Express is not one of them.

Anthony Paolone – JP Morgan

So to dip below that it would have to be something more unexpected occurring.

Natasha Roberts

Exactly.

"...funds from operations per share to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.42 in
2009, and this range does not include items that should be considered
non-recurring, such as lease termination revenue and gains on discharge of
indebtedness.

me: The 2009 dividend is 72 cents on earnings of $1.35+. looks comfortable to
me unless we are in an economic death spiral.

Game Over REITS? S&P Puts Entire Industry On Downgrade Review

S&P just announced it was downgrading Camden Property Trust and First
Industrial, and putting nine other REITs on downgrade review including AIV,
BRE, Capital Automotive, CLP, DDR, HRP, PLD and UDR...

===========================================================

Notice that the headline mentions HRP but in the body of the article they
discuss HPT (Hospitality Properties Trust. There is no mention of HRP.

There was this news on HRP regarding their Hawaii properties.

Bill to curtail commercial rent increases passes
By Associated Press

HONOLULU (AP) — Legislation that would give businesses that lease commercial
property in the Sand Island, Kalihi Kai and Mapunapuna areas some leverage in
rent disputes is moving forward in the House.

The House Judiciary Committee yesterday approved a bill that would mandate
"fair and reasonable" rents when leases are renegotiated. The measure would
require arbitrators to consider past negotiating practices, as well as the use
and characteristics of the land.

More than 180 businesses that lease property in the areas have complained that
HRPT Properties Trust, a Massachusetts firm that is Hawaii's biggest industrial
landowner, has been pushing exorbitant rent hikes.

The measure now goes to the House floor. A companion bill in the Senate is to
be considered Thursday.

Ex-Damon tenants ask Hawaii Legislature to intervene
http://pacific.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2009/03/09/story3.html?ana=e_ph
From the article:"...HRPT has sent letters seeking to raise rents from about $4
per square foot per year to $8 to $10 per square foot a year, with a 4 percent
annual increase, said Michael Steiner, executive director of Citizens for Fair
Valuation, a hui of 22 commercial and industrial Mapunapuna tenants...."

The take away I get from this is that their current rents are solid but
potential increases may be limited by future arbitration. I do not anticipate
any decrease in Hawaii rent rolls which may not be the case for other REIT
properties located on the mainland.

On any new test of the lows for HRPpB, HRPpC or HRPpD, I am going to load up.

EKS, I'm wondering if this downgrade of REITs today marked a bottom, or close
to it. I've been watching several REITs closely since Marty Cohen's Feb 2
Barron's article identified some of his favs that he thought would survive.
Talk about bad timing on his part! Here are the Friday Jan 30 prices in the
Feb.2nd article with today's Mar. 6th closing prices in ():

SPG 44.44 (26.19)
BXP 44.26 (31.73)
AVB 54.68 (42.14)
MAC 15.85 (7.17)
DDR 4.81 (1.52)

Several of these hit a 52-week low today before rallying strongly on very heavy
volume, most notably AVB which touched 38.34 before closing at 42.14 on almost
double avg. volume.

In the article, Cohen said: "I have never seen REITs cheaper than they are
today. The three largest REITs I recommend are SPG, BXP and AVB...all three are
well-capitalized, in the S&P500, extremely well managed, well positioned from a
property standpoint and with a lot of capital so they aren't going to be caught
in a liquidity crunch."

He did identify MAC as in a group with greater financial and operating
leverage, and noted there is no guarantee they will make it through hard times.
DDR he put in the same class.

REITS - cheap by what metric? just because todays prices are much lower than
the prices 2 month ago does not mean that prices are cheap.
Valuation based on NAV
Net asset value? Some brokerages estimate those. Reits nowadays trade at
substantial discounts to those estimates. The problem is that there are no
transactions that can validate those estimates. So we need to think a while
what this means. In reality there is always a buyer for an asset like real
estate, if the price is low enough. the fact that there are no transactions
(which could support NAV) means that the spread between the Bid and Ask is too
high. Why is it high - because the seller and the buyer disagree on the value
of the properties. This is the same situation that happened when the housing
boom ended - transaction volume dried. it is now accelerating (due to
foreclosures) which is a sign of a bottom. the same thing seems to happen with
commercial RE.

Valuation based on FFO.
The problem with that one is that it does not account for leverage. If the REIT
still has cheap financing from old loans than the FFO can be pretty good until
the debt needs to be rolled over. Once the debt get's rolled over the lender
will only borrow up to a certain % of the NAV of the property. That can and
will be a problem for many REIT's. Even in the best case, the cost of capital
will sharply rise which is going to crimp FFO.

EBITDA/EV
The best valuation metric I have found is EBITDA/ EV. EV includes both equity
value and the debt. it is a truly leverage adjusted metric and you will find
that many REIT's you have listed that have cheap shares are heavily indebted
and may even trade at premium to less leveraged REIT's in terms of that metric.
My example for that is CLI and BDN both NE office REITs (similar geography) but
CLI is much less leveraged. Based and EBITDA/EV CLI is cheaper than BDN.

The other thing to consider is that the Enterprise value of an entity like a
REIT is layered. The top layer is the equity layer (value of the common stock),
then comes the preferred, then comes unsecured debt and then comes secured
debt.
if things go bad the equity layer is wiped out first, then comes the preferred,
next unsecured debt and last secured (mortgaged debt). As an equity holder you
need to be aware that everyone else in the soup chain get's to eat first before
it's you turn.

So that's enough for now. I hope you don't mind my preaching. I believe based
on the little I know that many REITs won't make it through this cycle without
wiping the equity layer clean, or at least substantial dilution. I think that
some of the REITs you mentioned are survivors (AVB, BXP and to a lesser extent
SPG) but that does not mean that shareholders will prosper.

As regards NNBR, the decreased estimates and guidance for a loss this Q have

Since you follow REITs so closely, one question - the few where I hold
preferred stock have all organized their debt maturities such that they don't
face anything much until 2011 or 2012. Their cash flow more than covers their
secured and preferred interest obligations; common share dividends are likely
to be paid partly or mostly in stock.

re REITS

 What is the threat to REITs with no major maturities for a couple of years?

1) Tenants vacating existing leases or at least renegotiating lower leases.
2) Falling interest rate coverage triggering covenants on existing unsecured
loans or credit lines
3) Development projects (Partner defaults, off balance sheet liabilities)

Most REITs will get wiped out when NAV of CRE fall by 50% from peak values.
This is not inconveivable since the cap rates were at record low (6% in Y2007).
Way back then in the 90's Cap REITs of 10% were quite common. Right now the
asset values of reasonable financed REITs seem to be be equivalent to Cap rates
of 9-10%, if I believe the brokerage reports. Of course in the 90's, interest
rates were higher but of course the economy was in much better shape.

I think the combination of higher Cap rates and lower rents may be a
substantial headwinds for REITs. Also note that rents are a lagging indicator
and may continue to fall quite some time even though the economy modestly
rebounds.

I do agree that the preferred seem to be a much better bet than the common in
most cases.

re BNI, RR stocks -
why would you look at Earnings/EV? (I assume you look at net earnings). if you
look at this metric you are effectively double counting the interest expense
(interest expense is subtracted when calculating net earnings but the debt
generating the interest expense is included in the EV).

FWIW, even when looking at EV/EBITDA, I agree that BNI does not look terribly
cheap, I attribute that to the WEB factor and his purchases. I do think he got
it right that those RR are franchises and BNI is the best West coast RR (better
than UNP) and NSC is the best East Coast RR (better than CSX). NSC is cheaper
than BNI with respect to the metrics I look at so i go with that one for a
small initial buy.

I don't "mind your preaching"! You raise legitimate issues.
I should have looked around to find the link online so you could review the
article yourself.
http://online.barrons.com/article/SB123335924161735075.html?mod=rss_barrons_int
rview

Your primary question was on what metric is Cohen saying cheap by what metric.
From the full article, it appears that Cohen and Steers does make NAV
estimates:

"...The market has discounted REIT shares to levels that anticipate a drawn-out
period of deteriorating fundamentals. They are trading at steep discounts to
asset values, even using our reduced estimates of value, historically high
dividend yields and low price-to-cash-flow multiples. The single most important
factor affecting a recovery will be the course of the economy. Fortunately, in
this cycle there hasn't been a great deal of overbuilding, which would have
worsened the outlook considerably, as it did in the early 1990s. We expect the
record fiscal and monetary stimulation being put in place worldwide to at least
stem the economy's decline. We should start seeing evidence of this by the end
of 2009, when economic statistics begin to suggest a bottom. REITs tend to be
early-cycle stocks, so they could start to perform well sometime between now
and then. Meantime, it is hard to imagine valuations getting much worse.

So the worst is over?

It is likely things will get a bit worse before they get better. When you are
going through a recession, sentiment is always bad, and things always seem
worst near the bottom. The "it's never coming back" chorus is getting louder.
On the other hand, there has never been more fiscal and monetary stimulus
thrown at the world's economies. Mortgage rates are down. Mortgage refinancing
is up. Spreads are starting to narrow between different grades of securities.
But it is going to take time because the economic and financial crisis is just
too big.

How has all of this affected your business?

Our assets under management have declined considerably. But because of our
strong financial position-no debt and lots of cash-we have seen no reason to
retrench or reduce our commitment to the sector. On the contrary, this is an
extraordinary opportunity to gain market share and to participate in an
industry recovery.

The one fact of life that we need to reconcile is the extreme volatility REIT
shares have experienced. Daily moves of 5% to 10% or more have become routine.
Much of this volatility is due to industry participants using options, ETFs
[exchange-traded funds] and other derivatives -- and in a market that is less
liquid than many other industries. Once confidence is restored, a strong bid
will appear that will dampen downside volatility.

Have you had many redemptions?

There have been modest, if any, redemptions from mutual funds, and almost no
loss of institutional assets. The decline in assets primarily has been the
result of asset depreciation. The client or two that we may have lost was
obligated to fund another commitment or just needed cash.

Has demand finally caught up with supply in the office market?

Supply and demand were in pretty good balance until recently. Vacancy rates in
the New York office market and elsewhere have begun rising at alarming levels.
We don't have the major overbuilding that occurred in other cycles, which is
positive. You won't see new construction for a long while because builders
can't get financing. And in this economy, even if they could get it, landlords
wouldn't be able to get the rents to justify new space. If there is vacant
space that can be leased at $80 a square foot, why would you build a building
where you need $120 to break even? Existing owners are operating under a "rent
umbrella," or a gap between market rents and required rents on new buildings.
You won't see construction for several years...."

Basically, his premise is that retail and commercial REITs now are discounting
very high default levels. There is no new building of either commercial or
residential real estate, unlike previous downturns characterized by
overbuilding. His recommendations are for companies he reckons are
well-capitalized and will be able to continue paying the divvies. But then...he
does anticipate everything turning on the economy.

Gotta go. Read the full article, linked above.

Hi Paul -

The way I see these REITs is that if you can come out with one or more of the
survivors, these assets should do quite well in an inflationary environment.
With the huge amounts of debt the US is accumulating, I expect significant
inflation and much higher interest rates five years out. Owning real property
should be one way to hedge this long term risk of high inflation.

I currently have a small exposure to REITs in my portfolio but I am thinking of
building up a sizable position as I believe the current valuations are very
attractive. This is a once in a decade type trade so I am trying to develop an
appropriate trading, hedging and exit strategy if things go very sour.

First, I have tried to identify the best of breed and plan to buy a basket of
only preferred series issues.

Second, I plan to carry a trading position that I will sell with any 30% pop
and take the short term gain. I have a lot of carryover short term losses that
I need to offset with short term gains. Typically I never enter a trade to sell
short term, but this is a Bear Market and I do not like round trip trades.

Third, to hedge the position w/o selling the preferred equity, I will look at
shorting the common if (1) the common dividend is omitted or (2) if dividends
are paid in stock rather than cash. You can also buy Puts on the common to
protect the downside. There is very little option activity on these REITs so by
watching the volume and open interest a red flag should be raised if this
activity picks up.

A lot of the metrics have already been discussed. The one that catches my eye
is Book Value. Many are selling at a significant discount to Book Value (some
at 20% of BV). The key for their survival is maintaining current rent rolls
with limited new tenant vacancies.

Most of the preferred defaults arise out of the company declaring BK. Some
companies have different types of work outs plans. For example, Thornburg
Mortgage forced their preferred shareholders to take $5.00 per preferred share
(when par was $25.00) plus three shares of common (selling for pennies).
Therefore you want to try to avoid such a land mine.

I believe there is significantly value in REITs now but higher than normal risk
for REIT defaults and/or BK's. As an investor, I have evaluated both my exit
strategy and hedging options more closely especially for these REIT
investments.

Thank you for posting the Barron's article. It seems to verify my view of the
risks and value that REITs currently offer.

Excerpt from P8:
>i> If you had an extra $100, what would you buy: REIT equities, REIT
preferred,REIT debt, or would you hide it under the mattress? 

Lastly, about half (52%) would buy REIT debt if they had an extra $100, which
was the most popular answer among management, long-only, and hedge funds. About
14% would buy equities and about 14% would buy preferred, although ~21% would
stay away from investing in REITs altogether and put it under the mattress.
Interestingly, not a single hedge fund voted that it would buy equities at this

Hi Spekulatius

That's a very detailed and comprehensive report that Citigroup put out on
REITs. Do you know how the small individual investor can buy REIT debt directly
? This would be much safer than buying either the preferred or common shares.

Many of the preferred series are priced between $0.25 (ie LXP) to $0.35 (ie
HRP) on the dollar (based on their original issue price). That signals to me
that at the lower end they are priced for a default and at the higher end they
are definitely priced as "junk" and carry a lot of risk.

It will be interesting to watch how these get priced in 6-18 months.

I found it very interesting how some of the CDS spreads are priced for GE and
Berkshire Hathaway. On Fast Money they pointed out how the market is pricing
the risk component for these two blue chip companies.

http://www.cnbc.com/id/29550506

From the article:"...Consider this: Berkshire Hathaway [BRKA 0.018 -0.004
(-18.18%) ] credit default swaps are now trading wider than Vietnam, according
to Bank of America/Merrill strategist Michael Hartnett. Meaning that Berkshire
bondholders need to pay more to protect themselves against default than those
holding sovereign debt issued by Vietnam. Hartnett holds this up as just one
example of the extremes he's seeing in the credit markets. He also shows that
GE [GE 7.06 0.40 (+6.01%) ] CDS are trading wider than Russia...."

We are living in very interesting times.

Any investor who thinks BRKA or BRK.A closed at $.018 per share down $.004 or

Hi Madharry - The Government must regulate every business so there are
appropriate capital reserves to meet the worst case of default and reporting
controls are put in place so the regulating agency knows that the bare minimums
are being met. No back office deals get done that pose substantial risk w/o
prior approval by the regulating agency. If you do deals w/o regulatory
oversight, they are void and you go to jail.

I am not sure how you implement such oversight but if such was in place, the
regulator would be in a better position to let these companies fail or perhaps
be absorb by a larger company in the same industry.

The potential for such gross systemic risk to our country is the equivalent to
fighting a war and losing. We can not let any one company bring this nation
down to it's knees.

It's too late for AIG and many of these big banks, so I suspect our Government
is doing the best they can given the current conditions.

After reading that report, it's quite scary. I am not sure how the end game is
going to play out.

Hi Grommit - In your earlier posts on REITs, you listed CBL & Associates
Properties Inc. (CBL) as one you followed. You liked their price/FFO metric and
based on their recent Feb 2009 earnings they still generate decent FFO and have
been quite successful refinancing their LT debt.

Since your posting their preferred series have dropped in value (from
$8.00/share to $5.50/share) and now yield over 32%. The common shares were up
over 40% today to $3.00/share on 2x the avg volume.

The common shares goes x-dividend Friday March 13, 2009 and the preferred
series goes x dividend Monday March 16, 2009. The company stated that to
conserve cash, the common dividend will be paid 40% cash and 60% as a stock
dividend, Preferreds will be paid in all cash.

Both the common stock and preferred series hit an all time low this week, I
think there might be a good short term trade (w/ one dividend capture)
available.

The George Soros Fund started a a new position sometime around Dec 31, 2008
according to their SEC filing. Management currently owns 20% of the common.

Do you still watch CBL? I am not too excited about the Mall sector but
management has seemed to produce good YOY results in a very tough environment.
Their forward looking forecast is not too optimistic but manageable still
resulting in positive FFO.

Any opinion on this one specifically with the preferred series as the
investment?

My point is we should have allowed aig to fail and go bankrupt. when you are a
mom and pop shop and you offer credit you take the risk the customer wont pay.
my in laws had a small business selling advertising and my mother in laws job
was to sue the customers who didnt pay and it was a full time job. if she
couldnt collect from the company, she couldnt get reimbursed from the govrnment
except by writing off the debt. that we have failures and bankruptcies and
small businesses are usually careful about selling so much to one customer that
if they dont pay they go belly up too. People who trusted aig credit have to
take the consequences. if they extended too much credit to aig too bad. there
is no reason for the govt to bail out stupid decisions or to make hedge funds
risk who took the opposite side of these transaction . Im impressed that the
weasel collected $280million and taxpayers are shelling out $300 billion to
cover his losing bets and he keeps what he collected. Thats like me going to
the roulette wheel doubling up evertime i lose and keeping my winnings. when i
finally i have a terrible run and owe billions of dollars to the casino i walk
away and let the the government pay the tab. Not only should the weasel be
investigate but his bosses too and whatever regulators were supposed too look
at these profits.

I remember when i worked for a moneycenter bank, we had a branch in norway that
was pretty much break even. one year they reported a huge profit, and that
quickly generated an audit. It turned out that their trading unit decided that
norweigan bonds were a great opportunity so they bought some and the bonds
appreciate greatly because of a decline in interest rates and appreciation
against the US dollar. the audit unit made a big deal over whether they had the
authority to engage in such a transaction as they were concerned about the
volatility. I guess AIG auditing had no such concerns nor did the regulators.
after all we all know that real estate prices only go up and never down.

Im now convinced that most of our elected and appointed officials should be
replaced by successful small business people. as a nation we would be much much
better off.

http://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=4143&mn=122639&pt=msg&mid=6844434

OT: The banking crisis in laymans terms

Heidi is the proprietor of a bar in Berlin. In order to increase sales, she
decides to allow Alan, John, Wilhelm, Raphael, Romulo, Humberto, Manuel, Jesus,
Lisandro, Yosef, Gertrude, Hilda and other loyal customers - most of whom are
unemployed alcoholics - to drink now but pay later. She keeps track of the
drinks consumed on a ledger (thereby granting the customers loans).

Word gets around and as a result increasing numbers of customers flood into
Heidi's bar. Taking advantage of her customers' freedom from immediate payment
constraints, Heidi increases her prices for wine and beer, the most-consumed
beverages. Her sales volume increases massively.

Herrald, a young and dynamic customer service consultant at the local bank
recognizes these customer debts as valuable future assets and increases Heidi's
borrowing limit.

He sees no reason for undue concern since he has the debts of the alcoholics as
collateral.

At the bank's corporate headquarters, expert bankers transform these customer
assets by packaging them into DRINKBONDS, ALKBONDS and PUKEBONDS. These
securities are then traded on markets worldwide. No one really understands what
these abbreviations mean and how the securities are guaranteed. Nevertheless,
as their prices continuously climb, the securities become top-selling items.

One day, although the prices are still climbing, Michael, a risk manager of the
bank (subsequently fired due his negativity) decides that the time has come to
demand payment of the debts incurred by Heidi and the drinkers at Heidi's bar
and starts calling the loans.

However they cannot pay back the debts. Heidi cannot fulfill her loan
obligations and claims bankruptcy.

DRINKBOND and ALKBOND drop in price by 95 %. PUKEBOND performs better,
stabilizing in price after dropping by 80 %.

The suppliers of Heidi's bar, having granted her generous payment due dates and
having invested in the securities are faced with a new situation. Her wine
supplier claims bankruptcy, her beer supplier is taken over by a competitor.

The bank is saved by the Government following dramatic round-the-clock
consultations by leaders from the governing political parties.

The funds required for this purpose are obtained by a tax levied on the
non-drinkers.

XOM and the oils had become overweight in the portfolio....because of XOM's
relative outperformance and some severely underperforming stocks, some with
barely a pulse.

 My point is we should have allowed aig to fail and go bankrupt. when you are a
mom and pop shop and you offer credit you take the risk the customer wont pay. 

The issue is slightly different with AIG. The were selling insurance. If you
have a fire you expect your fire insurance to cover your loss up to the terms
of the policy, no? AIG was selling insurance (after all, that's all a CDS is).

Assume I'm a responsible investor. In better days I bought Lehman bonds. As
things started going down hill for Lehman I decide to buy insurance in the form
of a CDS and AIG was offering the most attractive rates. I'm being responsible
by doing so, no? Now Lehman is taken out and shot and as a result my insurance
company (AIG) can't pay.

Going back to the fire analogy... If it's just me, too bad. But what if the
fire was something like the storms that recently hit SE Australia and everyone
used the same insurance company which now can't pay off the claims? Should the
government step in and help? If so, who should they help? The insurance
company?

I don't know the answer. The powers that be decided to step in this time.
Perhaps they were right, perhaps wrong. I'm just saying it's not as simple as
"he screwed up, he should pay the price". My belief is that AIG should pay the
price but those who depended upon them, not so much.

JSB, yes, mostly purchase recently, but I'm selling a few stocks too. Mostly
they are "I give up"s.

My sales could be used as a contra-indicator --- maybe a good entry point for
someone else to start in.

Some are: ABK, TLAB, BBY, CNTY, CENT. (I may reenter BBY & CENT if they drop
back.)

Some trims: FR, PCZ, CENT, BIG

Also sales of some - plenty - where I'm too ashamed, almost, to report that I
have owned these turkeys and have lost money and self-respect with them.

For me, WYE is worth more without PFE merger than it is with merger. So you are
thinking that merger failing is bad, I think that it would be very good. I'd be
very happy if merger fell through and I could hold WYE for long term.

Interesting picks AINV, TKR, and NNBR. I thought AINV was making a potential
bottom a while ago in Feb, got a bad feeling on it, so I ditched it as I
chickened before damage was done.

The only thing I have had any success with has been shorts and puts, among them
AGP, WLP, APOL, CI, CYH, CDR, WYNN. Despite some positive signs for the market
just 2 days hasn't yet totally convinced me that this current rally will get
much farther than to a point where people become believers again. A load of
pundits, newsletter writers, and media now have called the bottom. That's a
little scary. May be good for a decent push up, but maybe not as the market
will get short term overbought again. I'm hopeful, but still a bit hesitant to
go whole hog. If it's the real deal on this rally, there will be plenty of time
and jumping the gun to catch the knife is not my speed. I want to have more
confidence in the sustainability of the market move.

I bought some puts on PCLN the other day. It got some help today. Looks
overvalued to me. But everything seems market and index dependent still, more
so than individual fundamentals.

This is a wild one but numbers don't lie when it comes to valuation unless they
are phony and the stock is worth considerably less.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=PCLN

CSTR is another I recently took a flier on with some downside possibilities.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=cstr

Amazing how mixed the market is with undervaluation and overvaluation running
side by side.

This all likely has little to do with value investing, but so far fighting a
down market on a treadmill to oblivion hasn't worked either. Just my thoughts
on the big guessing game.

The Co. has a ton of portfolio Companies, and mainly they hold subordinated
debt. I haven't done a full review of these companies, yet its had not to
imagine at least some of them on implode-ometer watch. Any time a balance sheet
lumps together Long Term Investments, the value of those investments becomes
suspect. In addition, categories like "Other Equity" without full intelligible
disclosure scares me.

I think the Government contemplating getting rid of mark to market rules is
nothing more than encouragement for Companies to lie about the value of their
assets. They are worth what they are worth, not what they were worth at the
market peak and even then, they were carried at extrapolated values that did
not reflect realities. Another Government attempt at propping the market.

I think first of all that we need to distinguish between the aig insurance
subsidiaries and corporate aig. entities buying credit insurance from aig
corporate is not the same as individuals buying insurance policies from aig
insurance subsidiaries. if i invest in a company and the company goes bellyup
unfortunately the government doesnt come in and remiburse me for my losses. i
took a chance. thats [p[iwhat happens with credit insurance. it never said this
credit insurance is guaranteed by the us government and for good reason.

I would also like an explanation for why the fed thinks cutting bank dividends
to shareholders, many of whom are on fixed incomes and US taxpayers, is a good
thing, while at the same time its OK to lend billions of dollars to foreign
entities and this is supposed to help the US economy? I heard that Citibank
lent Dubai 8 billion dollars. I hope if there are any members of congress
reading this someone could answer this question.
I think Obama needs to replace bernake and geithner and mr. K sooner rather

I haven't been buying anything on the long side in a while. Up until Tuesday,
the trend of most stocks has been down, and 80% of stocks follow the market.
20% odds at picking those that can defy a clear downtrend is not very good
odds. My approach to buying value stocks includes having market dynamics in my
favor. I'm ready, but the market has not yet shown that it is ready.

Since putting my value watch list together 47 stocks in the list have advanced
and 430 have declined.

If you have a fire you expect your fire insurance to cover your loss up to the
terms of the policy, no?

And if you had 10 fire insurance policies would you expect all to pay off?
Ain't gonna happen.

And if 10 other unrelated unknown people had fire insurance policies on your
property, would you expect insurance to pay them too? Ain't gonna happen.

Do you think that if your doctor took out 5 health insurance policies on you
that your doctor would get payed 5 times? Or at all?

How long do you think your property would remain healthy if somebody with no
interest in your property 'insured' it 10 times over and insurance company was
required to pay off on the 'loss', especially when the 'loss' required no
physical, objectively verifiable event?

That's why insurance companies have concepts like 'insurable interest' and
prevent profiting from insurance payouts.

Cheap Preferred Shares Lure Speculators After Losses (Update2)
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601213&sid=a.CREb95P8gQ&refer=home

From the article:"...Record declines in preferred shares are enticing
speculators, who say the securities are so cheap they will turn a profit even
if company default rates exceed those of the Great Depression.

Perpetual preferred stocks, whose fixed dividends mean they trade like bonds,
have lost 43 percent this year, compared with the 20 percent drop in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since Dec. 31, data compiled by Merrill Lynch & Co.
and Bloomberg show. Since March 9, an exchange-traded fund that mimics a basket
of preferred shares issued by banks rallied 28 percent, poised for the biggest
weekly advance since its creation in December 2006...."

DPDW (attn. Lazarus!). I couldn't get to Las Vegas last month, so I'll make my
casino bet here and now. I've upped my small position by a whopping 4000 more
shares. -g-

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DPDW.OB

I bet DPDW makes it and I can recover my earlier losses on this one.

(Aside: Although...when I'm gambling in Vegas I don't add to losing bets. I
wonder if maybe I should learn from that as regards my stock market buys. -g-)

My last Buy for DPDW was at $0.15/share in December 2008. As long as PBR keeps
spending money developing their off shore wells, Deep Down should continue to
get the support services contracts. PBR traded to a new recovery high today
just above $30/share. The only oil company in my group to see a new recovery
high since the October 2008 dump.

I believe a lot of the Brazil stocks have bottomed. However there are many
other U.S. stocks that are priced at fire sale values that IMO are better buys
now.

I am not too sure how long this relief rally will last but I am going to be
quick on my trigger finger to book my s/t gains.

The risk/reward for DPDW is quite good. My target is $1.25/share - $1.50/share
but I will probably be out at $0.50/share. If so, I will use the proceeds to
take a trip to Vegas.

WH - i am going to buy some too. My limit order missed by a few cents today.

Here is another one for you: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KALU Kaiser aluminum.
They fabricate aluminum and just wrote off their last stake in a primary
aluminum plant in Wales, so they are less dependent on bulk Al prices than AA
for example. KALU has specialized in some qualities that find use in the
Aircraft industry. There is very little debt and they trade at 1/2 tangible
book. they are supposed to do 2$/share this year. I am not sure that is
realistic but I do see them coming out of this downturn in decent shape.

What do you think about VLO? They are the biggest refiner in the US and at
least amongst the independent one, they are in the best shape. Earnings are
supposed to be 3$/share with the stock at 17$. Margins are actually up compared
to late last year. VLO also trades at 60% of tangible book.

Right now, I still like PIY yielding 18-19% at low 11's or lower. I expect them
to declare a 1.05 April 1 dividend within a week. No debt due for a couple
years. Company's common stock (FTR) just declared they won't be cutting the
common dividend. Telecom company --- lots of debt and business could be
