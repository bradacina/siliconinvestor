AMGN. I've not had any success with any of my forays into AMGN. I've held some
shares since 2005, and have also traded the stock sometimes.

AMGN seems to me to be one of those stocks that cycles, and money could be and
has been made playing that. Unfortunately AMGN seems to be a sine when I'm a
cosine or vise versa, and I've never been able to capitalize on AMGN's pattern.
That makes me reluctant to try once again.

I am seeing more earnings misses - GME for example got whacked pretty good as

that some deserve it and some don't (the world itself didn't come to an end but

Hi Mc Sweet -
When I checked Yahoo Finance, it looks as those stocks listed in the article
have a Book Value less than 70%.

Be careful with BV as a price of an asset can be significantly different based
on what they paid, what the current market value is or the price the company
carries it on their books. I have found it to be a good start in valuing a
company. Sometimes you can find hidden assets that may have a much higher value
in today's market than when they were originally purchased by the company.

NCZ,

I know some smart people own this one, but when there are usually a host of
closed-end funds trading at nice discounts, I can't myself view a closed-end
fund trading at a premium as a Value, particularly now after there has been
such a huge rally in the underlying asset class.

I am not saying this investment will do poorly, just that it is not a Value in
my book. Also, be careful when rates rise, as this will jack up the borrowing
costs for the fund, which is leveraged.

RE; GOV

My GTC order for GOV got filled today which increased my position by 60%. The
original IPO for GOV was at $20/share (6/2009) and was over subscribed. They
announced 6.5 million shares as the new offering (12/31/2009). Somebody on
Yahoo stated that they plan to increase the secondary by 10% up above 7 mil, so
it appears it is over subscribed too.

They have acquired $89 million of new properties and assumed $24 million new
debt. 100% are leased and have long lease tenants.

The final announcement of the secondary issue price should be announced later
this week.

I was lucky to get my fill in at the low ($22.21/share) and want to pick up

GOV,

Basically all IPOs are oversubscribed. IMO, the initial GOV IPO was a flop,
since it immediately traded down at least a point from the IPO price, even
though now it is above the IPO price.

You can sometimes execute a great buy going into the offering, but generally I
think buying after the offering is complete gives the best chance for a great
price, since the deals are usually priced at a discount to the market, and
sometimes they break down, such that you can buy at a discount to the deal
price.

That being said, if it is a really "hot" deal then buying before the pricing is
a good thing, since the stock can rally tremendously after the pricing. I don't
claim to be an expert, but I don't know why this one would be so hot.

Hi Wallace -

HRPT Properties Trust (HRP) originally owned the properties and still maintains
an ownership interest (around 50%) so you can look at some of their filings for
the GOV IPO and the properties that were transferred to GOV from HRP.

I would rather own GOV than HRP (I own HRP preferred shares and a few shares of
the common). The common shares of HRP that I sold (as well as some proceeds
from my Vanguard GNMA fund), I am replacing with GOV shares. I believe the
dividend is solid and even could be increased. The bull case for me is that the
rental income could increase if inflation starts to move higher otherwise the
7% dividend is much higher than what I am currently receiving in my Vanguard
GNMA fund (about 4%).

I am using the position as a hedge against inflation since you own actual real
estate with excellent tenants ( government municipalities). The properties
being purchased now are at depressed values and once the cycle turns in 36-48
months, its possible they could be 20%-30% higher. The upside for the stock is
no more than $30.00/share-$35.00/share and will probably be driven to these
values once GOV can show higher rents (once the lease renewal cycle occurs in
24 months) and they start distributing higher dividends.

My overall position is quite small compared to my GNMA holdings. GOV is NOT a
GNMA equivalent but I am willing to take more risk for the higher dividend
yield. I do know as the FED increase interest rates my GNMA share price will
fall. I have a 9% capital gain in my GNMA fund and plan on peeling off 10% of
my shares which will find a home in GOV.

GOV. Each stock discussed here should stand on its own merits. If it's a fit
for the reader, then the reader might buy or consider buying. If not, something
else, maybe of a different sort entirely, will be mentioned later, that could
be considered.

That said, some guys here seem to have a pretty good history for picking value
stocks that move up. (Jmo. From what I believe I can discern.) So sometimes it
pays to consider the jockey as well as the horse. My opinion is this: When
grommit speaks, listen. When EKS speaks, also.
=============================
With dink companies, I can buy a few hundred or more shares, and if they do
well, the percentage gains can be substantial, and the small dollar amounts can
add to increase the portfolios' value. And if one or a few of these stocks
crash, it's no big deal. (So I tell myself, although I know I will at least
moan and curse. -g-. Maybe cry.) With something like GOV, to make it pay, imo,
if someone has a diversified and sizable portfolio (however "sizable" is
defined), to make any money on GOV, the position has to be fairly large -
larger that is than the $ amount held with a dink company. (Although, perhaps
with GOV's recent birth and its relatively small size, it itself could be
characterized as a dink company.) With GOV, I am ASSUMING I am dealing with a
conservative reit where the yields perhaps might very well outshine any capital
appreciation of the shares. If I'm wrong and the stock craters or even declines
and stays there, I am going to get hurt, since I am weighting this position
more than many of my other stocks.
(My weighting doesn't mean I'm any more knowledgeable or confident about GOV
than I am about any other of my holdings though.)

GOV does not have it's own management it's contracted out just like HRP's, as I
understand it. the asset manager get's paid a percentage of assets, so i would
expect that they grow assets in order to generate more fees, whether that is
beneficial for shareholders or not. That is how it worked out with HRP at
least. That said the same management never screwed up badly either and
overleveraged the REITs it has been managing. one thing is for sure, I would
not bet on much share appreciation with GOV just the way their management
company is incentivised.

They are even offering a premium for their Notes. The preferred series benefit
since the senior debt is being paid down therefore less future risk of default.
I suspect the company is working towards refinancing their overall debt, maybe
even working towards a secondary offering of the common.

I continue to hold my FRpK & FRpJ shares. They are yielding 10.1% at current
prices which reflects a slightly higher risk premium than other REIT preferred
shares (ie HRPpB yields 8.75%). This is well below the yields offered in

Some analysis:

HRPT launches IPO for new REIT to invest in regional properties leased to
government tenants 
http://baltimorerealestate.citybizlist.com/yourcitybiznews/detail.aspx?id=48390

From the article:"...INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS

Strong Credit Quality Tenants.
Approximately 89% of Government Properties Income Trust pro forma rental income
for the twelve months ended March 31, 2009 was paid by the U.S. Government.

An additional 6% of pro forma rental income in these twelve months was paid by
the States of California, Maryland, Minnesota and South Carolina.

Government Properties Income Trust's future investments will be focused on
properties that are majority leased to government tenants, the belief being
that government tenants generally have strong credit characteristics and are
less likely to default under lease obligations than commercial tenants.
Accordingly, for investors, expected distributions may be more secure than the
distributions paid by many other REITs...."

"...Favorable Lease Renewal Experience.
Based on RMR's experience, properties leased to government tenants are
typically relet to the same tenant or another government tenant. During the
period that RMR has managed the 29 properties that comprise Government
Properties Income Trust's initial portfolio, all of the government leased
properties that have been relet were relet to a government tenant...."

"...Growth Potential.
During the past 40 years, the amount of GSA owned space has remained relatively
constant, but the amount of GSA leased space has increased from 46 million
square feet to 178 million square feet. Due to the large amount of space
currently leased to government tenants, and the belief that government demand
for leased office space will increase, Government Properties Income Trust will
have significant opportunities to acquire additional properties that are
majority leased to government tenants...."

IPO Overview: Government Properties Income Trust
http://seekingalpha.com/article/140602-ipo-overview-government-properties-incom
-trust

================================================================

My take was a bit different in that since HRP still owns 49% of the GOV shares,
HRP has a vested interest in seeing good overall performance in GOV. HRP
management still receive a lot of their compensation in stock options, so they
have a vested interest in seeing the common shares perform well.

I would like to see the vesting of their options be modified so that they are
fully valued when exercised at higher values and are held for a longer period
of time. This way management maintains a long term perspective when making
their property buy & sell decisions.

FR is playing a game. On one hand, they want to persuade the debt holders to
tender early and cheap(ish), so they are making things sound bad by mentioning
pref divvie suspension. On another hand, if they cannot persuade debt holders
that things are bad and they don't get debt tendered, they MAY be forced to
suspend the prefs. My guess would be that they get partial tender and they
continue to pay prefs, but it might be smart to reevaluate (oversized) FR pref
positions.

If they suspend and prefs tank, it might be a great opportunity to load more.
Have to be nimble, prepared and up-to-date with their latest financials to make
decision as this unfolds. :)

Good luck.

re Bank fee's. Interesting development that has received amazingly little
attention. Charged over 10 years that would 12B$/year. I am hearing only
institutions larger than 50B$ will be charged and the fee will depend on assets
(maybe wholesale lending). Not a bad idea if you make it repressively more
expensive to become bigger. This could help solve the "too big to fail
problem".

Obama to propose bank fees to recoup bailout funds
WASHINGTON (Reuters) – President Barack Obama on Thursday will propose major
U.S. financial firms pay a fee to protect taxpayers from up to $117 billion in
losses on a bank bailout that has spurred fury at Wall Street excess.

GOV,

Hear me now and listen to me later. As I said earlier, you usually want to buy
these deals going into the pricing. Unless there is a great story (or huge
amount of short interest), the underwriters have to take the stock price down
to drum up enough demand for people to buy.

If you think the deal will hold up well, you might buy some here in the
22.20s/30s, otherwise look to buy some tomorrow morning, where you could get an
even cheaper price.

I would expect the deal to price at a slight discount to last sale of today. I
don't know whether it will trade up or break down from the deal price.

That said, my comfort level with the reports from any and all of these Chinese

when trust assumptions are low and bets are made nevertheless.
It's quite another, and more financially painful, imo, to have believed in USA

If you are an aggressive entity like a hedge fund or brokerage (Goldman Sachs

at $21.50 and you know how many shares you will be allocated, you can short the
beejeebers out of the stock until it goes down to $21.50, wait, and then cover
with the $21.50 shares you will get. This would seem to be a safe way for a

I'm suspicious: To my mind, my explanation fits the facts (of the stock
dropping). "These guys" all seem in cahoots. The current wide-spread insider
trading scandal (Galleon Group and company insiders) reinforces.

"A" might not be able to short in anticipation of receiving shares, but friend
entity/person "B" with a sub rosa deal to take the stock from "A" at a small
profit to "A", might be able to have legally shorted the stock. I don't know
what deals are legal, what are binding, what is actually being done. ("A" might
have to agree from the underwriters to hold the received stock stock for a
minimum time period. If or how that's enforced, I don't know.)

Not that these people are the total picture of course. Lots of people will be
selling for a number of reasons. Some people won't like that they are being
diluted; some will see the stock dropping and decide it's not worth being in;
and so on.

Here's how it's affected me though: I'm buying more GOV today, but -- presuming
the stock will be dropping to $21.50 -- am keeping monies in reserve to see if
I can pick up more shares a bit closer to $21.50. Not saying the stock will get
there. (Or bottom there: in today's market (DOW off over 100), stock might

RE - GOV Prospectus for secondary offer 8.5 Million shares

Here is the prospectus for the offer:
http://xml.10kwizard.com/filing_raw.php?repo=tenk&ipage=6698525

From the filing:"... Recent Developments

Investment Activity

Since the completion of our IPO on June 8, 2009, we have acquired four
properties and have entered into binding purchase and sale agreements to
acquire two additional properties. These properties are majority leased to
government tenants and have an aggregate purchase price of approximately $161.7
million, including the assumption of $35.3 million of mortgage debt associated
with the properties that we expect to acquire during the first quarter of 2010.
These six properties include 1,086,240 rentable square feet and are 99.7%
occupied with a weighted average remaining lease term (based on rentable square
feet) of approximately 7.2 years.

•
In August 2009, we acquired an industrial property in Nashua, New Hampshire
with 321,800 rentable square feet, which is 100% leased to the United States
Postal Service, or USPS, for $18.2 million.

•
In December 2009, we acquired an office property in Sacramento, California with
163,425 rentable square feet, which is approximately 62% leased to the State of
California and occupied by the California Department of Finance, for $40.0
million.

•
In December 2009, we acquired a second office property in Sacramento,
California with 110,500 rentable square feet, which is 100% leased to the State
of California and occupied by the California National Guard, for $15.1 million.

•
In December 2009, we acquired an office property in Arlington Heights, Illinois
with 57,770 rentable square feet, which is 100% leased to the U.S. Government
and occupied by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, or OSHA, for
$16.0 million.

•
In November 2009, we entered into a binding purchase and sale agreement to
acquire an office and warehouse building in Landover, Maryland with 266,000
rentable square feet, which is 100% leased to the U.S. Government and occupied
by the Defense Intelligence Agency, with a purchase price of $43.7 million.
This property is encumbered by a mortgage for $24.8 million that is currently
not prepayable. We have completed our acquisition diligence for this property
and expect to assume this mortgage and acquire this property during the first
quarter of 2010; however, no assurance can be given that this acquisition will
be consummated in that time period or at all.

•
In December 2009, we entered into a binding purchase and sale agreement to
acquire an office property in Lakewood, Colorado with 166,745 rentable square
feet, which is 100% leased to the U.S. Government and occupied by the National
Park Service, with a purchase price of $28.7 million. This property is
encumbered by a mortgage for $10.5 million that is currently not prepayable. We
have completed our acquisition diligence for this property and expect to assume
this mortgage and acquire this property during the first quarter of 2010;
however, no assurance can be given that this acquisition will be consummated in
that time period or at all.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, we are required to expense all of the
costs associated with acquiring properties. Prior to the first quarter 2009,
these expenses were capitalized into the cost of acquired properties. As a
result of our acquisition activity, we expect to incur approximately $818,000
in expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009. Given the timing of recent and
pending acquisitions, we will record minimal revenues in the fourth quarter of
2009 for recent acquisitions we acquired in December 2009, and we will not
record any revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 for our pending
acquisitions...."
=======================================================================

I like the company and I like the properties but I am not sure on the overall
dilution from the additional 8.5 million shares and if this secondary is going
to be accretive to per share earnings after adjusting for the new share count
ind increased Pro Forma income.

Total assets (From pg 12)

Total assets
Before offering: $ 508,331 million
After offering: $ 635,966 million

Total Debt:
Before offering: $63.4 million
After offering: $36.9 million
(Note: company using proceeds of offering to pay down $26.5 million debt)
Total Assets After debt reduction ($26.5 million from offering) = ($635,966 +
26,500) = $662,466

Net Increase in Assets After offering (& debt reduction) $154.2 million (4.3%)

Shares outstanding Before: 21.5 million
Shares outstanding After: 30.0 million (28% increase)

Net Income Before: $27.45 M
Net Income After estimated Pro Forma: $31.92 (14% increase)
(Note I estimated based on the 9 month Pro Forma vs Actual on Pg 11)

Based on the pro forma, net income After the offering is estimated to increase
by 14% (pg 11; $27.45M vs $31.92 M) while the share count increases 28%.

This translates to an adjusted payout of $1.31/share annual or about a 6% yield
at the offer price of $21.50/share.

Therefore, I am not too compelled to add shares even at $21.50/share until
there is a better history of the annual dividend payout. If the market was to
price the stock as BEFORE the offering, the stock should trade down to
$18.80/share to reflect a 7% yield.

I will keep the few share I have and if the stock trades down to the $18 - $19
range, I will begin adding shares again.

(NOTE: These are "back of the envelope" calculations and I may be wrong (have
been wrong in the past). No rush to buy as there are many, many opportunities
in the investment ocean.)

I'll have to consider.

An adjusted payout of $1.31 would mean about .33/sh quarterly. As mentioned,
the distribution history is weak. Two payments, one of .50 and the next of .40.
We would be continuing in the wrong direction with .33.

Based on numbers I see, I calculate stated bv after share issuance to be
$19.96/sh. That's a drop from my number of $20.70 before share issuance.

Something not right. Seems like stockholders might be getting hurt two ways.
Why buy fully-leased buildings if there's no value to be added, and in fact,
it's detrimental to stockholders, the presumed owners of GOV? I hope, almost
expect, that this calculation of adjusted payout = $1.31 is not correct or not
the entire dollar amount that the reit will distribute annually.

Sold half my JNJ position. The company keeps increasing its dividend (although
it's only 3% now), keeps growing (bv, etc.) has great returns on equity, and is
owned by Mr. Buffett.

My current shares I show were first purchased in early '06 at $57-58 area.
Stock now $65. For such an apparently great company, this stock really hasn't
performed so well in past four years. (For me. Although disappointing small
gains over four years are better than losses in other companies' stocks of
which I have many over those years.)

I suspect that if earnings/growth continues, the stock will eventually move
much higher. I also suspect that with JNJ now having apparently botched a
"smelly" drug problem and with its additional problem of gov't accusations of
bribery, that the stock, now at a new 12-mo. high, might be stymied for a
while. If the stock cycles, I could yet again see an opportunity to reenter,
maybe back at my '06 prices or lower ('09 prices).
I'll take that chance with a sell of 1/2 my position. And meanwhile try to use
funds raised for more aggressive capital gains and dividend yields elsewhere.

Hi Paul - I am looking at doing the same thing with my LLY. I closed my UNH
holdings in the IRA this morning. The rally in the health care and drug stocks
is due to the special election in Massachusetts going to the republican which
might impact the outcome of current health care reform bill. I think the market
is over reacting and the long term value proposition for a lot of these
companies has not really changed from Friday's close.

I sold all of my JnJ earlier this month after coming to the same conclusion you
did with regards to many of the "growth" and regulatory challenges they have
(LLY probably more so). We will probably have a a chance to re-enter these
stocks at lower prices in the future. The price action looks like a blow off
(especially after the triple witching option activity last Friday) rather than
a breaking to new highs.

Therefore, I am going to error on booking a profit now on some of these
marginal health care issues that are in the portfolio.

=================================================================

I do like the action today on WMB (up 8%) with their strategic restructuring
announcement to create a giant NG partnership. Along with the recent XOM merger
w/ XTO Energy, this confirms to me that the industry is experiencing a major
transition to much higher usage in NG in the future. I will continue to explore
the value opportunities in this sector as there appears to be many still
available.

One that is showing up these days as a reasonable speculation is O'Charley's

indicators I am using show crossovers recently and I don't see them losing
$2.00 a share in stockholder equity which represents the current discount.

GOV,

Probably, no one cares, but I think any easy money to be made from playing the
GOV offering has been made. Thus, I have taken off trading positions on the
stock.

I am typically a much longer term investor, but if I see tradable market
patterns to exploit, I will step in.

By the way, I think it is very unlikely that management did an offering that
will dilute earnings. They won't stay in management very long if they do things
like that. That is, unless they are trying to keep the company solvent, which
doesn't seem to be an issue here.

That being said, I am agnostic on the stock here on out. I haven't been
studying it closely enough to have a valuable opinion.

GOV. I agree that mgmt is not about to dilute earnings and certainly they will
not cut the dividend.
No debt, nice tenants. A keeper if you can live with a 7% yield.
That said, I sold off my expensive shares at 23.40+. Keeping the rest.

GOV. Agree, and will follow you guys: Sold my expensive $23 shares now. Keeping
the rest.

Crux of it for me does seem to be, can I live with a 7% yield? I'll say yes,
but maybe not so willingly with an overweight position.

Congrats to all in GOV. Tried to get some in the secondary with no luck.

Anyone with knowledge or interest in SWS? It just popped up as one to watch.
P/B below 1 (one always has to question the quality of each company's BV),
decent yield, relatively low PE. Stagnant earnings growth. One of the few
trading at the low end of its 52 week range.
I was a customer at the old mydiscountbroker.com, and traded this one in the
go-go internet bubble days. Look at the chart back then - timber!!

Hi Grommit -

Hedged my GOV shares by selling the June $22.5 calls. This will provide me to
capture two dividend cycles (@ $0.40/qtr). According to their latest
prospectus, their next quarterly report will reflect all the expenses (and
fees) from their most recent property acquisitions. The March dividend payment
will also reflect the new share count which reflects 30% more shares.

Any surprise to the declared dividend for March or June should provide me the
opportunity to buy back the options I sold at $1.70/contract at some
significant discount. Otherwise, my stock gets called away locking in an
annualized return of 19% ($2.20/share for 6 months).

I like all the aspects of the GOV REIT but am still suspect to the huge
increase in shares from the over subscribed secondary and if there is
sufficient cash flow from the rental income to post a sustained dividend north
of $0.40/share. We should have a much better idea after the June 2010 report.

This will allow me to back up the truck to buy more shares at prices between
$19/shares-$20/shares w/o getting hit with a loss on my earlier buys.

I am glad to get my hedge in place at my price before the secondary closes
tomorrow. There should be selling pressure on the stock as the arbs close out
their position.

EKS

P.S. Good price action on SVU in the last week. Failed to buy more shares in
the $12.50/share range but I did cover my April $17.5 covered calls for
$0.30/share which I sold earlier for $1.50/share.

SVU surprised the street with a profit in their 1/12/2010 earnings report.
Today they are finally making the ABS consolidations necesarry for long term
earnings growth.

Supervalu to consolidate Albertsons procurement

From the article:"...Supervalu Inc. plans to consolidate its five Albertsons
meat and grocery procurement offices in the western United States into one
regional department in Fullerton, Calif., the company confirmed Wednesday...."

Perhaps they will soon announce a raise in their dividend that they cut last
year.

Unilens Announces Closing of Stock Repurchase Agreement and Director
Resignation
On Wednesday January 20, 2010, 4:00 pm

LARGO, Fla., Jan. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Unilens Vision Inc. (OTC
Bulletin Board: UVICF; TSX Venture Exchange: UVI) today announced the Company
completed the Stock Purchase Agreement announced on November 9, 2009, in which
it repurchased 2,188,861 shares of its common stock, representing approximately
48% of it's outstanding shares, from its largest shareholder, Uniinvest Holding
AG in Liquidation (Uniinvest) for an aggregate purchase price of US $6,894,912
or $3.15 per share.

The Company funded the transaction primarily through a draw of US $6.0 million
against the $6.9 million 5-year term loan facility provided to the Company's
wholly owned subsidiary Unilens Corp., USA, by Regions Bank. The loan facility
was arranged by the Company's Investment Bankers, Hyde Park Capital Partners,
LLC. The loan facility bears a floating interest rate of 30-day LIBOR plus
3.75% with a floor of 4.75%, and is secured by certain assets of the Company.
The purchase price represents a discount of 25% to the closing price of our
common stock in the US of $4.22 on Tuesday January 19, 2010.

Unilens has received and accepted the resignation of Ms. Elizabeth J. Harrison
as a Director of the Company as of January 19, 2010. Ms. Harrison served as the
Uniinvest representative on our Board of Directors since 2006. The Board of
Directors and Management wish to thank Ms. Harrison for her service to the
Company.

"We believe that the stock repurchase represents a very attractive use of our
capital and reflects our commitment to building long-term shareholder value,"
stated Michael Pecora, Chief Executive Officer of Unilens Vision Inc. "The
transaction is highly accretive to earnings per share and eliminates any
possible negative impact on our share value associated with the 48% stock
overhang," concluded Mr. Pecora.
