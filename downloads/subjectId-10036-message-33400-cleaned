Hi Jurgis - How important are the dividends paid when you evaluate your value
stock picks? From your list below, GSK & HOG have the highest yield. I know
that sometimes you give up some growth for the stability of a dividend but I
have found that my overall return is much better with a steady dividend payer
especially if you can load up when these companies are selling at their lows
and are out of favor.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=JNJ,PEP,NKE,MSFT,MMM,HOG,GLW,GSK,CSCO&d=s

I clearly expect many of these high dividend payers to reduce their dividend in
the short term which may provide a good entry point into the stock. One company
I am looking at after a dividend cut is Caterpillar Inc. (CAT).

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=CAT

16 year quarterly dividend history for CAT
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=CAT&a=00&b=2&c=1962&d=01&e=1&f=2009&g=v

I have been going back through the historical prices (past ten years) looking
at the dates of both the reduction and increases in quarterly dividends.

It's my view that when things get very bad, we should see company dividend cuts
which may signal the bottom and provide a good buying opportunity for the
value/growth investor.

EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD) is one I plan to load up on if a dividend cut
is announced.

There are many other companies that will be survivors and an excellent buy on a
dividend cut announcement.

What Buffett has said, is that dividends should be paid ONLY IF the cash flow
reinvestment into business does not bring back good return. And even then
buying back stock is possibly preferable (depending of course on the price of
the stock).

As you may know Buffett never bought a stock for dividends (bonds and
preferreds don't count) and never paid a dividend himself (WSC is kind-of
special case ;)).

Dividend paying companies would rather be caught dead than to admit that dollar
reinvested into their businesses is not bringing adequate returns. So they
explain dividends with a lot of hot air - support for shareholders, income for
shareholders, etc. There is no medium. Either company CAN reinvest earnings
with a good return and then they should not pay dividends. Or it CANNOT and
then they should pay out everything as a dividend. No CEO/CFO will ever do this
though, since nobody wants to run a non-growth cash cow or admit they have such
company on their hands.

If you want support from Value Investing masters for dividends, bring up
Graham. He liked them. Not Buffett though.

It's late, and it's probably not important to this thread (to each their own
and all that) so I'll try not to beat this to death but... that is a mostly
inaccurate representation of what Buffett has said. Buffett is not particular
about how a company is going to go about giving him his return on capital, he
just cares how high that return is. In fact to say:

As you may know Buffett never bought a stock for dividends (bonds and
preferreds don't count)

is nonsensical. Why the artificial distinction between bonds and preferreds vs.
stocks? To Buffett it's all the same thing - he's looking at the future income
stream.

Now, let's look at his investments. First, there's all the companies he's
bought which are not reinvesting most of their profits but instead sending them
back to BRK - what is that if not a form of dividend?

Then off the top of my head, some of his major public holdings:

KO, AXP, WFC, WTM, BNI, KFT, WPO

These all pay a dividend.

The germ of truth in what you're saying is that Buffett has a strong preference
for companies who can consistently reinvest their earnings in their business at
a high rate of return. These rare companies should not be paying dividends
because they can get a higher return on capital for their owners by keeping the
money. That is a far cry from saying dividends don't matter.

re Dividends -
I like dividends too. While I like to see money reinvested at a good return the
question really is if most companies are able to do so. Instead they blow it on
acquisitions or buy back stock, usually when it is overpriced. A dividend
instills much needed discipline in many cases, IMO.

There may be exceptions from this rule (BRK is one) or company in hypergrowth
mode should certainly not do a payout but if we look for a company like CSCO, I
think they should pay a dividend.

Buffett did not buy KO, AXP, WFC, WTM, BNI, KFT, WPO for dividends. The fact
that they pay dividends is irrelevant to him. BTW, you know as well as I do
that he accounts for them using look-through earnings, which do not change at
all whether company pays dividend or not. In fact they would increase if these
companies stopped paying dividends, because there would be less taxation.

The fact that he can FORCE his owned companies to be cash cows and not reinvest
poorly in their own businesses just supports what I said: there is no medium.
Either pay out all, or reinvest. Buffett is 100% reinvestor. His cash cows are

Sure, if you assume that management is going to blow the money away in stupid
expansion projects, dividend is good. The problem is that 2% or 4% or even 8%
dividend does not save you. If management is blowing 80% or 50% of earnings
into stupid projects (and returning remaining 20-50% to you as dividend), you
will lose as surely as if they were blowing 100% of the earnings. That's why
Buffett evaluates management first, foremost and even second, third etc. Plus
he makes assurances that even if idiots ran the business, the business won't
die. (Which is actually not true, look at what is happening to Moody's, Geico
was almost BK at one point, and I am sure that stupid management could screw up
even Coke, but Buffett tells this tale for some assurance. ;)).

Yeah, I am totally with you: most managements do not follow Buffett paradigm
(good growth or cash cow). They are only interested in growth at any costs.
Plus they look for the way to please Wall Street, analysts, some generic
shareholder groups, etc. HOG has spent more cash to buy back stock in last
couple years than its current market cap. Would have been better to hoard that
cash... But what do you propose to do? Buy only dividend stocks? Just remember
that if company pays out a dividend then it is probably (possibly?) just a cash
cow with almost no growth left. And most of the dividend paying companies are
overpriced if assumed to be cash cows. Of course, CSCO, MSFT, or even JNJ, PG,
KO will have some growth, so they are not totally flat cash cows. But some of
them are close to zero growth.

I am not against companies paying dividends, although I would prefer that they
did not pay them if they can reinvest the cash better. But I don't take
dividends into account at all when I buy stock.

Not true. His businesses are allowed to reinvest the portion of their earnings,
even if it's all of their earnings, that will provide a good return. He wants
the same thing with the public companies. It is very possible, even common,
that some portion of a company's earnings can be reinvested in the business at
a good rate of return, but that there are excess earnings that are better
allocated to dividends or buybacks. The quality of the company's decision in
this area is most certainly important to Buffett. Future earnings that are
going to be invested at a sub par return are definitely inferior to future
earnings that will be returned to him in the form of a dividend.

if you don't understand the difference between bond and stock, we should stop

Warren Buffett – The Ultimate Dividend Investor
http://www.dividendgrowthinvestor.com/2008/10/warren-buffett-ultimate-dividend.
tml
From the article:"...Most companies that have managed to increase their
dividends for long periods of time are ones that have wide moats as well as
excellent competitive advantages in the marketplace. Having these qualities
leads to rising earnings which tend to support a steady pace of increase in
dividends...."

According to the article (10/2008), 86% of the companies in BRK-A paid some
type of dividend. 12 companies are dividend aristocrats, one is a dividend
champion and three are dividend achievers.

================================================================
I do know from my current portfolio asset allocation, I am currently moving
some bond money (yielding less than 1%) into dividend "aristocrat" type
equities that yield over 3% so I can lock in a better than bond yield and get a
Buffet type value bargain.

I do agree with you that buying equities based on dividend yields alone
(especially when treasury rates are much higher) is not a very useful metric
for screening undervalued stocks. However with current T-bill rates so low
(<1%) it is one factor I am now using with other standard value measurements to
screen possible new buys.

He will be unhappy if they do this, but he is not going to sell because of such

WPO differently than they are being run, but he has no control over overall
management of these companies as he has no control over their dividend. (Even
when he was on BODs, he did not choose to strongly enforce any of the
principles he believes in, like management compensation). He chooses to invest
for long term and the dividend policy is not one of criteria.

It is very possible, even common, that some portion of a company's earnings can
be reinvested in the business at a good rate of return, but that there are
excess earnings that are better allocated to dividends or buybacks.

Please give concrete examples.

It is very possible for company to hoard cash for future possibilities to
reinvest in the business at a good rate of return. And it is preferable to
dividends. And it is something that very few companies did before this
catastrophe. HOG would not be in the current doghouse if they did not
repurchase shares at high prices + paid a dividend.

I have no problem with someone incorporating dividends into their investment

not mean I paid any attention to divvy when buying them. :)

There are some who do have "dividend yield" as a primary metric for screening
undervalued stocks.

I am a fan of the work of Anthony Spare:

http://www.amazon.com/Relative-Dividend-Yield-Investing-Appreciation/dp/0471327

and his ex-associate, Nancy Tengler:

http://books.global-investor.com/books/15959/Nancy-Tengler/New-Era-Value-Invest

These two (and their methods) seem to have disappeared in past five or so
years. Ms Tengler ran a mutual fund that used her methods, but that fund
disappeared too. (It had some trouble too with SEC in that year where several
funds got caught allowing purchases after market close.)

Maybe their methods will return to some favor. It sometimes looks to me that
we're back in the 1958 era where stocks yield more than bonds, and that they
should according to that mindset, since stocks are risky and growth/growth
stocks, what's growth in a long-term recession? I wouldn't be surprised to see
more emphasis on dividend yield as a reasonable screening metric. We see on
this thread - it seems to me anyway - there are more people requiring a
dividend yield or emphasizing dividend yield in their stock selections.

From the 1984 Chairman's letter:

http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1984.html

Dividend policy is often reported to shareholders, but seldom explained. A
company will say something like, “Our goal is to pay out 40% to 50% of earnings
and to increase dividends at a rate at least equal to the rise in the CPI”. And
that’s it - no analysis will be supplied as to why that particular policy is
best for the owners of the business. Yet, allocation of capital is crucial to
business and investment management. Because it is, we believe managers and
owners should think hard about the circumstances under which earnings should be
retained and under which they should be distributed.

The first point to understand is that all earnings are not created equal. In
many businesses particularly those that have high asset/profit ratios -
inflation causes some or all of the reported earnings to become ersatz. The
ersatz portion - let’s call these earnings “restricted” - cannot, if the
business is to retain its economic position, be distributed as dividends. Were
these earnings to be paid out, the business would lose ground in one or more of
the following areas: its ability to maintain its unit volume of sales, its
long-term competitive position, its financial strength. No matter how
conservative its payout ratio, a company that consistently distributes
restricted earnings is destined for oblivion unless equity capital is otherwise
infused.

Restricted earnings are seldom valueless to owners, but they often must be
discounted heavily. In effect, they are conscripted by the business, no matter
how poor its economic potential. (This
retention-no-matter-how-unattractive-the-return situation was communicated
unwittingly in a marvelously ironic way by Consolidated Edison a decade ago. At
the time, a punitive regulatory policy was a major factor causing the company’s
stock to sell as low as one-fourth of book value; i.e., every time a dollar of
earnings was retained for reinvestment in the business, that dollar was
transformed into only 25 cents of market value. But, despite this
gold-into-lead process, most earnings were reinvested in the business rather
than paid to owners. Meanwhile, at construction and maintenance sites
throughout New York, signs proudly proclaimed the corporate slogan, “Dig We
Must”.)

Restricted earnings need not concern us further in this dividend discussion.
Let’s turn to the much-more-valued unrestricted variety. These earnings may,
with equal feasibility, be retained or distributed. In our opinion, management
should choose whichever course makes greater sense for the owners of the
business.

This principle is not universally accepted. For a number of reasons managers
like to withhold unrestricted, readily distributable earnings from shareholders
- to expand the corporate empire over which the managers rule, to operate from
a position of exceptional financial comfort, etc. But we believe there is only
one valid reason for retention. Unrestricted earnings should be retained only
when there is a reasonable prospect - backed preferably by historical evidence
or, when appropriate, by a thoughtful analysis of the future - that for every
dollar retained by the corporation, at least one dollar of market value will be
created for owners. This will happen only if the capital retained produces
incremental earnings equal to, or above, those generally available to
investors.

To illustrate, let’s assume that an investor owns a risk- free 10% perpetual
bond with one very unusual feature. Each year the investor can elect either to
take his 10% coupon in cash, or to reinvest the coupon in more 10% bonds with
identical terms; i.e., a perpetual life and coupons offering the same cash-or-
reinvest option. If, in any given year, the prevailing interest rate on
long-term, risk-free bonds is 5%, it would be foolish for the investor to take
his coupon in cash since the 10% bonds he could instead choose would be worth
considerably more than 100 cents on the dollar. Under these circumstances, the
investor wanting to get his hands on cash should take his coupon in additional
bonds and then immediately sell them. By doing that, he would realize more cash
than if he had taken his coupon directly in cash. Assuming all bonds were held
by rational investors, no one would opt for cash in an era of 5% interest
rates, not even those bondholders needing cash for living purposes.

If, however, interest rates were 15%, no rational investor would want his money
invested for him at 10%. Instead, the investor would choose to take his coupon
in cash, even if his personal cash needs were nil. The opposite course -
reinvestment of the coupon - would give an investor additional bonds with
market value far less than the cash he could have elected. If he should want
10% bonds, he can simply take the cash received and buy them in the market,
where they will be available at a large discount.

An analysis similar to that made by our hypothetical bondholder is appropriate
for owners in thinking about whether a company’s unrestricted earnings should
be retained or paid out. Of course, the analysis is much more difficult and
subject to error because the rate earned on reinvested earnings is not a
contractual figure, as in our bond case, but rather a fluctuating figure.
Owners must guess as to what the rate will average over the intermediate
future. However, once an informed guess is made, the rest of the analysis is
simple: you should wish your earnings to be reinvested if they can be expected
to earn high returns, and you should wish them paid to you if low returns are
the likely outcome of reinvestment.

Many corporate managers reason very much along these lines in determining
whether subsidiaries should distribute earnings to their parent company. At
that level,. the managers have no trouble thinking like intelligent owners. But
payout decisions at the parent company level often are a different story. Here
managers frequently have trouble putting themselves in the shoes of their
shareholder-owners.

With this schizoid approach, the CEO of a multi-divisional company will
instruct Subsidiary A, whose earnings on incremental capital may be expected to
average 5%, to distribute all available earnings in order that they may be
invested in Subsidiary B, whose earnings on incremental capital are expected to
be 15%. The CEO’s business school oath will allow no lesser behavior. But if
his own long-term record with incremental capital is 5% - and market rates are
10% - he is likely to impose a dividend policy on shareholders of the parent
company that merely follows some historical or industry-wide payout pattern.
Furthermore, he will expect managers of subsidiaries to give him a full account
as to why it makes sense for earnings to be retained in their operations rather
than distributed to the parent-owner. But seldom will he supply his owners with
a similar analysis pertaining to the whole company.

In judging whether managers should retain earnings, shareholders should not
simply compare total incremental earnings in recent years to total incremental
capital because that relationship may be distorted by what is going on in a
core business. During an inflationary period, companies with a core business
characterized by extraordinary economics can use small amounts of incremental
capital in that business at very high rates of return (as was discussed in last
year’s section on Goodwill). But, unless they are experiencing tremendous unit
growth, outstanding businesses by definition generate large amounts of excess
cash. If a company sinks most of this money in other businesses that earn low
returns, the company’s overall return on retained capital may nevertheless
appear excellent because of the extraordinary returns being earned by the
portion of earnings incrementally invested in the core business. The situation
is analogous to a Pro-Am golf event: even if all of the amateurs are hopeless
duffers, the team’s best-ball score will be respectable because of the
dominating skills of the professional.

Many corporations that consistently show good returns both on equity and on
overall incremental capital have, indeed, employed a large portion of their
retained earnings on an economically unattractive, even disastrous, basis.
Their marvelous core businesses, however, whose earnings grow year after year,
camouflage repeated failures in capital allocation elsewhere (usually involving
high-priced acquisitions of businesses that have inherently mediocre
economics). The managers at fault periodically report on the lessons they have
learned from the latest disappointment. They then usually seek out future
lessons. (Failure seems to go to their heads.)

In such cases, shareholders would be far better off if earnings were retained
only to expand the high-return business, with the balance paid in dividends or
used to repurchase stock (an action that increases the owners’ interest in the
exceptional business while sparing them participation in subpar businesses).
Managers of high-return businesses who consistently employ much of the cash
thrown off by those businesses in other ventures with low returns should be
held to account for those allocation decisions, regardless of how profitable
the overall enterprise is.

Thanks Paul. I will have to see if my local library has these books.

For those who missed the links, here are the book reviews Paul referenced.

Here is the Amazon review

Relative Dividend Yield: Common Stock Investing for Income and Appreciation,
2nd Edition (Hardcover)

Anthony Spare and Paul Ciotti make a logical, but uninspired, case for making
Relative Dividend Yield part of one's equity valuation and also one's buy/sell
decisions. The book is clearly written and offers ample graphs to substantiate
the notion of buying equities when dividend yields are high, and selling them
once they are low.

Actually, the graphs may be too ample...readers of this rather expensive
248-page book will quickly learn that the text is a bit long on charts showing
individual equity dividend yields relative to stock indexes over time, and a
bit short on specifics concerning the avoidance of issues whose yields are high
for good reason.

That's the book's essential deficiency: the authors devote a mere twelve overly
general pages to "Pitfalls and Preventative Measures" (Chapter 6). Also, since
investors will likely have a difficult time constructing the kinds of charts
the Relative Dividend Yield methodology requires, it would have been helpful to
offer tips on a cost-effective means to make this methodology applicable in
real-time. The authors do, however, provide graphs with prior relative dividend
yield histories, with room to continue plotting these yields, on several "blue
chip" dividend-paying equities.

Description of New Era Value Investing

This is an unique guide that combines the best of traditional value theory with
an innovative approach to assessing value in low or non dividend paying
stocks.In the 1990s, America's focus on productivity and innovation led to huge
gains in technology, communication, and healthcare stocks, and contributed to
the transformation of the U.S. stock market from a value (dividend paying
orientation) to a growth (nondividend paying) bias. During this time, forward
thinking value managers began to develop analytical tools for valuing
nondividend paying stocks. These tools allowed them to evaluate and identify
the best investments in both traditional and nontraditional value sectors. At
the forefront of this movement was author Nancy Tengler who, along with Noel
DeDora, developed "Relative Value Discipline," an approach which combines two
proven methods for valuing growth stocks: Relative Dividend Yield and Relative
to Price Sales. The combination of these approaches allows individuals to
invest across the investment universe regardless of dividend policies."
New Era Value Investing" introduces the proven method known as Relative Value
Discipline by combining the excitement of developing a new investment
discipline with the lessons learned through the application of this new
methodology in the real world. In addition to providing an insider's look at an
investment manager's experience in adopting a new investment approach, this
book creates a context for understanding the transformation of the U.S.
economy, and offers expert insights beyond those of traditional value theory.
Nancy Tengler (San Francisco, CA) is President and Chief Investment Officer of
Fremont Investment Advisors. She is co-author of "Relative Dividend Yield:
Common Stock Investing for Income and Appreciation" (Wiley: 0 471 53652 0). She
has appeared on numerous financial radio and television programs, including
CNN/fn and is frequently quoted in financial publications such as "The Wall

peeked (w/i the last 52 weeks) at $85.96. A 14 bagger in 16 years.

If things get bad, I expect the company to cut their dividend by 50% to
$.22/share per quarter. This would be what they were paying in 2005. In fact if
the company cut their dividend by 75%, it would only be at the rate they were
paying in 1997.

It appears that the market is looking for CAT to move lower, perhaps below
$25/share. I will be watching for a dividend cut and a spike in selling volume
to signal to me that a potential bottom has been reached. This might be a good
entry point to start a small position.

EKS, a possible drawback with using the relative dividend model is that you
have to have historical data (20 years' worth preferably) on dividend yields
both of the individual company being looked at and the yield comparator (which
generally would be the S&P).

Here are a couple of old posts where I talk more about relative dividend yield
(RDY) and how I was using it:

I'm pretty much with Buffett on this. IMHO, dividends don't matter.

I continue to believe, as the excerpt demonstrates, that Buffett thinks
dividends matter a lot.

I guess we are talking about two different things. Maybe they are not different
to you, but they are different to me.

In investment decision, dividends don't matter to Buffett and you have not
demonstrated that they do.

He has a strong opinion how and when dividends should be paid, so they do
matter in that kind of sense and he forces his wholly owned businesses to
adhere to his philosophy. I have seen no evidence that he ever pushed any of
his passive investments to adhere to the philosophy. I have also not seen that
he made investment buy/sell/not-buy decision based on it.

GE is really getting shafted here. Right now it looks like the industrial part

Buffett buys 15% yield new HOG bonds. I wish I had access to this deal...
Instead I continue to hold common, which does not really benefit from having to

Out of HOG now (as of today). I want to reconsider the situation.

HOG borrows $600M at 15% interest. Things must be pretty bad if they have to
borrow at that level. And HOG still will pay a dividend?

Stock up now a little because loan is from Buffett (and Chris Davis).

Mr. Buffett could buy HOG, and pundits often propose that he do that. Looks
like his conservatism about the company's prospects make the 15% more
attractive. That assured 15%. Or perhaps it's an early clue that Mr. Buffett is
eyeing HOG common too. Which might imply a floor to the stock is near.

I'll wager HOG stock drops back though after the Buffett news recedes.

Had closed my NDN position again. Returning now for a small buy.

Somewhat confusing situation: Company is big in California and expanded into
Texas. Inexplicably unsuccessfully. (I would have believed there were similarly
enough poor people/bargain shoppers who favor 99c Only Stores in Texas as in
Cal.) Anyway, company had put the TX stores up for sale and ceo has offered to
buy them. Now - in past few weeks - the TX stores have done well and bod says
they'll at least postpone the decision to sell. Meanwhile tomorrow the company
makes its quarterly earnings announcement.

Stores are busy with 99c item buyers. In past, I've been surprised that
earnings were down because of "shrinkage" (theft). To me, that implies
seriously sloppy/weak management control.

RE HOG- the 15% interest shows that HOG is in far worse shape than you think.
If HOGS BBB+ rating were real they would have to pay to the tune of 9% nowadays
- the spreads for the better credits have sunk recently. HOG's 15% yield means
that in the eyes of their creditors, HOG's is rated junk to the tune of BB or
even less.

Creditors still give it a 3B$ market cap at this point. I would consider HOG's
common overvalued under these circumstances.

Paul asked a while ago about RCL and it's debt. There is CWZ which is nothing
but RCL debt in (Lehman) wrapper, trading currently for a 20%+ yield. I think
RCL is toast too, I believe they have orders out for more cruise ships that are
going to be paid next year. Wish them good luck, they will need it. I don't

I'm a holder of DIS and am considering adding here. Imo, the strength of Disney
is now its ESPN network. It's growing worldwide, and it's one of the few places
where advertisers can pick up a broad geographic in one place (men - young,
middle, older.)

DIS falls within my metrics for a value stock. Some people believe that the key
to evaluating media stocks is free cash flow. I'll use that metric for
discussion here, although it's not one I have been using in my own evaluation
of DIS.

I see that free cash flow is $3.9B:

http://corporate.disney.go.com/investors/annual_reports/2008/introduction/freeC
shFlow.html

SI shows 1.85B shares out.

http://si.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&cb=1233792811&symbol=NY ^DIS

That makes free cash flow per share at about $2.10 sh. With DIS roughly $19/sh,
a buyer of the stock now gets a free cash flow yield of about 11.5%. That looks
decent enough to me to be a holder of the stock.

Of course, if parts of the business do disintegrate - the cruise ships/theme
parks/others, free cash flow dollars disappear and the stock won't seem like an
attractive buy on that metric.

I have a few shares bought at much higher prices than currently. Maybe I will
average down with a small share buy now.

Not too many positive headlines recently. I am watching for the next shoe to
drop as it's possible that our current economic slowdown could spiral into
several quarters of deflation. If this is the case, equities may be cheaper
tomorrow than today.

I am looking to future dividend cuts as one signal that we may have touched
bottom. So far, there are few companies that have "slashed" their dividend. In
fact GE stated today that they are willing to have their AAA rating downgraded
to AA before they would cut their dividend. I think it is time to be cautious.

I missed SPECTRA ENERGY (NYQ: SE) below $14 this morning. I suspect if they cut
their dividend, I should be able to buy in below $12.50. Their fourth-quarter
profit dropped 41 percent as sales fell across all of their business units. I
was a little gun shy to buy this AM with their sales down so much and was
surprised to see that the slow down even hit their distribution business

Oh, we agree on more than PEP. Heh, hmme, JNJ, I think, although I have not

see where else we agree. I seem to have moved into 3 directions recently:

- Smallcap Chinese stocks. You have some of those and they are all in the
gutter and perhaps too much shame to talk for me or you.

- Oil. Not sure if you are still holding your Bakken, Marcellus and other shale
plays, possibly they were mostly NG rather than oil. I concentrate on oil. We
agree on COP maybe? Although I may switch out of it Buffett's investment
notwithstanding. I think COP is too big, I don't like their integrated side,
and I don't like the fact that they can't replace the oil they are producing.

- Buffett companies. Or what I thought them to be. Lots of disagreement and
teeth gnashing here. :) I prefer my holdings of MSFT, GRMN, GLW, COH, PEP, JNJ,
NKE, WYE, MMM here. Also HOG although I am not going to add to it, since
concerns about it are real. I'd be looking to add to most of the above at right
prices.

The problem is that I am much closer to you than you'd think. :) :( I have way
too many positions and I should reduce their number, not add new names. My goal
to exclude stocks so far is failing much more than I'd like to admit, so sorry
if I try to discard almost everything I don't own.

Yes, we agree on many of those.

Basically for now I'm holding on to many losing positions. I am trying to
contain myself and buy or add only the stocks I'm interested in when they are
at/near 12-mo. lows.

I have JNJ. So at current price, I'm a holder, not a buyer or seller.

COP, I agree with your reasons, and for those reasons, I've sold down my full
position to a small amount.

NKE, COH I don't follow. I'm an adder to MMM if it hits new lows. Ditto PEP.
GLW I am holding on, but not adding to.

Still holding on to shale plays. Have reduced positions and eliminated some. I
believe I still hold at least one stock in each of the various shales though.

I still hold a bunch of Chinese stocks. Not sure what I will do with many of
them. Have read Chinese unemployment now at 60M people. Have several of the
real estate stocks (many recco. and held by Marty Whitman). Not sure what I
will do with these. Yes, low pride:shame ratio for me with couple of the penny
health-care stocks we may both be holding (CHME.ob, LTUS.ob). These stocks all
a speculative portion of my portfolio. Very small commitment. Agree w/you on
possibility of 2x-3x bagger possibilities exist here. Risk is there though too
I suspect.

I like (hold) CHL for cell phones. Less risk there imo. I'm intending to punch
up JST position if stock keeps falling on no adverse news. My only add to
China.

My view is that it's inconsistent to charge DIS with both low roe and too many
intangible assets. If intangibles are written off, I assume it'd be because
those assets are not producing earnings. (If they did produce earnings why
write off the assets). I'm not even aware that DIS has large non-performing
intangible assets.

If DIS book is over loaded with intangibles and those intangibles do blow up, I
would assume the earnings essentially remain the same (Profits not coming from
the intangibles that were written off.) So those earnings on a much reduced
stated book value mean much higher roe.

(that's a blue chip and expensive), WH. My buy list in China would be WH (lower
than here) and SDTH. I think they are more - what's the word - "reliable" or
"predictable" or "understandable" and may also benefit from infrastructure
stimulus in China. I am still considering your JST.

Regarding DIS. Your reasoning is somewhat right. Let me throw out couple of
numbers: 2008 ROE was ~13.5%, 2008 ROIC ~10%, 2008 ROIC with intangibles
subtracted from equity: 20%. I am not looking at the last quarter, which is
Q1/2009 on purpose. So the only number which looks respectable is 2008 ROIC
with intangibles subtracted from equity: 20%. But then I compare it to JNJ
which has ROE (and ROIC since their cash and debt cancels) of 29% and ROIC with
intangibles subtracted from equity 77%! Of course, DIS is much cheaper than JNJ
on P/Book basis, so earnings/EV are comparable between them. And Disney's PE is
cheaper since it does not account for debt. So I guess I understand why it
could be a buy here. I still can't convince myself that it's a buy for me. :)

Shoes: Skechers surprises, misses, cuts '09 earnings estimates and gets
downgraded by three analysts. Stock drops sharply to about $7.45 - and is still
above analysts new reduced targets ($6.50-7) for '09.

I'll up my position. Company is generally profitable (past ten years anyway),
has little ltd, and has plenty of cash (a price:cash ratio of about 2.3 to 1.

http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/090206/skechers_usa_ahead_of_the_bell.html?.v=1

At my quick review here, analysts main concern seems to be excess inventory. On
the one hand, this is a problem that SKX has faced before (so maybe the
controlling managers/stockholders aren't so sharp if they're finding themselves
with the same problem again). Otoh, consumer spending is down sharply
everywhere apparently, and eventually SKX will again better control inventory
overhang.

The shoe business is a very competitive one, influenced heavily by fashion
changes. It may not be a growth sector, but shoes are bought,worn, replaced. I
expect SKX to fight and get its share of the business. I am betting that at
some point, as in every year in the past ten, SKX will again sell at least at
stated book value (now $15).
I look for double in SKX within 18-24 months.

Oops. I see from this previous post I was not sharp enough to buy FL when it
was near lows ($4.36 in Nov. vs. $8.24 now).

S&P 500 Dividends May Decrease 13.3%, Most Since 1942 (Update1)
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601110&sid=aeStJwRNjrjc
Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Dividends for Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies will
probably plunge 13.3 percent this year, the steepest annual decline since 1942,
S&P forecast.

Companies in the 500-stock index are on pace to make $214.7 billion in payouts
in 2009, compared with $247.9 billion, S&P projected in a statement today.

“Given the current economic climate and growing concern over dividend cuts,
dividend increases for the S&P 500 companies are expected to slow in 2009,”
Howard Silverblatt, a New York-based index analyst at S&P, said in the
statement. “Unless companies believe that their financial future will improve,
their need to conserve cash will outweigh their desire to pay dividends.”

The worst year for stocks since the Great Depression pushed dividends as a
percentage of the S&P 500’s price above 4 percent in November, the highest
yield since Bloomberg data begin in 1993.

==============================================================

The dividend payout and yields as a % of the S%P 500 must come down. Either
dividends get slashed or equity prices rise.

Companies may find that they are forced to conserve their cash and will cut
their dividend payout. When this occurs, we may find that we are near the
bottom and it should be "ripe" for value buys.

AINV. I have some shares as part of a package of bdc's.

I have reduced positions in these companies when they have announced intentions
to issue new stock at under book value.

Company in press release still says it might want to issue new shares (Likely
below market price and certainly below book value). Book value has been coming
down (a negative).

Otoh, dividend yield is still high on current low stock price and the new
dividend cut. One has to wonder if the dividend will hold though. Analysts
still seem to be negative:

Thanks for sharing. Seems to be worth the money if in fact the value of its
investments don't have to be marked down significantly. I bought a little when
I saw the opening hit today, but only a potential trade for me, one which may
be quick, win or lose. I never buy a stock for dividends, and particularly in
this environment where many dividends are suspect to cuts. Different age and
goals I guess, but I always felt the real money in the market is made in
capital gains, not sitting on things to collect dividends while prices erode. I
do know many people that have bought and stayed with utilities which have at
least held up better than most of the individual yo yo's. So its just my
perspective at age 53. Most of my retirement is safe money, so if I am going to
risk the stock market with a small percentage of total capital, I prefer to try
for gains, not dividends.

AINV seemed to get some support at its lows again today but it does also seem
no better than a 50/50 proposition.

Seems to me the recent rally is a technical reflex rebound and not the start of
anything significant for the stock market.

No screen, just alot of hard work. And to be honest, not all work out, but when
the don't I'm gone. I sold my GMK flat not long after trying it. Derivative
issues and unknowns gave me second thoughts. Even now, AINV is giving me second
thoughts. I went through each and every stock in all my watch lists one by one.
Then I went through every component of the S and P 600 and the Russell 2000 as
well. I examine each balance sheet, examine the earnings for 2008, the
estimates for 2009, and search news for any recent developments that would be a
negative impact. If the stock meets my criteria, the first of which is that
it's selling at a worthy discount to net tangible asset value it gets
consideration for adding to the value list. Earnings of 2008, recent quarterly
earnings, and 2009 estimates should be positive or only negative by a marginal
amount with potential for improvement. I then annotate each chart in the watch
list with notes on book value and earnings so that ongoing dynamics of the
stock price movement can be compared to the current stock price on any given
day. I have 480 stocks in this value watch list and the project is done. Now
it's a matter of watching, timing, and hopefully benefiting from countless
hours of hard work. The market is not yet overbought, but I expect it to be by
the time the stupulous is passed. So I'm cautious about this rally.

I had a little luck this year with stocks like FCSX, NNBR, OME, CAP, GVHR, RELL
NM, and several others. Been watching LIZ and it's a name that could be a

Trading Tools to Build Your Portfolio: PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP)
Did strong earnings from a bottler burst options bettors' bearish bubble?
http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/commentary/content/trading+tools+to+build+you
+portfolio+pepsico+inc+pep/observations.aspx?ID=91042#91042

From the article:"...Call Volume Pops

On Thursday, options players scooped up nearly 12,500 calls on the carbonation
king, more than 3.5 times the stock's average daily volume of fewer than 3,400
contracts. Most of the bulls were placing their bets a little further into the
future; the stock's April 52.50 call was the most popular, with more than 5,000
contracts crossing the tape.

However, it seems options traders yesterday diverged from the bearish path, as
the recent surge in call volume stands in contrast to the sentiment on the
International Securities Exchange (ISE). During the past 10 days, options
players on the ISE have purchased (to open) more puts than calls on PEP. What's
more, the ratio of 1.81 is only 2 percentage points from an annual pessimistic
peak. In other words, during the past couple of weeks, traders on the ISE have
been significantly more skeptical than usual.

So, why the bombardment of bullish bets?..."

DFT -- I found this recent WSJ article.

The slowdown in new data-center facilities comes at a difficult time. To cut
costs during the recession, many businesses running out of space in their own
data centers have turned to third-party data-center providers to rent out
space. Demand for these services rose 14% from a year earlier in 2008 and is
expected to increase at similar or greater rates for the next several years,
according to Tier1 Research.

Now the demand and supply is likely to diverge even more over the next few
years, as the typical data center takes 12 to 24 months to build, says Daniel
Golding, a Tier1 analyst. "It could be a big problem," he says.

"In the U.S., prices for space in commercial data centers could rise 10% a year
compared with 3% a year typically, predicts Mr. Golding, the Tier1 analyst. But
he adds that it is still cheaper for businesses to swallow such a price
increase than build their own data center, because the facilities typically
cost more than $1,000 a square foot and the price tag for a large center can
exceed $100 million."

Seems to be in a fairly good uptrend. No doubt some fits and starts along the
way. Too bad I never bit when it was $2.00, but I think it can do better with
some patience. Still seems relatively cheap. The way I calculate, even if they
marked down their assets by 50% which is quite unlikely, it would still be
tangibly worth almost twice the current price. Since they are expected to be
net profitable in 2009, it has a fair margin of safety at these prices.

I2, regarding your PG comment:

I am getting a little worried that you might be right about PG getting back
down to $40.

Somewhat reassuring though, I see there's an article in yesterday's Barron's
where PG is discussed favorably: "Buy P&G Shares Before They Crest"

Snippet: "On a forward price-to-earnings basis, P&G is now cheaper than it's
been in 20 years...
Is that a reason to jump into P&G? "You better believe it," says Jack Russo, an

sheer scale and product and geographic diversity to go with a strong balance

searching for discussion and sees the name "Silicon Investor" there's a pretty
good chance he's heard of it even if he's never used it before.

I think I've mentioned before (somewhere, anyway) that it's not at all unusual

Which kinda brings me in a half-circle to a new and related point.

I think that relative strength and weakness in SI's metrics could possibly be a

Measuring quality is a very difficult to measure. And SI is quality. The
longevity and quality of the posters and communities that have formed and
remained over the years. You can't quantify that by number of eyeballs, number

How can you measure the quality of those who put forth knowledge that is way
beyond what can be found in the media outlets. You just have to feel it and try

It can be done and some have done it before, but it's not easy. It comes down
to manually checking post numbers at a specific time each day to see how many
new ones there are, or writing a script to do the same thing.

And we don't mind scripts, as long as they're not wasting our bandwidth by
stepping through post numbers one at a time. There are ways to do it without

It surely seems that SI lost a lot of posters who exited both SI and the market
at that time.

I'd like to see an updated account of how many people are now really reading
some of these subjectmarks. Especially this one.

===========================
This subjectmark shows 1025 who have it bookmarked now. I recall seeing 1029 a
few months ago. These numbers to me seem way too high. It looks like to be
among the top 50 posters here, somebody would've had to post only as few as 118
times over the past five years. I'm guessing maybe there are at most 25 active
posters now - maybe more like 10.
Okay, I get that posting is different from reading, which might be different
from bookmarking. I can't believe though there are as many as 1000 people on SI
who have this site bookmarked and who are reading posts here (lurking). I do
see where this value thread shows up sometimes among Active Subjects
(Investment) and where now it's #13 on Hot Subjects (Investment).

I have trouble believing the 1025 number though. With the different value
investing styles presented on this thread, with their proponents having strong
opinions for their particular approach, with all the different stocks brought
up and discussed, I just cannot believe that if there were nearly 1000
bookmarks here and maybe even "only" 500 readers and lurkers among the 1025
bookmarkers, that among the 500, somewhere along the line, a hot button for
them would've been pressed, and they would have come forward and posted a
comment. Or even mention or cross-reference this thread (subjectmark) on some
other threads on which they might be a poster.

Without having any supporting facts, my impression is that maybe there might be
100 total posters and lurkers here. I have to believe the 1025 number has got
to be outdated - and not at all representative of a lower number who actually
conistently or occasionally read this thread.

From the 1025 original bookmarks, 739 remained when the site was revamped and
everyone had to confirm their registration (2004 sometime?). That makes the

Just 377 of those posters with a subject mark have logged in to SI in the last

Ah, I had wondered how those headings were interpreted. It's confused me (e.g.

I see now it's more related to the poster.

"Just 377 of those posters with a subject mark have logged in to SI in the last

It's 155 posts that were "somewhere. Not just on "The Value Thread"

I count that since Jan 10, 2009 there have been 33494-33264 = 230 posts here.
Just scanning over that, I'm guessing no more than 25 different people posted
here during this time.

So maybe the readership is 377 posters who have bookmarked here and who have
logged on recently. I'll assume that if they have this site bookmarked, they
read it.

That is all SO true. When we acquired the site back in 03, part of it was out
of my personal affinity for the site, part of it was being pretty sure it would
be a wise investment, and a huge part of it was seeing the writing on the wall
and not wanting to see the lights turned off and this community and its history
disappearing into the ether.

Guess I'm still on topic because I consider SI a value investment. Of a very
real and big kind personally.

As you said, you can't really measure quality. Though you can measure some of
its side benefits. And quality people attract more quality people. Which can be
measured.

And it really is the Community that makes for the quality. Dave and I just run
the joint. Though Dave does do his part for quality by keeping the miscreants
at bay. And when he has to bit-smack someone publicly, it's often in a quality,
funny way.

Anyway, long way of saying that SI's reputation for quality remains, even after
all these years, and even though iHub is, by a huge margin, the busier of the
two sites. And that we have a reputation for quality can't be discounted as a
reason the things that can be quantified are growing as Joe Everyman decides
now might be the time to research and possibly buy some quality, name-brand
stocks.

The really good news was in three items below the headline income and FFO
numbers:

1. The company indicated that it had successfully obtained new financing, with
no maturities until 2011.

2. Construction of ACC4 and ACC5 has restarted.

3. Although the dividend remains suspended for Q1 and Q2 of 2009, the company
indicated that it plans to pay dividends of 0.17 to 0.23/sh during 2009.

Clarity on these issues should be a positive catalyst for the REIT.

I was sure some variant of that information had to be publicly available
somewhere as Dave is absolutely nuts about stats like that and he's written
quite a bit of the more elegant stuff here.

I have to wonder about the definition of "logged in". Whether it counts people
who have remained logged in and came to the site, or whether it's only people
who have logged out, so have had to go through the login process. I know
because I ran across it today while doing something else that we do track the
last date someone logged in, and it was a really old date for me.

Something else to bear in mind that really kinda beggars belief when talking
about a free site, but is a fact of life with message boards nonetheless. There
are always WAY more people lurking who aren't logged in than there are who are
logged in and lurking. In fact, there are ratios between posts and reads, and
logged-in readers and non-logged-in readers that're pretty much constants.
Talkzilla, despite being relatively still in the cradle, is starting to see
these same ratios come into play.

And we have no way of figuring out how many people are lurking particular
boards while not being logged in.

It might be helpful, though, to have a "Most Read" list here like we have on
iHub.

Active Subjects, btw, is simply a reverse chronological listing of boards with
the most recent posts. Once I hit Submit on this post, this board will be at
the top of that list until someone posts somewhere else.

Edit: Oh, wait. I see that "logged in" doesn't seem to factor into it. It's
activity. Which would only apply to logged in members. We don't update the time
everytime everyone does anything, though. I'm not sure which activities do get
logged, but know it's possible to make your way through quite a bit of the site
and still be considered "inactive" as far as the database is concerned. Because
it'd be way too expensive in terms of workload to have the system do an update
every time every user clicked any thing.
