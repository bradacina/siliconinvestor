Followed you in on BWP for a starter position. This company complements my
TransCanada Corp. (TRP) position. The 8% yield for BWP is much more attractive.
The dividend payout ratio is high at 105% when compared to TRPs at 51%.

Peeled off some shares of SFL to finance the purchase. The upside for SFL is

yes you are right its from CS. However one of the charts that WM provides notes
that something like 85% of their mortgage loans in california are coastal ones
as opposed to inland ones and that coastal prices have held up from better.
Also I not that even on the option arms a large number of mortgage buyers put
up at least 20% equity, I dont think such buyers are going to be so quick to
walk away, unless of course they subsequently took out helocs. None the less WM
will still have at least 20% downside protection. I expect coastal california
will recover pretty quickly relative to some other parts of the country.

I would like to know what they are referring to when they say coastal
California. It's a given that the Central and Sacramento valley areas along
with inland Southern Cal are a disaster but according to a Realtor I know (in
Burlingame, CA) WM holds a lot of paper in places like the
Eastern part of the SF Bay Area which is not holding up nearly as well as the
Western part. For example:
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/c/a/2008/07/23/MNE511T63B.DTL&o
1

If they mostly hold paper in places like San Francisco, Marin county, Palo
Alto, Cupertino, etc. then I think they can ride the storm out. The 20% down
policy is encouraging (as opposed to Countryside's incredible zero down option
arm no doc/low doc loans...talk about toxic..) but I wonder how many people
were allowed to extract equity via Helocs. Anyway good luck. I like WM as an
institution (I use them as one of banks...) so I hope they survive.

"its certainly possible that a foreign bank would try to acquire it. Its tough

I was wondering about that--- what exactly it is that's the franchise and
what's valuable about it.

I suspect it's their breadth of branches and maybe their huge base of ATMs.
Perhaps it's their mortgage servicing business. Profitable, I presume, and
maybe valuable for an acquirer who can build on economies of scale.

Every bank's got ATMs and software, and can increase their installed base.
Leasing space or taking over failed bank locations. In current real estate
market, that shouldn't be a problem.

So many banks around my neighborhood. I presume borrowers shop around for best
loans; depositors for best rates. Nothing proprietary or significantly
different about WM from competitors. WM are everywhere though - a convenience
for customers and maybe competitive advantage.

=============
At this time I like Spanish bank BBV. It's got problems because of the decline
(collapse?) in Spanish housing market. There's no USA subprime issue though
(afaik). The bank is international with operations in Latin America, and is
trying to increase its presence in USA: Maybe capture more of the Hispanic
market. The bank is down, not beaten to a pulp though, and pays a 4.5% dividend
yield. I am in now for just a few shares. I expect upside stock potential is
nowhere near WM's possiblity. I just hope the downside to BBV's business and
BBV's stock also doesn't have the negative potential that WM has.

WM - I do not think that a foreign bank will mess with WM. It's too high of a
risk for a foreign bank trying to fix a broken bank. I think it is much more
likely that a bank with and East cost and Midwest footprint will buy them to
become a national franchise. The only bank that seem to be able to do that
would be JPM right now though. Maybe a superregional like PNC is another
possibility but they would have to raise a lot of equity.

TRAD - again. I looked at their Q2 numbers. There's good and then there's bad.
The bad is large decrease of interest income. I am not an expert here, but it
seems that it was caused by interest rate decrease and not tightening of the
spreads. Now, assuming the rates will go up, the income could go up again. On
the other hand, this is still a negative, since it is something that the
company does not control or controls very little and which wags the rest of its
income. Roughly speaking they lost >30% of income due to interest income drop.

On the good side, brokerage commissions and fees have increased over 20%
although expenses have increased about 20% too, which is not so good.

Overall, one has to make two calls here: 1. macro call that interest rates will
stay flat or go up for interest income to increase. 2. market call that TRAD
will continue to gain/keep customers and fees/commissions will not experience a
decline due to price war, etc. I am not certain of either of these things, so I
will sell my tiny position here. IMHO TRAD is not very cheap and not very
expensive here. It could still be an OK holding for diversified portfolio. :)

One thing that I am not so happy about is their use of cash flow to pay
dividends and buy back shares when they still have significant debt on the
balance sheet. I prefer overcapitalized companies. :) Although it's not a big
deal, buybacks and divi is good too. :)

I have a smallish position and I may add if the stock continues to languish.
These conglomerates probably won't do very well unless there is a general
economy upturn. They are not pure plays in anything and unless there is a
strong speculative move, they don't seem to participate. For example, DD did
nothing in agri stock runup though it has a pretty significant agri business.
On the other hand, it is pretty nice to own a strong well-run company that is a
conglomerate. Rewards will come some day. :)

Insurance vs. claims. Yes, less mileage, fewer claims.

I'm figuring profits though won't necessarily increase smartly for insurers as
miles driven decreases. Because fewer claims and expenses will lead to demands
by states that insurance companies reduce their rates. Some states already
aggressive in doing this. I'll bet SAFT's arena, Mass., will be one, if not a

tremendous amounts of free cash flow. It sells at half the market multiple and,
over time, you are probably looking at maybe 1% growth in employment, with 5%
health-care inflation. So you have the top line growing 6%. We think the bottom
line will grow 8% to 10%. These guys could afford to buy back 8%-10% of their
company annually. As far as ranking these companies, I would start with
UnitedHealth, followed by WellPoint and Aetna."

Ah jeez. If people on this thread won't or can't get their value brains around

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction_rate_security

He's possibly lucky he's got you to help him with other things - mutual funds,
maybe some of the Pimco stuff talked about here. I don't know.

One hard lesson I've learned is that the dollar losses involved in these things
can be surprisingly - very surprisingly -- large in comparison to stock price
declines and losses there. That is, if somebody buys a few shares of a stock
and it declines 50%, that's a dastardly shock, but the amount of money is
relatively small (because just a few shares were bought).

Now contrast that with someone who instead of going for a financial instrument
that yields 2.5%, wants some non equity thing that's a "little" more risky, but
yields say 5%. Then the bet to be worthwhile - imo anyway - has to be somewhat
large to make this switch. I mean if it's $20K invested, there is not much gain
at all to be had... an additional 2.5% or $500, over a year. Why bother to give
up safety/surety/peace of mind for an extra $500? So maybe the person would be
wanting to put up instead of $20k, maybe $40K or $60k or $100K into one of
these investment products to get a decent size larger $$ return. (Like $2500
additional on a 5% yield on $100K vs. 2.5% on the 100K in a safer vehicle) And
therein lies the danger. Even a 10% drop - or such a fluctuation - in something
--maybe something like an auction rate security (I don't know) now means the
$100k is down 10K. That is a big $ loss - maybe horrific - to see for somebody
who is not used to losing money. (I.e. somebody who's unsophisticated or
inexperienced with stock fluctuations.)

Oh well, all jmo. I don't know who's telling your fried to buy auction rate
securities - maybe it's somebody who really knows his or her stuff about the
subject and can help your friend. One thing I know I want to stay away from

Upping my losing position in Advent/Claymore Global Convertible Securities &

1. It's the only way I'm holding convertible securities.

2. I'm not looking for much capital gains from an AGC stock price rise. More
for the dividend yield: Currently .1458/sh. per month, that's about 14.4%
annually on $12.10 fund price. According to AGC 2007 tax filing, none of the
dividend was "return of capital". I consider that a positive.

AGC trades now at about a 13% discount to NAV (about $13.82). (That NAV
number's been declining as the underlying securities in the fund have dropped.)
The average discount to NAV over the past year has been 8.8%.

The fund is 25% leveraged. I don't like the leverage aspect - I've seen higher
though on other funds. Perhaps obviously, I'm not going to get a 14% yield off
a diverse group of preferred stocks (even bought at 13% discount to NAV)
without having management employ some sort of leverage. Not thrilled with
management expenses either (1.6%), but for what I am getting - the yield - if
it holds up and isn't chiefly just a return of my capital - I will take and
hold a position in the fund.

re chk and mcdep:

Chief executive Aubrey McClendon of Chesapeake Energy (CHK) portrayed a
potentially massive natural gas field in the Haynesville Shale formation of
North Louisiana and East Texas in a conference call on July 2. Declaring that
the data strongly suggest ultimate recoverable reserves of 250 trillion cubic
feet (tcf), he envisioned 40,000 wells covering an area equivalent to a square
75 miles on a side. That amount of future production might be a quarter of all
the gas produced in the U.S. over the next fifty years.

Taking account of speculative current market values for undeveloped land, Mr.
McClendon builds a plausible value of $150 a share for Chesapeake stock. We
keep our estimate of Net Present Value at $80 a share. In either case, CHK has
a low McDep Ratio and we like the concentration on natural gas, the undervalued
premium fuel. Other companies especially active in the 80% of Haynesville
potential not controlled by CHK include buy-recommended Encana (ECA) in
partnership with buy-recommended Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A). If the tentative
volumes continue to unfold, it could help make natural gas our most important
“alternative” energy.

Evidence that Supply Responds to Price

While we think natural gas price remains below its ultimate worth, it is nice
to know that consumers get more supply for the higher price that has been
evident so far. After languishing in the 1990s, U.S. natural gas reserves have
increased every year in the 2000s to 211 trillion cubic feet at the end of
2006. Now with the development of unconventional natural gas, including that
from shale formations, we are seeing that our most promising alternate fuel is
good old natural gas. Most of the new reserves in the first half of the 2000s
have come from the Rockies, in a geographical extension of the type of tight
gas and coal seam production pioneered in the San Juan Basin, still the largest
U.S. natural gas field with daily production of 4 billion cubic feet (bcfd) and
proven reserves of some 20 tcf. More production from the Rockies awaits new
pipelines.
The latest large new source has been the widely acknowledged shale gas, often
located closer to market and nearer existing pipelines. The Barnett Shale in,
around and under Fort Worth is vying to be the largest U.S. field with
production near 4 bcfd. While proven reserves in the field have not yet reached
20 tcf, Mr. McClendon thinks the North Texas Barnett may ultimately produce 50
tcf over the decades.

An Alternative Energy Program That Could Make Sense

Meanwhile the low price of natural gas is telling us the market could be
expanded. The Chesapeake chief would like to be able to export U.S. natural gas
to take advantage of a $20 a million btu price in Europe next winter, compared
to $14 in the U.S. Stretching his imagination further, he points out that $20
natural gas is a competitive $2.50 a gallon on a gasoline-equivalent basis. The
cost to retrofit 25,000 gasoline stations to supply natural gas as a vehicle
fuel might readily be justified by the economic, environmental and strategic
benefit.
Owners of large cars or small trucks worried about the rising cost of gasoline
might sacrifice some modest space to accommodate a compressed natural gas tank.
Small problem, there are few if any service shops certified by the
Environmental Protection Agency to convert latest models to “flex” fuel for the
natural gas/gasoline combination. Though we can be quick to fault our political
leaders on energy policy, we think our government has tried on natural gas
vehicles, but there has been little public support. Perhaps it is time to gear
up again - with the economic incentives higher.

Here is something I wrote to a friend about GOOG and MSFT (mostly unedited):

I am afraid that GOOG is going the path of diworseification (like MSFT btw).
I.e. they have a cash cow. Then they try to grow in other areas. And they throw
billions into them with almost zero return. Both MSFT and GOOG are doing this.
And this is not good for shareholders. Right now MSFT is much more attractive
than GOOG valuation wise (GOOG was higher when this was written). And BTW,
MSFTs earnings have grown faster than GOOGs in the last year (there are some
special items, not sure how important they are). Google is now growing only at
20% and their ROE also is pretty low (perhaps due to cash pile). Macro-wise
GOOG owns advertising on the net. MSFT still owns PC OS and Office and some
business segments.

WM - just because value folks hold the stock does not mean it will do well. I
think the preferred is much much better than the common stock. The prognosis
for bank with a junk debt rating is typically not good. The bet with the
preferred would be that if they raise more capital (which would be extremely
dilutive because there is a provision for the hedge fund owner that helped to

GPS / GRMN - the cost of GPS chips is very low now, so there will be a large
competition from cell phone makers. Look at cheapo point-and-shoot cameras -
cell phone makers pretty much took that market and it's gone. So there are two
things GRMN can do. First, it could try to compete in the low end. IMHO
nuvifone is a wrong approach for that though, since it's very hard to get into
cell phone market (iPhone is an exception). However, GRMN could go for low-end
GPS devices that without phone functionality. It still may be competitive for
some time while GPS phones are expensive. Second, GRMN can still compete in the
auto market where cell phones will suck for foreseeable future. Auto GPS needs
to have larger displays than most phones will have. Just audio directions are
usually not sufficient.

So IMHO, GRMN still has some good possibilities and directions. I would not
discard it as "has been" here. On the other hand, unless it manages to get into
low end devices and cover developing country needs, it will have hard time
growing a lot.

Hi Jurgis -

What's your price expectation for GLW? I have a pretty large position that I
acquired in 2002. I peeled off a few shares recently to cover my original cost
but continue to hold the rest.

The company has four major operating divisions: Display Technologies,
Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, and Life Sciences. Most people
are only aware of their big two: (1) Telecommunications (fibre optics) and (2)
Display (LCDs).

GLW has several hidden jewels in their "Other" operating divisions and one
through an outside (JV) investment w/ Dow Corning.

GLW owns a 32% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. a JV w/ Dow Corning,
Mitsubishi and Shin-Etsu Chemical Corp..
(http://www.hscpoly.com/About%20Hsc/Ownership/hsc_ownership.htm).. HSC is the
world's largest maker of polycrystalline silicon, an ultra-pure rock-like
material used in solar panels and semiconductor chips. The demand for silicon
is growing at about 35 to 45 percent annually. HSC makes 14,500 metric tons of
silicon annually now. This is a picture of their new $1.3 Billion expansion
plant that will increase their production to 36,000 metric tons/year.
(http://www.mlive.com/businessreview/tricities/index.ssf/2008/05/hemlock_semico
ductor_project.html ). Today HSC announced the finalist for their next
expansion plant. This was a surprise to me since they just completed the one
shown above. UPDATE: Hemlock Semiconductor confirms Clarksville, Tenn., a
finalist for next expansion
(http://www.mlive.com/saginawnews/business/index.ssf/2008/07/update_hemlock_sem
conductor_c.html ).

Another hidden jewel is a product manufactured in their Environmental
Technology division. It is their new diesel catalyst filter. Sales have doubled
from 2006 to 2007 ($260 million) which represents 5% of GLW's total 2007 annual
revenues. Their new diesel filters were released in Europe in the beginning
2007 and will be available in the U.S. starting in September 2008. Their new
diesel catalyst filter meets or exceeds all of the new 2008 U.S. EPA
requirements. Revenues from this product could double again in 2008 as
manufactures are required to use this product in all new US diesel vehicles.

The little filter that could
http://www.mpnnow.com/archive/x1743991648/The-little-filter-that-could

From the article:"...Between the Jetta’s diesel-engine exhaust and the outside
world sits the DuraTrapAT diesel filter, Corning’s aluminum titanate ceramic
catalyst created for diesel VWs. Hundreds of thousands of VW’s with the Corning
DuraTrapAT are already on the road in Europe and elsewhere. They arrive on the
U.S. market in September.

Corning Inc.’s filter removes 99% of a diesel’s excess carbon soot from the
exhaust, making Jetta emissions cleaner than some gasoline vehicles.

Corning’s ceramic diesel exhaust filters may not seem very high-tech, but it
generates great black ink on company balance sheets. Net diesel product sales,
including heavy truck diesel filters, rose to $249 million in 2007 from $164
million in 2006...."

The last hidden jewel GLW has are their many patents. These include several in
the Fibre Optic area and recently new patents received from research done at
their Life Sciences Division.
(http://www.dddmag.com/news-Patent-Corning-Epic-System.aspx). If their new
Epic-System (developed in their Life Science Division) is adopted as a standard
"industry practice" by the main drug companies, this product could generate a
significant stream of new revenues.

My long term minimum price target for GLW is $34.00/share. I have owned this
stock for six years and continue to hold. There are many new products in the
pipeline that should contribute to their core sales generated from their
Display Technologies & Telecommunications Divisions. There should be at least
another 36 months of double digit sales growth which should support a high teen
PE.

The forward PE of 10 is too low IMO. Based on a 17 PE and $2.00/share 2009 EPS
estimate, GLW would be fairly valued at $34/share.

WM 7 others - naked shorts -
My personal opinion is that naked shortsellers are not the main problem, they
are a sideshow. I have yet to see a solid company that went down the drain
because of shortselling - naked or with cloth on <g>.

As far as WM is concerned, if they really do have enough capital (as they claim
they have) what could shortsellers really accomplish other than hurting
themselves? If they drive the price too low smart folks will gobble up the
shares on the cheap and will make a mint. If a company has excess capital (like
many claim they have) they could buy back their own shares and create value for
their shareholders - again i do not see a problem.

The real problem is that those companies are weak and management has being
lying through their teeth as far as the financial condition is concerned at
least in some cases -in others they were simply inept.The former case is
balance sheet fraught and should be rewarded with jail time. That is the case
that the SEC should concentrate on. The naked shortseller debate is the
smokescreen that confounds the real ailments.

Although I believe like you that naked shortsellers in general are not an
issue, I would disagree that they cannot get a company BK. If a company is
leveraged, it is completely possible to get it to violate the loan covenants by
pushing its share price below certain levels. Now, again in general this does
not have to lead to BK, but in current situation when banks are scared and
credit is hard to come by, things are different.

Sure, you can argue that companies should not be heavily leveraged and I agree
with that. But some of them are, like banks or BDCs or homebuilders and for
them such situation is very risky.

So IMHO, 99% of cries for naked shortseller blood is nonsense, but there is
that 1% when it's justified.

E_K_S,

GLW: For most of the stocks I buy, I don't have a price expectation. I hold
them while they offer a reasonable expected rate of return and sell if/when
they no longer do (or there is significant business deterioration) Right now,
IMHO GLW offers significant opportunity. It is a bit tough to evaluate, since
they have one time gains both in Q1 and Q2. But even by taking the non-GAAP
earnings number before extraordinary gains, it is IMHO quite undervalued.

There may be some psychological selling pressure next year when YoY numbers
will look bad because of lack of one time gains. Of course, with all the side
ventures, there may be other "one time" gains too. :)

Thanks for the information about Hemlock and filters. Unfortunately US has very
few passenger diesels for sale (not counting trucks). I thought about buying
one, but the only available was VW and VW had too many problems in last couple
years for my liking. :( Not that this will affect GLW filter business. :)

Hi Madharry - What's the symbol for the WM preferred? Is this the one
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WM-PR . There appears to be a Series T and Series
S preferred. I do not like the mandatory conversion option. What prevents them
from a mandatory conversion at the $8.75/share value when the market price is
$5.00/share ? Is the pegged conversion rate changed by the company each six
month anniversary?

Other than the interest rate, were there other specific terms of the deal that
attracted you? Do you like the Preferred Series "S" or "T" better?

http://www.secinfo.com/d16VAy.t5p.htm
The Series T Preferred Stock is mandatorily convertible into shares of common
stock on the final day of any calendar quarter in which the Company and/or the
holders of Preferred Stock receive the following approvals: (i) the approval by
the holders of the Company’s common stock of (A) the conversion of the
Preferred Stock into common stock as required by the applicable NYSE rules, and
(B) amendment to the Company’s Restated and Amended Articles of Incorporation
to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to permit the full
conversion of the Preferred Stock into common stock, and (ii) the expiration or
termination of any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 or the competition or merger control laws of other
jurisdictions. The Series S Preferred Stock is mandatorily convertible upon
receipt of the shareholder approvals described above. The Preferred Stock is
initially convertible to shares of common stock at a rate of $8.75 per share of
common stock; provided, however, such conversion price shall be reduced by
$0.50, subject to a maximum reduction of $2.00, on each six-month anniversary
of the original issue date if the shareholder approval described above has not
been obtained.

Dividends on the Preferred Stock are payable, on a non-cumulative basis, as and
if declared by the Company’s board of directors, in cash, on an as-converted
basis. If the Preferred Stock has not been converted into shares of common
stock by June 30, 2008, dividends will be payable commencing with the dividend
payment date on September 15, 2008 at a rate of 14% of the liquidation
preference of the Preferred Stock and this rate will further increase to 15.5%
of the liquidation preference commencing with the dividend payment date on
March 15, 2009 and to 17% of the liquidation preference commencing with the
dividend payment date on September 15, 2009. However, dividends on the
Preferred Stock will always be paid at the higher of the amount payable in
accordance with the applicable percentage rate described above and the dividend
payable on an as-converted basis. The Company is prohibited from paying any
dividend with respect to shares of common stock unless full dividends are paid
on the Preferred Stock. The Company is also prohibited from repurchasing or
redeeming shares of its common stock or other junior securities, subject to
certain exceptions, while any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding.

Too confusing to me, jayt.

I don't see reits as all of the same piece: Hotel reits, mortgage reits, mall
reits -- they're different business with different outlooks, imo. Even if they
share the similarity that they're all down in price -g-.

I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to do. Waiting to be a buyer of
CBG, being too late (for shorting??) others?

I defer to other people here who follow specific reits more closely than I do,
especially as regards ffo/affo and relationships to price and/or book value. As
far as domestic reits, I'm holding on as best I can, with my downtrodden
commercial mortgage reits, hotel reits, commercial property reits. As of right
now, only reit I am adding to is FR as it continues to fall.

==========================
Not sure if this applies; I'll make these comments though:

There's some leap of faith or logic or something that I don't make that many
others do:

1. Value investors presumably try to select undervalued stocks and sell them
when they become near full/fair value.

2 Value investors should thus be able to identify fully-valued or overvalued
stocks when they see such.

3. Which are stocks they could/should sell short and buy back at lower prices.
- - - -
My opinion is that value investors don't make much from shorting. Either they
can't correctly identify the proper candidates or they don't have the proper
mental attitudes for success. Or maybe for a combination of those reasons.
Short-selling overvalued stocks is not the same as buying undervalued stocks -
imo. As I have said, shorting is like walking backwards - seems like it should
be easy enough, just the reverse of walking forwards, but it is not.

Anyway, my opinion is that expecting good short sale candidates from value
investors doesn't seem to work out as satisfactorily as one might expect. (Of
course, that is jmo and my experience. Others may disagree, maybe strongly.)

This is what I thought I owned:

SECURITY DESCRIPTION: Washington Mutual Inc., 7.75% Series R Non-Cumulative
Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, liquidation preference $1000 per share,
and with no stated maturity. Non-cumulative distributions of 7.75% ($77.50) per
annum are paid quarterly on 3/15, 6/15, 9/15 & 12/15 to holders of record on
the record date which is the first day of the month in which the payment is due
(NOTE: the ex-dividend date is at least 2 business days prior to the record
date). Dividends paid by the preferred are eligible for the 15% tax rate on
dividends under normal holding restrictions and are also eligible for the
dividends received deduction for corporate holders (see page S-50 of the
prospectus for further information). The preferred shares are convertible any
time at the holder's option into 47.0535 common shares of Washington Mutual
Inc. (NYSE: WM), an initial conversion price of $21.25 per common share. On or
after 12/18/2012, if the price of the common stock exceeds 130% of the
conversion price for 20 of any 30 consecutive trading days, the company may, at
their option, force the preferred shares to be converted into common shares at
the then prevailing conversion price. In regard to the payment of dividends and
upon liquidation, the preferred shares rank equally with other preferreds and
senior to the common shares of the company. See the IPO prospectus for further
information on the convertible preferred stock and the conversion provisions by
clicking on the ‘Link to IPO Prospectus’ provided below.

I admit i did not read any furthur but it sounds to me like the price has to
exceed $30 before conversion can be forced.

google "Charlie Silk 150 bagger". :) Their company seems to be doing fine now
investing in the small cap "cash net nets" with some twists. He looks for small
or no debt (even with net net), small to no cash burn rate, high gross margins,
52 week lows. They do buy some companies up to 2.0 x net depending on the
business.

Anyway, here's couple of his current holdings or "interesting" tickers: RVSN,
SPRT, OTIV, BEBE and KSWS.

RVSN is a true cash net net if we don't dig into their ARS holdings. Great
gross margins, but the rest sucks IMO. It's very hard for me to tell if they
can have traction in this videoconferencing business. IMHO, there's a lot of
companies who tried this and very few succeeded or made money. I may be wrong
though and I don't have in depth knowledge about their offering.

SPRT - 1.5 book or somewhere there. Possibly could become profitable soon but
tough to say what's their story from a first glance.

OTIV - might be interesting. There is some goodwill and intangibles that need
to be accounted. They were barely cash-flow positive last Q. Dilution and stock
compensation are somewhat high.

BEBE is 2xbook right now (Q4 not reported yet). Too expensive for me IMO.

KSWS is almost at book now, but their margins (before extraordinary items in
H1) are much worse than BEBE. I am not very interested.

I have no positions in any of these right now.

P.S. Yahoo finance site is being BAD today and not showing income sheets,
balance sheets etc. Any substitute that shows a 3 year history until Yahoo
comes back?

Hi Tandav -

Worst case is that the common becomes worthless. I believe the odds are small
especially after the news today that a huge hedge fund invested $7.2 B in the
common. This type of investment would not have been made even if there was a
low probability of any type of Chapter 7. I suppose this investor also bought
into the bonds and preferred shares to spread out their risk . Perhaps that is
the reason for those "mandatory" call provisions in the Series "S" & "T"
preferred shares which allows the company (or acquirer) to make holders convert
to the common shares. With such a large investment by one investor, their exit
plan might eventually include an acquisition. For now, WM just has a very large
"foreign" partner that owns at least 6% of WM common (they probably own much
more but less than 20%).

Friday, August 1, 2008 - 10:28 AM EDT
U.K. hedge fund buys 6 percent stake in Washington Mutual
http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2008/07/28/daily92.html?ana=yfcp

The best preferred IMO is the series "R" but it continues to sell at a very
deep discount from the original issue, now yielding somewhere near 16%. At this
effective rate, the market is signaling very high risk. The dividend could be
discontinued but is first in line to be paid before the common. It is
non-cumulative so all dividends due (to date) must be paid first before any
common dividends are made.

I like that it is a Perpetual Convertible (convertible any time at the holder's
option) and has no stated maturity. That way if WM can work out their problem
over time, this issue will increase in value. Perhaps getting back to the face
value of $1000 from when it was originally issued on 12/11/07
(http://www.secinfo.com/dr643.uCc.htm ).

Based on the effective yield, your initial investment will be returned in
dividends in 4.8 years. That said, a Chapter 7 would probably make this
worthless less any dividends received.

With all of this in mind, there is a huge value opportunity IF WM survives. I
am willing to take the risk but only for a few units.

Im amazed that you can toss out a figure of 99% of the outcries against naked
short selling are baseless. In my opinion probably over 50% of the posts on
yahoo are by paid bashers who are probably paid by pro short sellers. If I had
billions of dollars of other peoples money I could sell short with gusto too,
and the only fear that I would have would be a buyout. Other wise everything
else is stacked in favor of these naked short sellers. If you think its so
baseless then why did the SEC go to the trouble of grandfathering such illegal
activity to begin with, and even now are saying that they are going to
selectively enforce this for 19 stocks in a universe of 8000 stocks? Is it any
wonder that any time a company goes to market seeking to raise cash by floating
shares, the share price seems to drop 10-15% before they announce their planned
offering. I guess for you that is an unexplained co-incidence. No one
investigates this
insider/wall street abuse either.

You are welcome to think whatever you want. For me, the short sellers can do
only good. If they manage to drive any great company stock down, it's a great
opportunity to buy. Now if someone chooses to invest in crap companies, then
yes, it may be a problem.

For some reason there was no short run on BRK, KO, PEP, NKE or tons of other
well capitalized companies. Heh, there was even no run on WFC and USB which are
banks and are much more susceptible to getting pounded into the ground by short
sellers. Or maybe there was a run, but it failed since these are strong
companies and do not have a problem when someone tries to manipulate their
stock.

Actually, looking at my portfolio, the only stocks someone could argue that
were pounded by shorts are ASFI and ACAS. And, first, I would argue that they
are not that good companies and I should not have bought them. And secondly, I
don't give a hoot if SEC does anything about ASFI and ACAS shorting. If the
companies report good results, shorts will lose. If not, well, then it was my
fault about not doing good analysis and investing into mediocre companies. I
will put no blame on shorts, naked or otherwise.

Now, I am fine if SEC decides to enforce "borrow before short" and brings back
uptick rule again. I won't throw temper tantrums or not sleep at night if they
don't.

Edit: I took a look at
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=24803302&srchtxt=SHO
to see if there were any stocks there that I own. As I guessed ACAS is there.
The only other stocks I own on the list are GRMN, HANS and SDTH. Neither of
them will be shorted to zero in any kind of situation. And I would be very
happy if shorts managed to drive GRMN or HANS down another 20-50%. :) Would be
tremendous buys. :)

This has nothing to do with naked shortselling .If the underwriters would keep
a tight lid on the information about an offering this should and would not
happen. it has long been suspected that the underwriters themselves short the
stock to hedge, but that IMO would be abuse of insider information effectively.

TEL, NYX, WF, KGS -
TEL - i bought back a starter in TEL. Recent earnings were good but outlook
somewhat less so. Nevertheless this TYC spinoff is a good restructuring story..
I think management is strong, cash flow looks strong and the buybacks make
sense.

NYX got squished - i sold 1/2 my position when it ran up over 50$ and think
about buying back.

WF - this is a cheap financial without the problems hampering US banks.
Improved credit ratings and a good earnings report enticed me to buy back a
small starter position.

MLP's are doing good. i sold my KGS on recent runup, grabbed a distribution and
made a mint. This one will have an secondary as well in 1-2 quarters which may
be a great opportunity to get back in. I hold ETE, ETP, WES, WMZ and MGG and

BWP - yes i did sell when It bounced back nicely, for the same reason I sold
KSG. I am taking profits where I can in this environment.

BWP had a decent earning report selling out their capacity as fast as it goes
online. With MLP's I am seeing more secondaries which in conjunction with the
current cash starved environment are good for 10% haircuts and will be good
buying opportunities.

So far all MLP have met my expectations as far as earnings and distributions
are concerned. APL's earnings were terrible, IMO. they operations were doing OK
but a 280M$ realized hedging loss caused by dirty hedges (hedging NGL exposure
with crude and selling them out at a loss when crude peaked) is a disaster. Now
with those hedges gone, APL is much more vulnerable to falling crude or gas
prices. For AHD (APL GP) that is great, since they now get their share from the
additional distributions from the new units. APL for me is a sell, AHD a keeper
at this point although I like ETE and MGG much more. FWIW, I also own MWE which
is a nice MLP with the GP and the MLP wrapped in one so there are no IDR's
(CPNO being the other MLP with the same structure).

I also did follow you into LMC and added of my MSFT and NWS shares.

Hi Paul - I sold my BWP on the run up too. I did not want to deal with the
special K1 tax filings. The 7% gain for one week was not bad either.

The MLPs throw off good income, but as their projects grow, the master partners
(usually the large oil companies and distributors) receive a much larger
percentage of the return than the limited partners. I am a long term value
holder and am willing to take a smaller short term return for the much higher
returns obtained when a new project is developed and eventually generates huge,
consistent long term revenue streams.

I like your theme on the Bakken shale opportunities and have made different
investments in the drillers. Who are the aggregators and pipeline operators
that will benefit from the huge volume of natural gas that needs to be moved
and distributed to the end users? I want to stay away from MLPs if possible.

Here is a small list of companies I have come up with but none are pure plays
or exceptional value buys.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BNI,ENB,TRP,EP&d=s

Perhaps a long shot is Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)
http://www.cheniere.com/default.shtml . The company is selling at a five year
low and is loosing money as a result of the accumulated debt they have on their
books. It is not a direct play for the Bakken shale NG but they do have several
storage LNG terminals that are necessary when the NG is distributed around the
country and throughout the world. In February, the CEO said if the right offer
was put on the table, they may sell the company. Their crown jewel is their
Cheniere Pipeline Company where they own MLP interests.
http://www.forbes.com/2008/03/02/cheniere-energy-closer-markets-commodities-cx_
a_0226markets37.html?partner=yahootix

Any other companies come to mind for natural gas pipeline operators and/or
aggregators in the Bakken shale region where a lot of the new drilling and
exploration is being done?

Okay, regarding Bakken. Here are a few comments relating to my and your picks:

My overarching idea: I want to have several stocks - a package of positions -
in several of the now promising shale plays. Some large stocks - XCO, for
example, are involved in several shale plays. Some of the smaller firms are in
just one. Some of the companies have earnings, some do not. They are not all
value picks. Although I've placed most of my bets on the exploration companies,
I also have bet on the suppliers and transporters. Such as HAL for horizontal
drilling, BWP for pipelines.

Regarding just Bakken and the stocks you mentioned, I hold ENB also. I see now
according to its website, ENB says they will, or hope to, benefit from the
Bakken development. You've mentioned Mr. Buffett's the BNSF (BNI). Positive
article in today's Barron's on railroaders - several mentioned favorably
including BNI. I missed BNI. I have just a few shares of CNI. "Its roughly
20,000 miles of track spans Canada and mid-America, connecting three coasts:
Halifax on the Atlantic, Prince Rupert on the Pacific and cities on the Gulf of
Mexico. By purchasing several short-line rails, CNI has gained access to better
serve the tantalizing Alberta oil sands region."

As regards, "Who are the aggregators and pipeline operators that will benefit
from the huge volume of natural gas that needs to be moved and distributed to
the end users? I want to stay away from MLPs if possible.", my favorite by far
is MDU.
MDU supplies electricity, cement, construction expertise, pipelines. And they
have a subsidiary - Fidelity Exploration & Production Company - which is active
in the Bakken. (I'm not a buyer of MDU here at current price. And just because
it's my favorite, doesn't mean I have an overly large position in the stock.
Often my favorites going in, turn out to be my worst performers.) MDU is
classified as a utility, so I don't expect a lot from it. I expect it'll be
okay for me though.

Crescent Point I also like. That Canadian trust has Bakken exposure and is
increasing it's build out, and has also increased its dividend. (.23/sh is
about $2.34 annualized after the 15% Canadian withholding on a stock going for
$34.23.) Not a great yield, but that's the offset I presume for an
investor/speculator buying into the trust's possibly very good Bakken future:

http://www.crescentpointenergy.com/documents/news/CPG-2008-06-16.pdf

Worth it to me anyway to take the dividend and hold on to see what happens to
their Bakken holdings.

Here is a list (in no particular order) of stocks that I classify as my package
of Bakken-Williston oil/gas stocks. I have shares in each company in this list.
In varying $$ amounts. (Fewer $$ bet on the smaller stuff.):

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PBEGF.PK,TOGSF.PK,CPGCF.PK,WLL,ERF,TLM,MDU,CLR,TEC

Thanks for the info. I also found MDU in my search. They have a pipeline and
energy service subsidiary called WBI Holdings http://www.wbiholdings.com/ .
They will be completing a new pipeline in the region which should come online
in 2010.

Here is a pretty good article that mentions WBI Holdings.
http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2008/05/20/news/state/155935.txt

From the article:"...A Bismarck company is planning a 100-mile-long pipeline to
carry natural gas from the Bakken shale formation in North Dakota and Montana
to an existing pipeline that moves the gas to Chicago.

Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co., a unit of MDU Resources Group Inc.,
hopes to have the pipeline completed in mid-2010, said Tim Rasmussen, a company
spokesman...."

The balance sheet for MDU looks solid with good free flow cash flow
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=MDU . They have several different business
operations that could benefit from the new build out in this region. The
company is near its all time high and reports earnings next week. PE is around
13 and their dividend is small at 1.8%. This is one worth watching and I may
pick up a starter position if their earnings report is positive.

Buffet was pretty smart in both his BNI and Conoco buys. In 1988 Burlington
Resources was spun out from Burlington Northern Railroad Company (now BNI).
Burlington Resources bought Poco Petroleum in 1999 Canadian Hunter Exploration
in 2001 and a few other foreign natural resource companies in 2002. In 2006
ConocoPhillips buys Burlington Resources which is now one of Buffets largest
holdings along with BNI.

I wonder if there will be so much natural gas produced in the Bakken region
that they will eventually transport LNG by rail (using BNI trunk lines). If our
nation converts to NG to fuel our auto and truck fleets, distribution by LNG
rail would be the most cost effective method.

A few comment regarding MLP's

You stated:

The MLPs throw off good income, but as their projects grow, the master partners
(usually the large oil companies and distributors) receive a much larger
percentage of the return than the limited partners. 

Not correct. the general partner can receive up to 50% of the incremental cash
flow once the distribution of the MLP exceeds the maximum split. So the general
partner can never take the majority of the profits, at most 50% and even that
is possible only once the distribution exceeds the maximum split by far.

if you do not like the fact that MLP's are taxed by IDR's there are 2 ways to
avoid that:

1) By into an MLP that just IPO'd. those start up in the lowest split and only
if the GP manages to bumb up the distribution/unit significantly he will
receive an increasing share of the cash flow

2) Invest into the GP itself and take advantage of the growth dynamics of
MLP's. Many choices here: AHD, ETE, EPE, MGG, BGH etc.

MLP's are not for everybody - there is a minimum investment required to make
the tax hassle worthwhile. But over time, these MLP's earn 7-8% (and sometimes
more) distribution yield, which is mostly return of capital, so not taxed and
manage to increase their distributions in the low single digits. So an overall
LT return in the 15% range is possible without any stretch of imagination.
Those returns i think will beat the S&P500.
