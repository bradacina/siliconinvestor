CIT -

 Would long CIT-PA but short CIT common be a good play here? 
That's certainly one way to play it. There is also another prefered (mandatory
convertible) CIT-PZ which will convert at 0.71X per preferred or less if the
stock is above a certain threshold) which may be better suited. Also I think a
straight buy of CIT-XX is reasonable, considering that those would recover some
value even in case of a bankruptcy. Both are better risk reward than the common
stock, IMO.

I am glad i dodged this bullet and sell my stock a while ago. I never thought
it would get this far in August 2007, but here we are CIT diverse funding
sources are down to 1 -drawing down the entire credit lines. that said, I don't
think they are likely to default but they are now shut out of commercial paper
(nobody with a sane mind would buy it_, and securitization will be much more
difficult. They will have to sell assets down to stay afloat and/or raise new
capital.

If a fraction of the "trillions of counterparty risk" is insolvent, better to

is too big for the FED to solve and the dollar will continue to take a severe
pounding as the FED attempts to throw money at wall street.

On another note, I hear that the former managers of LTCM (bankrupt in 98?) are
now in trouble in there new venture. Maybe its time for the FED to bail them
out too.

Unfortunately, the standard of living adjustment for the majority of people in

Alon USA Energy Chairman Buys Shares

Alon USA Energy Executive Chairman David Wiessman Buys 20,000 Shares of Common
Stock

NEW YORK (AP) -- The executive chairman of oil refiner Alon USA Energy Inc.
bought 20,000 shares of common stock, according to a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
In a Form 4 filed with the SEC Thursday, David Wiessman reported buying the
shares on Tuesday and Wednesday for $13.01 to $13.65 apiece.

Insiders file Form 4s with the SEC to report transactions in their companies'
shares. Open market purchases and sales must be reported within two business

I added to PBR yesterday. My thesis right now is to add to oil and gas

avoid refiners. I am not sure about the drillers and such, I think I will
mostly avoid them too. I still believe that oil prices will rise from here.

I sold MDC. Although it seems that all hommies are now going with option
reprising, at least TOL did the reprising on much less favorable terms to the
employees and excluded CEO plus couple of top executives from reprising. MDC
just reprised options for everyone. I voted against it and then voted again by
selling my shares. I am getting outraged again by executive compensation and
the hollow rhetoric of self-serving BODs that talk about option repricing as a
way to retain employees during one of the worst downturns in the hommie
history. Where would those employees go? To other companies that are firing
their own staff left and right? Of course, they also reprise their own -

The current stock yields 18%. If they they take in money by issuing new stock,
they must figure - I would presume - that they can make more than the 18%
they'll have to pay out on those new shares (assuming they maintain current
dividend). I find that a stretch at least, and corporate desperation at worst.

A staid old fashioned banker with credibility would have been better, but i

bet on the recovery of the financial sector, if you are so inclined.

Once the subprime problem is gone (all loans are written off close to zero)
there is still the big risk that the problems seep in the much larger sector of
prime mortgages. With home prices sinking 10% in 12month there is likely bombs
in the sector that i have not seen going off yet - all mortgages with vintages
of 2004 or later and <20% downpayment are potentially under water. in my
opinion a mortgage that is under water is not much better than subprime. if
anything there will be a nice cottage industry of layers and mortgage
professionals offering "help" to all those unlucky homeowners whose equity has
eroded away due to lower housing prices and who now want out. That of course is
not a problem specific to C but rather to anybody holding mortgage papers.

Well maybe people can move out of their homes with no penalty, but they've got

who've skipped. Although this next home they'd be getting might've come down in
price, this time I will expect they will have to put up a bunch of downpayment
before someone would be willing to lend them money. One hopes anyway that
lenders are now protecting themselves from such deadbeats.

I'm not understanding how people who've bought a house to live in for their
family, consider drops in house prices. So the house drops in value. They
need/wanted that house, they have money for the mortgage - for me, I assume
they would continue to pay. People buy cars, they depreciate right off the

sombody buys an $800,000 house with no money down. they are paying $48000 in
interest alone. if the price of the house drops by 20%, they have now lost
$160,000 with no upturn in sight. why should they not turn the keys back to the
bank, walk across the street and buy a house from some motivated seller, or
better yet rent with an option to buy. now they can potentially own a
comparable house for $640,000 and probably save about 20% by renting vs. paying
interest on the overvalued house. Of course they may also have been living
finance free in the house for a couple of years until the foreclosure process
is completed. some people like paulson might call it reneging other people
might call it sound business practice. I pretty sure the homebuilders will take
a chance on such people especially if they are now willing to put money down.
Thats why I think the financials have not stopped going down yet. I also wonder
how the fed is going to treat mortgage collateral that is in default. do they
return it to the lender for collection? get substitute collateral that hasn t
defaulted or do they pretend that its still AAA paper? interesting.

Like Paul said there are couple reasons:

- they hate to move
- they have invested in a house (furniture, remodeling, whatever)
- they have kids who will scream not to move to another school
- they will not get a loan for another house after foreclosing on the old one
- they will hate to go through the process of foreclosure

There are a lot of things, but people who buy $800K houses don't necessarily
like to move out just to win $160K. Although there are different fish in the

Well maybe people can move out of their homes with no penalty, but they've got
to live somewhere. 
Most will rent first and have to go through credit repair. It will take
probably 2 years before they are creditworthy enough to be considered for a
mortgage 9if they work their credit report agressively)

 Getting back in to a home will be more difficult for people who've skipped.
Although this next home they'd be getting might've come down in price, this
time I will expect they will have to put up a bunch of downpayment before
someone would be willing to lend them money. 

Maybe yes, maybe now. We are very likely going to have a democratic government
that will be very friendly to people who "lost their homes" or who "wanted to
loose their homes'. Who going to tell the difference, especially if there are
many of them?

It would be stupid to underestimate American ingenuity on that matter. If it
makes financial sense, people will stick it to the lenders. there will be an
army of lawyers and RE professionals out there to help them, just as there was
and army of mortgage brokers that got them into houses they could not afford.

I think the likelihood of this scenario to happen is substantial and I do not
think that the ramification of this are baked in any of the forecast for banks,
mortgage insurers or FNM and FRE. If housing prices continue to go down, the
losses from "prime" mortgages will pale those from subprime.

I agree with you. But nobody likes to be in a losing position.

Watching the CCU dealings with the banks regarding the LBO and financing. Per
CCU's legal complaint, it appears that the banks are trying to get out of their
obligations because they would have to take a mark-to-market loss on debt to be
issued (even if there is no default on the debt, which to me sounds absurd). I
view this as little different than homeowners walking away from a house. This

Hi Keith - I agree with you that there needs to be better balance sheet
transparency and standard conservative valuation methods that banks, hedge
funds and private equity companies must follow so investors can better evaluate
the risk and potential returns. It's very hard to evaluate the true market
value (or fair value) of many of these deals especially if several of the
acquired assets are marked to market based on unrealistic valuation
assumptions.

Maybe it's time to update the current GAAP accounting standards with a set of
new conservative "valuation" methodologies that work better for the current
environment.

It seems to me that on the flip side, corporations should book the "market
value" gain on their owned real estate assets as presently it is accounted for
at cost not market value. Commercial & Investment banks, Private lenders, REITs
and companies that own a lot of real estate and debt issues, need to break down
each asset valuation in more detail.

I own an REIT that now reports to shareholders three different numbers for
"possible" assets valuations; book value, economic value and market value.
Their can be as much as a 200% difference in the numbers they provide
especially when the new FAS 159 accounting standard is used
(http://thecaq.aicpa.org/Resources/Accounting/FAS+159+Early+Adoption+Date+Appro
ching+%E2%80%93+Factors+to+Consider.htm ).

It's the complexity of the structured deals (ie derrivative hedging, cross
asset collaterization and SUV products) that creates this wide spread. Many
times the seller and/or buyer will present their own valuation model to support
their argument which just seems to further confuse the process.

I guess the best advise is for the buyer to beware and only invest amounts that
you can afford to lose. As a value investor, many times there are investment
opportunities that arise out of market uncertainty that appear to me to be
significantly undervalued. Over time the market valuation will eventually move
back to some "fair value" which is much higher than the current market price.
However, it's almost a coin flip now on how to calculate a conservative "fair
value" number on many of these new debt issues.

I think thats an individual decision everyone has to make for themselves. But
in trying to put myself in someone elses shoes; if it comes down to a choice
between absorbing a $100,000 hit to net worth, that is avoidable, or saddling a
child with a $100,000 in student loans, or having that xtra $100,000 to support
elderly parents who have exhausted their means. How can you tell me which
decision is morally correct? I believe that there are many many middle class
people who have bitten off more than they can chew.
People who are affluent are not going to go through the turmoil and hassle of
moving their families and belongings for a decline in their net worth that is

What about the value of ones word. If you agree to borrow money for any reason,
one should make every attempt to pay it back regardless of whether they can
legally walk away from their commitment or not.

Just because the States have a lottery, doesn't make it the morally right thing

Chinese pharma stocks are actually pretty interesting from growth perspective.
CHME just reported earnings which jumped up also pushing its book value. The
stock also responded nicely.

At this time I hold some AOB, CHME and LTUS. I think all of them are cheap. AOB
has the best margins and the biggest size. CHME is arguably cheapest although
LTUS has not reported 2007 earnings yet.

The issues going forward are mostly the same that I mentioned before: reliance
on unproven "Chinese medicine" compounds, stricter regulation, more
competition, more distribution business with lower margins, share dilution -
all of these companies issue shares or convertibles for growth, shady sales to
related parties. LTUS had some financial report restatement for last years,
although it was possibly immaterial and more of a mistake than a fraud.

The positives is growing Chinese pharma market, improving health care situation
across China, and management incentives to grow the companies.

IMHO, the shares are cheap with huge Chinese selloff and may offer a good entry
point for value investors.

Went Long Ameron - AMN at 89.90

Company earnings report disappointed Wall St on Weds.
However they raised their dividend by 20%.

Forward P/E = 11.4
P/S = 1.36

Blurb from Street.Com on March 27

Ameron AMN manufactures highly engineered products and materials for the
chemical, industrial, energy, transportation and infrastructure markets
worldwide. Products include high-performance coatings and surfacer systems for
the preservation of structures, molded fiberglass pipe and fittings and
ready-mix concrete. The company has plants in Arkansas, California, Oklahoma,
Texas and Washington -- and through subsidiaries in Australia, Colombia,
Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and Singapore.

Ameron has been rated a buy since June 2005. On March 26, the company reported
solid results for the first quarter of 2008. Net income was reported as $9.7
million, representing a 15% increase year over year. Earnings per share
increased 14%, and sales totaled $149.8 million in the first quarter, which
represented an increase of 24%. The earnings improvement was driven by
continued growth of the Fiberglass-Composite Pipe Group and the ready-mix
concrete and aggregates business in Hawaii.

The company's chairman and CEO announced that the results for the first quarter
represent a positive start for fiscal year 2008. The quarterly earnings results
were in line with the company's expectations. Management continues to expect
solid operating results in 2008, and despite uncertainty regarding the
direction of the economy, the company is optimistic about its prospects for
growth. Bear in mind, however, that the building products industry's
performance is cyclical, depending on the overall health of the U.S. economy.
The state of the housing and auto markets in particular could impact this
industry and, therefore, this stock.

Ameron International Corp.(AMN) 3/26/08

posted a 15% year-over-year rise in fiscal first-quarter
earnings, but the results fell short of Wall Street expectations,
sending shares tumbling 21%.

The Pasadena, Calif., industrial-products maker said Wednesday its
first-quarter net income rose to $9.74 million or $1.07 a share,
from $8.47 million, or 94 cents, in the prior-year period,
bolstered by results from the company's Fiberglass-Composite
Pipe group and the concrete and aggregates business in Hawaii.

The two analysts polled by Thomson Financial expected
first-quarter per-share earnings of $1.15 to $1.44.

Ameron shares were recently down $25.45, or 21%, at $97.34,
after falling as low as $91.98, the stock's lowest level in
more than a month.

"There is some uncertainty regarding the direction of the
economy, but we expect solid operating results in 2008," said
Ameron Chairman and Chief Executive James S. Marlen, in a press
release. "Long term, I remain quite optimistic regarding the
company's growth prospects and performance."

Sales for the period rose 24% to $149.8 million from $120.4
million a year earlier, while analysts expected revenue of
$137.5 million to $139.3 million.

Ameron International's Big Let Down
Carl Gutierrez, Forbes 03.26.08, 3:35 PM ET

Weeks of high hopes for Ameron International went up in smoke
after the manufacturer gave a weaker-than-expected quarterly
report Wednesday.

For the quarter the Ameron International (AMN) reported a 24.4%
gain in sales to $149.8 million from $120.4 million reported
in last year's corresponding quarter. Ameron's earnings also
enjoyed a healthy jump of 14.1% to $9.7 million, or $1.07 per
share, from $8.5 million, or 94 cents per share, reported later year.

While the quarter's sales were a good beat ahead of Wall Street's
forecast of $138.7 million, its earnings fell short of the
Street's $11.8 million, or $1.30 per share. The market didn't
take the news well though and sent the Pasadena, Calif.-based
company's shares tanking 24.6%, or $30.69, to $92.10, in
afternoon trading.

Ameron makes products and materials for the chemical, industrial,
energy, transportation and infrastructure markets.

One industry analyst, who requested anonymity, felt the drop in
stock was too severe, though, and speculated much of the plunge
was simply due to the stocks run-up ahead of the announcement.
Prior to Wednesday's drop, Ameron's shares have risen 11.3%
since the beginning of March, and 33.3% since the beginning of
the year. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index risen 1.1% since the
beginning of the month, and dropped 8.6% since the beginning
of 2008.

Looking at the quarter's earnings, the analyst noted that quarterly
figures for the company will be volatile, and advised investors
to instead look at the company's performance on an annual basis.
"They've consistently done well in that respect," the analyst said.

If one is better off walking away than sucking it up and paying a mortgage on a

The government bails out investment banks when they commit errors of judgement,
while profits are privatized. A politician can leave office after having made
costly errors with no personal liability. A CEO can screw up a company and
destroy shareholder value and get a $100MM termination bonus and a pension. A
popular music star can drunkenly crash into a utility pole, yet escape jail and
be applauded for her "bravery" in rehab. A murderer is freed because his skin

All of these things are tolerated and condoned in the twilight of our culture,

Hi Paul - When evaluating your GM investment, what is your expected holding
period? Looking at the recent option activity for GM implies that there is
still expectations for a wide variance (over 45%) in the price (+/- $8/share)
over the next 12 month period.

I am bullish long term for GM (>60 months) as they have significant
opportunities for growth in China and India. The stock will eventually turn
higher once future expectations discount the worst case for GM. I am not quite
sure we are there yet but do plan to add to my current position when we
eventually get there.

I think the value investor must look at holding longer (years) than shorter
(months) in order to recognize the potential gains for GM.

=================================================

The current returns on money market and other fixed income investments are
getting so low now, that I am looking at deploying more money into undervalued
equities and income producing Trusts. If the current dividend holds for GM, the
current return looks quite attractive compared to my treasury yields.

At this point in the cycle, I am looking at increasing my Canadian Energy Trust
positions (my favorites are PWE & ERF) as I can lock in 4x's the monthly income
than with my GNMA's and Treasury positions. My plan is to begin to peel off
gains from these conservative fixed income holdings and deploy these funds into
(1) Energy Trusts to produce an equivalent monthly cash flow (about 25% of the
funds) and (2) use the other 75% of the proceeds to begin building new
positions in undervalued equities that I can harvest in 3-5 years.

This is a transition process rather than an "all or none" trade. GM is
certainly one candidate that fits my equity pick criteria. Other include, HD,
BMY, SGP, INTC (raised their dividend last week to 2.7%),CMCSA & MSFT. I do
favor energy and pipe line special situations but also would like to increase
my exposure to international companies particularly those located in Brazil.
However at this time, the deep value plays seem to be in the domestic mid-cap
companies.

technical analysis would have triggered a sell in the mid 30s, perhaps a very
weak buy in the 20s followed quickly by a solid sell in the 20s and no
subsequent buys. The PR release announcing slashing of the dividend in order to
deploy the capital doesnt seem very honest to me. Makes me suspicious as to
whether this is yet another case of a big shareholder aware of undisclosed

Pretty hard, maybe near impossible, to beat the Toyota Production System.
Apparently though, TM has faltered (lost some reputation for solid quality) as
they've too quickly expanded and increased production through world-wide
facilities. TM has a wide diversity of auto products; Honda not so much so, but
is very strong in engine development (except for V-8's). I like Honda's
possibilities in aircraft manufacturing. Both HMC and TM at about the same p/e;
HMC with a higher p/sales number. Way higher than GM. Deservedly higher, but
imo, makes GM a better buy if GM can muddle through with attractive new
product, some decent initial quality and maybe then some better (lower)
depreciation rates for their vehicles. At GM's current and lower stock price,
their offloading of health care costs, their demonstrated Cadillac resurgence,
I'm willing to place a bet on them.

given the fragility of these markets i think you are really taking a risk
playing for an end of quarter bounce. I think it's at least as likely to have
an unanticipated drop. the best thing that happen to the market now would be
that it doesnt drop on more bad news, which would mean that the sellers have
been washed out for the most part. However I dont think that is likely because
of the deleveraging that seems almost constant which will continue to drop
portfolios that are on margin increasing selling pressure. On top of that there
will be people who find that they can no longer borrow on their home equity
lines, the credit card rates are skyrocketing and they will start liquidating
retirement portfolios to make ends meet. add to that the uncertainty of a
clinton/obama candidacy- and there are ample reasons not to be long us dollar
related stocks. Sadly, we are caught in that stage of empire deterioration
where the govt is forced to debase the currency, savvy investors are fleeing
with their capital, and our politicians are taking up the fiddle. How long
before we see prices being changed on a weekly basis to reflect the continued
decline of the dollar? Perhaps we should have a pool to determine how many

I read Whitney Tilson's T-2 Partners presentation of the Mortgage and Credit
markets that made the case for being in the early innings of the mortgage
credit fiasco. http://www.valueinvestingcongress.com/tilson_presentation.php
It's a lengthy set of slides that paint a pretty scary picture of problems yet
to come, with most of the resets on liar and ninja loans still to come.
Tilson's hedge fund is short the banks and bond insurers.

I sent that presentation to a friend who has a vast network of folks in the
banking industry. He went thru the Tilson presentation and agreed it painted a
dark picture. But he said for the last several months, most banks have been
re-working their ARMS mortgages as soon as folks become delinquent -- they want
to get these folks into long term fixed rate mortgages -- anything rather than
going thru the foreclosure process.

Anyway, the negative case is totally out there and has been for some time. But
some of the contrary signals are indicating Buy, as reported in those few
Barrons articles:

Money-mkt cash, for example, is at $3.45 Trillion, vs. 2.2 Trillion at the
market low in March 2003.

US domestic equity funds have seen a record 10 months of net outflows. The
previous record was 8 months, following the 1987 stock market crash.

Conference Board Consumer Expectations Index is at a 17 year low.

Jumping in now may be going for the falling knife, or being somewhat premature,
but the point I was raising is that the volume on some of those shares had
fallen on Friday and still the prices fell. So I was just musing as to how big
an effect it really is when portfolio managers attempt to paint a picture on

the publicly-traded auto retailers, you get geographical diversity; diversity
in product lines (these auto retailers generally having having franchises in
Euro., Japanese, and domestic brands); you don't get the high capital intensive
business of the manufacturers, the health/pension legacy costs of the
domestics; and you do get a business that's not just dependent on new car
sales.

I still hold my positions in shares of several of these.

"GM common is basically an option." That seems about right to me. For me, I'm
willing to make the bet.

EP, SE - within the my theme of of owning pipeline assets I purchased SE.
Similar valuation than EP but SE does not have a gas exploration business.

SE has a better dividend (4% yield at 22.6$ quote) and trades at about 10x
EBITDA. they do not have an exploration business like EP which commands a lower
EBITDA multiple (because of depletion expenses).

FWIW an article here on the risk of pipeline overbuilding:

Not doing well with Time Warner, http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TWX . I'll up my
losing shares just a little now.

The company has many aspects (assets). Imo, too many haven't been adding any
economic value to the corporation. I'd like to see the management team focus on
stockholder value more than on accumulating or maintaining an asset base that
can't provide a return above the cost of capital.

At some point as the stock drops, someone again (as Icahn before) will take a
sizable stock position to attempt to force management to be more proactive ---
I am hoping.

It does look like a negative in-depth presentation. On the other hand Tilson
apparently was negative already after Pershing (I think) had a very negative
presentation on monolines in the fall 2007 value congress. I wonder how much of
his research is just being made to support conviction vs. try to see the other
side of the coin. I wonder if he reads Marty Whitman who is on the other side
of the trade. I wonder what he thinks about Buffett buying more WFC and USB -
doesn't that mean that his investment in BRKA is on the other side of his bank
shorting?

Personally, I would not touch monolines, since they are too dicey and a single
random event may turn tide either way. On the other hand, I think that banks
are good value now although I would follow Buffett just because he has done a
lot of DD and knows the people in business. Of course, buying something like C,
which has fallen a lot more than WFC or USB, may be higher risk and higher
return, but this is where I cannot say whether it's worth it.

To be fair quite a few of "great" value funds hold positions in BRK. For
example http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hl?s=FAIRX

I agree with you that being short in the middle of the crash is a risky
proposition. Mike Burry made money on initial drop and that's great, but now it
is becoming hard to value and predict whether even the riskiest of securities
are heading lower or higher in the future.

its been a tough quarter. I ended up +3.3% but I was up as much as +16% at one
point. In retrospect my biggest mistakes were exiting bzp too early, getting in
too deep with ccrt and not cutting my position when the opportunity presented
itself. the rest of it im pretty much captive to my gold,silver, uranium and
smaller oil and gas plays, and those are mostly denominated in canadian dollars
which have taken a beating of late. Also keystone has been a big loser for me
but I couldnt predict that tie was going to get hammered from over $30 to $15.

I am still looking at AYR. I still dont understand exactly why the company
stock got hammered and why management feels compelled to reduce the dividend.
Its almost as if they could care less about shareholders. are they saying that
70% of book value is right for the stock?

I'm fascinated by Whitman's commitment to the monolines. As if he's willing to
put his storied reputation on the line over his doubling down on the monolines!
I'll go with him for a small position -- Not about to double down!

Last year most of the value gurus like Buffett were lamenting there were few
opportunities out there. Now, it's a tough call to know what inning we're in. A
case can be made for both sides. Regardless of whether Tilson looked at both
sides, those are some unnerving facts he's laid out with respect to how far off
long term trend we are with ratio of house prices/income and that the average
homeowner now holds less than a 50% equity stake.

This leveraging/credit abuse on the part of individuals, hedgies, investment
banks, Fannie and Freddie has been building for many years. People on the Epic
American Credit and Bond Bubble Laboratory Thread here on SI have been in a
constant state of anxiety for years. Do we really think the cycle can turn
around within 6 months, now that is has finally started to unwind? Personally,
I don't think so. But there are several stats out there to indicate room for a
bounce, as mentioned in the Barrons' articles.

When you look at the duration and depth of past bear markets, however, peak to
trough prices don't usually get much beyond 25% -- UNLESS we're talking about
THE BIG ONE. (Sorry, wish I had that table I saw in the past month showing
depth and duration). So if we've already fallen close to 20% as of last month
on major indices, then if you've got a couple years time horizon, some things
are looking OK on a risk/reward basis, for cautiously wading back in.

As for the banks, you're right -- there are some good bets out there. I'm
wondering which ones will survive. You can do worse than following Buffett, as
you indicate. I followed his call in pharmas with SNY and did a moonshot all
the way back down again. But last week I picked up some PFE and will be content
to wait.

Gee this is a tough game when nobody knows the future!

SGP -- HOLY COW! I missed that -- was doing taxes today. 167 million shares
traded today on a 26% drop! I'd call that puke stage capitulation. Going to

that.

Having barely survived the 2000-2002 period, let me say that one of the things
that cost me dearly was my disbelief that the nasdaq having falling by 40%
could fall by 40% again, or that a vaunted blue chip of the techno age like
Nortel covered by dozens of analysts could decline by as much as it did. Trying
to predict a bottom by usual percentage decline can be a very expensive
proposition as we now know that stock market prices do not have normal
distribution curves.

A stock that I do like, which given your area of experience you might want to
take a look at is CRESY, an argentine based company which owns farms and real
estate and is looking to expand in other parts of south america. They recently
raised a bunch of capital from investors and are looking to buy additional
farms now. Im told that the argentinian soil does not require fertilizer so
that I would think that would give them some competitive edge.

How many acres of farmland do they own? Last I checked in on CRESY, the
valuation was ridiculously cheap from an asset perspective. What do you think
of its Argentine relatives, IRS and APSA?
