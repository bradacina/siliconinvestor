Mike (My opinions *only*): Borders, I raised the issue of the 900 mall stores.
Looking for shorts that might be adversely impacted by Net competition...the
mall booksellers looked to be in the target zone. Not just the net, but
superstores, mass-merchants (Best sellers @ discount), and really sharp
independents are pulling biz away from these high-cost, nuthin special mall
booksellers. Considered shorting Borders for this reason at higher levels..but
got distracted by other issues. Borders closed more than they opened last
period...they're going to have to close more IMO and there's gonna be costs
associated with it. This is probably what the street is pricing in. Without
these, if it was just the superstores at present value ratios I'd jump on
Borders bandwagon...the superstores are great.
CEO resignation: They're paying the guy $3 million (according to the release 4
cents a share is the expected hit) just to go away. You kinda get the idea they
considered him a real liability for some reason....

Good post Bob. WOW $3m for CEO to just go away...I wonder if Borders will do an

The Bookstore" was only 1/2 (ok maybe 2/3) silly...but repurposing the
Waldenbooks stores as a specialty chain somehow certainly makes better sense
than running a me-too small-mall bookstore chain, ripe for category-killing.

Mike ... Repositioning Mall stores...I don't see how you could. The key
"Advantage" is to use mall traffic to sell books of interest to the general
population of mall shoppers. Maybe you could turn them into mini superstores
with coffee, cookies a smattering of books and some screens for internet
ordering, thus offering broader selection than superstores and hand-holding net
experience. If they make me CEO [With $3m severence of course] I'd suggest
it...but would be lookin to cash the severence check in the near future.
Those stores were designed and positioned to do something that just doesn't
look profitable in current environment. The original Borders people probably
didn't want em, but the package was sewed together by K-mart before
spin-off...those k-mart folks are well-known for strategic brilliance ;-)

Are Internet Stocks
Overvalued? Are They Ever.

By Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School and author of
"Stocks for the Long Run" (McGraw Hill, 1998).

"Investing in Internet stocks is like playing the lotteries," Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan told Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon in January. "Some may
succeed, but the vast majority will fail." Yet so far, few investors have
failed by buying Internet stocks. And buyers of these stocks will continue to
make money as long as they convince the next guy that the stock will be worth
more tomorrow than it was yesterday.

But no market in history has continued to rise without bound. The Dutch
tulip-bulb mania of the 16th century, the Florida land bubble in the 1920s and
the speculations in precious metals in the 1980s all came to an end. Eventually
the value of all assets must confront the law of economics. This law dictates
that the value of any asset must be tied to the future cash returns paid to the
owner of the asset. This law does not say that Internet stocks are necessarily
overpriced. It does say that we must take a hard look at the valuations of
these firms and decide whether their current prices realistically reflect their
economic potential.

A case in point is American Online, the current "blue chip" of the Internet
stocks and the only pure Internet firm in the Standard & Poor's 500. AOL has a
market value approaching $200 billion, putting it at or near the top 10
companies in market value in the U.S. Yet last year AOL was ranked only 311th
in profits and 415th in sales against other U.S. firms and did not even make
the top 500 in tangible assets. If AOL's ranking in market value matched its
ranking in profits or sales, the firm would have a value of about $4.5 billion.
Ironically this is very close to the current market value of Apple Computer, a
company touted in the 1980s as the pacesetter of the great personal computer
revolution.

AOL is currently selling at more than 700 times its earnings for the past 12
months and 450 times its expected 1999 earnings. These are unprecedented
valuations for a firm with this market value. Small stocks often sell at high
price-to-earnings ratios since their expected future profit potential is large
relative to their size. But we know that when firms reach a certain magnitude,
their growth rate invariably drops, and their price-earnings ratio deflates. If
AOL in its "maturity" sports a P-E ratio of 30--and this is a ratio that still
anticipates substantial growth--it will have to generate net profits of about
$6.7 billion per year to maintain a $200 billion market value. In 1998 General
Electric was the only American firm with profits that high.

One can ask what sales volume will be needed to generate these profits. It
depends on the "margin," or the percentage of net earnings that can be
generated from a dollar of revenue. Very few large firms are able to achieve
20% or higher margins. Microsoft is an exception, but GE, the profit leader for
1998, generated a margin of less than 10%. The average margin of the top 500
firms in the U.S. was only 6.6% last year. At a 10% profit margin, AOL needs to
generate $67 billion in annual sales. Sales of this magnitude were surpassed by
only seven U.S. companies in 1998 (General Motors, Ford, Wal-Mart, Exxon, GE,
IBM and Citigroup), and the average margin of these firms was only 5.7%.

AOL's current market value is about $15,000 per subscriber, or more than 50
times the annual subscription fee. Clearly the market believes that AOL can
capitalize on its audience to sell services and merchandise that will generate
far more revenue than the connect fee.

But here's the rub for Internet companies: Merchandising margins are likely to
be quite small on the Web. Almost all Web surfers are interested in deeply
discounted goods or loss leaders. The whole Web culture thrives on deep
markdowns, razor thin margins and the commoditization of goods and services.

Advertisers seeking premium prices by developing brand names will find the
Internet unsuitable. Any site that thrusts unwanted advertising on its viewers
will be dumped for another site that does not. And one feels no qualms about
milking a site for information and then clicking onto a cheaper supplier. It is
a relief not to have to look a salesperson in the eye and say "Thanks for all
the info, but I don't think I'll buy from you today." The secret of the Web is
the very bane of profitable selling--the ability to switch in an instant to a
merchandiser with a cheaper price.

My reluctance to pay 700 times earnings for AOL is not at all because I am a
"value investor" seeking low P-E ratios. In my book, "Stocks for the Long Run,"
I rejected the conventional wisdom that the "Nifty Fifty" of the early
1970s--those high-flying stocks that carried an average P-E ratio of 40--were
overvalued. Even from their market peak in December 1972, many of these firms,
such as Philip Morris, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers, Gillette, Coca-Cola, Merck,
American Home Products and Pepsi, outperformed the S&P 500 over the next 25
years. But none of the firms that outperformed the market had a P-E ratio in
excess of 60 in 1972, and even the most deserving stock of this original group,
Coca-Cola, would have been overvalued at a P-E ratio of 80.

Even stocks that seemed to have an impregnable hold on future technology did
not warrant P-Es in the triple digits. IBM is an example. Although Remington
Rand came up with the first computer, Univac, in 1951, IBM soon dominated the
field. With its superior research, development and marketing, IBM captured
nearly 80% of the computer market in the 1960s and 1970s and its brand became
almost synonymous with computers and high technology. IBM reached an unheard-of
65 P-E in 1961.

But despite IBM's spectacular earnings growth (18% a year for more than 15
years), IBM was overpriced at that ratio. Big Blue underperformed the S&P 500
after its market peak in 1961. In fact, none of the technology stocks in the
original Nifty Fifty (including Xerox, Digital Equipment, Texas Instruments,
Burroughs, Kodak or Polaroid), has managed to outperform the index over the
past 25 years.

Many enthusiasts maintain that smaller Internet companies may be overpriced,
but AOL and Yahoo! (and perhaps a few others) are the "blue chips" likely to
succeed. This is not necessarily so. In fact, the blue chips, eager to prevent
competition from eroding their already thin margins, will probably buy out many
of these small companies. Give the inflated valuations of the larger Internet
firms, buyouts are easy to manage at almost any price. But buying out the
competition at astronomical prices cannot persist. The buck must stop
somewhere. Eventually the big Internet companies must convert all this Monopoly
money into hard earnings, or their prices will collapse.

No one can deny that the Internet is a communications revolution. But the very
accessibility that has made it spread like wildfire limits its ability to
create premium profits. The Web is democratic and fiercely individualistic; it
requires minimal capital to enter. Services must be provided at cost or users
will switch to alternative sites.

One of the fundamental tenets of economics is that value is created by
scarcity, not by usefulness, need or desire. Water, necessary for the
sustenance of life, costs pennies, but diamonds, used solely for adornment,
fetch astronomical prices. I have no doubt that the Web will revolutionize the
way goods and services are marketed. The Internet will deliver many billions of
dollars of savings to consumers. But this in no way guarantees those billions
will be handed over to the suppliers of this new form of communication.

Armin: One of the appealing aspects of mall REITS, is the stability of cash
flows from long term leases, 3 years or so...I suspect there would be
significant costs to breaking them. I would look for an attrition as the leases
run out. With 3+ times as many Waldens as superstores, it would seem to be a
drag. Course there's always the big bath, get out at any cost
approach...wouldn't want to own the stock the day they announce that.
The cost structure of mall-based stores doesn't lend itself to what would be
considered deep-discount in todays world. Walmart, Best Buy, Target,
etc...offer good sellers at 20 to 40% off. The Waldens already competing with
this. Not so good sellers have to carry enough margin to offset inventory and
return cost. Before the net, this was a low-margin business...now it's a
no-margin business..the mall stores that is.

David, The best-selling kids books are available at mass retialers and
ToysRUs..as well as superstores that have become local destinations for
recreational shoppers. Net based retailers offer deep discounts on more
expensive selections and there are specialty teacher and edutainment outlets
targeting the educational aspect. Then there's the library...i've seen parents
in line with foot high stacks of books. Competing for kid's time and attention
you have: TV, computers, video games, school. Kid's books is a subset of the
overall book market, so your turning away a significant portion of the general
mall audience that you're payin big bucks to court with the mall stores.
I suspect they've experimented with tweaking the mix and have probably got it
about to optimal...the problem is the new influx of competition has cut the
half life of this retail format in half.

Mike: If I were long this, I'd comb the subset of numbers associated with those
900 stores and then ask management some hard questions about how much it costs
to close 'em, and/or fix em and how they plan to go about doing so. Maybe I'm
wrong; maybe they've got a great plan..Dreman must think so, but it sure
doesn't look like it.
You've already got investor sentiment and momentum against this [Lot's of folks
look'n for info hiway roadkill]...and you know how tough that is to overcome,
even if the business is dazzling. The mall-based book selling business has
never, IMO, been dazzling, and recent market changes make it unlikely it will
ever be.
This quote from the Jan 98 10K, <<. The Walden 0.0% comparable store sales
reflects flat mall traffic levels and the impact of increased superstore
competition offset by the benefit of new merchandising initiatives. Walden also
experienced a benefit from a larger number of seasonal calendar kiosks
introduced in malls with existing Walden stores.>> read "merchendising
initiatives" as "we dropped the price".
And this was before the net bookselling armada really emerged from the fog with
cannons blazing.

The spirit of all this is that it's less painful to confront potential errors
in this forum than on the P&L statement. One thing I like about this group is
that it helps me see flaws that might otherwise take a chunk outa my hide.

The way I look at it, the company is growing, is profitable, with good cash
flow. TMF Boring argues with me, saying that the cash flow is poor. Don't get
it. I see them expanding aggressively, growing revenues and the bottom line
with good margins given the business, and all out of cash flow. This tells me
they can keep expanding out of cash flow.

No doubt the superstores are where that cash flow comes from. Walden's, well...
But hey if it had no warts it wouldn't have fallen 65%. I think by focusing on
these warts, investors will overlook the value here. The co and the business
are not perfect, but they are now undervalued.

Re: mall leases, IMO these should probably be capitalized and thought of as a
form of debt. But that's another wart. In spite of these things the company
continues to grow its top and bottom lines, and continues to expand. IMO people
are missing the forest for the trees.

Retailing isn't so hard to figure out. I bought Finish Line when everyone
thought hey it isn't as good as Just For Feet, so why buy? Well, heck, that's
not the point of value investing. Finish Line still could double to fair value,
and it did.

While I believe that internet commerce will far surpass where most writers on

***Off Topic***

IMO, internet commerce will eventually eliminate the fixed price paradigm.
Everything will become auction, but in reverse.

You want a new car. Announce it on e-unbay and the vendors will bid against
each other for your business. A book, same deal. Airline tickets - want to go
to Hawaii, get those airlines bidding for your business.

We will all have lists of stuff we wish to sell, and when anyone wishes to buy
it, you will be notified.

This is how commerce works with large buyers today. The efficiency of internet
communications will allow small buyers the same status.

Think what this will do to retail. No more auto dealerships, just distribution
points and service centers. No more book sellers - the publishers will sell
direct and split the 100% mark-up with the consumer.

The implications are quite enormous, but the market is valuing the wrong
internet companies. In the end, it is simply another huge step in the
efficiency of distribution, which has been happening for two hundred years.

Dreman internet valuation study: The following was excerpted from an article
entitled WHEN THE INTERNET BELL RINGS, WILL LIFEBOATS BE READY? By Pierre Belec

<<David Dreman, head of Jersey City, N.J.-based Dreman Value Management, which
handles $7 billion of assets, said his study found that Internet stocks are
simply an extraordinarily big bubble.

America Online, eBay, Yahoo!, Qwest Communications, Excite, Lycos, E+Trade,
AmeriTrade, Amazon.com and Cisco Systems all went under the microscope in
Dreman's analysis. But only Amazon.com and Cisco were judged to be close to
reality.

Dreman said the difficulty in projecting the future of Internet companies is
that many still do not have any earnings. The analysis got around that problem
by relying on analysts' forecasts of what the companies could earn in their
first year of profitability.

The analysis then projected a large 50 percent earnings growth for the
companies in the first three years, followed by a 25 percent rise for the next
five years, 20 percent for six years, 15 percent for seven years and a 7.5
percent income growth thereafter.

The results were mind boggling.

eBay, which has an incredible forward-looking price/earnings ratio of 8,600,
was worth only $6 a share, compared with its current level of $187.

Yahoo! was given a theoretical value of $31 versus $189; America Online, $38
against $147; Qwest Communications $25 versus $92; Excite $54 compared with
$152; Lycos $34 against $100; E+Trade Group $25 versus $104; AmeriTrade $36
versus the current level of $127.

Wall Street had reasonable expectations only for Amazon.com, which was
calculated to be worth $103 versus its current level of $200, and Cisco, pegged
at $118 versus $113.

''Any Internet companies would say that we're crazy and they'll earn much, much
more, because, after all, this is a 'New World,''' Dreman said. ''But people
have said the same thing about other speculative bubbles.'' >>
What knocked my socks loose about this is it appears to have Dreman supporting
Henry Blodget's Wacky Amazon forecast...ore at least a lot closer to it than I
would have imagined.

Kind of like those credit card offers we get in the mail every day.

Shipping for cheap items is a challenge to my notion. For those, a variety

Was going to ask you if you followed through on your discipline to cover AMZN
at 200. That was where I blew it. My "danger price" was 140 but I watched it go
through that twice, once 60 points in one day, once slowly where I could have
covered easily. Both times I covered in panic/frustration at 185. My "danger
price" is usually right - my mistakes come when I say "just wait, it will go up
(go down) again". If you're going to play this game shorting Amazon, you've got
to have that discipline. I didn't. My hat's off to you.

On a happier note, Journal Register announced a good quarter yesterday and the
stock has started to move. I think it is still a buy (though LKI at under 9 is
even better). (I got in personally yesterday at $14 - my company bought it a
couple months ago - after deciding that market timing is not the way to go when
there are opportunities like this out there. Like I said before, my first
market timing call saved me about 15% of my portfolio, my second cost me about
15% of my portfolio. No more market timing for JJC. Or am I just getting sucked
back in at the top? No, Mike's tirades against me a month ago were right. I
wouldn't have bought the stocks if I didn't think they were dollar bills
selling for 75 cents. Maybe they can go much lower in a market correction, but
if I'm right on my valuation, so what.)

There are an infinite number of mistakes you can make investing, and there is
no shame in making them once. The truly stupid mistakes are the ones you make
over and over again by refusing to learn.

AMZN has market cap of $34b. My rhetorical question: Could you not put together
an equally good website with good software and then inundate the web with
advertisements to let people all know you are there for less than $2b? I think
so. Means AMZN is overvalued by roughly $32b.

If you think about the internet, it will bypass a lot of the cost of "the
middleman." It will add value to those who add value in some unique, hard to
duplicate way. When you get past the blur of this internut craze, you will see
that AMZN is just a middleman. Sooner or later it will fall in price, though it
might take awhile to do so, and get even more ridiculously priced before then.
Border's is somewhat of a middleman too, but they provide a nice selling
experience, and other than underwear and rice, most shopping has a heavy
psychological/spiritual (lol) overlay. Those who have the motto: "When the
going gets tough, the tough go shopping" are not talking about cyberspace
stores.

Now Yahoo is not a middleman. It can become the monster search engine, and its
databases would be hard to duplicate. It is definitely a growth stock, but
probably still overvalued.

On a related note, he is "pounding the table" on IGT, which I own. He is taking
numbers up, and describes it as an "incredible value." I would conjecture that
his enthusiasm might spillover to SLOT.
Has anyone looked at CMO lately? It has reinitiated its dividend at .14/share,
has a book value near $8/share, is continuing its share repurchase, and trades
at 6 1/8, up from the depths of below 3. Got killed on it last year, but

geoffrey Wren <<AMZN has market cap of $34b. My rhetorical question: Could you
not put together an equally good website with good software and then inundate
the web with advertisements to let people all know you are there for less than
$2b? I think so.>>
Yes, you could do all that for the $2b, but you wouldn't take over AMZN's
"Mindshare" as a result of those activities. The bull case for Amazon is that
it has positioned itself as the premier net bookseller, and some think premier
net merchant and that it's very hard and very costly change the consumer's
mind. It's possible that Amazon may shoot itself in the foot transitioning from
premier bookseller to premier net merchant, since that name can't stand for 2
things at once. [Read "Positioning" by Trout and Ries for good background on
this area]
The key issue, IMO, is whether customers will continue to BUY from Amazon at
prices higher than competing alternatives as they become aware that these
alternatives are a click away. Several competitors are offering books, auction
services, etc at 0 margins to make money on ad flow [Buy.com, shopping.com,
Yahoo auctions]. Word of mouth, news articles, and shopbots help customers find
these sites. So consumers read reviews on Amazon's site, then use a shopbot to
find the best deal and buy there. Longer term, recent studies have shown net
customers are generally very price sensitive and in 2 or 3 years, when the
sales tax advantage is eliminated, 25% of those price sensitive shoppers will
return to local retail. Wonder how many earnings models have plugged that in?

Mike, being an MD you should have good insight on serologicals(sero). I bought
a week ago a 5 1/16 and than added all week as I continued to sell covered
calls. If stock retreats back to 6 or so I will probably add to my covered call
positions. My reading of 10K shows this as solid value play at 6(now 7 1/2).
Has anyone on thread read good analysis of the domino effect of momentum
selloffs. SERO lost half of value(10 to 5) in one day. This was completely
uncalled for and the stock recovered all of the next week. My speculation is
that stop loss orders get triggered and the stock falls through all the stop
loss levels at the onset of the fall and then nervous momentum players continue
to sell to avoid margin calls. Sure would like to read something from an

Was wanting to follow up on previous Allstate conversation.

In the most recent conference call the CEO as much as admitted that Allstate
will pursue the direct channel in the near future. Previously comments have
been phrased to say Allstate would focus solely on the agency channel. This is
a shift in thinking at the top, and pursuing the direct channel, while running
the risk of alienating the agency force, is the long term "right" thing to do.

Revenue growth in P&C business was weak in first quarter. 2.2%. Without this
continuing slowing growth from the old channel I doubt the company would've had
the guts to say they need to address the direct channel for growth.

This gets into the new vs old paradigm again.

Will internet retailers entirely replace physical ones?

Will direct insurance entirely replace agent ones?

Will direct manufacturer on line sales alienate the channel to the
point of non-viability?

So will Amazon put Borders out of business? Will GEICO put AllState out of
business? Will Compaq fail because it is too far behind Dell and other direct
models?

The market seems to be voting yes. Amazon can acquire Borders
in entirety by issuing just 3% of its stock.

IMO this is way too extreme, but rationally I must admit that one would expect
that the very last ones to admit to this paradigm
shift would be located on some archaic thread called "Value

Which studies? Not to challenge you, but just for my own info database.

The sales tax isn't the whole price difference, so the implication is that the
retailer absolutely must have the lower total price to attract both initial and
repeat businesss. And even so, 25% will leave if the lower price is just
moderately lower. IOW, people like to shop, like to browse bookstores, etc.

Mike,

At Allstate, I don't think the discussion is about direct channel replacing the
captive channel (agency force). The numbers indicate that 70% or so of the
customers still prefer an agent - captive or independent. About 20% of
customers now prefer a direct company, and this percentage has grown
substantially over the years. (The other 10% don't know what they want <g>).
The direct channel is the fastest growing segment of the business and Allstate
has no presense. The other channels are being squeezed as growth accelerates in
direct.

To me it's also a discussion of ROI. Allstate is spending alot of money on
technology to make the agency force more efficient and to generate growth. The
question is "could this money be spent more effectively if we invest in the
direct channel?" To some degree I think the company's answer is "Yes."

re: Allstate. Nice article in this week's Barron's on auto insurers. I think
they got it about right (where the industry's been and where it might be
going). In that vein, I've passed on Allstate after considering posts here.

I occasionally look at Mercury General (MCY); they've had problems in
underestimating the reserves they would need (or maybe it's that they booked
too much 'bad' business). I think MCY is fairly valued here. Also, I watch 20th
Century (TW)- a hard one to figure for me. Seems fairly valued -- the way I
value these things -- and I am by no means a knowledgeable or astute or
competent evaluator-- but AIG DOES keep increasing its share buy of Twentieth.
I am a long-time owner of Commercial Group (CGI). I'm disappointed the stock is
trading close to its lows. I think the stock's fair value might be about 30 (up
from low 20's).
The auto insurance business IS undergoing quite a bit of change. These
companies in auto insurance had better be quick and alert or they will be
trampled badly. So far... it's just the stocks and stockholders who are
hurting.

SERO - I'm wondering if there's something that the 'market' knows that isn't
reflected in the 10K and the PR's? It appears that the stock price declined 50%
in linear fashion since December, with another 50% "waterfall" collapse after
the recent news that two international partners will not be taking expected
antibody volume because their plants are shut down. Since Bayer is a customer
for 40% of their output, and Centeon takes another 14%, you wonder if they
aren't about to take a big hit? Note that three of four Bayer contracts expire
in 1999. (I recognize that the 10K says that international customers account
for only 47% of their sales yet it looks like these two German Co's are 55%??)

In any case this doesn't look like a terribly profitable business. The product
is basically commodity, and regulated. There are stated unknowns like Mad Cow
disease (CJD), HIV, Hepatitis, etc. where they are harvesting plasma from
professional donors, winos, etc.

Management indicates that the loss of international business will cause a 15
cent hit to earnings; expect earnings of 50 cents this year. At a PE of 10, $5
could be fair.

[I freely admit that a real understanding of the risk/reward of this business
are outside my circle of competence. I faced a similar conundrum with CURE when
I posted on it several weeks ago. In that instance as well the 'market' 'knew'
something that was not apparent to the casual reader. In that case as well

Mike, Couldn't locate full article or source quote on studies projecting 25%
would return to traditional retail if sales tax advantage were eliminated. I
just made of note of it in my files, sorry. Also did a quick news search, but
couldn't turn it up...but I'm sure it was this year.
I can say with certainty though, that there's currently a 3 year moratorium on
taxes starting in 1998, so any impact of sales tax on net sales would be down
the road.
Possible scenario: Over the next 2 years Borders closes a chunk of those mall
stores that are marginal or don't work...and trades flat to down as earnings
hits come thru for the closings. They find approaches that work in rest of
stores. The stock bottoms in 2 - 2.5 years...could be a buy in anticipation of
shift from tax on net sales.

I agree that people like to browse bookstores...at least superstores like
Borders and B & N. And some of that browsing translates into sales...but sales
for whom? As more consumers become aware of lower cost availability on the net,
will they continue to pay a significant premium to buy locally? I disagree with
those who think all life on earth migrates to the net, but this is a vulnerable

Mike, I saw that and was extremely surprised. I had just attended a
presentation from ADAC at a cancer symposium. Basically, ADAC now has the
software to allow PET imaging on a regular Nuclear Medicine camera, which is
extremely cheaper than a real PET scan. The technology is called coincidence
imaging. I spoke to the Nuclear Medicine head and she stated that ADAC was
definitely a leader in this technique over GE. I have to say the actual
presentation (slides, etc.) was weak, but you can't beat the technology. It is
the cost effective method of doing a PET scan which is becoming popular in
certain types of cancer because it detects higher metabolic activity that
tumors produce. Anyway, Nuclear Medicine is 75-80% of ADAC's business, whereas
RTP planning systems is about 15%. So I can say that they are still selling
those systems like hotcakes and are the market leader, but that only accounts
for 15% of the whole. I live in a SE metropolitan area of about 500K and every
metropolitan system uses ADAC for radiation treatment planning.

ADAC is now trading at book and with a very low price to sales ratio which I
believe makes it worth a look. I would like to wait and see what the actual
earnings will be and then evaluate. But, just on my knowledge of the field, I
am considering purchasing a few shares just on the basis that I know they will
still operate as a going concern and will eventually return to higher levels.

On the impact of VAR I see little if any. The only product that they compete on
is RTP systems and that is where ADAC is still the leader. Varian is still in
the infancy stage in that arena.

As far as the longtime outlook for capital equipment manufacturers in the
future, it is becoming cloudier by the day. Our CEO just told us the other day
that we will never make money on an inpatient again! So I would only be looking
at companies that equip outpatient services, of which both of these do. The new
outpatient services reimbursement rates (APC) is still in the comment stage

2001. I will further discuss that issue later when I have more time.

Re: How do they make sure you really get what you pay for? [on ebay auctions]?

I have known two people who bought things on internet auctions. One showed me
the auction system in fact. She bought some jewelry, found it grossly
misrepresented. Also, she now has a feeling that the person who forced her bid
up at the end may have been a shill. Paid $100, felt it was worth $10. But the
seller was overseas, etc. Now she won't use auctions anymore. Someone else I
know bought a computer on the internet. He got it quickly, but it did not work.
The seller has offered to fix the machine, but he has to drive 60 miles and
leave it overnight. He has not got around to it yet. In the interim, comparable
priced computers have dropped in price $100-$200. He won't use auctions anymore
either.

That's two I know who have tried, two who won't use it anymore. Maybe that is
not typical, but . . . .

I believe the true future of the internet here is not auctions, but a system of
registering items for sale easily and systematically. It will probably be Yahoo
that gets to this first; something like the current Personal Ads that it
already runs. Let's say you enter that you are interested in a used 20" tv for
less than $125 within 20 miles of your house, and you get a listing of them.
Within 5 years I would say this will be the primary classified ad system in the
US. Then you get to see what you are buying before you buy it, but it is the
internet that puts the buyer and seller together. Obviously this threatens the
cash cow at the newspapers now in their Classified advertisements, but where
the consumer wins, there is often a businessman who loses.

Price/Sales 110.6 3.3 457.95
Price/Book 96.7 3.6 286.19
Market Cap $7.9B $958M $25.5B

The 11/25 column was put together by a short explaining

I agree that yahoo and others will command much

home builders quiz

These stocks seem to have been hit by sellers worried about interest rates and
the economic picture. And I have read a few demographic experts saying that
household formation will ease a bit over the next 10 years. Maybe that's why
all these stocks are depressed. But the prices seem to be popping back up
lately.

Given that, I betcha some builders who are building in the growth areas of the
country will continue to grow. Most builders are now reporting record sales and
profits -- and also -- record orders and backlog.

Here is the quiz --
Read this press release and guess the stock price. Since this release does not
give EPS history/projections, use this:

-- EPS 1998 was $1.50, projection for 1999 is $1.82, or 21%
-- The Q1 projection of .39 was just beat with .46 actual

read the verbage and guess the fair price:

Here are the big players (LEN, CROS, SPF are my picks)--

recently. My nearest pass at this sector was my recent rec. on this board of
USG @48...now at 59.75 due to shortages of their mainstay, wallboard, giving
them a freedom to price truly rare in todays somewhat disinflationary

Seems to me that money is leaving the value sector once again.
The last few days, if it weren't for my Apple, American Power,
and CompUSA positions, I'd be losing money in a time when the
market is roaring higher, and the Nasdaq is up 13% in five days. REITs are
falling once again. The oils and minerals are also falling. I recently rotated
out of the heavy cyclical concentration I had and into some undervalued techs,
evidently just in time. I may be rotating back pretty quick given the lopsided
falls in certain stocks relative to the rally in the growth/techs. There's
still some downside there (after all, LHO isn't at 8 1/2 again yet), and I'm
willing to be
patient and wait for the second bottom. Just isn't looking like I'll have to
wait that long. IMO though that rather severe bounce up we had in the value
sector shows us a bit where the bottom might be if the stocks get there again.

Off Topic,

I read this thread and any other Value Investing information I can find. I have

purchased the 1934 edition as it is considered a classic. Question ? I recently
purchased IDXC a Vermont Software Company . For some reason I thought this is a

THE FOX: IDXC Quick glance impressions: Large drop in price doesn't make a
value stock...reasonably dependable earnings selling at significant discount to
market does IMO. The wide spread in earnings expectations indicates analysts
following IDXC disagree wildly about it's prospects. Since analysts usually
herd around a number, this indicates lot's of uncertainty. Tech co's can easily
miss a turn in the technology as opposed to Wrigley which will still be putting
out Doublemint when we've all shuffled off this mortal coil. Wrigley might
become a value stock if a rumor circulated that chewing gum caused hoof in
mouth disease of some such and knocked the price of the stock down well below
what is reasonable. By contrast, if IDXC really misses a turn in the tech
cycle, they may be toast.
There's some pretty good stuff on valuing stocks on the Motley Fool site...but
don't pay too much attention to the stuff about internet stocks.
Hope this helps.

re: Bill Miller (Legg Mason) & TOY & STK.

Seems like I keep following this guy into some of his picks. 'Cept he can hold
on and make money, and I cannot. Agrhh. Sold most of my TOY to buy THQI. Both
have gone up. Gain is there, but my decision was wrong, esp. since I could've
had a long term cap. gain w/TOY. (Should have just bought THQI and left TOY
alone.) TOY is up strongly today- they are going to emphasize their internet
presence-- this is really not new news or really not unexpected.

I have been watching Storage Technology for a while. Today I started a very
small position. (And a lousy day it is too to buy stocks --with the market
hitting new highs.) Missed buying at the low 2 days ago -- although Miller
bought heavily (according to a nice write-up about him in thestreet.com (can be
accessed by Yahoo news on STK.) Again, this is not new info. about Miller and
STK. He was buying in Nov./Dec according to Kipplinger Dec. issue (p. 106) when
STK was at much higher prices. STK is having its troubles. I fully expect the
stock to drop to even newer new lows. But for anyone who wants to establish a
position (and who might not want to wait for next q announcements), now is an
okay time to buy - imo. Big tech co. with lots of people and lots of resources
and multibillions in sales. I think they'll be an okay (profitable) investment
for anyone who can hold on for a couple of years. For me though -g-, with some
of these stocks -- doesn't look like I can sit on 'em long enough.

Yes, Mike, agree with you re: MCK. Not in a rush to buy.

I follow it a little. Nice write-up (well, it WAS nice before today's disaster)
on 2/26/99 in MSN MoneyCentral. Possibly lots of funds which were looking for a
lower price alternative to expensive pharaceuticals are selling their positions
today. As of 2/8, MCK was a big holding I believe in Invesco Strategic Health,
for example. (Although, of course, I don't know if they're selling today.)

Not sure what the ultimate downside will be for MCK. I'd guess though that with
prescription fills going internet, MCK as a big medical distributer, might
recover --- eventually.

Staffing companies - mmww in particular.

I am not a big fan of the staffing companies, but a few look undervalued. I
just started looking at REMX and I purchased MMWW yesterday.

And, lucky me on MMWW, with a nice pop today after earnings came out -- hitting
the number they promised. (It seemed safe since they pre announced that the qtr
was OK.) They were a staffing company who moves to IT consulting. Well here's
the propaganda ...

Metamor Worldwide, a diversified global IT services provider, offers customers

think that the covering of short options positions exaggerated the moves on the
up side. Any sharp decline should leave the short put writers scrambling so the
down side can be just as scary.
The fact that Dreman would even consider buying internets shows how strong the

Bad news out about Amazon.com and it looks like it will translate into bad news
for shareholders and good news for shorts. I don't have the stomach for that
but I know many here do.

Other news: a prodigal son of the Value thread, Oxford Health Plans (OXHP) has
released better than expected earnings although the actual earnings seem to
come from a one-time inflow from disposing of their NY medicaid business. Even
so without that the loss is less than expected. Seems to be a turn-around.

One for the board: Not sure if posted: MOCO Modern Controls. Makes precision
measuring equipment. Niche market. Great (dependable?) margins. No debt.
However quite small. Might be worth a look.

Have to segregate by type of assets (esp. stocks vs. bonds), maybe for firm
size or breadth of asset categories (variety of fund types). Here are some
numbers for you, regardless.

Assets under management: Individual Investor 2/99, p.85

EV 27.5
FII 102.9
BEN 208.6
JNC 52.7
LM 74.8
L 57.5
PFX 5.2
PA 225.9
PIOG 20.0
TROW 129.5
WDR 24.8

And based on yesterday's Yahoo market cap figures, each $1 of
market cap supports the following number of dollars of managed assets:

AC 54
EV 36
FII 72
BEN 21
JNC 40
LM 38
L 55
PFX 49
PA 168
PIOG 40

WDR 18

Comminged stuff in some of these firms: WDR (Wadell & Reed, brokerage); others
not on this list (MEL=Mellon with Dryfus, Marsh & Mc, KSU=Janus, etc.)

Trick to investing: Buy stocks that lose money. According to the Wall Street
Journal a couple of days ago, if last year you invested in those companies in
the Nasdaq 2000 that made money, you would have lost money. If you invested in
