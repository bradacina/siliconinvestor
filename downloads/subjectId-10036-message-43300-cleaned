My very short experience with shorting taught me to :

1. Not short a company that is a leader in its industry (the biggest in the
particular business). It doesn't matter how compelling the valuation arguments.

2. Much easier to short a small (chinese) company that is a fraud.

3. Never be too confident.

4. Shorting is not for me :)

I have a lot of respect for professional short sellers like Chanos.
Is there anyone on the board who has a successful record in shorting.

Good Investing,

its hard not be wildly bullish on both gold and silver. Personally i think the

Thanks for the link. I don't know much about commodities, so this is
educational.

I read this on http://silverstockreport.com/essays/Silver_vs_Gold.html

"What is really odd is that the world has seven times as much refined gold as
silver, yet silver is still cheap compared to gold: 60 ounces of silver being
the equivalent to an ounce of gold. An impartial observer might may view those
figures and conclude that a maximum price for silver would be seven times more
valuable than gold!

But how much gold and silver is there in the ground? In the ground, gold is
more rare than silver. The historic ratio is about 15:1, meaning 15 ounces of
silver were worth about one ounce of gold, and this ratio was very close to the
ratio at which the two were mined. About ten to fifteen times as much silver
was mined as gold. Today, less silver is mined."

I guess they don't call them rare metals for nothing!

re RWE.DE - I came across indications in the financial news in Germany that RWE
will perform a capital raise and a sale of transmission assets in order to keep
their A credit rating. The reason for the negative outlook in the credit
ratings are the reduced cash flow to permanently shutting down their nuclear
power plants.Same applies to EON.DE.

This might be important information for someone to invest. keep in mind that
the LT business plan review is due in August too. The capital raise as well as
clarity on the LT business plan may be a good entry point to invest in RWE.DE.
I consider it unlikely that the shares will move much beforehand anyways. A
significant capital raise would very likely result in another leg down.

FWIW, there are also other rumors that Gazprom (the russian NG supplier) may
seek a stake in RWE.DE.

Anthony - this sounds like a steep drop. I am sure you are aware that Silver is
produced mostly a byproduct in mines that have another primary product. As
such, you only get the natural decline (which usually is alleviated by mine
extension projects if prices are favorable) but not the inevitable
by-production of Silver that results from the startup of mines targeted other
ores.

Since silver is a byproduct, it's going to be difficult to estimate the silver
production from mines starting up, but I am sure it's going to be substantial.
As such, i think your estimate overshoots on the production decline.

It's focus has shifted to oil.

I decided I quite like that it's a large independent with correspondingly large

Niobrara. EOG is the biggest oil producer in these areas. And it's also in
other shale plays - Horn River, Wapiti Cardium, et. al.

http://www.eogresources.com/operations/division_operations.html

6/11 presentation.: http://www.eogresources.com/investors/slides/SB_0611.pdf

I'd say that if it's possible to have a conservative bet on horizontal shale,
and if a person wanted to make maybe just one set-and-wait bet and not get
caught up in the many shale plays and shale e&p companies, then EOG would be
the company to consider. Maybe EOG won't be the best stock performer, but with
EOG's large and diversified shale positions and current and planned production
operations, the stock may be a likely bet to do okay.

Getting a proper purchase price is an important part. And here I could be very
wrong with EOG, as I seem to be given my losing position.

BHP Billiton swoops on U.S. gas firm Petrohawk for $12.1 bln
http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/15/petrohawk-bhp-idUSL3E7IE47Z20110715?f
edType=RSS&feedName=rbssEnergyNews&rpc=43

Mining and oil company BHP Billiton unveiled a $12.1 billion agreed takeover of
U.S. gas producer Petrohawk Energy Corp on Friday, marking the Anglo-Australian
firm's biggest step into the booming shale-gas industry.

The all-cash deal is pitched at $38.75 per Petrohawk share, a 65 percent
premium to its last-traded price, and follows BHP's $4.75 billion purchase of
Chesapeake Energy's interest in an Arkansas shale gas field in February.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
Petrohawk Energy Corporation Co (NYSE: HK ) is a big player where EOG & LEI
operate in the Eagle Ford Shale (specifically the Little Tom Field).

This is a document I posted analyzing the Little Tom Field prospects (this came
up when researching LEI -
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27282822)

http://www.eagleford.com/docs/RPS_report.pdf

If you search the PDF document for "Petrohawk" you can find several of their
leases are contiguous or near LEI's and EOG's.

From the document: "...Little Tom Field is also located in the middle of the
Petrohawk Energy 87,000-acre Redhawk Eagle Ford lease block (average cost
$200/acre) with a reported 350 bopd discovery at Mustang Ranch...."

I guess BHP found enough value in these leases that Petrohawk hold to offer a
65% premium for their company "all cash". This should bode well for BOTH EOG
and LEI. Too bad we missed buying Petrohawk Energy.

EKS. LEI might still be a buy based on its holdings, and because it's not so
well known as the bigger players. Otoh, I'm not watching it closely enough to
know exactly what LEI controls. The mineral/oil rights are sold by levels, and
so we may have different owners in the same lat/long. That is, one owner for
the Three Fork Shale that lies below the Austin Chalk formation, and a
different owner for the land (Austin Chalk) that's above the Three Forks.

Meanwhile I continue to hold my LEI shares. Stock closed @ $2.71 today.

From 6/11 Presentation, p. 15:

"Marathon paid (ed.:for its Eagle Ford acquisition)
$3.5 billion less $0.5 billion proved producing =
$3.0 billion divided by 140,000 net acres =
$21,400 per net acre."

"Lucas has
4,400 net acres times $21,400 per net acres =
$94 million divided by 22,460,000 shares =
$4.20 per share (fully diluted) Eagle Ford only"

HK has at least three shale areas. HK is being bought for $12B, plus I assume
acquisition of net debt of $3B-1.5B = $1.5B (Yahoo numbers). So valuation is
about $13.5B, for which in return BHP gets about 1 million acres of HK
shaleholdings. So BHP is paying roughly $13,500 per acre for HK's various
shales. Which, perhaps conservatively might be translated to LEI to be $2.64
per share for its Three Forks/Austin Chalk. Perhaps more, because not all shale
areas are worth the same. Three Forks is more desirable now (I presume) than
HK's other shales. Further, LEI apparently has maybe 16K of other land in TX in
addition to Three Forks. Seems like LEI is still undervalued. At least relative
to what larger shale companies are being bought out for.

GOOG - I did well by continuing to average in to sell 410 & 420 Dec & Jan12

premiums will be collected as income as long as the stock stays above 420. The
key to playing these high volatility names is to take advantage of the high
option premiums. One can use this strategy on AAPL, however for AAPL I would

re HIG, I looked at this stock since it indeed looks cheap by many measures. I
think they have some liabilities around their annuity business (there was also
something else that i forgot about) that make me pause. Based on my somewhat
lacking memory a decline in equity markets could have a substantial impact on
their book value, since they offered equity indexed returns with downside
protection in their annuities for a while, which is that got them into big
trouble in 2008/2009. They may have protected themselves now after the equity
market but I am not sure about that.

Also, their history of operational screwups gives me second thoughts as well.
To tough to call this one for me. I prefer DL.AS (which appears to have good

Not quite true. PEP traded in 2000 around 30-35$. KO was expensive but even
that stock would be bought in Y2000 around 45$ if you were looking for a good
entry point.

PEP is currently trading for 68$ and for KO 67$.. From appreciation alone, PEP
investors would have a return of about 7% annualy (calculating from the 32.5$
midpoint), plus probably 2% from dividends. KO was very expensive in Y2000, but
if you bought close to the low in Y2000 at 45$, your annual return would have
been 4% (plus a little from dividends).

Those are not great returns but they beat putting the money under the mattress.
the growth did in fact bail out the investors of these great companies. Of
course even though those stocks were overvalued in Y2000, they were not as
overvalued as CSCO in Y2000 and many others, trading at PE's of 50x+. The Momo
investors in new crop of bubble stocks like OPEN, CRM, CMG and LKND will

I question whether it's likely that there are any but a very few market
participants who would hold a stock for twelve years without having any gains
to show for it. Perhaps they would mostly be employees of the company. In which
case maybe they get stock or buy stock, year-after-year to accumulate a
position. In which case, ala Buffett's observation that if you intend to eat
hamburgers year after year, you want the price of hamburger meat to stay low -
the employees would want the stock to be low as they build their position.

As I consider ltb&h shareholders, I have to assume that if somebody liked
something like KO or MSFT and if there were many consecutive years of nothing
(except maybe dividends) and the person wasn't discouraged and selling out,
then at some point or points, such as '08, '09 ( when stocks were beat down to
multi-year lows), the person would be adding to the position. Or at least
reinvesting dividends. Maybe the results of doing that (dollar cost averaging)
would be satisfactory. Satisfactory enough to keep the person in the stock for
12 years and more. That would be assuming the person uses ltb&h as a strategy
and therefore picks a couple or a few stocks. (Picking one stock, the wrong
stock, would be a problem. I.e. just having only MSFT it would be one tough

the 10-12 years. Or only holding GE even with its dividend-- that would be

you say silver is hyped now. everything is relative. silver has gone from $4 to
$38 in the last few years, a lot of people have done very well myself included.
however i also remember 30 years when silver was $8 and i thought it was
mispriced then. it just goes to show you that a small market can manipulated
for decades. now i dont know how youve mined the data and whether you are
accounting for production increases as well. dont forget some of those large
mining companies have presold much of their future silver production to silver
wheaton. also my own sad experience as an investor has been that meeting future
production and cost forcasts are far from being a slam dunk. All the being said
the biggest factor in the future pricing of silver is that with the advent of a
chinese metals exchange it may become much more difficult to manipulate the
price of precious metals going forward and this may both increase speculative
demand and force the shorts to cover their positions.

The other major factor in play here is that investor need to diversify out of
currency based investments. the major source of diversification used to be real
estate. that has gone by the wayside now.
Anecdotally, I have been talking up silver on this thread and to my friends
since 2008 i think when it was about $10 and there have been relatively few
people interested here and none of my friends. I practically begged one of my
best friends to buy silver wheaten at $14 but they never did. I also suggested
to a couple of my friends that they try to purchase the 2010 atb silver bullion
sets, but no interest there either. My guess is that when silver hits $50 again
it will start to get some mainstream media attention. most likely that it is a
bubble.

the problem with GS, MS, BAC are that they are black boxes and in good years
very little of the profits made are being shared with investors, they are all
sitting with potential legal exposure of undetermined magnitude and reshaping
their operations so that we dont know what their future centers will be. its no
wonder that they are all selling below book right now. Buffet had the right
idea exacting a nice income payment as preferred lender, as well as free
warrants to the upside. unfortunately its difficult for us small fry to get the
same deal. I think investors in these companies are finding out that they have
fewer and fewer people to sell their shares to.

I think that BAC is becoming less of a black box. It sure has large legacy
problems but I think the new CEO Moynihan makes a good impression and promises
no more acquisitions. It is interesting to compare BAC before and after the
crises - shares increased from 5B to 10B (2x), tangible equity/share increased
from 10$ to 13$ (12.5$ if you count in the mortgage settlement). Plus, they do
own Merrill Lynch now. They also own stakes in China Construction bank and
Blackrock, which are non-core and can be sold off.

In my opinion, this is going to be a company that has to muddle through it's
issues 2 more years and then becomes a great dividend payer. the higher capital
ratios for Basel III plus additional buffer will make Banks much more robust
and hence market will assign a larger multiple to earnings than it has in the
past. Well at least that is the bullish scenario. The bearish one is that fat
tail risk hits and the stock become significantly impaired or even a zero. I
think this chance is less than 20% though. Overall, I believe that the fat tail
risk is embedded already in the shares but probably not in the overall market
in terms of valuation. So, my believe is that BAC is a value stock at this
point, even accounting for the risks.

I believe that MS and GS have much larger issues with their business model that
still depends on trading for the bulk of their earnings. They also have legacy
issues ( read the Big Short) that right now do not seem to be in the headlines
- but I do recall that MS for example specifically designed CDO that could
declare a complete default when only a small slice of their holdings default
(this was hidden in the footnotes somewhere if memory serves me correctly and
the construct made a default almost inevitable). I don't even want to start how
GS screwed and is still screwing their customers (just read about the episode
with the Libyan Wealth trust where GS could evaporate a couple B$ without a
contract in place, trading for their customers...)

I don't use PEG. Most of value stocks don't have a reliable PEG anyway.

Some people argue against buying stocks that are not growing. There is
something to be said for this argument. The downside is that there are very few
value stocks that are also growing. There is also risk of "falling angels"
value-growth traps, where a company looks cheap and growing but is going to
dive soon (fads, frauds, commoditized/obsolete-tech).

I look at the 3-5 year growth of the stocks I buy. However, I don't have a hard
limit on growth or non-growth rates. Depends on the industry, company, etc.

You wanted a positive black swan, and you report you got it, so congrats go to
you. I count 60 stocks in the portfolio. One tremendous winner (more than 10x
any other stock). One outstanding out of 60: INSM.

Is this a real money portfolio? Did you buy all the stocks at about the same
time? And will you sell them based on a time period? That is, sell them all
after holding about a year, and then repeat the buy/sell process? If you don't
sell by time, then I assume you must sell (if you do sell) by price. What
determines the price at which you will sell winners?

The positions don't seem to be always bought on an equal $ weight. At my
glance, most buys around $16K+-, I see one under $10K though, and the winner,
INSM at about $22K.

I'll assume you've got the results you say, and that it's me who's just not
understanding it: There was a reverse split on INSM, with Yahoo showing the
adjusted stock never trading under $4.69 (closing price) in the past year and
being between $6+ and $7+ in June 2010 about when you say you established your
portfolio.

High Paul -

E&P Basket - Positive Black Swan(s) or just a few small cap E&P's creating
value

I have noticed in my E&P basket of 18 stocks I have 3 positions that are my
positive Black Swans. Well if not Black Swans, they have more than doubled and
have accounted for my basket to show a positive net return (up 5.75% to date).
I also have a similar number of loosers but not quite as bad. 16% of my E&P
basket represent 100% (or more) gainers compared to 1.7% in badi_ portfolio (ie
INSM).

I have to think it is the nature of these small cap companies. As positive news
about new productive wells are announced significant value is made and
eventually it is reflected in the stock price. I have noticed that even with
bad news like non productive well results, the stock(s) trade lower but so far
eventually recover (perhaps because many of my companies already have proven
reserves that provides a floor level of value). This is not the case for
badi_'s stocks as many of his down side companies lost more than 30%. Many of
his positions do not have a floor level of value like the small cap E&P
companies have with their proven reserves.

I also track the daily price of crude oil vs the daily value of my E&P basket.
There is a small positive correlation but definitely not 1:1. The biggest
change in my E&P basket occurs as crude oil falls below $100 per barrel
especially when looked at $5 increment moves, I started tracking the daily
prices of crude oil on 3/11/2011 through present. The high price of crude
occurred 4/29/2011 at $113.70 with the low on 6/24/2011 at $90.59 (one day
after the crude oil supplies were released into the market by president Obama).

I added 14% more to my E&P basket in April 2011 when crude oil averaged 110 per
barrel. <u>Big mistake as many of these adds are still under water.</u>

In May 2011 I added another 7% to the basket where crude averaged around $100
per barrel. <u>These worked out OK and are slightly positive.</u>

In June 2011 where crude averaged around $95 per barrel I added another 4% to
the basket.. <u>All of these buys are up, some more than 30%.</u>

In hindsight, the best time to add to the E&P basket is when crude drops below
$95 per barrel. I should have peeled off a few shares on crude oil spikes above
$110 per barrel. Also, on positive company specific news events, a few shares
should be sold (especially when crude is over $105 per barrel) w/ the
expectations to buy back these shares on a drop of crude back into the 90's
price range.

Finally, I noticed as the mega deals were announced over this time period (ESV,
PTR, MRO, CHK,XOM, BHP, SUG) the average move in my E&P basket was net positive
with most of the gain sticking over time. The average $/acre has increased with
these large deals which has created more value in my small cap E&P companies w/
similar acres. (eg. LEI has a cost of $287/acre w/ BHP paying as much as
$13,500/acre for Petrohawk Energy acreage - Both own Eagle Ford Shale acreage
contiguous to each other).

In summary, one does see more "positive" type Black Swan events in the small
cap E&P companies due primarily to "positive" news events. Adding shares to the
basket when crude oil falls below $95 per barrel has helped the overall return.
Shares purchased when crude was over $105 per barrel was a mistake and those
buys are still underwater. Your down side Black Swan events are small even with
bad news as long as you do your due diligence and only buy those companies with
undervalued proven reserves (typically measured by their BOE/D production)
and/or undervalued leases (when compared to the most recent sales).

My E&P basket is up 5.75% to date and crude closed 7/15/2011 at $97.30 per
barrel.

CB&I Scores Engineering, Construction Contract for Northeastern Facility
CB&I - Wednesday, July 13, 2011

http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=109104

From the article:"...CB&I has been awarded a contract, valued in excess of $300
million, for a new natural gas processing plant in the Northeastern U.S....".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------

My original purchase of this company was because of their growing NG
infrastructure businesses. I thought they would be a big player in building
many of the new NG processing plants in the growing shale regions in the U.S..
I am also pleasantly surprised that their newly created Lummus Technology
division is landing service contracts that provides the initial NG process
planning design. This group of engineers and the services they provide allows
the company to land these new processing plant facility contracts.

From the new contract announced this week:"...CB&I's work scope includes the
engineering, procurement and construction of a 200 million cubic foot per day
natural gas processing plant, including full fractionation and treatment
capabilities, storage tanks and loading systems. In addition, CB&I's Lummus
Technology business sector is providing its proprietary NGL-MaxSM recovery
technology. The contract is scheduled for completion in 2012. .."

The stock has run up over 122% in the past year. Based on the analysts
estimate(s) for next year of $2.83/share and an industry PE of 19, fair value
could be around $53.77/share. That's a possible 33% increase from Friday's
close of $ 40.50/share. With a looming slow down in economic growth, I will
hold my small amount of shares and perhaps add back to a full position on any
significant correction.

Hi There Madharry,

I am in your camp with regards to silver. Like you, I urged my family to buy
silver around $11 in vain. I think there are significant demand drivers for
silver; sentiment, industrial applications, looming silver shortage. I remember
hearing that silver demand/usage can be interpreted as a herald of forth coming
good or bad economies. It may indicate the level of industrial activity similar
to the way transports are suppose to represent economic activity.

As far as how I conducted my research, I used mainly SEC filings of large
miners like BHP form 20F. I looked at some smaller miners, however I found the
information a bit lacking. I tried to be conservative and restricted myself to
"proven reserves" I used the companies average extraction rate in a straight
line manner against the proven reserves. The pattern that emerged was similar
among several companies of varying sizes. I am embarrassed to say, I can't find
my file with the hard numbers. I was hoping to provide you with more detail.

I want to share my information, with the hope that I could contribute in a
positive way to the conversation.

The hype, as I see it, is coming from Vloggers, and others claiming silver will
go as high as $2000 - $10000 an ounce. Sites like "National Inflation
Association", who made tens of thousands or possibly hundreds of thousands
aware of gold and silver, run slick "fear porn" videos on Youtube. The founder
and brains behind NIA is the youngest convicted pumper dumper(16yo at the
time): Jonathan Lebed. Through a recent falling out with a former confederate
(George of "Survive and Thrive Youtube channel) it came to light than young Mr
Lebed was making approximately $50000 a day in his pump and dump operations. He
has become more sophisticated in his legal arrangements in the current
incarnation of his business. At-any-rate, Mr Lebed seems to be using and
creating interest in gold and silver to lead the naive; ultimately parting them
from there money in unwise investments. Mr Lebel isn't the only ringmaster out
there. What worries me is the number of people have piled into silver with out
doing the most cursory of research.
I am still positive on silver for the long term. My timing may be off, however
the nature of supply and demand indicates appreciation of silver prices
continuing into the distant horizon.

I have to say I am a novice at this. I am trying to learn value investing, and
I feel that I have much MUCH to learn. That is why I am here. I have limited
resources such that it effects the quality of my information, however I try to
find 2 or 3 corroborating data points. I am working on a couple of companies as
value plays. I think I will be able to post something soon for the value
investing board's critique.

If silver goes extremely high, I would think that recycling of Silver as well
as scraping silver goods will become a substantial supply source. Right now
Silver recycling supplies ~215MoZ to the supply, approx 25% of the supply. At
some point, this number should go up substantially.

http://www.silverinstitute.org/supply_demand.php

Another issue is that the Silver (or certain compounds thereoff) toxicity has
apparently been underestimated and has recently been re-categorized. I became
aware of this when we reviewed updated MSDS (material safety datasheets)s for
Silver use. In our case, it meant that we would not use a process using Silver.
Again, this is probably not impact demand now, but LT it will (imo).

I don't get it either, but that's a personal limitation. I can't wait to

the cost basis of INSM is settled/explained and if this was the black swan, my
question is why didn't you put 25% of your money in it? What is the common
denominator between all the selections? More so, just tell us which one is
going to be the next multi-bagger so I can start asking for Natalie Portman's

The 1 in 60 large black swan: Of course, it's in retrospect so nobody a-priori
(i.e. in advance) can predict which will be that large black swan.

If the success of the person's black swan strategy is ultimately dependent on
number of positions held (because predicting which individual company/stock
will be a swan is not really likely, so a basket has to be chosen), then at
bottom the person seems to be saying that he found one really good black swan
in 60 positions. So what would be the chance of again finding another such swan
in the next 60 picks? I claim it could just as easily be no such stock will be
found as one stock will be found. Maybe he could have two. Less probable, I
assume would be that he would find three or more that stand out. (based on the
1 in 60 in this first set) The possibility of none though prevails in my mind.

By the way I look at these things (and that's just me), the person couldn't and
shouldn't put 1/4 of his portfolio into one or a few such picks if he's using
swan expectations as a basic strategy. Rather, the person should have more
picks to up the likelihood of finding more swans. That is, instead of about 60
picks at $16K each, more like 120 @ $8K or 180 @ $5.3K. This will give the
person - maybe- more shots at more swans. Perhaps expecting two for 120
positions, or maybe 3 or 4 - or maybe just one. Less of a likelihood of finding
none at all (less likelihood of zero with 120 picks than if "only" 60 picks
were made). Of course some assumptions in here, such that 120 picks are
available with the same criteria that the poster used for the 60.

From what I see so far, for the individual investor to be tied up with 60 or
120 stocks for just this one strategy, doesn't seem practical or worthwhile.
Jmo of course.

as far as the pump and dumpers go it takes all kinds. no one really knows what
the highs are going to be for gold and silver over the next 10 years. My guess
is that when you see lines of people with bags of silverware standing in line
to sell it that will probably be close to the top. years ago i met a couple who
supposedly ran some kind of silver shop in london. when silver rose from $4 to
$50 they sold off all their inventory and retired. I purchased several thousand
dollars worth of silver coins and atb bullion just in case our atm machines and
credit cards stop working for a while. I figure i will always be able to walk
into a family owned store or farm and get food for silver. If I have that idea

EKS, I'm in positive territory overall with my e&p baskets, I believe.

I can't pin down exactly how much. There've been gains and losses taken with my
e&p's in both taxable and non taxable accounts -- I haven't looked at that
breakdown.

In a Roth account I established somewhat over a year ago, I currently have six
e&p stocks in the red. I have one in the green. That one I have a large
position in, and the performance of it, as of today anyway, has exceeded my
losses on the others. In my main taxable account in which I hold most of my
foreign stocks (Canadian/Australian/British e&p's), I show I have 20 e&p stocks
in the red, and 21 in green. (aside: That's some basket, eh. -g-) Looking
roughly, it seems I'm overall a gainer with the e&p stocks that are in this
account. I attribute this to a) a few e&p stocks doing very well -- especially
a couple that I overweighted when I bought compared to others, b) some e&p

Well you got it wrong, it is not like buying lottery tickets, it is about
understanding the structure of uncertainty and see what companies are more
likely to make very big growth.

This quote is the best answer to your common question:

Quote
Middlebrow thinkers sometimes make the analogy of such strategy with that of
collecting "lottery tickets." It is plain wrong.
First, lottery tickets do not have a scalable payoff; there is a known upper
limit to what they can deliver. The ludic fallacy applies here—the scalability
of real-life payoffs compared to lottery ones makes the payoff unlimited or of
unknown limit. Secondly, the lottery
tickets have known rules and laboratory-style well-presented possibilities;
here we do not know the rules and can benefit from this additional uncertainty,
since it cannot hurt you and can only benefit you.

I didn't know INSM particularly would make such growth, and because the prices
were down for so long is proof that nobody else knew either, and that's kind of
edge for me: I seek companies that nobody looks at.

What I do is grade a given company on a scale of 10, the grade demonstrates the
company's exposure to Positive Black Swans.

If you see the portfolio's screen shots you will find that I bought more shares
of INSM than any other company, that wasn't an arbitrary decision.

I will be more direct.

Yes, of course we know it's theoretical, because you didn't actually make the
profit you reported. Because if you actually owned this portfolio and looked at
your brokerage statement you would see you do not in fact have the large profit
the website portfolio indicates for INSM, and you would not be reporting such a
large gain here.

This is how I view it:

You theoretically bought about 22,000 shares 5-5-10 for $1.04. You put this up
in a theoretical portfolio and let time pass. Apparently every time you access
the portfolio, the mechanics of the thing cross multiply the number of shares
you have entered by the stock price. (That stock price being roughly $12 per
share now for the 22,000 shares that were entered. And so the portfolio shows a
gain of $244K for this stock.)

What happened on 3-3-11: There was a stock split. A 1:10 split, according to
Yahoo. That's a reverse split. For every shareholder who had 10 shares before
the split they only have one share after the split. Which means where you had
roughly 22,000 before the split, after 3/3/11 your portfolio should have been
adjusted to reflect that you now have 2200 shares. And that changes the profit
picture considerably.
Whoever or whatever site maintains the portfolio did not account for the
change.

Yahoo did though:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=INSM+Basic+Chart&t=2y

Not sure how a black swan is defined to everyone's agreement. If the stock had
actually gone up 12x in a year ($1.03 to $12), I guess I'd say it would be
unexpected or unusual enough to be a black swan. Doubling or more, that's
common enough to see, and maybe could be predicted from some stocks. For me,
I'd say very nice catch with INSM, but as Yahoo shows, it's no black swan.

the techinicals were telling me to- gfre, apex silver. the other huge mistakes
i ve made investing came out of fear of a small loss overlooking the fact that
I could potentially end up with a large gain simply by patiently holding on.
This is best illustrated by the following: I had an apt in nyc that I sold at a
rock bottom price in order to avoid the expense of paying a 6% sales commision
down the road. as a result i missed out on probably a 1000% return on my
investment. Now at the time it was hard to tell when the price appreciation
would occur but I had already lined up a renter for two years that wuold have
covered all my holding costs when a buyer emerged at the eleventh hour.

Sometimes i can learn from this experience and it enabled me to hold on to most
of my slw despite the huge price appreciation. I plan on doing the same with
many of my other mining holdings. I am willing to hold on to a stock for years
as long the company seems to be moving forward with its plans. while short term
performance can be stressful, its best to grin and bear it and realize that one
if being paid in the stock market to put up with the volatility.

PEG seems to be a favourite parameter to use on SA. Again, not a fan of SA but

u raised an interesting point dan. but i would argue with you that there is
little difference between holding gold and silver and a non dividend paying
common stock. in both cases there is no income and the future value is
dependent upon what someone is willing to pay for it. so i put them into the
same category.

OT I am listening to cnbc and they have been talking about newscorp, now they
are talking about the europe debt crisis and the potential for us unability to
raise their debt level. this all has to be bullish for gold and silver. are
there any good bank anlaysts out there maybe the banks are headed 25% lower ?

You seem to have provided good comments on high yielding instruments such as
preferreds. What is your opinion on telecoms stocks such as AT&T, Deustche
Telekom or Telefonica?

These seem to be good stocks to have for ltb&h but I must say that I would be
uncomfortable buying them at today's price levels. Also, what bothers me is
that there seems to be not much value they can add to their businesses so any
buy would purely be based on the potential dividends once can receive from
them.

Hi Madharry -

Re: Balck Swan positive holding - So you caught one, when do you sell?

I think you summarized it well. So if you eventually caught the long shot
"positive" Black Swan, when do you sell? AAPL is one that comes to mind. If you
were lucky enough to pick up those $7.00 cheap shares in the late 90's, would
you still be holding them now?

One of my all time "positive" Black Swan's that got away was Dry Ships (DRY). I
rode the stock from $9/share to $130/share and then back down to where is
trades now at $4.00/share. I did trade a few shares during that period to more
than break even but it is one thing catching the elusive "positive" Black Swan
stock and another selling it at (or near) it's high.

I guess that is why I try to wrap a "value" framework around each equity I buy.
It provides me a quantitative measure for an entry point as well as an over
value price range to use as an exit point. If I am correct, I should be able to
capture a significant portion of the "meat" in the trade w/o suffering the
consequences of a "negative" Black Swan.

With respect to BAC, it seems that the time table of "muddling through" is what
is coming into question. It's anybody's guess as to how long it will take to
work through their real estate issues. My view is that Bank of America is an
intriguing speculation, but how long it will take for them to recapitalize is
really a call on the economy. My own observations in my locale is that BAC
isn't as aggressive as other banks in disposing of their foreclosures. Wells
Fargo has been very aggressive where as BAC places certain criteria that
requires a potential buyer to use BOA in regard to their short sales. For that
reason, BAC properties seem to linger on the market. This is just my anecdotal
observation for what it's worth. Regardless, tomorrow earnings report should
shed some light on the bank's progress.

My experience has been that Mr. market is smarter than I when it comes to
knowing when the party is over. and ignore what the technicals are saying at my
own peril.
i got spooked out of some of my silver and gold stuff based on Mr. market but I
wanted to be careful. I told the thread here when i thought the technicals had
turned positive again and so far it has been spot on.
I know that as value investor we want to buy when things are cheap and sell
when things are high, but my experience has been that the market tends to be
wildly pessimistic and optimistic at times but also companies also trend to do
things right or wrong and the information that investors get is far from
perfect. So disney and apple established established some incredibly positive
long term trends, that only the tip of which was visible at the time. with
apple the turning point came with i tunes but no one was clever enough to
figure it out fundamentally but Mr. Market did.

OT gold is above 1600 silver above 40 now. the talking heads are talking now.

Hi Faizul -

I own both T and VZ but they are at the high end of their valuation. I like
both for their wireless franchise especially when I see what my friends are
paying monthly for cellular service. I usually sell covered calls on both of
these when their yield falls below 5%.

If you are looking for some good dividend paying stocks that are trading at a
reasonable value that also provide some growth (as well as act as an inflation
hedge) you might look at different REITs. A lot of good ideas are discussed on
the "Dividend investing for retirement thread".

One pretty good dividend yielder that I like is SeaCube Container Leasing
Ltd.(NYSE: BOX)(
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27489673&srchtxt=box ). I
would even classify it as a value stock as it sell at a PE below 10 and has a
forward PE of 6.6 based on analysts next year estimates. It currently yields
around 5.4%. The only negative is the size of their LT debt but this is typical
for companies in this sector. I plan to start an initial buy in the IRA on any
significant sell off and even add shares in the taxable account as I like their
longer term growth potential when compared to it's peers.

A lot depends on if the economy can continue in the mode of slow growth and we
do not double dip into a mild recession. BOX lease contracts are short term
(usually one year container leases) so what might be excellent lease rates
today, next year could be off on both lease renewals and lease rates if the
economy turns sour.

the economic value only matters though if you can sell it to someone else who

Holding gold or silver is not an investment -- on this thread. It can't be, if
this is a Graham-type thread because the holding of these metals (bullion,
coins, jewelry) doesn't "provide safety of principal and an adequate return".

Holding common stocks of gold or silver mining companies, now that might be
different.

re BAC - please notice that the capital buffer is starting to get phased in
(0.5%) in 2016 and the 50B$ number is based on the requirements in 2019
assuming 2.5%). They have 8 years to earn this buffer. Alternatively they can
sell their stake in Blackstone or China Construction bank. They also generate
20B$ in pre-tax operating earnings per year.

According to BAC presentation, they have enough capital to meet the
requirements up to about 2017 right now. Not that it matters right now....

Thanks very much for your great analysis. I like VZ too but as you mentioned,
it is trading quite high at the moment so will wait until there's a dip in the
price. Excellent idea on the selling of covered calls when the yield goes below
5%. I always thought of selling covered calls only when a certain stock has
gained, say 10% or 20% but I guess it can act as an income enhancer as well.

I read in the FT today that shipping is near its bottom as it greatly suffered
during the recession and is due to improve in the near to medium term. It'll be
a shame if the combination of factors we are seeing unfolding before us now
would tip it into a decline again (though if half the things on the plate right
now turn south i guess that'll be the least of our worries!).

Will look at BOX in more detail and thanks for pointing out the thread

all i am saying is that without the stock actually paying a dividend its all a
beauty is in the eye of the beholder kind of thing. a company throwing off cash
flow doesnt matter unless someone is willing to pay to own the company. for a
fictitious example lets just say i own a farm in zimbabwe which is very hi
yielding and the free cash flow is 20% but i cant take any profits out of the
country and there may be limitations on who i can sell it to. what is it worth?
we like to talk about value investments but weve all been in situations where
management or owners have squandered the assets or given it to themselves in
the form of distributions, bonuses and salaries.

Re: Bank of America Corporation (BAC)

This company is still overvalued. Once they mark-to-market their foreclosed and
shadow inventory loans adjust their loans refinanced after 2006 (especially
those that did cash out financing), I figure tangible book is overstated by at
least 60%. If you assume that these loans are overstated by $75K on average and
they refinanced a total of 500K loans during this period (remember they also
carry the CountryWide inventory) that's 37.5B in more write offs.

They are going to need to sell Blackstone and China Construction bank. In fact
they need to break up BAC so that it is not too big to fail. I see it as a
national security thing and there needs to be much more transparency.

Sorry for my rant but I just viewed "Inside Job" and they are all crooks.

http://www.sonyclassics.com/insidejob/

Nothing has really changed especially the people at the top (both inside the
government & the CEO at the big banks,)

If you just scan some of the different county public property records for BofA
and/or ReconTrust ( http://www.recontrustco.com/index.aspx ) you will get a
pretty good picture of how many sour properties are still on their books.
That's only the ones that have been foreclosed on and where title is held in
the banks name or their REO subsidiary ReconTrust. Just as many have yet to be
foreclosed. I continue to watch these properties hit the market every day (they
typically are listed as short sales if listed at all). I am an all cash
investor w/ bids out on several properties but I figure that areas that I am
scanning have another 20% decline before inventory begins to sell.

Here is a link to Clark County NV (includes Las Vegas) search the word "Bank"
in the Last Name" field and you will get a list of all the properties owned by
some "Bank" listed (and/or waiting) to be sold. Many more have yet to be
transferred to the banks. You can scroll through pages and pages of properties.
