Paul, I haven't read the entire thread, but enough to see that you have a good
knowledge of Graham. Forgive me if this question has been asked many times.

What do you think Graham would make of shorting stocks in a market like the one
we face today? Or buying puts? As you or someone responding to you pointed out
Graham was flexible and adapted his methods to the particular market he was
facing.

Twister: Right. I see the ECP. Could be a good investment, and without having
access to Sanborn ratios (and having a belief in Sanborn) or knowing the
industry - I couldn't tell. And right again. With the pe where it is, the price
to book, no div. (I didn't check price-to-sales; this ratio might be affected
by general decline I think in newspaper readership), it has no interest for me.
And generalizing some more - it would be uncommon that I would consider
newspapers which apparently trade on EBITDA or cable companies (is that $/POP
or something?), or some other industries.

And you are right again. I am not so sure I am doing "that well" with value
methods -- Ben Graham or not. For Ben Graham - he said his way was a way to
invest and garner a profit -- he never promised riches. So my "not well" is a
relative term. I invest, my portfolio increases in $, but I own none of the
biggest winners of l998 (I think). So as this year ends, if I had a 12-year old
kid, and he came and said to me -- "How could you possibly not have bought any
of the internet stocks?-- They were all over the place, that's what people want
to invest in, you could have made easy, EASY money and FAST. And you could have
bought almost ANY day in l998 and there were a BUNCH of stocks you could have
chosen. How can you possibly call yourself an investor if you didn't buy
anything internet related? Buying textile companies, oil supply companies,
restaurant stocks, REITs, plus all those other companies that nobody ever heard
about or cares about ---- that is really poor." I have no answer that would
satisfy him.
And if he were 22 and said, "Man, get with the program... Graham died more than
20 years ago. We've gone way beyond what he's done. Nobody who's anybody
invests like Graham says anymore. You don't need internet stocks, but there are
better ways now to invest with the same or lower risk." Again, I have no answer
that would satisfy him.

Twister, two fund managers with whom I have a problem with their investing
choices not IMO meeting their stated style or choice of style are:

Price: especially as relates to his purchase and holding of Sunbeam

Yachtman: One particular stock in his portfolio.

Of course I can not provide you "EVIDENCE". But given the general business
media discussion about how many funds are becoming closet indexers, and the
pressure I think I see for funds managers to show they add value - value that
the fund investor couldn't easily or possibly do for himself/herself - like do
sophisticated accounting or become personally knowledgeable of the top
management - I am suspicious that such stocks are actually selected by the way
the manager states.

A Quick thought on Graham's Techniques

I think the biggest problem with (let's call them) Graham's rules for finding
value is that it is harder to find investments that fit his criteria in today's
environment. There have also been some fundamental business and economic
changes since then. I think the principals are still 100% correct though.

Here is just one example:

In Graham's time, a company bought below its book value (assuming it accurately
reflected the value of the net worth) or a net/net could work out fine if the
company was liquidated. Now that is not the case to the same degree. The
business/worker social contract has changed since Graham's time. When you start
breaking up a company now, there are all sorts of employee packages, golden
parachutes, and other benefits to be paid to workers. So a net/net or
liquidation has to be selling at an extraordinary discount to really be an
outstanding value. Sometimes hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars
go out the door to employees at restructuring time.

A. Roquentin. My opinion would be that Graham would say that short selling is
best left to professionals, and should not be practiced by the small investor.

He might even counsel professionals not to engage in short selling.

Ocassionally we have a discussion here about short selling. (Forget now about
Graham-- his particular methods -- and just think about any kind of valuation
techniques).
The very logical idea is that if stocks are undervalued by our criteria and we
can identify and buy them (then sell them when they go up), we ought to be able
to reverse the process-- we can identify stocks that are also overvalued by our
same criteria, sell them short, and buy them back at a profit. It seems that if
the criteria are any good at all (buy low and profitably sell high), we ought
to certainly be able to reverse it (sell high, buy low). I rise up at that
point -g- and say, WRONG! Short selling is a totally different animal.

My experience is that nobody believes or appreciates this difference though
until they actually try short selling a few times. To me, kind of like thinking
about walking backwards. Seems easy enough to do - just the reverse of what we
normally do-- but it doesn't work out so easily or well when we actually try
it. Paul Senior

Agreed. The principal that you try and buy a $1 of assets for something less
than that is a universal "value" principal. It wasn't only much easier to find
"values" in Grahams day, it was impossible NOT TO. BTW, Graham was, it appears,
a PRACTICAL man and was able to separate the personal from the acedemic. He

Tweedy Browne comes to mind as closest to Graham currently among the
institutions. Since 1983, Graham's methods would seem to have failed us. No
doubt. It would be difficult to operate purely on Graham's relatively simple
methodology in this day and age, especially as an institutional player. All the
best-performing Graham values in the last few years tend to be illiquid with
either small floats or small market capitalization. >1 billion market cap
pretty much rules out the possibility of a Graham value of late. So it may be
hard to find big-name players doing well with Graham, and it is indeed hard to
find it even among individuals. As a result of my journalism, and contributions
to internet discussion groups, I've developed e-mail contact with hundreds of
investors, and I count just three successful Graham investors among them, just
one of whom uses it exclusively. And if I count myself among those three, then
maybe I shouldn't since I do tend to look for Tweedy's variation of Graham,
which includes insider buying after a significant fall in price usually greater
than 50%.

When I started this thread, I took "in the Graham tradition" to mean "let's
stay away from PEG's." So we end up with our variations on the theme of value
investing. Great discussion of late. With financial analysis-challenged people
I know still buying houses and sports cars with their stock market winnings in
Microsoft, Cisco, and now some of the internet stocks, it's hard to argue or
even defend value investing at the neighborhood barbeques. Good to see it still
generates interest out here in cyberspace.

Twister, I would suggest you read Haugen's "New Finance" for
explanations of why these low PB (PE, PS, etc.) stocks outperform,
as well as Dreman's new version of Contrarian Investor. I am
sure I'll be forgetting something, but here are two reaons that I
remember:

1. Most individual investors prefer not to own "dogs," hence
these stocks are undervalued for psychological reasons.
Despite my value leanings, I have experienced this personally.
When I was gifted some KO, I got their annual report and felt
a true sense of pride of being on the winning team. That didn't
stop me from recently selling the KO a few months ago, but it
did actually make me think twice. Moreover, what makes
better party conversation, I bought some AMAZON and it
is going through the roof or I bought a stock at half its
book value and in 2 years I hope to make some money
on it.

Mutual fund managers (i) do not want to have to keep justify
owning these dogs to their shareholders and (ii) are worried
about underperforming their benchmarks from quarter-to-quarter,
while this style of value investing requires a long time horizon
and can underperform for quite some time.

2. The performance of most companies tends to revert to
the mean within a few years, so if you buy cheap companies,
within in a few years you'll have better then even odds of
making decent money as valuations reflect improved company
performance.

As for a Buffet-like "value" approach of buying companies based
on their intrinsic value going out to eternity, I for one have no
ability to do such a forecast and I don't think most analysts can
either (In Contrarian Investing, Dreman has some stats on how
analysts are inaccurate in predicting earnings, and I can't imagine
most analysts forecasting with any reliability the earning for a
company 5 or 10 years out). If you have any pointers, this
would be a good way to diversify my strategy.

Point about SVIN well made! In the annual report for 1997, note 12 under
Commitments and Contingencies states that farmland leases cover 1433 acres with
unexpired terms ranging from 7 to 30 years. If this is part of the 3,600 acres
operated for their own account, then the cost basis for the owned property
(2167 acres) is bumped up to $3,000 per acre, still well below market value. In
estimating this, I have not made any allowance for buildings, so the cost per
acre may be high.

All this talk about "repudiating Graham" is a little much. Warren Buffett has
not "repudiated" Graham, as anybody who saw his discussion of the man on the
recent PBS program would know. What did Graham teach Buffett, and me?
1) Look at an investment as a business which you can value. If you can't value
it, don't look at it.
2) Recognize the difference between investment and speculation.
3) Diversify
4) The key is the concept of margin of safety.

Graham went onto provide a specific way he used to come to a conservative
valuation of a business. Buffett came up with another. Clearly Buffett
disagrees with Graham on number three, but overall, I see Buffett investing AS
PRACTICED BY BUFFETT as being an overlay of Graham, not a repudiation by any
means. It is so much more important to recognize the first and fourth concept -
being able to value the business and to invest at a margin of safety. Those are
things Graham did, Buffett does, and investors like Sanborn certainly do. But
as obvious as these concepts seem, investors who practice them with conviction
are still the small minority of both amateurs and professionals in my opinion.

Do I think that Buffet LOVES his old teacher Graham. I certainly do. Do I think
he learned a thing or two from Graham? Of course. But Buffet is in the
predicament that Einstein found himself in when learning Physics from HIS
teachers, however "great" they were. Graham was indeed brilliant but he also
brought out or enabled the brilliance of Buffet. It was perfect chemistry.
Without a Graham, there would be no Buffet to advance the state-of-the-art.

Long sum-up post, but a happy announcement at the end to keep you reading. :)

***

We're playing with words here. If anybody is saying there is nothing to learn
from Graham to apply to 1998, stand up and speak. I don't think anybody is
saying that, but it seems that is how it is being taken. The way I look at
Graham is how I outlined it in the last post - some big ideas on which I ground
everything I do. Whether I use one valuation technique or another, the thinking
is the same. I value a company by some sound method and buy at a substantial
margin of safety to that valuation.

Where I differ emphatically with many on this thread - and everybody on other
threads - is the logic of valuation. The key is that a valuation technique has
to have the downside in mind, i.e. be conservative. The question to ask is
"what is the least this business could be worth?" That is the question Graham
addressed, and in his own way, that is the question Buffett is addressing if
you read between the lines. That is very different from what a lot of people
who thing they are Buffett investors are doing.

Read the cover story of Barrons this weekend and you will find that the hottest
analyst on Wall Street does no such thing. Morgan Stanley's internet analyst
asks what is the most this stock could be worth if I am right about all of my
assumptions. Graham asked the opposite - what is the least this stock could be
worth if I am wrong about anything I don't know with certainty. If you think I
am setting up a straw man here, read the article. They make her sound like the
next generation Warren Buffett, looking at the long term of the business
fundamentals.

I honestly see no contradiction between Graham and Buffett as I understand
them, let along a "repudiation" of one by the other. I tell people "I am a
Graham/Buffett investor, with a bit of Lynch." Of course I am not claiming
their track record or their ability, only their intellectual influence. (I've
got at least 30 years to go to prove the other two.) I see absolutely no
contradiction between Graham and Buffett, in that I apply the two pretty
fluidly. Its all about which valuation technique I decide to use on a given
stock. Just like if you are measuring, you are going to use a thermometer for
temperture and a scale for weight. The simple fact of both is that you are
measuring. There are many techniques for valuing a company, but not all equal.
The ones I try to apply consistently are the ones that, in Jimmy Roger's words,
"look down before they look up". i.e. they take risk very seriously.

I have said this before, and I'm sure I will say it again. It is incredibly
difficult for me to remember this wisdom when at every family Christmas
gathering I run into a relative who has doubled his money on Dell or Amazon and
wonders why I have a job in the investment business:

Buffett and Graham's fundamental rules of investment. There are only two.
First Rule: Don't lose money
Second Rule: Don't forget the first rule

I often refer to investments as "Graham investments" or "Buffett investments".
For instance, in my way of categorizing, Penobscot was clearly Graham, and
Ambac would be on the Buffett side. Just recognize that the same guy invested
in both, under what he considers a pretty consistent philosophy. I do not wake
up one day and say lets do Buffett and another day lets do Graham. These are
simply two ways to value companies conservatively. Each technique applied
correctly yields very few opportunities in today's market. But the bottom line
is buying "things" - whether they be assets or franchises - for signficantly
less than they are worth OBJECTIVELY.

And that "objectively" concept is what Twister was getting at with Sanborn at
Oakmark. Sanborn is not somebody to take lightly. He has an excellent long term

Buffet, in order to become THE Buffet we know and worship, had to essentially
"unlearn" many of the investment tenets he assimilated from Graham. As he has
said, he had to "escape" from the old ideas. Said another way, he lovingly
"refused to accept" the notion that you had to buy a stock with a certain
dividend yield, or at less than its net working capital, or with a certain P/E
ratio, or any other FORMULAS you can come up with, in order to be called a
conservative investor, or value investor.

James, you made up for your absence with that last post. Nicely done.

Tax Loss Selling

Well it's value investors favorite time of the year. people selling there
biggest lossers for the tax right offs. A couple that may be worth taking a
look at.

RAY Raytech (2 7/8) This is one I've watched for a long time. has been under
bankrupcy protection for something like 10 years, and looks like it has finally
worked out there legal problems. after issuing new stock to settle lawsuits,
will have aprox .42 trailing earning, 1.80 book, .4 p/s, 5.5x cash flow. while
not a net net $5.00 doesn't seem out of line over the next 12 months. May be
early on this one as people will probably dump some of the stock they are
issued in settlement driving price down over the short run.

TXI Texas Industries (27 15/16) one of my favorite companies beaten down from
67ish with steel sector, while is diversifed with Concrete being a big part of
the business. reported 8% better then expected earnings last week. p/e 6, p/s
.53, book 27.31, p/cf 3.6, TXI has also developed a pattended process for
increasing Cement production which not only is reducing it's own costs but is
generating revenues from licensing agreements.

Berkshire Hathaway a Value Now?

In the last week or so Berkshire Hathaway stock has come under enormous selling
pressure as a result of the imminent merger with General Re. General Re was
part of the S&P500. The new merged BRK will not be at this time. This has
forced holders of General Re that are part of/or are trying to mimic the S&P500
to sell their shares of GRN and buy the new addition to the index instead. Due
to the fixed relationship between BRK and GRN stock, they have sunk together.
My preliminary analysis of the merged company suggests that the combined entity
is now selling at a "Look Thru" PE ratio that is very much in line with BRK's
average level over the last few years. It is selling at a discount to the
S&P500 despite a far greater growth rate and many companies with lower risks
that make up the portfolio. I believe the addition of GRN to the BRK family
adds significant long term potential and value to BRK due to size, new
opportunities, cost savings and other synergies. It also positions BRK to take
advantage of a bear market. GRN has an enormous bond/bill portfolio and Warren
is now sitting on a war chest of around of 30 billion. There is little doubt
that as opportunities present themselves, WB will reallocate this portfolio in
higher return securities and increase look thru earnings and value. One might
say that WB is probably praying for a bear market right about now! I believe it
is not a screaming buy at this price. But in this environment it is worth
purchasing as a long term core holding. I have owned the company since 1988. I
added to that position today.

USEC has a contract with the Russians to buy their enriched uranium. USEC does
nothing with it except resell it. The US government set that up to make sure
they don't sell it to Iranians, North Koreans or investors in internet
stocks...This is low-margin business for USEC and they would LOVE to get rid of
it. USEC is operating its factories way under capacity because it is obligated
to take this high cost Russian material. In that sense, if Russia stopped
exporting it, it would be great for USEC.

But its not that simple. If the Russia-USEC contract fell apart and Russia
dumps the stuff on the world market, that would be bad. Not as bad as you might
think because USEC's customers are under long term contracts, but its not
something you want to happen if you own USEC.

To answer your question directly - USEC is absolutely not dependent on Russian
raw materials. I can see how you would get that misunderanding. The situation
is exactly the opposite - USEC wishes Russia and its nuclear material would
disappear tomorrow.

Below 16 I consider USEC a very good long term buy. I paid 14 1/4. The stock is
now at 13 1/4. The dividend yield is over 8%. If you go back in the archives to
about July 20 you will find a very thorough discussion of USEC which there is
no need to revisit now since it is on the record and still very pertinent.

I was about to say exactly what Jim said about USEC. This stock
is so incredibly misunderstood by even sophisticated investors (when
I talked to Rich Dalman portfolio manager and US equity chief at
Salomon, he seemed to be about on par with the Yahoo thread
participants in his understanding of it) that it almost by definition has
to be undervalued. James is absolutely correct - USEC would love to
get rid of the whole Russian deal IF it weren't for the potential
instability that would be either the cause or the result of dissolution
of the agreement. As my USEC contact put it, "We don't like it, but
it is in our interests not to introduce wild cards into the world uranium
market."

My story on USEC is still up on the Microsoft Investor if you search
my name under authors.

Armin, do you care to elaborate on UBB for the thread? I know it's

CRG/RDGE is as much an asset play now as it was since 1st posting and there are
tax loss pieces of these securities available for another week or so. Trading
near cash/share gets you theaters and NOL for almost nothing. Difference now is
that they are much closer to becoming growth play (hence my post to you about
value moving to growth). In our earlier discussions (yr ago??). Company was
primarily cash, no debt, huge NOL and theater franchise in puerto rico and
angelika film center in NYC. Since then they have deployed half the cash (still
have over $65 million at 9/30/98) to build more theaters in PR, begin 2nd
theater franchise in Australia and now with the recently announced City Cinemas
acquisition in NYC build 3rd franchise of over 20 screens in manhattan. As a
result, this coming year should be the first one in maybe over 10-15 years that
Reading (old Reading Railroad) will have operating earnings from a business
rather than a huge cash hoard. City Cinemas deal puts them over 100 screens in
total with another 50 opening in australia this year and almost 30 more in PR
and various US sites this year. Another chunk of screens open in 2000 as well.
Like the retail store model, theater cash flow has recently grown to match the
upfront infrastructure costs to support much larger chain. Incremental theater
profit now will drop to the bottom line. Once the cash is used up there should
be plenty of cash flow to moderatley lever and build big chain or alternatively
upon right price sell PR or manhattan franchises.
CRG is holding company whose majority investors are James Cotter and the Forman
family (pacific theaters). CRG owns controlling interest in Reading
Entertainment (O-RDGE) the operating company where the cash, theaters and huge
NOL exist. Once the NOL is used up at RDGE with Theater profits CRG/RDGE will
undoubtedly merge. Owning CRG is same as owning RDGE, its a matter of relative
pricing and ratios. I like to be where mgmts money is so my biggest interest is
in Craig Corp in its preference common stock (CRG pr). It is economically
equivalent to CRG but for some time it was at at discount to CRG and RDGE so I
accumulated more of it than the other two securities.

Thanks guys .Re: UBB:
Caveats: I have no current financials on UBB so I do not know if they have
suffered trading losses or huge loan losses recently. I am making no
predictions on the economic well-being of Brazil. I do not follow any other
foreign banks as UBB is so cheap if I decide I want more of a bank I will buy
more UBB.

UBB sells at about .5 of my estimate of its current book value. and .3-.4 of
revenues. Most US banks sell at 2-4 times book and 1-3 times revenues. I expect
long term growth at UBB to be much better than at most US banks. Outside of its
profits which I believe are about $4 a share it has raised $1.6 billion in the
past three years- $1.1 billion from stock sales and $500MM from the sale of a
50% interest in an insurance subsidiary to AIG ( not a bad partner). This may
be more than the current market cap of the company. It also has around 2
million retail accounts and a growing web-site which I believe will be a huge
revenue producer and cost containment instrument for all banks if used
properly. This is the story in a nutshell. Brazil will continue to have
problems but I do not see a collapse in the cards and I see UBB as being a
great long term investment (over twenty years) and I would use drops to buy
more if I have the funds and it is a reasonable part of my portfolio. First I
need to buy some USU <g>!

This thread is a fine place, rather unique for the web. I would like to wish
all of you a very merry Christmas and best wishes for the new year.

Thanks to all for the many thought provoking discussions this past year. They
have been very helpful to me in refining my own thinking.

For what it's worth, I still like and hold a lot of Conso International Co.
(CNSO), even though it has gone nowhere. CNSO makes tassels, decorative trim
for furniture, and sewing patterns (all very boring). They had a rough year
from mid-97 thru mid-98, but no losses and the past two quarters have shown
significant improvement. CNSO's price bounces around between $5.50 and $6.25,
with $5.25 being the year's low point. CNSO earns somewhere around $0.90. I
expect CNSO to rebound in the next couple quarters, and will reduce my holdings
if it goes above $10. I know this is a dull value stock, but I think that's
what this thread is all about.

Shane: I added today to DSTM, which is one which might interest you. Datastream
Systems is the market leader of CMMS (computerized maintenance management
software). At around 9, DSTM is at it's low for the year, while the prospects
for DSTM's continued growth appear intact. Take a quick glance, and I'll post
more if it is of interest. This may appeal to you with your interest in ERP
software. (Note: While DSTM is cheap on a relative basis, it is not a dirt

Thanks for mentioning DSTM. I am not familiar with it but will take a look.
It's good that it's not a dirt cheap value stock, because if they ever get that
cheap in the ERP space you know they're probably down for the count. Value is
not the way to invest in ERP.

Is there a good place to get up to speed on CMMS "computerized maintenance
management software" and Datastream's place in the space?

BTW, I now am getting very much into the ERP space. I have held ITWO and ORCL
for a while, and just yesterday opened a position in PSFT. Also recently
entered Checkfree CKFR which will soon fit into the bigger picture. I'm
probably getting close to an ERP index with these investments, and don't want

From:Wright Sullivan

Shane-

A little background on DSTM follows:

(sorry, this runs very long; it's all on DSTM so please skip if not
interested).

Datastream Systems is a local (Greenville SC) company, and Larry Blackwell
(founder/CEO) is known as a very smart and straightforward person.

Datastream is a pure play in Computerized Maintenance Management Systems. What
this means is that they sell software ("MP2" and "MP5") which is used by
manufacturing companies to plan and track maintenance work and parts. Specific
functions of the software include: Work order scheduling; maintenance personnel
scheduling; equipment repair history and reporting; spare parts inventory and
automatic purchasing; asset management; service request processing; statistical
predictive maintenance; and electronic data interchange (EDI) as related to
maintenance costs.

MP2 is Datastream's NT-based client-server product, typically used on a plant
site-wide basis. MP5 is Datastream's Unix-based product for enterprise-wide
installations. An example of an MP5 installation is the multimillion dollar
contract from earlier this year with Southern Company (parent of GA Power &
Light, etc.) for MP5. I do not have any current numbers for the ratio of MP2
sales to MP5 sales. MP2 has been by far the best selling Windows CMMS package
for years.

Datastream mostly sells directly to customers, and more often than not they
also do the consulting work on the installation (i.e. the applications software
as opposed to the packaged software MP2 or MP5), which often runs several times
the cost of the software itself.

Datastream's sales have been growing well, and they have made several overseas
acquisitions of smaller companies in the CMMS business. However, they have been
criticized for their accounting practices of writing off the purchase price of
acquisitions as R&D cost. In my opinion, their handling of these writeoffs has
been very poor, but they have been punished to the point of creating a
significant buying opportunity. The growth thus far has remained intact.

One additional wildcard opportunity: DSTM has a new product, e-MRO, which gives
their software the ability to automatically reorder spare parts (using the
internet, of course), with DSTM getting a cut of something like 2% of each
order. Management is playing down e-MRO, but its revenue impact could be very
significant down the road. IMO, the business-to-business commerce potential of
the internet is huge, and DSTM's software, which already recognizes when spare
parts need to be ordered, is a very logical beneficiary of the internet.

I don't want to put too much emphasis on the e-MRO internet commerce stuff.
With all the internet hype, it's almost a turn-off to hear about a company's
plans being tied to the net. But DSTM doesn't figure e-MRO into their
projections, which makes me comfortable.

What does DSTM have to do with ERP? While CMMS is DSTM's only business, it is
also one of the many "tentacles" that an ERP package such as SAP typically
offers. Unfortunately, the ERP vendors' offerings are typically nowhere near
DSTM's capability. Therefore DSTM could be an acquisition target of one of the
ERP vendors, especially one focused on serving manufacturers.

The CMMS market is nowhere near saturated. I do automation consulting work for
companies who would benefit greatly from DSTM's software, but while all seem
aware of the benefits of CMMS, only a small percentage have really done the
work to implement a complete CMMS program. Most are too busy struggling with
their ERP implementations to focus on reducing maintenance costs with CMMS. But
those costs will be addressed eventually, no doubt about it.

All this and I have still not said much about the numbers. I have not
re-crunched all the numbers since a year or so ago, and all the "R&D"
(acquisitions) make it less than straightforward. But with DSTM around 9 and
their growth continuing, I don't see too much downside and loads of upside. But
as Paul Senior says, "I have been wrong many times before..." (I have kept
pretty quiet since recommending CHKPF-Checkpoint Software-at 30 a few months
back on this board. CHKPF, a firewall outfit, went from 30 to 11 back to 40.
That ain't investing; it's more like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disneyworld).

Bottom line for me is that DSTM is a company which I am comfortable with, a
market leader with strong growth and a relatively low stock price. I welcome
any comments.

My apologies if DSTM does not fit with this board's mission of finding
blatantly cheap value plays. My other local favorite, CNSO, clearly does, but
it's just another cheap microcap, and there are plenty of others in that space.
I like CNSO because it is so simple that even an engineer like me can crunch
the financials with confidence. DSTM's financial numbers are not simple, but
the products and growth are.

No position, JMHO.

A Brazilian bank at half of book value. Hmm. Any read on credit quality. As you
know, banks are leveraged at least 10-1, so just 5% unrecoverable loan losses
wipes out half of book value and 10% is deadly. Any light you could shed on
that issue? It sounds very interesting so far.

And what is its market position? Is this a bank in Brazil or THE bank in
Brazil? Is there a "too big to fail" case to be made here?

And is it an ADR?

Good questions. Not too big to fail IMHO anyway. It is the thrid largest bank
or bank holding company in brazil. You are right about the leverage and that is
one of the caveats-lack of current information about delinquencies and problem
loans- then again this is par for the course when dealing with most banks
unless you have inside information. The other caveat is potential trading
losses- here again I know next to nothing about the banks trading policy. I can
only say that the impression I get from reading the annual report is that they
are conservative from a financial management point of view and expansionistic
from a business and strategic point of view but they purchase assets at a
reasonable cost-so from what I can see I like their management style. The stock
may be depressed because Brazil is going into at least a recession and there
may be concern about growing loan problems, as well as the devaluation risk so
short term be prepared for volatility, but I believe this bank will thrive long
term, if it is not acquired first. Actually it is an ADR symbol UBB and the ADR
represent an interest in the bank and an interest in the bank holding company.
Hope this helps. If you are considering a purchase I would suggest you average
in because of the volatility. I own it at 28,20 and 8!

Are the "Superinvestors of Graham and Doddsville" still beating the S&P 500
--???>

A reader writes:

That list was compiled by Warren Buffett in a 1984 speech he gave to the
Society of Securities Analysts to mark the 50th anniversary of Graham and
Dodd's monumental work, Security Analysis. Buffett entitled his speech, "The
Superinvestors of Graham and Doddsville", an edited version of which appears in
the Appendix to the last edition of The Intelligent Investor. (This is the
derivation of both the title to the GADR thread and the GADR newsletter.)
Buffett offered these examples of Index-beating followers of Graham to show
that Graham's methods were subsequently replicable by others -- not merely
luck, or anomalies of Graham's era.

Thus, you are asking a very pertinent question: 14 years later, are they still
beating the S&P 500?

Irving Kahn, Graham's teaching assistant at Columbia for some 30 years, is
still active, and, last I checked, 92 years of age. I don't know how his track
record has held up over the years.

John Neff, who headed Windsor Fund for the Vanguard Group, retired a couple of
years ago. Vanguard founder John Bogle, Sr., champions the cause of Indexing.
But, not long before Neff's retirement, I noticed that Windsor was one of the
top 4 mutual funds in Lipper's rankings, going back 20 years (so was Sequoia,
at that time).

Schloss Associates is still in business. I don't know if Walter Schloss himself
is active.

I am unfamiliar with the subsequent histories of Perlmeter Investments, FMC
Pension Fund, and William Miller.

Michael Price of Franklin funds retired in the past year, with a reputation as
one of the all-time greats. Though I am not familiar with the details, I am
told that his performance in recent years was not as sparkling as in years
past.

Needless to say, during a span of 16 years of chasing growth-at-any-price, Mr.
Market has not favored the asset plays that Graham's name is most often
associated with.

And in the past few years, the surge of popularity in Indexing, and "shadow
Indexing", has created a self-fulfilling prophecy, causing the Index to pull
ahead of the long-term track records of all but a handful of active fund
managers, regardless of strategy. Rest assured, though, that as a buy-high,
sell-low strategy (i.e., the higher its price, the bigger the portion of the
Index a stock represents), this is one investment fad all but guaranteed to
cool off in the next few years.

Thus, Index-beating Value-based managers will be coming forth in greater
numbers over the coming decades. But, all of the foregoing notwithstanding, I
still think very few investors will actually outperform an all-Index,
all-the-time strategy, primarily because of cost-inefficient diversification,
as well as the vagaries of investor psychology.

Does anyone else have information to add about how these Superinvestors now
stack up?

I have taken a look at the both the spin-off (E&P company) and
the consumer-oriented company created by the merger. I've attached
my notes and estimates below. With a post-merger dividend yield
above 5% and assuming the company meets its restructuring goals,
the consumer-oriented company looks very attractive to me. Assuming
energy prices recover somewhat, the E&P company is attractive.

Regards,
Stew

Merger:
-------

PZL merging with KSF, creating:
- E&P company (called EP below)
- Downstream company (called NEWCO below)

Each KSF shareholder gets 0.82 share of NEWCO.
Each PZL shareholder gets 1 share of NEWCO, 1 share of EP.

PZL has 47.8 million shares outstanding, KSF has
36.3 million.

1 share of PZL includes 1.22 shares of KSF.
0.82 share of PZL includes 1 share of KSF.

77 million shares (company)
$860 million debt (company)
$52 million interest expense (my estimate)
> $1 billion equity (company)
$0.75 dividend (company)

I see trailing EPS around $0.63. The companies say that the downstream
company will see cost saving of $90-$125 million in cost savings
that's an extra dollar of EPS, so then the downstream company begins
to look very interesting. Conservatively, say $1.50 in EPS. However,
on the growth side, the companies are also forecasting low revenue
growth (7%) - this seems low to me. Looking at the company, this isn't
too much different from KSF, so I reverse engineered some ratios to
determine a share price that the market was willing to pay, over the
past few years, for KSF:

Ratio KSF Target Price on NEWCO
P/S 0.5 $21
P/E 16 $24
Div % 3 $25
P/B 1.6 $16+

At time of merger announcement...

The $24 (KSF Price $19.60) is fully-valued in my opinion. The KSF
shares begin to look very attractive in today's market at $15.50
- a dividend yield of 4%. $12.40 is a dividend yield of 5% -
definitely too low a price.

DCR Assigns Initial Ratings to Pennzoil Company

CHICAGO, Sept. 18 /PRNewswire/ -- Duff & Phelps Credit Rating
Co. (DCR) has assigned a rating of 'BBB-' (Triple-B-Minus) to the senior
unsecured debt of
Pennzoil Company (NYSE: PZL - news) and assigned a rating of 'BB+'
(Double-B-Plus) to the
company's preferred stock. DCR also has assigned a rating of 'D-2' (D-Two) to
the company's
commercial paper. These assignments affect approximately $2.2 billion in
securities. The ratings
assume that Pennzoil Products Group (Pennzoil's marketing, manufacturing and
fast lube
businesses) is combined with Quaker State and that Pennzoil Company becomes a
stand-alone
independent exploration and production company.

The ratings are supported by the company's position as a large independent
exploration and
production company that will focus on growing reserves and production after the
anticipated spin-off
of Pennzoil's downstream business segment. Pennzoil has a strong domestic
production profile with
promising exploration prospects internationally. Additionally, approximately
half of Pennzoil's pro
forma debt is exchangeable debt that is convertible into Chevron common stock.
The company
presently owns more than 7.1 million shares of Chevron stock, which are held to
backstop this
exchangeable debt. The downstream segment, which is anticipated to be spun-off
and merged with
Quaker State Corporation [NYSE:KSF - news] in the fourth quarter, will
manufacture, package and
market motor oil, lubricants, a broad range of automotive consumer products and
other specialty
refined products.

Offsetting factors include continued volatile energy prices, fairly high
leverage and the risks
associated with international reserve and production growth. The company will
need to grow its
reserves and production from existing core domestic areas and new core domestic
and international
areas, which will require fairly high levels of capital expenditures.

By issuing preferred stock and restructuring its exchangeable debt, Pennzoil
has reduced long-term
debt by nearly $400 million over the last several months. After the spin-off
and making adjustments
for the exchangeable debt, Pennzoil should have an EBITDA/interest of 3.0 to
5.0 times with total
debt/EBITDA ranging between 2.0 to 2.5 times. Total adjusted debt per barrel of
reserves is
projected to be a modest $1.57 per barrel at the end of 1998.

The remaining Pennzoil Company had oil and gas reserves of 404 million barrels
of oil equivalent at
the end of 1997 81 percent of which was located domestically onshore and
offshore in the Gulf of
Mexico. Internationally, the company is currently producing oil in Venezuela,
has fully carried
interest in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) unit in Azerbaijan, which commenced
production in
late 1997, and has exploration interests in Australia, Azerbaijan, Egypt and
Qatar. 1997 production
of 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was 65 percent gas and 35 percent
oil.

Pennzoil's production costs in 1997 were $4.49 per barrel and, during the last
five years, the
company has replaced 138 percent of its production at a cost of $4.47 per
barrel. Both are in-line
with industry standards. In 1997, however, finding and development costs were
$5.13 per barrel.
This was primarily due to higher exploration expenses partially related to
increased drilling costs.
The company's target is finding and development costs of $4.50 per barrel and
production costs of
$4.00 per barrel.

Merger Announcement
-------------------

Pennzoil and Quaker State to Form Premier Automotive
Products and Consumer Car Care Company

Pennzoil, in Major Restructuring, to Spin-off Products
Company

Transaction Creates $3 Billion Consumer Products Company
and a Leading E&P Company

HOUSTON (April 15, 1998) Pennzoil Company (NYSE: PZL) and
Quaker State Corporation (NYSE: KSF) announced today that they
have entered into a definitive agreement to create a new
publicly-traded company by combining the motor oil, refined
products and franchise operations of Pennzoil with all of Quaker
State. The merger will create a premier worldwide automotive
aftermarket products and consumer car care company, with annual
sales expected to exceed $3 billion.

The transaction is part of a comprehensive restructuring by
Pennzoil that will result in separating Pennzoil's motor oil, refined
products, and franchise operations from its exploration and
production operations. Pennzoil s motor oil, refined products and
franchise operations will then be combined with all of Quaker State
to form a new and yet to be named company.

James L. Pate, Pennzoil's chairman and chief executive officer, said,
"These are major strategic actions and a defining moment in
Pennzoil Company s long and illustrious history. They represent
significant steps in Pennzoil s efforts to maximize long-term
shareholder value. The spin-off of our automotive consumer
products and manufacturing businesses will unlock substantial, but
unrecognized value, create a large, focused independent
exploration and production company, and position both the
upstream and downstream companies for growth."

Herbert M. Baum, Quaker State's chairman and chief executive
officer added, "This merger will create a new and dynamic consumer
automotive aftermarket company, offering consumers a wide array of
branded automotive products and an excellent service
organization. By combining our company with Pennzoil's automotive
consumer products and manufacturing businesses and realizing
substantial synergies and efficiencies, the new company will be able
to achieve growth and returns well in excess of those we could
have generated independently."

The merger is expected to be tax free to Pennzoil, Quaker State and
their respective shareholders and will be accomplished in two
steps. First, Pennzoil's motor oil, refined products and franchise
operations will be spun off to Pennzoil's shareholders. Second,
those businesses and Quaker State will combine in a
stock-for-stock merger.

Pennzoil and Quaker State shareholders will own 61.5 percent and
38.5 percent, respectively, of the newly combined company, which
will have approximately 77.4 million shares outstanding. Pennzoil
shareholders will continue to hold their existing Pennzoil shares
plus they will receive one share of the new company for each
Pennzoil share held. Quaker State shareholders will receive .82
shares of the new company for each share of Quaker State.

Pro forma for 1997, Pennzoil's downstream businesses had
revenues and recurring operating income of approximately $2 billion
and $92 million, respectively. As part of the spin-off, it is expected
that the downstream businesses will have approximately $436
million of long-term debt and $64 million of capitalized lease
obligations immediately prior to the merger with Quaker State.
Quaker State's revenues and recurring operating income for 1997
were approximately $1.2 billion and $64 million, respectively, and its
long-term debt as of year-end 1997 was approximately $429
million.

The merged company will be a leader in automotive consumer
products in North America. It will have strong brand positions in key
product categories, such as motor oil with Pennzoil. and Quaker
State., fast oil changes with Jiffy Lube. and Q-Lube., and car
care products with Slick 50., Rain-X., Blue Coral., Medo.,
Gumout., Fix-a-Flat., Classic. Car Wax and others.

The companies anticipate that the merger will generate cost
savings of $90 million to $125 million annually from the elimination of
duplicate functions, combined purchasing efficiencies, synergies in
distribution and marketing, and streamlining of general and
administrative functions. The resulting company's unique business
mix and geographic strengths will also lead to accelerated
worldwide growth, increased financial and strategic flexibility and
strengthened merchandising. In connection with its program to
generate annual cost savings and record the effects of certain
expenses and other charges related to the spin-off and the merger,
the new company expects to take initial restructuring charges and
incur other one-time expenditures ranging from approximately $150
to $200 million in aggregate.

Mr. Pate will be chairman and chief executive officer of the newly
formed automotive consumer products company, and Mr. Baum will
become vice chairman. The board will consist of Mr. Pate, four other
members appointed by Pennzoil, Mr. Baum and two other members
appointed by Quaker State. A committee consisting of Mr. Pate, Mr.
Baum, one Pennzoil director and one Quaker State director will be
responsible for recruiting a world class marketing executive to be
president and chief operating officer and serve on the new
company's nine-member board.

Separately, Pennzoil Exploration and Production Company will
continue as one of the largest U.S. based independent oil and gas
companies. Pennzoil's oil and gas business concentrates on three
key geographic areas: domestic onshore, domestic offshore and
international. The company is highly focused on its substantial core
domestic asset base and high potential international concessions
that provide a solid foundation for growth. Pennzoil holds significant
exploration and development concessions in Azerbaijan, Egypt and
Venezuela. Over the past five years, operating costs have been
reduced over 25 percent and reserve additions have been nearly
140 percent of production.

Mr. Pate added, "Pennzoil Exploration and Production Company is
well positioned for growth. The company has strong management in
place, led by industry veterans Steve Chesebro' and Don Frederick.
Separating the automotive consumer products and manufacturing
assets from our E&P business will create two pure-play companies
and allow Pennzoil's shareholders to realize the full value of each
business. The combination of our downstream businesses with
Quaker State significantly enhances the benefits of the restructuring
to Pennzoil's shareholders. This transaction continues the program
Pennzoil has followed for the past several years to streamline our
businesses, improve earnings and cash flow, and maximize
shareholder value.

"Both the new consumer products company and Pennzoil
Exploration and Production Company will have their own securities
for use in financing growth through acquisitions, with the market
having the flexibility to value Pennzoil Exploration and Production
Company on a cash flow basis and the new consumer products
company on an earnings basis.

"Quaker State has made significant progress under Herb Baum in
repositioning the company, expanding its consumer products and
strengthening its flagship brand. I look forward to working with Herb
as this new car care company takes a leadership position in the
automotive after-market industry," Mr. Pate said.

Mr. Baum said, "This is an exciting opportunity for the shareholders
of Quaker State and Pennzoil to create a premier car care
consumer products company in the U.S. Together we will offer
consumers a full range of high quality automotive products and
services building on our strong national brands, solid franchisee
and distributor relationships and the growing consumer demand in
the automotive products market. The combined company will
achieve significant synergies and allow us to operate our overall
lubricants and lubricants services businesses more efficiently,
creating greater value for our shareholders and superior service
and products for our consumers. Additionally, our branded
consumer automotive products group will be the most complete
aftermarket branded products company in North America.

"Over the past four years, Quaker State has achieved a solid
turnaround through improved operating efficiencies, marketing and
brand management and targeted acquisitions. We are now well
positioned to take this next major step for growth and increased
profitability, which this transaction will make possible. Quaker State
employees, who have been the backbone of our success, will be
treated fairly and equitably," Mr. Baum continued.

The annual dividend of the newly combined company will be 75
cents per share, and the annual dividend of Pennzoil Exploration
and Production Company will be 25 cents per share. After
completion of this transaction, Pennzoil shareholders will continue
to receive a total combined annual dividend equal to Pennzoil's
current annual dividend of $1.00 per share. The annual dividend to
Quaker State's shareholders on their shares in the new automotive
aftermarket products and consumer car care company will
represent a 54 percent increase over Quaker State's current annual
dividend of 40 cents per share.

The merger is conditioned upon the approval of Quaker State
shareholders, receipt of certain tax rulings and a
Hart-Scott-Rodino review. The companies anticipate that the
transaction should close in the second half of 1998. The
transaction will be accounted for using the purchase method.

Lehman Brothers Inc. is acting as financial advisor to Pennzoil on
the combination of its products group with Quaker State, and
Lehman Brothers Inc., Evercore Group Inc. and J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. are acting as financial advisors to Pennzoil on its
restructuring. Chase Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are
acting as financial advisors to Quaker State.

Pennzoil Company explores for and produces crude oil and natural
gas, manufactures and markets premium quality lubricants,
including America's top selling motor oil for the past 12 years, and is
the parent company of Jiffy Lube International, the world's largest
franchisor of fast oil change centers.

Quaker State is principally a manufacturer and distributor of leading
consumer aftermarket products and services, including motor oil
and a full-range of high-quality automotive treatment, appearance,
accessory and air freshener products.

Pep Boys is an interesting case of exactly what you pointed out. A company with
an excellent historical track record, a well-known brand name, and a very cheap
price relative to its history. I looked at it in the mid-20s, I looked at it in
the high teens, and I was shocked at how low it got, but never bought it. Why?
I wanted to, but every time I dug into it, I could find no reason to buy.

The franchise appears to be broken - i.e. new competitors and no more room to
grow in their core business - and management has no answer. So that tells me to
take the historical track as...history. When I look for what protects me on the
downside, there is no meaningful asset value, no meaningful dividend yield.
Management is questionable. But the stock is so far out of favor with Wall
Street that there may very well be something there, but on the other hand,
nobody seems scared enough for it to be a steal. A takeover candidate? Who buys
them? The most likely candidates probably would face anti-trust problems.

Whether you call it a value stock or a dog, it is simply not what I am looking
for, which is a fat pitch right over the plate. None of the valuation tools I
use fit this situation - maybe there is another tool by which somebody else
could have confidence in PBY as real value. Call me neutral.

Yes, I'm familiar with AZO.
- AZO is selling at 3.9 times book value. PBY is at 1.16 times book.
- AZO's PSR is 1.46 while PBY's is 0.42.
- AZO is selling for 15.7 times cash flow while PBY is at 12.3 times cash flow.
- AZO's dividend yield is 0.0, while PBY's yield is 1.7%.

I agree that AZO is probably financially a much better company than PBY. Is it

I2,

Autozone is _not_ a value stock, and I meant to say that in my first post.
Sorry if I didn't spell that out. What I'm saying is that it helps me to look
at the business first, and then determine how much I'm willing to pay. This is
a different process from finding what is cheap and buying it.

Example: Do I want to be in the auto parts retail? Probably not, but if I did
Autozone would likely be my preferred company (based on a quick look its
numbers - margins, debt,, ROE, etc - are so much better than PBY.) I'd then
determine how much I'd pay for Autozone. This is more of a Buffett approach,
but I think some value investors may evaluate opportunities in this way.

I shouldn't comment on value stocks and dogs. I have not had good luck with my
value investments, so they're pretty much all dogs to me <G> :-)

Well, looking at two sectors highlighted as being in the dumps recently, health
care and REITs, with insider buying.

I've taken an interest in Vencor (VC), an acute and long-term care operator,
and am digging deeper. I dealt with them as a physician in Memphis, and really
appreciated what they have to offer - getting the patient out of the hospital
despite having significant medical needs, even a ventilator. A fraction of book
and a fraction of sales, they're 2 billion+ company trading at less than 300
million, with negative earnings currently. They are moving to a prospective
payment system which can be good, I'm digging into it. Signs of a management
turnaround, with one old geazer supposedly leaving. Just seems extremely cheap
with longstanding insider buying at this level, but I'm looking into the
payment system right now.

Interesting aspect of Vencor is it's real estate assets, and there's a big
proxy for distribution from March which I haven't gotten through yet. Jim, do
you know this one?

Also looking again at LaSalle Hotels. I bought and sold in less than a week
when it jumped from 8. Jim, any updates on this one at less than 11 now?

Sorry slow on the reply here regarding DSTM.

<< Is it not hard for a small company like this to compete internationally ,
especially if they do most of the consulting themselves? Also how do they fare
competing with much large companies who offer a full line of services? >>

Over the last couple years, DSTM has become very well fortified
internationally. They have purchased competitors in England and Germany. They
purchased their distributor in Australia/NZ (continuing their preference to
sell directly to the customer). They also purchased a smallish CMMS outfit in
Brazil, taking advantage of recent financial uncertainty there.

Basically, DSTM is a niche player. They are the market leader for maintenance
management software, and they offer consulting in the
installation/implementation of that software.

The major negative is competition from ERP companies who view CMMS as a small
piece of a larger problem. Thus far that has not affected DSTM's growth. If it
does, then I would expect DSTM to seek to be acquired by one of these
companies. But I do not expect that to happen soon.

In the meantime, there is a major need for CMMS in industry. In order for
companies to run lean support staff, their maintenance operation must be
automated. And at this point, very few are (I know this from my work).

DSTM offers software packages which cover the gamut from a five-person shop
needing to get organized, all the way up to a huge corporate maintenance
operation. Very few ERP vendors have this breadth or experience. And
maintenance is traditionally a low-budget area, making it less desirable for
the big ERP players. But DSTM knows how to make it profitable.

I hope this is useful. I think DSTM is a good company at a good price.

Micheal,

On Vencor: See an interesting recent Wall Street Journal front page article
(Dec 24th) that discusses the problems they've run into with retirement homes
and the govt. Sorry I can't provide a link, I just have the paper copy.

That's quite an article. This stock certainly smells. Sounds like a do-gooder
social worker trying to get back at the company though (yes, social workers can
be bitter about all kinds of things). And sounds like Vencor is going to get
worked by the Justice Department (yes, it would work over any long-term care
facility it investigated, because medicare abuses are pretty much there
everywhere if you look for them). So it's excrement. Is the price right? Can I
categorize the risk? Holding my nose and digging deeper...

FWIW, I bought into Timberland today. I'm wearing Timberland on my feet and on
my back, and thought I'd look at the stock, and it was kind of a no-brainer.
Low multiple of earnings, a strong consumer franchise, still improving margins
and growing profits despite the slump. High ROE, 1.5x book, 1/2 of sales. Only
30% of revenues from abroad, and abroad is higher margin; room to grow I think,
and that doesn't seem figured into the price.
Thanks Shane,
Mike

In my recent quest to differentiate "value stocks" and "dogs," I ran
accross the following food for thought. Notice one of my favorites
at the bottom of the list.

Industry Company/Ticker P/E

Air Transport US Airways Group U 5.6

Apparel Prod Liz Claiborne LIZ 10.9

Base Metal Ind USX X 5.0

Brokers/Dealers Lehman Brothers Holdings LEH 7.3

Business Services Modis Professional Services MPS 5.1

Health Services HealthSouth HRC 16.9

Industrial Mach Case CSE 4.3

Oil & Gas Svcs Tidewater TDW 4.4

Real Estate Rouse RSE 8.4

Maybe I'm confusing "value investing" with "contrarian investing,"
what do you think?

I don't know Vencor, though I probably should.

LaSalle I still own. I just spoke with the CEO last week and he tells me the
business is far less volatile than the stock. The hotel business is not what it
was six months ago, but its still doing just fine. You may have read that any
discretionary new hotel construction just stopped cold in August.

re: Timberland

I was doing some after Christmas shopping at my favorite factory outlet, a
great property in Flemington, NJ owned by Chelsea (CCG), an excellent company
anybody with interest in REITs should take a long look at.

Chelsea knows retail and they know where to place their tenants in order to
draw traffic. When you come out of the parking lot, the first thing you see is
signage for their two gateway tenants. Polo Ralph Lauren and Timberland. Both
stocks are trading at interesting valuations, and both stores were packed.

And two of mine are on that list, Case and Tidewater. I ran through the others
and found lots of problems with them. Where was this list? I wrote the stocks
down on a notepad, but don't remember where I got them from. VO, ARW and LIZ
are the others I'm looking at. Especially VO. Hopefully I'll grab it at the low
20's when the market crashes.

Actually, I read through the Fool's Boring valuation of Berkshire, and think
it's worth the read too:
http://www.fool.com/BoringPort/1998/BoringPort981228.htm

I think it's as good as mine or anyone else's effort has been to value the
thing. I'm still not buying Berkshire here though. Succession plan or not, I
need an additional discount for the hit the stock will take the day Buffett

May have been brought up here before but I'm about to buy The Finish Line
(FINL) at 7 and change. Below book, fraction of sales; no debt, $2 in cash.
Yeah it's a specialty retailer, and yeah it's shoes, but this is a contrarian
play after all. Insiders haven't bought big yet. The fool featured it in
trouble: http://fnews.yahoo.com/fool/98/12/15/trouble_981215.htm

This stock is stumbling but inventory management and operations are improving;
price cuts and promotions are going to cut earnings, so the PE is optimistic at
best. This doesn't look like a company that is going away, and the NBA strike I
think is hitting it with an unfair double doozy. With these ratios (yes, I'm
using Graham's ratios), I can't pass it up. A candidate for tax-loss selling, I
think, with the potential for a January run.

I am switching my focus to larger cap names for the time being until the
deswells of the world take off. I have just purchased Motorola. I do not know
if this qualifies as a value stock, certainly not by the G_D criteria, but my
criteria were the stock has not appreciated in value in two years, sells at
1.24 times sales and recovery is anticipated in its major markets. Comments?

I think Motorola is one of Phil Fisher's "permanent" holdings. I remember an

perhaps - saying that he held MOT for years and years and would continue to do
so.

Small caps are underpriced vs large caps with a larger disparity than I've ever
known. The relative PE ratio of small caps to large caps is historically low
when it gets around 1, since small caps typically grow faster. And it hit a low
of 1.04 or thereabouts in the early 90's. Now it's like 0.7 or something like
that. The market is putting a huge premium on the biggest names in these times
of global uncertainty. Small caps have underperformed since 1994, and the
Russell 2000 is down this year, while the Nasdaq 100 is up over 80%. I just
can't help but think I would be late to the party if now I finally started
buying the big caps.

Well, I bought some Finish Line and some LaSalle Hotels today, doubled down on
Deswell again. Shoe retailers, REITs, shoe manufacturers, oils, metals, foreign
contract manufacturers - I'm really buying the excrement of the market now.

And what am I selling? I shorted Amazon.com today at 337 and change. Very few
shares. On principle. As a blue-blooded contrarian I just couldn't sit idly by
anymore.

et tu, Micheal? I posted this on another thread before I read that you
front-ran me. :)

I am going to make a call here in real time that might really embarrass me
later, but if I'm right I want it on record. Short a basket of internet stocks
tomorrow. Is there a way an individual can take a position short on some sort
of internet stock index? I know it is a different kind of risk, and may even be
impossible to short some of these stocks individually, so that's why I'm asking
the question. Whether I get an answer or not, this is my stand.

I have not said this before as I watched these stocks go from the expensive to
the ridiculous to the extorionate valuation levels. I am no expert on shorting
stocks (so kids, don't play this at home...) What I do know about it is that
valuation is not enough. There has to be some notion of timing. So I've been
waiting and waiting through the Christmas season, as the stocks doubled again,
for one simple news report that would mark the top. That came yesterday when we
heard that Christmas internet sales were up 300%. That was precisely the signal
I was waiting for and it was very frustrating today not to know an instrument
to put the money on the table. Also, for another signal of a top, I might note
the fact that the "e-tailing" trend has been a recent cover story on virtually
every major business and news magazine. And we all know the valuations.

I am not stick in the mud - I am a regular customer of Amazon and AOL, and
clearly I know what the internet is if I'm here. But at some point you've just
got to say this is insanity.

I expect to be ridiculed profusely if I'm wrong on this one. I may not be able
put money up on it, but if I can find the right instrument I probably will. Any
help?

I like the "blue blooded contrarian" comment, Mike - shorting Amazon today is
an act of principle, comparable to taking to the bayonet when you've ran out of
bullets against the heathen infidel.

Assuming I am someday going to become a crotchety old value investor telling
stories about the 1998 top ( :) ), how could I tell that story without a part
about either making a few bucks or losing a few bucks shorting these stocks.
Its like when my generation asks our parents "what did you do in the 60s" - you
don't want to hear that they watched it all on the news! This is why God
created play money.

then buy puts on it.

I can think of three events that together could mark the top. 1) what you said.
2) the guy who said amzn would go to $400 (in a couple years) and then have it
ALMOST happen in a month 3) A certain someone showing up on Buffetology telling
us to "look out for that Internet thing."
