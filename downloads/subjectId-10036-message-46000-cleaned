Re: Xylem (XYL) 

Thanks. I hope my analysis is somewhat correct on XLS.

Regarding XYL, I looked at it very briefly. It looked like it was trading at
around the average PE multiple of competitors. Also from reading a few blogs,
it seemed to be preferred to ITT and XLS. Also I think it received a less than
glowing analysis on this thread. So it didn't hit me over the head as looking
like a bargain priced opportunity. Furthermore, I read that it replaced ITT in
the S&P500 with ITT and XLS being consigned to the S&P400 midcap. So I
concluded that made it less likely that it was potentially mispriced. I recall
reading about a study that determined that stocks that were added to the S&P500
subsequently underperformed and those that were removed went on to outperform.
So based on those few filters I didn't research it any further.

Re: Investors Real Estate Trust (NasdaqGS: IRET )

You might look at IRET for an apartment play. This is a small regional APT.
owner located in the Midwest. I selected them as they were the largest REIT
Apartment operator located near the U.S. shale fields. The company generates a
good dividend from their free flow cash ( elected to have my dividends

You can read some of my posts on the Dividend Investing For Retirement thread (
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27441189 ).

The company recently cut their dividend and although they are have low vacancy
rates, the stock is closer to lows than highs. They have been building their
available inventory buying properties as reasonable "value" prices.

For me it is the location of their properties. Maybe another view might be good
regarding their financing (too much leverage), debt structure, or any other
value consideration I might have overlooked.

Oracle Is Oozing Value

By TERESA RIVAS / Barrons / Dec 21, 2011

Though the business software giant's stock plunged to near a 52-week low on
weak earnings and a tepid forecast, we spy a buying opportunity.

Investors are fleeing Oracle, as they foresee little growth following a
disappointing quarter and weak guidance.

After Tuesday's market close, Oracle (ticker: ORCL) reported fiscal
second-quarter earnings of $2.19 billion, or 43 cents a share, up from 37 cents
a share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, adjusted earnings per share
rose to 54 cents from 51 cents, below the 57 cents analysts were expecting.
Revenue grew 2% to $8.8 billion, below expectations of $9.2 billion. Projected
revenue growth of $8.9 billion to $9.25 billion was also below the consensus of
$9.46 billion.

Shares of Oracle were down 13.3% to $25.30 on the news, close to their 52-week
low of $24.72.

The quarter, which ended Nov. 30, was not pretty, and guidance shows that
Oracle has a difficult road ahead; however, trading at less than 10 times
forward earnings, it's a cheap bet that the worst is over.

The bad news "will effectively de-risk Oracle shares going forward," writes
Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund, who reduced his target price from $34 to $32.

While there was some good news in the quarter--including acceleration of
Exadata and Exalogic, expanding margins, a strong pipeline of products and
growing sales capacity--it was eclipsed by a macroeconomic-induced slowdown of
corporate tech buying, as well as currency headwinds and poor execution.

A slowdown in information-technology spending is of course beyond Oracle's
control, but it has been taking steps to streamline its internal processes to
avoid a repeat of the problems that plagued this most recent quarter.

Moreover, if a modest pullback in tech spending is the main bugaboo, Oracle may
suffer, but smaller competitors will pay the real price: "The software industry
is a game of scale, meaning that the largest vendors can develop new products
at lower cost per customer due to their large global customer bases and…like
most other industries [it] will consolidate as it matures, as thousands of
global software vendors are acquired or go out of business to form a "big
three" industry structure that is dominated by a small number of very large
vendors," writes Piper Jaffray analyst Mark Murphy.

Even if its plan to transform into a one-stop hardware and software shop for
companies has been choppier than hoped, a spending slowdown would likely hamper
rivals more severely, allowing for increased market share and even inexpensive
acquisitions.

While Oracle certainly has some soul-searching to do, it simply appears too
cheap, especially with its 0.8% yield, double-digit margins, and a 25% return
on equity. ThinkEquity analyst Brian Schwartz finds the stock attractive at its
current level, "a similar trough valuation multiple Oracle experienced in March
2009, even though the present business is 60%+ larger and more profitable."

Ultimately, the next couple of quarters will likely be challenging for Oracle,
as it overcomes concerns related to this shortfall and deals with the
ever-changing economic landscape and its effect on corporate IT budgets.

Yet it seems hard to turn down such a cheap bet on a best-in-class name with
attractive defensive attributes, especially as its longer-term prospects appear
intact.

Clownbuck, thanks for the view from Europe. I am still looking to buy

I still hold a few shares of Pargesa (PRGAF.pk). Based on your comments here
about its possible structural changes, I'm a reluctant holder, and I'm not
willing to add more to my losing position. Instead, I have been buying directly
some of the component companies that they own.

I'm also holding a small losing position in utility RWE AG. Not sure what to do

RWE raised some capital a few weeks ago. I think it is at least a hold here.
The German and I suspect the whole European car market is tough right now, the

F;_ylu=X3oDMTExYzFvNTI2BHBvcwM0BHNlYwN5ZmlUYWJsaXN0BHNsawNkZXRhaWxlZA--

Did some more house cleaning today selling a few more of my higher priced SVU
shares at $8.05/share. My last Buy was 8/24/11 where I doubled up my position
at $6.84/share. Still underwater on 15% of my shares but I believe the company
has long term value. As long as they continue to generate FCF, pay down their
debt and operate their very profitable logistics subsidiary, they should book
adequate earnings and maintain their generous dividend. SYSCO has been eyeing a
company to buy that will help them grow their business, and SVU's logistics
(distribution & warehouse operations) division has been mentioned as a possible
acquisition candidate. That is worth at least $3.50/share IMO. Will add to my
core SVU position in 31 days if I can buy in the low $7.00/share range and no
new negative news occurs.

The news for RAM was quite positive with the stock up 83% on the day. Took a
little off the table and want to scale down this position as it is now
represent 8% of my E&P basket. I would like it to be a 5% position. The deal
increases the share count from 80M to almost 280M but $270M of new capital is
added to the common share equity base with another $275M in convertible notes.
The total equity dilution is only around $0.25/share and the new capital should
allow them to develop their oil fields in Oklahoma and Texas. If/when the
convertible notes are converted another 110M shares will be added to the pot
that will further dilute the shares base perhaps by another 25%. There was no
mention as to how they would calculate the conversion amount but RAM really did
not have many options for raising the necessary capital to develop these wells.
The real kicker to the deal is the former CEO of Petrohawk Energy, Floyd
Wilson, will become their new chief executive. He brings a lot of experience to
the company, has a big bet that they will succeed ($550M) and the RAM
shareholders have a seat on the bus. I plan to hold onto at least 50% of my
shares to see how this ride turns out.

* Has no plans to buy more in next 12 months
* Does not rule out buying more if opportunity arises (Adds comment,
background)

What do you know about SGL Carbon. They seem to trade only on the Frankfort
exchange SGL CARBON (Dusseldorf: SGL.DU ). BMW must think they are doing
something right to up their holding to 15.7%.

Does SGL Carbon own a specific market niche? Are the world wide or just am
important part of what BMW plans for the future. Seems like a big bet by BMW if
they didn't have other intentions to JV with the company.

Peeled off 13% of my MHR shares (representing 70% of my highest cost shares)
for a small gain. The company told the market that their 2012 production
estimates were too low and raised them by 15%. Stock up 18% on the news. Great
opportunity to take my profits on shares bought in August 2011 and lower my
overall cost basis by selling out my high priced shares.

Oil at $101.46 per barrel and time to peel off a few shares of the E&P
inventory (learning from the run up last year). On prices above $105 and $110
per barrel, I plan to peel off a few more shares from the basket.

My top tier E&P companies (in my basket) are moving a bit higher; DEJ, SSN,
RAM, & LEI. All continue to have good value in them based on land owned, debt
profiles and BOEP flowing and expected in 2012.

My E&P basket finally turned positive based on my initial acquisitions started
in 10/2010. It's been underwater for the last 6-8 months even as oil has turned
higher.

already have either a nice dividend increase if the stock doesn't get there, or

I have added this one to my Oil & Gas watch list. Debt profile is ok but a
little high for me w/ LT debt at 10x their annual net income. What concerned me
a bit more was the insider trading. No conviction by management to step up and
buy shares and hold. It seems every time their options vest, they sell out even
near the lows.

The company has good geographical coverage all over the world but also could be
seen as possible political risk. Offshore platforms (to me) are not as
susceptible to invasion/destruction as onshore wells.

I do like that they bring value to shareholders as the owners/operators of the
drill ships that generate good margins for the company.

Their almost 3% dividend is a plus for me.

MHR article.

Preface: I continue to have my doubts about my valuation criterion for $ per
flowing barrel (of oil -- bopd). A metric on which I sometimes make buying
decisions. I intend eventually to get some assistance/feedback from some of the
more knowledgeable SI posters on the e&p threads. I understand of course that
valuation includes more, sometimes much more, than only flowing barrel
evaluations --- like the value of the lands held, 1pnav, eps, etc.

Regarding the author's comment, "At 75,000 per flowing barrel this should be
fairly conservative." There is what "should be" and then there is what actually
"is". There is no way that I see that $75k is a conservative or realistic
number now for $ per flowing barrel. And I'm talking barrels of oil. Not
barrels of oil equivalent (i.e. including gas production) that the author is
using. That $75k number is way too high for bopd let alone boepd -- to me it
seems obviously way too high. Which brings me to wonder about the rest of the
author's valuation analysis.

That said, I believe MHR is undervalued. I have shares, so I'm hoping the
company and stock do well. The stock's down from the beginning of the year. The
way people have made money in it this year is to have traded it or by buying at
the big drop(s) (e.g in Oct.). I'm guessing that fluctuations may continue, and
I can rebuy my sold shares at a lower price than currently.

Jurgis,

I thought i use to be your favorite RIMM bear.

I suppose its been a long time since i posted.

Time for this value bear to come out of the woods.

RIMM will be an interesting battle ground over the next year or two. IMO it has
two options:

- Turn focus to creating cash flow

- Increase R&D and swing for the fences for growth

This management seems oblivious to the first and favors the 2nd option.

-Year Ending 2010 (Feb 11) had Net Inc of $3.5 billion

-Income after R&D was $1.5 billion (Pretax 4.6 billion)

-TTM Net Income Nov 11 to $1.4 billion.

From the Margin of safety prospective using conservative estimates:

-2012 Operating Income of $2.5 billion (assuming R&D cut about $1-2 billion in
R&D i.e. giving up)

-$500mil to $1bil can go to maintenance.

-Est of pret-tax income of $4 billion and after tax cash flows of $3.5billion.

Assuming you could further create cash flows for next 5-7 years losing 25% of
your loyal crackberry base each year using tax rate of 25% and cost of capital
at 10% you get a value of about $8.5 billion on a free cash flow basis.

Its current market value of about $7 billion and enterprise value of $6
billion, that makes RIM look very cheap and have a margin of safety by about
$2-2.5 billion

It looks cheap on the surface, but i think this is where RIMM will not be
pro-shareholder and continue to try and keep up with the Jones'. Actually after
skimming through its latest conference call they are emphatic about not return
cash to shareholders and will continue to keep spending on R&D, paying app
developers, even acquiring (yuck!). If that happens you can throw the
conservative estimates out the window, they could easily spend 2-4x that trying
to save the ship. (though we could see some activist get involved) I would
stick my money else where. But just my opinion

ConocoPhillips (COP) - peeled off a few shares
LSI Corporation Common Stock (NYSE: LSI) - closed position held since 10/1998
Ship Finance International Limi (NYSE: SFL) - Sold higher priced shares to book
year end loss

Peeled off a few shares of COP from purchase from 12/2009 @ $50.87. I
originally bought these shares when Buffet was selling off his very large
position. I am selling a very small amount as I am way over weighted and need
to balance the position in the portfolio. I calculated the "Graham Number"
which is a measure of fair value:

Graham Value Number = Square Root (22.5* earnings/share*BV)
Square Root(22.5 * $7.80 * $49.56)
= $93.26

Therefore COP is still 28% undervalued from its current price of $72.68 based
on the calculated Graham Number of $93.26. My other big integrated oil position
in CVX. These are my No 1 and No 2 holdings in the portfolio. The Graham Number
for CVX is $135.78. That is 27% undervalued from the current price of $107.19.
Maybe I should peel off some of those shares too.

Other sales represent year end house cleaning. Gave up on my LSI shares. Never
reached the earlier price over $60.00/share. These were left over shares hoping
to see those prices again. Closed them out for a small gain. My big looser this
year is SFL. Hopefully they continue their dividend and shares recover. My
average cost is just a tad higher but I have shares at much higher prices too.
The company was impacted by FRO (a sister company that SFL has helped w/
financing their ships).

More on Graham's Number

<img src='public/342737_a247d4f6ca7ca0eb877e3e2dd36baf62.gif'>

I was trying to figure out how he derived "22.5" in his valuation formula. Here
is a pretty good explanation

The Graham Number
http://www.dividends4life.com/2008/06/graham-number.html

From the article: "..The 22.5 is a little more involved. Graham believed that
the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) should be no more than 15 and the
price-to-book value ratio (P/B) should be no more than 1.5. He did note that a
P/E ratio below 15 could possibly justify a higher P/B ratio. Thus, he used as
a general rule of thumb that the product of the two should not be more than
22.5 (15 x 1.5). <u>That is how the 22.5 is derived (15 x 1.5). The 15 P/E is a
result of Graham wanting his portfolio to have a yield equal yield to that of a
AA bond. Over long periods of time, AA bonds have yielded 7.5%, on average. The
inverse of this yield is 1 divided by 7.5%, or 13.3 (rounded up to 15) became
the target P/E ratio for his portfolio..</u>.."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It's an easy number to calculate and should provide a good sell target number.
His number is weighted for more normalized interest rates @ 7.5%. Therefore,
one could make the argument that the 22.5 factor could be as high as 30 which
would reflect an AA bond interest rate of 5%.

A higher factor like 30 (reflecting a lower AA bond rate like 5%) results in a
higher fair value price. When I calculated Graham's number for COP I get the
following results:

You can get BV here: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=COP+Key+Statistics
You can get Earnings here: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COP
If you want to look at next year earnings and/or analysts estimates look here:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=COP+Analyst+Estimates (Note: for COP 2012
Earnings are $8.42 avg for 21 analysts)

Using a 22.5 factor = Graham's No. $ 93.00
Using a 30.0 factor = Graham's No. $107.00

Current share price: $ 72.87

Using Next Year Analysts Estimates of $ 8.42/share:

Using a 22.5 factor = Graham's No. $ 96.90
Using a 30.0 factor = Graham's No. $111.80

My take away from this is with the unusual low interest rate environment, fair
value for most of these Graham stocks (PE<15 Price/BV <= 1.5), a high Factor
s/d be used resulting in a higher fair value "Sell" target. Some of my sample
calculations show that up to another 15% in price would reflect a fair value
price. I guess I need to let those prices run a bit higher.

I find many media authors' use of the Graham number to be too generous,
resulting in two things: First, a large number of stocks seem to qualify that
otherwise don't seem to meet my criteria for value. And secondly, that the fair
value calculations result in fair values that seem extraordinarily large
compared to current stock price -- sometimes to the extent that the fair value
number exceeds any price the stock has ever come close to.

I'll point out a couple of ways in which the stocks qualifying and their Graham
fair number might be reduced.

Intelligent Investor ('73 edit.) , p. 182: "Price no more than 15 times average
earnings of the past three years"

Defensive investor use of the formula, p. 185: no deficit in company's ten year
record.

Defensive investor use of the formula, p. 185: a long history of continuous
dividends (Referring back to p. 181, I presume that to mean "Continued
dividends for at least the past 20 years")

That ought to cut down the number of qualifying companies -g-.

-------------

I suggest what you want - if we're talking Dr. Graham -- is that if the AA bond
rate is 5%, that the earnings yield should be no more that that also.
(Reference p. 186). Earnings yield being earning/price or reciprocal of the
p/e. So p/e to be paid should be no more than 20 in a 5% AA bond environment.
(1/20 =.05 = 5%)

I never really screened using the Graham number but now I plan to use it . GLW
gets a $25.64 value (current price $12.90), ABB GN is $14.37 (current price
$18.82) and SI GN is $97.26 (current price is $95.95).

These are some of the companies on my buy list. According to the GN screen, GLW
should be a screaming buy at current levels. I have never seen ABB sell as low
as the Graham Number fair value suggests and SI is just at fair value that
should probably be bought at lower levels.

I guess the key is that it is just another tool to help one confirm a Buy or a
Sell but should not be used as an exclusive screen.

with 10% earnings growth in 2012, maybe we get a 10% stock price increase also.

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: UVIC, MHR-C/D, GST-A, GLW, EGY,
DRAGF, MSFT. Changes in top-10: ARY - reduced position

New positions: MOS, NOK
Positions increased: GTE, GST-A
Positions reduced: ARY
Positions eliminated: GOOG, NXY
Flip-flop: GAME, PMGLF

Thus ended 2011. The year was not profitable for me and a lot of other value
investors. After two years of spectacular gains going out of the market bottom
in 2009, the Market showed that it can be the Great Humiliator as Ken Fisher
loves to say. A lot of investors - value and others - underperformed the
indexes and cash. I did not escape the crowd. The final numbers from Fido are
not available for some time and I did not do all Quicken updates, but the
results are about -8% return. This is not good.

Looking back, the big losses in 2011 were Chinese small caps. In fixed income
land, I bought MHR-D and GST-A at higher prices than they trade now. GLW
dropped a lot through the year. What worked well was special situations in
Chinese small caps - cash buyouts that very few people believed in. I
recaptured some lost money there. IDCC was also a good performer in 2011, even
though buyout did not happen.

I cannot say that there are particular lessons to be learned from 2011, except
for wariness of Chinese small caps and questionable accounting in small caps
overall. The macro trends are never easy to predict, so jumping on/off the
wagon due to Euro crisis was not an attractive choice for me. I doubt that a
lot of people made money on their decision to jump on or off.

Coming to 2012, I have reduced my position in ARY as it trades over par. I
added some GST-A on sellof in December.

I flip-flopped PMGLF for tax reasons. I sold GOOG as I consider it overvalued
here - however this is possibly a bad move, since GOOG is still a great
company. I sold NXY as I lost my belief in the company's execution. I added
some GTE as stock dropped a lot in December.

I started new positions in MOS and NOK. I have described my reasoning about NOK
before. MOS is an attractive company. It's not very cheap, but worth a tracking
position.

Great investing results in 2012 for all!

Hi Sergio

The only problem I see with FROIC and CapFlow is that they are difficult
numbers to calculate especially w/o going into the balance sheet (do you know
of a site/link where this information is readily available?). The Graham No.
can be calculated from the Yahoo Stats in about 10 seconds.

This article goes into more detail on the calculations. It's a great screening
tool but for me too difficult to calculate on the fly (back of the envelope)
during the day.

Analysis Of The Aerospace And Defense Industry
http://seekingalpha.com/article/315284-analysis-of-the-aerospace-and-defense-in
ustry

From the article:"...FROIC is basically Free Cash Flow Return on Invested
Capital or:
(Cash Flow - Capital Spending)/(Long Term Debt + Shareholder’s Equity)

I look for companies that achieve Owner Earnings returns of at least 15% on
Main Street for every $1 of Total Capital invested. Basically in the real world
of Main Street, far from Wall Street companies that achieve 15%+ on this ratio
are making a lot of money, so logically if you have a business whose cash
register if overflowing continuously, there is a great probability of making
some serious money someday.

The third ratio that I use to pick stocks I call “CapFlow”. CapFlow is
basically:

Capital Spending/Cash Flow

This ratio allows me to identify elite management teams that achieve very low
costs in relation to their cash flow. Very simply they are usually the low cost
producer in their industry because of their management great attention to
detail in their cost control management. They also use things like “Economies
of Scale”, where as their sales increase their cost per unit decreases.

So to summarize we search for the following ideal for each ratio;

1) CapFlow = less than 50%

2) FROIC = greater than 15%

3) Price to Owner Earnings = less than 15

In doing my industry analyses I end up giving a stock a rating of four possible
outcomes of 0-3 and then gather the ones scoring perfect 3’s and place them on
my list for further analysis for potential purchase.

FWIW, I created a watch list with favorable Graham No.s. I am trying to be a
bit more analytically in my daily Buys & Sells and want to error on buying
value (low PE, Low debt & large value spread between Graham No. and current
price).

I saw the article with the formula and how it is calculated and agree it takes
too long to calculate. It would be worthwhile to set up a spreadsheet to do the
work if someone was so inclined. For me, I spend enough time in deciding what
to buy and don't want to add more work.

Did you notice that in reviewing the defense stocks the author declined from
buying any despite the high scores due to other factors? I like spending more
time on trying to figure what the other factors may be after taking a quick
view of the chart and the financial ratios.

I did appreciate that the author is not a cookie cutter financial advisor and
actually works for his clients. I liked IR before and took advantage of his
work by buying more shares.

I would like to see your watchlist if you care to share it.

for those of you who own mil the the former terra nova the former mass
financial, Mr.Smith bought an old iron mine today, the stock is up a bit, but
still below book. it remains one of my largest holdings. I will give Mr. Smith
a few more years of trying to earn the 20% returns that he has been able to do
historically. I have been adding more silver positions in the last couple of
days specifically cef and agq, and more axu again. we will see how silver does
in 2012.

somebody recommended MOS on cnbc but said he thought CF industries offered the
most appreciation potential in the space. AAB.to own a couple of feritilizer
companies in Brazil. They continue to sell at around 1/2 of there last reported
book more or less. I continue to hold all my shares there too.

I dont know if any of you noticed the rights offering on unicredit. apparently
the italian bank offerred shares in a rights offering to existing shareholders
at a 43% discount. on cnbc they announced that shareholder only participated in
26% of the shares. Given that European banks are afraid to lend to one another
why would shareholders want to provide capital to such risky enterprises? Of
course one can ask the same question about putting money into the black box we
call a US bank.

the MF global question of what happened to customer deposits still hasnt been
answered. This is the greatest scandal as an investor that I have been witness
to. A special prosecutor should be appointed to investigate both the MF global
executives and their regulators. The bankruptcy took place four months ago and
many accounts are short 1/3 of their value, and there are still no answers.
Amazing.

The lesson that I should have learned in 2011 but did not was that margin is a
two edged sword, and that markets can stay irrational longer than i can stay
solvent. As a result I was forced out of positions I would have rather kept.

re Michelin I think your data is off. Looks for the metrics using ML.PA. My
notes state ~20B Euro in revenues, 180M shares outstanding and ~ 10% operating
margins. Earnings/share are expected to be 6.5-8Euro (wide range)> net
assets/share were 47.9 Euro on 6/30/11 and should be somewhat higher now.

I think I shoot for a price above 13$ to unload. Fundamentally Michelin is
cheap, has a nice balance sheet with little debt and makes a big but reasonable
bet that tire demand in the emerging markets will fuel their earnings going
forward. The analyst projections assume flat earnings (within a wide range) for
next year, which I think is reasonable. Falling rubber prices may provide some
tailwind to margins, but the European tire market may have some headwinds.

I don't think the Graham number is very useful, I can value a company either
based on earnings power, or based on liquidation value but I don't see a blend
of the two as useful. The Graham number seems to imply that the geometrical
average of earnings power and book value scales with the value and I don't
think this makes sense
