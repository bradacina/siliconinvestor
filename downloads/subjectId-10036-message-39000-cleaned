Bargains coming or here.... the article says:

"The stock market's average price/earnings ratio, meanwhile, is in free fall,
having plunged about 36% during the past year, the largest 12-month decline
since 2003. .......

P/E ratios fell sharply during the Depression of the 1930s and again after
World War II, bottoming at 5.90 in 1949. They plunged again during the 1970s,
touching 6.97 in 1974 and 6.68 in 1980."

And doesn't note that the market went roaring up after every one of those short

Going back to our diversification discussion before, I'm seriously thinking of
putting ~1/2 my portfolio in 5-10 companies like MSFT, ORCL, IBM, INTC, AMAT.
Lots of cash, good forward p/e's, access to put their money to work in the best
opportunities across the globe.

I've tended to avoid large caps due to relative valuations in the past ten
years, but I feel like they're quite a bargain these days...

Right now, I have about 4% total in MSFT & INTC, but I'm looking to expand.
Anyone else thinking along these lines also?

There'd be a commission savings, but not necessarily an overall cost savings.
The overall benefit or cost would seem to depend on a number of factors.

If the person had a $100k portfolio and put half or $50k into 5 or 10 tech
stocks - if it were just five- and if the five were held for a while, and if
the commission per transaction were $8 each way, then

Individual purchase: 5 buys in and eventually 5 buys out = 10 transaction x $8
= $80

ETF: One buy and one subsequent sell: 2x$8 = $16

However, with etf, there are expenses: XLK = .22%
$50,000 x .0022 = $110 per year

According to this article PWE can possibly double their reserves from their
current 687 million BOE of proved reserves...

Penn West Energy – Surprising Production and Reserve Growth On The Horizon
http://www.gurufocus.com/news.php?id=105574

From the article:"...What is particularly appealing here is that this is a very
low risk opportunity. Penn West has long been viewed as an unexciting company
with great assets that developed them slowly producing a steady stream of cash
flow. Now, what is emerging is a company that in addition to being a low risk
producer is also a company with very exciting growth prospects. Consider

- Existing reserves of 687 million BOE

- Believe that these can be doubled through in-fill drilling just on existing
fields

- Are now developing a large oil sands project that could add hundreds of
millions of additional barrels of reserves

- Also have a large shale gas play at Cordova that had been moved forward by
years

Currently the NAV of Penn West as calculated by various analysts is around $22
per share. The current share price is $20. So you are essentially paying a fair
price for the existing reserves for a company that appears capable of easily
doubling those reserves in the coming years. If the growth doesn’t materialize
you aren’t going to lose much. If the growth does occur (and there is no reason
to think that it won’t) this is going to be a big winner. And if you believe in
higher oil prices going forward then this opportunity looks even better...."

====================================================================

It's possible that the analysts have under estimated the potential growth in
reserves looking forward.

In his presentation last week CEO Nunns compared their Pembina Cardium Field in
Western Canada with the Permian Basin in Texas. In Canada typical well spacing
has been 80 acres while in Texas it is 5 acres. <u>The result is that while in
the Cardium the recovery factor has been about 13%, it has been more like 32%
in the Permian Basin. In other words there is a lot more oil in the Pembina
(Penn West’s property) that can be recovered.</u>

The company can be more efficient in their current drilling practice. Their NAV
is estimated at $22.00/share and when they begin their "in-fill drilling"
program on their Pembina Cardium Field their NAV could be calculated to be 20%
higher.

PWE and ERF continue to be in my top ten holdings.

Well if SNY finances the deal with debt, the market cap would go down with your
assumptions but EV would go up. I think you have to apply calculation to the EV
not the market cap.

From the article:"... Based on IBM's recent share price, the stock is trading
for a trailing P/E of about 12. Applying this to the 2015 bottom-line
expectations implies a share price of $240 per share, or nearly double the
current stock price ($20 est. EPS x a P/E of 12 = $240). Averaged out and
combined with IBM's modest current dividend yield of 2%, this represents a
total annual shareholder return of about +20% per year.

IBM is one of the most visible, sure-thing investment opportunities out

Aside? Scuttlebutt.

There are people who think that investing without scuttlebutt is like gambling
in a casino (hehe ;)). There are people who don't do scuttlebutt - that's me.
:)

I thought about it and IMHO scuttlebutt makes sense only when the payoff is
highly asymmetrical (or portfolio is highly concentrated - let's skip that
situation for now). I.e. if we are talking about next Microsoft, Blockbuster or
similar. Scuttlebutt takes a lot of time and effort. If you do it for every
random company - like your example of casino slot machines - the time is
probably better spent on looking at financials and choosing or discarding the
company based on them. Scuttlebutt makes tremendous sense when financials suck,
but you have a feeling that the company might be great going forward - and
market has not seen that yet. Great positive example of this was QCOM before
its explosion up in the 1990's, which made its original holders
multimillionaires (and very arrogant ;)). CREE might be another example - the
financials still mostly suck.

I was talking with one of the "scuttlebutt or you're not an investor" types
recently. So I proposed to them to do a scuttlebutt on DRWI. Another tech
fallen angel - Charlie Silk type - I'd not buy it without a true scuttlebutt of
whether this is a dead horse or the next QCOM. Unfortunately the guy didn't
take the challenge. Anybody here want to do some real 10-bagger scuttlebutt? ;)
Note: don't look at financials, they won't tell you anything. DRWI did fine,
now over half of the revenue is gone. The task is to figure out what's next. :)

I take the position that free enterprise eventually runs amok without a

And that there are pluses and minuses of government involvement with banks.

I'm surprised how much of bank profits are from overdraft or overdrawn charges.
Government regulation now of some apparently egregious bank overdraft practices
will cut these profits --- until banks figure out a way around them. Regardless
if they do or not, banks like WFC provide home loans, car loans, commercial
loans, credit cards. Banks "should" be profitable from all this. And now there
are fewer banks, so that might help the biggest banks.

I see BAC at new low. I've picked WFC as my bet, and as it drops (like today),

Paul,

Part of the DGX business that does research pharma tests is pretty small, so I
am not sure there is a big issue of "lose some business from SNY competitors".

The real question about DGX future is what will the hospitals do. Hospital labs
are still the majority of the diagnostic test providers. Even biggest
independents like DGX and LH have much smaller part of the market. Furthermore
hospital labs try to attract tests from all independent doctors and smaller
clinics in the hospital area. Unless more hospitals decide to outsource tests
to DGX and LH, DGX will always be behind in testing. Who would go to some DGX
lab if they can just go to the lab in the same place where they visited their
doctor? The convenience of the hospital lab is pretty much unbreakable. It's
like real estate mantra "location, location, location". :/ It's surprising DGX
and LH got to the place where they are - perhaps some hospitals don't consider
their labs to be important part of their business. ;)

Yes, value investors should account for government regulation costs in their

Funnily enough he gets on the government side shorting the for-profit education

"consistent and predictable", since it's whole essence is change through
elections and elected officials. And that change is possibly good, since it can
- ideally - adjust to new situations in the country and world. (It's bad when
the politicians go for their pet interests or populistically swing from one

Interesting though labor-intensive way to value pharmas:

To value a pharmaceutical company, he takes all the drugs they are currently
selling, assumes an 85% profit margin, and does a discounted cash flow
projection based on the remaining life on each drug’s patent. Ideally, you want
to buy the stock at a discount to these cash flows and get the pipeline for

Closed out my position in Southern Union Co. (SUG). Based on the Citicorp
report posted 11/14/2009, I sold half of my SE and moved the proceeds into SUG.

SE continues to perform very well from when I first acquired my shares on
2/18/2009 at $13.28/share. Dividend 4.9%. Forward PE 12.41.

SUG dividend is 2.6%. Forward PE 11.26

Based on the Citicorp switch recommendation:

SE switch date 11/16/2009: $19.25 to $21.00 (price as of 9/1/2010) + 9.1%
SUG switch date 11/16/2009: $20.53 to $23.43 (price as of 9/1/2010) + 14.13%

SUG's Net Income/LT Debit ratio is almost twice as large as SE at 16x. SE's Net
Income/LT Debt is 10.7x. Both are a lot higher than I would like. I like to buy
when it is 4x or less.

=================================================================

Therefore, the Citicorp "switch" recommendation did yield about a 5% overall
return higher but when adjusted for the difference in dividend yield the gain
was a modest 2.5%.

I continue to hold my SE position with my low cost basis. My dividend Yield on
Cost per share is 7.5%. No plans to add more shares unless SE falls below
$18.00/share.

================================================================

Sold 50% Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. (CBI) to lock in recent gains and
maintain my lower cost basis.

Sold 20% of Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR) to harvest the last of my losses
and lower my overall cost basis. Will try to buy back these shares in 31 days.
My cost basis is now $4.65/share down from over $8.50/share. I am very positive
on this company and believe 2011-2012 should see ULTR sell in the double
digits.

I may have to join you there, especially

Its honestly probably not a good reason, but i just have to many questions
about (1)reserves (proven and proved undeveloped) and (2) what management
actually plans doing with these reserves ( and maybe that is not a good way to
put it.. the honesty of management about these reserves)

Maybe it is because i have worked at two different E&P companies as a
production accountant for a company in plano right out of high school and then
as a financial analyst and intern for 2 years at a E&P company in dallas, and
especially when doing finance the first question in my mind was always wow this
is alot to pay for acreage, and every time we went and gave presentations on
our "proved" reserves it was my least favorite day because i would just sit
there and think how on earth are people believing this..... but they do! And
the same thing goes for these other smallerish E&P companies, they overstate
there reserves by a LARGE amount IMHO.

Though i am well versed in math I am not an engineer, so i am unsure on the
calculations of PV of future exploration and the dependency on acreage and
drilling prospects in its acreage ruling out NAV calculations completely for
me. That being said when i was doing the project finance work for individual
wells etc. the numbers never added up consider what we held as our "proved"
reserves(would always think yeah.. maybe if we multiplied .6 or so to
"proved"??). ESPECIALLY when it came to new fields and shale plays. But what we
were essentially doing was pumping up our reserve figures(and even independent
engineers are in on this btw), keeping drilling on a slow to moderate pace and
waiting for one of the big boys to come buy our assets. And the companies i
worked for are not the only ones doing this.

That is why i have been really interested in to what you all are looking at
because i feel my judgement is somewhat shaded by what i saw on the front line,
and find myself especially agreeing with alot of what spekulatius has been
saying on MLP and EP side.

That being said i have ignored most E&P companies except on the short side and
just looked for old fields that can be acquired at a huge discounts for either
secondary or tertiary recovery because i feel somewhat comfortable with this
and it has worked for me.

Sorry for the essay, i feel this is just part of the reason besides the
financing with debt or drilling without replacing cash reserves and other
reasons that spekulatius, etc have mentioned but IMO its complicated, that's
why there is probably plenty of money to be made and i want to keep trying.

GAI. Looking at it briefly, company doesn't seem worried about collecting
receivables --- allowance for doubtful accounts is small. Maybe too small; I

Company is not a Ben Graham net-net.

$85M in current assets - $33M of total lia - 12M in contingent = $40M.
2/3 of $40M/3.2M sh = $8.4 per share. For me, it's close enough with the stock

should continue waiting for a better (lower) price. (Or just avoid this

GAI,

I have owned this on and off over several years (although not recently). They
always have had a lot of cash and never were, to my recollection, able to come
up with a business model that worked consistently. They might have a few good
quarters, but were never able to show consistent profitability over the years.

Recent results much seem better than I remember, but as I said over the years
management did not do much to impress me. And they had/have such a weird mix of
businesses and it is another yet another Chinese microcap, both of which don't
get me real excited.

Seems like a very reasonably priced stock here, but I would not be inclined to
make a very big investment. With continued strong results, they could double
from here. Or, they could revert back to their mediocre results and the price
could languish.

Matt, you input is much appreciated. I would take NPV calculations with a bunch
of Aspirin and some hard Licor <g>. I think they are mostly overstated and do
not take into account the large costs to develop the reserves or the cost to
keep the enterprise running. Just one example- MHR spends 80% of their revenue
on G&A expenses - how can this be? Worse, even though their revenue have more
than trippled YOY, G&A expenses have grown even more so. You would expect this
number to come down a lot percentagewise? Are these really G&A expenses or
covered up more or less direct production expenses, knowing that investors look
high production costs more unfavorable than high G&A costs? I am not in the oil
industry but I know that many managers do shuffle their costs around to make
them look better. I have also seen ridiculous NPV assumptions for new
product/platform introductions, which i think is quite similar to having NPV
calculations done on an oil or gas field that has not produced yet.

I do think that proved reserves audited and verified by a reputable firm are
worth something, after all misstating this in the 10k is accounting fraud and
could lead to jail time.

Meat price surge fuels fears of food inflation
By Jack Farchy in London and Gregory Meyer in New York

Published: September 1 2010 23:07 | Last updated: September 1 2010 23:08

Global meat prices have hit a 20-year high as robust demand from emerging
countries has coincided with a drop in production by exporters such as the US
and Australia, fuelling concerns about rising food inflation.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s index of meat prices rose in August
to its highest level since 1990, up 16 per cent over the past year, after lamb
prices hit a 37-year high, beef prices climbed to a two-year high and the cost
of pork and poultry prices rose.

“There has been sustained demand from Asia and from the Middle East for both
beef and lamb,” said Pedro Arias, a livestock economist at the FAO in Rome,
echoing a widely held view in the industry. “But the traders have not been able
to satisfy that demand because herds have been curtailed.”

The sharp price rises have attracted speculative money to what is otherwise a
niche market in Chicago. The number of outstanding contracts at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange for live cattle and lean hogs futures and options – both
benchmark derivatives – has jumped by nearly a third since the start of the
year.

But industry executives, traders and analysts said the increase in prices was
not due to the inflows of hot money, but rather supply and demand factors. Meat
production has stagnated in top exporting countries as livestock farmers
suffered a series of misfortunes from severe droughts in Australia and Latin
America, to low prices in the early 2000s and record high feeding costs.

At the same time, the growing middle class in emerging countries from China to
Brazil is demanding a richer protein diet, further straining the industry’s
supply.

Eddie Troutman, vice-president of international and byproduct beef sales at
Cargill, the agribusiness that owns meatpacking plants in the US and Canada,
said: “I’m very bullish on beef exports over the next several years.”

Live cattle futures in Chicago last month reached $1 a pound, the highest in 22
months and near the record high set in 2008. Australian lamb prices have risen
above A$5.50 a kilo, the highest since 1973-4. And pork bellies – used to make
bacon – have risen to a record price of almost $1.50 a pound in the US.

The rise in meat prices comes amid heightened concerns about food price
inflation since this year’s drought in Russia devastated the country’s grain
crop, triggering a sharp rise in the price of wheat and other cereals.

In Saudi Arabia, which depends heavily on imported food commodities, the price
of red meat rose 12 per cent in the six months to July, said John Sfakianakis,
chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi in Riyadh.

“Food inflation is one of the main causes of build-up in inflation we are
seeing this year,” he said.

Hi eliminator

Is this the first indicator of pending inflation? Are global commodity prices
fixed to move higher?

There are a lot of cross currents in the market. Pending deflation (U.S.
housing market still need to fall another 30%), a bond bubble ready to burst,
double digit unemployment in the U.S. and the concern of a double dip global
recession.

From the article you posted:...<u>“Food inflation is one of the main causes of
build-up in inflation we are seeing this year,”</u>...

How much will the Fed allow inflation to rise before they start raising
interest rates? It's a no win end game that will eventually hurt bond and
equity holders.

I am betting that holding companies that own the raw materials will get hurt
the least. The BRIC countries will fuel future world wide growth along with the
other smaller emerging countries.

The trick will be to find those companies that own the hard assets can move
and/or process them into goods and services for these emerging markets and to
buy them at value prices.

Companies that can pass on these higher prices should be winners too.

Got any ideas on which ones?

re PWE - the oil sands project has been talked about since 2005, as far as I
remember - so far not much has happened. I assume it's not economical at this
point.

based on current reserves, PWE is quite a bit overvalued:
341M BOE (crude) x 15$=5.1B$
938 BCF (NG) x1.5=1.4B$

Total is 6.5B$ but EV is 11B$, so i think it's overvalued quite a bit. the
infill plan looks interesting but it will also cost Capex, I want to see the
economics there to see where it get's them. Note Slide 19, on which they
basically admitting that their F&D costs are near the top. Once all those tax
credit expire (some royalty will kick in as soon as 2010 and then the Trust
fund status will revert in 2013) then yields will go down and those Trusts will
be valued just like any other E&P. Based on the metrics it seems that they are
not worth more than 15$/share, maybe even less.

Would you care to elaborate on why you don't like MSFT? I just established a

don't see companies switching from Microsoft Office to another product anytime

as well as how they're going to deal with tablets, but I just see them making a

RE: Penn West Energy Trust (PWE) - Q2 2010 Investor Update

How did you arrive at the BOE(crude) $ price of $15.00 and the BCF (NG) $1.5?

According to their 2009 annual report (pg. 22)
http://www.pennwest.com/ssi/documents/PWTARFrontend2009V6c-Proof-Changes-WEB-Wi
hCrops.pdf

<u>Their Netback BOE 2009 price average was $26.32/BOE.</u>

This is net of:
royalties - $7.66/boe
operating expenses - $14.93/boe
transportation - $0.52/boe

- Netbacks for 2009 were $26.32 per boe compared to $39.85 per boe in 2008 and
$31.51 per boe in 2007. The decline resulted
from lower commodity prices for most of 2009.

Therefore, one could argue that the $15.00/boe number that you use for crude is
too low perhaps by 40%.

=============================================================
Here is another way to arrive at the same number.

Note: Here is a table of their average selling price per BOE and/or mcf 2009
($49.43/boe) vs 2008 ($66.60/boe) (pg 10)
http://www.pennwest.com/ssi/documents/PWTAR2009FINANCEV5dforWeb.pdf

After subtracting out the per BOE operating expenses, roylties & transportation
of $23.11$49.43/boe (from above) from the net average BOE selling price, you
arrive at their Netback BOE number of $26.32.
=============================================================
Notice that their development cost per BOE have come down substantially from
earlier years.

- For 2009 proved plus probable finding and development costs, excluding future
development capital, were $13.75 per boe
(2008 - $18.94, 2007 - $29.43) with a recycle ratio of 1.9 (2008 - 2.1, 2007 -
1.1).

This may further be reduced with horizontal "in-fill" drilling technology which
is being deployed. The net affect is a better ROI on their Capex spending.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have not analyzed many of these E&P oil company reports and many of the
numbers thrown out like "proved" vs "probable" and BOE expense and production
amounts may be incorrect and/or just bad estimates.

Why use Enterprise Value (EV) and not Market Cap when comparing under/over BOE
valuation analysis? Isn't the market cap value (# of shares outstanding X
$price/share) a better indication of what you have to pay for the asset?

I do appreciate you review because it allows me to see how others value these
types of assets.

Yeah, I agree as regards that $15.00 number.

I checked last night, and from what I can pull up from Google, I found people
who do use $15.00 per barrel of oil in the ground. Both for proved and probable
apparently.

However, previously I've also found people who use $20 per barrel. And that's
what I have been using.

Anybody can value reserves any way they want and post the value they get and
compare it to the stock's price or EV. My observation is that there's a lot of
assumptions that are made or conservative numbering that's going on. So
different people will get different results. In other words, Spekulatius or
anyone else can post their numbers on an e&p and say the stock is or is not
undervalued. That's only their opinion. And with oil in the ground, it depends
heavily on assumptions used. I'll use my assumptions and make my calculations,
and I may come up with a different conclusion.

For me, I am doing what I see other people doing - those pundits who write and
apparently who imply they have some expertise. There's a variety of opinion out
there. Most times I want to be conservative, and this is what I see some
pundits doing, so I follow (sometimes) and use this:

1. Use enterprise value, not market capitalization

2. Use shares fully diluted, not outstanding. (And it makes a difference since
there are so many options issued by the small e&p's.)

And there are other variables too, e.g. I use proved and probable, whereas the
most conservative approach would be to use proved only. (And the least would be
to use proved, probable and possible)

Hi Paul -

E&P valuation models

Would it not be better to use a BOE price that is a function of the daily crude
oil price? Maybe you just use 25% of the daily Crude oil price that Bloomberg
posts on their Web page.

Based on today's price $74.00 x .25% = $18.50

EV vs Market Cap

The McDep news letter follows the ratio of EV/Market Cap. I guess a ratio of 1
or less is good.
http://www.mcdep.com/mr100810.pdf

Can you explain the difference between EV and the Market Cap (1) What accounts
for the large difference between companies? and (2) Why do analysts prefer to
use Enterprise Values (EV)?

Isn't the goal to determine if the per share value is significantly undervalued
based on the "proved" BOE reserves in the ground after allocating specific
company BOE operating expenses?

It seems to me that an equivalent Mc Dep ratio could be calculated (similar to
what the McDep ratio trys to calculate based on the Market Cap & Debt adjusted
to Net Present Value) but based only on the company's in-the-ground BOE
"proved" reserves and their associate BOE operating costs (ie costs to get the
oil from under ground to distribution channels).

I would call this the Paul Senior $BOE/share ratio where 1.0 represents fairly
valued company BOE in-the-ground reserves when compared to the $ per share
price. Anything greater than 1.0 would mean that you receive more $BOE value
than you pay per market share price.

Then you can simply compare this ratio to all possible candidates and rank them
from high to low. The highest number represents the company with the "best
value" BOE reserves.

cwillyg,

You are right on your assessment of MSFT. Like i said in my previous post i
dont feel like there is many more negative catalyst going forward.

My simple rationale was on the basis i felt like it was a similar short for me
as RIMM has been this year and noted on SI, and Nokia back in 2007 on not only
a trade but valuation where sitting at 11x trailing earnings and 8.9x forward
earnings where revenue would continue to contract, margins would erode
slightly, r&d expense would pick up a bit and a cheap stock only would become
cheaper given its positioning in the market.

I had a real strong conviction that the more products that msft rolled out the
better opportunity for a continuing contracting multiple. That model has worked
well for me.

I reevaluated, and i now believe i was wrong about several things (i covered
75% of my position on 09/01 for $2.34, which i bought on 08/09 at 1.70
[url]http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26742006[/url]), especially
the product mix which is important when i enter into a short position.

Qtr end on 03/31

MSFT has 4.2 billion in Revenue from Business Division.
4.4 billion in Revenue from Windows Division
3.5 billion in revenue from server/tools division
1.6 billion in revenue from entertainment/devices
556 million from online services division
39 million from online service division

The thing that you all were right about is the fact that windows division
revenue is not going anywhere and though i believe the windows xp conversion is
somewhat baked in. Windows still has 96% of pc shipment share by operating
system, 94% of office suites with adobe account for 4%.

I was modeling into my revenue numbers a contraction of the entirety of revenue
itself which is a LARGE exaggeration. The difference between msft and rimm,
nokia, other similar positions ive taken besides the $4.24 cash per share, 8.9x
fwd earnings of $2.3 net of cash, 2.1% yield, share buybacks is these failed
projects that msft have taken on and largely have touted over and over again
really do not matter at ALL in the large part of there overall business where
in the case of RIMM, blackberry is rimm and that is it. I could go on, but this
is what it boils down to for my change in stance.

If they earn a modest 2.35 in 2011, trading at 10x it will be at $28, 15x would
be $40. If there enterprise and windows refresh cycle really takes off. They
could possibly turn 2.55 or 2.60. Why was i so bearish?

OK, so now you have to tell why you are so bearish on RIMM and NOK?

Disclosure: I have tiny RIMM long position and moderate NOK long position
(result of large long NOK position from years past :/ ).

Jurgis,

I was talking about Nok in 2007-2008. When earnings/revenue get on the other
side of the bell curve as far as %increases (47,97,84,35... ?) Ill have to get
back to you on more detailed analysis on rimm. I should just send you my
spreadsheet, but compare Financial Statements prior to 2007 for nok and look at
rimm now, very similar.

I have been decreasing my short position in RIMM, especially during capitation
the other day. Looking to add to it at a little higher price though. There will
be another shoe to drop for rimm, i am just not wanting to wait for it at this
price.

I believe now you could trade around rimm on the long side, but cut your losses
pretty quickly..... this is obviously not value investing. I do like to trade
around my positions.

EKS,

Yes, might be more accurate to use a factor times the crude oil spot price.
That might result in streaming - instantaneous - navs that capture variation in
oil prices. Wouldn't be appropriate in every case though because some e&p's
that produce oil have that oil hedged at fixed prices. That might have to be
considered. Taken together, too much work for me with this for the gain in
accuracy. Perhaps would also be too much nav fluctuation for my ole mind to
stand.

I view enterprise value as what an acquirer would pay for the business after
all claimants to the business are satisfied. You buy the business at its
current market cap and you have the company's debt to contend with, so add that
to the market cap (ltd at market value, if known-- or I just use balance sheet
amount). Otoh, you get to keep any cash if you bought the company, so subtract
that out. You theoretically have got to also pay off the preferred
shareholders, so also add that amount in (at market value if available). I
generally stop here. There are possibly some off-balance sheet items that I
don't see and -- rightly or wrongly --I don't dig for. Also option holders have
a claim on the business, but I don't know how to factor that into enterprise
value, so I ignore that. I assume when I divide my resulting enterprise value
by fully-diluted shares (which includes the effect of options if they were
converted) it covers it well-enough.
============================
I don't know why Mr. Wulff has a column that's headed by EV/market cap. I never
pay attention to that particular column. I guess since debt is generally the
largest component of EV after market cap, that the higher the ev/mkk cap ratio,
the greater the debt the company has to deal with. Which is more important for
smaller e&p companies because a lot of them have the land leases, but not
enough cash or so much debt, that they can't build production (unless they
produce slowly to reinvest cash flows or unless they dilute stockholders by
issuing shares).
================
Again, my operating style is that I want something quick, easy, and consistent
to both screen for stocks and to make buy/hold decisions. I'm not a fan of dcf
partly because of the assumptions one makes of future years' performance. (I
will consider 2pnav10 though if the company does the work in getting and
reporting it.)

Also as I've said earlier, I'm primarily interested in oil. Less interested in
nat gas, of which I believe there is either an ample supply or a future glut
that will force gas e&p managers to reduce their unhedged production. So I
attempt to base valuations on oil component only, and try to avoid using boe
(if it includes gas for the particular company) as a variable in my
calculations of value.

I'm hoping my sloppy analyses are good enough. I expect I'll have some clunkers
that I could've perhaps avoided, but since I'm buying a package of these e&p's
-- I'm up over a dozen now -- I hope I'll have some good winners, and that
they'll in total, do better than my losers lose. The longer I'm in, the more I
hope to learn and observe, and so with this sector I'm intending to average up
on stocks that look like winners to me.

Certainly if you have some calculations or techniques that you prefer that seem
better than what I'm doing, I wouldn't doubt it at all. Please post results of
your work, and stocks you like. I've got no problem following you guys into
positions you like that might show up to be much better buys and/or safer bets
than what I get from my simple number crunching.

Good overview on your valuation views especially EV (Enterprise Value) vs
Market Cap.

Yes debt can be a big issue for the small emerging E&P companies and even the
larger ones that use a lot of leverage.

I really have only gone through the detail 10K's and 10Q's for two or three of
these producers. I have a much better idea of what to look for now.

Here are some of my observations (from a value guy).

1) I tend to look for hidden assets or assets that the company owns which
everybody else thinks are worthless. For example, One of these NG gathers
generated 10% of their revenues from a shipping subsidiary. I forget the name
of the company but that had a pretty extensive logistics business that serviced
the Caribbean Islands shipping storage containers. This business could be
considered a hidden assets and perhaps quite valuable to the right acquirer
(like FedX or some land freight company).

2) For the small E&P guys, access to capital (and lots of it) is key and at the
right price too. They may have the best oil in-the-ground but could go bust w/o
the right JV partner. A company that has their lines of different debt already
set up (like GMXR) and bought at the right price, could be a bigger winner in
the end IF (a) the capital spent was not wasted and (b) future Capx spending is
more efficient (ie. utilize horizontal in-fill drilling technology).

3) With the bigger and more established E&P operators I have noticed that there
are large amounts of complementary assets (usually w/ extra capacity) in use
that may currently generate a higher operating $BOE but as extra capacity is
used (or sold to 3rd parties) brings down overall operating expenses
significantly in years 3 and out of a well's development.

This includes NG gathering and oil distribution pipelines, storage substations
and other infrastructure where capital has been spent to build out a
developer's well field. Many times the detailed reports do not specify where
there may be overlap w/ another well developer and/or the value of the
potential revenue stream(s) that can be generated by selling (or leasing) this
extra capacity.

The $BOE operating cost calculations generally do not not take into account the
"potential" excess capacity value of the revenue generated from these assets.
In fact, for a marginal producer who has spent significant capital on their
infrastructure build out, may find a larger partner that values their
infrastructure assets more than their proved/potential oil/NG in-the-ground!

Some of the super large integrators may pay more (or less) for a smaller E&P
developer depending on the overlap of their complementary assets located near
or next to their already developed parcels.
=====================================================================

Therefore as I look at a lot of the minute details in these company reports, I
am attracted to some of the intangible assets over looked by the general E&P
analyst.

I guess it is my flea market hunting experience. I can observe a lot of
potential value in the same asset where another just sees it as junk (or even a
liability).

EKS

FWIW - Sold 40% of my Honeywell International Inc. (HON) that I bought 9/2009
for a small gain (about 10% w/dividend). I will continue to hold my cheaper
shares that have a higher Yield/Cost return.

E_K_S - the 15$/BOE crude is my conservative estimate based on a few
observations. You really can use any number you like. You are correct that the
real value floats with the crude or NG prices but for relative comparisons and
quick estimates the 1.5/15$ estimate should work just fine.

As for PWE and looking at the link you provided - the 26$ netback # contains
5.3$ in hedging gains. i regard these as one offs (PWE had had hedging losses
before) so that leaves 21$, which is apparently a pret-tax value. So 15$/BOE
crude as a discounted value looks actually sort of high in case of PWE.it
appears to me that PWE lifts quite a nbit of heavy crude that seems to sell at
a discount to light sweet crude. That is the reason why the netback number for
PWE seems to be lower than some of the competitors, This makes PWE even more
overvalued (based on proved resources only) than some peers.

FWIW, probable reserves (which some smaller E&P almost seem to regard as good
as proved, are by definition reserves with a 50% chance of getting to
production Laos called P50), so this means that they can at most be worth 50%
of what proved reserves are worth. it's almost certainly less because to
convert probable reserves into proved one, the development cost for doing that
needs to be subtracted from NPV. I'd say that probable reserves should at most
valued at 1/3 the value of proved reserves -5$/BOE or 0.5$/MCFE.
