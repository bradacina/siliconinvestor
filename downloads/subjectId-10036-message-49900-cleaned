Re CL - pretty weak results for a company trading at 20x earnings imo.

I am reading DD's CC transcript and the CEO sounds pretty clueless. They must
ave seen the weakness coming, weak solar and TiO2 markets cannot be a surprise.
The Danisco acquisition was very expensive and really hasnot diminished DD
commodity exposure too muxh, but the balance sheet has taken a hit. I think the

That isw what the market are for. some believe that that a company maybe
"Under-valued" "Fairly-valued" or that you'll pay a Premium for it.

I personally think there's to much risk involved in shorting a stock outright a

MPW is one of those few transactions that i have held on to and that has worked
out quite well for me so far. in 2009 i bought 2000 shares at 5.48 and 1000
shares at 7.44 in 2010 i bought another 3000 shares at about 9.50 so i think
the average return on capital has been quite good. around 10% plus price
appreciation. I wish all my purchases had worked out so well.

I have purchased a couple of gold mining stocks recently. i dont know if you
are interested but i figured i would mention kgn keegan really has almost
everything i am looking for in a gold miner, it is quite cheap has good
connections, some institutional support and they already have the gold in the
ground as well a a couple of hundred million in the bank which they say is
enough to get them to production. each share which sells in the 3s I think
controls about at least $85 dollars worth of gold in ghana, and using the funds
in the bank it plans to get to production without having to go to the bank and
be forced to hedge any part of their production.

I still have a huge position in MIL, I just have lot of confidence in Mr.
Smith. The guy has just created a lot of value for his investors over the years
and I see no reason why he wont continue to do so.

Aberdeen has been very disappointing to me in terms of the scuzzy management
but as long as they keep paying the dividend and are a huge discount to NAV i
will keep holding.

I still have a huge position in SLW and a good size position in ANV, a seth
klarman pick. i also still have shares in atusf, a well managed mine prospector
and cmp.un.to a closed end fund, that hasnt updated their portfolio in several
months. i am trying to figure out why.

This is off value investment topic, but I would like to comment on this guy

We had QE1, qe2 with no significant inflation despite cnbc and its "expert"
guests reporting it will be a problem. Now are in qe3 and the inflation scare
is making its way on the news again.

The fed's dual mandate is to maximize employment and maintain stable prices.
With unemployment extremely high and inflation around 2% his priority is to
increase employment. Who cares if inflation increases 1% or 2% if your
unemployed. If I was unemployed for the past six month which most unemployed
are, I would not care if inflation increases 1% or 2%.

Also, he states that whoever wins the election doesn't matter. I disagree,
Obama and Romney have vastly different policy on what will get unemployment
down.

As far as Im concerned the inflation number is quite phony. the only deflation
that i see for myself will be in my mortgage costs assuming i can refinance and
lower my rate from 5.5% to 3.5%. OTOH I have seen food costs increase by way
more than 1-2% for just about any item that contains nutrients.

Health Insurance, College Tuition seem to be going up by at least 5 % every
year. The only way I seem to be able to save money is by doing things myself or
hiring high school kids.

In the meantime we continue to face structural unemployment. there are just
fewer full time jobs out there. and politicians are slow to adjust. where i
live its just beautiful and land is reasonbly priced and plentiful. I spoke to
someone and expressed surprised that more industry doesnt relocate here and he
told me that they they just dont want to deal with union activity which he
feels is encouraged in the state of Mass. So the government needs to gets its
act together and offer sufficient inducements and incentives to rebuild a
manufacturing base in this country. thats the only way out that i can see.

This is probably getting way off topic of value investing but I meant to say an
we could handle inflation increasing 100 to 200 basis point or higher without
run away inflation. So far the food price increase is the result of price shock
with the drought this past summer and higher gas prices earlier this year
rather than qe3.

I definitely don't agree that we face structural unemployment. IMO we could put
a dent in unemployment if we hired back all the teachers, firefighters, &
police that were laid-off during the recession.

You can turn this argument around and ask yourself. - well QE1 and QE2 have not
worked as expected, why should QE3 work? The problem with inflation is that it
is not uniform. First of all, all the items that are "volatile" like energy,
gasoline, food are taken out of the "core" inflation number to begin with.
Amongst the remaining items, my observation is that some items show significant
inflation (mostly those that one cannot do without) while others become cheaper
over time. So the overal inflation average is not telling the whole story.

Somehwat related, I would argue that 8% unemployment is not the real problem
itself. The real problem is that the 8% is just the tip of the iceberg, so to
speak, the real unemployment, if you add those that have given up looking for a
job (this adds to up the mid single digits and would be the number that you
need to compare unemployment numbers in Europe with) and add to that the
working poor (which probably is about equal to the number that don't pay any
income tax, ~47% according to Romney). That is a pretty large percentage of the
populace that has a problem and not just since the great recession.

GreenHunter Energy Inc 10% Seri (GRH-PC) -NYSE MKT - Started position
Enerplus Corporation (ERF) -NYSE - Peeled off some high priced shares

With the MHR land acquisition in the Utica shale area, I expect more need for
water treatment services from GRH (where CEO Evans is a large stock holder). It
is a high margin business and I expect GRH to benefit from the long term
service contracts. There is a chance that as the company grows they could be
"in-play" by a larger E&P service company like HAL and/or SLB. Maybe they get
gobbled up if/when MHR is acquired.

In either case, I see that their preferred is in a "value" buy range but still
speculative. For me it's a better hold than the common.

FWIW, I am also looking to up my holding in the MHR preferred D's and/or GSTpA
as I see both present a good speculative buy and hold.

Staffing: Haven't followed the staffing sector in a while. TBI I've not been
aware of. I'll have to consider. My past favorite has been Kelly Services
(KELYA), and I'll consider that one again now too. MAN also, although it looks
too expensive for me at current glance at its metrics.

I've been looking at the executive recruiters (as opposed to blue-collar
firms). I am buying a few shares of HSII as it drops -- I like it's volatility.
When/if the economy picks up and there's hiring, all these firms (stocks) can
pop. As more of the boomers turn into geezers, I expect more retirements, more
people moving up the ranks, and more demand for executive hires. And sometimes
it seems that top executives change firms more frequently nowadays too. So all
this might perhaps increase demand for executive recruiters/recruitment. For a
positive to the downside of these publicly-traded recruiting firms - it's not
like the business is capital intensive: At slow times, headcount is reduced.

Having contacts to get contracts and the recruiting firm having a good
reputation are important. With HSII which has some metric numbers that I like,
I just need the company to hold on to get its share of the business. Seems very
doable: Company has plenty of cash, no ltd, and pays an okay dividend while
waiting.

Re: Kelly Services, Inc. (KELYA) 

I had KELYA on my radar screen but passed on the investment. They had negative
EPS two years in the last five but never really lead the recovery where one
would think they would. So, either our so called job recovery is still w/o
traction or KELYA is or has lost their lead in this sector.

Many of the financial criteria show that this name is significantly undervalued
maybe as much as 80% (using a modified EKS$), I think there are better places
to deploy new funds.

I am still being very cautious on new investments and have lowered my
expectations on capital appreciation. I will take a 10% return in both dividend
and capital gains as long as I do not step on a land mine. I just do not think
KELYA can deliver that conservative return in the short term.

I have been wrong and have watched this name for over 12 months so maybe their
time has arrived. It's been a looser over the last twelve months but maybe they
will do better in the next twelve months.

How many of these do you re-visit in 31 days? Do you look at the buy
differently or most of the time do you move on? I tend to scale out of a
position I have built up (similar to when I scale into it. It's hard for me to
wrap my head around a changing company story perhaps I come into the investment
with preconceived value measures (and/or fall into the value trap).

I think my biggest mistake(s) have been to hold out too long and not cutting
back a losing investment sooner rather than later. I have had some success
moving losing proceeds out of the common and into their preferred and/or debt
issues. My fairly large buy in SVU 2016 8% Notes I bought at 84 cents on the
dollar are now priced at 94.75 cents on the dollar. I still own SVU common
shares but put new money into their debt rather than upping my losing position
in the common.

My takeaway is there are many value opportunities everyday if you look hard and
turn enough rocks over. I need to learn that when a particular story (and/or
bet) goes south, I should book the entire loss and move on. It's hard to change
my style of building up a position and then going all out. So now, I am more
apt to sell out and take my gain but I do continue to hold some long term
"value" core positions.

WU had two quarters of pretty significant revenue deceleration and while the

Getting Back in the Game
By DAVID ENGLANDER / Barrons Sept 22, 2012

Big 5 Sporting Goods is upgrading its merchandise mix to attract customers and
boost sales and profits. The changes could beckon investors, too.

California was particularly hard-hit by the recession and has struggled to
rebound, as unemployment levels still exceed those elsewhere in the nation. The
troubled local economy and a value-focused customer base made business
especially difficult in recent years for Big 5 Sporting Goods, a sporting-goods
retailer that operates about half of its 407 stores in the state.

Based in El Segundo, Calif., Big 5 (ticker: BGFV) saw operating profit margins
contract to 2.1% last year from 6.1% in 2007, depressed by weak sales trends
and high promotional activity. Earnings tumbled 58% in the same span.

What's In Store? Big 5 is adjusting its merchandise mix to boost sales and
profits. Half its stores are in California, including this Santa Monica unit.

But a turnaround set in motion in the summer of 2011 appears to be taking hold.
Big 5 has been adjusting its merchandise mix to appeal to more-affluent
customers, by expanding its offerings of higher-priced, name-brand goods. The
company also has been scaling back on products that had been underperforming.

These measures have increased the average ticket price of store items, and led
in the most recent quarter to an improvement in profit margins. Sales at stores
open at least a year rose 1% in the three months ended July 1, reversing a
trend of negative comparables for the prior six quarters. Management has guided
investors to expect positive "comps" in the third quarter, as well.

Since the company's latest earnings report on July 31, Big 5's shares have
surged 21%, to close Friday at $9.15. That's a notable improvement, but a far
cry from the stock's 2007 high of $27.

More gains could be on the way, however. As the company's new merchandising
strategy wins customers, operating margins could rise sharply, lifting
earnings. This recovery, in turn, could spur a 30% rise in the shares. Big 5
pays an annual dividend of 30 cents a share, and yields a healthy 3.3%.

Co-founded by Robert Miller in 1955 as a seller of World War II surplus items,
Big 5 has grown into a leading sporting-goods chain in 12 Western states.
Miller and his son, Steven, who has been CEO since 2000, took the company
public in 2002.

Big 5 sells athletic shoes and apparel, as well as outdoor and athletic
equipment for team sports,camping, fishing and golf, among other things.
So-called hard goods, such as fishing rods and golf clubs, generated 55% of
last year's sales, with shoes and apparel contributing the rest. The stores
carry top brands, including Nike, Adidas, Coleman, and Under Armour, and a
small private-label line.

This year Big 5 could earn $13 million, or 60 cents a share, up 13% from 2011
earnings, on revenue of $930 million. Analysts expect earnings to jump to 77
cents a share in 2013, on 4% sales growth.

The merchandising changes are still in the early innings. At the end of last
year, the company began using a new business-analytics system throughout its
stores, which identifies weak-selling products, allowing management to make
better buying decisions and keep a tighter control on inventory.

In addition to adding higher-priced and higher-margin branded products across
its product categories, Big 5 also is expanding its size and color selection.
In the July quarter, as a result, the company logged its best gain in quarterly
same-store sales growth in apparel and footwear since 2006. Operating margins
rose to 2% from 0.4% in the prior quarter, driven by the higher-margin product
mix, and tighter inventory control.

Recent Price $9.15
Market Value $198 mil
12-Mo. Range $5.34 - $11.59
Revenue 2012E $930 mil
EPS 2012E $0.60
P/E 2013E 11.9
EPS 2013E $0.77
Net Inc 2012E $13 mil
Dividend Yield 3.3%

Expansion in operating margins could continue. Sean Naughton, who covers Big 5
for Piper Jaffray, estimates that operating margins could rise to 2.5% in 2012
and 3% in 2013. In a report, he notes that if margins recover to 4% in the next
several years, earnings per share could vault to $1.50.

Big 5 trades for 11.9 times estimated 2013 earnings per share, well below
Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB), at 18.4 times and 19.6
times, respectively. Naughton thinks the shares could command 15 times his 2013
estimate of 80 cents a share in the next year, implying a price target of $12.
Company officials couldn't be reached by press time.

BIG 5 HAS A SOLID balance sheet, with debt of $71 million to cash of $6
million, or net debt at 29% of total capitalization. The company is expected to
generate $14 million of free cash this year. In addition to paying dividends,
management has used the cash to buy back shares, reducing shares outstanding by
1.3% in the past year.

Big 5 also is revamping its digital marketing strategy. The company plans to
launch a new product-intensive Website by the end of the year, and has retained
IBM to evaluate an e-commerce strategy. An effective e-commerce launch could
also give a nice lift to Big 5's business—and its shares.

MHLD. I sold my latest purchased lot in July. (I've been in since '09 with adds
in '10 and ''11.) I've been wondering what I might do now as the stock has
fallen.

What I like: Insiders still continue to buy.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=MHLD+Insider+Transactions Stock price below
stated and tangible bv. Stated bv increasing most years. The stock offers an
okay (in my view) dividend.

What I don't like: Not a long public history of the company. Stock has always
(at least on average) traded below its book value.

What I don't know enough about, and therefore what I don't like: Presentation
gives the metric "operating roe", which management explains in the appendix.
Right now I'm not aware of any other insurance company or even any other
company using this metric. (Did my memory fail me again?) Standard ROE which I
use (from screen sites) shows modest performance at best over time:
http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&symbol=MHLD

I'll guess the insider purchases (esp. by Chairman Ziskin) may be key. I'll
consider placing an order for a few shares -- at least buy back some of the
shares I sold previously.

Re MHLD it is not the returns that are compelling, it is the (seemingly) low
risk way they achieved it. as far as I can tell, they have a loss quarter since
2009, even in quarters with major natural disasters. Their investment portfolio
is very high quality (see the link to a presentation in my last post). To
achieve a roughly 10% book value growth/year in a soft insurance market without
incurring large risks is quite impressive, imo. Either that, or the results are
manipulated, but I think the management buys indicate that the books should be
alright.

OT - I like your basic idea but maybe there is a potential value play there
too. My thinking was to focus on those companies that have or are moving their
product & services into the cloud. Icahn was rumored to be acquiring shares in
Netflix, Inc. (NFLX). This is basically a "Cloud" service but really no
barriers to entry.

The one company w/ unique "cloud" presence is Google. They have a lot of
government accounts (including schools, fire dept, etc) that use their unique
cloud service applications (Maps, email Docs, etc). Many of the IT support
people do have special certifications that administer these accounts (like CSCO
certs) but GOOGLE really does not require that. That requirement typically
comes from the enterprise organization implementing the cloud services into
their organization.

So, my value premise is to see if one or more of these certification companies
are or have made significant entries into the "Cloud" especially for the
enterprise customer. I do know that Google has been quite successful in gaining
a large growing customer base that uses their "cloud" services. Maybe there is
a company or consortium that provides partner certification programs. Cloud
services are attractive since they generate large FCF, are now a growth sector
and once built are easily updated and/or extended to several other platforms
(ie. Android & MAC).

As an example, Schwab has recently released a beta version of their StreetSmart
Edge product that is run in the cloud. This project started by the need to
provide a means to run Apple devises on the StreetSmart Pro platform but that
was Windows based. Therefore, they built a cloud based service that can run on
any browser.

MHLD - Yes, they advertise their avoidance of cat risk, so it would be strange
if they had huge cat losses. However, as you can see from their presentation
(slide 4), they are paying a price for the cat avoidance. They have nice and
flat combined ratio that is lower than other cos when cats occur but it is
quite higher than other cos when cats don't occur. Overall it's not clear for
me from the chart that their combined ratio is better than other cos looking
long term.

Another issue which Paul Senior alludes to with his short history comment is
that we simply don't know if MHLD is taking some other risks that have not come
home to roost yet. Obviously it's taking some kind of risks, nobody gets money
for nothing in insurance business. All insurance and reinsurance companies
claim "unique business model", "specialized", "differentiated", "disciplined",
"customer focused" business. If only I had $10 for every time these words are
mentioned... I highly doubt that (m)any of them really have a huge moat
advantage. Buffett talks his own book when he says Berkshire is the best
(re)insurer, but he's right that this business attracts a lot of "hot" money
and (re)insurance cos have trouble "differentiating" from other cos long term.

I agree that MHLD results so far look pretty OK and the price is cheapish. I'll
think about it, but I'll probably skip it for now.

Brazilian stocks: Well, if you've owned just one Brazilian stock for a while,
and it is SBS, then you likely show green. I have held and do still hold
several in addition to SBS, and I'm not a happy investor. The Brazilian
government has instituted rulings which make profits difficult for companies in
several sectors -- utilities, oil, banking. These are just the sectors that
contain the larger companies that USA investors can purchase otc or on NYSE.
For example, PBR, ITUB, CPL, EBR. I noticed in the Barron's article, that it
seems almost all of the stocks that the fund managers recommend are middle-tier
or lower-tier companies that don't seem to trade in USA market. Such companies
are very expensive to buy (in small amounts for small investors) on the
Bovesta. (There was a small cap etf fund mentioned though.) I'm presuming these
are companies (cosmetics/retail/small mfg. suppliers) where the managers
believe the companies will prosper with growth in Brazil's middle class or the
build up of infrastructure for upcoming soccer/olympics. And that the companies
are small enough or in sectors such that they won't be "attacked" by the
Brazilian government.

I also hold a couple of losing positions in stocks controlled by billionaire
Eike Batista, the guy who publicly aspires to be the world's richest person by
2015. I don't understand that from the stocks I have -- they are down quite a
bit from my purchase price.

What I am doing for now is holding on, maybe selling a couple for tax losses,
and refraining from buying any more Brazilian stocks for now. (May add to
losing position in EBR though.) I have shifted my interest and my focus to
Colombia where I believe I see opportunities and a more investor (outside
investor) friendly government.

I think you pretty much hit the nail on the head with respect to MHLD. I also

Re: Kyle Bass on SuperMedia Debt

From you article posted on "Great Investor" ideas, this one caught my
attention. I recall Paul Senior buying into one or more of these telephone
directory spin offs where their Ad divisions were being spin off into their own
operating company. IDEARC was one of those companies with $1.4B of bond debt.
IDEARC was formed into SuperMedia in a packaged BK and I guess Kyle Bass was
thinking that this debt was a "value" buy at $0.60 on the dollar (yielding
20%).

After a bit of research, I would not touch that debt. I can not see any assets
that are of value to me that supports that type of debt at $0.30 on the dollar.
Maybe I am missing something but at least I would want real estate and/or any
other hard assets in excess of the 1.4$B bond debt.

Also, according to my Schwab Bond desk, these bonds are not liquid and show no
activity on any of their bond desks (between market makers or in their own
book).

I have been pretty successful with my venture into junk bonds from my purchase
of the Supervalue 8% 2016 notes. I paid around $0.85 on the dollar, have been
collecting a 8% coupon (yield to maturity 13.5% from my buy) and now these
bonds are selling between $0.96 and $0.99 per $1.00 face value @ PAR.

This is an example of part of the daily trades from Schwab's book for this
bond.

Schwab's book is pretty active for these bonds but you need to be careful of
the spreads that buyers and sellers pay. Their Web site provides quite a bit of
detail especially when you drill down to the daily transactions. As an example,
SVU released a news story 10/22/2012 that there was interest in the company
from one or more private equity companies.

http://goo.gl/bK9Ok
http://goo.gl/bK9Ok
<blockquote>Heavily-shorted shares of Supervalu SVU -0.63% surged 39% to $3.04
Monday afternoon on heavy volume following news reports that Cerberus Capital
was trying to line up debt financing to buy the troubled supermarket chain.Also
Monday, J.P. Morgan upped its credit rating on Supervalu to neutral from
underweight, further fueling gains in the stock. .Supervalu’s bonds are rising
in value too, suggesting investors are more comfortable holding the troubled
grocer’s debt. The price on Supervalu’s 8% bonds maturing in 2016 has risen to
97 cents on the dollar, according to Andrew Brenner, head of international
fixed income at National Alliance Securities.</blockquote> On Schwab's bond
desk 216 trades were made in size for these bonds ranging from $0.97 to $0.99
on the dollar.

Therefore, I do find these "junk bond" stories of interest especially if there
is value in the underlining assets. In SVU's case, their real estate provides
the value with at most 70% encumbered by this debt.

For the case of SuperMedia I can find no such value. The only common thread is
the word "Super" and for Kyle Bass it may be a super loser IMO.

ESRX - got filled at 51.70.

FWIW, Here's a small blurb from June 9, Barron's Vital Signs:

AT FRIDAY'S CLOSE OF $53.39, shares of Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) are down
about 10% from a 2012 high of nearly $59.

The stock of the giant pharmacy benefit manager has been hurt by investor
hand-wringing over an ongoing spat with drug retailer Walgreen (WAG) and
potential integration risks with newly purchased Medco Health Solutions.

Nevertheless, in a world where the "risk on, risk off" daily market gyrations
can be painful for economically sensitive stocks, the drop in the shares of a
more defensive PBM like Express Scripts might provide a good entry point and
prove a less aggravating stock for long-term investors.

This seems particularly so in the face of a sign that the Express
Scripts-Walgreen tiff has become a few degrees less heated. On June 1, the two
agreed to dismiss a lawsuit Express Scripts filed last year over certain of
Walgreen's marketing practices. While Walgreen has said the dropped suit has no
impact on the "ability or inability" to forge a new PBM agreement, it's also
true that the drugstore chain has been suffering lately, partly as a result of
its decision to stop using Express Scripts' prescription-filling network on
Jan. 1, 2012.

Walgreen's April same-store sales fell sharply, 6.4%, and they've been negative
for the first four months of 2012—unusual for the well-run retailer.

The idea that there will be a settlement is gaining credence, says
Jean-Francois Comte, co-president of Lutetia Capital, which owns Express
Scripts shares. "It's hurting Walgreen and not great for Express Scripts,
either. People will calm down, and there will be a settlement," he predicts.

ESRX shares are still trading below their level of July 21, 2011, when the $29
billion merger with Medco was announced, creating the country's biggest PBM.
The market, meanwhile, is up over 20% since then, and a health-services peer
group is ahead about 8%.

Though investors are concerned about integration risk, the merger will lead to
"huge synergies," he adds, or about $1 billion, according to Express Scripts.
That will help expand margins, and it's a substantial number, even for a big
company like this, which had $2.6 billion in Ebitda (earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization) last year.

Some of those savings will be passed along to consumers, but some will accrue
to shareholders. The timing of the synergies will be critical and should be
phased in by 2014 at the latest, Comte says.

As a defensive stock with relatively limited downside, it is undervalued, he
opines. The company's price/earnings ratio of 14 is significantly below the
median of the last ten years, while its enterprise value to Ebitda ratio, at
10, is close to historical lows. (Enterprise value is stock-market value plus
net debt.) The St. Louis PBM's average return on equity for the past decade is
impressive, at nearly 40%.

"There's not much debt and it's a great business," Comte says. As markets lurch
from "risk on" to "risk off," there is some solace in the fact that most
prescription drugs don't represent discretionary spending.

The integration risk can't be completely ignored, but as the synergies go from
planned to realized over the next 12 months, Express Scripts could return to
$60,13% above its current quote.

Aurcana Corporation (AUNFF) -OTC Markets - Upped my position by 25%

http://goo.gl/IbMN0
Based on this article, AUNFF is significantly undervalued. The author reviews
the production estimates and provides his projections for their La Negra mine.
He arrives at a $1B valuation or about $2.20/share. This analysis does not even
consider the new Shafter mine which should have equal or higher production
yields in the coming months/quarters. http://goo.gl/KFvG5 Once the mine(s) are
in full production for 2 or more quarters, the market should have a better idea
of the actual (and potential) production. This name could be worth between
$4.00-$5.00 a share if silver remains at the current level. Even at the current
price, the downside risk is small and the upside is huge.

I'm not a daytrader, but I just sold ESRX at 55.82 for a 4 point swing.

New research report just came out in Barrons, (better a bird in hand, than...):

Express Scripts Hits the Slow Lane

By JOHANNA BENNETT / Barrons Nov 6, 2012

With the health-care giant warning that Street estimates for 2013 earnings are
"overly aggressive," investors should think twice about buying the stock.

The acquisition of rival Medco Health Solutions earlier this year turned
Express Scripts into a health-care behemoth. But the stock has become a hard
pill to swallow.

Granted, the company announced solid third-quarter financial results late
Monday. Thanks to better-than-expected profit margins and cost cuts from the
Medco deal, Express Scripts (ticker: ESRX) earned $1.03 a share, beating Wall
Street expectations by three cents. Revenue more than doubled to $26.7 billion.

And the company raised the low-end of its earnings-per-share forecast for 2012
by a nickel per share to between $3.65 and $3.75.

But all that got overshadowed when Express Scripts warned that Wall Street's
consensus forecast, calling for 2013 earnings of $4.50 per share, was "overly
aggressive" in the face of economic challenges.

The news shocked investors as shares plunged 12.5% to almost $55 in early
afternoon trading Tuesday.

Express Scripts' comments may admittedly simply be a case of conservative
guidance by management. But they do raise real concerns about the company's
fundamentals given that cost savings from the Medco merger and other tailwinds
were expected to help sustain robust profit growth next year and beyond.

Companies like Express Scripts – known as pharmacy-benefit managers or PBMs --
help employers and health insurers manage their prescription-drug plans and
control drug costs by securing lower prices.

The industry has profited enormously from a tidal wave of generic-drug
launches, which boost profit margins. And following its merger with Medco,
Express Scripts is by far the biggest player on the block – the old Express
Scripts and Medco handled a combined 1.7 billion claims in 2011, well ahead of
the 910 million claims handled by rival CVS Caremark (CVS).

But the stock's prospects have long rested on Express Scripts' performance in
2013, the first full year of operations for the newly combined company.

In April, Barrons.com argued that the merger made Express Scripts bigger and
better (see Barron's Take, "The New Express Scripts Proves that Bigger Is
Better," April 3). Since then, the stock has fallen 4%.

Express Scripts won't issue a financial forecast for 2013 until it announces
fourth-quarter financial results sometime early next year.

UnitedHealth Group is bringing its PBM business in-house, which will hurt the
number of claims Express Scripts handles next year. But the company also warned
that the weak business environment and high unemployment could lead to member
attrition and low utilization.

But given Express Scripts success retaining members and the stabilizing U.S.
economy, Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut found those remarks puzzling. And
with the worst of the so-called patent cliff now behind big drug makers and the
number of new generic-drug launches slowing down, pharmacy-benefit managers and
drug wholesalers are expected to encounter slowing profit growth.

Jefferies's Tanquilut sees earnings growing an average of 13% annually over the
next five years. And while respectable, that is well below the 17% average
annual profit growth rate expected by the Street.

"While we had anticipated a gradual growth slowdown and multiple compression as
the company exhausted MHS synergies and fully realized margin tailwinds from
2012 generic introductions, we did not expect the growth moderation to occur as
soon as 2013..," Tanquilut wrote in a note published Tuesday.

Of course, synergies from the Medco merger could prove far bigger than the $1
billion expected, allowing Express Scripts to offset any weakness in its core
operations.

But until we have a clearer picture regarding 2013 earnings and revenue,
Express Scripts isn't worth the risk.

Paulelgin, you are welcome to open your own thread but with only 5-10 posts/day
here, I hardly perceive a problem with excessive "noise" here. In my opinion,
this thread was never a Graham/Dodd thread in a narrow sense, even when Michael
Burry was around, more a meeting place for value minded members to exchange
ideas. It is been mutual beneficial for most and I believe the different styles
from Paul, Jurgis, Madharry, Sergio and many others are a positive rather than
a negative aspect of this thread, imo.

GEF-b @44.3$. I decided to buy a starter position in both my taxable and IRA
account. I think the owner operator aspect of GEF us a plus, as well as the
good dividend (5.6% currently). The acquisitions have added quite a bit more to
the debt than I'd like to see (~1.2B$) but they have shown good FCF this year.

GEF had a great year in 2019 but have taken a step back in 2011 due to margin
pressure (raw material rising faster than product prices). I think they would
have a great year if the economy accelerates.

Some article mention a Saudi Arabian venture but according to a latest 10q, the
sums involved seem too small to make a difference.

FWIW, the GEF-B shares are equivalent to 1.5 GEF shares while costing only 4%
more, so they are a relative bargain.

aurcana- I skimmed through the writers comments and had difficulty reconciling
them with the current available P&L on the the companys website. the other
question i need to answer is why did SSRI sell them the shaeffer mine in 2008
and for how much? write now paying $500 million for a company making $3 million
a quarter seems like a bit of a stretch. there is also the matter of the Sprott
lawsuit, which seems strange in that Sprott contended that the ceo backed out
of a loan in exchange for silver agreement and the CEO contends he never signed
a note. This seems like a pretty factual matter, so one party might be deemed
delusional. So the question becomes who?
I will research this more after i get some sleep. Now when i ran the numbers it
looked like each share represented 2 ounces of silver and that seemed appealing
assuming that they can it out of the ground in a timely cost effective way but
right now I have some concerns and may want to wait til i see how the
production increase affects profitability.

Hi Madharry -

Thanks for your over view on Aurcanna. I have only been following their
progress through their annual and quarterly reports. For me the value is the
potential if/when these mines come into full production. I will have to look
deeper into past and future litigation issues. I think we are on the same page
w/ having a portion of the portfolio in hard assets (ie. silver and/or gold)
and some of these jr. miners for me provide that value.

As always, stay diversified and do not have too large a position in any one
name as there can be specific stock risk that can sour the investment.

You need to revisit your research..

Sprott news is old where the lawsuit was tossed out by the courts because there
was no legal basis.. Sprott was just being churlish because they did not get
their hands on some cheap silver because the terms sheet signed by the
management was not legally binding and had yet to be approved by the BOD, who
refused to approve it because the terms were onerous..

Aurcana Completes Buy Back of Silver Stream Purchase Agreement From Silver
Wheaton
Wed, Dec 22, 2010 6:34 PM EST

<blockquote> http://goo.gl/et8iE </blockquote> Aurcana's buy back of their SLW
contract on their La Negra Mine for $25M was a pretty good deal especially when
their mineral reserves were increased in Q1 2012.

However, the stock is up big in the last year but I still believe the market
has not fully valued the future revenue streams that both of their mines will
produce. In 36 months the picture will become clearer and that's in line w/ my
expected holding period.

Lastly, other than Canada, the political risk is low since these properties are
located in Mexico next to the Texas border. It's the only pure silver play I
currently own.

I sold my SEP for a small profit after holding 14 months. Before that I owned
SE which is selling around the current price. I like their distribution area
and are set up to grow but at least since I have owned the shares, the stock
price(s) have been flat especially in the last six months. I moved the proceeds
into LNCO. I also sold my LINE and put that into LNCO.

I think the growth prospects are better for LNCO but they may be a bit more
leveraged than SEP. Have you looked at LNCO (they hold a large position in LINE
units)and compared them to SE and/or SEP.

Do you see better value in SEP or is it just a case of owning a MLP w/ the
least leverage and good FCF? I guess I got frustrated w/ SEP as I had a GTC
sell on this one @ $32 but eventually closed the position out @ $29.57 on their
xdiv date.

LNCO is the General Partner of LINE LP. as such, it represents a leveraged bet
on LINE's expansion and distribution growth. You are correct that LNCO has
better return potential but also much higher risk. I have not studied LNCO
before but it does look interesting, so I will have a look. Generally speaking,
I don't like E&P 's incorporated as MLP because E&P need to spend a lot of
Capex to replenish reserves while they are at the same time forced distribute
their earnings. This can lead to a situation where a falling commodity price
causes serious issues, since raising money via a secondary may not be possible
at reasonable conditions.

As far as SEP is concerned, this MLP generates 2.5$ in distributable cash
(~8.5%, indicating a good coverage of the 6.8% distribution ) and about 11.5x
EV/EBITDA. This is not extremely cheap but SEP has very low leverage
(BBB+credit rating) and virtually all the revenues are fee based, so there is
no direct commodity exposure whatsoever. This is quite differently from it's
sister MLP DPM, which processes NG and is very dependent on liquid prices for
example. SEP is one of the highest quality and safest MLP's due to low
leverage, the high credit rating of it's GP and the lack of commodity price
exposure.

I added a bit of SEP @28.7$ and Mog-A at 35.67$ today and started a position in
DVN at 54.35$. DVN is a cheap E&P (based on EV/proved reserves) that has shown
adept at monetizing their assets in the past,although operating results have
been somewhat poor, due to low NG and liquids prices. Quite a few value minded
investors have been buying this stock recently at higher prices (3rd. Avenue
Value amongst them). I think they are a prime acquisition target for a
multinational that wants to boost NA energy reserves.
