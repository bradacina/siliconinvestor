 I'll pass on DRL because I don't see how ROA - a measure I use to evaluate
banks - can be so very high - over 2.5% the last few years. /
The air for mortgage players like DRL and NFI and several S&L get thinner:

1) smaller yield spread for carry trade due to rising short term interest rates
2) Increasing risk of rising LT interest rates (inflation
3) Scrutinity for derivative accounting (see FNM).

Several S&L (NFB) have decided to reduce exposure to the mortgage sector, other
have taking a hit like WM. I suspect there is a chance to manouever the rougher
water, but it's going to be harder for players like NFI and DRL to do things
right. i still wonder how much of a hedge fund operation and how much of a real
business those players really are. I decided to pass on DRL as well.

Nice of You to Notice Novartis
Wednesday March 16, 3:22 pm ET
By Cliff Malings

The silent giant
If Novartis were a tree falling in the forest with nobody there to hear it, it
apparently wouldn't make a sound. Until lately, anyway. Novartis has been
strategically synchronized within its industry for some time with little
attention from Wall Street. The company posted $28.2 billion in sales for 2004,
making it No. 4 among its peers. The three companies outselling Novartis are
Pfizer (NSYE: PFE), with yearly sales of $52.5 billion; Johnson & Johnson, with
$47.3 billion; and GlaxoSmithKline , with $39 billion.
ADVERTISEMENT

The firm also ranks fourth in market capitalization, at $118.7 billion, and
manages to maintain a healthy net profit margin of 20.4% -- a figure that beats
Johnson & Johnson's 18.0% and compares favorably with best-in-class Merck's
26.8%.

A balanced portfolio
In many respects, Novartis is the Swiss Johnson & Johnson, given its more
holistic approach at developing its businesses in the health-care industry.
While many pharmaceuticals swing for the fence with the next blockbuster drug,
Novartis is different. It still swings for the fence, but it doesn't ignore the
value of a few good base hits.

Its strategy provides stable free cash flows from the likes of Gerber baby
foods and a well-established set of nutrition-supplement products that it uses
to fund its developments on the big drugs. As a result of $3.5 billion
dedicated to new drugs, Novartis boasts a strong pipeline, with more than 75
projects in R&D and 31 of those in the final phase 3 trials. The Novartis
pipeline has produced blockbusters such as Diovan, the worldwide leader among
angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) hypertension drugs, which produces more than
$3 billion in annual sales. Other key Novartis drugs include Gleevec, a highly
effective leukemia drug with promising future developments, and Lamisil, the
world leader in fungal nail infections, producing more than $1 billion
annually.

To brand or not to brand; why not both?
Novartis recently moved to acquire Hexal and Eon in an $8.3 billion all-cash
deal that will make Novartis the largest manufacturer of generic drugs in the
world. With this news, the Street finally heard the tree fall -- shares were up
nearly $2 to $50.90 upon the Feb. 22 announcement of the purchases. The
acquisitions are significant, since U.S. regulators are pushing to reduce drug
prices by exploring drug reimportation and giving earlier green lights to
generic manufacturers for patented drugs. What's more, Novartis will add a
heightened manufacturing competency in key markets -- Hexal in Europe, Eon in
the United States.

Generic-drug makers survive by being the most efficient of the low-cost,
high-capacity manufacturers. Novartis has taken a leap forward in developing
its strategy to match a marketplace that favors the proficiencies of the
generic-drug business. The company can still collect a premium on its newly
developed drugs, and when the time comes to go generic, Novartis can simply
roll that drug onto its generic-manufacturing line. Why eat the steak and toss
a perfectly good bone?

The cash deal will allow Novartis to realize benefits without the burden of
further debt. Not that the company can't handle more debt, though. The firm
carries a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.20, compared with an industry average of
0.25. This affords Novartis room to assume more debt to fund deals like this
one, or future ones, and remain comfortable relative to its peers. But did
Novartis overpay for its current acquisition? It's difficult to say, since the
synergies created by the acquisitions are impossible to measure at this point.
The extent to which the company can realize synergistic benefits largely
represents the inherent risk of these deals. On one hand, Novartis can reduce
manufacturing costs company-wide, realize additional cash flows, and feed its
generic line from its patented drug line. On the other hand, will it realize
synergies that offset the price paid? Will it be able to balance the different
business cultures? Will it be able to manipulate the traditional bidding
process for drugs that lose patents? That all remains to be seen.

After the tree has fallen
Novartis is poised to enjoy profits on its innovations both pre- and
post-patents. This is just one more feather in the cap for the management team
as it secures its grip on an already-sound strategic position within its
industry. The Street has now heard the tree, but will it continue to listen?
Only a Fool would speculate on this question -- so here I go.

Novartis tends to maintain a sure but steady business approach. The company is
more likely to shoot the easy, high-percentage layup as apposed to the
540-degree-behind-the-back slam dunk. As a result, it still scores points, but
it doesn't always get the crowd on its feet. The company is more likely to pay
attention to its long-term strategy than make its quarterly earnings to the
penny. And its more-reserved European marketing approach goes less noticed
here. This silent giant is therefore likely to slip off Wall Street's radar
once again. But you can rest assured that some smart money and some industry
watchers will be following Novartis intensely. The marriage of big pharma and
generic drugs sets a new precedent that, if successful, could set a new
industry standard.

Riverdance through the minefield. I like that but at some point there has to be
some kind of measured balance of the effectiveness of the drug vis-a vis
potential lethal side effects and can those risks be managed. The alternative
will be people with MS for example flocking to foreign specialty clinics for
treatments which will much less monitored than if the drug were carefully
administered in the U.S.A. I am beginning to wonder if aspirin could garner fda

re Book value of mutual conversion thrifts:
it does not appear that the stockholders from the 1st IPO own the shares that
are not offered and held by the holding company. From what i learned gleaning
into S1 is that the valuation should be done as if 100% of the shares were
offered to the public (even if that is not the case). Fore example assume a
hypothetical Mutual thrift with 50M $ in shareholder capital. If this company
would issue 10M$ @10$ each, the shareholder capital would grow from 50M$+100M$
(IPO proceeds) to 150M$ or 15$/share. If the mutual thrift issues only 50%
during the initial IPO the new companies shareholder capital will be 50M$+50%of
100M$=100M$ plus there will be 5M$ in the holding company. This holding company
will very likely issue the shares at a later date, in any case they do not
belong to the current shareholders:

This is what I read from Kearny's S1:

Possible Conversion of Kearny MHC to Stock Form.

In the future, Kearny MHC may convert from the mutual to capital stock
form in a transaction commonly known as a "second-step conversion." In a
second-step conversion, members of Kearny MHC would have subscription rights to
purchase common stock of Kearny Financial Corp. or its successor, and the
public
stockholders of Kearny Financial Corp. would be entitled to exchange their
shares of common stock for an equal percentage of shares of the fully converted
company. Kearny Financial Corp.'s public stockholders, therefore, would own
approximately the same percentage of the resulting entity as they owned before
the second-step conversion. This percentage may be adjusted to reflect any
assets owned by Kearny MHC.

muwis123, regarding stocks that delist: I've had a few go that route. Some
stocks have subsequently dropped in price; some have risen. Since I am one who
hopes "value will out", I tell myself I have to be indifferent to where the
stock trades or doesn't trade, because it's the business's results that
ultimately determine value. (aside: For example,I'm still holding all my few
shares of MHCO.pk. mentioned in previous post.)

My guess is that company stock holders see delisting as a negative, and if any
stockholders were considering selling, the announcement or the actual delisting
might cause them to take some action . So I suspect there's a tendency for the
stock to drop and maybe stay down longer than if the company were listed.

Fwiw, as regards GNRL. I like the bearing companies. Making bearings requires
good technology and manufacturing expertise. (Critical tolerances and high
volume production are not an easy business.) As regards customers, since
there's a myriad of mechanical devices that require the little darlings
(usually bearings are little, but as you may know, not always), when one
manufacturing sector is down, there are often others that aren't, so this
supports demand for bearings. Finally, bearings are mostly (but not always) a
small cost of the overall manufactured product - pennies if that-, so bearing
price increases are usually more easily accepted by customers. (This all jmo; I
could be wrong.)
GNRL has a low psr and p/book. However in past, GNRL has mostly had low psr and
p/bk values (as befits what investors might consider a slow growth, mundane
business). I don't see the stock as a particular bargain at current price (I
could be wrong again). Perhaps GNRL holders are in for the long haul, in which
case delisting might be a non-event.

AIG. I'm holding on to my small position. Most of my recent buys were in '03 at

$60.84 and $69.90 (What possessed me?). I'm a little hesitant now, but I'll
likely add if stock drops around $55+ level.

Not often can you get this stock under 2x book. Psr is relatively good too.
Very good net profit margins every year - maybe those results will continue. I
don't like historical and current ROE though: should be higher than 13%-15% if
one has to pay up-- 2x book value-- for the stock. OTOH, you get one behemoth

On 2/15/05 posted a summary of SLXI which I had been buying at $ .25 to $ .43

Stock has more than doubled the last few days. Hit a high of $ .95 today. As
with many such stocks including TPE sold 1/2 position on double and carry rest

Here's summary of current stock I bought last week, yesterday and today and
probably tomorrow since I am the only person on the planet paying any attention
to it (as in the case of TPE, SLXI, et. al. you can bet that I have done my
homework) :

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=21114117

Unusual Situation

I have to be one of the few persons on the planet following this unusual
situation. The same was true for Teton Petroleum (TPE). Just as we had an event
(pending acquisition of large land holdings) in Teton that was buried in an SEC
filing we also have in this situation some recent key catalysts that should
benefit the stock substantially in my opinion.

When you have these catalysts and you are able to recognize them as such the
results can be explosive. It is extremely difficult many times to decipher the
catalysts. Being ancient and very experienced helps in this exercise. Once upon
a time in another life, I was Prez of a Venture Capital Company so I know a tad
about intellectual property.

The following is meant to help you to do your own due diligence and make your
own decisions. You determine your own destiny, no one else. Investing in the
stock market involves high risk including this situation. As always I eat my
own cooking so I do own shares in this company. I am not aware of any
newsletter covering the Company. I did find a Company summary (I noted a few
errors in it) by using Google.

This is a Company in complete transition. Let me repeat so it sinks in, this is
a Company in complete transition. This creates the opportunity IMO. What does
this imply? IMO we probably won't recognize the Company in several months. We
are likely to see dramatic changes to the Company over the next several months.
I would imagine a new name. Hopefully a new website. Hopefully a cleanup of
their balance sheet (I happen to be a CPA also and this is the first thing I
look at. I don't like their current balance sheet. However, I recognize how
very easily their balance sheet could be cleaned up. This has to be a top
priority of management IMO. Ask yourself why would a world class intellectual
property team join this Company???? ) ETC. ETC. ETC.

The opportunity is created by this transition. Change is our friend here. We
watched AMRS build from scratch since they had no operations at the beginning.
Here all the pieces have already been assembled, it is just a matter of
execution. The Company has put together a world class team to carry out part of
the execution. This only insures success in my mind. I am betting on the world
class team!

parties involved in search technologies, XML applications and other data
management applications. The recent auction of the CommerceOne patent portfolio
(KEY) related to XML applications sold for over $15 million highlights (KEY)

monetizing IP assets, and we believe Market Central is (KEY) approaching and
preparing itself for the next wave in IP asset management. Many people, lawyers
in particular, are still looking at IP assets as a bundle of (KEY) legal rights
that you need to assert in court in order to get some money out of them,"
Bryant said. However, he said "some (KEY-this press release had to be approved

us extract the greatest value from our growing intellectual property portfolio.
With this team, we have done that," stated Bryant.

"We appreciate the confidence that Market Central has placed in us to help
bring together a truly remarkable team of intellectual property experts,"
commented Sterne. "With its intellectual property strategy and the creation of
this team, Market Central has positioned itself well to (KEY) successfully
maximize the value of its innovations. We look forward to working with Market

The SECOND KEY Catalyst is the marketing of the Company's IP
Technology---IMO---The world class IP team would not have come on board if they
did not believe this IP technology had some merit! This could be a huge market
need to address:

What problem the Company's technology is attempting to address:

Search’s Missing Ingredient

The rapidly expanding information pool is restricting search users’ ability to
find the information that they want based on their initial queries. The missing
ingredient in the current search technology is relevance. The average user puts
in 1.8 words in the initial query and gets back anywhere from 1,000 to 100,000
or even millions of “hits”. Even the best technologies are limited and
inefficient when attempting to create true relevance at this scale. The
algorithms used today by existing search engines produce results that amount to
an arbitrary guess at what the user had in mind. The next step in search
technology has to be one in which the user can effectively and intuitively
communicate relevance criteria to the system with a minimum amount of effort.

http://www.marketcentral.com/our_company5.html

"The Company has developed a next-generation suite of solutions that include
proprietary, patented software for data capture, cleansing, mining,

The Company's proprietary and patented software was acquired in July, 2003 when

The software has harnessed artificial intelligence within a new state of the

technology that enables the integration of any data (e.g. text, database
tables, fields, objects, spreadsheets, graphics, video, etc.); performs

Ask yourself how big in terms of market cap is Google? $ 51 BILLION. This is
not to say that this Company is the next Google. It merely indicates the
importance placed on such IP technology. I also recall that Google paid Yahoo
some $ 300 million just before their IPO:
http://www.cbc.ca/story/business/national/2004/08/09/googleyahoo040809.html

Yahoo paid IN 2003 $ 1.6 Billion for Overture.
http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/21908.html Y

The point of the above is to show this is a large market. This Company has a
tiny market cap. The reason it is, is because it is in transition. When the
dust clears from the Company's transition, will a brilliant diamond appear or
coal?

I have decided to bet with the world class intellectual property team just
brought on board. They are the real professionals.

Homebuilder TARR: Bought back shares I previously sold, and upped position.

I am hoping they are still are target to at least meet their '05 estimates:

"Tarragon Corporation simultaneously announced its 2005 earnings guidance. Net
income for fiscal 2005 is expected to be $75 to $80 million, or approximately
$3.85 to $4.10 per share, fully diluted, based on projected total consolidated
revenue of $475 to $525 million." 1/5/'05 p.r.

Would be a p/e about 5 or under at today's closing price ($19.48). That's too
low a p/e. (Maybe -- and also having to assume -with no evidence - that '06
earnings won't drop substantially from '05.)

From:Carl Worth
the only thing about that guidance is that it is pre-split i believe, as TARR
did a 3 for 2 split in the interim, so the adjusted guidance would be about
2.60 to 2.80 a share, still not bad for a stock trading at 19 and change

that said, the company seems to be executing well in its space, and my
non-industry-insider view is that the condo business is a decent place to be at
this point, with prices reasonable and demand increasing from aging buyers who
don't want to do yard work, and/or are buying second "homes" in areas like
florida and arizona

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050321/lam010_3.html

normally it's a good sign to see real estate companies being proactive, in the
same way that successful investors are usually proactive, making adjustments to
their portfolio to improve its quality and results for the long term

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050131/lam012_1.html

quote from their recent earnings release, where they talked about selling more
rental property to fund their home building business without diluting their
stock:

"While the 2004 numbers were extremely strong, it is the homebuilding pipeline
that fuels our confidence in Tarragon's continued rapid growth," Friedman said.
"Our homebuilding pipeline includes over 3,800 units with potential sales in
excess of $1.5 billion in communities where we have site control, and have
initially determined project feasibility. Our pipeline one year ago was less
than $700 million."

SourceWare Knowledge Management Engine - Next Generation Search Engine

SourceWare Knowledge Management Engine is a patented “Intent” based search
engine built on AI with automatic classification for simultaneously searching
both unstructured and structured data without the need to manually define
variations (e.g., spelling, synonyms, stems, language) or translate data into a
common format. SourceWare dynamically calculates appropriate topics based on
user natural language like search input and the contents of results the user
selects via an advanced and proprietary deductive search process that produces
a small set of highly personally relevant results to the user. SourceWare
Knowledge Management Engine significantly increases knowledge workers
productivity and enterprise’s knowledge management while dramatically reducing
the organization’s technical resources to develop and maintain the databases
and search applications.

MY COMMENTS AND ANALYSIS----WHY WOULD A WORLD CLASS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TEAM
JOIN THIS COMPANY ??????

I have to be one of the few persons on the planet following this unusual
situation. The same was true for Teton Petroleum (TPE). Just as we had an event
(pending acquisition of large land holdings) in Teton that was buried in an SEC
filing we also have in this situation some recent key catalysts that should
benefit the stock substantially in my opinion.

When you have these catalysts and you are able to recognize them as such the
results can be explosive. It is extremely difficult many times to decipher the
catalysts. Being ancient and very experienced helps in this exercise. I know a
tad about intellectual property.

This is meant to help you to do your own due diligence and make your own
decisions. You determine your own destiny, no one else. Investing in the stock
market involves high risk including this situation. As always I eat my own
cooking so I do own shares in this company. I am not aware of any newsletter
covering the Company. I have no association with the Company. I did find a
Company summary (I noted a few errors in it) by using Google.

This is a Company in complete transition. Let me repeat so it sinks in, this is
a Company in complete transition. This creates the opportunity IMO. What does
this imply? IMO we probably won't recognize the Company in several months.
Hopefully a cleanup of their balance sheet (I happen to be a CPA and this is
the first thing I look at. I don't like their current balance sheet. However, I
recognize how very easily their balance sheet could be cleaned up. This has to
be a top priority of management IMO. Ask yourself why would a WORLD CLASS
intellectual property team join this Company???? ) ETC. ETC. ETC.

I calculate there are about 7 million common shares outstanding---see press
release for shares retired in November 2004--Yahoo shares outstanding is
WRONG---The float is about 2 million shares per profile---There is 5 million
shares of Series A preferred convertible one-for-one and about 4 million Series
B preferred convertible one-for-one--note even if they do convert these would
be restricted shares and not freely traded until securities regulations
complied with.

There are approximately 5 million options outstanding at average price over $ 2
a share and 3 million warrants to purchase shares at approximately $ 2.40 a
share. Note that the exercise prices are north of current market price which is
positive IMO.

The opportunity is created by this transition. Change is our friend here. The
Company has put together a world class team to carry out part of the execution.
This only insures success in my mind. I am betting on the world class team
listed below! END

Here is the Company's press release ---I have added the word "KEY" to parts
that I believe (IMHO) are extremely important--Realize also that all the
parties had to approve the wording of this press release--that in itself is
KEY:

Market Central Launches Intellectual Property Asset Management Program

Market Central, Inc. (MKTE), a knowledge management company specializing in
solutions that enable businesses to efficiently store, categorize and retrieve
information with state-of-the-art technologies, today announced the formation
of a team of leading intellectual property advisors to assist the company with
intellectual property planning, identifying parties interested in the Company's
intellectual property and structuring possible transactions.

The Company has retained (KEY) Sterne, Kessler, Goldstein & Fox, P.L.L.C.
("SKGF"), Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati ("WSGR"), and Inflexion Point
Strategy LLC to support this effort. The team will be led by Doyal Bryant, CEO
and Paul Odom, Chief Scientist overseeing the development of Market Central's
patents; Robert G. Sterne, Founder and Director, SKGF; Donald J. Featherstone,
Director, SKGF; Trevor Chaplick, Partner, WSGR; Michael Raschid, Partner; WSGR;
and Ron Laurie, Co-Founder and Managing Director, Inflexion Point Strategy.

Market Central has a growing intellectual property portfolio that includes
patents, patent applications and innovations that (KEY) may be of interest to
parties involved in search technologies, XML applications and other data
management applications. The recent auction of the CommerceOne patent portfolio
(KEY) related to XML applications sold for over $15 million highlights (KEY)
the potential value of IP assets in this area. "There are many approaches to
monetizing IP assets, and we believe Market Central is (KEY) approaching and
preparing itself for the next wave in IP asset management. Many people, lawyers
in particular, are still looking at IP assets as a bundle of (KEY) legal rights
that you need to assert in court in order to get some money out of them,"
Bryant said. However, he said "some (KEY-this press release had to be approved
by all parties) leading companies, like ours, are starting to use those
intangible assets to create new businesses and market their technologies."

"Our announcement today is just the next step in the Market Central's growth as
a leading knowledge management technology company. With the existing high-level
interest in XML and next generation search and document content management
technologies, we believe the (KEY) time is right for us to (KEY) aggressively
move our technology and IP strategies forward. We decided that our best course
of action was to surround ourselves with leading professionals, who can assist
us extract the greatest value from our growing intellectual property portfolio.
With this team, we have done that," stated Bryant.

"We appreciate the confidence that Market Central has placed in us to help
bring together a truly remarkable team of intellectual property experts,"
commented Sterne. "With its intellectual property strategy and the creation of
this team, Market Central has positioned itself well to (KEY) successfully
maximize the value of its innovations. We look forward to working with Market
Central and the other team members," he added.

"Market Central has a (KEY) bold vision for commercializing its technology and
monetizing its intellectual property assets," noted Laurie. "The Company has an
(KEY because who is saying this:) intriguing IP portfolio. I am excited to work
with Market Central to identify potential partners that share its vision."

"We are very excited about working with Market Central in order to help develop
a strategy to leverage its intellectual property assets," said Trevor Chaplick,
Managing Partner of the Reston, Virginia office of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &
Rosati, a leading legal advisor to growth and technology enterprises. He added,
"We hope to be an integral part of the business and legal team that helps
Market Central achieve its strategic objectives regarding such intellectual
property."

Background of Ron Laurie:

BSIE U.C. Berkeley, JD U.S.F. Ron has worked in Silicon Valley for over 40
years, first as a software engineer and then as one of the nation's top
intellectual property lawyers. As an attorney, Ron advised computer,
communications, semiconductor, media and financial services companies on IP
strategy—a subject he taught at Stanford and U.C. Berkeley law schools—with a
focus on the strategic use of IP assets in complex business transactions. Ron
was a founding partner of the Silicon Valley offices of Skadden Arps and Weil
Gotshal, and led IP teams in some of the largest technology deals in history,
worth over $50 billion. Ron has been listed in virtually every peer review
survey of leading IP lawyers including Top 25 California IP Lawyers, Best
Lawyers in America, America's Leading Business Lawyers, Global Counsel 3000,
and International Who's Who of Business Lawyers.

Understanding Laurie's "monetizing IP assets":

http://www.ip-strategy.com/press/capitalizingonip.html

"There are many approaches to monetizing IP assets, and we believe this is
going to be the next wave in IP management."

The SECOND KEY Catalyst is the marketing of the Company's IP
Technology---IMO---The world class IP team would not have come on board if they
did not believe this IP technology had some merit! This could be a huge market
need to address:

What problem the Company's technology is attempting to address:

Search’s Missing Ingredient

The rapidly expanding information pool is restricting search users’ ability to
find the information that they want based on their initial queries. The missing
ingredient in the current search technology is relevance. The average user puts
in 1.8 words in the initial query and gets back anywhere from 1,000 to 100,000
or even millions of “hits”. Even the best technologies are limited and
inefficient when attempting to create true relevance at this scale. The
algorithms used today by existing search engines produce results that amount to
an arbitrary guess at what the user had in mind. The next step in search
technology has to be one in which the user can effectively and intuitively
communicate relevance criteria to the system with a minimum amount of effort.

From old website:

"The Company has developed a next-generation suite of solutions that include
proprietary, patented software for data capture, cleansing, mining,
integration, search and intelligent document recognition.

The Company's proprietary and patented software was acquired in July, 2003 when
it purchased the assets of Pliant Technologies. The software automates the
capture, search, cleansing, workflow management, and information mining of all
types of unstructured and structured data.

The software has harnessed artificial intelligence within a new state of the
art search engine based around its SourceWare&#174; product which uses patented
technology that enables the integration of any data (e.g. text, database
tables, fields, objects, spreadsheets, graphics, video, etc.); performs
sophisticated searches of data for mission critical information; and mines data
for business intelligence.

This is a rapidly growing area in the B2B market since more than 80% of
referenced information in business is unstructured. Market Central's software
provides digitalized structure and the ability to group data to unveil patterns
useful to business development. The market for intelligent document capture
alone is estimated at $250M with a CAGR of 6.1% to 15.6%.

Market Central's software has been awarded five (5) patents (one is pending).
Moving forward, the company will focus its efforts on acquiring and developing
technologies that improve the way businesses and people communicate,
collaborate, search, and share information. This new direction is designed to
strengthen Market Central and help shape the future growth of the company in
demand markets such as search, collaboration/customer service, and Intelligent
Document Recognition (IDR).

The Company has recently signed a Letter of Intent to acquire the assets of
Convey Systems, Inc. including patents, intellectual property, software, and
certain other assets, from Convey's parent company, The Tag Group, Inc. (PNK:
TGGP) and the Board has entered into an interim management agreement naming Mr.
Doyal Bryant, President and CEO of Convey Systems, to serve as the President
and CEO of Market Central, Inc., pending the consummation of the transaction.

In addition, Mr. Preston Rodenbaugh, an executive officer in Convey, will serve

CONCLUSION:

Ask yourself how big in terms of market cap is Google? $ 51 BILLION. This is
not to say that this Company is the next Google. It merely indicates the
importance placed on such IP technology. What is "Next Generation Search
Engine" worth?

This Company has a tiny tiny market cap.

I also recall that Google paid Yahoo some $ 300 million just before their IPO:

http://www.cbc.ca/story/business/national/2004/08/09/googleyahoo040809.html

Yahoo paid in 2003 $ 1.6 Billion for Overture.
http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/21908.html Y

The point of the above is to show this is a large market.

This Company has a tiny market cap. The reason it is, is because it is in
transition. When the dust clears from the Company's transition, will a
brilliant diamond appear or coal?

I have decided to bet with the WORLD CLASS intellectual property team just
brought on board. They are the real professionals !!! END

Market cap/ deposits. KRNY is bigger and more liquid but not as profitable and

I'm taking positions in 2 mortgage reits - the analysts are saying they're
going to tank due to the Fed hikes - but the companies themselves are saying
they're going to continue turning out profits & dividends - these are risky -
but i think worth it - here goes:

#1 - (IMH) Impac Mortgage -
- they're behind on their Sarbanes & 10-K filings - but they're saying they're
going to file unaudited 10K - won't effect their dividen payments - etc... I
believe them. They pay $3 annual dividend - stock @ $16.11 - range: $16 -
$27.91

#2 - NEW - New Century Financial Corp
- $32.90 book value - dividends expected to rise from the current $6.20/share
level - $9 eps projected in '05 - &#183; goal is to eventually distribute 100%
of the reit’s taxable income - earned $8.29 in ’04 vs. $6.32 in ‘03 - confident
they can increase dividends in future periods - at $44.06/share - i think the
selling is way overdone

TARR - FWIW, I bought the stock many, many years ago as a January Effect
speculation. Since then it changed its name several times, merged, done a
rights offering, split off a high yield bond, and undergone multiple splits.
It's a 40-50 bagger for me.

However, last month I was in Palm Beach and saw a big special report in the
Palm Beach Post titled "Winning the Real Estate Game". They recounted multiple
anecdotes about ordinary folks flipping properties and buying spec condos with
interest only loans. One 'lucky' guy bragged about how he was able to buy an
$800,000 condo on an income of $34,000.
(http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/content/news/special_reports/housing_boom/in
ex.html)

I talked to a friend next door to me whose girlfriend is buying a spec
penthouse in West Palm, a condo in Las Vegas, and a condo in Dallas.

In the rental car van, returning to the airport, there was a late 20's kid
loudly dickering with his mortgage guy via cellphone for a condo he was buying.

I overheard several other folks in the airport waiting area talking about the
condo's they were buying.

I should have visited the shoeshine guy to see whether he was playing in the
market, as well.

I remembered the Friedman nearly bankrupted this company several names ago
during the last real estate downdraft, after he overbuilt, overpromised, and
overleveraged.

When I got home, I sold all my TARR.

I hope for your sake that I'm flat out wrong.

TARR - coda: my understanding of Tarragon's game plan is that they would buy
old high-rise apartment buildings and reorganize them as condo units. Then they
started building new highrise condo buildings. Recently they've 'sold' out all
the units a year or more prior to final delivery. My understanding is that
70-90% of these units are purchased with the buyers intending to 'flip' them.
Buyers never intended to move in.

Tarragon has these projects in South Florida, Hoboken, New Jersey (and several
other hot real estate markets in the US).

Problem with the company projections is that down payments aren't sales. These
guys are leveraged to interest rates and building non-productive assets in a
jobless recovery. Palm Beach County has a service economy but its housing is so
expensive that employees can't afford to live in the county. (I didn't punch
into Dade and Broward county data.) I-95 is a virtual parking lot at rush hour,
and gas prices are going up.

And interest rates are going up. Or are they? Al Greasepan is still lagging the
inflation I see, but the 10 year bond keeps sending the message that it's no
big deal, or there's a recession ahead. I'm confused. But if increases in
commodity prices, gas, energy, construction, housing, food, insurance,
education, etc. mean inflation, then the pricing of houses on the basis of the
monthly payment should stall, or decline.

I thought that there was an iron relationship in residential real estate
wherein buyers were cautioned to not spend more than 2.5-3.5 X their annual
salary on a house. At current pricing, on the coasts, folks are twice that. And
their incomes are not going up.

But, what do I know?

Blankmind -re bank conversion - i want to thank you for bringing this
interesting theme up on this board. There seem to be quite a few opportunities
out there for small cap investors willing to go the extra mile. In my opinion
the most important factors to evaluate a S&L (and conversion) are:

1) Management quality (expense/efficiency ratio pre merger, ROA)
2) Demographics
3) Valuation

Most of these mutual S&L are somewhat poorly managed in terms of ROA and ROE
but when the management is capable and the bank is located in a growing and
affluent area they should be able to run the business more efficiently and
deploy the IPO proceeds profitably over time and the stock price should follow.
At least for 1st step conversions, an investor can get a foot into the door

wow, did this turn into the housing bubble thread?

i wasn't going to reply to your post the other day, figuring it was best to let
it go...however, noting first that i don't own TARR, and don't need your "best
wishes" or whatever for my non-existent investment there, i find it nearly
impossible to believe that you held TARR from a tax loss speculation to a 40 to
50 bagger, given your outlandishly negative view of the housing market, of
TARR, and of the world in general from the appearance of your posts...you held
it all that time, for a supposed return that most investors only dream of, then
dumped it all based on a few comments you heard in the airport and a shuttle?
umm...yeah <G>....that aside, addressing your most recent rant:

do you dispute that people have to live somewhere? do you dispute that this
makes it much less likely that they will "dump" their house if it drops in
value, as they would a tech stock? do you dispute that a piece of property with
a house on it in a nice part of the country has more inherent value than a
piece of paper announcing that you own part of a company that doesn't even have
a proprietary product, and which in many cases doesn't even turn a profit?

do you dispute that the baby boomer generation (the same one you think will
bankrupt medicare) is reaching the age where their kids are done with college,
and they can move wherever they want and own more than one house, as their
income continues to increase and their family related expenses actually
decrease? do you dispute that florida is an attractive destination for many of
these people, even if it may not be for you or i?

comparing a nationwide housing market, with a few areas which are hot, to the
technology bubble, where even the most solid of tech companies was wildly
overvalued, is irrational...it's a convenient metaphor, as everyone remembers
the tech crash, and that makes it easy to try to create fear with headlines and
statistics, but when you strip away the hyperbole, a house in a nice area that
has gone up 50 or 100% in a few years is nothing like a tech stock with no
earnings that has gone up 1000% or more from its IPO...a year later, that tech
stock may be worth basically nothing, and no one will want it, but a year
later, the house will still be worth somewhere near the same price, if not
more, and lots of people would be glad to live in it...not only that, but the
inherent value of the property will climb each year, regardless of how much
above that amount the current market price might be, and there will only be
more and more people in the US who need/want a house, whereas there may be no
one who needs the company's products...pick any 100 nasdaq stocks from march
2000 and pick any 100 houses in this country right now...i would hazard a guess
that the 100 nasdaq stocks were overvalued by somewhere between 200 and 500% on
average (even one of the strongest tech companies at that time, CSCO, was
overvalued by at least 400%, trading a P/E of 200 at its top of 80
bucks)...would you assign the same factor of overvaluation to the 100 houses
(using logic rather than your pessimistic view)?

clearly you don't understand or just want to minimize the tax advantages of
owning a home (the most important of which is not the yearly deductions, but
the tax free gains as you build equity), but the houses causing your concern
over pricing are not being sold to the "median" household, so your data doesn't
even make sense

comparing biotech investing, where your eventual profit is dependent on the
success of an individual company, to the benefits cities derive from businesses
locating in their area, is equally absurd...rather, the valid comparison is how
companies like SFCC and KNDL, etc., benefit from the fact that pharma and
biotech companies do testing of their products, and no matter which company is
eventually successful in developing a product to address a particular
condition, the "picks and shovels" companies are the ones which achieve the
most consistent profits from these activities (see the levi strauss comparison
from the gold rush days)

finally, the "new" houses that are 25% larger often cost less to heat and cool
than older, smaller houses...the last time we moved, our square footage
increased modestly, but our electric bills went down, and the newer houses
being sold in arizona are far more efficient than even ours, which was built in
the mid 90's

how can you know if facts fly in the face of reason when your "facts" aren't
even accurate?

Carl,
I'm not a financial genius and I've been wrong about real estate many times,
despite the fact that I've been a real estate broker for 20+ years. However,
from personal experience and also from extensive daily reading of many opinions
I tend to agree we are in a housing bubble. Not just in many parts of the USA
but in many areas worldwide.

Real returns cash on cash in real estate are generally at historic lows. New
buyers can't buy w/o help from Mom and Pop. The alternative of a 103% loan with
an adjustable rate followed by payments equalling 50% plus of net monthly
income is alarming to me.

NAR just released a report showing that 36% of homes bought in the US last year
were spec buys. Completely unsustainable IMO. I tell everyone I know to own
their own home free and clear. Needless to say, not many listen. Nearly
everyone where I live is paying more for their SUV monthly payment(then add
gas, ins.) than a typical mortgage payment was just 10 years ago. And wages
haven't kept pace...Except for construction and other real estate related
activities.

I guess we'll see what happens in year from now.

can you link me to that NAR report? sounds like interesting reading

i don't think it makes sense for most people to own their home free and
clear...when you consider that you can earn 8 to 10% a year on your money in a
well run balanced mutual fund, which grows tax free until you sell it, and in
the meantime, you are only paying 5 or 6% at most on a fixed rate mortgage,
which is effectively 3.5 to 4.2% after taxes for most people, the resultant 5%
or so net gain per year on your money is very attractive over the long term

owning your home free and clear doesn't mitigate the effects of an increase or
decrease in its value, though perhaps it does help psychologically

on average, people move about every 5 years anymore, so while i don't agree
with their being leveraged to anywhere near 100% of a house's value (even
though much of such risk is offset by PMI), i don't see anything wrong with a
LTV of 80%...i keep seeing all these concerns about LTV at levels much higher
than that, but in studying the reports of companies like NEW, NFI, etc., i
don't see them writing paper at these terms...who is writing this paper in any
quantity? just curious

Remember that most vacation homes are really for spec. In Hawaii that % is

"Remember that most vacation homes are really for spec."

Again, this is your interpretation, and simply adding the two numbers is
completely illogical for determining the true situation. Further, buying a home
as an investment is not inherently "speculative." It's only speculative, i.e.
risky beyond the normal situation, if the price is far above what could
reasonably be justified. This parameter is obviously open to debate, but your
figure of 35% spec purchases is clearly way too high.

This is comparable to saying, "Bankruptcies are at an all time high" without
any color to the statement. Of course they are, the population is at an all
time high too. What is the current percentage of households who are filing
bankruptcy? Oh, well that's lower than most recent years, but that doesn't sell
newspapers and TV advertising now, does it? LOL

"The typical vacation-home buyer is 55 years old and earned $71,000 in 2003."
This is precisely the type of buyer I was talking about, an empty nester who
has put his children through college and now has plenty of extra money to buy a
second home. Would you simply dismiss all such second home purchases as
motivated by investment decisions? If so, then how do you account for "86
percent of vacation-home buyers do not rent their property?" Why would anyone
who was buying a home as an investment not rent it out? Of course there are
some who are buying homes on "spec" to flip them as soon as they are completed,
but this data wouldn't apply to them, as they wouldn't be around long enough to
return the survey forms.

"Because the typical second-home buyer is a baby boomer, it's likely over the
next decade that second-home sales will remain historically high," Lereah said.
"The boomers are still in their peak earning years and have both the
wherewithal and the desire to purchase vacation homes and investment
properties."

Wow, the article seems to have the same opinion I do. Thanks for the
confirmation.

As for LTV, you didn't answer my question. I understand the concept of
leverage, and its advantages and disadvantages. What I'm asking is where is all
this supposed 100% LTV paper being written, and by whom?

Note as well that if you own stock on margin, when your stock goes down enough,
your broker will send you a margin call, which may force you to sell your
stock. This again is an illogical parallel to the housing market, because your
bank sure isn't going to call you to force you to sell your home if its value
drops. In addition, you can live without your stock positions, but you can't
live without some place of residence, so once again the parallel fails. Nice
try with the scary scenario, but again, the comparisons just don't add up.

more interesting info from your article:

Eighty-three percent financed with a mortgage and made a median downpayment of
22 percent. Although 45 percent use savings for a downpayment, 29 percent used
equity from a previous home.

Oops, 17% paid in full, but even the ones who financed had a LTV of 78% on
average, and half of those made the down payment from their savings (which
implies they have plenty of money to cover their expenses, so not much chance
of default or financially induced sale of the property, huh?)

This is great info, thank you again.

Carl Worth - If there's a real estate bubble, the ramifications will cycle
through investing, even 'value' investing.

I have neither interest in participating in ad hominem attacks, nor rebutting
your reasoning. I posted on TARR because I've never considered it a 'value'
investment. I purchased it as part of an end-of-the-year statistical 'basket'.
(I won't bore you with the math, but I assure you that the devil is in the
details.) Suffice it to say, my pupils dilated as the price increased. I
apologise for using metaphor in describing my sell rationale.

I confess that I'm one of those dopes who paid off his mortgage because it was
the equivalent of owning a 7% AAA bond, and I was unable to find similar
risk/reward ratio in the market. (As someone who pays AMT, the tax benefit of a
mortgage is ephemeral. I can get a zero points home equity loan with a phone
call should a great opportunity show up.)

I try not to mix price and value. My house would only return market price if I
were to sell it. Since I value living in it, I don't want to sell it. Then why
bother to price it?

I'm not pessimistic at all. I'm bored. Sitting with a lot of cash is boring.

Meanwhile, you might be interested in another 'hot' market - Las Vegas:

There are always going to be people who try to take shortcuts, whether it's in
the market, or real estate, or business, whatever. Anyone who would buy a piece
of property, especially a piece of property on (or basically consisting of) a
hill without seeing it in person deserves what they get. These types of stories
have been around forever, just check Ebay to see the kind of property that has
been and continues to be available based on pictures if you will just bring the
property taxes up to date. It's actually quite entertaining viewing to read the
listings. <g>

There's no doubt that the kind of appreciation that has been taking place in
these "hot" markets cannot continue. However, the fact that the appreciation
slows or stalls doesn't mean that values plummet, nor does it mean doom for the
housing market as a whole.

I see these articles and message board posts talking about investing in real
estate as if it's suddenly a ponzi scheme in its entirety, but the reality is
that real estate done right is a tremendous investment. The article cites one
person who bought a home that ended up selling for over 300K, yet she could
only rent it for $1250 a month. Homes that sell for much less than that near
our area rent for significantly more than $1250 a month, so it is likely that
she could have gotten more if she tried or had a management company working for
her. Obviously she had no idea what she was doing, and again, falls into the
category of someone trying to do things the "easy" way.

Any piece of real estate bought with less than 20% down is subject to PMI, so
the pieces mentioned in that article would all have that coverage. In addition,
PMI has tightened its terms of late, to reduce the ability of "investors" to
speculate on multiple properties, which should help to mitigate the effect of
that speculation on pricing and leverage. You can see what happens in a place
like Vegas, where things get too hot, and the market self-corrects. It didn't
ruin the market, just took the wind out of it for a short time, and gave people
a much needed reality check. The house mentioned is in foreclosure, but the
mortgage holder probably won't lose a penny, and the house will be sold to
someone who can afford it and the payments.

There is no doubt that there will be excesses and unsavory deals capitalizing
on people's desire to jump on the bandwagon, but this is likely to lead to
individual misfortune, rather than widespread trouble. IMHO of course.

To me real estate is like the stock market or anything else that someone does
looking for financial gain. Done well, it takes a lot of time and effort. There
will be some who get lucky, picking just the right high flyer stock and putting
all of their money into it just before it increases ten-fold, or doing
something similar in real estate. For most people, success will come with years
of hard work, occasional mistakes and lessons learned, and consistent long term
progress.

I have no desire to be a landlord, so my real estate investments consist of
REIT's, or the occasional company stock where they have real estate holdings
whose value isn't reflected in the current stock price. That said, tens of
thousands of people have made solid fortunes in real estate, and that will
continue to be the case. In this market as well, some may make mistakes, but
overpaying for a piece of real estate is more comparable to paying too much for
a solid company's stock, rather than paying too much for a dot.com bust waiting
to happen. You can hold your shares of the dot.com stock forever, and it's
never coming back, but real estate always appreciates over time, so even most
"mistakes" will turn out okay in the end. Again, whatever speculation there is
will cause individual misfortune in some cases, but isn't likely to cause
widespread dislocation, especially with the solid and continuing demand for
both first and second houses, as well as investment property.

"Investment" isn't a four letter word as it pertains to real estate, despite
its portrayal in these articles.

Help me out: what is PMI?

I can tell you (because I spent several hours in my County Hall of Records
snooping) that the majority my neighbors refinanced with some 30 year, a few 15
year, and many 7+1's and 5+1's. They were uniformly 80% of market rate (ie a
multiple of original cost). Nearly all added a kicker of a 10% home equity
loan. Some did 20%. They drive new cars. They outsource their yard work.
There's a spate of porticos, fountains, fences, garages, additions, etc.

This phenomenon isn't just speculation in 'hot' markets. For the last couple of
years these folks have been doing wheelies.

I hope that you are correct about the stability and durability of real estate,
because if a 20% down draft occurs at an inconvenient time, they won't have a
skin in the game.

And maybe I'll learn taxidermy.

Carl Worth: about real estate:

We know value can be related to "location, location, location". Most locations
- geographical parts of the country - seem to be desirable to a population
segment, so imo, sure, there's no widespread dislocation and it's been true
that property appreciates over time.

There are certain areas where real estate has not appreciated and is not likely
too. Syracuse NY, parts of the midwest, etc. where there's a net migration of
people out of the area. So real estate does not "always" appreciate, and
mistakes might not be overcome. OTOH, real estate, as you allude, if bought
right can work out as a satisfactory investment. And it doesn't necessarily
require capital appreciation if the price/rents, depreciation, expenses, etc.
pencil out okay for the would-be buyer.
-----------
IMO, it's just not enough to say if somebody overpays for property, property in
desirable areas eventually appreciates, and this makes the "mistakes" work out
okay.

There are several reasons for this, imo. If we talk about property bought as an
investment (as the articles give examples of), then there are two kinds:
owner-occupied and rental.

Most people haven't a clue how they might deal with losses. They don't expect
them, don't plan for them, and are embarrassed by them. It's one thing as an
owner to be paying a very large piti (principal, interest, taxes, insurance)
and be smug when one sees the houses next to you going up 10's of thousands of
dollars every month. Quite another to see prices coming down, for sale signs,
discouraging newspaper reports, and no end in sight - and paying out a large
portion of disposable income for what supposedly was a money-making
opportunity. One can tell oneself, oh well, it's a home and we live in it - but
that gets more difficult as trying times continue.

For people who have rental homes it's even worse. One psychological component
that will be raised will be this (considering here the couple who themselves
rent in California but bought a home as an investment in Las Vegas, assuming
they held on to it): the couple recognizes quite quickly property values aren't
going up and know that they have a negative (rents don't cover piti), and that
they might have to stick it out longer than they expected. What they eventually
also realize is that they are subsidizing their tenant and that their tenant
(in a nice, new house, subsidized by the owner) is living better than they are.
That's almost enough to make the owners walk away -g-. (speaking from my almost
experience anyway)

I'm one who believes people should try different investments. As a landlord,
I've experienced vandalism, fires, skips, lawsuits, tenants unable to pay
because of terminal illnesses, vacancies, etc. etc. From this, my wife and I
have learned we're not wired to be landlords: like you, I've found I'd rather
own reits and stocks related to real estate.

First time real estate investors may learn that bad times in real estate can
last a lot longer than one imagines and/or be more painful than one would've
believed. Knowing in your head that property in good areas eventually recovers
doesn't help the heart deal with the misery.

All jmo and experience. Others may have different viewpoints.

PMI is private mortgage insurance. This company is apparently the leading
provider of same, though I'm sure there are many others, as they likely
wouldn't be allowed to have a monopoly.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pmi

Here's an interesting article regarding the likelihood of price decreases in
various areas in the next two years. Note that the risk actually decreased from
the last report, though it is still quite significant in a few areas.

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/050224/245246_1.html

I hear people mention 20% price downdrafts, as you have, as if this is a common
occurrence. Other than the Great Depression (if it happened then), when has
this ever happened on a widespread basis? Sure the prices of the overinflated
new construction properties in Vegas dropped that much in October, but that was
after the homebuilders had raised their prices repeatedly, so it's like a stock
going from 12 to 20 to 16. This self-corrected and didn't affect the overall
Vegas market more than minimally. It certainly didn't affect the nationwide
market.

I am no proponent of people being overextended, but again, just because
someone's house stops appreciating 15 or 20% a year, as it surely has to, they
aren't going to abandon the house, and the bank isn't going to issue the
equivalent of a margin call. Even if the price dropped a few %, you wouldn't
see most people walking away from their house, as they have to have a place to
live. In the case of an investor, if the house is rented, their cash flow
position won't be affected by the house's value not appreciating for a while.
If it's a second home, they aren't going to care less about its value in a
particular month, or even year most likely.

When I bought my first house, it was not long before the RTC debacle. At that
time there was no PMI, and the S&L's were making loans that were absurd in
terms of people's income covering their payments. I have yet to receive any
credible answer showing me where any such risky loans are being written in any
quantity, and that is apart from the fact that we do now have PMI. Further, at
this point there is far more solid demand for property from buyers well able to
afford it, rather than so much new housing being built and sold to first time
buyers, who really couldn't afford it.

All of that said, prices didn't even drop 20% back then. Our house dropped from
around 80K to the low 70's, and it represented the lowest rung of available
housing, the most affected by the above conditions. Housing with a greater
interest to the more established households dropped far less.

There are sure to be foreclosures as there have always been, where a family
suffers a job loss or other misfortune, but whereas this snowballed in the days
that led up to the RTC having to be formed, PMI and a steady supply of buyers
make it rather unlikely that we will see a repeat of that earlier dislocation
IMHO. In fact, with property values rising and demand strong, without some kind
of widespread problem, it's unlikely that the mortgage holders would even
suffer any losses which would require them to draw on the PMI coverage, as most
properties could be sold for as much or more than the mortgage balance anyway.

As far as I understand the regulations, if your neighbors took seconds which
reduced their equity to less than 20%, they are paying PMI as well, even if
their original mortgage was for only 80% of the value. They may not even
realize this, but it would be interesting for you to ask a few of them.
Logically, it seems unlikely that a borrower could get around PMI by simply
taking an 80% mortgage and then adding a second, but it wouldn't be the first
time a loophole was created that easily. <g>

The couple who bought the property in Vegas and then could only a 330K home for
$1250 a month clearly had no idea what they were doing. As I said, there will
be individual misfortune, but this is picking out one unfortunate couple who
made a split second decision to commit to an obligation of hundreds of
thousands of dollars, and saying that it is an indication of a systemic
problem, which doesn't hold water. I find it nearly impossible to believe that
a house of that value (note that they didn't say the house had gone down
further in value, only that the couple couldn't afford it from the current cash
flow or their own finances) would only rent for $1250 a month. Note also that
they didn't even go through a qualification process to buy this property, as
they bought the contract from someone else.

As for real estate in areas where it hasn't appreciated, no one is paying any
inflated prices in those areas. I was referring to paying the recently higher
prices in the more popular areas, which aren't likely to suddenly become
unpopular.

There's no doubt that an atmosphere of declining prices, negative news, for
sale signs, etc. would be discouraging to some homeowners. Some of those
discouraged homeowners would likely even walk away from their homes, or sell
them (take the loss) and downsize. However, before that even comes into play,
first you have to get conditions that would even begin to move the market in
that direction. It's as if the bubble proponents see the above as something
that can happen overnight, without anything to cause it, other than various hot
markets where prices have risen rapidly.

How do we go from abundant demand, a growing base of baby boomers buying bigger
homes, second homes and perhaps even rentals as investments, echo boomers and
other younger buyers buying their first homes or upgrading same, backlogs at
homebuilders of months or even years, listings in strong areas which sell in
days if not hours, a strong economy, job growth and now income growth, an
always finite supply of land, especially important in the strongest areas,
etc., to the despair of falling prices, for sale signs, and negative news?

You could say a recession, but the housing market already went through the
dot.com bubble bursting, the post Y2K recession with employment and wage
weakness, and 9/11 basically without missing a beat. You could say another
terrorist attack, but all that does is promote cocooning (see above). You could
say massive defaults, but what is going to cause that?

I just don't see the catalyst for a significant downturn, but as you say, I've
been wrong before. <g>

Several of my buddies and I each bought one or more newly built duplexes back
in those days. All in the same area, same streets. Properties went from roughly
$65-70k to 90K at peak down to about maybe under $20K at the low. My buddies
all walked - other than a few letters, maybe a phone call (I forget), nothing
happened to them other than a mark on credit reports. Nobody cared about that.
Guys sweated it for a while though - we're talking Texas, a tough state on
"criminals".

Maybe there were just so many people walking away from their properties,
powers-that-be decided they couldn't or wouldn't go after everybody (which they
did do in the Depression - making it worse for everybody(??)).

My wife - with some encouragement from my accountant -, decided tough beans for
me (us) - I made the agreement, and I was going to have to stick to it.
(High-minded people can be a real pain.)

One dilemma for me was I had original loan 80% of $70K at 11%+ and I wanted to
refi, banks would do it ONLY VERY RELUCTANTLY and just as suggested by a
previous poster - namely, okay the new loan amount will be 80% of value (value
now $20K) = 16K loan at prevailing rate 8%+-. Meaning I would have to pay down
the mortgage to 16K from 56K before bank would "help" me. Plus all sorts of
closing costs & fees. Such a deal.

I remember trying to get welfare people into one of my places, just to keep it
rented. Hah! Welfare people received a fixed amount of money to live on (so I
figured they'd pay). However, in the market downturn, rents all over the city
decreased, and for what the gov't gave welfare recipients (amt. did not
decrease), they could now afford better than my place and in a better area of
town. Jeez - turned down by welfare recipients. That was a head-shaker.
-----------------
Here's a possible learning point: It's like they say about buying a hotel. You
want to be the second buyer, not the first buyer. The first buyer buys when
times look good and prices are high. You buy from the first buyer when the
downturn comes and he or his compatriots have to sell.
The person who made out real well with "our" duplexes was an old lady who came
in around $18-20K per and scooped up a half-dozen or dozen at foreclosure
prices and terms, and then sold ten-fifteen years later.

the property, OR they can come after the borrower. But they can't do both.
Hence, during the last real estate downturn, whole developments in High Desert
areas like Palmdale just mailed in their keys.

I know folks who just walked away. It must have done something ugly to their
credit, but they were able to get a mortgage on another house a few years
later.

With today's securitization, I'm not sure who gets the REO when someone
defaults. I'm told that WM's recent decline reflects the fact that they are
carrying a fair number of their own loans.

 if a guy walks away from your mortgage - & the bank suffers a loss on the
foreclosed property - doesn't the bank hire a collection agency to go after the
guy?

If the bank couldn't collect the debt when the threat was that the guy would
lose his home, then what does anyone else have to hold over his head that would
work? The bank could, like some car financiers go after a deficiency judgement.
But again, the main asset for most folks is their house, so what would they be
able to attach the judgement to?

In these times with so many purchases being second homes and speculative
properties, there might be other recourse (attaching to the primary residence)
that wasn't there in the late 80s. But this recourse would only be open to a
portion of the cases.

PMI covers a lender for only part of the defaulted loan, usually only about 13%
or so if I recall correctly. I know it is required for LTVs over 80% so one
would assume 20% coverage but IIRC, it isn't quite like that in reality. It's
been a long time since I was active in the mortgage business. But, in any
event, it is likely that the lender will still experiences major losses in
worse-case scenarios.

The trend over the last 10 years has been to avoid PMI with two techniques and
these have some very widespread usage: The first techniques is to do piggy-back
mortgages where the first mortgage will be up to 80% and then, in the same
underwriting (usually) a second mortgage is approved at a slightly higher rate
for the balance between the first and what's needed. The second technique is
that lenders self-insure and do this by offering the client a slightly higher
interest rate for the whole loan in lieu of charging the PMI. It is often to
the buyer's advantage to take them up on the offer because the P&I at the
higher rate is lower than the P&I on the lower plus the PMI.

The danger to the real estate market that I see is not whether prices are too
high or not, but the combinations of laxer underwriting standards as evidenced
by houses being bought, financed, sold, financed at more money, sold, etc. This
can't happen unless the underwriters turn a semi-blind eye to the rapid rises
and use appraisals that are compliant with an aggressive market. Additionally a
higher and higher percentage of the total new mortgage originations are with
variable rates. A few year ago, the ARM du jour was the 5/1 (fixed for the
first 5 years), the last couple of years it is increasingly the 3/1. These high
percentages of ARMs put many borrowers under tremendous pressure if rates go up
and stay up for any protracted (year or two) period of time. Finally the last
bit of underwriting shenanigans seemingly pretty popular these days is the
interest-only loan. I'm not sure at what level LTV these are being written, but
it wouldn't surprise me in a hot market to see some at 100% LTVs.

A higher interest rate environment could serve to trigger so much debt service
distress that the mortgage A/R depts. start tightening up their efforts upon
the first hint of late payments. If this happens, the "problem loans" reports
start increasing which will, in turn, lead to someone starting to reign in the
underwriters. Higher problem loans will result in quicker foreclosures and
rising interest rates will serve to bring more houses on the market for sale.
Tighter underwriting will mean fewer eligible buyers, so a lower demand.

The above scenario will usually first hit at the level of the most leveraged
buyers but then as supply outpaces demand and prices start to drop, has the
potential to spread to those who were previously thought to be no problem.

In my view, it isn't the home prices that create the problem, it is the
overheated nature of the market and the potential for long term rates to rise
off of 40 year lows.

One other issue: Has anyone ever seen a clause or two on their credit cards
that basically allows the credit grantor to jump the rate to over 20% if the
client is late on any bill? What ramifications would this system have if
mortgages start being a problem?
