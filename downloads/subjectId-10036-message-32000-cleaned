Getting set up for tomorrow. Intending to add small to ORCL (first add since
'06).

It's a value stock again (imo).

Superb profit margins in each of past ten years. P/sales is high of course, but
has dropped now to a nine year low. Meanwhile sales keep increasing -- per
Yahoo: Qtrly Revenue Growth (yoy): 24%. D/e about 50/50. (Which is high
relative to the industry) Cash&cash equiv about equal debt.

P/E on S&P Oper. EPS 2009E = 13.3. Average p/e hasn't been that low in a
decade. Low p/e for the year in past decade was 5 (an anomaly in '99), next
lowest for the year was 14 in '98.

S&P rates it 5*: "Our risk assessment reflects potential acquisition
integration risks faced by the company following
a series of large purchases over the past several
years. This is offset by our view of ORCL's strong
balance sheet, considerable free cash flow, and
what we see as a deep management bench."

With ORCL's 80,000+ employees, their software is embedded in a lot of
companies. Perhaps a margin of safety???

---
The thing is, if it were any other market, I suspect a couple or a few or maybe
some of us would jump all over ORCL at current price. Many might even agree: a
tech/growth stock at a value price. In this current stock market though, it's
ho-hum. Many stocks are beckoning. And they become cheaper each day. So it's
just so easy to say yet one more decently-valued stock, with no compelling
reason for committing funds to right now. Nevertheless, I believe I see the
value, so I am buying a little.

ORCL - not a bad idea to purchase tech stocks. ORCL is indeed a stable although
i do prefer MSFT at this point. I am looking at TSM (Taiwan Semi) but it won't
come down enough to warrant a purchase (or is this probably telling me
something?).

Today i bought BHI (drilling tools) and BWP (pipeline MLP discussed here
before) some WMB (yet again, pipeline and NG). Purchases are probably to energy
related at this point, I am trying for some industrial names tomorrow.

Aerospace stocks are holding up better than most, thanks to free falling oil
prices? Might be where the next bull market is hiding or at least a decent
bounce.

1. Covers two unconventional shale areas:

“Natural gas production volumes from the Barnett Shale and conventional plays
in Northeast Texas and Northwest Louisiana continue to exceed expectations”,
said Brian Cody, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners’ Chief Commercial Officer.
“Anticipated new production from the emerging Haynesville Shale play in
Northwest Louisiana coupled with the increasing volume from Texas provide a
significant long-term demand for additional pipeline take-away capacity."

I am trying to be a patient buyer as I believe there will be plenty of time to
accumulate some of these value plays. It's hard to hold off the trigger when
2-3% (or more) gets shaven off each day on many of the companies on my watch
list.

Did you see this news today on Seadrill. I believe you have shares in SeaDrill
Ltd..

Tuesday September 16, 9:52 am ET
Ship Finance International acquires 2 deepwater drilling rigs from Seadrill for
$1.7 billion
http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080916/ship_finance_international_contract.html?.v=1

I am very positive long term on the deep drilling rigs and the limited number
of new rigs that will be available in the next 24-36 months. Many of these
companies (and the support service companies) are 30% to 40% cheaper w/ the
recent sell off.

I am working the portfolio to bring my average costs down on several of my new
core positions and "theme" plays. If I can accomplish this before any
significant sustained rally, I should be well positioned for 2009-2010.

I am also nibbling at new (hopefully deep discounted) value positions with new
money. My focus is to key on companies with good balance sheets, strong cash
flow and a history of increased dividend payments. I believe the Fed will be
forced to keep interest rates low for some time and I want to generate more
dividend income from the portfolio and as a bonus get in at a "value" price.

Aracruz Celulose S.A. (ARA) is a candidate that is now at a two year low and
yields 10% if they maintain their current payout (it will probably be reduced a
bit next year).

MDU Resources Group Inc. (MDU) is one I continue to watch and if it comes back
to the $24-$25 range I might begin to nibble at a few shares. The dividend is
small but they do have a history of steady increases.

Penn West Energy Trust (PWE) has excellent NG reserves and is selling off as
the price of oil falls. I do not think the 15% dividend payout will hold and it
will probably be reduced next year to help pay down their long term debt. I
exited my earlier position in late July with a good gain and may re-enter a
starter position at these lower prices. PWE is rading near a 5 year low!

I am sure there will be more opportunities as this sell off continues. I think
a lot of this is forced selling (of earlier winners) to help free up liquidity
needed to de-leverage "sour" positions held by hedge funds and investment
banks.

The Fund’s three largest long holdings were Weatherford International Ltd. (oil

BWP added to my position of BWP as well.It's a pretty defensive MLP play
because of fee only income (no direct commodity price exposure and contract are
LT fee only with several years of duration). BWP has a good credit rating
(thanks to backing by Loews) and can raise debt at around 6% which is a big
advantage in todays environment.

I also added to CPNO (a Gatherer/processor) without IDR's, sold WES at a tax
loss to partly fund those buys. Parted myself from, WMB (yet again) and BHI for
thumb change.

On another note I shorted some WFC. I think it's overvalued right now and not
as invincible than the market thinks it is.

Solid thoughts,imo.

I too believe our government had no choice. The needs of the many outweight the
needs of the few or the one. Where LEH was not as highly involved with CDO's as
AIG the larger concern would be the obvious. I am also sure their was politics
involved;LEH being off the street is a win/win for GS.
The Fed also provided 75bil and more to JP Morgan to eradicate them from LEH
exposure which in many ways was helping LEH by reducing that debt
obligation,imo. Intervention is everywhere. Outside the obvious interventions
one can just look under a few rocks and find much more.

I don't understand why the one analyst (per Yahoo) has earnings dropping next

development and growing public demand. A negative might be that the utility
provides energy through its hydroelectric plants, and (I've read) there may be

CPFL has some minor power plants in the basin Piracicaba, Capivari e
Jundia&#237; rivers. In July CPFL reduced generation to let water down the dam
to supply the public.

Too much waste due to too much water. Now it is time to manage better because
the mayors discovered business will not settle if there is no water.

Not because of low rain fall, but because this center is S&#226;o Paulo
powerhouse. Lots and lots of sugar cane destilleries to make ethanol. (I go
there once in a while to visit relatives)

They stopped Americana for 15 days by lack of water, wahter there, CPFL says,
can spin one turbine. Plant of Salto Grande also lack water.

Why the lack of water: “One person needs 2,500m3 of water to live we are
supplying 800m3”, says president of Cons&#243;rcio das Bacias dos Rios
Piracicaba, Capivari e Jundia&#237; (PCJ), Jos&#233; Roberto Fumach (PMDB),
mayor of Itatiba.

The potential of hidric resources of rivers Piracicaba, Capivari and
Jundia&#237; cannot be used all by the 62 municipalities because a share of the
water is reverted back to Cantareira system, to high Tiete e river basin. That
is needed to supply S&#227;o Paulo metwropolitan area and is used to supply 50%
of the population there

That measn water not coming down, and reverted back, leave munipalities
downstream dry.

Several of those 62 cities are going to fetch water -by truck- to other basins.

Therefore water is being a concern for the future growth of thre region,
coimpanies, like soft drinks and beer no longer cans ettle there due to alck of
water, the local administartions say.

They are working in sustainability. One is control of losses due to bad
distribution systems. Losses are estimated to be enough to supply 2,35 million
people, euivalent to a city the size of CCampinas. 6,7 thousand liters per
second are lost between treatment plant and consumer houses.

Just as an example: Jaguari&#250;na os investing in upgrading its system. In
2000, 70% of the treated water never reached the tap. Today this has dropped to
25%. “The investment on upgrading has been already paid back, says the mayor
Tarc&#237;sio Chiavegatto (PTB).

We swapped 60Km of the network and we will swap some 40Km more 2001. In2001 the
city captured 250 litros/second, today, after a 25% grow in population we are
capturing 150liters/second, says the mayor.

Copel clarifies the interested parties in establishing partnership in new small
hydroplants

(This is a machine translation!!!!!.)

[08-09-2008]
Copel in the next Wednesday (10), in Curitiba, open meeting to all the
interested parties in establishing partnerships with the state one, aiming at
the construction of small hydroplants (PCHs in Portuguese) in the Paran&#225;.
The meeting is a chance so that the doubts around the proclamation of Public
Call are clarified all, launched recently for the Copel.

In the proclamation, the company places to the market its disposal to associate
mainly with other investors, to construct and to operate a set of PCHs until
the limit of 300 mW (megawatts) of installed power - the sufficient to take
care of to the consumption of a city with 800 a thousand inhabitants.

For definition, PCHs is exploitations with at least 1 mW and in 30 maximum
megawatts of power. For the estimates of the Close-woven part of a fishing net,
the investments foreseen for the implementation of the 300 established mW of
joint power as limit in the Public Call are of R$ 1,2 billion.

The meeting of clarifications will have place in the audience of the
Administrative Polar region of the Copel, in the Mossungu&#234; quarter -
Highway BR-277, km 3 - with beginning to 14h. The complete one of the
proclamation of public call for the election of projects of small
hidrel&#233;tricas central offices is available in the address of the Copel in
the Internet (www.copel.com).

STATED PERIODS - the companies interested in constituting partnerships with the
Copel will have to present a basic project of the PCH to be installed in the
Paran&#225; and that already she has authorization grant (conditional or not),
in phase of authorization grant or analysis for the National Agency of Electric
Energy (Aneel). Currently, they exist about 80 projects of PCHs in the
Paran&#225; - that they add 900 mW of power approximately - with possibility
taking care of to these requirements.

The stated period for the delivery of the documentation for the interested
parties finishes in day 10 of October and the Copel will go to divulge the
projects approved until day 18 of December.

MAJORIT&#193;RIA - Each enterprise selected for the Copel will be implanted by
means of on purpose specific society (SPE), that it will have the state one as
shareholding majorit&#225;ria, in attendance to the state legislation, and
whose constitution will have to be approved by the State legislature of the
Paran&#225;. Beyond arriving in port capitals in the ratio of its participation
in each project, the Copel has to offer to the future partners a wide tradition
of knowledge technician in the engineering of hidroelectric exploitations e,
over all, solids commitments with the sustentabilidade, that assure the total
seriousness in the treatment of decurrent the social matters and ambient of the
implantation of the enterprise.

The construction of hidroelectric exploitations of small transport in Brazil is
stimulated by a series of benefits that become this type of sufficiently
attractive enterprise of the economic point of view. The PCHs has right, for
example, the discountings of at least 50% in the tariffs of use of the systems
of transmission and distribution of energy (TUST and TUSD). They also are
exempt of the payment of the Financial Compensation for the Use of
H&#237;dricos Resources and of the Use of Public good.

For the first time, I'm now starting to worry about GE and its financial
exposure. Company is AAA rated. At this point that seems to me less relevant
than the significance of the size of GE's debt - $561B. In this market it can't
all be "good" debt. With a 4.7 d/e ratio and $19B in cash, these GE numbers all
become a focus point in this market.

When I look at AIG's gross numbers -- debt at $188B, cash at $58B, I have to
wonder how dangerous an investment in GE could be. Doesn't help that GE at
$23/sh is already at about a nine year low.

Trying to figure upside/downside. Possible that GE could continue down. Maybe
$15 in this kind of market. Upside hasn't worked for so many years -- maybe if
DOW recovers, GE up about 20% from 23 to maybe 28.

I'll call it my mistake to have made GE a full position for a ltb&h. I'm going
to take my lumps and close position. If I reenter, it'll be for a trade.

This letter was issued by GE to shareholders last Sunday. Does this change your
view?

September 14, 2008
To the investment community:
In response to questions we received on Friday and because of the extraordinary
market conditions, we wanted to provide our investors with additional
information on GE’s financial services businesses:
1.Commercial Real Estate
A few statistics and facts concerning our $87 billion real estate portfolio:
• The business originates to hold; it is not an originate-to-sell model.
• 60 percent of real estate assets are outside the U.S. across 23 countries.
• Average investment in both loan and REO portfolios is less than $10 million.
• Our loan-to-value average is 68 percent.
• We do not originate any land or construction loans. In 1Q, we purchased
Merrill Lynch’s $900 million
construction portfolio at a steep discount.
• We have only $125 million of CMBS that are subject to quarterly
mark-to-market requirements.
• We are executing on our plan and have generated $6 billion of proceeds from
asset sales this year.
• In-house underwriting has created a strong portfolio with very low
delinquencies (0.2% of assets).
• As stated in our 2Q earnings call, we expect our Commercial Real Estate
business to earn $1.5 to $1.7 billion in 2008.
2. GE Money global mortgages and loss provisions
A few statistics and facts regarding our $79 billion global residential
mortgage portfolio and GE Money loss provisions:
• The business originates to hold; it is not an originate-to-sell model.
• ~100 percent of residential mortgage assets are outside the U.S.
• No mortgages originated at more than 80% loan-to-value (LTV) without credit
insurance.
• The UK mortgage portfolio, our biggest at $28 billion, has an average LTV of
71 percent.
• We are adequately reserved for delinquencies at GE Money, which for 2Q were
5.92 percent, equaling the December 2002 high.
• In the event that delinquencies and non-earnings rise, we will increase
allowances for losses.
3. Funding
An update on our funding position, which remains strong:
• We have raised $70 billion of $80 billion full-year plan; our 3Q funding plan
is complete.

trevor.a.schauenberg@ge.com
• We diligently match fund our assets and liabilities across our portfolio to
reduce interest rate and
currency risk.
• GE Capital’s commercial paper programs, which total $90 – $95 billion, remain
robust with 15 programs in 11 currencies at an average funding cost of Libor
less 25 basis points year-to-date in our largest market, the US.
• GE Capital cash bond spreads are trading significantly tighter than most
major financial institutions. Our cash bond spreads are significantly tighter
than our credit default swap spreads.
• As stated in previous investor meetings, we are not raising external capital
and have no need to.
• We continue to have an unwavering commitment to maintaining our Triple A.
In summary, our financial services businesses earned $5.2 billion in the first
half of 2008, making us one of the most profitable financial services providers
in the world. We have over 10,000 originators around the world and our margins
on new business originated this year remain very strong.

I held my nose and added a few more shares of GERDAU SA ADS (NYSE: GGB). I am
not at a full position yet, but I may be able to buy more shares in the single
digits if the market keeps falling.

$VIX is getting pretty high at around 35, so I expect some type of short term
bounce which may stabilize the current sell off.

What's going on with MIC down another 12%. I am watching but holding off on
buying until I sell some type of price reversal. Perhaps the market is worried

Perhaps Yahoo guy drew his conclusion based on a localized problem.

OSN, regulates the market to guarantee quality of the service, in such a manner
that if suppliers run ou of capacity, they have to buy from gas fired thermo
power plants.

This was to avoid a new entrant, in the electric energy sector, without much
experience gets a concession by biding high and throw the system on the floor.

Or say CPFL spin their plants flat out, makes a lot of money, runs out of water
and the system collapses.

To guarantee there is no collpase the regulators tells everyone, in a case by
case and region by region basis that if its reservoir falls below 61% the
regulator let thermos start generating to avoid reservoirs go down and
compromise supply.

Therefore a suppliers has to go guarantee supply by managing its reservoirs.
Thus CPFL going after ethanol suppliers to diversity its sources.

Brazil increases use of sugarcane bagasse for power generation
Written by Giles Clark, London
Tuesday, 16 September 2008
Brazil is increasingly turning to alternative power generation fuels such as
biomass in order to increase electricity supply and reduce its dependence on
hydropower. Biomass power represents around 4.1 percent of the total installed
capacity in Brazil at present and most biomass cogeneration is based on
sugarcane bagasse. At present, sugarcane bagasse cogeneration accounts for 3.03
percent of the total Brazilian energy matrix.

New analysis from Frost & Sullivan, Sugarcane Bagasse for Power Generation in
Brazilian Markets, suggests that the market will reach 3.0 GW in 2007 and will
grow to 12.2 GW in 2014.

The Brazilian sugar and alcohol sector envisages to market electricity surplus
to the national grid. In order to produce marketable amounts of electricity,
the sector is expected to invest in new technologies, including cogeneration
equipment. There is a clear trend toward the implementation of boilers with
higher steam-production capacity. New boilers and steam turbines with higher
capacity and efficiency would substantially increase the electricity surplus
the plants would be able to sell.

"The National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) has created
several credit lines to finance power plants that require new equipment and
upgrade in order to produce excess energy that can be sold to the national
grid," notes Julio Campos, Industry Analyst at Frost & Sullivan. "At present,
there are 47 projects under BNDES and these have the potential to contribute
1.4 GW of cogenerated electricity to the national grid in 2008 and 2009."

However, unattractive prices are discouraging companies looking to sell their
excess electricity to the national grid. Brazilian sugar and alcohol plants
produce around 95 percent of their electricity needs, purchasing the remaining
5 percent from national-grade transmission and distribution (GT&D) companies.
Plants claim that the prices they pay to those companies for this additional
power are several times higher than the prices paid by GT&Ds for the plants'
electricity surplus.

"Another significant restraint for the cogeneration market is the lack of
connection to the electric grid," says Campos. "In addressing this, many
sugarcane cogeneration-related associations such as Associa&#231;&#227;o
Paulista de Cogera&#231;&#227;o de Energia (COGEN-SP-Paulista Association of
Cogeneration) and ANEEL are working on building generation distributive center
units that will collectively transmit electricity cogenerated in the mills and
input it into the grid."

Structured tax and financial policies would serve as a driver for the expansion
of sugarcane bagasse cogeneration technologies. Government and related
regulatory agencies should develop clear planning and regulatory structures in
order to boost cogeneration capacities in sugar mills. This includes the easy
and efficient connection to the grid, and the

My biggest bet is in MLP's as well. Many seem to have fallen in a liquidity
trap where folks are running for the exits:

BWP-mentioned befor here in much detail. A fairly low risk proposition. In fact
if I could name the lowest risk business of all the companies I am invested in
that would be it.

ETE - the General Partner of ETP. 9% yield and a strong possibility of 20%
growth for a couple of years. ETP is an MLP with a very good track record, they
were first movers with the Barnet shale and have pipes all over Texas, the
MIdcontinantal express. Some commodity exposure.

CPNO- decent balance sheet and great track record. Build in growth and no need
for financing for a year or more, IMO.No IDR's (which means they have no
separate GP). Commodity exposure.

I also own some MGG (GP of MMP) and bought some TLP (terminals but exposure to
Morgan Stanley possibly).

I think I am just going to close my eyes and collect the cash. My yield is
going to be about 10% blended and should be growing strongly.

I bought some AFC (preferred but really is ALD debt) for around 10$ today. Also
purchased some MSFT (safe heaven stock).

Closed my short in WFC today, probably the only position in the green.

Ailing bank Washington Mutual Inc. appeared headed toward a sale Wednesday
after a major investor removed a potential stumbling block and nervous banking
regulators began approaching the most logical buyers.

The New York Times, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, said
an auction of the bank was already under way, and The Wall Street Journal
reported Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. expressed interest in a takeover.

WaMu, Wells Fargo and Citigroup all declined to comment.

A concession by investment firm TPG, which injected $7 billion into WaMu five
months ago, may have opened the way to a sale — or, failing that, made it
easier for the bank to raise another round of capital.

TPG could have stymied the process because of protection when it bought its
stake in April. A clause in its agreement could have required a buyer or
another major investor to pay TPG hundreds of millions, if not billions, of
dollars in addition to whatever money was injected into WaMu.

But TPG agreed to waive the clause after concluding WaMu needs all the help it
can get.

"It became clear that it would be in the best interests of Washington Mutual
and our investors to waive the ... provisions," Fort Worth, Texas-based TPG
said in a statement. "Our goal is to maximize the bank's flexibility in this
difficult market environment."

The efforts to find a buyer, though, were being complicated by uncertainty
about the magnitude of losses still lurking in Washington Mutual's home loan
portfolio.

"No one knows what's in their books," said a person briefed on the talks
between regulators and banks, speaking Wednesday on the condition of anonymity
because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Citing unidentified sources, the New York Post said the potential buyers
include JPMorgan Chase & Co. and HSBC Holdings PLC., as well as Wells Fargo.
The banks all declined to comment.

Federal regulators would like to sell WaMu to a healthy bank, rather than risk
a failure that would drain an already depleted deposit insurance fund. By some
estimates, a WaMu failure could cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s fund
more than $20 billion. At $45.2 billion, the fund is already at a five-year
low.

After losing $6.3 billion in the past three quarters, Washington Mutual
believes it is slowly healing under a new chief executive, Alan Fishman, who
will receive an $8 million bonus if he can keep WaMu alive through 2009.

"I think people do know what is in our books and we've been pretty
transparent," WaMu spokeswoman Olivia Riley said Wednesday, pointing to a
financial update the company released late last week. Those figures suggested
WaMu's loan problems are becoming less severe compared to recent quarters,
giving some analysts hope that the company can still be salvaged.

Nonetheless, analysts still expect the company to sustain a loss of about $1.8
billion in the quarter ending Sept. 30. And investors are showing little
confidence in WaMu.

The company's stock fell 31 cents to $2.01 Wednesday, leaving the stock price
with a decline of 85 percent so far this year. The erosion has left WaMu with a
market value of about $3.5 billion — down from $43 billion at the end of 2006.

"Something needs to happen soon because WaMu is twisting in the wind," said
Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., banking consultant. "It's a detrimental situation
that has become corrosive to the franchise."

Assuming that Washington Mutual either can't find a buyer or doesn't want to be
sold at the price being offered, the thrift could raise more money to fatten
its cushion against the losses that are still expected to come. Like TPG did,
any investor would be betting that the slumping real estate market will bounce
back, allowing Washington Mutual to regain its financial equilibrium and return
to the form that enabled it to pocket profits totaling $13.7 billion from 2003
through 2006.

In a Monday research note, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Frederick Cannon
estimated Washington Mutual probably needs to raise at least $5 billion to
protect itself from upcoming losses. Cannon thinks Washington Mutual could
still be facing as much as $28 billion more in loan losses and other
credit-related expenses through 2009.

Alternately, Ely thinks WaMu could sell big chunks of its franchise, which
includes $143 billion in deposits and more than 2,200 branches in 15 states.
Most of WaMu's branches are in the West, overlapping territory where Wells
Fargo and Bank of America are the market leaders.

WaMu's branches in New York and Illinois also could be appealing to buyers if
the company is sold in pieces, Ely said. "When you are dealing with a company
this big, there are lots of ways you can slice and dice it," he said.

Nice rant. I'm just not sure if it is because the SEC is incompetent or
complicit in the process?

 First Wall Street insiders used an unprecedented degree of leverage, and
financial engineering to suck billions and billions out of the U.S. economy...
sucking it dry to the point that it is now collapsing from the weight of a pile
of it's own worthless derivative paper.

They have $25 million dollar apartments on 5th Ave, vacation homes with
helipads in the Hampton's, and Yachts the size of ocean liners in Boca... and
you and I, - we have the bill.

Now is it possible that the puppeteers may use deflation as an offensive weapon
to complete the wealth transfer process - just like they used it in the Great
Depression.

They let the financial markets melt down. They run Ma & Pa Kettle completely
out of stocks. They collapse global & emerging markets. And then they step in
and snap up China & India on the cheap, consolidate and control the financial
system, and load up on commodities before massively reflating.

DOW 8500, $550 Gold, and $60 Oil.

...that's the risk.

And that just may be their gameplan, and where we're heading.

This AIG (and MS\GS) meltdown could be a gameplan changer however. As the
puppeteers risk letting this get out of control.

SEC issues new rules against abusive naked short-selling

By Robert Schroeder
Last update: 9:58 a.m. EDT Sept. 17, 2008
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- U.S. securities regulators issued new rules
Wednesday designed to protect investors against so-called "naked"
short-selling, including requiring short sellers to deliver securities by the
close of business on the settlement date and making clear that those lying
about their ability or intention to deliver on time are breaking the law.
"These several actions today make it crystal clear that the SEC has zero
tolerance for abusive naked short selling," said Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Christopher Cox. Cox was criticized by Senate Banking
Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd on Tuesday for not doing more to prevent
abusive naked short selling. 

Maybe he meant to say that "These several actions today make it crystal clear
that the SEC has zero tolerance for abusive naked short selling, when it no
longer serves our agenda"?

Madharry, yes, very scary. I'll add to my very losing GNW position now though a

issuing long-term care policies realize protection of their capital has to be a
prudent policy. For GNW, that'd mean carefully diversifying risk among their
$72B of total investments. And not using leverage like investment firms have
been doing. But who knows what any of these firms do - managers
stonewall/lie/have no understanding --everything they report seems so
suspicious and so opaque.

I understand that the media says GNW is exposed/overexposed to the housing

to assume with the balance sheet that I see (Yahoo), that okay, they will or
might take a hit to earnings, but that they ought to survive. Otoh, perhaps all

CIT would be okay to buy at its now low price if we weren't in the unusual
situation where investors may rightly assume the business models for almost all
financial companies are at great risk. Who can buy CIT with confidence now,
unless they know the inner workings or the company - it's financial
responsibilities, risks, commitments, customer base, etc. I've bought the
company when it was beat down before - but that was when their business itself
took a hit -- not like now when the financial world seems to be collapsing. For
me, I'd avoid the stock, seek opportunities elsewhere.

Starting for a decent position in asset manager, BEN.

Barron's 9/10 article not too positive:

"Relative returns are likely to remain weak across Templeton's largest equity
funds given adverse forex trends and ongoing global equity-market volatility.
As flows tend to follow performance, we expect aggregate net flows to remain
decidedly negative in the near term...Our reduced earnings outlook reflects
lower August AUM; more conservative net flow assumptions; less favorable
revenue yields; and tighter margins. As a result of our weaker earnings
projections, we are taking down our price target from $120 to $103." Sandler

when stock markets decline, and come back when the markets improve. I'm

Imo, yes, because it would be $in and $out.

For USA citizens buying stocks of USA businesses, selling those stocks, using
the proceeds to buy USA goods/services/other stocks, then even though the
"fundamental value" of the USA currency might be poor, the "essence of value
investing based on fundamentals" -- buy low (i.e. undervalued)/sell high (fully
valued) --is intact.

For somebody with a strong currency coming into the weaker currency country,
those fundamental values are even stronger. Example: British people finding USA

vacation home prices, and cheap fundamentally in $ compared to
construction/replacement cost (also in $)

Is the USD under valued at current levels?

Or are further corrections needed to make it a bargain?

In the past month, over one trillion dollars in fiat money has injected as air
to keep the bubble inflated. The most conservative estimate I can come up with
is it will take at least another two trillion fiat dollars in the next year if
the strategy stays in place, and the bubble will inevitably burst regardless.

As one observation I saw, rather eloquently put it, "We've privatized profits
and socialized losses.". American citizens are on the hook for trillions in
investment losses and we will pay for those losses in the form of a dollar that
is worth far less than it is today.

I'd be interested in seeing other views, but I don't think the USD is a good
value at current levels.

As a side note, I see AIG has been replaced in the DOW with Kraft foods. A
rather grim omen if it's based on the idea things are going to get bad enough
that stocking up on food makes sense.

the business models for financial companies are at great risk because they
always revert to doing the same stupid things in cycles and because government
reverts to doing the same stupid thing too. Passing the buck to the greater
guru. When I was a loan review officer at a major money center bank we never
spent any time with AAA credits because we assumed that if there were any
doubts at all the company would not have been granted an AAA rating. Looks like
we were all wrong about that. Similarly we did not grade derivative exposure-
there was a special department set up to do that- hopefuly people with quant
skills.
I imagine that these hot shot insurance companies made a few bucks insuring all
these triple A credits from defaults only to find out when it was too late that
the rating agencies made a mistake- " sorry my bad bro" now explains why a
former dow component now teeters on the brink and required massive federal
funding at borderline loan shark rates. It also explains the magical
disappearance of 3 investment banks and fed on the hook for trillions of xtra
dollars. In this administration when the going gets tough unfortunately the
tough go to war.

CIT is a victim of the credit crunch. It loans are tied to LIBOR and when libor
goes way up, it hurts. Also when the credit market freezes, CIT can not get the
funding it needs. So the CIT model as well as investment banking model is
suspect. That said, CIT has funding until 2010 for all it commitments. It is
out of the mortgage and student loan business basically and has an experienced
group to make money in corporate midlevel financing, factoring, transportation
leases, and vendor financing. But its earning power has gone way done to about
50 cents a share based on its earning assets and loan loss provisions. Also it
efficiency ratios are too high and geared for a larger company. I would expect
CIT to eventually return to a level of its tangible value per share which is
about 14 dollars if the credit crunch subsidies. But it is subject to all the
problems , scares and rumors in the finance industry. Look at GE as another
example. It is very volatile as todays price action indicates.

Rich - I agree regarding CIT. It's business model is dead as it's clear they
have no secure funding and their cost of capital is too high to earn a decent
spread. They may be of value for a large bank with cheap deposits as a secure
funding source and I could see a scenario where a bank takes them over in which
case they could become or folded into the commercial lending division. This
would make the most sense, otherwise they are dead.

It's quite interesting that BofA can take over Merrill Lynch. BofA's tangible
equity is pretty thin due to Goodwill from the LaSalle takeover than paid in
cash. Countrywide is not exactly booming either. I think they may be due to a
capital raise as well> I wonder what they tangible equity ratio is going to be
after MER takeover. Sure they have secure funding to some extend because of
deposit insurance where the FDIC (essentially the US government) is the
backstop. The idea to run a regulated business and an investment bank under one
roof isn't new either see Citigroup. Hopefully BofA can do better.

ETE (19.8$), ETP(29.42$), WFC(-37.8$), NWS (12.85$)

Sold ETE today for a huge (33%) tax loss and bought ETP from the proceeds. Felt
it was an opportune time to do so when ETP went on a hellride below 30$ and ETE
stayed somewhat behind. You gotto do what you need to do.

Shorted WFC again at 37.8$. Interesting that they trade almost higher than
before the credit crunch. Last trade worked out OK and now I am trying again. I
used my account at WellsTrade with WFC to short so I assume that I am not a
naked short :-).

Purchased some more NWS, my favorite Media stock. I think it's well position -
they overpaid for Dow Jones but they seem to be making something out of this
asset. I like the WSJ more than ever and the recent website revamp looks good
to me. A healthy balance sheet does not hurt either in the current environment.

although you got you short in under the wire, I question maintaining a short ,
now that the sec has banned short selling of financials, on top of that they
are now under real pressure to do something about naked short selling as well.
The SEC chairman is really looking like he's going to be taken to the woodshed
over this even though he was one of many who looked the other way. i complained
about this problem to all of my congressmen months ago and i just got back the
standard response.
The huge rally in financials ahead of this announcement by the SEC is another
indicator of how much inside information is out there.

OTOH
The folly of the mortgage lending practices continue to astonish me- California
is a no recourse state yet people were easily able to get 100% financing loans.
How stupid is it to provide 100% financing when if the price goes down the
borrower can just walk away and turn in the keys. Worse, they can just stop
paying on the mortgage and wait to be foreclosed upon thereby saving a year of
rent probably. Meanwhile banks apparently are trying to get customers to absorb
part of the loss of short sales. This bailout is going to cost trillions of
dollars. Maybe you were wise to short wells fargo after all.

WFC - Hmm, yes, shorting a company that Buffett is buying. You are sure you are
smarter than he is?

I said a while ago that "short bubble" is the same as long bubble: the first
ones are smart and make a lot of money. Then come the momos. The last ones are
the ones who jump on bandwagon when every smart short has left the building.
And they are left holding their shorts.

Nothing personal Spek, but I hope this makes you think a bit more.

Disclosure: I have a tiny position in WFC and although I don't think it is very
cheap, I would not dream to short it.

Ah GNW. What a swing in prices in past two days. Down sharply yesterday to
about $3.50 with a recovery to today's high over $16. If timed right, or maybe
somewhat more realistically, if someone followed the stock/company and believed
management yesterday that they were well-capitalized/had no serious financing
issues, etc., and the person stepped in for serious money yesterday, it was a
buy to make a fortune on. And this on a presumably staid insurance company.

Of course though, who believes managements anymore -g-. And in our current and
volatile market environment who dares step in with big buys and will hold
longer than a couple of uptick points?

Anyway, nice timing buy on your part, Madharry. I suspect I'll be underwater
for a very long time on my GNW shares, but am grateful for the few more I
bought yesterday after your post.

Another indicator of "shorting bubble" is that Value Investing Congress now
boasts as the venue where David Einhorn discussed Lehman's problems last year.
Apparently, this is THE success from the last year...

As I said before, I have nothing against shorts, good luck to them. I would
just caution people from going short now. Although the collapse of BSC, FNM,
FRE, AIG, LEH made it very appealing... ;)

Anyone following what looks like will become a Buffett stock, CEG?
Wild price swings, mostly well below the all cash offer of $26.50. Still
regulatory hurdles to surmount, although the talk is that with a Buffett entity
backing this, it is likely to pass muster both locally (MD) and nationally.
Estimates are for a nine month time frame to close.
Looks like WEB bought CEG at a very favorable price, and that's probably an
understatement.

i sold mine today better than doubled my small throw of the dice. Ill probably
never understand what happened to cause that huge decline in the stock. My
guess is that insider fortunes were really made yesterday when people with
advance knowledge of the bailout bank and the ban on short selling of financial
just piled into the market. today was option expiry day and im sure there were
many mulitmilionaires created by this once in a lifetime opportunity. needless
to say i was not one of them. all one of had to do was to stock up yesterday on
calls of bac and ubs and citi and your fortune would have been made. ooh to be

I was very nervous recently and I don't think that this is over. I got nervous
and made few bad sales over the past week, but made some wonderful buys too. I
sold some ACAS yesterday and today, and left money on the table. But I owned
just too many shares so I do not feel bad about it. I still own more than a
full position.

I was so convinced I was right about things in general (i.e. all my PE's were
hat sizes) that I went a bit too much on margin. That is all over now and I am
ready to buy again on a pull back next week.

My accounts were down 15% YTD two days ago, and now only -1.2%. It is great to
be (essentially) at break even.

Like the gambler's prayer, usually mumbled as he heads into the casino, "lord,
please let me break even today.... because I need the money."
