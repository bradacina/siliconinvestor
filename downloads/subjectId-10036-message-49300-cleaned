NS/NSH. Clownbuck, regarding your post on these stocks:

>>My guess is that they will issue new NS shares to the amount of 200M$ soon
and NSH will get a free ride on the cash flow generated...<<

Today Nustar announced issuance of more shares: "NuStar Energy prices offering
of 6.2 mln common units at a public offering price of $48.94 per unit (
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ns&d=t )"

Seems to me I've continued to be wrong about NS, and I should've bought
NSH(general partner) -- which you've liked better.

NSH up today, NS falls to new low. I'm in for a few more NS shares, although
I'm reconsidering if I might ultimately be better off switching to NSH and its
lesser distribution (yield).

NSH still is the better bet, even at current prices. NS will issue more units
and NSH will get a free ride on the incentive distribution on those units as
well.

The big problem for NS and NSH is that the asphalt business has gone to hell
and I am also somewhat leary of their big storage business that could be
dependent on the forward price curves for crude futures and crude products.
Storage will always be needed but I have been hearing that cushing storage may
be overbuild, with all these new sources (Bakken, Eagle Ford) coming online.
NUstar may have too much storage in the wrong places in the long run.

Afor now, i am staying out of NS and NSH but NSH is clearly the better of the
two, imo.

Bought back the shares in Moresco 5018.T at 726 yen. I am not sure why the
shares went down again to the low prices a year ago, since the business seems
to be doing ok, earnings should run around 90Yen/share this year.

Moresco is a Japanese lubricant and specialty chemical company. I think their
products like vacuum oils have captive customers that are not likely to switch
vendors, at least that is my observation (i work with vacuum machinery too).
Moresco is one of the more shareholder friendly companies in Japan, as they
seem to raise their dividend (25yen last year) and communicate with
shareholders via presentations (in Japanese unfortunately) rather than jut the
sparse regulatory releases.

PS: I added to my BBEP position this morning in the premarket @ 18.40, on the
public offering news.

BreitBurn Energy Partners L.P. (the “Partnership”) (
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=bbep ) announced today the pricing of its public
offering of 10,000,000 common units representing limited partner interests at a
price to the public of $18.51 per unit. The Partnership has granted to the
underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 common
units from the Partnership. The offering is expected to close on September 11,
2012, subject to customary closing conditions.

The Partnership expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $177.6 million
(or approximately $204.2 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase an additional 1,500,000 common units) from the offering and intends to
use the proceeds to reduce borrowings under its bank credit facility.

I use price change in doing a rough check in evaluating my mlp's. My broker
gives total cost per share I paid, current price per share, and % change for
each stock. I don't reinvest distributions for mlp's. If I see % change is
negative 8% or more from my purchase price, I figure I'm a loser in the stock
if I bought it fairly recently. If I see an mlp that's down about 16% or more
from my purchase price, and it looks like I've held the stock a couple of
years, I figure I've lost on that one also.

I've liked NI when it was mentioned here at lower prices. Don't have it now.

Re: J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE: JCP) - up 45% from earlier year low
Trinity Industries Inc. (NYSE: TRN) - up 38% from earlier year low
(GN=$29.00/share)

Both companies mentioned in June w/ undervalued Graham Number Values and Both
up significantly 45% ( http://goo.gl/reMVd ) and 38% ( http://goo.gl/reMVd ).
http://goo.gl/reMVd not really a true Graham No. candidate since they reported
losses w/i the last 10 years.

Still quite surprised of the recent moves and I continue to hold my small
position in both companies. Unfortunately, my buys are always small, so I
really do not have stop loss constraints (ie automatically sell w/ a 15% loss).
You can never buy at the absolute bottom, so if you bought near the low and
established a fixed stop loss limit, it's easy to have gotten stopped out of
the position before the big "value" move eventually kicked in.

It's the GN value that kept me in these positions.

http://goo.gl/reMVd is another GN value stock that I should be buying more of.
I have made two different buys below $13.00/share but should probably add
another chunk at current levels. GLW GN value is now around $23.00/share.

Therefore, I rarely use stop loss limits (other than mental stop loss levels).
Rather, if the value proposition remains there, I continue to hold and/or add
to the position. It's a disciplined approach that becomes a bit difficult in a
falling market but well rewarding when/if the true value gets priced back into
the stock.

GOOG. For several years I've said here in several posts that one of my value
models has told me me GOOG is fairly-valued at $700 or more. (My value number
has varied depending on analyst earnings estimates, other factors). Now I
calculate fair value may be somewhere between $684 (low estimate) and $930/sh
(best estimate), if profit margins hold up.

I've not sold any of my few GOOG shares. My intent is to hold stocks until they
are fully or fairly valued. With GOOG though, I'm tired of the ups and downs of
the stock and the media attention that focuses on the company. (Makes it harder
for me to just let the company do its thing and to let the stock just sit.) So,
just as can sometimes be done in war, I'll declare victory, and withdraw (a
little). I sold my first shares today @$699.55.

Hi EKS. I appreciate your opinion even if sometimes we don't agree.

JCP has had a nice run, but it is at about the same place it was in June. If
you look at the chart, there's a big overhead gap that it will have to overcome
to go higher.

Nice going on TRN. Excellent call.

On GLW, did you see the SA article discussing the stock's price performance
relative to ROA and ROE?

You didn't mention ADM. Also nice run. Not sure how much of this is correlated
to the general market. We'll see.

For simplicity and for a rough evaluation, I assume there's an 8% annual
distribution yield off my mlp purchase prices. (I ignore tax consequences here
from the distributions.)

So, if I've held an mlp two years, I assume I will have got two 8%
distributions from it. And thus, as I say--- if the stock has fallen 16% or
more during that time, I figure the price drop is greater than the
distributions, and I'm basically a loser or break-evener overall on the
position.

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: UVIC, GLW, MSFT, MGDDY, MHR-D,
DRAGF. No changes

New positions: CJES, JPM, AAUKY
Positions increased: CYOU, ADVC, BAC
Positions reduced: GRVY
Positions eliminated: GTE, DO, SLT
Flip-flop: FBOD, POEFF

This month is mostly a story of not very successful buys and missed sell
opportunities.

FBOD - A lesson in time value of money (and regulatory risk). Dinky bank that
is trading at half cash (all its business is being sold), liquidating at the
end of the year and returning all money to shareholders. So how can you lose?
It appears you can. In two ways actually: regulators want $15-20 mln for
assorted past misdeeds; and although bank liquidates in 12/2012, the money will
be distributed to shareholders in 2014-2015. Double whammy to kill good
returns. So much for sure liquidation deals.

POEFF - Let's say I chickened out. The company received good price for their
producing concessions, but the remainder of the company is tough to value for
me.

GRVY - coulda, shoulda, woulda sold higher. RO2 is not doing greatly and the
stock cratered. Trading close to net cash again, but now there's almost no
catalyst in the future. Dinky company with very limited pipeline. It only
serves to show the power or margin of safety that I still have a tiny gain on
my shares. But the loss of a higher gain hurts. Well, I decided to bet on
somewhat good success of RO2 and I lost.

Sold GTE - no longer sure it's worth the price; DO - not fantastically cheap;
SLT - benefits of upcoming merger are unclear - I managed to sell SLT on runup
after which it plunged down again.

Added to CYOU, ADVC on valuation. Added to BAC on "valuation" - I can't claim I
can value a bank. :)

Bought initial positions in CJES and AAUKY - both seem cheap if the cyclical
downturn is not very deep. Bought initial position in JPM as a
"Buffett-approved" bank.

AAB.TO,

I recommend to CEO that AAB pay out a special dividend before the merger, since
they are getting less than 1/2 of the company and contributing 10% more of the
assets, and that's before their largest holding SUE.TO rallied 40%. I hope that
message, along with your feedback, will lead them to consider it.

That being said, there are several reasons to vote in favor. SUE.TO holds some
private investments that could be overvalued. I don't want to take $1 million
hit to NAV from cancelling the merger, the combined company will have a lot
more trading liqudity and should hopefully trade at less of a discount, and
there is a huge merger-arb spread (i.e., AAB.CAT converted into DSM.CAV would
be up about 20% from current depressed levels). A 20% gain is nothing to sneeze
at.

For those reasons, I am considering holding my nose and voting in favor. Voting
against is the principled thing to do, but at this stage I am focused on
maximizing returns.

AAB its not the principal , its the reality that the stock would be up 20% now,
had there been no merger announced. this merger is dragging the price down. it
would be a different matter if they proposed a merger with a company that was
sitting with all cash to invest but is not. its got rare earth inventory
stashed in far east countries and they have not indicated how long it would
take to become liquid or even what their intentions are. I have no desire to
sit with a warehouse of dust gathering rare earth inventory while giving up 50%
of my depressed equity investments in exchange for the illusion of liquidity.
so i hope you and vote against the merger if it comes to that. as far as the
break up fee goes. i suspect that if anyone sued them for that they would have
a pretty good case because they never got any fairness opinion letters under
the argument that they were affiliated companies. If they had any integrity at
all they would have announced to the dacha shareholder that they intend to get
our of the rare earths business and invest the proceeds in the same way they do
with aberdeen. then they could have come to aberdeen shareholders and proposed
a merger. Doing it this way raises all sorts of suspicions in me. and their
argument for more liquidity I am going to dismiss until they can show me a high
degree of liquidity prior to the merger vote. In these matters I am a show me

Madharry,

This paragraph below implies to me that they did get a fairness opinion, so no
case for lawsuits. Am I missing something?

The special committee of Aberdeen has received an opinion from GMP that the
consideration to be received by the Aberdeen shareholders is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the Aberdeen shareholders and the special committee
of Dacha has received an opinion from Cormark that the Transaction is fair from
a financial point of view to Dacha.

I agree that AAB.TO would be up a ton had they not done this. After deal
announcement, Dacha is up 10% while Aberdeen is down 10% because Dacha is
getting a sweetheart deal IMO. And now I see Dacha's NAV is actually down from

pipelines ranking 4th for majors. I actually like their NG exposure w/ their
terminal interests in Australia ( http://goo.gl/JvQ9l ) and continued
investment in domestic NG liquids including their domestic processing
facilities (as seen in the chart below).

<img

http://Canada including interests in oil sands projects too.

Therefore, I am looking to up my current holdings in COP. I plan to peel off
shares in HES and MRO. I am still looking for a better entry point (below
$55.00/share) so no rush as this is a sideways move. My premise is that COP may
have better strategic "value" than HES and/or MRO as they sell assets that do
not fit w/ their long term company investment into NG. The "whole" is worth
more than it's parts.

Both MRO and HES have undervalued Oil & NG assets but may not have the
management and/or long term strategic plan to bring the value to the
shareholder. This is especially true w/ HES as management continues to be the
high cost developer in several of their domestic shale holdings. I see their
http://goo.gl/U8TbK ( Hess to sell Azerbaijan assets to ONGC Videsh) as an
opportunity for me to sell my high cost shares for a small gain.

very much for that...I can see your argument for getting in below 55 but I'd be
happy to even get in at current prices. I read somewhere that getting in at
52.80 would be better as this would give you a 5% yield but not sure if that is

Yes, I've heard what Chanos thinks about DELL/HPQ.

I don't think PCs are in such a secular decline as for example newspapers are.
However, PCs might be in a cyclical decline towards a point where
tablet/PC/phone ratio is reestablished at a lower ratio of PCs.

/anecdotal ruminations below - IMHO, it's very risky to base investment
decisions on what you know anecdotaly - Peter Lynch method does not work for
most people and situations...

Personally, I have a tablet and 3 PCs at home (Dell, Asus & HP). I don't use
the tablet at all and I don't plan to buy another one in the future. On the
other hand, if one of my PCs died, I'd replace it immediately.

I have a relative kid in high school - no tablets and no plans to buy a tablet.
No mobile either. He just bought and assembled his own PC and he really loves
everything about it.

A colleague of mine - true Apple-head - has iPad, iPhone, couple Macs. Does not
use iPad at all. His wife uses it to see when the bus is coming... that's it.
I'm not sure he'd buy another one. I am sure he'd buy a phone and Mac
replacement if they died.

In high-tech software companies, there is no way to replace PCs with tablets.
You can't write code on a tablet without losing more than half of productivity.

I have yet to see anyone giving a presentation using a tablet. I've seen people
who show their photos to friends using a tablet. IMHO, a TV works better for
this, but is less portable. :)

OTOH, I know some people who really love tablets. Mostly people who only
consume media and don't need a big screen, a keyboard, etc. Tablet as a book
reader is clearly a good use if weight/resolution/battery life are resolved
(e-ink Kindle vs. real tablet dichotomy here). So there's clearly a subset of
people who may abandon PCs for a tablet. I don't think that subset is big, but
see the disclaimer above. Anecdotal ruminations are dangerous.

I agree. I think that PCs are also down because consumers might be delaying
purchases due to a new, upcoming Windows OS.

Also, I think that the tablet market is too new to make sweeping conclusions at
this point. While consumers have been fascinated by them for the past year or
two, IMO it's too early to tell what the true impact will be (PC replacements
vs. delayed PC purchases, etc).

<<would you buy a tablet if it can be docked just as a laptop, and with real

You're essentially describing a laptop, so why not just buy a laptop/ultrabook?

I agree with Jurgis that tablets never going to replace PC's but they will take
wallet share. I love my ipad2, I use it for websurfing, posting here ( as you
can tell by the many spelling errors :-), checking email, youtube, stock
trading (TWS for ipad is great) and on the go apps like yelp, maps.

I like that it is immediately on after I just open the lid, the battery lasts a
whole day of heavy use and I can take it anywhere. I probably could get some if
that in an ultrabook, but they need to get cheaper for me to get interested. I
use two PC's at work and don't really think I have use for an ipad there,but at
home is a different story.

Of the PC manufacturers I prefer DELL over HPQ as an investment. DELL has a
much better balance sheet and more coherent management. Both of them have big
competitive issues, since they have nothing to offer in terms of tablets and
PC's are more and more low margin. Lenovo is making serious inroads in the
corporate hardware market and taking share. DELL's FCF yield is misleading ,
since it does not account for the huge sums going towards acquisitions. Despite
all the efforts, DELL has not been able to overcome the slide in revenues and
gross margins. INTC selling less processors in my opinion foretells more
weakness for the PC manufacturers in the near term. Maybe Windows 8 is the
catalyst to get the sector out of its funk...

OT - I believe we are getting way off topic, but I'll answer this until
moderator is fine with it.

My answers below are not absolute. A number of issues I discuss have been
overcome in research labs or by dedicated enthusiasts. What I try to present is
more of a general public availability view.
<blockquote>would you buy a tablet if it can be docked just as a laptop, and
with real key board and all necessarily software for "real productive"
work?</blockquote>Actually, this has been proposed by a number of companies
even before iPhone came out. Intel (among others) tried to create personal
server device around 2005 or so. So far such devices have not caught on.

To answer your question, I agree with Chris - if you have to carry the
keyboard, then it's already a laptop (or ultrabook depending on size). If you
don't carry the keyboard, you can only do the productive work at the places
where you can dock the device. Also in most cases, I'd need a bigger screen, so
the docking place would have to have a monitor too. This becomes limiting and
laptop seems a better alternative. There is also an issue of software being
available for both tablet input-output mode (touch input, small screen) and for
regular PC-like input-output mode (keyboard/mouse/large display). I.e. the
tablet would have to have to have software for both worlds. Right now this is
not really available.

Tabs are also far from laptops on 3D graphics capabilities. You can't run any
new decent PC game on a tab (although you can run a bunch of good - and bad -
nostalgia games from 5-10 years ago).

In ideal world, yes, I could see such device being great single processing unit
for everything. In real world, we are quite far from it.

Couple more somewhat (un)related observations.

In ideal world, one could store their whole digital media collection on a tab
and connect it wirelessly to TV to consume. In real world, if your TV connects
wirelessly, why do you need a tab? You might as well stream content from the
cloud or your home server.

Phones/tablets are good for media consumption on the go. This works well for
people who like to use computer on the go like public transportation. I don't.

Clownbuck is right that one of the main attractive points of the tab is
instant-on. That's the use of my friend's wife checking the bus in real time. I
also use my tab for checking the weather. But then I paid $149 for it and I
think that's already too much for a weather device. :)

For my price points: OKish basic laptop (15", 4Gb ram, for non gamers) costs
$299. Gaming/power laptop (15-17", 4-6Gb RAM, good graphics chip) costs $599.
These are sale, new (non-refurb) but close to rock-bottom prices. If you'd had
to buy a laptop immediately without waiting for a deal, the price would be
higher.

Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) - peeled off 40% of shares
Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) - Sold my high price shares for small gain

My initial fair value target for MRO was $30.00/share. I decided to reduce my
position by 40% and book my 12% gain from shares purchased 7/30/2012. The
remaining shares I will hold in my Oil basket eventually looking to swap the
balance of the MRO shares into COP (at lower prices $52-$54).

Peeled off my high priced shares of HES for a small gain (bought that lot
4/25/2012 @ $52.42). The remaining shares are a long term hold w/ a $73-$83
GN/EKS$ value price target.

Proceeds to go to EPB and more COP at lower prices ($52-$54). Both generate
higher current dividend payments but may not be as undervalued as HES. With
this reallocation, I am able to up my dividend earnings, reduce my total cost
basis on the positions, and still hold a basket of undervalued assets in EPB,
MRO and HES. For me, the risk reward profile is better positioned for a long

I love reading on iPad, and doing light writing (e-mail, web). Kids love

take share from notebooks.

That said, 13" ultra-books (air, etc) barely take more space nor are they much
heavier than iPad. I tried spreadsheet on iPad, it is way too limited. Too many
websites still use Flash (yahoo finance), so I usually fall back to air. Takes
few seconds to wake up, little longer than iPad. Win8 is also supposed to boot
in seconds also.

I expected that ultra-books get really popular - but they haven't so far. Maybe
when more of them get priced in $700-$800 range, sales will take off. Win8 will
help, battery times are great, so is performance.

read the reply here: http://goo.gl/6zkgk

Lots of good discussion there about all types of preferreds.

It's possible that the CDRpB could trade lower perhaps down to $23.25/share.

A larger concern is that CDR does carry a lot of debt. I do think that stated
BV of $4.84 will increase as the value of their properties increase. However, I
would not be surprised to see a secondary in their common shares. If that
happens, it might provide a good entry point for the common shares.

I have been following you recent call on Excel Trust, Inc. (EXL). They have a
very favorable debt profile and I have done well w/ their preferred. I also
picked up some of their common shares (didn't get the great buy you got). They
operate a similar type of company but on the West Coast but have only half as
much debt as CDR.

I still like the prospects for all REITs in this environment especially if they
have been buying properties at these undervalued prices and are flush with cash
from secondary preferred and/or common offerings.

Re VZ - i don't see VZ as an iphone5 play. If anything, I see it as an iphone 5
bear play. AAPL sells their iphones for ~600$ wholesale per analyst reports.
Typically, the carrier charge the customer ~200$, which mean they essentially
subsidize the iphone with 400$ for a 2 year contract. That is about 17$/month.

Now, if customer would not care about the new iphone and keep their old phones
for a bit longer, the carrier would essentially earn another 17$/month on each
customer. Given the high smartphone penetration, most iphone sales are probably
replacements, so my view may not be totally unrealistic. Of course a customer
of contract has other options and could switch to another carrier or prepaid
for save a few $ but some may just stay due inertia. This would mean free money
to the carriers.

Besides that VZ is not cheap by most metrics. This stock is loved by dividend
investors, and is valued at as a bond substitute and hardly cheap.

AEC yield lower and insider sales. I could not find a better apt reit.

Sjemmeri, I passed on BAH because it didn't have enough public history. I
would've liked to have seen its performance over a full business cycle. It
could be a value stock, although not for me. I've followed Lyondell many times
over the past 17 years --- never really played that one satisfactorily though.

IGT doesn't seem to be a value stock (in my view) at current price. I've been a
recent buyer of competitor WMS (also, not really a value play in my view). In
past, there's been a cycle of refreshes as casinos upgrade/change their games.
Usually IGT has been the market leader in the segment. The slot stocks might
move together though, as they sometimes do.

Ship Finance International Limited (SFL) - Closed out 90% of my long term
position last $17.23/share (xdiv today)

Sold 90% of my SFL that has been a top five position for me. Decided to book my
gains from 2009 w/ an average cost around $10.50/share. Still hold a small stub
position w/ shares that cost as low as $5.50/share. Decided that their leased
fleet (primarily leased to FRO) are the older boats. I have not seen many new
leases and Fredrickson was rumored to be looking at a new company that will
have the newest boats with the new technology. SFL may or may not be the
financing arm. If they get some of that financing, then I may re enter the
position below $15.00/share.

My sale is keeping in line with maintaining a portfolio turnover period of no
more than 36 months ( 3 years). This current position was over a three year
hold allowing me to book a 60% capital gain. Earlier years, I would maintain
the position peeling off my high cost shares. SFL's fleet age is what concerns
me holding long term.

I am not sure the risk/reward and asset value is still there. FWIW S&P released
their opinion on their large debt and raised their view a notch from D to C.
SFL still is vulnerable to FRO's success and they could still impact SFL's
future earnings if/when they write off more of their old ships.

BAH payed a huge special dividend and is quite cheap on PE now. I don't know if
business cycle is that critical to them due to all the government work they do.
I guess there's some fear of how budget cuts could impact them - yeah, right. I
found LYB on an O'Shaughnessy scan (I still like his methods as a way of
generating candidates) and was prompted to buy by comments on this board. IGT
doesn't look real cheap but they are using extra cash for a buyback and I think
new management will help bottom line - maybe online gaming is a wild card.

Re: Manitex International, Inc. (MNTX)

On a quick review, this one may be a potential value candidate w/ a forward PE
of 7. It reminds me of JLG in the early days (perhaps in the 90's). If indeed
we are in a slow sustained housing recovery, this company would benefit. They
still carry a lot of debt when compared to their annual net income (almost 10x)
but, the absolute amount is small only $49M.

I also noticed a lot on insider buys in March at somewhat higher levels too.
Company is growing their revenues too.

REVENUES ($M)

<img src='http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=us_fin_graph&symbol=MNTX&type=2'>

This is one worth watching to monitor for new contracts and/or partnership
deals. I could see a Home Depot doing a deal w/ such a company.

<blockquote>Manitex International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MNTX [FREE Stock Trend
Analysis]) announced today that it has received $6.2 million in new orders for
CVS and Badger Equipment products. Delivery is scheduled for second half 2012
and first half 2013.The CVS order is a follow on order from South Africa for a
fleet of new terminal tractors (previously announced on April 11, 2012) which
now has reached $8 million for a newly launched product with this
dealership.</blockquote>

Margins look good too as long as the new orders continue to come in. Stock has
a five year avg PE of 21 so, if they show sustained growth, there could be PE
expansion as revenues and earnings grow.

FWIW, I followed EKS into IRET due to the location of their holdings. It's
difficult to find a way to play the housing demand in North Dakota that IRET
provides. The debt levels for IRET are not an immediate concern. Major payments
are not due until 2015.

AEC's occupancy rate is much better than IRET's where the latter suffers in its
office space holdings.

AEC has created some built in doubt because they have chosen to build instead
of buying existing properties in two major locations. With depressed real
estate prices their strategy is questionable, but a plus is that AEC may have
the youngest portfolio of property in its sector and some of the metrics
indicate the stock is undervalued.

Congratulations on DRE as it hit a new 52 wk high today.

Thanks for the work and thoughts on this one. I see many positives going
forward, hopefully we won't see a total housing slowdown. This one I bought to
put away for a while and see how things pan out. I find myself having value
stocks and special situation stocks for 30 to 50% upside potential. Presently
holding 50% cash.

I have to agree with you there on the difference between PCs and tablets. In
the company I work for, tablets are being used for some presentations and
sharing of documents, but PCs are by far the dominant hardware...especially HP
and DELL!

Its very confusing sometimes to decide what the future trend will be with
regard to technology. I asked my brother about this the other day (he's quite
the techie) and he went all philosophical and started talking about The
Singularity! Mind blowing stuff but too far away to consider anything
investable at the moment.

My confession to make here is that I have not researched enough on HP and DELL.
I have only looked at INTC in a bit of depth and that was purely because of the
dividend angle.

Best of luck with your tech holdings... : )

You are right, tech is quite risky because of faster obsoletion and product
cycles compared to other fields. Although products in other areas are changing
faster too nowadays. IMHO, even sodas are not as eternal as it seemed for
Buffett. ;) In some ways it's harder to displace BNSF than KO. ;)

Let us know what you think about INTC ... and anything else that you look at.

I am not sure why you consider VZ at 16x forward earnings a value play,
especially considering the debt load and the pension liabilities. VZ has been
well known to have the best netowrk for quite some time, so I am not aure, if
having an iphone on 4g makes all tht much ofna difference.

I think for carriers, it is actually better to have Android phones, because
they are cheaper than iphones and cost them less subsidies.

My believe is that VOD is the better way to play VZW, I'd rather have some
steuggling European wireless business to deal with, than the dying fixed line
business from VZ.

As is often the case, i agree with you Mr. Clownbucks. Maybe a little question
about:

<<the dying fixed line business from VZ.>>

how much of their business is this dying landline thing? i know in my area they
sold to FTR the landline biz, and that was a big deal spread over many, many
states. do they have much landline biz left?

VOD has a higher debt to equity ratio than VZ.

VZ's assets/liabilities ratio is better than VOD's.

VOD is burning cash while VZ has been increasing its retained income.

I don't plan on holding VZ long term. It's a good bet to go higher while its PE
goes from over 40 to the teens.

As always, thanks for your opinion.

Re: Total SA (NYSE: TOT) - Closed out starter position
http://goo.gl/gl1eh - initiated starter position

Since I already have a large exposure to Oil in the portfolio, I closed out my
TOT position that I started 3/27/2012, collected my dividend and booked a small
gain. I moved the proceeds into VOD as I will still get the foreign exposure I
want in Europe but through a telecommunications provider. As already mentioned,
VOD owns a chunk of VZ stock so they should benefit from all the new U.S. and
European 4G services contract revenue from the new new 4G Iphones.

I find the value in the increased cash flows that VOD will generate vs the
intrinsic value of TOT's oil assets. VOD does carry a lot more debt but I see
better long term growth in the wireless market.

I am also going for the dividend income and VOD pays twice a year (NOV and
June) w/ a 7% yield (less foreign tax withholding).

I currently own T, VZ and VOD will expand my exposure into Europe and the EU. I
fell a bit better about investing into the EU now vs the concerns earlier this
year. Telecommunications is a quasi utility and a necessary service for most
everybody.
