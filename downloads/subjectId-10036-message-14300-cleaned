Here is where we disagree. I know that my buys won't

that if I buy a good value, time will come when
the same funds will pounce onto the stock and then
I will sell to them. ;-)

I can only say that several investors here like to buy shares in stocks that
are going down steadily. In a bear market, stocks that go down often continue
to go down.

Try this - go back 9 months and look at WCOM fundies and ask if it looked like
a good value then.

AOL may rebound to 30 or it could fall to 10. The risk/reward is too high for
my taste.

Somebody want to break new ground and post something I and many others on this

investor would. My gut says it is still early, but I could be wrong. AOL is an
annual report I want to spend some time with when I get some time to look at
investment ideas I can't buy professionally. (remember I'm a small cap value
manager, which hasn't been a bad thing recently).

I'll give the thread one to look at which is more like what I used to post on

has been consistently profitable for more than a decade with things probably
getting better in their business). Ticker is FRD. Appreciate any thoughts. I'm

Hi James

Regarding AOL... I looked at it the other day and just can't justify a purchase
anywhere around the current prices.

I get a NetNet valuation of $14.00/share, so it's not selling at a bargain to
NetNet; Using Graham's Valuation formula I get a value of -$8.80/share; I get a
Free Cash Flow of about $.375/share which is not much for the price; and I get
a Return on Capital Employed of about 1%, certainly nowhere close to its cost
of Capital.

Until I see some sign of improving return on capital and increasing free cash
flow, I'll be a skeptic and stay on the sidelines.

Regarding FRD... I like it, I bought it some time back at about $2.25/share.

I get a NeNet value of $2.55/share; Free Cash Flow of about $.35/share; A
Graham value of $3.41 using earnings and $5.09 using free cash flow. My
analysis was only through the 10Q ended 9/30/01. I didn't have ROCE on my
spreadsheet back then. I look for a move to at least $5.00 from these levels.

Jim Clarke, re: AOL. I looked to see if I can show why this stock might be of

reasons. Stock's p/sales might/might not be reasonable; stock is possibly near
book value (after the $50B write-off); breakup value might be about $30 sh.
(with many assumptions, per previous posts here).

Company and stock are very unpopular now. However, looking 3-5 years out, there
are all those great business names and franchises that AOL has. In the past, it
seems to me, Americans have considered their entertainment as a priority and
have been willing to pay for that. I'm saying that AOL ought to have pricing
power in some of its markets. Which is more than most companies have. At some

My quick glance at AOL: best comparisons are other large entertainment
conglomerates (DIS, FOX, VIA). Compared to those valuation seems about right.
They are all either cheap, fair or dear together. Except for the kicker that
the online portion of AOL 'should' grow faster than the others. So if I were
buying 1 company in that area, I would choose AOL but I don't have any now
(except via S&P 500) and am not planning to buy soon.

AGN "Accounting Acrobatics"
http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0429/061.html
Allergan. The Irvine, Calif. pharmaceuticals maker is ramping up an ad campaign
as it awaits government approval of its Botox product for wrinkle-fighting. All
this has The Street cheering Allergan's stock to $58, 34 times earnings.
But behind the glowing numbers are some curious off-balance-sheet research
entities that Allergan (nyse: AGN - news - people ) has used to protect its
bottom line. Allergan joins PeopleSoft (FORBES, Jan. 21) and Elan (Sept. 17,
2001) in this cost-shifting masquerade.
In Allergan's deals, it joins another company in a joint venture, makes a cash
investment, then gets some or all of the cash back in the form of a fee for
doing R&D. Chief Financial Officer Eric Brandt argues that Allergan uses the
move to compete with the pharmaceutical big boys and that its accounting is
legitimate.
Flash back to 1997, when Allergan launched a subsidiary, Allergan Specialty,
and funded it with $200 million. The unit was going to develop drugs for eye
diseases like glaucoma. In March 1998 Allergan spun off the unit, distributing
its Class A common stock to Allergan shareholders. Allergan recorded most of
the $200 million as a nonrecurring charge (the sort Wall Street tends to
ignore) and kept an option to buy the unit. Was the unit now dealing with its
former parent at arm's length? Not exactly. Three Allergan officials, including
its chief executive, sat on Allergan Specialty's board.
Next, the unit recycled the $200 million back to Allergan to cover Allergan's
own R&D expenses. For every buck Allergan spent on research, it billed Allergan
Specialty $1.10. Besides covering costs, Allergan got a fee for licensing
certain technology to the unit. If Allergan had incurred the R&D costs
directly, the costs would have cut deeply into its earnings. Without Specialty,
we estimate Allergan's 2000 earnings per share would have been $1.15, instead
of the reported $1.61.

Couple of "oops" - AGN, UAL

1. Possibly I was wrong to study AGN a little more before committing funds.
Allergan is up 8-9 points (from 58 to 66 roughly)since April 8th-9th when we
started talking about it here. Missed the move. Move could continue too now
that Botox is approved. However, one article I read said that MD's already have
been using the injections for a couple of years, so the FDA approval now
primarily means that TV ads are okay. And maybe this just means incremental
sales. (No steep earnings boost) Who knows? The women-talking-to-women
grapevine possibly already has known about this procedure. (I assume women are
more concerned with wrinkles and doing something about it than men - in
general, of course). I'll continue to pass on AGN.

2. Closed my VERY losing position in United Airlines (UAL). Deteriorating
balance sheet bothers me. (And to some extent, I'm tired of seeing this stock
staring back at me every day.)
As well, I'm still holding several other airline stocks from before 9/11. If
UAL stock improves further, I will make the presumption that the rest of the
major carriers will see their stocks rise too, and I can participate in that
move. If UAL stock stays where it is, or drops, I'm already out, and have freed
up funds for presumably better investments.

strategy of buying story or fire-sale price, then researching to see if I
wanted to keep it....selling quickly if it looked uglier than originally
assessed. I was tempted to do that here, but the general sag in the druggies
caused me to hold off. Then, before the FDA news, I read Forbes 'Accounting

TimbaBear: I'll take a position today in CPAK, which you mentioned last year.
To update the thread:

Imo, CPAK is like a buggy whip company, more so than a cigar butt. They're a
mini-conglomerate which tries to capitalize on brand names they acquire.
Perhaps most known for being the Fuller brush people. In consumer goods, I
believe "Brillo" is their's too. (I'm trying to confirm this.) They have
several industrial businesses. To me, the buggy-whip is the silver halide part
which includes businesses manufacturing and selling photographic film and
supplies, and an international business recycling silver from companies'
chemical (film) processes.

Stock has very little institutional interest. The major institutional holder
seems to be a continual seller. There's not much street interest either -- the
stock trades in a narrow range.

What you do get for about $6.15/sh is a small company selling under $10.15
stated book value, debt/eq about .15 with about $2.00 sh. in cash. A profitable
company that pays .28 div (4.6% yield). Cash flow is "good" (my quotes. I defer
to Timba/others who are much better students of this metric than I am.)

ROE, ROA, p/s, p/e have trended down (Sales up over past decade -- possibly
it's the acquisitions.) Perhaps the down trend in these ratios is to be
expected from buggy-whips. OTOH, the company is a survivor, and there's
financial flexibilty (money) to make changes. Imo, CPAK is worth a small bet
that the stock price might be higher 18-24 months out.

loans originated with WM and mentioned their target of 13% EPS growth.

Outsourcing was also up significantly and he explained that they hope to reduce
it but there are areas where it made sense. Apparently, some subs were not
performing, leading to service levels (i.e., loan servicing) suffering, and
ultimately, changes and corrective action. (If I was a sub I would've been

Actually, companies can reduce the impact of double taxation by doing stock buy

gains rate, rather than as ordinary income. Unfortunately, tracing the record
of stock buybacks is much more difficult than looking at a simple dividend
payout record.

As to increasing debt, to me it's a separate issue, but perhaps some companies
do leverage in order to increase dividend yield as you suggest.

to clarify, I'm not suggesting that dividend yield is increased by shifting
capitalisation to debt, I'm suggesting that a more leveraged capital structure
throws off interest instead of divdidends...that interest isn't double taxed
and 'investors' in that debt can have the income steam they want by mixing debt
and equity in their holdings. Debt is a more efficient way to deliver income,
IOW.
An interesting extension of this concept is Haugen's superstocks concept, where
a mix of shares and debt is put together to produce a portfolio that, if viewed
as a 'stock,' would have a lower PE, higher growth rate, higher dividend
yield...an overall better value, with lower volatility than any single stock

interesting article, Amit. i always like the dividend topic. i think companies
should pay dividends early and often. the thing about the double taxation
bit...it's not like Congress just recently started taxing dividends and then
companies stopped paying them in knee-jerk fashion. rather, there's been a
gradual decline over the years as the stock market became a bubble. even as
recently as the early 90s, the SPX dividend yield was well over 3%, which was
not egregiously far from historical norms. as the mania took hold and fantasy
earnings came to replace cash, people looked for all sorts of excuses why
dividends were evil...and the taxman seems to be one of the scapegoats.

not that i disagree with you that tax policy would be more rational if
dividends weren't double-taxed...but i don't think that's the real reason
dividend yields have declined.

ironically, today's US investor is better equipped to avoid dividend taxation
than investors in the past, who required much higher dividend yields across the
market. why? IRAs. i stick almost all my heavy dividend payers in my IRAs and
thereby avoid the double taxation. there is now what--hundreds of billions, or
maybe trillions, of tax-sheltered IRA dollars that could welcome dividends
without taxation, but the bubbleonian spirit and decline in earnings quality
have kept US investors from demanding cash in hand.

in sum, i see taxation as the straw man, behind which hides the remains of the
bubble-logic mindset.

In fact to go one step further, can't one argue that, on the whole,
corporations are paying about the same dividends as >10 years ago by the
measure that matters - payout ratio (no sane company would set the dividend as
a yield and be forced to increase it just because the stock went up)?
Specifically, if dividend yields (div/P) are ~ half what they were and P/E are
~ double what they were then div/E hasn't changed much on the whole. Does
anyone have historical payout ratio data?

actually, payout ratio has declined. historically (i.e., since 1926 when the
SPX data are available), payout ratio has been about 55% as i recall; today, it
is more like 33%. superficially, it might look like cos would thus have more
money to plow back into earnings growth. but the problem is, now cos spend
almost another 33% of earnings on share buybacks (to offset options-related
dilution). this leaves only about 33% of earnings (which works out to about 1%
of market cap at today's PEs) for today's companies to plow back into their
businesses. in contrast, historically cos have been able to retain 45% of
earnings for discretionary capex at the like, and moreover, the historical
average PE was about 14, so this worked out to about 3% of market cap.

it seems imho unrealistic that today's companies will be able to grow at
historical rates while only retaining 1% of market cap, compared to the
historical average retention of 3%. it would seem cos would have to make up the
difference (2% of market cap) through other means, such as more stock issuance
and/or greater debt loads.

<<but i don't think that's the real reason dividend yields have declined.>>

Managements always cite the capital gains vs. dividend tax rates as the reason
they are stingy with dividends and buy back shares instead.

But there's another reason thats rarely mentioned, but is huge I think. Stock
options. Think of a company that kicks out huge amounts of free cash flow.
Options only incent appreciation of the stock price, not the other part of
total return which is the dividend. Think about having 10 year options on a
company which pays out 60% of its free cash flow as a dividend vs. the same
company which has no dividend yield but just piles up the cash on the balance
sheet or buys back stock. If you were the executives getting that incentive,
what would you do?

Option holders don't get the dividend. Thats just cash out the door for them,
literally. What do you think Microsoft option holders would think about a plan
to pay out 60% of the free cash flow as dividends?

I like dividends where I don't trust management to do the right thing with the
free cash flow, and there are very few managements I trust to reinvest cash
better than I can. But the incentives for management under option plans make
them all allocate capital in a way that hurts shareholders in many many cases.

Okay, Allen Furlan, I've waited a day or so for "those who understand
situations such as sofn" to respond to your request about BPP. I'm not one who
qualifies per your request, but I'll comment now anyway. BPP looks like a
reasonable bet to me. They've listed out what they believe is the net asset
value after making reasonable allowances for expenses (or so it seems to me).
They've listed what might go wrong (failure of tenants to pay, inability to
sell properties at what their appraisal says, etc.) Maybe the pieces they are
trying to sell now are the dregs - the other sales were the desirable
properties and easy sales. (I don't know this to be either a fact or
consideration though.) Stock price seems well below the breakup price -assuming
that's the net asset price as estimated by management. The insiders (per Yahoo)
aren't selling out now. So overall, it looks like a good bet to me.

Assuming there are continuing partial payments to stockholders over the next 12
months or so, I'll go for a position (small) in a deferred tax account.

Stock will be converted to a liquidating trust, which I believe implies that
the stock buyers who enter the trust forgo being able to see a daily stock
quote or being able to sell (trade) out of position. That is, if someone buys
the stock and holds it through to the transfer to liquidating trust, that
person will then be forced to hold all the way to the final distribution and
the trust being dissolved. Shouldn't be problem for patient value investors.

CPCL update:

It's still in Curt Jensen's (Marty Whitman's) Third Value Small-Cap fund,
according to Yahoo.

The stock's been on a tear recently. It's no longer a net-net when some people
here started to buy or were adding to positions already held.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CPCL&d=c&t=2y&l=on&z=b&q=l

In spite of its rapid ascent the past few days, CPCL trades now slightly over
stated book. It has no long term debt.
The stock may be fully-valued or even overvalued though. So maybe a pullback
can be expected.

OTOH, what I like about the stock is that it's extremely difficult, maybe
impossible, to evaluate the true worth of the company now because of its
involvement with a presumably important new technology - OLED (organic LEDs).
So the company might now, and in future also, trade on its potential, on the
dreams of its stockholders, and on generous estimates and speculations about
future possibilities.

Here I will go with the "ready, fire, aim" school and the accompanying
"investigate after you invest" mantra. I've added a little more CPCL to my
position today. I don't at all like averaging up, especially after the stock
has run up so much so soon, but in this particular instance it's very possible
-- I will bet -- that there is still more appreciation to be seen as the
stock's story unfolds. That is my hope anyway, unsupported by any facts.

Paul,thanks for your comments per bpp. I took a small position. Guess this
satisfies my arbitrage appetite.
Here is an interesting aside. Today I sold 10 more naked calls on brcd, the
04/90 If the speculators should push this stock to 90 in next 21 months I will
be in deep kimshi.
but my assessment is that there is a very small chance of that happening. The
cost of doing this transaction is 10% of stock price or $260 plus the value of
the short option or $165. This $425 "investment" is essentially margin
availability. If the stock gets down to its fair value($10 in my opinion) the
requirement will probably be about what I have already brought in($165). As
time passes a "portofolio" of short option positions accumulates very nicely.
This is an inverse of value investing, ie picking stocks that are hopelessly
overvalued.
To those who say too risky I would say that the strategy can work very well
with a hedge that significantly minimizes risk. In the case of brcd I do have
small positions in emc and ntap which I use as a hedge. If anybody on this
thread knows of a site which would help identify good candidates I would
appreciate knowing.

The Storage Bubble Is Soon to Burst

By MARK VEVERKA

"...Two years ago, star venture capitalist Vinod Khosla publicly predicted that
an optics bubble was nigh. There were hundreds of overvalued startups looking
to capitalize on the telecom mania, and the Kleiner Perkins partner saw that
the market could never absorb them all. Recent bankruptcy filings by Yipes and
Global Crossing, which were thought to be exceedingly well-funded companies,
are testimony to the crash of that once effervescent market.

We caught up with Khosla recently in Arizona, where over cereal and coffee, he
told us he planned to make a similar prognostication about another bubbly
sector: storage startups. Sure enough, Khosla gave a speech the next day at
technology guru George Gilder's Storewidth Conference in southern California
that foretold a similar fate for storage. We were unable to attend the
presentation, but Darren Thomas, chief executive of one such startup, Zambeel,
was on hand.

"Khosla's intent was to show that there simply are too many players in the
space. There are a hundred and something storage companies," Thomas notes.
"Clearly, there is a storage bubble, and it's a bubble because the space is
hot."

The former head of Compaq Computer's highly regarded storage business, Thomas
heads a company funded, in part, by Khosla. Zambeel has raised a hefty $65
million to date, much of it thanks to Thomas, who was aggressively recruited by
Kleiner Perkins to run the firm. Thomas was attracted to the job because he
anticipates that new storage hardware architecture is going to emerge sooner or
later. Not surprisingly, he thinks Zambeel, which has developed technology for
storage area networks, has a good shot at making that happen. Storage area
networks give computers access to large numbers of data-storage systems and are
deemed more efficient than traditional storage hardware.

As it turns out, Khosla's proclamation may have been more of a declaration than
an earthmoving prognostication, protests Gary Bloom, chief executive of storage
software maker Veritas Software.

"I predicted it during the last part of last year. We did our last venture
investment during the latter half of last year," Bloom says. "Now we've seen
all of the valuations fall. I just think he's a little late, because a lot of
the air has already been let out."

The Truth Is Out There

Enterprise software of many flavors, not just storage, is going though a
transformation. Gone are the days of the mega-deal. Big deal flows have slowed,
and customers are buying less in anticipation of future needs, Bloom says.
Software makers must do a larger number of smaller deals to make their numbers.

Because most larger software sales are closed toward the end of a quarter,
Veritas was surprised when a number of big customers cut their orders by more
than a half when it came time to buy. Deals originally valued at $4 million
were slashed to $750,000, and that didn't bode well for the rest of the year.

"These budgets were created during very difficult windows of economic data,"
Bloom says. "It's a more buy-as-you-go approach that customers are taking."

The good news for Veritas shareholders is that the company's small deal flow
has been steady, and market share in recovery and back-up storage software has
risen since Sept. 11. Look for Veritas to make news next week during its annual
customer hoedown in Dallas, where the software maker plans to unveil a new line
of products for IBM's Unix server platforms. As an "agnostic," or neutral,
manufacturer, Veritas has provided software to most of the major storage
hardware players, including industry leader EMC, Compaq, Hitachi Data Systems,
and Hewlett-Packard. Until now, IBM has been a missing link in its product
offerings.

As is often the case in cutthroat technology marketing wars, EMC apparently
isn't thrilled with Veritas's new relationship with nemesis IBM. Thus, the
folks from Hopkinton, Mass., have planned a counter-marketing announcement in
Manhattan in attempt to steal some of Veritas' thunder.

As hardware becomes less relevant and more commoditized, Bloom says EMC will
tout its shift into the higher margin storage-software business. "In a funny
way, we like that they are trying to rain on our parade," Bloom says. "It is a
very public acknowledgment that all of the value in the storage market is
moving away from the hardware to the software."

To that point, EMC was subjected to some tough love last week from brokerage
analyst Ashok Kumar of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "We are not sure who the new
king [of storage] is going to be, but it probably won't be EMC. They are
today's re-enactment of the trains-to-planes evolution that happened in
transportation 70 years ago," Kumar stated in a note. "The value they have in
their systems will be replaced by more efficient, more valuable functions
running in network boxes. EMC is still an extremely important and influential
company, but their window to shift their business emphasis is closing," he
wrote.

Wasn't it just yesterday that world-beating EMC couldn't be stopped?..."

I've started taking a similar strategy. Don't recommend it for most people. It
is selling naked out-of-the-money puts on stocks I wouldn't mind owning.

If you check the vol quotes, you'll notice that out-of-the-money puts have
higher implied vols than out-of-the-money calls. This means the premiums on
puts are richer than on calls.

This doesn't make sense to me from a statistical perspective as on-average
stocks go up at more than risk free rate (used in Black-Scholes valuation),
hence a naked call option should be undervalued versus a naked put option. It
does make sense to me from an insurance perspective: Buying puts is like buying
insurance for your portfolio, so you have to pay the insurance premium.

With all that in mind, I prefer to sell out-of-the-money puts. I sell them for
a stock I wouldn't mind owning at the strike price.

Another nice thing about selling out-of-the-money puts is I can use a limit
order and don't have track the order from second to second, as the value of the
out-of-the-money puts is less sensitive to moves in the stock price then say an
at-the-money option. Of course, it is best to diversify and take smaller
positions on these things, as being short any naked option could cause a lot of
pain.

i also use naked OTM puts on stocks i want to own, in margin acct. in IRAs, i
can achieve the same by doing a buy-write on an ITM call. e.g., WMI underlying
at ~26; May 25 call at 1.50 bid so net debit is 24.50 with 25 cap. similarly,
the May 25 put is at .50, which works out to the same effective buy-in price if
put of 24.50.
theoretically, the put should provide less money than the buy-write (since the
put requires less capital up front), but i have noticed sometimes the reverse
is the case. i think one problem people can run into with naked puts is if they
write a whole slew of them (with a notional value exceeding the amount of
underlying they'd want to purchase at the put price).
i sold some puts on WMI when the vols went way up about a month ago after an
SEC announcement shook the stock.

I have found some interesting ideas on the Mr. Pinks picks thread relative to
over valued stocks. However I am not comfortable with the idea of shorting
stocks, especially when the momentum players are involved in the action. Would
like to find stocks that are just plain too high and which have way out of the
money options.
Although the idea of selling naked options is considered too risky by the
"experts" I will repeat that one can hedge. Also the amount of capital involved
is small so if one is careful the positions taken can be over many different
issues in different sectors providing diversification.
A comment on puts. They can be sold naked in an IRA if you use either cash or
short term treasuries to back up the amount necessary from an assignment.
Good luck to all.

Allen,

A comment on puts. They can be sold naked in an IRA if you use either cash or
short term treasuries to back up the amount necessary from an assignment.

i have heard there are brokerages that allow this (cash-covered naked puts) in
an IRA, but those tend to be brokerages i've never heard of (doesn't mean they
aren't good, of course). i have not found a major discount broker i'd want to
deal with that allows this strategy, and going to some place that does is not
worth the bother for me since i can achieve the same effect by selling ITM
calls against common.

i have noticed the CCs for dummies thread likes the idea of writing calls
against "core" positions, but i personally consider that something of an
oxymoron. i wouldn't write a call if i wasn't ready to have the stock called
away, because i think "repair" strategies (chasing short calls in an uptrend to
avoid being called out) is a loser's game in the long run. and if i am ready to
give up a stock at short notice due to a call, then i can hardly consider it a
"core position".

that may sound like quibbling over semantics, but i think it has pretty
important implications for call-writing strategy. my own bias is to use call
premiums as a simple discounting mechanism, whereby i will either own a
position i am comfortable with at a discount or else get called out (that seems
to be what you are describing for your CIEN strategy). that is different than
treating calls as a sort of surrogate dividend on a LTBH stock, and sometimes
being in the position of having to buy back the call at a much higher price to
avoid losing the stock, which i think is a sort of pseudo-naked-call strategy.

Could keep the pressure on Merck. From
http://www.forbes.com/2002/04/19/0419nvs.html?partner=yahoo&referrer=

Paulo Costa, who heads the company's U.S. drug division, Novartis
Pharmaceuticals, confirms that, for the near future, Novartis' growth will
continue to rely largely on Diovan and Lotrel, two high blood pressure drugs
that have been on the market for several years. But he points to one of the
company's new drugs as a potential windfall: Prexige, an arthritis treatment
previously known only by the code-name Cox-189.

"For competitive reasons, we have not disclosed much about Prexige," Costa
says. "Most of our competitive data will by released at the meeting of the
American College of Rheumatology in October."

Here's what is known: Prexige is a new drug in the same class as Celebrex and
Vioxx, the blockbuster arthritis drugs developed by Pharmacia (nyse: PHA - news
- people ) and Merck (nyse: MRK - news - people ). This drug class, known as
the Cox-2 inhibitors, stops inflammation without causing the side effects in
the stomach or intestine that can result from older drugs like aspirin and
ibuprofen.

However, growth of Vioxx and Celebrex may have been slowed by fears of
cardiovascular concerns that were raised in the Journal of The American Medical
Association (JAMA) in August 2001. The drug companies have argued that the
concerns, raised by Dr. Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic and his colleagues,
resulted from a misguided analysis of existing data, but the concerns have not
fully lifted. Vioxx's label now indicates the drug may carry some
cardiovascular risk.

Novartis' response to the concerns that Cox-2 inhibitors might cause heart
problems is to run extra clinical trials to try and prove that its drug does no
cardiovascular damage. In addition to a study of 13,000 patients that will be
used to convince the FDA to approve the drug, Novartis is conducting an
18,000-patient outcome study to try and demonstrate that its drug does not
cause an increased risk, however rare, of heart attack.

Right now, Costa says, the company does not know what the data from its
clinical trials will show, but Novartis is very optimistic about Prexige based
on earlier data. "We're going to have entrant data at the time of the launch,
which will probably, at that point, only allow us to say that we haven't seen
any indication of cardiovascular side effects," Costa says. "It is only nine
months after launch that we will really know what the true profile of the drug
is."

Costa believes any new Cox-2 inhibitor could be competitive. The question
Novartis' studies are asking is exactly how competitive this one will be.

That price quote on FINN.ob where I was expecting maybe at most a fifteen
dollar stock when I looked it up.
---------------

And a VERY unusual dividend policy at FNIN if I read their press release
correctly. The dividend amount will vary with the stock price!!???

"The dividend payment is made pursuant to the policy adopted by the Board in
May, 2001, which anticipates that the Company will declare and pay, on a
semiannual basis, a dividend on the common stock of the Company so as to
provide to shareholders with an annualized yield of approximately 3% on the
market value of the common stock."

And another press release which indicates there's a potential acquirer lurking
about.

Would be nice though to see some insider buys instead of small and
persistent(?) sells.

I don't understand why stated book value dropped so much from '00 to '01, but
if $18.90 is about right now, then FNIN trading at $13.75 seems to be a buy --
given the way I look at these types of insurance companies. (jmo, and I'm wrong

Good evening Paul --

"finn.ob" is a company that will clearly go private or be sold outright. The
company's management has no desire to offer a trading type stock or maintain a
typical investor relationship with the investing community. The company is
trading @ about a 11x - 12x multiple with a negligible dividend. Company
management continue to hold a significant ownership position. The company is
trading at a significant discount to companies that are taken over in this
industry. The p/s, p/b all are quite reasonable.

You are right about "fnin's" dividend policy. The company completed a merger,
which affected the book value. The treasurer was ill & sold a significant
amount of stock in 2001 & early 2002 stock. The company, as you mention, will
be sold at some point in the future. The CEO is getting up there in age and has
expressed a desire to sell the company. The company isn't growing, but has a
reasonable dividend, continues to sell at a 9x p/e muliple, and has a low p/s,
p/b. The company also has a fair amount of Austin, Texas real estate -- which I
don't include in my valuations.

that would have been smart...but the mini-GE story DEAD. Not only is TYC not
seen as mini-GE, but the real GE story has quit working. By reporting on the
businesses separately and sticking to knitting DK and co may be able to start
selling them off in a year to two. I still think the assets are worth more than
the price and selling them is the way to get that value.

From:- with a K
I looked at BMY but didn't like their inventory and pipeline problems. I think
I read something about the terrible morale issues they're dealing with, too.

I'm more attracted to the generics and bought PRX after it fell hard in late
February. Here are my notes:

Date: Wednesday, February 20, 2002
Subject: PRX Now On Sale!

PRX got whacked 36% today because they announced a competitor got FDA approval
for their weight gain drug for which PRX had a head start. (Bristol-Meyers
makes the propriety drug that PRX first copied; now another generic is in the
game.)

My thesis for buying:

* severe market overreaction (Even though the PRX generic accounted for up 25%
of their business, they lost 36% of stock value in one day. And PRX, with its
nice margins, can always respond with lower prices.)

* They have many others products out and more in the pipeline. Have some patent
protection, too.

* I was interested in PRX when the stock was at $26; now it's back up over $20

* Seems like a great value at this price. Nice fundamentals.

* It bounced off it's low and has shown some strength in a choppy market

* With all the bad news from Bristol-Myers, Merck, Elan, and Watson, this is a
contrarian play when things look bleakest for drug companies.

* Fell dramatically below its 200 DMA and (should?) pull back up to around
$25-28

BUT: Not a steady-eddy kind of company. Ugly chart. Lost money 1997-00; current
liabilities are rising steadily; NAIC SSG looks like teenage vomit in a mosh
pit.

Overview:
Pharmaceutical Resources makes those generic drugs that your insurance company
likes so much. Through subsidiary Par Pharmaceutical, the company offers more
than 100 products representing various dosages of more than 40 prescription and
over-the-counter drugs, concentrating on nervous system, cardiovascular,
anti-inflammatory, anti-infective, and anticancer drugs. The company makes
about half of the products it sells; the rest are made by such companies as
BASF, Halsey Drug, and Merck KGaA (which owns more than 40% of Pharmaceutical
Resources). The firm bought ISP FineTech from International Specialty Products.
The company sells its products mainly to drug distributors, wholesalers, and
retail pharmacy chains.

News:

April 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Par today announced that it has entered into
an agreement to expand its strategic product partnership with Merck KGaA. Under
the terms of the agreement, Par has licensed from Merck the exclusive rights to
11 generic pharmaceutical products currently under development. Most of these
products are expected to enter the U.S. market between 2003 and 2006.

"These 11 new product opportunities further enhance our prospects for sustained
growth in the years 2003 and beyond." Terms of the agreement call for Merck to
develop the products and submit all corresponding applications to the FDA.
Merck will also manufacture the products. Par will serve as exclusive U.S.
marketer and distributor of the products plus pay a share of the costs,
including development and legal, incurred to obtain final regulatory approval.
In return, Par will receive slightly more than 50% of the profits. In 2001, the
cumulative sales of the 11 branded products totaled approximately $7.8 billion.

Barron's January Roundtable Story (Best Picks For 2002)
Schafer: "Pharmaceutical Resources still has huge potential. The company is
stronger now, and better able to implement the strategy I talked about last
year, when I said it would earn $1.25 to $1.50 in 2001. That will be close to
$1.40, and the early estimate for 2002 is close to $2. Meanwhile Merck, which
held 42% of the stock, has sold its shares in an offering to institutional
shareholders.

Pharmaceutical Resources is now able and anxious to make strategic product and
corporate acquisitions, so it can transform itself from a me-too generic drug
company into a more sustainable and profitable grower which could earn close to
$4 in the next two to three years. [On January 11 the company announced it will
acquire ISP Finetech, which manufactures organic compounds for the
pharmaceutical industry. Oscar calls this a "company-transforming
transaction".] If the company sells at only the average P/E of its peers, the
stock could sell at 80 a share. To get to $4 in earnings, though, the company
needs to introduce some of the 20 or so products, whose current branded volume
is about $12 billion, that it now has [awaiting approval] at the Food and Drug
Administration. It also needs to make strategic acquisitions. Recently the
company licensed a sustained-release technology from Elan, which, if
successful, could add another layer of insulation against other generics
entering the market.

Since last January, Pharmaceutical Resources has launched several strengths of
generic Prozac into a $2 billion market. It also has introduced a product for
AIDS patients to help them gain weight. This is a $250 million market. Since
the company introduced the product it has garnered 70% of total prescriptions.
Unlike most generics, Pharmaceutical Resources has its own patents which can
stave off competition for more than the normal 180-day exclusivity period.

Q: How can you have a patent on a generic?
Schafer: They have a process patent. If the company is successful it will
evolve in the next few years into a specialty pharmaceuticals company with
long-lived products. Then it will deserve a higher-than-20 price/earnings
multiple, in which case the stock could be closer to 100. If the company earns
$2 this year the stock will be close to 50. Right now it's around 29.

OT, Saturday night story: SEC Enforcement comes after little me! (long)

Got an interesting call from the SEC a while ago. Couple of people on a speaker
phone introduce themselves and say they’d like to ask me a few questions about
an investigation they’re making. Truthful answers are important, they say, and
rather than sending a guy out to my house, they'd like to talk to me on the
phone for a couple of minutes about a stock I bought. I say sure. They tell me
the name of the company. I can't remember owning it I say. (Well thread
readers, I AM one for lots of diversification, and my memory is slipping a bit
too. Plus it was not a well-known company.) What's the symbol I ask as I turn
to my computer to look it up. (It was a very dink company.) They say it doesn't
trade anymore. That stops me with my hands on the keyboard, and I pause a bit.
I ask them when I bought it. They say in such-and-such month last year. No
help. I still can’t remember it. I blurt out, in what account? They tell me. (I
hide my astonishment that they’re really prepared and would have this
information.) I say okay, I've just wrapped up my tax files for last year, and
my stock trades are right here. I pull them out, find the account and month,
and sure enough there are xxx shares. I tell them I see the xxx shares I
bought. They say there's another buy too. I look down the broker's statement,
and sure enough there's the next order fill. Then it hits me. It was a stock I
bought, and it seems like within two days (my memory might be wrong here too)
there was a cash takeover offer for double and more over my buy price.

Ah ha, now I remember the story well, I say. I spotted some very unusual
insider trading in a media report, and I checked out the fundamentals of the
stock which seemed okay, and most likely I bought the next trading day, I tell
them. And Very Luckily for me, I can now remember and cite the day and source
of the nationally published article that listed the specific insiders’ buy
which led me to make my buy. (I am feeling good that I can show my purchase is
based on public information.)

I tell them I can't remember if I held the stock for the acquirer's cash or
sold the stock before the deal closed though. They say I sold. Oh yeah, that
seems about right, I remember it now all right, I add. Was so unusual. I
usually post my trades on the internet I say--- and one of the SEC people
somewhat excitedly (?) interrupts to ask - did you? I say no I didn't. Happened
so fast. What's the point? It would just be after the buyout offer and sound
like bragging and irritate everybody.

In the chit chat, they ask me where I'm from, or I volunteer it. They ask me if
I'm in the company's geographical area (luckily no). (These New Yorkers are not
too familiar with West Coasters –g-.) Then they ask me if it's okay if they ask
me if I know any of the names they have on a list, reminding me again in so
many words, that truthfulness counts. I say ask, and I reply to each name, that
I never heard of the person (which is true). And they ask me if I ever worked
for the acquiring company or the acquired company or for a couple of other
companies they mention that might have been in the same business. No to all
that also. Couple of closing comments and they were gone.

Made my day!

Still, it was strange too. I really had just a very small starter position in
the company. But in retrospect, if it was significant that I could remember
exactly why the stock was so appealing to me (even as I couldn’t remember the
company or my purchases or sales), maybe I goofed and should have bought more
initially. OTOH, for me, a small starter position is all that I might
reasonably do – trying to be diversified and having knowledge that many things
can go wrong when one makes a buy of a dinky microcap as a result of a small
blurb in one newspaper article.)

Nice to see that the SEC seems to be thorough though in its investigations when
it undertakes them.

Paul Senior, who posits:
Keeping good records is important, and
if your purchases are somehow linked to an SEC investigation (even for very
small amounts of money), the feds just might send a person to see you. –g-

I'm glad you took the time to share that story!

Can you imagine the kinds of stories these investigators must hear? You are
probably one of the most cogent investors/speculators they have talked with.

Since insiders were buying (per published SEC reports) and since you looked up
those reports, could it be said you were buying on "insider" information? Yuk,
yuk! :~)

Good for you that you kept the records!

Thanks again for sharing!

<<If one listened to Yahoo postings, one would never invest in anything...>>The
key with any message board...indeed with news/opinion flow from all sources, is
to recognize unique and valuable insight. Had I been a holder of ENE and seen
the post about off-balance-sheet debt or the post: "Look at the lease
obligations in the footnotes of the 10-K. There are a lot of liabilities that
are not included in the balance sheet numbers." It would have encouraged me to
dig deeper. OTOH, opinions that 'This is about to implode or some such' are, as

im a fairly active trader myself - but i HATE paperwork. i dont even match up

shoebox full of paper they are always welcome.

i used to worry about keeping my tax records all tidy and what not. i have 6
kids and several years ago one of my kids got into the cupboard in my office
where all that stuff was kept and you would not BELIEVE the mess he made. i
told my wife - hey, if we have ever have an audit we just stick the auditor in
the office and put the kids in there with him...lol

when i pay local taxes for business which is generally not large amounts i dont
even like to waste the time going through all the crap to get the figures - so
in the past i have simply sent in my guestimates with a letter and told them
that its just my "best guess - but if you want to send someone out to wade
through my paperwork to get a more exact figure - BE MY GUEST.

Yes, WCOM debt is a concern.

For now, it seems that WCOM has enough cash to service their debt. Debt due
might be a problem in '03 when the amounts are larger. If their debt problems
don't have to be resolved now, then imo, that gives management and bankers more
options and more time to save the company. And a potential that the stock could
recover, if only at least temporarily - maybe to double or more from today's
price.

At this point the bond market is saying it's a very risky bet, and there's
obviously quite a move for the exits by stockholders. Sometimes these people
are right, and sometimes the consensus is wrong. Time will tell. I'm prepared
to hold what I have until I see Chapt. 11. Adding more stock to my position now
though... that, as I say, I am hesitant to do.

The problem with debt-bomb telcos has not always been cash flow; once the
concerns begin, banks and other creditors can put on the screws and start
calling stuff in early. In some cases that may be part of a campaign to force
Chapter 11 and a firm settlement with creditors instead of dragging out the
drama for another year, when the remaining assets may be worth even less.

For me, risk like that obliterates any other value concern. But who knows, some
folks bought KM under a buck and doubled their money if they flipped their
shares in time.
