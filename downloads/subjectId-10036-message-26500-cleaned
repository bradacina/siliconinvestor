To reply to the one question you are asking- no . i dont expect them to give
firm estimates. I am surprised that they are giving any estimates at all for
the year. I dont see how they can. I dont see how they can predict how much
more they will have to repurchase and what losses they will suffer on those new
repurchases. What earnings are you willing to project for this company in 2007?

i couldn't begin to guess what they will earn this year, that was my point...no
one knows what they will earn

they gave their best estimate based on the lower gain on sale margins they are
seeing, and the conditions that will prevail for the time being...i don't see
what else you would want them to do...i guess they could just withdraw all
guidance, but i don't see how that serves anyone's best interests

things may worsen, but the situation hasn't changed nearly as substantially as
your post implied...as someone else posted here, if anyone owned this stock
thinking that the earnings guidance and dividend yield were 100% assured, they

TCK. Doug5y, if I were to ask, it'd be, what do you need to find out about TCK
from your DD that you don't already know?

Ha, maybe the answer for me is that I'll find out within a year what I should
have found out now. Maybe when it's too late.

-----
My understanding - and I could be wrong here - is that TCK is family
controlled. The fact they are willing to diversify and the way they seem to
invest, indicates to me they are managing for the long term. I view that as a
positive in the mining business. OTOH, if the stock is family controlled, one
has to hope the management is competent in assessing new business risks, and
the family's interests are somewhat aligned with the small investor's. Since
there's no white knight to come in and rescue stockholders from
misfeasance/malfeasance.

Paul, the thing that has changed for me is my full position in EDVMF. It's
acting as a proxy for all these mining stocks I used to have
in my portfolio eg TCK, SIL, CCJ, etc. So my DD in TCK is
really portfolio specific : Does TCK bring something which EDVMF
doesn't? EDVMF isn't perfect, that's for sure.
Just finding what exactly they're invested in, is one big question mark.
Inside ownership is also low. Scuttlebut I've heard ( I live in
Calgary ) is that TCK is considering entering tar sands mining in
northern Alberta, I already have a position in SU. It's just one of their
options.

So those were some of the DD issues I had in mind. Seeing TCK
show up on Greenblatt's list is just one positive IMHO. Paul
Senior's interest is also another positive.

Do you have a position in EDVMF?

Doug5y, yes, I have a few EDVMF. Attempting to add more now; not so willing to
step up though. Should have listened to Madharry a month and half ago and a
point and a half lower. That's been a good move (about 6 1/2 to 8), and so
gives me some pause. Stock is still below a growing nav though.

As you allude, EDVMF can be kind of a black box where it's hard to understand
the worth of what they own. Well, hard for me, anyway. I won't bet much more
now, but if/as nav increases, I might be more willing to add substantially more
then.

Since I have only a few EDVMF now, I'm not concerned about
duplication/proxy/differences between or among EDVMF and other mineral stocks.
Sorry now I sold CCJ when a key mine flooded last year: Looks like stock has
moved from roughly 37 mid March to now 46 pretty quickly following the
continuing price climb in uranium.

I hold a few shares of SIL. I have a decent size (for me) position in SU,

OT (somewhat) regarding WFC & Free trades

I did open my Welltrade account PMA checking combo with 100 free trades and so
far like it. Trading interface is basic but functional. They do not have a
quote streamer for example. I did not notice any executions problems with my
limit orders so far. Execution and speed seems fine for occasional traders. I
do like the fact that cash earns 4.6%+ regardless of balance in my brokerage
account. I peruse the brokerage account as a backup savings account for
checking (WFC PMA is my backup checking).

I also learned that I could open several brokerage accounts (IRA etc.) with
Wellstrade and get 100 free trades with each account as long as they are
attached to the PMA checking account. Furthermore the 100 free trades apply to
mutual funds as well.

It looks to me that banks get more like brokerages and brokerages more like
banks. E*Trade had just added a online savings as well as interest checking
accounts to their growing list of services as well. Not a bad thing to put
short term cash there considering the lousy interest rates E*trade is paying in
their regular brokerage account.

As we discussed before i do not think that free trades are the end of the
discount brokerage industry but i do think that trading commisions are bound to
come down as a consequence of offers from BAC, WFC or Zecco and this is great
for investors.

Paul, note that wrt EDVMF, management has stated more than once that their
intention is that it trade at a significant premium to NAV. While it may take
some time to achieve - especially given the tactics of the current mgmt -
that's my investment objective. And why I loaded up at significant lower price
than it currently is now, when the discount to NAV was even higher than it
currently is.

Although I am happy with the way EDVMF has performed short term, (as some of
you know its once again far and away my largest portfolio position) I
re-iterate that its more of an investment bank for natural resources than a
natural resources fund. I expect that the bulk of the money is made by
obtaining shares and warrants in start-ups at low prices and selling them once
they have reached a solid return on capital. Therefore there are times when EDV
may hold as much as 50% in cash and its quite possible that it could be at a
time when natural resources are skyrocketing. So EDV is just one of the natural
resource components of my portfolio- which include SIL, plg.to, DML.to and
other junior miners.

CHK went above $33 today and I took some profits, I hold a fair number of
longer term calls with a strike price of $35 so I feel that offers me some
flexibility. Since I owned in the money calls which expire in April I did not
want to take a chance on getting caught flat footed by a sudden decline.

I must commend richardred on stating 'for the record' that railroad stocks were

richardred has been trumpetting railroads on this thread and others since 2005.
He saw the turnaround in railroads early, and he saw the railroads new
comparative advantage over trucks for long distance hauling. Note: railroads
have the advantage in long distance hauling only. And since most of the USA
imports arrive into west coast ports and must be hauled as much as 3,500 miles
to the east, there is a lot of long distance hauling going on throughout the
the USA.

After going through years of unprofitability and neglect -- Neglect of their
physical plant and rolling stock. Neglect by the Wall Street investment
community. The railroads are profitable again. 'The last shall be first.'
richard is good counsel and very insightful on the changing long term trend of
the railroads.

Last night while watching the Nightly Business Report, I heard some Wall St guy
mimicking what richardred has been telling us for years - that RRs are making
money shipping low sulphur coal from the Powder River basin in Wyoming to
powerplants in the eastern USA. The Wall St guy was pushing Union Pacific
shares, while richardred only pushes us to think.

richardred was first, buffett's buying of Burlington Northern and other
railroads, was next.

There's a small dividend, and the p/e (forward) is okay, but no great

float (over $900M at cost). Apparently there's some competence there, and their

I'll up my position in very thinly-traded WNMLA. The stock's moved up to maybe
$4.6/sh. from the $3.76 where there were some buyers on the thread.

Stock still looks undervalued to me based on my sum-of-parts analysis.

Having some trouble deciphering BXL, of which WNMLA owns 25%. The only assets
in BXL seem to me to be $22.3M in net income ---cash. The total assets reported
are: "At December 31, 2006, we had positive working capital of $37,739,552,
total assets of $38,071,710, no long-term debt, and shareholders' equity of
$37,864,881." There's no business at BXL --it's a cash-in-search-of-a-business
play, so I am guessing in the equity of $37.739M there's lots of tax dollars
due to the gov't maybe April 16 from BXL's sale of the on-going business.
Anyway, I'm calculating WNMLA's share of this business as 25% of $22.3M cash,
which, given WNMLA's 1.54M sh. outstanding, is $3.62/sh. And then there are the
other WNMLA investments.

RAS: Looks like a good value play on some metrics I use.

Great profit margins. However, you pay for that because the p/sales ratio is
very high. 12% div. yield. Stock's near its three year or longer low. OTOH,
stock seems to be range-bound for the past few years. (So maybe it's the
dividend yield that the attraction.) Price/bk seems okay for a buy (at 1.17).
OTOH, the stock's traded on average in some years at below stated book value.

I don't understand the benefit to investors why the company would buy back 3M
of 63M shares outstanding, and use convertible notes to do it. Notes so far
from conversion that it won't be reflected in "fully diluted shares", so some
financial numbers will look better with the fewer listed outstanding shares? I
see where d/e is 8.7/1, according to Yahoo; perhaps that's okay, perhaps not.
D/e seems to have jumped up enormously in past year.

The thing of it is though, is how many professional value players are in this
stock, according to latest Yahoo. Assuming they're still in -- who knows what
they've done with the onset now of these subprime issues -- we have Marty
Whitman, Leon Cooperman, Munder, Excelsior Restructuring...some of the best of
the best. Assuming one or more of these folks has looked closely at what
they've bought (and are still in it), I'd say RAS might be a buy for someone
who wants to make a value bet where the outcome is not so clear unless you
really know what you own.

RAS is a complicated company. They deal with both commercial and residential
mortgages. They acquired a portfolio of residential mortgages when the merged
with Taberna and the plan was to securitize these mortgages over the next three
or four years.

The reason I bought the stock was because less than one percent of their
residential mortgages were sub-prime. The recent AHM announcement has brought
the price of RAS down because it indicates that the metrics behind the
securitization, the selling of CDOs, are in question. What also comes into
question is the quality of mortgages they are holding. The aggregate score for
portfolio is 730 with 80/20 debt to equity ratio. You really don't know what
percentage is Alt-A loans.

Is this stock another AHM waiting to happen? I don't think so because only half
of their business is on the residential side, and RAS recently raised their
dividend in March, not cut their dividend like AHM. But questions persist in
what the CDO market will look like going forward. The AHM announcement was not
good for the market.

AG Edwards comment on AHM a day or two ago...
The problem I have is if he doesnt think the dividend will fall further, then
ONLY a $23.50 target ? I think if they sustain a $2.80 dividend for the next
few years then the stock is going a lot higher than $23.50.

--------
AG Edwards analyst Greg Mason said the key to determining whether the stock has
fallen too far is predicting what the company will do with its dividend. After
paying a quarterly dividend of $1.12 last quarter, American Home Mortgage said
it will pay a dividend of 70 cents this quarter.

Considering the stock closed at $19.55 Tuesday, Mason said an annual dividend
of $2.80 is fat. A stock that yields a dividend of 14.3 percent is attractive,
he said.

"The question remains, can the dividend fall further?" he wrote in a client
note. "We believe the answer is no." He expects payment defaults to decline as
the company stops lending to riskier borrowers. He forecasts some profit
deterioration, but believes the $2.80 annual dividend will remain intact.

He upgraded the stock to "Buy" from "Hold." His price target on the stock is
$23.50.

What are the insiders saying with their money ? Are they buying hand over fist
?

Unless you believe that we have hit the trough in the housing cycle/bubble,
(and history would suggest otherwise) then I think mortgage lenders still have
a ways to go.

I'm still holding ASPV - lots of cash & great current earnings but one-product
company with generic competition looming on the horizon. Many former holders
got tired of waiting for the long-promised next in-licensing deal.

As a side note, I recently added to CAKE & CRYP. Also, holding VPHM (similar
issues as ASPV except more in-house devlopment activity), ANF (close to a sell

Welcome to the MHCO roach motel.

No reason to check out before a fair valuation.

Ive been "in" since 10/24/2000.

Current diluted book value is $7.77 and trailing 12 month EPS is 69 cents.

This year should be their 4th straight profitable year.

I expect that if we hang on long enough, the company will eventually be sold.
When is anyones guess.

Their headquarters is about 34 miles from my door.

The next annual report to shareholders should be out in the next month. (I got
last years on 5/11 and 05s on 5/19)

Their annual report is really just a page of commentary along with a page of
financial results & balance sheet signed by both the chairman and the president
but its the only direct communication we get other than the quarterly press
releases, none of which contain ANY commentary.

Both the chairman and president are up there in years. I believe the chairman
is about 76+ and the president 66+.

Book value took a little hit last quarter as they had to add to their pension
liabilities.

Here is the MHCO board. Not much posting.

AHM has had some insider buying. Not as much as Id like but there has been no
selling. Unlike CFC where insiders have been dumping hand over fist.

Insiders in LUM and TMA and NDE have been buying also.

The biggest issue is subprime with some spillover into alt-a. The question is
how much. (AHM, LUM, TMA & NDE dont own much subprime)

I really dont have an opinion on when the housing market might turn up. Just as
I didnt know when the internet bubble would pop.

But, there is a big difference between single family homes that people need to
live in and money losing internet stocks so I dont look for the average house
to lose 40% of its value in my lifetime.

NDE has had recent substantial insider buying at slightly higher prices.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=NDE

The stock is certainly controversial with very high short interest. But I'm
impressed with the insider purchases so I bought a small position yesterday.

Comments about NDE in last week's Barrons from the CIO of Al Frank Asset
Management

That's why we are staying with mid-cap player IndyMac Bancorp (NDE), a hybrid
thrift/mortgage banker and the seventh-largest U.S. savings and loan.
FDIC-insured deposits represent 42% of borrowings -- making its funding sources
far more diversified than all those bankrupt subprime lenders and mortgage
REITs that have relied on the big banks and Wall Street for financing.

The company maintains an investment-grade rating and had loan production in
2006 of $91.7 billion, a 48% increase over 2005. Perhaps most importantly,
subprime loans make up only 4% of overall loan production. The stock now has a
higher dividend yield (6.7%) than P/E ratio (6.2).

IBKR is a market maker, not an investor. They claim that the gains come from
trading volume not volatility or rising stock market. Assets under management,
revenues and earnings have been raising fast. As a customer i think their
offering is very competitive. So I believe they have a sustainable advantage

Peeled off some shares from CMCSA (Comcast- Recent threee-for-two Stock Split
in Feb 2007) and CVX (Chevron) and rolled the proceeds into COP (Conoco). COP
pays a slightly higher dividend than CVX. COP has a lower forward PE than CVX
(8.33 vs 10.52) and allows me to diversify my Integrated oil group. CVX is
trading at an all time high and represents a 2:1 weighting compared to my next
largest oil holding (XOM).

I think I will continue to move CVX money into COP over the next several
quarters. I like COP's domestic holdings specifically their natural gas
reserves and pipeline partnerships assets.

Over the last five years, these Integrated Oil companies have out performed the
S&P significantly. COP is the top performer during this period with XOM and CVX

Peeled off a few shares of my shipping finance company SFL. Stock continues to
pay an excellent dividend now at 7.6% but with the recent price appreciation
the forward PE is now 13.5 which is high for this sector.

My annualized capital gain is 35% and with the dividend tops 45%!
Here is a chart of the two shippers that are in my top ten holdings. Both have
exceeded the S&P 500 performance.

http://finance.yahoo.com/charts#chart3:symbol=sfl;range=5y;compare=drys+
^gspc;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;logscale=on;source=undefined

I have 30% of my shipping company's hedged with call options so I continue to
collect the dividend and protect my gains. This industry is cyclical and these
stocks can have roller coaster runs. DRY's is now up over 160% from my last buy
in June 2006.

If the call options are exercised in August and July, I will have reduced my
current holdings by 50%. It's difficult to know where the top is and my
favorite for a long term hold is SFL.

This sector has been one of the best performing groups I have been in since the
gold run in early 2000. It's time to book some profits and move on to some
other undervalued groups.

WON is one I continue to focus on as a value opportunity especially with todays

Funny you mentioned NDE, I posted this on the AHM board on yahoo this weekend.
Bad place to post however.

AHM, TMA, LUM & NDE Compare & contrast !

Each has had some level of insider buying. Each has an above money market yield

Presently, I only own a small position in AHM but am considering buying some of

I am not of the opinion that 25% of the good credit homeowners in America are

Hi Paul -

That's interesting about Gendell. He has a pretty good track record with his
picks. He is usually early to the party but generally leaves it with huge
gains.

Ever heard of Wabash National Corp. (WNC). It appears that Jeffrey Gendell has
been buying shares recently. Is this the same Jeffrey Gendell of Tontine
Partners? Gendell bought over 3 million shares in Nov 2006 and as of Feb 2007
owns 13% of the company.

I like the business (http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=WNC ) and the forward PE
of 14.1 seems to indicate that the company should begin to grow it's earnings
again. The free flow cash flow is positive and the current price is near it's
52 wk low of $12. Company is selling at 1.6x book.

Any opinion?

E K S, yes I used to follow WNC fairly closely. They have a unique trailer
design which is popular with their customers (truck fleets). Issues have been
the buying cycle of fleet managers and the long life of existing trailer
bodies. There may be foreign competition now too. (I don't know, I'm not
following the business anymore.)

Somewhere a few years ago I became convinced the stock was overvalued and I
took a short position. I seem to try a short every five years or so. Shorts
invariably don't work out for me, and this one didn't either. I may have been
right on my evaluation of the company, but I surely was wrong in my ability to
hold on to a losing WNC short position as stock rose and media gave favorable
reports of company prospects.

--------------------------------------

The trucking business can be cyclical, and as far as WNC stock, it doesn't look
to me to be cheap enough yet on a p/bk or p/sales basis. I'll leave this one to
Tontine (Jeffrey Gendell). That he is in it heavily is a positive. OTOH, he's
in a lot of stocks, many of which don't seem to move for a long period of time
(e.g. small regional/local banks), and with Mr. Gendell, I often am puzzled by
his buys. That would mean in the case of WNC, if I bought primarily because of
Mr. Gendell's purchase, there'd be a good chance I'd get shook out if the stock
should drop, or timed-out if nothing transpired after a year or so.

Fwiw, I still hold shares of trucking companies themselves. (ABFS CNW YRCW HTLD
R). Where fuel costs have become an issue (e.g. long haul carriers)the truckers
have been able to put a fuel surcharge to their customers, and if negotiated
properly, that can or should alleviate some of the fuel issue hit to earnings.

http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070417/venezuela_sidor.html?.v=1

If the gov't does this and then directs steel business to preferred customers,
that should drop profits of Sidor, imo. Maybe even cause losses. Losses that
will perhaps be shared by the gov't (in its controlling ownership) and the
reduced percentage ownership by TX.

I don't know what part Sidor makes up of TX steel companies, but TX seems
diversified in Mexico/South America. And controlling stakeholders (of TX)
appear to be pretty sharp.

I don't see TX stock - spiking down today - going up. Maybe dropping further as

and the stock is dirty cheap but Hugo can mess with it in ways I'm no longer

pull a chart of TX, the last two times the stock hit 30, there were news from
Venezuela of Hugo fiddling with TX... If TX grows (eg, merging with Usiminas)
then it would be less vulnerable to Vza, but for now, a good chunk of their
earnings come from Sidor. I see the stock trading at low 28 now. It may go

Grommit, et. al. The USA tax implications of these Canadian trusts vary, and I

For example, PGH. USA owners of this one get to claim (must claim?) a cost
depletion allowance and eventually when stock is sold, the cost basis must be
adjusted for that. That's like having to file a partnership K-1. And too much
work for me. In addition, I hold PGH in an IRA. If the income from PGH is
considered by the IRS same as K-1 stuff, in an IRA there's a limit ($1000) how
much K-1 income one can have before one falls into actually having to pay
taxes. As you may likely know... the UBTI thing.

Massive selling today. This is professional money (institutions) heading for

unusually finished in one day.

I now think Chavez may well have the blessing of Kirchner for this move. There
was a public disagreement between Rocca (TX majority owner) and the Economy
Minister of Argentina. This may well be Kirchner vendetta. He is known for
irrational, revengeful behavior.

I will run some numbers to see how much TX is worth without Sidor. It is a
complicated exercise. I think ~half of their profits come from Sidor. Then add
a multiple consistent with international steel valuations... and I think you
end up at low 20s. So the bottom may not be far off.

After all is done and said, it may be time to get back in at a value price

The problem in holding these trusts in an IRA is that the canadian withholding
of 15% is lost. So you lose 15% of the dividends to thin air. But if held in a
taxable account, that foreign tax withheld is a US tax credit.

HTE doing well, and the others are slowly following. AAV up a nice 4.5% today.

Late night reply: "The problem in holding these trusts in an IRA is that the
canadian withholding of 15% is lost. So you lose 15% of the dividends to thin
air. But if held in a taxable account, that foreign tax withheld is a US tax
credit."

For me, I've found that not to be true.

Regarding USA taxes, married filing jointly, and with under $600 dollars in
foreign taxes paid (to countries USA has agreements with like Canada, Brazil,
Spain, etc.), you have two ways to recoup: simple form/computer (Turbotax) to
claim the under $600 amount as an offset to Federal taxes, or else simply take
those tax credits as a deduction. (This latter not so good: a credit to taxes
is much better than a deduction.)

Now...same situation but the investor has OVER $600 in foreign taxes paid. Two
alternatives: the not-so-good one of taking the amount as a deduction. Very
simple again (just plop the amount on the designated line in the form) The
second: trying to take that over $600 amount as a credit to taxes. Now that
alternative is NOT simple or easy. You do not get the easy line fillout as with
the under $600 amount. You MUST fill out Form 1116. IT IS A BEAR! You enter
line items from worksheets and other referenced forms (e.g. on line 17: "Enter
the amount from line 1041 (minus any amount on Form 8914 line 6)" and then
this: "caution: If you figured your tax using the lower rates on qualified
dividends or capital gains, see page 16 of the instructions". You have to
figure capital gains or losses long-term vs. short-term for the foreign stocks
you might have sold. Or maybe it's for the USA stocks after subracting the
foreign stocks in each of these categories. (I can't tell.)

So here's what I did and found. I have over $1000 in foreign tax credits in
taxable accounts:

If I ask Turbotax to place the $1000+ amount as a deduction, it does it quickly
and easily. However, for the alternative choice,
TurboTax gives me this error when I ask it calculate the credit amount method:

"YOU MUST FIX THIS ERROR."
"Form 1116 (Copy 1)--Foreign Tax Credit Comp Wks: Adj. Basis Fgn Inv Assts
entered. Adj Basis Fgn Inv Assets...."

Well thank you very much. Impossible for me to understand what is asked for.

So I go to my tax accountant. He has a very good computer program. I say I have
a couple of problems (K-1's being one).
Here's all my tax info. and my records, I am befuddled about what to do, how to
do Form 1116. You figure it out. Run your program. See what you can do with
1116. He smiles, takes down pertinent info, collects my Sch D's. Two days later
I have my new Fed Tax forms done. Form 1116 completed. I get a tax credit of
$88 dollars. $88!!! Now that is less than the $600 I'd get if I only had $600
in foreign taxes paid. (And why didn't the computer allow/override the first
alternative? (a deduction for $1000+ is worth more to me than a credit of $88.)

Ah, so now I'm like the guy with two watches. He never knows the correct time.
I got two different 1040's from the two different computers.

Well, somebody is wrong somewhere.

Here's a possible point. Maybe for you Grommit - did you once say you were an
accountant/finance guy? -- you can get the max benefit of having these trusts
in a taxable account. For me, I'm suspicious that I can get what others
perceive as a simple credit ... based on my experience and situation. I have
these trusts in both taxable and non-taxable accounts. I'm willing to lose the
15% Canadian trusts taxes in non-taxable accounts if the dividends are high
enough. Almost worth it to me rather than having issues with the things in
taxable accounts.

----
Received an updated brokerage report Monday (filing day) which moved some 1099
dividend income to the non-taxable distribution box. Jeez I am not going to
like having to file amended returns. I want to start now on 2007
income/gains/losses/deductions. This is all so non-productive for me. grrrr.

aruze which hit a recent yesterday in japan has a new presentation on their web
site. Turns out the GS is purchasing their 9% stake in the company directly
from the majority holder and chairman so there will not be any dillution. Of
course the GS stake will add more credibility to the company which should help
it as it gets ready for the bidding proccess for a casino in Japan, which is
projected to permit casino gambling within 2 years. Unfortunately GS did not
pay me a finders fee.

I still have had nothing formal in the mail about khdh purchase offer for
sasamat, perhaps they are going to raise the offering price to some reasonable
amount in order to avoid wasting all those legal fees and trees.

DML.to announced it had been approved for listing on the amex, and the stock
sold off. go figure! Trading starts on Thursday.

I've added to my position in IMOS for the reasons I mentioned in my previous
post. The Carlyle group called off their purchase of ASE and the sector has
responded positively. Below is a link describing the book values of the sector.

http://www.forbes.com/markets/2007/04/18/ASE-carlyle-end-markets-equity-cx_jc_0
18markets1.html

IMOS trades at a striking discount to the group. Currently the stocks trades at
1.2 book value, yet is expected to grow 20% this year.

The company has a complicated corporate structure that they have simplified
with a purchase of a shared subsidiary. This purchase should add to earnings
this year. The Yahoo board has a very knowledgable group posting on the
company.

Going through all of his SEC 13G forms since this report, it appears that the
home builders, small regional banks and speciality steel companies make up most
of his recent buys. No one name popped out to me but I like his regional bank
theme.

Here is a list of some of the banks he acquired in 2007:

SUPERIOR BANCORP
PRINCETON NATIONAL BANCORP INC
HOPFED BANCORP INC
PROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC
1ST INDEPENDENCE FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MASSBANK CORP
FIRST FRANKLIN CORP
DOWNEY FINANCIAL CORP
EXCHANGE NATIONAL BANCSHARES INC
CAMCO FINANCIAL CORP

Do any stand out as exceptional "value" plays?
