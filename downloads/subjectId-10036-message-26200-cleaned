Two financings involving MFCAF Mass financial the KHDH spinoff:

Mass Financial Signs Letter of Intent to Extend Stonepath $20 Million Line of
Credit

SEATTLE, Feb. 12 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Stonepath Group (Amex: STG), a
global logistics services organization ("Stonepath"), today announced a new
strategic relationship with Mass Financial Corp. ("Mass Financial"), an
international merchant bank with diverse global business relationships, that
will provide the capital Stonepath needs to expand its business in Asia and
North America. Mass has purchased Stonepath's entire credit facility from
Laurus Master Fund, Ltd., to which Stonepath will issue 3.5 million shares of
STG common stock. As a result of this transaction, Stonepath's aggregate
indebtedness to Mass Financial was $4 million as of February 9, 2007.

Mass Financial and Stonepath have also executed a letter of intent whereby Mass
Financial will provide Stonepath with a $20 million revolving line of credit
("LOC"), subject to satisfaction of a number of normal conditions including
satisfactory completion of a due diligence review. The parties anticipate that
this new financing facility will be in place within the next 30 days. Under the
terms of the letter agreement, the credit line will be convertible into
Stonepath stock at a conversion price equivalent to 85% of its value, as
determined by a mutually agreed upon a third-party valuation.

Following completion of the financing transaction, Stonepath will pay a
transaction fee of $2.5 million, a Merchant Banking Fee of $1.2 million, and
all of Mass Financial's legal fees. In addition, Stonepath is also obliged to
pay Mass Financial a break-up fee of $750,000 if it enters into an alternative
financing transaction within the next three months. Stonepath will also grant a
right of first refusal to Mass for any additional financing requirements within
the next three years.

Based in Hong Kong, Mass Financial and its affiliated companies have global
investments in industrial and engineering services, merchant banking, investing
and trading activities.

"Mass Financial has given us the opportunity to restructure our debt, and will
grant us access to the capital we need to grow our business," stated Bob
Arovas, Chief Executive Officer. "We can now return our focus to expanding our
core business -- providing customer-focused logistics and transportation
services. The China and Southeast Asia markets provide the greatest
opportunities for growth, although we will certainly maintain or expand our
North American presence as well."

First Financial FF, in the last few years, has had distributions generated
almost entirely from long and short term capital gains. And entirely from
financial companies. This is hardly predictable income.

In 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000, they had no gains at all, either short or long
term (etfconnect), and their distributions were nominal to nil. Check the price
action of the stock in 1998 and 1999.

It strikes me that expecting continued high distributions from FF assumes that
they will continue to be able to generate capital gains from financial
companies. To me this strikes a note of caution. Your thoughts?

A "managed distribution" is not dependent on cap gains or dividends.

My hope...from a dividend reinvestment & dollar cost averaging viewpoint is
that they implement a 10% distribution paid monthly.

The fund automatically reinvests unless shareholders specifically asks for the
cash.

FF has shown annualized total returns to NAV of 21.66% for the 5 year
period,16.13% for the 10 year period and 19.48% since inception. (via
ETFCONNECT)

Predictable income comes as soon as they announce the managed distribution
policy. Then its value is as much a present value of future distributions as it
is on its performance.

I guess my point is that I bought this for my IRA and I expect to reinvest any
& all distributions and I hope that they can show a total return anywhere in
the 12-19% annually range going forward over the next 10 years or so. And if
10% gets reinvested along the way, thats fine with me. (More shares at lower
prices, less at higher prices)

The reason I expect high distributions is they have said...TWICE now that they
WANTED to implement a managed distribution policy. The SEC is becoming more
favorable to it of late.

Also, considering how old the fund is, I expect they have plenty of long term
gains yet to be "taken".

Bought some Wharf today in HK (0004.HK in yahoo) my first adventure buying
stocks in foreign exchanges using IB.

Wharf is an real estate operator and developer , and ownership in harbor
operations and in addition has some holding in public companies. my rational is
that it simply trades on a discount to NAV based on the latest numbers i could
find here:
http://www.wharfholdings.com/file/eng/present/060823%20WHL%20interim%20presenta
ion.pdf

Per management report, Wharf NAV is 38.35 HKD/share, so with the stock trading
at <27 HK, I calculate a discount to NAV of 30%. The last earnings report was
so so, partly because Wharf includes property revaluation in it's real estate
holding (they are valued market to market rather than historical cost) which
makes the earnings more volatile, although cash earnings are much more stable.
A 120 year operating history inspires some confidence and I see a fairly robust
balance sheet with debt around 25% or net assets. Despite the recent China
troubles, the HK economy should be doing OK and with a 30% discount i am
willing to take a small bet.

I like this company more so than the Cheung Kong. Wharf's business is more
steady and they do much less wheeling dealing.

vaccines as well as the best pipeline relative to their size, I think.

I also think their legislation issues are 95% behind them but sometimes it's he
last 5% that really hurts <g>, I admitt. LLY has some major issues with

Spekulatius, thanks again. Appreciate the analysis of Wharf. When I decided to
buy, it seemed late, the easy money already being made. OTOH, some of these
stocks were showing up on value screens and some were (and are still) being
bought by professional value players (Third Avenue funds). I suspect these
stocks' prices in the short term are reasonably correlated-- from what I'm
seeing they have all risen and indeed now are are all falling in sync.

Once again for me, rather than make a decision on which stock is "the best", I
am betting small amounts on a package of these things. And I'm guessing, it
being real estate, my timeframe for holding might have to be maybe five or more
years. (Right now, I'm just having a difficult enough time holding on through

It is not a matter of what was paid for the stock in the past. It's an issue of
what the stock is selling for now compared to its value. And what will happen
in future. So if th mindset is, "I'm losing money on this, what can I do to get
out of this and do better," I instead view it as, right now, GE is close enough
to a buy (about 1 to 2 points away from being a major buy), to buy it. So
rather than do nothing or wonder what to do to get out, stay in and ...BUY MORE
GE.

All only jmo. I could be wrong. VERY wrong. I have been many, many times.
And there are many who never ever average down. They are wrong of course, but

I dont like margin. It seems like a great idea 90% of the time, its the 10% of
the time that stinks can wipe you out. I think its contrary to value investing
because none of us can predict how the market will value something at a given
time and you have no control whether a company chooses to omit or reduce a
dividend or not. If I want to be levered Id much rather buy in the money calls
or buy a company thats leveraged. Perhaps I feel this way as I knew some
millionaires who went belly up in October '87, and we know that market
fluctuations dont follow a normal distribution. If anything I have been
thinking about whether i should always be fully invested or just 80% invested
except for special situations. I dont now that this is a value play but I am
nibbling at DML.TO. This is a uranium producer who has applied for an amex

SCMR close enough to cash value to be interesting, imo.

(Although interesting doesn't mean it's a buy -g-.)

I'll take a small amount now (@$3.66), intending to add more if SCMR drops
closer to, or below, cash value.

From 2/27 p.r.: "Sycamore (Nasdaq: SCMR - News) said its net cash and
investments increased $8 million to $915 million over the past three months."
Spread over 279M shares (If Yahoo is right...maybe not), that's about $3.28/sh.

So there's a cushion until maybe better times arrive for the business and/or
maybe there's a stock price rise.

look attractive - to me. Although I'm not privy to info about the major holder
and insider activities that are/were taking place that caused some
consternation.

Stock could still be a very risky play (more so than all the others, each of
which could also be risky). Or not. I'll keep BHO in mind; meanwhile searching
for others.

Here is a portfolio I put up mid-year, 2006 of shippers. I am sorry I wasn't
more serious about buying them. A lot of these shippers paid high dividends as
well. The sector was really in a fairly deep trough at the time and there was
concern about larger more efficient ships being built and over capacity, etc. I
was too slow to pull the trigger and missed what may have turned out to have
been a great opportunity.

I looked at many other shipping companies, but these were trading at lowest
ratios to book; paid high dividends and value managers had bought into the
companies.

Held my nose and bought a few more shares of WON (Westwood One). Reported
earnings earlier this week were bad (they wrote off over $5/share Goodwill) and
future growth is limited short term. Perhaps that's why it is selling at an all
time low.

I still think the company can expand their business to include Internet &
Mobile devise advertizing. However, this make take more time than current
investors are willing to wait.

It is interesting that the company booked their Goodwill loss this last
quarter. Maybe they are cleaning up their books for a sale and the new company
can utilize this loss as a tax loss carry forward.

Re Shipping Companies -

I own DRYS and SFL and they have done quite well and are probably fairly valued
now.

I have been watching NAT which is still 10% from it's recent high. Yahoo shows
that they yield 12%. It might be one to look into.

Looks like I overstayed my welcome at Laboratory Corp. of America:

Stock plummeted recently from $81 to $68+ today on word the company lost an
apparently big contract.

As I consider it now, the forward p/e of LH is much higher still (according to
Yahoo info.) than the p/e's of pharma and med. device makers that I'm currently
looking at, and the prospects of the latter seem somewhat better than the
propects for LH. I've closed my remaining LH shares today, and am considering
other alternatives (maybe even PFE again)

a couple of days ago one could have bought bought the preferred of imh and

Date:3/10/2007 9:09:47 PM
From:anializer
I've been trying to figure out why EDV.TO is so cheap and can't come up with a
good reason, other than possibly the following.

As of June 30, 2006 there were outstanding warrants and options that equated to
over 3.6 million shares with an average exercise price of $5.50 C.

As of December 31, 2006 there were only warrants and options outstanding
equating to 322K shares at an average exercise price of $2.88 C.

This leads me to believe that a great deal of options and warrants were
exercised and possibly a good chunk sold profitably by insiders and warrant
holders.

With an average daily volume of only about 73K shares since mid December, it
could be that these sales have been impacting the stock performance to some
degree.

The Co. bought back alot less shares than it issued in the recent period as
well. They buyback amount of shares represented only 17% of the total new
shares issued, so net net, more shares out.

Other than that, I see no reason for the seemingly large discount to NAV. If
you come up with any other logical information that might explain it, I'd be
interested.

From:Madharry
Reasons why EDV.to is cheap-

1 . Fidelity has been reducing their position.

2. The company occupies an unusual space-its not a mining company and it no
longer tells us what it invests in, so its not attractive to mining speculators
and investors who want the home run. Yet many other investors wont touch the
company because of the lack of disclosure as to portfolio, and infrequent and
untimely disclosure of nav. So that there is almost always a minimum 10 day gap
between the date of the NAV and the date the company publishes the NAV. Then
for the next 30 days that gap widens. One doesnt know what the portfolio
consists of nor does one know about how much cash was raised or quantity of new
investments until financials are released.

3. The company is not shareholder friendly. Last year after periodically
stating how undervalued their company was and how it should sell at a premium
to book, they tried to float a public offering which would have been at a big
discount to book. They realized the folly of their ways and pulled the offering
but it may have left a bad taste in investors mouths it certainly did in mine.
There is always the possibility that that they will try to float a new offering
at a discount to book. Also they had announced a significant buy-back program
for 2006 but ultimately bought back only 20,000 odd shares as you alluded too.
They have turned a cold shoulder to suggestions that post more frequent
information about their portfolio and their nav and refuse to obtain a US
listing as they dont want the Sarbanes Oxley expenses.

4. Its a canadian stock and has little or no institutional coverage, and is
fairly thinly traded.

5. Its possible that as the company grows in size they will have difficulty
doing enough new deals at attractive pricing, and that is key because the high
returns come from doing new deals and getting "free" warrants.

6. The Grand Cayman domicile may deter some investors.

7. There are likely conflicts of interest as there is a related separate
privately owned financial entitiy that also does investment banking and
arranges financing called Endeavour Financial.

Despite the above, the stock is underpriced, because I can see 10 years or so
of the company earning 20% + annual returns on average. This is a very
compelling investment for a buy and hold investor interested in long term
gains, who is not a mining expert but wants diversification in his/her
portfolio.

Many years ago on this thread I posted about a Brazilian financial entity
UNIBANCO that had dropped to $7.50 while its book value was $12. I racked my
brains trying to figure out why it was so cheap,but ultimately bought it around
that price and sold it around $16, when I read that the fund manager who had
originally touted it wrote that he had sold it as he found better investments.
Last time I checked it was in the $90s and selling for several multiples of
book. Perhaps history will repeat itself .

I check every stock mentioned here for suitability for me. I try to not let the
amount somebody buys influence me. However, zero amounts do influence me to
some extent. If somebody posts xyz is a great stock, but I find they themselves
are not buying it at current price, don't own the stock, have no intention of
buying the stock, then I tend to discount the opinion. This is one of the big
discouraging issues for me with Motley Fool, where the value writeups are
factual/informative/encouraging but where the writers RARELY actually own the
stocks they rave about. That is so tiresome.

OTOH though, I realize there are secretive people, college kids, retired people
, people with not much money here (and at Motley Fool) who have good stock
picks, so I want to be careful in dismissing anyone's ideas.
