<<if you are in a flood zone fannie mae requires that you take out flood
insurance>>That was certainly my impression...and more broadly, any hazard with
significant risk would be offset by insurance to satisfy the mortgage lender.
But when I heard that only 50% of homeowners had flood insurance...from
multiple sources, this looked like uncovered risk because way more than 50% of
homeowners have mortgages, IMO.
That said, I'm no longer considering the banks as shorts:
<<9/7/05 08:34 ET Hibernia Corp and COF renegotiate acquisition price (HIB)
31.40: HIB and Capital One (COF) announce they have renegotiated the purchase
price of COF's acquisition of HIB, which is now valued at approx $5.0 bln, and
represents a reduction in economic value of 9% relative to previous terms. Cos
now expect the transaction will close in 4Q05. "Hibernia will continue to
assess the expected impacts (of Katrina), including any expected near-term
impact to third quarter earnings".>>
The 9% Deal price adjustment on the COF-HIB merger disproves my hypothesis that
La. banks teeter on insovency due to bad loans - COF is a well informed buyer
with excellent access to the banks internal data. While a 9% haircut may
under-reflect the impact, it nevertheless indicates it's far from catastrophic.
I would sell these banks and FNM if I owned them, but they're not shorts unless
COF is as looney as those Vikings they use in their ads.

Looking in rear view mirror, I calculate by one method that DIIB 'should' trade
at a p/e of 12 (vs. about 8-9) and by another way that the top fair value price
might be about $36/sh. vs. $29.65 current.

Debt/eq. ratio looks a little high though. Points off for that. Also I'm not a

HSM seems like a reasonable buy here, 8% is a great yield and buying at a
discount is good. However, in the next few years HSM could likely cut its
dividend again as their leverage costs increase while long-term rates might
stay range bound.

Also, you have to be comfortable that long-term rates don't rise much from
here, otherwise you will see a hit to the NAV. The yield will go up in this
case, but unfortunately it will be because the NAV and Mkt price are going
down.

If you want decent yields (6-7%) and don't mind some credit exposure, you can
buy floating rate/senior loan funds at around 8% discounts. In this case, you
don't have interest rate risk, but you do have risk if the economy goes down
the tubes. Currently defaults on these portfolio are minimal, and they are less
credit exposed as say a pure high yield fund, but they will get hit in a
recession.

By the way, fed fund increases will help your dividend on the floating raters,
but will hurt your dividend on HSM.

MC
-------

I dont know anything about buying floating rate/senior loan funds. Where would
I begin my research ?

I figured HSMs insiders had a little better insight than I do with both their
portfolio and future interest rates or dividend cuts. So far, HSM is up 2%
since I bought and NAV was $14.28 yesterday and they kept this months dividend
steady at 9 cents.

Suma mentioned TMA and it has a nice yield, but I really dont like companies
that "tout" their insider buying. Plus, the stock is up a good bit from their
buy prices so Im going to pass for now.

I added some FSP on weakness today. Not sure why its down.

My hope is that after their first conference call in early Nov.. FSP will be
picked up by some firms and their buying will get the price up a buck or two.
So far, they havent had a conference call so they are "below the radar" I
believe.

MHCO,

I pared off some of my position today. Like the company, but some of my value
plays like GV have had great runs on speculators bidding the companies up. When
the volume surges, I view these as opportunities to pare off my positions.

In this case, I most likely am selling early (MHCO is still cheap), but an
illiquid OTC stock is going to almost always trade at a discount to the market,
and it gives me a chance to lock in some LT gains. I'll bid for it in case it
ever drops back down, but that may not happen.

MHCO.... you can never go broke taking a profit.

BUT....I think this one has further to go on the upside.

Its STILL trading below book value and with a low PE and Katrina was "the
perfect storm" for MHCOs future.

I see growing sales & earnings for a number of years for MHCO from the
rebuilding efforts.

And, I cant help but think there might be a time in the next few years where
the chairman looks for an exit strategy.
(Sale of the company ?)

Thats just a guess based on his age and the length of time he has been involved
with MHCO.

The stocks strength has been encouraging and it doesnt look like a pump & dump
or short lived rally to me.

I think the future fundamentals can justify a $10 pricetag and if they have a
"blowout" quarter,it could trade higher.

One of the lessons I have learned over the years is to not "eat like a bird and
sh*t like an elephant". So sometimes I let my profits ride even when they are
much greater than I originally anticipated.

virtually no losses net of recovery, resulting from most previous natural

do you know that the official "savings rate" doesn't take into account any
investment a person makes in a stock, bond, money market fund, IRA, etc? how
realistic do you think that is in today's world of 401-k's, employer matching,
roth IRA's, and the like? this probably makes most of this thread, including
paul, who owns almost every stock in existence <g>, a non saver..i would guess
most or all of them would disagree with that description, including you

there are various other quirks of the official system which don't make sense,
but this is the most glaring

there are lots of statistics that can be cited by roach, abelson, and the rest
of the permabears to tell us why we are headed for disaster, but of course they
have been doing this basically since time began, and they just continue to be
wrong, mainly because the statistics don't mean what they purport them to mean

it's never a bad idea to have some cash, for opportunities such as occurred the
day after katrina hit, but it's a much worse idea to let your asset allocation
be influenced by fear, especially fear inspired by people like roach and
abelson

at least understand the statistics they are citing, and why they are or are not
valid, before running for the exits based on the latest chicken little diatribe
from someone like roach

here's an article i bookmarked a while back, give it a once through and see if
it gives you any pause as you consider it against the abelson/roach info (note
that the article is from back in mid 2002, and the guy was off by a few months
on his short term assessment of the market and where it was headed, but his
ideas on the economy were right on...the underlying information he presents is
very insightful...i didn't read the article until much later, and of course the
market went lower before it rebounded, but that is due to the very fear
discussed above, rather than the fundamentals which prevailed at that time (see

OT: I don't know what negative savings rate means or what is meant by the US
consumer. If the consumer is not saving, does that mean I should assume the
consumer must be spending (consuming) more? Could investing (in stocks) be
classified differently from saving and spending?

If young families buy a house and spend to furnish it, that may be consumption,
but I look at it also as investing in living a life. Makes more sense to me
than putting away money in 3% yielding instruments.

I remember when the government in the '70's was encouraging people to buy E & H
bonds - save, save. Meanwhile fiscal/monetary policies or something were
causing interest rates to rise, and home prices were rising too. Imo, anybody
who bought and kept government bonds was a loser for it. Okay, it might have
been better than spending on a car, but if people listened to the government
(like I did), it turned out to be one dumb thing to do.

If anybody would ask me now if I save money as defined by putting money in bank
accounts, bonds, CD's, my answer would be I put as little money as possible
into these things.

difference "personal savings." ...>

Thanks for the article. I will read it. However, you can argue what the saving
rate doesn't include. But you can't deny the trend, and the historically the
trend has been down and is negative for the first time that I can remember.
What produces this result? High mortgage payments, high gas prices, and high
debt levels. Consumers who have been living off appreciating RE assets won't be
able to tap their "investment" anymore. This is a significant development, in
my opinion, when you compare it against a market that really has little value
left. Sure, there are special situations here and there, but most sectors would
not pass muster as value plays.

My point is to play this as a contrarian and raise cash. Cash, after all, does
have a value that few, in my opinion, recognize at this juncture in the market.
So, I am taking marbles off the table and can happily live with the

actually the trend is completely distorted by the facts i posted...as more and
more people have 401K's and roth ira's and employer matching, etc and etc,
their "savings" go more and more into these vehicles...as such, to know the
true trend, you have to know the total investment made each year into
everything that isn't counted in the official calculation...therefore, you have
no basis to conclude that the trend is actually to less saving...all you have
is doom and gloomers like roach telling you so, if you choose to believe their
repeated drivel

as you read the article, note further that capital gains don't figure into
personal income, which is used to calculate the savings rate...all of my income
is in the form of capital gains, so according to the government's savings
figures, i have a significant outflow of spending each year, since my income is
zero, and my outflow is whatever i spend...of course the truth is nearly the
polar opposite, as i spend far less than i make, and i reinvest the rest
(essentially save it)

there are nearly countless examples of "value" available at this point, read
dale baker's thread to find many listed there, and many others have been listed
here...those don't even begin to count what is out there to be had...some of

certainly true savings as defined has decreased.Money in the bank. Are 401k
plans, house mortgages, broker accounts. mutual funds, included as savings?

perhaps we need to take investments for the same period and combine them with
savings to determine if true savings or adjusted savings has increased.
somewhere we need to add inflation value of housing into those numbers.

forget about those who invest in hot markets. just expanded demand for housing
has significantly increased the average home price over the same period. i do
not think this is included in savings. sure there is a chance housing prices
will come down but unlikely to a decade ago prices.

Actually, I do read his thread and believe that there is more value outside the
U.S. The way I have played this is through purchasing indexes and ETFs. One
stock I am currently considering is EON, Germany's largest utility, which sells
at a much lower multiple than the average US utility. They have large
concentrations of nuclear and hydroelectric plants, which softens the impact of
energy prices.

I am currently forty percent in cash. Most of this I have raised in the third

The savings rate is just personal income minus spending: i.e., it is similar to
a company's "free cash flow". As such, it does count all sorts of investments
(since that's money that is not spent); but it does not count capital gains on
those investments as income. Free cash flow is a useful thing to measure.
Negative free cash flow is not a terrible thing if it is the result of
investments in things that will generate positive returns in the future, as
opposed to just taking on debt or selling assets.

I think the major risk of a negative savings rate is that current spending is
being financed by investment activities and debt, so economic growth is going
to be much more sensitive to changes in performance of those investments. Right
now that is working to our advantage due to positive feedback, and that may be
sustainable for a long time, but an external shock (energy prices?) might
change all that very abruptly.

to the best of my knowledge (and backed up by various articles, including the
one i posted), investments are not counted in the savings rate...if you can
cite a source that shows otherwise, please do

as for income, how can it make sense not to count capital gains as income? in a
case like mine, where i make my living from investing and trading, do i then
have no income? how do i pay my bills? by their measure, i would have a
substantial negative savings rate (it's a divide by zero error to figure the %,
but it would skew the total downward considerably when averaged with many
others who have earned income), but in fact i reinvest much of what i make

what about a real estate investor, who sells a piece of property one year and
makes 50K in capital gains, is that not income for him? add in venture
capitalists, futures and forex traders, even business owners who sell a
business after a period of time for a gain, none of these people are making
"real" income? sorry, that just doesn't hold water, it's like saying that money
just disappears from the economy because it was made from a capital gain rather
than a wage or salary

i'm sure there is tremendous value outside of the US markets if people know

our averages this year...there are numerous US stocks available at excellent

i own TAVIX because i figure those managers can find the value a lot more
successfully than i can, and i own some stocks that dale has found and a few
that i have found, in terms of international investments

that said, i have no trouble finding great ideas domestically, and i don't
share dale's pessimism over the US economy, so i am happy to keep buying those
stocks when the opportunities arise

there may come a time when the world economy can thrive without the US doing
well, but that time is not here yet...china has posted strong growth in recent

The savings rate is computed as after tax income minus consumption. Period.
They don't directly "count" investments of any kind: whether those are savings
accounts, 401(k), or whatever. However, all of these are "counted" in the sense
that if you are paid $100, and you only spend $90 of it, then the other $10 has
been saved somewhere.

The article you posted is simply wrong on this point, and misleading on several
other points. The article suggests that durable goods should be counted as
assets rather than spending. Maybe these should be depreciated, but how many
people do you know who sell their used cars for a profit? The article also
complains that pension income is not counted. That's true, but that's because
pension contributions are already counted as income.

It isn't perfect, but it isn't entirely meaningless either...

from your source:

 The definition of income used in the NIPAs excludes one important financial
resource that could be used for consumption expenditures. Capital gains are not
included in income in the NIPAs. 

so again, you're saying that i, or anyone like me who lives off of what are
classified as capital gains, has zero income?

even for a person who makes 10 or 20K a year in capital gains on the stocks
they own, this eliminates a substantial amount of their income in figuring what
they have "saved"

theoretically, i could have inherited 100K when i was 18 years old (just FYI i
have not inherited a cent in my lifetime, as my parents are very much alive
thank God), and through investing and trading, earned a living and grown that
money to the point where by age 65 i could have several million dollars, and
yet by these statistics, never "saved" a cent, or even earned a cent in my
adult life...multiply this by the significant number of people in our country
who have in fact inherited significant wealth, and lived off its produced
income, or who have started from basically zero and built investment incomes of
substantial size...each of these people is seen to earn zero by this system

further, for someone who puts money into an IRA, 401-K with matching, etc, that
money is not after tax income, so again, it is not counted in the
statistics...that money is "saved" for the future, but it does not show up in
the statistics...when i had a business, i contributed every year as soon as i
was financially able to a KEOGH and then a SEP IRA...those funds were fully
deductible, and thus never counted as after tax income...further, how about all
of the money i contributed to the social security system? that is "saved" as
well, as i will eventually receive benefits from that system (at least i still
expect i will, despite the system's foibles, though i certainly don't plan my
future based on such receipts)

JMHO, but based on all of its inefficiencies, i would have to say that the
statistical data is in fact meaningless, because how do you give any credence
to data compiled with such major flaws?

if i tell you that barry bonds hit 0 HR this year, and compare this year to
last, you'd say wow he had a huge dropoff in production...never mind that i
left out that he had an injury and has 0 AB...by year end he may have 40 AB and
5 HR, just think of the distortions you could make with that data <g> would you
then use those statistics and comparisons to make assumptions about his future
production or value as a player?

by the way, i will agree that buying a car or furniture should not count as
savings, i don't know how the author came up with that idea, but to me, buying
anything that depreciates is not saving

just as an aside, let me make it clear that i'm not hoping for people to start
"saving" more money, as defined by the flawed statistics

a dollar lent or spent into the economy multiplies itself many times in terms
of earnings to individuals and taxes paid to various governments, whereas a
dollar deposited into a savings account that is not then lent out by the
deposit holder does almost nothing for our economy...there is certainly no
shortage of funds available to lenders, so more simple bank deposits are not
necessary for our economy to do well

like it or not, our economy thrives because people are willing to spend money,
at times even beyond their means, and while you may think this puts our economy
on a tightrope, i would submit that the US people, who make up that economy,
are a lot more resilient than they are given credit for...sure some will file
bankruptcy, perhaps even due to circumstances beyond their control, but most
will find a way to pay their bills, even if it means taking on a second or
third job, borrowing from relatives, etc.

if everyone got cautious and started putting their money in banks or mattresses
rather than spending or investing it, our economy would suffer much greater
harm than a few personal bankruptcies or even a recession here and there could
ever cause

Another problem with the personal savings rate measure is that it counts
capital gains taxes, but not capital gains. Insofar as capital gains are
"income" (at least the IRS tells me they are), the savings rate is
underestimated.

Absolutely, yes, it excludes all capital gains. It includes contributions to
all forms of savings: whether in savings accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds,
IRAs, 401(k)s, pensions, etc. The income calculation is not based on after tax
income in the sense used by the IRS; they subtract taxes, but they also add in
pre-tax retirement account contributions, including employer matches and
contributions to pension funds made by your employer on your behalf. They do
say that in the articles I cited.

The FAQ on the BEA page does briefly discuss the capital gains issue and it is
a complicated one. I think their choice is a reasonable one though it means
that the statistics need to be interpreted with caution. If you're evaluating a
company's income statement, I think it is quite normal to be interested in free
cash flow, as a measure of the health of the underlying business, separated
from investment gains.

Add in all the payments made to reduce mortgage or auto debt. YOu can save up
to buy a house or you can buy first and save up later by getting a mortgage. so
mortgage payments [on principal, not the interest part] should also be
considered as saving!

Also note that with zero saving an economy can grow as fast as the gains in
productivity. As capital consumption allowances [accumulated depreciation] are
reinvested in improved more productive equipment!

And corporate profits are invested: have they ben counted as saving?

I think whether it is screwed up or not depends entirely on what you are trying
to measure and how you want to use the number. The savings rate is not an
attempt to capture the rate of change of people's net worth. It is only trying
to capture the difference between their current economic output and what they
are spending.

Housing equity appreciation is a weird thing and it isn't obvious to me how it
should be counted. What you say is true, but the inflation in housing prices
does not represent the creation of any new tangible value. That's different
even from other kinds of capital gains; if I own stock in a growing company,
the company can be more productive when I sell it, and I'm helping to finance
that growth. Sitting in my house and watching it appreciate, I'm not even
indirectly contributing to new economic activity. I'm just counting on someone
else being willing to pay even more for the same old house.

i guess we have to agree to disagree on whether it is reasonable to exclude
capital gains

they state that in a year such as 2002, including the massive capital losses
experienced by individuals would skew the results to the negative...not only
does this demonstrate how flawed the overall system of calculation is, what
about all the years capital gains have been positive, especially such years as
1999 and 2000, where they were outlandishly high?

if you were assessing a company that continually reinvested its profits and
made more gains from that money, so that over time they had a consistent record
of gains that significantly benefited their bottom line results, wouldn't you
at some point decide that you would have to include those gains in the
evaluation of their prospects?

to cite somewhat of a real time example, look at a company like BSC...their
trading gains are consolidated into their profits, but they are still capital
gains in the sense that my or your trading would be capital gains...do you back
out those gains in assessing their prospects, or do you realize that over time
they make profits at such trading, so it is reasonable to consider that an
ongoing source of income?

it is the same way with overall capital gains, various individuals may make or
lose money, but over time, the stock market assets of this country and others
appreciate, as does real estate, providing significant income to US
residents...excluding same just doesn't make sense

there are so many variables, as seen by these various posts, it shows that all
of this concern over a single statistic, erroneously calculated IMHO, is
irrational

the discussion started with reference to stephen roach, and his continuous
opinion that the US is headed for trouble due to lack of saving, exporting
jobs, the budget deficit, the trade deficit, the strong dollar, the weak
dollar, higher energy costs, lower energy costs (if that ever happens again (it
will)), the moon cycles, the imminent alien attack, whatever he can think of
<g>

the point when all is said and done is that so many things should be considered
in assessing when and how to invest, one of the absolute least of which is the
opinion of someone like roach, who is always negative...in the same way the
opinion of someone like battipaglia or cohen should be ignored, as they are
always bullish

strong companies/stocks purchased at favorable prices will always pay off in
the long run, if that stops being true, we will have a much more significant
problem than an increased cash position in your brokerage account will
solve...all this psychobabble from the "chief economist" of various firms, and
there are seemingly more of them than humans these days <g>, serves no purpose

schzammm. OT: Katrina plays. Thanks for those ideas. These stocks all look
pretty expensive to me. (I'm looking at Jacobs (JEC) as well as ITT and GVA.) I
assume these are well-known likely beneficiaries, and the stocks have now been
bid up. The dilemma is that if it's pretty assured that these companies will
indeed be beneficiaries of government or private spending, then earnings going
out several years should be very good, and the stocks just may continue to rise
from their highs now as those good earnings and backlogs are reported and
investors become comfortable of the certainty of the good times for these
companies.

I've taken a chance with a very small bet on RELM.ob. Looks like a small,
profitable company that may or may not benefit from Katrina rebuilding. My
preference is for these small, obscure, ancillary plays about which it's much
more iffy if they will win government orders, but maybe - maybe - if they get
them, it will help their bottom line and stock prices - and much more than that

2002, neither Berkshire nor I had ever traded in currencies. But the evidence
grows that our trade policies
will put unremitting pressure on the dollar for many years to come – so since
2002 we’ve heeded that

i was told that last year the company did around 3 million in business and
squeeked out a little profit (around 40k). when the CEO told me this he made it
sound like that is nothing to brag about --- but since so many of these little
companies are losing money --- i think a profit of 40k is outstanding - esp
when the company has less than 3 millions shares of stock.

since the share structure hasnt changed since the deregistration the company

[EXCERPTS] Bud Scott, operations chief for emergency housing at FEMA's
Washington, D.C., office, was in town Monday to discuss the program as RV
trailers and mobile homes poured in to LSAAP and RRAD.

"What you're seeing here is a continuing operation to support victims," Scott
said about meeting the long-term housing need for Hurricane Katrina evacuees.

Officials expect thousands of mobile homes and RV trailers to come in and out
of Lone Star and Red River.

"A total of 25,000 will pass through these two facilities," Scott said.

Eventually, work orders will be sent to facilities like Lone Star and Red River
to ship housing units where they are needed.

Scott said there are additional storage and distribution points in Alabama,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida.

"We will be shipping and receiving here for quite some time," he said.

Scott said many people will go straight into mobile homes and he believes FEMA
could supply as many as a half-million homes, a cost he estimated could perhaps
reach a billion dollars.

"It will be measured in the hundreds of millions," Scott said, adding that some
mobile homes and RV trailers could remain here for local evacuees who are
unable to return to areas such as New Orleans.

[EXCERPTS] The government is beginning what urban planners are calling the
single biggest burst of federal housing development in U.S. history. Last year
in Florida, the Federal Emergency Management Agency set a record by installing
15,000 homes in the aftermath of four hurricanes there. In the wake of Katrina,
they hope to open 30,000 homes every two weeks, reaching 300,000 within months.

At four giant staging areas across the region, FEMA is assembling tens of
thousands of mobile homes and trailers. In Baton Rouge alone, at a former
Defense Department logistics center, thousands of them are already lined up as
far as the eye can see.

So many new homes are needed that small-scale developments of 50 or 100 homes
will simply not suffice. FEMA is thinking like the old-time Soviet planners,
mapping out new towns that in some cases will have as many as 25,000 mobile
homes, spread across hundreds of acres.

More than 25 so-called strike teams are deployed across Louisiana, scouting out
possible sites for these new boomtowns, negotiating with local officials and
attempting to draft leases or sales agreements for farmland or campsites.

To meet FEMA's needs, factories are churning out the trailers and mobile homes
at capacity. The agency is also buying up homes from sales lots and warehouses
across the country.
................
FLE went from 10.60 to 15.50 on the Florida Hurricane news last year. FEMA
bought a total of 15,000 MH/RV's for that. A tiny fraction of what FEMA is
buying for Katrina.

forget trying to understand it. you cant. because often there is just
absolutely no correlation between the stock price that is reflected and the
actual value of the company.

take for example CFCO:

not long ago the company issued a "going private" statement followed by a
2000/1 reverse split. yeah, they have some real estate holdings and it looks
like they are going to make some $$$ so i suspect they dont want to share the
wealth.

bastards!

anyway -- the stock has a bid of $1.01 and THE LAST TRADE PRINTED AT $240.00 on
a split adjusted basis.

actually there were two trades after that that they didnt print.

ONE - the mms gave me 20 shares at $15.00 -- which i'm sure was a mistake --
but they didnt balk.

then --- then they filled an order i had for shares at the presplit price of 15
cents and gave me 5000 shares! YES, 5K SHARES.... BUT NOT PRESPLIT POSTSPLIT
...LOL. I CALLED MY BROKER TO MAKE SURE THE SHARES HAD THE NEW CUSIP --- AND
THEY DID

unfortunately --- they figured out that they screwed up so they called back the
shares and declared my trade invalid. no biggy - except i couldnt trade for
awhile because they were showing my account short 1.2 million dollars (5k
shares at $240.00)

here is my point. if you happen to get a fill on CFCO at 1.05 for shares ---
ITS A FRIGGIN STEAL!!! cuz they only have 15,000 shares outstanding. that would
put the market cap at --- easy math ---- $15,000 ....lol

now their last filing shows stockholder equity of 1,928,098 or $128.00 per
share.

so --- MARKET CAP AT BID = APPROX $15,000
BOOK VALUE PER LAST REPORT = $1,928,098

David, their last SEC filing was MAy 6 2005

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/915636/000101905605000538/capitol_q.txt

i dont think they have a website

if you look at the SEC filings you will see land on the books. i think the
value of the land far exceeds the amount stated in the financial statements...
which is often the case. and as is often the case, i think they were on the
cusp of unlocking some of the value in the company and the greedy bastards
running it dont want to spread the rewards.

ive seen this scenario more than once.

but hey - whadaya expect from a boca rotan company anwyay - honesty?

the whole purpose of the market is to spread out the risk/reward. i dont like
it when folks who have used the public to take the risk suddenly backpeddle to
hoard the rewards. unfortunately - people can be GREEDY.

WMT - Buying opportunity tomorrow as S&P completes rebalancing to 'free float'
vs market cap weightings. Since Walton heirs have about a third of the shares,
this will get hit. CNBC reported 20% of the shares will be sold by indexers.

I am still holding on to the penny stock you've posted here that I then bought.
That'd be RMMI.ob.

Also I'm holding thousands of shares of IDUL.pk (It feels great to write
'thousands of shares'..... even if the thing does trade at about six cents a
share - lol.)

I also have a few below-cash plays where the company's burned through a lot of
the cash and the stock has gone further down (putting me in the red). HETC.pk,
TSCC, INFO.

I've also got a couple more that people have given me plus a few stuck in my
accounts that are the worthless (fractions of a penny) remains of stocks that I
owned that went bankrupt.

MHCO,

Newsletters (especially ones with heavy hype) are often contrarian indicators
for me --- you get short-term buying pressure involving a bunch of weak and
clueless holders of the stock. This certainly should increase the volatility of
the stock and lead to more trading opportunities.

However, that being said --- a cheap stock with a positive catalyst is a good
thing.

MHCO <<a cheap stock with a positive catalyst is a good thing.>>It's important
to understand why it's cheap. The independent hardware distribution business
has been crushed by competition from all sides. Hardware stores have joined
coop's like ACE that give them superior buying power. Big box retailers like HD
and Lowe's have taken share from the 'Mom & pop's' that are customers of
distributors like MHCO. Most of these independent distributors have gone out of
business or are hanging on by they're finger tips. While this may work as a
trade if you can guess when the 'storm surge' has been fully discounted, don't
have any illusion that this is a good industry to invest in.

Started FONR yesterday @1.04. While the CT-Scan center business has
imploded[They don't do CT], the MRI-Scan business...which is what these guy's
do, is going well[CT has radiation risk, MRI doesn't]. Top line CAGR >30% over
prior 3 years. They've got a solid balance sheet and if growth continues should
hit profitability soon. The stocks been in a decline but is approaching an area
of support around 1.02 from which it has bounced substantially before. That
said, there's plenty of warts: Self-serving management, stock dilution...take a
very skeptical look at this one...it's very likely a mistake for me, but my
plan is to bail if it drops below 1.00 which indicates my technical thesis is
wrong. If I'm right on the bounce, the risk-reward would be favorable as I can
see 50% upside with a bounce reflecting the positive top line growth. A wild
card possibility is a buyout by GE which is a leader in MRI and lost a patent
suit to these guys. I think GE actually distributes their product - primarily
stand-up [vs lay-down]MRI units. The yahoo message board is full of loonies and
touts, always a bad sign, but there are a few intelligent skeptics, too.

The fact that many of MHCOs competitors have went under is a postive for MHCO.

The big boxes are WAY OLD NEWS.

Katrina isnt a flash in the pan. It will make a meaningful impact on their
sales & earnings for many years to come.

As for the newsletter "tout", I dont usually like that kind of thing, but in
this case, I happen to agree with many of his conclusions. (In fact, I wonder
if he hasnt been reading my posts over the last 5 years)

MHCO has been a big winner for me but I think further gains are likely in the
years ahead such that Im not willing to risk selling out of my entire position
and then not being able to get back in. (Its a pinksheeter with wide spreads)

The chairman may well realize that Katrina is a "perfect storm" for MHCO and
his eventual liquidity event.

I expect even a financial buyer might pay $10-12 in a few years.

SPOR had a blowout quarter suprising the heck out of me.

Just again proves that with value stocks, even mistakes can turn out ok.

Sport-Haley, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter Unaudited Results
Friday September 16, 12:14 pm ET

DENVER, CO--(MARKET WIRE)--Sep 16, 2005 -- Sport-Haley, Inc. (NasdaqNM:SPOR -
News) (the "Company") today announced results of operations for the fourth
quarter of its 2005 fiscal year. The Company reported net income of $587,000
for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, or $0.23 per
share, as compared with a loss of ($1,659,000), or ($0.55) per share, in the
fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year.

For the quarter ended June 30, 2005, net sales increased by 10%, or $656,000,
to $7,016,000 from $6,360,000 in the same period in the prior fiscal year.
Gross profit increased by 56%, or $899,000, to $2,492,000 from $1,593,000,
while other operating costs decreased approximately 12%, or $264,000, from
$2,237,000 in the comparable prior year period to $1,973,000. Income (loss)
from operations reflected an improvement of $1,163,000, or 181%, from a loss
from operations in the prior fiscal year's fourth quarter of ($644,000) to
income from operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 of $519,000.

Commenting on the results of operations, Donald W. Jewell, Interim Chief
Executive Officer, stated, "We're very pleased with the results of our fourth
quarter. Our income from operations for the quarter is certainly reflective of
the dedication our management team has to return this company to profitability.
We've believed for a long time that our Sport Haley(TM) and Ben Hogan&#174;
collections represent some of the best golf apparel available, but it's been a
long time since we last generated income from operations. We've worked
diligently in the last several months, making difficult decisions along the
way, to ensure the long-term financial health of the Company."

"We intend to continue in our efforts to further improve our operations,"
continued Mr. Jewell. "We have significantly improved our inventory position to
now bring it more in line with our expectations, and we also made significant
reductions within our operating costs. Our plans include continuing to focus
our efforts to find additional ways to decrease our operating costs and to
complete our search for sensible strategic alternatives that could improve our
core business. However, we believe that the success we achieved during our
fourth quarter certainly indicates that we are on track with the changes we
have implemented to date."

Sport-Haley, Inc. designs, purchases, contracts for the manufacture of and
markets women's and men's fashion golf apparel and outerwear under the SPORT
HALEY(TM) and Ben Hogan&#174; labels. Our fashion golf apparel collections,
known for their innovative designs, quality fabrics, generous fits and classic
styles, are primarily marketed in the premium and mid-priced markets, through a
network of independent sales representatives and distributors, to golf
professional shops, country clubs, resorts and exclusive department stores
within the United States and by certain distributors within international
markets. The Company distributes Ben Hogan&#174; apparel pursuant to a
licensing agreement with Callaway Golf Company.

<<The fact that many of MHCOs competitors have went under is a postive for
MHCO.>>I didn't mean that their 'competitors' have gone out of business, I
meant comparables - similar independent hardware distributors are out of
business or hurting badly - find one that's thriving... Higher fixed costs,
lower efficiency and a shrinking customer base have done them in.
<<The big boxes are WAY OLD NEWS.>>They're not new, but they continue to
dominate hardware retailing. ...and nearly all the decent hardware stores
belong to coops from which they buy the majority of their merchendise...because
they own their own distributors...this is also very old news, but it's a fact
of life.
Katrina has and will lift all boats, but in the future as in the past, the
dominant, most efficient value chains will win. MHCO is not and will not be
part of that value chain, IMO.
Good luck on your trade.

I'm surprised WMT hasn't dropped further. Based on this excerpt, "The retailer
will fall to 1 percent of the index's value from 1.3 percent, according to bear
stearns, and the resulting outflows of $3.5 billion will be the highest for any
s&p 500 company" I calculated 79.4mm shares should change hands
today[3.5B/44.1]. So far, @3:22et ~33mm have, leaving 46mm to transact. There's
probably something I'm missing related to the fact that the big guys have known
this was coming for quite awhile and the shares have largely come to discount
the rebalance. The indexers have developed strategies that I don't understand
to prevent a huge one day hit.

Bob -

The talking heads often mention such "unwinding" happening over a period of
several days, not just over one day in the week. WMT will trade 4 times avg.
daily today, so there has to be a good deal of index related selling going on.
Volume has been building throughout the week, every day except Mon. has been
over the avg. daily mark.
