Asset managers:
I cut WPL by 1/2 today. I've got HNNA which I bought last summer as a
speculation. (It didn't not fit my buying metric.) That one has turned out
wrong for me, and I may reduce/eliminate it as also WPL.

I like Crossy's (Bosco and Crossy thread) pick of JVN.V. I recently added to my
few shares.

I have been a buyer in recent days of COFUF. I do like that one for its
capitalization/aum number, its relatively low (about 13) p/e, its small
dividend, and its relative obscurity. (which is also a negative: The stock is
very thinly-traded).

Still have also LM, which I view as a buy at current price. Also, fwiw, I'm
holding DHIL, GROW, and SMHG.

Madharry, I'm with Grommit. I'm holding PWE longer. (Although for me, with
these shares, they're in an ira, and so there's no long-term vs. short-term tax
issue.)

Looking through my oil/gas stocks, the Russians OGZPY and LUKOY aren't doing
that great. I'll likely add a bit to my OGZPY holdings tomorrow. I assume the
low p/e compared to international competitors is due to the perceived risk one
takes when one deals with Russian stocks/Russian business practices/Russian
gov't, etc. One of these things where I bet small that I'll be okay as long as
the risk is just a perception: if 'perceived' turns into an actuality /actual
event though, the stocks could/will sink.

If you're a McDep fan from PWE, you might consider Gazprom or Lukoil since they
are apparently strong buy recommendations now from Mr. Wulff.

MPEL, yes, I agree might be an entry point. Start up issues in Macau will be
overcome I assume, bwdik: I was positive on the stock at higher prices, and I
seem to be wrong (with the lower market cap now).

I sort of expect companies like this ---where there's big potential a couple of
years out but where currently, there's no or little revenue or media attention
to confirm the possibilities--- to have the stock price drop quite a bit on any
news or no news, until there's earnings/rev. gains to prop up the stock.

I may add more to my MPEL position here.

Grommit - you may want to check out some of the posts on TRGL on this thread.
With a K did a nice summary

As to your question about whats the point of buying turkish gas when there are
what you term equal or better US NG opportunities, to each his own as I am not
out to convince anyone. But since you asked, my rational is smaller E&P's that
focus more on activity outside the US are typically more undiscovered, and thus
have more hidden value / potential. Perhaps not value in the traditional sense
but more potential than a well know player like a CHK. Now don't get me wrong,
nothing wrong with CHK. I own it now and have owned it off and on the last
several years. For me, there is a place in my portfolio for both type of
opportunities.

Now, let me ask you something - what NG companies who produce here in the US do
you see as strong opportunities (ie the ones you would refer to as equal or
better). Just curious as I am a long term energy bull (although I do swing
trade out from time to time especially in my rollover IRAs)

the end of the second quarter when some funds might be selling. Some have

Real Money's headline declares to sell the drugs and buy the drillers.

Today I bought Amgen at a price of 53.85 As much as the stock has fallen, the
estimates for 07 have held up, making the PE very attractive. I also think the
real hidden value to the stock is its purchase of Abgenix, which along with
Mederex, co-owns the patents to the mouse that can produce human antibodies.
From personal experience, I have been told by oncologists that biologics are
the future for treating cancer and antibodies will play a large role. This
isn't something that is in the future. It is happening now. Erbitux, Imclone's
antibody, is made from murine (mouse) antibodies, and there are certain side
effects that come with this EGFR. Amgen's Vectibix is a fully humanized EGFR
and slide 21 of AMGN's most recent conference call shows its increase in market
share vs. Erbitux. Vectibix had a setback in its combination trial with Avastin
(see slide 35) but I am confident that Abgenix will provide Amgen with years of
growth, and Amgen currently has substantial cash flow to fund the trials.

Hi Paul - Regarding ELP, I just looked at what Yahoo posted. Below is
information links I found from their Web site.

From their Company Web Site: Try this link for company Key Financial Ratios:
http://www.mzdp.com.br/mzcustomer/copel/tmp/en/?tipo=8

This is the link for their Q1 2007 results:
http://www.copel.com/pagcopel.nsf/arquivos/elp107_ing/$FILE/ELP%201Q2007%20ing.
df

How do you value such a company? Their power generation contracts are regulated
but their other business segments seem to be outside this regulatory authority.

Here is a list of their other businesses:
http://www.copel.com/pagcopel.nsf/docs/EB521B2B1154C186032571C00060D437?OpenDoc
ment
From their Web site:"... the Company started to diversify its operations; it
currently runs a telecommunications business, in addition to holding interests
in other companies operating in such areas as power generation and power
marketing, piped gas, sanitation, fixed and mobile telephone services, internet
service providers, power and infrastructure projects, research and development,
power and project management, and agribusiness.

Financial Highlights Q1 2007 vs Q1 2006

Annual Net Operating Revenues: R$ 1,246 million in the 1Q07, 6.4% higher than
the figure reported in the same period of the previous year.

Operating Income: R$ 439 million – an increase of 60.5% compared to the R$ 273
million recorded in the 1Q06.

Net Income: R$ 283 million (R$ 1.03 per thousand shares), 65.8% higher than the
net income for the first quarter of 2006 (R$ 171 million).

EBITDA: R$ 571 million, 50.6% higher than in the 1Q06 (R$ 379 million).
Excluding the effect of the reversal, EBITDA would have totaled R$ 479 million.

Return on Equity: 4.2%. Excluding the reversal effects, ROE would have been
3.3%.

=========================================================

What's your take? On the link I posted for their key financial ratios be sure
you select the correct currency selection. They seem to make the most sense
when looked at in terms of the "Real".

I suspect that there could also be a currency exchange kicker to this
investment too.

Started a small starter position in ELP. I took some of the proceeds from my
SWWC (Southwest Water Co.) sale and bought ELP shares. This is in the IRA
portfolio and I believe ELP will complement my long term utility holdings,
provide an international play and perhaps even return a small growth kicker.

My plan is to eventually hold equal shares in SWWC and ELP but need SWWC to get
back to it's old highs so I can complete the proper allocation. 2% of the IRA
portfolio is invested in utility type stocks. I consider this allotment part of
my fixed income portion. Another 7% of the IRA is invested in U.S. Gov. strips

Geez, it's a buy, kenneth weiss.

Well, just imo of course.

If you can buy these things at less than 2% of aum, you have got a deal. Again,
imo. (Some caveats: equity assets managers are worth more than bond/money
market asset managers)

Aum =5.1B. 2%aum=100M. Stock market capitalization = 60.2M
(equity 5.1B;fixed income aum =.2B)

One concern is that aum have decreased since '04; 6.7, 6.0, 5.3, 5.1.

http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/19/193288/InvPres1Q07.pdf

Dang, I'm disappointed to see this in the sense I believed almost all asset
managers are selling over 2%aum and it was rare to see one even close to 2%.
Are there more publicly traded managers that trade like this (~2%)? I know now
of this one only. I do not understand how/why HBRF trades at its apparently (to
me) low level below 2%. (Aside: I'm using 2% as the point where such companies
are appealing as takeover targets. The margin of safety I hope I am seeing.
OTOH, stock prices can fluctuate and can trade at 5% aum, 2% aum, 1% aum. And
if market crashes, these asset managers might find themselves real pariahs.)

Unless there's somebody here with a cautionary remark about HBRF that offsets
my general 2% rule, I will start a position in HBRF.

Refiners.

For me, in this particular sector, what I am doing is a function of where I
have been. That is, as regards TSO, I've been in since here (and subsequently
with adds):

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=17525703&srchtxt=tso

so at some point, even ignoring prudence, my nerves force me to consider
position size. I've started to trim TSO at $125 a little, and will likely cut
more if it goes over that again. I've been cutting back on HOC for similar
reasons, esp. as it has the highest of the p/e's.

On your list: I missed in not buying WNR, and I've been really really wrong on
MRO (now at $119, with me selling around $25-$30 if I remember, and even
worse... never reacquiring shares on MRO's rise). I sold GI at WNR buyout
offer. (And I was wrong not to have deployed funds into WNR at that time). I
continue to hold exploratory amounts of DK, HES, ALJ, FTO SUN - all of which I
coulda/shouda/but din't add to. :<(

My favorite is VLO. It is the biggest (I believe) of the independent refiners;
it has the lowest p/e of the independents; it is the one I'm most familiar and
most comfortable with. Were I to add, this is the one I would pick.

OTOH... I don't claim to be right. Evaluating refiners so simplicistically by
p/e is only my way, presumably not the way real analysts look at it. Also my
history is that there's no real correlation between my good comfort level with
a stock and any good performance subsequently of the stock. (I.e. being
comfortable with a stock, for me, might not only be a drawback, but also can be
downright dangerous.) Also, as regards VLO as a relative pick among several in
its sector, my general opinion on relative investing is that it is very, very
dangerous.

Analysts are saying momentum players have entered the sector, with VLO being
the prime mention. Some analysts I have heard recommend getting out of VLO now
as they foresee lower crack spreads or these crack spreads, even if they hold,
as not having the driving impact on the stock given the stock as high as it is.
On the SI VLO thread, at least a couple of the people who follow/analyze VLO
and maybe other refiners, are cutting or closing positions. I continue to hold
all shares.

All jmo, although of course, I've been wrong many, many times.

** The FTC may not let that WNR/GI deal close....that was the last I heard. If
that's the case GI probably has some catching up to do.

ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico, May 11 (Reuters) - Attorneys for Western Refining Inc.
(WNR.N: Quote, Profile , Research), Giant Industries (GI.N: Quote, Profile ,
Research) and the Federal Trade Commission on Friday wrapped up a hearing on
the FTC's bid to block Western's acquisition of Giant on antitrust grounds,
with no indication from the judge whether he would grant the agency's request
for a preliminary injunction against the deal.

The companies and the agency completed their final arguments in the case, which
center on charges by the FTC that the companies' proposed merger would be
anti-competitive and reduce competition for the supply of gasoline, diesel fuel
and jet fuel in northern New Mexico. U.S. District Judge James Browning said he
would make his decision by the end of the month.

The FTC last month got a temporary restraining order against the merger. FTC
attorneys contend that Western might divert gasoline away from the Albuquerque
area to more profitable markets, which would drive up prices.

Attorneys for Western and Giant argued that if the merger affected gas
supplies, other companies could easily increase their sales in Albuquerque,
stabilizing prices.

But FTC attorney Thomas Lang said that one oil industry expert estimated that
it could cost Albuquerque drivers another $25 million per year for gas if the
merger goes through.

Western and Giant have said their $1.13 billion deal is pro-competitive.
Western has agreed to pay $77 per share for Giant in a deal that would create
an independent refiner and marketer with capacity of about 216,000 barrels per
day, largely in Virginia, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico.

The deal would give Western a foothold in the eastern United States with
Giant's Yorktown refinery, and let it expand in the fast-growing southwestern
market with the Ciniza refinery.

The purchase plan was originally announced on Aug. 28 when Western said it
would pay $1.22 billion for Giant. The agreement was amended to $77 per share
in November from the original $83 per share after two fires at Giant
refineries.

I have been recommending Owens since January and am up over 20% so far. It
would seem like my enthusiasm is shared by those with the most intimate
knowledge of its operations and prospects, management.

Similar to George Soros's recent purchase of ADM shares seeing folks purchasing
a stock you have been invested in does reassure you of your picks and when you
are in the stock well before their purchases and at much lower prices, it does
bode very well for the future of your investment.

This came out in the LA Times. I thought it was a pretty good summation:

Amgen suffers another round of negative news
By Daniel Costello, Times Staff Writer
May 26, 2007

Amgen Inc.'s annus horribilis continues.

On Friday, the Thousand Oaks-based biotech giant received a series of bad news
that follows negative developments in recent months.

First, experts from the European Union's drug regulator recommended that the
company's high-profile cancer drug Vectibix not be approved, dealing the
company another financial and psychological blow.

Separately, Swiss drug maker Roche Holding announced Friday that the European
body was recommending approval for its new anemia drug Mircera in patients with
chronic kidney disease, just a week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
stopped short of giving the drug full approval.

The medication, which is now likely to get European approval this summer and
may get U.S. approval soon after, is a direct competitor to Amgen's highly
profitable anti-anemia medication Aranesp.

Meanwhile, data released Friday showed that sales of Aranesp — one of the
company's top-selling medications — are eroding faster than recently predicted,
threatening the company's revenue outlook.

Monthly prescription sales data for April compiled by NDC Health Information
Services showed that daily Aranesp sales declined 16% and total units declined
13% from March.

However, investors took the setbacks in stride, reinforcing some analysts'
views that Amgen's stock already had factored in bad news. The shares, which
are down 20% this year, dropped 2 cents to close at $54.55 on Friday.

Several recent studies have raised questions about the safety of Aranesp and
its shorter-acting predecessor Epogen in some patients and dosages. This month
an FDA advisory panel recommended that the agency change the drugs' labels and
lower recommended dosages for some patients.

The federal Medicare agency followed days later with an announcement that it
might scale back reimbursements for the drugs soon.

The drugs treat anemia in more than 1 million cancer and dialysis patients a
year.

Few experts expected the drugs' sales to fall so rapidly so soon.

"Their sales numbers were atrocious," said Robert W. Baird & Co. biotech
analyst Christopher Raymond, who recently downgraded the stock from
"outperform" to "neutral."

Raymond said the European news was "important but not yet lethal" because
European sales for Vectibix were expected to be $25 million this year compared
with $200 million in the U.S. He said he believed Micera's approval on both
sides of the Atlantic could take longer than some predict.

Vectibix, a cutting-edge cancer therapy, won FDA approval last September to
treat late-stage colon cancer patients.

The drug, viewed as a key medicine in Amgen's development pipeline, is part of
a new generation of cancer therapies known as monoclonal antibodies. They
induce an immune response against a cancer cell by targeting individual growth
factors rather than the whole tumor.

In a statement, Amgen said it would appeal the European decision by the
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. There are precedents for
companies appealing and overturning committee decisions. Last year Roche
appealed the recommendation not to approve Tarceva for pancreatic cancer.

Dr. Randy Hecht, a gastroenterologist and oncologist at UCLA's Jonsson
Comprehensive Cancer Center, said he believed that the company would eventually
succeed in reversing the panel's decision because the drug is so similar to
Erbitux, a late-stage colon cancer drug sold by ImClone Systems Inc. and
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. that is approved in Europe and the U.S.

"There is no reason for them not to approve" Vectibix. "It essentially does the
same thing as Erbitux," he said.

The London-based European Medicines Agency said its committee was concerned
that there wasn't sufficient evidence to show a benefit of Vectibix.

Though many stock analysts have turned on Amgen in recent weeks, several remain
positive.

"Some of the chips will eventually fall their way, and they have some strong
fundamentals," said Shiv Kapoor, a biotech analyst at Montgomery & Co.

Several of the company's pipeline drugs look promising, including its
osteoporosis drug Denosumab and a late-stage drug candidate for lung and breast
cancer.

Someone brought out to me some facts and figures regarding SRT and how the
books look etc., profit margins, EBITDA, and the like. So I thought to post a
few thoughts. First and foremost, I'm not saying SRT is a buy here, I'm saying
its worth a look. I do not own it.

While I agree that tangible book value in and of itself means little, The
shares may currently already reflect the worst. One thing I rely heavily is a
high regard for management and their ability to turn a bad situation around.
For those not intimately familiar with the Management, some who are put them at
very high marks for capability to handle adverse business developments and a
turnaround. It's not the kind of management that would reopen a facility that
employs 250 without it being well thought out imo.

I have no idea whether this is a good bottom fish area. If you saw and depended
on the books and past performance of financials over the last two years, one
could never sniff out a turnaround. To extrapolate future developments on its
own appears an incorrect methodology for ferreting out turn around candidates.
I submit if one would have done so, they would not have bought SOSA for a
dollar - now ACGY http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=ACGY&t=my

or BW near $5 http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=ACGY&t=my

or RVI at 1.69 http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=RVI&t=5y

These companies looked much worse on the books than SRT does.

The post was meant to throw out an idea for further DD a situation that might
be worth a good look. Management is one of the most important influencing
factors when it comes to turning adverse situations around and unfortunately
the capability of Management is not always reflected in past Financial reports.

Titan International
When the large wheel market was bad, it wasn't something Titan Management had
control over being a cyclical business. But they were able to succesfully
navigate adverse conditions beyond their control.

Paul Senior - Saw WNR/GI bucking the trend today...here's why. RGRDS - JT

Court Denies FTC's Request for Preliminary Injunction Related to Western
Refining's and Giant Industries' Proposed Merger
Tuesday May 29, 2:11 pm ET

EL PASO, Texas and SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Western
Refining, Inc. (NYSE: WNR - News) and Giant Industries, Inc. (NYSE: GI - News)
today announced that the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico has
denied the Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction
related to the companies' proposed merger and dissolved the temporary
restraining order issued on April 13, 2007.
ADVERTISEMENT

"The District Court's ruling affirms what we, as well as what many customers
and state and industry leaders, have said all along. We believe a Western-Giant
combination is pro-competitive and provides important benefits to the
companies' stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders and employees,"
said Western's President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Foster.

Based upon discussions with the FTC prior to the Court's ruling, Western
believes the FTC will appeal the District Court's ruling regardless of the
rationale or basis for the Court's opinion and that the FTC will seek an
injunction from either the District Court or the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
10th Circuit to preclude the closing of the merger pending the FTC's appeal to
the 10th Circuit Court. Western and Giant believe there is no basis for either
an injunction or an appeal. To ensure an orderly process to a May 31, 2007
close, Western and Giant have agreed with the FTC to not close the merger prior
to noon mountain time on Thursday, May 31, 2007. Western and Giant noted that
absent a ruling from the 10th Circuit enjoining the merger, the companies may
close the transaction at any point after noon mountain time on Thursday, May
31, 2007.

"There is no basis for the FTC to appeal the District Court's decision. We
remain confident in our position and look forward to closing the transaction,"
continued Mr. Foster.

On November 13, 2006, Western Refining and Giant Industries announced an
agreement under which Western will acquire all of the outstanding shares of
Giant for $77.00 per share in cash. As previously announced, Giant Industries'
shareholders voted to approve the transaction on February 27, 2007.

Owens Corning- Thinking Pink Will Stuff Your Wallet With Green

I thought I posted this piece back in January, but a search shows me I meant to
but didn't follow through.

Owens Corning is another company that recently emerged from the desolate
wasteland of asbestos bankruptcy. OC (not the TV show) emerged in Nov. 2006 and
its shares, after an initial run have settled around $28-$30 a share. I believe
this is a mere pittance of their true value.

Disclosure: I currently hold OC warrants on 1000 shares. These warrants allow
me to purchase 1000 shares of OC at $45 a share at any time in the next 7
years.

Why is OC trading so cheap? Let's look at it.

Housing Market: When most of us think of OC, we only think of home insulation
(we "think pink" as their commercials tell us). Let's look at how this slowdown
in new construction will effect OC.

Insulation: (30% of total revenue) OC is the world leader in both commercial
and residential construction, BUT only 60% of this segments earnings come from
new construction. The rest is from repair and international sales.

Asphalt roofing: (28% of total revenue) Only 21% of this segments sales are
from new residential construction. The rest is commercial as residential
repair.

While these segments will be affected by the new construction slowdown, the
market is pricing this effect to be absolute rather the smaller effect it will
be. Let's not forget, the repair business should see no slowdown, if you need a
new roof, you need a new roof, there is no putting it off. Also, tax changes
(Energy Policy Act of 2005) have assured a market for insulation upgrades in
existing homes.

Analyst Coverage: Currently coverage of OC is non existent. This has the effect
of keeping it out of the news and off potential investors radar screens. The
only time we do hear about it is in an asbestos article and in relation to the
housing slowdown, neither of which will make people want to purchase shares.
When a curious potential investor cannot even find an earnings estimate for the
company, it scares them away.

Bankruptcy Comparisons: If you pull up OC on any of the major finance websites
to get info on it, you will most likely decide it is not a good investment. The
results they give for OC include bankruptcy items. You need to be able to pull
these charges out of the numbers to see how the actual businesses of OC were
performing. This is very laborious and most people will not bother or simply do
not understand that these charges are now eliminated. The actual business of OC
has always been very profitable, it shows huge accounting losses due to
asbestos write offs, now that these are gone, paper profits will resume.

These factors are all depressing the stock of OC. However, if we dig we find
that the perception of the limited scope of their business is wrong and the
companies various segments are performing extremely well. So, when we have a
good company with a temporarily depressed stock price due to conditions not
totally related to its underlying business performance what do we have? A value
play!

Let's find out what the other's seem to be missing:

Building Materials Business: (19% of total revenue) Through a series of
acquisitions, OC is N. America's leading supplier of exterior siding and
exterior/ interior stone (think patio's and interior stone walls) for both
residential and commercial construction. Only 55% of this segments business is
from new residential building. Included in this business is the OC Basement
Refinishing franchise. Both these these segments were added during the
bankruptcy process so its results are "hidden" when one does a cursory look at
OC's eps the past 3 years due to massive asbestos write offs.

Composites: (23% of total revenues) Here is the hidden gem and a double digit
grower. OC's composites are used in everything from boats, planes, military
Hummers, RV's, high speed trains, the auto industry and more. OC is the world's
number one producer of this stuff. The fastest growing sector? Composites for
wind turbines (growing 15%-20% annually). I would bet painfully few potential
investors are even aware this housing proof segment not only exists in OC, but
is the fastest growing division!!

I will do the work for you on earnings (minus bankruptcy charges). They have
grown from 300 million in 2002 to 550 million in 2005 and look to go to 600
million in 2006 (that is a cool 100% growth in 4 years). Now take the roughly
130 million shares outstanding and you get $4.61 a share in earnings (although
this is the only actual earnings estimate you will be able to find) for a
current PE of 6.2!! No wonder the CEO and Chairman of The Board recently ponied
up 1/2 a million of their own dollars each to buy shares in the open market
(various other insiders have purchased another $700,000 worth)!

Let's take this one additional step. Let pretend we had the money to buy all of
OC. What would we get? For our $29 a share price we would receive the $12 a
share in cash OC currently has, plus another $4.60 a share in earnings during
the first year. So let's get this straight, for $29 a share we would get $16.60
(57% return in year one) back immediately and this does not even include the
value of its assets or earnings past the first year!!

They call it value investing for a reason..........

Welcome back. I've missed your posts and recommendations.

Looking for the "best value play for the next six months"? I've no idea what
might work, or work best, in that time frame.

Maybe something with a big dividend yield. A canroy, or real estate something
(reit, developer, etc.). Deep water drillers look like they've got a big book
of business; forward p/e's aren't too expensive (e.g. RIG, DO) imo.

30 Stocks on Sale

By David Peltier
RealMoney.com Contributor
5/29/2007 2:01 PM EDT
Click here for more stories by David Peltier

With nearly 2,500 stocks on the major U.S. exchanges that have a market
capitalization of at least $500 million, I often use stock-screening tools to
sift through and find the best values in the market.

Screens can be particularly helpful in the value arena, where I can use popular
metrics like price-to-book value, price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios
to stack companies up against their peers.

But running a stock screen is just the initial step that ultimately leads to an
investment decision. Just because a company looks cheap on previously reported
numbers doesn't mean that earnings, sales and net worth aren't currently
declining.

When doing your research on value stocks, it's also important to identify
upcoming potential catalysts, because a value stock that's below the radar may
remain undervalued until the company has something to say that makes investors
take notice.

This screen focuses on the price-to-sales ratio, or P/S, which is the last of
the three major value metrics. Although the market is a discounting mechanism,
and thus usually interested in forward-looking numbers, it's common to use
trailing 12-month revenue in this measure.

The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which I screened in the April 24 Value
Investor newsletter, is the most popular of the three value metrics, although
it is used for stocks of all shapes and sizes.

On April 10, I screened for price-to-tangible book value, the final member of
the value screen triumvirate, because a company's hard asset value truly does
place a floor on valuation.

On the other hand, many sectors -- especially retail -- often carry a
price-to-sales ratio of less than 1, meaning a company's market capitalization
is less than its annual sales.

With that in mind, I further quantified this week's list of stocks by screening
for companies that generated positive operating margin and operating cash-flow
growth in the most recent quarter.

All of the stocks in the table below are from the universe of 2,374 companies
based in the U.S. that have a market capitalization of at least $500 million.

Once again this week, I've presented a list of names of various investment
sizes: 10 stocks each of the cheapest large-caps, mid-caps and small-caps,
ranked by the price-to-sales ratio. As with any ideas, particularly value
ideas, readers should do their own homework before making any investment

Fwiw, I'll take on a few shares of real-estate closed-end fund RIT. (-g-)
=========================================================
On the one hand, real estate companies -- reits-- have really done so well the
past few years compared to other investing areas (mid-cap growth, value, other
fund types), that one has to wonder if the real estate appreciation in these
sectors - apartments, commercial, etc. has about peaked. OTOH, we still see
interest in acquiring reits, such as the take out of apartment reit,
Archstone-Smith Trust, a couple of days ago.

RIT consists of a bunch of reits, preferred stocks, and repurchase agreements
(unfathomable stuff, repros, to me) in different USA real estate sectors. It's
a closed-end fund that sells close to nav. Seems like they are trying now for a
consistent monthly dividend; if the div. is sustainable at current .19/sh per
month, the yield now is $2.28/$24 or about .095 = 9.5%. That's not possible
based just on the dividends of the underlying reits in the fund. It is being
done by trading and hedging by RIT fund management. Whether fund management can
continue to do this successfully, I do not know.

Given the generous (although perhaps risky) yield, the broad diversity of
stocks held in RIT, the professional management of RIT by Legg Mason, it's my
opinion this stock might/could/may be suitable for a 'mom account' where for a
few shares in her portfolio, mom has a shot at spiffing up her dividend income
a little.

Jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

Is that 19 cents a share just part of a "managed distribution policy" where the
fund attempts to payout their expected long term average annual return ?

I prefer RTU and its 13+% discount to NAV although it has a more modest yield
of 6.25% or so. (Also UTF which is ultilies and Real Estate)

I got a CBF annual report yesterday. Had to call for it since I didnt own the
stock untill recently.

It says they ended the year with a $31.8 million high yield mezzanine loan as
non performing and a $19.7 million high yield mezzanine loan on their watch
list.

Perhaps these are why they canned the president ?

Best I can tell, nothing has been reserved for either.

But, their mezzanine loans as a whole have a weighted average loan to value of
76% so hopefully they wont incur big losses from them. (page 5 of 10k)

It was nice to see FSP rebound since my last buy at $17.70. I was getting
worried when it continued down to $17.25.

I guess with FSP, CBF,FUR, RTU, UTF and my large positon illiquid pinksheeter
HGPI, as well as owning my house, I think I have enough real estate exposure.

Saw a couple more insider buys in FUR but they dont jive with yahoos volume
totals so Im not sure what the deal is.

Yes, my understanding is RIT has this managed distribution policy. I'm keeping
my shares in a taxable account, because I'm figuring part of that 19 cents will
be, if not now, at some point, a return of capital. As they sell something to
get cash to keep the dividend constant (assuming in a bad year that they don't
again change the dividend policy).

Disappointed to read of CBF troubles. It's discouraging. I'll continue to watch
insiders. I bought because of large insider buys, one of which by a
sophisticated value investor (D. Eby), I believe. I'm hoping he and I and you
are right to buy and hold this thing.

I'm looking to hold FUR 3-5 years.

I have another closed end fund...JQC that I bought when the discount was over
10%. A few months after I bought they upped their dividend a little and did the
managed distribution thing. Based on 8.5% I think. Anyway the discount all but
when away until recently when they told us they were going away from the
monthly dividends and instead making them quarterly.

Supposedly, the SEC is making such funds notify everyone in writing every month
that managed distributions could be a return of capital.
Seems a bit silly.

I would prefer monthly because they get reinvested monthly rather than
quarterly. I have it in my IRA.

ZTR also does the 10% managed distribution policy and its premium has all but
disappeared because of a rights offering where they sold shares at a slight
discount to NAV and a 5% discount to the 5 day average before the rights
offering closed.

I bought more because I didnt want to be diluted but If I was smart, I would
have sold when the premium was over 15%.

It got to like 19% at one point. I had a sell order in at $5.99 and when it got
close, I changed it to $6.24.

Now its $5.15. Pennywise and pound foolish !

Im pretty comfortable with FSP, CBF & FUR as long term holdings. Im dividend
reinvesting on all of them too.

As for CBFs troubles, Im not concerned because of all the insider buying. And
the dividend yield.

The $31.8 million in a nonperforming asset is dwarfed by their $1.37 billion
well diversified portfolio. Both regionally and by property type.

Plus, their deal pipeline from CB Richard Ellis has to be an invaluable asset.
And the market isnt giving it ANY value seeing as the stocks trading around
book value.

Regarding FSP, did you notice that the CEO turned down both his bonus and his
stock options voluntarily ? Says its because the stock price is ultimately his
responsibility and it didnt do anything for the year. Thats kind of refreshing.

You dont see that too often.

Im hoping that FSP takes off later this year as they sell more properties at
gains and reinvest in others.

Still, I think he is fighting a losing battle trying to convince the market
that FSP is an "investment company" as opposed to a REIT.

It might even be better for them to leverage themselves modestly. But, its less
risky than others because of the lack of debt.

the underperforming assets are discussed in CBF's Q1 report:

 During the quarter, the Company funded an additional $4.4 million to its $31.8
million non-performing asset to cure the default on the senior loan, pay real
estate taxes and pay for attorney and appraisal services relative to the loan.
At March 31, 2007, the balance of this non-performing asset was $36.2 million
representing 2.1 percent of total assets. In addition, in April 2007 the
Company funded an additional $0.8 million on the senior loan to further protect
its investment. The Company believes, and third party appraisals support, that
there is collateral value in excess of the book value for this asset.

In addition, during the quarter the Company funded an additional $1.7 million
to cure the default on the senior loan, pay real estate taxes and pay for
attorney and appraisal services relative to the loan and recognized $0.4
million of income on its $19.7 million watch list asset. At March 31, 2007, the
balance of this watch list asset was $21.8 million representing 1.2 percent of
total assets. In addition, in April 2007 the Company funded an additional $0.3
million on the senior loan to further protect its investment. On May 4, 2007,
the Company foreclosed on the underlying asset and subject to an estimated
30-60 day judicial ratification process, the Company will own the asset and
control the exit strategy. The Company believes, and third party appraisals
support, that there is collateral value in excess of the book value for this
asset.

sounds to me that any additional impact would be minimal, and perhaps there
will even be some recovery

they also sold a CMBS that they thought had potential trouble

seems to me that they are doing a good job of staying on top of things

About "30 Stocks on Sale". Well we all have our different ways and opinions, I
guess. But man, that list to me looks like about the worst I've ever
encountered as regards the use of price to sales ratio.

I can't actually figure out how the author uses p/sales ratio. Looking at the
large cap portion, Supervalu (.27) is in there because (?) it has a low (?)
p/sales number or because it's lower than the next in line AMR (.29)?

For one example, these grocery chains are going to have low p/sales numbers.
The author's got to compare Supervalu's number now with Supervalu's numbers in
the past. And that .27 is very very high when this comparison is done. Which
means SVU is likely not a buy for value investors now, or if it is there's
danger at current high price. Of course, one could, I suppose, say it is a
"stock on sale", in the sense that every stock is on sale and somebody is
buying or selling SVU every trading day.

I'm holding several stocks on that list, and some of these look to be closer to
sells than adds. I don't want anybody telling me for example that AVT (at near
highs now at $42), is a buy now. I wanted to hear that last August when I
posted I was adding to my position (@$17.37). I'm considering SELLING AVT; am
not at all looking to buy. It's too expensive now for a buy for what it is.
(Jmo)

I scanned the list. Nothing there for me that shows real attractive for
initiating a new position. Maybe a relook at Stein Mart for a second glance.

Of course, all jmo. Others might see it very differently.

> May 31 (Bloomberg) -- The global cocoa deficit this year will be larger than
previously forecast after adverse weather hurt crops in Ivory Coast, Ghana and
Indonesia, the top producing countries, the International Cocoa Organization
said. Production will drop 7.5 percent to 3.44 million tons, falling short of
demand by 145,000 tons, Laurent Pipitone, senior statistician at the
London-based ICCO, said today in an interview. The organization forecast in
March a deficit of 103,000 tons. ``There's been a significant drop in cocoa
production compared to last season, mainly in West Africa because of dry
weather between November and February,'' Pipitone said.
>

> “We have a pretty tight situation for anhydrous ammonia and urea. If the
season breaks early, some areas may not get all the fertilizer they want, when
they want it, at any price.”

> MEXICO CITY - Mexican farmers are setting ablaze fields of blue agave, the
cactus-like plant used to make the fiery spirit tequila, and resowing the land
with corn as soaring U.S. ethanol demand pushes up prices.
>
> The switch to corn will contribute to an expected scarcity of agave in coming
years, with officials predicting that farmers will plant between 25 percent and
35 percent less agave this year to turn the land over to corn. "Those growers
are going after what pays best now," said Ismael Vicente Ramirez, head of
agriculture at Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council.

The 2007 cotton season has commenced and it is anticipated that the Australian
crop size will be around 1.1 million bales representing a 58% reduction on the
previous season's 2.6 million bales. It is expected that 2007 will be the
lowest level of cotton production in the last 20 years. Continuing drought
conditions and low pricing were cited as primary causal factors.

Increased useage of farmland designated for corn production in the US could
potentially impact domestic production. Longer term, U.S. and world
fundamentals for the coming 2007/08 marketing year point to a tighter market
and the potential for a rebound in prices further into the fall. In the U.S.,
the fall harvest is projected to shrink 13.0%, owing to the largest decline in
plantings in a decade. Reversing course from the current marketing year, demand
is anticipated to jump 20.7% on the strength of near-record exports. Pending
redemptions from the CCC loan and early-season export sales suggest the new
marketing year will start with an ample supply of exportable cotton. Coupled
with recent reports that forecast China importing upwards of 23 million bales
next year, U.S. exports could likely climb substantially from this year’s
level. While the export outlook for next year is robust, U.S. mill demand is
projected to slip 500,000 bales from this year to 4.4 million, owing to
anticipated growth in imported textiles and apparel in 2007 and the absence of
the Step-2 program. On balance, with lower supply and higher demand likely next
year, U.S. ending stocks are expected to fall 33% from this year to 6.4 million
bales, tightening the stocks-to-use ratio from this season’s 52.3% to 29.2%, a
trend typically associated with strengthening in price.

Similarly, the outlook for new crop world fundamentals mirrors the U.S.
outlook. World production is forecast to decline marginally to 116.0 million
bales, driven by the smaller U.S. crop. World demand is projected to jump 4.0%
to a record 127.0 million bales, driven by growth in Chinese mill demand. This
11.0 million-bale gap between demand and production is anticipated to drop
world ending stocks to 50.7 million bales, the lowest level in five years,
effectively tightening the stocks-to-use ratio from 45.4% this year to 39.9%
next year, creating the opportunity for prices to climb beyond the staid levels
seen over the last two years.

Prices have weakened over the last month in the absence of any near-term
fundamental support. Each NYBOT contract reached life-of-contract lows earlier
in May, and the Nearby remains weighted down below 50 cents, its lowest level
in ten months. The combination of possible continued erosion in old crop
fundamentals and the likelihood of large numbers of CCC loans expiring before
harvest suggests prices may not benefit from tighter U.S. and world
fundamentals until further into the 2007/08 marketing year. Longer term, the
resounding outlook for tighter fundamentals for the next marketing
year—domestically and worldwide—supports the opportunity for prices to climb
above average levels seen over 2006/07.

Added a few more shares of MWA (Mueller Water Products) to my starter position
purchased 1/22/07. Company will be presenting at the JP Morgan Industrial
conference today and management should provide a good overview post spin off.

Free flow cash continues to grow but long term debt is still relatively high
but quite manageable. I expect them to work this debt down over time as
revenues grow which will create value for the patient investor.

The key will be for Mueller to diversify their product portfolio and services
so they can participate in several sectors of the economy. Maybe something will
be discussed at the conference today that details their long term strategy.
There should be a good market in supplying valves and pipe fittings to the

Hi Madharry - TRGL (Toreador Resources Corp) has exploration wells through out
Europe including France, Hungry, Romania and Turkey.
http://www.toreador.net/global_activity.html

They also hold interests in non-active wells in the U.S.. Their France property
is producing good cash flow that is helping to pay the exploration costs for
their other Euro sites. They just started production on their South Akcakoca
Sub-Basin project located in Turkey.

I like that their operations are not in the middle east (eg. IRAQ) and that
most of their proven reserves are in France. As to the political risk, I
believe it is low but there is significant risk that new exploration wells come
up dry.

You do raise a good point regarding Turkey and the EU. They own a 31% interest
in their Turkey property with their production sold to BOTAS (a Turkish
national pipeline company). Prices and tariffs are adjusted monthly but if
Turkey becomes an EU member, its possible that these reserves could be worth
more (especially is prices are fixed to the Euro).

My position is small and my portfolio needs more international exposure. I
thought this might be an interesting way to accomplish this with the added
kicker that some of these new wells might be big producers.

on equity over 21% and a forward PE of approximately 9-10 has this stock in a
spot that is at least short term attractive as it retests the dip lows
successfully and straddles the 200 day MA.

From:- with a K
Nice summary of the TRGL opportunity. There's a lot of warts here, but I am
encouraged by the new wells, insider buying, and thinking the worst is behind
them. Snip from the iVillage board about CK Cooper's report May 10:

The upside remains in the SASB, where the Company has already drilled four
additional successful wells since its year-end reserve report. Three of these
wells in the deeper waters tested a combined 82.5 Mmcfe per day, while a
shallower well the Alapi-1 tested at 7 Mmcfe per day. This would imply an
additional 30 to 40 Bcfe of net reserve potential to Toreador’s interest.

Typically the largest risk for investors to stomach is exploration risk. It
would seem this risk has been mitigated with 13 out of 15 successful wells in
the SASB. The risk that remains is Toreador’s ability to complete development
and begin generating cash flow to keep the drill bit moving without taking down
additional debt or issuing further dilution.

We continue to belief in Toreador’s business plan and asset base. It has been
extremely frustrating and embarrassing to say the least witnessing this
destruction of value over the past few months. However, we are not throwing in
the towel and believe investors will be rewarded when buying shares at these
absurdly depressed levels. We are therefore maintaining our current rating of a
BUY while lowering our price target to $25.00 reflecting the Company’s current
balance sheet and applying a slight discount to our Risk Adjusted Break-Up
Value of $27.78."

Hi - with a K

Thank you you for the lead on UGP. This one sounds like it should fit my
diversification program and I especially like that they are located in Brazil.
I am very bullish on companies in Brazil as I believe there could also be a
positive currency kicker return (Real vs the U.S. $) in the next three to five
years.

There has been a lot of discussion on natural gas producers located in Canada.
Many that I have scanned are Limited Partnerships, not pure natural gas
infrastructure plays, highly leveraged and have already had significant price
appreciation.

One that was mentioned in the recent issue of the Resource Investors Bull &
Bear newsletter is COPANO (Copano Energy LLC) http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cpno
.

I like their business (http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=CPNO ) They own natural
gas gathering facilities, pipelines, and a processing plants located in the
Texas Gulf region. The downside is that they are a Master Limited Partnership
(ugly K1's) except there is no general partner to take profits off the top. All
of Copano's dividends flow through to the shareholders. The company went public
in 12/2004 and has shown an excellent cash flow from their operations.

The author is looking for 15% per year total return but the company has already
delivered over 38% return because of investors interest. The stock is up
another 25% since the writing of the article in April 2007 and IMO is not a
value at current prices.

Have you heard of COPANO and know of any other companies that operate in Canada
and/or U.S. with a similar business - hooks up producing natural gas wells,
process & distribute product to end users.
