re IBPI - used to follow them years ago before the split. The first drug (i
think it was an antibiotic) was abandoned) under somewhat obscure circumstance.
Now I see the 2nd one bit the dust as well. Looks like they will likely burn
through their remaining dough pretty quick.

As with all below cash plays, one has to look at the underlying business.
Sometimes it is indeed worth less than zero. I believe that IBPI is such a
case. I believe that OSCI and XNVA are at least close to cash and better plays,
but of course i could be wrong.

Guess I'd pass on IBPI at current price. Impossible for me to figure business
prospects. OTOH, since I like to buy small amounts and a package of these
things, understanding the company and its prospects isn't totally necessary for
overall success. (I hope.) I have bought a couple of these biotechs like this
before, and they've worked out okay. (Aside: and as time has passed, I seem to
have learned more about their businesses, and have become somewhat more
comfortable holding on to the shares even though they've moved up from
below-cash plays.)

IBPI is a bet that management won't fritter away remaining cash. I'd like even
more of a margin of safety - maybe with current cash and a stock price closer
to @2.50/sh.

Man, how this company has fallen. Selling now under $4, market had evaluated
its prospects very highly- and stock was over $400/sh - in wonder year 2000.

Larry - are you suggesting that you can't find value in penny stocks?

i posted about SPND when it was around 50 cents and it is doing very well -

July 22, 2004-- Spindletop Oil & Gas Co. was listed as one of the fastest
growing public companies in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex by The Dallas

net sales for the most recent fiscal year and Spindletop was ranked 20th.

i was posting that i was purchasing shares of WSTD at .03 [i actually bot
shares as low as .015] and now the management is looking to buyout the
shareholders for .32 per share. now 30 cent bid

i purchase 50k shares of TVIN at .05 but admit i exited too early. stock is now
around 4 bucks.

i also purchase a lot of shell stocks. did you happen to watch SPEA last week?

there is a saying among prospectors: "GOLD IS WHERE YOU FIND IT."

speaking of which - i think i mentioned THMG here around 8 cents. US forest
service is looking to buy their land which would equate to about 55 cents per

Cascade Microtech(CSCD) announces strategic licensing agreement with Tokyo
Seimitsu

Cascade Microtech, a manufacturer of wafer probe cards and probe stations for
laboratory-grade parametric testing of semiconductor devices, has licensed
essential RF measurement technology to Tokyo Seimitsu Co., Ltd., a supplier of
manufacturing equipment and measurement instruments for the semiconductor
industry.

The technology transfer will lead to faster and more accurate RF testing of
advanced semiconductor devices during production, including high-speed
telecommunications and wireless devices.

“Cascade is clearly the world leader in RF probing innovations for the
research-and-development environment, where measurements must be at least an
order of magnitude more precise than those of production tests,” says Masakuni
Matsuda, senior executive officer of Tokyo Seimitsu. “Our license agreement
with Cascade will enable Tokyo Seimitsu to adapt its wafer probers to better
meet the emerging RF production test needs of major semiconductor
manufactures.”

Ray - i dont disagree that PSCO looks like a dog...

and perhaps will always be a dog.

i do speculate a LOT on some of these penny plays but when i do so i try to
have some method to my madness.

Protosource has been around for a LONG time and used to be based here in my
hometown of Fresno CA. the stock was at one time around 8 bucks. i watched it
over the years as it failed at its business plan -- all the way down to where
it is. they ended up selling off the business to management and became a shell
and then earlier this year merged P2ionline into the shell.

since they have been around the internet business a long time they have some
good contacts. BrandX networks the company that used to BE protosource is one
of their partners and i have done business with BrandX and they ARE good folks.

Protosource does have a good customer base - although it looks smaller now than
it was a year or so ago. what they do it simple - they work for companies like
the LA Times that have a printed version of media that they want to convert to
an internet version. the company outsources most of its work to its office in
Kuala Lampoor in Malasia where they have about 50 employees. they also have
some proprietary sowtware set up with BrandX networks as well. it seems to me
that this is a niche market that could be in high demand in the future and if
PSCO survives they would have a huge edge on the competition - imo

i also believe that protosource has a good relationship with its investment
banker.

if you look at the last quarter it wasnt too bad.

there are around 32 million share OS but the majority of those were issued for
the merger and have a 3 year lock up. that leaves around 8 million shares or so
in the float - perhaps less.

certainly not for widows or orphans - but imo shares purchased in the 3 to 5
cent range could pay off in the future if the company mamages to survive and
execute its business plan.

if you buy 5k shares at .04 and i am wrong - you could lose you entire $200.00
investment. but - if .....

Paul and all, we discussed CIEN early December when it was trading way below
book value. It is up 14.7% today at $3.2, above book value $2.88.

With the market indices at new highs and many below-cash zero(or low)-debt tech
stocks, this is almost a perfect tax-loss selling season to build up a
diversified deeply-undervalued portfolio. It is very likely this basket (TFS,
CIEN, INFO, PRCS, NOVT, OSTE, to name a few) will work out well in the next
6-12 months.

Every 2-3 years a cluster of below-cash tech stocks appear in a multi-month
time window. Most other times they rise above cash or book value, make value
investors scratching heads about what to do. Next time when those below-cash
stocks disappear, I will simply hold for the most part, and build up cash
positions as they become overvalued. I will not try to "time the market" by
options trading, no big swings from 100% net long to 100% net short, it will be
between 50-100% net long, and hope to have steady beat-the-market returns in

Steve, what you say about ADGO is true, it is not even close to being a below
cash play.I bought when it was below 1.10$ and dirt cheap. however, i still
think it's cheap now, with about 60c in liquid assets/share and earnings of 18c
for 9 month this year you are paying a PE of 3 for the company sans the cash.

As i mentioned before just looking at below cash or book value is too
simplistic, you need to look at the underlying business. with TFS and maybe
even PRCS, i believe the underlying business is worth less then 0, as both
companies are likely to burn lot's of money in the NT future. TFS is just a
hopeless business, IMO with PRCS you have at least a crapshot on a new drug
development, unless they continue to market Plenaxis, which is a looser. With
ADGO on the other hand, i can expect the cash pile to grow and the copmpany to
be even more valuable in the future.

just looking at below cash or book value is too simplistic, you need to look at
the underlying business

Spek, once you think you can tell good business from bad while ignoring (or not
focusing on) the hard numbers (price-to-book), you moved one step further away
from Graham style below-66%-net-liquidation-value investing, and one step
closer to "growth" or "momentum" investing. In the dot com years many people
thought they "know" the business, and made a lot of money on the high flyers -
JDSU, CIEN, QCOM just to name a few. When the party ended, we all know what
happened. You may very likely make a lot of money on ADGO, but there is more
risk in that approach. Did you notice the 50% drop in revenue, 90% drop in
earnings in ADGO's 30-Sep-04 quarter?

I guess we all have our unique styles, and I somehow like and believe the Ben
Graham style, this style is not necessarily good or bad, other styles all have
their times, and it is hard to tell which style will be in favor in the next
year or two. But from all the academic studies (Fama and French, Piotroski,
LSV, on several decades of stock performance) and my personal experience, low
price-to-book (scrutinized book, not stated book value) is the single most
significant number correlated to the next 1-5 years performance.

Warren Buffett was a below-net-liquidation style investor first when he was
running his investment limited partnership (same terms as today's hedge fund).
After he got bigger, the net-nets are simply not enough for him to deploy his
capital. So he started to count intangible assets such as brand names as value.
He simply had no choice.

The below-66%-net-liquidation-value field is the most fertile ground for small
value investors. I am buying below-cash non-leveraged stocks when management
started to cut costs, believing they have a reasonable chance to realize some
value on their existing infrastructure (replacement cost is higher), such as
TFS's TFT screen factory in Beijing. They have a reasonable chance to get some
cell phone color screen orders. The other key factor is diversification, if you
have basket of those tech stocks, the multi-baggers will help you beat the
market even when 55% of your stocks failed to beat the market, as we had seen
two years ago from ALVR, DUSA, PCYC (I mentioned those too many times already).
Now CIEN, OSTE started the upward move, TFS, PRCS may very well be the next,
and eventually even INFO may have a good chance to bounce up.

If ADGO were dropped from $5 (or above) to $1.4, I may consider buying a bit,
the fact that it stayed at $0.2-0.4 while millions of shares traded just over a
year ago, made me nervous that those $0.3 shares are sold to me at $1.4. For
TFS, few people bought below my price which is below $2. It may drop to new
lows, but I am taking a calculated risk.

There is a natural "reverse to mean" physical law in politics, economy and most
significantly - stock market. When the business is good, new investment will
come to the competition, capacity increased, price competition/cuts, resulting
loss to most players, and digest the overcapacity. Same is true that after that
bust, there is no investments, undercapacity, and survivors will enjoy 1-3
years of prosperity. Old cycle again and again. Studies showed the group of
stocks that did the best in last 3 years will do worse in the next 3 years,
than the group did the worst in prior 3 years.

Hi Steve - Several good points in your post. One of the items that I have
noticed for companies that have "hidden value" are those much older survivors
that have been run into the ground by bad management. They have not invested in
new technologies to make operations more efficient, or just have continued to
get by with running the operation "like we always have".

With the Internet, computers, integrated JIT inventory systems, expanding
global markets and outsourcing, many new management options are now available
that make an operation more efficient and profitable utilizing their cheap
capital asset base (in most cases w/ no debt and all paid for).

I ran across an example of this recently with Amerco Inc. (UHAL), the old UHAUL
company. The parent company went into bankruptcy in June 2003. Management
basically screwed up getting into other business operations they did not
understand (like insurance & special purpose entities as suggested by their
"consultants").

Here is an article that the Motley Fool authored September 2003 regarding
Amerco's recovery.
http://netscape.fool.com/News/mft/2003/mft&l.. .

From the article:"...Amerco Chairman Joe Shoen noted that the company has more
assets than liabilities. Moreover, the process of bankruptcy offers an
interesting view into what is actually a healthy corporation. Stated book value
of corporate assets are based upon accounting laws, and can distort actual
value. Shoen noted, "real estate appraisals showed the market value of Amerco's
unencumbered owned real estate is $550 million higher than stated book value."
In other words, the company had some substantial value not captured under
accounting standards....".

From my observation, the company survived because it's original "core" business
was sound and somewhat profitable. More importantly, their booked assets were
less than their "actual current" market value or "potential economic" value.
Because the company has been around for over two decades, many of their fixed
assets were significantly undervalued and NOT being utilized for the best
overall economic return. Management got lazy and screwed up!

How's this for a turnaround -
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=2y&s=UHA.. .

The average investor probably would not have known all of the sour deals that
the Parent company entered into especially these "Special Purpose Entities"
accounting tricks.

The moral of this story is shareholders (like Benjamin Graham did) must rock
the boat from time to time so management does not get lazy and "under utilize"
the company's core assets. Also, management must stick to their knitting and
innovate as technology and markets change.

===============================================================

From the companies you track, do any meet this criteria (i.e. bad and lazy
management, company 25 years or older)? I think a good start is to look at
those operations that are 25 years or older and just surviving.

I am still looking for the magic formula for uncovering these hidden "value"
companies. This has been a good starting point for me.

Happy Holidays and healthy New Year to all the SI investors.

Steve, i would just chip in that the well performing Piotroski screen looks at
the value of the underlying business just as much as it does at book value:

 Piotroski's solution wasn't rocket science. He figured that the companies with
the best prospects might show some early signs of a turnaround. So he devised a
nine-point rating scale based on balance sheet analysis. First there's
profitability, which can earn a company up to four points: one point for
positive return on assets (a hurdle that eliminates almost half of all value
stocks), one for positive cash flow, one if return on assets improved during
the past year and one if cash flow exceeds reported income (a measure of
earnings strength). Then comes capital structure, three points: one if the
ratio of long-term debt to total assets declined over the past year, one if the
current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) improved and one
if the company didn't issue any more common stock. Finally, there are two
points for operating efficiency: one if gross margins improved over the past
year and another if asset turnover (revenue divided by total assets, a measure
of productivity) improved.

Extend Value Investing Studies Beyond 1997 - Call for Participation or
Suggestions

Spek, you are absolutely right, Piotroski did try to separate the strong low
P/B stocks from weak ones, to further enhance the performance. He used a
nine-point F_score system as you described in your message.

Generally speaking, most academics agreed the lowest decile (10%) P/B books
outperformed market by 5% or more, and beat the highest decile of P/B stocks by
about 10%, that's based on data mining of last 3 decades (mostly before 1997).
The studies I have seen generally have the P/B less than 1.1 or 1.3. Tweedy
Browne even had a study on Graham style 66%-net-liquidation-value stocks, and
the results are even more impressive, around 26% per year the 3 years after
qualified. There were one or two studies cover up to 2000, and showed 1998-2000
were anomalies of this big trend (value beat glamour)

I am interested in extending those studies to including 1997-2004, maybe adding
a few simple new tweaks. I am a programmer so it should not be too hard. I
would like to know if anyone here like to join me, to add your ideas on what to
research, and contacting those people to get details on their prior studies, or

Steve may I suggest the following paper that Paul Senior pointed me to "THE
EVOLUTION OF THE IDEA OF “VALUE INVESTING”: FROM BENJAMIN GRAHAM TO WARREN
BUFFETT" :(http://www.econ.duke.edu/Journals/DJE/dje2000/bierig.PDF).

Specifically check out page 12 regarding Graham's investment in Northern Pipe
Line. Remember this was in 1928 and financial information was limited to those
investors that dug deep into the records that were not normally public
information.

After many years of digging into company's financials, I have found that with
public disclosures and computer data mining, many of the "value" propositions
are known to the market and basically priced accordingly. The market is now
more efficient when everybody scans the same information.

Like Graham, you need to look at "other" public data sources that many of the
so called analysts do not even consider. There is one source that I have been
using for the past several years and that is "Property Title Information".

Almost all of the property title information is now available in different
databases that can be accessed from the Internet. I completed an analysis where
I scanned all of the property owned by Sears and JC Penny (and/or their holding
companies) and quantified (1) the year the property parcel was acquired, (2)
their original cost, (3) parcel size and zoning and (3) my best estimate (based
on current sales)of today's market value.

I completed my analysis for Sears in early 2003 and discovered that at the then
current price of $19/share, Sears was significantly undervalued. I scanned over
1654 properties and discovered that Sears in all of their holdings owned the
property land where their stores and distribution centers were located. In
fact, they even owned the Mall sites either in proportion to the size of their
store or the complete Mall site it's self (usually in partnership with the
original developer).

After adjusting my valuation calculation to reflect the current market prices,
Sears in May of 2003 had real estate holdings "understated" on their balance
sheet at between $8-$11 per share! With this fact in hand, I bought a
significant holding in the stock at prices between $19 and $22.

The only problem in finding the hidden value jewel, is waiting for other
investors to discover this. Sometimes you have to wait years for a large
investment group to develop a plan that is approved by the current board to
bring out the true value to the common shareholders. Even this approach can
screw the common shareholder as evidenced by the recent K-Mart bankruptcy.

Perhaps this approach would work better with smaller companies that have hidden
assets and the board of directors are ethical and are advocates for delivering
the "market value" to the common shareholders. This is why I also now look for
large 5% shareholders that have more clout in delivering the true value back to
the common shareholder.

Types of undervalued assets not reflected in the stated balance sheet include
many types of natural resources, land holdings that have had (or can have)
significant re-zoning approvals (ie agriculture land rezoned to high density
housing), company patents, litigation monies set aside w/ the outcome in favor
of the company, new government regulations (usually taxes) that favor new
technologies (i.e. VOIP phone services) and many other intangible holdings that
now have value but may not even appear as an asset in the company's balance
sheet.

In summary, you can use computer data mining to help screen potential company
value proposition candidates but unless the general market realizes the true
economic value, you may be sitting on a dead asset for awhile. This is why you
need to have an advocate like a 5% common stock holder or company
director(s)(w/ significant vested interests) to help recognize this value back
to the common shareholder. Even with these considerations, the common
shareholder can still get screwed in a bankruptcy proceeding with unethical
directors, greedy buy out partners and even under the table payoffs that result
in nothing going back to the common shareholder.

I guess that is just the nature of our capitalistic system.

Happy New Year to All . . .

IBPI Update. After I dug up the 10-K and calculated their preferred shares and
warrants, my estimate is they have about $5 in cash.

The company has only 6 employees left and they are going to sell the company or
liquidate.

If any company is interested in any intangible asset, or take potential tax
benefit of IBPI's $230M accumulated loss, they may offer several million
dollars for everything. Every $10M will result $1/share above the cash value.

The only risk is the lawsuit, which may not be a big problem according to this
article. Those single drug development stage Biotechs are risky, every
investors should know if they read the offering document. The catching point is
there is only one month after IBPI's stock sale that they stopped the trail.
Can they prove the material numbers only appeared in that month? or can the
other side prove IBPI knew the data before the stock sale?

I think a 25% gain on $4 in several months is worth the risk so I am in.

EKS, thanks for your great insights. Real estate could be one of the biggest
"undervalued" asset on books since they are recorded at cost on balance sheet.
If you find any stocks that are undervalued on this basis, I would probably buy
some.

As you pointed out, this approach has risk too. K-mart went into bankruptcy
with a lot of undervalued real estate. We could have believed in its value and
lost all money as common stock shareholders. It took a big guy like Warren
Buffett or the new K-mart CEO to realize that value. However they may prefer to
let bankruptcy wipe out old common stock shareholders before jump in. It is sad
but why would they give those people a free ride. Those are the smartest
capitalists aim to maximize their own profit. Diversification is a key to avoid
disaster. Same as when I buy those below-cash no-debt tech stocks. They all
have problems and risks, but if you have a diversified portfolio, you would
likely beat the market 8-9 years out of 10 years, except the crazy years of
1998 and 1999.

Spek, Chinese stocks usually go down at year end due to government's annual
check of loans - some money participated in the market during the year need to
be returned to the bank so it won't show-up on the book at year end. Stocks
tend to rally in the first couple months of the year.

That said Chinese stocks are very speculative. Insider trading and price
munipulation (with their closely tied friends/funds) is common practice. They
would buy quietly before they announce a planned good news, and sell on the
news. Same on the other side. They control when to release a good or bad news
and front-run other investors.

Generally speaking the B shares (in US dollars) are cheaper than the A shares
(in RMB yuan) of the same company. Several years ago there was a more than 50%
difference, the gap was filled in one spring, and start to get larger ago.

I don't know a good fund to participate, will do some research and see if I can
find anything.

Hi Steve, In response to your call for interest:

-- "I am interested in extending those studies to including 1997-2004, maybe
adding a few simple new tweaks. I am a programmer so it should not be too hard.
I would like to know if anyone here like to join me, to add your ideas on what
to research, and contacting those people to get details on their prior studies,
or finding cheap/free data sources (compustat stuff). Any suggestions/comments
would be appreciated too."

I am a data architect that specializes in BI (business intelligence) and data
mining. I'd love to join your project.

I recently completed a spreadsheet of 61 stocks (that had been mentioned here
recently) where I pulled some simple measures from Yahoo ("2004-12-23 Price,
Market Cap MM, Enterprise Value MM, Revenue MM, Cash on Hand, Free Cash MM, %
Revenue Growth, Float MM, % Short Interest, % Yield
") and created a simple analytic (revenue/mkt cap) and sorted the spreadsheet.

Not surprisingly, a lot of the Pink sheet "Net-Net" stocks floated to the top
and many of the usual suspects sank to the bottom (SIRI, TZOO, RIMM) but some
surprises showed up.

On the long side - FRD - even after it's current rise to 11.33 this is the
number one value stock on the list (I've posted about the technicals shining on
this one on the 50% gains thread). This one should hit 15 without breathing
hard and a rise to 25 is not out of the question, based on my spreadsheet.

But the next interesting stocks Iin order of my interest in them) were ADGO,
MSHI, CLF, OSTE, AGP, TCOW, SPI, CAI, and IPAS

I like to balance my portfolio with shorts too, though right now I am 100%
long. I'd like to cycle out of some of my longs soon and re-short or short some
of the bottom stocks (as soon as I make sure their businesses are as bad, or as
overvalued as their rankings seem to indicate) like SIRI, TZOO, RIMM, ATCO,
CRXL, CTIC, MLS, SINA).

If anyone is interested in a copy of my spreadsheet, PM me with your email and
I'll send you a copy. Also, If there is any other formula that people like to
use to "find value", I'd be interested in hearing about it.

You all be careful out there,

DRUG STOCKS: "Novartis (NVS) has exhibited strong relative strength
in recent weeks, in spite of the pharma industry's woes. The stock is just
under
its 52-week high of $50.47, something that can't be said for many other
large-cap drug stocks. Novartis has several promising drugs in various stages
of
development including a potential blockbuster blood-pressure drug. Future
growth
in this industry depends on development of new products, and NVS has a total of
79 drug projects in their pipeline, including 61 that are in Phases II, III or
FDA registration. We think these products will fuel NVS' future growth. Last

holds an portfolio in assorted South afrcian gold mining stocks. According to

s however points relentlessly down. One factor that is impacting RANGY (and
other South african mining companies) is the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)
program, that appears to force many companies to sell assets below fair market
value. That does not seem to explain why RANGY is down much more than other

Hi Paul - I sold my ALD selling covered calls and collecting the dividend. I am
skeptical about management and their accounting procedures. The business in
general is interesting and they do generate good fees and even participate in
equity positions in several of the deals they help finance.

This becomes moot if their accounting is suspect IMO. I also noted that the
company issued new debt totaling $325 million (
http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/041118/185418_1.html ). I guess I would like them to
invest more of their capital into the business rather than cranking up their
debt. This new issue paid down a previous line of $102 million but still
increased their total by $224 million.

I will be watching to see if this investigation results in any action. Maybe it
is worth looking at it again if I see that management is upping their buys in
the stock. So far, it appears that they continue to sell shares of stock based
on options they granted themselves at much lower prices.

below its $10.54 book value. They basically are super-efficient at underwriting
& closing mortgages & moving into other loan products. But they’re not making
money. But I still own some shares.

- If you want a stock that’s below book value & making money - look at CSBK &
MIGP - i don’t see how you can lose on either one provided you’re patient -
good luck

CSBK - Clifton Savings Bank in NJ:
as of 9/30/04’s finl’s:
&#183; net inc up to $1.34 mill - which is growing as they apply their ipo
monies (vs. $991k in 2Q04)
&#183; little under 14 mill shs - so $.40 eps annualized. But earnings should
keep growing as ipo proceeds deployed. - which bodes well for raising the .12
annual dividend
&#183; everything is up - including equity - now at $201.9 mill ($201.9 mill/14
mill shs = $14.42 book value per share)
&#183; earnings look legite w/ no 1-time gimmics
&#183; stock at $12.40; book value of $14.42; earnings growing nicely

9/30/04’s finl’s:
MIGP - Mercer Insurance - a broker-underwriter in NJ:
&#183; for 3Q04 - Earnings of $1.1 mill or .17/eps diluted; for 9 monhts - eps
of .38 diluted
&#183; combined ratio is 95.6%
&#183; revs & prem growing about 13% annually
&#183; invest income increase to $639k - vs. $400k last yr - due to ipo monies
&#183; wow - on the buyback - all 250k shs were purchased - only declared on
6/16/04- on 10/20/04 - another 250k authorized
&#183; MIGP is at $13.30; book value over $16 diluted; eps in ’05 should be

Well Paul, you've chosen the shorter production cycle. Chicken broilers go from
hatch to slaughter in about 40 days. Egg layers are in production for about 12
months. (Market adjustment time for the meat birds is actually longer when you
consider broiler hatching egg industry--the "parents" of the birds that are
grown for commercial meat). In both chicken and egg industries, however, the
market adjustment period is pretty quick.

on a fully diluted basis; book value of $201.9 million; and adjusted GAAP book
value of around $14.42/share. From a practical standpoint, Clifton’s 16 mill or
so “MHC” shares are like treasury stock and should not factor into the book
value or earnings per share. These “MHC” shares are owned by Clifton’s parent -
but they don’t receive dividends - and they’re very likely to be issued in a
secondary in a few years - its all part of the bank de-mutualization process -
where the holding company retains 55% of the shares - I don’t fully understand

CSBK: It is sure a very hidden value if people can't figure outstanding shares
even from studying the 10Q, let alone from scanning Yahoo. Company doesn't
report clearly imo, or on a per share basis. Maybe intentionally misleading
readers??
-------
You might be right here, blankmind: I see, "The Company declared its second
cash dividend during the three months ended September 30, 2004. Such dividend
totaled $379,000 and was paid on August 19, 2004." In an Oct. 27 press release,
we have, "the parent company of Clifton Savings Bank, S.L.A., today announced
that the Company will pay a cash dividend of $.03 per share for the quarter
ended September 30, 2004." (I assume the dividend is the same quarter to
quarter.)

$.379M/~14M shares =~ $.027 =~ $.03. So that 3 cents a share dividend sure
looks like it's closer to being based on 14M shares, just as you say blankmind,
than an "apparent" outstanding share base of about 30M.

If those 16M shares are in treasury stock and the company will get cash for
them in a secondary, if it should happen, then imo, the stock, because it's a
bank stock trading below it's book value per share, is undervalued. However,
it's -sigh- very well hidden from potential investors, and it may take a decent
amount of time - maybe years - for value to be recognized and realized.

I'll consider a small exploratory position.

re RANGY
 Precious metals and miners just don't interest me, I'm afraid. 

Dale, i am not a gold bug either. However i do believe that in buying 1$ for
approx. 35 cents. <G> Here is what I get from RANGY's 10Q (all numbers in
Rand):

http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1033217/000095013604003229/file003.htm

27.14 Rand net asset value (per 6/30/04) translates into 4.8 US$/share. ADR to
South african share conversion rate is 1:1. The bulk of RANGY's stock holding
are in Randgold Resources (Ticker: Gold) which is up since 6/30/04

Almost looks too good to be true, I admit. If somebody finds a catch (beyond
the management issues and a major shareholder selling out of a swap) I would
like to know. Right now it looks to me that I am buying 4.8$/share in assets
for 1.68$.

CSBK seems like a bad choice to me.

Paul – in an earlier post you said “Yeah, took me a while to find outstanding
shares. I get (11/12/04 10-Q) "30,530,470 shares issue and outstanding".

If so, based on the way I look at it - and that's just me - a buyer pays a high
price (price/book) for what he/she gets (ROA) from this bank. I'll pass.”

First off, can I recommend “Yahoo Key statistics” page.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=csbk
I find it useful and it only took 20 seconds to come up with nearly the same
number you came up with.

In data mining, accuracy is less important than consistency. I find this page
gives me the ability to compare stocks and perform a reasonable first pass that
can help me prioritize where my energies can most appropriately be applied.

Here’s my quick assessment of CSBK:
1. The revenue to Market Cap ratio is 0.07253 – BAD signal. I don’t like to go
long anything when this ratio is less than 1.0
2. The Market Cap is 377.05 – GOOD signal. I prefer to invest in smaller
companies with Market Caps under 2 Billion (Lynch principle number 1)
3. The Revenue growth is -12% – VERY BAD signal. I prefer to invest in
companies that are expanding, not contracting, I prefer companies who are
growing at 20% or more (Lynch principle number 2)
4. The Earnings growth is -29.3% – BAD signal. I can be more forgiving of
negative earnings growth than I am of negative Revenue growth. I prefer
companies who are growing profits at 20% or more (Lynch principle number 2)
5. The float is 30.2MM shares – Seems a little high for this small a company.
BAD signal.
6. The % Held by Insiders is 1.08% - VERY BAD signal. It looks like no one at
this company has any skin in the game. I like it when my interests and
management’s interests coincide.
7. Comparison with other stocks I follow says this stock is a weak short, not a
long – BAD signal. I follow stocks that people recommend on the Value thread
and on the 50% gains thread. These should be mostly longs so it is possible
that some longs could slip into the short half of the portfolio, but I prefer
to go long on the top half of my watch list. BTW, this stock seems to be a
worse long than RIMM, a stock I have shorted in the past.
8. MACD trend is currently downward – This says the timing might be bad to buy.

Paul, I respect your opinion and use you as a model for how to do long term
value investing. I am admittedly bad at momentum and day trading though I do
find them to be seductive if unprofitable. I am currently working on
transitioning my investment style to the value method you espouse. I’m an
engineer and I’d like to find a quantitative way of selecting candidates that
can help remove most of the emotion around a potential stock. I’d like to hear
whether the indicators I’ve listed above seem important to you. Also, what
indicators would you suggest?

You all be careful out there,

CSBK isn't a pissing contest for me.

I just want to evaluate it without the emotion you seem to have. Personally, I
think its good to be happy about a potential stock, but don't become closed to
other people's opinions. Hey, address the concerns I had and I'll invest too.

I think my biggest concern is the -12% shrinking revenue that Yahoo indicates.
Is this true? What's causing it? When will it be reversed? Float isn't
everything.

My second biggest concern is the revenue to Market Cap ratio. Even with the
lowered Market Cap of 183.9MM indicated by cutting the float to 15MM (which is
a little fuffy to me BTW) and using the revenue of 27.35MM this gives a revenue
to Market Cap ratio of 0.1487 - still well below the 1.0 that I use as my
threshold for a risky long.

Any stock price increase makes the revenue to Market Cap ratio worse unless
revenue is rising, which it isn't.

Am I missing something here?

You all be careful out there,

Cleveland-Cliffs Announces Amendment to ISG Pellet Contract
Thursday December 30, 3:07 pm ET

CLEVELAND, Dec. 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF)
today announced that it has entered into an amendment to its major Pellet Sale
and Purchase Agreement with International Steel Group Inc., for pellet
deliveries to ISG Cleveland and ISG Indiana Harbor through 2016.

The Company stated that it has been working with ISG to amend the pellet
contract for several months to mitigate Cliffs' exposure to future steel price
volatility. The amendment significantly raises the base price for pellets, to
better reflect current market rates, and moderates the steel price sharing
provision accordingly. Beginning in 2005 the base pellet price will be equal to
the price under the original agreement as if certain ISG hot band steel prices
equaled $400 per ton. In addition, the hot band steel price threshold at which
Cliffs' pellet price will escalate has been increased to $400 per ton. Cliffs
will receive approximately 75% of the benefit of steel pricing above $400 under
the amendment as compared to the original agreement.

Commenting on the amendment, John S. Brinzo, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, said, "We are very pleased to have reached this mutually beneficial
agreement with ISG. Since entering into the long-term sales agreement with ISG
in 2002, the industry's landscape was changed dramatically. This amendment
essentially updates the pricing mechanisms to better reflect the current
environment. We have successfully decreased our exposure to potential decreases
in hot band steel prices and maintained potential upside."

Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is the largest producer
of iron ore pellets in North America and sells the majority of its pellets to
integrated steel companies in the United States and Canada. The Company
operates six iron ore mines located in Michigan, Minnesota and Eastern Canada.

Ray Rueb: Your post requires a detailed response. I hate when that happens -g-

I'll try to be brief.

I like simple quantitative and heuristic methods which aid in selecting stocks.
Stuff that's easy and quick, and that on-average, result in successful
investments. My objective is not to reduce the emotion surrounding the purchase
or holding of a stock: The emotion is always there - at least for me.

I accept that there are conflicting analytical tools.
An objective for me would be select from such methods so as to enable me to
INCLUDE a stock in a portfolio - which is different from using these methods to
discard or eliminate a stock from consideration. In other words, if one method
might reject a stock, but by another equally relevant method, it looks like a
buy, I will go with the buy.

It seems to me that one will do better analyzing a particular business by
methods that are most appropriate (however defined) for that business. For
banks, I am led to believe there are a couple of key metrics - efficiency ratio
and roa. I focus on roa because it's simple to find (Yahoo) and easily tracked
over several years, and it seems to work mostly okay.

Apparently Bloomberg tracks prices paid in takeovers vs. total assets of the
acquired bank. Using Bloomberg data collection up until 2003, apparently CSBK
is too expensive to be an attractive candidate at current price and assets.
However, my Bloomberg info. is out of date - prices paid have gone up. My
point: here we have a possibly negative metric for CSBK, one I choose to ignore
(at my risk of course -g-).

Assuming roa is important, then what's needed is a way to evaluate various
roa's. That is, if Bank X has an roa of .6% (lousy) vs. Bank Y of 1.5% (good),
we still need to figure if it's X or Y (or neither or both) that are bargain
priced. Those roa figures have to be put in context.

We can discuss this further, but for CSBK there's a trump card, and that is, if
we're correct, the stock is selling below book value (~14M shares outstanding).
That rarely happens with bank stocks, esp. profitable ones, and so it is a buy.
(A buy for me, anyway. Again, I already have a diverse portfolio with many
bank/bank-related stocks, and so I'm not talking about making CSBK 5% of a
portfolio. Seems to me though I ought to be able to hold on to a few shares of
CSBK for a couple of years to see what develops.)

Another trump card would be if we saw significant amounts of insider buying at
current or higher prices. (Lots of insider ownership could be a positive too,
although for small banks, one might wonder for whose benefit the bank might be
run.)

All jmo. I am not an expert in analyzing bank stocks. And I have been wrong
many, many times.

with all due respect to your experience/knowledge as a CPA and bank auditor, i
think you are misunderstanding the structure of CSBK

the MHC is not part of the bank, it is a shareholder...as such, if its shares
were sold to the public, the proceeds would not go to the bank, they would go
to the MHC

those shares do "count," even though the MHC may not receive dividends

i own OSHC and ACFC, which have similar structures, and the MHC shares are
counted in the outstanding shares, and in calculations of things such as EPS
and book value per share

here is the prospectus for OSHC, which lays out the structure following the
offering:

re RANGY stock swap -
it appears the stock swap with Aflease is a reason why RNAGY has turned south.
Apparently Aflease is selling the Randgold stocks they received putting
pressure on the stock. The value of Aflease assets is unclear to me. The
uranium assets sound interesting. As I suspected RANGY is a dog with a few
fleas but nothing so far t let's me reconsider my position. It is obvious that
there is very little interest in this obscure stock, not even from the
goldbucks. Information is hard to get, which means that quantitative value
screeners might miss this stock. In my view at least, this is a strong
positive. I hope I don't sound like a pumper here <g>.

Losing money (cash burn) is usually the first reason for a stock to drop below
net liquidation value.

I don't know if TFS will become profitable.

I like those stocks because every investors know those issues and that's why
they dropped so low. Those cash burns, lawsuits, other negative news had
already priced in the stock.

The trick is to figure if management already started to cut cost under
shareholders pressure (sometimes insiders if they own a lot of shares), if
their assets and infrastructure still have value. I probably won't buy a
textile factory in US, but if this is a state of art manufacturing plant in
China (and other low-cost Asia countries) can make millions of TFT screens for
small gadgets like cell phones, I think they have a good chance since it will
cost other people more money to duplicate their business.

Value investing is about buying deeply undervalued stocks that other investors
are scared and don't want to buy, and with a basket of those stocks to provide
margin of saftey.

Schzamm and Madharry - when i bought ibn RANGY was aware that management was
not considered the most capable but i was not aware that Kebble may be a thug.
There are issues and issues - i can live with a certain lack of capability but
as an investor i stay away fro dishonesty. With respect to RANGY, I was not
that the most valuable asset, RANGY's stake in Randgold was pledged almost in
an under the table transaction, for assets that are impossible to value. That
together with a fact that Kebble is accused of plundering DRD (another gold
company he has been involved in) for 35M Rand does it to me. Sounds too much
like "The Godfathers" to me and Kebbles portrait fit's right in.

I lost a good chunk of money in 2002 and swore to my self that quality
paramounts valuation for my own investments going forward. FWIW I am ahead
around 18% this year, far more than I expected. i could have done better, if I
had not allocated a good chunk of my portfolio to large caps that have not done
much - but on the other hand i avoided major losses as well. Again thanks for

Eric and Paul, thanks for the great article - "THE EVOLUTION OF THE IDEA OF
“VALUE INVESTING”: FROM BENJAMIN GRAHAM TO WARREN BUFFETT"
(http://www.econ.duke.edu/Journals/DJE/dje2000/bierig.PDF)

It was indeed a great read. It said the first $200-300M Warren Buffett made was
based on Ben Graham's original below-net-current-asset approach. He then
expanded "value" to include intangibles such as American Express name brand
when it was invovled in the salad oil scandal. I personally think that
departure was mainly due to his fund size - once he passed $500M, he can no
longer buy those most-deeply-undervalued stocks because he can not deploy
enough capital in those micro or small cap stocks to justify the research cost,
he had to buy bigger firms. The other factor added to his success was his name,
after he got famous, he can quietly buy a 5% position, then release the news
that he had it, there are always enough people willing to buy just because
Buffett just bought it, a self propelling process.

For small not-so-famous investor like us (at least me), I think my best bet is
still the Ben Graham style - not exactly 66% below net-current-asset, but the
bottom layer of below (or near) net-current-asset stocks, the lower the better,
plus a diversified basket to reduce risk. My past experience definitely gave me
great confidence in that approach, my portfolio #1 based on that approach with
no margin, no options, returned over 200% in 2003, and 20.5% in 2004. In March
of 2004 I happened to launch another portfolio (call it #2), since I can not
find deeply undervalued stocks, I wander off the road and used market timing,
it lost about 5% in 2004. Now I had faithfully gone back to value investing
with both portfolios, and the deeply undervalued positions (CIEN@2.4, TFS@1.92,
PRCS@1.8, INFO@1.55, IBPI@3.85, total 13 stocks) made me very happy and
confident. Use Whitney Tilson's word - I am "trembling with greed". This group
of 13 stocks was up about 6% in December, and I believe it may beat the indices
by a wider margin in Jan 2005.

Once we discovered those stocks, sharing with fellow value investors is a
helpful approach. Many people may not like it, but some may. I am not sure if
anyone took another look at TFS after I mentioned it here a month ago at $1.87,
and other people received my emails regarding it took notice. But the 25% jump
on nearly 4M shares in last week definitely say some people (probably never
know me) found TFS undervalued and willing to buy it.

Wish all value investors a highly profitable 2005!

Hello Steve,
it seems that you are disappointed with the reception of your value picks.
Don't let this prevent you from sharing your ideas here! We all have our
different approaches to value investing and critize freely. I for myself am not
offended by critizism and change my opinion frequently based on input i receive
from others.

For me many discussions here, like those on the Pietrosky screen/score were
very inspirational. With respect to the WEB's Graham approach, i believe that
your are partly right partly wrong. Clearly Munger taught warren about the
value of intangible assets. When you read Hagstroms book about WEB your find
Hagstrom going through great lengths to explain how intangibles were increasing
in value during times of inflation. on the other hand it is almost certain that
WEB did not find enough net net stocks due to the size of his portfolio.
Anyways my key learning is that what works in the past is a guide to the future
but no more. it is almost certain for example that the good result of
Pietrosky's screen have gained attention of the value investors which means
that this results will most certainly not have the outstanding results in the
future that they showed in the past. So i think every winning strategy needs to
be tweaked to gain an advantage compared to the rest of the market.
