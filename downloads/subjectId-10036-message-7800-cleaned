CSE hedgers, has anything in analysis of deal closure expectations changed? CSE
has dipped below 47 which is about a 19% return to 55 buyout.

Probably nothing has changed. However, when the market takes a hit the
perceived risk of the deal getting called off increases and some of the people
who bought CSE for the few points find it a convenient source of funds that has
not declined in value to buy something that now offers a better return.
Therefore you have some natural pressure on CSE.

RE:CSE

07/20 07:27 CASE SEES $0.50 NEGATIVE IMPACT TO 99 FOR LOW EQUIPMENT DEMAND IN
N.AMERICA

RACINE, Wis., July 20 (Reuters) - Farming and construction equipment maker Case
Corp. <CSE.N> reported on Tuesday that second-quarter net income fell 71
percent on weak demand for big agricultural equipment, and said the slump will
lead to more production cuts.

Case earned $36 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, including costs
associated with its planned merger with European competitor New Holland NV
<NH.N>, compared with $126 million, or $1.61, a year ago. Earnings were a penny
above the analysts' consensus estimate, according to First Call Corp., which
tracks such estimates.

Second-quarter revenues fell to $1.47 billion from $1.73 billion in the
year-ago quarter, and operating earnings were $83 million, down from $199
million a year ago. Earnings were hit by lower sales of large equipment and
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, the company said.

The company has been hit hard for the past several quarters by plunging demand
for farm equipment, . . .

The New Holland deal remains on track to close later this year, Case said.

Case shares rose 6 cents to $47 Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

Re: Case, I still maintain the biggest risk is not that the deal is
called off, but rather that it is delayed. The latest proxy has been filed with
the SEC yesterday. I can't access it, but a poster on Yahoo suggests that it
says the timetable for completion has been pushed back to Dec/Jan despite a
planned vote Aug 17th. How the CEO can get away with claiming publicly in a
press release (which they didn't have to issue) that completion would be before
October is beyond me. Disappointed, but I'm loaded to the gills, and still
can't find a reason to sell it. I may even buy more.

Mike:

The biggest risk is a reduction in the buyout price followed by a delay in
consummating the deal (imo) Assume that the info on Yahoo is true and the deal
is delayed from oct to jan. The three month time premium risk alone would
reduce the present value by about 1.5% depending on your yield instruments.
Obviously the market has priced in some "deal flexibility" as they expect the
deal price to be reduced or delayed.

Question, since Case has a relatively high debt load, New Hollands will
probably roll over to New Holland debt (other option payoff=unlikely) If it is
rolled over, the bond holders will want a premium no doubt for their trouble.
This alone increases time risk (negotiation time) and possible the takeover
premium as I am unsure how NH is accounting for this in the 4.3 billion. What
are your thoughts ? thanks

Wow. I was pissed when Case broke 46 and I bailed. Thought that at that point
the spread would be too obvious and must be indicative of something gone wrong.
I had a huge position, and decided to let go at 45 15/16. I was sure it would
end up closing up and I'd be regretting the sale. Can't believe my eyes where
it is now. But relieved at adhering to my stop (which I never thought it'd
reach). Ouch, ouch, ouch. This is the first and last arbitrage play to burn my
fingers.

Now I have a ton of cash. Bought Mesaba Holdings with 1/4 of it, which controls
tiny Mesaba airlines. Tiny, but without debt, highly profitable, with great
return and growth numbers despite tiny multiples across the board. It's an
airline, and while its ultimate growth may be limited, it's 5-year growth line
appears reasonably assured. And at current multiples I think that's all I need.
CEO recently left, took an exec with him, and there was a labor dispute. All

Mike, please don't give up on arbitrage because this one hurt you a bit. Go
back to the reason we sold our NH, or at least why I did. They grossly overpaid
for CSE. Conceptually, buying this arbitrage may have gone against your reason
for selling NH?

NH may slowly be waking up to the fact that it overpaid and be trying to
renegotiate the deal, because of "worse than expected results".
CSE, in my opinion, would have little alternative to taking a price cut. This
is what today's action is saying, in my opinion -- a $5-10
price cut. (The drop is way too big for a delay in closing.)

You may regret bailing on Case, you may not. I stayed with it, figuring on
probabilities of x for closure at $55 a share, y for a renegotiated price in
the mid-high 40s, and z for New Holland slinking away and Case falling to $30
before you can get out.

I cover airlines professionally, though I don't know Mesaba well (I don't do
small cap airlines). Tell my why you would believe that , <<it's 5-year growth
line appears reasonably assured.>> That sounds like no airline I've ever
encountered. If I'm going to do airlines - and that's a big if - I stick to
AMR, backed by the asset value of Sabre (close to $40 per AMR share), a share
buyback, and the best management in the business except for Southwest (which
trades at 3x the multiple of AMR with Sabre backed out).

Jim,

Ok, so let me clarify: TODAY I don't regret bailing on Case just under 46. I
have a lot of cash to put to use. We'll see how it turns out the day Case
closes for cash. I guess rumor is that everyone's selling because the stock is
falling, and there's no news. That's why I sold. So then I might lose.

You don't DO small cap airlines? Why oh why not? Because the biggest airlines
are mature and cycle-driven. The smallest are not mature, and have wind at
their backs, so to speak. SO if you can find a pretty safe niche, you can
reasonably project growth in the face of cycles. Mesaba is beholden to
Northwest. Mesaba's very well-run, or has been. Great numbers. Great returns.
$4/share in cash. No debt. Very cash flow positive thanks to its sweetheart
arrangement with NW. The biggest risk here is the agreement with NW going to
pot.

jeffrey: I agree but would go further than that.

I'm not saying I believe it, but the Italians are commonly held to negotiate in
the manner possibly exhibited here. They have greater patience and
Mediterranean guile than the dumb, direct Americans.

1. They have an opportunity to learn a hell of a lot about Case, whether or not
a deal closes.
2. In the meanwhile, they cause some disruption to a competitor.
3. Once they're in discussions, they are in. With the known future to be
declining sales, they are well aware renegotiation is an option.

The Americans thought they were getting a great price. The Italians thought
they locked up a deal at whatever price works for them after 18 months of
negotiations. The pace of life is different. Italians have survived a long time
- they're no fools. And the Case offer was foolish on the face of it, as you
all recognized immediately.

Anyway, go ahead and shoot holes in the theory. I'm just glad I didn't buy that

Beneficiaries of the greeting card shift are manufacturers of computer

It is interesting that what this shift boils down to is a shift of printing
capability toward the end user, enabled by the extremely high cost of greeting
cards. Note that if you want to use paper with a colored design (like pretty
clouds) for some purpose, it still does pay to buy it in the store, because the
quality is better and the cost is considerably less per sheet than the per

I agree with Jeffrey that Gibson (sorry no flame bait intended) is a dog. IMO
another good analogy can be drawn with "value" Stock FranklinCovey. As
consulting business goes South, their day planner printing becomes a commodity
business fistfight with DayRunner and other lower priced competitors, while a
new tool, Palm Pilots and other handhelds, devour market share. I am SO glad I
passed on FC while it was around 20. Similarly, Gibson is losing market share
to bigger competitors and new medium of PC cards made with software and/or

Of the beneficiaries mentioned above, Microsoft will surely make you money, as
will Dell, Gateway, or thoughtful investments in ISPs (AOL, but don;t ask me to

course they do not meet the "value"/"net net"/trading below book value etc.

CSE: from thestreet.com

Among individual issues, Case (CSE:NYSE) call options rebounded Thursday after
a rumor circulated the previous trading session that arbitragers were afraid
its $55-a-share buyout by New Holland (NH:NYSE) wouldn't go through. Late
Wednesday, Case shares fell to 44 1/2, down 2 15/16, and the August 45 and
September 45 call prices collapsed. August 45 calls fell 1 1/4 ($125) to 1 3/4
($175) and September 45 calls fell 1 11/16 ($168.75) to 2 7/16 ($243.75).

By Thursday, however, those prices had rebounded to 2 1/2 ($250) and 3 3/8
($337.50) respectively. The farm equipment company's stock price was back up 2
3/8 to 46 1/8. "I think there were some inexperienced traders in the market,"
says Paul Foster with 1010WallStreet.com in Chicago. "Ultimately, we believe

I'm looking for somebody on this thread who knows more about health care than
me - i.e. somebody who's been to a doctor in the last ten years, or somebody
who is a doctor...Mike!

Anybody looking at Steris (STE)? On the surface, looks like a razor-blade
model. They lead the market for instrument sterilization systems. As I picture
it from reading the 10-K, doctors across the country have this thing in their
office that they sterizile their instruments in, and Steris makes money on the
goo they sterilize it with. Then they buy more goo and Steris makes more money.
Their return on equity is very high, but the last quarter showed only 6% growth
and the stock tanked. Can anybody help me fill in this picture? The stock
trades at 15 times earnings, way below its historical multiple. I know, not the
typical JJC stock, but I'm intrigued by the business model.

On more typical JJC stocks, LKI has retraced its gain from 11 1/2 back down to
near 9. That's a buy below 9. And Clayton is looking very weak, but I don't
care because I think I know roughly what the company is worth ($16-22) and I
consider management simply excellent. Clayton is a buy below 14 (It currently
trades at 10 1/2 and is falling 1/8 a day as everybody is worried about the
coming quarterly announcement.) I have absolutely no intention of selling my
shares, and am looking to scrape together some cash to buy more. If there are
any Mattel fans out there, the conference call today was lame, so I still think
you will get another shot at 22-23.

with Barbie and and went down with the same ship. Did not imply that she had
what it would take to transform and redesign this company. I would probably buy
Delta if I were buying an airline. Having used Priceline I realize that the
major benefit is to Delta as it allows it to segment its market more and thus
increase profitability.

I sold the balance of THQI perhaps prematurely, just did not like the sell off

shares, and 296 mil. DD shares are tendered, you will receive (200 X .5) X 2.95
COC-B shares. 100 DD shares would come back to you.
Coc-B WI currently trades at about 26, DD 71, so 2.95 X 26 = 76.7, there looks
to be an arb opportunity here. How to take advantage of it? The only visible
difference between the A & B is that B has 5 votes, A one.
1) Buy 500 DD, sell short 1475 COC (you can't short the COC-B WI), tender the
DD, then cover the COC post Aug. 6, when the deal will be done, and sell the
COC-B you will receive. Risks: B & A diverge significantly post tender, B lower
than A (actually IMHO B should trade slightly higher than A because of 5-1
voting ratio). Another very real risk (almost assured IMHO) is
oversubscription, whereby you will need to cover more shares than you are
receiving. If COC goes up post tender, not good.
2) Buy COC-B WI, feeling that it will bridge the gap post tender.
3) Sell short DD for the reverse reason in 3). Unlikely because of shares out
of DD IMHO.
Comments, thoughts, etc., I'm also going to try to find an arb thread on SI.

Armin, you are absolutely right about ALSC being an absolutely steal at this
price! It now has a 60 million stake in BRCM as well as a 580+ stake in UMC vs.
just a paltry 300 million market cap. I often regret the fact for not having
bought more BRCM when it was cheap and that I completely missed the move in
Taiwan Semiconductor (and other foundry players). Now, I have the chance to
participate in both of these sectors via ALSC! Not only that, in the latest
company's press release, it said that it's going to invest 7 million in
high-tech startups during the 2nd qtr, which makes it a CMGI (okay, it's a bit
exaggerated) for semiconductor-related startups. Furthermore, you get its core
business of DRAMs and SRAMs (though it's not worth much) for free. What a
steal! BTW, did they miss expectations? Is that why the the shares plummeted
today?

I have one question though. The latest press release states that ALSC will
record an unrealized AFTER-TAX gain of ~$60 million. However, its holding of
480,000 shares of BRCM (7/22: $125) only translate to ~$60 million. Wouldn't
Uncle Sam take a piece of this if and when ALSC decides to unload its position?
Why doesn't the balance sheet take into account this fact?

Peter, on ALSC, note the latest earnings release. The weighted average lockup
period for the whole UMC block is 1.75 years in this notoriously volatile
industry. The $585 million current valuation should be given some haircuts - at
least the private placement haircut (of a public company) which is locked up
for a year (subject to 144 rules), the haircut of a disproportionately large,
foreign, stock investment on someone else's balance sheet not your own.

I do not think this is nearly as cheap as GZSP was at 3 5/8, but bears
watching. The key question is whether we would pay $300 million for a
crummy $60 million business with a retained earnings deficit, plus
$600+ million of restricted stock assets. My feeling is it is at fair value or

Jim,

Wondering if you could give "doing" small cap airlines a try and tell me why
Mesaba is a bad investment?

BTW, I bought back into Case at nearly what I sold it for (46 1/16 vs 45 15/16.
That there are now two press releases put out by NH/Fiat indicating a close by
October is very significant to me. I tried to believe the first one as the
stock fell. But now that they've come out and reiterated, and did so because
the stock price was getting out of hand, I'm more comfortable. There's an
article in the current Barron's on how many risk arbitrageurs are taking a
break, and how current spreads are at historically high levels due to the lack
of interest in arbitrage. No mention of Case.

Speaking of medical stocks, starting to delve into Hanger Orthopedics (HGR). I
think their massive acquisition is causing buyers to shy away unjustifiably.
Prosthetics and orthotics can be a lucrative business with historically good
reimbursements. And they are a consolidator in a fragmented industry. They have
always been mom-and-pop (or father-and-son) shops, but now Hangar is
consolidating, with large scale centralized manufacturing that the industry
hasn't seen before. Thanks to high speed autos, construction, farming,
diabetes, and longer lifespans, the industry can grow at least 5%. And I don't
think it can be obsoleted with ease. Still evaluating it myself.

their worth in NCES alone. The next quarter will look ugly due to sweeping

IMHO, sales and earnings most certainly will take a haircut in the short term,

NY footwear. The Dockers for women line will be introduced for the fall sales
season, and I'm hoping this will be a positive for the company, and take up
some of the slack. I'm also hoping that the negatives have been priced in to
the stock, which is trading significantly below its 52 week high. Also wouldn't

On MAXS, I was afraid you would say that. Using round numbers, the gross margin

NINEWEST BUSINESS WAS MUCH LESS PROFITABLE THAN AVERAGE, a loss of 25% of sales
will reduce gross margin and pretax income by about $3 million per quarter,
NEARLY WIPING OUT EARNINGS!

It is reasonable to expect that the gross margin on this business might be less
than average to the extent of license payments, but I am not sure.

Geez, Jeffrey, calm down - you might want to lose the caps!! I'm taking a

This is small cap speculation pure and simple. I bought the stock fully aware
that the JNY business was history, that sales and earnings would be
significantly down. I also bought a company with over $5 per share in cash and
no debt selling at $9 down from $23 a little over a year ago, thus valuing
what's left at about 4 bucks/share, or 35 million and change. Remaining sales
are I figure between 12 and 13 bucks/share.
I've mentioned the buyback possibility, there is also the possibility of the
company acquiring other brands to make up for the JNY sales. Who knows, Dockers
may be a huge hit. I don't think I've got a Chap. 11 on my hands here, and the
risk/reward is appealing to me with the cash cushion.

My take is that MAXS is in the business of designing, developing, marketing.
The management team is experienced in dealing with women's shoes. To me, the
lost business is of similar consequence to sales lost because of changing
fashion trends. So I think the management team should be able to recover from
the diminution in business. Especially as they've got a lot of cash -- enough
to overcome any dry spell. Of course, MAXS is speculative, but with the odds in
one's favor -- that's my opinion anyway. But one only ought to purchase this

with stock falling to 30. If one were to sell 3 csemh(jan 40 puts) at 3.5 as
alternative to buying 100 shares at 46.5 the expected values would be as
follows:
Stock .5*8.5+.4*-1.5+.1*-16.5=2
Puts .5*10.5+.4*10.5+.1*-19.5=7.5
You can put in your own probabilities and determine your own risk
characteristics as to leverage but selling puts is an excellent alternative
strategy. Also 3 puts only require 1650 cash.

Paul/Mike:

Actually, the problem is waaaay overcapacity in the industry and a lack of new
applications making it difficult to justify large increases in hard drive
capacities.
As to Mikes thoughts about replacing WDC with SEG, I would be careful. When
everyone (or nearly everyone) in the industry preannounces at a time when unit
growth (computers) is still double digits, what happens when computer growth
slows. (ie overcapacity becomes intolerable even to the "bigger fish")

It should be pretty apparent that the growth in required hard drive storage
capacity as well as the growth in computer ram has leveled off. ie The largest
unit growth segment is in the commodity pcs (or low cost/"free" computers) well
part of what makes them "free or low cost" has to do with maxing out in the
32-48mb dram, 4g drives, cheaper amd or celeron processors and a lack of
applications which require big imprvoements in the above.

As a point of reference, my P90 with a 2g drive and 32mb or dram is fine for
all of my current home and business needs. I dont know about you , but my
biggest complaint is my internet bottleneck which a faster processor, bigger
harddrive or more dram would do little to help. fwiw

$2.4/sh (per Yahoo). Book value over $10 1/2. During the past 6 years, they've
had 2 losing years. But they can make better than 15% ROE in the good years.
Stock is trading just a little lower than its usual psr values. (So not so
great a bargain based on relative psr.) Company is profitable (so far -g-) with
.27 earnings 1Q '99, down from .48 in '98 (attribituted to lower munition
sales).
As of March 31, working capital was $37.6M. Market cap for this thinly-traded
stock is about $27M. So it's a net-net. I see two significant areas in
reviewing Yahoo news: a group of dissident shareholders is trying to take

I won't buy it. Why? As I was leaving the OR today I took some time to look
around. Yes, I washed my hands with Steris soap. Yes, the equipment is here.

But there's something else. A little flier on a board that I rarely stop to
read. Listing all the trials that they are doing with different products.
Trying to switch suture brands. Glove brands. Soap brands. Even different
equipment brands. And at the end of each entry was something to the effect of
"We will save $xx,xxx per year if we switch." They are willing to switch this
or that to save literally $30,000/year. In an enterprise that does $300M/year.
I learned different types of suture by their brand names. When I want a 4-0
Vicryl, it was like I didn't even know that was a brand name. It was just what
it was. Now it's going to be something else. I can't remember the name.

Brand names carry no power in this environment. And hence IMO ROE that even for
ten years or longer has been stable is now in danger if it belongs to a medical
supply or equipment company. Really, no one is going to cry when the Steris
soap in the bathroom is changed to something else. And the cost-cutting will
hit the bathroom.

Over time, it will play out this way. And instead of fancy dinners persuading
physicians and hospital admin to buy this or that, it will be the bottom line.
I think this is coming to a head now (not that the pressure will subside) in
the medical equipment/supplies arena, and disasters will occur in big names.

With Steris you are buying a name and a brand. And products. But if the
products can be duplicated by a no-name, this is going to become a hard road.
It appears undervalued by current numbers. But remember how much of the stock
value is carried in that post-10 year residual value? Well, that is part that
is very shaky.

Ambac would be a fresh money add for me in the mid-50s too if I had any fresh

Concord Fabrics - CIS About two months ago I said I'd post a net-net that I
thought was a no-brainer. It is very thinly traded, so naturally I didn't want
to post it until I had bought it. As it turned out, I tried to purchase the
stock for about a week but the market maker never hit my bid. I was holding out
for that extra 16th at 4 3/4, then the stock moved away from me. Got taken over
today for $7 3/4 a share. Never bought the stock. As Homer Simpson would
say...DOH!

Apparently ALSC was touted on CNBC today with an asset value of $21. I believe
that IDTC may now be looked at as a potential value play if you accept the
valuation of its internet spin-off NTOP. Today's price on IDTC I believe is an
anamoly. Suggest you do you due dilligence and invest today if possible.

Do you have any idea why IDTC started dropping rapidly when NTOP started
trading? Might people have been expecting NTOP to trade at a
higher price? This is hardly an unknown story to Wall Street -- anyone who read
the NTOP prospectus knows that IDTC was an alternate way to play NTOP. Why do
you see this price as an anomaly?

The New York Stock Exchange is going to go public, a guy shoots his family
because he quit his job to be a day trader and lost his shirt, the market
trades at the highest valuation in history, and short term interest rates are
rising...hmm.

I shorted some Citigroup today. I would have done the whole list if the market
wasn't down 250 points.

I'm thinking the buy the dips crowd bids things up for the first hour at least
tomorrow. I intend to take the opportunity to short some of these:
Providian (PVN)
Amazon (AMZN)
Circuit City (CC)
The Globe.com (TGLO)
Goldman Sachs (GS)
Sunbeam (SOC)

I'll have a bigger list by tomorrow, because I'm sure I am going to have some
trouble shorting some of these. But this is my line in the sand. I think the
end comes in the next three months. And it kills me to think I would be fully
invested when it happens even though I have been calling it for two years now.
These aren't naked shorts - I've got a stock portfolio that I won't sell
backing them. I just want to be at least market neutral for the rest of the
year.

Yeah, Jim's semiannual market call. Last year at this time I was dead on right
at the peak. I raised a lot of cash and bought a house with it. In February I
sold half my portfolio and everything I sold went up 50%. After that debacle I
said I'd never do it again, but I firmly believe, as I have for the last year,
that I am looking at a historical extreme that will go down in the history
books for a century along with 1929 and the early 1970s (1987 was nothing
compared to those).

What has changed is the final piece of the puzzle. Rising short term interest
rates. That is what was missing from the bear case last year. Both in 1929 and
1987, investors ignored the first increase in interest rates. When the second
one came it was too late.

Owning a portfolio of stocks, I intend to short stocks with leverage to the
market (beta). I make this move because the risk of being wrong and market
neutral is much less than the risk of being right and fully invested.

I'm sure there will be some other opinions on this. Bring it on.

Love your calls Jim. Takes guts. Even though I know the market is heading down,
I can't say it won't head up again and stop me out of any shorts. I'm staying
fully invested and long in undervalued stocks. Today I was down about 0.6% when
all the indices were down 2+%. It is the exception when I outperform on the
good days, but I always outperform on the down days. I'll take that.

Yes, very nice pick on CIS. Your winning streak is intact for picking these
net-nets. For me, I seem to have faltered on my last two choices.

I do remember noting something I didn't understand about your not making the
buy though. First, let me say, that ultimately it's about what a person does
buy, not what a person doesn't buy.

As I recall you screen for net-nets and then analyze them to pick the the few
that really look good to you. Just guessing here, but I'd bet you do some
pretty thorough dd and thinking to get to that one or two choices. Not a big
deal for you- that's your job. (not implying it's an easy thing to do). But it
does take some of your valuable time. (All are assumptions here by me.)

So, given the stock @ $4.75 and given that you're a new family man, and
assuming free cash is scarce, and assuming there's risk in the thing anyway--
I'd guessed, with no facts behind it, we were talking about a buy of 1000 sh.,
maybe 500. Given it was a no-go because of a teenie, the buy swung on $62.50
for $4,750 (1000 sh) or $31.25 on 500 shs. Jim, for all the work you did, you
wouldn't step up for $31.50?
Or even conider opening a smaller position to add to later? Man, you are one
tough cookie when it comes to getting your price!

'Course, I really did no better. I wouldn't've spent the research time, but I
wasn't even ambitious or alert or smart enough to see to start a small position
myself.

Oh well, c'est la guerre.

You got it. And I got it too. Thanks for rubbing it in. YES I MISSED A $2000
GAIN IN 2 MONTHS BECAUSE I HELD OUT FOR $50 (1/8 on a x00 share trade). Stupid
in hindsight, but at the time it looked like I had all the time in the world to
buy the stock. It is very important to me though that this one hit, though I
didn't make money on it. It gives me confidence that my methodology is sound.
Now it is 6 out of 6 in the last three years, with the standard being a net-net
with something extra based on extensive due diligence that goes up more than
30% within 6 months of the buy (I think 4 out of the six were more than 50%). I
bought the other five. And as I have said before, I find one of these every six
months. But recently, given the track record, I have begun to look for them
systematically. I'll throw out four I am following, but I decided not to buy at
this time. Out of a list of 120 net-nets, I found these among the most
interesting: MTIN, ISAC, MPAAE, ADGO and FIT. If you want to buy a net-net, I
will say again, look at LKI next time it goes below net-net value of 9 1/2 (it
was there three days ago). That is 25% of my portfolio, average cost 8. I'd
love to hear any feedback.

Ben is Smiling in his Grave (not because of my net-nets. but because I am
shorting stocks)

James:

appreciate your list. I may add a few comments. Anyone short most of these
stocks would have thrown in the towell. Even though they are pricey I would
consider buying longer term puts on these stocks unless you can stomach the
volatility if one increases by 30%. I have PVN short in my portfolio. I opted
for EBAY vs AMZN as EBAY (imo) does not have a workable business model, whereas
amzn can fool the investors with "growth at any price" model & the lack of
proftiablity is already priced in the stock <g>

Notably lacking from your portfolio seemed to be some of the tech stocks - such
as semi mfgs or computer (i consider commodity excetp maybe apple) mfgs.

My initial position is about a third of what I'm prepared to commit - enough to

at Legg Mason made WMI one of his top positions on the sell off to 33-34, so
I'm feelin' not too dumb, if 26 is just another mark on the way down.
