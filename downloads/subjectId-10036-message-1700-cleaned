Ron: Re insurance co's. Looking at FFG.

Another one I'm looking at but don't own is FFG. I think it's categorized in
the P&C area for insurance. They're tied in with farm bureaus in several
states, specialize in insuring country folk and their property. Opportunity
best case would be to be as tight with their (farm) people as Horace Mann is
with theirs (teachers). Stock only been public a couple years seems.
As regarding an analysis of its fundamentals... as you have seen, I can get the

Paul..REF TGH

Seems telescan questioned some of their numbers also..

Was not on my run yesterday..I run the value screen every
Thursday..so only survivor BNE.. If TGH reappears or any stock
making second appearance..I only re-establish a position if I
can get it at 90% of original price.. ie TGH would have to
drop to 15 3/8 for a repurchase..

Also think we have a little more to go on this corrective
leg in general market..looking for 1/3 retracement of
APR-JUL move to the 888 basis S&P or 7600 on the Dow.
What do you think ??

Tejon Ranch (TRC) in a nutshell:

If you buy this stock you are buying a company that earns virtually nothing. I
earned more last quarter than the company did, I think. But they have assets,
or rather asset. 270,000 acres of land 60 miles north of LA right on route 5.
It is a little outside of the development sweet spot, but LA real estate is
starting to get hot again. I am traveling out there next week to visit six
REITS. Different market, but if REITs get hot enough, land values go up.

At $22 a share, you would be buying the land for roughly $1000 an acre. Its
worth at least 3 times that to a real estate investor. The stock traded at $50
a share the last time (late 80s) California land was in favor. The company has
done nothing since then, until six months ago.

Quick review of what has happened in the last six months.

1. The stock was controlled by three investors, including Times Mirror. In
February, Times Mirror said it wanted out, and hired JP Morgan to realize
value. The stock jumped from 14 to 17 on this development.

2. In July two big things happened. The company hired a real estate development
executive and announced a five year goal of developing the land. That is just
huge. AND Times Mirror sold to two highly respected vulture funds - the kind of
guys who don't invest in things where they can't double their money in 3 years.
They probably paid about $18 a share.

3. The stock hung at 18-19 for two weeks after the announcement then ran to 27
in four days. It has fallen back to 22. In my opinion it is worth in the low
30s. The assets are worth about $60 a share. I figure they have a low tax basis
and maybe nothing will happen, so I say the low 30s. I just want to point out
that that is pretty conservative.

A Ben Graham value buy in a very rich market. I posted it here first when it
was 17 four months ago, and you would have had a chance to cash out at 27
already in this "sleepy asset play". The current price is a screaming buy.

Do your own homework.

Respectfully,

Jim

James Scanlon: If market moves to level you are looking for, it will likely be
a good buying opportunity as more stocks come into the value universe. Does
seem like correction has started - lots of stalled-out stocks -- just my
impression (no facts to support it). I try not to predict downtrends; my
general assumption is that the market goes up (when considering any long period
of time...and some time periods can be pretty l o n g), and my premise is to
try to buy undervalued stocks and sell them when they reach fair value
(although seems lately I have often forgotten the sell component). Paul Senior

The flip side of Tejon is that while it is 60 miles across mountains from LA,
it is 40 miles from Bakersfield. Or a couple of miles from the high desert area
of Antelope Valley.

The thousand dollar per acre price discounts the fact that most of the land is
mountain and hill side. If cut and fill ordinances are followed in development,
most of it is unbuildable.

This property hugs the San Andreas Fault. You might want to look up the Fort
Tejon earthquake, and ask the USGS about recurrence risk, and building costs.

Assuming that LA must expand, and a well-defined roadway is the path of least
resistance, this could be the spot. On the other hand, in 1997 it is possible
that the Internet makes this sort of urban expansion unnecessary. Say, 70 miles
south of LA begins 1000 miles of beach along the Baja, which is undeveloped.

It is notable that the value speculators who bought live 3000 miles away.
Hopefully they can develop the thing. Certainly they have been able to puff the
price.

Re: the flip side of TRC

Thanks, Mike. I posted a similar
flip side a while ago:
http://www.exchange2000.com/~wsapi/investor/s-10036/reply-1118

Another interesting site is the Bakersfield
Real Estate ads for lots/acreage:
http://www.bakersfield.com/~tbc/cgi-bin/class/class.pl?field1=sub-1210&field2=0

Prices range from 20 acres for 65k, 40 acres for 24k,
10 acres for $6500, etc. The areas close to developed
areas look like 2 acres for 75k, 10 acres for 140k,
etc.

Looks like TRC is fairly valued on an asset basis if
these prices are the case. When reviewing these ads,
note that Tehachapi area locations are similar in
terrain to the Tejon ranch, but closer to Bakersfield.

The excitement comes from the fact that management
has taken an interest in developing some of these
270,000 acres. As noted above, land in developed
areas can go for $15k to $30k/acre. So not all of the
Tejon Ranch needs to be developed. ANY development
should justify the current price, and may lead to
significant gains down the road.

Paul,

Have you "forgotten the sell component" or not finding better to buy?

This seems to be the recent theme on the 'value' list.

While I haven't recently looked at the stocks you listed, I doubt very much if
you've been effected by the 'market correction' and may have actually gained
from monies going out of the high flyers to the mid and smaller cap stocks.

IMO - value investors aren't often subject to the overall market trends and can
often gain during falloff periods as investors look for a place to put their
money when they bail out of the trendy stocks.

Would you please look at CHERA & CHERB? (A is non-voting but otherwise equal so
B sells at a slight premium) It's selling @ 1.1x BV, low PE, and has shown 40%
average earnings growth last 4Q. Would be interested in your opinion compared
to others in the sector.

Thanx,
Ron

Ron, that's a good question. I "forgot" to sell BMY and some others when they
were at their highs last couple weeks. Probably because I sold some BMY when it
was half of what it is now, so I've been reluctant to sell as it - and others -
have been going up. Liked the ride, now I am seeing the other side.
Problem is that some of these large cap stocks sell for twice growth rate and
for stocks I buy, I think even one times growth is too much. (I think the Fool
boys' stocks with pegs of 1 are tooo expensive.) Result is I held because I
can't figure out what true value is. If I knew I would've sold long ago
-probably- and been onto something else- maybe.
I think when the downdraft hits, it will take most stocks with it. Value
investing is something you either see or don't (per Buffett and Munger), so I'd
expect people who get out of trendy stocks and/or momentum stocks to wait until
they see new trendy/momentum stocks emerging, or to buy their trendy stocks
back at lower prices. This seemed to work very well last year for semi's and
stocks like AMAT, etc. As the market declines and these stocks become more
attractive, many people in value stocks - seeing no movement in "dead money"
value stocks, will try something else, for example getting back into the semi's
at the lower prices (since that tactic worked once - and it may work again.) As
more and more value stocks become apparent, investors will have more choices,
so it will be tougher to see people willing to come into given value stocks...
especially if one has a portfolio of value stocks in which some stocks are not
outright buys now (they've moved up over the past months,years)and they're not
outright sells yet either.
I try never to switch out of a value stock I own into a stock I think is a
better value. I might buy the second stock, but if I sell the first, I've got
risks working against me... the first stock moves up and I'm out of it; the
second declines and I'm in it. Plus commissions, plus now I've got to rank
stocks in the portfolio - and some of these stocks I don't expect to move for
several years (e.g. OLS - which I've been wrong on... it has moved and I own
it.) Once I get the mentality to switch, it becomes too easy. Report of bad
news? why wait... sell and buy something better... there's always something
better. Which I believe is true; it's just that I myself can't make any money
in this twitchy, hop-about way.

CHER has had its best quarter this quarter... and the stock reflects it. There
were times -- many times -- when the stock was at 10. Now it's about 16. Maybe
it is undervalued; but to me looks like price reflects current good news and
MAYBE future. If (when??) it gets back to 10 range, I'm a buyer. Seems like I
missed the move and I'd be chasing at this point (price).

I agree, Paul. When the market swoons, I doubt the
momentum players will seek value. Have you read
How To Pick Stocks -- Kiplinger's interview with all
the famous fund managers? The growth managers sound
about 1/10th as sophisticated as the value managers.
I doubt they even know how to spot value, and they
certainly won't throw money into the sort of value
plays we're discussing here. My guess is they will
raise cash and make timid steps back into the market--
providing the bumps on the way down.

BTW, I'm currently reading Stocks for the Long
Run by Jeremy Siegal. Interesting book that
contains a wealth of
information and data, though I find fault with
much of his logic and do not subscribe to his
conclusions.

Further, does anyone know if the Ken Fisher

Good points. Especially that those investing in 'trendy' stocks will wait and

value buys. They play in the majors and the rest of us search thru the minors
looking for that major league prospect.

CHER - Your reasoning is why I asked. I'm not sure if it's on an upward profit
trend after a period of expansion or that it is just beginning a growth period.
Will likely hold thru at least a Q to see what develops. Not likely to get

idea, in light of doctor schedules and other considerations.

1. Trading Below Book.

2. Microcap recently took a pounding from 18 to current 3.5 - 4 range on

Might your broker have said these stocks are off their high by 10 and 13

I watched BYDS from the last summer ($11?).
The problem then was low cash and working capital and
big sales to Japan. Japanese change their fashions once
a month, so BYDS got hurt there.

Currently the company is cheap. But they are bleeding
cash, so they will have to borrow big time or they will
have to do an unfavorable secondary. I don't like the
program of downsizing. A small company like BYDS should
grow and not downsize.

On the positive side, the company won't go bankrupt
anytime soon. The current quarter, in my opinion,
will tell the future. It's their best seasonal quarter.
If they show a reasonable profit, then the turnaround
is possible. Otherwise I am not sure.

Currently holding no position in BYDS.

3. Management which does what is says and tells the truth

> most of that "dumb money" is institutional<

Recently I have had the opportunity to discuss a couple of companies with
members of their board of directors who sat as representatives of an
institutional investor with a large position. (One has been quoted several
times in Forbes recently as a small cap value guru.) Each of them BSed me for a
while, before finally admitting that they didn't know as much about the
companies as I did. Their stated reason for not being in control of the facts
was that they were representing other peoples money. The positions in question
were small in relation to their total portfolio. In one instance ownership was
12% of a company, and in the other ~20%.

The message to me was that the individual can have a huge advantage over the
institution under certain circumstances. Just choose the circumstance; stand at
the plate and watch lots of pitches.

I have been considering the same idea from a different angle, and it is scaring
me as an institutional investor. My argument is this. Value investors are
scared to death of not beating the indices, so they are not holding any cash.
(Some are, but they are the minority with real guts). How can value investors
provide any support in a correction if they are holding no cash?

James,

<Corrections turn into crashes because value investors have bought into the
growth thing and are not there to provide support. >

Allow me to inject another argument. Brinson's 1989 article in Financial
Analysts Journal stated that majority of returns are due to asset class
selection. Some people feel that style rotation will beat the indeces. In a
flat yield curve and low inflation environment growth stocks should perform
better and steepening yield curve should favor value style. The result is
greater volatility. In general, though, value stocks should do better than
growth stocks. Sinquefield and others believe that value stocks are riskier and
therefore offer this premium. But you have to beat indices quarterly whereas
individuals do not have that constraint.

I would like to make a case for style rotation, at least partially. Lazy
managers may stick to their style - value or growth.

Mike, I am not convinced that he did. His arrangement with the SEC allows him
to file confidentially (for a 15 month period, I believe) at the SEC's
discrection. The filing is posted with zero balances to protect the
confidentiality of the position. While I am not sure he is unique in this, I
don't know any other 13D/13G filer who has a similar arrangement.

This article; http://cnnfn.com/markets/9708/21/marketwrap/ talks about "rumors"
of Buffett selling...

" Rumors that investor Warren Buffett sold his
holdings in Wells Fargo (WFC) sent shares of the
bank down 13 to 254-1/2. Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway had controlled 7 million Wells Fargo
shares, making the stock the firm's fifth-largest
position. The bank says he still maintains a
substantial position.
Talk also spread that Buffett liquidated his 4.3
million share stake in General Dynamics. Shares
of General Dynamics (GD) fell 13/16 to 82-7/16
on the news as investors overlooked an
announcement that the defense conglomerate will
pay $284 million in cash for Lucent
Technologies' undersea surveillance systems unit."

Premier: Since I believe asset class selection is very important, I would not
want my fund managers to practice style rotation. That is,if I had say 5 funds
split into growth, large-cap, bonds, foreign, and value, I would not like it if
one or more of these fund managers now decided to switch into a different asset
class from the class I expected when I chose them. Sector rotation is the job
of the person owning these 5 mutual funds (switching into/out of various
funds).
For individuals making their own stock picks, I believe in multiple concurrent
styles (sectors). There's no reason a person can't have both value and growth
components within or among portfolios. It's not an either-or, switch from
one-to another thing IMO. (Which I see others posting here also practice, e.g.
own value stocks and large cap "growth" stocks, or converts., options, etc.
etc.)
If you make the case for sector rotation within a fund, then I assume you
believe the fund managers/analysts have the requisite skills and talents to
make their adjustments in temperment,measures, goals, etc. (or else the fund
fires its managers/analysts during the rotation) - or else you see no
difference in technique/talent/etc. between growth and value analysts.
For me, I'm not even sure that it is in the best interests of the value
investor to invest in stock funds be it value or growth.

Mike,

Buffet - I would think it likely that they are reducing position in some
holdings with plans to buy into more undervalued companies. Not like Berkshire
to accumulate cash in any market unless they feel overinvested in a company and
have better places to put the money.
I don't think the question should be about them pulling out of the market, but
'where's he planning to buy next?'.
One must remember that Buffet is the Supreme Value Investor.

Buffet? Greenspan? Doesn't take much to stampede the Bulls. It's time to start
looking for the buy opportunities.

Followers of Tejon Ranch: nice pos. write-up in this week's Barron's. eom.
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:8/23/1997 7:10:00 PM
From:Michael Burry

Thanks Paul. Here's an excerpt:

Why would the Chandlers turn their backs on a potential value of billions of
dollars? The answer lies in the family's goal of pruning back mercilessly to
core publishing businesses -- regardless of potential long-term returns --
and,given that, the business reality that it was better to sell in one fell
swoop even at below-market prices than to risk hammering down Tejon's thinly
traded stock in the open market.

To put it mildly, the buyers seem to have gotten themselves a real bargain.
Whitman says his stake cost him the equivalent of $650 an acre. He could
already make a healthy profit, he says, but he's not about to sell anytime
soon. He figures the land could ultimately be worth $5,000 an acre, maybe more.

Tejon Ranch has already announced it intends to begin developing some of its
most valuable property, along Interstate 5, the key north-south route running
through the middle of California. The company controls 16 uninterrupted miles
of unimproved highway frontage along both sides of I-5, including four highway
interchanges.

Step two, Whitman says, will be the development of residential housing on
20,000 acres in the Antelope Valley at the northern end of Los Angeles County.
He also points out that Tejon Ranch could expand its valuable agricultural
operations and simultaneously allow recreational access to the more mountainous
parts of the property.

Kyle Krueger, who runs Apollo Capital, a small St. Petersburg, Fla.-based
investment partnership, calculates Tejon's value at $80-$120 a share, figuring
at least $100 million for the agricultural acreage, $500 million for acreage
zoned for residential development, $250 million for Tejon's water rights, and
at least $250 million for the lands along I-5. Krueger points out that "Stine
has spent the last 15 months putting together a plan to materially increase the
pace and scope of real-estate development activities on the property. They
haven't disclosed the specifics or started to implement the plan, but they
will. It's imminent."

Stine says Tejon's first priority will be to upgrade the water, sewer and other
infrastructure along I-5 to allow development of motels, restaurants and
service stations. Whatever happens, Tejon Ranch's days as a sleepy agricultural
stock are over. Says Stine: "It's a new era."

Thanks, James. I just bought 1500 shares recently.

For investors, there is a lot of readily-available data, both on the
Internet and through other sources, about specific companies
which might be investment candidates. However, making sense of all
of this raw data can be an overwhelming task.

And especially for small-cap stocks, there is very little organized and
interpreted information available. For instance, of the 9,000 stocks
which are listed on the NYSE, the AMEX, or NASDAQ, only about
3,000 of the larger ones have any meaningful securities analyst
coverage.

The Napeague Letter is an "information integrator" for small-cap
stocks, integrating the mass of data that is available, bringing it
together and interpreting it, using the HyperText capability of the

of its Analyses. Its Web Site is

In other words, instead of merely providing vaguely-supported
recommendations, The Napeague Letter specifically shows you how its

Its editor is a relatively sophisticated individual investor, with 15 years
of experience as Chief Financial Officer of two different NASDAQ
companies and an MBA from Harvard Business. He is not employed
by or compensated by the companies that are analyzed in The

Mike - you bought Tejon? Way to go! This will be my way of repaying you for
WHX, which nobody will pry out of my hands below half of book value - how could
you sell something at 25% of book, even if you bought it for 15%? Hopefully you
didn't buy TRC on the way up a few weeks ago. Somebody paid 28 then. In the
long run, that may not be a bad price - maybe in the short run if a lot of
people read that Barrons article.

I was out in LA last week, and the real estate market is phenomenal. Job growth
in LA County was the best in the country last year. It is only a matter of time
before it becomes a serious possibility to develop Tejon. For now, building a
few gas stations and motels along that 16 miles of route 5 (four interchanges -
I didn't know that when I bought the stock) sounds like a fine start.

It will be very interesting to see where Tejon opens tomorrow following the
Barrons feature.

Lisa,

I read that article and was less than impressed.
The PEG is purely a GARP tool, IMO. If earnings
collapse , most of those companies would collapse.
There is no inherent margin of safety in GARP/PEG
investing. Like Michael Price says, its easier to
value the present than the future. It can be
just as profitable with better sleep and less
risk. Look at James Clarke's picks Tejon Ranch
and St. Joe's.

Here's an interesting tidbit from Forbes:
Warren Buffett is buying zero coupon
long-term Treasury bonds on a large
scale. We picked this information up
from zero coupon bond desks at some of Wall
Street's biggest firms. Five of the biggest bond
dealers report inquiries from Berkshire
Hathaway, an account that rarely ventures into
bonds. According to our information
Berkshire Hathaway has been quietly buying
zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds in 20- to
23-year maturities since late July.
Has the sage of Omaha concluded that
the stock market is overpriced and long bonds
underpriced? We simply do not know. Buffett
didn't return our call.

I pulled the trigger at 18 in April, but way too lightly. I made great money on
the St. Joe move because I had 30% of my portfolio in it when it made its big
move up. I had the conviction on Tejon, but just didn't see it happening so
fast. Everybody I put into this stock got the "patience" lecture, because I
didn't want to hear about it if it flatlined for a year before making its move.
And then the thing nearly doubles in a month. I can't give tips to the guys who
bought this again because they'll be expecting another miracle. Half of timing
is luck, I will be the first to admit. But a 40% move off a simple Barrons
article (absolutely no new information) shocked me.

To keep up the honest tone of discussion here, let me disclose two things.
First, I sold half my position today, which I would buy back in the mid 20s if
it drops back. And second, the 80-120 "valuation" quoted in Barrons is pure
hype. 50, maybe. 80-120 - no way.

Mike, I am just getting back into "market mode" after spending the summer
playing the horses (as I have done for the past 8 years). In May, I usually
pare down my portfolio to the few longs I am comfortable with and give the
ponies my full attention. This year, I hung onto only 2 longs: MO (which is the
only stock I have NEVER sold) and WHX (which is the biggest initial position I
have ever taken in a stock). I was surprised to read that you had already
bailed out. I am looking for AT LEAST a four-bagger on that one. I still have a
hunch that management has businesses other than steel in mind for the company.

I just read about a BUY recommendation somewhere for B.A.T.(Symbol BTI). I
would not swear to it, but I believe it was Kenneth L. Fisher, who has been
discussed often in this thread. I need to do my due-diligence on B.A.T. first
(guess I love tobacco stocks, even though an MI has turned me into a
non-smoker). Fisher also likes Japanese industrials, so I have taken an initial
position in the T. Rowe Price Japan Fund. I will be buying more, I suspect on
the way down.

I will be watching TEJON RANCH, but it has moved quite a bit since I have
returned. I have started nibbling in RYO (Royal Oak Mines), a small gold
producer, which has a semi-active thread on SI. I have been in and out of this
stock several times over the last few years. Gold might be bottoming and the
mining shares should lead the metal. Might be a month or two early here, but
there are signs that demand for gold is on the upswing.

This week's Barron's report on GATX has spurred me to purchase an initial (and
tiny) amount. I've been thinking off and on about GATX (sym. GMT) for about six
weeks. The investment manager's analysis seems about right to me. It's a hard
company for HIM to analyze, so it's real tough for the lay person (me). They're
in about three different business - rail car leasing, capital asset financing,
and pipelines and storage. What's been holding me back is that the stock is
just about at its high, it's price/book compared to its 13-14% ROE is on the
high side (per the way I sometimes like to calculate), it's business model is
not understandable (by me), and it just seems to be another plod-along company
selling at an historically high price. Further, it's got a ton of debt.
On the other hand, we have a company that has a new ceo, is trying some 'gutsy'
things (a big venture with Pitney in the capital asset arena), and seems to
know its businesses pretty well. Some of these assets (rail cars) are very
long-lived, and the pipelines are possibly not able to be duplicated at the
costs on GMT's books. (margin of safety?) Furthermore we are talking about a 3%
dividend yield (yes,yes who cares about 3% when one should/could take advantage
of quick doubles ala Tejon...) Nevertheless this 3 percent fits my relative
dividend yield model. Furthermore, I think it may fit Dipy's (what happened to
him?) model in that the div. has been increased in each of the last 12 years (&
when you borrow a lot of dough, it's easy to give some to the stockholders
-g-). I came across this stock in reading a special edition of PC Week - their
assessment of the nation's 500 top companies who are the most aggressive
adopters of innovative technology. Amazingly to me, GMT was #4 on their list
("IT helps GATX solve logistics headaches"). Maybe it'll turn out to be not
such a plod-along, mundane company after all. Paul Senior

Thanks for the feedback on PUBO. I'm not jumping in yet but will
keep a close watch on it. Obviously, what they do with the cash
(and a 30 mill line of credit) will dictate the long run. But as
it's like getting the existing businesses (not exciting but
profitable) for free. And the management seems to have made some
good decisions to turn the company around in the last few years -
that gives me some confidence they will make another good decision
when they put the cash to work. Also, the cash has been building
for a couple years, so they obviously aren't burning it and are
being patient in putting it to use.

Pete,

My response to Bonnie did not disagree with
her. I was simply pointing out that both
I and another poster had brought out
similar negatives to an investment in TRC
previously. Re: "being correct" I didn't
see her offer her estimate of the value of
TRC.

The tone of her message is the part that
is not welcome on this thread. In general
the thread should be less a place for
argument and more a place for rational
discussion.

TRC is now a momentum stock short-term.
Even the Motley Fool has covered it two
days in a row -- this time retracting yesterday's
estimate and cutting its projected value by 90%.
Shorts I'm sure smell opportunity -- if they could just prick the bubble...

Bonnie,

Just trying to keep the thread civil...

I don't feel the market has acted too
crazy yet. Itis nevertheless a momentum
play -- I expect it to fall back some or
stay near this level as the momentum
players realize they don't have the
patience to be value investors.

Marty Whitman figures $5000/acre, and
he is a more credible figure than
any of us here.

So, $5000/acre about 10 years from now
minus 20-50% for the minimal development costs
and you might come up with $40/share
present value.

As someone who grew up in the Bay
Area, attended UCLA, and even had
relatives at Edwards AFB, I know the
land is imperfect. Valuing
this one is extremely difficult.
In my case, it's probably worth
it to hold it a year just for the
tax break on the gains when I sell.

The Internet has created a huge problem for the investment community.
For the first time in stock market history, the investor pool all over the
world has all of the same knowledge of the current and future potential of
stock-based investments. Up to about 1993 most of the information available for
any given stock was not readily available to the general public, and in fact
was not available to the majority of brokerage firms. The result of the vastly
improved information and access to information is improved stock valuation from
much larger pool of potential buyers and sellers, both amateur and
professional.
In other words, don't count on finding "values" anymore, though bottom-feeding
will continue as it always has. The Internet is the death of value investing.
Professionals now have to make profit on internet brokerage commissions, on
option trades (80% are worthless) and on volatility. Beware the "value"
investor who buys a stock on "new" information that is passed on to the
Internet so that someone can sell the stock quickly at a profit.

The stock has a tendancy to bounce off it's 50DMA and reach new highs, then
pull back to the 50DMA. I initially bought into it as a quick trade target of
$14. But DMMC may hold long-term possibilities. I just started a thread, and am

Bonnie, would you care to guess where I found the Tejon Ranch idea in April?
Hitchhiking through California? No. A Wall Street research report? Of course
not - they'll start recommending this at 50. I found it on an internet message
board. Nobody was hyping it. It was just a guy like me posting a few lines that
might whet the curiosity of similar minded value investors. Nobody told me to
buy it. I did ny own homework - on the internet. Downloaded the 10-K, which you
could have done. Looked at the same real estate information you did. Remember,
the stock was at 18 and dead in the water hen.

Value investmentments don't arise just because people don't have access to
information. It is that most investors are too lazy to do their own homework
and to think for themselves, and even if they do are too scared to invest in
something until everybody else thinks its OK. The internet is the best friend
of a 1997 value-oriented individual investor, because it evens the information
gap with the professionals.

Buying a stock based on information found on the internet does not mean buying
a hot tip you know nothing about. Some people will do that whether its a tip
off the internet, a tip from the dentist or a tip from a Wall Street broker.
And they are almost always going to be the last ones to know. The internet as I
see it is the way to get all the public information and all the news on even
the smallest company instantly. Then its up to you.

And by the way, if you spend any time on this message board you will see that
most of the tips posted here are honest, not hype. You will find that there are
certain people on this board you can trust every time. Not that they'll always
be right, but that they are honestly giving you the best information they have.

Those of you attracted to event-driven plays may want to take a look at
Washington National (NYSE:WNT). It signed an acquisition agreement with
PennCorp last November. The agreement has been extended to this August 30th.
Since the original agreement, multiples for life insurance companies have
increased considerably. But an effective cap of $29.50/share has been imposed
on WNT. PennCorp has been unable to get SEC approval for the proxy material
(probably for two reasons; one, there is a possibility that the SEC is
requiring PennCorp to restate financial statements; and two, Morgan Stanley may
no longer be able to issue the necessary fairness opinion since industry prices
have risen so dramatically).

There is now considerable pressure on WNT to let the argreement expire by its
terms on Saturday. There is a 13D filed by a NY hedge fund manager and there
have been press reports that institutional holders (approx 61% of o/s shares)
are applying the pressure.

Let there be no mistake: neither WNT nor PennCorp are outstanding companies and
WNT would not be part of our portfolio were it not for this event.

I expect that one of two things could happen:
1. PennCorp renegotiates its purchase price in exchange for an extension of the
agreement (more likely, in my opinion); or
2. The agreement expires and Morgan Stanley reshops the deal (less likely, in
my opinion).

There is a dividend of $0.27/share with a 9/15/97 record date which should
cover most costs you might incur, so the downside is limited.

I would expect an announcement either over the weekend or on Tuesday.

My upside target, under scenario 1, is $32-$33 and, under scenario 2, is
perhaps high $30's. Most life insurance companies are trading at a 1.5 or
higher multiple of book value. This one is trading at a considerable discount.

Scenario 1 is more likely, in my opinion, because WNT appears to really want
this deal (although for reasons that totally escape me <g>, such as continuing
employment contracts, etc.). Scenario 2 is possible if the pressure really is
as high as I have been told.

Bonnie Smietanowska: It's not the information, it's what is done with the
information. Just because we now all have the same information (well access to
the same information), each must interpret and ACT on the information for
himself/herself. This is done differently by each person based on one's
background,interests and view of the world. You can see some of this if you
read this thread for a while. For example, in comparing portfolios of value
investors who have posted here, I don't recall seeing one stock that was owned
by more than 2, maybe 3 people. Yet each person believes his/her portfolio
contains value stocks and can make a cogent argument that each stock is a value
stock. So, either all these people are wrong, or perhaps there might be another
dynamic working here - maybe it takes a while to see the value, get comfortable
with it (willing to have the patience to hold), buying, and sitting on it.
I think the internet is the value player' friend. Stocks go out of fashion or
are spooked, or whatever... I welcome all information about such stocks because
I believe it's not the knowledge that draws people to buy or sell - often it's
the panic, fashion, etc. In that dicotomy, there is opportunity. Paul Senior

Efficiency in the market, and the death of "value" investing, is the opinion of
Lester Thurow. Smallcaps and microcaps are reasonably efficient markets (the
value is correctly known) but the demand for them is much lower as the lack of
liquidity makes them incredibly difficult to sell profitably in a market
correction, and they are much more sensitive to interest-rate changes. In other
words, the market makers eat small-caps for dinner in a market correction with
huge spreads and sellers will sell at any price to get rid of the stock,
exactly what happened in April. When an investor sells a mutual fund the fund
manager is required to sell everything to redeem the investment, so the sudden
surplus of small-caps dumped by mutual funds in the April tax season caused net
surplus, more sellers than buyers, and the prices collapsed. What is happening
in the market now is an increased tolerance for elasticity of p/e ratios and
more optimistic growth projections, or a bidding up of prices from buyers
unable to find other investment mediums. ADRs share the illiquidity of
smallcaps, you're likely to find more true value there but at higher risk. The
value investor may do well now looking in ADRs, and waiting for interest-rate
market shocks in the U.S. to pick up bargains.

James, with due respect, I looked at this company (Tejon Ranch) when it was
dead, did my homework on it, did some calculations of its value and decided
that it was dead for a very good reason. The hypemasters are the newly-involved
brokerages putting out the announcements, that comment was absolutely not
directed at the thread.
The big advantage of the (efficient) net is that it allows an investor to
create his/her own portfolio and take more risk (and reward) than is allowed in
a mutual fund. I find the only truly inefficient market now is in ADRs. Most
people are not willing to wade in the sea of exchange rates, different
accounting systems, different legal systems, market risk and political risk in
the ADR market so smallcap ADRs may have the best values of all.

1) EMT. I personally believe markets are selectively inefficient for
no good reason. I studied economics and realize the limitations of its theory,
yet MBA's and finance professors often forget they are dispensing theory, not
rules. The theory is backed to the best of
the academic's ability with studies. The studies re: stock market returns omit
the subjective in favor of the objective
by necessity -- especially if the study is to have the requisite power. The
power is bought at the expense of real-world
application. This is a fatal flaw in the "pronouncements" made by academics
with respect to value investing. Another flaw relates to the retrospective
limitation of academic finance studies. How about a
randomized, controlled, prospective trial? IT IS NOT POSSIBLE due to variations
in the subjective aspect of investing. Would a doctor give you a drug without
the benefit of such a trial? No, yet academics have
made their careers (tenure motivates) advocating people base their financial
futures on inherently weak studies. Spend some time on
this thread and you'll realize that subjective interpretations of the same data
vary widely. No offense to Lester, but 90% of the
literature put out by this nation's universities (even MIT) is junk
science motivated by the tenure carrot. This is especially true in
the "unprovable" disciplines like finance and economics, where controversy and
new theories count more than real-world applicability.

2) The EMT'ers are the ones that allow the inefficiency to continue --
by giving up and buying the market (like most mutual funds these
days). The fact that stocks jump when they are added to the S&P
is evidence of the degree to which this occurs. The small caps
and stocks that aren't moving in price/volume are ignored. Also
ignored are values like Tejon Ranch -- where the assets are on
the books at such low prices relative to present value that
no ratios will look good -- hence no way will they pop up on
institutional fundamental screens.

3) <<The value investor may do well now looking in ADRs, and waiting for
interest-rate market shocks in the U.S. to pick up bargains.>>

I agree -- I'm moving into them now. But how do you get bargains if
the markets are efficient?

Mike, it sounds like we have a different definition of efficient. I think of it
as "all buyers in the market know enough info to generate the fundamental
valuation of this stock" No problem. ADRs are inefficient markets. I don't
include emotional purchases in market efficiency, if I define it including
these effects then yes the market is very inefficient. we have several classes
of emotional valuations: (1) even if told what a security is worth some
investors will continue to buy way past the correct valuation for emotional
reasons, like heirlooms they will give to their children."it'll be worth more
someday". Value investors, not. (2) We have the "index fund" phenomenon
everywhere, where people buy it and it goes up and they buy more and more and
it goes up and up. It's just like the Nikkei in 1989. Again, people continue to
buy even though they were told that the basket was overpriced (3) we have
momentum investing, buy because it's moving fast: these guys don't care. So I
tend to think of these effects separately.
I still can't choke down those estimates for the blistering desolation of Tejon
Ranch when I can buy oceanfront agricultural land in nice parts of California
for less.
