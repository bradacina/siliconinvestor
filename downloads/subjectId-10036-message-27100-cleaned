AZECF: Fwiw, Mario Gabelli in this week's Barron's mid-year roundable:

"What are you buying?

We see a big catalyst in Aruze [6425.Japan], a Japanese operator of pachinko
parlors. Gambling is coming to Japan. Aruze trades at &#165; 4060 yen. The
company's main asset is 24 million shares of Wynn Resorts [WYNN]. Wynn trades
for 95, so you get three-tenths of a share of Wynn per share of Aruze. Add up
Aruze's debt, cash and Wynn shares, and you get the underlying business for
free.

How is that business doing?

There are three speculative elements here. In the next three years, Japan will
probably license gambling, and Wynn will have a center-row orchestra seat.
Second, the Chinese are passionate gamblers, and will travel to Japan. Third,
Goldman Sachs just bought a 9% stake in Aruze."

Cash Flow is Better than P/E - The TRGL story

TRGL is a cash flow story. Their cash flow will triple with the development of
their Turkey gas wells. Their free flow cash flow numbers on Yahoo should turn
significantly positive next qtr w/ eventually reflecting $4.50/share (in new
cash contribution) next year. This money then needs to be redeployed to replace
the reserves sold with the balance booked as net profit to the company. The
price of the stock should eventually reflect these new income streams and could
conservatively be priced at a forward PE of 8. My 2008 price target is $27 to
$45 per share. The higher end of the range could be met with new well
discoveries and the lower end s/b hit once their Turkey operation is 100%
online. No dividend is paid at this time as all the cash flow is being used to
finance daily operations.

I have started a small position in this company at an average price of
$14.95/share and am looking for a double in 18-24 months. Because most of their
operations are outside the U.S., they provide my taxable portfolio good
international exposure. I may add more shares for a full position if prices dip
back into the low $14/share. This position is a story in progress which should
get better as time proceeds.

===============================================
Cash Flow is Better than P/E
From Ken Little,
Article from "Your Guide to Stocks".

"...Cash flow ratios are a better measurement of a stock’s value than price
earnings ratio (P/E). How much cash a company can generate is one of the more
important measures of its health. Yet, you will hear more about P/E than almost
any other metric on valuation, but it does not give you an accurate picture of
a company’s ability to generate cash.

P/E represents the ratio of the stock’s price to its earnings per share (EPS).
It is an important metric, if for no other reason because so many people think
it is. When a company’s P/E is very high or low, it gets top billing on the
news.

Overlooked by many are the equally important – I would suggest more important –
metrics that examine a company’s price relative to its cash position.

Importance of Cash
The reality is that without cash, a company won’t last long. That may seem
obviously simple, however there is a long list of companies that failed because
cash was in too short supply. So, how do you use cash flow ratios to see if a
company is under or over-valued, which is the same purpose of P/E? Two primary
measurements shed light on a company’s valuation.

Price to Cash Flow
The price to cash flow is determined by dividing the stock’s price by cash flow
per share. The reason many prefer this measurement is the use of cash flow
instead of net income (found in computing EPS). Cash flow is a company’s net
income with the depreciation and amortization charges added back in. These
charges, which reduce net income, do not represent outlays of cash so they
artificially reduce the company’s reported cash.

Since these expenses don’t involve actual cash, the company has more cash than
the net income figure indicates.

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a refinement of cash flow that goes a step farther and adds
one-time expenses capital expenses, dividend payments, and other non-occurring
charges back to cash flow. The result is how much cash the company generated in
the trailing twelve months. You divide the current price by the free cash flow
per share and the result describes the value the market places on the company’s
ability to generate cash.

What they Mean
Like the P/E, both of these cash flow ratios suggest where the market values
the company. Lower numbers relative to its industry and sector, suggests the
market has undervalued the stock. Higher numbers than its industry and sector
may mean the market has overvalued the stock.

Already Calculated
Thankfully, you don’t have to do all of these calculations. Many sites on the
Web include these valuation numbers for your consideration. One of my favorite
site is Reuters.com. Their detailed quotes offer both the cash flow ratios.

Enter a stock in the quote box on the top bar, and then click on “Ratios” in
the left column links.

Conclusion
Like all ratios, they don’t tell the whole story. Be sure you look at other
metrics to verify relative value. However, these cash flow ratios can give you
significant clues to how the market values a stock..."

I guess according to the supreme court juries can decide whether a man is
guilty of murder but not competent to determine whether brokerage firms are
screwing investors by manipulating prices-

Supreme Court Ruling Means Investment Banks Likely to See Lower Legal Costs

NEW YORK (AP) -- The Supreme Court's ruling that blocks investors from suing
Wall Street investment banks under antitrust laws could save Wall Street firms
a bundle by limiting investors to smaller recoveries.

ADVERTISEMENT
In a case dating back to the dot-com bubble, the high court ruled Monday that
antitrust suits would pose a "substantial risk" to the securities market.
Damages in antitrust cases are tripled, in contrast to penalties under the
securities laws.

The ruling struck down a lower court decision that would have allowed investors
to go after Wall Street firms that they say engaged in anticompetitive
practices by conspiring to drive up prices on about 900 newly issued stocks in
the late 1990s.

Because the well-documented implosion of names like Enron Corp. swallowed any
serious money that investors might hope to recover from that and other
flame-outs, some investors have turned to the banks and other Wall Street
regulars such as accounting firms that did work for such companies.

"In some ways it's sort of restating the standards announced 25 to 30 years
ago," said Wesley Powell, an antitrust lawyer with Hunton & Williams in New
York. "The fact that these antitrust cases have been thrown out on these
grounds I think will send a high profile message to would-be plaintiffs who
were thinking of bringing antitrust claims in the securities context."

Lawyers for investment banks say the difference between legal and illegal
activity is a highly technical matter that must be left to highly trained
securities regulators to decide, rather than to courtroom juries. In its 7-1
ruling, the Supreme Court found that antitrust courts were likely to make
serious mistakes.

Powell noted that not only do those pressing claims under securities laws not
have the triple damages awarded in antitrust cases, but such claims also have
to meet a higher legal burden than claims made under antitrust laws.

"Other defendants in these cases are going to seize on this to try to get the
cases dismissed on the basis of this case," he predicted.

Investors have accused the Wall Street firms of dangling shares of in-demand
initial public offerings to favored investors who agreed to later buy
additional shares at higher prices. Investors said the average price increase
on the first day of trading was more than 70 percent from 1999 to 2000, a jump
8 1/2 times the level seen from 1981 to 1996.

A group representing Wall Street banks praised the court's decision.

"If this case had gone the other way, the resulting uncertainty and increased
risk would have had negative and wide-ranging consequences for underwriters and
issuers, increasing costs to investors and roiling the capital markets, to the
detriment of the whole economy," Travis Larson, a spokesman for the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association, said in a statement.

The 17 companies named in the lawsuit before the court Monday included Credit
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, formerly Credit Suisse First Boston LLC; Bear,
Stearns & Co.; Citigroup Global Markets Inc.; Goldman, Sachs & Co.; and Morgan
Stanley & Co..

The case is Credit Suisse v. Billing, 05-1157.

Hi Paul - The premium spread for MWA Class 'A' shares vs the MWA Class 'B'
shares is almost 13% now.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=mwa-b

According to a recent management presentation, Class 'B' shares will eventually
be consolidated into 'A' shares.

I have been buying the MWA Class A shares and today sold some November $17.5
covered calls that locks in a 24% gain if my shares are called away.

To further enhance the return by another 10% is to buy an equivalent number of
Class 'B' shares with the expectation that when the shares are consolidated
into one class, the premium will disappear. Therefore, you can structure a
covered call position (buy/write) using the Class 'B' shares for the covered
call stock.

I plan to take a slightly less hedged approach and on any check back, I will
just buy Class 'B' shares to add to my Class 'A' share position.

I am neutral on the company in general after listening to their conference call
(JP Morgan 6/12/2007). The positives include: (1) They have restructured their
large debt so that they lowered their effective long term rate. It's still
quite large and the one time (and reoccurring savings) they gain from their
merger will be used to pay down this debt and (2) According to management,
their are huge barriers to entry into their business as many of their products
require "special certification" that in some cases take years to receive. This
provides a good "moat" that secures their market share.

The main thing that caught my attention is that the company is subject to huge
raw material commodity (eg brass & copper) price swings that are difficult to
pass on to their customer because of the lag time from order to delivery. This
includes the time to manufacture, distribute and deliver the product after the
original customer contract is taken. Their customers (typically municipalities)
do not like to keep much inventory on site. Some quarters (like this quarter)
they have to eat the raw material price increase (which is huge for brass and
copper) since it currently takes them up to two quarters to build their
finished goods, have them delivered to their distributors and eventually to the
customer. I expect this lag time will shrink substantially in the future as
they get their JIT manufacturing systems in place and better utilize their new
consolidated factory and shipping centers.

Finally, 30% of their business is to Home Depot and with the pending sale of
HD's supply business, their was some concern it may impact future orders.
Management was not too concerned but I suspect that the new owners of the HD's
supply business may want to revisit their purchase contracts with Mueller which
may impact their product margins from this line of business looking forward.

The $10Bn question is whether that's going to be true in the future or if the

pipelines, possible bad regulatory environment (both FDA and pricing side).
Positives... hmm, the only positive seems to be that all of these companies
continue making loads of money even while being sued, losing patents and so
on... And the need for drugs is not going down either... I really can't make a
macro call. I hold some pharmas and hope for a wind of change. ;)

BTW, quite a few of large caps in other areas have similarly looking charts, so
partially it's not a pharma issue. ;) Compare for example KO vs. BMY for 3-5

Re: TX

Thanks, Paul. The stock came down intraday to test the breakout price (~30.15).
Hope you've got some. I think TX has a lot of room to go up. The Venezuela
agreement and the dividend must have been the catalyzer for some institutions
to come back in. Compared to steel peers (like MT), TX is valued way too low.
This is the Hugo Chavez effect that spooked so many (included me) but then
rationale set in and I realized that the market was way too much penalizing TX
for their Venezuelan exposure. Market ignored the IMSA purchase which is a
wonderful fit to TX. Anyhow, Mexico and US are now much more important markets
for TX, I think, so valuations should follow that of competitors, and this
should give TX plenty of room to move up. This could be a 36-37 USD stock in a
few weeks (now that it broke through major resistance at 30). The combo of
value and momentum should play its magic in the near future. But no warranties
indeed. Regards - fp

there was over 2.3 million shares traded at $17.50 with a peak sale at $19.35.

This move is probably due to the Russel 3000 rebalancing by the fund companies
which occurred on the close today. MWA was probably added to the index as it is
a new company and these after hour transactions were net buys.

Stock will probably fall back to the low $16 price range after a few weeks once

I bought UTF following Smiths previous buys at lower prices and the stock has
performed well.

As for FSP, if it wasnt such a large % of my IRA, I would probably be buying
more. Im disappointed and frustrated with the shares performance and convinced
that their business model needs tweaking. Specifically, I believe by buying
their former private placement deals, it results in continuous
open market selling as those private placement buyers cash out to invest in the
next syndicated deal. (A large percentage of private placement buyers invest
again & again in new deals)

I will probably add more CBF if it weakens a little more and/or if the insider

Chinese wireless "value added service" cigar butts. KONG and HRAY are Chinese

will buy them out. But the stock is cheap and the bank is growing. I suspect
that they need to find a use for their excessive capital, either buy another
bank and/or buy back stock.

Community bank stocks are not fancied now, but i think OSBK is worth a shot - i
bought a position today.

Can you elaborate why they are too tough to figure? IMO, they are not tough to
figure, they just may not be cheap enough. ;) But that's what you said too. :)

I have read that article, should have linked to it in my post.

Presumably TOMO was supposed to be taken under by its major holder, so I did
not look at it.

I am probably not going to buy them, since as I said my circle of competence

KONG. It seems to me I don't understand the business model or demand for
product. Worrisome is that KONG sells much of its phone products/services
through CHL who may or might provide their own competitive offerings or perhaps
raise carrier fees to KONG.
I see the Chinese phone market growing... I note growth of CHL subscriber base
and increase in CHL stock price. Yet now here we have KONG reporting lower
earnings and expected lower earnings next quarter again because (as they say)
their revenue has decreased/is decreasing. So, CHL is growing, yet KONG is
declining. That I'm not understanding. Other similar service provides in the
media articles also seem to be down. Maybe it's a structural problem. In any
case I find the KONG situation unsatisfactory.

KONG cash provides a floor, I presume. Stock might be at a base now; I don't
know. For me, I've had enough: I've taken my lumps in KONG stock and have
exited. If I see stock decline to cash value, I'll take a chance and reenter,
assuming KONG might not burn through their cash as they try to improve their
customer offerings, revenue, earnings.

It seems rather obvious situation. CHL and other operators want the WAP
service, ringtone, etc. market to themselves. So they are trying to cut out
KONG and HRAY by various methods mentioned in the article you linked to. That's
why KONG/HRAY revenues and earnings are dropping. It is going to get worse from
here in that market and I don't see a turnaround possible.

Where we go from here?

KONG/HRAY may find a new business opportunities probably related to the current
business. There are quite a few things that CHL may not covered yet in mobile
service space. However competition is brutal in other areas too.

They may get bought out by CHL or some other operator who wants their
products/technology, so they can offer them themselves.

Or they can burn through the cash and die.

It's almost "cash in search of business" situation although not quite, since
they may have some technology useful for others.

If the valuation was at cash, it would be easier to buy, certainly. But it is
not clear they will decline to cash... It is a sexy business area and I expect
the speculation to move the stock prices quite a lot.

Clothier AEO: At current price, I'll add back a few shares.

I like forward p/e:

'09 (!) per Yahoo is ~ 11.5. That's lower than other apparel companies I've
positions in.

A $25-26 stock with no ltd and $3 cash. Nice profit margins and nice roe past
three years. I don't know whether such will continue. I hope, and bet so,
though.

A Scott Black recommendation in the recent Barron's Midyear Roundtable. He's
quoted there as saying:
"I recommended American Eagle Outfitters [AEO], an apparel retailer, at the
2006 Roundtable. It had a big run, we sold, and the stock has fallen back to
27.20. In the past five fiscal years, ending Jan. 31, revenue has compounded by
19.1% a year. Operating income has grown to $587 million from $158 million, up
38% a year. Operating margins have climbed to 21% from 11.4%. Sales per square
foot have risen to $642 from $460. Earnings per share are $1.70, up from 46
cents. Return on equity is 28%. There is no debt and $827 million in cash on
the balance sheet.

"Revenue will rise 15%, to $3.2 billion. Divide $439 million in net income by
225 million fully diluted shares, and you get $1.95 a share for the year,
versus $1.70 in fiscal '07. They probably will buy back more shares. The stock
trades for 13.9 times fiscal '08 estimates. The company will generate about
$290 million in free cash flow this year, up from $276 million. This is a money
machine. If they don't buy back shares, their cash position will increase to
more than $1 billion. In the year ending January '09, earnings could grow to
$2.25 a share. The P/E on fiscal '09 is 12.1. Many large-cap growth companies
-- the Coca-Colas and Campbell Soups -- are 5%-6% top-line growers and 9%-10%
bottom-line growers, and they're trading at 18 and 20 times earnings. American
Eagle is ridiculously cheap. Yes, gasoline prices are up, but the company
hasn't seen any decline in store traffic. The stock has come down
substantially. This is a good entry point."

Total assets: 126M$. With 30% equity they have more than 3x what is needed to

Sold 25% of my Bulk Shipping company DRYS (DryShips, Inc.) today. This has been
a good performer for me over the last 13 months, just over a four bagger
(http://finance.yahoo.com/charts#chart2:symbol=drys;range=2y;indicator=volume;c
arttype=line;crosshair=on;logscale=on;source=undefined)

I thought it was time to take my seed money off the table. The company is quite
leveraged with debt but has capitalized on this by adding several new boats to
their fleet. This has been a very profitable strategy for the company
especially with daily fleet rates at all time highs.

Times have been very good for the bulk shippers but when times are tough you
can loose money fast especially if you carry a lot of debt. This management
does not have a very good track record in tough times. I plan to peel of more
shares from time to time through the rest of the year as my holding period is
now over a year.

Vivian Lewis sails on with DryShips
http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2007/06/27/top-20-advisors-vivian-lewis-sails-on-
ith-dryships/
Posted Jun 27th 2007 10:35AM by Steven Halpern
Filed under: China, Brazil, Newsletters, Top Picks 2007

Last December, over 100 stocks were featured in our Top Picks for 2007 report.
Now, at mid-year, we turn to the 20 advisors whose picks showed the strongest
gains to get an update on their previous picks, as well as a new favorite stock
for the second half of the year.

Vivian Lewis, editor of Global Investing, chose DryShips Inc. (NASDAQ: DRYS) as
her top pick for 2007. The stock rose 126%, as of June 1, 2007. Here is her
original recommendation on DRYS and her new favorite stock for the rest of
2007.

Meanwhile, the advisor now says, "DryShips is trading at a P/E of only 15, even
now that the stock has gone up 300%. There is a lot of negativity about George
Economou, who heads the company and now is the CFO.

"He headed a prior shipping company, which filed for bankruptcy after it could
not pay back loans to British banks a decade ago. This was in the DryShips
prospectus of course, and was also the subject of a report written by Kate
Welling (former Barron's reporter) for a group shorting DRYS, including the
Weeden brokerage firm.

"As a result, all this maybe makes DRYS cheaper than in would be otherwise.
When I recommended DRYS in Global Investing in December 2005, I wanted it for
its yield of 7.8%. That went up to 8.4% a year ago when the shorts were out in
force, and the stock fell from $12.75 (our buy level) to $9.50.

"So the recovery is nice, but there is still an 'odor' around, which is why the
resignation of the second CFO in a year causes some upset. I'm not giving up on
this stock and indeed, perhaps would want to buy on weakness -- although as a
holder, I am not sure I want to see weakness."
========================================

Added more shares of NYB (New York Community Bancorp Inc.) at prices below $17.
The company continues to shore up their reserves by adding new depositors
through acquisition. They run a quality franchise in the New York, New Jersey
and Long Island area. A niche loan product they provide are very profitable
multi-family construction loans (that turn over frequently). Management has an
excellent track record with selling these loans and they continue to grow their
franchise servicing this sector.

Also, their "Deposit Market Share" now is in the top five company category for
the markets they serve.
http://www.snl.com/Irweblinkx/depositmarketshare.aspx?iid=1024119
This would make them an attractive merger candidate if an offer arises.

I have been accumulating shares of NYB for over two years and have an average
cost below $17. They pay a good dividend (almost 6%) which I have enhanced with
writing covered calls and selling naked puts. NYB is now my number one holding
and should do well if interest rates remain at current levels.

My price target is $21-$23 in 18-24 months and higher (or earlier) if a merger
is done.

About those high dividend stocks, rllee:

Couple months back I mentioned I was adding to my small HTGC position:

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=23423819&srchtxt=htgc

Closed-end investment company PSCC discussed here also. I have a full position.

I mentioned briefly last year that I held DFR. I sold it. Though in searching
my records now and also here, I can't find when, and I don't remember why.
Possibly got scared out of it because of its loans (?).

Tanker stocks. I never did buy DHT or NAT (too bad!), although I do have shares
in a couple others (SFL, etc.) Recently (past few months), I became more
interested in the bulk shippers (commodity haulers), and I posted on a few I
was buying. Among them, I have ONAV and DSX which sport 9% div. yields.

If you are interested in high-yield stocks, you might wish to look at the
various Business Development Company stocks (BDC's). Several of these have been
mentioned here by several people over the past years.

(Aside to any other PSCC holders. I myself call PSCC (and HTGC) a bdc. Funny
thing is I notice now that on the PSCC site the company refers to itself as a
"closed-end investment company" and as a "pass through entity" from a tax
perspective. No mention of themselves as a bdc. So I guess I am only assuming
that they are or are similar to a bdc.)

Added a few more shares of MOT (Motorola, Inc.) at $17.69 to my starter
position. The company has good free flow cash flow and hopefully their new
RAZR2 phone will help stabilize their mobile cell phone sales. My thinking is
that with the end of the quarter and the hype with the Apple IPhone most of the
current selling is over. Longer term, the company is well positioned to sell
more set top boxes to the cable companies to take advantage of the growing HD
TV market.

The stock is not a screaming value buy yet but it is near their 52 wk low of
$17.32. It's not a very good sign that insiders continue to sell but the

I researched kelly criteria at length read fortunes formula which i found to be

horseracing or straight win/lose propositions than anything else but thorp is a
sharp guy so he my have some adaptation that works. I have a math background
and looked at kelly's original article but i couldnt figure it out.
One of the big problems in using this criteria is that its based on probability
of winning and i think thats difficult to predict that probablity accurately in
most most mergers, and most stock market plays. although thorp made a lot of
his money in pricing warrrants correctly, and there you could price warrants
based on a particular model fairly accurately and there were a lot mispriced
warrants at the time.
also thorp went into debt to buy att stock and short the spinoffs as his odds
of winning was 100%. Not to many opportunities like that. Now if you do have
expertise in likely outcomes of merger -what is your feeling about the trib
merger going through? according to barrons that represents a 30% annualized

I would not have bet anything in this situation because the reward would not
have been worth it for me.

 Couple weeks back I came across a buyout offer to close roughly three weeks
hence. Stock selling for $21.65 with offer of $22.00 cash/sh. 

0.35$ is a 1.65% return. Loss Potential of 5$ means loss potential is 14x
higher than return potential. This means if you have a probability of roughly
7% that a deal is not going through your average return would be breakeven.the
problem with your math is that i think you estimated the risk that the deal
will fail very low, only 1-2%. I personally would refuse to accept a failure
risk of less than 5% in any case of merger situation.

Re: RUSS

James:

You wrote: ... RUSS - a bulletin board stock. free cash flow positive trading
at less than cash on the balance sheet... Strange business with obvious warts,
but I don't see why its trading below cash.

Let's take a closer look at RUSS's balance sheet. it is true that it has about
$2.50 net cash per share. But have you noticed that its book value is a -$3.893
per share. Moreover, RUSS is a bullentin-board stock. I really can't see how
RUSS can be considered as an attractive value investment, despite some others
who think otherwise. Let the passage of time be the judge.

Total Cash (mrq): 35.49M
Total Cash Per Share (mrq): 3.023
Total Debt (mrq): 6.04M
Total Debt/Equity (mrq): N/A
Current Ratio (mrq): 0.487
Book Value Per Share (mrq): -3.893

Cash Flow Statement
Operating Cash Flow (ttm): 13.48M
Levered Free Cash Flow (ttm): -662.75K

James!!! :)

What the heck are you doing back here? Didn't you make your billions during
those 7 years? (To be precise, it was only 3 years since your last post ;)). Or
are you coming back to do public service now that you're rich and famous? ;)

Just kidding. :)))

Welcome back, really nice to hear from you again. :)

welcome back. you were always looking to buy a dollar stock for 20 cents. i
remember all the net-nets and the searching we all did to find a bargain. value
investing at its most pure.

if you can start posting again, what happened to the career that sidetracked
your involvement?

i hope you got involved with the energy trusts when they were presented to us
in january.

Re Value type stocks and asbestos : what are your thoughts re USG?

I'm long USG, as is Mr. Buffett.

Nothing like kicking off your return with a bang!

To all here:

I have decided to try to write a blog about my investments. I am still not sure
if this is a good idea and whether it will contain much more than what I say
here. I hope that having a blog will force me to think and write more, which is
good, yes?... ;)

Anyway, I'll mention it here just in case someone wants to look at additional
thoughts or alternative explanations of my investments.
