Started new positions in Aracruz Celulose S.A. (ARA)and Emerson Radio Corp.
(MSN. Added more shares to my Biotech company AVI Biopharma Inc. (AVII).

ARA is my value play and a hedge against a falling dollar. I just have a small
starter position as I did not want the stock to get away. I would like to add
more shares below $55.

I bought a small starter position in MSN as mentioned by Spekulatius. The stock
seems undervalued with a low book value, reasonable long term debt when
compared to available cash and a low P/S ratio which could move much higher if
new sales contracts are secured. Finally there were some large insider
purchases at current prices so it appears that they are positive for the
company next year.

AVII is no value stock but one of many inexpensive (not profitable) biotech
stocks w/ several interesting vaccines under development. This could be a total
loss or multi bagger.

I also have hedged some of my recent gains in C, HD, WM, SVU, AHM & ORCL and
expect to have stock called away in December and January. This will allow me to
establish larger than normal cash reserves to buy more compelling values when
investors "Sell in May and go away".

Nice call getting back into STRZ. I wish I was as good of a market timer as you

attempting to push a new all-time high today. Normally, they peak in Jan-Feb
when the dividend is announced, but seem to be peaking early this year. I've
had this stock for 2-3 years now, I believe, so I'm always trying to figure out

Here's a no-brainer, no-risk, can't-lose situation to make 50% on a stock
investment in 2007.

-g-. Just a little hype.
Of course there are NO no-brainer investments. Zero. Nada. Anyone with enough
time in the market and with enough buys knows that there's risk attached to any
stock bought.

And for me, my last can't-lose situation was a loser for me. (See the
responding to post). Same sort of deal here again. And I will bet again, though
this time I won't be cute and try to buy stock multiple times within several
accounts.

Pegasus Communications is going to do a reverse split. If your a stockholder
but don't own enough stock for one reversed share, the company will buy you
out. The stock's at $2.16. It's thinly traded and jumps around. (I paid more
than $2.16 for my shares.) The buyout offer is for $3.25/sh. A buyer now
@2.16/sh. (if he or she can get the thinly-traded shares at that price)will
"likely" gain $1.09 or 50% when deal closes. ("likely" because the company
could change or alter the terms of the deal. Although imo, I doubt that will
happen.) The deal will close (I am just guessing) within 3-6 months.

Ah ha. THE BIG CATCH. That buyout offer is only for stockholders at time of
record who hold 99 or fewer shares. So that's about a total gain of $108.00 on
a total investment of $214 + brokerage commission in. Would you go for such a
(miniscule) deal? Or even bother writing it up here? -gg-? I will; I would. For
me, I'll spend more time on this than the $$ are worth. I tell myself I am
looking for value opportunities wherever they might be, and I'm willing to take
any small gains that are easily foreseen and gotten. (This being what I presume
the old-time, Depression-era, cheapskate value investors would be doing.) I
bought XAN in a very small IRA, and I won't need to record info. on USA Sch. D.

since their earnings were above expectations last quarter, the p/e was around
10, and the stock wasn't much above book value

clearly i was wrong on several accounts <g>

not really worried about the longer term prospects though, just makes my

I might buy some more going into the end of the year or after the next earnings
report.

A low PE and below book value => very attractive to me. However, they are in a
niche market and have not had consistent results. => Might wait for another
earnings to come out. I haven't decided.

I think the current sellers were just looking for a buyout and were not real

Buying for dividend yield. (often a dangerous game).

I'll up my few shares in SJT. (Stock is recommended by Kurt Wulff - McDep). I
just wonder if SJT holders who are USA citizens are figuring that if they're in
these things for the yield, now that Canadian trusts are down and some are
yielding between 10-15% (less a 15% Canadian tax), it's a better deal now to
swap out of SJT (2.53/36. = 7% yield) into one or more of these Canadian
trusts. For me, who is looking to diversify and add to positions of dividend
payers, the SJT dividend yield looks good enough (attractive enough) to me to
up my shares.

Speaking of Canadian Trusts (Canroys) swapped PDS for CNE to take the loss in
PDS, and swapped FRA for CNE in another account, feeling that the interest rate
hikes which make FRA attractive may be over.
I still like the Canroys a lot, there is a whole basket of them available. If
you do chart overlays, the charts are very similar for most.
Sucking up substantial yields until at least 2011 makes them compelling. And,
there is always a chance that the whims of the Canadian govt. will cause a
change in the tax status of these trusts (again....), in which case the shares
trade a lot higher.

Jeff Everett, chief investment officer of the Templeton Global Equity Group, a
Franklin Resources unit said, "...the company trades at about 15 times
estimated 2006 earnings, which is a low valuation for the business
historically. And the shares really haven't gone anywhere, so in a positive
business cycle that means there is a chance for more upside. And the company
has been buying back shares, has virtually no debt and a cost of capital of
about 5%. So with a return on equity in excess of 15%, that for us is a winning
combination."

Okay, I've been lurking this thread for a long time, and have picked up some
good picks (thanks, guys, by the way), but I'm confused as to why CWTR is a
good value play.

Yes, the 36.9 PE would be justified by the projected growth (.44 per share in
'06, .70 in '07, .98 in '08). But this is a clothing line. How worthwhile are
some analysts' guesses as to what women will find fashionable next year? If
sales flatten out, the stock absolutely crashes. That doesn't fit my definition
of a value play, where the concept is to get a stock which can't go down much
but can go way up.

I'm not opposed to fashion lines; I made great money on Coach this year, but it
had a PE which made me comfortable.

on one hand, you are correct that CWTR is not a value play, it's more of a GARP
play

on the other hand, while COH may have a more dependable following, its PEG
ratio, which is far more important to a GARP play, is much higher than that of
CWTR, so it's hard to say that COH is more attractive on a valuation basis
(note that the "2007" number you list is the earnings for the year ending next
month, etc)

CWTR posted almost 10% same store sales growth last quarter...perhaps their
offerings will go out of style next year, but so far they appear to be
executing very well, and their customers are mostly professional/mature women,
rather than the teenagers that make companies like PSUN, ANF and AEOS much more
subject to changing whims...i'm certainly not relying on the analysts to know
what will work next year...i'm relying on the CWTR management to continue to

years it will be. That's certainly what happened with my last two retail buys,

My approach with retail stocks is to identify companies with strong franchises

pcyhuang: For CWTR to grow 20x from here would mean its market cap goes from a
little over $2B to over $40B. That would dwarf the combined (current) market
cap of AEOS+LIZ+ANF+etc. IF CWTR business continues as a retailer/seller of
clothing, the only way its market cap can get to $40B in the next six years imo
is if there's some sort of hyperinflation.

As I read the MF article, the author and head Fool, does not state he owns
shares of CWTR or has ever owned shares of CWTR. Nor is he recommending CWTR as
a buy now. Not as a value buy nor as a growth story. So I believe it's a
legitimate question for me to wonder as moderator, why is the article being
dropped into this thread without any explanation?
Could it be to discuss the pro's and con's of MF articles or to discuss issues

Hi Paul - If you can identify some new disruptive economic change or new
technology, then find a basket of possible companies that will capitalize on
these changing events (w/o going bankrupt) and you are lucky enough to invest a
few dollars, you may have the potential to see a 20 bagger.

The other key you mentioned is if you are lucky enough to accomplish the above,
you must hold your winning position and book the profits over time.

==============================================================

Winning the Oil Endgame: Principles and Progress a presentation that Amory
Lovins gave at the Commonwealth Club December 4, 2006 described a scenario
where significant efficiencies could be achieved in the use of current oil
resource benefiting the world economy. I am sure there are future companies and
industries that will benefit from these efficiencies (perhaps 20 baggers) but
even the best investors will be hard pressed to identify them.

Amory Lovins,RMI: WINNING THE OIL ENDGAME: PRINCIPLES AND PROGRESS

When
Monday, December 4, 2006
5:30 PM

Where
Commonwealth Club of California
595 Market St, 2nd floor
San Francisco, California 94105

Description
Physicist; Co-founder and CEO, Rocky Mountain Institute
Oil is increasingly becoming a challenge through volatile pricing, supply and
transport vulnerabilities, emissions, and global competition and security
issues. Lovins, who has advised energy industries for over 30 years, will
discuss the steps necessary to break our oil dependency and create wealth,
enhancing choice and strengthening common security.

(Here is a Real Audio link of his talk -
http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/06/06-12lovins-audio.html)

Rocky Mountain Institute has some great new reading. Winning the Oil End Game,
sponsored in part by the Pentagon, is a 300 page roadmap for weening the US
"completely, attractively, and profitably off oil". The stragegy starts with
efficiency, then moves to biofuels and hydrogen, all while promoting jobs and
business. Too good to be true? The whole book is available as a free PDF
(http://www.rmi.org/images/other/WtOE/WtOEg_72dpi.pdf).

------------------------------------------------------------

The one company he mentioned was Ford (F) which I own but may now buy more. He
likes the new CEO they brought over from Boeing. Also, eventually he believes
natural gas (at lower prices) will be used to produce hydrogen for fuel cells.
My plays are in the pipe lines and their distribution networks. Finally, in the
next twenty years, one may want to cut back on the integrated oils and invest
in companies that can produce (from wind, nuclear or natural gas) and
distribute hydrogen. Many of the integrated oils (especially CVX) have research
money going into fuel cell development and hydrogen production and the
distribution infrastructure.

You just have to connect the dots . . .

Paul & Carl:

You are quite right in saying that MF is not recommending CWTR, but simply
points out that CWTR has had the qualities of a potential 20 beggars. Please
note that's the reason my selected topic for discussion ends with a question
mark (?).

Yes, I have recommended CWTR as a contrarian investment when the stock came
down from 30's with huge volume and broke the uptrend line. I have CWTR in one
of our contrarian portfolios.

When I read the MF's article, my enthusiasm about CWTR being mentioned has
caused by brain not seeing the three words in the article, "in the past".
Nonetheless, I think CWTR can be qualified as a value investment since its PEG
(5 yrs. expected) ratio is >1, and is definitely worth following.

I'm sorry, but the above is complete and utter nonsense, even if you change the
">" to a "<". It has nothing to do with value investing, at least not any kind
of value investing that I understand. I'm not sure what makes it "contrarian"
either, but that word has been so abused that it's lost all meaning anyway.

You could make a case for CWTR being a GARP buy at the current price, though
even that is a stretch IMO. But there is no way to twist any definition of
value, as it is defined by those considered to be value investors, to fit CWTR
at its current price.

As I stated before, I like CWTR the company a lot. Investors who buy at the
current price and hold for the long run may well be handsomely rewarded - but I
think the odds favor those with the patience to wait.

Sorry for the rant, but I get crabby when I see the definition of value
investing get twisted beyond recognition. I think it's a sign that I'm getting
old, and that we're getting near a market top.

Sorry. I can't get that list of those value investors without registering at

I have learned to my dismay that anyone can and will call anything a value
stock. As regards CWTR, it's my opinion that if someone includes CWTR in a
subset of stocks they call "value stocks", that gives me a very good clue as to
the the size and scope of that person's subset. Way large compared to standard
subset definitions of value stocks. Certainly beyond what I could include. And
I'm one who this year could go so far as to include a stock like Google in my
value subset because of its high profit margins to stock price.

I believe CWTR could be bought for a number of reasons:
Because it's going up.
Because it's temporarily down.
Because it's the greatest retail phenomenon of the decade.
Because ten other guys who are value investors have bought it.
Because the future looks great.
Because pcyhuang says he is a buyer.

To say it's a buy though because it's a value stock, that I do not at all see.

I don't need to visit that forum to know how Contrarian investing is defined -
I think I've already got a pretty good idea of that. For example, I know that
PEG ratios and the breaking of uptrend lines on high volume, the two factors
you cited on CWTR, have absolutely nothing to do with Contrarian investing. Nor
does attempting to mimic what other investors, (value or other) buy count as
Contrarian investing - in fact I would say that's the opposite of
Contrarianism. There are lots of people calling themselves contrarian these
days, and they remind me of the teen age girls who go to the mall to buy
clothes that will give them a cool look, and who all come to school the next
day wearing outfits that all look the same.

Have you read Humphrey Neill's book? Do you even know who he is? After reading
Dremen's book (I assume that you've at least done that) how can you cite the
breaking of an uptrend line as evidence that the stock is a contrarian
investment? I'm sorry because I don't mean to pick on you, but I happen to
think using words and terminology properly is important - if you are going to
appropriate terminology that isn't yours and misuse it, you're going to have to
put up with the occasional rant from cranks like me. For all I know, "pcyhuang
investing" is the greatest thing since sliced bread and will make a lot of
people a lot of money, but from all you have posted here, I see no evidence
that it remotely resembles either "Contrarian" or "Value" investing as defined
by those who coined the terms.

re SJT - this royalty trust looks overvalued regardless what MCDEP says. My
argument is simply that a depreciating asset with a 7% dividend yield is
expected to earn (everything else being equal) less than 7% because the
depreciating rate need to be subtracted from the current yield to estimate the
current return. So for a reserve life of 30 Years, i would tend to subtract
roughly 3% to arrive at the current net return and 4% won't cut it for me.

I do not now MCDEP math but it's clear that SJT's gas won't flow forever. Of
course returns could be higher if NG get's more expensive but in this case
there are much more profitable investment around to profit from NG price
appreciation.

You are correct on all points, imo. It's that I view SJT differently.

I've never before bought SJT anytime I looked at it over the past 15-20 years.
It's always been a depreciating asset, and that has put me off. (It IS a trust,
not a viable (growing) business.) When its assets are gone, they are not
replaced, and it's all over for SJT. The thing is, over the 15 or so years, the
assets never seem to have disappeared, and the trust paid out a good
distribution. Somehow, this thing continues to survive, apparently okay
(measured by distributions paid). I'm just betting that it will continue to do
okay. Maybe not forever, but maybe for another ten years. Who knows? Maybe it's
a race: its oil is being sold off, but those oil sales might in future be at
higher prices.

I'm increasing the dividend component of a couple of my portfolios, and this
stock fits what I'm looking for: Okay distribution and a shot at price
appreciation if oil rises (and if SJT doesn't run out of it). (aside: I'm not
exactly sure what the SJT payout is called: I believe it's not technically a
'dividend', but I'll use dividend here to mean any scheduled, routine payout or
distribution.)

Perhaps as you say, SJT's not the best bet going, but then I have other oil/gas
plays which will maybe take up the slack.

Aside: I have been hoping that holding oil/gas stocks with decent dividend
yields would be less volatile than oil/gas stocks without significant
dividends. This has not been the case for me. Changes proposed in Canadian
trust laws have made these trusts both losing bets so far, and volatile
performers. Furthermore, it seems to me that the majority of e&p's, integrated
oils, as well as oil service stocks, all move together (like today, where I've
got lots of multi-point losses in a significant number of such positions). So
buying and adding more dividend paying oil/gas stocks to my portfolio(s) hasn't
helped me reduce volatility, which is a goal for me. Indeed, by continuing to
buy these dividend payers and not reduce the others, the composition of the
portfolio is being altered with a heavier weighting of these heavily correlated
stocks, and portfolio volatility has increased. Back on the other hand though,
I recall something about Buffett's "we'd rather have a lumpy 15% than a steady
9%" or words like that. I like that intellectually, not sure I like the
emotional cost to me though. -g-

Re: Ternium (TX)

Merrill Lynch out with a 37-page report saying this is the steel company to
own. Price target of $38, heavily discounted from their $53 NAV based on
10-year discounted cash flow, after adding all kinds of risk factors for latam,
blah-blah-blah. This one is going higher.

fp

Initiating coverage with Buy,
PO US$38/ADR
Total return potential of 48% in 12-mth, top pick in Latam Steels

Our price objective of US$38/ADR was set considering a target multiple of 4.5x
2007E EV/EBITDA which represents 71% to company’s NAV of US$53/ADR
estimated through 10Y DCF. Stock would trade at 17% discount to global average
at the target multiple. Ternium is our new Top Pick among Latam Steels in the
place of Usiminas. (USSPF, Buy rating, C-1-8 and Price objective of R$106/sh).

Highly profitable steel company at 37% discount to Global
Fundamentals do not appear to justify this significant discount on 2007E
EV/EBITDA: (1) Ternium should generate EBITDA per ton of US$225 or 17%
above ML’s global average; (2) 2007E EBITDA margin 1.6x global average; (3)
FCF yield of 14% in 2007; (4) has only one class of share; (5) listed ADR in
NYSE
and (6) well recognized controlling group (Techint). We believe that sooner
rather
than later investors will recognize this discrepancy.

It is also a growth play
Based on approved projects Ternium’s production will grow 5% pa up to 2009, but
the company’s portfolio of assets would easily allow it to add another 4-6mn
tons
pa of steel capacity (34-54% on current capacity) around 2010-2012. These
projects would be highly profitable as they are all brownfields (lower
capex/ton).

Well diversified assets base provides low margins volatility
We estimate that 80% of Ternium’s shipments are to domestic Mexican,
Venezuelan and Argentinean market, steel consumption CAGR (02-05) in these
markets was 2.4x Global and Latam steel consumption growth.
