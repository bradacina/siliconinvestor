Nice post, Phil.

As long as we're going to set ourselves up to look stupid in a year, here's
mine.

1. The U.S. market comes back to earth. The Dow hits 6000 and Business Week has
a cover with a bear on it.

2. Asia looks no better in a year than it does now.

3. Small stocks have a great first quarter, then get out.

4. REITS outperform GE and Coca Cola.

5. Philip Morris and Boeing are the best stocks in the Dow. GE and Allied
Signal are the worst.

6. Mutual fund outflows are going to become a big issue.

7. My best buy idea is St. Joe Corp. Short Kelloggs.

Since I make my living as a stock analyst, I would gloat intellectually, but
panic personally should these come true. At least when I am out begging for
food I can point to this post and say that I was right.

Anyway, happy New Year. And let's keep this great board going strong. Thanks
Mike. A bear market will be painful, but that's when value investing is the
most fun (so I've read). I know Mike is itching for a real drop. None of this
10% and then bounce crap. A nice 20% drop, followed by a slow, agonizing 20%
fall. Coke at 40. Nike at 22. Philip Morris at 28...AND HYDE AT 4!

>>1. Electric Utilities will be hot (on a risk/reward basis), with total
returns of 20-35%.<<

Your previous post indicated that you have a large portfolio weight with this
concept in mind. Perhaps you can elaborate.

Although the general concept seems valid, I personally don't know how to choose
the winners. In my limited experience from California, there are many unknowns
even at this stage. The old-line utilities cannot compete. They did well in a
monopoly situation harvesting 11% on depreciated book. There appear to be huge
stranded costs aside from nuclear. It's possible that upper management has been
re-educated, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. SCEdison appears to be throwing
the baby out with the bath water in the few small situations I am familiar
with. SDG&E and PG&E appear to be making superficial changes. They don't seem
paranoid enough to thrive in competition. They appear to be getting out-flanked
by such large power users as water agencies. There are lots of rogue power
brokers out there working deals with the big users. There are multi-level
marketing scams targeting the individual consumers. In California the PX is put
off another quarter, meanwhile the old line utilities are having to roll back
prices by 10%. At some point folks may realize that the utilities have been
screwing them all along - potentially a public relations disaster. I really
don't know how you pick a winner for a passive investment today.

<<2. Internet stocks will be one of the hottest sectors of 1998.>>

Undoubtedly this is correct. Once again, which one's? In my limited experience,
the barriers to entry continue to be quite low. I read the HotMail purchase by
M$FT slightly differently. I think that it indicates that M$FT perceives that
it is generating lots of cash flow from its Win monopoly, and cannot compete
outside of it. If news reports are correct - $800 million for WebTV and
HotMail, plus $125 for a piece of Apple. Go figure?

The internet still seems to be driven by 'avoided cost', there will be a
zillion companies entering and leaving. How to pick a winner? I guess try to
find one that Paul Allen has failing investment in, for M$FT to invest in.

For me, I just look to see what NT 5.x will target. M$FT is serious, and
focused on this.

<<6. My favorite company for 1998 is Checkpoint Software (CHKPF).>>

Good idea - great sector. My only caveats would be that this is a foreign
software company with one product sporting a PSR of 20 that has 1 million+
shares owned by the Vinik outfit (If you've ever been pumped and dumped by
them, you'll remember.) Do you think M$FT will add the fire wall stuff to their
NT server product? Wasn't it fun choosing companies that added functionality to
DOS, as M$FT bundled it in with each new spin? Not! (A fun place to play these
days is the database sector, as M$FT drives NT that hooks up best to its own
SQL stuff - ask Oracle, et al about how much fun they're having these days.)

BTW, there are >100 form 144 filings for CHKPF. I do not have access to them.

Uh-oh, I couldn't agree more. Should that worry us?

BTW, has everyone seen the PBS investing special? It interviews
Lynch, Bernstein, Cramer, the Fools - all sorts of people and
has a lot of surprisingly good commentary on what we are all
experiencing in this market.

They focus on one "typical" couple that made a good amount on IOM
I think and then got out at the top- despite knowing nada about it.
Now they've put 80% of their money in one stock that they got into
"because it's supposed to double by August" according to "somebody"
and they don't even know the stock's name. They have a kid, are
young and just starting out. At the
end of the program, they say that they made out pretty well on
that stock too and have now put that money into 2 similar stocks.

A rising bull floats all boats but... If they are like most they
probably had $4000 in credit card debt. Peter Bernstein commented
that this is typical -playing with "blood money" and compares it
to the 20's.

TOP THREE PICKS

AOL? I'd love to hear a value argument on that. I don't think its totally
ridiculous. I almost pulled the trigger last February near the bottom. Why now?

Mine are St. Joe Corp (SJP), Public Storage (PSA) and US Can (USC).

St. Joe - see my lengthy analysis a couple weeks ago. It trades at 90, I see it
going to 130-150.

Public Storage - a mini-warehouse REIT, the leader in the industry. Being
penalized for short term start-up losses to start an innovative new product. It
trades at 29, its assets are worth at least that with the new venture for free.
Its worth 40. Downside risk is about 25.

US Can - a chronic underperformer for good reason. The CEO is an idiot. The
board is kicking him out, and the company is very likely to be taken over. Huge
cash flow. It trades at 17, and a takeover would probably be at about 25. Even
that would be a steal - I could argue for much more. Downside risk is probably
15.

Thread: Well if you all are going to look forward, I'll look backward. Here's a
scorecard for what was posted last year - December 1996. My purpose is to see
what I can learn, stimulate a little discussion and maybe learn a little.
Here's what I did: took all Dec. '96 thread recommendations and quickly tried
to find approx. price in Dec. '96 vs. yesterday's closing. Prices are rough
--it has to be on a recuperative day after New Year's eve -g-. Sometimes there
was an analysis or discussion but not a specific recommendation to buy (i.e.
wasn't clear enough for me to understand that someone said "I am buying" or "I
recommend" versus something like "I propose you look at this"). I generally
excluded these proposed stocks except as noted. I took a one year holding
period this time, because it's easier for me to get quotes (I'm especially lazy
on this holiday day -g-); any time period must be arbitrary since there are no
sell points; historically (but not necessarily this year)it takes a while for
value stocks to be recognized in the market (yeah,I know one year could even be
way too soon);and finally, there may be some learning for us with a one year
period. This is a snapshot only, so I don't specifically intend that my numbers
relate to any individual's real world performance. Still, it's nice to know who
can do well under these arbitrary criteria. And the players are...

B.D.:
MKIE 7 - 6 (that is: was about $7 in 12/96 post, now about $6)

Mike Burry:
MDR 18 - 36.5/8 (proposed?)
TTELF 22 - 14
NTR 15.3/8 - 26.1/2
OTEXF 8 -13.1/8
MCL 19-15
PRNI (takeover. cannot find prices)

AN 79 - 85

Harlan Huber
NTK 15.7/8 - 26.1/2

Chris Kay
TGIS 8 - 12.1/2 (I really panned this pick --oops -g-)

Paul Klemencic
Tweedy Brown Global (I have no quotes for this popular fund.)
CRE 13 - 12
CEE 13.1/2 - 18
DSWLF 9 - 15.3/4 (not sure if he actually recommended it)
BHE 15 -22.5/16

Benjamin Lunsford
OAKT 21 - 29.11/16

Scott Mc
BZH 17 - 20
THTX (could not find Canadian(?) quotes on common. Scott
actually was recommending the preferreds.)

Paul Senior
OLS 14 - 15
JCP 47 - 60

John Wasikowski
NTK 15.3/8 - 26.1/2

White Shoes
OTEXF 8 - 13.1/8
NSCP as a short sale (the only one on the thread in Dec)59 - 25
(that is sell short at 59 in Dec. 96 and stock is now 25)

That's almost it. Here's what I think I see (I may be misinterpreting or
overgeneralizing way too much): If there was a discussion about a particular
stock where two or more people owned it, especially if one person bought based
on the recommendation the first, there seemed to be a strong likelihood that
that stock did well in the subsequent year. We have these instances: OTEXF,
BHE, NTK, JCP. If there was an infrequent poster who only recommended one stock
(and -g- especially if the poster started out with the word BUY this stock --
that stock and those stocks were losers (12 months later). We have for example:
USDL, MKIE, CTEK. I also notice, that some of the people who have recommended
the "winning stocks " now don't seem to have them in their profile or don't
recommend them anymore. So my question to you is: are you patient enough or
were you patient enough to hold the winners for one year. If not, and you sold
at a loss or no profit-- you need IMHO to reevaluate your ability to sit on
your hands! Methinks there's a bunch of you out there missing out on
capitalizing on your own good stock picking abilities. (I think it's age
related... but I'll save it for another post.) There are a couple of people who
post infrequently but who seemed to have done well this year: Chandler Everett
(a stock mkt professional)-- his picks were few but large caps which were in
vogue this year - oil,bank. Paul Klemencic-- you don't want to go up against
this guy. I know because I keep trying -g-. A retired guy who makes it his
business to do absolutely thorough research on the stocks he buys. He uses a
sector approach as many of you know -- the sector now being electronic contract
manufactures. Often heavily margined (JMO) he trades as well as holds long
term. I disagree with his methods, but it's impossible to argue with his
success (and easy to argue with my mine -g-) In these '96 December postings
Paul recommended scooping up some country funds that were selling at discount
to NAV. That proved a winning approach. But Paul's record is not IMO the best
of the Dec. '96 picks. In my next post, I'll identify the best stock picker and
his picks. No losing positions and a few triples. Wow!

Your analysis of the 3 issues sounds solid. Position in AOL is

underselling it -- it has that all important factor going for it

Okay, I'll post my picks. I'm a member of an NAIC-based stock club and will
mostly recommend stocks that have been purchsed by the club.

EXAC - Exactech. A small, Gainesville, Florida manufacturer of replacement
knees and hips. A microcap that was beaten down to
4.75 at end of year. Revenues are growing by 25 percent per year but EPS was
flat due to funky accounting practices and the write-off of an Italian
subsidiary.

PTII - Protective Technologies, Inc. (hell, I'm not sure I have the name right,
but the symbol is correct). A manufacturer of children's bicycle helmets. The
company has experienced strong growth in revenues. WSRN.COM reports that the
company is losing money. However, this is more of a paper loss than a real
loss. They converted a large amount of preferred stock to common stock as a
result of meeting certain management performance goals. Another micro-cap.

BIOI - Biosource International. The best way I can describe this company is
that it is a materials supplier to the Biotechnology industry. The stock was
trading at 5 something at the end of th year. Management announced that it will
buy back 10% of the outstanding shares.

Paul,

I don't see how looking back a year can be a judgement on stock selections.
From what I'm seeing, very few on the thread have held stocks that long.
Earlier in the year we had a hot tech sector, then various companies with Asian
exposure were hot, at one point it was oil stocks, and at the end of the year
these stocks were the big losers. We've had a lot of buys show large short term
appreciation and sells when they reached a point above 'value'.

It's been a volatile year. Active investors would adjust to events. Many have
had a good year, but own none of the picks of a year ago. While you may trade
less than others, I know that you too have sold off positions for profits or
because the situation changed or you found a better buy.

I highly respect your opinions (even though it sometimes changes mid post -g-)
and have bought many of your recommendations. I made a profit on almost all of
them and I thank you. However, I own none of them today.

Electric utilties.

I forsee valuations rising as industry consolidation accelerates. Already we've
seen major mergers creating firms like New Century Energies (NCE), CINergy
(CIN), FirstEnergy (FE), and Ameren (AEE). Short-term, there could be negative
pricing pressures as monopolies are broken down, but I see some parallels to
the strong performance of the Baby Bells in the face of ongoing deregulation.
It's also my impression that power generating capacity cannot sprout up
virtually overnight, thus adding value to existing power assets as
consolidation increases.

In regards to choosing utility investments, I look for companies with large
market capitalization, smart management, attractive geographic positioning,
decent dividends, etc.

Internet sector.

I think it's only a matter of time before Microsoft acquires one of the major
search engine companies for access to its technology and sitelists. Most of the
market capitalizations (Infoseek at 282mm, Excite at 510mm, C-Net at 377mm,
Lycos at 562mm, etc.) are cheap enough for Microsoft to acquire without much
trouble. Heck, they just paid a rumored 400mm for HotMail and 800mm for WebTV.

Contrary to what many think, I believe the barriers to successful entry on the
Internet are reasonably difficult. Replicating the success of an Amazon.com or
Lycos is not as easy as throwing some code together in a matter of weeks. Even
a simple idea like free browser-based email has shown decent barriers to entry
with both leading sites, 411 and HotMail, being acquired by Yahoo and MSFT,
respectively.

>Do you think M$FT will add the fire wall stuff to their NT server product?<

Spirited competition from MSFT is indeed the greatest threat to Checkpoint
Software, and one that bears watching. However, I think that the firewall in NT
would be basic and lack the size and scope to compete with Checkpoint's
flagship Firewall-1 product at least for the next few years. For example,
Microsoft Antivirus is part of Windows95, but it hasn't by a long shot stopped
people and corporations from buying anti-virus software from Symantec, McAfee,
etc. Not to mention that firewalls are more complex than desktop antivirus
programs in a lot of ways.

Philip, thanks for the response.

My understanding is that there is to be separation among the power generation
function, the transmission function, and the actual power itself. I understand
generally how it is supposed to work in CA with the PX and oversight group. I
guess that there will be hourly dutch auctions. I'm not quite sure how the
power is sold into, and bought out of this market structure. Do you know? Does
it make a difference?

Your likening the situation to the telcos is compelling in its simplicity. My
concern is that power consumption is not necessarily rising the way
communication traffic is. I would think that there will be some winners AND
some losers. The early losers I would choose generically would be the municipal
electric utilities. However they won't know that they are losers for some time.
You suggest some that are winners - I cannot argue since I don't know how to
rate management. (One that puzzles me could be Cinergy. How can branding by
putting your name on Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati help? Is this modern name
recognition or is it evidence of management extravagance like the old CG&E used
to display with their stadium boxes?) Without the help of the Public Utility
Commissions there to guarantee profits, will it make a difference. For a
significant time many will continue with their old utility, so maybe owning the
transmission lines may insure business. In CA stranded costs will be amortized
over the next two or three years, I think? Does this hobble the locals?

Maybe I'm looking at the trees and missing the forest. Do you have some
putative rules of thumb?

Philip,

What's MSFT advantage in outright aquiring one of the "search engine"
companies? In most cases, these companies are already partially owned by other
companies (e.g. Intuit's interest in Excite, Reuter's interest in Yahoo, and
many others) and significant benefits are derived from these relationships. An
aquisition by MSFT might upset a few people and place MSFT in a bad situation.
I can see MSFT picking up a stake in one or two, but I'd be really surprised by
a major acquisition.

I know the winner, Richard Barron.

He actually was the first to recommend Deswell(DSWLF). His other picks have
done even better, many doubling or tripling. Even one of his not so hot picks,
ADEX, tripled this year, before it sold all the way back down.

I was really intrigued by Richard's picks last January and February, and began
researching them, but found many were so small and so difficult to get info on,
I gave up on most. I posted my research on a couple on this thread (LUKN and
OJ); somehow I managed to research some of his poorer picks. I didn't buy
either. I looked at MWL, ADEX, SNSR, BONT, REA, MAL, ELXS etc. very briefly and
passed. I had kept a notebook on Richard's picks, but I simply couldn't keep up
with that and my efforts over on the Electronic Contract Manufacturing thread.
I look at some of those moves now, and they are astonishing.

Richard tends to trade in and out a lot, but seems to gravitate around some
core stocks. He must have a terrific stock screen system.

BTW- thanks for the kind words on my picks. Tweedy Browne Global Value returned
about 22% on the year, OK for an international value fund, but less than the
S&P. The Central European Fund (CEE) closed end had a good year, and paid a big
year end gains distribution. CRF went up and down with the Czech market and got
trashed this fall. I sold it at 15 last spring (I think) when it traded at a
premium instead of its usual discount. Recently it looks good again, if one
thinks the Asian contagion won't spread to Eastern Europe.

And Deswell I sold in the low to mid 20s before I bought back in the last
several months at an average price of 18.40. The last earnings report this fall
was very good, but got lost in the Asian sell-off mania. I think Deswell is a
great buy here; the valuation looks similar to where is was last fall. Check
the discussion on the Deswell thread, and see recent comments on the stock by
Richard Barron, Ron Bower, and Mike Burry, along with Ron's write-up on his
discussion with the CEO Ricahrd Lau.

OTOH, I've had my share of poor picks this year; Smartflex (SFLX) is my biggest
gross $$$ loser, and I averaged up on Nam Tai(NTAIF)and lived to regret it.
(Although now, with over $9 in cash and the stock at 14-15, it looks like a
good value; I continue to hold most of my shares and all my warrants.) And I
have an even worse dog in my portfolio that I am ashamed to even mention on a
"value thread".

I must admit, I traded more than I should have, and missed some run-ups. I
appreciate your analysis of last December's picks, and hope some stocks we both
own, like Elamex(ELAMF), do well in the new year and beyond.

My value picks this year would be some foreign stocks, DSWLF, ELAMF, NTAIF, all
trade about 7 times earnings, and my GARP picks FLEXF and DIIG (both around 12
times my forward earning estimates and will grow over 40% next year), and my
turnaround pick is ACTM. I even own some Jabil(JBIL) bought at 31, as a GARP
play, since I expect growth of over 40% for it in 98. Notice I will concentrate
in the ECM sector, which has really been hurt over the last two months based on
the Asian FLu concerns.

If anyone wants to spend the time investigating and pursuing the tiny
micro-caps that Richard Barron chases, I can contribute some effort.

I agree with your speculation; however, picking the winners may be difficult so
early in the game. There are some outsiders - like Enron - jumping into the
fray that have to evaluated differently. The management of the existing
utilities may not be up to the challenges deregulated markets present. Now the
markets are not fully deregulated except, maybe, in places like California.
Some mergers like PEPCO and BG&E have fallen through and the newly merged
companies will take a while to know what they have got and how to use it to
best advantage while fighting off competition.

It will be very interesting; however, IMO different than the telephone
deregulation because the structure and dynamics of the industry are different.

I don't think anyone can doubt Richard's stock picking ability, but I tried to
follow his recommendations and get swamped by the number of stocks he posts. I
don't see how he does it. I think he tracks at least 100 REITs in addition to
following numerous mini-caps. All I can say is pay attention if he recommends a

Scott,

I put a lot of emphasis on management ability and it's logically measured by
the historical success of the company. My philosophy is 'companies that make
money will continue to make money' and I think history proves this. I'm amazed
at recommendations that have never shown profits. I have a big problem with
'they've been losing but they are going to turn it around', particularly on
companies deep in debt.

JWC management is mid/late-40s. This makes them old enough to know and young
enough to be aggressive. They have rewarded shareholders in the past and, with
their high liquidity, should continue to do so in the future. The earnings
growth has been good, but the shareholder appreciation has been fantistic. If
you read deep into their history, you'll find some dealings that have been
excellent. They are sharp!

You might note that they've reported earnings of $1.53, but they increased
stockholder equity by almost $2.00 and had earnings of .62 the last Q. '98
earnings will likely be over $2.50 and stockholder equity growth exceed that
amount.

I may be coming into this conversation a little late, but does someone here
think that utilities will be able to see earnings gains of 25 to 30%? Or is
this gains in appreciation in the value of the utility stock minus dividends?
Or does this include dividends?

Much of the recent gain in utilities has been because of investors move to more
defensive issues where they can ride out this correction. Right now, the
investors who are sitting out this consolidating market through the purchase of
utilities will move back into the stock market. When investors do move back
into the stock market, the defensive issues will get hit, and this includes the
utilities stock. Add to this the prospect of rising interest rates in 1998
along with the possibilities for inflation, and you have a formula for an
upcoming correction and continued weakness in utilitiy stocks. This is because
the value of many utilities is determined by the stock's dividend yield in
relationship to prevailing interest rates. Do not forget about the ongoing
deregulation of the Utility industry and the impact on earnings that this will
portend, at least from what little I have heard about it.

If you were going to capitalize on utility stocks, that opportunity IMO has
already come and gone. You have already had your 30% exceptional gain which
happened this last year in 1997, and you have had a 50% gain over the longer
term since 1994, at least using the DJUA as a guide. To think you will see
another 25% to 30% gain in 1998 is being IMO just a little optimistic to say
the least.

As far as I have always know it to be, utilities are a defensive strategy
during weak markets, and also an avenue to the generation of quarterly income.
Utilities are not growth stocks. Utilities do not make good value investments
over the longer term. I do not understand why this has changed. Have I missed
something here? I think there are much better ways in making money with a very
manageable level of risk.

I will be working on a few positive posts in the near future. :)

I agree with your thinking here, Ron. Why go for the "shot in the pan" when
there are value plays on companies with a solid track record, and at least know
what a profit is like? Why go for the unecissary risk that this approach
implies? It is already risky IMO to tie up one's money in a particular company
for a long period of time. Why place your hard earned cash into a company of no
known management record and earnings performance record? A better play on
comapnies like this would be for the shorter term investor who is in the
position to diversify where this investor expexts only something like 1 out of
4 or less to pop and produce profits. There are the penny stocks for this type
of play. And the entry fee for a penny stock is also much less than for other
stocks. IMO both approaches have something in common called gambling.

The value is in entirely in the mind of the beholder because there is nothing
substantive to base the value oriented purchase on except "can bes" and
promises by an unknown management team and their dreams of success with *your*
money. Matter of fact, the individuals in management do not have to be
successful in producing a real corporate profit in order for themselves to
profit from their position. IMO this is particularily true in turnaround
situations. Think about that.

Given that we're now discussing avoiding interminable turnarounds or
never-showing-a-profit stocks, HEAT comes to mind. The price is very cheap it
seems, but here we have a company in a basically simple business - distributing
heating fuel. (Okay, I will accept that no business is simple, but IF there
were a simple business...) So why can't they ever make a profit? Stop. That's

I agree w/you that the lack of profit is not what one looks for, however, the
accounting for this company is more complex than that, as they buy a
distributor with very few assets other than customer list, which are amortized
on the books, thus causing a significant amount of the loss. If you look at
last Qs results, you will see that it appears the turnaround strategy is in
place, and customer attrition has diminished - definite positives for this
company.
Mgmt. is trying to make this seemingly "simple" business much more high tech; a
state of the art distribution facility serving the NY metro area provides
excellent service and more profits for the company at the margins. To my
knowledge, this is the first mgmt. group in this industry to aggressively brand
the heating oil product - with the "Petro" name and logo.
Mgmt. has large incentive in that options vest at MUCH higher prices (of course
it can be said that this has been the case for several years).
I readily admit there is risk in the weather (it is currently warmer than the
norm in the NE), and the fear of El Nino is certainly a factor. The elements
have not been kind to the company in the recent past, and this will always
remain the great question mark.

And, at the risk of sounding defensive, I mentioned PMOR to this thread back in
the late spring below $5 (it is now 9 7/16 bid), and that idea was summarily
dismissed as the thread generally felt the company had too much debt on the
books.
BTW, and off topic, I have seen you posting on the ESST thread. I'm interested
in ESST, as it has strong financials, but I'm wondering if someone has better,
more advanced product out there. The stock certainly has been beat up.

Bob,

Feel the same on utilities.

I just had an interesting conversation with a local Union electrician. He's
starting six months of work at Commonwealth Edison next week. Seven days a
week, 12 hour days, $28.00 per hour plus benefits. Over $4,000 a week. Cost to
company over $6,000 per week.

IMO - Utilities have a government mindset that prevents profits in an open
competitive market. With deregulation and time, the weak will be weeded out and
the strong survive, but which is the weak and which the strong? The trick is
chosing correctly. This goes to the argument about management track record. In
the case of utilities there are no track records for management because
government regulation has given them a guaranteed profit.

Utilities have always been a good income stock due to their high dividends, but
with highly unionized labor forces, EPA restrictions, and no history of profit
incentive, deregulation may mean utilities are in for a rough ride.

Paul,

Based in Florida with newly opened offices in NY, JWC has a small, but stable
and primarily wealthy client list. While they derive revs from trading, it is
not the basis for their profits. They are highly respected as money managers,
investment counselors, and market makers. Their growth has come because they
make money for their clients.

While they have made good growth in revs, very good growth in earnings, the big
thing is their per share growth for stockholders. They bought back a major
portion of shares at a price under $3.00 on a low interest note payable, paid
it off from profits, then issued a stock dividend to remaining shareholders.
Most recently, they acquired AGRO in a stock swap that effectively sold JWC
stock for $8.85 (market price was 7.50 where I bought it)and added almost $5M
cash to their liquidity just before the market takes a dive. The monies were
being invested (they hold a lot of securities) this past quarter and the
results of these investments will be shown in '98. This is typical dealings for
them.

Get this - most companies pay for a credit line. 1-2% even though they don't
actually use the monies. JWC has a credit line but the bank holds some warrants
on the company in lieu of interest and JWC handles all of the banks market
activity (bonds, T-bills, etc.). The bank wants JWC to succeed because of the
warrants, JWC gets substantial profits from clearing the banks business.

JWC is affiliated with Bear Sterns. JWC doesn't have access to all markets so
they clear thru BS, BS uses JWC as a market maker for IPO's, secondaries, etc.

Just some of the things in my notes on them.

For what it's worth,

Wallace Rivers: re HEAT, PMOR, ESST, OUCH.

Well, you make the case for HEAT. Certainly looks like they can lose money
indefinitely, and as they continue to try to improve, eventually at current
very low price, something may/will change to bring the stock up to prior high
levels. It's a company I guess where you have to have some faith. I don't have
any. JMO.
Re PMOR - nice call on your part. I recall that for me, it wasn't so much that
the company had a lot of debt, but rather it competed with much more well
entrenched and financially able companies - Dayton Hudson Target? and KMart and
Walmart -so the debt load would prove to be a difficult burden when they needed
to expand/remodel or otherwise respond to competitive threats. I remember
thinking couple of months back that I underestimated what I thought PMORs
options were when I read something(?) about how pretty smart they were being
now about getting into some joint ventures with another company(?) regarding
their stores. And I notice now (Yahoo) they seem to have a bunch of cash too.
I've missed the runnup that several of these beaten down retailers have had -
Venture stores (for a while), Filenes(and I particularly studied this one, but
never bot...sigh), PMOR, Claires, etc. etc. Anyway, for me and IMHO, I'd rather
you risk sounding defensive because people couldn't see the value in PMOR, than
come back angry (or not post at all) because some jerk/jerks had talked you out
of a winning stock. That being said, I still don't like PMOR -g-.
Regarding ESST.... ouch. I own at higher levels. I'm betting on a triple from
here within a couple of years. And I'm very wrong it appears. Sales are
increasing, margins decreasing. I'm guessing biggest threat is Intel who is
(are?) coming out with chips for this market. There are only a couple hundred
employees in ESST (they outsource their manufacturing), so they can be, and
have to be, fast and flexible. I'll deflect question of ESST's biggest
competitor, biggest danger to the ESST thread experts. But with only 200
people, my guess is that anybody (some small startup for example)could come out
of nowhere to hurt them. For me, their financials look okay, they've got good
contacts in Asia, a good history of making money, so I'm holding on. And I own
a package of these small tech companies, so I expect (hope) to be insulated
from utter catastrophe. Paul.

Jyoti re MERCS. Looks like it could go into a value investors portfolio. Been

what they were all about. An entrepreneurial?? German or Swiss company?? In
some sort of paper business. I thought only Canada or US or Asia had trees for
chopping up -g-. Looked like they cobbled together a company. And I've since
noticed MERCS appear on a couple of value screens. Now it's even still more
undervalued apparently. (Well okay... undervalued is somebody's opinion, but
certainly it's at lower price.) Price is down maybe because of their upcoming
restructuring efforts, and they have the dreaded word - Asia - in their
quarterly report. (Seems like all the paper companies are down - I occasionally
follow (don't own) WY. And maybe none of 'em are down far enough yet in this
cycle.) On the other hand, maybe all the bad news re. MERCS is already
reflected in MERCS' price. What more do you know about this Mercer

companies that were clearly undervalued on an asset basis. As they moved up to
'normal value' - which was typically an appreciation of 50-100% in stock price,
I had the pleasure of banking the dividend which was in the 5% range. My sense

Dan,

I love the "repeating shibboliths doesn't improve investment acumen" and you
are right.

If I were interested in power utilities, I would look at them the same way I
would natural gas - the companies that control the power sources (gas wells)
and the distribution (from the wells to the customers) will likely control the
market. I would discount any companies that buy for distribution except as
acquisition targets. I likely would also stay away from those companies with
potential environmental problems. After all of this is considered, I would look
to areas of high growth.

If it were me, I'd look for an undervalued company in the Southwest or far
Northwest with hydroelectric power generation that is also a distributor. One
that has been expanding. I would allow them to have a heavy debt load and low
liquidity because it would likely be due to expansion of distribution.

Did you make the appreciation on water utilities recently when the market moved
to income stocks or was it earlier in the year? Either way, it was excellent
investing to have monies in a safe income sector and getting a 50-100% return.
What criteria did you use when you bought them to determine they were
undervalue?

For what it's worth,
Ron

Ron, thanks for your response.

My valuation of water companies came from pricing the 'value' and marginal cost
of the underlying water assets in some water companies in the western US. The
simplest one to understand was SWWC whose price had been knocked down by a
chlorine spill. They were being priced on the basis of a reduced dividend and a
small water utility in the San Gabriel Valley of LA. Overlooked was their
ownership of a tiny water utility in NW Albequerque. Two inches from their
district was Rio Rancho which is where Intel located one of their big Pentium
fabs. (They also have the management contract for water and waste water in Rio
Rancho.) Didn't take rocket science to figure that development in their service
area would boom when Intel donated $25 million to the Rio Rancho High School in
return for supporting the float of $8 billion of industrial revenue bonds. As I
recall I figured that the worth of their water rights in the San Gabriel basin
alone was worth two to three times the value of the market cap. Then this year
the city of Albequerque threatened to condemn their utility in that city. It
appears to be a no go, but the cost estimates were ~$10/share on a $14-16
stock. And they would still have their San Gabriel Co. and management
contracts.

I like dumb stuff like that. I suspect that the power utilities will have some
mispricing with deregulation. An interesting relationship I've found is that in
the West, water and power are interchangeable. The water never comes when it's
needed to the place it's needed. So ignoring the plumbing, it takes power to
get it there. The commodity cost is frequently nil compared to the power cost.
But you do have to allocate the capital costs of the plumbing, which are huge,
but govt owned, and are by definition mispriced. Most of the water speculation
vehicles are concept stocks pushed by brokers. Hardly anyone with a brain
follows this stuff. In the land of the blind, the one-eyed guy is king - I try
to keep an eye on it.

Paul,

Regarding MERCS I do not have a lot, here is what I know:

MERCS used to have a financial services business which they sold in 1996. Cash
was partly used to upgrade their paper plants pay down debt.

Insider ownership is 33%

They have two paper plants one in Dresden makes paper products from recycled
fibers. The other Zellstoff und Papier fabrik Rosenthal makes sulphate pulp.
They have spent a lot of money upgrading these plants. MERCS also used to have
a partnership with Korean Shin Ho group in Dresden plant I do not know its
current status.

They are very frugal with their money in a typical Swiss fashion.

Obtaining information is very difficult about the company. Last year in March,
I called Zurich several times and finally able to speak to some one in finance.
He told me at that time they were going to focus on their paper and pulp
business and 1997 was going to be a transition year. He never sent me an annual
report. I speak German well and even then it was difficult to get detailed info
from the company. Some how it appears they do not much care about the outside
investors.

Last two quarter results have been good and having invested in former East
Germany they probably have tax breaks not shown on their balance sheet. I also
like the idea of their walking away from Concert deal in Canada. I intend to
call them again and hopefully find some one in Zurich who can provide
information about their competitive situation.

Paul,
Thank you for the compliment. You must be pretty thorough to have researched
back to post #85!!!.
I try and figure out which stocks are undervalued with decent growth, or return
15% by staying steady. I also trade REIT's.
The easiest way to make money on value stocks it find a bucket of stocks
growing by 25% or more and trading at 12 times earnings or less. I also look
for any growth with a P/E under 7, and ones trading at less than 70% of book
value. I look at every earnings report in IBD every day to screen the stocks.
Currently some examples:
ACTC - growth slowed to 50% earnings growth in the last quarter, and P/E is
under 15 now. Consolidater with huge growth. I will buy more under 4.
ADAM - turnaround potential 2 quarters of earnings after years of losses. Am
waiting for 3rd quarter report, but if .07 or more, I may accumulate.
ADEX- Low P/E in a company that shows it can grow. Will buy more near 16.
ALPH - buy near 11: recovered strong in last few weeks. Decent growth over last
few years.

This is taking to long, I'll just list the rest and why it is a decent value.
APPB- consistent growth, low P/E.
BMLS- 70% of book, low P/E.
DSWLF- *** - most undervalued stock on the market. Safest to build a position
slowly or accumualte on a breakout above 19. Waiting for next earnings report
will show effects of Asian problems if any. 35% earnings growth with a P/E
under 8. Pretty incredible value.
ELXS-Great management, very low P/E 5 years 15%+earnings growth.
GES- Very Low P/E
ISTN - accelerating growth, am trying to buy below 9
MAX-low P/E after one bankrupt customer writeoff backed out.
MEOHF-very low P/E.
NMGC-*** Huge growth P/E- less than 15 on last quarters earnings rate, looks to
me like they are blowing away any competition.
OO- President bought another million shares at prices near these levels showing
high confidence in long term prospects.
PTNX- Very low P/E with flat revenues. Apparently revenues may accelerate
QGLY- risky, but huge growth with low P/E. Must be scared of competition
hurting their margins.Stock has been very weak
SBEI- risky, looks great except flat revenues in last quarter and very weak
stock price. Very low P/E with huge year over year growth.
VIP- Risky, russian company. low P/E strong growth. currency worries.
ZILA- biotech that is breaking even and consolidating industry of dental supply
distribution and lots of potential for a cancer detecting agent for mouth
cancer. If the agent gets FDA approval, this could go up 3-10 fold in a few
years. If not, The company may be able to be worth 50-100% of current price in
2 years or less by new growth.

here are the huge potenetial winners that I am waiting for another earnings
report that have huge growth.
ADVH - 100%+ revenue growth, price is 25% cheaper than it was 5 months ago.
DHSM - 100%+ revenue growth . I'll buy under 10
ESCMF- 200%+ revenue growth. I'll buy under 35.
MODT- 100%+revenue growth. I'll buy under 20.
NTAIF- risky since revenues dropped quarter over quarter. Very Low P/E
SCSC- just following
XC-Just following, low P/E, great insider buying also.

Bob, as a utility person I can agree and disagree with the above. Historically
speaking you are right, utilities do not make good value investments over the

their core service offerrings. My utility is in the home security business,

maintenance and other home appliance repair. We are also looking at power
marketing and energy services in the near term.

I can also agree that there are much better ways to make money with a a lot
less risk. Those utilities that do it right though will add a lot of
shareholder value. Note that "shareholder value" is the driving force behind my
utility (BGR) and is probably so with others as well. ;>)

Yes, I can see where deregulation will open up some possibilities for some
utilities to increase shareholder value. I see from a quick look at a couple
utilities that some companies have went abroad to purchase or build other
plants. I think it is a big unknown at this point as far as which companies
will end up in the long run succeeding in the new business environment that
deregulation provides. I think there will be some casualties, and also costly
learning curves by the companies that do survive and actually utilize this
period in time successfully to increase profits. I think this situation needs
to sort itself out a bit and take form before an intelligent value-oreiented
investment choice is made. Now there are probably allot of speculative plays
available at this stage. Just my opinion.

Still, a utility specifically involved with appliance repair?? I have rarely
seen a diversification (spelled diworsification using the Peter Lynch
dictionary) like this work. For one thing, there is no synergy involved here
that I can see. Considering the asset value of a utility company and compare
that with the money that can be made through appliance repair efforts, how can
the income derived from the appliance repair side of the business ever be worth
the company's efforts by showing up on the ballance sheet as a significant
entry? Odd. But the point you are making here is well taken by me.

On the utility front, what other areas do you see that utilities will consider
as new future business? I am trying to put myself in the shoes of the President
of a utility with respect to figuring out how to capitalize on what
opportunities deregulation will provide my company, but I am having difficulty
here. It is easier to see how deregulation can take what profits I have away
from me.

Perhaps electric cars???

Bob, points are well taken, these new areas aren't for everyone, but consider
this. Appliance repair is a billion dollar business and many utilities are
already in it. Couple this with bill protection insurance, accidental death and
dismemberment insurance, and power surge protection insurance and you have a
tidy sum.

We got into appliance repair as a load retention strategy, to prevent propane
gas and oil from taking our largest load, water heaters!

Another reason is customer loyalty. As the local utility we have gained a lot
of trust and customer satisfaction, which in and of itself does not lead to
loyalty, but value added services can. We have just failed at a new joint
venture in telecommunications but will try again with another partner if
possible (phone, internet, cable tv). we have the infrastructure (poles and
wires and people) and the billing capability.

We will also be involved with energy services (power marketing, conservation
etc..)in the future.

We studied electric cars too for many years, and I test drove them quite a bit
myself! Not certain of their future yet but battery technology and flywheels
are getting better all the time.

We have state of the art call centers, billing systems, and GIS (gepographical
information systems). The possibilities are endless. well enough rambling for

Thread,

Reviewed Richard's list. If one were to take a position in everything
mentioned, would likely have a good return. I can't keep track of that many and
won't try. (How does he do it??) After running thru the list, I narrowed it
down to two stocks and bought MEOHF this morning @7.50.

Canadian company that produces methanol for commercial purposes on an
international scale. They have an easy to find homepage that's investor
friendly and up to date. Earnings will be out the 28th.

Last reported BV was $6.62. It's slightly higher as they've been buying back
shares and will buy back 10% of float. Highly liquid with $840M current assets
against $152M current liabilities, $580M cash, about $350M long term debt. FFO
has been very big and earnings reflect large depreciation and amortization.

Current reported earnings of .58 due to writeoffs last 4Q, but they've made .88
last 3Q and are projected to earn $1.07 for '97. This puts PE at 7. FFO/price
much higher.

I presume price has dropped because it's a foreign stock (Canada?), due low oil
prices, and international exposure but these things aren't likely to inhibit
earnings and may improve them due to lower costs in international operations.
They currently have 30% market share and steadily improving.

I would like others to review and look for a downside. It's very attractive to
me if I didn't miss something. I'm not very familiar with the sector, but
low-pollution fuels sounds good to me.

For what it's worth,

Medusa Corp (MSA)

Has pulled back 20% from this year's highs, but remains a very
well run and low-cost producer of concrete and mineral supplies
to the construction and agriculture industry.

ROE has been about 40% over the last 5 years, now trading at
about 6.7 times trailing operating cash flow. Much recent capital
investment in distribution should pay off, along with 3 1997
acquisitions. Is # 1 in several of its segments, though the
market is admittedly highly competitive and fragmented. This
really means more growth for the low-cost producer, which
Medusa is.

Debt/equity of 0.2, current ratio > 2. With housing starts up,
may be a way to play a dual-sided economy (where multinationals
and techs suffer while US basic materials companies thrive on
the rate-inspired construction growth).

The stock hasn't done much in the past year, but long term trend
is very much up.

Ram,
I just use a company that has consistently grown both revenues and earnings.
I like to see consistent quarterly growth as well as yearly.
MEOHF is a cyclical company that has a huge percent of the commodity market.
About 2-3 years ago a company was interested in buying a significant position
of MEOHF when it was near 7, They may be accumulating again.

All the restaurants I mentioned are struggling, but have performed well long
term as far as growing earnings and revenues. They earnings has slowed down on
all of these. ELXS is the only one I know that is accelerating earnings without
much growth, but they aren't expanding much, so they concentrate on managing
better instead. APCC was a darling that fell out of favor a few years ago. When
the earnings turned sour, the stock dropped 70%, and then when earnings
stablized and started to grow, it tripled it's price in less than 2 years.
Same with BBY. Same with AVID. When the franchised restaurants stablize
earnings and start to grow again, I expect a return to multiples of 15-20 or
higher. These will generally double when that happens, but I don't feel that it
is here yet. I like ELXS and APPB best at these prices followed by RDHS, STAR,
RAIN, and APSO (which had insider accumulation, but they must have been
surpised also). If any of these pull back another 15-20%, I'll start
accumulating, with 1/3 of my desired position. If I'm too soon, I won't get
burned bad, and the long term prospects should still be good.

NMGC should fly if it's next earnings continues from .09 to .15 to .25. It is
possible to come in .30 or higher, which should propel this stock trading
around 14. I don't know what the streets projections are, so do your own
research. Earnings are probably at least 4-5 weeks away. 1-408-988-7020 is the
# I have.

I feel very wary of the market at this point, and will make up my 3-4 week
direction after Friday's employment report. I fear it is going to be
significantly stronger than the bond market is anticipating. If so, I'll be
short more than long on new investments. The street is finally believing that
15% earnings growth is not going to happen for the S&P this year, which should
limit the upside, even if bonds stay strong.

Here are some very low P/E stocks from a 3 month old list. ABL, CPN, IBIN,
PFINA, WRC, DYHM. Some may be worth researching, especially if they show strong
earnings,

Here are a few stocks that had significant share buybacks.
ABIX, JAR, BOSA

I also like EML and MRE.

I'm not following these as I'm trying to find companies capable of rapid growth
with low valuations.

Richard

Remember Sybron Chemical? I brought it up here at around 22,
and I rode it to 32.5 on a management takeover offer, but got
out as I didn't want to play the arbitration with that gain.
Paul I think you played a little arbitration with it.

Now it turns out that the management group revealed the value
with its offer. GenCorp evidently offered 38/share in cash for
Sybron. But today Sybron rejected that at the same time it revealed
the offer. Closed today at 33 1/2 on a trading halt.

This will be interesting. I guess we know the private market value
is well above that.

I used the same strategy in finding Sybron to find Knape and Vogt
Manufacturing (KNAP). It's advancing now too. The strategy is based
on ultra-low-profile boring US-only businesses with steady growth, low PE
multiples at the low end of the historic range, high management holdings, and
conservative financing.

I was reading Graham and Dodd I think when I saw that there were
several ways to ensure predictability of earnings. Buffett pairs
steady growth to monopoly situations. But you can also pair
steady growth to boring small caps that are never spoken of, and
hence more likely to be in industries not overstocked with
competition. The book may have been Copeland's Valuation, but
I'm too tired to think hard on the source.

I know a bit about Calpine(CPN).

There is thread on SI about Calpine. It got knocked when it missed the Q last
fall because of unseasonal strength in natural gas prices last summer, and the
slowness in recovering the increased fuel costs through their contracts.

This stock is highly leveraged, but should have some great earnings next
year(more precisely,next summer). I think the stock currently at 16 could hit
25-30. I also know the insiders at the company are very bullish on their
prospects, and are probably buying shares in the last several months (I can't
say anymore than that on this subject). Calpine is HQ in San Jose, my hometown.

I need to do some research on the industry sector. The sector is not
universally recognized, but on SEC Edgar they call it Cogeneration Services and
Small Power Producers (code 4991). CPN does about $200M a year, but this is
growing fast. Some of the other companies listed on Edgar in the same sector
include AES corporation in Arlington,VA(~$1200M), Destec Energy in
Houston,TX(~$500M), Ogden Projects in Fairfield,NJ (~$700M) and Oglethorpe
Power Corp in Tucker,GA(~$1000M). I know very little about these companies at
this point.

You noted that I like to concentrate on sector analysis. I am attracted to this
sector because I am quite familiar with cogen plants and I view the growth
prospects favorably. Next to hydroelectric power, and nuclear power (minus
"sunk costs" and decommisioning costs, both fixed costs), cogeneration power is
the cheapest power out there, provided they have good reliable captive
customers for the steam. In a deregulated world, the independent power
producers have a significant growth opportunity. Essentially all new power
capacity will probably be cogen gas fired plants. Most cogen plants up to now,
were often owned and operated by the captive steam user, so most were owned by
oil or chemical companies, paper, food processors etc. For example, Mission
Energy was part of Texaco and provided steam for oil steamfloods in Kern
county, California etc. and Midland Cogen partners provides steam and power to
Dow Chemical's huge Midland, Michigan complex. But now, many companies prefer
to stick to their knitting, and are looking to outsource cogen suppliers. CPN
has picked up a lot of cogen plants. Also CPN has been building some cogen
plants. They have been spending the money, and issuing some stock, and haven't
seen the revenues and earnings hit home yet.

Next year Calpine was supposed to earn about $2.25 a share, significantly
higher than this year, and so at 16 looks cheap. Several caveats; their
earnings are strongly seasonal, breaking even in the winter, and making all
their money in the summer when electric prices are stronger and gas prices are
lower. Also some of the major utility companies are pursuing this sector, like
Duke Power. Duke just bought some plants from PG&E in California, and surprised
everyone with how much they paid. I was going to calculate a $/KW price for
those plants and value CPN generating capacity that way, but haven't done it
yet. Until then I view Calpine as GARP play.

Well, I only have an incomplete story, but that's what I have so far. I would
like to investigate the sector, if I had the time. i'm not surprised that this
stock showed up on Richard's list.

Could you explain negative growth? By my

I outlined on my web site. Forbes had a

it has a lot going for it and investments will

growth to make this one a good buy here.
I'd give no-growth companies a PE of 7,

Mike,

I wasn't referring to Medusa, but to the sector. In surveys taken at the end of
the 3rd Q. the sector had great growth and were expecting it to continue. More
recent articles indicate strong revs in '98 but that sales will not increase as
much as in '97. In some areas of the country they anticipate flat to negative,
yet others look for the growth to continue.

I just looked and Medusa's operations are located in areas where growth is
expected to be the highest. However, revenue growth is not necessary for profit
growth. The trend has been for the larger operations to acquire the smaller.
The big outfits are constantly looking to buy small existing operations and the
smaller ones are disappearing. (If they can't buy, they force them out.) They
are being aided in this by government policy and regulations. Their objective
is to control the market area. (You can't pack up and move a mine) Once this is
achieved, the profits take a huge jump.

I'm surprised at Medusa being so cheap because they have been one of the most
agressive in acquisitions in recent years. You've made a very good pick,
particularly in this market.

Sorry about any misleading comments. I should have looked at Medusa before I
posted.

This morning is a good example of value to me.
QGLY has 40 million in sales the first 9 months versus less than 1 million last

dropped 30-40% in the last 2 months. Today they announced a stock buyback since
they feel the company is undervalued and they have almost no debt.
Percentagewise it's only a 1 or 2 % buyback, but this is the first year that
they have been profitable. The current P/E should be less than 15 x 1997
earnings and maybe as low as 10 x 1998's earnings.

I've tried to buy into weakness and sell into strength.

Four people whose opinions I respect have indicated we have a Bear market. I
have felt this to be a market correction. Tech stocks, stocks with Asian
competition, and stocks with high PEs are being sold sold off and IMO it's the
thing to do. At the same time, many stocks are being sold that will continue to
do well.

I think we are now looking at a sell down of some stocks but the monies will
come back into the market. IMO the strength will be in stocks that continue to
earnings growth and more conservative issues like your Medusa. If I'm wrong, my
recent buying may be a mistake.

What do we have? Bear or correction?

Richard,

Another question: I've been looking at MAX and think it might be attractive at
this level. The writeoff isn't as big a thing as the market has made of it.
They seem to be a very well managed, well capitalized, high growth company. Do
you have any additional comments or info?

Thanks,
Ron

Ron, whadda correction! My portfolio screen is all red! Have never seen it this
bad (or good - depending on your perspective -g-). The one stock I want to buy
is, of course, up. Hey, there're clowns out there actually buying HYDEA - it's
up a 1/4. My only up stock! It's starting to feel just like '87. Yikes!

Paul,

Doin' a little better - got 2 flat and one up with the rest red. Still a little
ahead for '98, but not much.

Where's this market going? I can see reasons for some stocks to sell off, but
everything seems to be going down. When something like your NWLIA is losing
there's no sense to it.

I guess I've got to start paying more attention. Just been going along
researching certain stocks and ignoring the markets until this morning. The
comments about a Bull market yesterday woke me up.

Do ya think so? Gimme an opinion? Long term down or does the money come back?

Today was scary. Now that I'm home, I put on my "individual investor hat", but
at work today at a large fund it was ugly. Normally sensible people were
selling just because everybody else is selling. I am worried about Monday. But
then again, if we get a 500 point drop Monday I would be very happy in a way.
Look for maximum gloom and doom over the weekend to scare off all those buy on
the dips people.

These Asia concerns are not off-base. It is hard to get good information, but
the more I get the more concerned I am.

In the next few weeks, earnings start coming out. I don't think its going to be
pretty, and if you think its already in the price, you're crazy. Like value
investors were saying months ago, an 8,000 Dow has perfection priced in. And at
that point it was perfect. Which is exactly what scared me. When perfection is
the standard, things can only get worse. The only question is when.

Sorry for the gloom and doom, but I will be the happiest person in the world,
though a lot poorer, when this market reprices to the point at which value
investors can really do their stuff.

Ron: Surprised at how many of my $20-30 stocks are down $1 to $2+. May be only
down a couple of percentage points on the indexes, but it sure feels much
downer than that in my portfolios. Okay, I'll venture an opinion on the US
stock market - it's going to recover. (This said in an optimistic mood, and
before I go over to Barron's On-Line to get their usual (IMO) discouraging
commentaries and negative prognostications.) I think US citizens are flush with
money and have no place to put it for returns they want and for returns they
expect other than in the stock market. There's no competition. Real estate,
precious metals, gems... forget it. Bonds offer safety (maybe) and peace of
mind (maybe). But at under 6% they're not right for the times IMO (unless
you're speculating on continued fall of interest ratres). Well, we're all antsy
because we've been told 3 consecutive years of up gains like this is a record,
and we're told that the market is high and the market is risky. And stocks
better go up the first 5 days of the year or it's trouble for the whole year.
For anyone trying to get ahead (and I am surprised at how many of us older guys
are still trying to do this!)owning stocks is now and still the only game
around (unless you start your own business). Money coming out of market by
funds which are selling, they will
redeploy back. Individuals getting flummoxed by ups/downs of individual stocks
they own will move to more ownership of mutual funds where the effect is netted
out by the overall portfolio (except on days like yesterday -g-). Asian
problems will get worse: it's one thing to push down on poor people who haven't
had a venue for improving their lives; quite another (IMO) to try to reduce
expectations of improving poor and middle classes who have got a taste for the
goodies of capitalism. Especially in Asia (I opine) where lowering one's
standard of living may be like losing face --- something that must not happen.
Therefore, I predict that - unlike with Mexico, the Asians won't go quietly ---
but go they will.
Meanwhile I try (not too successfully sometimes -g-) to stay the course. On
this thread, for me it is: buy undervalued stocks and sell them when they
become fully valued. Regardless of the overall market. Yesterday I sold
nothing. I did add to my position in ELAMF. I started a very small position in
TIMT, a titanium supplier to Boeing. Planes will be built, titanium will be
consumed, profits will be earned (I hope). I like TIMT's locked-in growth (my
margin of safety), price in low half of it's yearly range, sorta-ok pe, ROE
(which is better than Boeing's I think), and the fact it's now owned by several
very savy mutual funds (or was until yesterday -g-). I don't like that it's
controlled by a wheeler-dealer guy whose family apparently is fighting with him
over control. And stock may be more "reasonably valued" now than "undervalued".
Overall though, I bet TIMT profits double in 3-4 years; stock price should do
okay too. JMO, of course. Paul

Nice thread. I am evolving from a momo, growth type investor to a value
investor in this market (Many of my previously growth stocks are now value
stocks :( ) Looking at book value, PSR, etc.,
I've found a few that I will throw out for comment if anyone has thoughts:

Cypress Semi(CY): fundamentally sound chip maker selling for 1.2 x's book

KLA instruments(KLAC): test equipment mfg. book at 2.6 x's (cheap for
industry), no debt, better prospects as a test maker

HCIA: Med info company with nice prospects but recent losses, selling at .9% of
book (my favorite stock right now)

Morrow Snowboard(MRRW): Fundamentally sound snowboard mfgr. hurt by industry
wide inventory problems. selling at 50%(!!!) of book value. Will be one of the
survivors or acquisition candidate in coming consolidation.

Cabletron (CS):Pummeled networker selling at 1.74 x's book and 1.5 x's sales.
Don't think they are going out of business. (CSCO 12 x's book)

Rainforest Cafe(RAIN): A new value play since getting hammered; 1.4x's book,
lots of cash, expected growth around 25%, forward PE of 13

Paul,

We seem to be in the minority on the thread. My thinking has been basically the
same as yours and commentary by those pundits I trust has been the same. This
is a correction in a Bull market, not a Bear market. Monies are going out of
stocks with Asian competition, banks with Asian exposure, the entire tech
sector, etc. We have a very unusual combination of international economic
events. Asia is obvious, but we also have a large drop in oil stocks, in
precious metals, and other things that normally don't happen at the same time.
While the US has unemployment of 4.7%, Germany is over 11% and France over 12%.
The US economy, job creation, inflation, etc. is an enigma to the rest of the
world. Economists don't know what to make of it and the result is panic in the
stock market.

I just had to cut a lot of stuff that was basically a repeat of what you've
posted. IMO - Investors aren't going to be happy putting monies into 5.7%
returns and the Funds have to put the monies back into the market. In 45 days,
after the earnings are posted, some stocks will be providing major returns.

I transferred cash and doubled my account the end of Dec. I've been buying,
have 25% cash left and am looking to be fully invested by end of next week. I
had some big losses averaging down on Deswell, but am doing just fine the last
few days. My recent buys have been firm, even some gains. Deswell flucuating
but staying above year end tax selloff prices in spite of Asian bailout.

Thanks for posting. The Bears were giving me concern and it's nice to see a
post that reflects my thinking.

LOL

Paul,

Would you please take a quick look at MAX and give me opinion. Haven't bought
yet but considering. I've gone into the writeoff from a Chapter 11 customer and
it's not as big a factor as the market is making it out to be. This market is
overselling on any bad news. Interested in your thoughts on their growth
potential.

Trying to diversify my sectors.

Thanx,
Ron

Ron: re: MAX. I think Mercury Air was rated as one of the fastest growing small
companies by INC. or some other group. One of the things they do, it seems to
me, is front money for fuel purchases to "iffy" airlines who in turn then buy
their jet fuel from MAX. Apparently margins are good, and this can be a very
profitable niche business. Of course, as occasionally happens, one of these
"2nd tier" airlines goes bankrupt or defaults; this is apparently what has
recently happened. MAX has taken the hit and is now increasing its reserve for
losses. One concern might be... how many more of these defaults are waiting to
happen? Lots of small airlines out there from every country and lots of concern
(my opinion) about decreasing tourism, business travel. Financials for MAX
don't look so great to me - that is, I don't see anything that appeals to me. I
do like that sales seem to be increasing rapidly (which may be very easy when
you loan customers money to buy your product)and psr is low (which I would
expect from a fuel distributer-type company)
Ron, you might want to look at CGO (Atlas) also in the niche airline market.
They help majors by transporting cargo. PE estimates for '98 are about 10x. (I
try not to use analyst consensus estimates - but okay here for just a general
discussion.). PE of 10 is okay for this business. I wouldn't pay more. (And I
don't own the stock. Just offering it up for a looksee.) Stock is down from
much higher levels.
