Hi Paul

RE: Investors Real Estate Trust (IRET)

I was looking for IRET to replace a small fairly valued utility position in an
IRA. I need something that generates income, will hedge future inflation (they
own real estate), and can be purchased at a good value.

As you pointed out, the upside is very limited (perhaps 10%) and the company
has a history of accounting for much of their dividends as a "return of
capital" thus reducing your overall cost basis over time. Therefore, future
capital gains would be exempt in an IRA account.

Another sector that should benefit from the E&P Oil & NG shale well growth are
the MLP pipeline & distribution companies. The EPD and DEP deal is one of many
I believe will be done. These companies have less upside than some of the more
successful E&P companies but you get the immediate payback from their revenue
stream(s). Many can still be had at pretty good values (ie PE's less than 15 w/
industry avg at 21 or higher).

I think some excellent value opportunities still exist in many of these NG
gathering companies too. Many times partial partnership interests are sold to
MLP's while the remaining interests are held by the growing E&P company (eg.
MHR and GMXR). I am going to focus my "value" hunt in this segment (both with
MLP buyers and the E&P sellers).

Thanks for the feedback on IRET.

"6 Energy Companies With Undervalued Natural Gas Reserves to Consider Today"

http://seekingalpha.com/article/254278-6-energy-companies-with-undervalued-natu

I don't know the exact land holdings GMXR is acquiring or their worth. I see
two positives though:

1. Two different areas being bought: Niobrara and Bakken. So some diversity,
giving a chance that at least one of the two might prove to be a winner.

2. "$1.8 million in cash and up to 2.7 million shares of stock" for 67.7K net
acres. 2.7M x $4.60/sh, plus $1.8M = $14.22M. Which is $2100 per net acre.
That's not very expensive considering what some of the alleged prime acres are
selling for recently in these two areas.

I wasn't alert to get the shares at Spekulatius lows, and I bought at higher
prices. I have an order in to buy a few more shares now.

I think you had great timing on selling MHR-C.
I just read conf call transcripts--ceo Evans hinted he might issue more pref
shares--what do you make of these quotes?

"We have been successful in our perpetual preferred stock offerings. We started
the year with only about 4 or 5 million of that outstanding. We ended the year
with 100 million. We sold that ourselves under our at-the-market program with
another firm up in New York, and we'll be doing some other things in that
regard, we hope, from now until the next few weeks."

and later on:

"We have absolutely zero plans to raise equity capital in 2011 at this point in
time. Now, we have other plans to raise capital, but they're not in the common
equity market."

I wonder if they might extend the C for another year and issue another 4million
shares at 25? Wonder what effect that would have on premium?

<u>Our Take on WMB Restructuring</u>
HOLT Suggests More Upside WMB's stock gained 8.4% after announcing plans to
separate into two companies. There may be additional upside as Credit Suisse's
HOLT group calculates a potential value of $38 / share:

<u>Consolidated Valuation:</u>
WMB is priced for stable 6.2% CFROI levels and 2.5% asset growth. Valuation
remains conservative to history as the market has tended to price WMB to
improve CFROI ~200bps.

<u>Sum-of-the-Parts Valuation:</u>
o WPZ: $18.37/sh assuming WMB’s 77% interest is valued at market
o Other Midstream: $4.48/sh assuming stable CFROI at 7.3% through 2014.
o E&P: $4.91/sh assuming CFROI decline from 2.1% to -2.6% by 2014.

<u>WMB Plausible Upside:</u>
Assuming WMB’s E&P segment is valued in-line with peers, which are priced for
4.4% CFROI levels, $38/sh (35% upside) is warranted.

One piece of the value puzzle that maybe missed by some is the value of WMB's
GP interest in Williams Partners (WPZ). WMB owns ~210 million units of WPZ
(~75% of the total) that has a market value of ~$10.8 billion or $18.40 per WMB
share. In addition, WMB is expected to receive about $285 million of cash
distributions from WPZ for its GP ownership. This cash flow is taxed at a
corporate tax rate (we assume 36%). If we apply a multiple of 15 to 20x
after-cash flow, we arrive at a $2.7 billion ($4.68 per share) to $3.6 billion
($6.25 per WMB share) value for just the GP interest. To note, other integrated
natural gas companies with a GP ownership include OKE, EP, and SE..."

They don't have to "extend" C, since it is a perpetual convertible. They might
not call it though. This is good from the yield-to-call point of view. However,
the premium is going to go away by Dec 2012 anyway, since after call date there
is always a risk of call at any time. (Some people may risk buying callable
security at premium, gambling on no call. If so, any premium is just icing if
you want to sell...)

The issue of additional pref shares is somewhat neutral to pref holders. Issue
of more senior debt would be negative, issue of common would be positive. ;)
Issue of prefs is a negative to common holders even though there is no
dilution. The company still pays 10.25% on every share issued. Sucks the cash
like there is no tomorrow. ;) Of course, who cares about cash, it's reserves
that matter. :P

If Evans can charm rating agencies and fixed income folks enough, he could
issue lower coupon pref and call all the C's. That would be a coup for common
holders and would suck for anyone holding C's.

Disclosure: I hold some MHR-C. I may buy if it drops to par soon. I will sell
if the premium goes to 26.X.

Since Evans said he plans to do something in the next few weeks,
it will not involve calling the C's since they need to give at least 30 days
notice prior (earliest being 12/14/2011).
So my guess is additional issuance--the premium did not start until they sold
the 4 million shares.
Fair to assume a return to par if he does?

Hi Custerinvestor -

I believe the MHRpC series was authorized for $100 million (4 million shares)
and to sell more shares they would need shareholder approval. It's still pretty
expensive money at 10 1/2% at par.

I was looking at their other revolving debt facilities and they are much lower
around 5% but w/ different loan covenants. To me they have two options: (1) up
the authorization limit on the preferred C series from $100 million to $200
million or (2) issue a new series (perhaps a convertible stock option) that has
a much lower rate maybe at 5% w/ a stock conversion price at $9.00/share (35%
above current price).

Within the last 90 days I have had two companies (SFL & ULTR) go with the
convertible preferred issue to raise more capital. They typically provide for a
non callable initial term (eg 48 months) w/ the option to convert to the common
stock at any time. The marketed range was 3.75% to 4.25% coupon at an initial
conversion price of 30% to 35% above previous days close for SFL. ULTR did a
similar issue but had to offer a 7.5% coupon. SFL raised $100 million and ULTR
raised $54 million. Both offerings were over subscribed. You can see that the
cost of capital is much less going the convertible route.

If they extended the authorization limit in #1 to $200 million, the MHRpC would
drop to the $25.00/share PAR. If they did some type of convertible preferred
issue the #2 option, the MHRpC would trade higher in price so that the
effective yield was equal to similar risk E&P debt and at today's rate/risk
would probably yield around 9% (especially if it was superior to any new
issue(s)). The common stock would be stuck in a trading zone capped at the
conversion price until the fundamentals far exceed the conversion price and/or
the convertible preferred series was called in.

A lot depends on how much money they need for their capital budget for the next
four years. If $100 million is sufficient, I like the idea of a convertible
offering. If they need more, they might as well issue more stock, dilute the
shares rather than paying for expensive preferred debt.

From everything I read, I did not see an estimate by the company of their
capital needs four years out. That is what I would like to see both as a holder
of the MHRpC shares and common shares.

Please be aware that ceo Gary Evans spoke at the Enercom conference earlier
today and stated that MHR would NOT issue equity in 2011. He also stated that
the two acquisitions in progress (NULCF/NGAS), were the capital raising MHR
would do for 2011. MHR common shares were being issued for assets with limited
debt attached, thus improving MHR's capital structure.

He further stated that plans were to call the $100 million of MHR Series C
preferred shares at year end and issue a $150 million MHR Series D preferred
issue of shares. Details to be announced in the near future.

Seems like a very smart move which should allow MHR to issue a preferred stock
with a lower cost of capital based on a year end improved balance sheet, income
statement and borrowing base. Especially if, as he stated, MHR's production
would increase to 10,000 barrel of oil equivalents per day.

Texas for $14.5 million in cash. We expect that our partner in our initial
Eagle Ford Shale acquisition will purchase up to a one-sixth working interest,
or approximately 700 net acres, in the newly acquired acreage. The acquisition
brings our net Eagle Ford Shale acreage, all believed to be in the volatile oil
window, to approximately 10,900 net acres..."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

PVA is a holding I continue to accumulate.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=PVA+Key+Statistics

They are still considered a small Cap with an EV of $1 Billion. They show a BV
of $22.08/share, 25% below the current market price. The company has acquired
Eagle-Ford acreage at an average cost of $4,000/acre well below recent sales in
the area (eg. CNOOC).

The company also owns a partnership interest in midstream & NG gathering
operations in Oklahoma and Texas (ie. PVG). This asset allows them to collect a
steady growing income stream which they use to pay shareholders a nice
dividend.

This company fits my conservative "value" model for an E&P company w/o the risk
of a micro cap and/or small cap start-up. Also, no foreign political risk as
all of their holdings and development are in the U.S..

My initial fair value target is $38.00/share - $48.00/share. A lot depends on
future price of Oil, NG & Coal and their success in their new well development.

This is a company that has been around since 1882 and owns a lot of land assets
(including lumber & mineral rights) at a very low cost which is not reflected
at market prices in their balance sheet.

conversion to PVR. There's no safety of principle as I view it for me, because
1)the deal isn't yet approved by both parties (It will be though, imo), and 2),
the juicy spread that now exists can close at any time if PVR stock drops while
PVG just stays where it is. That'd wipe out the reason for my buying the stock.

able to elbow them somewhat aside. I'm not interested in having my small

Closed out my position on XCO. I expected a better move higher with all the

monies into many of these smaller E&P companies that produce both oil & NG and
have a large exposure to NG in my CNX position (which I believe has another 35%
to the upside), I thought it was a good opportunity to raise some cash.
Original position purchased 9/16/2010 at $13.30/share. Closed out the position

Peeled off some shares of HON @ $56.60/share. Durable good orders not as good
as expected. Not too sure they can meet the analysts estimates of $4.69/share
next year especially if the economy slows with such high oil prices. The
relative dividend yield for HON is low at 2.5%. They did announce they were
going to pay off $168 million in 5.6% debt that they may reflect in a future
higher dividend. Still hold a stub position but believe there are better areas
to deploy the funds.

Odd to me is that SUBK stock price is now below levels of past five years --
below where the bank crises cratered so many bank stocks.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=SUBK+Basic+Chart&t=5y

Yet the bank is still reporting positive earnings, and (so far) seems to have a
.60 annualized divided (2.9% yield). Perhaps the stock drop is a result of SUBK
having cut it's dividend and people exiting the stock. (Company was previously
a Mergent "dividend achiever".) There seem to me to be enough positives that
I'd expect the stock to be at least up at or above the level of Feb-Mar '09
when the world seem to be ending for stocks, esp. bank stocks. Other bank
stocks I'm seeing that are survivors have risen from those lows. So did SUBK,

http://www.marmon.com/sectors.asp?Member=true&#167;=true&id=6&trans=true ) had
a 20% increase in their earnings in 2010. Buffet continues to buy the remaining
privately held interests in this company as it becomes available.

Buffet must see tremendous value in these pieces of his rail empire as he
continues to spend billions on more of its components.

I remember one of the guys big on free cash flow being very down on the cruise
industry saying that pretty much all the profits and depreciation go to buying
more ships. did not do any of my own due dilligence, but it made sense to me
that people after a while wise up to the fact that you can save quite a bit on
cruises if you dont drink, gamble, or shop. in mexico i went to an all
inclusive resort. they might have made more money than usual on me as i am such
a cheap drunk. on the other hand i have a healthy appetite. I flew on jet blue
and anecdotally lots of negative sentiments expressed on that one. the flight
home was delayed in fort lauderdale by 3 hours. 1/2 hour before we were
supposed to board they announced that the flight crew was being brought in from
jfk and was only now getting off the ground. when we got off the ground the
pilot said the delay was due to mechnical failure of the first plane. while i
was waiting a woman next to me said that she had been trying for 3 days to get
back to nyc but several flights were cancelled due to mechanical failure. she
was not a happy camper.

Hello Jurgis,

Yeah, I seem to know when to buy them, it's selling them that's generally my
problem. :) I get interested in a sector and then buy the ETF, but I have a
hard time knowing when it's overvalued enough to sell.

That being said, I like getting into them for international purposes these
days.

Transitioning a bit - any thoughts from you or anyone else on E these days with
the Libya exposure? It dropped a bit initially based on the Libya exposure. I'm
just wondering if it's undervaluation is less at this point based on increased
risk.

TOT gives me less worry on Libya though they both have exposure in areas that
are having trouble these days.

DKA, which owns a good chunk in both TOT and E, gives me less heartburn and I'm
considering rolling E into DKA for that reason...

Thanks,

Hello Jurgis,

Yes, good point about diversification. If I wasn't at a 5% position, I wouldn't
care too much either. It's amazing how much I watch and think about the
companies I own at that level.

My rough research (and maybe I'm wrong) has E with 10%+ of output in Libya but
TOT at maybe 2%. I made the switch today of E into DKA, but I kept my TOT.

A bit off-topic, but I added to NXY recently as you did (though I think you got
a better price!). I'm enjoying that it seems to be pushing a 52-week and

The thing to remember with VSEC also is that a good portion of their revenue
has come from pass-through revenue on the R2 contract that is being phased out.
The decline in revenue there doesn't hit profits too much.

But everyone sees the big drop in top-line revenue and backlog and thinks the
company is in bad shape.

From the 3rd quarter 10-Q:

"A significant portion of our time and materials revenues are from CED R2
Program task orders under which revenues result primarily from the pass through
of subcontractor support services. These revenues have a lower profit margin
than revenues generated by work performed by our employees."

This company is trading at 2.5x tangible book with negative free cash flow and
declining revenues. The multiple is low, but so is the profit margin, and the
quality of earnings are poor. The management may be great, but the economics of
the business are dependent on factors outside of their control. Current

Hello Jurgis,

Yes, I'm interested in biotechs these days, hence the GILD question. The p/e
looks good compared to potential growth. I'm still trying to figure out this
revenue multiplier valuation and how that works in. Supposedly, 2.5x revenue is
a normal valuation of a biotech, though 1-5x is supposedly reasonable? GILD at

definitely like the p/e. I may buy some shares after watching for a while.

re: VSEC I'm not agreeing with a couple of those other points. 

Could be that "quality of earnings are poor". I can't agree or disagree,
because I don't know what the statement means.

The profit margin is low. This has been mentioned previously. Okay, but low has
to be taken in context. Profit margins in this business for VSEC have always
been low. They're higher recently than they have been in the past. It's my
opinion if profit margins are "high", the USA government will step in and
renegotiate those profit margins down. I'm buying the stock, so for me, I look
at what I have to pay to get those puny profit margins, and the price fits
within my model for a value stock. Other potential investors who have a
different view about those margins will avoid the stock.

by Randolph McDuff
July 29, 2009
A Eureka Moment For Kansas City Southern (KSU)

Cyclical Short Term, Secular Mid Term, a Eureka Moment in the Long Term.

The mantra of efficient market proponents is that all known information
regarding a corporation becomes quickly priced into a stock price.

Such disciples suggest one cannot consistently outperform, based upon
information that the market already knows, except by luck.

I believe that there are two basic flaws in the efficient markets premise. The
first issues lies in the fact that statistical analysis and forecasting cannot
ably handle uncertainty. Accordingly, analysts prioritize or triage
information, largely based on short term valuation models. A minor development
in the near term carries infinitely greater weight for most analysts, as
compared to a longer term development. Secondly, efficient markets theorists
tend to focus quite narrowly upon company specific information. Unintended
benefits or consequences from external sources, even if already in the public
domain, generally fail to be taken into account. Until such developments are
conclusively linked to a specific company, external news will have virtually NO
impact on statistical investment modelling.

However, on occasion, some investors correctly determine the impact of external
developments on a corporation and its competitors. This flash of insight,
completely overlooked by analysts and the investing public at large, is
sometimes referred to as a "Eureka Moment". It is my opinion; that the highly
prized, greatly sought after, yet seldom found "10 bagger", arises from a
Eureka Moment.

I believe that for Kansas City Southern Railroads (KSU-NYSE, $17.50); a Eureka
Moment occurred in August 2008.

In a nutshell, a series of little known and relatively unreported tax changes,
imposed by the government of California in 2008, may eventually result in
wholesale change to the flow of imports throughout western and central United
States.

In the long term, California's actions could result in some very detrimental
unintended consequences for Burlington Northern (BNI-NYSE, $74.55) and Union
Pacific Railroads (UNP-NYSE, $56.54). My prediction is that the single greatest
unintended beneficiary of the change in trade flows will be Kansas City
Southern. A secular windfall could accrue in the longer term, for new
shareholders of KSU.

Who is Kansas City Southern Railroads?

KSU is the smallest of the 7 class one railroads now operating in the North
America. Roughly 1/10 the size of Burlington Northern, Kansas City Southern is
sometimes referred to as the free trade railroad. Most of the major class one
railroads operate a continental operation, traversing east to west. KSU, in
contrast, runs their tracks from Mexico into the mid continental United States.

The company has been investing heavily to increase its Mexican-US freight
business.

Capital expenditures of more than $1.26 billion have been made in the past 3
years. As a percentage of revenues, this is almost 2X that of larger peers.

The average age of KSU's locomotive fleet is just 10.9 years, and is considered
to be the most modern in the industry. At year end 2008, KSU owned 5584 pieces
of rolling stock, up by 86.5% since 2004. The rolling stock has been
modernized, and is now among the youngest among railroads.

Total liabilities have risen sharply since 2004. However, based upon all
important ratios, it seems clear that Kansas City Southern has invested this
capital to improve the long term competitiveness of the business. KSU continues
to grow its inventory of owned equipment, vs. leased.

Other rails have had to allocate major capital to address chronically under
funded pensions. In contrast, KSU reports just a $28 million healthcare/pension
shortfall, at year end 2008.

A major capital project is now turning to sales.

The Rosenberg line is now operational. Completed for an estimated capital cost
of $170+ million, the refurbished 70 mile line eliminates the need for KSU to
use 160 km of heavily congested track owned by Union Pacific. An estimated $18
million per annum in right of way charges and fuel savings will be generated.
Shippers will benefit from reduced transit times, which management anticipates
will lead to increased business. Full utilization of the line should reduce
total annual operating expenses by about 1.2%. (Source)

A second major capital expense will be completed by 2010.

70% owned by Kansas City Southern, the 320 mile Meridian Speedway line is now
in the latter stages of a $300 million refurbishment and expansion. The
expansion capital is being fully funded by Norfolk Southern Railroad (NYSE-NSC,
$36.54), in exchange for a 30% interest in the line.

By 2010, the Meridian line should be able to accommodate 45 trains per day,
almost double the present amount. Transit times by shippers throughout the
south-central US will be reduced by about 7 hours. KSU will not only save
millions in operating expenses on their trains, it is possible that other class
one rails will increase their use of the Meridian line, creating substantial
right of way fees.

Completion of the major projects should reduce KSU's future annual capex by
more than half.

After a four year period (2005-2009) where KSU invested an average of $350
million per year in capex, management now anticipates about $150 million per
annum to sustain the business. Any incremental spending in the future could be
considered as potentially accretive for the top and bottom lines.

The recession cast aside certain views that railroads were positioned to manage
the swings of the economic cycle.

Perhaps this would have been true during a soft landing, but the US economy
recently experienced the largest economic dislocation since the recession of
1980.

All railroads were impacted. Kansas City Southern was the hardest hit of all.
Investors who purchased KSU late in the last cycle suffered from a serious bout
of unbridled enthusiasm. Analysts placed far too much emphasis on the long term
the free trade story, and ignored competitive forces in the transport sector.
It appears that they completely forgot about the cyclical nature of the
business.

With greater financial leverage than larger peers, and a major capital works
program in mid stream, KSU fell from a $5.5 billion market cap, all the way
down to a small cap, within the past 52 weeks. The market cap reduction of more
than $3.7 billion seems to have removed all but the most intrepid of
shareholders. Large cap mutual funds were forced to divest the shares based
upon cap weight restrictions. Mid cap funds were going through massive
redemptions and could not add the stock to their portfolio lists. Retail
investors were largely overwrought.

Analysts have belatedly remembered the cyclical issues, and now appear to have
discounted KSU as a cyclical recovery pick.

Just 15 months ago, KSU management was anticipating as much as $2.8 billion of
annualized revenues in 2012. EBITDA was anticipated to be as high as $1.17
billion in that year. EBITDA margins were forecast to grow to almost 42%, up
from the 30% level achieved in 2008. (Source)

Intermodal growth was forecast to be the main driver of revenue. With the
expansion of a key container port (Lazaro Cardenas) scheduled for the end of
2010, KSU was anticipating intermodal revenues to grow by almost $500 million
through 2012.

Now, in the tail end of the current recession, KSU is now looking to generate
possibly just $1.4 billion of revenues for 2009. EBITDA might fall to as little
as $400 million.

While existing KSU shareholders remain in shock, new investors may have a
remarkable opportunity.

Business has fallen off by less than 25% since 2008. EBITDA seems to have
fallen off by about 30%. By way of contrast, Kansas City Southern share values
have declined by more than 68% from their 52 week high. The share price decline
appears excessive.

With 90.75 million shares currently outstanding, KSU has a market cap of $1.58
billion. Add to this the estimated total liabilities (less short term cash) of
$3.1 billion, $216 million of preferred shares and the result is a current
enterprise value of roughly $4.9 billion.

Kansas City Southern now has a "Made in California" secular benefit, to add to
the cyclical recovery story.

1. A sea change in the international shipping industry occurred in August 2008.

Little known to the general investing public, the State of California passed a
series of levies and taxes. The intended victims are Asian producers and
shippers of consumer goods to the United States. A series of new fees are now
applied against international shippers. Port charges again these shippers have
gone up by 160% in California.

State port taxes and levies now add an extra $160 per TEU, to the basic
container handling charge in California.

Until recently, Asian exporters had few cost effective alternatives to getting
goods into the United States. Consequently, California is earning taxation
revenues that would be classified as confiscatory, and possibly illegal, by
trading partners in other countries. Expressed as a percentage of the cargo
values, port fees, dwell fees and taxes at California ports now exceed 5%, a
global high.

Domestic shippers and outbound freight are largely exempted from the new
tariffs and fees, and have remained very quiet about the tax changes. In the
eyes of the legislative assemblies, this robbery appears to be a victimless
crime.

2. To add insult to injury, the Longshoreman's union is doing to the west coast
port industry, what the automotive unions did to the domestic auto business.

Average cash wages for the typical West Coast longshoreman exceeded $138,000 in
2008. This is the highest paying blue collar job in the world. Over and above
the exorbitant wages, benefits are second to none. The union boasts full health
care coverage without deductible, fully paid by the employer. In total, the
average wage and benefits package per full time longshoreman exceeded $179,000
in 2008. (Source 1, Source 2)

In order to pay such ridiculous sums, a total of 9000 containers per employee,
per annum, must be processed. With net margins on container handling at ports
average about 20% globally, it appears that the most recent longshoreman's
contract will push the two ports into the red, when container volumes drop
below 15 million TEU.

Based upon the extraordinarily high cost of labour at California ports, it
appears that insufficient funds will remain for future modernization and
expansion of Long Beach and Los Angeles.

The failure to reign in longshoremen's wages coupled with sharply increased
shipping charges; has effectively priced California out of the international
container business.

Unlike ports, vessels are mobile. The great shipping conglomerates of Asia can
and will change where they will ultimately unload freight, as soon as an
alternative port becomes available. Most of the Asian ships heading to the US
come with fully loaded containers, and leave with empty containers. They are no
ties to keep the shipments flowing through the US west coast, if a viable
alternative may be found.

All that shippers require is a deepwater facility with direct access to roads
and rails, and California will stand to lose every bit of container freight
that can't be directly consumed within the state. More than 65% of total
container volumes are at long term risk of displacement.

The long term economic risk to California cannot be understated. 1 million
California jobs are directly and indirectly tied to the international shipping
industry.

Highly efficient, cheap and modern port competition is now being built, due
south of California.

Located on the Pacific coast of Mexico, Lazaro Cardenas is well positioned to
become a key competitor to west coast container ports. The facility is managed
by Hong Kong based Hutchison Port Holdings. Hutchison has strong ties to both
the shipping industry in general and Chinese exporters specifically. Both moral
suasion as well as preferred customer discounts can be applied, should
Hutchison choose to divert freight from Los Angeles to their facility.

TEU charges are estimated to be $235 US at Lazaro. This compares very
favourably to the $901 per TEU total charge levied at Long Beach.

The average longshoreman at Lazaro Cardenas earns less than 1/10th the total
pay and benefits package, as the typical California longshoreman.

In total, the total estimated costs to move freight from Lazaro to Chicago
appear to be exactly 50% of the current charges being levied just by the ports
in California. Fees assessed by BNI and UNP to transport containers to end
markets, widen the differential. In the world of logistics, shippers will move
business to generate a 1 or 2% net saving. A 50% net saving represents an
irresistible pull. (Source)

Lazaro's expanded operation will be highly automated. It will also be
considerably more efficient than any US West coast port. Dwell times are now
almost non existent at Cardenas, while ships may wait 3-6 days at Long Beach to
unload freight.

Over and above the compelling cost advantage, Cardenas also offers many
strategic advantages over Los Angeles. At 60 feet of depth, Lazaro Cardenas is
the deepest port on the Pacific Ocean. Being 7 feet deeper than the port of Los
Angeles, this Mexican port is better able to handle the newest generation of
container vessels. (Source)

Cardenas is ideally situated to capture Asian goods destined for the US Midwest
and south, such as Chicago, Kansas City and Houston.

The port is quite new, and just in the first stages of start-up. In 2005, the
port handled just 150,000 TEU. Current volumes are running at 220,000 TEU per
annum.

The first expansion will allow for a total of 2.2 million TEU per annum to be
processed. At full capacity over 4 million TEU annually may be handled. (Source

California risks becoming an "also ran" in international trade.

While confronted with incontrovertible and irrefutable logic supporting large
scale shipment diversions out of California, US detractors of Lazaro Cardenas
remain dismissive. They note that Lazaro Cardenas has been operating for a few
years now, and hasn't pulled much freight away. In reality, Lazaro was simply
constrained by size. The limitations will be removed in late 2010.

Status quo arguers further fail to acknowledge the economics of dropping
containers into California have deteriorated, on a more or less permanent
basis. West coast ports have been unable to wrestle down longshoreman costs,
which have now spiralled out of control. Refusing to acknowledge the economic
rationale for shippers changing ports won't stop it from happening.

And what makes things worse, is that a cash strapped government is no longer
working to preserve the strong monopoly position of Long Beach/Los Angeles. The
state has actually put into action, a series of taxes that will ensure an
increase in competition. Everyone with a vested interest in preserving the
ports appear to be working towards their demise.

Asian shippers are pragmatic. Rather than complain to deaf ears, they will
simply work to bypass California completely. When Lazaro Cardenas and Punta
Colonet (another proposed Mexican port) are fully operational, international
shipping companies will save billions of dollars annually.

Lazaro Cardenas will benefit, as will all of Mexico. So too, will Kansas City
Southern Railway.

I have gently probed industry sources for several months, and have determined
that the investment industry is completely apathetic to California's actions.

Not a single analyst has publicly questioned Kansas City Southern management
since August 2008, regarding the change in California port charges. Also, to my
knowledge, after having listened to the many conference calls held by BNI and
UNP since that time, it appears that not a single buy or sell side analyst has
queried the competition about the development.

I have also spent some time diligently assessing the average retail railroad
investor for their opinions, and found that they were:

a. Uniformly unaware of the tax changes.
b. Largely disinterested as to the long term ramifications.

Perhaps the largest potential driver of future revenue growth at KSU appears to
be virtually unknown, and largely scoffed at, by those who should be highly
attuned to the industry. As a long term investor, I couldn't be more excited by
the collective inattention.

If Kansas City Southern can increase its intermodal revenues from the Mexican
port, revenues and EBITDA could soar.

In 2008, a whopping $2.5 billion, or 14% of 2008 Burlington Northern's total
revenues, came from international container freight transport. When combined
with domestic container movements, BNI generated almost 34% of total revenues
from container and auto hauling in 2008.

In 2008, roughly $1.3 billion, or 7% of UNP's total revenues came from
international container freight transport. When combined with domestic
movements, Union Pacific generated 18% of revenues from container transport. A
further 8% of UNP revenues were earned through automotive transport.

In sharp contrast, Kansas City Southern generated just 9% of 2008 revenues from
container transport. Automotive transport accounted for just 6% of 2008
revenues. In 2008, container and auto intermodal revenues at KSU totalled
$266.2 million

Should my long term thesis prove to be correct, roughly $2.5 billion of BNI and
UNP's international container freight volumes could be displaced, in the next
decade. This is more than 25X KSU's current international container revenues.
Kansas City Southern may not get all of my forecast revenue displacement, but
they should certainly obtain some.

The woes of the auto industry also may have some unintended benefits for KSU.

In the near term, auto hauling is down sharply throughout North America. This
is due to declining sales. I consider this purely temporary. At some point,
sales should recover.

A long term windfall may accrue for railroads that specialize in moving
imports. An estimated 1900 auto dealer franchises will be cut loose by the big
3 domestic producers. GM, Ford and Chrysler "hope" these dealers will simply
close up shop. I consider this to be a naive assumption. If the domestic big 3
thought that cutting loose a highly sophisticated network of dealers was a good
thing, they will be sadly mistaken.

A likelier event; at least half or more of these dealers will simply switch
nameplates. Penske Auto Group for example, has purchased 350 dealers to
maintain the Saturn brand. Penske now wants to add a foreign product (products)
to build out the Saturn name. China has been looking for entry to the United
States with their many car brands.

In years to come, I predict that the big 3 will dearly regret the decision to
simply pull franchises, rather than buy them out and close them down. The most
logical outcome of the planned dealership reductions is that a host of
inexpensive foreign products will be unleashed on North American shores soon.
The Chinese needed a distribution network, and many are now available. North
American dealers are used to a great deal of service revenue, so they will have
no problem selling cars with perceived low initial vehicle quality.

Chinese autos will be low cost, so the shipping costs need to remain low. Los
Angeles and Long beach has priced themselves out of the Chinese market with
their recent moves. Mexico, with port charges just 26% that charged by the US
west coast, seems to be the only logical choice.

Anecdotal evidence of the foreign car growth potential is already in the
markets. KSU has just announced a new venture with Nissan. The goal is to beef
up the flow of imports to the US. (Source)

My belief is that we are now in the nascent stage of a new economic cycle.

Market opinions are divided, as they should be. When investors are uniformly
bullish or bearish, this is a sure sign of trouble. Currently, many consider
the stabilization of a deteriorating US economy to be just a double dip.
Alternatively, some consider the stimulus packages to be the priming of the
pump.

According to my data, the economic downturn was exacerbated by machinations of
financial service firms, and would have conceivably been quite an ordinary
recession at best...perhaps even a soft landing. Therefore, the upside in the
mid term could be pretty impressive, should consumers regain confidence.

I am not a market timer, and always run the risk of overpaying in the short
run.

In the earliest part of a new economic upswing, deeper cyclicals tend to
produce their absolute worst fiscal results. Accordingly, these companies often
look historically expensive, and therefore miss the numerous value screens now
in use by retail investors. The second quarter now ended could be the trough
for rails, which will make the entire industry look more expensive than at any
time in the last 5 years. However, when compared to the last economic bottom, I
consider this entry point to be cheap.

It is my intention is to increase Kansas City Southern to a core weight holding
in RMG#1

While the balance sheet of KSU is the most leveraged among class one railways,
liabilities have gone towards went towards building a better railroad, not
paying out legacy retiree benefits. The benefits of aggressive capital spending
will be enjoyed in the next up cycle. With one of the newest engine and rolling
stock fleets in the industry, and cost savings starting now on completed capex,
KSU would potentially generate more than $650 million of EBITDA in 2012. If the
markets eventually value KSU at a 10X EV/EBITDA multiple in that year,
shareholders could potentially double their money from here.

A three year potential double, based upon a cyclical recovery in North America
would be adequate compensation for my time. If the secular trend does start to
play out as planned, potential revenue and EBITDA growth could be far more
dramatic.

By 2015, KSU could certainly generate the $2.8 billion of revenues originally
forecast by management for the 2012 period. If, by 2015, EBITDA surpasses $1.17
billion, a 9X EV to EBITDA multiple could value the shares at $75.

RMG#1 is a predominantly large cap, globally themed portfolio seeking to
benefit from global secular trends. A very small initial position was started
in KSU a few months ago, while I began assessing the potential impact of the
Californian tax decisions. After considerable reflection, I will be comfortable
increasing the holding to a 3%-5% market weight position. I also own shares of
Kansas City Southern personally.

Re: Sundance Energy Australia Limited (SDCJF.PK)

Started a position in SDCJF to add to my basket of E&P companies. They have
some projects in the Niobara Shale area where both SSN & CHK have found Oil
recently..

From their Web site:
http://www.sundanceenergy.com.au/cutthroat.htm

This JV deal was announced 12/24/2010.

Sundance Energy Australia Limited Struck Agreement with Halliburton and
Macquarie Group Ltd. to Develop Niobara Project in the United States-12/24/2010

Sundance Energy Australia Limited has struck an agreement with Halliburton and
Macquarie Group Ltd. to hasten drilling work at its Niobara project in the
United States. Halliburton and Macquarie will participate in up to 40% of the
Sundance acreage at its Silo and Bull Canyon prospects in states of Wyoming and
Colorado. Sundance will receive a non-refundable participation payment of $2.4
million (AUD 2.39 million) in cash, under the deal. Halliburton and Macquarie
will also pay up to $3.9 million (AUD 3.89 million) in development costs for a
total consideration of about $2,500 per acre. The agreement requires the
participants to begin drilling a horizontal well within 90 days at Niobara
share prospect in Colorado. Halliburton and Macquarie will be able to earn up
to a combined 40% of Sundance's working interest in both prospects by drilling
a number of wells.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The company has no debt but at the expense of a lot of shares outstanding (238
million). They do own a lot of acreage in the U.S. that they have projects
ongoing. The company is cash flow positive too.

From their Web site::"...The Company currently owns in excess of 110,000 net
acres in some of the most prospective shale basins in the US, including the
Bakken fields of North Dakota and the DJ Basin in Colorado and Wyoming.
Sundance operates more than a half of its prospects; in the balance of its
plays, the Company is partnered with industry leading operators including Helis
Oil & Gas, Newfield Exploration, Continental Resources, American Oil & Gas, EOG
Resources and Hess Corporation....".

===================================================================

Not too sure how to prune my basket of E&P companies other than let them run
while oil continues to move higher. T. Boone Pickens has a $120/barrel price
target for 2011. Many of the E&P company reserve reports are to be released in
the next 90 days. Positive company specific reports could move the E&P laggards
much higher.

I have 13 companies in my basket now, 8 are profitable and 5 show no gain or
very modest losses. Of my gainers 2 are multi-baggers and 1 is a 50% gainer.
The overall basket is up 31% about the same for crude oil during the same time
period.

I have had a total of 25 Buys and 0 sells. 17 of my buys were in 2010 starting
in September 2010. My basket represents 6.25% of the portfolio. One of the
stocks Samson Oil & Gas Limited (SSN) is my biggest gainer so far. I have made
four purchases (10/27/2010, 12/20/2010, 12/22/2010 & 1/20/2011). This one alone
represents a 2.25% position in the portfolio.

I will probably do some major trimming/selling in the May/June time period.

Hopefully, the value in these companies will eventually be recognized. It helps
that at the same time crude oil is approaching its highs too.

Yes, I like that one, and I have mentioned it here before.

I'm buying or trying to buy or have bought all the Australian companies that I
have found that have e&p investments in USA or Canada as regards Bakken and/or
Niobrara shale.

As for SDCJF.pk (or SEA on the Australian exchange), I've focused on that one
and have been buying in small amounts. But in making purchase after purchase
after purchase after purchase, it's now among my top holdings.

As I said in an earlier post about these stocks, I believe there are some shale
oil stocks that if bought now and held (not that I can hold on), will enable
some young guy (not me) with courage (not really me again) to get rich.
SDCJF.pk could be one such stock. It's too bad it hasn't been
mentioned/discussed on SI by those who claim some expertise in the oil bidness
or in following oil stocks or in reporting on oil stocks or the oil business.
However, that lack of discussion gives the opportunity to buy in advance of the
herd. (Of course publicity/popularity doesn't mean the company will necessarily
turn out to be a winning investment.)

Repeating my opinion, we have the Eagle Ford Texas play that's now well known.
For 2011 we have the Bakken (USA/Saskatchewan Bakken) where there's a lot of
acreage being acquired, drilling go on, media reporting. That attention will
shift to Niobrara in 2011/2012. Then that will then be followed by the Alberta
Bakken and the Alberta Cardium. (Somewhere in there will be the North Sea, and
maybe companies involved with horizontal drilling in Europe. Africa too
somewhere.) All just my opinion.

Whether any of the companies here are value stocks or just speculations, I
leave it to each individual to determine. Again, I use p/e for megacaps, but a
variety of other methods for the small e&p companies that show no earnings now
or in the foreseeable future (e.g. I'm using comparable acreage prices, flowing
barrels of production, nav.). Also, it should be said, I'm sometimes just going
on history of management or company p.r./presentations (risky with some of
these Canadian .v companies).

Anyway, fwiw, in past couple of days I added to positions in REXX, MMR, ESTE,
OAS, SDCJF (SDCJF with money from sale of some SSN), CSCTF.pk, GSFVF (perhaps
the Bakken equivalent to "pick&shovel supplier to miners"), BEXP, HES(some are
not value buys at current high price!), SYRG, TPLM, SROE, PXL.v (these last two
still very undervalued imo)and TOL.v. (TOL's one of my picks for the Alberta
Cardium. Also has land in Bakken. I like it for 2012-2013). Whew! Lol -- can
you guys keep up? Uh, would you even want to? Because actually, if I'm not real
careful (and I'm generally old and slow and not careful), it's very possible I
could get my head handed to me by coming into some of these stocks now when
prices are already so high. We shall see.

If you consider this value investing you should look into CCME.
It looks great on paper but is there value behind the paper???
Just got the next report from Muddy waters...

Georgi

March 2, 2011

CCME: Irrefutable Evidence of Fraud

Muddy Waters, LLC has amassed irrefutable evidence that China MediaExpress
Holdings, Inc. (“CCME”) is a substantial fraud, and that management is engaging
in a cover-up replete with further dissemination of fraudulent information. In
light of the nature of the evidence, we believe that a de-listing from NASDAQ
is not improbable; further, we believe that management stands to lose
additional credibility. We therefore reduce our estimated value by one-third to
$3.54.

We present a recorded telephone conversation that contains an admission that
CCME is engaging in securities fraud. The conversation took place on February
23rd between the CCME salesperson who provided us with the advertiser kit we
cited in our February 3, 2011 report (the “Report”) and one of our analysts.
The CCME salesperson initiated the conversation without notice in response to
investigative actions taken by CCME’s auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
(“Deloitte”). During the conversation, the salesperson stated that:

* CCME has been doubling the number of buses on which it has installed
equipment for purposes of its SEC filings; and
* CCME replaced recently replaced the salesperson’s hard drive due to the
increased scrutiny.

The recording with subtitles is available at:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLAm-dJh2fI

We document that in the course of rebutting our Report, Chairman Cheng provided
fabricated information. In Chairman Cheng’s February 7, 2011 letter (the
“Chairman’s Letter”), Chairman Cheng challenged our assertion that CCME’s
largest purported contract does not exist. His proof includes an “excerpt” of
buses he claims are covered by the disputed contract. The excerpt contains
license plate numbers of three buses. We have official documentation (shown in
Appendix A) from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Traffic Management
Administrator (the “Traffic Administrator”) that shows these three license
plates numbers are fabricated.

We present the sales presentation we received in January from the
aforementioned salesperson (the “Sales Presentation”) that shows CCME has fewer
than half of the buses it claims. The Sales Presentation (Appendix B), which
shows CCME’s buses by province and city, corroborates the following facts we
presented in our earlier Report:

* CCME has fewer than half of the buses it claims; and
* Its largest purported contract (with Shanghai Ba Shi for 1,892 buses) does
not exist. The number of buses for Shanghai-based operators in the presentation
matches the number in the spreadsheet we received – 296.

We present a mini-documentary of the largest purported operator – Shanghai Ba
Shi – specifically focusing on its inter-city buses and drivers. The film shows
that CCME’s hardware is not installed on the buses, despite CCME’s claim to
have had hardware on these buses since at least mid-2008.

Hi Madharry -

I like the investment theme <u>"Industrial Infrastructure Expansion in
China"</u> but am not sure what the best approach is for investing in this
sector. It was reported yesterday that China holds 1.6 trillion dollars of US
debt up 56% from the prior year. China will spend this debt to build out their
infrastructure and most likely will contract U.S. companies and their Chinese
partners for products and services.

I am still very skeptical of all Chinese accounting but feel more confident
with a U.S. company that deals with Chinese JV partners. EI DuPont de Nemours &
Co. (DD) was one of my earlier "value" picks based on their solar panel R&D
facility investment in China.

first LCD glass melting facility and expand its light-duty substrate
manufacturing operation.

U.S. companies that have Chinese partners that can manufacture and distribute

Have you identified any of your Chinese companies that have U.S. partnerships

What I mean is that all Chinese reverse mergers look too similar, too good to

They can increase their earnings as much as they want. This is why IMO this is
more a speculation than an investment. I followed you in CCCL and sold it very

Web Site: http://www.armaninofoods.com/Index.aspx

I added another 20% to my previous position. This one has been slow and steady
with an annual dividend yield now around 5% and a 28% increase in the stock
price since my first buy in 10/2010. I really like the value that management
continues to build in this company. Management has made 43 consecutive
quarterly dividend payments in addition to nine special dividends over the same
time period.

They had over $500K in bank CD's at year end 2009 ready to deploy for new
product opportunities. I now noticed that as of September 30, 2010, this amount
has grown to over $860K (up 72% from the 2009 figure). The company has no debt,
has increased sales every QTR and most recently landed some really new exciting
distribution contracts in 2011. The company continues to buy back it's shares
from time to time in the open market.

Their 2010 results were quite impressive. The company got more efficient with
their YoY and Qtr to Qtr - Net Income growth nearing 50%!

Q4 2010 vs Q4 2009:..Net Sales Up 3.5%..Net Income Up 49%
2010 vs 2009:..............Net Sales Up 9%.....Net Income Up 47%

Here is their full report that was released February 18, 2011.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Armanino-Foods-of-Distinction-bw-3287515153.html?
=0&.v=1

I visited their leased company manufacturing facility (just up the road 34
miles) and it's the real thing (Google Maps:
http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&tab=wl ). They produce a quality product w/
the best ingredients that is fresh frozen. They have recently expended their
distribution points Coast to Coast (w/Dot Foods a food re distributor
http://www.dotfoods.com/ ) from their company facility located in Hayward
California.

This small company (now w/ a Market Cap of $30 million) with $23 million in
2010 sales reminds me of a Warren Buffet company. They just keep plugging
along, growing their revenues all accomplished from internal earnings (ie no
debt).

It may be selling at the high end of it's recent price range ($0.86/share) at
13x 2010 earnings however, I expect them to grow their earnings again by
35%-45% in 2011. That would make their Forward PE right around 9.5 at today's
closing price.

At some point, (as you pointed out) they may even be a candidate for a buy out
by a larger food integrator.

Thanks for the heads up back in September 2010. This is a micro-cap I don't
mind holding. You get growth at a very reasonable "value" price.

thanks EKS...

I still hold a core position and figured that the company was fully valued at
around 85 cents but your forward looking calcs have me considering to add on
any dips.

If you recall:
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26856272&srchtxt=hska

I also mentioned OPCO and HSKA. OPCO has done very little but HSKA which was
trading at around 45 cents at the time I mentioned it has since done a 1/10
reverse split in order to maintain their Nasdaq status. It has moved up from
$4.50 to todays close of $6.47 and will be releasing earnings soon. I
anticipate that earnings will be descent but am reluctant to hold my full
position so I trimmed off ~30% today.

I have two very speculative penny oil plays that I believe will go higher:
HIKO.pk and BYCX.ob . as of today sold most of my TGC (previous spec play
mentioned here ~50 cents (got my cheapest at 40 cents)

Srivats: Here's a 2006 interview with Mr Whitney Tilson, who claims to be some
sort of value investor. There's a section in the interview devoted to his leap
purchases.

http://mikesnewsletterinvesting.blogspot.com/2006/03/interview-with-whitney-til
on.html

"We tend to buy LEAPS on very stable businesses where we think the underlying
intrinsic value is growing around 10% annually, the multiple on the stock is
likely to expand rather than contract and the options are cheap. Options on
low-volatility stocks like WMT, MCD, BRK, MSFT and BUD are cheap and we own
LEAPS on all of them."

I'm not a fan of this guy at all. And his process of trying to scootch up gains
by buying leaps on stable companies seems wrong. As a couple of comments from
his stockholders indicate.

------------
If you are buying stocks with the Buffett view of being part owner of the
business, and you believe that "might be the best thing in value investing",
then why would you suboptimize by buying one-year leaps? Are you some sort of
student or something with a very small bankroll, or somebody who's got stocks
but has run out of money to invest? My opinion is that although leaps are
popular and many people have made money with them, it's like beating up on your
money -- trying to make say $4K do the job that $20K needs to do. I don't work
my money that way. Jmo, of course. Others will differ.

Paul,

Thanks for your reply. You are right. I am a tech grad. I have done day trading
with reasonable success. But I am more interested to learn to invest instead of
speculate. I was reading through the Intelligent investor, when this idea crept
my mind. However, I am very much a novice and hope I would mature in course of

Hi 7Years -

It looks like many of the small E&P companies are moving again today with crude
oil very close to multi year highs ($102/barrel). One of the things I will be
looking at in my basket is how have my companies hedged their production out
for 2011 and 2012.

For the companies that I want to hold long term and have pretty much fixed
production costs, I would like to see appropriate hedges that at least cover
their production costs. This would apply to the larger producers with many
wells under production.

For example <u>RAM Energy Resources, Inc. (NasdaqGM: RAME )</u>
(posted on Yahoo)
"...RAME has collars on about 1/3rd of their oil for 2nd/3rd & 4th Q of 2011.
1/5th in Q1/2 of 2012 as of today. The price is $80-$105. If the price goes up
above 105 they only get to sell it for 105 but it's only 1/3rd of their
oil..the other 2/3rds goes to spot price. RAME placed the $80 floor because
this guarantees profitability taking away some risk. This is a very common
hedge practice with oil & gas...."
------------------------------------------------------------------

I have also noticed that many of the micr-cap and smaller E&P companies do not
even bother to hedge. Their production(s) are small and/or still in-the-ground
and it's more a function of drilling their well(s) and raising the necessary
capital to complete their projects.

Hedging their production is not bad and can be very good especially when
historical prices are near lows and/or below their cost of production (ie NG is
an example). That's why E&P companies with "oily" assets will probably run
higher as crude moves higher and can be amplified based on how much of their
production is hedged.

Because RAME has so many wells producing Oil (interests in over 4,000 well w/
33.9 million barrels of oil equivalent) and they have hedged 1/3 of their
production (which covers their costs) 2/3 of their production may fluctuate
with the market crude oil prices (both up and down).

More food for thought when looking at how Mr. Market values these companies as
crude moves higher. Remember that when crude falls in price, you should get the
same relatives stock price moves downward.

The stock screener is nice since you can start based on "ANY" value criteria
and then based on results, you can expand your criteria.

At different points in the economic cycle, it is advantageous to use different
types of screening criteria. If it is company's debt, free flow cash or BV all
are good starting points.

Recently I have been using Buffets LT debt criteria which is:
"LT Debt should be 4X (or less) than a company's Annual Net Income". This is
hard to screen exactly but you can narrow in on such companies with the
software.

For the beginner use PE less than 10 and BV less than 1.5.

Have fun.

>>This is what the poi of Madharry, that we should not tar all the companies.
But it is very difficult select the good from the bad.<<

The problem is that they all have the same structure - reverse merger, no
assets in the US, holding companies with no assets in tax havens, obscure
auditors that may not even audit the operating subsidy itself.

It is a setup that makes it very easy to commit fraud and makes it very hard to
hold the culprits responsible. this does not mean that every companies intends
to commit fraud but you have to wonder why they choose such a setup if they do
not intend to take advantage of it <ng>.

Also, be careful about companies that say one thing and do another. GFRE - they
said they buy back stock (back in 9/2010) but i see no evidence they did. They
said they would have their procedures audited back in 9/2010 but i see no
evidence that this actually happens (mind you auditing procedures is a whole
lot easier than auditing a balance sheet).

Investing in the industrial revolution in China makes a lot of sense, it just
think that these reverse merger companies are a flawed way to do so. I believe
we should be looking into buying stocks in Hongkong (a fairly transparent
market, imo) rather than the population of reverse mergers that came to the
world with inherent birth defects.

GLNYF. I'm passing on that one.

1. Too gassy, not enough oily

2. I disagree it's cheap on a flowing barrel multiple. It may (or may not) be
cheap on a flowing barrel "equivalent" multiple. Which would mean based on its
gas production, because the company is primarily a gas producer. "Equivalence"
is the issue. Because it's very very likely the company means energy
equivalence, and not price equivalence. When based on 6:1 oil:gas energy
equivalence, this values the gas much higher than if the equivalence were based
on the current price difference between high oil price and low gas price. So
when I looked at the oil numbers, I didn't see flowing barrels to enterprise
value as being a bargain for this company. Jmo. I could be wrong.

This stock was mentioned by kingfisher on the Big Dog thread. Previous to this,
he's mentioned a few others, and each has turned out to be very very good for
people who bought in. Perhaps he'll be right again with Galleon, his latest
pick.

Another one mentioned in the Energy Report 2/17/2011 that has popped over 10%
today. The author suggests that TPLM can become a teenager and still be fairly
valued.

Re: Triangle Petroleum Corporation (TPLM)

Jeffrey Hayden and Chad Mabry: Stay Very Oily

Source: George Mack of The Energy Report 02/15/2011

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27176956&srchtxt=rame

From the article:"...TER: Ok, another one that you like?

JH: Another one we like here is <u> Triangle Petroleum Corporation (TSX.V:TPO;
NYSE.A:TPLM)</u>. Again, we're sticking with the oily theme because we like oil
better than gas. One of the things we really like about Triangle is that,
relative to its market cap, it is one of the most leveraged companies to the
Bakken. Right now, Triangle has about 15,000 net acres and is looking to push
that to 25,000–30,000 net acres by the end of the year. If it's able to do
that, I think there could be significant upside from current levels. <u>You've
got a stock here that is currently around $7; if it can tack on another
10,000–15,000 acres at attractive prices, I think this stock could get into the
teens.</u>

TER: The first thing I noticed about Triangle was its low market cap of $187
million. You could move that stock with some demand for the shares. The $30
million allocated for the development of the Bakken acreage this year sounds
like a large investment. Does that have to pay off for the company?

JH: Well, its announced capex budget is actually about $72 million, and $30
million of that is just for acquiring additional leasehold. That's how it's
going to grow to that 25,000–30,000 net acres. The company has another $42
million for drilling capex. This is a sizeable capital allocation for the
company's size, which is why TPLM went out and made sure it had the financing
in place in order to fund this program. As for whether it has to pay off, the
simple answer is, yes—if it wants more funding. But with the predictability of
the Bakken play, we think that's the likely scenario...."

GLNYF - the company transitions from NG to Oil, 70% of the Capex goes towards
the oily stuff now. Current production is 30%oil/70% NG, so you are correct
that it's gassy right now. I think the 770k acres in undeveloped land are worth
something too. in any case, 4X EV/cash flow is cheap even for pure NG producer.
