Hello gcrispin,

Any thoughts on the balance sheet of ES? I like the earnings outlook and
valuation there, but I'm seeing relatively low cash, and lots of
goodwill/intangibles as assets. Maybe that's just how these business work

Teekay Offshore Partners LP (TOO): "announces pricing of 4.4 mln common unit
follow-on offering at $19.48 per unit (TOO)

As seems to be typical of such offerings, the announcement has dropped the
stock closer to the offering price. I'll take the stock price now as an
opportunity to add to my position. (Added a bit now.)

http://www.teekayoffshore.com/documents_root/InvestorRelations/TOO_Fact_Sheet_M

Distribution (annualized) $1.80/$19.49 = 9.2%. Good, but the yield has been
higher (with lower stock price in previous months). Very good now if
distribution can be maintained (and if stock holds up). Excellent if
distribution amounts continue to increase (and if stock holds up).

Last year around this time, I sold FUQI because of my concerns re. internal
control.. And of course, it went on to triple and secondary issues etc.. so I
thought may be they have tighten up the controls because management had
mentioned it a few times..

So took a small position around 18 and of course now this.. It looks like the
restatement and reduced forecasts are not as bad as how the shares have
reacted..

But lost of confidence and the lawsuit already filed are going to be the dark

NWPX - dull business with innovative accounting. i think the one yahoo poster
got it right when stating that the depreciation seems too low. NWPX has 180M$
in property and equipment and only 5M$/year in depreciation. Doesn't sound
right with me that they assume their machinery last for 36 years (assuming
linear depreciation). if that's the deal then we have to subtract 10M$ in
depreciation (pick you own number 10M$/year is just a guess) from pretax
earnings and you have a more realistic earnings number.Of course it is quite
likely that the fudging didn't stop with depreciation.

Anyways that is one of the reasons why I look at EBITDA/EV ratios when
evaluation companies - those numbers are more difficult to fudge then earnings.
NWPX runs at 6.2X EBITDA/EV which is not cheap for a capital intense business.
I'll pass until this get's cheaper or the accounting cleared up.

FUQI is just another one of these little Chinese critters that has an opaque

shareholders to enforce accountability. The US company is just a shell with no

POWL -
One of Royce Funds' recent purchases was an increase to its position in Powell
Industries (POWL), a company that will eventually be major beneficiary of this
spending. The company makes and services equipment for the management of
electricity. The customer base includes oil and gas companies, refiners and
electric utilities.

Powell has more than held its own during the current recession. It has grown by
acquisition in recent years, and fiscal 2009 revenue was actually up, reaching
a record $665.9 million, up from $638.7 million in 2008. Earnings welled to
$39.7 million compared with $25.8 million. It may see a little slowing in the
growth rate as orders and backlog have slowed a bit, but over the long term,
management has shown an ability to grow the company at a respectable rate. The
balance sheet is strong with $97 million in cash and just a little over $9
million in debt.

On a side note, when I called him up last year, the CEO was very confident

To me the best evidence of confidence are open market purchases. There are very

I know that catastrophes can and sometimes do, bring insurers down. With Chile,
it seems - as far as we know - that the VR losses are going to be manageable.

Insurance accounting is so arcane. Some losses are always allowed for by the
reinsurers. How, and how much and where, I'm not so sure. It's possible a lot
of the monies are in an off-balance sheet item. This may be so for assumptive
reinsurance (all items removed from asset and liability on the corporate
balance sheet). From Wikipedia, "Assumption reinsurance is a form of
reinsurance whereby the reinsurer is substituted for the ceding insurer and
becomes directly liable for policy claims. This ordinarily requires a notice
and release from affected policyholders. In the more typical reinsurance
arrangement, the reinsurer has an obligation to indemnify the ceding insurer,
which remains liable for claims on policies it has issued, and policyholders'
approval is not required."

I'm going to assume it's not critical for me to understand all this accounting
jargon. Of course, maybe if I had such knowledge in some previous bets on
insurers, I might have saved myself from some losses. I'll just stick with
p/bk, dividend, history, margins, etc., and also not making just one big bet on
one insurer (reinsurer).

Either the mine is geologically challenged or they are simply not good

Re: TGB - 

Yes, I don't pretend to think they are great operators. This quarter, the issue
was geotechnical. I think the costs in general have been lower than that, but
still as you mention, my view is that earnings haven't been very good, and it's
probably either an operational or geological issue. Or a combination of both.

That being said, the $180 million deal I mentioned was announced a few months
ago. The money isn't in the bank yet, but I imagine it's close.

The new mine in the approval process (Prosperity) is a gold and copper mine and
would have a different geological setup. Now, operationally, any issues at
Gibraltar could happen also at Prosperity. Remains to be seen.

That being said, I feel like there's a significant push for raw
materials/resources around the world, and based on the deal interest that seems
to be out there, I think the companies willing to make these deals are willing
to look past some of the issues TGB has had in the past. I guess that's my play
here and I hope it works out.

some backlog because it's a long lead time business - their substantial

Their backlogs are still falling from 366M$ in 9/12/09 to 342M$ in 12/31/09. I

The underwriters were Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, so if you
have a decent net worth at one of these brokers you could have bought some
stock in the offering as an individual.

If the deal is a solid deal, it will trade above the offering price. Usually
this means a bunch of top-notch institutions bought shares.

If the deal is a sloppy deal, you can usually buy at or below the offering
price.

I'd guess 60% of the deals are solid??? High quality names usually do better.
MLPs are typically sloppy, so you usually get a cheaper price in the market
after the deal is priced. BDCs have mostly been sloppy recently as well.

You're right about the balance sheet. Long term debt, however, has been
decreasing rather substantially since 2006. The high goodwill is a result of
the number of acquisitions the company has made. I don't think it's how these
businesses work but more how this company was built. ECOL has a pristine
balance sheet and is roughly in the same business. ECOL does sell at a higher
valuation, even though earnings will be down this year. So perhaps ES is being
penalized for its balance sheet.

A breakdown of the intangibles can be found on F-20 of the 10K. The permits, at
least, look like a reasonable intangible with a useful life going forward. The
others are anybody's guess who is not intimately involved in this business.

The key, for my investment perspective, is cash flow. The LLRW facility has
high margins and can generate a great deal of cash. Below is a summary by
Morningstar regarding the company's finances.

EnergySolutions' net debt/capital ratio stood at approximately 34% at the end
of 2009. The firm covered its interest expenses with operating income more than
3 times in 2009. The firm usually generates significant amounts of operating
cash flow, and its capital expenditure needs are relatively low. We believe
this puts the firm in fair financial health.

You can buy TIP, but it only protects from (official measure of) inflation. It
does not protect you from rising interest rates.

If you are assuming that "inflation" equals "increasing interest rates", that
is not necessarily true.

To protect from rising interest rates (but not necessarily inflation), you
would have to buy inverse of treasury yield (or short treasuries, which you
can't do in IRA?). I don't think there is a cheap and good way to do this, but

First, let's distinguish definitions. TIPs are inflation indexed bonds with
various maturities. TIP is an ETF that holds such bonds and can be bought as
any other ETF through your broker. When I say TIPs, I mean bonds. When I say
TIP, I mean ETF. :)

As I said, TIP and TIPs resolve one issue: it protects from inflation.
Actually, they resolve only HALF an issue, since it uses government definition
of inflation to adjust for it, so it really protects for a part of inflation
only.

Now, the drawbacks. TIP and TIPs have lower interest rates before inflation
compared to treasuries, so unless there is a marked inflation, you lose. You
have to be sure there will be inflation, which I wouldn't swear on. And again
oil price increase is only partially reflected in inflation gauge, so oil going
to $80-90-100 does not TIP/TIPs return make.

TIP as a fund does not protect from interest rate increases that are not
related to inflation. If Fed decides to raise rates because they don't want to
stimulate economy anymore, TIP will drop as its yield spread to new rates will
be wider. On the positive side TIP holds TIPs of various maturities, so the
effect won't be as bad as if you bought a single TIPs bond with a single
maturity. Morningstar gives TIP portfolio average maturity at 4.76 years
http://quicktake.morningstar.com/FundNet/Portfolio.aspx?symbol=TIP&country=USA
, which is not bad in terms of interest-rate risk. (In very simple terms,
anything over 10-15 years is bad, anything below 5 years is not that bad).

Finally, personally I'd prefer an income fund that would gain if US$ dropped.
This is not directly related to TIP/TIPs. There is WIP
http://quicktake.morningstar.com/FundNet/Portfolio.aspx?symbol=WIP&country=USA
, but I don't like it either, since IMHO it has even worse interest rate risk
than TIP.

the usage is back to normal. You should compare it to last March usage to get a

http://www.reuters.com/article/idAFSGE62L0G420100322?rpc=44

From the article:"...Shares of CNX Gas surged as much as 24 percent to a new
year-high of $38.18 Monday morning, making them one of the top percentage
gainers on the New York Stock Exchange...."

=====================================================================

I will accumulate more shares of CNX around $40/share as this price target
accounts for the dilution and new debt. It could go lower. Long term it seems
like a good way to position the company and complements my other oil and
natural resource companies. CNX traded as low as $43/share on the news today on
twice the average volume. So it appears that investors are selling into the
news and more than likely will continue the sell off as the new shares hit the
market.

CNX Gas (CXG) up 23% +$7.06/share to $37.95/share

have been in nat gas and smaller energy names. It seems like there can be so
many things that can go wrong with them its not far removed from biotech. and i

He he so, you were out and your son was at home. Why don't you ask him what
could have consumed energy while you were out? The PS3 alone can't make that
much of a dent but if you leave the TV on with a receiver and maybe a subwoofer

while you are at it crank up the heater, leave the windows and the fridge door

OSX Plunges as Eike Batista Calls Market ‘Difficult’ (Update4)
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601110&sid=aB5SZKGqBDnc

From the article:"...OSX Brasil SA, billionaire Eike Batista’s oil-services and
shipbuilding company, plunged 13 percent in its first day of trading after
slashing the size of its initial public offering to lure investors...."

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The IPO went flat selling shares at 800 reais each and only raised about U.S.
$1.5 Billion. OSX originally planned to raise as much as 9.9 billion reais
($5.5 billion) by selling as many as 7.4 million shares for 1,000 reais to
1,333.33 reais.

Not sure if this is a statement from the market about OSX or investing in
Brazil in general.

You don't have to quote the whole article but perhaps these issues would
explain cold reception for the IPO: "Rio de Janeiro-based OSX has never
reported a profit and its main assets are 3.2 million square meters of
oceanfront property in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina and the guarantee
of orders from Batista’s oil company, OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA.

....snip...questions by journalists about the skepticism of investing in his

Paul Senior. fyi, current S&P Fair Value for EXC is 45.00 and for PNY is 26.00.
I've become a fan of the 'proprietary' S&P Fair Value estimate as of late.
Combined w/ good fundamental ratios and some DD, it seems to be a valuable
screening tool. Do you like institutional 'fair value' estimates? Have you had
any success with them in the past?

From:Paul Senior
Dr. Ipsofacto, I don't use S&P fair value numbers. When I did look at them
years back, they didn't seem to help me, so I have ignored them. They may be
helpful and good, I just don't know.

I don't like financial companies' proprietary methods for fair value. First,
I'm not a fan of discounted cash flow, and sometimes the analysts incorporate
that in the valuation. Sometimes, some analysts use relative value -- for
example what the company sells for in its sector, compared to all/some other
similar companies. More significantly to me though, these fair value
calculations seem to be based on a time-frame -- what the company is worth now
or if your time-frame would be a twelve month holding or if holding until
company's end-of-year, or calendar year, or something.

After your post that S&P's Fair Value for EXC is $45/sh., I went to the EXC S&P
tear sheet, and it shows a target 12-mo price of $54/sh. I didn't see a target
at their PNY page. I scanned to see what exactly comprises the Fair Value
number, but I didn't find it. (Running out of time here today.)

I've got no argument that utilities in general might be fairly-valued at
current price. They mostly (but not EXC) have moved up quite a bit from their
12-mo lows, and the p/e's don't look cheap, nor their dividend yields
exceptional.

I'm using utility stocks for a defensive play, trying to keep some volatility
down in my portfolio. While I say I'm intending to keep these stocks for a
minimum holding of 3-5 years, if I can get more comfortable increasing my
exposure more strongly to value stocks or stocks with better prospects, and if
I run out of cash, I may reduce my positions in the utility sector. Especially,
as I say, so many are up from lows already.

For now, for me, EXC seems more attractive than PNY. S&P has EXC as 4-star, PNY
as 3-star rated.

Aside: I do look at S&P four star stocks. Sometimes they are at attractive
prices. Not saying that EXC is better because it's 4-star, just that it's a
confirming sign for me.

Re: Siemens AG American Depositary (NYSE: SI) - div yield 1.6%
Empire District Electric Co. (EDE) - div yield 7.0%
Atmos Energy Corporation (ATO) - div yield 4.7%

Peeled off shares of SI ( now down to 50% of my original buy 8/2009) and added
to my ATO and EDE positions. I upped my EDE position by 50% and have built my
position to 1.5% of the taxable portfolio.

I am taking partial profits in my low dividend payers and adding to my higher
dividend payers. I am looking at the total return of the investment so once I
lock in a dividend yield of 5% or more, I only need a 5% increase in the price
to generate a net 10% return. The dividend gets you half way there w/ no
growth.

I am also tempted to reduce my exposure to the international infrastructure
builders as the bulk of the stimulus money is already committed. Unless we
enter a double dip recession, new stimulus money or money net yet spent will
probably be reallocated and used to reduce debt. SI has more exposure to the
falling EURO but FLR, SHAW and CBI all have exposure to a weak EURO.

Hi walterenergy -

The problem for me w/ Patriot Coal Corporation (PCX) is that they are a coal
only producer. I wanted the NG diversification you get w/ CNX. According to
Yahoo, CNX has a lower forward PE below 10 and does pay a very modest dividend.

Patriot Coal Corporation (PCX) does seem to be selling at a better Price to
Book level at 2x book compared to CNX with a 4x BV.

My goal is to have more exposure to coal specifically metallurgical (thermal)
coal. My largest position in the portfolio is BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) which
provides me some exposure to coal but I thought that CNX could be a good
addition if one could buy it on the cheap.

I wonder since PCX is located in (or near) the Illinois basin where there are
substantial deposits of shale NG reserves (see #24 on chart
http://www.energyindustryphotos.com/shale_gas_map_shale_basins.htm ), if they
own any mineral rights to these NG reserves.

If so, it might be a hidden asset in their balance sheet that someday they
could sell or develop w/ a JV partner.

Do you know if PCX owns any mineral rights to potential shale NG reserves for
property they own in the Illinois Basin region? I suspect that if they do, they
have already sold the NG rights to free up capital.

Hi EKS,

If I wanted NG diversification, I would buy a NG firm.
I was just responding to your reasoning for being interested in CNX for the
coal and met coal.
I don't know the answer to your question regarding PCX owning mineral rights to
potential shale NG reserves. I looked through their 10K and saw no mention of
NG reserves.

Although they have huge reserves of coal and met coal, I believe PCX to be
mismanaged, and frankly have done so much better with my namesake, WLT.
However, right now, WLT is much more richly valued (and deservedly so) than
PCX.

Interesting article from the WSJ about your TAXI.

from today's wall street journal-on taxi:

By DAVID BENOIT

Discovering a new commodity typically makes headlines, but Medallion Financial
Corp. believes it has quietly managed a precious metal for more than 70 years:
the New York City taxi medallion.

Controlling about a quarter of the medallions winding through city traffic,
Medallion grew from a family-run operation into a multimillion-dollar niche
lender, thanks to the small metal shield attached to the hood of every cab.

By law, there are only 13,257 city medallions, licenses issued by the New York
City Taxi and Limousine Commission to operate those seemingly ubiquitous yellow
cabs. That limit makes the medallions' value rise like that of a commodity,
sending their price soaring from $10 in 1937 to a recent $800,000. Medallion
taxis are the only vehicles in the city allowed to pick up passengers who hail
them from the street.

But even if some are accused of fleecing passengers, like a recent scandal
involving thousands of drivers allegedly overcharging $8.3 million, it is hard
to imagine most cabbies handling an $800,000 mortgage. That's where Medallion
comes in.

Leon Murstein started the New York City-based group in 1937 and it is now run
by his son Alvin and grandson Andrew. After going public in 1996, today's
market capitalization is $141.7 million with the stock in neutral recently,
idling around $8 since July.

Andrew Murstein, the president, said Medallion has lent more than $3 billion in
New York and other cities. It has never lost a cent on a medallion because, he
said, it is easy to repossess while still turning a profit.

"We'll send someone to your house at about 3 a.m., when the car is most likely
to be parked in front of the house," Mr. Murstein said. "He'll pop the
medallion off the hood of the car and bring it back to our offices, and the
next day when you wake up you'll be out of work."

Lenders see how easily Medallion recovers loans, and agree to fund it cheaply.
In December 2008, as the financial world imploded, Medallion got $200 million
in new credit, with interest under 2%. Short-term borrowing rates are as low as
0.65%, while Medallion lends to drivers above 6%. Plus, most drivers don't
drive the life of the loan, adding early-cancellation fees to the profits.

"You come here, drive a cab for a few years, save everything and then plunk
down your whole life savings to buy a medallion and then you own the American
dream," Mr. Murstein said. "But in a few years, you sell it and move on."

Medallion then helps the driver sell to another driver.

Still, for an investor, there are potholes. Recently, Medallion posted a
fourth-quarter loss on an investment charge, although, excluding items, it
earned 20 cents a share. But it also cut its dividend to 15 cents from 19 cents
after not earning the rate for several quarters.

Justin Akin of fund manager River Road, Medallion's largest outside
shareholder, said the cut was prudent. He couldn't say whether River Road plans
to boost its $15.1 million stake, but he said he believes Medallion is strong
and the new dividend is achievable.

Medallion's only public analyst rates the stock as neutral.

The company is searching for new business, such as loans to prospective owners
of recreational vehicles and boats and small businesses. Mario Cuomo, a board
member and the former New York governor, wants to attract investors by
expanding Medallion's reach.

"I don't want to die without having used this discovery we made," Mr. Cuomo
said. "We found this magic commodity that gets heavier and stronger without
getting fed."

Thanks for the TAXI article.

The golden goose medallions are there because of NYC laws. If laws change, the
good times can disappear.

Two things seem to have happened. One, the spread of money (cost for TAXI to
borrow vs. what they can loan money out for) has been high, and TAXI is a very
niche business. So management has concluded, how can we expand either the taxi
business to other cities or something else where we can invest this cheap money
at high rates? Well, they tried a sports franchise SPAC, and that didn't work.
Ultimately, they had to cut the dividend. These guys just couldn't sit still
and stick to their wonderful little niche business.

Anyway, I don't trust management's
business acumen now. So I've greatly reduced my position. Still worth looking
at and holding for the dividend. Which I assume will not be cut again. And the
assumption that management won't blow the business with another failed
diversification attempt.

Hi Paul -

Peeled off some shares in BHP and added shares of CNX. This allocation brings
my No. 1 position BHP down to 6.3% of the portfolio. I like to build a new
position to no more than 1.5%- 2% of the portfolio and let them grow to a 5%
position at which time I will try to peel off shares. My trade into CNX today
now completes a full position. Hope it grows to over a 5% position in the
coming years.

I will hold longer if they are good dividend payers and/or the companies own a
lot of valuable tangible assets (real estate, natural resources etc.). The
bonus of course is if they have hidden assets that will be discovered by the
market or exploited by management to increases shareholder's value.

BHP has been one of my stellar performers over the twenty years I have owned
it. It has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 1200% and has even
outperformed XOM by over 600%.

If one goes back 6 months on performance or exactly 26 weeks , the stats show
that 57.8% of all stocks rose in a range of anywhere from 4 to 785%.

So your numbers on performance indicate you were in the right stocks broadly
representative of the 57% stocks that have run.

I'll take a look at SNY. Just a glance at the balance sheet shows me that their
book value is comprised in total of about 33 billion of intangible assets and
good will, but for big pharma, its probably par for the course.
