As long as SVU EV\EBITDA stays in the mid single digits (current year and
future years still look like <5 to me) I think it is way too soon to write
their obituary. But I agree that if the business were to crash and burn, even
recent purchasers of the stock would suffer.

Of course I am on the record as liking radio stocks 3 months ago (ETM, CMLS)
but since these have appreciated greatly over the last few months I think
currently SVU looks like a much better investment than ETM, CMLS. And there are
greater concerns about the radio business being in longer term decline than
there is that grocery business is in decline.

re SVU - I thin k I'll be a buyer too but I want to point out the risk. The
radio stocks have done well but I think they are trading sardines. Maybe SVU is
a trading sardine too, but if so, it's probably a good idea to wait and see if
it's breaks it's LT low at 8.7$. if that happens, all the hell may break loose.
if the selloff is done at least a good dead cat bounce would be expected.

Betting on a turnaround, I would like to see a new management. The fact that
the CFO left but the rest stays in charge is a clear negative, imo.

Hi EKS
I too have MHRPC. It is currently 1.8% of my portfolio and I'm thinking about
increasing it to 4% or so. Ordinarily this would be out of the question and
doubly so with a small cap E&P. Yet, I think this is a unique opportunity
because of the outstanding yield, no PPS premium (issue is callable 12/11) and
most importantly, I've read that the estimated net value of the company is
significantly higher than book which gives a safety cushion for preferred
holders. The recent strength of the common is what's given me this idea. A
thought is that as long as I keep close tabs on company news and the common PPS
I'd be able to reduce my holdings quickly if negatives started to arise. The
only thing that gives me pause is the risk of company specific shit hitting the
fan suddenly with MHRPC gapping down hard. I'm not much concerned with macro
events as MHRPC has been remarkably stable. It's the "company specific" risk of
a hard gap down that concerns me.
Your comments appreciated.

I believe what he forecasts will happen sooner or later. The arguments he has
can be disputed only by the stubbornness of the government. If they have a
project to build 1000 m2 of office space per Chinese person, they have the
resources to do it. There was a project in Russia to turn the direction of the
rivers in northern Russia (Northern River Reversal project)
The fact is that every idiosyncrasy comes to an end. Whether they will finish
the project or slow it or just forbid construction starting tomorrow, the
demand for commodities (iron ore) will slow down. This means the transportation
of commodities will go down, so I will be looking closely at the BDI index.
If the index starts going down continuously I think this will be the time to be
out of CCCL. Madharry will say that they sell to tier II and tier III cities.
But when the construction in tier I cities slows the business of CCCL will go
down because many companies selling in tier I cities will start competing in
tier II and III cities.
Does anyone have an opinion how a downturn in the housing market will influence
GFRE?

Hi Joel -

Re: MHR-PC

I was thinking the same thing especially with their monthly distributions. It
would be nice to see the preferred trade higher than Par, then the Market is
telling you the current yield is a steal.

You can protect yourself from company specific risk by selling common shares
short against your position or buying some long term Puts on the common. When
looking at the complete picture, it is more likely that these preferreds will
be called away in 2011. I am expecting that eventually the company will be sold
to a major integrator and all of the preferred shares will be paid off and/or
refinanced into the larger company.

The key to watch is how the company builds value. Are new wells being
developed, is management completing their project(s) on time, are other JV
deals being completed (ie. gathering partners) and is the common stock rising
in price. So far all of the above can be answered YES! The company continues to
show very positive results.

Hi rllee -

Re: MHR-pC

On my Schwab Street Smart Pro platform as of 11:00 am PST I show 6,400 shares
traded all at $25.00. The company from time to time will issue more of these
shares to the market at $25.00/share as stated in their recent prospectus.
Therefore, I doubt the issue will ever trade higher than $25.00/share and if it
did, it would be for a very short period. You would have a small capital loss
if you sold shares above the PAR price.

There is not enough volume or price movement to "trade" but I did notice that
there was untypical price movement before AND after the ex dividend date (now
ex on the 15th of each month). The monthly dividend is $0.21/month. If you buy
the stock for $25.00 before the ex dividend date, you should be able to sell it
at $25.00/share after the ex dividend date (it goes back to $25.00/share in
about three trading days).

Therefore, you might be able to "scalp" 0.8%/month (or another 10% per year if
you were successful in doing the scalp each month over 12 months) on this
dividend capture. To me it's not worth the effort, it just may be a one month
fluke and you would have to trade in size to net anything worthwhile.

For me, this is a good alternative to bond and/or money market funds (you must
understand the specific stock risk!) for parking funds at least though 2011.

I plan to buy more shares next week (at least 3 trading days prior to
12/15/2010).

From the article:"...Some retailers are quietly renegotiating leases or asking

- They have nat gas production with nat gas hitting low prices (however, this

- They have refining operations that operate at negative margins with oil price
high.
- They have very few organic and cheap non-organic growth opportunities.

I agree that these two companies are not favored right now for various reasons,
but they did bounce pretty high the last time oil went over $100 and I'm hoping
they're ready to move again. In the meantime, I feel that their value

It does appear that they are active in closing any low performing sites. This
from their last Q report.....

One store was closed during the third quarter bringing the total number of
stores to 263 on October 30, 2010, compared to 267 at the same time last year.
As previously announced, the Company opened three new stores this month,
including one relocated store, which completes store openings for the remainder
of 2010. The Company expects to close one additional store at the end of the
fourth quarter of 2010 resulting in 264 stores at year-end.

Overall I agree with you, the defense pie is bound to become smaller so the

NFLX is at a bubble stage and will be a great short when the momentum ends.
Here are some of the negatives besides a very high evaluation:

1. They need content (TV shows online) to expand and would have to pay more for
it in time

2. The ISP's like Comcast wants to charge them for their customer's high
download/streaming usage which they need to pass on to customers or reduce its
own profits. This is in today's Wall Street Journal.

3. Even if they charge everyone in the US capable of steaming their products a
fee of $10/mo (or whatever the current rate is), it still will not add up to
its current evaluation.

4. To expand they need to go overseas but foreign ISP typically block US
programs (especially video) from use. To get overseas they have to pay more
fees to foreign entities and pass on the costs to foreign customers.

That's what I am thinking too.

Netflix is at such a high valuation that the fundamentals don't add up
currently in my opinion. (If I bought it before it started its bull run, maybe
it would've been a wonderful investment if I looked back at the results back
then (I haven't sorry).)

If you told me to pay 10 billion dollars to buy a company that earns 115
million a year, i'd tell you i'd look elsewhere. It would take over 10 years to
recoup my initial investment with the investment growing its net income 10% a
year.

Take another example, HSY, The Hershey's company. You would be paying roughly
the same to takeover the company but you would earn 400 million after tax.

You can debate Netflix has the potential to grow its earnings more but that's
another debate.

It is not very easy. For what they started with: Renting DVDs in the mail it is
a huge distribution operation. I think they also manufacture the media. For the
download they have created a very nice network of customers through their
download device, these people don't need to stream it through a computer or buy
Apple TV. They sell the device through sony playstations, TVs etc. etc. So
people get easy access to their service. This is a huge advantage. They are
exploding in Canada. Now they are adding European movies. Yes it is an easy
business to run. ebay is easy to run. But try to start another eBay.(even the
spell checker knows eBay) :)
And then the contracts with the studios who own the rights. You must have a
system that they all approve.

in my opinion Apple is the closest threat for Netflix. They already have the
device, the have the relations with the studios and they offer the service. In
this business if you can figure out who will be more useful to the studios you
can figure out who will be the ONE :) Some studios hate each other and would
not stay with one distributor. Anyways it is too unclear for me. I think
Netflix will stay. I wouldn't short it. I wouldn't be long either.

I dont agree with the argument that the ISPs can charge them. They can limit
their customers in bandwidth and their customers can go with the competitors,
like I did. My previous company made a limit up to 60Gig download. I waved my
hand good bye and now I get 200 Gig for 30% less. How can you not love

Re: Antares Energy Ltd. (AZZEF.PK)

Followed you into this one with a starter position. Bought through Schwab
Foreign Global desk. They charge an extra $50.00 transaction fee for being a

Did you account for their already booked "proven reserves"?

As of December 31, 2009, the company had proved, probable, and possible
reserves of 22,814 thousand barrels of oil equivalent.

When looking at their 2009 Annual Report, it's nice to see the first sentence
from the CEO:

From the 2009 Antares Energy Limited annual report

"...Antares’ financial discipline and operational diligence has resulted in a
very successful year of growth, with all shareholders having been able to reap
the reward through a greater than 1000% increase in share price...."

These joint interests must have some value too.

Prefer you ask someone else who may know better about such trades. There are
brokers around who don't charge an extra fee for "F" shares. Whether that means
such a trade doesn't get the best execution or price, I don't know. I mean, I
assume the USA broker has to clip you somewhere if the USA broker has to pay
something to a foreign broker to execute the trade.

Some brokers charge an extra fee only "sometimes", like if they have to go
through a "foreign desk". And I've got one discount broker who won't tell me if
that charge is certain unless I call immediately before the trade, and even
then the response is, "We're not certain, so assume yes, a charge." That's one

Antares: I've not read the annual report. Since Antares' sales of Eagle Ford
properties are recent, the booked reserves at end of '09 are no longer valid.

Remaining Eagle Ford aspect I accounted for (by assuming land values, not p or
2p reserves).

Oyster Creek has value, but I didn't see how to quantify it, so I just call it
>$0.00.

About Antares' "other" properties Antares says this about them:
"Antares Energy has non-operated interests in several other Texas joint
ventures which are not material to the Company at present and are not likely to
be in the future. It is expected that these will be wound up or Antares will

With the market up over 300 (Dow) past two days, I'm not getting any open buy

I'll step up my position in e&p company Lucas Energy
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LEI now though. Enterprise value ($31.3M, per
Yahoo) is below 2pnpv10 of $51.9M.
====================================================
"HOUSTON, Nov. 29, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lucas Energy, Inc. (NYSE Amex:LEI)
an independent oil and gas company based in Houston, Texas, has provided an
internal management update based upon its revised Eagle Ford potential reserves
(proved and probable) as of September 30, 2010.

The net present value at a 10% discount rate ("PV10") of the potential reserves
estimated for Lucas by Forrest A. Garb & Associates, Inc. (Garb) as of April 1,
2010 was $51.9 million. Lucas performed an internal evaluation, as of September
30, 2010, and calculated an $83.6 million PV10 valuation for Lucas potential
reserves. Garb's report as of April 1, 2010 estimated 2.7 million barrels of
oil equivalent (BOE) of potential reserves, whereas Lucas' internal report, as
of September 30, 2010, had an estimated 4.3 million BOE of potential reserves."

---
It seems to me Lucas is a small-time player that has acquired land rights and
old abandoned oil wells in the Austin Chalk area of Texas. Their business has
been to retrofit/rework and place the wells back in service. It turns out, I
believe, that under the Austin Chalk runs another layer -- the Three Forks,
which now become the current big deal play in the oil bidness. It appears that
Lucas has the rights to the Three Forks layer underneath their part of the
Austin Chalk layer, and this is what enables Lucas management to guess their
large value ($83.6M) for npv.

Valuation looks undemanding though and the equity start to look like a call

The high pricing strategy with promotions to drive traffic does not work well

I agree there's a spectrum of fakeness ;). If books are just a bit cooked :P,
HRBN is still a bargain. If they are cooked a lot or business is missing, then
it's kaput. HRBN passes my current smoke tests: not huge AR, earnings <= OCF,
no very funny derivatives/loans/liabilities. E.g. RINO had high AR and earnings
>> OCF, which is why I sold way before current debacle.

However, AR, OCF - all these can still be cooked, just needs more cooking. ;)

UTA - I did not buy it. I'd need to look at my notes, I seem to remember they
had some funny transactions selling some of their agents/subs for pittance.
From quick glance OCF/earnings discrepancy in June and Dec quarters are
suspicious. There was a claim that UTA was not legit business similar to claims
about CEU. I cannot verify whether that claim is valid.

Edit: BTW, even if books are just a bit cooked, the stock can drop dramatically
when this is disclosed and revisions are filed. So it's better to buy on panic
when it's announced. However, since we don't know if such panic/announcement
will happen, we kinda have to decide if buying at current prices is "good
enough". ;) HRBN has already encountered 3rd party allegations of "fakeness",

NFLX - One of my concerns about NFLX having to pay for content to compete with
Hulu & others was just announced:

Netflix puts money on the table for Hollywood studios' shows

Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) is all-in in its efforts to attract subscribers to its
Watch Instantly streaming service. Reports say the movie rental service is in
negotiations with Hollywood studios to pay up to $100,000 an episode for
"fresh" TV shows to spice up its streaming media service with TV shows days or
even hours after they've been broadcast on TV, reports say.

If Netflix can get studio buy-in--and there's no guarantee of that, even with
the good price it's offering--it would become more competitive with Hulu and a
more serious threat to cable.

The move would also be somewhat financially remarkable for the service which is
attracting viewers by deeply undercutting cable subscription rates. "It's just
not going to happen at $7.99," Olaf Olafsson, a Time Warner vice president said
during a New York conference. Web companies like Netflix and Hulu must up the
ante (which is what Netflix is doing) before Time Warner is willing to sign on.

"We encourage all of that stuff, as long as people pay for the content,"
Olafsson said. "That's why we're not on Hulu."

OT - NFLX

NFLX is already raising the price for DVD+streaming plan by $2. This is
probably going to be accepted by most viewers. The real question is whether
they will have to raise price even more and what's the breaking point. I'm fine
with paying $9-10 for 1DVD+streaming. I think I'd pay $15 if they charged that
- don't tell them ;) - but would everyone else? Right now, I wouldn't want to
have just DVDs or just streaming. 1DVD plan is too slow, streaming is too
limited. However, it might be that just streaming will become viable in couple
years.

IMHO, NFLX as investment is hugely overpriced. I do not short stocks though and
I would not suggest shorting NFLX as long as it's a leader. It could go very
high on momentum.

The valuation does not make sense. I thought we learned our lesson on valuation
during the late 90s??? 

Short answer: no.

Longer answer: Leaders ("nifty fifty", "Gorillas", "Godzillas") often tend to
have outlandish valuations. Shorting leaders is a tough job since they often
manage to find ways to outrun expectations (see Google, MSFT 20 years ago,
Apple last couple years, etc.). That's why the slogan "Gorillas are always
undervalued" is not as silly as it sounds. Valuations eventually break (see
MSFT now, CSCO now, KO/PEP even), but "eventually" sometimes takes years and
decades and shorts don't necessarily get vindicated. Yes, some leaders break
down much faster and a lot more (Polaroid, Kodak, Xerox), but finding out
whether company will follow Polaroid path or CSCO path is not easy.

Usually, the Polaroid path are companies that can't manage to innovate from a
single product/idea/innovation they own. Still it's not easy to predict what
will happen. Exhibit A: Apple. It almost died, had to take investment from
MSFT, and then iPod happened. Who woulda thought?

NFLX has a strong position in video rental / streaming. It's easy to say that
competition will appear and eat their lunch. In reality, competing with them is
not easy as Blockbuster and Walmart have discovered and these are not your
lightweights. In the superbull scenario NFLX will find markets that gel well
with their video distribution and do an AMZN (yeah, AMZN was also supposed to
die: how can you justify such valuation for a bookstore? And then it's not just
a bookstore anymore, but everything-retailer...). In superbear scenario,
studios will ratchet payments, kill streaming, launch their own services,
Comcast/Amazon/Google will compete and NFLX is toast.

I wouldn't bet on either outcome. :)

Gun company SWHC recommended on CNBC today, and maybe that accounts for the
rise in the stock price. I'll guess a temporary blip and that I can reenter
later at a lower price, if I want. Sold position.

MVC. UBS starts with a buy recommendation. Stock moves up a little. I'll take
it as an opportunity to reduce position (which I did, by 2/3).

Good company and management, it seems to me. Yield is modest, but it's not
about yield. It's just become another stock that trades such that if market
volatility continues, I believe I would want reenter at lower price, and I
might have a chance to do that. But who knows?

BIG: Discount retailer Big Lots today provided a not-inspiring view of its
ending quarter and upcoming quarter. "Deep discounter Big Lots posts a 42%
decline in profits in its fiscal third quarter and lowers its outlook."

On the news, I added to my losing position. I'll guess that I've held varying
amounts of this stock continuously for 25 years. At this time compared to other
times, my position is relatively large.

No ltd, profitable 9 of past 10 years. "Big Lots said it is now looking for
full-year earnings of $2.75 to $2.81 per share, down from a prior forecast of
$2.82 to $2.90." On a $29.50 stock, that's about a p/e of 10, which seems okay
to me.

Soon after the company's report was issued, Barron's had a favorable story out
on Big Lots:

"...At 10 times forward earnings, Big Lots offers investors a compelling
opportunity assuming the company can generate the kind of earnings-growth
investors crave...
To be sure, Big Lots is a show me story. It needs to improve its consumables
business. Investors won't tolerate more disappointments or any further drop in
earnings.
But with such a low multiple and so much negative sentiment reflected in the
stock price, Big Lots cans still deliver the goods."

EKS. Here's a more negative opinion on MRK relative to a positive opinion on
ABT.

These "pipeline" analyses -- they vary so much from analyst to analyst. I
expect to read something in the next couple of months that will be entirely
different from what Morningstar says here.

I'm still considering MRK as a possible buy for me.
