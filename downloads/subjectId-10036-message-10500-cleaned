Paul, re coms. I have been in this stock for about 1 year and sold Jan 2001 50
calls when I initially purchased. As to palm, the syndicators played some nasty
games ,IMHO, when they structured such a small float and sucked in yuppies at
the IPO. Initially they were going to offer the ipo at about 16 but the media
frenzy gave them the opportunity to significantly raise the ante for the small
number of shares being offered. They probably were correct in their original
assessment and my gut feeling is that palm will be between 16-20 within a few
weeks after the avalanche of shares is distributed to coms owners. This will
put coms at about 40-50. Just my opinions Paul, but I would play this one by
writing slightly in the money covered calls each month until distribution.

The most incredible value I've run across in recent years is Range Resources
(RRC). It has about $2.74 per share in cash flow and sells for $1.50 per share.
It has 70% gas and 30% oil. The company's debt was downgraded, the the company
disappointed analysts, then they cut the dividend, then cut it again, then
eliminated the dividend. Finally, the company HQ was hit by a tornado!! You
talk about a washed up stock! Underlying this is the fact that they have hedged
100% of their production through 2001 at $2.75 per mcf and $18 oil. Most of
their debt is non-recourse therefore this company will not go under. It has
traded above $20 in the last three years and I think it's easily worth $5-$10
per share. Take a look and share your thoughts.

Happy Investing

WebMyst, I agree that FNV is worth looking at; even among the wreckage of many
financials, it stands out for value. Nothing new about a stock being hammered
after announcing a nasty earnings hit, but this company posted such consistent
and reliable earnings and dividend growth before this that one wonders if this
quarters surprise might truly be a one time event, and not a sign of more
trouble to come. I wonder how it compares in quality of loans and management,
and return on equity, to, say, Allied Capital, another company which lends to
small and medium sized businesses. Interesting to note how Stephen E. Jones, in
the Value Line Survey, March 3, wrote "Conservative accounting ought to keep
negative earning surprises at bay." Ouch. Oh well, now we get to wind the clock
back to 1993, and buy Finova at a price which was last available way back then.

I have started to vote against virtually all option plans in proxies. Enough is

get stock outright (given to them as a bonus) because it takes less shares to
offer the same value as options (because this company's stock never goes up I
presume). Of course they get options too. Enough is enough - I am absolutely
disgusted when I analyze a company and realize I've got to discount the
valuation by 10% because that is how much management is raking off the top, and
that never hits the financial statements.

Yes, re. LANC. That's the problem: the stock is down to lows for an
inexplicable reason. Maybe similar to last time when there was no known reason
(and the stock rebounded from this level). Maybe this time there will be a
reason and it will be revealed, and we won't like it. Negatives I can see are
sales increases that have slowed somewhat, and insiders are continual sellers.
Also scary to me is that I don't understand how their ROE is so very good -
almost too good - for a company in mundane businesses.

Still, it's got very good financial numbers at this point. Very good ROE, ROA,
profit margins - and good every year. We also have reductions in long term
debt, buying back stock, increasing their dividends. (aside: which are all good
things companies should be doing imo with high ROE in a slow sales growth
business.) With the low price, we also get low (compared to previous years)
p/sales, p/book, p/earnings.

I'll mention two to the thread:
The first (NOVL) is not a classic value stock. It will get hammered today. I

It has, as far as I have followed it, had an impeccable balance sheet. I
believe a share repurchase is still in place. George Gilder wrote a glowing
piece about it recently. I looked at my Value Line of 3/03/00, the stock was at
34...today, will trade around 13. Can you say "air pocket"? Can the company,
once again, get its house in order?
FLO is another one mentioned here from time to time. With Unilever's interest
in BFO, that may very well bode well for food stocks in general.
This may be better left for the arb thread, but what does anyone think of BFO
in the low 60s, where it will probably open? Unilever's offer is $66/cash. Will
the ante need to be raised?

David RRC A quick glance reveals some concerns: High debt levels, recent S&P
debt downgrade, Insider FIRST RESERVE CORP selling aggressively

the company for inadequate severence [public filings on that suit might make

%BOM---------------------
Date:5/3/2000 6:29:00 PM
From:David Lee Smith

THIS IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE STOCK!! Range Resources (RRC) concerns are factored
in the stock price.

1) There is only one big insider seller, First Reserve Fund. I have a call into
the company to get more color on this. As you know, there are many reasons to
sell that may not be related to the fundamentals of the company, but may
non-the-less temporarily depress the stock price.

2) There have been many insider buyers in the last twelve months paying more
than $3 per share. These insiders include: Thomas Edelman, Chairman of the
Board, Geoffrey Duke, VP Controller, Thomas Stoelk, Sr. VP Finance, Rodney
Waller, director, Steven Grose, Sr. VP Appalachian region. None of these
insiders are selling!

3) To be more accurate, it was the COO not the CFO who resigned. If you look
deeper, you will find out that the COO came from a prior acquisition with a
golden parashute contract. After that contract expired, he was let go; his
contract was not renewed. No one at the company wanted him. He was baggage with
the acquition. His threat of a lawsuit is likely without merit...sour grapes.

4) The debt was downgraded along with the stock because of disappointing
operating results during the fourth quarter. I expect a turnaround this year.
Included in both analysts reports is reference to the expectation of weaker gas
prices as their prime justification for the downgrade. RRC has hedged it's oil
and gas prices out eighteen months. I disagree with the analyst's assesments.

5) Yes there is lots of debt, but as I've stated before, it is non recourse to
the parent company; it is subordinated debt. The only consolation is that the
company will not be forced into Chapter 11. This means that RRC is a long-term
play on gas prices. Their deliverability is high cost, long lived and needs
high prices to make it work. On the other hand, during low prices, the company
will not go bankrupt.

6) I'm bullish on gas prices longer term.

7) The stock sells at less than 0.60 times cash flow when other E&P companies
are selling for 4X-8X cash flow. A 4X cash flow company is one that usually has
high debt and some problems whereas the 8x and greater cash flow companies are
the darlings that we don't talk about on this thread. If RRC sold at 4X cash
flow of $2.74 per share(1999A) it would sell at $10.96 per share.

8) Selling at $1.56 per share it's one of the greatest values selling in the
stock market today.

David Lee Smith: RCC, "one of the greatest values selling in the stock market
today".

RCC might work out okay. I'll defer to others on this thread before I look
further. I'm turned off by the lack of earnings and asset sales and dividend
cut to reduce debt. If it's such a great value, I believe others here - this is
the value thread! - should be able to see it. Their posting that they've bought
will rekindle my interest.

I can not verify your #2 point: "There have been many insider buyers in the
last twelve months paying more than $3 per share." I only see one 'buyer' ($24K
worth at $2.18 on 2/18/00) going back to start of 1999. There has been much
stock 'acquired' (Yahoo wording), which I take to mean are option exercises -
not buyers who pay (as in open market purchases). (Anybody know?) Still a
positive perhaps, as the insiders seem not to have sold all the stock they
took. First Reserve, the 10% holder has filed to sell - maybe already has -
1.5M shares. They look like big players in their oil stocks - 10% holders. They
have bumped up their position in in PDE (+$72M) and are reducing their position
in NOI (looks like they have about $243M worth). My point is - just a guess
actually - that First Reserve - if they're willing to sell 1.4M shares anywhere
near RRC's current low price, they might also just as soon be willing to get
rid of their entire position (looks like they have about 4.5M sh), because
compared to their other holdings/purchases, RCC worth and potential stock price
increase (say a triple) is a gnat's $ amount. But which sale(s) or threat of,
could keep RCC stock at low levels.

JMO, and I've been wrong many,many times before.

The severance package at CNC may be even worse than the one at Mattel (I didn't
lose money on CNC so I don't get as angry.)

Maybe one of these will be so bad that the D&O insurance company says "I'm not
paying, sue us." Something like that might get directors attention. I would
have absolutely no problem with the Mattel directors paying the shareholder
suit settlements out of their own pockets. You understand how this works,
right? The company will be sued again for the severance package, but its all
insured, so the directors have absolutely no accountability. And to make
matters worse, if its not insured, the settlement comes out of the company's
coffers (out of the victim's pocket).

On the off-chance that any corporate director might read this - YOU WORK FOR
SHAREHOLDERS!

The correct answer for the Mattel directors would have been "Jill, thank you
for your service, there's the door. You owe the company $3 million for the
mortgage on your house. You get no bonus for 1999. And whatever was promised
you in your contract is forfeited because of gross negligence. If you don't
like it, take it to court." That's what Sunbeam did to Dunlap, and I don't

Unfortunately, you hit the nail on the head. The shareholders will suffer with

I was considering conseco but am glad that they released this gross severance
package before I bought in. The stock went from the watch list to the trash
can.
In the interest of value plays, I again offer up AGX (spinoff from Ralston) but
in the agricultural feeds business. They have 17 in cash, trade at 37 and
negligible debt (about 3/share) They are buying back shares, have insider
buying at levels higher than this, are profitable (albeit in a not glamorous
business) and trade at a PE of about 9. Cash flow from operations equals about
1/2 of the enterprise value. Capital is required to get into the business
(barrier to entry) and they seem to have decent management although they
managed to award themselves some pretty hefty stock options in the last proxy.
Any thoughts ?

AGX may be cheap (or just look cheap) for the same reason IBP does. With hog
prices high, more animals are being slaughtered than being born. Kind of like a
negative book to bill ratio in less gross terms. Less animals, less demand for
feed. I didn't realize there was all that cash on the balance sheet. I'll take
another look. The market, with its two week time horizon, quite possibly has
overreacted.

Oh today was a wonderful day to own food stocks - I own a bunch of them - and
somebody discovered SNH today and drove it up a point. Blair popped the other
day. Yesterday's gold rally was welcome and REITs have been a wonderful place
to be for the last six months though nobody has noticed yet which tells me not
to take profits until I see the Business Week article. Great week to be a bear
- if only I hadn't been scared out of my tech shorts I'd be even happier. ANF
has not been working. I didn't think there were any more analysts left to
downgrade this stock, but this morning here comes another one! The one who
downgraded it the day before I bought at 11 1/8 retained a price target of 40 I
believe, so we're not dealing with value investors here.

I've been LBO hunting. I've bought BLL, DNY and more EBSC on this rationale,
and am looking at a growing list of stocks I have to find time to research. I
used to do LBOs in a past life, representing both the seller and the LBO fund
(not at the same time, of course). If there was ever a time to learn how to
analyze LBOs, it is now (well, actually it was probably 1986, but if there was
ever a time after that...)

I'll throw one out to you here - US Can (USC) - an LBO in progress, so this one
is a little easier. A bid is already on the table from management at 21 (is it
firm? its a little squishy maybe, but the stock is kind of worth where it
trades with or without the bid. Look at the cash flow statement, but also look
at the balance sheet - one is good, one is bad.) There have been many
opportunities to buy a shade over 18. That's a 15% return in less than 6 months
if the deal closes, not much downside if you can ride out the storm if the deal
falls apart, and the possibility of upside from a higher bid.

What is also disturbing about Mattel's situation is that it probably set back
the opportunities for female chief executive officers just when the world was
starting to trickle out of the stone age. After Jill Barad had held herself up
as an example for women executives when things were good (and even when things
weren't), if she had any class at all she would have refused the severance
payment even if she were entitled to it. (Anybody with an ounce of integrity
would have resigned and refused any further compensation. Call me stupid, but
that's what I would have done if I were in her shoes. Reread Buffett's latest
shareholder letter where he tells the story about the Utah Mormon who runs one
of Berkshire's furniture businesses and the reverence with which he manages
shareholder capital.) She complained many times about a glass ceiling. How
ironic that her own actions (both in terms of mismanagement and then her greed)
just made it even more difficult for other female executives to prove
themselves. Given her past track record of attributing any criticism of her
management of the company to sexism, I'm sure she's going to say men have
gotten these big severance packages too - but shareholders wanted to hang them
too.

I guess she must need the $125,000 a month for ten years because I cannot
imagine a board hiring her to run a public company ever again.

After all this, I'd buy Mattel here before I'd short it, though I choose to do
neither for the time being. Negative sentiment can't get much worse. That said,
I admit I sold within a point of the bottom, though I believe that funded a
purchase of BRK at 1411. Don't sell when you're mad goes alongside the rule
don't buy when you're giddy.

Range Resources (RRC) is a great value. I spoke with management this morning
and the First Reserve selling is due to the fact that it is a partnership that
is liquidating all of its positions and closing. This has been the #1 drag on
this stock.

News today is positive...they are continuing to paydown debt. Earnings should
be positive this year.

Oil and gas companies are best measured by cash flow because the IRS allows
intangible drilling costs to be written off depressing earnings. In addition,
because of successful efforts accounting, deferred taxes tends to be large in
oil and gas companies. On a price-to-cash flow basis (the best measure for an
E&P company) the stock is extremely cheap.

Yes, this company is a warrent on gas prices with a 30-40 year life and a stike
price of $3/mcf gas. At $2.60/mcf the company is break-even. The company is
cash flow positive down to $1/mcf. The long-term outlook for gas prices is
good. Demand is growing. Limited supply. Great combination for a long-term
investor.

Asset values are indeed poor. The debt holders currently own the company of
that there is no doubt. But as gas prices rise, asset prices rise too. In
addition, debt is being repaid rapidly. I expect the residual to the equity
holder over time to be very significant. If you hold this stock for the next
five years, it is likely it could increase by 500% or more easily.

Web Myst, Robert Hoefer, re: FNV, CIT, ALLC.

Anyone looking at CIT which I mentioned here ought to consider FNV. FNV does
look much the better buy. Thanks for bringing FNV to my attention.

Robert, I'll just guess that you and I both have been holding ALLC for several
years.
Web Myst, ALLC is a company that tries to increase its investment return (over
and above contractual interest payments) by "harvesting capital gains" by the
way they structure their deals. As I look at some of the financial numbers and
ratios over the past year and years, ALLC does not appear that attractive -
certainly less so than FNV now. However, ALLC is a company that should be
looked at from a total return and historical basis, IMO. My assumption is that
with FNV, one is betting the problems they now have are temporary, and the
stock will return to or near its past valuations (thus providing a dandy
capital gains to purchasers at these current levels). With ALLC, considering
its steady progress, its high dividends, and the expertise of its management,
this could be a stock that continues on track to provide a high total return
over the next few years. (ALLC has claimed a superior return over its first 18
year business history - I won't quote it here because so much depends on when
one could've got into the stock and because the starting base was very low.)

I'd like to throw out another Ohio company that deserves some attention, IMO.
(to go along with LANC, BOBE, ANF some other Ohio cos. mentioned here).

FMER, a regional bank, looks good (along with a lot of other banks). But the
reason why I like them is that historically they've grown through acquisition,
which has hurt them for the past 12 months or so. As I understand it, one of
the major shareholders of an acquired bank (Security First, I think) had been
dumping a lot of shares. Which I think is somewhat typical in mergers since the
seller is usually looking for a way to get out of the business.

I think that most of the selling is done, and they have worked out most of the
kinks from the 98 & 99 mergers. I expect earnings to growth nicely in 2000 and
2001.

To All,

Andrew Smithers just sent me a copy of his new book called "Valuing Wall St. -
The Q Ratio".

I've been corresponding with Mr. Smithers for about two years and have read a
number of his reports on the US stock market and the values.

His favorite topic is Tobins Q (replacement costs).

This book is far and away the best I've ever seen on the subject. Not only does
it have a lot of statistics that support his views, but it also explains the
economics behind stock market mean reversion, the cost and return on capital
and a bunch of other great stuff.

Sorry for the plug, but this one is worth it for all value oriented investors.

K-Mart: From CBS Marketwatch tonight:
Kmart (KM: news, msgs) shares fell 6.8 percent after the company
announced that April same-store sales rose a disappointing 0.8 percent.
Total sales for the four weeks ended April 26 were $2.77 billion, up only
slightly from $2.75 billion in the same period a year earlier. Citing the slow
sales growth, the retailer said it expects first-quarter earnings to come in at
5 cents a share, compared with last year's profit of 11 cents. Kmart said
it's "already taking steps to regain sales momentum" so that it can still meet
financial targets for the full year. Shares fell 9/16 to 7 11/16.

I broke a cardinal rule of value investing today by selling FIT below its cash

Added again to SNH at 9 3/8. I rarely buy at a higher price than my last buy
(not rational, just a character flaw), but this one I bought at 12, 10, 8 1/2,
then again when it went to 8 1/2, and now at 9 3/8. My average cost is
somewhere in there. This one better work, because it is now my biggest
position. Every new piece of information I get fits the original thesis (which
was actually Mike's discovery - I just confirmed his research and then have
followed the progress from there), which adds to my conviction.

Also bought some US Can at 17 3/4 today - I've been watching and waiting on
this one and finally got my price. With a cash offer on the table for $21, and
a strong value case to be made even without the offer I figure I have little

SNH excepted - that is a workout, not expected to move with the REIT group - I
would be looking to start selling REITs soon, maybe start now if you've got a
big position. I bought my basket of REITs (Fidelity mutual fund) in October and
didn't get the bottom exactly but got within 5%. There has been about a 15%
move since then, more relative to the market, and much more relative to "value
stocks". This was a great buy in hindsight, now how not to roundtrip the thing.
I haven't started to sell yet, but I'm close. My last add was in mid March,
just in time to catch the latest run.

The reason to buy was that the sector was way way out of favor and more
importantly the stocks were trading at a nearly 20% discount to the value of
the properties owned. At a 20% discount either the stocks bottom or things like
takeovers, LBOs and liquidations start to happen. Now we are right about at net
asset value in my estimation. Maybe not a reason to sell if you believe
investors are going to flock to REITs because they see momentum or a story. I'm
not betting on that. Up 5% from here, I'm probably gone.

(15% moves don't sound big in the context of this market, but for REITs, where
there was virtually no risk last fall and an 8% yield, that's a pretty good
trade in my book collecting two dividends along the way.)

The reason to start exiting now is that these are going to top when the first
REIT comes to the market with a secondary offering. Its going to happen very
soon, and it will be greeted harshly, quite possibly making the top in the
sector just as it did last April.

I know, what do you buy for safety if not REITS? At 15-20% below NAV I
considered REITS very safe. At full value (NOT overvalued - lets be clear) they
may not be sells right now, but they are not the safe haven they once were.
Relative to the S&P, maybe, but I'm talking relative to cash. I might suggest
USC below 18 or similar arbitrage plays. Thats what I'm looking for - can
anybody who is following this strategy suggest a short list of 3 more?

I like X as well, the only thing that could be a crutch is the high insider

increase prices because there is less foreign steel being dumped. I know for a
fact that TRN has raised guardrail prices about 10% across the board.

Another stock I'm considering reentering is CD, known best for their accounting
irregularities 2 years ago. I believe that all the bad news is behind them.
John Malone of Liberty Media bought a chunk around $23-24. They are near their
2 year low (with the exception of a few months after the accounting scandal). I
think that Henry Silverman is trying to make the company attractive for someone
else to takeover. (no hype intended) Because as I understand it, before the
accounting debacle, he intended on retiring.

Note: I am a current and previous trader of CD, my position has been trimmed
some since it hit 25 earlier this year, but I anticipate more buying. I am a
past holder of X, and am considering re-entering.

OT could somone please explain to me( or point me in the direction of) when

My understanding is that they are included when doing so would reveal "dilution
of EPS", and excluded when doing so would be "antidilutive". Translated into
plain English, this means that if they show a GAAP profit, they will also show
a "diluted EPS" that includes outstanding options and warrants. If they have a
GAAP loss, then they don't calculate a "diluted loss per share", because that
would be "antidilutive". IMHO, that's a shame, because what I really want to
know is how big the hit will be, if and when they become successful.

I forget now if they only include vested options (I think this is the case),
and whether they include all vested options or only in-the-money options (on
still weaker ground here, I think it is ITM options only).

OT: re options in "diluted share count",

The short answer is that I don't know the answers to your queries. However for
an individual company you could tell by reading the footnotes exactly which
options they are including and which ones they are not.

To perhaps philosophize a bit, to explain away the need for the answer, and to
answer your questions with a question: Do you really need to know the exact
accounting rules w.r.t. what to count (and what will be counted in the future)?

What I am getting at is this: If you are interested in buying a company, you
are of course going to be digging in beyond the "GAAP at face value". Isn't
what really matters to you is where your ownership position will be in X years,
in a variety of scenarios that you might envision for the company? If they are
particularly abusive with options grants now, it might be reasonable to weigh
the possibility that they might take away a substantial portion of your gains
as a shareholder by continuing to be free and easy with the options.

This is one reason why shorting is so much more attractive: Shareholder
dilution, and other forms of management sleazery, are a hidden bonus instead of
a hidden peril! ;-)

TROY group: check out these numbers, PEG below one.

TROY ran up over 40 on excitement about it's new e-checking product, which it
sold to Ameritrade, among others. It sold off enormously when other big e-firms
didn't immediately materialize.

TROY's e-checks could still take off at any time, but for now TROY is so
oversold that it is a screaming buy bargain EVEN IF THEY NEVER MAKE A NICKEL ON
E-CHECKS (which is

impossible since it already has growing sales and the development costs have
already been spent) TROY's price now is lower than it was before they had
echecks!

The proof is in the earnings numbers:
TROY's 5 year earnings per share growth rate is 85%
TROY's annual earnings per share were 31 cents in 1998, 64 cents in 1999.
TROY's earnings per share were 12 cents in 1st quarter 1999, 14 cents in the
1st quarter of 2000.

TROY also beat every analyst's earnings estimates in each of the last two
quarters.

Even if TROY never ever sells another single e-check, then based just on its
old businesses alone, TROY's earnings per share are projected to grow at least
24% (adjusting for the change in float).

TROY's PE is less than the most conservative possible estimated growth rate.
That's what Peter Lynch calls a PEG (price earnings / growth) of less than one.
TROY's historical PEG is an astounding .22

It does sound good. How about pointing out that management owns 60% or so of
the company and in their infinite wisdom voted for a plan that increases the
number of options out there by 1.5MM on april 6. thus increasing dilution by
around 15%. The concern I have is whether earnings growth will ultimately
exceed share growth. Next year maybe management will vote themselves a 25%
increase in options.

company's success.

Assuming TROY managment wants to maximize their own profits, they will not want
to dilute too much, since doing so will drive down the price by more than the
extra options can compensate. It's worth noting that there has been virtually
no insider selling, even when the price was more than double what it was today.
Clearly management, knowing possible future dilution plans, still expects far
higher prices than we currently see.

Besides, even if you shave 15% per year off the top for future dilutions (which
frankly is not likely), you still have the chance of huge a payday if the
e-checking initiatives pan out, plus an unbeatable core business PE to growth
ratio even if they don't.

Buying OMX today. Possibly the weakest of the three large office supply chains.
Still, at about $5+/sh., it's under tangible book value and selling at a low
psr. They are searching for ways to add value to their stores - doing deals
with IBM, Compaq, now Gateway. 11 of 17 analysts covering this stock have it as
a hold. I say they are wrong -g-.

Unlike TROY, OMX is not a "screaming buy bargain". (3 analysts of 3 rate TROY
'strong buy', per Yahoo.) But if TROY has "sold off enormously", so has OMX. I
haven't a clue what OMX earnings are going to grow at. Certainly not 24% that
TROY is "projected" to grow. I haven't a clue what OMX PEG ratio is. Certainly
not anywhere near "astounding" .22. Can speak only for myself of course, but
the dearth of posts on this thread regarding PEG ratios leads me to believe not
too many here use that ratio in assessing value. (And it is a poor
justification for buying a value stock, imo.) And as for basing numbers on a
5-year history, at least OMX has a five year public history (TROY does not). To
propose- for a two-year old company - something called "the most conservative
possible estimated growth rate" and not have 0 included in that "most
conservative" possibility -- that is confidence indeed. (EFX, for example, may
be selling a product similar to TROY's echeck with the EFX advantage of having
access to their own large consumer credit database. So here's a possibility to
me anyway, for 0 growth for this aspect of TROY's business model)

I'll bet OMX has a better risk/reward balance that TROY does, and maybe also
has a better chance of doubling from here than TROY does.

Paul,

Good points about not trusting 5 year growth rates dating from before TROY went
public (which is why I also supplied more recent numbers). I also agree that
the most conservative possible estimate for TROY's e-check earnings is zero. My
point is that TROY's core businesses are stable sources of earnings that, by
themselves, can be very conservatively projected to grow at 24% per year (which
is far slower than their past growth).

For many years, TROY has printed every social security check in the nation.
TROY supplies HP and other printers with software. My claim is that TROY is a
tremendous bargain just based on that steady business. Any possible e-check
payoff is a bonus. Selling momentum regarding e-checking has driven TROY's
price down well below fundamental valuation based on non-e-checking earnings. I
can't vouch for TROY valuations based on criteria other than earnings, and have
no opinion on risk/reward of TROY vs OMX, though I'd guess that TROY's
volitility is likely to be greater, given the sector it is in.

these online brokers like ETrade, Ameritrade, Waterhouse are dumping shares to

One argument I've heard is that ECN's are the way of the present and future,

There is some really good analysis on the NITE thread by Sir Francis Drake.

Bear market or not, NITE transacts 20% of the Nasdaq volume. Would you like to
own that company for 3 Billion?
ECN's do not provide sufficient liquidity as the market makers do.

Backing up my losing position in Consolidated Stores (CNS) by adding a little
more today. CNS is:

Selling below book value and at a relatively low p/bk
Selling near a five-year low
Selling at a relatively low price/sales

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=cns

Some negatives to be sure-- KB Toys - the profitability of the toy business,
its now obligatory e-tail presence. And the management of the Big
Lots/MacFrugals operations. (CNS quadrupled revenues since '95 but have not
done well bringing earnings in.) Also, there's been no insider buying that I
can see at these low prices. On the other hand, debt/equity ratio is low,
they're not likely to go out of business (imo), and at current price maybe
risk/reward favors a buy.

Any comments on the high volume on EBSC yesterday?

179,000 shares traded and stock closed down 1/16.

I don't have a sense whether that is significant or not. It went as low as $4
1/2 on that heavy volume; but only as 1/16 point decline, so there is some
buying.

Anyone still holding this stock?

I hope this is not an indication of poor earnings to come on May 16.

I was also thinking of purchasing more at $4.00, if the price declines to that
level.

Appreciate the boards thoughts and comments on this one.

EBSC and >>Anyone still holding this stock?<<

I assume you are asking if anyone on this thread who had bought this stock
based on the reasons listed on this thread, is still holding. (The stock has
dropped from the prices at which the EBSC discussion has taken place.)

My recollection is that EBSC was presented/discussed as a net-net stock. There
have been two general categories of net-nets discussed here. One category is a
net-net with a "kicker" - some reason that the stock buyer might believe would
enable realization of value - stock buyback, large insider buys, spin offs,
etc. Unless the reason for expecting that kicker has changed, people here who
bought should still be holding.

The second category, is a net-net based more on the financials alone, but also
trying to maintain a basket of such stocks. For those of us who use such a
method (I am one), we should still be holding if we bought (I did) because the
stock still fits the model (the NCA figure may have got even more attractive).

In this environment, we don't see Ben Graham larger cap net-net stocks that he
recommended/preferred. So anyone who's bought EBSC or similar net-nets, imo is
buying if not cigar butts, preowned cigars-- at best. And with these stocks,
things don't look so good (kicker or not, imo)going into a buy position. So my
opinion is: There is NO good reason for anyone in category 2 to have sold. Not
because the price has dropped, not because the business might be getting worse,
not because of margin calls in the portfolio (a justifiable reason, yes, but
but being overextended is an error), and not because better opportunities now
seem to be elsewhere (that was true before the purchase - after all it is a
cigar butt - everything else should be looking better). To me, part of the deal
with these net-nets is that you must stay in to realize the value.

Because some of these net-nets don't work out, my opinion is that category 2
people ought to be very careful about averaging down in a position. It may (or
may not) be better to deploy funds into a different net-net (if one could be
found). OTOH (-g-), if one is a detailed watcher and student of EBSC, then
perhaps adding to EBSC at its lows might be an appropriate use of funds.

JMO, and I have been wrong many, many times

NITE's multiples are typical of other brokerages.

Based on that, I wouldn't say it's an unusual value stock. Maybe a better
growth play than its peers, but otherwise not unusual based on p/e, p/b, etc.

Four things that strike me about NITE are:

* its historical growth rate is higher than peers. Will that continue?

* tons of form 144's filed. I suppose you gave a reason for this.

* stock is traded at 10X the volume of its peers. Why?

* no dividends, whereas most peers yield 1%. For a big financial company, I'd
rather see a dividend.

KMart? I have trouble getting interested in a retailer where nobody seems to

I shopped for a phone at KMart, and I saw that they weren't bothering to keep
products stocked above the correct binlabels, and other such signs that
management doesn't care. The store was drab. I won't go back.

BTW, they just reported a mere 5 cents eps. Would have been 7 cents except that
they now own a money-losing free ISP service. That's dumb. Why don't they focus

My only respond to D's top 20 brokerages is that NITE really isn't a brokerage.
As far as I'm concerned they are more of a tech company or just a data
processing center. But as long as there is a need for a middle man, I'd expect
them to grow.

I understand there are a boat load of sellers trying to dump shares, hence the
big decrease in price recently. IMO the selling will stop soon to let the price
rise to higher levels before more selling starts. My opinion about the selling
is that these insiders (EGRP & SWS) are trying to cash in to help fund
operations rather than any inside problems in the forecast for NITE.

I also wouldn't call NITE a screaming value, but this dip may give us an
opportunity to diversify into some industries not typically associated with
value. And honestly, there really aren't that many tech companies that can
boast about these kind of ratios, or profitability. And until the rest of the
market demands dividends from MSFT or CSCO, I'll feel comfortable in NITE. Plus
my better dividend stocks are in REIT's and tobacco.

I did buy a few shares yesterday at 28 1/2.

I am betting that doctors can be managed, but this doesn't seem to be a good
bet. I gave up today on VISNAE, which "provides medical and surgical eye care
at the Company's Centers." Took my lumps and have switched from
ophthalmologists to dentists. Maybe dental practices can be managed
successfully by a public company. But I have my doubts.

I originally bought DENT as an arb. play. But the deal (@9 1/2) with Leonard
Green Partners fell through about May 4.(Financing, it was said); the stock has
declined now to near a 52 week low ($3+). I've added to my position today based
on yesterday's good revenue and EBITA announcement. About DENT: "With net
patient revenues under management of approximately $300 million and 226
locations in 14 states, InterDent is the largest provider of dental management
services in the US." One the one hand, there's what I would assume to be an
objective valuation of the co (9 1/2) by a respected (I believe) buyout firm.
OTOH, there's what seems (to me) to be a trend of these
we'll-buy-your-practice-for-stock/cash-and-come-work-for-us consolidators
growing and growing until they blow up. But IF there's a valid business model
here (-g- or if the blowup doesn't occur for a couple of more years), and if
there's some decent execution now, then DENT at 3 1/2 represents an okay buy,
imo, for diversified accounts.

practitioners are better than he is.

Also adding to my small position in specialty finance company, American Capital

markets and who might also take a stock/option kicker in the deal. Although
ACAS has shown good performance (dividends, NOI, etc.) it has a very short
history as a public company and is limited by its small capitalization. While
the dividend currently provides some downside protection, the entire sector may
be in difficulty. (ref: recent 'crash' in Finova (FNV)). In short, there's Risk

Looks like my cold streak might be ending. A few ideas that are working and
still look like buys even up 50% from where I bought them 6 months ago. Crane
Corp. (CR) is up to 29, but still looks like a buy on pull-backs. And Blair
(BL) now 19 1/2 up from my buy price in December of 13-15 is still a net-net,
but now one with rapidly improving earnings. Clayton broke through 10 for the
first time since September. While I think it is still a long-term buy at that
level, I would not be buying it here - I think it tests lows once again before
a recovery. The business is still getting worse.

And a loser - GTSI has gone below my buy price after looking good initially,
and I will be adding if it goes any lower. I bought half a position the first
shot at 2 3/4. A net-net with earnings. And another loser - I still hold my
miserable shares of USEC. Is that a buy at 2-3 times free cash flow? I don't
know another stock that trades at less than three times free cash flow, but I
don't have the guts after being so wrong.

Another point on GTSI - one I missed before. The stock ran up to 10 when it
became a "Linux play" in January - I sold that rally for a double and now I'm
back in at a lower price than I had bought at before. That run had two
consequences. First it brought in a lot of dumb money who now is selling the
stock to me at crazy prices. What I missed was that it also brought in a lot of
shorts who (if the Yahoo thread is to be believed) are still there. A net-net
with a large short interest is a dream come true. Now I know who I will sell
to. I will definitely be adding to this.

Jim, yes, some very good moves with some of your picks.

We couldn't have lost on Blair (BL)-g-. After all, there was that magic number
three -- 3 people to post that they had bought (You and Grommit, and me on
11/17/99. But I really took way too few shares (even for me, whose exploratory
positions are usually much larger).

I have been buying CMH from 11 3/8 last June on down to 8. Still holding. I
expect this one will take a while to work out. CMH gives me the impression that
when they come back from adversity (and they will come back), they will be
stronger than ever. (Well, it's only an impression--not that I can predict
accurately/adequately.)

I notice a number of the homebuilder (stick-built housing) stocks are up. I
still have a couple that've moved a bit too. I see DR Horton (DHI) is up maybe
30% from where I believe it might have been discussed here. Congrats to all
longs -- there were at least 3 people here posting on that one too, if I
recall. Sorry I'm not in that stock.

I'll go back and look at net-net GTSI. I haven't followed it since you reported
the "Linux play".

I still have USEC (USU)from Jan. 26 @ 5 7/8 where I agreed with you that it
looked like a bottom. Twas not to be, as they subsequently announced they
foresaw a difficult (read: bleak) future.

I also see that a couple of REIT recommendations you've made have gone up quite
a bit too since January. Colonial Properties and the outlet mall you liked
(name escapes me now). Beat my idea (purchase) of Mills (MLS). And so did
Warren Buffett's (or one of his people's) pick of outlet mall Tanger (SKT)).
(Aside: MLS has just opened its Opry Mills in Nashville with Gaylord
Entertainment. I'm looking at Gaylord (GET)which is at new lows and below
stated book value. Looks like a difficult company to understand/follow. Anyone
got an opinion on it?)

Jim, your mother should be happy that Bristol Myers (BMY) is up about 10% (as
of today anyway) and in a very short time since you posted you had bought for
her account (if I remember the post correctly). I had considered adding at the
drop (50) also, but it's already in all but one of my portfolios, and in one
the position is substantial. Too risky for me to add more. (Or I'm too cowardly
- or was too frozen with shock at the sharp drop from 65.)

My portfolios are down quite a bit from their highs of the past couple of
months. I attribute this to too large a technology component and my failure of
not taking more off the table as stocks rose, compounded by adding to
technology positions on drops. Also, some arb positions went against me as
deals were called off because of financing problems (or so the news
announcements said). Plus some stocks were sold to clean up portfolios,
increase cash, make other investments. Well, that's very often a mistake, and
it was for me with SLOT (sold at 37, now 42), JACO (10, now 15), USW (68-70,
now 75)

Among larger or well-known stocks that've been discussed here but don't seem to
have much thread interest, I still have Dana (DCN) , Dura Auto (DRRA), Trinity
Industries (TRN), Federal Mogul (FMO), Federal Signal (FSS),Owens Corning
(OWC), Fleetwood (FLE), Genuine Parts (GPU), JC Penney (JCP), and various bank,
insurance, real estate (sold JOE)and REIT stocks. I'm maintaining a substantial
losing position in Budget Group (car/truck rental) (BD) and a lesser losing
position in Amerco (UHAL, to which I've added a bit at recent lows).

I see there've been some nice moves in some of your stock picks too, Grommit.

I don't like it when I see though that where we've both got the same stocks,
those are just the ones that haven't gone anywhere, while the one's I've passed
on that you've got seem to be the winners. I hate when that happens -g-.

I've bought California REITs, Calif. homebuilders, and Calif. real estate
companies based also on "the hot calif housing market". (And I continually pray
for very low Richter numbers -g-.) I figured the same hot areas for Boston and
NYC - REITs related thereto were discussed here. Sorry I did not buy the REITs
in those areas. (The dividends seemed too low compared to other REITS. My
effor. That way overlooked potential of cap. gains.) Many REITs seem like
they've moved up from when they were posted on. I have positions in SPF (which
also is my favorite homebuilder) and RYL (took some profits last summer) -
these we both own. But they don't seem to have had the performance of many your
other picks - UH (received a buyout offer), Toll and Pulte and MDC (yikes!
--look like nice moves since Feb.) I've been hemming and hawing on Kaufman
(KBH) for over a year - it hasn't moved too much off its lows -- maybe it's
time for me to relook at it once again. Centex (CTX) might be interesting -
because they also own/control a construction materials business, CXP, which I
occasionally look at. It's had a very nice move since Feb. (Aside, I like CX
(different from CXP) in the construction materials business and am looking to
add if it drops a little more.)

Hughes Supply (HUG) I find interesting because it's an old time Ben Graham
favorite (not necessarily recommended by Dr. Graham, but by his followers - in
the print media in the early '70's. Sometimes these stocks cycle up too far and
down too far (which happens in the homebuilding cycle). But sometimes some
stocks are picked as value stocks, picked as value stocks some more, and yet
nobody seems to make money on them. (Genesee Beer might be one. Hughes maybe---
just my impression. Somebody's making money buying/selling them, but it never
looks like it to me.)

I looked at AMWD and to me its price/book, psr were not attractive, so I
passed.

Like you, I hold Northwest Pipe (NWPX). For me, it is based on NWPX financial
numbers, its good performance in the past (now somewhat tarnished --as
reflected by the stock price), and my expectation that NWPX will get a decent
share of the funds state/fed governments will spend to upgrade our water
purification/delivery system.

Grommit re. q: "Quite a few of mine seem to tank a day after I buy them. Am I

-g- just kidding.

It's part of how value investing works imo. If it's not a 50/50 chance how the
stock trades right after we buy, then I'd guess the particular stock would
likely trade lower, since value investors often buy too soon or on a downward
trending cycle. Conversely, I believe momentum investors might expect that
right after they buy their stock should (continue to) trade up. Part of it too,
is selective perception-- tending to remember more the ones that didn't work,
that hurt us from the gitgo, more than remembering the ones that worked out.
OTOH, -g- part of it COULD be a Grommit cloud which just follows you around and
rains bad luck down upon you. (ala Joe Btifspk, an Al Capp/Lil Abner cartoon
character who always had this problem)

SVR keeps showing up on my screens. I believe it will work out okay, but it

That SVR/timeshare analysis is under the Articles section of my
http://www.valuestocks.net site, for anyone who keeps seeing SVR pop up on
their screens and is interested. Click on May 1999 Pick of the Month - I gave
it a guarded positive analysis with a lot of if's. Then it was trading around
7.5, and now it's in the 4's. I think we can blame the intricate (deceptive?)
finances, the poor repute of the industry ("everyone knows you lose money in
those seedy timeshare deals"), limited organic growth prospects ("if it's not
really growing, ignore it"), and that big fat majority ownership that makes it
unlikely any takeover would happen. Frankly, there have been other stocks that
look more attractive to me (possibly for the reasons above).

Paul, I absolutely agree. Part of value investing for most people is
experiencing that initial dip after the buy. In my style, I've analyzed when
this happens, and why. It appears that it nearly always happens when I haven't
let proper support develop under the stock at a given price. You asked a
question a bit back "Why does X keep making new lows." The answer is "Because
it keeps making new lows." I'd say 99 times out of 100 a new low will be
followed by another new low.

Lancaster Colony fundamentally looks great. I don't know about where you live,
but here Girard's and T. Marzetti's seem to be taking off. Looking at the
chart, it is plain as day that it is downtrending and just broke what support
it had to make new lows. Because the fundamentals looked so great, I bought in
anyway. And now I'm experiencing that initial dip. Happens nearly every time.
It seems there is a better way, but died-in-the-wool value investors won't
consider it.

That died-in-the-wool part of me, as much as it helps my fundamental analysis
of a security, not uncommonly makes me do irrational things with my capital
when it comes to the timing of the purchase.

Good investing,

Wallace, I'm one who's been considering DCX.

Started when my wife said forget about me getting one of those new Mercedes two

figured if I couldn't get the car, I could buy the stock.

And I'm still mulling it over. It's working out okay because the more I mull,
the cheaper DCX gets. -g-

Competition in the car business is so fierce apparently. Warren Buffett has
talked about it as being a bad business, as I recall. I've already got a bunch
of stocks of companies that supply the big three; they are selling for very
attractive prices - better than F, GM, DCX maybe - so that weighs on my
consideration of DCX. OTOH, DCX is trading at a two-year low, they are a global
brand, not likely to go out of business, and diversified (maybe this
diversification is a negative?)

I'm not one who's done well in considering the macro view, but there is some
interest by at least one analyst in DCX because the euro/dollar disparity
favors DCX who can earn $ in the US and bring them back and convert them to
euros where the bulk of the manufacturing/design money is spent (if I

Mike, more on making new lows. I'm not much good a figuring where proper
support should be, or is, for downtrodden stocks.

I prefer to just buy when I believe the value is there but lag into the
position on the assumption that the stock will continue to go lower. Two risks
are:

1. that the stock doesn't go lower, but reverses and I don't have much stock
(ala Blair), or

2. that the stock continues to fall, I continue to buy more, this process
repeats, and pretty soon I'm holding a big position in a company that's going
bankrupt or has some catastrophic news to report.

As Grommit suggests, there seem to be many good buys out there now, so what
I've lately been doing is not buying so frequently/so much on scale down, but
rather just trying to hold on and commit new funds to different
equally-attractive companies.
