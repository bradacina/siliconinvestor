Fixed income: I sold remaining MHR-C, keeping just MHR-D. Added to GST-A.

While waiting for debt ceiling resolution, I sold marginal / low conviction
positions in GPS, IACAF, RIMM, TRH, PBEGF, FRX. None of these stocks are
expensive, but I am not sure if I will buy the positions back. I also trimmed
UFPT and COPJF at the same time and with the same motive. I may rebuy shares in
UFPT after good Q2 results.

I sold TPCS, since it does not seem cheap at fully diluted basis.

Two stocks came through this year: IDCC ran up on Nortel patent portfolio
pricing and takeover speculation. I sold a substantial part of the shares. The
stock is overvalued based on earnings, but may end up acquired at higher price.
CSR - a Chinese RTO going private play - so far is going private and the
arbitrage margin has decreased to $.60-.70 per share. I sold a substantial part
of the shares and may sell remainder soon.

As market was dropping, I added to GLW, RE, ENTR and RGA. I may add to other
positions if market continues downward trajectory.

XOM is a somewhat better managed company but TOT is way cheaper. A few things
to consider:

1) TOT US presence is negligable compared to XOM US market. XOM has a large
domestic upstream sector that benefits from lower US taxes than almost anywhere
else in the world. This means that XOM will benefit somewhat more from rising
crude prices than TOT (most taxes are progressive due to royalty components.
This works the other way too, at lower crude prices TOT taxes and royalties
will go down much more so than XOM companywide. This means less earning
volatility for majors like TOT, E, RDS, compared to those companies with a
large US business like XOM, COP , CVX or even more so MRO, HES etc.

2) Don't compare US$ based YoY results with Euro based results (TOT) YoY. The
Euro has risen more than 10% YOY relative to the $. The Clownbuck makes US
companies with large international operations look good based on US$,
purchasing power would be another matter.

3) large dividend (5% yield)
4) Very low asset valuation:

the dynamics of their market have permanently changed for the better , which is
one of the reasons Lubrizol got bought out by BRK. Moreco still trades at a

To all:

Based on http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3047-nyse_volume.html , today
was the most active day of 2011 - volume was up to 7.5 billion shares. If you
look at the historic table on the left, August was never on the list of most
actives. I ask myself whether this is a correction or freefall? After days like
these I go back to the "Intelligent Investor" and the chapter "The Investor and
Market Fluctuations". The following quote I found interesting:"Never buy a
stock immediately after a substantial rise or sell one immediately after a
substantial drop."

IMO the market in the last few days went against this trend. Historically, the
probability has been on the side of the market going up before the weekend and
especially after sell offs, but none of us know whether this will be the case
tomorrow.

This brings me to the other quote from that same chapter: "Basically, price
fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They
provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to
sell wisely when they advance a great deal."

Good luck tomorrow. Chutzpah!

It looks like they booked some cash selling excess acreage (and some

in the $36/shares range with an average cost around the current level of
$26.00/share.

Company is throwing off around 7% in monthly distributions. I am going to hold
off on any new buys for now (their are better oil buys) but may add shares
around $22 so I can off set losses for my higher priced shares.

FWIW my positive E&P Basket turned negative yesterday and is off 14% (from

add shares so on the next move higher I can peel off higher priced shares.

Re: TC Pipelines LP (TCLP)

I really wanted to buy this one after you mentioned it. I can not believe it
touched $40.01/share this morning. I missed an excellent value buy as they have
little debt (for a pipeline company (LT Debt/Net Income 4.6x) generates a 7.5%
dividend when priced at $40.00/share and has an excellent intra state
distribution franchise for their pipeline. This and SEP should benefit from the
explosive growth in NG from the recent US domestic shale development.

I have a GTC order in and hopefully on the next dip down, I can pick up a few
shares.

My strategy has been to find some of these undervalued high yielding companies
& Funds (TPZ, GOV & SEP as example) where I am trading in my fully valued
preferred stock (MHR & FR) for these laggards. I can lock in close to the same
distribution yields and get a huge upside potential.

FWIW, I almost starting buying MDU below $20.00/share but am waiting for a few
more days/weeks as I may be able to grab some shares below $19.00/share. I
think Both the fall in Oil prices and the general market sell off is getting

AHT. Strange days. Brings back memories from 2 yrs ago. I've become fully
invested over the past few days. Some of it a little early. but some at the
very lows too. I sold some pref stocks to invest in other stocks that dropped.
One stock that took a great hit was AHT. Dropped 27% yesterday on earnings
announcement.

read this first:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/284800-ashford-hospitality-trust-ceo-discusses-
2-2011-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=yahoo

They had 2 non-cash expense items. that they subtracted to get AFFO. I think
those items were legit to ignore for AFFO. One was a pref stock div related to
redemption of series B-1 preferred. Not sure what it is, but clear that it was
a one time event. "Early in the quarter, we announced repurchase of
approximately 5.9 million shares of the Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock
from Security Capital Preferred growth. The remaining 1.4 million shares of the
Series B-1 were converted into the common shares. "

The other item was derivative loss. "Since the length of the swaps not match a
term of the underlying fixed rate debt for GAAP purposes the swap is not
considered as an effective hedge. The result of this is the changes in market
value of these instruments must run through our P&L each quarter as unrealized
gains or losses on derivative."

I've seen those gains/losses on int rate hedges explained away by others
because they zero out over the life of the derivative. Not sure about this one,
but in any case, the explanations provided on conf call notes are pretty crappy
and non existent in the press release. So maybe lack of explanations
contributed to the sell off.

Adjusted earnings were fine.

Adjusted FFO
Q2 $ 51,557
Q1 $ 33,742

Adjusted FFO per diluted share available to common shareholders
Q2 $ 0.66
Q1 $ 0.46

I bought 2 tons of it yesterday and today. Can anyone shed light on the
accounting and on my take of the situation.

Q: Hi, good morning. With the stock down quite a bit today and as I recall, you

Most preferred in Europe and also Brazil are just common stock without voting
rights but full liquididation participation. To compensate for the lack of
voting rights, they get a little bit higher dividend. Those "preferreds" have
nothing to do with US preferred stock which are like debt (fixed coupon).
The discounts for those Euorpean preferred have increased over the years, they
used to be more in the order of 10% but are often 20-30% nowadays. I believe
this is because foreign institutional buyers prefer common with voting rights.
The preferred only trade at the local exchanges which may be another reason why

Re: Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc. (AHT)

I have a few observations. First typical of a lot of these REITs they carry a
lot of leverage debt. In their case it's about 5:1 (equity/debt) which seems a
bit high for me. Of course their loans are collateralized by their Hotel assets
and if in general one considers them under valued that that is part of the
value proposition.

Another item that caught my attention are the two tranches of debt that need to
be rolled over :

From their conference call:"...Looking at upcoming debt maturities, the next
key date is December 2011, when a $203 million loan comes due followed by May
2012, when $167 million loan matures. We are continuing to negotiate with
several lenders and servicers on restructuring solutions and will pursue
actions we believe are most accretive to our shareholders...."

That's a total of $307M in the upcoming 10 months. Management was not too clear
about their strategy for this debt (issue a new preferred series), issue common
shares (probable not share price too low) or refinance w/ senior loans.
Preferreds are paying 9% for capital which is at the high end.

<u>San Diego hotels feeling less financial distress</u>
http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/aug/03/san-diego-hotels-feeling-less-fi
ancial-distress/

Note: According to the article lenders rather renegotiate loans than foreclose.

From the article:"...the number of lender-owned hotels rose from 6 to 20,
although only one hotel -- the 141-room Lake San Marcos Resort -- was
foreclosed on during the second quarter, said Alan Reay, owner of Atlas
Hospitality.

Rather than foreclose on hotels whose owners have been unable to make payments
on mortgages financed when the economy was stronger and real estate values were
much higher, lenders have been more willing to re-work the loans or sell them,
Reay explained.

"In terms of distress, we're starting to see it taper off, and that’s because
of the improving economy," he said. "Also, a lot of lenders are choosing to
sell their hotel loans, and the buyers (of those loans) are either working out
new arrangements with the borrowers or offering a discount on the loan, and the
borrowers are paying them off.

"In still other cases, investors have come in and basically re-worked the loans
with the borrowers and taken them out of default."

Finally I am a bit skeptical of their " peer acquisition cost" of over $300K
they state in their conference call. "...We were able to obtain these 28 luxury
upper-upscale and upscale hotels for $158,000, per key, a 44% discounts
replacement cost.

This represents a 47% discount to recent peer acquisitions at an average of
over $300,000 per key. From an operational standpoint this portfolio continues
to demonstrate improved performance for those 11 hotels, the 28 in the
portfolio that are brand or third-party managed....".

They got a very good price per unit at $158K/unit but I think their peer
acquisition number is high at $300K. They probably got a pretty good deal
especially if they are "luxury" units located at a high end hotel property.

Bloomberg recently reported that hotel foreclosures were up significantly in
the last 6 months (at least in CA) and the average acquisition price was
$192K/unit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------

Lots of insider selling through automatic sales w/o any new buys. I guess
management receives a lot of stock (and/or options) as part of their
compensation.

Your conclusion regarding the non-cash expenses seem to appear correct; however
their interest rate swaps are deemed necessary because of their large amount of
debt and <u>is an expense incurred every time they change their debt
profile</u>, and the convertible preferred converted to common shares would
result in common share dilution too.

The conversion provision may have hosed one of their largest insiders SECURITY
CAPITAL PREFERRED GROWTH INC resulting in the assignment of common shares at an
average price of $11.80/share. Hopefully they sold all of these high price
share shares in May-Aug.

Based on today's closing price of $8.14/share, there s/b enough of a floor
value to offer downside protection with a possible upside back to $11.80/share
where SECURITY CAPITAL PREFERRED GROWTH INC was assigned their shares in May
2011 (just under 2M shares) OR $12.50/share where the company priced their
recent public offering of 7 million shares June 2011.

Therefore, the upside could provide for a 45% -55% gain if the stock just gets
back to these recent levels. That's a pretty good risk/reward and the dividend
is a bonus.

Seems like you found a good value opportunity but watch the news closely on the
status of their debt refinancing. I suspect the lender(s) will come around and
restructure their current loan(s) providing for a longer term, ok interest
rates and new covenants providing for their payoff (or pay down to a set
loan/Value ratio) on the future sale of any of their properties.

>>That's a total of $307M in the upcoming 10 months. Management was not too
clear about their strategy for this debt (issue a new preferred series), issue
common shares (probable not share price too low) or refinance w/ senior loans.
Preferreds are paying 9% for capital which is at the high end.<<
Once you have to worry about debt maturities for this highly indebted REIT,
it's probably not much fun holding the stock any more. MY feel is that we are
on the verge of another credit dislocation - there is some of the same stuff
going on then in September 2008 (money market issues) that could spell serious
trouble,IMO.The US loosing the AAA credit rating falls along the same lines.
When things that were considered safe,all of a sudden seem vulnerable and the
folks on top helpless ( just watch Berlusconi if you want to see a real
helpless looking politician),people loose confidence and runs may develop that
can topple institutions.

I generally agree with you Clownbuck. I have been selling down my REIT
preferred shares booking my gains from when I purchased them in the 2009 debt
crash at a significant discount. I would rather hold the cash earning a
negative rate of return than riding down these shares back to my original cost
basis.

Any new equities I have been buying must follow my general LT debt guidelines
where annual net income must cover the long term debt w/i four years or less. I
also only buy equities that own hard assets like oil and/or own a franchise
that generate tons of free cash flow (ie pipe line companies w/ low debt)
and/or significantly undervalued companies w/ very low PE and selling below
book (definitely No financial companies).

I was lucky to sell my only top 10 holding in a financial community bank
(NYB)recently and I own only a stub position that has a very low cost basis. In
fact I have been a net seller of stocks since March 2011 building up my cash
reserves.

I do not anticipate the extreme credit implosion like we experienced in
2008/2009 but those companies that have not deleveraged their balance sheet
will be negatively impacted by higher interest rates and a slowing economy. I
do think there will be some unique opportunities to pick up some undervalued
assets as long as you have the cash and are willing to wait 18-24 months for
values to begin to move higher.

How do you see the S&P downgrade in the U.S. credit rating playing out Monday
and into the week/months ahead? Do you think Congress will get the message that
they need to do something more substantial on the budget?

After a brief negative reaction (this is the time you place your low ball GTC
Willy bids in), I expect the Fed to announce a new QE3 program that should
stabilize the markets. Eventually the survivors will be those company's will
little or no debt that deliver "must have" products or services (food falls
into that category). During the next several months/years, we will probably see
more bankruptcies, fire side asset sales and a forced deleveraging by Mr.
Market. Ironically, Treasuries will probably still be the save haven for idle
cash.

Last year I followed a merger between First Chester (old ticker:FCEC), which
was a bank in Chester County in PA (the most affluent area in the state), and
Tower Bancorp (TOBC). The agreement was designed so the price of FCEC would
depend on the balance of nonperforming loans, which struck me as brilliant.
Made a satisfactory profit on the merger and since TOBC has agreed to be
acquired by SUSQ for $28.69 cash or shares. TOBC is currently trading around

re Volkswagen - have you looked at MAN.DE. Volkswagen owns 55% and want's to
take over the whole company. MAN trades at around 68 Euro and is on track to
make 8 Euro this year. There is 2B$ in net debt on their balance sheet but this
is mostly due to their financing business (They provide financing to their
products). Take the away the financing related debt and the industrial business
itself is largely debt free.

MAN>DE stock price has retreated sharply during the latest swoon from almost
100 Euro to less than 68 Euro. I believe that Volkswagen will try to squeeze
out technique on MAN.DE to gain even more control (do a required bid below
market price to meet formal requirements which of course does not get any
shares tendered and then buy them up on the market over time) which should
reduce the float. I believe it's cheap and despite the squeeze technique, the
shareprice should improve due to open market purchases from Volwswagen.

Madharry, in past I generally had the brokerage reinvest distributions for my
bdc's. The brokerage firm calculates my cost basis this way: for the numerator,
the total cost for shares I bought. The distribution-amount shares I received
from reinvesting are valued at $0. This numerator is divided by the total
shares I hold--- i.e. shares I bought plus the share count from the reinvested
distributions.

For bdc FSC at this broker, I show I have a 12% gain for all shares bought and
distributions reinvested since my purchases. Purchases were begun 8/'09.

However at another brokerage firm wherein the past 12 months I began purchasing
FSC in much larger amounts than previously and not reinvesting the
distributions, it's easy for me to see that the stock drop has created a paper
loss much greater than the couple/three distributions I may have received.
Losses even if I include the dollar gains I show from the first broker.

>>Do you know if the non-voting would get the same consideration as the voting
in a merger?<<

Probably not. They would get the same participation in case of a liquidation
but in a merger it all depends on offering something that satisfies the common
and preferred shareholders.

I am not that current in German shareholders rights any more but I believe that
an acquirer cannot easily force you to tender your shares - you can just decide
to keep them. In this case (and if the acquirer owns a large percentage of
shares - 95%+ typically) a Beherrschungsvertrag ( Control contract) is put into
place where the acquirer runs the business and has rights to the cash flows but
the acquired companies still has somewhat of their own legal standing. This
comes also typically with a much larger dividend for the remaining
shareholders.

I believe this is what is currently in place with Audi (NSU.DE) which is
controlled by Volkswagen but the shares still trade in small volume in the
German stock exchange.

FWIW, the last tender off for MAN3.DE shares was at 59.9Euro and MAN.DE at 95
Euro.

Your commitment that until the deal closes, you will continue to manage the

Reviewing past posts (3/10) here on Citigroup. Stock is now back to about where
it was at that time:

http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=C+Interactive#symbol=c;range=2y;compare=;ind
cator=volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source= ;

Stock remains a black box to me. Several of the same analysts are still
bullish.

This time, assuming down market tomorrow (Dow futures are down 211) and
assuming I can buy C at about $31, I'll buy the black box and questionable
management and take on a few C shares. Maybe also JPM.

SI shows C has stated bv of $58.45/sh and tangible bv at $45.34

Some margin of safety with that. ... I hope.

I note C is, or was, one of Fairholme Fund's top ten holdings, fwiw.

Dick Bove likes C as well:
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/100-Cash-And-Trading-Below-twst-2506356098.html?x
0&.v=1

TWST: Who do you like best in the money center category and why?

Mr. Bove: The money center banks are not providing the type of operating
earnings improvements that investors want. They want to see operating earnings,
exclusive of loan loss reductions, improving. This is not likely for these
companies near term. What is evident is that these banks are selling below
their liquidation values in many cases.

Citigroup &#169; just screams at you, and it is my favorite stock by far. I
cannot see why a bank should sell at a discount to its net cash value, because
as I say its tangible book and its stated book value is 100% cash. If a bank is
selling at a discount to its net cash value, it strikes me that ultimately it's
going to get up to its net cash value if nothing else.

However, I think Citigroup has also got one of the better business models in
the industry. When John Reed was running the bank, he had dual theory. He
realized that the rest of the world was going to catch up to the United States
economically, and therefore, he wanted to be positioned to sell consumer
finance products to the rest of the world. Number two, he wanted to have the
leading position in banking technology in order to be the lowest-cost producer
in the industry.

Sandy Weill, ex-CEO, threw those theories out of the window. He also threw the
bank out of the window because it was bankrupt by 2008.

However, Vikram Pandit, current CEO, has put John Reed's concepts back in
place. They are the right concepts. This means that Citigroup is positioned
better, literally, than any other bank in the world.

There is no other bank in the world, not HSBC (HBC), not Banco Santander (STD),
not Barclays (BCS) or you name it. There is no other bank in the world which is
in as many countries as Citigroup is, doing business with as many people in
those countries as Citigroup does, with as many corporate clients that are
totally reliant on Citigroup. So if Citigroup sticks with Reed's core
philosophy, which is to do business with the growing affluent around the world
and do it with the best technology in banking in the world, then Citigroup will
be unstoppable. It will be unstoppable with the best balance sheet in
banking...

----

C though doesn't seem to me to be selling at what Mr. Bove says is a discount
to its net cash value.

Hi Paul -

Citibank is the only bank I still own (it's in the IRA w/ a much higher cost
basis) but just as you stated "it's a black box", I would never add more shares
until (1) it is split up into separate operating companies I can understand or
(2) at least the U.S. residential housing market stabilizes.

Here is a link to a post that gcrispin posted on the Fundamental Value
Investing thread today regarding BAC. I know BAC has significant exposure to
the bad loans they still hold but now the Gov (Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac) is
making them buy back loans they previously considered sold and off their books.
Apparently several more of these "put back" loans are going to further sour
they balance sheet.
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27549839

I still think the housing market needs to drop another 20% to clear out all of
the foreclosure inventory (including the shadow foreclosures) and according to
the article, BAC has figured in their loss estimate at most a 3% decline in
real estate prices. I found this quote from Morningstar that gcrispin posted to
be quite concerning:

"...For instance, the bank is estimating a 3% decline in home prices for 2011
and a 1% increase in 2012. For every percentage point it is off, the bank will
need to take more than $550 million of pretax losses just on pre-existing
problem loans and put-backs (and this figure does not include the greater
severity of losses on mortgages that are still performing at this point but may
go bad in the future). Additionally, we continue to wait for a foreclosure
settlement with the state attorneys general that could cost Bank of America
several billion dollars by our estimates...."

I am not sure of Citicorp's exposure to the mortgage industry but IMO BAC is
going to report a lot more losses before it is over. Citicorp has to be in the
same boat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are my top picks for tomorrow. AGL has made it back on my list. I like
their intrastate natural gas pipelines and distribution facilities when I
compare them to SEP & TCLP. My last buy was $35.00/share. Their LT Debt to
annual net income is about 50% higher than SEP or TCLP but still in the low
territory for a utility. Their PE and Forward PE is the lowest in the group at
13.07 and 11.65 respectively.

rCd9oLv7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTEydDA3OGxkBHBvcwMxMQRzZWMDeWZpVGFibGlzdARzbGsDZGV0YWlsZWQ

With Oil now below $84.00/barrel (Bloomberg shows $83.99 real time), I just
might have my chance at a few MHR shares below $5.00. My last sale on MHR was
in May at $5.50/share and I would like to buy these shares back.

Although the risk/reward probably does not match up to C I consider the
downside risk small especially when I factor in the quality of the assets I am
buying.

E-K_S - as much as I like the pipeline business, I don't see AGL as a bargain
right now. in my opinion it is mostly an utility and regulated as such, rather
than falling under the much more favorable FERC regulation for pipelines. For
an utility 8x EBITDA is an OK but not a great price, imo.

I do think it is time to start hunting for MLP shares. SEP (which is not as
expensive as I initially though, due to minority shares in several pipeline
operations) may be a good starting point. MLP's often are thinly traded and
when the market (and particular the credit markets) is whacky there is a chance
to get units for steep discounts. Of course these discounts can always get
steeper, as I found out Y2008.

Re: Kohlberg Capital Corporation (KCAP)

Wow! Good buy on KCAP. This is one that I never really looked at. They show a
pretty large dividend but I suspect it varies a lot based on the deals they
have in process. They may have a lot of value deals presented to them and based
on the current economic cycle may be finding several profitable opportunities.

Any other Value investors ever look at KACP. Any skeletons in their closet?

I will add it to my watch list.

Government Properties Income Trust (GOV)
Magnum Hunter Resources Corp. (MHR)

In for a few more shares of GOV. If their distribution is maintained it's
yielding over 8% now.

Upped my MHR shares by 150% buying back the shares I sold in May. What is
interesting is VOG is the only positive E&P on my screen. 2nd quarter earnings
to be released after the close today. Stock is acting as if it should be good.

Still waiting for MDU below $19.00. Missed my opportunity this AM.

I am a net seller today, selling things that should not be sold, but wanting
other things and cash.

Rearranging deck chairs:
Sold 1/2 CVX, all UNP and all COR (smaller positions), and some KMB.
Bought some 8+% pref shares, plus GOV (8%), DLR (5%), LXP (7%).
Paul, I also sold TOT, but got out on 7-21.
Only good news is that I sold early in the day and bought later in the day. :o(

Time to hunker down and see what tomorrow brings. I want to throw my computer
away and come back next week.

DLR is on my Buy list. I am looking at adding somewhere in the $50/share range
as my last buy was in the $60/share range. I was thinking about adding to COR
but like DLR better. Other than that, I have my eye on several of the pipeline
companies. Also w/ your and Paul's conviction on GOV, was my largest add. In
fact, at these levels I am buying GOV rather than some of the preferreds I
have. It's more liquid and I can sell covered calls when the prices are
attractive.

Thank's for the update as it provides me a better perspective of where some of
those value buys reside.

With the market down over 631 points (-5.52%) my portfolio heavy in Oil is down
over 7.47%. Used up all of my cash in the account with several fills at the
close.

Got fills in MDU, DLR and OME. Moved a big chunk of cash from the credit union
to the brokerage cash account so I should have funds to draw on at the open
tomorrow.

compared to the 1 year and 2 years numbers). Several of my 3 year charts are

EXCO Resources Inc. (XCO) off 8.5% to $12.67/share.

W. Ross is in at much higher levels probably around $14.00-$15.00/.. A Value

That’s up from the 9.8 percent that W.L. Ross & Company reported in

Volume is 4x the average and down back close to it's 52wk low. Three year 2009

Stock looks like it is headed lower especially with NG below $4.00/MMBtu

> "This is as bad as I have ever seen. Cash is approx. 19%"

For a one day loss, maybe, but getting whupped day after day after day in late
2008 thru early 2009 was much worse.

The past week is just short term panic, and nobody can call the short term. The
long term issues are still here and that is the worry (slow grow economy, high
unemployment, uncontrolled health care spending, lack of reasonable tax
increases, and add global warming. population and water issues to that for some
real doom & gloom.)

That causes me to keep in hunker down mode, with 50% pref stocks (up from 45%
recently). My dividends are not going away. Reit dividends dropped in 2009 due
to shut off of property development income, and the freeze up of capital
markets also caused more conservative payment of dividends. But I think select
REIT divs are safe now.

You may be right with 19% cash, but the key isn't the percentage, its the $
amount. And I think that the $ amount of cash reserves that you should have,
depends on how secure your alt sources of income are, and how much canned food
that you have under your house. ;o) But if you are trying to time the market,
your cash level could be anything.

cash 2.3%
pref stocks 50.1%
Utilities 10.6%
reits 29.7%
0ther stocks 7.2%
100.0%

Sorry to hear that. I had been hiding out in low PE stocks - for example
I own Momenta Pharamceuticals. It just went from a PE of 8 to a PE 3.92.
Makes absolutely no sense to sell at this price - even though it'll head lower
along with all the rest of the stocks.

These past two weeks are as bad as I can remember.

Here's to survival to see better days.

KUDOS TO YOU FOR ADMITTING YOUR PAIN THAT MANY OTHERS ARE PRETENDING DO NOT
EXIST.

I am trying hard to stock to the plan of reinvesting at lower prices since I
hold mostly high dividend stocks and hold them for the long run. These past few
weeks the loses have been painful, but I remember in 2009 buying some stocks
for the dividend like CAT and WHR, CERNER, etc., and tossed them out for a few
points. This time I am sticking it out and believe that if our country goes
down, then I will have more to worry about than a portfolio. I can't compare to
2008 since I was in cash, but this time I am doing something different, and
those holding good, dividend paying stocks have done fine since 2008. Your
paycheck comes regardless of share price.

They say that dividends are a large percentage of market return over the long
run. Nothing says that louder than a 10 year, negative 5% return in the S&P.
