Doubled up on my initial tracking position.

From their most recent 10K ( http://biz.yahoo.com/e/110314/vog10-k.html
):"...We expect to drill approximately 6 net Bakken/Three Forks wells and 6 net
Niobrara wells in 2011 with drilling capital expenditures approximating $60.0
million. We currently expect to drill wells during 2011 at an average completed
cost of $7.0 million per Bakken/Three Fork well and $3.0 million per Niobara
well. Based on evolving conditions in the field, we expect to deploy
approximately $10 million towards further strategic acreage acquisitions during
2011. We expect to fund all 2011 commitments using cash-on-hand, which includes
proceeds from our February 2011 private placement, cash flow from operations
and the establishment of a credit facility...."

<u>Recent Equity Offering Complete February 2011</u>

Equity Offerings

"...On February 8, 2011, the Company completed a private placement to
accredited investors of 12,500,000 shares of common stock. The net proceeds
from this sale of common stock were approximately $46.6 million after deducting
underwriters discounts and estimated offering expenses. <u>The Company also
issued 6,250,000 of warrants to subscribers of the private placement
concurrently with the sale of shares. The warrants have an exercise price of
$7.10, and a five year term from the date of the closing.</u>The proceeds will
be used to pursue acquisition opportunities, develop our accelerated drilling
program in the Williston and Denver-Julesberg Basins and other working capital
purposes...."

----------------------------------------------------------

The company's drilling program for 2011 will significantly increase their
current production bringing 12 new net wells into production (about one per
month). Most of their production is oil (80% Oil in 2010 & over 90% in 2011).

The company has little debt ($14 Million or about $0.28/share)) but will see
12% common stock dilution when the 6.5 million warrants are exercised at
$7.10/share. I estimate there will be 52 million share outstanding when
warrants are included in the total.

They currently produce (as of 12/31/2010) 120 barrels of oil per day (on .75
net wells). By year end 2011 (w/ 12.74 net wells completed) I estimate they
will be producing 2,065 Bpd. 90% of that s/b oil. This occurring on only 20% of
their permitted acreage.

As new completed producing wells are announced through out the year, I expect
the stock to approach (and may even exceed) the $7.10/share exercise "warrant"
price, 40% higher from current levels.

Stock seems undervalued to me at current prices and I am a buyer below
$5.00/share especially when they have secured the $60 Million financing needed
to complete their 2011 drilling program.

I have been wrong many times and may be wrong again. A lot of this hinges on
VOG drilling successful producing wells (no dry holes), staying on budget and
running into no company or industry specific (ie. environmental) problems. Six
of their 2011 proposed new net well are in the Niobrara region which has shown
to produce very "Oily" high grade crude.

Hi dDye -

Perhaps my estimated guess for VOG's 2011 production is high by as much as
100%. According to the Blog article it is not unusual to see a 60% decrease in
the barrels of oil per day after the first year. I am not too sure if the
Niobrara region wells have a similar drop off in production but I would assume
there would be some "standard" amount.

The bigger question is in the out years does the company account accurately for
their well depletion allowance. In the case of VOG, they only have .74 net
wells producing so at this time it is not an issue. However in the longer term
total reserves could be overstated if accounted for incorrectly. Therefore, an
eye on management's reporting here is critical especially in light of how NOG
does their accounting.

As a side note, several years back I owned Royal Dutch Shell and over one
weekend they issued a press release where they cut their estimated reserves in
half which temporarily tanked the stock. It's not necessarily a company
specific phenomenon but calculating the reserve life of a well (or a region of
wells like Bakken Shale) is an in exact science.

Therefore, my biggest take away is to take note of management, their
relationship with NOG and continue to watch the well depletion numbers reported
after the first year of production. If indeed NOG has been more aggressive in
their depletion accounting I am sure the market will eventually figure it out.
It could pose a red flag for VOG.

A bigger concern is if the smaller E&P players typically take such an
aggressive approach to accounting for their well(s) depletion allowance over
the larger more established E&P companies. I am no expert but these are
unexpected land mines that generally come with such investments.

Some oil is better than dry holes or water. Once you get by this, I guess you
have to make sure oil depletion allowances are accounted for fairly.

Pardon my cynicism, but it seems a little ironic that as I was checking out
NOG's auditor Mantyla McReynolds, their latest news article addressed how a
controlling shareholder should properly give themselves a loan to make sure
they don't get in trouble. It is talking about wholly owned corporations, so I
will give them that, but still, a little too close to home.
I apologize for getting a little off topic.

"However in the longer term total reserves could be overstated if accounted for

More on NOG & VOG and their family connections. Perhaps this is why both stocks
are selling off today. It looks like it is more than nefarious depletion
allowance accounting. Definitely some RED flags got raised today.

The first story on NOG in the series by The Street Sweeper is located here:

Under Surveillance
NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story
by Melissa Davis - 3/21/2011 7:36:42 PM
http://thestreetsweeper.org/undersurveillance.html

From the article"...In 2008, the year after NOG went public through the
reverse-merger process favored by shady microcap players, Polinsky and Geraci
dumped a combined $9 million worth of company stock – despite a so-called
“lockup agreement” restricting insider sales – before quietly fading from the
scene ahead of a damaging Barron’s report that delivered a powerful hit to the
company and its double-digit stock price. They never disappeared entirely,
however, with both men since resurfacing as named defendants in a 2010
shareholder lawsuit against NOG insiders (including its current executives and
their relatives) for alleged conflicts involving the creation of yet another
energy company – now known as Voyager Oil and Gas (AMEX: VOG) – that has
supplied a fresh source of stock and the opportunity to repeat the lucrative
NOG cycle all over again.

Michael L. Reger serves as the founding CEO of NOG, while his brother James
Russell “J.R.” Reger (who, together with his uncles, sold NOG some of its first
leases) fills the same post at younger VOG. The companies themselves look more
like clones than brothers, with NOG establishing the definitive genetic traits
– including some of the same nasty birthmarks – that’s essentially turned VOG
into its younger twin...".

<clip>
"...Meanwhile, records show, WSR has snagged VOG – a newer version of NOG
itself – as a paying client as well. Today, records show, WSR prominently
showcases VOG in both the “Focus List” and the “aggressive growth portfolio”
featured on the homepage of its website. WSR’s president now shows up as the
head of investor relations for VOG, too.

For the most part, records show, WSR’s other clients trade for less than $1 –
many for mere pennies – if in fact they continue to trade at all. As a result,
both NOG and VOG jump out from that crowd.

Following the path blazed by NOG after it first hit the market, VOG has fared
so well as a brand-new Bakken oil play that it managed to “up-list” from the
OTC Bulletin Board to the American Stock Exchange before it even celebrated its
first birthday as a publicly traded company. Like NOG before it, VOG also
enjoyed rapid triple-digit gains along the way. All told, VOG has rocketed
almost 250% -- soaring from $1.40 to $4.89 a share – since the company (a
former poker stock) set out to become the next NOG less than one short year
ago.

TheStreetSweeper called VOG seeking information for this story. After
TheStreetSweeper identified itself, however, the company’s CEO abruptly hung up
the telephone....".

WWE - You pretty much have to buy it for the yield at this price, since it does
not seem to be priced for appreciation. On the other hand, the stock has traded
substantially higher, so it's possible that it will run up again.

On the yield side, the company has enough cash to pay the divvy for two years
with zero operating cash flows. Assuming current cash flows from operations,
they can pay it for four years. There is zero debt on balance sheet. If you
think that the business is not going to deteriorate from here, it might be a
buy with expectation of dividend + some possible appreciation. Obviously, if
business is good, they could pay dividend much longer.

Also sold my Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc. (PCL) REIT Timber play for a small

Hi jimthurman -

Re: Penn Virginia Resource Partners(NYSE: PVR )
Magnum Hunter Resources Corpora (MHR-PD)

I peeled off 50% of my IRA PVR shares and put the proceeds into the MHR
preferred D 8% @ $50.00 par. This was in an IRA account and my plan is to
generate income. I left a few shares of PVR in the IRA and still hold a full
position of PVR in the taxable account.

The MHRpD 8% at $50 par makes their distribution monthly like their preferred
C. I hold both of these preferreds as well as the common shares. I expect the C
series to be called away in December so my buy today of the D series also acts
like a tracking position so I can watch how they trade (they have only been
available for two days) The series D shares issued 400K shares at a discounted
price of $47.00 (8.5% yield). Too bad I couldn't get in on the exclusive
offering but I was able to still buy them at a discount to PAR for
$49.30/share.

PVR like CNX have very good assets which I believe are still undervalued.
However, holding PVR in an IRA one could hit the UBTI limitations so it was
easier to move part of the position into the MHRpD (w/ a higher dividend) and
avoid any future tax issue.

Have you looked at Richmont Mines, Inc. Common Sto (AMEX: RIC ). Of the ones
that Jack Straw suggested, this one popped up. In their latest annual report
their average cost per oz is $808, they have no long term debt and not too many
shares outstanding.

They produced 68,123 ounces of gold in 2010. Company turns a profit.

His other pick Brigus Gold Corp Ordinary Share (AMEX: BRD ) on a first take
looked too commingled (from a merger last year), lots of debt and losses (due
to shut down of some mines) and w/o going thru their reports in more depth
didn't look that interesting to me.

I am not too sure what the value metric I need to look at but it seems that any
mine that is producing, should be able to turn a profit with gold at $1,438/oz.

What are two or three specific key metrics you look at? I like to see (1) the
average cost per oz of gold mined, (2) probable reserves available in all mines
owned and (3) little or no long term debt and/or small number of outstanding
shares.

I need to go back and search the thread and other SI sites for more candidates.

I think my main gold holding (AU) is too big. Over the last two years spot gold

When I was looking at stuff 3-4 years ago I was looking pretty much at what
other experts were saying about specific companies reviewing the information ,
trying to get a handle on management and the geologists to see if it made sense
to me. every year i try to go to the hard assets conference in new york and
talk with management and geologists and listen to their presentation.
after a few of years of this I really think that management is a necessary but
insufficient condition for success. I found that frequently when industry
insiders take a position it pays to follow. otherwise i think projections dont
necessarily mean a whole lot. it has been my experience that actual costs and
production can vary a whole lot from the projected numbers for whatever reason,
and that is why i would be very careful about buying into individual mines
unless either you or someone you trust has some confidence in the management. I

MCHB.OB - it was on sale so i could not resist and bought one share of MCHB.OB
(Mechanics Bank) for 12057$ knowing there are only 19,379 more. Earnings last
year were about 600$/share and the bank continues to pay out 85$/quarter in
dividend. NPA are fairly high (~3% of assets) but provisioning seems now
adequate since they boosted the loan loss reserves enough in 2010. it appears
that in the last quarter they turned the corner (they made (200$/share in Q4).
Book value increased to more than 15,000$/share.

The bank is a little stodgy but they have a decent website. Customer ratings
seem to be above average based ratings in yelp and such. They have a small
business focus and ahve grown their deposits.

Decent size (~290M$ in tangible equity and a ~3B$ balance sheet. Shares trade
per appointment only, please remember to put in order for 1 (or a few shares)
rather than the customary 100 share lot <g>.

The bank is located in Richmond, CA, so almost local to me (1h drive). I may
actually visit the annual share holder meeting if they invite me. Should be an
interesting bunch.

Ploni, no, I've no insights as to why Emerge has more revenue but less profits.
Could be because of the hedges; maybe could be the discrepancy between what
they get for heavy oil, which is at a discount to light oil.

As I calculate it, company is undervalued based on enterprise value to
production volumes. I'll continue to hold my shares. Stock today at $3.40.
Fwiw, my notes show I have several small lots purchased between $3.14 and

MRO - over 85% of sales is still refining, which is IMHO very sucky business.
If you understand and value refining, then maybe MRO is a good fit for you. ;)

GLPW - interesting. However, note that their revenues in 2010 dropped and
income increased only due to cost cutting. Same for 2009 vs. 2008.

The service revenues are increasing while product revenues are dropping. Can
they continue to cut costs? Will revenues recover in 2011?
They expect service revenues to grow on nuclear power plant maintenance - this
is positive in light of Japan.
But they also expected revenues from new nuclear PP construction - this is
unlikely to happen.
Their gas turbine revenues may increase if gas powered PPs are built.
In 2010, two customers accounted for approximately 47% of our consolidated
revenues and approximately 24% of our backlog at the end of the year. - this
may be worrisome. Did backlog increase hugely or did the two customers just cut
50% of their orders?
I am also not happy that their OCF is much lower than reported earnings. This
is not a good sign in general.

Whilst we're on the topic of gold, found out something interesting coming out
of the Dodd-Frank Act re: "Conflict Minerals" (Section 1502). I've got some
interesting links here. The overview from KPMG seems to be a good start to
understand it anyway.

http://www.kpmg.com/US/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/conf
ict-minerals-overview-3-9-11.pdf

http://www.commodityonline.com/news/EU-to-pass-Dodd-Frank-like-mineral-oil-bill
37010-3-1.html

http://www.pcb007.com/pages/zone.cgi?a=74971

Per the KPMG slides "The Act's intent is to try and curb the violence and
exploitation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and neighbouring
countries by exposing companies that use minerals derived from this region
through disclosure and public pressure"

"Metals covered commonly referred to as 3TG. They are Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten
and Gold"

"A company will be impacted by this rule if:
- It files reports with SEC under the Exchange Act, and
- Conflict minerals are "necessary to the functionality or production" of its
products manufactured

Even companies that don't file with the SEC may need to conduct due diligence
on their supply chains, if they happen to be suppliers to impacted SEC filing
companies
these metals are widely used in several industries including Electronics and
Communications, Aerospace, Automotive, Jewelry,Health care devices, Diversified
Industrial Manufacturing"

"Final rule is expected to be adopted by the SEC by April 2011. First reporting
period is for fiscal year ending after April 15, 2012"

"Supply chain due diligence required by the Act:

Determine where 3TG metals are being used in products or processes at:
- in-house manufacturing
- Contract manufactures

Conduct supply chain due diligence, 3rd party verification, and in some cases
private sector audits on the sources of these metals - all the way down to mine
of origin.

Report out the findings of the due diligence on the company's annual SEC
filings and website"

IMHO, a bit over the top for my taste, though I can understand the reasonings
behind these provisions. The larger tech companies seem to have implemented
some things currently (such as Apple and Intel)...IMO this piece of legislation
will be particularly burdensome on the smaller companies...but I guess that
goes without saying

re Conflict minerals - yes it is a burden but not a large one really. I have
been involved somewhat on the fringes of this issue at work. Most domestic
suppliers need to meet the mandate so the smaller companies that buy from them
just need to get the assurance in writing. It's not that big of a deal.

The bigger deal is that it shuts of some supplies for some minerals from some
countries like Kongo which seems to push up prices further. I suspect that the
Chinese are going to buy the minerals from these countries and use them (after
all raw materials are fungible) and they make their way to the US consumer one
way of the other.

Hi Jurgis -

Re: SEYCHELLE ENVIRONMTL (SYEV.PK)

Yes got my stainless steel water bottles with patented water filter system
Friday last week. Items were packaged in plastic bubble wrap complete with my
online invoice receipt and a time dated tracking/packaging receipt. The
customer tracking/receipt information is one of the most sophisticated I have
seen so it appears their Web site fulfillment software systems are
state-of-the-art (once they actually process your order).

I am a little disappointed with the way the filter works. You much suck the
water through the filter (like with a straw) to make the filter work. I am
still testing but I am finding it difficult and end up "sucking air" most of
the time.

The concept sounds good and the filtered watered does taste very good but I am
not too enthusiastic with how it actually works. I received several so, I have
sent them to my friends and siblings for their review.

The company makes a plastic bottle w/ a different filter system which may work
better than the stainless steel ones I bought. ( http://www.seychelle.com/ )

No position in the stock yet. Not too sure they can sustain their 75% sales
growth based on my test results.

I do continue to use the bottle and keep it in the fridge when not actively
using (on hikes or in the car). So far, no longer use any more of the plastic
water bottles but lets see in another 90 days.

This is one I continue to watch and have it in my micro-cap watch list.

EKS,

Thanks for your review.

I looked at their website. Here are my thoughts. IMHO, the bottles are pricey
for disaster stricken 3rd world countries. The pump might be more economic
depending on how long it lasts and how much water it can process. Obviously
NGOs can decide to spend money on Seychelle products regardless of price (Jim
Rogers accuses them spending money on luxury SUVs, etc., so what's the price of
couple bottles?). I am also not an expert in post-disaster work, and I don't
know what alternatives exist and how much they cost. It's possible that
anything "Made in USA" has similarly high costs.

On the other hand, like you said, it's unlikely that the "domestic" market for
hikers/etc. will flourish unless they have a great experience with their
product.

Also still thinking. No position.

"...The commercial foods unit reported its revenue rose to $1.07 billion from
$996.1 million, helped by higher selling prices in its flour milling
operations. The segment also benefited from volume growth for its Lamb Weston
specialty potato products.

Rodkin said the division, which comprises 34 percent of ConAgra's total
third-quarter revenue, will concentrate on high-margin products such as sweet
potatoes...."
-----------------------------------------------------

The company is working on cutting costs including their supply chain expenses.
Not too sure they can do much more on shaving expenses in the future. PE is
coming down now around 12. Dividend is still pretty good at 4%.

I missed this one in the $21.00/share range (11/2010) and if I had it I would
probably continue to hold with a tight stop. Stock up almost 2% on earnings but
I fear if the company continues to pass on commodity price increases they may
impact their future revenue growth. High inflation could sink their ship.

It's probably a better sector to hold than the supermarkets (ie WMT or SVU).
Too bad I missed this one 10% lower.

With hesitation, adding BBY to my watch list. When it was bid up this morning,
I thought that was not the right reaction given the forward look, and the

It appears that the Sam's and Costcos are squeezing margins and/or causing lost
market share, especially in TVs.
Anecdotally, I went in to a local BBY and tried to dicker on price, as I would
be making a major purchase for an individual retail buyer - a high end kitchen
suite, high end W/D, and two flat screens. They wouldn't budge at all, and I
didn't feel like going the price match route. So, I bought the appliances from
local retailers at substantially lower prices, and will by the TVs most likely
at the local Costco.

RE: Refining...I don't pretend to understand it, but I know that it is a
valuable part of the process to refine crude oil and turn it into gasoline,
kerosene and napthta for example. Whilst researching on refining, found this
webpage, which gives a good argument about the value of refining companies, and
details what they call the 3-2-1 crack spread. Basically the larger the spread,
the more profit the refiner makes.

http://www.investingdaily.com/tes/17641/value-investing-the-case-for-oil-refini
g-stocks.html

One interesting fact is that MRO will spin off its refining business, and this
new company will be known as Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC) and the spin off
will be completed on 30 June 2011 (1 MPC share will be received for each 2 MRO
shares held). From what I've read, spin-offs are usually unprofitable parts of
the businesses, but are usually much smaller than the company that has spun it
off. Therefore, institutional investors will dump it like so much bad trash as
it does not fit into their investment guidelines. However, looking at the Q3
2010 numbers, the E&P side of MRO generated 2.53bn in revenue, and made about
510m profit. But the refining and marketing part of the business had revenue of
15.18bn (i.e. 85% of the MRO business as pointed out by you), and profit of
285m. So I don't know which stock would go down in price in this case. If it
was a good deal, was thinking of buying up some MPC stock but don't know now.

Another thing I picked up from that website was that the crack spreads tend to
be larger for lower grade crude oil. Sour and heavy oil, say, from compared to
the sweet and light variant from WTI. But only certain refineries are capable
of this (from MRO's 10K, they have 6 refineries, of which 5 can refine sweet
and sour crude oil). Refineries situated on the west coast tend to have better
spreads when compared to refineries in the east. Refineries situated on the
gulf coast and central USA do not do too badly also as there is a large reserve
of crude in Oklahoma which can be transported easily to these refineries.

One company that looks like good value is Tesoro Corp (TSO), a refiner that has
refineries situated primarily on the west coast.

There's still a lot of slack in refining. But North American crudes (WTI,
Canadian, Maya) are selling at a discount compared to the rest of the world
currently. This is allowing margins for U.S. refiners to be high currently, as
there are no cheap product imports to be had.

Valero tracks margins weekly and their data is very informative:
http://www.valero.com/InvestorRelations/Pages/IndustryFundamentals.aspx (click
on Key Commodity Prices and Differentials)

You can see recent prices for various crudes from around the world at EIA:

Refiners always look good when the crack spreads are high and they have a
handle on oil prices they pay. When spreads tighten or they have to buy rapidly
appreciating oil with no derivative protection, they are in the world of pain.
The margins on refining are very tight, so the companies go from making money
to losing money very fast. IMHO pure refiners are for traders only. Integrated
companies with some refining can be bought by long term investors if they
acknowledge that a large part of the company in terms of sales earns very small
returns in terms of income. Even then, it's not clear whether investor wins

I like the refinery sector. I posted on them here, and at one point I owned
shares in every publicly-traded refiner. In the early days nobody, or very few
on SI bought&held refiners. With selective memory (I forget things), it seems
like VLO turned out though to be about a 20+ bagger for me on some of the
shares I bought in '02 after I held them for a few years. Maybe more for HOC.
Maybe a 8-10 bagger for TSO. Late to the game with other adds, so much smaller
gains, and a few losses with the last buys I made in diversifying after all
stocks in the sector had risen.
==========
Sorry I've missed this last cycle. It seems it's always scary to buy these
things near the bottom. Hardly anybody's ever positive on the sector, and at
lows there's always predictions of either the companies going bankrupt or
foreign competition or something never letting them recover. The positive
mention is always -- and always irrelevant imo - that no new refiners have been
built in the USA for maybe 20-25 years.

My favorite in the sector was and is VLO. I am guessing VLO might be bought,
bought by me anyway, if I see price dropping below tangible book value. That's
where I came in before (8-9 years ago), and that's the point where I might be
interested again. SI shows tangible bv at about $26 vs. stock price of about
$28. For TSO, p/tbv = 1.23, so I prefer VLO. VLO also has a lower d/e ratio.

This all jmo, I've not been following the sector for a few years. (I believe I
tried a rentry speculative buy in '09, and I quickly concluded that I was on
the wrong side of the cycle. My premise being that there is a cycle, and not a
decimation of the industry -- many would disagree with me.)

You can have some confidence, but even the ones that seem clearly not the fraud

So if stock falls on accusations of fraud I don't know what to do. Sometimes I
buy. Sometimes I sell. Sometimes I trade, which may or may not work out. I

I know that you are against Chinese RTOs.

However, everything you say applies to any other company located in US. Well,
sure we don't need SAIC fillings translated, but can you really tell me that
you can be sure that EBIX is or is not a fraud? Will you go to the company and
check its factory - I mean its software - its accounting - its tax shelters -
its what else? And are you really sure that a hedge or mutual fund will?

If you don't like an example of EBIX, which has been accused of accounting
shenanigans, how about a "simple" company like TPCS or SYEV or MCHB that you
just bought. Can you REALLY be sure that they are not frauds? No SAIC
translation required. If you do, I really want to know how would you do it. And
would you really do it for your investments? Would your opinion change if some
anonymous poster on the internet claimed that MCHB is a fraud with some
half-baked evidence?

Or do you claim that we should not invest in market at all?

I actually think that Ebix is tricky because it's a rollup. Rollups are famous
for fudging accounting. I don't know if EBIX specifically has issues but I
would certainly look at it closely if I were to buy it.

You are correct that any company can be a fraud or at least mislead investors.
This is possible in the US, Europe, Asia. However I do not know a case where
it's easier to defraud investors than with Chinese RTO - the multilayered
holding structure Red flag), the fact that they are listed in one country (USA)
but operate in another (China), the fact that they are reverse takeovers (many
many examples of frauds with reverse takeovers, even before the Chinese variant
came out and then the recent track record of multiple exposures of fraud.

It is not easy to find another confluence of factors that makes it so likely to
get screwed over. But that is my opinion

Let's now take MCHB. In existence for 100 years, closely held. Pays dividend
and does not issue stock (nor stock option for that matter). I know the
branches, they really exist. They do not file SEC records but they file FDIC
records (they have to since they are bank). I know that the FDIC has teeth and
at least occasionally spotchecks the banks (based on numerous cases of banks
that had restructure their balance sheet) so there is an additional layer of
control there.

I looked at the balance sheet and it looks consistent with what I would expect
from a bank. Their business is mundane, no fancy stuff. I admit it is still
possible that MCHB management cooks the books or do not disclose the real
condition of their finances, but I am willing to be that the chances of this
happening are probably 50x less than with a Chinese RTO.

I take my chances but I don't play a game that is rigged.

Let's say it is 50x less than with Chinese RTO.

But you still admit that there is a chance that management could cook the
books. And you did not really go and count all the branches, check that the
mortgages on the branches are fine, check that the loans are not given to
chairman's nephews. You say "in existence for 100 years", but the CEO may have
decided that 100 years was enough and it's time to defraud you right NOW.

But let's say the supporting evidence you provided makes you believe with
enough confidence that the company is not fraudulent. (I am not sure you had
enough evidence BEFORE I asked the question, but let's not dwell on that now -
you got enough evidence AFTER I asked the question somehow. :))

Would you change your mind if anonymous poster on the internet claimed that
MCHBs CEO is in fact cooking the books and giving loans to his nephews to
siphon money from the bank? Let's assume the poster wrote a report on Seeking
Alpha and not a one sentence "MCHB iz a fraudz" on Yahoo. The report contains
no obvious idiotic statements or factual errors, but also bases fraud claims on
insinuations that are not easy to check (for example, it claims that the loans
given are to CEOs friends, which is difficult to check; or that the loan
reserves are too low because of a series assumptions that are also difficult to
check if they apply to MCHBs loans; the facts needed might not be publicly
accessible at all). What would you do in such situation? Sell? Hold? Buy more?
Visit branches? Count the chairs in them? Wait for SEC/FDIC to figure things
out?

I'm not kidding. I seriously want to know. :) Obviously, if you don't want to
engage in this what-if scenario, you don't have to. :)

re anonymous allegations. That is a difficult question and depends on the
circumstances. I would for example look up the posters histroy and see what he
posted in the same or other boards and how long he has been active. In many
cases, you get an idea about what sort of person this might be rather quickly.

For example, I would give more credence to a person that posts concise and
factual sounding stuff in a balanced way (positive and negative) than someone
who seems to be a shortseller.

I also would contact management, via email or possibly phone. I have done this
a few times with smaller companies and my experience is that if they care and
respond to shareholders, it's a clear positive, if they do not, it's at least a
yellow flag. I also like to find out what competitors think about a company -
sometimes they post comparison chart in their annual reports and such.
Sometimes there are other ways to find out what reputation a company has.

I would google up the top management names and see what I get. I would double
check the numbers available to me to find out if I overlooked something. In the
end, I would follow my instinct.

That is why I sold FSR - management says they are alright, Moody puts them on a
pot. downgrade watch (downgrade= very bad for reinsurer). I didn't like the way
they presented themselves in their annual report, although i have a hard time
pinpointing the issues - probably the risk mumbo jumbo and the stuff about many
the PhD's that they employ (many PhD=Red flag although I am a PhD myself) plus
their history if taking heavier hits than many peers relative to their size. My
gut says, sell it that is what I did.

Ebix Response to Stock Price Drop
BY Business Wire
— 8:20 PM ET 03/24/2011

ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ebix, Inc. (EBIX) a leading international supplier
of On-Demand software and E-commerce services to the insurance industry, today
stated that it had received calls from shareholders regarding the sudden drop
in the price of its common stock as quoted on NASDAQ. The Company stated that
it is not aware of any negative developments within the Company or in its
operations that would warrant in such a sudden drop in the price of its stock.

The Company also reiterates its policy of not responding to individual blogs
that speculate on the operations or future results of the Company.

The Company also refuted the random implications in a recent blog posted on
Seeking Alpha about the Company. The Company normally does not comment on blog
posts, but believes it is the author's intention to advance his interests, and
the interests of other investors that have taken a position adverse to the
long-term growth prospects of the company. It is management's opinion that this
post misrepresents and distorts facts not relevant to the Company's current
financial position, long-term growth prospects and management policies. To that
end, the Company reiterates its long term growth initiatives and expansion
opportunities, both domestically and internationally with an expanding
distribution channel and broadening a product offering.

The Company holds its directors, officers and employees to the highest ethical
standards in both its business operations, and in its efforts to achieve
long-term value for its shareholders. The Seeking Alpha post appears to have
been issued specifically to cause a decline in the Company’s stock price to
support the increase in the short interest in the Company stock, and purchases
of stock options related to these short positions. The company is considering
filing a formal complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission's
Division of Trading and Markets and Division of Enforcement, to report this
anonymous blog targeted at causing a decline in shareholder value. The Company
will take other appropriate action if needed to protect its business operations
and the reputation of its management team, board of directors, employees and
partners.

The Company also reminds investors about the Investor Conference on April 1,
2011:

The Ebix Investor Conference will take place from 8:00 am onwards at the NASDAQ
MarketSite&#174;, 4 Times Square, New York and will be attended by the Ebix
(EBIX) President and CEO Robin Raina along with many of Ebix’s top tier Senior
Managers including the Ebix CFO and Exchange senior management.

The agenda will be as follows-

company’s vision and operational plan
* 9am - 12 pm: Demonstration of various EbixExchange Services by the Ebix

gfre: I could be wrong but I believe this is a situation where there are no
buyers because of the fear and a motivated seller who had purchased up to 15%
of the shares at some bargain price and is now blowing out their shares. I
would also imagine that production has not been great in the current quarter
because of managements unwillingness to provide guidness or do a Q&A despite
being almost to the end of the quarter. however, at these prices assuming the
cash is real, which would shock me if it werent, the company now sells for
$3.80 net of cash and earned $1.50 last year. The company has also publicly
stated that pricing remains strong and they believe it will continue to be so.
so i speculate that on a worst case basis there is some production setback
which i hope is temporary. I could be wrong but I am certainly staying in the

Hi Madharry -

Repositioned some of my gold holdings. Sold 50% of my AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.
(AU) and bought positions in the Market Vectors&#174; Junior Gold Miners ETF
(GDXJ) and started a tracking position in Richmont Mines Inc. (RIC).

The value proposition is that as gold moves to new high, these small and
midsized junior miners will become profitable and more importantly own mines
with large reserves that become attractive for acquisition from the mega Cap
miners (like AU).

Therefore, my basket of junior miners are made up of from the GDXJ Index as
well as my own addition in RIC (w/ a small tracking position).

Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ)
http://www.vaneck.com/funds/GDXJ.aspx

The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners Index - The index tracks the overall
performance of foreign and domestic publicly traded companies of small- and
medium-capitalization that are involved primarily in the mining for gold and/or
silver.

This is a reallocation trade for me into a more diversified basket of Junior
mining stocks.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=AU&t=2y&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=gdxj%2Cric

FWIW - RIC is family owned and operated. The family still owns a substantial
stake of the company and have a vested interest to see their growth plans
achieved. The company is profitable and currently has 1 million ounces of gold
reserves and last year sold 70K ounces of gold. Their goal is to produce 200K
of Gold/year and maintain a 5x reserve base.

benefit from higher Gold prices (

If any other profitable junior miners make your watch list, please post. I

Hi Paul

As you recall in 2009 there was the merger of Aracruz and Votorantim to creates
Fibria - Fibria Celulose SA (FBR).

In late 2008, ARA got slaughtered with the $US/$Real currency exposure hedge
and basically was forced to do the merger or go BK.

With today's announcement on the rise in paper pulp prices, I decided to close
out my FBR position.

From the article:"...Portuguese pulp and paper company Altri (ALSS.LS) will
increase the price of its bleached eucalyptus Kraft pulp (BEKP) in Europe by
$30 per tonne from April 1, a company spokesman said on Tuesday....

--------------------------------------------------------

I plan to book my loss and revisit the position in 31 days. The stock has had a
good run from it's lows and I believe I can re-establish it once the market
digests higher pulp prices.

Longer term, there has been a consolidation in the Brazilian pulp producers and
this should eventually benefit the survivors. There is some rumors that our
infamous Brazilian Billionarre investor Eike Batista, may be looking for a
large acquisition in Brazil.

FBR and ULTR will now be my two horses for long term growth candidates located

The likely reason for GFRE's recent plunge is selling by HAP, an original
invested fund whose lock up expired earlier this month. GFRE is suing them for
recently selling too much, thus violating the lock up terms. GFRE is now below
tangible book and bromine is at an all-time high... go figure. GFRE's numbers
are clean as BDO just issued an unqualied report. Additionally, "scams" do not
engage big 4 accounting firms to improve their internal controls as GFRE has
done with Deloitte. GFRE's audit risk is low as the bulk of their balance sheet
is cash and recievables and given the environment and their subpar internal
controls, BDO had to "over-audit" their balance sheet. If there was a material
change in their business, GFRE would be obligated to inform the market. They
issued a minor clarification PR today with no mention of material changes which
in my book proves there haven't been any. By quarter's end tangible book should
approximate 6.00 per share with current earnings of 2.00 per share. I've been
averaging down and obviously am nervous given the massacre over the last few
weeks. Yet I cannot find any company specific reason for this other than the
HAP issue.
Incredibly pathetic what's happened with GFRE. Probably a "buy of lifetime" but
no guarantee.

re GFRE - the HAP issue, which has been ruminated upon in GFRE's yahoo board
and is a rumor only, does not explain much.

1) Why is this HAP seller which I suspect could be a considered an insider (or
at least someone with insight) sells at any price? Is this seller just stupid
or does he know something we don't.

2) Why does GFRE not follow up with their stockbuy back announced in Sept 2010.
They have 70M$ in cash according to their filing which is more than 1/3 of
GFRE's market cap. What the hell are they waiting for.

3) With all those Chinese RTO under the gun, why did management avoid a Q&A
session after their CC.

4) When I hear "buy of a lifetime" I usually turn around and run.

I watched the tape at the close. There was a persistent buyer at 5.5$ sucking
up a lot of shares. Either someone wanted them or someone wanted to avoid
another plunge at the close. Take your pick. One way or another, this should
come to a conclusion soon. It's either a 10$+ stock or a 0$ stock but it for
sure ain't worth 5.5$ <g>.

Hello Clownbuck,

I was in GFRE once before which I thought was going to be a long-term holding,
but turned into a short-term trade when it ran quickly from 8-10.

Anyways, at these levels, I'm very interested again and I'm considering
building a position, but no action taken again.

In regards to your general question about buybacks, I've noticed that it turns
out to be hard for small Chinese companies to really do an effective buyback
given 10b-18 volume restrictions. If the volume of a stock is low and there are
no block transactions, I think companies are pretty limited in how many shares
they can purchase. Volume is picking up though in the last month which might
make this easier if they were to look into it again.

I mean you never know about a companies financials, I agree. As a CPA and
Former Big 6 Auditor, my view is that there's not much that an auditor could do
to catch a fraud. But, I think that GFRE is doing a lot to try to prove to the
world that it's legit, by getting an internal control assessment and having
large auditors.

I mean, who knows about GFRE. The stock price is definitely going in the wrong
direction, but I think I'm willing to give it enough of the benefit of the
doubt at current prices to start another small tracking position.

Thanks,

Grant

I don't think there's a point to discuss GFRE or Chinese cos with you. You

They have 70M$ in cash according to their filing which is more than 1/3 of
GFRE's market cap. What the hell are they waiting for.

Perhaps they should not have announced the buyback.

I am not sure they can transfer money out of China for buyback. From what I
understand, transferring money out of the country is pretty difficult for
Chinese cos. They definitely have to get government's permission for dividends
in foreign currency, pretty sure they have to get permission for
outflow/conversion for something like stock buybacks too. And it's not clear
how much money they have on US side. That's where US listing is a drawback.
They could perhaps buy shares of someone who's selling in China in local
currency, but they would need to make a private deal for that.

Clownbuck/All:

I did some digging and please explain this too me:

How did Hap Trading Company, LLC manage to acquire 6.2 million shares in
January of this year at 0.13c per share ?
Why did they sell about 600,000 shares in February and again 600,000 in March ?
Has the company clarified its relationship with HAP, I mean after all, if they
acquired that many shares at essentially no cost, seems to me the company had a
hand in it ?

I noticed another one of HAP's holdings "FEED" another Chinese company they
seem to be selling and also which is going down.

Do you think HAP is selling for insiders ? This is very suspicious to me. After
having been burned on a couple of Chinese companies, I see absolutely nothing
but red flags.

"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

We are not a party to any legal proceedings other than the following.

The Company recently retained Loeb & Loeb LLP to act as litigation counsel in
connection with 5,250,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Shares”)
pledged as collateral for certain loans from War Chest Capital Multi-Strategy
Fund LLC, War Chest Capital Partners, LLC and/or a War Chest related entity
(collectively, “War Chest”) to Top King Group Limited (“Top King”), Billion
Gold Group Limited (“Billion Gold”), and Topgood International Limited
(“Topgood”) (collectively, the “Holders”).

In connection with the Amendment Agreement dated January 24, 2009 by and among
the Company, Shouguang City Haoyuan Chemical Company Limited (the “SCHC”),
China Finance, Inc., Shenzhen Hua Yin Guaranty and Investment Limited Liability
Corporation (the “Shenzhen Hua Yin”) and the Holders, the Company entered into
a Lock-up Agreement dated as of May 10, 2009 (the “Lock-up Agreement”) with the
Holders and the following shareholders of the Company: Ming Yang, the Company’s
Chairman, Wenxiang Yu, the wife of Mr. Yang, Zhi Yang, the son of Mr. Yang and
Ms. Yu and Shandong Haoyuan Industry Group Ltd., of which Mr. Yang is the
controlling shareholder, chief executive officer and a director (each a
“Shareholder” and collectively, the “Shareholders”).

Under the Lock-up Agreement, the Holders and Shareholders agreed that they have
not and will not sell in a public transaction on the Over the Counter Bulletin
Board or on a national stock exchange, as the case may be, any shares of the
Company’s common stock that the Holders and Shareholders presently own or may
acquire on or after May 10, 2009 (the “Lock-Up Shares”) during the period
commencing on May 10, 2009 and expiring on March 9, 2011 (the “Lock-up
Period”). However, each Holder and Shareholder has a right, solely in a private
transaction, to assign, trade, transfer, hypothecate, or pledge the Lock-Up
Shares, provided that in the case of a proposed private transaction by a
Holder: (i) the Holder complies with the provision of a right of first refusal;
and (ii) the transferee in such private transaction, agrees to enter into the
Lock-up Agreement prior to the Lock-Up Shares being transferred to them.

In addition, subject to compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act of
1933 (“Rule 144”), each Holder further agreed in each month of the next twelve
months following the Lock-up Period not to transfer shares of the Company’s
common stock in an amount greater than two percent (2%) of the total shares of
the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding in a public transaction, and
each Shareholder further agreed in each month of the next twelve months
following the Lock-up Period not to transfer shares of the Company’s common
stock in an amount greater than one percent (1%) of the total shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding of the Company.

In March of 2010, the Company’s legal counsel was contacted by the Holders’
legal counsel with a request that the Holders be allowed to pledge the Shares
to War Chest as part of a loan transaction (the “Loan”). On March 11, 2010, War
Chest’s legal counsel provided a letter confirming that War Chest agreed to
abide by the terms of the Lock-up Agreement with respect to the Shares. The
Company believes that on or about March 17, 2010 the Shares were transferred
from the name of the Holders to War Chest as collateral for the Loans.

Based on a Form 3 filed by HAP Trading, LLC (“HAP”) with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on November 10, 2010, the Company understood that,
at least as of that date, HAP held a European Call FLEX Option on the Shares
(“Option”). The Option permitted HAP to purchase a total of 5,730,000 shares of
Gulf Resources stock (representing approximately 15% of the total outstanding
shares of such stock) for $0.125 each. Based on discussions with War Chest’s
legal counsel, the Company was informed that War Chest had used the Shares to
create the Option.

After seeking—and not receiving—written assurances from War Chest that it did
not intend to violate the Lockup Agreement, the Company commenced a litigation
against War Chest and HAP by filing a Summons and Complaint in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, New York County, on January 20, 2011. The
Summons and Complaint alleges that the Shares are subject to the Lockup
Agreement and that War Chest and HAP are bound by the terms of the Lockup
Agreement. The lawsuit seeks a court order prohibiting the sale or transfer of
the Shares in violation of the Lockup Agreement, attorney’s fees, and other
relief.

On January 26, 2011, HAP filed a Form 4 with the SEC disclosing that it had
exercised the Option on February 21, 2011 and had taken possession of the
Shares. On February 15, 2011, HAP filed an additional Form 4/A disclosing that
it had sold 280,000 shares of Gulf Resources common stock on February 15, 2011
at $9.28 per share, and an additional 372,809 shares at $9.358 in “open market
stock sales during the period 01/26/2011 to 02/15/2011”. The form indicates
that as of February 15, 2011, HAP was beneficial owner of only 4,917,046 shares
of Gulf Resources common stock, and it also indicates that HAP has purchased an
additional Call Option to purchase 699,900 shares of Gulf Resources Common
stock at $10 per share, exercisable from February 15, 2011 through April 15,
2011. On February 14, 2011 HAP filed a Motion to Dismiss the Company’s
complaint as to HAP only. That Motion remains pending and is set for hearing on
March 15, 2011."

Agreed that the margins are very tight. Looking at the MRO 10K, the E&P portion
of the business had net profit margins of over 25%, but the refining business
had a net profit margin of just over 1%...but I kinda like refiners
though...not many people like them...guess its the contrarian (or rooting for
the underdog?) in me...

However, found this article on Seeking Alpha...makes for good reading in any
case...

Very impressive gains! I'm sure everyone would have loved to have gotten in on
them....IMO with oil prices unlikely to go down...there is still some scope to
invest in refineries...

I think if I were to invest in refineries now, VLO, TSO and DK appeal to
me..though I don't think it would ever be possible to repeat the kind of gains
you made earlier.

Will continue tracking them and see what happens

The crack spread depends on the spread between crude oil, heating oil and
gasoline. So if the rise in prices for the latter two outstrips the rise in
price for crude oil, in theory refiners will have increased their profit
margins

Let's hope so...but if this is anything similar to SOX, then you'll have
increased hours of work for auditing firms. I remember when SOX audits were the
rage, all material subsidiaries of U.S. listed companies required one.

Agreed with your opinion on the Chinese. Anything goes

The scary thought here is if the US government defaults or declares a
"moratorium" over financing of issued Treasuries...read in the "Ascent of
Money" by Niall Ferguson that this is what happened to Florence in the 16th
century...and Florence happened to be the most powerful city state in Italy at
that time!

Jurgis, maybe our own point of views doe not change but we may influence
others, which is in a way is the purpose of such a board.

I am interested in this situation (right now as an observer) because I think
some interesting investment opportunities will come out of this, I believe a
substantial part of the Chinese RTO will eventually be proven fraudulent but
that means there a some that will be legit do. if the market treats them all
the same and the legit ones go down, then there is money to be made here on the
long side.

The problem is that those RTO that I have the most confidence in like JST are
not much affected by the current malaise, so maybe the market does no who is
legit and who is not.

You may well be possible that the Chinese companies cannot do buybacks, because
the cash sits all at the operating subsidies and they cannot get it out to the
holding level. This is certainly true for dividends where RTO need to ask the
government for the right to pay dividends (note that JST does pay a smallish
dividend). That also begs the question why GFRE's management talked about
buybacks if indeed they are not able to execute them due to lack of cash at the
holding level. Doesn't make sense to talk about something that cannot be done
anyways unless they just want to get the stockprice up without doing anything
really.

Hmm, yeah, JST....

Earnings 13M for 2010. OCF 2M. Strike one.
Sales 144M, Earnings 13M for 2010. A/R 75M. Strike two.
Sales dropping, earnings dropping, valuation high. Strike two and a half.

But then it's not an RTO... wait, it's better, it's a British Virgin Islands
company, so it does not have to file any SEC forms except 20F. It's not a
fraud, because it does not need to file fraudulent forms. ;)

Sure, it might not be a fraud, but if that's the best you can suggest on the
positive side, you are probably better off not investing in Chinese small caps.
:)

maybe the market does no who is legit and who is not.

Yeah, you know market is efficient too. No point in picking stocks or
investing.
