Mike, re: >>what does it tell you when doctors are making excellent investors -
in droves? <<

Price of medical care will rise as physicians decide to leave the profession
and become professional investors. (-g-) It's simpler, easier, faster, and more
profitable to leave medicine and its hassles to become professional investors.
If I can overlay my own emotional makeup onto your physician friend, I would
say if my networth were quintupling in three weeks, I would find my daily work
to be an impediment to me. I'd likely be prescribing some tranqs for me too.

Very odd how this all turns out. For a person like me who's worked for many
years... to see such returns... so quickly achieved by using guts and
perseverance... I'm both in awe and also discouraged. Discouraged because it
seems to trivialize the nature of the work, save, invest cycle that I've
followed for so many years.

Perhaps a casino analogy might apply. If a new or inexperienced player comes up
to the dice table and picks up the dice and starts shooting number after number
(i.e. has win after win), I see the shooter look around the table and he sees
more and more money being bet. So he bets more too. Doesn't really know what
he's betting, just following the moves people around him are making, and
betting more and more. And having more and more chips pile up in front of him.
Telling the person about money management or the best bets on the dice table is
useless. (if there were even time to talk to the person). Whatever he does, he
wins. He has no fear. People are shouting and yelling and he is glazed: "What's
this? Where have I been all my life. Easiest money I have ever made. I'm in
heaven. It's going to last forever. I LOVE shooting dice." Starting with a
small amount of money, maybe $25 dollars, the shooter takes off the table, when
the roll finally ends, say $15,000 or $25,000 or more. Very excellent. But the
shooter has a problem he doesn't know about. (It's not taxes -g-) It's that he
will have much difficulty internalizing what his head knows. Which is, that a
roll of that length (number after number) happens RARELY. For the occasional
gambler himself, maybe once in a lifetime. To participate at the table when it
occurs for somebody else, maybe once a decade, if that. And so, our new
gambler, unless he is pretty internally balanced, he will come back to the
table - "easy money, do it once, do it again" -- again and again looking to
repeat that first experience. And fundamentals - conservative money management,
playing the best values -- those will forever take a backseat to the person's
knowledge that he was able to turn nothing into something big without all THAT
stuff, and he should be able to do it again. And of course, ignoring those two
variables (money management and value) now leads to rapid and excess losses.

Your physician friends have two issues then. When to sell (which for right now
is moot -- never sell, bet more!), and what to do with the funds when they are
sold. My belief is that such rapid accumulation of money by inexperienced
punters forever diminishes in their eyes, the value of patient, value
investing. But if they assume that they can replicate their current performance
in future years as was done in '99 either with the same methods with the same
stocks, or by finding different stocks, that is a mistake imo.

Some of this is my own cussing at myself for not being more gutsy and not being
a huge winning player at the table (too). Which is embarrassing to me since,
unlike most of you guys, I've been a player a lot longer. Some of it is the
craziness of the whole casino. For now, it's impossible to argue that value
counts. Alice - as in Wonderland - rules.

Just my opinion, I've been wrong many, many times, and compared to your
physician investor(s), it certainly looks as if I'm maintaining my record.

Mike's friend made half a million dollars in the last three weeks. You would
think I would have been hearing these stories over and over and over
again...not that I want to hear them. What makes me really think is that I have
not been hearing these stories personally until the last couple weeks.

Mike lives in Silicon Valley, so I'm sure he's heard it for a long time. But I
live outside Philadelphia. (But I work for an investment firm - my bosses are
all multimillionares who know people - you'd think the buzz would be going
around if it were real.) I find it very interesting that I started hearing
these stories with specific names (hey, I know this guy that made x on the
stock XYZ and is now worth half a million dollars) just a few weeks ago. And
just today I heard three more stories like that. (Some guy bought the best
house in the township off internet money). Honest to God, I had never heard a
specific "I know him" story until two weeks ago, and today I heard three.

Is that a peak?

I remain short QQQ and will double down if it goes much higher.

Jim, I overheard two conversations today. Both were about investing - one
involved the med center librarian, the other a janitor. Moreover, the friend I
describe with the half-mill is not the first overnight success story. As I
might've mentioned before, my two best friends and my younger brother's two
best friends all became multimillionaires this year. But you know, even though
I'm here in Silly Valley, I'm on the fringe - that same guy who made half a
mill went on a date with an HP IS employee who said it'd take 2 mill to buy her
house. When informed of his goal of 3-5 million in a few years, she scoffed and
said "That should last 2-3 years." Then she asked what doctors are making in
the Valley. He said "$100 to $120k." She actually sniffed.

Jim, I'm reversing my position on your QQQ short, although I'm not yet doing it
myself. Never, ever have I heard stock discussion permeate the medical center
like this. This is new to me in the last few weeks.

James, is QQQ something you can actually short like the American Exchange
Spiders, or do you have to play it with options? The wasting time value would
not appeal to me, but if there is a vehicle (symbol please) that you can hang
on to indefinitely I would be interested in hearing about it.

The real problem is that shorting QQQ won't do anything to protect
situations like Mike's friend with one stock up 5 times. However, it would be
useful in hedging a diversified NASDAQ portfolio.

A very, very close friend of mine whom I work with and talk with 6 hours a day
has in the last 3 weeks quintupled his net worth on a single stock.

I recently received this email:

<pre>Subject: Saint Corel
Date: Mon, 29 Nov 1999 22:23:38 -0500
From: "xxx xxx"
To: "Daniel Chisholm"

Happiness is having 5000 shares of Corel at $2.96. I
don't care if he goes to jail, I love him</pre>

(figures in Canadian dollars). The story is this: This guy, a good friend of
mine, struck up a conversation with me about stocks a year or so ago. I told
him that I mostly did shorting, was really smart, making a lot of money, and
the market was dangerous, dangerous, dangerous -- very overvalued, and I was
terrified at how all the people I know would be hurt by what I considered to be
inevitable. (See a recent post or two by me on this thread if you want an
update on how smart and profitable I am now ... :-(

He mentioned to me that he had bought Corel, and I told him that although I
hadn't shorted it, I had it under research as a possible short for a couple of
years at that point. I thought that it was run by a flake, was very unfocused,
might go out of business, etc. I sure didn't want a friend to get hurt buying a
stock that looked "cheap" because it was only two or three dollars per share,
and a former tech highflier, that "might come back" (a triumph of hope over
reason?). He understood what I was talking about, and appreciated my opinion. I
got the impression that he wasn't being foolish w.r.t. the size of his
position, was under no illusions, and realized that he was making an "I can
afford to lose it all, and might" bet.

Then on 29 Nov 99 I received the email above. And yesterday I was speaking to
him, and he is still holding, despite repeated calls from his broker to sell.
He's only turned $15K into $200K... ;-)

Our conversation finished up with him remarking (he's a very sensible sort of
guy, he's under no illusion that he's an investment genius) how amazing it was
that you make so much money "doing basically dick".

I told him that any time he needed more investment advice from me, be sure to
call... ;-)

So: "tick, tick, tick...."

I'd rather be long QQQ than short. My opinion being that most individual
investors are putting any excess monies into internet and or telecom related
stocks which I assume are well represented in the index. (Aside: I'm not
familiar with the exact make-up or weighing of the stocks within QQQ or how
frequently adds to, or subtracts from, are made by the keeper.) Maybe people
are putting all their available monies into these stocks. And, one way or
another, demanding and forcing mutual fund managers to shift funds to these
areas too. As individual stocks falter within the index, the slack will be
taken up by the winners who are able to hold investors' fancy - either by their
promise of technology, their stock market performance, or the deals and
alliances they undertake. Consequently, the QQQ average will rise.
The counterforce will come as supply of new issues continues to increase and so
diverts investors attention away from the stocks within QQQ. For example,
today's hot draw: Linux related stocks.

The losers will be conventional stocks. These will continue to drift lower. We
will be seeing more buyouts and buybacks by these companies. Which will come
from individuals and boards of directors who own the stocks putting pressure on
co. management to improve performance. But not so much pressure on these stocks
by other individuals who could buy the stocks, because these outsiders view the
'bargains', if they even are aware of the companies, as distasteful and totally
unthinkable for their investment dollars, regardless of price or value.

That's my speculative generalization anyway.

of properly selected stocks, enough will increase to provide a reasonable
profit. (My interpretation of Graham's work.) I'm just not sure about "properly
selected" (although I'm selecting a bunch -g-). And "reasonable profit" --
that's from a guy who came up investing through the depression - and I take it

so RBK may get another chance - IF mgmt. can manage properly. Maybe the much
touted B2B software companies could help their distribution. I'd guess shoe
retailers would like to see Reebok not go under since this would let NIKE
totally dominate them. Rockport Div of RBK could have imo, nice market niche.

My opinion: I don't think it's quite over for RBK. Starting a small position
today. I can easily see stock doubling within 12 months.
(Although it's true I don't see so clearly, and I've been wrong many, many

You guessed it. My friend's stock is Corel as well. His price target rises
every day. When it was at $6, he was targeting 9. Then at 9 it was 15. Then at
15 it was 30-50. Now it's 150-200. He keeps averaging up. Bought more today at
$42. Now his average price is around $13, and he's got a million dollars worth
of it. I stopped resenting him a couple days ago and am now just cheering him
on. I hope it goest to 150-200 for his sake.

BTW, another Silly Valley fairy tale:
A father has two sons aged 2 and 4. He buys equivalent amounts of one stock in
each kid's account. One got Corel at a very very low price. The other got
another stock that is up a little bit. Now the 2 year old is worth $300 grand.
The 4 year old $14 grand. The father? His biggest stress in life now is how
he'll ever explain to the four year old how unfair life can be.

Paul, with all due respect, I just don't get your buying of stocks as they make
new lows. Over and over and over I have watched stocks break new lows subtly
only to continue drastic sell-offs. If there's one thing that's kept me ahead
this year it's stepping aside of disasters by selling when a new low is made. I
don't wait for an uptrend. I just avoid buying new lows or when the stock is an
area where no support has ever been established. Don't know if it will continue
to work in the future, but to me there's a logical basis to this practice.

Goodyear Tire I did a paper short on after rejecting it as a value stock. Too
bad I didn't use real money. Who knows where it will stop. Stocks are like
swimmers - they dip their toes below the surface just before the dive.

Now Washington Mutual? It's testing a bottom right now but technically a toe
has been dipped in the water. We'll see. I can see it at a PE of 7-8 with a 6%

Mike, this reminds me a lot of the "go-go" days of the late 60's, when
minicomputer companies (Digital Equipment), computer leasing companies
(Leasco), conglomerates (Gulf & Western, Teledyne, Litton, Loews) and the
"Nifty 50" (Avon, Xerox, Polaroid) were all the rage -- but on a larger scale
because there is more money sloshing around now. Interestingly, the party did
not really end for years until 1973-74,
when many of the "names" were down 75% or more. Also interesting is the fact
that there was rampant speculation while the Dow did not run away. It was an
exciting time for a young guy like me then although it wasn't so easy to make
much money in the market on your modest savings, when good jobs for young
people were paying $10,000+.

Any other oldtimers around who see the similarities? If it is analogous and
this is like the peak year 1968 (I believe), we still might be quite a while
away from market calamity.

Mike, I advise you to suggest as strongly as possible that your friend
immediately take his cost out, so he is playing on the house's money.
It is a no-brainer that he is gambling and that is the sound strategy for
gambling when you get way ahead. Also if he makes the first sale,
the second may come easier, while he still has significant profits left.

Oh most definitely these stocks can and may go lower. Just looking at some of
my recent stock buys - ABS,JCP,NSI,FMO,BLOCA, J, LTV, TFX, NWLIA, NC, GPC
==whew! that's a lot==they are all down from my recent buy points and may
decline even further too. I don't foresee a "disaster" ala TYC with any of them
though-- there's really no crisis issues out there that I can see (but...who
knows?). Nevertheless, I certainly wouldn't be surprised to see money being
pulled from these stocks and they drift lower and lower.

We have different goals and styles possibly. I'm not trying to keep ahead this
year by avoiding stocks that continue to go lower. It makes no serious
difference to me if these stocks decline further. I would want(if I don't lose
confidence) to continue to add to positions as these stocks decline.
The positions I post on that I indicate are initial positions are often
exploratory -- small amounts that serve as an anchor point for me. (WM, for
example) All I can say is 2 years from now I expect (or have some belief or
hope)that every one of these stocks will be trading at least 50% higher from my
buy point (except maybe JCP where it might only just get back to my 1st buy
point). Generally, when I believe that about a stock, I buy. That's an entry
point for me.

You've made me consider an assumption I have with my portfolios. I do not
actually know what is powering them, and I see that I should. Especially given
that I am so diversified. I know from the Schedule D records I'm keeping that
the profits (realized gains) I am taking in 1999 are predominantly from stocks
bought in earlier years, 1996-1998. (This seems typical for me.) But I am just
assuming that the value stocks that I've bought in prior years are also fueling
the portfolios in this current year (the unrealized gains). Further, I am
overlaying that assumption on another assumption: that the important thing for
me is where these recent stocks picks will be in 1-2 years and not their
shorter term activity.

"Mr. Muhlenkamp, who manages the Muhlenkamp Fund and other assets, likes
Conseco Inc., a Carmel, Ind., insurance and financial-services company. The
company's return on equity is 15% and earnings are expected to grow at a 15%
annual rate, he says. However, at $19.50, down 68.75 cents, late yesterday on
the Big Board, the stock is trading at less than seven times next year's
projected earnings, he says. "It's cheap," he says."

IMO, it's a complex financial service/insurance company that has successfully
grown through acquisition and internal growth. At the behest of Wall Street,
CNC has adopted more conservative accounting measures, strengthened the
financial structure with the recent injection of capital and reduced its
dividend to strengthen the balance sheet and help it up its debt ratings.

Hi Paul, Bob, Armin,

I am back to say something dumb about Tyco again. I have not sold and admit to
be very surprised at that market reaction to what would otherwise merit
concern. The initial Tice report was NOT strongly worded and did NOT expose
anything that had not been discussed before. The reaction to that report, well,
it is one for the books. My first reaction...where there's smoke? It is now
known that Tice and/or his fund had short positions in Tyco established before
he published. In his response to the report Tyco CEO was unequivocal. He also
stated that he was inviting the SEC to investigate the circumstance surrounding
the reports release given the extreme reaction. The SEC has stated that this is
an informal inquiry (which of course may lead to a formal investigation) into
Tyco's accounting for acquisitions but also into Tice's trading practices
regarding Tyco. Given the reaction to the report I think the SEC is right to
look into it. Tyco is going to release their 10K soon which will be signed off
by three accounting firms. There is more discussion on the Tyco thread which I
had the pleasure of starting several years ago (So much for credibility).

Honestly, I don't know what to tell you. Does market action define the truth in
situations like these? Thus far I have not been convinced that there was
extreme wrongdoing. If there was then why didn't the author of the Tice report
find it? Why didn't the top tier accounting firms find it? Will the SEC feel
compelled to turn up something, anything, even if it is not illegal to justify
the inquiry? I have heard that given the complexities and subjectivity of
accounting practices that they could find something and if so then the market
reaction is likely to be near-lethal.

Because I have been holding for years I still hold a profit in Tyco and believe
that I am young enough to risk holding a bit longer. However, I am not adding
more because that would push me beyond my already frayed risk tolerance.

Compared to "earlier" ages, current days' corrections

AMZN falling from 100 to 40 in a week. And it looks

and couple other times during last two years.
I can bet you that in the next half-year there will
be a month when nobody will want any stock
for no reason. (And that won't be a crash either ;-))

Off topic, I was looking at the universe of tech stocks

Terrapin: Tyco - Tice stated yesterday that neither he nor his firm had short
positions in TYCO when the report was published nor currently, but I believe
you're correct that he was shocked that someone listened to the negative
comments..he's used to being ignored. I sold TYCO today at a modest [7.3%]
profit not bad for <1 day hold, [but could have been twice that if *&^%X&* TD
Waterhouse had been reasonably fast and reliable grumble, grumble].
My sale reflects the opinion that I'll probably be able to reenter the position
at significantly lower levels before the smoke clears on this and doesn't
reflect any concern that truly ugly, Cendant style accounting issues will be
revealed. TYCO's main 'sin' was making it's acquisitions look better by having
them book charges [big bath] prior to completion of acquisition, such that the
recovery, but not the charges, was reflected on TYCO's watch. This made growth
look stronger and gave impression TYCO really had a magic touch that boosted
earnings dramatically at acquired firms. Aggressive, yep...somewhat misleading,
given lack of clear disclosure, also yep, but not indicating that the
collection of businesses under TYCO's umbrella aren't capable of generating $2
- 2.50 in earnings in the next year and growing that at 10 - 14% or so going
forward. Cash flow confirms indicating the quality of earnings ain't that bad.
Based on current comparables, breakup is probably about $50. Unfortunately for
TYCO's holders, the accretive acquisition game is hampered by lower valued
'acquisition currency' in addition to ending the 'hot growth out of the gate'
game.
Until the SEC thing is cleared up and unhappy holders that thought they had a
HOT growth stock have bailed, I suspect multiple 'buying opportunities' will
present themselves.

Hmmm, it's difficult to say. I would say that some
(I don't know what percentage) had valid business models
and valid products. Of course, they were wildly overvalued
but they were not totally pump-and-dump penny stocks.
E.g. look at NETA. There were also competitive landscape
consequences - lots of networking stocks never regained
former glory after being CSCO'd, similarly
semi-equips (AMAT).

If I correctly perceive what you are getting at, it's
difficult to make a convincing case for the fall of the
leaders (CSCO, AMAT, INTC?, MSFT?), even though
they are overpriced. They do have a near-monopoly
position and can always seduce investors with fat
margins and growth rates extrapolated to eternity.
I would not include in this group any company that
is losing money.

CNH is alot more complicated than it looks, but think about this. Case traded
as low as 18. New Holland traded as low as 9. These are the old New Holland
shares, and New Holland bought Case for 55 in cash. Put two and two together
and you should conclude that the old bottom does not apply. There has been no
new equity, so the company now sits on over $5 billion of debt, with plans to
issue $2 billion in new equity. If they do that at anywhere close to this

Nicely put on CNH, Jim. It is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen done.
Prudent mgmt NEVER loads up a cyclical company with debt.
I had forgotten about the $2 billion new equity overhang. In a sense, the lower
the stock goes, the lower it goes. The lower the share price, either the less
the chance of an equity offering (which leaves
the company buried in interest charges that operating income can't cover) or
the more the dilution of existing holders if they do one anyway (a bottomless
convertible effect).

By the way, THIS is my idea of a near ideal short, not these overvalued
Internet stocks. It could have been shorted at $16 less than a month ago. The
fundamentals are known to everyone and were ruined by this merger for a long
time to come. They can't make money on the current debt load, and there is a
huge equity overhang protecting you against a big rise. A short at 16 would
have had a quantifiable and attractive risk/reward, whereas I maintain that
that

re: REITs

REITS are retesting their lows, and look really weak. Look at your calendar -
its near the end of tax loss selling and here we have a sector that is heavily
owned by retail investors, and which many retail investors bought right at the
peak two years ago. If anything is being sold for tax loss reasons, its REITs.

First point, and I think the reason Mike is asking this question at this time.
The sector broke its March low, which preceded a 20% rally, and is retesting
its October 1998 low. (I use RMS as my benchmark for the sector.) If we break
that October 1998 low, which we are right at now, then we've got a problem. My
thesis on REITs says that that shouldn't happen.

This is not just technical analysis. REITs have bottomed there twice for a very
good fundamental reason. That level is approximately a 20% discount to net
asset value. When hard assets like real estate, in an environment of real
estate guys who live to do deals, trade at a 20% discount to what they are
worth...things happen. In March we started to see takeovers and LBO plans. I
think that will happen again.

Now for what to do now. What I have done is put a substantial portion of my
retirement money in a diversified REIT mutual fund about a month ago. I am down
about 5%, but my next move would be to add to that position.

If you're looking for five securities, I would make sure one or two of them is
an institutional quality (i.e. market cap over 3 billion) REIT. Those will lead
the rally, because at the first sniff of a rally in the sector that is what the
big money will buy. My picks there are nothing fancy - the obvious names - EOP,
EQR, BXP. Be careful about Crescent.

I would be careful of hotels, where the fundamentals really do appear to be
deteriorating, and where the leverage (both financial leverage and operating
leverage) are much higher than other sectors of REITS.

For the other three names, I would go with CLP below 25, CCG around 30, and
Mike's pick of SNH anywhere near the current price of 12.

If asked for one pick, I would say SNH, though I would not guarantee it moves
with the REIT sector. This one may be a lone wolf. That is why, if you want to
play the REIT sector, make sure you have a position in the stocks that will
definitely move if and when the sector gets legs.

Paul: Mergers usually don't go nearly as smoothly as managements portray - in
fact research has shown that 2/3's are net losers for acquirer shareholders.
The forecasts don't call for ad economy to come roaring back, either, so there
should be 'buying opportunities' in CNH well below current levels within the
next 6 months. Single digits wouldn't be out of the question.

for consideration by this board-
Medicalogic, just went public (MDLI) with a $600 MM market value. Its revenues
might match that of Quality Systems' (O-QSII) micromed/clinitec division which
also has web based products. Yet MDLI is losing money hand over fist whereas
Micromed division and QSII is making money.

QSII today at $6/share is around book value/share with almost $3/share cash, NO
debt and profitable, with 6.6 mm shares out, qsii sports around $20-$25 mm
market value on BOTH PROFITABLE dental and micromed businesses COMBINED. (net
of the cash)

something is out of whack here.

QSII has very active large holders who recently forced mass improvement in
QSII's board, replacing 6 of 7 members, adopting what many consider the
strongest corp governance by-laws of any public company and most importantly
got the CEO founder to step down in an orderly manner. see my 13D filing at

CNH Review: Thanks James, Jeff and Bob.

I'm definitely NOT married to the ag cycle. Age of capital goods in ag sector
still may not drive this market as much as farm income in US and Europe. And
for the most part, that's very much a weather question, feed and food grains
inventories not withstanding. That's the demand side. But your comments on the
supply side (cost/financing) issues have me convinced. I'm out.

So with the value gurus united on this one, we'll see if it drifts into the
single digits. (I still like the idea of a CNH presence in China, but we'll see
if we can get back in again at a lower cost.)

I've had many of the stocks discussed here on my watch list and certainly find
it useful to review some of the fundamentals from time to time. With Mike just
asking again about REITs review, took the words right out of my mouth!

James, I have never paid much attention to the REIT discussion here, because I
generally don't think it is my style. However, I respect your expertise and
your learned posts on the subject. If you don't mind too much, I would
appreciate your repeating a few sentences as to why SNH would be your one pick,
and how secure the dividend is, as I am sure I could never find your prior
posts.

(I am thinking of putting together a position of a few of our value stocks
during this tax loss selling season, as sort of a package deal.)

Also, do you have any opinion on Polaroid?

SNH is not a simple story, so I just want to refer you back to previous
analysis. I don't know how to hyperlink previous posts - somebody e-mail me
privately when they're done laughing at my ignorance - you know how little time
I spend on the internet. :)

We had a discussion about it here about a month ago, but I would just refer you
to Mike's summary of the stock on his valuestocks.net site. That says it all. I
did the research from square one and came to roughly the same numbers he did
independently.

Be careful though - I never said the dividend was secure. I think I said
precisely the opposite.

Yes, I started a small position in PRD last week. For most people though, it's
a stock to bypass. Too many negatives. (-g-, Sorry.)

Management-- man, they really get criticized by everyone. They do well for
themselves it seems, yet the stockholders and employees suffer. No matter who's
running the business, the management team cannot deliver performance. An on
going problem for at least a decade. In addition to the Kodak and Fuji
conventional film war, Polaroid now of course has the digital camera boom to
contend with.

Here are three aspects of Polaroid which I am considering, or have considered:

1. They're really a technology company. The boom will be in their smart cards,
other things-- not instant film. (I'm still trying to understand if this is a
reasonable argument. I suspect they will be tied darn close to instant
photography.)

2. PRD's I-Zone Instant Pocket Camera is the Number 1 selling camera
in the USA. After only 2 months in the market, according to PRD's press
release. (This is one reason I bought the stock). PRD also claims the #2 and #3
"fastest selling" cameras. Counter argument: Data is for a short period of
time, nobody knows if the sales have "legs", and there is some question whether
sales - the camera, the film - will actually translate to bottom line profits.
Some people say it could very well be profitless. PRD has not ever been able to
produce another significant and profitable new product, I suspect.

3. In the four previous times in the past 14 years when PRD was at this level,
the stock rallied. I'm betting it will happen again. Counter argument: pretty
poor reason for buying the stock. Especially as the company may have been
stronger in earlier years.

I've said it before, but I think SNH is a lousy choice among REITs.

When the blue chips among REITs are trading at bargain-basement valuations,
there's simply no reason to go shopping for junk, and that's what SNH is.

A first rate REIT, like EQR WRI or KIM, nowadays yields about 8% and has a
growth rate of about 8%. Those add to give you an ROI of about 16%. The
dividend will assuredly not be cut.

A junk REIT, like SNH, has a dividend that might be higher than 16%, but it
will have a negative growth rate. That means that your ROI will be less than
the current yield. So you might end up with the same 16% ROI or even less. But
with more risk and volatility.

Why pay for risk and volatility when you don't have to?

Just because value investors sometimes have a mindset for bottom-fishing among
distressed securities doesn't mean that it's always the best thing to do. In
this case, the market has presented us with a better alternative.

Re: PRD. Been there, thunk that. Frustrating stock, enraging management, and a
crowd of whining ex-employees on every PRD message board in cyberspace.

Barring sale to G or EK, which I still think is a good idea for all concerned,
or, more remotely, a dramatic shift in vision within R&D, I personally don't
see PRD inching much over its recent trading range of $17-$31 or thereabouts.
Now, that's a nice range and I'm not knocking it, but with the landscape so
littered with screaming value buys I'd have a hard time choosing PRD over
others.

Good luck.

James, I can send it to you privately too, but I think that this is a "fair

In order to reference your message that I am responding to, I look at the URL
bar and see that the last part of the URL is "?msgid=12278198". This message
number is a unique number that SI uses for all posts, across all topics. (EDIT:
I notice, after posting this message, that it has been assigned message id
12279961 - so there have been 1762 messages posted on SI in between your
posting and this one of mine, in the ~10.5 hours overnight since you posted
yours)

In order to insert a link into the body of this message, I simply type "#",
then I type "reply-", followed by the message number. Personally I don't enjoy
typing eight digit numbers (and don't trust myself to not make a mistake!), so
I paste that in. Here goes:

James, your previous post is #reply-12278198.

(!!) -- All you do is just type in, as ordinary text, what you see underlined.
SI's "magic parser" apparently is smart enough to pick this strings out and
convert them into hyperlinks for ya. I also noticed that it has recently taken
to opening "external" (outside of SI) hyperlinks in a separate window.

You can also do a similar thing with "Subjects". The way to create a link to
this thread is to simply type this: #Subject-10036

How's that? ;-)
