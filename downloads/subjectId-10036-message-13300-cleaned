I'm surprised nobody is talking about Enron. It looks like my worst fears were

a better outcome than the executives deserve. I do not know much about Dynergy

Actually ENE has been mentioned by several on the thread. See post 13271 for my
take. I wouldn't bet the ranch on the Dynergy deal. There's no downside for
competitor Dynergy to look at the market leaders books and methods and meet top
people [prospective hires]. It gains stature by talking about buying, but in
the end may hold it's nose and walk away...waiting to buy the parts on Ebay.
OTOH if it does the deal, has it really bought a business that can generate
cash or has it just bought the mother of all shareholder lawsuits.

here's an idea

Nov Ibonds are now paying 4.4%, good for 6 months

you can buy them online using a credit card

you must hold them 6 months

so, if you use a rebate card of at least 1%, you can get 4% on each ibond
(purchased in Nov) for at least 9 months, or as little as 6 months if rates
should start to go up

(as follows: Nov ibond pays 4.4% rate for 6 months, your rebate card pays 1%
for the 3 months of interest you must give up if you sell before 30 years, net
effect: 3% over 9 month total holding period or, 4% annual yield)

Note that the yield on the Nov Ibond will be recalculated in
May, if inflation goes up, so will the Ibond rate, and vice versa, but you
don't care if it pays less for the 7th, 8th and 9th month because you have to
forfeit that anyway...

and if the rate goes up you can always hold longer..

my extreme value play is a beaten down nyse stock: HEALTHSOUTH Corporation
(HRC)

- HRC caught my attention b/c it was on Al Frank’s newsletter & his mutual
fund's #6 holding; which is good b/c his fund focuses on value has low turnover
of 30%

- HRC is I think the largest provider of outpatient surgery, outpatient
diagnostic and rehabilitative healthcare services - w/ revenues of $4+ bill a
year

- profits have always been unsteady due to expansion. But expansion has quieted
down. However, the earnings trend is good & getting better:

- '98: +.11
'99: - +.18
'00: .71
’01: -<.05>, .19, .20, .22 expected = +.56 - but the 1st qtr loss includes like
$139 mill of one-time losses

- more importantly, in the 10/25/01 press release, they projected increased
profits going forward of 15%: “is comfortable with fourth-quarter earnings per
share of 22 cents and sustained earnings per share growth of 15 percent”

- finally, with $3.6 bill in stockholders equity/400 mill shs o/s = $9 book
value. Stock at $12.20. Given its earnings, the stock is extremely cheap

HRC is facing implementation of Medicaire PPS [read price caps on services].
They've expressed optomism and it isn't expected to hurt them, but PPS
absolutely killed long term care sector [~5 out of 7 top national providers
went bankrupt as I recall] despite insider buying as they slid into the abyss.
I doubt this version is as draconian, but there's considerable uncertainty
about how it plays out. Merrill has them Neutral [Sell in analyst-speak] with
concerns expressed about this.
I'm not making a bear call on this, just giving you a heads up on what could be

Spekulatius, DNR. ELN.

I'll consider adding more DNR if price drops further.

I've added a bit to ELN today. While pharma stocks are almost never value
plays, ELN looks attractive based on its relative value. That's 'relative'
meant in comparing ELN to other large pharmaceutical stocks. (primarily current
and forward p/e)

Imo, buying stocks based on their relative value like this is very risky. A
margin of safety, if it exists, is with the absolute, not the relative.
Relative attractiveness is a dangerous seductress. Sometimes though, such buys
work. We shall see.

prepared with your bid, when it comes. Thats if you believe in HUF down the

piece of the cake. Huf is in a much stronger position balance sheet wise this

have to deal with a slowing economy as HUF does and have extra pressure from

The key issue with HRC is not valuation based on retrospective financials, it's
the impact of PPS on earnings down the road. Here's an excerpt from a research
report on legislation proposed to LIMIT the impact of PPS:
"CMS Offers Plan to Limit Cuts in Outpatient Pass-through Payments. The Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services has forwarded a plan to avoid massive cuts in
so-called pass-through Medicare payments for medical technologies delivered in
hospital outpatient departments, although congressional action is needed to
completely carry it out. According to the Advanced Medical Technology
Association, spending reductions in the pass-through payments, expected to be
as high as 80%, could be as little as 10% of a much smaller pool of funds if
the deal is approved by lawmakers."
Did 'avoid massive cuts' 'as high as 80%' jump out at you? As I said in my
message, I'm not saying this is a 'sell' just that ignoring what's ahead could
hurt cause the market doesn't care about prior earnings or cash flows, or the
multiples on those earnings...it's focused on the PPS impact because of the
destruction it brought to the long term care sector.

Ach, - I will try CNGR now. Discussed here before, I assume we all agree CNGR
is one cigar-butt stock. Dinky and with confusing and motley businesses.

Management says they are going to sell non-core stuff and focus on their
steadily- growing core business, and if they had, they say they would've earned
$1.16 a share this year.

No guarantee management can get rid of their other businesses now at expected
or desired prices. And the remaining business will be "used car sales and
financing" where less than conservative accounting (for potential defaults)
seems to have buried so many other companies.

Anybody buying now who can make money in this stock almost gets more than
he/she deserves, imo. After all, it means relying on
statements/outlooks/projections from CNGR management - who are car salespeople
and car finance people. Not occupational categories which inspire trust and
confidence, imo -g-.

But IF what CNGR says is true, somewhere along the line the stock will be
selling for more than p/e of 4 (based on that $1.16 proforma earning/sh
number.)

Paul Senior,
jmo, and I've been wrong many,many times

(No slur intended to hard-working people in this business. Just a little
skepticism when I envision those like-new "creampuffs" on the used car lots.)

My DIYH was up nicely today to a several year high.

From todays 10q..
"Subsequent to September 29, 2001, the Company entered into a Master Exclusive
Real Estate Agreement with a third-party, providing for the third-party to act
as the Company's exclusive auction agent. The auction agent will offer for sale
the Company-owned Warren, Tallmadge Avenue (Akron, Ohio), Medina, Arlington
Road (Akron, Ohio) and Ashtabula locations through a public auction.
Additionally, the auction agent has entered into similar auction contracts with
the landlords of the Company's leased Cleveland, North Randall and Eastlake
locations and will offer these properties for sale at the same auction in which
the Company-owned locations will be offered. The auction is to be held on
December 17, 2001. "

Looks like their results were somehow about 13.6 cents per share worse than I
anticipated.
Looks like they have about $1.474 per share in book value and about 61 cents in
cash.

The stock has came alive as if someone did not believe there was lots of value
previously. Now 97-$1.04 on 88,400 in volume. high has been 99 cents.

Spoke with the CEO. This is not a fire sale auction. There are minimums & such.
They are hopeful they can sell 2 or 3 properties from this. Said it would be a
miracle if they sold them all.
Holding open houses for interested parties to tour the stores.
They have sold 85-90% of the "steel" which I guess refers to the shelving.

He says he & john shields & the Chairman are convinced they are protecting the
assets the right way. Insiders have been restricted & unable to buy more.

He had no explanation for the volume & price increase in the stock today.

Mentioned a few people might be surprised at what is left when its all said &
done.

No investment banker has been hired and didnt really know what will happen on
that end.

I remain bullish here. The value is well in excess of 97 cents per share. I
still think $1.60-2.00 is where they may end up.

Time will tell.

Paul and the thread:
Any thoughts on SNDK now? I am considering putting on a position for the
following reasons:
1 - consumer confidence will improve with our apparent military successes, more
purchasing of products with the SanDisk label resulting.
2 - from what I understand, memory pricing is stabilizing and/or improving.
Whether it is flash memory, or memory of the kind produced by Micron, I'm not
certain (I did see 128 meg SNDK flash priced for $60 at Costco, which is pretty
soft, IMHO).
3 - Good financials.

Also, FWIW, purchased ALL last week @ $32.24. Reasons:
1 - Just off its 52 W low.
2 - yields more than money market.
3 - brand name company with leadership position in many of its markets.
4 - Insurance pricing is increasing virtually across the board post 9/11,
sometimes significantly, per my information.
5 - Claims from 9/11, which weren't huge, have already been paid. Additionally,
the hurricane season, which can really hurt insurers, has almost passed, with
almost no damage.
5 - Strong financially.

Also, any thoughts on the autos? Probably, my favorite one from a risk/reward

<<any thoughts on the autos? Probably, my favorite one from a risk/reward

concerned about a move away from large SUV's and luxury trucks that have
powered profitability. This would be a secular, rather than cyclical change
that is on the forefront of industry concerns. In an interview Ioccoca called
the lifecycle long in the tooth on these. The recent gas spike would be a

Here is a potentially interesting one. VCNT seems to have mistakenly put out

than the estimates on Yahoo, and the stock (though unprofitable) is selling at

Oops- stocks hitting new highs that I don't own:
Documenting some notes for myself:
Summarizing likely reasons I missed these:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ak+adm+bms+bne+wlhn+ckr+fo+gap+gtk+ikn+jnj+le+pii+
tk+tco+slm+low+jakk+urbn+road+safm+apog&d=t

AK, IKN, MIKE, URBN, WFMI : Too quick to take profit. AK sold just before
buyout offer was made; IKN still below book value. WFMI still looks absolutely
& relatively expensive to me - I stand by my sell decision 7-10 points ago.
MIKE now maybe 30 points higher from where I (wrongly??) figured it was fully
valued.

ADM, BMS, LE, CKR, JAKK APOG: would not step up for them when they came off
lows. Too anxious to get absolute low ---> missed larger move.

BNE, STK WLHN: I've missed each of these stocks at lows now about 5 times over
the past 25 years. My FUD keeps me out - no confidence that these companies
will come back -- they always have though. (Overlooked WLHN (now 19) at lows;
okay entry point could've again been 10 as in past years.)

JNJ, LE, SLM: All quality companies. Just FUD - I could not step in when they
were at lows.

PII, LOW, SLM, GTK JNJ: wrong analysis.
PLL wrongly figured new motorcycle costs would hold stock down. LOW - wrongly
figured HD would either cream company or keep LOW stock low. SLM: believed
media that gov't might end support; instead I should have followed professional
value investors who I saw were buying. Also GTK - could have bought after they
cleaned up their management issues - business franchise was still intact. JNJ -
one of the finest companies that continually increases earnings for about 100
years? - concern that it was overpriced at this year's lows was unwarranted)

ADM, GAP, TUES, TCO: missed focal point: For ADM focused wrongly on
self-serving (?) management instead of the dominant business. For GAP wrong
focus on lousy,small stores instead of potential for the stock to recover. For
Taubman (TCO) too focused on management- should have just gone with an
exploratory position when div. at about 10%. For TUES, too focused on my
position in competitor BLI to buy TUE at lows.

FO ROAD APOG: could not see value to price - even after companies mentioned
here and/or on Buffettology thread. APOG: Reviewed APOG several times esp.
around 6-8 (now 17)- relatively okay p/book but p/sales p/earnings did not look
so attractive. FUD - stopped me from catching falling knife in '00 when APOG
was selling at 3-5 and those ratios did look relatively attractive.

SAFM WLHN - slipped by me. Reviewed it at lows - I got distracted or else
decided to place money elsewhere.

Summary: regarding buying at lows: Looks like I need to focus more on where the
stock might be at full value, rather than how I might paperwork-lose if the
stock declines to retest lows or break below them. And I might do better if I
held less focus on a particular aspect of a company and more on its business
model (e.g. odds favored ADM at lows (?) -- pretty hard for ADM to fail - I
assume - even given its past/current management. Same maybe with GTK.

ridden it down from even much higher prices than that. Stock now seems fairly
valued to me. Maybe even overvalued. I see news from Comdex that camera sales

at current price.

I'm holding on to my small position in ALL. I keep considering adding here, but
I find other insurance co's at prices that look better to me. ALL is so strong
- in spite of questionable management - that in good times and imo, the stock

Adding to my losing position in SHRP. Starting TAM.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=shrp+tam&d=c&k=c1&t=5y&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

I discount the last 30 months of SHRP's higher stock price as related to the
scooter fad. Now though, the stock is near book value; book value is slowly
increasing; p/sales is .2; there's little ltd.
To get items into their stores (bricks and internet) not only does SHRP buy
ideas/products from around the world, they also have an in-house R&D group.
This group has come up with an apparently popular silent electric air filter,
and just recently a hot/cold snack box. It may be possible that one fad
product, or perhaps just several good-selling ones, in future can provide the
catalyst to drive this stock up from lows.

...............

With OPEC apparently losing control of oil prices and the resultant decline in
oil plays, I'll take an exploratory (-g- pun) position in TAM. This oil pipe
producer now sells under one times sales (2x in good years) and for 80% of book
value. Debt/eq. ratio is .14. TAM ought to be able to ride out the current
supply/demand problems, and if oil/gas prices rise as they have so many times
before, I am guessing there might be close to a double in the stock price.

Added to my alu holding. Kicker here is that credit line is at prime plus 1/2.
If recession lasts another 9 months I would not be surprized to see 12 month

Thanks Allen. I'll consider again if I want to add to my losing ALU position.
The stock remains way undervalued based on how I evaluate distributors.

I like that ALU are also a distributor of brand-name and generic
pharmaceuticals. I am assuming that at least some of this product goes through
the US mails, and I am hoping that ALU business here won't be ruined if/when
the post office installs equipment to irradiate (or whatever the correct word
is) mail to kill possible anthrax.

Looking for feedback on DIYH. (I worry that my judgement is clouded since I own
so much) Currently $1.01-1.15 with a large block crossing at $1.06 friday. I
still believe it has a LOT of upside. Comments please !

"Currently DIYH has a book value of $1.47 per share. Thats with their 5 owned
properties on the books for $14.525 million. Cost was $16.991 million. Doing
some figuring, I deducted 7% from that gross figure to account for 7% sales
commissions and then added 3%,5% & 7% annual appreciation for 6 years and then
subtracted 7% for sales commissions and the potential "gains" on real estate
owned run from 3.11 million to 5.27 million to 7.638 million for 3,5 & 7%
appreciation rates respectively. This equates to 42 to 72 to $1.05 per share.
Included in store closing costs liabilites is $2.33 million in future lease
payment provisions for ONE store where the lease term runs 6 more years. If
that store is sold or they get out of the lease some other way, they would get
much of that back as a gain. So, I would say at least $1.75 million or 24 cents
will likely be coming back to book value there.

So I see an ultimate book value ranging from $2.13 to $2.76 per share. All
costs have been accounted for except for costs relating to the owned stores
untill sold and dilution from stock options. So I will go with $2.00-2.60 as my
projection of what COULD be left depending on their stores appreciating 3-7%
per year for 6 years and them getting out of the one lease with 6 years
remaining for $578k or about a year and a half of the remaining term.

The shares are currently at $1.01-1.15 and a case could be made that they are
indeed STILL significantly undervalued.

I project an estimated $1.50 per share in cash after selling 2 of their 6
properties which could occur in the 4th quarter.

One wonders how urgent they will be in selling them. I mean, do you sell a
building you think might bring $5 million for $4 million just to get out of it
? Seems to me they need to decide what they are going to DO before they can
decide that.

But in a month and a half they could be sitting on CASH of $1.50+ as well as
having a lot of real estate left. As this becomes more widely known, the shares
will almost certainly continue to appreciate. "

DIYH: I don't have a dog in this fight, but you asked for feedback...Looks like
the key issue is what they get in liquidation vs book. I suspect inventory goes
for .20 on the $ or less after costs. Lumber in May June, when they announced
liquidation was peaking...now down a 1/3. What do inside players get out of the
end game [recall what Buffett said about poker games]. Property...a vacated
homequarters locally [Michigan] sat empty for about 3 years...it didn't have
lumber sheds [I don't know what DIYH's look like] and so was easier to
convert[ended up as Car showroom] and was in a very high traffic location.
Other vacated large home centers have also been slow to move [years not
months]. Lowe's and Home Depot's don't usually buy/lease these...they build to
get just what they want. My read is that even if it's got a lot going for it,
these pigs are tough to move...unless offered at 'market clearing' price...read
real cheap.
Paul has wisely cautioned several times on this thread about taking heavy
positions in microcaps. I've ignored that caution a time or two and been burned
for it.
I hope this one works out ok for you.

The inventory is gone. Nothing left but cash & real estate. Only liabilities
are already written off lease libilities & office overhead.(still on balance
sheet untill realized)

Auction being held next month should move one or two anyway.
That would bring cash up to $1.50 per share with more to come upon sale of the
remaining properties.

The several years of heavy repeat insider buying doesnt hurt either.

I continue to like microcaps. Especially deep value situations with insider
buying. Just not finding many of them.

Still around. Nice hold on GPC - I didn't have the patience to hang on and took
a quickie gain at 27 or so. Low 30s looks like its probably full value, and now
is the time to be selling safe stuff that the crowd has discovered and look
around at what they're dumping that might be safer than it looks.

Back in Saucony at roughly the same level we were buying at in 1998. I think I
got $4.55. In 1998 I paid 4 1/4, but then net-net was $7 plus $1 of real estate
and now its $9 plus $1 of real estate. Never thought that one would come back,
but somehow with patience they all do. At least the really crappy ones do.

I gave a speech last week and talked a lot about risk and what that means to a
value investor. It was really fun (in a sick vindictive way) to tell this
audience of performance chasers that two years ago "risk" meant not owning the
next Lucent...and today risk means owning the next Lucent.

RJM, any opinion on KARE? It's selling at depressed valuations.

From the recent 10q:

<Betker said that the Company is formulating a plan for an extensive corporate
consolidation to be implemented during 2002. The consolidation is being
designed to further improve operational efficiencies and reduce corporate
overhead. ``We are confident that the financial and operational benefits of
this program will be significant and will position us for much improved
performance during fiscal 2002. We hope to disclose the details and anticipated
results of this plan before the end of the year.''

Management reported that third quarter EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) results were below the levels required by the
Company's restated and amended credit agreement entered into on September 26,
2001. Consequently, the Company is not currently in compliance with the
covenants of its credit facility. Management said it is working to secure a
waiver from its senior lenders and will announce the results of those
discussions soon.>

Jim Clarke: nice seeing you post here again!

Several value stocks mentioned by you here have done very well if they were
bought when you mentioned them and then sold at higher prices or held until
now.

And, as you say, some that did become fully valued are now again at attractive
levels. As I've said before, I see that similar to the experience of
encountering old high school/college girlfriends years later - they sometimes
surprise you by coming back into your life and sometimes doubly so by being
more attractive and so much more available than when you first knew them. Ahh
yes! (if we were only single). Anyway... regarding stocks --
I have SCNYB also. I've taken some profits and added back later at lower levels
(but at higher prices than now) when SCNYB seemed to again qualify as a Graham
net-net. We'll see if it works out --- I'll try to hold on another two years.

And just for old time's sake, I'll mention MBI again. I'm still considering
starting a position again. I don't really want to step in now that the stock is
up from its recent past, but that could be quite a mistake perhaps.
MBI seems to be one of these kinds of stocks that the business just does so
well that its results overcome mistakes of investors like me. My buys have all
been profitable - yet I've both sold too soon and bought too early; My buy and
sell reasoning has been way off -- (they would be hurt from their California
utility exposure - they would be hurt from their WTC exposure or subsequent NYC
bond problem). Anyway, I've still got this one on my watch list.

EV/EBITDA ~6.1, But cash is very low, AR, while improving for last 4 quarters
is still nearly 20% above 6/30/00 quarter while sales have slid 15%. Meanwhile
inventory has soared 63% since that quarter. Wildly out of line with sales.
SG&A is up 25% since that quarter indicating lack of cost control. You can see
where cash flow is going and given the lack of cash this is troubling.
Microcaps typcially don't have easy access to credit markets.
Bottom line: It deserves to sell at depressed valuations and will probably sell
at even more depressed valuations in the near future...could easily go BK, in

In a prior post I hypothesized: a move away from large SUV's and luxury trucks
that have powered profitability. This would be a secular, rather than cyclical
change.
This NYT article indicates I'm probably off base: 'Made in America,' and Never
Mind the Gas Mileage
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/23/automobiles/23SUVS.html
Key point is US consumers continue to buy SUV's with no regard or understanding
of possible connection between mideast problems and oil dependence and no
concern over fuel economy. Having witnessed one gas-guzler to econemizer shift,
I prematurely thought we were entering a similar cycle phase. Not according to
the NYT.
[When I hypothesized about secular verses cyclical change above, I was
referring to a product cycle reflecting attitude changes that cut across
several business cycles as opposed to 'I might lose my job, so I'll hold off
buying a new SUV' type slowdown]

Five year anniversary here. What have we learned?

Here's from my perspective - and I don't claim to see it like anybody else
might. I'm also biased in some of my comments.

In no particular order - I am just rambling on Saturday am.

Posters went through a period where psr was considered as a key determinant for
value stock selection. Reference book was Ken Fisher's "Super Stocks".
Eventually this text was discarded as ineffective in picking stocks to buy -
although I believe psr was not so disparaged here for selecting sell points for
stocks already held. (The boom in tech stocks and dotcoms during the past few
years may have played a role in shunting aside the importance (if any) of psr.)

The importance and use of discounted cash flow or discounted earnings analysis
to the valuation process was commented upon by new and old value investors.
This method for selecting stocks was eventually discarded here. Somebody
started a separate thread for dcf, and it eventually died. There were two major
issues (I am giving my opinion here): the arbitrary nature for the values that
are the variables in the formula, and the difficulty posters had in selecting
actual stocks. (There were few or none mentioned. I can only recall the
brouhaha when a professor/financial advisor selected Microsoft here as being an
extremely undervalued Value Stock by his dcf analysis.) As one would expect,
with few dcf stocks to review to see how well the methodology worked over time,
and no dcf list of stocks from which to select, the dcf approach dropped from
this site.

There have also been discussions here about Buffett and value investing. Also
about how short selling fits or doesn't fit the value investing approach.

The cyclical nature of stocks became more apparent during the five years. Or
perhaps I am just posting or seeing more stocks that have had a rise (to fair
value) and then come back down to be undervalued choices again.

aside: Time to look at NTK again? It was post #1.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NTK&d=c&t=5y&l=on&z=b&q=l

I assume most of us now see the cyclical nature of tech stocks -- that was
something that value investors here saw in '96 - but it may have taken to 2000
before the tech boom turned.

There have been several discussions about diversification vs. concentration. I
will guess that more people here are now at least open to the importance of
diversity of investments (risk control) vs. their opinion in '96- '00 that
concentration was preferable (concentrate to maximize gains).
(Being a big believer in highly diversified portfolios, I cite now the Glassman
11/18 Washington Post article where a study indicates 50 stocks perhaps to deal
with the market's increased volatility - thats up from 15-25 or 30 one might
usually see from such studies -- and even 50 might not be enough for
reasonable-sized value investor portfolios, I am guessing.)

I note again the diversity of opinion on what constitutes a value stock or what
people here are willing to buy as "value". I'm surprised at how few of us will
buy the same stock. This year there have been 10 stocks named here for which 3
posters here each said that they bought the stock. (That number 10 is higher
than in previous years, I believe.)

I'm surprised how few of the early posters remain. Maybe they've just changed
their names -g-. Still, some people here have had notable success in their
investments (from what I can garner from posts over the years.) We have at
least one person starting his money management firm, one analyst becoming a
money manager, at least a couple of people exiting the daily grind to manage
their own funds full-time, one person who managed his funds full-time 5 years
ago who got big (well, able to buy blocks of 20,000 shares of a $60 stock.)

This thread never became popular in terms of number of posts. Only 13,000 posts
vs. Gorilla & King's 49,000 in less than 3 years or Befriend the Trend's 49,000
in 3 1/2 years. Once in a while though (on dull trading days ?), the Value
Thread hits the SI hot list. So there are likely a bunch of lurkers around.

Regarding quality, I don't know if the stocks mentioned here are better value
candidates now than were the stocks mentioned in prior years. It seems to me
the quality of posts here has declined though. In past, there were more
in-depth discussions of particular stocks; now there seem to be posts that only
say, "I bought x, and y, and z today."
Regarding quantity, I don't know if more stocks were mentioned in previous
years or more stocks are being mentioned now.

Five years ago it was harder for me to mention what I considered my favorite or
best or most promising ideas (not that these ideas ever worked out the best),
because I figured (wrongly) that people would glom on to them and push prices
up before I was sure I had purchased enough. I now realize that except for
micro microcaps, that's not at all a problem - either no one listens to me or
else so few people read the thread and among the few readers, there's not much
agreement anyway. This relates to the comment made by David Dreman when
interviewed for his Contrarian Investing book - he replied to the interviewer's
question that he felt so few people practiced value investing that publishing
his methods in his books would not popularize such methods and would not dry up
the supply of his potential investing candidates. So I'm saying, it's likely,
imo, that people who post their picks here won't be hurt by doing so, so please
keep those ideas coming.

We probably don't recognize posters very well, especially some of the
infrequent ones here who've done good work. It's one thing to see the people
who post a lot, who have lots of stock picks, and/or who post how some of those
stock picks turned out. There seem to be a number of people though who only
occasionally "slip in" a few stock selections, and in retrospect (like a year
or 18 months later), if we're alert or astute, we might see that those few did
remarkably well. I believe we should try to acknowledge those people better -
at least encourage them (and others) to continue posting their picks.
Everyone's work and ideas are necessary and appreciated even if recognition is
not explicitly stated. We've had the comment: "Hey, I gave some good stocks and
no one commented on them at all." Keep posting anyway, I say!

The thread has remained civil even during some heated arguments. We may have
lost a few good people. OTOH, sometimes conflict brought out people's best work
and ideas.

- pays about a 3 1/2% dividend

- they just issued $300 mill of 5.5% debt which means the rating agencies like

St. Joe Analysis:

I know, I know. Many are saying "not another real estate company with rates
bottoming...". But I still find the below review interesting.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=16698971ST .

JOE BACKGROUND

The St. Joe Company is a Florida-based real estate operating company (REOC),
which owns approximately one million acres of Florida land. The St. Joe Company
is the largest private landowner in the state of Florida. The one million acre
ownership represents three percent of Florida land space. The land is valued on
St. Joe’s balance sheet at 1930’s prices. The St. Joe Company participates in
land development, commercial sales, industrial development, hospitality
development, leisure and resort development, and real estate activities. St.
Joe management is focused upon developing/selling this land to maximize
shareholder value. St. Joe trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the
ticker JOE.

St. Joe owns Arvida Realty Services (ARS), which has a website at
http://www.arvidarealty.com . ARS has over 100 offices and 3,300 agents in the
Florida state. ARS is Florida’s largest independent full-service real estate
brokerage firm.

St. Joe’s website is http://www.joe.com . The stock is currently trading at
approximately $27 per share. There are approximately 79 million shares
currently outstanding. As of April 2001, the Alfred I. duPont Trust owned 60.8%
of the St. Joe common stock. As of September 30, 2001, the Alfred I. duPont
Trust owned approximately 57% of the St. Joe common stock.

St. Joe has taken steps to focus the company’s focus upon property development
and away from side businesses. These steps include the following: 1) St. Joe
sold their communication operation in April 1996, 2) St. Joe sold their
sugarcane operations in March 1999, and 3) St. Joe spun-off their railroad
operations, Florida East Coast Industries, in September 2000.

As a REOC, St. Joe is not financially leveraged and economically vulnerable to
the same degree as a real estate investment trust (REIT). A REOC typically
retains the majority of earnings whereas a REIT pays out 95% of earnings to
shareholders. A REOC therefore has an increased amount of financial flexibility
due to the existence of retained earnings vs. the payment of earnings as
dividends to shareholders. St. Joe is a real estate play. The key issue to keep
in mind is the fact that St. Joe is developing their properties into valuable
assets. St. Joe is creating property value by developing the surrounding
infrastructure surrounding St. Joe’s land development communities.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

St Joe’s financial results are quite impressive. The St. Joe Company announced
on October 17, 2001, that its third quarter 2001 Net EBITDA was $42.2 million,
or $0.50 per diluted share, compared with $42.4 million, or $0.49 per diluted
share, for the same quarter in 2000. These figures reflect St. Joe financial
results only, and do not include the spin-off of St. Joe's 54 percent equity
interest in Florida East Coast Industries, Inc. on October 9, 2000.

St. Joe pays an annual dividend of eight cents. St. Joe is expected to earn
eighty-five cents in fiscal year 2001 (ending December 31, 2001), and
ninety-five cents in fiscal year 2002. Assuming St. Joe trades at $27 and earns
ninety-five cents in fiscal year 2002, then the company is currently trading at
a P/E multiple of 28x. In my opinion, the P/E multiple is a side issue to the
potential land sales in the near future.

Return on equity (after deducting from equity goodwill created during the
spin-off), was 16.7% in 2000. Prior to the railroad spin-off, the ROE ranged
from 1.3% to 7.7% during the 1990’s.

St. Joe increased their NET EBITDA earnings of their real estate business by
127% over 1999. This was the fourth straight year of annual earnings increase.
St. Joe provided shareholders a total return of 34% in 2000.

ST. JOE’s VALUATION

St. Joe stock remains inexpensive because: 1) the shares are majority owned by
one entity (the A.I. duPont Testamentary Trust owns approximately 46 million of
the outstanding 79 million JOE shares; 2) St. Joe has had an identity crisis
(the company was previously a diversified company with rail assets and a
non-committal management attitude towards property development), and 3)
management is in the midst of developing JOE’s five miles of white-sand
beaches, 39 miles of Gulf of Mexico coastline, and 256 miles of near-coast
waterfront.

As of September 30, 2001, the company had 79,833,876 shares outstanding. This
figure reflects the recent buybacks through September 30, 2001. At a current
market price of $27, the market cap is $2.16 billion. The balance sheet
indicates approximately $1 per share in cash assets. Cash flow is being
utilized for the stock buyback plan. The one million acres of Florida land are
stated on the balance sheet at a price reflecting 1930s valuations. St. Joe’s
property represents a significant portion of the remaining Florida beachfront
and waterfront properties.

In 2000, St. Joe completed a tax-free spin-off of Florida East Coast
Industries, Inc. This spin-off will allow management to focus upon property
development.

In 2000, management completed the first $150 million stock buyback program and
began a second $150 million stock buyback plan. The second stock buyback plan
was completed in 2001. The third stock buyback plan began in 2001. This plan is
a $200 million stock buyback program, which is currently in effect. During the
fourth quarter of 2001, management has stated plans to repurchase approximately
one million shares from the public.

Beginning in 2000, management identified timberland for sale as residential and
recreational properties. St. Joe began to sell tens of thousands of rural
acres, which were previously designated as timberland. This distinction between
timberland and residential land will create significant shareholder value.

During the third quarter of 2001, St. Joe repurchased a total of 1,127,550
shares, including 590,400 shares purchased from public shareholders and 537,150
shares from the Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust, the majority stockholder
of St. Joe and the Trust's primary beneficiary, The Nemours Foundation. From
the completion of the spin-off of Florida East Coast Industries, Inc., about
one year ago, St. Joe had repurchased 7,935,300 shares by September 30, 2001.
That represents approximately 9.3 percent of the then outstanding shares, at an
average price of $23.46 per share.

At September 30, 2001, the company had 79,833,876 shares outstanding of which
45,792,192 shares were held by the Trust and 2,082,108 shares were held by the
Foundation. At September 30, 2001, the company had 79,833,876 shares
outstanding. At September 30, 2001, $145.9 million remained of the company's
third stock repurchase authorization of $200 million.

“REGIONAL PLACE-MAKING” as a BUSINESS STRATEGY

Management has placed emphasis upon developing their Florida property into
desired living quarters and regional vacation-destinations. Key factors to
consider include the following:

A. In 2000, St. Joe broke ground on SouthWood, which is a 4,250-home planned
community on 3,800 acres of natural lakes and rolling hills.

B. Management has focused its efforts to improve/develop the infrastructure
surrounding its undeveloped properties. These efforts include the following: 1)
the Federal Aviation Administration approved the relocation of the Panama City
airport to a site on St. Joe land (this will create economic growth for St.
Joe’s northwest Florida communities), 2) St. Joe has provided land for
right-of-way road development, 3) St. Joe donated land for a new hospital to be
built in Walton County, which is nearby St. Joe’s WaterColor property
development, 4) St. Joe donated land for the development of two new schools,
and 5) St. Joe dismantled the paper mill at Port St. Joe (this mill was a relic
of the old industrial economic base).

C. The northwest Florida property development, WaterColor, began sales in 2000.
Prices have ranged from inland prices of $270,000. Inland premium Gulf-front
residences contracted for an average of $1.22 million.

D. The SummerWood development program, which is near Panama City, includes
homes priced between $130,000 - $160,000. SummerWood home sales are anticipated
to create earnings for the next 20-years.

CATALYSTS

Potential catalysts include the following: 1) the continuance of a significant
stock buyback plan from significant and public St. Joe shareholders, 2) an
aging population strongly desires the opportunity to live primarily in Florida
or purchase a second home in Florida, and 3) St. Joe continues to develop
residential areas on the Florida coastline. The property development continues
to add shareholder value on a regular basis. St. Joe’s total enterprise value
reflects, in part, what the company is worth today. It takes only a look at the
pictures of residential development to understand the value distinction between
underdeveloped Florida coastline and a developed Florida community on prime
coastline. The addition of an airport, schools, roads, and a complete
infrastructure provide enterprise value in assessing the true value of St. Joe.

I believe that as long as St. Joe continues to develop the Florida communities,
then investors will prosper with an increasing St. Joe earnings stream. The
individual share price will continue to increase in value as St. Joe reduces
the number of outstanding shares available in the marketplace.

re: what have we learned

I don't know that there has been any collective advance in learning or
knowledge in value investing. To me it seems like the accepted principles and
the debates have not changed. There is, of course, individual learning.

Interesting questions to me are "what is value investing" and "how do you
characterize this particular community?"

For me value investing boils down to this string of statements:

what is the discounted present value of this business... i will not project
past growth willy-nilly out into the future ... i will very grudgingly price in
high (e.g., 15+%) future growth rates ... yes, the balance sheet and cash flow
statements are just as important as the income statement... and what is the
level of certainty about the valuation, and no, technical or price-per-share
related analysis is pretty worthless regardless of how tempting (even to me).

The actual valuation process and metrics is driven by the time, information and
resources that are practical for me as an individual to apply to widely varying
business models and situations. As an individual, I don't want to and cannot
apply professional rigor to the process. I have to use judgment, experience,
and intuition to guide me through shortcuts. If I had professional rigor, I
wouldn’t be using this thread as one of my shortcuts. Finally, I add scrutiny
to the process when I lose money or want to invest more.

re: "how do you characterize this particular community?"
This community feels very small to me (like 100 to 200) people. I don't know
how to estimate lurkers. I would guess that the community comprises primarily
two groups: the first group is individuals with a serious hobby and a bent
toward their vision of value investing in equities, and the second group is
individuals who have "made it" based on their vision of value investing and now
are full-time for their own account. If there is a professional money manager
audience (besides the two individuals you mention), they sure are invisible. It
seems like there is a strong bias toward US equities (common and preferred).
There has not been much focus on investing in international, mutual funds,
commodities, options, or debt. I think the primary investment universe for the
community is the 10,000 US stocks.

re: portfolio concentration
Are you saying you don’t go over 3% in a position? Obviously, concentration is
both the number of positions, and how much you have in them. I routinely go
over 5% (primarily through appreciation) and I believe these positions
disproportionately benefit my returns. I develop these positions when I have
relatively high confidence and the market is giving me “inadequate” returns
(Owens Illinois and UNUMProvident are this year’s examples, Pep Boys last
year’s). There has been change over the five year period on concentration… you
can now buy practically unlimited trading in securities at a practical cost. As
an individual, however, you still have a large information burden with a 100+
stock portfolio, plus significant tax reporting and portfolio performance
reporting burdens. It is nice, however, eating small slices of humble pie.

Re: participation/recognition
I think recognition is key. The people in the community that invest in a
discussed stock without later acknowledging this to the thread damage the
community (and thus themselves-- to the extent they benefit from the
community). I think individuals do not post because they think their view will
affect the ocean that is the US stock market. Instead, they post (a) to solicit
response and (b) to help the community and (c) to help individuals in the
community. If nobody buys or responds, why post? If you are in either group,
the constraints of time and attention when your investment universe is 10,000
US stocks are compelling.

Re: quality/depth of posts
Recognition drives the quality of the posts when you realize you will not
influence the market. I don’t understand individuals just posting tickers. You
have to demonstrate a track record for that to be meaningful. (Of course, there
will be posters where you are grateful for only the ticker). How many
individuals here recognize more than a thousand tickers? I might be able to
recognize half the names. It seems like the minimum on an introductory post
should be the name, the ticker, a ten-word description of the business, and
what you most like about the stock. You don’t need a complete write-up to
generate discussion.

I have learned that for most stocks beauty is in the eye of the beholder and
the view is dynamic. Relative valuations are meaningless unless there are
active acquisitions taking place in the sector. I take anything anyone says
with a grain of salt and do my own dilligence. An undervalued situation doesnt
mean anything if the management is not willing to act in the interest of the
shareholders- Seagate anyone? Insider buying or lack of insider selling seems
to me to be an important intangible. To me in insider who touts his stock
publicly while liquidating shares is of questionable integrity and I would
doubt anything that person says. I am also not that happy about company loans
to purchase stock. It has been my sad experience that when the investment
doesn't work out as plan the loan is forgiven the options are repriced and the
other sharholders bare the consequences.
One needs to understand the business and contingent liabilities as well as the
pitfalls of foreign entities and subs. Nevertheless It is comforting to know
that true bargains seem to materialize on a regular basis for patient investors
who know what their levels of risk and reward are. who are not overly greedy
and who know what the time frame is to seek the return of their investment.

Good for you on FASH. I did not buy any. Darn.

Been looking at LQID based on the two 13-d guys. Both Steele and Holtzman have
positions and are TRYING to make something happen. Mgmt seems insistent to keep
blowing money though.

My small position in ASCX has done well. I just didnt buy enough.

I am just not finding the kind of situations I like. (Compelling value with
significant insider buying) In fact, nearly any situation that has had a
cluster of insider buying quickly jumps 30-40% above their buy prices.

My cash rich AMCE has finally turned back up. This one does not burn cash like
the dotcoms do and it has been a terrifice rolling stock. I buy low & sell high
and have been doing so for many years now. And they STILL havent found a
business for all their cash.

My other cash rich situation, CRTQ is appealing as the insider group continues
to accumulate as well as bio-tech value. This one has the downside proection of
$3.70 in cash with a value investor in charge as well as a significant bio-tech
portfolio but without the burn rate.

Paul: Thank you for the retrospective - great topic. Here I respond to
diversification [without reading other, prior replies] Link to Glassman
article: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44461-2001Nov17.html
When Glassman writes "Peter Lynch, who was probably the best mutual fund
manager of the 20th century, calls spreading yourself too thin
"diworseification."
I beleive he misquotes Lynch whose reference to "diworseification" was a
negative take on companies buying other companies in unrelated businesses and
paying a premium to do so. Lynch favors portfolio diversification for
individual investors, as, I suspect, does Buffett.
The Focus Twenty fund comments hit at a vulnerability we all have...tending to
concentrate in sectors we know, or where we have an edge. This is really a good
thing as long as some method is used to spread risk...as in mixing some funds
with stock holdings...and particularly spreading among asset classes as well as
stock sectors.
Personally I've often noted Paul's comments on broad diversification especially
with microcaps. I've made 2 concentrated bets, but still less than 3% net after
tax exposure and both went badly...one has comeback nicely - 100+% net gain and
the other is yet to play out fully, but will probably end well into the loss
column. Key lesson: It's really tough for an outside investor to really know
what's going on inside a company.

Lynch was referring to corporate acquisitions outside core businesses and not
individual portfolios.

Assuming you're not referring to sector traders who are TA driven, I'd say it's
ill advised to select sectors with no understanding of underlying fundamentals,
but perhaps a good ideal if the investor has some understanding of the sector,
but not engough to follow and select individual companies...I own funds in
Biotech for this reason. The voluem of info in the biotech sector is
overwhelming...like drinking from a firehose. But the potential in this sector
over the coming twenty years is large. [Good book for investors: 'The Biotech

I would have to disagree about the comparability of an investor buying a sector
fund and Ford buying a company...the fund can be sold at the end of any trading

Thanks for your observations, Brendan. Lot of meat in your post. I'll comment
on just a few areas:

If you believe value investing is discounted present value, then I assume you
would be calculating that summary number - if you had the "time, information,
and resources" to do so. You don't, so you don't??

Right, I try to keep purchases of a particular stock to not more than 3% of the
portfolio value. But I fudge: If I want to buy more of the stock than 3% of a
portfolio, I'll add it to more portfolios. I've even considered starting
separate, additional portfolios. If the stock subsequently has a good move,
I'll try to find the courage to let the stock run as far as I can.

I believe "professional rigor" in analyzing stocks is a debatable proposition.
All those funds holding ENE -- these professionals didn't see it coming? Not
even sure about "professional rigor" just in holding stocks. These guys panic
just like anybody else, it often seems to me.

Thanks, Bob. A discussion about Peter Lynch and diversification or
concentration always seems to be on two hands, in my opinion. On the one hand,
Mr. Lynch can be seen or heard or read telling individual investors to invest
in what they know - go to those shopping malls, see what and where other people
are buying, eating, etc. He's said, know as much about a company as you can -
the individual investor ought to be able to follow 5 stocks (or was it more?)
very well, and that might be all the investor needs, if I recall Mr. Lynch
comments correctly.

OTOH, when you read about how he managed his funds, they were broadly
diversified. Didn't he have over 1000 stocks in Magellan at one time? And if he
liked a sector, he sometimes bought the entire sector. Those mutuals or banks
that went public -- he was known to have bought them all or nearly all. I don't
know - maybe a few stocks made the bulk of his portfolio, but the man practiced
diversification, imo.

I am also still contemplating what I call the MB method of diversification
(which I "discovered" after looking at some posted portfolios.) If on Jan 1,
there are 12-15 stocks in a portfolio, and on July 1 there are still 12-15
stocks in that portfolio - but of those 12-15, 10 or more weren't there on Jan
1, is that a concentrated 12-15 stock portfolio? Or is it more diversified in
nature (having gone through 12-15 stocks +10 replacements = 22-25 stocks? All
this within 6 months, so maybe 35 held stocks annually.

I realize diversification/concentration factors might depend on a person's
specific tolerance for risk, years left in the workforce and goals to be
achieved. Still, my opinion is that most folks are far better served by aiming
to be diversified than by trying for concentration.

Lynch is pretty consistent in what he says. He believes you should stay
concentrated in a few companies you know very well, unless you have the entire
Fidelity Research Department backing you up, or unless your total AUM is
hundreds of millions or more. (And if you're going to do the latter it is

Personally, I have not been able to predict with any certainty which of my

Well, rjm2 I agree with you there about being unable to predict "with any

That's why I'm always surprised to see mutual fund managers who use "pig at
trough" investing. They keep say 50 stocks max., and if they come across one
they like better than one they already own, they kick out the one that is the
least likely of being successful. The rationale is that that forces them to be
disciplined. I say, since I believe they can not predict the likelihood of
success, this method inhibits investment success.

For me, that's not worked well in investing over a typical economic cycle (say,

houses. I understand some of the advantages that Fidelity's size has over other
houses and certainly over individuals (with Fidelity's ability to hire the best
talent, gain access to management, influence business decisions, etc.) Fidelity
has so many funds, picking one or more, to me, is more difficult than just

re: professional rigor, etc.

I wasn't trying to imply that professional rigor prevails. Professional rigor
to me would be a) knowing securities analysis, b) knowing the industry, and c)
spending a week analyzing a stock as an investment. I don't know how to rank my
securities analysis knowledge. I know I know no industries, really. And I don't
have time or inclination for 40 hours of analysis on a prospective investment
when I have a 100+ stock portfolio. (I will spend that much time as I make
further commitments.)

There is no question in my mind that the present value of current resources and
future cash flows is how to price stocks and how the market prices stocks. The
questions are knowability/confidence in future estimates, what discount rate do
you use, how do you factor in capital structure, what are the unlikely but
foreseeable future risks and how do you price them in, etc. In other words, the
differences of opinion are in the methods and judgments for
analyzing/"knowing"/guessing the present value of what's there and what will be
there. ... but ... I think this is hopeless for me to do this rigorously. Plus,
that strikes me close to being real work. Instead, I think the individual needs
to use heuristics that mimic the DCF analysis.

I'm bailing on Enron. I can't believe the original merger will go through with
this discount. I will wait for a new deal (and try to avoid the "BK") before
getting back in. There's too much debt and EV is pretty high for no deal and
deteriorating fundamentals.

Do you follow Mr. Lynch's recommendations as to having only a few
well-considered stocks? If so, has that worked out satisfactorily for you?

I'm constantly working on improving the "well-considered" part, but yes I do. I
try to hold no more than 10-15 stocks, and I doubt that I've ever owned more
than 20 at one time. Although I'm no superstar, I'm happy with my results. Of
course, one of the problems with a focused portfolio is that my results don't
prove much of anything. As the EMT folks would be quick to point out, lack of
diversification increases volatility, which in turn increases risk (as they
define it). This means that spectacular results, much better than mine, are to
be expected in some individual cases, but that these prove nothing. I don't
agree with most of EMT, but I do agree with the part about my results proving
nothing.

I should also add that I'm not a strict Lynch follower, although I've read both
One Up On Wall Street and Beating the Street. One Up was the book that, in
1989, gave me the courage to buy Microsoft, ignoring my idiot broker's advice
against it. After that I never looked back. Over the years though, I've
developed a style which is more in line with Warren Buffett than Peter Lynch.
Although there is certainly a lot of overlap in their philosophies, Buffett is
a much stronger proponent of buying and holding stocks for the long term,
whereas Lynch's style tends toward more turnover in the portfolio. FWIW,
there's a guy who hangs out on TMF who has read both Lynch books hundreds of
times and strictly adheres to Lynch's methods. He currently reports that his
annualized returns since 1993 are about 29%, and he is apparently able to back
up that claim.

My own philosophy vis a vis focused investing is best summed up in Warren
Buffet's 1996 letter to shareholders:

Should you choose, however, to construct your own portfolio, there are a few
thoughts worth remembering. Intelligent investing is not complex, though that
is far from saying that it is easy. What an investor needs is the ability to
correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word "selected": You don't
have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able
to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle
is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.

To invest successfully, you need not understand beta, efficient markets, modern
portfolio theory, option pricing or emerging markets. You may, in fact, be
better off knowing nothing of these. That, of course, is not the prevailing
view at most business schools, whose finance curriculum tends to be dominated
by such subjects. In our view, though, investment students need only two
well-taught courses - How to Value a Business, and How to Think About Market
Prices.

Your goal as an investor should simply be to purchase, at a rational price, a
part interest in an easily-understandable business whose earnings are virtually
certain to be materially higher five, ten and twenty years from now. Over time,
you will find only a few companies that meet these standards - so when you see
one that qualifies, you should buy a meaningful amount of stock. You must also
resist the temptation to stray from your guidelines: If you aren't willing to
own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.
Put together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward
over the years, and so also will the portfolio's market value.

Number of stocks is far less important than minimizing overlapping business and
market risk....selecting stocks [and other assed classes] that aren't highly
corellated with each other. International exposure used to be a good approach,
but anymore, other than Japan, they all seem to dance together. I would agree
that Lynch's method, as applied by most individuals, would result in over
concentration in sectors the investor has competence in. I beleive it's better
to use funds in areas the individual is disadvantaged vs the professional in
individual stock selection...such as emerging markets.

SOFN looks like a reasonable bet to me. I'm a buyer today.

I am assuming that company is adhering to its obligation to seek the highest
price for its stock. Which includes selling those net operating loss
carryforwards to a potential buyer. I assume there are at least a few companies
left that still pay taxes and would use those NOLs.

I further assume that management would like to be acquired as part of the deal
they strike. That is, they want to keep their management jobs (salaries) or get
consulting/contracting compensation.

Should no acquirer materialize, should NOLs have little value, I would hope the
company would take the next step for stockholders, which is to liquidate
itself.

OTOH, management might decide their own best option is to redeploy SOFN cash to
new business ventures. From the latest news announcement, it's not clear at all
to me that sale of the company is the only option. "...We think it is in the
best interest of our stockholders that we also explore transactions which focus
on our approximately $73 million of cash at October 31, 2001 and our status as
a Nasdaq-traded public company. Since most of our stockholders invested in us
as a technology company, we will be especially interested in transactions in
that area." If they use cash to become a buyer of somebody else, rather than a
seller to somebody (or just liquidate), then imo, the stock at current price is
not necessarily any bargain.

Paul,

It seems to me that not favoring any one stock in particular is logically
equivalent to not favoring any i.e. indexing or at least "strategic" indexing a
la O'Shaunessy, filtering a universe of stocks by such criteria as PSR, ROE,
insider buying etc.

Unless you're willing to deal with Microcaps, some form of indexing, value or
otherwise, is probably the best way to go for most people as inefficiencies are
hard to come by above a certain market cap.

Myself I rarely hold more than 10 or so tickers as I find it hard to follow
more than that.To me risk is not beta or diversification but in the
fundamentals of the companies I own and in the short term at least, in the
valuation of the market as a whole.

Well I do have favorite stocks. But I find if I make bigger bets on them than I
ordinarily would, ofttimes these are just the stocks that turn out so poorly
and stay that way - regardless of what appealed to me - favorable financial
ratios, insider buying, etc.

There are more small caps than large caps, so maybe there are just more
opportunities for inefficiencies with small caps. The argument could be that
there are fewer analysts or funds who follow them too. I don't buy that. If I
see small caps I like, I very commonly see value funds with positions in those
stocks or their analysts recommending those stocks. All it takes is a couple of
analysts or a couple of funds buying small amounts to markedly reduce any prior
inefficiencies in the value.

Many stocks mentioned here have been large caps that people believe to be
inefficiently priced. Berkshire last year, Honeywell, some food companies come
to mind. While those opportunities may be rarer, the presumable business power
of those companies suggests that larger bets can be made on each of those type
stocks than might be prudent with a small cap stock. (I'm not saying I make
larger bets the larger the market cap or market power of the company, but
perhaps I should.)

I also will add to my small NVS position if stock drops further. I'm
considering same with MRK. Ditto SGP. BMY maybe now is a decent speculation
too, but I'm still overweighted in that stock.

These pharmaceutical stock are unanalyzable, imo. No matter how few stocks one
follows or for how long one follows one of these companies or how competent
one's analyst skills are. There are just too many unknown factors and surprise
blockbuster drugs or competitors or legal problems, and so on. It sometimes
seems to me that professional analyst opinions on these stocks are contrary
indicators - buying the stock(s) they downgrade results in profits after a
couple of years.

I can dismiss these pharma companies quickly enough though as not being
absolute value stocks (as I interpret value). They are more relative values:
stocks with good past history and relatively low p/e's and with some indication
the companies might be around to eventually have important drugs that increase
earnings and help the stock regain investor attention (stock price reversion to
mean).

In my opinion, this is where a diversified (more than 25 stocks)value investor
can fish a bit. Pharma stocks add a type of diversity that value investors with
concentrated portfolios wouldn't consider at pharma's current prices. And
because value investors with diversified portfolios are often paid for their
patience (and thus are, or should be, patient), value investors ought to be
able to hold on to these stocks for the upside just as they hold value stocks.
(Not that taking a quick 8 point gain or so on a roughly $38 stock is wrong!
Congrats.)

I do like pharma stocks specifically in recessionary times and I think they
deserve a premium PE because of the superb business economics of the drug
business:
1) Low capex/high free cash flow. R&D is expensed directly rather than
depreciated over time
2) Recession resistant. Low price elasticity
3) Lt favorable and predictable growth

I do think that pharma stocks are rlative bargains since they trade at a
discount PE to the market. My rule of thumb is to look at buying a pharma stock
when the PE is about 20 or less. I think NVS is one of the best values right
now. BMY looks interesting too since R&D seems to gain traction and PE is
fairly low. SGP has huge issues right now, so I am avoiding this stock at
current prices but i would look into buying at less than 30$.

I know it sounds like hindsight but I excited DNR at a loss, because I feared
exposure to Enron. I followed you into DNR because fundamentals looked good:
high cash flow, low PE etc. but I became very concerned about possible hedge
exposure to Enron, after reading that Apache has closed all, hedge positions
with Enron a few days ago.
It seems that caution is justified:
http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/011128/280339_1.html
DNR has done significant hedging after the Matrix natural gas acquisition to
stabilize cash flow.
Since the price floor is 4.25$/BOE for 2002 and 3.75$/BOE for 2003, these
hedges are worth serious money at current prices of 2.2$/BOE. I blowup would
certainly hurt badly, if these hedges are with Enron as a counterparty (I do
not know if that is the case).

I did not like the Matrix acquisition after crunching the numbers even with the
hedges being OK. Very short reserve lifetime and a high price paid per reserve
BOE made hedging necessary.

Looks like the right thing to do, Spekulatius. I'm still trying to determine
what I'll do with my small DNR position.

somewhat related: ABN

In news reports of banks with large loans to ENE, ABN was mentioned. ABN is a
relatively big position for me. (certainly relative to DNR)

In one news report ABN were asked about their ENE loan exposure, and they
replied, "no comment". Well, that scared me. This is how they prepare for an
inevitable reporter's question? That's all they can say? Can't give a range of
exposure or even a pabulum statement for us poor ABN stockholders?

I mentioned I bought ABN because I believed it to be a downtrodden bank selling
at low prices, but offering a decent yield for patient investors. Safe and
cheap.

I believe I'm better off stepping out of ABN now until they do issue a
statement that gives some indication of how bad ENE debacle has affected their
balance sheet. I don't see the stock getting away from me (rising much from
current price) whether the loan losses are small or large. I figure I'll have
another chance to buy back ABN if I want.

Exited position at small loss.

Anyway, your post spurred me on to take some action.
Thanks.

Paul Senior.

mrcjmoney, others: review of real estate operating companies discussed here and
some possible stock ideas:

As you know, REOC's offer the potential of reward if their underlying assets
can be determined to be more valuable than their stock market caps. Especially
if/when those assets get monetized through land sales, development, etc.

So of course, JOE, being among the larger and older of these type businesses
(JOE with its railroad and land holdings actually predating the category REOC)
has been discussed and followed here several times. One professional analyst
here had followed the stock, and his comments were prescient and profitable for
those who listened and bought.

Other stocks discussed on this thread include:

CDX, ALCO, CTO, NWL, TRC

My recollection is that anyone who bought any of the Florida REOC after they
were mentioned here (or on the Buffett thread) has had an opportunity to take
good profits. (price rises in CTO, ALCO, and JOE stocks)

For California companies, it was/is more iffy. Newhall stock (NWL) has bounced
around - they've had some difficulty getting building permits - I notice now
still a little insider buying though. And it's been slow going for Catellus
(CDX) too. For Tejon Ranch (TRC) it's been a cyclical ride. Those people here
who were in when it was much discussed here in '97 (was it that long ago?) got
a double or triple quite quickly after Marty Whitman announced he was buying
the Tribune's large TRC position and would speed development of TRC's Los
Angeles properties.

Fwiw, I see TRC and JOE stocks as being cyclical (at least for now - until
development progresses more?), and so I'm reluctant to start a position at
current prices.
I've passed on NWL many times. (JOE too- to my sorrow) CDX is boring - I have
it, I occasionally add to it, and I'll consider adding more if stock drops.

I also have SCZ which owns large positions in a few REITs but which itself is
not a REIT. The offset to the lack of dividend is that SCZ is more flexible (in
its businesses and capital structure) than is the typical REIT.

A few days ago I started a small exploratory position in LNR (the real estate
business spin off of homebuilder Lennar). LNR's public record is only since
'97, but that record is pretty good. Low p/e, with diversified real estate
holdings. They may have more debt than I'd like -- that could be a function of
the collateralized mortgage loans they make (which itself could be a dangerous
game)

All jmo,
my recall of actual events might be incorrect,
I'm no expert in REOC or real estate,
I'm glad to have been in a few, sorry I missed out on some others.

<<Can't give a range of exposure or even a pabulum statement for us poor ABN
stockholders?>> Found this in a list of exposures: "ABN AMRO some exposure but
loans secured, an industry source said. Is part of an international syndicate
that has loaned up to $3 billion to Enron's Indian project"
Methinks the 'Indian project' is a real dog's breakfast and sorting exposure
thru the filter of an 'international syndicate' adds to complexity....They

Despite aversion to situations involving exposure to regulators, I started a
small position in CPN after listening to CC [Long, but informative]. I came
away assured that: Net exposure to ENE is immaterial, Other that operating
leases, there aren't off balance sheet debts.
On the regulatory issue: Calif. is a loony bin, but they appear to view CPN as
more part of solution than part of problem. CPN is expected to earn 2.60 so
selling for <9x 02....with a 5 year growth est of 30%. They indicated that
hedging has made their exposure to energy price fluctuations immaterial.
EV/EBITDA ~5.2 @22.8 ttm EBITDA.
I felt adding operating leases to EV wouldn't be appropriate since the annual
cost [lease payments] is factored into EBITDA [as expenses]...there are a chunk
of them...a quick and dirty PV kicked up about 2.3$B...mostly on cogeneration
plants.

I've started a tiny position in Kennedy-Wilson, a thinly-traded microcap in the
real estate business. This is another example, imo, of a stock where for the
potential small investor, it's nearly impossible to understand KWIC businesses;
or else the time spent to figure it out imo is hard to justify by the risk of
taking on a large position or with the payback one gets from going with only a
small position.

http://www.kennedywilson.com/

Here are some aspects of KWIC that interest me:

Price is near a three year low.
Revenues have been generally increasing in past few years.
Stock, now at $3.50/sh., is below book value of about
$5.9/sh.
In past few years, KWIC has often earned between $.5 and
.8/sh (and so current p/e is low --looking backwards)
There's a very small amount of insider buying recently and
at higher prices than now.
The officers/execs make a lot of money for the size of the
company.
There are a few value funds which have small positions
in this stock.
The company's been around for many years, but seems to be reinventing itself.

Imo, any outside investor who buys this thing ought to be a value investor who
only takes on a very small amount of KWIC stock and who is willing to wait
18-36 months to see a favorable return.

SOFN - Softnet - is saying they'll take any & all offers - they'll go to the
high bidder - wtih about $3 cash + big pent up losses - & several decent
ongoing business lines - I'll stick this one out to the $3+ level

- more importantly - it appears an announcemnt should happen by 31 jan 02 - so

- Util companies are dirt cheap at the moment - & I don't mean Enron-types -
instead, I mean regular utility companies that own plants & have a
semi-protected turf - although they do buy & sell wattage so they do have
ancillary overlap - but really they're like beaten down REITS of 3 or 4 yrs ago

- Here's 3 utility companies trading w/ p/e's of under 10; & high book value -
& btw - all have projected even higher earnings in 2002:

- PPL CORP (NYSE:PPL) - $36
- RELIANT ENER (NYSE:REI) - $26
- WISCONSIN ENER (NYSE:WEC) - $22

was good to me twice.
Looking at VVR (a closed end bond equivalent fund) in the belief that interest
rates will back up, perhaps significantly. In the same vein, am vaguely
considering shorting zero coupons.
Good trading to all!
