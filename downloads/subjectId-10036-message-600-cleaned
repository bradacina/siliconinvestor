Hi Mike B: re Banks. Yes I agree with your observations. The conventional
wisdom is that as interest rates drop, banks' earnings (and stock prices) rise
and vice versa. (Although some analysts say that banks now hedge the risk of
exposure to increasing interest rates). Interest rates have trended down over
the past decade or more, and bank stocks have shown that inverse correlation I
think.
Also, the market for all stocks is up. It does seem though (my impression) that
bank stocks have, over the past 2+ years, moved up gradually but persistently.
(ignoring takeover stocks). I recall no bank stocks individually or as a group
"correcting" like certain tech sectors have (semi's, networking). Thus my
opinion that it's been very hard to lose money in the banking sector. But of
course, the question is where do these bank stocks go from here - or maybe, is
there still an undervaluation we can spot? As for brokerage stocks. what you
say makes sense to me, but I don't follow them, so I have no info/opinion to
add. Paul

Wayne: Thanks for the acronym search engine - i immediately bookmarked it.

re RCMT: The insider ownership is a definite plus. Particularly in a company of
this nature (I used to work for one) - believe me, "shareholder value" is
really important when it directly effects the officer's net worth.

The graph at stockmaster.com shows that RCMT it did a reverse split of 5/1 (.2
to 1) sometime last april. The huge price range was bugging me . From the '96
10-k in EDGAR:

<2. Stock Split
In April 1996, the Board of Directors, with stockholder approval, amended the
Company's Articles of Incorporation to effect a one-for-five reverse split of
common stock whereby each five shares of issued and outstanding common stock
were exchanged for one share of common stock.>

E.G. if you bought 500 @ 3 = 1500 cost you now own 100 @ 9 1/8 or 912.5. I hope
you have taken this into account.

On the earnings, I was using Zacks that also has two analysts, with mean
estimate of FISC YR END 10/97=0.58. Based 4 year average PE of around 12-13,
the implied forward 15 and 12.3 aren't particulary cheap (or expensive either).

BTW: RCMT is also is highly rated by Zweig Performance Ratings Report at a 2 on
scale 1-9, 1 tops.

The eps I used were from the AAII stock investor of (1996, 1995, etc) 0.47,
0.28, 0.49, 0.25, 0.33 and I question whether the company really has turned
around and will grow consistently. I noticed that the 10-k indicates .55, .06,
.10 respectively. With split and acquisitions, will the real eps please stand
up?

It appears that it can grow consistently (mgmt change, successful acquisitions,
etc), but remains to be seen.

Good trading.

Aaron,

It is my understanding that this is the result of the merger of two clients and
a rising level of hardware sales to this entity, which is also a major Services

have a much lower impact on profitability.

Since I originally posted these I have read Cook's "Wall St. Money Machine"
coming away with two good thoughts; use multiple strategies and the concept of
selling covered calls. I am currently 3/4 through the "Cyber-Investing" book. I
have not tried Telescans' services on line yet. I want to fininh the book
first.

From the results of the list above I am realizing that to be sucessful, I will
need to incorporate more than just pure price technical analysis.
Cyber-Investing did explain what the various fundamental indicators meant and
how they were each useful in narrowing down potential stock buys but I
personally did not find the book very good at explaining the procedures for
generating searchs.

Michael Burry, you wrote a while ago that you did not like Telescan because of
their data inaccuracies and that you used Dial Data. Now that I have more
knowledge would you (or anyone for that matter) expound on your experiences
with Telescan and recommendations for on line investment tools and books to

H. Sullvan: I think you are in the wrong church. Wade Cook, covered calls,
support levels, technical analysis, one month's performance (Feb-Mar) - what do
they have to do with value investing?

Here's what I like about what you are doing:
a) seem to keep very good records
b) seem to watch performance of stocks very closely
c) continuing your search for a method (methods) you can use
successfully
d) able and willing to learn from what you are doing (make changes)
e) willing to post so that I can learn from what you are doing- &
which maybe confims to me what does or may not work for me.
f) information presented which makes me think about how I operate

Here's what is missing in your note I think (and JMHO):
a) sense of definition of investing. Not separating investing from speculating
and not trying to separate into these 2 camps each purchase and each method
used.
b) no utilization of fundamentals as per classic stuff such as Graham's
"Intelligent Investor" or the Fisher father/son books or perhaps Al Frank's
"New Prudent Speculator".

Just my opinions as I try to find my own path also.

Re: Open Text, I remain long and see the same positive chart, but
it is of course not a value stock. Check out Friedman's Jewelers --
a value pick I brought up a while ago on this thread (FRDM). It
is giving a buy, having broken out of its downtrend.

Re: Telescan, when I challenged them on some bad data, the guy

Mike - Although I haven't actually shorted stocks on the following method, IMO
the following method appears to work.

1. Screen on high PSR stocks.
2. Identify the ones that have the following characteristics:
a. high debt
b. low or negative margins
c. low ROE
3. Price within 25% of the 52-week high.
4. Verify "badness" against industry group.

This is the opposite of how I identify Super Companies/Super Stocks based upon
Fisher's PSR method. I have run this screen every few months and have checked
back periodically to find that a good number of these stocks have tumbled. Its
the ones that don't crash that are worrysome. The price could be bid up
irrationally to "who knows where".

Does anyone have any insight into shorting stocks as a market hedge? How many
stocks does it take, which ones, and are there
areas to avoid?

I agree re: the stocks that don't go down. Many of the techstocks
seem to go up and down over the short term regardless of valuation.
I wonder if one should avoid techstocks altogether when shorting
based on a value approach? I am currently disobeying this rule
as I am short Autodesk.

Thanks for your input.

From:Paul Senior

Hi Mike, I seem to always have a terrible time shorting. If I pick just one
really "overvalued" stock - based on PSR - then I find that as Jeff Maresh has
stated what may happen - happens -- that is just the stock that continues to go
higher and higher. I know the stock will fall, but get chased out of it.
Because there is no limit to the amount of loss that can be predicted (i.e.
stock can rise seemingly forever), and because I do not have a concrete,
specific reason to expect the stock to drop (as for example A and B are close
competitors, A announces down earning, I could expect B to drop when they
preannounce/announce their earnings); and finally because I just do not have
the intimate company knowledge that gives me confidence in my short position.
On the other hand, if I take a package of stocks to short, say 3-5, then I
forget what I want. Am I investing for future growth or playing a numbers -
statistical game or betting against myself? Being hedged like that, what
happens when the market goes up - do I applaud; is that what I want?
I think it takes a completely different mindset to short successfully than go
long. Even though it SEEMS like it's just the opposite of what one does to go
long. I believe it is wrong to assume that if one can find undervalued stocks
successfully, one could (simply or easily) apply the same methodology in the
reverse. In my experience, it doesn't work. To really hedge, I'd rather be in
cash or some non-stock investment. (But none of this stops me from taking the
occasional short! ;-) Paul

Mike - The reason I don't short is because of the irrational nature of the
market in bidding up prices - like netscape at $160. To hedge, I own stocks
that **should** perform well if the market takes a hit - like Euro-Nevada
mining. My portfolio is at a very low PSR so that when the inevitable does
come, I'm holding stuff that historically should recover and recover quickly.
The average price-weighted PSR of my portfolio is just under 2. I am
uncomfortable shorting because its a bet against the market which has risen at
a 10% historic rate. And its not possible to predict a major decline.

WHX Update: Strike is going to be a long one and earnings suck.

The news on the strike front was grim last week, with neither side appearing
willing to give in. The earnings report wasn't rosy either. I used this news as
a signal to buy more (lots more). In one of my earlier posts, I noted that the
company appeared to be putting a floor under the stock price with its share
buyback program. Problem now is that it looks like I am supplying the floor,
not the company.

WHX more news

George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America, on Friday
accepted an invitation from Rep. Bob Ney (R., Ohio) to meet with Ney, the
Concerned Clergy Task Force and Ron LaBow, chairman of WHX Corp., to discuss
the continuing strikes at WHX's Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. unit's plants.
May go no where but it may speed up the process some.

From:Aaron K. Dhiman

I am watching these events with much interest. The loss in the fourth quarter
was a bit larger than expected, and a substantial loss in the first quarter is
expected as well. The company is still pulling in revenues from finishing
purchased steel and from coke production, but will inevitably lose money until
the strike is over. LaBow is REFUSING to give in at all on the pension plans,
and Becker says the USWA intends to break WHX.

Plants in three states are currently being struck, and although the workers
appear to be hurt by the lack of earnings, it doesn't appear that they are all
entirely anxious to get back to work. In Ohio, the striking workers just won a
ruling which allows them to collect unemployment benefits. The striking workers
are also collecting a check from the USWA. LaBow says that he will not attempt
to hire new workers because he fears that will lead to violence.

WHX has embarked on an advertising campaign to try and talk some sense into the
workers. It is placing ads in the local papers, on the radios and tv stations,
and is mailing out videos to the workers. The workers' take on the issue is
that they were promised a defined benefit plan after the company emerged from
bankruptcy, but the company will only give a defined contribution plan (payouts
dependent upon investments).

The company does not intend to give in-period. Although things do not look good
for the company, I do not think that the stock price can go much lower. I am
still considering a buy, but am going to contact the company first. If anyone
is interested, I think that this is a good person to talk to:

Gregg Warren
(304)234-2440

This is the contact listed on the companies info-ads, which workers are asked
to call.

What does everyone estimate the loss to be for each quarter that they are not
in business? The last quarter saw losses of under $35 million. I think it is
important to find out which of the striking plants they are leasing or own and
what are the main expenditures for these plants. If they continue to lose $35
million each quarter, they
will definitely be O.K. for one more year, BUT they REALLY do need to do
something to get things rolling.

What kind of say should the shareholders have in this matter? Do you think that
LaBow is justified in refusing to give in? In a way, I admire his determination
not to yield to the damn Union. Most of the workers already make $40K+ each
year, and the company has proposed a raise and a new pension plan which gives
$1200-$1600 a month, depending on years of service.

It would really be helpful to hear from some of the workers on this issue
because there is really no telling how long this could go on.

i personaly believe that the strike maybe settled sooner than later,
when things look to bleak, that's where hope begins.

here are a few observations

1) i view the order by the court reinstating unemployment benefits to the
workers as a plus, since it is inevetable that any settlement would include
back pay to the workers which would be by now 35 million dollars and the
government will pay the tab which is fine. This will also give the company and
workers an incentive to settle now before the numbers get out of hand. (its
like giving a person a second chance).
2) in my opnion the workers should be fired and a referendum and vote should be
taken by the common shareholders.
3) at $7 a share the total cap of the common is 140m. a joke.
4) i will submit to the company some options that came to mind in dealing with
the situation, and may post them afterwards on these boards
5) i think the company should announce its buyback of 10m shares at $7 per
share, the benefits are huge and the downside is minimul.
6) the company should not give in at any price
7) the stock price can only go higher from here

hope to keep you posted

I follow two of the stocks that you listed closely,PERI and ATML. ATML is kind
of damaged goods right now. Has major support at 24 but may not go up
significantly until they have a very positive earnings report. Considering that
they've already prereleased that they expect a bad quarter, I don't see much
movement in this stock until this summer. As for PERI, they got bashed (stock
went down from 34 to 11.5) when they announced earnings were going to be
between .15 and .22/share(street was expecting .22/share). They then made
another statement that it will now be between .20 and.22/share. Basicly the
same stock, just at less than half the price as two weeks prior. In my opinion,
a much better buy. Your comments greatly appreciated.

I checked some of these out but stopped because they, in general,

H. Sullivan: here's a site where you might find stock market books.

http://www.bookweb.org/bookstore/fraser/

I've got their 60+ pg. catalog in front of me. Have ordered from them before
w/no problem. I notice other books that I think are good, not mentioned here
(this thread) before: Tobias "Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need" (5th ed.,
1996 - easy reading) and the books by John Train - "The Money Masters" and "The
Craft of Investing". Forget "Security Analysis" by Graham and Dodd - Too
ponderous and IMO useless. Seems like it's the most talked-about unread book
around.

For me, I am trying to find time to read "Investment Psychology Explained"
(Martin Pring); "Understanding Cash Flow" (Plewa,Jr et. al.); "The Investor's
Equation" (Bowen and Ganucheau) (on which cover it says "The value investor's
low p/e strategy); "Buy High, Sell Higher" (Reid) (Where'd that come from?- and
there's probably a very good reason why nobody heard of Mr. Jesse B. Reid since
1966); "Built to Last" (Collins & Porras) (which asks the question "What
separates GE,3M, Merck, Wal-Mart,HP, Disney, Philip Mo. from their
competitors?)

Also, I think Mike B. got it right: seems like a person develops his/her
investment style after a few years. That's a few years in the trenches. And in
my humble opinion, only after being dealt some severe setbacks.

Net Income/Sh 0.13 0.08 0.22 0.06 0.22 ( 0.29) 0.13

Gross Margin 49% 46% 49% 43% 45% 44% 46%
Net Margin 8% 6% 7% 3% 4% ( 5%) 2%

A good indicator of the strength of this growth is the fact that the
$1,245,000 of net income earned during the first six months of fiscal
1997 is equal to the net income for the entire prior fiscal year.

This growth is expected to continue for the next several years. The
recent increased acceptance of cryogenic prostate surgery is expected to
increase sales for Candela's already widely accepted cryogenic surgical
tools. And additional new laser surgical products will be introduced
later this year.

Based on relatively conservative assumptions, I am increasing my
projections for fiscal 1997 and now estimating that Candela will
generate revenues of around $36 million and net income approaching $2.4
million, with earnings per share of $0.42. This is a 18% increase in
revenue and a rather surprising 87% increase in earnings per share
versus the prior year.

At its closing price of $7.125 on Tuesday, March 11th, the Company is
substantially undervalued, and can justify a market price between $10.50
and $11.50 per share.

Although the Company is not currently followed by any sell-side
securities analysts, it has an adequate number of market-makers, and a
significant and seemingly stable institutional following.

Bob,

Well, I have some personal knowledge to share about Candela, since
I am in the medical field. Entirely anecdotal, but from what
I've seen and heard from fellow physicians, the Candela products are something
of a revolution in the field of dermatologic surgery.
The cosmetic uses should cushion Candela from all the cost-cutting
going on in medicine. Dermatology in general is actually doing quite well.
People are more willing to pay out of pocket to cure
diseases on their outsides. In general, I stay away from medical companies
because my macro view of medicine is that it is a shrinking market. However,
Candela is a good pick! Thanks Bob!

I thought that the opposite is true: baby-boomers are
getting old, and they need more medical care. Also as standard
of living increases in the developing countries, people will
use more medical care. Are we talking about different things?

Hi Raimondas,

****Warning -- this is not necessarily a value post. It might be of
interest to someone looking at valuing health care companies.****

You are correct. The elderly will need more care, but the question
is how much will medical providers (physicians as well as medical
device companies) be able to charge? There is a shrinking pie
of dollars for health care -- we peaked (and set off alarms) at
14% of GDP. Physicians are forming unions for a reason -- there
is a mad scramble within healthcare for crumbs from this shrinking
pie. Insurers, competing for care, are cutting premiums they
charge employers, and passing that on in reduced payments to hospitals
and physicians. The capitated environment (pre-paid) health care
also is working to drastically cut expenditures.

Companies that purport to make money by helping cut costs are
in effect limited by their own purpose. This includes HMO's, Physician
Management entities (Phycor,etc.), etc. They can grow by
expanding but there is no room for internal growth. I have the
same problem with restaurant stocks. The HMO industry, of course,
is in its M&A phase right now, which is the fourth of five stages of
industry maturity. I'd almost rather risk my money at a casino.

I envision a health market where physicians are well-paid (80-100K/yr)
but not overpaid like they have been. I also envision that investments in
capital equipment will be severely cut back. No longer
will a hospital, flush with cash, spend millions on a new technology
just so it can be like the hospital across the street. It simply
won't have the cash. Many hospitals are right now trying to figure
out how they can return to profitability after suffering recent
losses in the restructuring of health care. It is hard to emphasize
how turned on its head medicine is, compared to even 5 years ago.

A few trends can flourish, and Bob Davis' suggestion -- the Candela
laser --is one. Specialty products and services that appeal to
vanity (and hence draw the more lucrative, out-of-pocket paying
crowd) can do well, especially with aging baby boomers. Also, personal care
products that appeal to elderly people appear to be good investments. But that
industry is dominated by conglomerates and blue chips with insane valuations,
in my opinion.

The pharmaceuticals deserve a strong look, but one cannot go solely
on traditional valuation, because they too are dealing with a different market.
Hospitals and health plans now have formularies,
from which participating doctors can prescribe drugs. The pharmaceuticals now
have to compete openly and on price (more
than anything else) in trying to win a space on these formularies.
Nothing prevents the health plan from changing the formulary the
second something cheaper comes along. It is hard for anyone to know
how successful a drug is going to be, as well. Analysts predicting
a 1 Billion market for this or that drug are wrong more often than
not. These guys aren't practicing M.D.'s by any means. Doctors
are odd birds, and it is harder to get in their heads than one thinks.

I personally feel one can profit on the new health care environment
with appropriately placed shorts much more easily than picking
potential steadily growing companies.

Of course, I must qualify this. Obviously people are hardest on
the companies in their own industry. I'm no different.

Hi Mike, Jeff, et al: I been dating Oprah Winfrey! What a woman!

Her show is distributed by King World Productions (KWP) which also distributes
Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy!. Also has a small library of stuff - The Little
Rascals, for example. Well, the stock is 37+ with Value Line estimates of about
3.90 (I'm looking at 11/29 issue, Yahoo shows $3.80 today).
So we're talkin' a pe of about 10x and estimated sales/sh of maybe $18-19 per
share. This company has a LOT OF CASH - like $644m or $17 per sh. So if we back
the $17 out of the 37 price we get a company earning maybe $3.10 (rough rough
guess that maybe they're earning .70 sh on the $17 cash - 4% after tax??). For
this $3.10 you pay (37-17) $20. Some would might call that close to 7x
earnings. Earnings will probably be steady - seems like these top rated shows
stay that way for a while; advertising spots have just been increased, so I
don't predict any increase in earnings from the current $3.80 level.
But I don't see any decrease either. The good news is that cash flow - cash
generation will (HA - I must predict that) remain high with minimal capital
outlays. A possibility is that the $20 will generate as much as $4 each year in
cash.
But there are some strong negatives:
1. Oprah generates a very large proportion of revenues - apparently 39% last
year. (Oprah owns 2.3% of the outstanding KWP shares, according to Value Line).
If Oprah has a hissy and walks . . . well you can imagine what the co. officers
(who own 22%) and stockholders will experience.
2. To get the $20 stock there is that small matter of putting up $17 (stock at
37 roughly). Tying up $17 cash. Worse. What if the King brothers - controlling
investors - make an acquisition and it bombs. There goes $644 million. - $17.
And betting on the possibility of coming up with another or more hit shows -
well again, we know how fickle the entertainment biz is. Occasionally rumors
surface of a buyout of KWP, but I don't count on that.
I think management will muddle through. And I know that the cumulative effect
of $4 cash flow each year will bring the stock to a higher price than $37. I'm
buying at these prices and I will try to hold on. Yea Oprah!

Mike - I've been meaning to ask you about your lack of recommendations of
medical stocks for some time now! I'm suprised at your comment here. To me it
looks like a rapidly growing market. So much so that J&J is going to be added
to the DJIA.

Even if it were a shrinking market, there would still be big winners among the
losers. I think you have a lot of knowledge and insight to evaluate medical
stocks that the rest of us don't have. I believe in Peter Lynch's statement
that "you shouldn't buy stock in companies that you don't understand" which is
why I have stayed away from med stocks because I can't evaluate them. It is
also why I own mostly computer-related stocks of which I have a lot of
understanding or very boring stuff that is easy to understand like paper,
concrete and steel. I would really appreciate it if you would take a look at
the medical area relative to value stocks and post your opinions on some
promising VALUE plays.

I hope we can get this discussion going based on reasoned arguments, not just
saying "Hey, take a look at XXX" Thats a waste of time. I would rather read a
600 word reasoned argument than one line of hype.

The manufactured home sector is very interesting. Clayton Homes (CMH) for
instance, although there are others I am not as familiar with. This company has
an incredibly consistent record of 20% earnings growth for the last 15 or 20
years. If you look at the financials, you'd think you were looking at Wal-Mart.
You couldn't ask for better management. The stock tanked last October because
it missed earnings forecasts by a penny. A top executive immediately bought
$750,000 worth of stock on the open market. The stock got down to about 13 (the
insider bought at about 13 1/2 - there was a 5:4 split, so its a pain to
analyze). The stock rebounded to close to 16, and now has fallen back below 14
again. The logic is that interest rates are rising, so people won't buy as many
houses. Fine, but these are cheap houses, so maybe you figure people trade down
and manufactured housing still does fine. If you look at Clayton's historical
record, higher interest rates have not hurt earnings.

Don't buy it now, but do your research and pick an attractive target price. If
interest rates go up another 25 basis points, there is a good chance you'll get
another shot at this at about 13 (a consistent 20% grower at 12-13x earnings).
I don't look for growth, but if I can get it for free I'll take it.

I picked up CMH at 13.25. I believe there is a long term growth path for these
manufactured home communities, especially in the south (where CMH operates) for
downsizing retirees.

I also agree that this housing is relatively recession proof.

I like CMH because it's vertically integrated. They do their own financing too,
as well as build homes and operate communities.

Mesa looks like a classic value investment in terms of multiples, and the chart
looks exactly right (provided you didn't buy it before January, of course). It
seems to have found itself a bottom.

I don't know airlines, but Buffett wrote some very memorable words about his
mistake in US Air. This is a business where you are only as smart as your
dumbest, or most desperate, competitor. Do they have a somewhat protected
niche? Do they have any cost advantage? Otherwise you are just playing for a
short-term 20 or 30 percent jump. There's nothing wrong with that, I do it all
the time. But how do you feel about the business long term? What is their edge?
I know I'm not contributing much in the way of information, but I'm interested
in the answers to these questions because this looks like something I might
invest in if there's a decent long term story.

I agree that this is a definite growth choice, but I do not see why one should

expected to report a loss of ~.90 for 1997, and the latest earnings estimate
revisions have been negative. This, however, is due to expansion costs, and the
sales are going up, but, once again, I must say that I don't see the necessity
of jumping on right now.

The company has

frequently if a company stumbles. The ones that do make it big (Microsoft,
Oracle) are way overpriced for my value investing style. IMO the smaller the

they provide timely comprehensive information for all brokerage earnings

After I choose some good stocks from the screens, I use NAIC's (National Assoc

analysis. I use the historical financial data from Value Line in this software.
This usually takes about 20 minutes for each company.

After that if the stock and company look good, I get on Edgar and start to get
annual and quarterly reports, proxies, and SC13s for more clues.

Lastly, I do a web and journal search at the library for articles on the

all the way down from the 40s. PE around 8 if you don't count
the charges, which are acquisition related. No debt. Really unusual
volume yesterday.

Premenos (PRMO): 6 1/2, $6.08 book, $5.12 cash, $3.04 Sales, D/E
negligible, current 6.55. Looks like one can pick this company up
for almost pennies net of cash. Just recently bounced off book, but
has in general gotten killed down from the 40s. Estimates are around
20c/sh for 97 and 30c/sh for 98. At around $1.5 bucks net of
cash, the company sits at a PE of ~7.5X 97est.

I am still looking into medical companies, but it is really hard,
even if one is in the medical field. Every time I investigate a
home-grown lead, I find the stock has already been bid up. In
fact, Bob Davis' suggestion, Candela, is about the best I have come
up with. I am also looking at a company, Resmed (RESM), which makes a
more cost-effective sleep apnea treatment that is really the
standard of care now. But with a PE of 20 and at 4-5X book and
sales, it's hard to justify. Also, it's got a buck spread on an
18 dollar stock.

Thanks in advance,

Mike

Earlier today, Marlton Technologies (AMEX:MTY) announced that
its 1996 revenues increased 38% and its 1996 Pre-Tax Operating
Profits increased 82%. Earnings per share for the year rose 41% to
$0.45 from $0.32 in the prior year.

Once again, this shows that MTY is rapidly growing yet its stock,
which is trading at a PE of 8, is extremely undervalued by the
market.

O.K. I got a cheap stock that I would like someone to comment on, if ther
is any interest. It is called 4front software (FFST). The stock is
currently trading at $3/share which is basically an all-time low and
the thing keeps drifting lower. This thing is such a sleeper and such
a dog people are probably selling either out of boredom or disgust.

The story is that they are a low-tech tech company operating out of
England and are involved in a few businesses from distibuting to
tech support to general computer solutions for large companies in England.
They do have a web page too. They are porjected to earn .42 cents next year and
have about .75 to
$1/share in cash depending on how you calculate shares. The did a
secondary this summer at 6 in which a lot of funds bought in. Revenue
growth has been spectacular through acquisitions but earnings have been spotty.
The only thing
that worries me is consistent insider sales though not in huge blocks.

How low can this go? I did get in a few weeks back at 3 1/4.

Comments would be appreciated.

Yours

How about a package: MTY, MDCD, FFST? They have some interesting common
features:

MTY 200 employees 28M in rev. $3.75 /sh trade shows

MDCD 88 employees 26M in rev. $4.2/sh cd-rom mfger.

FFST 174 employees 32M in rev. $3,0/sh wide range of stuff

How do you guys find these things? Or maybe I should ask, after I buy , how
will anybody else find these companies to buy 'em at a higher price? Am amazed
that Yahoo shows three analysts covering FFST (if I saw it right?); MDCD has
more posts than employees!!? For me, at least MTY seems to have a defined
market carved out for itself - although I don't know what the potential growth
is or type of problems entailed in this "industry". Others seem risky on first
glance. Maybe a package - positives are prices low relative to past and plenty
of cash (that they can squander?) -if any new info by others on this thread
I'll look closer. Otherwise pass, pass, pass. Paul Senior

Short interest changes viewed along with the change in price, predicts the
trend of price movements much more accurately. In other words, change in price
will indicate whether shorts are by customers or MMs.

I will look up the site soon. However, I want to emphasize that we pick
companies to own if their have long term values. Technologies which is not a
flash in the pan, products which will not likely to be replaced by something
better anytime soon, and management who do not run the company into the ground
immediately. These values are not in the Technical Analysis at anytime.

Further more, stock values are capped by the market that specialists and market
makers make. some stock can never penetrate certain values below their worth
because of the operational limitations (cash and stock pools)of these men and
their organizations. Currently, the wealth of the mutual funds limit the funds
only to large cap stocks for their liquidity in the market. And liquidity is
everything.

Knowing these facts today, makes value investing, the top Priority but if you
don't worry about market cap; you are wasting your money.

Huh?

As you have pointed out somewhere else I think, that sometimes, some people
have some problem in understanding what you are saying. This time, this place I
am one of those people. When you say "we pick companies" do you mean "we, the
people on this thread", do you mean "we, my wife and I" , "we, my partners and
I"? If you are saying "we - the people here - " then I say how do you know what
We are doing? Who elected you the spokesperson for what "we" do? And who ever -
ever - on this thread agreed with you about YOUR definition of value. I write
this message to you, because the way I read your post - you are criticizing the
man. He went to the trouble to be helpful, and instead of encouragement - he
gets a lecture. Maybe there's nothing for you in what he offered, but there may
be something for me. So I am upset that you would seem to discourage the man
from adding what could be important information - information that would be
hard to obtain somewhere else. If you don't like what he says - say it - but
don't imply you speak for everyone else. Paul Senior

"We" is used by emporers. But, "We" for Tang, is our people and common sense.
The value investing if pertains to TA or FA, does not imply the true operations
of the company which stock you may own. Unless, you like the products, the
technology and the management; which they describe in their annual report.
Quoted from Peter Lynch.

Small cap and market cap is "what is happening now". Scalding people investing
on small caps? I think not. Small cap not getting anywhere and wasting your
money waiting for something to happen? I think so. Until the market broadens
this year, many people are complaining about their investments in small stocks.

Sorry, Paul.

One of Peter Lynch's 20 Golden Rules in "Beating the Street", pg 304:
"A stock market decline is as routine as a January blizzard in Colorado. If
you're prepared, it can't hurt you. A decline is a great opportunity to pick up
bargains left behind by investors who are fleeing the storm in panic."

IMHO, in other words, it's called a buying opportunity in selected small caps.

My opinion only.

Good trading.

Here is a great value stock: HIAI.

Another, stock I would like to mention is HIA, Inc. (OTC BB: HIAI). This
company is located in
Colorado, and they distribute, and install industrial, and commercial outdoor
sprinkler systems. They
serve Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Wyoming, and Nebraska As you know, lots of
people are
moving west to these areas. In 1995 they did $14.5 million, earning $0.03 EPS.
For the first 6
months of FY 96 they did $7 million and $0.05 EPS. My estimate is that for FY96
they will do $16
million in sales and earn $0.05. There are only 9.5 million shares out, the
company has been buying
back stock, and has about 2.5 million shares in the treasury, of which they
plan to retire one million.
The float is about 2 million shares. Book value is about $0.30. The stock is
trading at about $0.20.
Here you have a stock that's trading at about 4X EPS! The company is in a
growth mode -
management estimates that in FY 97 they will do $18 million and earn $0.10 EPS.

Hi Gottfried - Long time since we've chatted. I have followed the companies in
the Forbes top 200 list now for a couple of years and have them set up as a
portfolio that I can generate periodic reports for using Zacks tools. The
problem in general that I've had is the high valuations based upon PSRs for
some of these companies. Southern Energy was bombed out quite nicely with the
rest of its peers and if I had cash right now (apr 15 approaches!) I'd
seriously consider buying. Safeskin showed up on somebody else's pan list in
the past 3-6 months because they have a single product and J&J are going to
offer a competing product and they (J&J) have a nice distribution channel.

Anyhow, I buy value wherever that is. Small caps, big caps, technology, smoke
stack industries... I don't really care what it is as long as it is a good
value, a super company with super management and I can understand what the heck
they do. The most recent new stocks I've purchased are CEM Corp (CEMX) and Cohu
(COHU) which just happen to be small caps. They have been rock solid during
these recent weeks of turmoil. So I'd rather take flat over -25% any day. I do
however expect the prices to appreciate nicely as their new production cycles
ramp up.

Jeff

I envy you for being so organized! I've been slugging it out on the Iomega
threads - now there's a value (?). But I also have AMAT for more steadiness
(till the next downturn). Biggest problem is still
WHEN to sell. Sold Micron just before the fall below 40, because I
asked myself 'would you buy it at this level?' - the answer was 'no'.
It must be easier when you have little volatility. Do you regularly beat the
SP500 (or whatever yardstick you use)? Anyway, I lurk on
this thread regularly - may become a convert yet.

And strong increase in cash flow to fuel a buyback in progress. Can't figure
out why so good: It's a competitive business, and I thought - not one with
growth or good margins. Maybe I would have to know more about the industry and

Hi Gottfried - I've refined my stock picking and selling methods over the
years. I used to use NAICs zoning methods but found that the sell zones don't
work for tech stocks. Of course there is a lot of subjectivity that goes into
choosing the zones but I was never able to achieve consistency. So now I use
Fisher's PSR zones for buying and selling and they are pretty broad ranging but
at least I'm getting consistent results picking bottoms for buying and tops for
selling. In general I like glitched tech stocks that have glitched to
reasonably low PSR values. I find myself typically buying on the way down,
sometimes as much as 25% above the low and keep buying until the PSR has moved
considerably higher, but not anywhere close to my sell zones. I will make
anywhere from 3 to 8 purchases depending upon how confident I am in the company
and how long the downturn lasts. The "buys" are tied to price moves. ie. if the
price drops/rises by x %, I will buy more. The "sell" PSRs are computed based
upon historical high PSRs for the company adjusted for its size since the last
high. (Remember PSRs tend to get smaller as a company gets larger) I set a
range to sell.

For example, the last one I made good money on was APCC. My average cost was
around $9.75 and I sold everything at $27. I had a PSR sell range of 4-6 and
sold at a PSR of 4.5 largely because of market sentiment. The price has been
bid up as high as $31 probably on momentum and I had a good idea it wouldn't
last since it made the ascent from $8 to $31 in about 6 months. The stock
subsequently dropped back as low as the low $19s. I didn't beat the S&P last
year largely because I was buying glitched tech stocks some of which were still
on the way down. But this year I'm still up over 10% even with all the carnage.
In past years I've been able to beat the S&P considerably. Some stocks that are
pretty boring I hold for many years because they never reach the "Wall Street
Darling" status so there is not a lot of volitility.

Hope this helps.

Regards
Jeff
