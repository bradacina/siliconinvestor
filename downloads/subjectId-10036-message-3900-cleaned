Bear Thread! Bear Thread! I'm there.

And Mike, you have way too much free time. Don't you sleep?

Now the question is do we have the guts to stick with our position if this
market goes up another 50% and everybody is laughing at us. I am totally
comfortable now, but to avoid temptation I may just prepay my entire car loan
and get the cash away from my potentially itchy trigger finger, and into
something which guarantees a 9% AFTER TAX return. Think about that. A
guaranteed 9% after tax return. When bonds are yielding under 6%. OK, we're in
no-brainer country.

Don't you sleep

No. Something's going to give, and it will likely be
my journalism and web participation. My site will
get a stripped down revision as well.

A guaranteed 9% after tax return

Keep in mind I usually don't mean my money when I say
"I invested." There's really 4 family portfolios that I'm managing.

Personally, I'm up to my ears in med school debt and generally don't
have the cash to invest. In fact, the last time I invested my own
was in late 1996. I took what money I had a that time
and plowed it into a guaranteed 9% by paying off loans - in
retrospect not the right decision.

That said, I've moved the sealpoint portfolio to 26% cash in order
to pay off the last of a 9% mortgage - giving a guaranteed
9% after-tax return. Now it's 100% long stocks again, and I'm looking
for other guaranteed high returns in that portfolio.

The portfolio that owns the prudent bear, is short nike, and
has taken stakes in APF and the India Fund also is long
Ciena, HP, SJP, Deswell, Telebras, Elamex. In other words,
three US longs making up less than 25% of the portfolio. No guaranteed 9%
options available to me in this one. Same goes
for the retirement fund.

My personal accounts? Well, I finally got a lump sum to invest,
and used 2/3 of it to pay off 8-12% debt, and am holding the rest in
a 5% MM account - in my local bank, far from Wall Street.

In other words, that guaranteed 9% is elusive, but I'm jumping on
it where I can. Last time I was this paranoid, the market ignored
me and romped ever upward.

Mike,

IMO - one should be paying more attention to those companies that pay
dividends. Over the next few years there will be a shift from growth stocks to
income as the 'baby boomers' begin retiring. I believe the strength of REITs
and Bond funds to be an indicator that this transition is already taking place.
Investors aren't going to be as impressed by share buybacks that primarily
benefit Insiders. Early entry into growth stocks that pay decent dividends
could be a prudent move. These stocks also seem to be more stable in a market
correction.

Ron
I don't believe you need to worry about a 9%+ return on Deswell with a 5%
dividend and 30%+ growth rate.

Mike. Thanks for trying to clarify. I've not been able to understand what you
are actually doing.. Your SI thread says your "favorite" stocks and they all
look like longs. Your Sealpoint portfolio is cash and "100% longs again". (The
Sealpoint portfolio screen is blank this am. ??) You apparently own no stocks
culled from from the Sealpoint value screen.
Own means manage family portfolios. You yourself own only cash. One portfolio
you manage is 25% US longs and the rest foreign or short. One is 1/3 div, 1/3
foreign, 1/5 small caps -- all bought this week. You "like" SWR( but you sold
it for tax reasons), Adaptec, Jones Med (if it drops 4 points). You are bearish
and are looking for bear candidates (starting a bear thread).

I never meant to lay out a portfolio here, but rather to talk about
valuation and stock ideas, some of which I buy and some of which
I don't.

I have not had a computer all month, so I cannot update
the sealpoint portfolio or anything else on the site. I'm writing this on a
general purpose terminal in the hospital. Re: my SI
favorites, I don't even know what they are - it's been a while.
The retirement fund is all mutual funds, so it isn't so much I entered
all those stocks Monday as it is that I redistributed by selling,
exchanging, and buying over the weekend. I'm certainly not
gonna put myself in a 100% margined position in this market,
which is what I'd be doing if I put my cash in stocks.

Hi Mike: (General comment) I always want to know where people are coming from
in terms of their actual purchases. Makes my eyebrows arch when I read of
purchases with no supporting reason or documentation. Makes me even twinge a
little more when I hear of good suggestions (well documented/supported) but the
author himself/ herself doesn't actually own the darn thing. Or people who
alert us that the sky is falling and it turns out they themselves are fully
invested. Never quite sure how to take or interpret this sort of thing. It's a
paradoxical world I think, so we're going to see this. Just that I personally
am more comfortable when I see people striving for some consistency between
their attitudes/outlook and their actions. (Not that I myself can achieve this

Not meaning to attack or accuse anybody here. Just pushing a little maybe to

The tobacco stocks are falling to another litigation-induced round

Philip Morris has over a 4% yield on a much smaller payout. How

Give the tobaccos a little more rope. They are drifting down now after what
looked like a catharsis two weeks ago which drove MO below 40 and RN below 30.
The guys who bought that bloodbath are now getting nervous. Despite my view on
the market, I would probably start nibbling at Philip Morris at 35-37. (I have
little interest in the others although you could make an even more compelling
value case for any of them - if I'm going to take the risk of tobacco, I want a
great business, and thats Philip Morris.) 35-37 on Philip Morris (thats my
gauge, the other stocks will move too, so if they are the one you want, just
watch MO and that will give you your entry point. But if it drifts to that
level on this kind of news, I would wait. What I want is another catharsis -
another big scare that takes it to 35. Thats when I get in. And steel yourself
now, because whatever takes Philip Morris to 35 will sound so awful that you
won't want to touch it. What I have found very profitable with the tobaccos is
to pick a price 10% below any reasonable target, but when it gets there buy it
no matter what you are thinking. Then when you're getting comfortable owning
tobacco you will be up 30%. Thats when you sell.

I made a lot of money trading in and out of Philip Morris two years ago - buy
on extreme fear, sell on comfort - then sold for a huge profit when everybody
started getting excited about a settlement. I did not trust the governement and
I was right. I caught near the high over a year ago, and am still waiting for
the "fear factor" to get high enough again to get back in. So far, the
sidelines have been the place to be.

earnings of 38%. Finances appear OK and it yields .3%. The ROE is 14.6% and P/S
is .92 and P/B is 3.0. The co. just announced a $5 million share buyback

Well, I certainly could see why all of the weak longs sold their positions
yesterday, but for you guys that have some balls these
are the facts.

1) 555,000 shares were bought buy mutual funds and 1 bank.

that is fact.

2) Org has a meeting planned in an undisclosed location to announce the
marketing of their product.

It is believed to be around 500-700 rooms at a 5 diamond resort.

My guess is that doctors, novartis people, and org people will be their to get
their product off the ground.

3) The 20 million dollar private placement was to give org their independance
and show the public that we are not going to run
out of cash with or without Novartis.

4) If you put up 20 million in cash you sure as hell are going to want your
shares registed for sale, regardless if that is the plan.

5) I listened to the whole meeting on the phone for panel review and although
the vote came in 5-4 it was basically a 9-0 vote.

6) FDA has to act in 120 or less so final approval is in less than one month.

7) 4 News Releases have been prepared by Novartis and Org to Couple the FDA
announcement.

8) My guess is a World Wide Launch, New Facilities, and more Cash from Novartis
to Org along with a bonus annoucement.

9) In all the B.S. I read on this thread there is little mention of the most
important fact in the past 6 months.

LEHMAN WAS HIRED FOR INVESTMENT BANKING.

Did they have anything to do with the 20 million - NO

They are hired for a Merger with Novatis PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

I do not want to toot my own horn, but if you look at each and everyone of my
posts the have been 100% correct.

So if you want to make money buy the stock. It is that simple.

Don't try to pick a top based on fundamentals or charts because they do not
apply to this stock.

Wait until we get Novartis shares and sell those.

This is all I can do for you guys out there so either listen and make money or
be a sorry ass and do what Sturza does Lose
Money.

Allen F.: re. National Auto Credit (NAKD). No, I never did research this
company. Actually, I never before thought about researching NAKD -g-. My basic
investing idea is always to try to repeat what's worked for others. But if
researching nakd is what it takes, then I'll do it -LOL-. Wife says no library
research this time though; I just better stay at home with the windows and
doors closed. Otherwise could get the dogs to howling and the neighbors to
shouting she thinks. -g-.

Allen, I've given up on these sub prime lenders when they go into (or flirt)
with bankruptcy. NAKD (-g- sorry) shows (per Yahoo) very high price to book.
But my Reliance Acceptance -- RACC (now called RACCQ - it's in bankruptcy),
shows the same. RACCQ are going to sell to Ugly Duckling Car Rental (UGLY) and
the stock holders will get warrants for UGLY - small amounts and at high
exercise price. Essentially, somewhere along the line, apparently my RACC $3+
book value margin of safety (even after I allowed for defaults) is gone, and
I've got a 30 cent stock. Just alerting you that my situation could be same for
NAKD.

NAKD and UGLY -- what a combination. LOL! (And if you owned Anheiser Busch in
here)--- Bud ugly and nakd-----Man... okay,okay. Sorry...

Other small players in the industry look weak, but "maybe" okay -- NAFIE or
FIFS. They're way to tough for me to figure out. I still own WES which owns the
majority of WFSI (WFSI is a sub prime lender - also with its difficulties). I
like WES (a regional bank) because of the relatively low p/bv it has compared
to its peers, its business diversification, and its ownership essentially by
one controlling stock holder.

James,

>I have sold 85% of my St. Joe shares in the last two months,
> not entirely because of my market view.

Can you tell why?

Here's my ramblings about SJP's future. It's a cheap
real-estate play assuming real-estate is still on a boom track.
The management will try to get the company going. If they fail,
they may squander company's cash hoard in the process. Is it
possible to notice the failure? Hmmm... They develop the land
into sellable estates and have an infant entertainment division.
It's difficult to check whether they are squandering resources
on development, because that won't show on the valuation records.
(They bought a developper-contractor company, so SJP pays itself
to develop the land, but such deals have perils of vertical
integration and conflict of interest. They also bought a realtor,
which is another vertical integration move.)
It would possibly improve the value of company's land holdings,
but these holdings are on books at 19XX prices anyway. So the ROI
is totally unclear - i.e. they spend $X mln on development and
land value increases by unknown percentage - what's the ROI?
It's even unclear how you decide the valuation increase.
Open market price of X mln. acres of land?

Now SJP's entertainment division is an attempt to get into
theme park business. I have my reservations about the field.
DIS may get profit from DisneyLand, but EuroDisney was a failure.
I don't know if Anheuser-Busch gets much profit from their
theme parks. Golf courses for profit? Hmmm... I am afraid that
it's gonna be an uphill fight.

So in the summary, it would be better if they did
nothing, just sold the whole company or sold parts of the land
that would get good prices now. Owning and developing
real-estate is a lousy business unless you hit Silicon Valley.
If it was an easy and simple call, Buffett (or KKR) would own
half of America. BTW, owning your own house is
different because of tax benefits, reduced renting expenses and
socio-pshychological reasons.

Of course, if they have good timing and come out with
developed estates when real-estate is booming, the stock
may explode. The same would happen if the entertainment division
is successful or successfully hyped. But I would not buy on
these assumptions. I'd rather buy a real growth story -
see my next post. :-)))))

Good luck for all

I am starting an internet business Buck-for-99. I will
sell 1 dollar bills for .99 cents. What a bargain, everyone will
want to get this deal. :-) I will take my company public and
ramp up sales to millions in no time. OK, the company will lose
a little money in the begining, but look at the sales growth. :-)

I estimate that with only 10M of capital I can almost get 1 Bln
of sales. The overhead will be low because I am on the internet
so really you only have to consider my salary, which should be at
a reasonable level for a person of my talents and position as CEO.
That way, the company can attract the best people.

I will have to be quick before other entrepreneurs figure out how
to sell 1 dollar bills for .98 cents. But in that case I will
undercut them by selling for .97 cents. Establishing a market
presence and getting the volume is the key. Profits will come
later. I will cash out my options and retire rich. Sounds like
a good plan? :-) I will let you get in on it early. :-)

James will have to answer for himself, but realize that he has
big gains in this stock, and he bought it when he was the only
one who saw the potential. If you check out his posts on the
Motley Fool boards, he was like the oracle of delphi on this stock
going back the last few years.

When a stock has done everything he thought it'd do, and now
he's counting on management and incremental gains, I can
see why he'd sell.

St. Joe is not now drastically undervalued. But by my calculations
it is at the low end of its net asset value range, with only
upside in every area and very little if any downside. You have to believe in
management. I talked with an officer there, and he made
me a believer. I've also poured over every inch of their SEC filings
in the last two years, and I didn't see anything I didn't like. That's
very rare for me. But if you don't believe in management, it's hard to see the
potential in the stock, even if you see the leverage in
the land and the limited downside.

Mike, couldn't have said it better myself.

St. Joe Corp. When I bought this stock, nobody had ever heard of it except a
bunch of frustrated value investors. I made it the largest position in my
portfolio, then bought more all the way up. We're talking a $21 cost basis in
late 1996. Not including a $3.33 a share cash dividend it kicked out a year
ago. The reason I bought it was that it was a $21 stock with assets worth
$30-35 and a strong catalyst. The catalyst fired, everything went right and the
stock went up to 35 (not including the dividend). A 75% gain in a little over a
year where there was never any risk I saw at the price I paid.

Now it appears as a feature in business magazines, and I just don't see the
upside as clearly as I did before. The investor (one of two instititional
investors in the stock when I bought. Him and Mike Price) who brought this one
to my attention started to sell.
Some value investors I know called me crazy when I told them this would be a
big winner when I bought it. Now the same people question whether I am missing
something. Sounds like a perfect buy and sell for a value investor. Nobody on
this thread was at all interested in this stock when it was a steal - I tried
and tried but never even got a response until it went up. Why are people
interested now? There may still be a lot of money to be made in St. Joe, and I
continue to own a little, but this is not my game.

Hello all,

Just placed an order today to buy Titanium Metals Corp (TIMT).

Besides the good numbers (shown below), the catalyst here was the recent
conference call. I found management to be forthright, even to the degree of
bringing up potential concerns beyond callers' inquiries.

The business is tied to the aeronautics industry, both aerostructures and
engines, which the company expects solid demand for at least several more
years. Have a purchasing agreement with Boeing, and also supply Airbus. Are a
supplier to all major jet engine manufacturers. The company is working to
diversify its business, but fortunes currently lie with jets and jet engines.

In the CC the company mentioned it is expanding capacity in several areas due
to anticipated strong demand, Currently, demand exceeds capacity and the
company is having to send alot of business out of house to fill the need.
Expansions plan to bring this production in house.

The company says it is comfortable with current year EPS estimates in the low
end of the $2.90 to $3.20 range. This would place the stock trading at a
forward PE of around 8.7. Sales per share growth over the past three years has
been 25%+ annually.

Re: RTI, TRE, and TIMT.

Yes, TRE DOES look like a pretty good way to play the titanium business. I
think there's a better margin of safety perhaps with TRE that you get from
valuing all its component parts - and that may be the best way for value
investors.
Just that I am more comfortable with this airframe/engine concentration. I
figure when Boeing starts to produce, TIMT will get the catalyst for a stock
rise. (It will take TRE with it.) I chose TIMT over RTI because, for now, TIMT
is the preferred Boeing supplier (from what I can tell). Some people on the
TIMT thread have covered their bets and bought both (TIMT an RTI).

My information is that Franklin Resources (Templeton Global Advisors) has
increased its position in TIMT in Feb. from 10.7% to 13.2% of stock
outstanding. Also in Feb., a Japanese company, Toho Titanium bought 3.7%. (I
hope they can hold on and don't have to dump it -g-.) About the same time Smith
Barney (Mutual Management) decreased their position in RTI from 9.5% to 5.8%. I
am using all this as a justification here for my purchase of TIMT. And weak
argument that it is, I am still trying to add to my position. I would've
thought I could have got my Sunday night limit order at 24 3/4 filled --it was
only a little below Fri.'s close -- on a day like today. But I guess with S.
Milburn's purchase order propping the stock, I didn't have a chance. -g-.

Heard a wonderful example of the kind of thought propping up this market on
CNN's Moneyline tonight. The daily guru, reading from the buy on the dips
script, said something like this:

"Yeah, we expect a correction of 10% or so, so just hang on to your stocks and
you should have some great buying opportunities in a couple weeks..."

Hmm. So you expect a decline from here, but you wouldn't advise somebody to
sell anything, even in a nontaxable retirement fund? That sounds pretty stupid.

And when you see those great buying opportunties in a couple weeks...what are
you gonna buy it with?

I have said this before and I will say it again - if nobody is holding cash,
the dips ain't gonna get bought. And the conventional wisdom tells everybody
two things - 1) buy dips and 2) don't hold cash. That dog don't hunt. One of
these times I'm going to be right.

And yet another sign of a market top. Viagra. When every business publication
has the word "erection" in it five times or more, its probably time to sell
some stocks.

HA, HA! But the valuation on PFE, partly because of Viagra, does make a point
closer to home about overvaluation. Sixty times earnings in a large cap stock
reminds me of the "nifty-fifty" 30 years ago.

My difficulty with this market is that I can find a lot of smaller cap stocks
that offer good (not great) value and have not done much. Is this going to be
the one bull market that I can remember that ends with a lot of stocks selling
at reasonable prices? Even a large cap stock like GM is not expensive.

I also see a fair amount of inertia to changing retirement account asset
allocations. Therefore, I would guess that the next bear market
may be a multi-step affair with fairly long intermediate rallies.
(When the selling by active investors temporarily exhausts itself, the constant
buying by passive investors will reassert itself.)

Scott,

RTI had not fallen through my screens for consideration. One of the
requirements I have on the stocks I look at is positive sales per share growth
for 3 most recent years and 12mm. RTI had massive negative SPS declines in time
periods two and three years ago (37% and 79% declines respectively).

With the exception of this criterion, I believe RTI would have deserved more of
my attention.

I believe I use a more quantitative approach than most here on the value
thread. I have a fairly restrictive screen that has produced good historical
returns over the past several years to limit me to perhaps 20 or so investment
possibilities, and then I use my limited time to look into those options. I
have to count on the screen to do alot of the work for me.

Listening to the conference call helped convince me on TIMT. If aerospace
demand remains strong as is expected, TIMT should do well given its dominant
position in engines and its purchasing agreement from Boeing. That's the story
that I've bought on TIMT; hopefully things will play out.

James, you seem to have put a lot of thought into the
tobacco stocks. You really like MO, and heck, at 37, I like
MO. But you don't seem to mention UST much. It's approaching
a 6% dividend, albeit with a 2/3 payout. But is that dividend in
danger? If not, it's hard to imagine that the stock could fall much
further, and in any case you get a 30- year bond rate for holding.
And it has 1/4 the debt load of MO.

I need to look at it further. I was early with Swisher, no doubt. But
MO held up well even during 72-74, and I'm interested in that
kind of stock. Tobacco is just so hated now I'd like to play it -
at the right time and in the right stocks. Any further insight you
have is appreciated.

BTW, there is a new drug out, called Zyban. It helps people
quit smoking and it really works. A pill that gets people off
cigarettes. It's really a double dose of the anti-depressant
Wellbutrin (generic: buproprion). There's a lot of potential here,
and I have requests for it from many of my patients. Long-term,
I wonder about the impact on the efficacy of smoking cessation
programs.

I know some of the people who did the Wellbutrin studies. They believe in it. I
was concerned about the typical antidepressant side effects. Note that there is
a big TV ad campaign right now. Have you given any prescriptions for it? If so,
is there OK patient acceptance without lots of theraputic support? My sense
from the study people was that support group was a key.

I know Wall Street has a stiffy for Viagra, but I would question whether it is

MO and UST not as good an idea as RN (RJR Nabisco). Here's why: with bonds of
bankrupt companies, you make the most money by buying the lowest priority bond
that is likely to get any payout. Quality is low, but not too low (you hope),
but the price is highly discounted. MO is the quality company, but you won't
make as much as on RN. Less than book, half sales, div. of 7%+, and a potential
spinoff of Nabisco. So be brave, buy the lower quality company, and pray it
survives (it will). The total return will make the extra risk worth it.

Joe Sixer: re: easing of titanium crunch.

Need some clarification. You see this as a neg. or pos. for TIMT?
TIMT processes the stuff, so they'll just continue doing that profitably I
hope, and pass on the overall lower cost to Boeing/Airbus/etc. Or maybe because
Ti will get cheaper/more available - TIMT will find other uses for it? Or maybe
other processing co's (CYX, PD,etc.) will be able to now get access to the raw
material and compete with TIMT? That wouldn't be so good for TIMT shareholders
-g-. TIMT has a long term fixed-price supply contract from Kazakhstan. Hard for

Robert Hoefer: Well, don't buy any more of it (OLS).

At least until I get some in the 12 dollar range. Stock is dropping maybe
because of the Fed's investigating OLS for illegal billing/Medicare?/Medicaid?
practices with Columbia. They may be getting ready to indict some OLS
employees. It's now that I see such news articles of the past few days
(ref.Yahoo OLS - news). Of course, the big overarching problem -- the big foray
into home health care and Medicare, this gov't stuff--- that's been very
unsuccessful IMO.

Robert, let's try this on for a fit -g-:
When OLS came out in '92 (looking at Yahoo chart here), if you owned OLS you
could have sold your shares in the $15 dollar range. And in '93, maybe at $18
or $19. The stock was there. And sometime in '94, '95, '96, and '97 you had a
chance to sell at $20. So if history repeats - and there's certainly no reason
it should - times and problems are different today -- nevertheless (that's a
heck of a "nevertheless") there's still a good shot IMO that we'll see $20
again in '98 and/or '99. That would be 7 points up from the 13 it's at now.
That sir is a good gain, and an achievable goal IMO. (Although as I say, I've
been wrong many, many times before.) Oh the low side exists too. They could go
bankrupt I suppose. And if I bet my house on OLS here, for some reason they
would crater to .25 -g-. So I won't -g-. I think OLS will muddle through.
If it ever does see 20, maybe somebody will puleez come back to me and tell me
to sell some. In '97 I owned it from from 17 and below I think, and I watched
it get up in the 20's and drop back to current point. (I've not sold any OLS.)
This next time - if there is a next time - I would like to take some profits

I don't think the investigation is much to worry about, in fact if some bad

passed. You know how turnarounds always take about 3 times as long as you
thought they would, and it's tempting to sell in relief at the first surge of
the rebound, which in most cases is a mistake. If you focus on the financials
instead of the "story," you are less likely to be fooled. The financials say
this company will sell in the high 20's within a year. This is still a
profitable company, health care is the smaller part of the business, and the IT
part is growing very fast. It's like those darn oil drillers/oil services

Titanium Supply
Just a bit of news I remembered reading a week or so ago - FWIW.
> Need some clarification. You see this as a neg. or pos. for TIMT? <
Depends on what the business is. At first blush if you are a supplier of raw
materials it would be negative. If you are a manufacturer of finished goods a
positive. Do not have a position in the industry and not that familiar with
your company.
A lot of facts would have to be gathered to answer your question. How much has
the govt. stockpiled? What form is it in - ore, billets or whatever? What is
the demand? If TIMT's long term fixed rate contracts are for materials in the
form the govt. would be disbursing - perhaps not so good.

You're asking the wrong guy whether its a positive or negative. I'm a lousy
analyst. I can barely read a balance sheet, hence the handle. My stock picking
would be better relegated to throwing darts at a board. All my friends use me
as a contrarian indicator. I get no respect. I'm up to my eyeballs in MO and
before this is all over may well wish I had titanium as opposed to tobacco.

- This is an internet stock which actually makes money.
- CHKPF firewall sales split about 50% on Unix, 50% on Win NT.
- Stock price slammed lately, to as low as $29 today, partially due to a single
comment from Microsoft's Ballmer, saying that MSFT plans to beef up their Proxy

Globaltech (GAI) seems to me to be a great value opportunity.

The stock is currently trading at $19, I believe at a minimum it should be
trading in the
low 30's. The company was taken public in an IPO about 3 weeks ago so is still
relatively undiscovered. Following is a brief description of the business and
my tartget
price rationale:

Valuation:

Sales 3/31/97: $62.7mm; Sales 3/31/98: $116.7mm (86% growth); Analyst Estimate
Sales 3/31/99: $165.2mm (42% growth - I believe these numbers are too low).
Apparantly, analyst estimates from the IPO roadshow are $1.70 EPS CY 1998 and
$2.25 CY 1999, or growth of 33%. At $19/share, this company has an 11 P/E and
is
growing at 33% using the analyst estimates for earnings this year (which I
believe to be
very conservative as they are with many new public companies). Its PEG ratio is
therefore on 33%. Globaltech's best public comparable is
a company called Windmere Durable Holdings (WND). It trades at a P/E of 18x CY
1998 earnings at its current price of $25/share. Windmere is growing sales and
earnings
in the 20%-25% range. Globaltech is growing significantly faster and has a
better
business model with its original design capability (described below), so at a
minimum
should get at least an equivalent P/E. At 18x P/E, Globaltech trades up to $31,
63%
appreciation from its current price. If it were to trade at a 25 P/E, a 25%
discount to
what I believe to be its conservative analyst estimated growth rate of 33% in
earnings,
Globaltech would trade up to $42.50, 123% appreciation from its current price.

Business Description:

Globaltech is an orignal design manufacturer (ODM) focused on the consumer
products
industry (as opposed to the more traditional CEM's). What this means is that
Globaltech
designs and builds finished products for an OEM as opposed to the typical
contract
manufacturer which only builds (although there is tremendous engineering
value-added
here too) product. Globaltech's product line is focused on the high-end of the
consumer
segment and includes things like breadmaker's and foodsteamer's. All of
Globaltech's
manufacturing is located in China, so they are very low cost, and in
combination with
their orignal design capability and rapid manufacturing process, offer a huge
value
proposition to OEM's (as indicated by their 25% gross margins vs. 10% for a
typical
contract manufacturer).

Here is evidence of the value proposition: Sales 3/31/97: $62.7mm; Sales
3/31/98:
$116.7mm (86% growth); Analyst Estimate Sales 3/31/99: $165.2mm (42% growth - I
believe these numbers are too low). The reason Globaltech is growing so fast is
three-fold:
1) They are much lower cost than American and European OEMs. Unlike the typical
electronics OEMS, many consumer products OEMs still have very high cost captive
domestic manufacturing. Globaltech can do things at about half the cost of the
typical
OEM
2) Rapid new product design and introduction capability. Many OEMs are
ponderous,
and have long product design in introduction cycles. Because of this, they
often fail to
capitalize of hot consumer trends because they can not get product to market
quickly
enough.
3) The marketspace for what Globaltech does is huge.

Here is the bad news on the company, which is why I think the IPO has not
traded up
significantly. Sunbeam will account for in the neighborhood of 35% of sales
this year.
Although Sunbeam is somewhat of a concern, here are some important facts to
consider.

1) The comapny was taken public after the Sunbeam debacle, and management and
the
underwriters were comfortable with the issue
2) Most of Sunbeam's problems have to do with gas grills, which is what they
stuffed
the channel with to inflate their sales numbers. The products Gloabaltech makes
for
them are things like breadmakers and foodsteamers, so not the things causing
Sunbeam
grief.
3) Sunbeam has already gutted their organization internally both in terms of
production
capability and new product design/and introduction capability so they will need
to rely
on Globaltech to help them continue to grow their business
4) Nearly all of Globaltech's growth will come from customer's other than
Sunbeam, so
Sunbeam should decrease as a percentage of sales over time. Other key
Globaltech
customers include Black&Decker, Mr. Coffee, Moulinex, Krups, Procter-Silex,
Welbilt, Revlon, and Hamilton Beach.

Conclusion:

I believe that Globaltech has a truly unique capability and offers a strong
value
proposition to a large marketspace. I think the IPO has not traded up
significantly due
to all the overhang from Sunbeam (which is a legitimate concern), and has now
fallen off
of people's radar screens, which has created a great buying opportunity. I
believe the
Sunbeam issue is completely misunderstood by Wall Street for the reasons
mentioned
above. Once Globaltech begins to report their numbers, and things turn out
fine, people
will begin to take notice. The sock is trading at such a significant discount
to its growth
rate that the value will be too compelling for people to ignore. If it turns
out that anlaysts
estimates are too low (which I believe they are), and Globaltech starts beating
earnings
estimates, this stock will be all over everybody's radar screen. A stock
trading at an 11x
P/E growing at 40% should attract a lot of attention.

My opinion.

- Profit margins excellent and increasing
- Focus expanded beyond firewalls to virtual private networks (VPN)

- Explosive internet growth requires security products at ISP's, etc.
- 50% of CHKPF sales are on non-WinNT (i.e. non-MSFT) systems.

- Slow revenue growth in most recent quarter of 4% over previous qtr.
- No margin of safety with PSR of 10
- Firewalls may be in danger of becoming a commodity product
- Titans are interested in CHKPF's market (CSCO, MSFT, etc.)
- Many other security companies trying to build a complete VPN or
security solution (AXNT, Net. Assoc., etc.)

Conclusion: While there is substantial risk with little or no
downside protection (hey, it's a software company), this stock
appears to be significantly undervalued at $29-3/8.

Any comments?

Uh, yeah, kinda figured that was the response I'd get, showing up at the value

On a value note, CNSO (Conso Products Co.) is a local stock I bought six months
ago which received a good writeup in Barron's a couple weeks ago as a great
value candidate. It is quickly falling back from its "Barrons bounce", so in a
few more weeks you may be able to pick it up for around 7.5 to 8 again (went to
11, now below 9).

I'll do a decent posting on CNSO if it falls back to el cheapo land.

Yippiddeedoodah Yippiddeeday what a wonderful day.
Man oh man, I logged into my yahoo portfolio, saw
that yahoo had messed up again. How cruel. But Schwab
confirms it. Go Hyde! I had said I would re-evaluate at
5. I did and held. Next I was going to reevaluate at
6. Gotta review the info. Looks good.

BTW, Paul thanks for getting me into TIMT at a short-term
bottom. I also bought this week YPF down at around 33 1/2, now
35. It's one of the cheapest oils around. I've been searching
high and low for a good way to play oil, and Bloomberg gave
it to me. YPF is the Argentinian conglomerate. Stock has
been battered by the oil prices, but it has a good dividend
and will definitely rebound when oil does. To be truthful,
I cut my Telebras position in half in order to buy YPF. Not
that I dislike Telebras at all, but I'm not going to
overconcentrate in Latin America, and at current prices I like
them equally well.

Another BTW, I'm reading Dreman's latest, Contrarian Investment

Just sold my HYDEA at 6. A nice surprise. It goes to show something I like to
say. When you buy a business for half what its worth, all the surprises tend to
be good ones.

I didn't see anything spectacular in the earnings report. All it said to me was
that these guys are on track to make 40-50 cents this year, and Saucony sales
are growing in a very poor athletic footwear environment. If Merck or Microsoft
had released similar numbers, their stocks would have tanked. The stock was
just so cheap that a move to 6 was simply acknowledgement that this is a real
business.

Maybe it goes to 9 or 10, maybe it doesn't. With such a small float, who knows.
I sold because it reached my target price of net/net value. I didn't invest in
this for the business fundamentals. I thought twice about selling at a
valuation that I would normally see as a buy, but that was greed talking. I've
got my 45% gain in a much shorter time than I was willing to be patient, so if
it goes higher I have no regrets. Especially because I had a relatively big bet
on this one. Hesitate to say "bet" because I do not think I was taking a bit of
risk. That was why HYDEA was one of the few stocks I held onto as I have been
liquidating based on the market valuation level.

Scott: re: HYDE, NOR, APPB. HYDE got a lot of publicity here I think because
many bought the product, or HYDEA at least had a product -g- (and an
understandable one!). And although it was a net-net, a case could (maybe) be
made for buying in as a turnaround, growth, entering new businesses phase. (I
only bought for net-net; I sold out today also because I can't see where real
value is much higher than current value. Not to say it isn't there, or that the
stock won't go ever higher--- just that for me, I can't see now. Possibly too,
I'm so excited I have a net-net that's worked out, that I'm anxious to take my
profit. (They really do seem to take a long time to work out IMO, and it's not
all so certain that they will; I think we were lucky with HYDE or we're in a
bull market -g-)

I post this to you, because I see - in retrospect of course -g- that you
yourself have a pretty good winner IMO with NOR.to which you've mentioned here,
and which was discussed here. That one possibly did not get my buy because 1) I
couldn't find enough USA info. on it, 2)I couldn't confirm the favorable news
article, 2)I wasn't confident enough about the company business. Still, for
someone with some confidence and patience, it does seem (now of course -g-) to
have been a very good, almost obvious, bet to have made.

Not sure if it was you, but somebody posted briefly on APPB when it was at its
lows. That was a very good call also I see.

I still think there are plenty of good stocks out there for value investors.
For me, it's just sometimes hard to see them when they are at buy points -g-.

usually take many small positions so this is out of character for me, but oils
are fairly easy to value, and when you can throw a good track record in, there

Robert H.: Thanks, I'll look at RN. It's scary -g-. Still more bad news on OLS
(S&P Watch Negative). But I still see value:

Just roughly, there are 80M shares of OLS out. If OLS were to sell at the same
psr as Manpower (I don't know why MP or why psr, I just happened to think of MP
for a comp. in this way.) OLS would have sales in this or related business I
think at 600 M this quarter (per recent OLS report) x 4 quarters or $2.4
billion. Manpower PSR about .5 (.47 per Yahoo) which suggests that without all
the troublesome healthcare stuff: (.5 x 2.4B)/80M or $15 dollars per share.
That is, if OLS were priced in this way like MP, OLS would sell for $15. The
troublesome stuff has quarterly sales declining from 493 to 408M (That's some
trouble!! -g-). But that trouble IS a $billion plus business (for now
anyway-g-). Not sure what a money-losing billion dollar business is worth. How
about $160M with the buyer putting up just 80M cash? That'd still be another
$2/sh to OLS. So in this way, I still think OLS is a 15+2= $17 stock. That'd be
very conservative, I hope -g-. JMO, and I've been wrong many, many times

Hyde boring? Yeah, snooze all the way to the bank. Actually I find nothing
boring about a net-net. The mere fact that one can exist in today's (well,
yesterday's) market just fascinates me.

One of the important lessons of Peter Lynch's books is that boring is good. It
is just so hard to hold these stocks for the period it takes for the payoff
when you are constantly bombarded with new and exciting ideas. I found a way to
do that which works for me. I honestly get excited about a business precisely
because it is boring. Read Lynch and you'll see what I mean, but its got to be
intuitive. Looking back, I have lost money on exciting businesses but my
biggest winners have been the most boring mundane stories. Hint for St. Joe
fans - when they get exciting, sell them.

You want to talk boring? I am visiting a company in Portland next week that
produces steel pipe. Large diameter steel pipe, small diameter steel
pipe...even medium diameter steel pipe. I can't think of a more boring
business. Northwest Pipe - it even has a boring name. That tells me its worth a

Congrats Mike on Hyde. I failed to invest because of lack of liquidity and a

owned it now for close to 3 years, and still currently trades at a significant
PE discount to the other big oils. Perhaps it shouldn't trade at quite as high
a multiple as the other big petros, but it still appears cheap. Nice to see

So that's Jan Bell (JBM) and
Hyde - the only two decent net nets
that I've found in the last few years,
and they've both appreciated. The
catalyst was restructuring the business
in both cases, and both may go on
to post incredible returns for all we
know, though both meet Graham's criteria
for selling at this point.

So when the last decent net net disappears

When the last decent net net appears is that the end of the bull?, Mike
posited.

I think Mike would agree with me on this one. Let me express it this way. The
fact that net-nets exist now tells me that there are two markets. It makes me
think of the movie Titanic. There are the vast majority of stocks up there in
first class, and then there are these precious few (I can count them on my
fingers today) down in third class. (If you've seen the movie, you know that
the fun party was with the Irish guys in third class.) And even if you missed
the movie, you know where the ship is now, so I think you all know where I'm
going with this metaphor... The only difference is that I think on this doomed
ship third class will be the ones who get the lifeboats. The guys in the
internet stocks are going to be the ones begging from behind the iron bars as
the last lifeboat leaves.

The HYDEAs of this world are extremely rare. I can find one of them every 8
months or so, and I am looking hard. Not just for net nets, but for either
extreme net nets (greater than a 40% margin of safety) or ones with a
catalyst). I look at every net-net I hear of or discover in a screen and reject
90% of them. After selling HYDE yesterday I looked back on the last three years
and was pleased to discover that I have never made less than 40% within a year
on one of these. It normally takes six months. The problem is that they are so
rare. If I could find ten HYDEAs I would be investing on margin, rather than
60% in cash. I can't, though.

Since these companies are so small, they are below the radar screen of all but
a handful of institutional investors. Therefore, I do not believe they have
anything to do with market valuation. In my experience, they do not drop even
when the market takes a big hit. I think I remember HYDEA not doing anything
when the market dropped 550 points last October. Microcap net-nets I see as a
way to test my stockpicking ability in what I believe is a market with the odds
stacked impossibly against me.

I am working on another microcap net-net which I will post in a couple days.
Just need to check a few more things out. I'll look forward to all of your
comments.

Just remember, though, when Ben Graham did his writing, the net-nets he was
talking about were companies you had heard of. If we could understand the
market Ben Graham was seeing through our eyes today, he was seeing General
Motors at 8, Intel at 15 and Caterpillar at 5. The market dropped 87% from a
peak lower on P/E than the peak today. 87%! That means Caterpillar at 5. That
is what is so tough about applying Graham's wisdom - he was not talking about
microcaps in awful businesses at net-net valuations. He was talking about
buying Caterpillar at net-net valuations. The thought process is completely
relevant, but I have no doubt that Graham would be 90% in cash today.

[And for those newcomers wondering what a "net-net" is. A "net-net" is a
cheapskate's (aka a real value investor's) dream, a stock trading at less than
current assets minus all liabilities. In English, that means the business is
free. You are paying for the company's cash and receivables and inventories and
getting everything else (factories, brand name, real estate, sales contracts,
etc.) for free. I refer you to Ben Graham's classic work, The Intelligent
Investor, to learn more.]

I have looked at Boston Chicken several times and rejected it each time, which
were good decisions in hindsight. Before you start comping its multiples to
other restaurants and to the S&P, you'd better make sure you understand the
accounting, which is very different from other restaurant stocks. What is on
the books as assets are some sort of obligation of franchises. If the
restaurants don't make money, those assets could be worth zero. That is VERY
different from a company that owns real estate. If the business conducted in
those properties fails, at least the real estate is still worth its book value.
Be very careful on this one. A lot of value investors have gotten clobbered
already. Go to a Boston Chicken and enjoy the good food, but then look out the
window and tell me how many other fast food restaurants you see. In my
experience, its usually at least a couple. This was a hot concept and Boston
Chicken executed well, but they are in an industry with virtually no barriers
to entry. The real shame should be on institutions who bought this stock at the
peak. I cannot imagine what they were thinking.

I agree with Wright S. Based on future earnings Chkpf is undervalued. Many

I said a couple months ago when AOL was at 115 pre split that they were a great
value and a lot of the risk had been taken out of the stock.. 15 million

Judge: Well then, I AM surprised that someone else here is calling CHKPF
undervalued.
Am I seeing these Yahoo numbers right -- price to book of 16; price to sales of
21?? It's a Billion dollar market cap company and it's got 49 employees?? You
mean to say these 49 people are so smart and so firstest-with-the-mostest that
any other company trying to get into this lucrative (apparently) business with
100 or 150 good people devoted to it, could not come in and take some of this
great business away from them? Or just hire away about 7 CHKPF people to repeat
what they did?

I don't see ATML as a value either. Nor did I see AOL.

I think you're very wrong for believing they're value based. But then again, I
must be crazy for thinking that, because so many people are buying AOL and
others of their ilk. And regardless of what I think, the stocks are up, and you
are making money.
I think with AOL, it's new investors who follow Peter Lynch - buy what you
know. Lots and Lots of these people are with AOL. They like it, they know it,
so why not buy some. Or mutual fund managers are comfortable having people see
that popular name in their portfolios. That's all pushing the stock up IMO.
With CHKPF, you get these 4.1/2 gains as either short covering or a rush to buy
in up market. Again per Yahoo, there're 36M sh. of CHKPF outstanding with a
float of only 7.5M -- and today the volume count was 2.6M.
In my opinion, none of this makes any difference. If you've bought right,
you're making tons of money. So congratulations (said with gritting teeth -g-).

And maybe that's what everyone should have been doing. Buying Yahoo, AOL, DELL.
All the popular stuff. (Maybe it's not too late...GNET for Silicon Investors
-g-.) Sorry I wasn't along for the ride with any of these even for just a small
amount. In hindsight, it would've been great. But if the market went the other
way, or somebody I never heard of cut earnings estimates and the stock dropped
50%, I wouldn't have a clue as to what fair value was, and I'd never have the
courage to hang on or buy more. Paul Senior

the stock is in the S&P 500, so monies are directed into it (somewhat) by index
funds (although this doesn't seem to have kept YELL from going to its lows
-g-). Size of company - they are big - works in its favor (geographical
divers.) too.

These trucking companies are tough because timing is important. Very cyclical
depending on economy, plus lots and lots of competition, plus hard for any
company to distinguish itself. So while numbers - fin. ratios look good now,
they can turn oh-so quickly.

plus a business for $8 1/4. Sounds good to me.
