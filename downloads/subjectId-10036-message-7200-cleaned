<<I think that the Gorilla Game describes history well. Applicability to the
future, well... >>
For 'Gorilla Game' one could substitute Buffettology, Value investing, "What
Works on Wall Street" and virtually any other method that has shown itself to
be useful for a time...even a long time. And these are certainly times that
test time-tested methods.
One of the most costly mistakes an investor can make is to apply historical
periods and methods as templates to situations that appear similar but differ
in important ways [Accounts of the 87 crash were repleat with templates of 29
overlaying nearly identical chart patterns to 'prove' the inevitability of
collapse]. But a worse error, IMO, is to ignore perspective that methods like
Buffett's and Gorilla provide to analyzing the value or competitive context of
a situation. My earlier suggestion on reading Gorilla was about that, not an
absolute assurance that AAPL was toast due to Microsoft's dominance. It
probably is, and I personally wouldn't bet on it. But I haven't studied it
closely since having it breifly on my 'to short' list [I didn't].

BTW: Did you get that file I sent on EVA research?

I guess the gorilla game makes sense to some extent some people perform better
than others, and frequently in a business the leader makes the bulk of the
profits, unless it is an Amazon. HOwever it seems to me that technology changes
with each cycle and there is no guaranty that the leader in one cycle will be
the leader in the next cycle, a company can rise again from oblivion with a
great product in its next cycle. Microsoft may be broken up yet! I am now and
have been playing technology stocks that have poor current results but
promising technology coupled with stakes in other tech companies that are not
IMHO reflected in their market values. Specifically VOCL and ALSC. VOCL has yet
to turn a profit but it has signed agreements for a 14 city trial with China
TELECOM. SHort term risk is mitigated by $3 in cash and a significant stake in
IXTC a private company currently owned by ATT, VOCL, among others and headed by
TOm Evelsin, formerly of ATT. Only a matter of time before this one goes
public.

ALSC, Alliance semiconductor, has stakes in Broadcom and a couple of Taiwanese
foundries. Not sure about their products but they seem to make some pretty good
investments which I estimate are worth double the current market price.

FOr straight value seekers there is always Deswell. I added today and am happy
with my 8% dividend as I wait for its inexorable rise to a realistic share

Bob,

I guess to me the GG is based upon something much different than Graham's or
Buffett's teaching, with a much shorter historical foundation. As to how many
tech investors have read it, I'd say a
good number have probably become familiar with it. Non tech investors and tech
speculators maybe not.

Re: AAPL, only time will tell who wins this argument. Me and the newbie or the
the rest of most of this thread and visitors to my site who've e-mailed me to
tell me how AAPL could never be a value stock and definitely should not be a
long-term hold. A good analyst friend even sent me a 6 page report outlining
the bear case. I still don't agree.

Re: EVA, I did get the file; thank you. I also came across some of Buffett's
discussion of EVA. I am bothered as he is by the tenet of estimating a cost of
equity using EM-based CAPM, and the debt issue. Buffett has said before
something like that the margin of safety should be so large that one shouldn't
have to carry it out to the nth decimal point. Maybe I too should just set my
hurdle rate for would-be Buffett-like investments, and leave it at that, and
continue to also use my other measures. Still working on this concept.

My principle on Oracle is that they are well-positioned to continue earning
high ROE/ROIC. Over the last 10 years, they've steadily grown profits, book
value, and maintained a ROE on average of about 32%. Return on Capital sits up
around 30% on average. So at a recent PE of about 30 (in the lower half of its
five-year range), the company still looks to return between 25% and 35%
compounded annually. There's a big margin of safety there, but only IF you
think it can continue to earn these types of returns. I've become convinced
that despite some likely turmoil this year, it can. It has hit big turmoil
twice before and recovered well to the same range of returns.

***sortof off topic I guess***

I'm a big GG fan, but I don't see that holding AAPL runs contrary to GG
principles. AAPL still holds an impressive position in niche markets such as
graphic design, desktop publishing, etc. It will likely be difficult to unseat
in those areas, and will provide them with a base from which to launch an
assault on other areas of computing.

AAPL also controls its standards (proprietary hardware and OS) more fully than
the PC world in general. This allows them to offer greater simplicity and
compatability (anyone who's added a peripherial(sp?) to a windows systems
likely knows the fear of compatibility issues). The simplicity is a big plus as
computers penetrate the market to a greater degree - with many of these
customers wanting primarily 1) easy internet access for browsing and 2) e-mail.
The internet is the killer app, and Apple still benefits from its reputation of
being easier to use. Design control has its advantages.

Re: EVA ... I am bothered ... by ... estimating a cost of equity using EM-based
CAPM, and the debt issue

I've never formally studied EVA, though I have run across it in a number of
places. So if I appear to grossly misunderstand what EVA is all about, you now
know why ;-)

It (EVA) initially appealed to me, though after reflection it seems to come up
short of being something truly earthshaking. My take on it is that it attempts
to perform some sort of rational analysis of a business' returns, making
adjustments to regular GAAP measures in the process. The basic idea of having a
rational approach, and using an understanding of what's *really* going on
inside a real live business (and adjusting your interpretation of GAAP figures
accordingly), is the central inspirational point that I have gleaned from each
of Graham and Buffett.

The thing about EVA that stuck in my craw was that it sets a "required return
on equity", and then determines whether the company earns its cost of equity
capital, falls short, or exceeds it. I guessed that EVA's methodology of
computing "required ROE" was something like Mike described (based on market
conditions, risk free rate, volatility, debt-equity ratio, etc, etc).

Instead of doing this, my approach would be simply to use the EVA-type analysis
to determine the total return on equity. A separate methodology or judgement
process would then decide, given the nature of the business, its capital
structure, the risk free rate, etc, whether or not such a level of return was
acceptable. Intangible aspects, such as certainty of earnings, durability of
earnings, barriers to entry, growth opportunities (typical Buffett stuff)
should of course be incorporated into the more sophisticated analyses of
whether or not a given ROE represents the company "earning a proper return on
equity capital invested".

Case is a buy. A 14% return in six months is nothing to sneeze at. I figure the
probability of the deal happening is north of 80%, and the downside in Case
stock if the deal doesn't happen...that's a tough one, but I figure I could get
out at 40 worst case. So at 48, the calculation would be:

20% * -7 points of downside + 80% * 7 points of upside = 4.2 point expected
return.
That's about a 9% expected return in 6 months...nearly 20% annualized, and
without market risk. I'll take that.

CLZR is growing 20% Q/Q (or 100% Y/Y),
p/e is 15 (past Q eps of 31 cents fully taxed x 4 = 1.24/sh/year),
Growth is due to the new product cycle that began Summer 1998,
note company is on June FY,
company announced secondary offering w/ Needham a week ago,
road show June 1999.
Company has $8m in cash w/ no debt.
Revenue is running at about $60m per year (last Q x4).
DSO and inventory trends are fine.
Company is not discovered yet at $100m market cap. (stock has just jumped up,
again, recently)

Given run-rate p/e of 15 and run-rate growth rate (top line and bottom line) of
20% *sequentially* (or 100% annualized), this stock should be valued at over
$30/sh easily.

Thanks, Bob. COO is a wonderful example of how INEFFICIENT the market is. The
company missed two quarters in a row primarily because of
TEMPORARY earnings problems related to shifting global manufacturing of
products around. There were also fears of adverse impact of new players in
their markets, where they are a market leader -- unrealized to date.

The stock also points out another problem that we have in these small cap
stocks that Mike knows about on NH. On the way down from $52, I started buying
more COO in the low 20's and bought small amounts many times all the way down
to $13. But I did not buy as much as I could have partly because after a while
it is very tough emotionally to keep going when the market keeps pounding you.

Jeffrey, re. COO. My take on past events is different.

I bought COO after you brought it to the attention of this thread and after I
ran my screening ratios - and concomittantly because of your involvement and
study of the company. Now I own COO at a profit. So thank you. Yes!

I think at current prices it's a risky stock. My eye-doc who buys their
products, says they are in a very competitive business. But I again and still,
defer to your expertise that they are market leaders.

My recollection is that you were not so confident months back as your last post
here suggests. I think you were VERY upset that, as I recall, you had just
recently talked with management and yet, quite soon thereafter, they blindsided
you - and everyone else - with their earnings announcement and/or outlook. I
think I recall you then posting on Yahoo that you had absolutely lost faith in
the management and/or would not recommend the stock. I almost sold at that
point. In other words, for me, I certainly back then, do not recall any
postings by anybody that the problems COO had were temporary, due to shifting
manufacturing, and likely (as I infer from your last post) to be resolved to
the benefit of patient investors.

But my numbers still looked okay to me, my position was small, and I didn't see
you say you were actually selling, so I stayed the course (too). It just wasn't
easy, simple, or obvious to me. And as regards COO now, it still isn't (for me

Paul, your comments on COO are fair. I have talked with mgmt many times. I
think they would admit that they did not handle the mfg transition well and
were blindsided themselves. This is the mgmt that took the stock from a buck to
$50 and "could do no wrong". The bloom came off the rose last year.

Aside from the temporary problems, there were concerns about other firms
entering their space, concerns about laser surgery's (minimal) impact on the
lens business. Plus it is tough not to get rattled when a stock drops from $52
to 11, even if you sold most of the position.

The business is "very competitive" generally, but COO operates mostly in the
high growth Toric end which is more performance sensitive and less price
sensitive than the standard spherical (no astigmatism)
lens business.

Note they instituted a dividend today. Also note yesterday's news which
includes some comment on much higher peer valuations for WJCO and OCLR. I told
some people this morning that I believe the stock will be back in the $30's in
6-12 months, if not sooner. If you must get out, take a look at writing a

know the feeling having been cut in half on several positions before going on
to doubles. Another is to pull the trigger when something that looks good pulls
away. That was and is my problem with COO. As it pulled away from 13, I was
still doing DD...trying to get wrapped around it. By the time I figured it was
a mighty good deal at 13 or so...the market had run it up to 15. I waited for a
pullback that never came. Kind of the flip side of the problem you faced, but
psychologically less painful, bucause I didn't have money at risk.
The perspective of this was different for having looked strongly at it at the
lows, than my view of USG and ANGLY, both of which had already left the gate
when I found them. I recognized the value and jumped on without hesitation
[Both are up about 25% in 1 - 2 months].

don't feel inclined to chase it.

Paul,re cse as play on successful merger. I took small position today by
selling Oct 55 puts at 8 3/4 in my IRA account. The risk to reward is favorable
but risk is too high for a large position IMHO.
First I think nh is paying too much and secondly I think a failure would be
costly with cse dropping to mid 30s. However by selling puts against a 90% cash
equivalent of a T-note an investor can squeeze out another 100 dollars in
interest, on top of the 875 received for the puts, as compared to a cash
purchase of the stock. At 975/4625 the 21% half year return is equivalent to an
annualized yield of 42% which makes the risk reasonable. The put selling
strategy implies a willingness to hold the position until October.

problem is a nail." Buffett "moved on" from Graham's model, and said "It should
be noted that your Chairman, always a quick study, required only 20 years to
recognize how important it was to buy good businesses. In the interim, I
searched for 'bargains' – and had the misfortune to find some."

3) You don't bother to do the research -- you did not read about company
fundamentals before commenting on the stock.

Finally, all I am saying is that a stock is very cheap at 15 p/e when its
growth rate is at 100% Y/Y.

Michael Burry: Bad news on SVR, your recent pick. Thoughts?
The numbers look wonderful, and so a pullback on bad news seems like a great
time to buy. But will there be more bad news, or worse news? I suppose the idea
of value investing is that the stock has already been discounted for the worst
possible news, therefore one's downside is limited. I'll keep watching your web

Twister, you haven't been elected thread representative, so you might consider
apologizing only on your own behalf, not the thread's.

My past comments about Bob Davis and his picks and his investing style have
probably been most critical.

My opinion is this: Bob has a newsletter, and he performs VERY great detailed
analysis on a very few stocks. Now for a number of possible reasons - bring
attention to his newsletter, bring attention to his positions, bring attention
to undervalued stocks, help people find potential bargains, etc. Bob posts
here. One issue I have is that the stock base is limited. This results in about
every few months a post here about the great undervalued state or the earnings
growth or important news of --- MTY. MTY,MTY again and again. I think that's
touty.

Nevertheless, this leads us all always to the logical question: is MTY
undervalued? My second issue then becomes that the picks are too tough for me
to figure out. But easy enough if one is to believe and trust Bob's work and
contacts. (which may be a profitable thing to do. I don't know.) My
recollection is that Bob gets great comments on the detailed work he does, but
I only recall one other person ever mentioning that he/she bought MTY. Based on
my quick scan and the discussion on the other stock mentioned here now, it's
not likely imo that more then a couple of people on this thread will now buy
that stock either. If the research and effort done by Bob are helping Bob and
his subscribers, that's great. Based on what I actually see people doing-- I
don't think these stocks help anyone on this thread. And given my general
distaste for detailed analysis, I don't think that Bob's methods for his stocks
will work for anybody but Bob. That would be my opinion.

Robert, Re: SVR

I don't see anything really new. To me, analysts and I knew that expenses were
getting high due to some new marketing. Today was just Mr. Market. If anything,
the action tells me there's a definite bottom around 6. The stock has already
discounted this news. I think more than anything the company isn't being
assigned any kind of premium as a takeover candidate because the CEO is also a
54% shareholder not likely to approve that. Takeover talk lifted the rest of
this industry a few months ago. But SVR is on its own. As such, I still like
it. I don't see the earnings revisions as changing the margin of safety at all.

Paul, with all due respect, I am surprised that you seem to think it more
important to "correct" a sincerely made apology to a "wronged" guest of the
thread, than to coax an apology from the one who made the original error in
judgement. Under THOSE ridiculous circumstances, I have no urgent desire
welling inside me to recant my apology and refashion it to suit you.

What I see from your comments, and some other recent ones on this thread, is an
insidious kind of thread censorship operating here. For example, it's seems
perfectly okay for some to have a web page that "touts" stocks, to have started
many a thread on SI, to "plug" your site in your profile, to plug your site on
the various threads, and to publisize the initiation of investment
partnerships, but apparently not so for others. Others who we may not know as
well, like as well, understand as well, or agree with.

Similarly, it was recently said to a new poster that this was a thread only for
net-nets, which of course is absurd.This was simply said to someone who didn't
know any better, and who was seen as a nuisance. The original "flame" certainly
was not welcoming. The shell-shocked poster, in a strange turnabout, ended up
apologizing to the paternalistic instigator. But please notice, that just a day
before, there was a number of posts about "my buffet like" stocks, and a fairly
long exposition about one in particular, Oracle, on the "net-net" thread no
less. But, SHOCKINGLY, that poster was not reprimanded in any way shape or form
for this transgression of thread policy. Last I checked, Oracle, was selling
ABOVE it's net current assets. OR am I miss reading the latest 10k?

From the SVR 10-K. Most of the company's assets are these receivables. Then
they also have a bunch of inventories. I didn't get far enough to understand
how a time share resort can book inventories. Sounds strange to me. I would
think this would be a business with a lot of fixed assets, i.e. real estate.
I'd be real careful doing the straight net-net calculation on this puppy. Just
a suspicion based on very little work, but something doesn't look right here.
I'll wait for Mike to clear this up.

<<As part of the Vacation Interval sales process, the Company offers potential
purchasers financing of up to 90% of the purchase price over a seven to ten
year period. The Company has historically financed its operations by borrowing
from third-party lending institutions at an advance rate of up to 70% of
eligible customer receivables. At December 31, 1998, the Company had a
portfolio of approximately 36,075 customer promissory notes totaling
approximately $196.9 million with an average yield of 14.2% per annum, which
compares favorably to the Company's weighted average cost of borrowings of 9.6%
per annum. At December 31, 1998, approximately $8.8 million in principal, or
4.5% of the Company's loans to Silverleaf Owners, were 61 to 120 days past due,
and approximately $17.8 million in principal, or 9.0% of the Company's loans to
Silverleaf Owners,were more than 120 days past due. The Company provides for
uncollectible notes by reserving an amount which management believes is
sufficient to cover anticipated losses from customer defaults.>>

SVR - this one's fun - (sorry Mike, you started it)
<<(6) Risk on a default is that -- 10% down and a few payments do
not cover the high variable costs of marketing and sales.>>

OK, that's the risk to earnings. What's the risk to the company if we go into a
recession and defaults go up all at once? They say in the 10-K that they have
little recourse to go after the "owner" of the timeshare. So the asset goes
back into inventory to be marketed and sold again. But in a recession nobody's
going to buy it. They also kindly point out that their lenders will only lend
on 85% of performing receivables (85% seems extremely high to me considering
the default rates in a good economy). So what happens when 20% of customers
stop paying in a recession? SVR's banks call in the loans and the company goes
"poof". Am I reading this wrong?

Did anybody else notice the pricing of these timeshare interests? $7-8,000 per
week timeshare? I assume that is for one week per year over the life of the
contract, so maybe that's $1,000 per "vacation" (although the 10-K reads as if
they charge $7,000 per week. That number just seems so absurd that I'll give
them the benefit of the doubt.) Even $1,000 seems pretty steep to me
considering where these places are - we're not talking 5 star resorts here. I
just ask myself "Would I buy this product?" and the answer is NO WAY. Mike,
I'll ask you that as well. Would you buy this product? And if not, might that
explain the high marketing costs and the high default rates? This smells like a
scam to me.

It took about 15 minutes with the 10-K to decide that I would not buy this
stock. The three reasons I am spending a bit more time with it is that 1) I
like to learn strange accounting so I recognize it next time I see it; 2) In a
market like this I am always looking for a possible short; and 3) I want to
challenge the belief on this thread that Jim and Mike agree on everything.

Re: SVR, the net net calc isn't so easy. Very long post here.

Some things to keep in mind - good bad and ugly. SVR is very interesting (as I
say on the site) and has a lot of good characteristics, but DD is always
necessary. I myself have not yet bought. I always wait a few days after a pick
of the month is posted before buying, but I should clarify this time I still
remain unconvinced that I want to buy it. In any case, I don't have the cash,
and I'm not abouto sell anything else in the portfolio to buy it (yet).

The company books as revenue the entire sales price of a VOI (avg $8,146 per)
basically once it gets a 10% down payment. The remainder of the balance then
goes into AR, which consists mainly of notes receivable from each customer with
lengths from 7-10 years. As the company receives installment payments (which
include principal + interest), the company books interest income. The company
is getting just under 12% on its receivables in interest income. The company's
interest expense is about 57% of its interest income, so it makes money on the
spread.

However, the company needs cash to fund development and marketing of VOIs and
hence keep the sales coming. Last year the company borrowed 75 million at 10+%,
the first time it did so. That helped goose sales last year to that 89% rise.
Typically, the company also gets current cash out of its receivables by
borrowing against the receivables at a fairly low rate of LIBOR + a few
percent. Usually it borrows about 70% of receivables, but recently it increased
that to 85%, which coincided with a fall in the interest rate charged. This
also helped goose development, marketing, and sales last year and this past
quarter.

Re: allowances for uncollectable AR, the company has been steadily decreasing
the amount that it is allowing as uncollectable, and is currently at about 10%.
As far as I can tell, the company is decreasing this allowance based on
experience of lower delinquent/default rates.

The company is pushing the limit on how much more it can borrow to fund further
development. As long as it can continue increasing AR then it can borrow more
at 85% of the increase, but obviously this results in a necessary deceleration
in sales growth. 85% is better than 70%, but it's not >100%. The company may
also borrow a bit more senior debt. But that debt is more expensive, and would
squeeze the (interest earned - cost of interest) spread. Currently, the company
earns about $10 million/year run-rate on this spread.

Now there's the inventories. The company's inventories are the VOI's it has
either acquired, reacquired, or built but not yet sold. The inventories are on
the books at the lower of cost or market price. The company did have a large
amount of inventories acquired several years back at a low cost basis. It has
depleted those, and is now selling out of inventory that it built at a higher
cost. This is squeezing margins on VOI sales.

Moreover, the company may have miscalculated a bit and is being forced into
stepping up marketing efforts more than it planned in order to sell interests
in certain slower markets. This further pressures margins on those sales, and
is what spurred the CSFB analyst to downgrade the stock.

So what happens when the company sells through its inventory and has maxed out
its borrowing of 85% of ARs at some reasonable level? The company's sales will
basically crash. You will be left with net interest income which is expiring
over 10 years, and management fees, and a questionable real estate asset base.
With SVR, I must admit I do not know about the quality of its real tangible
assets.

But where will this max out? Would the company pay back its market cap of about
$90 mill before the business runs its course?

Well, that's where one has to keep in mind that there are some significant
liabilities here. That new senior debt facility of $75 million in addition to
capital lease obligations, other notes payable, and a significant deferred tax
liability all come to a grand total of over $180 million.

Ok, that's a lot to think about. But before thinking this is a net net or
applying some simple ratio, this is what has to be thought of.

The chairman owns the majority of the shares. Silverleaf has a good concept
(the drive-to econo class) with some good locations, and it does own portions
of adjacent real estate at many of its locations. The stock is down horribly,
as is the entire industry. This is a contrarian play, and a value play only if
one convinces oneself that despite all the above, the company is worth
significantly more than $90 mill and that the chairman will allow it to be
unlocked if the appropriate better-capitalized suitor comes calling. A bigger
company with better access to more and cheaper capital might find Silverleaf's
franchise very attractive.

So liquidation value, takeover value, going-concern value. This is what
Security Analysis was written for. They all have to be looked at. I see the
cheapest stock in a crushed industry with insider buying and what should be
motivated management. Even if after due diligence once comes out bullish,
probably not something to concentrate all one's assets in, IMO. Some on the
Yahoo thread seem to be doing just that.

I usually try to keep my Picks of the Month rather short and to the point to
perk up interest/stimulate analysis, nothing more. The point has not been for
me to put down my entire analysis and a recommendation. In the future, I will
put down more analysis. And I will update the current Pick to include some of
this post.

Jim: SVR Inventory appears to be variously considered as the resort buildings
and the vacation intervals, which, of course, are the blocks of time SVR sells
to customers. A room or suite might break up to 26 2-week vacation intervals.
If they sell 10, they have 16 left in inventory. The balance sheet line item
for land, buildings, and utilities would probably be the offices they work out
of rather than inventory buildings.
Very good point on the receivables...operating cashflow doesn't look nearly as

Twister,

I'd say the intent of the thread is to propose and analyze stocks in the Graham
tradition. Make it intelligent. The issue of growth at a reasonable price vs
value vs no difference has come up before, and a lot of the contributors here
who also feel that growth can have a reasonable price have found the
Buffettology thread a better place for those kinds of stocks/discussions. This
thread is probably better suited for other kinds of more tangible value
analysis, given the personalities that seem to have assembled here and return
here.

To be fair, I think I brought up CLZR here a couple years ago. Bob had some
good counterpoints and that was that.

I'd also say that Jim, Jeffrey and maybe Paul have probably shown some lenience
to me here vs some newcomers. I've been castigated by each, though. But I post
a lot, and type a lot, and sometimes inappropriate stocks (stocks probably more
appropriate for the Buffettology thread or even a Burry v. Twister thread) get
mentioned.

It's not really worth fighting about.

Re: touting stocks, as you insinuate I do, you're welcome to your opinion. I'd
say there's a tone to touting that I see in some posts that get accused of
touting, and you're about the only one who's accused me. I don't see such a

My personal preference would be to allow latitude for discussion on a broad
range of value related issues. Growth at bargain price, Net-net similars,
Buffet-like, Graham-like, even the occasional overvalued short based on
value-oriented ideas. Excluded would be nifty 50's, high PE, PS, PB unless
considered as valuation short. In addition, discussion of factors related to
valuation like EVA, competitive strategy, evaluating management, accounting
issues, investment books, net sources and so forth would fit. I appreciate
contrary opinions expressed with civility, courtesy and mutual respect. Flames,
rudeness, touty or inappropriate posts are rare and broadly unappreciated by
most posters on the thread. IMO, this thread has fit the above description with
minor exceptions.

Totally agree, and that's the drum I've been marching to while reading &
posting on this thread for many moons. Growth at bargain price, capitalizing on
market inefficiency is and will be a viable topic on this thread. "Net-nets"
are only one piece of the puzzle.

Shorting absurdly valued stocks have been & will be discussed too...Michael

However, that is not what Mike Burry asked for when he set up this thread.

I am concerned that if virtually anything goes, the value stocks of the
character he described will be lost in a maze of many others. I particularly
think stocks selling at P/E's of 25 and growing at 40%,
with high price/sales and high price/book are NOT what he had in mind, but are
characteristic of what many of the future stocks posted here would be if we
endorse a change.

I suggest we should listen to Mike and if we are going to accept all kinds of
"bargains" he should change his cover page.

SVR - beating a horse to death perhaps.

I appreciate the posts which are dampening my enthusiasm a bit. A few more
points from me.

I think that the liquidation scenarios are interesting and if liquidation value
was higher than mkt cap there would be reassurance. So the focus is on going
concern value -- since liquidation value is doubtful.

I do not understand this, please explain if you will.
As long as it can continue increasing AR then it can borrow more at 85% of the
increase, but obviously this results in a necessary deceleration in sales
growth. 85% is better than 70%, but it's not 100%.

I see the risk to profitability margins as the kicker. Maybe this comes from
the cost side with development or acquisition costs increasing. But I have
recently read analysts supposing that ASPs might degrade due to internet
effects. They suppose that the resale mkt for timeshares might develop on the
net which would compete with the marketing of new units. I think this is a
valid concern. On the other side, internet marketing might lower the marketing
costs of the new units.

I think the overall economics on a simplified level are that you get a ton more
revenue by selling the resort a week at a time than you do by selling the condo
whole. As long as the extra marketing costs and higher commissions are covered
by the pricing, condos will continue to be converted/developed to timeshares.

The other industry concern is that you always need to find new customers. No
repeat business -- or very little. I am trying to think of what other
sectors/industries have that problem. Capital Equip of some sort of course, on
the industrial/commercial side. On the 'retail' side -- What do you only buy
one of -- but many people buy none of - in your lifetime? Hot tubs? Housing?
Life Insurance? Wedding dress? :o) Who else always need new customers? Consider
this a trivia question for fun. And are those sectors' valuations affected by
the continuous hunt for customers who may decide never to appear?

You can tear yourself to pieces trying to micro analyze this. And there is
value to it, of course. I am not knocking your analysis. But flavor it with the
overall picture. They say that demographics is favoring the industry's
continued growth and the Marriots, Hyatts, Hiltons and Ramada Vacation Suites
are validating the sector -- they are validating the micro economics that you
are tearing you hair out for perhaps?

thanks,
grommit

I'm curious, would you ordinarily characterize your philosophy as

stock investors would rarely wake up one day and sell everything, precisely
because their investment premise is to pay more attention to out of favor

Grommitt, re: SVR, no doubt, there are some favorable goings on. I'd say my
Pick of the Month article was too bullish, and my post here was purposely more
bearish to kind of counteract that. The demographics are favorable, no doubt.

Remember that the bulk of their revenues are sales. If this is going to
continue growing, they need capital. They get it by borrowing against the
unpaid principal (AR) at a fraction of that unpaid principal. This inhibits
growth in the growth rate, and basically guarantees slowing growth. Last year
they threw in a lot of addiitonal debt to give sales a kick, but at a higher
interest rate. They cover their interest expense with interest earned, but
obviously that won't continue if they pile on debt like that every year. This
is NOT really a growth story, no matter the demographics, because the model
can't support it as is.. But it is nevertheless a wonderful valuation puzzle,
and possibly a value stock.

Re: liquidation, evidently at least one analyst thinks that that value is over
13/share. But will it be liquidated? Depends entirely on Mr. Mead, no? If not,
then liquidation should be ignored and it has to be valued as an ongoing
concern. Interesting case. Further discussion could be on your Timeshare
thread.

Dan,

I don't know of any. My thinking is it would be hard to put together a really
thoughtful GARP thread since the analysis is by definition so superficial.
Superficial analysis, superficial posts. Buffett is now a GARP investor, but
with a very thorough and reliable approach. If a stock really is a bargain at
30 times earnings, it would have to fit Buffett criteria. That it grew 50% the
last two years and trades at 40 times earnings means nothing to me. That Oracle
has earned 32% on equity over 10 years, with steady upticks in earnings and
stock price, and has a business that I understand, makes it "buffett-like" for
me. So if the story is growth at a value price, then Buffettology's the best
bet for decent analysis IMO. If there is no predictable growth, or it is
debatable, you'll hear about it.

Maxwell Shoe (MAXS) is selling for just below book value and 1/2 sales. P/E
about 6. Profit margin 8%. ROE over 18%. No L-T debt.
The company has been selling shoes for 50 years. The founding family got bought
out a year or so ago (at a high premium), and now is run by a crew of shoe
marketing professionals. No factories -- manufacturing is contracted out to the
lowest bidder that can meet spec. No long-term contracts with the
manufacturers.

Their premium line, Jones of New York, is a question mark, because of Jones'
merger with Nine West, which has its own line of premium shoes. Whether the
licensing arrangement with Jones will be renewed, or whether Jones will buy it
back, and if so, at what price, is weighing heavily on the stock.

Earnings due out in the first week of June.

Paul I posted on National Auto Credit( NAKD) last year and would like to bring
up the idea to you and the thread once again. This is a situation where an
investor has to evaluate a possible reasonable reward with a definable risk.
The company is a former NYSE listed stock that has been under an audit review
for almost a year. After de-listing and going to the BB the company was able to
generate sufficient cash to pacify its lenders. Then out of the blue came a IRS
tax refund that was sufficient to essentially pay off its creditors. The audit
is still ongoing and the issue is what is the level of reserves required to set
aside for claims against the company
from a discontinued car rental operation. The company was self insured and sold
the business to AVIS about 4 years ago. Apparently the nitty gritty of sorting
out a myriad of claims in many states is a difficult and time consuming task
for the auditors. Two days ago the company announced the appointment of an
excellent choice for CEO(former GE Finance Exec) and the stock has risen from
below 1 to 1.19. I dont believe a person of his caliber would take a job with a
seriously flawed business prospect, The company continues to originate loans
and has a work force of 350 or so. There will be an EDGAR filing on the new ceo
next week and I will anxious to review that document. My opinion only,but I
think the reward could be a 3 dollar stock this year and the risk could be a 50
cent stock(no less than zero). I have a medium size position but may add more
if the EDGAR filing indicates a reasonable stock option incentive for the new
CEO.

Hi Jeffrey,

I've been caught a couple times in one of these occasional market melt downs
and I think we're about due for another one. Anyone sitting on a lot of cash
last October could just about have closed their eyes and picked anything to
triple their money in a few months. While I'm usually mostly stock in my
brokerage accounts, there are times when it's pretty hard to beat cash for a
good "value" play. When the Fed raised rates in March of 97, the bottom fell
out of everything pretty much straight across the board. It looks to me like
the Dow has topped out and is headed South. Sometimes it gives out false
signals so I may be mistaken, but with a tightening bias by the Fed, I think
it's going to trend downwards on profit taking. We'll see.

That was precisely my argument on this thread four months ago - and
unfortunately I acted on it. I sold Boeing at 33 (now 45 and on fire), New
Holland at 11 (now 15, peaked at 18), LaSalle Hotels at 12 (now 14) and Cyprus
Amax at 11 (now 14). It looked like a good idea at the time, though plenty of
people on this thread tried to talk me down. I wish they had tried harder, but
it wasn't their fault - I wasn't listening. Thanks for trying (though to be
fair I got the same treatment last July when I was right). The lesson I learned
was that if you're a deep value investor, you know the stocks you own are worth
less than they trade at - otherwise why would you own them? So unless there is
a problem in the businesses, do your market timing, if any, with S+P puts. If I
had done that I would have a lot more money than I have right now.

I agree with the previous poster completely - the market level looks very very
dangerous with interest rates rising. I am particularly concerned with the
complacency about interest rates - nobody seems to believe they can go above 6%
- that's a very small move from current levels. And interest rates over 6%
would get people thinking 7%, and then we've got a bloodbath in the stock
market. Stop me now before I sell again. No, I learned my lesson. I'll focus on
the stocks I own - if they are overvalued now, then I don't need a market call
to sell them. And if they're not and I have conviction in the value of the
business, I should hope they go down so I can buy more. Lesson learned.

There are some very very interesting net-nets out there now if you're into
$10-30 MM market caps. I took a list of 50 down to about 10 names which look
interesting, with 3 looking like no-brainers. Usually that list of 50 boils
down to 5 that are interesting and 1 no-brainer if I'm lucky. My routine is to
double back now and do full fundamental research on the ones that look like
no-brainers. I'll post a few of them within the next two weeks. I regularly
screen for net-nets, but I have always said I only find the no-brainer once
every six months. And so far on that strategy of sifting the net-nets I am 4
out of 4, never having lost money and never having waited more than six months
for a 30%+ gain. And if you want one now (not one of the three I am looking at
because this one is already 20% of my portfolio) Lazare Kaplan (LKI) below 9.
I've posted this one several times and gotten remarkably little interest
considering the nature of this thread. This would be on my no-brainer list if I
didn't already own it big. If I said my price target is 15 scaling up to 25
with a 6-12 month time horizon would that get anybody's attention?

Hi Jeffrey,

That's been my experience also. The beat up value plays tend to hold up better
in a down market than over priced techs but there is usually some down side
risk involved. At present I plan to play a few small short term trades while
waiting to see what the market does over the next month or so. I picked up some
ABN Friday just for grins. They have announced they expect to restate earnings
for the past couple years and there is an investigation involved, but book
value is $2.26 and they have $5.23 in cash. Quite a bit of debt but at .41 per
share I thought it looked kind of interesting. I don't usually mess around much
with penny stocks but the fundamentals are better than the average internet
stock so I figured I'd try my luck with a little mad money. It gives me
something to do while waiting for the next "crisis".

Where do you see Boeing now?

I bought BA at about 34, so I'm interested in why you thought it was time to

I worked a while at the Douglas Aircraft plant of McDonnell Douglas about 16
years ago. I think there are still huge savings to be made by reducing costs.
The BA CFO impresses me in what she's been able to accomplish so far and how
much room for improvement remains at BA.

Jim, I just took a quick look at LKI and I think it is more risky than most
because the company's net worth is concentrated in its rough and polished
diamond inventories. How conservative is this valuation and how does it compare
with current market prices? Do they mark to market or to cost basis. What has
happened to wholesale diamond prices over the past three years?
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:5/23/1999 12:56:00 PM
From:jeffbas

Jim, there are different issues on interest rates for the stock market:

Is a rise in rates due to tighter money and impending materially higher
inflation, or due to fears of more inflation that largely won't be realized? If
the former, then it could have a lasting impact on both the stock market and
economy. However, I doubt it because of lack of notable strength outside the
US.

If it is merely due to fears of higher inflation, it will likely only have a
temporarily adverse impact on the stock market, with those fears getting all
the blame for a correction that would have happened anyway. At this level,
interest rates are not a material cost of doing business for most companies,
except for financial institutions.

Therefore, I would conclude that because of the complacency the market is quite
exposed to a correction, but not a serious one. For me that means being very
careful about new investments and taking profits on any large advance in a
stock, thereby gradually reducing exposure, but no wholesale liquidation.

Jim, you were willing to by CYM at a cyclical low. Would you be willing to do
same with Homestake Mining (HM). I am considering it.

I thought and think CYM is a cigarbutt. But I also thought they were at a very
low price in both the stock and business cycle - especially the stock cycle. So
I bought- having no positive outlook for the industry and no idea of what or
when the perception of CYM might change to cause the stock price to rise.

Now seems like HM is similar. Mining co. with a discredited metal (England
unloading lots of her hoard). But at some point the gold market will absorb,
and at some point there might be demand increases for gold. The stock of HM is
at at least a 10-year low. Again, I do not understand or like the business, I
don't see when or how HM or its peers will recover, and it certainly looks like
HM stock will not recover (can drop much more)... but.... historically - over
the past 10 years or more... this stock has traded above 10 (up from 8 now). So
I am thinking, again like CYM, they are not going out of business (just a
guess), they have assets, I don't see any insider selling....and sometime in
the next 2 years HM will be 50% higher (at 12) than today.

Raw diamonds are not priced off supply and demand like copper or corn is. The
DeBeers cartel controls the global market, and will hold massive amounts of
inventories if that is what it takes to keep diamond prices stable. There was a
threat that Soviet exports would undermine DeBeers, but that has not happened.
This is a cartel much stronger than OPEC because there are so few players that
there is limited incentive to "cheat". In the case of OPEC, a small producer
has a big incentive to cheat.

This is important because Lazare's net working capital is almost all diamond
inventories.

The risk I see in Lazare is that a lot of the high end U.S. market for luxury
goods has to be linked to stock market wealth. I need some of the catalysts to
fire before the U.S. stock market tanks. In the high-end diamond market,
though, a Japanese recovery might trump weakness in the U.S. market. That
certainly has been the case in reverse - weakness in Japan has just killed
DeBeers and Lazare in recent years despite strength in the U.S.
