Nice thread here Paul. I'm starting to accumulate a few value plays, including
the following:

TRN: Makes rail cars, barges and pylons for windmills. I found out about it
from this week's Forbes. Has P/B of .67, trailing P/E of 4, 2 bucks/share in
cash, pays 2%. Current ratio 1.9. Obviously cyclical businesses but decent back
log to cushion the blow. Trades around 16.

KBR: Oil field engineering so it's been shellacked. Has almost 7 bucks/share in
cash and trades at 15 (with NO debt). Lots of deteriorating energy
infrastructure that's gonna need upgrades no matter who is president.

NGD: A gold miner. Yecch!<G> Has 1.50/share in cash and closed at 1.45 today
(you heard that right). Trades at 1/5th book value. Current ratio 4.9, Debt:
equity is .173. It is a producing miner, estimated production is 250,000 ounces
of gold for 2008. May not make that target (but will be close) and will likely
close a mine in Brazil this quarter or next (that was slated to be closed by
the end of 2009 in any event). My favorite value stock right now.

NSU: Another more speculative gold miner. Has mine construction financed and
has started construction in Eritrea. Interesting because it's an open pit mine
which won't require enormous capital, and the gold is in the upper layers that
would be produced in the 1st 2 years of operation. What's fascinating is that
they have no debt, 0.46/share in cash and closed today at 0.58. There is also
substantial copper resources underneath the gold which should keep income
rolling in provided the price of copper doesn't continue tanking. A nice
non-expiring call on gold and copper, in a nutshell.

Comment on Mr. Whitman who espouses "safe and cheap"

Like it was discussed already, this year was a steamroll on the kneecaps for
everyone in value investing. There was almost nothing that was "safe and cheap"
if you bought it before September-October: big caps, small caps, international,
commodities, bonds, etc, everything was just killed. The best people could do
was short or buy WMT.

It's easy to blame Marty that his buys were not "safe and cheap", but show me
someone who's buys were. ;)

"It's easy to blame Marty that his buys were not "safe and cheap", but show me
someone who's buys were."

I'll guess most market participants would understand that there are cheap
stocks and that these cheapies can or might get even cheaper. Very cheap if we
go into a recession. It's just that to have something touted as both "safe and
cheap" and have it drop from $40-$50 level to under $10, that imo really does
not easily or comfortably cover the word for "safe". It could, but you have got
to be a real believer. And who knows about something complex like a real estate
developer. Mr. Whitman/others might say I'm confusing volatility with risk and
therefore with "safety". Possibly, but I'll not easily shake my opinion that
"safe and cheap" advertised at $40-50 is safe and cheap and just hang in there
at $10.

I guess I'm noting I should be very careful with the expression "safe and
cheap". As far as I recall, I'm the only person here who has ever tagged any of
his purchases with that Marty Whitman expression. (Everyone else here being too
smart to do so with their picks -g-.) There are objective measures for "cheap".
Not so sure now for stocks offered up as "safe".

Nothing makes it worth 7$. A business like this is not worth 10.5x EBITDA any

nothing (IMO) and in case of forced liquidation, even the senior debt holders
would loose.MIC could go to zero in a heartbeat.

Speaking of zeros, i tried a long/short with BGM/GM last week. BGM is GM senior
debt trading at about 5$ yielding 30%. With GM stock still going for 5$ that is

Not a good day for us who are holding stocks in business development companies.

after each quarterly result."

Bdc stocks may come back if or as the economy improves and the bdc's prospects
improve or dividends resume. For now, the dividend cuts seem more significant
to me than the value that might be in the companies (based on the companies
sharply reduced market caps). So many people are looking to those stocks for
income that the reduction of it or the threat of such will tarnish the

Hi Paul - Any observations for value plays with today's announcement of China's
$586 Billion stimulus plan? Maybe the shipping stocks will come back as China
will need to continue their import of raw materials. If China plans to build
their infrastructure, perhaps CAT and GE may be good candidates.

NOVEMBER 11, 2008
China's Stimulus Plan Cheers Markets, But Doubts Remain
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122634126983014381.html?mod=googlenews_wsj

REITs got hit today too along with your business development companies. The
most recent earnings were not that bad and many of the companies continue to
make their dividends (except FR which was lowered). I guess the market is
figuring that many of these REIT's will be impacted by a long protracted slow
down in the US economy. The market expects commercial real estate values and
gross rents to fall further as the recession gains steam.

The key to buying value is finding cheap assets that over the long term
generate consistent and growing revenue streams. Many of the shipping companies
have accomplished this with long term contracts. My favorite is SFL (SHIP FINC
INTL)
(NYSE: SFL) http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=SFL

They have a diversified portfolio of ships and drill rigs with an average
contract lease period of 15 years. The stock is yielding an incredible 17%. The
stock carries a lot of debt but it is secured by their capital assets with
their underlying long term contracts. I bought some more shares recently at
this level. I guess the surprise would be if any of their long term contract
deals fall through. Most of their agreements are with very large and profitable
organizations.

The other assets class that generates steady revenue streams (over the long
term) is commercial real estate. I like many of the REITs but think the market
will still sell them down. I will be adding to my recent small buys over the
next six months in hopes I can accumulate the bulk of my shares near the lows.

It just appears that things are going to get much worse (domestically) before
they will get better. My approach is to work money into this market over time
with set investment amounts. I am like a kid in a candy store but each time I
come back to the counter, the price has been lowered.

I continue to sell many of my higher priced shares into rallies and try to
position the money into many of these lower priced assets. Cash is yielding a
negative return but if the market continues to fall lower the new investor
theme is: Why buy today if you can buy cheaper tomorrow . . .

All of these picks are selling at less than 10PE and seem to be in the "value"

from the recent JLG merger). This is going to the point where I'd start to look
at buying the debt rather than the equity or in other words close to being a

Then on the other side there is quite some potential if they survive. The
specialty vehicles get sold to military, muni and public organizations where
public infrastructure spending could indeed make a difference. The last 8K has
some nasty language about violating loan covenants. I don't think i would buy

S&P evidently made a negative comment about HRP's leverage. Surprisingly, there

The first post:
I worked several years for a company named Dun & Bradstreet as an analyst,
subsequently a commercial credit an analyst at a bank, hold an MBA in
accounting.

The comment by S & P that HRP is highly leveraged is wrong. A 50/50 approx debt
to book value capital is considered solid by anyone who knows anything about
financial statement analysis. S&P should issue a retraction, apologize and are
subjecting themselves to lawsuits for such poor work.

Hi Spekulatius - The problem I am seeing with quite a few companies now is that
overall debt loads are quite high especially when you look at current
debt/equity ratios. I have always measured this risk based on the company's
free flow cash and their capability to service their debt. This way of looking
at it does not work too well in a slumping economy. You can not expect the free
cash flow to hold, so in some cases several of these companies will not be able
to service their debt as cash flows fall.

I guess you need to look at the companies core assets (real producing assets vs
fake: like goodwill) and evaluate their future revenue production capability.
You do raise a good point about hedging the play by buying up some type of debt
position. I suppose you mean corporate bonds or preferred shares.

Have you evaluated any investment options for OSK (bonds or preferred shares?).

Another deep discounted value play mentioned here is HRP the REIT. This is a
similar case. Huge amount of debt($13/share debt) but current cash flows seem
sufficient to carry it. BV is $11 but stock is now $3.15. They own some very
good core assets in Hawaii (one of the largest land owners) but the company may
be levered with too much debit which will not be easy to reduce in the current
environment. Perhaps this is a situation where you look at buying the debt or
one of the preferred shares.

The only safety valve these companies have to save cash flow shortfalls is to
reduce their dividend payouts. It appears that Mr. Market is expecting this
across the board based on the current high dividend yields we now see given the
current market prices.

Value is good but safety is better. I guess the prudent investor in this
environment would buy value as long as the company's total debt is low (30% or
less of market cap), the core assets are "real, tangible & undervalued" and the
potential revenue stream(s) provide enough upside to buy now and hold. The
unknown is just how far and deep this recession will last in the US and around
the world.

I just look at the size of there debt. They may be at 50/50 now, but commercial
asset values are going to decline (imo) (I fully expect commercial real estate
to get a residential real estate mark to market which would cut the value by
about 20%-30%) The only REITS I would consider are either debt free (or nearly
so) or possibly apartment REITS.

You may find this list useful. There are a surprisingly high number of
companies that could go private via LBO, and fund the interest payments from
cash flow.

Interestingly, the list is not as commodity-heavy as I anticipated.

Started a small position in OSK and added a few shares to HRP. At current
prices, I expect dividends to be cut to service debt. Both companies have
significantly underperformed the S&P 500. If they can be survivors the
risk/reward at current prices seems attractive. Paul describes these
opportunities as "lottery ticket" investments.

I am watching CAT as this company will be a survivor. This is one you want to
own prior to any Global recovery. Stock yields 5% at $33.5 which is 7% from its
current price. The stock has traded below $20 six times since 1996 and the most
resent visit was in 2002. My one big concern is that CAT's total debt is much
higher than it has ever been in the past and the relative debt/equity,
debt/outstanding shares and other liquidity ratios are higher than I would like
to see.

CAT becomes a buy somewhere in the $20's and if that occurs the whole market
will be quite sour. I will hold my nose and and nibble at a few shares if that
happens.

U.S. Slump May Be Longest in Decades as Growth Fell Off `Cliff'

By Bob Willis and Kristy Scheuble

Nov. 12 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. downturn will be the longest in three decades,
and the drought in consumer spending may be the worst ever, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.

The implosion of credit markets last month will cause the economy to shrink at
a 3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter and decline at a 1.5 percent pace
in the first three months of 2009, according to the median estimate of 59
economists surveyed Nov. 3 to Nov. 11. Following last quarter's 0.3 percent
drop, the slump would be the longest since 1974-75.

``The economy fell off a cliff in October,'' said Richard Berner, co-head of
global economics at Morgan Stanley in New York. ``We had a huge financial shock
that intensified the credit crunch and triggered a sharp downturn.''

Declines in household spending will extend into next year as the worst
financial crisis in seven decades forces employers to keep cutting payrolls on
top of the 1.2 million jobs already lost this year. President-elect Barack
Obama has said the U.S. needs a second economic stimulus package ``sooner
rather than later.''

The pace of contraction this quarter would be the worst since 1990. Berner is
among economists projecting the current slump will also be the most serious in
a quarter century as the lack of credit causes a reinforcing, vicious circle of
declines in confidence, spending and hiring.

``All of these adverse feedback loops are working to reinforce the downturn,''
he said. ``At the moment, it looks like the deepest U.S. recession since '81.''

Some members of the group that officially determines when U.S. contractions
begin and end are even more pessimistic.

`Serious Recession'

``We're in for a pretty serious recession,'' Jeffrey Frankel, a member of the
business-cycle dating committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research,
said in a Nov. 10 interview with Bloomberg Television. ``There's a chance it'll
be the worst postwar recession.''

In addition to gross domestic product, the group tracks changes in payrolls,
production, income and sales to make their call. The NBER usually declares a
recession 12 to 18 months after it starts. The odds of an official contraction
occurring within the next 12 months rose to 100 percent, according to this
month's survey, up from 90 percent in October.

After dropping at a 3.1 percent pace in the third quarter, consumer spending
will fall 2.9 percent this quarter and 1.3 percent in the first three months of
2009, according to the survey median. Spending, which accounts for more than
two-thirds of the economy, has never fallen for three consecutive quarters in
the postwar era.

Rising Unemployment

Falling demand will cause an even bigger increase in unemployment than
projected last month. Economists surveyed forecast the jobless rate will rise
to 7 percent in the first quarter of 2009, up from last month's forecast of 6.6
percent. The rate will climb to 7.7 percent by the end of 2009, the highest
level since 1992, the survey showed.

The jobless rate rose to 6.5 percent in October, the highest since 1994, the
government said last week. Employers cut 240,000 jobs last month and the total
number of unemployed Americans jumped to 10.1 million, the highest level in a
quarter century.

``The combination of the credit crunch and the rapid decline in consumer
spending were the two drivers'' behind the weakening employment outlook, said
John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The economic slump is contributing to a plunge in commodity prices that spells
good news for inflation. Consumer prices will rise 1.8 percent next year, the
smallest gain since the last official recession in 2001, after increasing 3
percent this year, the survey showed.

Less Inflation

The diminishing threat of inflation will give the Federal Reserve leeway to
lower interest rates again, the survey showed. The benchmark rate, now at 1
percent, is likely to fall to 0.5 percent by March, its lowest level ever.

Obama, in his first post-election press conference, last week said he would
follow up on any fiscal stimulus passed by Congress in the last weeks of the
Bush administration with further measures after his Jan. 20 inauguration.
Already, the government has approved a $700 billion financial rescue package,
on top of wide-ranging measures from the Fed to boost liquidity.

``We have taken some major action to date, and we will need further action
during this transition and subsequent months,'' Obama said.

U.S. automakers have been among the hardest hit by the slump in spending.
Vehicle sales plunged in October for a 12th straight month, the longest streak
in 17 years, overwhelming efforts by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler LLC to cut costs by trimming payrolls and shutting factories.

Never thought I could buy GE below $15 but picked up a few shares today at
$14.75. Stock goes xdividend December 18 so I will probably unload some of my
more expensive shares at that time.

Lots of good buys this AM but I was a little timid with the president speaking.
I still expect lower lows but it is nice to see these huge rallies so I can
reshuffle the portfolio and sell many of my higher priced (loser) shares before
year end.

Part of good value investing is portfolio management. It takes time and
discipline to work out the higher price losers and replace them with
undervalued next cycle winners. I try to always stay invested but recently my
percentage cash was getting a bit too high. It takes discipline (and some
courage) to deploy new funds back into a never ending falling market. It's a
must if you want to lock in some of these great value plays.

EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD) is one of my favorites and was available at
1994 prices today (traded in the $26 area).

Ditto for me.

Kind of scary when I see that guys like Grommit are moving to cash or
equivalent. He might be very right. The people who run our country (USA) may
really have screwed it up so badly with the permitted financial shenanigans
that this time it really is different - and we may not recover for years, if
ever (in my lifetime).

Whether there's a year-end rally or not, I do not know. I suspect not. As for
people selling for tax-losses, I'm of the opinion that's already occurred.
People have taken enough losses that they don't have to sell more for taxes,
and they won't want or need to play the game of selling year-end to buy back 31
days later into new year.

Would you want to elaborate on DD? I held it but decided to sell it. It has
some OK businesses and some really crappy businesses. The problem is that
crappy businesses will drag the results of good businesses down in every kind
of market.

Net margin is about ~10% which is OK for this kind of company, but overall not
very impressive. Morningstar claims that it has zero moat - probably true for
its lousy businesses. Someone (Morningstar again?) claims that "DuPont has
failed to earn its cost of capital in each of the last five years".

ROE is 27%, but ROIC is only 17%. Even with current low price, the company does
not offer exciting return looking forward. E.g. you could expect better return
from PEP, MSFT, NKE, CSCO, WYE, which are all companies with huge moats. (PEP
is overall probably one of the biggest moat companies in existence). So why
would you buy DD instead of any of the above? ;) And I am not even comparing DD
with really cheap, but perhaps more problematic companies.

The market scares the hell out of me. I can understand that Grommit went
defensive. I share his concern about and economic meltdown, where the economies
just spiral downward. I think it is a real possibility - this innuendo of bad
news seems too much to take.

I do not blame government too much at this point. I think most of the people
are just plain scared. I sure am. And psychology can shut down the economy,
especially since this is now a world wide confidence crisis. While I do not
blame government I think Paulson could do better. He does not inspire
confidence, which at this point is more important than financial engineering.
We need a different kind of person in this position that can inspire confidence
in people.

I am going so sell slowly into this rally and look for bombed out plays with
balance sheet that ensure survival or defensive plays. I do not think it's the
time to do lottery tickets yet since I believe too many of those tickets won't
make it. Besides, in a way most stocks have become lottery tickets - large caps
moving around more than 10% a day certainly feel that way.

HI Jurgis - My interest in DD is their investment in emerging solar technology.
Here is a previous post with some links.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=24792715&srchtxt=DD

I assume their other businesses will perform as in the past and that their
solar division will eventually contribute significantly to the company's ROI.
Who knows, maybe they will spin off this division to shareholders and
vertically grow their solar business services to include home & business
installations.

When I researched many of the other pure solar plays it was just too risky as
there were not really any "value" buys. I then looked out to more established
companies that were investing in Solar development. Cypress semiconductor was
the fist company to have quite a bit of success and did spin off their solar
business. AMAT was another but when I stumbled upon DD and their huge solar
investment in China, it seemed like a very conservative way to invest into this
emerging business.

Although DD it is not a pure play for Solar it is one of the best conservative
investments I can find at the current moment. They also pay a pretty good
dividend (>5%).

Solar product revenues for DD may exceed $400 million next year and I suspect
worldwide this could be well over $1 billion especially if these new solar
arrays are deployed throughout China and the BRICK countries.

Next to oil, natural resources and shipping companies, DD and their solar
division will be a member in my top 10 holdings.

GE is another one I like (excluding their finance arm). They have interest in
many energy related areas; Wind, turbines, power plant management etc (even in
oil Limited Partnerships recently). I continue to build my position up on this
one too.

400M$ is just a tiny drop in the bucket relative to 34B$ in revenue. if I want
to invest in a chemical business I would go with BASFY which is way cheaper,
better managed and has growth prospects as good or better than DD. Or
alternatively buy a GLW a company that has good research productivity (albeit
in cyclical business) and has a better product pipeline.

GE: Finance arm was 50% of their profits and is weighing on the company. I
think the business model based on availability of cheap money for the finance
unit is dead or at least severally challenged. Why not go with a pure play
industrial play (or a couple of them for diversification) and get the deal

In summary, this quarter produced results we expected in light of a difficult
market environment. We also think that an improved payout ratio is an important
step for our company. We continue to believe HRP's strong tenant base, limited
near-term lease expirations, strong balance sheet, current high annual dividend
yield make HRP a logical choice for long-term, income-oriented investors.

I think we're pretty stable in our markets, in those free markets in terms of

Hi Paul - It's a bit frustrating with HRP as I am already down 12% from my last
buy 48 hours ago. First Industrial Realty Trust Inc. (FR) management had some
good comments about how they plan to work down and re-capitalize their debt.
Stock was up big yesterday but today it appears that they are giving much of it
back.

It's not clear how long this recession might last. Some say we are more than
1/2 way through it but I suspect it will last a lot longer than anyone expects.

I am a bit worried about Paulson as he does not sound too convincing about his
economic recovery programs. I am anxious to see who the Obama administration
selects for treasury secretary. This pick will go along way in providing
confidence to the markets.

Here are the REITs I presently own

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BDN,FR,HRP&d=s

I have averaged down in all three and established a pretty low cost basis. As
long as none of them go bankrupt, these companies have excellent core real
estate assets. FR already announced a dividend cut and I expect the same for
the others.

I may explore new buys in either preferred shares or senior debt as the common
shares are trading like lottery tickets rather than undervalued equity
positions.

LXP itself decided to buy several million shares, also at $5.60/sh.

When the news came out 10/28 the stock ceased its downfall and popped above
$5.60/sh. As of today, the stock has now fallen back below $5.60.

At current stock price I have to bet that there are some people somewhere

real estate values when they see them. For whatever reason, these fellows
believe the best use of their companies' money now (as of 10/28, anyway --

But the grinding halt of the credit markets has walloped many real estate

Buffett's 13F just came out today. Here are my notes:

Sold 50% of small BAC position. Heh, I told you guys that BAC was not really
endorsed by Buffett. :)

Sold about 10% of Carmax position. Heh, another blah company that was purchased
for reasons unknown.

Bought about 25% more COP and this is on top of more than 100% increase that
was secret and not revealed in last quarter's (6/30) fillings. This is huge.
Heh, I think maybe Buffett is secret Peak Oiler like I am. :)

New tiny position in Eaton Corp. I will take look at it.

Sold about 10% of HD. Hmm, wth is this? Not typical for Buffett to sell 10% of
positions.

Sold about 10% Lowes. See above.

Bought about 40% of NRG Energy. As I told last time, I have no clue what he
likes in NRG. :)

Bought about 10% USB.

He claimed to have bought WFC in one of his interviews. I do not see any
purchases of it in the filling. Maybe he was misquoted and he meant that he
bought WFC for his personal account, but I am somewhat miffed about this gaffe.
Not that I hold WFC or anything. ;)

So to summarize: COP move is the only one that is interesting to me. His sale
of BAC is definitely not a vote of confidence, but he did not buy much of
USB/WFC for me to claim that these are very attractive.

Edit note: it is possible that the small purchases and sales are not Buffett
himself. I doubt BAC, Carmax, Eaton, HD, Lowes, NRG is Buffett, but I may be
wrong.

HI Jurgis-

In March 2008 Buffet reported 17.5 million shares of COP in his SEC filing.
Today's report shows he now holds 84 million shares for a net increase of 66.5
million shares. He is probably in at an average cost of between $55/share -
$60/share which is equivalent to about $3.7 Billion new money invested.

He invested $5 Billion each in GS and GE so his COP position appears to be
about the same dollar exposure.

It's interesting that he has not added any new money to his drug stocks. I
wonder with an Obama administration (and Buffet as one of the many economic
advisors) if we will see some new buys by Buffet that reflect the new
administration policy in action.

Eaton Corp may be a small play on infrastructure development but I suspect
other new Buffet buys will piggyback on new proposed Obama legislation.

The one takeaway from the COP buys is Buffet does not seem to be too concerned
about any future windfall profit tax on domestic US oil companies.

EKS,

Buffett's cost of COP cannot be $55-60 unless he bought under the table from
someone. ;) March - June low is $74, June - September low is $69 and I am sure
that Buffett could not buy all his shares exactly at the low. ;)

I'm looking at some of my oil positions to see which are correlated with COP
price moves. APC stock price, for example, seems to move similarly enough to
COP that I believe I'd now rather just ride with more COP and less APC, so I'll
likely sell some/all APC shares, maybe buy more COP.

COP is already a top position for me, so if I added, I would be taking on more
of COP's business risk (geography, geopolitical/management/etc.) vs. different
risks with APC. Offsetting APC positives are COP's better div. yield (3.8%),
larger size, and now stronger Buffett imprimatur.

Of course, this could be the same false logic that got the hedge funds/quants

ETN -

I took a look at it and there's not much to like.
ROE has gone up in recent years, but ROIC is still below 15%. Net margins below
10%. Debt/equity about 50%. Net tangible assets - negative. Although this is
not perhaps a big issue normally, but it may lead to problems in current
economic crunch if/when ETN needs to refinance their debt and/or get more
financing.

I did not dig very deeply into ETN's numbers, so I may be missing something.
But so far, I am not attracted to buy.

Hi Jurgis - Cramer provided an overview on ETN Friday and he liked the stock
for their steady dividend (w/ potential for future increases), moderate debt
and completed new secondary offering (completed a secondary stock offering
4/2008 17.5 million at $84/share) and thought many of their business segments
would weather an economic downturn.

The company makes power generation more efficient and would benefit from an
infrastructure build out. Insiders still seem to be selling stock, so I am not
convinced that the lows are in place.

Overall, I like their different business operations, the fact that they were
able to complete a secondary offering at more than double the current price and
at a 4% yield, the dividend is historically at the high end.

I may look to start a small position if the dividend yield goes above 5%. The
company would complement my other infrastructure holdings that include HON and
GE. My portfolio does need more exposure to some of the business operations ETN
provides.

UTX, GE and ETN are somewhat similar companies.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ETN,UTX,GE&d=s

GE is the most oversold due to their financial unit problems, ETN hs tracked
the S&P 500 sell off and UTX is still about 20% above the equivalent S&P 500
sell off.

I started buying ETN in July as mentioned here:

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=24829438&srchtxt=etn

Whether it's a buy now (or then) depends on how one looks at things.

I say it's a decent reversion-to-mean play. One could assume though that
nothing - or this one specifically -won't ever revert - depression time is
nigh.

Looking at the past ten years, company has been profitable each year. The low
annual p/e over the past ten years was 7 in 1999. It's about 6 now.

About this comment:

"I took a look at it and there's not much to like.ROE has gone up in recent
years, but ROIC is still below 15%. Net margins below 10%. Debt/equity about
50%."

In past my intent has been to use a variety of analytical methods to try to
find candidates to include in my portfolios. Which is a different mindset
perhaps from others who keep concentrated portfolios and so for safety and
position size would emphasize reasons for excluding stocks.
Since the market has now changed and there are so many, many stocks selling at
value prices or at prices not seen in a decade, there's no reason for anyone
who spots something negative they don't like about a company to not just
move-on. There are so many other possible candidates. So if someone doesn't
like 15% ROIC or wants better margins than 10%, it makes sense to move on to
where the better numbers could be found - in this market such candidates very
possibly will exist.

For about every stock I describe I am buying on this thread, I have put each
through one or more analytical tools that I use. These tools are all contextual
in nature. So I am interested in seeing how roe now compares to roe in past
years and at past stock prices and book value. (I use roe rather than roic).
This method goes further than the Greenblatt methodology. His idea of course is
to buy a package of stocks at the upper right quadrant where high roic meets
high earnings yield (i.e. low p/e). My idea is based on the presumption that at
some stock price, all companies will be a value buy if they are making profits,
regardless of how low their roe (roic) might be. An example might be net-nets
of profitable companies. Or something like ULTR with not-so-great roe, but very
low p/e. Anyway, ETN fits my roe model. I'll keep adding if stock will drop to
new lows on no adverse news (and if I haven't run out of money or confidence
-g-)

Paul,

It is tough to discuss methodology with you, since your answer to any
disagreements is always that you buy everything and look to include companies
rather than exclude them. :)

On the other hand, if company cannot earn at least 12% on their capital, its
capital allocation is not producing more than average cost of capital. And IMHO
such a company is better off being sold/closed and the capital reallocated to
places where it can earn at least 15%.

Of course, the world mostly runs on such "ineffective" companies and you can
call me vulture capitalist for even suggesting above. :)

Discussion is about ETN, a Buffett buy. I give reasons why I have bought and
why I am holding.

Okay to look at my record - what there is of it - and not put much faith in my
choice, given that I choose so many and that I'm wrong a lot. My preference
though is that ETN be looked at on ITS merits, and if somebody doesn't like the
positive points I bring up about ETN, they should just move on to the next
stock.

such a company is better off being sold/closed and the capital reallocated to
places where it can earn at least 15%.

While this statement might speak to optimum capital allocation, it is
irrelevant to me as a value investor. I need to know the market cap of the
company and the history of its roe performance. If I had some sense of future
roe performance, that'd be helpful too. Try it this way:

If a company earned a consistent 12% on its capital, what would I be willing to
pay, as a value investor, for such a company? Not yet enough info. to tempt me
to spring. (Although I like the consistency of roe, which doesn't exist in the
real world.) How about if I saw that the market cap was equal to its capital?
Uhh - maybe still not enough to interest me. How about if the market cap were
low enough that the company was selling for 1/2 of its capital? Suddenly, I am
interested. Why? Because if I buy at current stock price (market cap) I am
getting a company that earns 12% on its capital but 24% on my money. I could
take that return all day.

I'll buy this argument. Let's look at ETN from this point of view then. You buy
it at 6.7B market cap today + you would need to assume its 4.5B debt. By
coincidence ETNs equity is almost the same as market cap. Since ETN earns about
12% ROIC (Earnings/equity+debt), you would earn exactly the same percentage "on
my money". Nice approach to consider - I like it, but in this case ETN is still
not attractive, unless you assume 12% return to be attractive in current
market. :) (Edit: in fact, ETN recently earned only 8.7% ROIC, so your return
would be similar).

Maybe you could argue that you would not need to assume debt "on your money"
purchases of ETN and then return "on my money" becomes higher than 12% if you
purchase at current price (EDIT: about 15% only based "on your money" purchase
at current price without any debt considered). I am not sure if this is correct
way to look at things though, since obviously someone who would buy the whole
company would have to assume the debt.

ETN - its a good company but i think the earnings estimates are still way too
high. I think so because their product mix /customer base are fairly cyclical:

Revenue breakdown:
13% Automotive
16% Truck
Remainder is electrical and hydraulics - those parts go into machinery as well
- hydraulics mostly into big iron. So i think pretty much all of ETN business
is cyclical. Either they are going to win huge market shares or their are going
to have a -10% YOY down quarter in terms of revenue, maybe more.

So more I think about it - the more I suggest it could be a short around
earnings date for a trade.

FWIW, I like ETN and eventually it's going to do OK. But I think that the next
18 month will be very tough for companies like ETN.

You see it. I use a little more complex formula than what I explained though.

The result is that instead of using just stocks in Greenblatt's upper quadrant,
my way is linear - I'm willing to buy all along the roe continuum, providing
roe and other factors (price, et. al.) line up. I've used this formula for more
than ten years -- Greenblatt's a newcomer. -g-

I will use roe though, not roic, because I find roe more easily screened for,
and roe and roic mostly interchangeable for my purposes. Also, I prefer to use
an average roe.

So this use of "average roe" leads back to the same conclusion expressed in
previous posts using only simple stand alone metrics such as just p/e: The
stock's cheap based on some metrics, and a buy now is a bet on
reversion-to-mean unless someone is really, really familiar with the future
prospects for ETN and expects them to be surprisingly good. (Which I doubt even
Mr. Buffett has knowledge of, if he's only read the 10K)

I am essentially betting the company can at least get back to its 10-year
average historical roe (about 17% from 1999-2007, including worst year '01 of
6.8%), and I'm willing to make a small bet on that. Hence the reversion-to-mean
bet. Positives are the near 5% div. yield while waiting, and for me the profit
margins that might remain intact (I hope). (Aside: and again I have another
formula I use that evaluates profit margins and other metrics to ascertain if a
stock is a buy.)

Ha! Of course all this explaining and formula stuff can't get around the fact
I've very underwater on my buys. And although the price of the stock has fallen
sharply and might be a better buy now, going forward I could be very wrong with
my formulas and/or my buys and positions.

I nibbled at a few of the beaten down companies recently discussed. They
include: OSK, MIC, FR and DD

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=OSK,MIC,FR,DD&d=s

MIC is my lottery ticket. I believe the bad news is in after the company
announced a 70% dividend cut (from $0.69/quarter to $0.20/quarter). Management
stated that this was the prudent thing to do so they could build up their cash
reserves. At June 30, 2008, the Company had $1.5 billion of long-term debt,
$1.3 billion of which was hedged with interest rate swaps, $58.7 million of
which was hedged with interest rate caps, $92.6 million of which was unhedged
and $6.4 million of which incurred interest at fixed rates. Much of this debt
is pegged to LIBOR which has finally stabilized so future debt payments are
pretty much fixed.

I believe the risk now is if their is sufficient cash flow from operations to
cover their future debit obligations IF there is a protracted (several quarter)
down turn in the economy? At $3.60/share, the company is selling at 80% below
BV. The company can eliminate their dividend and/or sell anyone of their
separate business operations to survive (if need be). The remaining business
operations would still produce excellent revenue streams that would result in
lower overall long term debt. At the current price a "worst case" outcome still
makes this an attractive value opportunity IMO.

Oshkosh Corporation (OSK) continues to be attractive at current levels as the
company trades near a 10 year low. Their stated dividend is now almost 7% and
the estimated forward PE is 2.5. An economic down turn may reduce their future
earnings but they should have sufficient cash flow to service their future debt
obligations. The company began construction of a new manufacturing plant today
in Tianjin, China where they will produce aerial work platforms (
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Oshkosh-Corp-expands-in-apf-13610664.html ).

First Industrial Realty Trust Inc. (FR) is selling significantly below their
stated BV. Shidler Jay H a Director bought 1 million shares Nov 8, 2008 valued
at $9.95 million. This purchased ranked as the No. 1 of the top 10 insider
purchases from the recent SEC disclosure. (
http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/newsanalysis/investing/10446314.html?cm_ven=YAH
O&cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA )
Two other insiders also made large purchases at prices around $10/share so at
today's close of $6.45/share it appears like a bargain.

EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD) now yields over 6% so I picked up a few more
shares as I build my position.
===============================================================

Paul has Aqua America Inc. (WTR) reverted back to it's mean or is $22.5 your
target? The stock is closing in on it's 52wk high of $23.10. I might take my
profits and buy some of these other super value propositions. What's your view?

Jurgis, i wonder how you bond purchases are working out for you. I have been
looking through E*Trade and there seem some pretty good bargains out there -
but the bid/ask spreads are a killer 3-5% or more. You really would have to sit
those out until maturity, i guess.

Does the board know any good Closed end bond funds or open end funds for
distressed debt? I know JNK the exchange traded junk bond fund but it's
composition seems scary even for me.

Well, I sold GNW for about a wash after the debt got downgraded but GNW
borrowed from revolver to pay that particular bond issue (2009 May maturity). I
was not comfortable holding it anyway.

I sold MS bond for a small gain.

I still hold AIG debt which right now has traded about $.70-.73 on dollar vs my
purchases at $.60 and $.52. Not easy to sell it at that price though, I think
the bid may be around $.67 or so.

Almost all A rated bonds with 20+% yields have disappeared on Fidelity. GNW
long maturities (2014 or so) are still available, but I don't think I want to
risk them without government guarantees. Some AIG subsidiary debt still shows
up, but I am not sure if it is more attractive than stocks. Considering some
stocks could triple without being overvalued, even 20% "guaranteed but risky"
bond return is becoming not very interesting.

I would not buy a bond fund, since I have no clue what's in it, but that's just
me. :)
