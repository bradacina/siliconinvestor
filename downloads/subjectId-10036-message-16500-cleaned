Larry,

Good find. This fund looks like it is accomplishing the loss in value of the
long bond. The 125% covers some of the interest income losses. The game one
could play is use this instrument to hedge some long bond positions and when
one thinks the long bond has bottomed, swap out both the hedge and long bond
holdings and purchase current long bond to enjoy the larger interest income.

Wallace Rivers. Thanks, I do appreciate your perspective on the merits of the
travel business now.

Stocks could easily drop enormously if just one terrorist speedboat attacks one
of these cruise ships. And I've heard security sometimes can be circumvented
when trying to board some of these ships at port stops.
But so far, those negative possibilities are fears, not actualities.
The cruise lines seem to be coping. (I notice more cruise-line t.v.
advertising.)

Asside: my wife and I talked ourselves out of going to London for a few days a
couple of weeks ago. Looked like we couldn't get the flights we wanted, and
Heathrow seemed a mess. (I heard there were even tanks guarding the airports.)
And the enormous peace rallies. Too much negative for us two tourists.

Well, we will try again. Also the week of March 16. At some point - prices are
right, time is available, flights will work out, logic overrules fears, and
we'd like to get on with our lives, war or not - so we will go.

The Northern Lights: The True Story of the Man Who Unlocked the Secrets of the
Aurora Borealis
by Lucy Jago
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375409807/qid=1046050932/sr=8-1/
ef=sr_8_1/104-4850300-6247946?v=glance&s=books&n=507846

It's about a brilliant but slightly mad Norwegian scientist named Kristian
Birkeland (1873-1917). As a way to finance his aurora research, he invented an
electrical process for extracting nitrogen from the air to make fertilizer. He
partnered with a powerful but greedy businessman named Sam Eyde, and the
company they founded evolved into Norsk Hydro.

Per Yahoo, "Copart, Inc. provides vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance
companies, with services to process and sell salvage vehicles through auctions,
mostly to dismantlers, rebuilders and used vehicle dealers."

The stock's come down recently as the company lowered its guidance. On an
absolute basis, the p/book is now maybe okay, the p/sales high (my opinion).
Marketguide above shows no free cash flow. ROE had been increasing, but it's
been down last couple of years. If I assume ROE going forward will be about at
a lower 11%, the stock @~$7.5 is still just a bit too expensive by the ROE
model I sometimes use.

I'm buying CPRT because of its consistently good profit margins.

Book value is growing steadily, and there's no long-term debt. I see a
profitable niche business selling at an attractive (to me anyway -g-) price.

There is a more serious challenge to MO than the legality of cigarettes. They

at an absurd rate, trying to compensate for falling revenues in other areas.
With a pack of smokes now costing between $5 and $7 in many areas, smokers are
either cutting down, quitting, or, more likely, buying cheaper brands. This
seems to be a irreversible process right now. I've never seen taxes REDUCED.

I think that is a smart view. There are an awful lot of investors in
asbestos-related companies that only got the current dividend income, and
nothing else. If MO is like an oil well where the income will cease after some
unknown period of time and there be nothing left, the current dividend yield is
WAY too low.

In my opinion, there is perhaps a 50% risk of this happening some day.
Therefore, that suggests that the current yield on MO should be an equal
composite of a more modest dividend yield on such a stock without that risk and
an "oil well" approach return. The result would be a higher yield than now,
with the market's actual pricing assuming perhaps a 25% risk of a disaster.

MO

The lawsuit issue has been around for at least a decade. MO has a mixed track
record on the lawsuits. The Engle case in Florida will probably be overturned
on appeals.

The states have to be careful about raising cigarette taxes.
Eventually, they will create a huge black market, so people will smuggle in
Marlboro's from lower taxed states to higher taxed ones.

I could see MO shipping cigarettes to Canada or Mexico, and have the natives
smuggle it back across the Canadian border, or Mexicans smuggle it back through
Texas or California.

The settlement with the states in 1997, provides the states with cash payments
from the tobacco companies partially based on cigarette consumption.If tobacco
use declines,MO's payments to the states drops.

Also, some cities and states have sold tobacco bonds to raise cash. The bonds
are secured by tobacco payments. It is impossible to sell the bonds, if tobacco
use continues to decline.

MO had pricing power issues in 1993, and decided to slash prices on the
Marlboro. Eventually, they regained market share, and the stock appreciated.

Most of MO's value is in KFT and SAB. I love the dividend.

The lawsuit issue has been around for longer than a decade. :)

The dividend is good and MO has a dominant market position. Any negative
verdict will be fought in the courts for years.

One either accepts the litigation risk and buys the common or chooses to a) buy
other securities, or b) buy MO common, or c) choose to buy MO with some
downside protection (hedging, puts, long/short other tobacco stocks). I choose
option C.

I really prefer to buy quality companies, w/o the litigation risk, that can
increase their dividend and in the long run (5-10 years) will have a higher
yield on cost basis than MO at current prices.

With the sharp acceleration in cigarette taxes, both federal and mainly state,
MO has lost much of its pricing power. that is the real risk in the stock now,
not the litigation. Mo would have to cut marlboro prices almost to equal the
cost of brandX, but the taxes will still keep smokes very high in price. its a
quandry. div is nice, I wasn't aware of SAB as a MO holding. How big a stake do
they have in SAB, and how much of KFT do they still own. I like UST in the

They own 84% of KFT which includes Nabisco and an economic interest of about

In Canada, the governments raised tobacco taxes in the early 90's , to a level
where a carton of 200 cigarettes cost 45$ CDN. The rise in smuggling forced the
govt to cut prices to $28 CDN. The prices are now back to over 40$ CDN.

People will buy smuggled Marlboros from Canada and Mexico if these prices stay
at current levels in the U.S.

Hi

Not all states have monetized the tobacco bonds. i agree that states that have
already sold the tobacco bonds are OK,. They could raise cigarette taxes to
astronomical levels, and not suffer, since the bonds are held by private
investors.

However, many states haven't issued the tobacco bonds yet, so they would be
reluctant to raise cigarette taxes, and thus depress any future cash flow from
the settlement payments.
You can't sell a tobacco bond, if the cash flow from the payments is in
jeopardy due to high cigarette taxes.

Demetre, re: quality companies

"However, it is hard to find good quality companies with solid dividends."

In my view, I'm not having any problem. In my opinion, quality companies with
increasing dividends selling at reasonable prices (without tobacco/asbestos
exposure) include WL, PFE, XOM, BP, etc.

KFT is not immune from the tobacco litigation risks. The KFT IPO S-1/SEC
documents addresses these issues -- although it states the likely negative
impact is minor. KFT being linked to MO causes KFT to be exposed to litigation
impact. Ask any attorney. It would just take a few major cases against MO and
the KFT holding would be part of the settlement package. Attorneys don't miss
these type of issues. :)

I'm not saying what's right or what's wrong about the tobacco issue. The fact
is nobody knows how the litigation will turn out in the long-term. I prefer to
invest in companies where a liability such as tobacco, where supposedly
millions have had their health negatively impacted, does not exist. Others such
as yourself are comfortable with this issue. I respect, but disagree, with your
view. That is why I hedge when I own such stocks. It is the same reason I would
hedge if I owned any asbestos, airline stocks, etc.

But it's pointless to talk about big MO's tobacco exposure, ethical issues,
etc. I believe we could have the same conversation about MO 20-years from now.
:)

Let's get down to some value stocks besides big MO....I like spinoffs, stock
buybacks, positive management changes, low P/E, low P/S, high net cash to stock
price....

MRK is the better value play, but you have to separate Medco from Merk, to do a

Medco provides good sales growth, but low margins.

Pipeline is very important. A big pharma, will have a lower P/E if most of its
patents are near expiration.

PFE has an excellent pipeline.

Thanks for the ideas.

I agree that travel will pick up after the war is over. I am looking at
Airlines such as Air Canada,Travel companies,

Walt Disney might be an option.I am sure that some people are afraid to go to
theme parks with the threat of an attack in Florida or California.

I think Oil will probably go back to around $25-28 when the war is over.

You have to review whether or not the airline has hedged its jet fuel
purchases.

I think retail sales will pick us as well, so I am looking at the apparel
stocks.Less money spent on gasoline could lead to more spending on apparel.

Look for more spending on patriotic clothing when the war breaks out.

Paul, thank you for your post.

I am in software industry and know TIBX for couple years. Bought and sold in
the past. My latest re-entry to TIBX is due to price movement - down nearly
half in two month, plus it is close to cash value. I always try to buy stock at
maximum uncertainty and worst news, I often buy them too early (which was
painful). I just entered my first long position in TIBX, and will buy more at
lower prices. TIBX is having a tough time here with the Reuters issue, but once
it is resolved one way or the other, it should go to normal valuation around
5-7.

ATS is definitely a good value pick. Not sure about its growth potential
(definitely less than SINA when it was at 1.5), but cash alone justify the buy.
I will probably buy some soon, on a bad market day.

re: NHY (Norsk hydro):

Spekulatius, perhaps you may be understating the potential strength of the
company's ancillary activities when you say, "Basically an oil stock with some
Aluminum and Fertilizer business mixed in."

They say they are "one of the three major global aluminium companies", and "the
world’s largest supplier of mineral fertilizers and the only company with a
strong (mineral fertilizer) presence in every part of the world."

I'd say that historically there's not been too much volatility owning this
stock, but book value keeps climbing, p/e is relatively low, and dividend is
generally growing. Or, as you stated, "A very solid but unexciting company."

I've stated my opinion that there are drawbacks that I see that I can't
quantify or really understand to owning companies domiciled in China or Mexico:
so I'll say the same about NHY, which I view as Norwegian company whose
controlling stockholder is the Norwegian government. The government's
priorities may not be congruent with those of small, foreign shareholders.

Anyway, I agree with your analysis, Spekulatius, and I'm in for a starter
amount too, as of today. (Not that my agreement should be construed as a

And that might be possible. P/sales is low at .07. So there might be some room
for margin improvement. Book value is about $7.2/sh vs. stock price close of
$2.79/sh. In past good years, the company's shown an ROE of 15% or more, so
$1.00/sh might be possible m-a-y-b-e at some way-in-the-future date. Two
howevers: 1)gov't pays for RSCR patients and gov't may have altered payment

I personally would not invest in junk bonds and am not an expert on

surprise me to see a credit crunch where junk bonds go up in smoke.

My idea for income investing at this time is government bonds in commodity
based nations. Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Canada fit this definition.
We could be a little early with Norwegian bonds as the currency generally
fluctuates with the price of oil if one believes the price of oil is going to
go down.

IMO the bonds of these countries are quite attractive right now with interest
rates north of 4% for 3 year maturity. They are trading at a premium and the
cash flow on some of these are north of 6%. If one believes as I do the
currencies of these nations will go up in value relative to the US dollar this
cash flow will be worth more in US dollars as time goes on.

managements that none of us have. Even with that, he said: "we expect that we
will have occasional large losses in junk issues".

I would not jump in into junk train just because Buffett invested there. Even

Warren Buffet and junk.

We know a little on the communications deal he did. He bought the debt for 30%
interest and solely secured assets. He also had the opportunity to short the
company stock. I do not think Warren is taking very much risk in the junk bond
arena. If one followed George Soros during the last 30 odd years he plays the
same game where he gets high interest rates on loans to companies if he can
solely secure the assets.

I would suspect Warren is interested in loaning money to some of these energy
companies if he can secure some of the assets for pennies on the dollar. These
cheap assets would be nice additions to his energy company.

People chasing junk bonds today reminds me of people chasing the high priced
stocks during the late 1990's. They are thinking of getting larger interest
income than what makes sense relative to the debt market in general.

Buffett's 2/21/2003 letter

on stocks:
>>>>
We continue to do little in equities. Charlie and I are increasingly
comfortable with our holdings in Berkshire's major investees because most of
them have increased their earnings while their valuations have decreased. But
we are not inclined to add to them. Though these enterprises have good
prospects, we don't yet believe their shares are undervalued.

In our view, the same conclusion fits stocks generally. Despite three years of
falling prices, which have significantly improved the attractiveness of common
stocks, we still find VERY few that even mildly interest us. That dismal fact
is testimony to the insanity of valuations reached during The Great Bubble.
Unfortunately, the hangover may be proportionate to the binge.

The aversion to equities that Charlie and I exhibit today is far from
congenital. We love owning common stocks--if they can be purchased at
attractive prices. In my 61 years of investing, 50 or so years have offered
that kind of opportunity. There will be years like that again. Unless, however,
we see a very high probability of at least 10% pre-tax returns (which translate
to 6.5-7.5% after corporate tax), we will sit on the sidelines. With short-term
money returning less than 1% after-tax, sitting it out is no fun. But
occasionally successful investing requires inactivity.

it is a hackneyed cliche like all the other cliches that drive conventional

global oil production is in the process of peaking for all time. Saudis running
at full production is the wave of the future. oil may fall after the coming

there is certainly a "niche" for department stores. that niche currently
accounts for a 27% of the retail market. unfortunately, that is down from 30%
just a handful of years ago, and will likely continue to decline.

in the meantime, however, there are dept. stores that are quite profitable and
are not about to go away. but they are more like mines with a depleting asset
(their business model and "moat", which is being eroded over time).

Barron's offered the interesting example of Target, which owns some old-line
dept stores like Mervyn's. it milks these stores for their cash flow, and plows
those funds into growing its Target stores. it's not adding square footage at
Mervyn's.

as for quality product, i guess it depends on the shopper. we bought some
oriental rugs recently at Target for 200 apiece. i saw the same rugs at a hoity

REIT - EOP:

Good move. I have a small amount of EOP. I have them pegged at 8.5% yield and
payout ratio of 70%. (i.e. Dividend of $2.00 with FFO of $2.8 or so, so nicely
covered.)

I recently started to track and graph the largest 115 REITs, plotting yield vs.
payout ratio. Most office REIT trade at a "premium" to average, and apartments
trade at a "discount". Others in between. Comparable REITs trade at vastly
different yields, in my opinion. Some of the better deals, and which you may
wish to look at:

apartment: AIV, UDR, EQR, TCT, MAA,TCR,
retail: EQY, DDR,
office: HIW, HRP, EOP, KE,
hotel: HPT (revenue from long term leases, not operating the hotels -- worth
looking at!.)
industrial: FR.
mixed: CLP
other: NHI, SNH.
People have been posting for a couple of years now how REITS are doomed for a
fall because interest rates will increase. Today's headlines don't confirm
that, with rates heading lower, most likely. Plus, I am quite comfortable
taking the dividends forever and not worrying about the principal.

REIT index vs. DOW and S&P:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=&k=c1&t=1y&s=%5Erci&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l&x=on&
=on

Another tidbit, if you build a model of dividend income increasing by a
constant percentage --
For normal ranges of rates, you can just about add the current yield plus the
growth rate to get the total IRR of an investment. Maybe a half point less.
example -- If a REIT is paying 8% and growing at 4%, the long term rate of
return is really around 11.5 to 12%. (Of course you have to assume a cash-out
value 20 years later, I think I used the same ratio/yield as "when purchased".)

And you can mathematicall toy with the numbers and calculate the theoretical
growth rate... if a REIT is retaining 30% of their profit and the ROE is such
and such... I played with it a bit, and determined that the actual risk/reward
of grabbing a higher yielding REIT with a lower payout (higher risk, less
expected growth), seems to be rational. i.e. the slope of the line makes sense.

So then I looked for REITS unreasonably above the line. Some are listed above.

During my brief interest in oil threads, I saw enormous variety of opinions

this has been the experience of the world since at least the 1930s. even back
then, Cassandras were predicting that oil supplies would be exhausted within a
decade. they also predicted the same thing about the US. since none of the
predictions came true, it led to complacency.

but indeed there is a finite amount of oil in the world. there is only a narrow
depth band in which petroleum is generated--about 7500 to 15,000 feet. any
shallower and the earth is not hot enough to crack the biomatter. any deeper
and it's too hot--you crack the oil and get stuff like gas. (of course,
subsequent to generation, the pockets of oil can shift up and down, so they may
be found at a different depth than where they were generated.)

run of the mill oil rigs in the US could already drill down to the bottom of
the oil window in the 1930s.

this is to say that it's not like we are going to drill down 100,000 feet and
find more oil. any biomatter that deep has been zapped. also, further R&D on
discovery and drilling tech is not likely to have as much return. this is
because the big oil cos have invested heavily in tech since at least the 1980s
(their ROI was much higher for oil than anything else, so they plowed money
into R&D). all the low-hanging fruit in this area have been plucked.

as oil prices move permanently higher, more marginal reserves will become
exploitable under higher cost structures (maybe shale at $100 a barrel :), but
this is still not enough supply to change the overall picture.

back in the 1950s, Texas ruled the oil world. in 1956 a guy named M. King
Hubbert predicted US oil production would peak in the early 1970s. people
laughed, but it turned out he was dead right. oil production follows a Gaussian
curve over time. it increases with growing production and discoveries on the
left side of the curve, but eventually these things run out and are eclipsed by
demand. this point marks the top of the production curve. for US production,
they named it Hubbert's Peak.

following the techniques initially used by Hubbert to predict the US production
peak, Deffeyes has put the peak for total global production as occurring
somewhere between the early 2000s and 2009, probably in the 2003-2005 window.
the variance depends on the ultimate exploitable reserves one assumes. probably
a reasonable assumption (according to Deffeyes--i am no expert) is 1.8 trillion
barrels. this gives you a peak date around 2001-2002.

however, being generous, one could assume 2 trillion barrels, which would push
out the peak to 2009. those extra 200 billion barrels are a true Pollyanna
assumption--like adding 22 brand-new Prudhoe Bay discoveries to known reserves,
when we will be lucky to get more than one in the real world.

even under the Pollyanna assumption, however, our ever-increasing global energy
requirements are way too large and petroleum-dependent to avoid a massive oil
shock somewhere down the road in the next decade. the shift to alternative
energy sources is not going to happen even as fast as the incremental demand
increase for petrol from China alone.

Darfot, while your reasoning is plausible, the market is paying very little
these days for things that might happen in 2004, much less something that might
happen in 5-10 years. Before then we will have Venezuela come back on stream
and perhaps full production from Iraq.

(I could make a case that the baby boomers retiring will have far more
investment implications than anything oil might do - and very little attention
is being paid to that.)

If I remember correctly, Deffeyes' calculations refer to conventional oil (i.e.
liquid at room temp). For unconventional deposits, the Athabasca bitumen
deposit alone holds somewhere between 1.6 and 2.5 Trillion barrels of oil, of
which at about 300 billion barrels are considered recoverable with current
technology and at current ($25) oil prices. Proven reserves are 176 billion
barrels, producing around 1MBPD (e.g.,
http://www.syncrude.com/who_we_are/01_06.html ,
http://www.industrialheartland.com/pdfs/Mike_Horner.pdf) . The bitumen is
upgraded locally or is shipped south for upgrading in Edmonton.

Within the next ten years, the region will pump around 2 million barrels per
day, ranking it with the mid-sized OPEC countries.

Between the Athabascan and Venezuelan bitumen deposits, current conventional
reserves, and the potential for Gas-to-liquids technology, I see a cap of $40
for oil for the next hundred years. Upsets in supply could send the price
higher, but only temporarily, IMHO.

interesting. i don't have Deffeyes' book handy right now so i can't check his
treatment of bitumen. i find it hard to believe he ignored 2.5 trillion barrels
of oil--which exceeds his upper estimate for total ultimate global
production--in a single Athabascan deposit without a reason, but will need to
check on this later.

what does it cost to upgrade the bitumen recovered at $25 oil?

The preferred is redeemable 2004 and MANDATORY maturity in 2009. AT $25.
It around a 20% return at today's prices.

There are a lot of preferred that are redeemable now, or over the next few
years. Look at at CEI-a. Redeemable 2-13-03.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cei_pa&d=0b
Price is $19, redeemable at $25. Looks like they are not going to redeem it --
if they do it's a huge windfall. Until then 8.9% yield -- forever. I can't
figure it out.

All I can figure out is that if they redeem it at $25, they'd have to issue new
shares at a higher rate. The cost to them now is $1.69 dividend / $25 = 6.7%.
So they're evidently happy paying the dividend at 6.7%.

...........

And if you are looking for yield, check out ACAS, (and ALD too). Great yield,
insider buying, high short interest, wonderful history, it's my largest
holding.

The short interest is especially reassuring. They shorts have lost their shirts
so far, and it should be much worse for them as they try to cover. The shorts
have around 40% of the float.

Suncor is <$9 per barrel for its blended production, while Syncrude is in the
high teens for its Suncrude Sweet Blend. Both operations remain profitable down
to roughly $22 WTI.

It seems that everyone ignores bitumen because it is halfway to coal in most
peoples eyes. Syncrude, Suncor and Albian Sands obtain their bitumen from
open-pit mines rather than oil wells. They wash the oilsand and skim off the
oily froth and dilute it to recover the 8 API oil.

Recently, some progress has been made with Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage
(SAGD) and with Vapour Extraction (Vapex). There are a few operating SAGD
plants producing a total of a few thousand barrels per day. More than $50
billion worth of capital investment has been announced for the Athabasca
deposit for the next decade.

Grommit, thanks for your comments regarding REIT's. if you would choose just
one REIT, from each of the groups (office, Retail, Apartment, Other), which one
would you choose?

I simply choose EOP because of its size and diversification, the moderate
valuation and the quality of its assets. It's my first REIT investment so there
may be better bargains out there. As far as the dividend tax cut is concerned,
I don't bother to much because the purchase is for a tax deferred account.
Besides that, I believe that REIT should profit from the recent issues
regarding cooperate transparency; after all they are in the simple business of
collecting rent and distributing proceeds to shareholders.

The valuation your described is equivalent to the NPV approach that I have been
posting about some time ago. i will run a NPV model of EOP and intend to post
it later.

Hi

You are forgetting that Russia is increasing production and so are the other
non opec countries. If Russia can double production a few years, with all the
problems of communism in 70 years,

I have faith that Dick Cheney's Haliburton, and other oil exploration companies
will do well in the desert of IRAQ.

I think one key reason why Russia, Saudi Arabia etc oppose US intervention in
IRAQ, is that they know that a PRO USA regime will allow US Oil exploration
free rein in IRAQ.

I think IRAQ could replace Saudi Arabia as a key supplier of US Oil.

I have studied Iraq's history. The Iraqis are civilized and well educated
people. Read the National Geographic profile of Iraq, in the late 80's when
Saddam was an ally of the US against Iran.

Iraq needs to rebuild its infrastructure, after the war. The quickest way is to
increase oil production. The revenues will be used to build schools etc...

If Russia can rebuild using oil, why can't Iraq.?

It is cheaper to find oil in Iraq than Russia.

Comments?

What about Haliburton as a value play? You can't get a better Bush play, since
Cheney was CEO before he became VP

Iraq has much more reserves than the official figures (112B), perhaps another
100B or so, but exploration has understandably been put on hold over the last
decade. The Iraqi deputy oil minister recently said that Iraq holds even more
than that, a total of 300B Barrels.

Demetre Deliyanakis. You said you were looking at the big cap retail (clothing)
plays. In asking you if you had considered small caps, I mean market cap under
500M.

Value picks in apparel retailing might (or might not) include several small
cap. stocks mentioned here over the last year or so that might (maybe) work as
value plays. BL, PERY, some shoe retailers (e.g. MAXS) come to mind.

I think apparel stocks will pick up once the war in Iraq is over.

Oil Prices should fall, which will increase disposable income. Also, with the
terrorist threat down, people may feel more safe going into shopping malls.

Consumer confidence is bound to improve once the war is over.I am not familiar
