I was wrong on LNCO. LNCO is not the general partner of Line LP. It is
basically the same than Line LP but structured as a C-corp. So this saves the
investor the k-1 paperwork, while incurring some tax liability that Line Lp
units holders do not have, which means that LNCO dividend yield will be lower
than Line LP distribution yield. I do not recommend owning such a construct.

LNCO. "while incurring some tax liability that Line Lp units holders do not

The yields of course are also dependent on the stocks' prices.

According to Yahoo, LNCO currently yields 7.5%, about the same as as Line LP.

LINE vs LNCO

I have been tracking both companies. The normal price spread should be between
3%-4% (ie 3% discount owning LNCO to LINE). LINE was trading as high as 7% to
8% but has dropped back a bit. You are correct that it's the relative price
that determines the yield for the distribution. I sold my LINE when that spread
was large and bought LNCO. I also do monitor this price spread with the current
yield and will add and/or sell shares accordingly.

I guess you could see LNCO as a tracking stock to LINE w/o those MLP K1 reports
to bother with.

LINE/LNCO - the reason I wrote that I would not recommend LNCO because I
neither like LINE nor LNCO. I would have liked to own the General Partner of
LINE at the indicated yield because I expect LINE/LNCO to issue lot's of new
shares in secondaries and GP's benefit from that.

LNCO/LINE yield is ~7.8% which is less than what I can get with some pipeline
companies like ETP or BWP without much direct commodity exposure and very long
life assets, so i see no reason to own an MLP with depleting assets (by it's
nature) like LINE or LNCO.

I agree that LNCO relative to LINE looks OK.

Gastar Exploration, Ltd. (GST)
Gastar Exploration 8.625% Serie (GST-PA)
EXCO Resources Inc. (NYSE: XCO)
http://goo.gl/w1t6D

Hi Jurgis

I upped my GSTpA position by 25% after I read their recent earnings call
transcript. This is a pretty big bet for me as I wanted to search out a "pure"
undervalued natural gas play where the risk reward was favorable if/when NG
prices revert to their historical normal price. I have looked at GSTpA and EXCO
Resources Inc. (NYSE: XCO) as two companies that may provide this opportunity.
Each are not w/o risk but for my purposes I believe both will show a beter than
average return when NG prices move higher.

I own the preferrred stock as it is a safer bet for me than owning the common
shares. I am satified that their cash flow is secure for at least another year
and maybe longer based on (1) NG prices stay at current levels and/or move
higher and (2) wells in process come in as expected and on budget. Cash flow
from current and future production is balanced between cap x and funding their
debt. Current projections seem to do both. The ace-in-the-whole is a potential
land sale that will be used to strengthen cash position and/or increase their
revolving credit facility and/or finance their 2013 and beyound Cap X.

The recent Gastar Exploration's CEO Discusses Q3 2012 Results - Earnings Call
Transcript is quite good IF all is true and their projections come in as
discussed.
<blockquote> http://goo.gl/QW0N0 </blockquote> There are a few wild cards in
play too. First the stock and the preferred shares were sold off significantly
due to a law suit filed by Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK). Second, the
company has taken significant impairment write downs due to the way they must
account for lower average NG prices. If NG prices rise, their proved reserves
become more valuable so to me it's just a question of weather they have
sufficient cash flows in their current production to sustain and pay their debt
obligatiions (including the preferreds). Therefore, their assets remain the
same with or w/o the impariment charges EXCEPT that there is some opportunity
loss due to selling part of their NG reserves at historically low prices.

Third, if the company ever is taken out through a merger and/or a buy out, the
preferred shares must be paid off at PAR value (ie. $25/share) w/ a preminum
paid to PAR if done before 2014. This is the reward part of the deal especially
when the preferred is selling at a 32% discount to PAR.

EXCO Resources Inc. (NYSE: XCO) is my other play on my undervalued NG theme.
It's more of a long term buy and hold. The stock is selling at it's 200 day MA
and my recent buys have been in the $6.50/share range.

The other NG play I gave up on was GMX Resources Inc. (GMXR). I do own a few
http://goo.gl/ktwNL but thought that GST had better land assets w/ sustainable
cash flows to make a bet on than GMXR. However, if you bought GMXR near it's
recent lows, it has had a good recovery. So maybe GMXR is a good predictor of
how GST may perform in the future.

My NG theme for the stocks mentioned above represents a 5.6% portfolio
position. The GSTpA monthly distributions are deemed a return of capital.
Therefore, I will be adding shares over time and selling off my high priced
shares after holding one year and one day when there is a gain or booking
losses after any 31 day hold or longer if/when I can buy below my cost basis.
My strategy is to build a low cost position sell any high priced shares for a
capital gain and be in a position to sell at or above par on any merger and/or
buy out.

If cash flows decrease to the extent that they do not cover debt and/or cap x
is reduced significantly, the exit strategy is to peel off 50% of the preferred
shares and perhaps selling short some common shares to hedge the rest of the
preferred position. I will have to re-evaluate my options if this occurs.

For me a value play w/ a good risk reward profile but does present some company
specific risk if cash flows get reduced and/or the cost of defending their CHK
lawsuit increases substantially.

I was aware that LUK is going to do a deal but I was not expecting them to buy
JEF, which is not a business that I would desire to own my self. And if I had
wanted to own it, I would just have purchased the stock myself without paying a
20% premium. As it seem, this deal was a way for Cummings from LUK to get out
and now that JEF management is embedded in LUK itself, JEF is unlikely to be
sold. So know we are not talking about an investment company dealing with
distressed investments any more, but an operating business that mostly consist
of a capital hungry investment bank and a somewhat cash generating meat

TICC is a BDC that makes private debt and CLO investments, mostly outside the
purview of bonds funds. Similar to a closed-end fund, it can trade a premium or
discount to its NAV, which is published quarterly.

I'd say that TICC is like a high yield closed-end bond fund on steriods, with a
higher degree of potential outperformance/underperformance based on how its
loans perform and how the highly leveraged CLOs do.

Hi Joan - Glad to hear your report from the field.

I see that ConAgra Foods, Inc. (CAG) continues to post new 12 year highs even
though I sold my shares earlier this year (ugh!). I continue to hold my ADM and
will add more when it sells below TBV as they are a major player in the AG
sector.

What is surprising to me is the value of farm land (per acre) now in the mid
west. It' more than doubled in the last 24 months. Some say we are headed to
bubble territory like home real estate did in the 2003-2007 period. The
explanation I hear is that since interest rates are so low, the return on crops
(specifically corn and soy beans) nets out better than T-Bill returns. The
appreciation of the land is a bonus.

I am not sure what I would do if I was farming. Once you sell out, you can
never get back in the game. Your kids and grand kids would be set for life.

interesting article. thanks for the post. he makes a good point when he says
that life reinsurance tends to have a lot less of the funky embedded option
stuff than direct writers, and more mortality risk as opposed to investment
risk. i will add them to my watchlist.

one item he is not correct about though...the business is extremely
competitive. OTOH, a good thing is most companies will split up the reinsurance
on any given block several ways, so if competitive several companies can get a
decent share of the pie.

a critical factor is how they reflect post level term in their GAAP reporting.
it would be fun to look under the hood, but not sure if they report enough

Rllee, good question.

Actually most high yield / prefs are bets regarding the solvency of underlying
company. If there were no risks, there would be no high yield. :) There is no
free lunch, as they might say.

So investor has to make up their mind regarding future solvency of JCP, GST,
MHR or any other company they are buying the high yield securities from.

KTP/PFH - there is another wrinkle - they are somehow structured by third party
company and not a direct JCP prefs. I'm not sure right now if this adds another
risk factor (i.e. third party going under). Comments welcome.

I think I should run Z-score and/or Piotroski score on JCP, GST, MHR to see

One item to consider with KTP and PFH -- I have not read the fine print, but
many of these 3rd party trusts that hold bonds are required to liquidate (i.e.,
sell the bonds in the market) in the event of a bankruptcy. This makes these
3rd party trust securities inferior to owning outright bonds if solvency is a
concern. In other words, in the event of bankruptcy I'd rather own the bonds
themselves and take my chances than be forced to liquidate willy nilly in a bad
market.

I would have bought some other land for some reason or other. There are some
great government deals for son's and daughters of farmers to purchase land. The
farming population is getting old and we need young people to take over. We
have a 5th generation farmer now and will have 6th generations farmers. I don't

I bought a bunch of SEP today at 27.3$ average. I did not think an secondary
was imminent but it occured obviously to provide an equity contribution for the
dropdown of the interest in the Maritimes and Northeastern Pipeline from SE.

My models states that we are looking at a very safe 7.2% yield with a mid
single digit cash flow and distribution growth per unit through organic growth
and dropdowns. That is a total return in the low double digits, which is not
bad, given SEP excellent credit metrics, support from the general partner SE
and the lack of commodity exposure (all revenues are fee based).

The only issue is with the NG storage assets that may be less in demand, since
NG is plentifulh, with less need of storage. This may put pressure on renewal
rates, once the contracts are up, but that is only a moderate part of SEP
business.

I regard SEP as an "equity bond".

preferred shares to my losing position. If everything is to be believed in
their report, this is a great value play. I can only assume that some large
seller is forced to liquidate their position "in size" off loading their
preferred position at a loss over the last four trading secession. I confirmed
through a 3rd party that the company is not selling any of their authorized
shares. From their most recent conference call, the authorized shares left to
sell amount to about 77K.

Just speculation on my part "The Seller" may be T. Boone Pickens. Because of
his recent divorce settlement he may have had to sell some or all of his common
and/or preferred holdings. T. Boone through his holding company owns 2% of the
common stock and is/was a big stock holder as of Jun 29, 2012 - BP CAPITAL
MANAGEMENT, L.P. owned 1.77% of GST common or approx 1,164,777 shares. It's
possible he also owns the preferred shares that he could be selling.

http://goo.gl/kSbWs

In any case, whoever "The Seller" is, presents this value opportunity since
such forced liquidation is pricing this paper at an exceptional value price
almost 25% below where it was priced before the selling started four days ago.
So I peeled off 20% of my AMNF with a nice gain (pays a 4% dividend too) to put
into more GSTpA shares (which now yields over 16%). The dividend is a "Return
of Capital" which has no tax effect until the stock is actually sold.
Therefore, I get a good revenue stream of dividends and I hope the exit
strategy will be the sale of the company in 24-36 months. These preferred
shares are paid off at PAR (ie $25.00/share) with my lowest cost shares
receiving an 85% capital gain kicker. That's the long term reward part.

I also have been selling down my MHRpC shares and rolling them into MHRpD as
the D's shares fall in price and their yield passes 10%. I decided to buy
another chunk of the MHRpD shares at $42.67/share (effective yield of 10.67%)
rather than adding to the common shares (for me the risk/reward is better
owning the MHRpD shares). However I own both with 25% common and 75% MHRpC &
MHRpD shares. I will sell another 1/3 position of the MHRpC shares to pay for
these D shares. The MHRpD could be paid off at par $50/share if/when MHR is
sold a Capital gain kicker of 18%. I will eventually move the last 1/3 of the
MHRpC's into more D shares and/or more of the GSTpA paper.

FWIW, MHR and GST own acreage in the Utica shale area w/ wells that produce NG
liquids. About 30% of the value in MHR is their pipeline and gathering system
which is a vary valuable asset w/ predictable revenue streams that are not
subject to changes in the price of NG. Therefore, it is a bit safer from a
risk/reward stand point.

My positions in MHR (common, MHRpC & MHRpD) and GSTpA combined is 15% of the
portfolio so it a rather large bet for me. The position does spin off a
generous monthly income stream that is not taxed until one or more of the
positions are sold since this is a return of capital.

I need to look at SE and SEP again. Sold my SE because I thought it was/is at
fair value even though I really liked their distribution network. SEP is
selling where I originally bought it but I also own quite a few other pipeline
related companies that just had better growth potential. Remember WMB. I loaded
up on that one 3 years ago received a spin off of their E&P company and since
then the stock has gone from $16 to $31. EP was a similar story.

So, yes SEP will yield that 7.2% but no growth kicker. I am not sure where more
of those companies are since many have merged and/or got bought out. The
expansion of the shale gas & oil is creating the opportunity.

I keep turning over stones to see if there are other candidate stocks w/ low
risk and high rewards. For now, I am playing in the preferred sand box. I have
also been scanning the junk bond desk but there you have to be a longer term
holder (2-5 years). My only play there is the SVU 8% bonds that mature in 2016
which I bought at a 15% discount to PAR.

I do expect this correction to last much longer and trade much lower (maybe
back to DOW 10K) or about 250 S&P pts lower. So, many of my new buys are in
preferred paper and/or high monthly/quarterly yielders so if I have to hold, I
generate income. SEP does fit that category but I have been studying many
others too.

FWIW, I bought a small position in SFL yesterday. It used to be a top 5 holding
but sold it out on the last run to $17.00/share. I bought just enough to make
an even lot from the shares I bought around $6.00/share in the depth of the
2009 crash. They have always paid a pretty good dividend (over 10% yield at the
current price) so for me it's a nice one to hold.

SEP does not need a growth kicker. It will keep doing what is has been doing
and will grow in the mid single digits. This adds up to a double-digit return
(distribution yield 7% plus growth rate ~5% est.= 12%total return). This is
possible, even if the economy stalls. If SEP gets some head winds, and/or the
unit prices go up so they can make more accretive dropdowns from SE, the growth
rate will be faster. It is a medium return play with a way below average risk.
I put 7% of my portfolio into it, most of it purchased today. Have another 5%
in ETP and ~10% in a real estate LP. These are equity bonds that should provide
distribution yield and some growth as well, even in a bad economy, fiscal cliff
(which really is a slope rather than a cliff, or not.) This is my macro bet on
QE3 and low interest rates until 2016 (and probably a slow growth economy going
along with it).

BWP is another MLP worth looking into, yielding 8.6%. This one is supported by
L. I don't own it but it does look tempting.

Wow, that's a pretty big bet but I now see your point with the SE dropdowns. I
was trying to figure the same thing w/ SE and it's direct distribution link to
the East Coast and how to capitalize on that. I was going downstream more to
the source of the fuel (ie NG) including the drillers, the NG gatherers,
storage and interstate distributors and then to the end customers (this was
what SE provided). SE was just too expensive but I continue to watch them and
where they are building out systems and who they are partnering with.

I think we are looking at the same opportunity but with different companies. We
both agree the key is risk/reward and safety. I have got a few good names
looking at the partners that SE & SEP do business with. One area ripe for
potential value are the larger NG gatherers and the systems that feed into the
SE distribution network. There is no one major player (usually an MLP) that I
see is at a value price but I suspect a lot more consolidation in this area.

Keep the thread posted on other undervalued midstream operators in this area. I
do see a lot more growth in this region as more NG comes to the market.

I do believe one must be careful as Mr. Market wants to correct 10% from the

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altman_Z-score . Caveat: it has been defined for
industrials mainly although later adapted for other companies. I used the
original version. If someone wants to run the modified version, they are
welcome. Even if I have doubts about the absolute value of the score, relative
values can be enlightening:

GST: -3.4 (yes, minus!)
MHR: 0.1
JCP: 1.53

All companies are deep into BK prediction land. Now, we know that E&Ps have
valuable assets, so bulls may claim that this counters the losses. I won't
argue about this. For me, the most interesting fact is how much better MHR is
compared to GST. From Z-score base, GST is pure basket case.

JCP is also non industrial. Also I took the EBIT of last 9 months annualized.
This is cheating a bit, since upcoming Q is the best for retailers. JCP's
health will depend on results in this quarter.

Retailers are more leveraged than it seems due to lease obligations. To compare
a retailer to an industrial, you would have to add the lease obligations to the
debt, imo.

Industrials typically have fairly small lease obligations, so that adjustment
would make the Z-score for a retailer more unfavorable, comparatively speaking.

KTOS - In at $4.20 this morning.
.
On the Pentagon's Shopping List
By DAVID ENGLANDER / Barrons Sept 15, 2012

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions has built a strategic portfolio of products
that the Pentagon will keep buying, despite a much tighter budget. Why the
shares could more than double.

Concerns about large-scale cuts in Pentagon spending have weighed heavily on
defense stocks in the past year, leaving them at rock-bottom valuations. Shares
of small defense companies, in particular, have sold off, as investors have
tossed out the good along with the bad.

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS) is a victim of such selling, having
fallen 40% in the past year, to $5.07, as investors have turned a blind eye to
its strong portfolio of defense-electronics products, which the military will
continue to order despite a tighter budget.

Investors have gotten hung up, instead, on Kratos' leveraged balance sheet, and
a streak of acquisitions that have muddied its results, obscuring the company's
true earnings power.

That could change in the next 12 months, however. The $155 million acquisition
in May of Composite Engineering, or CEI, a maker of unmanned-aircraft systems
and targets, a deal that was partially financed with a dilutive equity
offering, is likely to mark the end of the buying spree. Kratos now is focused
on integrating its acquisitions, divesting noncore operations, and paying down
debt.

At Friday's closing price, Kratos fetched just six times this year's expected
free cash flow, and 6.5 times 2013 Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization. The shares could be worth more than double
their current price.

Originally known as Wireless Facilities, a builder of telecommunications
infrastructure and networks, Kratos has been transforming itself into a
pure-play defense outfit since 2004, when CEO Eric DeMarco took the helm.
DeMarco previously built up the defense-service company Titan, increasing its
value to $1.5 billion by 2003, from $100 million in 1996. (It was sold to L3
Communications for $2 billion in 2005.)

At Kratos, DeMarco focused initially on buying defense-service companies. But
in the past several years, he has been building a high-technology electronics
portfolio, targeted toward national-security priorities. Kratos has made nine
acquisitions beginning in 2010.

Its wares include unmanned surveillance planes; electronic-warfare products,
such as radar systems for fighter jets; satellite ground systems; and
ballistic-missile and rocket-testing systems. Kratos also makes security and
surveillance products for government and commercial customers.

Specialty products and related servicing generate roughly 90% of revenue;
traditional defense services, the rest. The U.S. government is Kratos' largest
customer, accounting for 74% of sales in 2011.

Kratos is expected to lose $15 million, or 34 cents a share, this year, on
revenue of $962 million, but much of that loss stems from one-time
acquisition-related charges. Adjusted for depreciation and acquisition-related
amortization, cash earnings are in the black. Mike Crawford, who covers Kratos
for B. Riley, sees cash earnings of 62 cents a share in 2012 and 77 cents, on a
higher share count, in 2013, as integration efforts take hold and as revenue
grows 9%. Some $300 million in tax-loss assets will prevent the company from
paying much tax for years.

Demand is strong for Kratos' products. In the June quarter, revenue from
continuing operations rose 4.9% from the previous quarter's level. In the past
year, revenue was up 28.5%, driven by acquisitions. The order backlog is $1.1
billion, with a proposal pipeline of $4.1 billion.

The acquisition of CEI is likely to boost sales growth further. CEI gives
Kratos a strong position in high-demand programs, such as unmanned aerial
targets for combat training, of which the company is the sole supplier to the
Air Force and Navy.

While there is uncertainty about defense cuts, Kratos' product line could be
safe from the axe. Crawford says, in a report, "The Dept of Defense is much
more likely to prioritize funding for programs that are strategic in nature
[rather] than tactical, items such as more tanks, radios, and other ground
equipment."

Kratos has $650 million of debt to cash of $50 million. Net debt equals 58% of
total capitalization. The debt is manageable, given the company's strong free
cash flow, with $45 million expected this year and $67 million in 2013. In the
next year, cash is likely to pile up on the balance sheet.

Kratos' shares trade significantly below historical multiples of similar
defense companies, and could command significantly more in a buyout. Says one
money manager who owns the stock and knows the company well: "The shares are
stupidly cheap here. In a bad environment, they are worth eight to 10 times
Ebitda, and in a good environment, even more."

At nine times 2013 Ebitda, Kratos would be worth $11 a share.

Re SEP, I agree on the simple business plan. While SEP valuation is not
extremely cheap, it has traded for 7%yield only during late 2008/ early 2009
and for a brief period in 2011. It is solidly BBB rated and probably would
deserve a BBB+ rating by itself, except that the GP has a BBB rating and the
MLP rarely or never gets a higher rating than the GP. But while most MLPs cling
to the lowest BBB- rating with a debt of 4-5x EBITDA, SE runs below 3x EBITDA
and a BBB rating.

I consider it as extraordinary safe and with a relatively small market cap
relative to SE, it has room to grow through both dropdowns or organic growth.
The recent selloff in conjunction with the extra leg down from the secondary
has almost caused a perfect opportunity to get into this MLP and I used it to
get a fairly good sized position.

Big Deal for a Baby Berkshire By ANDREW BARY |
http://topics.barrons.com/person/B/andrew-bary/6151

"Leucadia is paying less than book value for Jefferies. That may upset some
Jefferies holders, but there's some consolation because Leucadia trades below
its book value. With the addition of Jefferies, Leucadia's earnings power
should rise, boosting book value. That could lead to an appreciable rise in
Leucadia's depressed share price."

============
Given I'm a fan of growth in book value, this aspect of the article appeals to
me:

"Warren Buffett is a fan of the company, having partnered with Leucadia in
forming Berkadia, a commercial-mortgage servicer and originator. Like Buffett,
Steinberg and Cumming focus on growing book value, and they have a strong
record. The stock has risen at a 19.8% annual rate from 1979 through 2011,
versus a 10.9% rate for the S&P 500. The stock is down sharply, however, from
its 2007 peak of $56, as the price/book multiple has collapsed."

"The Bottom Line: With the addition of Jefferies, Leucadia's earnings power
should rise, boosting book value. That could lead to an appreciable rise in
Leucadia's depressed share price."

Re NSC and CSX - yes you can look The performance of both either way. NSC was a
top performer within it's peers in terms of profit margins and went to be an
average performer. CSX was the bottom of the barrel after the disastrous merger
and now they are average with an apparent momentum for further increases (they
plan to get from 30 to 35% in a couple of years. I think. They will succeed.

Another way if saying that NSC had better cash flow is that they are
underinvesting. My observation with these RR companies is that while they move
together in the short term, the long term performance can diverge quite a bit,
just look at UNP versus CSX and NSC during the last 2 years. It appears to me
that once such a trend in business performance: is established, it continues
for a couple of years. The disastrous performance of CSX after the merger was
another example of that, they did severe damage to their franchise, when they
mismanaged the merger and created a self inflicted problem that took many years

Internet purchases that were not taxed by the merchant? If not, perhaps you
should. :)<<

I actually do pay taxes on most internet purchases, DELL (who orders DELL
nowadays) and soon Amazon are charging taxes. While I admit of never having put
VAT for internet purchases on my tax form, I haven't gotten out of my way to
order online anyways, so it would not have amounted to much. I believe that I
do my taxes fair and never put a deduction in, that I didn't believe i was not
entitled to. My tax rate for sure is much higher than Romney's.

The matter that I brought up is one of basic fairness; some multinational
companies are apparently able to set up the point of taxations, where they want
it to be and it is not where they do the majority of their business, without
any problems apparently. Smaller businesses and individuals can't do that and
are indeed pursued by the IRS if they try to. That is just not fair and I think
it should not be possible either. I think we are at a situation in the US,
where the corporate profits are at an absolute high as a percentage of GNP (as
far as records exist) and corporate taxes are at or close to a low by the same
measure.

Ok, enough now before I sound like a socialist (not a bad word in Europe by the
way) rather than an investor.
