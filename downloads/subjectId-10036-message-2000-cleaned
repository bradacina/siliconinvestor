James,

A while back you made a posting about WHX stating that it offered lessons in
the merits of Value Investing. I would like to offer another lesson.

I bought BOTX months ago @ $4.25. It was an unrecognized value play selling
well below BV. They had a bad period in 1996 but had successfully turned the
company around to good profitability. All I had to do was be patient and wait
for the market to discover what I had found.

I sat on the stock thru two excellent earnings reports, yet the price never
appreciated above 4-7/8. I had found another stock that I felt was poised to
move. As BOTX wasn't going anywhere, I decided to sell it, sure that I could
buy it back later near the same price, perhaps lower. I sold at 4-3/4 to buy
the other stock.

The other stock did fine, up 20%. At the same time, BOTX went from 4-3/4 to
9.00, up 89%. Had I just waited 2-3 more weeks...

Buying on value requires patience. When the market is going up, it's very
difficult to hang onto a stock that isn't moving, but a good value buy will
likely, eventually, give a better return. Since you never know when that move
will happen....

Learning from my mistakes,
Ron

Ron, looks like it was the 4thQ earning report of 0.55 vrs 0.15 on the 22nd
which did it. You might still be able to get it back at $6 or so, as the
interest level looks generally very low on this company and it seems to be
falling off already since the 22nd. Scott

Used AAII for years but gave up last year because the quarterly updates did not
permit timely screening. The richness of their data base and friendliness of
search tool(foxpro I believe) were outstanding. Have you heard of any internet
based screening services which provide comprehensive search factors and
relatively current data? WSRN is great but rather limited as to factors.

Well let's see if you guys are strong enough look at some history on this
thread. We're gonna see if if takes time for value to play out and we're gonna
see if the calls here are any good -- value or not. I gonna tell you who can
give good stock ideas and who is the best durn stock-picker on this thread. I'm
gonna name names... if you can't take it, jump off now, 'cause I'm gonna look
you right in the eyeball and tell you what your performance is.

If you wrote it and I read it, then you own it. It's about the statements THEN,
not about you or your opinion NOW. I'm puttin' the names to the stocks, because
I can learn something from that, others can too maybe, plus I just like to
raise some Hell once in a while -g-. I like a little conflict, so you got my
okay to shoot back at me.

Okay,I'm not trying to judge people or ideas in any serious way. After all,
Peter Lynch made a lot of his money from his wife and her one recommendation of
Hanes (or so the story goes). I'm just trying to review what I've been doing
and saying and following and not following, to see if I can improve my
perfomance. If anybody could give me a Hanes idea that I used, I'd be thrilled
- they don't have to be Buffet, Lynch, or Tweedle Dee.) And my guess is, it may
not be possible to evaluate all the ideas and recommendations on the thread in
any serious way -- at least not without spending a lot of time and effort.

So, it's gonna be a snapshot. Just going back 6 months. Where were you on or
about March 12-April 1, 1997? If you posted here, your record looks about as
follows (and I feel just like Hulbert in his rankings of funds/newsletters
--g-- - plus I'll take literary liberties too with my interpretations of what
was said/suggested/offered/recommended):

Stock prices are then (my best guess from Yahoo charts if not stated in post)
vs. now (Fri. close or approx.)

Ramamoorthy: Employee Solutions 5 vs. 5.11/16

Ken Weiss: HIAI (a BB: penny stock. I could not find prices)

Robert J. MLHR 30 vs. 52.3/4 (Strong rec. by Robert J.; I posted back that I
thought this office furniture maker was too expensive at 30 with a pe of 22.
Today Yahoo shows pe of 33.) Others posted too. (Nice call by Robert J.)

Gottfried Mauersberger: ESV= Ensco 21 vs. 37. Said he owned it and liked it.
(Nice move)

Wayne Davidson: ACAR 1 vs. 19/32 (from his list of stocks, he rec'd one reply
about this stock)

E. Newman: Value Vision =VVTV 3.5 vs 4.13/16. (VVTV recently mentioned again)
(Good percentage move in this penny stock)

Mike Burry: TLC 6.5 vs 13.3/4 (Several posts of discussion inititated by Mike's
post) (A double!)

James Clarke: St. Joe Paper (76 vs. 96.5/16) (Florida East Coast asset play, I
believe mentioned a couple of times before??)

James Clarke: Mesa Airlines 6 vs. 6 (not actually recommended outright... more
like a possibility)

H. Sullivan: MDCD 3.5 vs 5.1/8
Mike(My Opinions Only): also concurring and adding info. on MDCD

James Hopkins: PSInet (6 vs. 8) (confidently recommended by him)

Bruce Russell, Scott Warkwick: Clayton=CMH. 13.5 vs. 18 (Has come up several
times on this thread and I keep missing it :>( . Several posts worth of comment
in Mar. by Russel and Warkwick ---nice result)

Jeff Maresh: SEHI (10 vs 10.3/4) OH (19 vs. 28.1/4) Alternate suggestions to
CMH mentioned by Jeff. (The combo worked out very nicely!)

Mike Burry: Premenos= PRMO (6.1/2 vs 15)
(Applix also mentioned in his post 7.5 vs 8.5.) (Arggghhhh. This thread even
calls out PRMO in its description. How can anybody be so blind as to overlook
-again and again- this stock when it's at the 5.5 to 6.5 level? Must be easy
-g-... I ignored it many,many times ... and thought it was fair valued or
better in March at 7.5)

Bob Davis: MTY 3.75 vs 5.75. (I posted I thought is was fair valued or
overvalued. In spite of a recent acquistion I still think the same--even though
the stock's gone ever higher. In same post I knocked someone else's MDCX at
4.2, and another's FFST at 3 (now 6).
Looks like if you listened to me, I was dangerous to your financial future -g-

Paul Senior: KWP (35 vs 43) (Uh, unhappily for me I bought most at 37-39 and
sold most of position recently at 39 after I heard a rumor of bad news about to
befall the stock.)

Well, it looks like Mike B. is the unofficial 6 month winner based on a totally
unscientific study over an uncontrolled message board by a researcher using
totally arbitrary rules and analyses -g-. And since it looks like the author is
himself, the worst of the posters, it is likely that this study will not be
duplicated or replicated in future by the author -g-.

Actually, I am very surprised that almost all the posts of recommended stocks
during the 2 week+ period in March worked out positively (gained). Could be
because people with good ideas who were willing to post here actually knew what
they were talking about (excepting me of course -g-). Still, I find it
uncomfortably strange that so many and varied stocks all seemed to gain. Maybe
more likely it was a low point for small-caps, mid-caps before the market rose.
Seems so easy in retrospect... just pick what a couple of people here are
recommending or what gets talked about... buy a package...and hold on for 6
months.
And as for me and my opinions... I'm humbled but unrepentant. Stocks can go way
above fair value, so I can be right to say there's no margin of safety or the
value is not there. Of course, since most people want to be rich rather than
right... it's more important to predict what the stock price will be in future
- and that is a task that requires luck as well as skill.

Good investing all!

week's Business Week magazine.

I am not sure how up-to-date online services are for other than price data. I
treat it as a screening vehicle. First thing i check is to bring info up to

Nah. He's out. Posted his pick Feb. 13. Doesn't qualify. -g-

But what a great call. And it was posted and discussed and reposted and... -by
me- checked out and rejected. (Not that I'd easily change my mind and buy on
the way up at higher prices. Was it Charles Allmon who said buying stocks was
the only business where if the price of something (the stock) doubles, only
then do people get interested and want to buy it?)
And that was just one of several good Justin V calls. I think NVLS? was another
... I couldn't see to swing at that pitch either :>(

HOWEVER, I am very encouraged because Justin likes NCR, and I've got NCR too -
plus I'm willing to buy more down AND up :-)

Justin, if you read this don't respond. Let me have my dream, eh? Which is that
you were mentally prepared and confident and committed in what REAL was all
about and its subsequent move. You bought and bought and now you about to cash
out (pay that big cap gain tax- help us poor folk) and retire. You could care
less about some cockamamie review of past days or the clown(s) on SI. They had
their chances. It's off to Europe/Caribbean for a while. Then maybe start that
mutual fund. (I'll buy in... -g-). Justin, don't tell me it ain't so.

Paul - All, Paul I like your review of past picks it gives a nice perspective.
What do you think of this suggestion for value hounds?
Each interested person pick your favorite value stocks and build a portfolio of
100,000 (min of 3 stocks, long only, no options). We can update our status
using the closing price of a last trading day of the month. We should submit
our picks before trading begins on 1 Oct 97. In your initial post, please
include your reasons for picking this stock.

IMHO this would be an excellent way to mutually learn from our collective
successes and mistakes.

<<Each interested person pick your favorite value stocks and build a portfolio

Great idea. This sort of exercise would be informative and
probably desrves its own thread -- how about starting
a thread called Value Portfolios or something?

Another idea is for each long-time participant to make a list
of his/her past recs here, with performance measures and
analysis of the mistakes/good decisions. There may be
some gold still worth mining in those recs. I'll do this
myself when I have time and post it here.

Chris: might work. Also here's a site you might find interesting

http://www.marketplayer.com/ I've tried their stock screen and looked over
their contest(s). Seems like some people participate to win the contest (like
all money on one stock - do or die). Which is okay. But there are others who
are trying different portfolio strategies that seem interesting.

In spite of my surprise that I found the value stocks here (or the posts
anyway) to have worked out very well in six months(I mean very well from my
perspective - if you had REAL as a 5-bagger, you might think everybody else's
picks were very poor), I still think that value stocks take a long time to work
through. They can be dead money for month upon month- and year upon year has
been typical in previous decades. (Gee, I never thought ---maybe it's just my
picks that are just so slow.-g-. I better think about this some more.)

For me, I would prefer to believe that when people post and say they bought it,
they actually bought the darn thing. I've much more assurance that somebody
might actually know what he/she is talking about when I can expect that they
put their money behind the position. If it becomes a contest or game, for me it
adds another level of complexity that I've got to work through - is someone
posting just to win? are we seeing all their ideas, just their best ideas, some
playmoney ideas, real money buys and real money sells, what?

Paul,

I thought I could learn something by going back thru the list of successful
stock picks that you posted. I wanted see if I could figure out what made those
stocks good value buys at the time they were posted to the list. Using end of
'96 numbers as a basis for stocks picked in March. I didn't look at all, just
some of the big gainers.

The only thing that even came close to a 'Value Buy' was REAL selling at 1.5 BV
and a PE of 6. The rest were at high PE & BV multiples then and are at much
higher multiples now.
TLC stands out as a major deviation from criteria for Value Stocks.
PRMO, the winner on your list, was selling near BV, but had a -.15 EPS then and
-.27 now. What justified the price going from 6.5-15?

With the exception of REAL, the stocks I looked at from your list have done
little to justify the price increase and, as near as I can determine, had
little to offer as Value Stocks in March.

I applaud the good picks and the profit gains made, but didn't learn much about
picking stocks on value.

For what it's worth,
Ron

Ron,....oops... inadvertently erased a post to you.

Here's the gist of it: We need the orginal posters to give us their thoughts.
Each of us has his/her own idea of a value stock. Meanwhile,

I checked PRMO thread for Mar '97. Mike Burry posted some financial info.
(almost $5 in cash for the $6.50 stock). But from other posters, I agree w/you;
they didn't see compelling reason to buy the stock either.

TLC thread posters - on the other hand - were pounding the table for a buy. TLC
had a lot going for it.
Also, a lot against it (tons of debt,unexpect lower sales).

CMH looked good (to me) compared to its past numbers. A growth stock (IMO) that
stumbled. A bet on mangement and the mobile home (and financing) business. (I
wanted to wait until 1-2 points lower - never got there and so I missed the up
move.)

Do you have a war story from that time period (Mar. '97)?

Ron,

Re: PRMO and TLC

If value investing were just a set of numbers
and the same thing to everyone, it wouldn't work.

PRMO was trading at an enterprise to sales ratio
of 0.40. This for a traditionally high margin business.
Also, it was buying back shares -- I love that, as
I've mentioned before. It had
5 bucks of cash and traded as low as 5.25 despite
having a viable product according to my industry sources.
That's value and a definite margin of safety, IMO.

TLC was less obvious:
Price 6.5
Book 4.4/sh
Revs 8.4/sh; 3 year sales growth is 94 121M, 95 167M 96 343M
5 straight Q's of $2-4 losses due to charges.
Last Q .60 (-2% from estimates)not including charges
LT Debt/Equity =2.54 (key, IMO)
Current Ratio 1.864
Free Cash Flow 1.544 (also key)
44M shs out

Note that sales growth was huge over the three years noted.
Yet the shares had fallen to a >20% discount to sales.
Its cash flow remained positive despite the losses -- a
key point to look for according to Ken Fisher. And of
course it was buying back stock. The current ratio
told me the business wasn't in immediate trouble. And
it has a great international franchise.

The more experience I get, the more I learn to look for --
1) Stock buybacks
2) Discounts to sales that are historically extreme for
a company
3) Positive cash flow during a rough patch
4) Margin of safety -- if a stock has $5 bucks in cash
and is trading at 5.25, then the upside/downside
ratio is gonna look good;
5) Insider ownership/buying at stock lows
6) In tech stocks, stocks that have been on a horrendous
fall because they failed to live up to their hype, yet
have strong balance sheets and other value characteristics.
IMO, Applix, which has recovered to 8 from where I
noted it at 4-5 is one of these now. The risk is higher
now, but at 3 1/8 (its low) it was a steal. Even now, it
is an only a moderately aggressive buy.

I'll take a WHX when it comes along, but that only happens
every few years. The rest of the time, I find I have to
compromise a criteria or two to make the stock fit.

I'm no expert - just IMO.

Good Investing,
Mike

Mike,

PRMO & TLC were great buys at the time because they did run up. Any stock is a
great buy if it runs up after you buy it. Do you own these two now or have you
taken profits? The secret is knowing when to buy, but I have found it just as
important to know when to sell. "Know when to hold 'em, ...."

My point is that the big gainers Paul listed were not, with a couple of
exceptions, traditional 'value' stock buys. They were very good and well
researched, but still speculative.

Paul - From that period one definitely stands out - SNDK. On news that they
would have lower than expected earnings, stock fell from $17 to $8.50. I caught
the drop and went in heavy. This was nearly BV for a company with $60M cash, PE
of 14, and major growth. It lingered there then started up. I sold it off when
I felt overvalued (PE:Growth) yet it has continued up and is now selling for
$35.00. The wild thing about it is they've shown flat revs and lower earnings
the last two Qs, actually showing a loss on operations saved by Royalties and
interest income. Everyone thinks it will be the next Intel yet they have major
competition from other companies, one with a better product and
diversification. (I have FLSHF)

Do I wish I hadn't sold SNDK so early? Of course, but I would do it again. It
went overvalue at 17.00, but the market likes it at 70 PE.

You are familiar with the parlay of DSWLF (14.75-22), into NTAIF (13-22), into
ELAMF (8.50-11.25) that started about then. These were 3 undervalued companies
priced right at the right times and provided over 300% gain in about 3 months.

I don't make recommendations, but I own and have posted to this thread: AMTD
@15.625, SWST @16.00, and more recently were JWC @8.00, NH @25.50, and CMIN
@16.625. Latest buys are ELAMF and DSWWF, both owned earlier and now rebought.
Mistake I posted was NATS (sold when they borrowed money at 15% interest). I
made the 5% dividend as profit.

My single best buy this year has been SWST @16. On post bell report of 10%
dividend, I doubled up at 23.75 before the bell, shorted entire position at 28,
sold the double @26, rebought to cover short @23.5. I get the 10% stock
dividend plus regular dividend. Position now <$4.00. AMTD has also been good.

I haven't had a worst buy. I sold WBB at a loss I didn't need to take and I
really blew it on BOTX. I had a large note in my file on it 'don't sell until
after earnings report' and still blew it.

Posted too much, don't know when to stop when I start.

Ron

IMO, they would have been great buys then even if they
hadn't moved. The story behind the value validates
the value, not a 6 month subsequent price history.

Mike,

That didn't come out the way it was meant. (one of my major problems when
posting) You had good value buys that weren't apparent without extensive
research and should be applauded for doing that research ahead of the market. A
good value buy will eventually move up and six months is not necessarily a true
time test.

I agree that PE, BV, PSR or other factors we might see with a quick look do not
necessarily indicate a good value stock. While I look at these things, I am
more interested in determining management's ability to take the company
forward.

I also have a tendency to sell too soon but sometimes I get lucky and sell near
the top before a fall off. I am using stops more.

On the Portfolio great idea. few thoughts as you have said the portfolio is not
a contest but for learning, shouldn't each portfolio then be set up as the
individual would normaly? I personaly beleave in equal % in each stock as a
rule but will vary from that in some cases such as WHX which at one point
amounted to upwards of 75% of my portfolio. Should people be able to buy and
sell as news can effect decisions on what one would do with a given stock?

Bass brothers seek Canadian targets

The Texas billionaires have signed veteran Bay Street adviser Horst Hueniken to
identify market
laggards in Canada

By SANDRA RUBIN
The Financial Post
Texas billionaires Sid and Lee Bass, fresh off the acquisition of a piece of
troubled Moore Corp., are actively hunting for more Canadian underperformers to
add to their stable of investments. The brothers signed veteran Bay Street
adviser Horst Hueniken a little more than three weeks ago to scope out
potential candidates, The Financial Post has learned. Hueniken, who spent
almost seven years at Burns Fry Inc. before moving to Gordon Capital Inc. three
years ago, will be a Toronto scout for TMI-FW Inc., the Bass family's
investment firm. He declined to be interviewed.

When the Basses buy, bosses quake.

They have a reputation as sharp investors who identify market laggards, acquire
a minority stake, then ride herd on management to create value.

Take Walt Disney Co. They bought a 25% stake for the equivalent of a few
dollars a share in the 1980s, then helped install a young executive named
Michael Eisner to run the show. Today Disney shares trade for more than US$78.

The reclusive brothers and investment adviser and partner Tommy Taylor have
publicly dipped their toe into Canada a few times with equity stakes in Encal
Energy Ltd., Trimac Ltd. and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., as well as Moore. It's
believed they are in other Canadian firms, but they are either private
companies or the investments are below the level required for public
disclosure.

The Basses were not available for comment. They haven't participated in an
interview since 1984 and even have a deal with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram not
to distribute photos of them, for security reasons.

But TMI-FW spokesman Clive Bode said they're stepping up the pace in Canada
because they believe there are good investments available. "We know their
system, because it's pretty close to ours," he said from Fort Worth. "It's a
rational market, it's not like investing in Thailand.
"We think there are opportunities there that are just as good as in the U.S."

All four public Canadian deals have been done with the giant Ontario Teachers'
Pension Plan Board. But Bode said the Bass brothers aren't wedded to Teachers'
for future investments.

He bristled at suggestions TMI-FW is heading north because Canadian markets are
not as extensively covered or valued - and could hide some bargains.

"We are not vulture investors," he said. "We are looking for things where we
sense shareholder value.

"So if we look at a company, and it's priced where everybody thinks it should
be priced, but we think there is a tremendous potential in that, we would
invest. Just as we would in a company that looks like a problem, but where we
think it's going to get over that problem and revert to the mean."

He declined to point to specific stocks or even sectors the group has in its
sights.

But Noranda Inc. and Seagram Co. were named as possible investment targets by
market players and observers.

"Noranda has an asset value that probably way exceeds its stock price," said
one institutional trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's got some
things in there that might be weighing it down, like Noranda Forest.

"I think Noranda potentially could be a very good company for them. And what
about Seagram? There's a stock that's doing nothing."

Placer Dome Inc. could also be in the lineup, the trader said.

Fred Ketchen, chief equities trader at ScotiaMcLeod Inc., said CAE Inc. and
Nova Corp. are two underperformers that also have to be considered. "Nova is a
growth stock that doesn't grow," said Ketchen. "The stock is still in the $11
or $11.50 range. "As for CAE, there again, as far as the performance of the
stock is concerned, it seems to me it's been in the $10 to $12 range
since Solomon was a boy. And that's a long time ago."

Bill Riedl, president of Fairvest Securities Corp., said there are another
couple of possibilities in the oil patch. "Northstar Energy [Corp.] is
undergoing digestion of its last acquisition. I don't think it's a long-term
problem, but it is a stock that seems undervalued at the moment. The Bass
family might say: 'Here's an opportunity to get a good position in it.' " He

Check out the consumer finance industry. Its been in a lot of turmoil

great buys. Here are a few: these prices are from 8/14/97
Ctys 10.50

I like CTys earnings expected to be over 2 dollars this year and the next..

I would definitely put this in the high risk category.. These stocks are
sitting at PE's around 5.

Once the verdict is out on Consumer Finance and people(wallstreet) realizes
they aren't going out of business you should see the stocks PE's rise to a
respectable level.. Ctys with a Pe of 15 = a $30 stock. But again there is a
reason these stocks are being valued this low, UNCERTAINTY.

IMO, they would have been great buys then even if they hadn't moved. The story
behind the value validates the value, not a 6 month subsequent price history.

Exactly right, Mike. The more time value investors spend on 'business movement'
and the less they spend on 'price movement', the better they'll do.

The first part of Scloss' statement is the most important. Buy a stock when Mr.
Market won't look at it; eventually, he'll get around to looking again.

Selling 'too early' means only that the price continued up, mostly for
irrational reasons. Avoiding participation in 'greater fool' investing is a
virtue. There's _always_ something more fairly valued than something that has
run beyond reason, even if it's cash!

Damn, you're brave! I bought some WHX pfd B at 37, but unfortunately wasn't
brave enough to buy the common. When the pfd dropped to 30, I was afraid to buy
more, thinking that maybe someone knew something, for example that the company
would omit the dividend on the pfd stock. However, it quickly rebounded, and I
never learned the reason for the quick dip to 30.

By the way, I'm still holding my pfd B, which is now trading in the 44-46

doesn't go bankrupt and the new ceo (the previous guy lasted about 3 mo) can
turn it around, I figure it could work out... but in that 3 year timeframe.
With some of these consumer lending co.'s any sharpie can show profits...just
lower the lending standards and book more revenue. But eventually the trail of
the deadbeats stops at the doorstep. On the other hand, there is a demand by
many honest people for consumer loans, so there is (or should be) a legit. and
profitable business out there. But which co or co's will prosper, I do not

The key is resolution of the problems in Latin America, both from a business

Management is excellent, has a _huge_ stake in the outcome, and will find a way
to do it.

I am watching closely _how_ they attack the problem. They have been very frank
in admitting it (which is very important to me), but I have not yet seen the
plan. I suspect (but don't yet know for sure) that the central problem is
getting the sales people excited again after their promotional programs failed
to produce sales for these sales people (many of whom are new to doing this
kind of thing). It's going to be a 'down in the trenches" effort that could
take a couple of quarters to deal with. I will wait until the November filings
to see what management has to say. By then, even though they are reporting on
the 9/30 quarter, they should be in a position to discuss how they intend to
approach the problem.

The analysts now hate it, so there isn't any hurry. And I am not comfortable
moving until I can evaluate management's approach. If what they say makes

Darth, the B is callable starting TODAY at $52.625 although don't think it will
be called, based on the dividend its unlikely to go any lower than it is right
now, based on the conversion rate of 2.451 shares I would use a rule of thumb
to calculate the value as
WHX x 2.451 +div*3 (minimum about 45$, however as you move above the $52.625
call the premium will decrease to approx 5%)..

It seems to me to be more of an income play right now, unless WHX moves up to
the $20 range when you could start shorting the common, shorting some common
now while it would reduce your downside risk, IMHO is not worth it since the
downside risk is so small, based on WHX's asset base and rapidly improving
financials.

I fear that I was discombobulated by Ron's post, but I was intrigued by Scott's

shares of the common for each share of the Pfd B that I own.

I'll have to sit down with some scratch paper and think about what the
implications would be for such a move.

It's actually surprising to me that many investors are willing to pay more than
the callable value for preferred stock. For example, BS pfd is callable at 50,
but has traded as high as 55. The good yield that the stock offers isn't enough
for me to take the risk of losing almost 10% of my investment in the event the
pfd is called.

My rule is that the market will always do what it would have done anyway
without the news, and look for an excuse - except in very
rare situations where there is a real surprise of broad significance.

That said, I am concerned about all the warnings in the tech area.
It is hard to imagine that sector doing well if companies of all stripes are
saying business is not so hot. If that sector's leadership is lost
the rest of the market may have some difficulty moving ahead -
except that I am relatively optimistic on a key factor for stock prices,
interest rates.

Therefore, I suggest a cautious posture to buying new stock, but that
the overall market is probably still OK.

Chris,

Don't remember which Forbes issue, isn't in my notes.

Have 3 pages of info gleaned from Q reports, would be a very long post. They
indicate a management interested in increasing shareholder value and have been
very creative in their methods. Some of the deals they've made concerning stock
buybacks, with lending banks, and the latest AGRO purchase were very
impressive.

JWC comparison to other brokerages is outstanding. They don't carry the heavy
debt load and are covering most all business from their own monies. Also, they
do not rely on trading volume for a major portion of their profits like most
do. Their alliance with Bear Sterns gives them access to exchanges most small
firms don't have and provides them with market making that would normally be
unavailable to small brokerages.

I found them by reviewing firms in the brokerage sector. Also found SWST @ 16,
AMTD @15.625.

www.jwcharles.com is the homepage and it's pretty good.

I'm in at 7.5, but the current 8.25 is still a very good buy in price for a
company of their historical growth and PE of 5 and BV of 5.32.

They were a BB stock, went on AMAX in May.

For what it's worth,

Paul,

Thanks for your input. Right now my portfolio is concentrated in 4 stocks,
blend in a bit of WHX. I recently sold two others, because I believed both to
be currently overvalued. My portfolio is concentrated and possibly over
concentrated. It will eventually get back to 5-10 different securities over the
next year.

My personal style usually favors one to three stocks heavily. I invest only for
the long term, and don't need the money for many years. As far as what level of
diversification is best, I don't have a final answer. My current one is how I
have my portfolio, and how plan to evolve it over the next year.

Where did you learn to do what you are doing?

It is a style that I like. In Strategy (Game or Military), all significant
gains are made by focusing or concentrating your strength in the most critical
areas. The famous Warren Buffet said ".he would attempt to purchase a few of
the very best businesses at reasonable prices. He would not be interested, he
said, in purchasing shares in each business in town." This is from Berkshire's
1991 annual report.

Now, I'm not exactly sure how to define `the very best businesses'. That is why
I'm following the Value Investing Thread, to broaden my views. The only place I
seem to find `reasonable prices' is primarily in the mid/small/micro cap area.
I currently follow 10-15 companies in detail, and keep an eye on another 10 or
so other prospects. I would like to know that other people have tried and
either with success or failure. My personal interest in aggressive
long-term(5+years) growth.

Chris,

Just to throw in a few words of encouragement. I feel very much the way you do.
I find I do best when I make only a small number of decisions. Another quote
from Buffett, "If you can make 10 good decisions in your life, you can afford
to give away 5." I don't know about the specific companies you have invested
in, but I invest totally in just a few stocks that I have researched
thoroughly. I find it is much more efficient use of my time. Is this more risky
than buying several stocks? Those who show that risk can reduced through
diversification should also show that rewards can reduced. I have infinitely
more confidence that I can make one right purchase than ten. In calculating the
long term return from companies, Buffett uses the long term government bond and
doesn't adjust for risk. Why? Because, as he says, he reduces his risk
substantially by selecting good companies. Diversification is what you do when
you don't know what you are doing <g>!

Anyway, I lurk here, I don't spend a lot of time posting because it takes too
much time. I'm not criticizing Paul Sr. he makes a great contribution here, I
just thought I'd add my $0.02 to balance things out a bit.

Good investing to all, no matter what your style.

Wallace,

As I read it, revs fell from lower market making. The 2nd Q was a slow Q for
IPOs and other offerings, a large part of their business. Much of it comes from
Bear Sterns.

Revs and earnings were hurt partly by:
losses on their 25% AGRO holdings that prompted them to take it over
and costs to open up the NY branch

They've been making a lot of changes this past year. I note that BV increased
in spite of flat earnings and will increase about 10% with the AGRO aquisition.
In addition, it gives them $4.7M additional liquidity as AGRO funds were
basically uninvested. This Q may be slow, but I expect a major increase as they
put the AGRO monies into play.

Wallace,

As I read the dip in revs for JWC:

They had a $2.8M decline in commission revs from the prior year. 1996 was an
exceptionally strong trading year for them. This is not a major part of their
operation nor is it highly profitable. Associated with and partly a cause of
the lower commissions is the $2.5M decline in market making activity. This is a
major part of their business. The early part of this year wasn't conducive to
IPO and stock offerings and most firms had a decline in this business. This
market is now getting stronger and I would think JWC would benefit.

Revs & earnings were hurt by AGRO losses and lower stock price. They had a 25%
stake. This is the primary reason they decided to take it over. AGRO had $4.7M
liquid assets that now go into JWC. The benefits of this added liquidity should
show up next Q.

Earnings were also hurt by the costs to open the NY branch without offsetting
revs.

In spite of the lwoer revs and extra costs, earnings only declined 137K and EPS
increased by 36% due to the buyback. BV/S increases about 10% with the AGRO
acquisition.

As I posted, this is not your average brokerage that relies heavily on trading
activity. They have a core of clients that rely on them for money management
and, with the alliance to Bear Stern, a strong market making business. They are
primarily a Florida brokerage dealing with a select group. While they might not
perform as well in a strong bull market, they won't suffer much when the bears
come out. One of the reasons I like it.

My take on it,
Ron

Remember St. Joe Corp. Pure asset play. They own 3% of the land in the state of
Florida. A long sleepy value stock that "would never go anywhere". I just got
my 12 month double - and then some. And this puppy has been at least 20% of my
portfolio all the way up. I defy anybody to show me that I took a dollar of
risk at 65 last October. Efficent market - HA! Couldn't resist tooting my own
horn on this one because for the last year I've pitched it to everybody who
would stand still. Up another 16 (yes, sixteen!) on a still ambiguous
transaction announced today. For the first time I am at a loss for words on St.
Joe. If anybody can figure out this transaction before the market does there
could be a great trading opportunity. I know this stock as well as anybody, and
the announcement today boggled my mind. A 16 point gain and a HUGE breakout on
just 54,000 shares of volume. I have never seen anything like it. I always say
- buy cheap stocks and the "surprises" tend to be good.

Regarding learning successfull investing: I've read a lot of books
on the "how to", and the one statement that made the most sense
to me was one that stated that each person will have a different
style. For instance, I am very risk averse, but don't mind selling
stocks that continue to go up. (If you're risk averse you soon get
used to this sad fact.) I've tried other techniques, but the one that
works best for me is to hunt around among beaten down stocks.
Every day I look at least at the 10 most declined for Nasdaq, then
at stocks mentioned here, etc. (Among Nasdaq drops for Oct 1,
IKOS and REPT made me look twice, but they would have to
drop farther to get me to buy.)

On the other hand, I have friends who can intuitively figure out
what story the herd is going to swallow hook line and sinker before
the herd figures it out. They make a lot of money, but I can't take
the worry. I only buy stocks I would be willing to hold for 10 years.

But I have learned not to hold them for 10 years. This is because
things change. New information comes out, not always nice. So
now I take my profits before news gets a chance to prove why
that stock that took a dive was a dog. I try to hold less than 3
months. I know this will horrify the buy and holders, but I mostly
trade in my IRA, so there really isn't any reason to risk long term
stock ownership.

In other words, I look for little gains in undervalued stocks rather
than trying for home runs. I hate to admit it, but gains over 10-year
periods probably requires knowledge of management. That's
what Buffet allegedly does, but he has to, I don't. The reason
he has to, is that he makes too much of a dint in the market to
do short-term trades. It's a lot harder for Warren to book a 30%
gain over a year than it is for me. He has to diversify. Naturally
the people who want you to invest in mutual funds tell you that
diversification is the most important thing. But time-diversification
is equivalent to portfolio diversification, provided that the time
interval is small relative to the rate at which stocks change
price.

And short term trading allows me to hone skills in trading. I hate
to call it Trend Analysis. A better term would be Market Analysis.
Prices have to move around some just to find a price that attracts
as many long term buyers as it does long term sellers. Or maybe
prices move around because of random changes in the ratio of
buyers and sellers at "the market" as opposed to limit orderers.
Whatever the cause, there is a pattern in prices, and it is possible
to time those small bumps. I think that those small bumps cannot
possibly all be due to the release or dissemination of knowledge.
There just isn't that much information around. So short term timing
is, I am convinced, some sort of art or science. It reduces your
market risk to practice it, so why not?

I'd better get to bed, so good luck, and share some insights.

Paul, This is type of discussion is exactly why I follow this thread. Thank you
for expressing your thoughts. If we can all openly and honest express our views
without making it a personal issues than we all stand to gain from our
_differences_ more than our similarities. You have provoked me into challenging
my own assumptions about why I do what I do. It doesn't mean I've changed

Personally, I like pithy quotes. They help me focus on what is important. I
almost quoted some Sun Tzu (Art of Strategy)in my original post, but then
decided to hold off. You are right that Buffett's investigation of companies is
much more detailed than mine.

I have a very fundamental question that I can't answer right now. How much
investigation is enough? I would like to know how much research is enough.
There is the company, product, management, competition, the sector as a whole,
long term social trends, etc. I always keep digging. I am a detail oriented
person(aka Engineer). I am attempting to put together a disciplined research
strategy for companies I investigate. I have a general process, but I need to
define and improve it. This is an area that we could learn a lot from each
other. As you know, there is no one right answer. I feel we are all following
this thread to learn from each other. And if we can hold an open and honest
dialog we can learn a great deal.

Thanks to all for posting your views!

Information theorists say we make decisions at about the 70% level of
information received. The following 30% is only used to confirm the decision we
have already made.

I do not know about this; I keep studying the company and industry until I no
longer own the stock. Usually, I learn more AFTER I have bought the stock, over
the folowing months, than I did in making the purchase decision. Information

Paul,

Although I've read quite a few investment books over the years, I learned to
invest successfully from a broker. Seriously! Once upon a time, almost 10 years
ago I had a broker who gave me much better service than my tiny portfolio
warranted. He introduced me to a more systematic approach of looking at company
fundamentals and market potential. This guy even came to my office to meet with
me one day! Well, a few months later he was re-assigned to give personal
attention to the bank's largest personal accounts.

That experience led me to seek out fundamentally sound investment approaches. I
have taken a little from several people, some of whom you mentioned in your
post. I read Graham and Dodds, Lynch, etc. I've just read Fisher's book. In the
end, you have to do what makes sense to you. Although it has been said that
Peter Lynch never met a stock he didn't like, my memory says that he recommends
only a few stocks (3-5 comes to mind) for the small investor. And he also says
that it takes just one ten-bagger to make an investment career. I believe he
also says that people should be totally invested in equities, even when they
retire, but that's another myth to dispel.

Anyway, what I am saying is that a few good examples (my broker friend) and
some good ideas (all those books and this thread) should eventually allow a
person to develop an investment style that he is comfortable with and that is
successful. I love to analyze things but this is way more effort than most
people put into investing.

Those who make the effort using a sound system will be successful over time.
Value is everything. If you think like you're buying the company and not the
stock (Lynch?) then your on the right track imo.

Great input, now I'd better get back to work or I'll be investing full time
<g>.

Hi guys,

Here's my investment style.

My basic investment criteria is close to Fisher's
SuperStocks idea. I love low PSR (below 2 - 1.5 - 1 depending
on company), low debt (below 0.25 debt/equity), high margins
(above 5% net), positive cash flows. The company has to
have a franchise value and a leadership position. The company
has to be in non-commodity industry with growth potential and
good management. If I don't have info on the management,
I look for high ROE and ROA during their tenure. I look for
a story that appeals to me.

However, these criteria mean that
I have to buy mostly "fallen angels". I made a killing on
semi-equips last year and this year. Currently, I hold QKTN and
IKOS - two EDA companies that suffered glitches this year.
The only non-fallen-angel company I had was HRSH - and
it's still attractive at current prices.

I sell when I think that the company has become
overvalued (> 3 PSR) or I think that the story has
changed. I am not buy-and-holder mostly because my buys
did not go up slowly. They either shot like rockets
or showed a negative story and were dumped.

Occasionally I buy companies that violate some of the
criteria if I believe that it's worthwhile. For tech companies
the positive cash flow requirent is usually unapplicable. ;-)
For each violated criterion I pay more attention to the
company's performance. ;-)

The above is my core strategy. In addition, I dabble
in everything else that makes money:

1. Hot IPO's that you can get at IPO price.

2. Arbitrage.

3. Week trading using stocks, options or covered calls.

For these plays, I look for "sure things" with
high gain in short term. E.g. if you can figure out
DYMO conversion to ESIO rules and see 20% gain in a month
or two with almost no risk - go for it. :-)))

I also hold some PEP because my broker believes
it's a stabilizing influence to my portfolio. :-)
I am thinking of adding some Asian stocks or funds for
the same reason.

Good luck

Paul,

Been refraining from making responses except to direct questions since my last
post to you. You asked me for a 'war story' and I impulsively sallied forth
with bravado regaling you with my successes.
I apologise.

I post now because you have promoted long term investing. I would like to know
when YOU would sell a stock? Example: A week or so ago you bought WBB @ +/-
19.375. It is now at $21.5625 and shows indications of continuing up. With no
news, no earnings report, where would you decide to take profits rather than
hold? Would you sell all or a portion at that level? Where would you bail
completely? What criteria would you use?

I find myself too often selling before the top. I try to sell when it reaches a
price where I feel is over value. By doing this, I often end up watching the
stock continue up. If I decide to hold, the stock has a tendency to stagnate at
that level.
Buying good stocks hasn't been my problem. It's knowing when to sell.

Also, how much weight do you put to historical performance? You seem to prefer
companies with a history of profits and growth.

You tout the performance of others, but you make a great mentor. Kept me from
making some mistakes and helped me to make some money.
Don't get big headed - others are on my list -g-.

Thanks, very well. :-))) If I can't sleep at night,
I dump the stock in the morning. :-))

In the strategic part of portfolio (SuperStocks),
I either believe the company or I believe the low
valuation (PSR) or both.

In the "make money" part, I only buy stocks
that go up. If they don't go up, I don't buy them - as Will
Rogers said. :-)

BTW, my experience shows that sticking with guns
was the winning strategy of last two years. Every stock
I sold (except one) is now higher than the sell price.
It would have been especially bad to sell during
the corrections, e.g. this April.

Bilow: Thanks for the post: made me think. Where you are risk averse, I am not.
Where you do not mind selling and seeing the stock continue to rise, I get
upset - I see an error in me- an error in judgment (valuation of the intrinsic
value) or a personality flaw (impatience). Although of course for value
investors who buy below intrinsic value and sell at full or fair (intrinsic)
value, the stock rise is to be expected... stocks will fluctuate above fair
value. And of course I would rather see the stock go higher without me, than
continue to hold and see the stock decline and return back to my purchase
price! Selling is always the hardest part of an investment operation IMO.

Ron: when to sell: We all sell too early in a bull market don't we?

I've made 30 sell decisions since mid '95. In 22 instances, the stock has
continued to rise. In some of these cases a loss or small gain, coulda shoulda
and didint become a good percentage gain - if I'da stuck with it.
Some stocks I own are value plays -- they should be sold when fair value is
reached, not before. I try to plan that when I find something that's a better
value than something I already own - and I am always finding something better
than something I already own -g- - I have a way to avoid playing switcheroo.
For others who like to dance like this, it may work, but for me- I allow so
that I won't have to be jerked out of something I already have (buyer's
remorse?) and into my latest find.
Growth stocks are tough to actually sell. I'll buy on dips, so when the growth
actually does stop, I get caught in the downdraft. I always figure I can tell
when growth is slowing , but in reality I don't or can't (maybe a function of
portfolio size and/or my lack of attention to heavy analyses). Sometimes I just
think the price is too far out of line. Result is usually an emotional sell for
me. Facing that now with a large position in BMY.
Dividend plays are easier. I use a model based on dividend yield relative to
S&P 500 or, like DIPY, monitor for continuous yearly increases. Problem for me
here is the lack of capital appreciation or price action (sometimes)is boring,
and I lose patience before I reach the well-defined price target. (So I build
into my portfolio and managment structure ways to circumvent/overcome the
boredom. Sometimes this works.)

In general I like now to sell in partial positions (even for value stocks when
they hit "full value") It's something about mostly- 22/30 -being wrong about
selling (or if not wrong... too soon)and the bull market.

Specifically, regarding WBB, it's growing its revs, I think the demand is there
for future sales and book value is steadily increasing (although earnings are
erratic). I bet that at some point in the next two years, the stock will once
again - as it occasionally has done before - sell for 1.5x its BV which will be
about 18.00 or more. I intend to hold the stock until it reaches $27. I am
surprised the stock is rising -- I would expect it to fall or stay where it is.
Analysts have projected difficult sales comparisons/lower earnings for '98. I
think the stock will drop to 18 (from about 21) before it hits 27. Commonsense
might say then... take profits now, buy back in at 18. The thing is... I bet
that it will hit 27, but I don't know that it will go to 18 or that I would buy
back at 18. It's like this... buy a bargain when it's a bargain and sell it
when it becomes fairly valued. For this kind of play it's not buy, sell for 3
points, move on. You see that I miss a ton of good stocks, so when I find
something that I can evaluate or at least believe in, I want to stick with it
for the full term. That's what value investing is about. Not that I necessarily
can follow my own rules...I surely succumb to temptation too - but it's what I
am aiming to do... at least for WBB. And now that I've posted about it, I'll
probably be shamed into being stuck with it for the duration -g-. Paul

Paul,

I totally agree with your statement that knowing when to sell is the biggest
challenge.

I reviewed my sells - I've had 24 in last 6 months - and I guess I'm not doing
as bad as I thought. 6 are selling much higher, 6 much lower, and the rest
+/-1/8 of my sell price. Profits were made on all but 3, one of these being WBB
that I knew would go up, but I had a better buy. Of the stocks that continued
up, the market considered 4 of them far more valuable than I did.

You are right. Prices in a Bull market are unpredictable and one can't
determine what price a stock will bring, just stay with your own set of rules
and stop looking back, particularly if you made a profit.

I'm telling myself to forget the ones that ran on up and to pat myself on the
back for the ones that went down.

Mike & Chris,

Nope, it was luck. Just like some of the other stocks before, JWC was featured
in an article in some business weekly (I have yet to find out which one) that
stated it was a perfect candidate for a take over, high liquidity, low debt,
strong growth (where have I heard this before?) JWC had not traded above 20K
shares in months, suddenly there's 50K on Thursday and 300K today. WOW!! Up
over 50% in two days. Couldn't believe it. Everytime I punched for a quote the
volume and price jumped up (and some of my punches were only a minute or two
apart). I've had good runs before on news articles or brokerage
recommendations, but never anything like this. What a rush!

Sold off 75% of position just before close after I found out why it had run up.
My research tells me that JWC management would resist any take over attempt.
They want to run their own show. This was confirmed by the company after the
close. Feel pretty confident I can get it back later at a lower price.

Barely noticed the AMTD and SWST run-ups until close. SWST just went on the
NYSE. No apparent reason for AMTD.

Thanks for bearing with my exuberance this day. Gotta little hyper. Have/had
(for me) BIG position in JWC and fairly large in SWST.

Regarding short term traders and their eventual demise:

One of the things that amazes me is when I see someone
shorting the same stock that they had recently bought. In other
words, acting as if they were a market maker. I am sure these
guys get burned quickly. Do you suppose that is what Burke
was referring to? (For reference:)
http://www.techstocks.com/~wsapi/investor/s-6780/reply-2759
Typically this will be someone who road the stock up, decides it's
over valued, sells his position and then some. This never happens
to me because I never ride a winner high enough for it to be a loser.
And there is no way a short term trader is going to be able to ride
a stock all the way from a fundamental buy signal to a fundamental
sell signal.

Even though I do short term trade, I (almost) never buy something
without the expectation that I will have to hold it a long time to make
money off it.

re: learning and investment strategy:

For what it's worth (not much -g-), I think you ARE learning and doing the
right thing. Over time I've come to this way of thinking: there's a way (or
ways) of investing that a consensus of experts (successful investors)and
academics believes works for the average person. And there are methods for
which there is evidence that over time, do not work, or work poorly, for most
investors. Telling or advising a person to focus on the former and ignore the
latter -- this is useless - each person can only come to these good methods if
he/she seeks them out for himself/herself. Therefore, the only advice I could
provide someone (if someone were to ask me - which they never do -g-) is to
"try everything". And use real money. Trade up, trade down, use every option
tactic possible, trade pork bellies and currencies, buy microcaps, day trade,
short sell, margin as much as can dare,lose some sleep, etc.
All this will speed up the process of learning and developing one's personal
investing style (if there's any money left -ggg-).

Anyway in your situation, I think you have already come to know exactly what
you are doing and the risks associated for the "fun" you are getting. You seem
to have found a method and $ allocation strategy that works for you. So here's

I like to read Mike's Burke's stuff... the way he writes and what he says- when
I can get past all the garbage posts on his thread. He was a professional fund
manager; I believe he once said at one time he believed himself to be one of
the largest option players in the country -- he talks like he knows his stuff.
Note: Tried options and - safe as they can be - learned I wasn't smart enough
or quick enough to have an edge. Too much lost sleep and lost money for me.
That was more than 20 years ago. Now when I think maybe I should relearn/retry,
I find, for me, there's no reason to go back to them. Paul

E.Newman & Ron Bower: Nice call on JWC.

Here was the catalyst article I think:
http://www.businessweek.com/1997/41/b3548151.htm

Ron and E.: I will just have to relook all your other stock holdings. If
there's anything in common that you both own, I'll want to buy it -g- Paul.

Ron, Thanks for your comments on my portfolio picks in the Value Investing -
Portfolio thread. If possible, it would be nice to keep the the portfolio
thread for posting our picks, and use this thread for our ongoing dialog.

When I look at my three major holdings it do see some risk. Mostly, I see risk
of my money sitting for years and going nowhere (+/-25%). In Paul Senior's post
(#2093) he mentioned:
Therefore, the only advice I could provide someone (if someone were to ask me -
which they never do -g-) is to "try everything". And use real money. 

I feel this is excellent advice. BTW Paul, you should give yourself more
credit. You have added some valuable input!

I recently sold two positions (CDN, PIXR) because I felt they were no longer in
line with my current philosophy. I feel both are quite overvalued. For some
reason, in the last couple of months I have been drawn toward companies with
low PSRs, with a recent short term problem, and good cash flow. CDN has a PSR
above 6, and PIXR above 23. I still feel these are excellent companies, but not
at the current price. To much risk for me...

Recently, someone started a thread called 'Super Stocks' based on Ken Fisher's
book of the same name. I just received the book on Friday, and read yesterday.
I see excellent possibilities in this way of thinking. I have no idea if my
current major selections (CTYS,FIBR,& SFLX) will be any good a year from now.
Of course there is always hope... <smile>

What I do value is the ongoing discussion we have on this thread. You
recommended FLSHF. In quickly looking it over their PSR seems too high. I could
not find their current profit margin either, so my info is limited. I do
appreciate your comments and recommendation.

My current guidelines for picking stocks are roughly the following:
(in no particular order)

*PSR < 1.25 (Prefer < 0.75)
*Inside ownership >= 10%
*Inst. ownership >=10% (Preference, but not required)
*Stock price < 60% of yearly high.
*Company has experienced short term earnings problem (in last 1-3q).
*Sales growth > 25% (Historical)
*Sector growth >20% (Present & Future)
*I Must be able to understand product, its positioning, competition.
*Profit margin >= 5%, prefer >10% (Or likely to acheive in next year)
*Very low to 0% debt.
*No significant litigation. (e.g. CDN vs AVNT)
*Prefer industries: Technology, medical (no biotech), Finance.
*Prefer personal experience with company or product, or have friend who has. (I
live in Silicon Valley, CA.)
*Prefer leaders in their niche. Under dogs OK in highly fragmented markets.
(Acquisitions happen...)
*I have to have a good feeling about the company's story, and approach to the
market.

A company should have most of these traits. I have noticed that this means I'm
looking at micro/small caps most of the time, plus a couple of mid-caps.

I am interested by what criteria others screen stocks. My guidelines are still
evolving, and I would like to learn from what others have tried. CTYS/FIBR/SFLX
are a grand experiment. Like Paul said "...use real money." Someone else said
something about "...a fool and his money...", but I prefer not to think about
that. <VBG>

Thanks to all for your comments,
Good luck, and may the market be with you, <VBG>

Screening software?

Does anyone have any software recommendations for performing
fundamental valuation screens?

Paul,

Thanks for posting the article. I had to find out why the stock was moving so
fast and finally found the article Friday afternoon. As I knew JWC management
would resist any take-over, I decided to sell off part of my position. I am now
having regrets. I have the profit, but I may have been too early again.

This goes back to my earlier questions. At 12.375, JWC reached 9 PE and
2.33xBV. When I bought, I felt it worth 15.00. I couldn't resist taking a 63%
profit on a stock I initially bought on Sept. 18th. If it continues to the 15
or higher, I'll be kicking myself again. Unlike some past stocks, I now keep
some to salve the wound.

I've been very lucky. This is the 7th stock I've bought this year that had a
news article or some brokerage initiated coverage with a strong buy after I
bought it. One can buy using research, but it takes luck to get quick results.
Each time I bought, I planned to hold for long term but got a quick run up. I
have to remind myself constantly that it's the luck, not an ability to find the
stocks. If I don't, I make the mistakes I made with BOTX and a couple of others
- selling them because they weren't moving.

Again, my apologies for Friday's 'irrational exuberance'. I only have one
excuse, the gains I made Thu & Fri equalled the amount of my holdings a year
ago when I started online investing. I think we all have concerns and doubts
when investing a large sum in an unrecognized stocks. It's being right that
causes the elation.

Hi Ron: Please don't apologize on my account. I've been in and with too many
losers (stocks) not to want to hear about the winners (people) and their good
stocks when they have them. As Mike Burry said, seems like it's not taking very
long for the values to be recognized. I remember when it did take years, if
then -g-. (Those days will return IMO.) So I encourage everyone to celebrate
when and while they/we can - it IS tough to make money (in spite of what it
seems in '96 and '97 -- well-- tough for me anyway).
One observation I have is that I'm disappointed at how many people try so very,
very hard to ignore or take emotion out of the investment decision and process.
Recognizing the emotional aspects and trying to build on them - or at least
deal with them - is a key component for me. (And so I don't mean just hiding
the joy or stoically bearing the pain.)
Seems like you are aware this aspect too...For example, I also have learned to
leave a few chips on the table when selling some positions (especially the
quick emotion-backed ones) -- it does reduce sellers remorse. Another example
might be The Finance Professor - Reginald. He took a totally analytical and
methodological approach... his lack of consideration or understanding of any
other aspects of investing brought out strong emotions in many who read his
posts. We recognized something unbalanced w/his approach; we didn't articulate
it, but the responses to his posts dealt with it.

I have to go back and reread Graham - I don't recall this- the heart or soul of
investing - being dealt with. Guess I think of Graham's methods as consumately
analytical, logical, rational -- therefore quiet,unemotional, taciturn. Graham
himself IMO was a wild guy with his divorces and French mistress (1 or more?).
Not an attack on the man; just saying he must have had some good thoughts on
this aspect of investing (the heart/soul/emotion) that should have been
explored IMO. And I bet if he were here now he would say to you (after
inquiring about the methodology you used to select the stock): "Good for you
young man! Keep up the good work!"

Two stocks where the price is rising (quicker'n I can buy them) are: icoc and
ccn

ICOC: oil pipe inspection/repair and plastic grinding operation (2 separate
businesses). Almost $5 in cash (after taking on a big loan though). Have
watched the price go from low 6 to 8+. Trading volume increasing quite a lot.
They're buying out other complementary co's and I expect will show good
quarterly earnings comparisons with the resulting increases in sales. Oil
bidness component looks good (an "in" business ala the popularity of oil
equipment (esp. pipe) mfgers). I post FWIW; I don't own the stock (stock price
rise was too quick -- or I was too slow). Unsure of the risk/reward at current
price. Any owners or opinions on this one?

Revisiting CCN: Yes, Chris Craft. Now that it's 5 points or 10% higher.
Increased purchase authorization for BHC. Plenty of cash in till to help -
maybe - cushion a CCN stock decline. Slow and kinda steady stock price
appreciation. Anybody in this one or got an opinion at current 54+ price?
(Would maybe be for a small position and 3 year hold for 50%?? gain)
