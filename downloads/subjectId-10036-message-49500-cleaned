JCP overhead gap.

sgid=28389797

Didn't understand the run up, since the fundamentals did not support it. That's
why I always check everything I can check. Market is very quick and very smart.
Simple formulas like GN do not work.

FWIW, GLW also has an overhead gap. More than three quarters of their revenue
is derived from LED sales is why.

ADM's chart is also dealing with an overhead gap fill as the Co. tries to deal
with its pension issues not to mention small margins.

Sergio, i think Nikh record is pretty good too, but there were a few duds. I
particularly remember FDML because i think that was the first stock he
introduced to this board.

I admit to being a sucker for 52 week lows and I found it a hard habit to
break. Just bought more CAH today at 37.5$ :-) I learned the hard way that lows
are often followed by more lows. So, I started to look more for potential chart
support levels and I also learned to buy in small increments. I do sell, when I
think my fundamental analysis is wrong (case in point CLF) but won't just
because the chart looks bad.

I have had disagreements with you and other board members but I have no
problems with that. Some of my biggest benefits from this board are those
investments that I have never done, because of input from this board. People
here have different views and methods to looks at investments and we all can

Sergio - Thanks. My method is very simple - it involves looking at hard and
soft catalysts in addition to fundamentals.

I try to understand the business really well, its drivers and understand the
catalysts before "Really" looking at fundamentals. Then i marry fundamentals
with the catalysts and i know how the stock is going to move, timeline, so on
and so forth. I DO NOT read sell side reports or listen to mgt, unless I have
first done my own homework.

So this is super simple answer to your question. Ofcourse, there is tonnes of
analysis that goes into it.

For example - i look at 25 quarters of data and go back atleast 6 years when i
look at numbers for a firm. When i do that, " I personally download ALL MY DATA
from SEC filings and not depend on any website or even Bloomberg". Or when i
look at EPS, i will usually model normalized earnings as opposed to just
looking at EPS. If I am looking at a spin-off, i will look at upside created by
the spin for the holdco, example being Marriott where i modeled a t $8-$10
upside from the spin. When i wrote it, MAR was at 32 and today its touching
$41/$42. Or sometimes i will play spin's as long/short. Look at my RAH/POST
analysis. I put one for my clients on CVC last yr which is not on seeking alpha
( shorting CVC and going long AMCX). You guys don;t see all my ideas. Sometimes
I will look at upcoming contracts and JV's in addition to fundamentals. ACIW
and TYL are such example that i wrote about when they were trading at 30 and 20
respectively OR WXS when I wrote in mid 2010 when it was trading around $31.

I can go on and on, but you get the idea. So it boils to few basic things -
"really understanding the company, marrying my catalysts with good
fundamentals, keeping my margin of safety, investing with a medium/long term
horizon and being patient, making sure that mgt is honest and invested, many
times taking contrarian approaches and personally downloading SEC data and
putting my spreadsheet together".

I emailed you something. check it out.

CCM,

Nice timing! I forgot anyone else cared about this. I have been selling the
past few days. I wish I had waited until today :)

On the positive side, the buyback continues and I believe has cleared out the
large institutional sellers. So from a supply/demand of shares, I think this
stock has room to run.

From a fundamentals viewpoint, I like the business but there are so many cheap
Chinese stocks with buybacks/dividends that this one does not look that cheap.

I have sold a good chunk and keeping a few shares because of the supply/demand
factor.

PS: I no longer will consider a Chinese stock without a buyback or dividend,
except maybe a blue chip like Baidu. It is basically show me the money time.

good for you for complaining about it. I dont know if the bonusses are
excessive or not. As far as i know they dont take 20% of earnings like a lot of
these investment type companies do. this awarding of bonuses and stock options
isnt unique to canadian companies. For me the poster company for screwing
shareholder was icge. which came public at $14 went to at least $240 and then
dropped way below a $1. throughout the share price decline and steady losses
management continued to reward themselves with generous cash bonuses. they
would simply change the ciriteria from year to year so that they could "earn"
bonuses while the stock became valueless. There was another situation i was
invested in a semiconductor equipment supplier that seemed like a great value.
the company sold off their most valuable subsidiary for a pittance, they said
they didnt need shareholder approval for such a transaction. the ceo was
awarded a long term contract and a substantial equity stake in the new
subisidiary formed by the acquirer. and investors got screwed. I think i wrote
a letter to the SEC complaining about that and they responded with some sort of
form letter, which pretty much said go away and leave us alone.

I think a lot of us also remember the seagate take under. which we discussed
here.

aab.TO I stand corrected. I did not review the latest financials until after I

according to the MDA renumeration of key management increase was mostly due to
increase in short term benefits from $447K to $4,313K from the corresponding 6
months period ending 7/31. Considering that the market cap of the company is
only around $38 million this is a material expense which should have been
explained in detail. I am not surprised the OSC has responded in the same way
the SEC has . these entities are useless in protecting shareholders other than
eventually getting some meaning less judgement agianst fraudsters have the

Feel free to contact, but I already asked them. The bonuses are "one time"
bonuses for the Simmers settlement and for the royalty sale. I am guessing they
were going to pay themselves handsomely for the Dacha transaction as well.

Of course, these tranactions all lowered NAV at the time (royalty sale may end
up being a winner), so they paid bonuses for destroying NAV. How convenient.

Re: Perma-Fix Environmental Services Inc. (PESI)
 http://goo.gl/DAv74

I was surprised that their margins are so low. Environmental waste disposal
companies typically have high operating margins. When I checked the competitors
(the ones YAHOO lists) except ECOL operating margins were quite low.

I am not sure if it is the nature of their Government contracts for nuclear
waste disposal but for me to operate with this material, such low margins is
not worth the risk.

ECOL is one I have on my watch list and they are selling near their 52wk high.
The only positive I see for PESI is their low debt profile. ECOL has done well
and have kept their long term debt at 2x annual net income (similar to PESI).

PESI does not have the exposure to the other commercial hazardous waste streams
like ECOL. It helps to not be hand cuffed to one supplier which may be the
reason for their low margins.

In a slow growth environment, this sector is one I would want to own. Mainly
because these companies can generate a large amount of free cash flow. I would
still want to pay no more than a 15 PE for a well run company and a 10 PE would
be a "value" buy.

So for me, PESI would not make my list. ECOL has a good history but is still
expansive at $20.69/share.

I might pay up to $17.50/share for ECOL but would love to own it around
$12.00/share. ECOL is a perfect size as they can still grow their businesses as
their market cap is relatively low at $377M.

Clean Harbors, Inc. (CLH) is another one you might want to look at but it's
still about 30% too high. They have a similar low debt profile, are quite
profitable and appears to dominate this sector (gross margins > 30%).

Waste Management, Inc. (WM) is another much larger Cap company is getting back
to my buy target too ( @ $30.00/share or lower). It is not really a pure play
in the environmental hazardous waste sector but could be a good long term buy
is bought under $30.00/share ( around 13 Forward PE).

gets some; some it loses. The benefit to me for this lack of growth is that
beta is low. (So far.) I'll take the 4% dividend and not much fluctuation in
share price. When or if, USA economy gets better, the solid waste sector
business should improve. Meanwhile, although competition is rough and
municipalities are tough to deal with -- I assume there's not going to be new
entrants into the business, given the limited landfill permits.

I'm willing to still hold utilities with a similar dividend yield and similar

Richmont Mines Inc. (RIC) - Sold high priced shares booked small gain
http://goo.gl/ST5Gs
http://goo.gl/ST5Gs
 http://goo.gl/ST5Gs - looking to start a position below $35.00/share

Sold my high cost shares of the Jr. gold miner RIC and booked a small gain. I
continue to hold my other shares bought near the recent lows. RIC recently
announced news that recent ore samples may not contain as much gold as first
thought but the company is still profitable. They paid down a $10 million
debenture to strengthen their balance sheet. On their Island Gold mine they did
report favorable results, so it seems hit or miss as they continue to develop
their mines.

http://goo.gl/Jkg0z

It's hard to figure the "exact" value proposition as it eventually comes down
to the gold retrieved from their developed mines. They continue to run a
profitable operation and have very little long term debt. Management seems to
be doing a good job. I will hold on to my small amount of shares and add to
that on prices below $5.00/share. My upside target is around
$9.00/share-$12.00/share but depends on the long term price of gold and what
additional discoveries they find as they develop their mines (ie new pockets of
gold similar to their island mine results).

Both AUNFF and CPPMF are up substantialy from my last buys on 8/22/2012. This
could be due to the QE3 announcement but each of these companies do have
company specific news and/or positive operations. These two miners are close to
bringing their new mines into production. It's a challenge to keep to their
schedule and stay on budget. AUNFF has updated their mineral ore results and
has stated that current "production" results show more silver than first
estimated. CPPMF is ahead of schedule in bringing their copper mine online and
fortunately have not been set back w/ any substantial delays. There were some
early issues with water rights and processing but have been resolved w/ the
local community and Federal/State agencies.

These jr. miners are similar to the small E&P companies and one should try to
buy a basket of these companies and/or diversify holdings into some of the
major miners too. In my case I already hold several of the majors (BHP, VALE,
AU, AAUKY). Am looking to add Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX)
on any price below $35.00/share which will provide a bit more copper exposre to

I enhance my play of the low interest rate trend:

Presuming low interest rates continue through at least 2013, it is hard for me
to see how the stocks of life insurers will do well (i.e. how they will recover
in next year or so). Similarly, hard for me to see how the mortgage reits will
really falter. With that, I'll do what I usually don't: I continue to sell down
undervalued life insurance stocks, and --- late-to-the-party --- I'll put money
into overvalued (imo) mortgage reits. Today: cutting back on small position of
insurer PL, moving money from cash account and opening an initial position in
REM. I chose REM rather than any individual mreit, because for its small
expense (fee), REM diversifies business risk with holding any one mreit. Plus,
with something like REM I can easily get in or out of the sector if I wish.

We looked at RSG a while back.

RSG's numbers look better to me than WM's. Their forecast earnings growth is
also better. The div. is not too shabby and is also substainable. The risk is
just the same as WM's, it's also a low beta stock....but factoring in the

Re CNX - no I have not bought. I had a loosing position in BTU and decided to
close it at a loss. CNX may trade at a discount to it's asset value but with
1.5$ in earnings and almost 2x book , it does not look cheap based on some
traditional valuation metrics. I guess Chanos has a point, calling it a value
trap.

FWIW, I sold btU but I do like it better. BTU has Met coal assets in Australia,
that are better suited to meet demand in Asia. Also, their thermal coal assets
in the Powder River have some of the lowest costs in the world, so even though
they are landlocked to some extend, they are very hard to displace, even with
NG as cheap as it is right now.

I think if you have a really LT view, you might be OK with CNX, but I expect
the ride to be pretty rough for a couple of years. I think there are bet's with
a better risk/reward ratio out there.

RSG looks better to me too; lower EV/EBITDA, debt remained the same for the

than WM and trades at a discount with respect to some metrics. I think RSG

Dividends are automatically set up to be invested into the common w/ the 5%
discount offered through the company.

My last buy was 10/2010 w/ 17.238 shares from their dividend reinvestment
program. So for the 24 months the dividends returned 5.5% annually and the
capital gain represented a 29% gain. So annualized that's just over 20% per

According to Fido (which may be wrong :)), there are 3 trades in August: 200,
451 and 751 shares, somebody (you? ;)) bidding up the price from $25 in June to
$32 in August... Then there's a trade at $25.XX in June for 470 shares. And
that's it for the year. The trade before that is in Nov 2011. Talk about
illiquid.

I assume someone who buys at $32 now, would have to sell at $26 if they wanted
to exit. Or would have to wait for another value investor who tries to buy
shares. :)

Might work well if you plan to hold forever and did a thorough dd. :) I think

Not sure how to value these pharmaceutical companies. I noticed that Pfizer

I also added a lot more shares below $16.00/share in 6/2010 too. At one point
during the pharma growth phase (during the 90's), the market priced a lot of
these pharmaceuticals w/ a 25 PE to 30 PE. The forward PE's for these stocks
are still quite cheap now selling w/ PE's in the low teens. ABT at PE 13.77 and
PFE at 11.09.

I continue to hold all my pharma stocks as they pay good dividends. I am not

their debt profile looks very good (I suspect their revenue may be a one time
event as I have not researched anything yet).

The preferred offering caught my attention and then http://goo.gl/5AAp3

There was some discussion that Alaska (the state) is friendly to E&P companies
and is working on their own NG pipeline program from the North Slope to the
inlet w/ the plans to build a LNG port terminal so they can export LNG to Asia.

<blockquote>Alaska wants a $50 billion pipeline and export complex built to
develop natural gas that’s stranded on its icy North Slope. The justification:
Asia ’s swelling appetite for the fuel. Energy explorers and Alaska’s
government are trying for the first time to market a resource that may generate
as much as $20 billion in annual gas sales. Asian gas buyers as of July paid
almost six times the futures price in the U.S., where it has been driven low by
the shale boom. </blockquote> Any ideas of potential plays for the Alaska NG

Since my position and interest in PESI generated some discussion, I thought I
would both add and respond to some comments.

Yes, this is a real company.

Yes, the margins are slim. But I like to use the perspective from Nasdaq and
where we look at the income statement over time. As you can see from the link,
the income statement is lumpy but there is a year over year progression of it
getting better.

<u>http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/pesi/financials?query=income-statement</u>

Here is another way to compare the sector.

http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/pesi/financials?query=ratios

As an overview I will refer to a Crystal Equity Research piece on the company.

<u>http://seekingalpha.com/article/719641-perma-fix-innovator-in-hazardous-mate
ials</u>

The take-aways for me is that you have a rather mundane and reasonably priced
company that holds significant licenses, and patents. If their novel approach
for TC-99 works out, you will have a dramatic expansion of the multiples as one
will look at this as also a medical company.

Below is another link to an article addressing the issue of a safer way to
obtaining this isotope.

<u>http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/what-doctor-ordered-eliminating-weapons
grade-uranium-medical-isotope-production/</u>

As an aside, one of the reasons Iran claims they need enriched uranium is so
that they can isolate medical isotopes.

One of the impediments for the industry is that there have been problems at the
Handford site with the DOE that has slowed processeing down. The CEO refers to
this issue is the last CC, and the WSJ recently had an article about it.

<u>http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443819404577635700925553724.ht
l?KEYWORDS=Hanford+site</u>

If their new technology for the creation of TC-99 doesn’t work out, you still
have a reasonably priced stock. In that scenario, PESI could be more valuable
as a takeover target than as a company.

Regardless, this a a dollar stock so obviously the market is assessing a high
degree of risk and/or disinterest. However, I believe that there are certain
catalysts--specifically the work to eliminate highly enriched uranium in
medical isotope production--that makes this a speculative situation that is
worth my investment.

Alaska e&p/MILL. I've maintained my few MILL shares from 2010-2011. There was
-- maybe still is -- a big concern by investors when lavish lifestyle and
background of head guy was revealed. Although the stock seems to have overcome
that, the negative reports about him weakened my interest in building up or
keeping anything but a speculative and very small position.

<blockquote> Any ideas of potential plays for the Alaska NG theme other than a

to be a typical small Australian e&p company in the sense that it trades for
mere pennies, yet there are over 800 million shares out. Info on Buccaneer can

Question is...who does! I'm extremely nervous when it comes to trying to value
a bank, especially if they're neck deep in exotic trades that even their senior
management are not aware of!

However, in saying that, I do like JPM though, purely because Jamie Dimon is
there. It was a great buying opportunity when losses from the London Whale were
revealed

Have you looked at banks from other countries at all? Barclays was a great
buying opp when the libor scandal broke out. My personal favourite is Standard
Chartered. Again, this is not based on any in-depth analysis, but I like their
model and most of their business is in emerging markets. You can definitely see
their influence there by the number of branches they have (eg Malaysia and
Singapore - though one would argue that these two markets are hardly epitomes
of the modern financial system! Maybe Singapore...). I believe C also has a
sizeable chunk of its business in emerging markets so great prospects there if
you are a believer in the emerging economies producing a large number of middle
income earners in the next few years

For US banks, the impression I get is that State Street and Northern Trust are
the 'safer' banks, as they are the 'traditional' custodian type banks. Their
fund administration business is great as well (based on what I've seen from my
external auditing days).

I also like the look of Canadian banks such as TD and BMO. Purely from a divi
growth perspective Canadian banks would have been great investments in the past
couple of years, though I'm not so sure now if they're not overvalued due to
the perception that they are 'safer' compared to American banks?

I'm not an expert investor in banks. IMO, they are very tough to value.
P/tangible-book might be the only measure that somewhat works, since earnings
and cash flows for financials can be manufactured almost at will. Obviously
even tangible book can be misrepresented too, so I did not say it was easy or
reliable. :)

It might be possible to look at tangible book value growth as a metric. I've
done this a bit with insurance companies, but not with banks. BMO, STT, NTRS,
JPM show similar book-value-per-share annual growth ~9-12%. TD book value per
share grew at 17% annually. C and BAC managed to destroy the book value so far.
For comparison, Buffett's WFC grew it at 13% annually. (Note that I just quick
calculated these, so they are book value per share growth, not tangible book
value per share growth numbers)

With all this in mind, I'm still interested in JPM. I may buy more BAC and may
be interested in C just because they seem cheap still. I looked briefly at TD
and it looks too expensive for me. I have not done much analysis on BMO or
Standard Chartered or STT or NTRS. STT and NTRS look expensive based on
P/tangB, but this might be due to their fund administration business that deals
with off balance sheet assets.

Re LUK - maybe they have not lost their touch after all. they purchased 80% in

forward losses, i would think that they can convert that into cash, without
paying taxes. Looks like brilliant move to me. Even if there is going to be
trouble in the beef market, due to corn prices, I think the margin of safety is
high enough, that this purchase works out well, especially with the tax angle.

JEF does not seem to be imploding either, like some shorts believed. LUK is
completely out of the Iron ore bet via Fortuesce, as they sold their stock and
got closure on their royalty note on what appears to be good terms.

The rest (Inmat=copper play) and the biotech does not excite met. Berkadia has

"</blockquote>I'm sure 19 in technical and support activities are not all R&D
engineers. So maybe they have ten real engineers. Is this enough for a future
growth in high tech?

This company is not a startup. It's been around since 1959. I'm sure they can
sell their old/current products to military for now. But "for now" is a key
word. Unless they innovate, they may have fewer and fewer sales. OTOH, there is
also attrition from other manufacturers of old chips and they offer their
capability to supply chips that are no longer available elsewhere, but this is
not a huge long term growth area.

Their CEO, who is also COB, President, CFO, etc. has been around since 1992. If
he did not manage to make this a growth company in 20 years, he's unlikely to
succeed now.

So overall, I don't see a future for this company.

However, we are talking about NCAV buy. So far they are earning money and not
losing it. So NCAV could provide the margin of safety. I don't see a catalyst
for the NCAV-to-market-cap gap to shrink, but everything is possible. They
could get a good contract, Raytheon or IRF could buy them out, etc. I think
I'll skip it though.

>>Bulls Expect a Rally From GrafTech

By: David Russell / Writer, OptionMonster
Published: Tuesday, 25 Sep 2012

GrafTech International doesn’t usually trade a lot of options, but yesterday it
drew unusually heavy bullish activity.

A trader snapped up a block of 3,000 November 10 calls for $0.35 and $0.40,
according to OptionMonster’s real-time tracking systems. There was no previous
open interest in the strike, clearly indicating that this is a new position.
About 300 more contracts were purchased in subsequent transactions.

Those calls lock in the purchase price of shares in the company, whose graphite
products are used in an array of industrial applications. The options can
generate some nice leverage in the event of a rally, allowing the trader to
profit for much less cost than buying the stock directly. But if its shares
don’t climb, those calls will expire worthless.

GrafTech shares [GTI 9.16 0.06 (+0.66%) ] fell 0.32 percent to $9.29 yesterday
and has been drifting lower since early 2011, when the stock double-topped
around $23. It’s been attempting to rebound since the summer, especially after
earnings and revenue beat expectations in July.

While the date of the next quarterly report hasn’t been announced, last year’s
calendar indicates that results will probably be released in late October.
Yesterday’s call buyer probably expects the stock to climb into that news on
hopes of another strong report.

GrafTech trades an average of only 71 total options per session, but
yesterday’s activity was 59 times that amount. Calls accounted for 99 percent
of the volume.

This is a really tough sector, and I have the scars to prove it.

TWI getting hit by double whammy as two of their big markets are
having problems - mining with the slowdown in China and elsewhere,
and agriculture, with the severe drought in much of the U.S.

Not sure how much cheaper it can get though with a forward PE of 6.2.

>>BCC: "small E&P listed in Australia and doing business in Alaska=red flag,
imo."<<

My point is that there is no reason, why a small E&P company that is active
only in the US, would not be listed in the US as well? Why should they list in
Australia, if they have no business there? The US has functioning capital
markets, as far as can tell. Unless they want to be far away from the mob, if
this thing blows up...

I believe the expense of listing or compliance is a concern for these Aussie
companies.

I'm aware of several small e&p companies that were set up in Australia and
followed a path of acquiring land in the USA, developing it or parts of it, and
then, as stock appreciated and/or to broaden the shareholder base, getting a
listing on a USA exchange. I've had no issues (capital structure/fraud) with
Canadian companies (with only the .to or .v listing) buying and developing only
or primarily land in the USA, so for me I don't see the problem with the
Australians doing the same thing.

CWST-If you like trash stocks, have a look at CWST. big capital rise coming
(10M shares) which they need to do to refinance their substantial debt at lower
rates. CWST has substantial cost cutting and asset sales coming. It's a
turnaround play but does trade a discount to peers. Got some today at 4.23$.

Clown, all of this negative news about other economies should start to push the
US dollar up. I've been on the gold side and will now switch to dollar based
investments. Looks like any recovery in the world will need to start here....
more and more, everywhere I look.

I looked over CBT and decided to pass for now. Under $36, I would look again.

TGI, is now on Credit Suisse's Focus List. It's not only the numbers that are
attractive, but the Co's flexibility to fit the demands of the aerospace
industry. Only negative I found is that almost half their sales are to one
customer. Looks great on improving margins.

I have been adding to BH.PA recently at around 46.5 Euro. As mentioned before,
they are a big cheese producer owning many of the most popular brands in
Europe. They basically own the market together with FBEL.PA. Bongrains margins
are slim but have been rising from 2010 depressed levels ( 3.2% ) to 4% this
year. The company trades below tangible book, as I see it and is run by a the
family, so I would not expect sudden changes.

i do think that this stock is too cheap, even considering the low profit
margins. Over time, I think they should get em up, since there pretty much run
a duopoly with FBEL.

Off topic...sorry about illustration. This is a classic gap. Price ran up and
found resistance where the overhead gap was. I think it helps value investors
to know where market resistance is and this is a good example.

Volume is also well exemplified on this chart....looks like there's some buying
but ultimatly lower gap will also be filled.

If you are looking at JCP as a value play, a better opportunity is likely to
come later rather on.
