And here's the opposite of "cigar butt" - hmm, should we call it "cigar front"?
;) CREE. The macro outlook is potentially very bright (pun intended) with more
and more businesses and consumers using LEDs. On the other hand, the management
has consistently performed very poorly: ROE sucks, margins suck, growth is not
really there, acquisitions are unclear. Could be a huge stock on macro outlook,
but I will still skip it...

OK, I don't know what's the "green" line of APOG, but hasn't almost everyone
been using and pushing "energy efficient" windows for how many years? I'll
agree that USA in general is mostly behind Europe in energy efficiency of
houses (and offices probably), but I am not so certain there will be a huge
windfall for APOG. I also read APOG soundbytes from Fool and their rosy view of
commercial construction market is hard to justify in current environment. I do
own couple of commercial REITs and for some reason they don't seem to be
expecting or reflecting great year for commercial real estate.

Finally, IMO APOG financials are just mediocre. So, it's still a skip for me.

AW came out with earnings yesterday and the stock has responded well this
morning. The company continues to increase their free cash flow and pay down
debt. Despite the slowdown and housing and the increase in fuel, Allied Waste
has been able to increase margins. All waste companies are reinventing
themselves by tapping their landfills for gas and increasing their recycling
operations. Below is an excerpt from the CC.

Beyond the basics, our growing number of larger businesses have an expanding
idea of what waste disposal means. These customers want help managing their
entire waste stream and are looking for innovative ideas to help them achieve
their goals around sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices.

There is a real opportunity for Allied Waste to differentiate its service
offering by extending its capabilities to match the evolving needs of our
customers. Where it makes sense, customers are looking for opportunities to
increase the amount of waste that can be a most cost efficiently recycled,
reduced and diverted. Over the near term, this is shaping up to mean expanding
our position in both traditional as well as C&D recycling.

"Today we have 53 recycling operations around the country, but we are
developing plans to gradually increase our capacity in select markets. In
Chicago, we will shortly complete construction of a new state-of-the-art C&D
processing center that will offer a number of operating benefits along with
what we expect will be great returns on invested capital.

Becoming a complete waste stream manager and responding to customer needs on
sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices also means expanding
our activities around landfill gas to energy. More and more municipalities and
industrial customers are looking at landfills as an environmentally friendly
source of renewable energy."

BGS: I have been a holder of BGF for a few years and have posted on BGF several
times. BGF is something that trades as an "Enhanced Income Security" which is a
coupling of two components - the BGS stock part and a bond part. I bought BGF
based on the company's apparently good management (ability to take over other
food company "reject" brands and enhance them), the diverse product lines, and

BGF/BGS. Looking at it again now, it doesn't seem like there's much difference.
As you say, the dividend yield is about the same. (BGF a little higher now; and
with different tax rates for bonds vs. stocks, that difference could diminish.)

Half of BGF is the bond component, so maybe that bond half is safer than the
common. OTOH, whatever risk is in BGS common is in the BGS half of BGF too.

I may have started with BGF because when I first bought, I believed the yield
was so much more than BGS. (I don't even remember if BGS traded then without
the bond though.) I've just stuck with BGF, and as the price has come down, I
added more BGF.

I've no favorite, one over the other. Might be that since BGS has come down so
much more relative to BGF, that BGS might be the better value now.

Madharry, I wouldn't purchase any shares of such a fund as you mentioned
without knowing more about it. Such as:

What focused sector it is in, and how much confidence I have in that particular
sector and how weighted I already am in such stocks.

What the history of the discount to nav is. 25% percent seems like a lot.
Apparently the fund always trades at a discount to its nav. I presume that is
why management has decided or is pressured to buy back shares (to close the
gap).

What the fund pays in terms of dividend and yield. What the yield is -- how
high or low it is. What the dividend is composed of -- pass through of
dividends from the underlying stocks and/or some component of 'return of
capital'? How the dividend might be enhanced, i.e. does the fund use leverage
to enhance yield. (I've got burned on more than one of these types-- dividend
yield on fund much higher than any individual stock in the fund -- subsequently
the fund announces it's apparently somewhat trapped in the "auction rate
preferred securities market" -- monies borrowed to leverage the fund).

I am bullish on Brazil Ag companies but have not been able to identify any pure

Hi Jurgis - I am not sure if Buffet still has his $real/$US holdings, but
according to this article it implies he still has the position on.
http://www.zimbio.com/CEO+Warren+Buffett/articles/72/Brazilian+Real+Profitable+
nvestment+Berkshire
From the article: "...In the time period spanning 2002-2007, the U.S dollar has
lost half of its value against the real. Berkshire Hathaway raked in $100
million during 2007 with its holding of the real since the value of it rose 26%
during the past 12 months. With the real already up 6.7% this year, the future
continues to look promising in regards to Buffett’s holding....".

=============================================

I guess a $100 million profit could be considered in material for the size of
his portfolio.

It's not clear if Buffet has any positions in companies located in Brazil as
certain foreign & private company holdings do not always show up in his SEC
filings (ie TescoPLC in UK). Perhaps his stock holder's letter for 2008 that
will be released next week might shed a bit more light on his foreign
investment holdings.

It will be interesting to see what comes out of this meeting. I think CNBC will

I heard Buffet mention that some substantial fraction of his shareholders buy
Berkshire stock and hold it 'forever/till they die'. He says that some are now
very wealthy (from investing in Berkshire stock).

Since Berkshire doesn't pay dividends, why would this be considered an
'investment'? Is term life insurance an 'investment'? Berkshire stock is a
really great term life insurance policy --- perhaps Warren should integrate a
declining pay out term policy w. Berkshire stock purchases.

You can bet that Buffet would not invest in a company that he intended to keep
'forever' that couldn't turn a profit.

You can't keep Berkshire stock forever and make any money, but you can brag
about it, and you can go buy things at the annual shareholder's meeting.

Hi anializer - Of the companies you listed Bunge (NYSE:BG) looks the most
interesting to me. They have business operations in both Brazil and Argentina.
They supply 23% of the fertilizer to the local farmers which is locally mined
from company owned facilities. They provide 100% credit based financing on
forward production contracts so they have a lot more at risk if their is crop
failure. Here is an interesting overview of the company
http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Bunge_(BG) . The company is not a screaming buy
with a forward PE of 11 which is about average for the industry. BG is up over
35% from the beginning of the year. However, if the long term global commodity
boom continues, BG would provide a reasonable way to participate in this
growth.

The thing that caught my attention are their expansion plans they have for
their Argentina operations. They have plans to expand their port facility and
either own or operate (in partnership) much of the rail distribution
infrastructure to deliver their fertilizer and export their contracted crop
production.

The disruptive change that this region is experiencing is the movement of
commodities (fertilizer input and crop production output). The current
infrastructure can not support the new demand and this may be the growth and
value opportunity.

All America Latina Logistica SA may be worth exploring. It's traded on the
BOVESPA (S&#227;o Paulo Stock Exchange) and there are no ADR's available.
http://www.all-logistica.com/ir/
ALL owns and operates a large asset base, including a rail network that extends
21,300 kilometers of rail tracks, 1,050 locomotives, 30,000 railcars, 1,000
highway vehicles (trucks and trailers owned directly by ALL or by associate
truckers), distribution centers and warehousing facilities. In addition, real
estate leased to the Company pursuant to its concessions includes properties
that are available for construction and development of warehouses and logistics
terminals in Brazil and Argentina. The most important of these properties
comprise the more than one million square meters in industrial areas of Buenos
Aires. The Company&#180;s leased property provides significant opportunities to
further expand its asset base in ways that allow it to enhance its logistics
and other service offerings.

ALL is one of the major share holders of Santa Fe Vagoes. They are well
positioned to participate in the infrastructure growth for the region.

On The Right Track
http://www.usitoday.com/article_printview.asp?Articleid=2109
Santa F&#233; Vag&#245;es hasn't even completed two years of existence but it
already has a prominent role in Brazil's blossoming economy: it produces a lot
of the new railcars that are carrying everything, from iron-ore and soybeans to
cement and steel rods, around the country and into ports to be exported.

================================================================
Am&#233;rica Latina Log&#237;stica may provide a good growth & value
opportunity long term. The investment would be through these units
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ALLL1.SA I am still researching the company but
they do appear to carry a high debt to equity ratio when compared to the US
rails. This is because the company is spending large dollars to upgrade and
expand their operations throughout Brazil and Argentina. The company owns a lot
of long term real estate leases which are not reflected in the current market
value.

A Weekly Analysis of Energy Stocks Using the McDep Ratio
April 22, 2008
Sold Out
Summary and Recommendation
http://www.mcdep.com/mr80422.pdf
From the article:"...As natural gas seems to be reaching its current supply
limits globally, the outlook appears encouraging for further gains in stock
price for buy-recommended natural gas producers including the world’s largest,
Gazprom (OGZPY). China apparently outbid Europe and the U.S. for the last
uncommitted volumes from Qatar, the world’s leading producer of liquefied
natural gas (LNG). Qatari Energy Minister Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah says
“We are not in the charity business. Whoever will give me the best price, I
will follow him.” Quoted by Bloomberg, the minister adds with finality, “We are
sold out.” Because it can be transported anywhere, LNG is the chain that links
global markets for natural gas to an oil-equivalent price. Anecdotally, the
price of incremental natural gas supply in Asia may be approaching $20 a
million btu. Near-month futures quotes are about $12.40 at the National
Balancing Point in the U.K. and about $10.60 at the Louisiana Henry Hub in the
U.S. Since futures have been publicly quoted for six years ahead, natural gas
is at an all-time low relative to oil (see chart Oil/Natural Gas Futures
Ratio). The stage is set for a quick doubling of long-term natural gas price
that would have positive profit implications for producers anywhere in the
world...."

Based on the McDep Ratio valuation, COP is a slightly better value at .74 vs
.78.. However OGZPY has 5x's the NG reserves than COP.

This leaves us with CCPs, construction business and coal cleaning. CCPs are
pretty much flat, construction is deeply suffering. Management put big hopes
into coal cleaning, even predicting sales to 2010. IMHO, these are still big
"IF" and it's unclear what margins and profits they will eventually yield.
IMHO, it also depends a lot of the political and economic climate with regards
to coal, which I would not want to speculate about.

Margins were in deep doodoo, balance sheet has negative tangible assets, so the
fact that it trades below book is pretty worthless.

After all said and done, I would admit that it was probably a mistake for me. I

Capital, $87 million of depreciation at our asset management company, American
Capital, LLC, and $132 million of depreciation in the CLO and CMBS portfolios.
The depreciation was significantly driven by a change in pricing and trading
multiples rather than the performance of the assets. Unlike many of the
financial institutions that also experienced depreciation during the credit
crisis, we intend to hold and not trade out of our CLO and CMBS investments,
because we enjoy excellent current returns and do not expect to incur realized
losses on our investments if we hold them to maturity."

Hi Grommit - You might also want to look at Corning Inc. (GLW) for a low risk
high return play on the Solar Industry. An undiscovered asset in GLW is Hemlock
Semiconductor. GLW owns a 33% stake in Hemlock Semiconductor Corp., a maker of
microchips used in solar-cell technology.

http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/silicon-still-a-hot-topic-at-photon-765.
tml

From the article"...Lazard Capital Markets analyst Sanjay Shrestha wrote that a
number of silicon manufacturers are expanding production. As it previously
announced last year, Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. is growing its production to
reach 36,000 metric tons by 2011, with some of the expansion coming online in
2010. Meanwhile, Wacher-Chemie expects to reach 21,000 metric tons in 2010 and
REC Solar said it expects to grow production to about 7,000 tons this year,
from about 5,850 metric tons last year. Shrestha went on to say the cost of
silicon production for new entrants will likely result in a "floor for silicon
prices," provided that solar industry electricity prices are competitive with
conventional electricity....".

With GLW you get a small dividend, a company that is earning money with a
forward PE of 13 and growth opportunities in several emerging sectors including
new clean diesel filters, bio tech diagnostic devises and interests in a solar
silicon manufacturer. GLW is not a screaming buy at these levels, but I was
lucky enough to pick up shares in 2002 in the single digits.

GLW may provide an alternative low risk "value" play for participating in the
solar panel business and other emerging technologies.

Hi Spekulatius - Some interesting news today for Senior Housing Properties
Trust (SNH).

HRPT Properties (HRP) agrees to sell 48 buildings to Senior Housing Properties
for $565M

http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080506/hrpt_properties_property_sale.html?.v=1

==================================

The value proposition take away is that this sale was property that HRP had
owned and managed for the past nine years. A hidden jewel with a huge capital
gain. HRP continues to sell below stated book value and now with this sale,
they will begin to recognize these hidden gains.

From the article:"...
As of December 31, 2007, HRP’s historical investment in these properties was
approximately $397 million, and its depreciated book carrying value of these
properties was approximately $350 million; accordingly, HRP expects to realize
capital gains of approximately $215 million as a result of these sales. HRP has
owned these 48 buildings for an average of nine years.

HRP’s aggregate capitalization rate for these sales based on $40.0 million per
year of current net operating income from the buildings is approximately
7.1%...."

=============================================================
I continue to look for REITs that sell below their stated book value with prime
assets that have good long term leases that generate income. You can get a
pretty good dividend while you wait.

My recent REIT buys include:

Thanks. Appreciate the opinion and info.

For right now, after reading America Latina posts here and while considering
it, and determining I'd like some Brazilian transportation plays, I have
decided that I'll up my http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RIO position a little.
(Too bad I've not added since my latest add in 2006.) Transportation/logistics
is only a small part of RIO, so it's not such a great bet on the growth of the
Brazilian transportation infrastructure, and not really enough of a sole reason
to commit funds to RIO. Still for me, I'll take a chance on Vale's (RIO's)
continuing to have good growth.

----------------------
"Logistics...
From 2000 to 2006 Vale invested more than $1.3 billion on the acquisition of
over 361 locomotives and around 14,090 freight cars, those locomotives were
primarily for iron ore transportation, but some were for regular cargo.
[56][57][58][59][60][61] Some of the locomotives purchased were secondhand for
refurbishment but at least 55 of the locomotives acquired were new ones of the
model EMD SD70M, each one costing about $2 million.[62][63]

After those investments, Vale became the owner of over 800 locomotives and more
than 35,000 freight cars [64] but the company informed that it will reduce its
investment in rolling stock in the coming years.[65]

Vale owns the concession of three Brazilian railways: Vit&#243;ria a Minas
railroad (EFVM), Ferrovia Centro Atl&#226;ntica (FCA) and Caraj&#225;s railroad
(EFC).
Ferrovia Centro-Atl&#226;ntica and Vit&#243;ria a Minas railroads
Ferrovia Centro-Atl&#226;ntica and Vit&#243;ria a Minas railroads

* Vit&#243;ria a Minas railroad - Vale operates under a 30 year contract this
905 km railroad, which is used to transport iron from the Iron Quadrangle in
Minas Gerais to the Port of Tubar&#227;o in the state of Esp&#237;rito Santo .
The concession expires in 2027. This railroad also carried 1.1 million
passengers in 2006.
* Caraj&#225;s railroad - The concession of this 892 km railroad also expires
in 2027, it links Caraj&#225;s iron ore mines in the state of Par&#225; to
Ponta Madeira port terminal in the state of Maranh&#227;o. Vale plans to
operate a train of 3.2 km and 340 cars on this railroad.
* Ferrovia Centro-Atl&#226;ntica - Vale controls this railroad through the
subsidiary FCA. As it is shown on the Vale's operations map above, this 7,000
km railroad extends through 6 brazilian states, this railroad originally
belonged to the RFFSA. Vale's concession of this railroad expires in 2026.

Ports and Container terminals[66]

* Port of Tubar&#227;o - Vale owns and operates this port located in
Vit&#243;ria in the state of Espirito Santo.[67] It's the largest iron ore
embarking port in the world.[68] Around 80 million metric tons of iron ore are
shipped through the this port,[69] this means that roughly 30% of Vale's iron
ore production are shipped through the Tubar&#227;o Port.

* Ponta Madeira port terminal - Located in the state of Maranh&#227;o, it ships
around 70 million metric tons mostly of iron ore, but also of manganese and
copper for the company.

* Port of Sepetiba - Vale operates two maritime terminals in the Port of
Sepetiba area located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, together they ship around
60 million metric tons of iron ore.

Vale also operates port terminals in the state of Sergipe and two others in the
state of Espirito Santo."

OPMR,

I gave up on OPMR as well. Too many cheap companies with marginal business
models. In this kind of environment, those are a dime a dozen.

Thanks for the below-book insurance recommendations.

I still think SUAI is interesting here, with buyback slated to kick in after
they announce earnings (they announced buyback period starting April 15, but
they can't start buying back going right into the upcoming earnings release).
With 40% discount to tangible book, we could just live off the portfolio
investment income as long as they don't take major hits on insurance reserves.

OTOH, I was very wrong on NAHC and only made some money back after buying a lot
in December at very depressed prices.

ACAS - I am not sure why so much rejoicing at the announcement. I looked at it
and all I see is that the company is becoming even more impossible to value for
an outsider. It's now totally "faith" based investment based on management
claims. Well, most of BDCs are such investments, so it's not really a surprise,
but why should I be happy about it?

In short: there is no ROE since we have writedowns, P/Book is also not "clean"
due to the management claims that the "GAAP" prices of the assets are way lower
than "real" prices.

I am considering selling. The only reason I hold it is that it's pretty obvious
that macro-wise financials are cheap. Even Munger said something to that extent
which is like Buffett commented is the most optimistic he has heard Munger to
be for ages. ;) I wonder though why I should not swap ACAS into Buffett's

ACAS-- I listened to the cc/slides. They are very comfortable with this year
and next year's dividend. They took the hit and wrote everything down to mkt,
because ratios dropped in this qtr, they claim. I am not so sure they shouldn't
have taken some of the hit last qtr, but I think they really did write it all
down. With that cloud lifted, and a better understanding of GAPP and "non-GAPP
NAV" (my words), I can wait it out while the value of the shares appreciate to
better levels. I agree that the company is a bitch to understand, but I have
been studying it for years. I trust these clowns. :o)

The shares that I recently purchased in the $30 range will go into my long term

Hi Paul - Followed you in for a few shares of Aqua America Inc. (WTR). This

for a long term capital gain if it reverts back to its mean price of $22.5.

I sold my small number of shares in Advantage Energy Income Fund (AAV) for a
small gain. This stock should not have been in the IRA as the foreign tax
payments made is wasted money and is not recoverable through a foreign tax
credit like it is in a taxable account.

I bought WTR in my IRA also and for those reasons as well.
I hold AAV in my taxable account. Have several other Canadians in my ira though
-- and as you say, no offset for the 15% tax.
So far that's been okay with me as 85% of the high div. is high enough and
satisfactory enough for me.

I still am not understanding how the 15% Canadian tax and other country taxes
actually get offset on USA taxes. Once again, yes easy (always) as a deduction
and easy as a credit (a credit being better than a deduction) IF amount of
Canadian/other country taxes is less than $600 (married, joint filing). If more
than $600, then Form 1116 must be used. I find it impossible to understand and
fill out. Therefore, when I do complete my USA tax forms - using Turbotax -
I've only used the foreign taxes as a deduction. Not anywhere near as good as
getting the credit. Your point might be, some tax saving (a deduction) is
better than nothing (in the ira). My point would be that the tax saving isn't
enough for me to try moving Canroys into a taxable account which is already
near full. Obviously, we're all in different situations and with different
outlooks. I'm just giving my reasons for where I am/what I'm doing. No right or
wrong here (I hope.)

S&P KEEPS BUY RECOMMENDATION ON AMERICAN CAPITAL STRATEGIES
Wednesday 05/07/2008 11:37 AM ET - Standard & Poor's Research Notes

Q1 operating EPS of $0.77 vs. $0.73 misses our estimate by a penny. Portfolio
income was higher than we expected, fee income was lower, but costs were
controlled. We think new investments are attractively priced, and should
contribute to the growth of operating income. NAV declined sharply on
investment markdowns, but assets held to maturity are largely performing
in-line, and '08 looks secure, in our view. We are reducing our '08 operating
earnings estimate to $3.04 from $3.27 on lower fee income, and cutting our

Followed you in for a little bit of RIO for the reasons you stated. Very hard
to buy this company since my last buy in was 6/07. The stock has since then,
split and doubled in price. It is hard to find other Brazil/Latin American
public companies that offer a pure play in Brazil.

What I have discovered is that there are many smaller private companies located
in Brazil and/or Argentina that are consolidating/merging and or being bought
by foreigners. America Latina represents several smaller companies that were
recently merged together w/i the last 24 months.

Tenaris SA (TS) is one such name
http://www.tenaris.com/en/ProductsServices/Default.asp .

In the last decade, they have successfully expanded their business through a
series of strategic investments. They operate a worldwide network of seamless
steel pipe operations with manufacturing facilities in South America, North
America, Europe and Asia and an annual production capacity of over three
million tons of seamless steel pipe products, compared to 800,000 tons in the
early 1990s.

Tenaris SA (TS) may offer a value opportunity with a forward PE of 12.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=TS&t=5y

They are the leading supplier of welded pipes for gas pipeline construction and
industrial applications in South America. They supply welded steel pipes to
selected gas pipeline construction projects in South America including those
from Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR).

Finally they are building out their production capacity in Agentina and Brazil
by putting into operation a sucker rod plant in Brazil and acquiring and
revamping an existing bar mill located in San Luis. This will allow them to
meet new pipe demand for this region.

TS. A great call here and on other threads by fp_scientist in '06 and '07.
Fwiw, it was mentioned here (by Winix) that this company is controlled by Euro
based Techint Group who also own/control
TX (a stock that Winix liked). (TX recently in the news as a steel maker having
its confiscatory difficulties with Mr. Chavez.)
I still hold a few shares of both stocks.

Haven't looked closely at TS in a while though. In past, tubular steel
providers like TS have traded at p/e multiples well under 10. Now I believe
they are all (of the ones I follow) at much higher multiples. I don't know if
this is because all types of oil service equipment suppliers are in high
demand, or if the particular sector is being brought up to the multiples of
other equipment providers, or what. The business in past has been very cyclical
though, so I can understand why p/e multiples of 5-7 might've been the norm.

One other company whose stock I have for Brazil drill pipe is France's
diversified Vallourec:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=vlouf.pk

Fwiw, regarding drill pipe, the only company whose stock I'm buying now is
Chinese WH, operating in the Chinese market. Assuming the accounting is correct
as reported by Yahoo, the p/e is somewhere around 6-7, putting it in the range
I'm used to seeing in the past for this sector, and well below what every other
drill pipe manufacturer is selling for (afaik, and I may be very wrong.) Fwiw,

WFC looks good LT. It is one of the few banks that has increased their

while their rivals are diluting their shareholders and trying to stay intact
while shedding pieces and remaking their business model. i figure that WFC can
make 4$/share in a decent year, but of course during the next 1-2 years loan
losses and the recession will continue to mask the earnings power so i think
there is going to be a reasonable chance to get WFC for around 25$ again.

What people who are speculating on a comeback of Citigroup et. all. are

symbols are pretty high though... Did not try to buy on foreign exchanges, but
apparently they charge even more for that.

After looking at historical BDC numbers (ACAS, ALD, MCGC, etc.), I doubt that
ANY BDC can earn sustained ROE of 15%. And actually NONE of them did, except
for one year blip in 2005-2006. Anyone who is modeling BDC valuations based on
15% ROE is destined to be unhappy IMHO.

I continue to cut back on refiners as they fall (ouch). Averaging up a little

PBEGF - PBG.TO - what is your take on this one? Isn't it run up hugely on
speculation of their proprietary (?) tar sand process? Why would it be a value
proposition? Inquiring minds want to know. :)

Yes, sorry. I just got a little lazy.

For every stock I mention here I very determinedly try to post or reference
something brief about why I consider the stock a value. Or else I post it "ot"
if I don't see it as a value play.

Mixed signal on PBEGF. I'm averaging up, so value proposition somewhat
diminished with the higher price. If oil prices come down, then it's iffy to me
if the stock is a value play.
OTOH, if oil prices hold over say $90, for the price you pay now for the stock,
you get long-lived reserves, a Bakken player, exploration in Colombia (one of
the few companies that I can buy easily (It's outside of the Colombian stock
exchange.) to play the growth of Colombia (aside: also
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CIB ), and there's PBEGF's patented THAI process
(a new combustion technology for underground recovery of bitumen and heavy
oil).

I have held this stock since 2005, and I recently (and maybe too late) decided
to up my shares. Jumping up my position from April through now as stock has
moved up.

Averaging down on http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KDE with another small buy.
Company going through cash. stock still 2x cash though (no ltd), and maybe
there's some hope the toymaker will do okay with its big bet on Chaotic Games

Overweight and cut their tgt to $3 from $4, when in fact Lehman reiterated
their Equal Weight, and cut their target. Our previous comment has been

you must have some good data base. after reviewing 4 years of data for MCGC by
my calculations the average roe is 11.8%. nonetheless given the discount to
book the shares are now selling at, the roe for a current investor should be
well in excess of 16% over time which is my hurdle rate.

AIG - if you do own it now it's a sell @44$, IMO. Equity offering and the high
loss plus the large drop in book value (due to additional unrealized losses is
very disconcerning. I do not have a position in it any more (sold during the
runup). Worth a look again under 40$, maybe.

Midland:

Why do you say IAR is coming to an end?

I realize there is a ton of debt and a declining business, but at this point
the market value of the common is so small as a % of the total enterprise value
as to represent an option on a possible break-up or turnaround of some sort.

At least, that's been my view. I admit to only a cursory look.

It will be restructured. The business might exist in the one form or another
but the company is due for a cancellation of old and issuance of new equity.

The current metrics after the spinoff will proove to be unsustainable. That
said RHD is also not out of the woods. Ironically, also RHD was the result of a
spinoff but it happened 10 years earlier.

I am no expert; yet I did ask some specialists about the prospects. Many said,
the outlook for that sector is not pretty.
I view both of them as collateral damage caused by the ascent of google.
