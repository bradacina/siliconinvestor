Gulo, regarding SNFCA, it looks most of its revenue gain is from mortgage
financing and associated fees. If, so then I'd expect the p/e to be similarly
low as others in that business, and maybe lower than the p/e I'd expect from
specialty insurers. The specialty insurance apparently has to do with their
mortuary/cemetery business which they fund from the cash flows of their
mortgage financing/fees.

As you say, the p/e is low, and one needs to understand why. I can't easily see
the reason, and based on what on what I do see (p/book, unusually high roe &
roa now compared to past years), I'll pass on this one unless someone here can
offer a compelling reason to buy.

This jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

David,
It won't likely be helpful to you but I'll share my reasoning. First, I'm more
of a value stock trader than value investor as most here could be categorized.
I hold very few stocks for multiple years but I often trade the same stocks
(e.g., I've traded ANF about 4 times with holding periods of months) over the
years. I don't think ANF is overvalued but neither is it way undervalued as it
was in December. And I was wanting to raise cash because I think the market may
have a significant correction that will present new opportunities - possibly in
ANF. Also, while I don't do TA, I do look at charts and I see that ANF hasn't
broken above the low 30s in a few years - maybe this is the time. So I pocketed
a nice trader's profit on the run since the last time JC brought ANF up.

Thanks for your feedback on SNFCA. I bought some to tuck away on the hopes that
whatever has worked for them for the last 5 years will continue to work for
them. I don't expect mortgage refinancing to remain a cash cow, but the company
has been very consistent in maintaining a high growth rate.
I found the stock on a screen for >25% growth in EPS and Revenue in each of the
previous 1, 3, and 5-year periods. It was the only stock to come up. It
certainly is too illiquid to flip, but it strikes me as a decent "value" play.
That said, I haven't spent as much time digging as I usually do before
declaring a stock a value play.

Amoezzi - re TCN, TSU and TND
TSU and TND are "twins" very similar balance sheets, valuation and prospects
and balance sheet quality. I am sticking with TSU because of its slightly
higher growth and better liquidity. The stocks are closely correlated which may
come in handy - if TSU turns south (more) I may just take the ST loss and
switch to TND for tax reasons.

TCN is cheaper per P/S number than both TND and TSU but it has much weaker
fundamentals in terms of balance sheet (debt) and earnings. So TND and TSU are
more conservative and TCN is more speculative, IMO. the issue that I have with
TCN is that their balance sheet is still weak even though its improving. TCN is
FCF positive but only because they are not investing - they continue to operate
the outdate TDMA network while competitors are upgrading to CDMA and GSM
rapidly. this is the reason why TCN is loosing market share. If TCN starts to
upgrade to GSM or CDMA their FCF will turn negative unless they can improve
their profit margin considerably. I do note that yahoo has a forward P/E of 8
for TCN but I do not know what this estimate is based upon, it looks very
optimistic to me.

They are fighting against better capitalized competitors with better networks
and are loosing market share, that's the reason why they are so cheap. If they
can continue to turn around the stock should outperform TSU and TND, if
fundamentals turn for the worse, they will be a marginal player operating with
outdated hardware. But sure the TCN's chart looks better, especially today.

FWIW, I added to my entry position in TSU today.

Two suggestions:

http://www.riskgrades.com/retail/registration/index.cgi

or

BETA (from the Yahoo financial glossary):

The measure of a fund's or a stock's risk in relation to the market or to an
alternative benchmark. A beta of 1.5 means that a stock's excess return is
expected to move 1.5 times the market excess returns. E.g., if market excess
return is 10%, then we expect, on average, the stock return to be 15%. Beta is
referred to as an index of the systematic risk due to general market conditions
that cannot be diversified away.

Beta equation (security)
The market beta of a security is determined as follows: Regress excess returns
of stock y on excess returns of the market. The slope coefficient is beta.
Define n as number of observation numbers. Beta =
[(n) (sum of [xy]) ]-[ (sum of x) (sum of y)]/
[(n) (sum of [xx]) ]-[ (sum of x) (sum of x)]
where: n = # of observations (usually 36 to 60 months)
x = rate of return for the S&P 500 index
y = rate of return for the security

Understand the business and understand the financial statements enough to value
the business. Then understand what the current price vs. the intrinsic value
and the risk inherent in the business implies about the odds of losing money on
the investment. I know of no other way to do this. Shortcuts don't work, though

amoezzi, if you are "going long a stock trade", then I assume that by
"trading", you are a trader. If so, the best way (imo) to estimate risk/reward
for your next trade is the historical performance you've recently experienced.

Assuming further that your previous trades and next trade are about similar as
regards the amount of money bet on each trade, then your risk to reward ratio
best estimator (imo) for your next trade = ratio of past total of losses ($)to
total of past gains ($).

That is, for traders, I assume the best measure of risk to reward for an
upcoming trade ought to correspond to what the trader's results have shown in
similar past situations.

Insider Sales Are Puzzling as Stocks Keep Rising
By KENNETH N. GILPIN

Published: February 22, 2004

UCH to the surprise of analysts who watch corporate insiders' stock trades, the
market has moved steadily higher since last summer, even though insider sales
have far outnumbered purchases.

Jonathan Moreland, who is a money manager and the director of research at

InsiderInsights.com, a weekly investment research newsletter, has been tracking
insider trading activity among corporate managers for about a decade. He took
some time last week to discuss why the market has been bucking this selling
trend. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Market watchers started to become bearish over the summer, though stocks
continued to plow higher. Historically, what has been the lag between changes
in certain buying and selling activity and swings in the stock market? And why
is it different this time?

A. In my experience, the lags are anywhere from three months to six months.
Obviously, it is different this time, but I don't blame the insiders for this.

Last summer, I didn't expect the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates this
low for this long, or to see the utterly fabulous growth we had in the third
quarter of last year, or the good growth we had in the fourth quarter.

Q. Analysts compile their readings in different ways. What is your methodology,
and what is it showing now?

A. I look at the number of companies where insiders are buying or selling and
at open-market transactions, and make a ratio out of that. Right now there are
about twice as many sellers as buyers.

Historically, it is an outrageously bearish reading. It is so negative that I
am not going to pay any attention to it until it really starts to improve.

Q. Why is that?

A. The smart play is to still be long the market. There is nothing inconsistent
with the insider signal being bearish. But right now it is correct to be
hedged, it is incorrect to be leveraged, and it is very correct to be wary.

Q. It's not smart to look at one incidence of buying or selling to draw a
conclusion about a company's prospects, is it?

A. One data point is not enough, but it is enough to get you looking at the
history, and you wouldn't know what history to look at unless you used the data
point. I think if you look at this you should look back a minimum of three
years and preferably five years.

That is because within a six-month period insiders cannot sell and buy, or buy
and sell, in the open market.

One other point: insider activity tends to be a good indicator. But it only
gets me looking at the fundamentals of a company.

Q. Aside from your "outrageously bearish" sell/buy ratio indicator, what are
you worried about?

A. A very delicate balance of factors is holding up the market and the world's
economies right now. Low interest rates, a falling dollar and low inflation are
keeping things going. I don't know how much longer these conditions can
continue, but I don't think it's much longer.

If any of these factors change in the next year, they will probably be
reflected first in the stock market, which is a harbinger of things to come.
And we haven't even talked about the geopolitical uncertainties.

Q. A couple of weeks ago, buying activity by insiders at 3M raised some
eyebrows. Why?

A. I can't remember the last time insiders at a component of the Dow Jones
industrial average were buyers in the open market. And I can't remember the
last time I had a Dow component on my recommended stock list.

Insiders at large-cap companies have less of a need to purchase in the open
market because, by the time you become an insider, you have lots of stock
options.

Q. Where else is there buying activity?

A. I have recently noticed buying trends in energy. We own Parker Drilling and
Plains All American Pipeline. And we are looking at Tesoro Petroleum.

There was also a little splurge in biotechnology, and we have been looking at
Genta and at Guilford Pharmaceuticals. We are invested in Enzo Biochemicals.

And you always see insider buying in regional bank stocks.

Q. Are there other stocks you favor?

A. In health care, I still like Microtek Medical, even though the stock is up
by more than 300 percent over the last 83 weeks. At a price of around $6 it is
arguably lots better than other stocks out there.

And Network Equipment Technologies is as safe a bet as there is out there.

Q. For the past several months investors have been piling money into stocks,
particularly through mutual funds. Is that a sound strategy?

A. I really don't think people are paying enough attention to the risks in
their portfolios. I think people should either be hedging more or not being
greedy. Take some profit off the table and put it into more conservative
investments.

forecasts.

I started using SSG's in 1989 when I first began investing on my own. I look at

Steve, i don't think that anyone can predict short term stock fluctuation so my
guess was just as good as yours and I just got lucky. The 32$ number came from
the fact that UTSI has bounced of this level twice.

The fundamentals for this stock look fairly good but i don't like the fact that
it has a huge analyst coverage and quite a bit following from the mo-mo crowd.
This makes me somewhat less sure that I found a mispriced stock. The odds favor
a bounce of the 32$ for a few bucks but i also think that K's scenario of the
stock falling into the gap between 20 and 30$ with little support merits some
attention.

But to answer your questions, I have not bought yet, been to busy to follow my
stocks today. I'll put in an limit order for tomorrow and see how it goes.

Anyone subscribe to Validea.com? They publish a "guru portfolio", and their Ben
Graham has been their best performer so far.

http://yahoo.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/feb2004/nf20040218_7572_db006.htm

I found the BusinessWeek interview with Validea's founder very interesting,
especially the stock choices that he mentioned.

Q: What stocks are in the Graham portfolio?
A: Each portfolio consists of 10 stocks. Graham's portfolio is Building
Materials (BMHC ), Natuzzi (NTZ ), Orthodontic Centers of America (OCA ),
Wescast Industries (WCST ), Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP ), Ameron Intl. (AMN
), Industrias Bachoco (IBA ), LaFarge Intl. (LAF ), Skechers (SKX ), and Stage
Stores (STGS ).

Of the above ten, I have seven. They rebalance their portfolios monthly; I
don't know what "rebalance" means in Validea's context, but for me, and just
guessing, I'd say I've held each my seven stocks at least a year. (For example,
I've posted on AMN since 2000, I believe.) It seems to me there's a conflict
for Validea: to keep subscriber interest and provide a sense that subscribers
are getting value-for-money spent, the list - I would guess - has to be
"updated" or changed frequently. But, it's my opinion that Ben Graham types
have to be patient to see gains work out, so it's not at all unusual to expect
to hold these stocks for quite a while, certainly more than a few months. I'd
like to know how Validea might deal with this.

"(John)Reese (Validea founder) points out that Validea also compiles a hot list
of stocks that have garnered the most interest among the strategies. That list
now includes Bank of America (BAC ), PetroChina (PTR ), D.R. Horton (DHI ),
Fresh Del Monte (FDP ), Foot Locker (FL ), Home Depot (HD ), Pulte Homes (PHM
), and Royal Dutch Petroleum (RD )." Here again, it seems to me most, if not
all, of these stocks have been mentioned here when they were at lower prices,
and I assume those here who bought at that time are still holding many of their
shares. For me, I might characterize my positions here as "comfortable
holdings" but not "hot".

Any comments here on the Validea approach and possible worth of a subscription?

We all need sources of ideas. Of course, since you already have 7 of the 10
Graham portfolio stocks, I'm not sure they'd be providing you with any new
ideas. Maybe there are more 'new ideas' in some of the other portfolios. I'm
not impressed with their published returns since July 2003. From self-reporting
on this board, I think many value investors/traders have far outperformed the
S&P over that time.
Our two portfolios here have outperformed their hot list so far this year.
Maybe we should start a newsletter.

WaMu Most Innovative, says Fortune Magazine. Press Release snip:

Washington Mutual Tops Fortune's Innovation List with New Retail Banking Store
Concept, Bilingual Talking ATMs, CD eBay Auction; WaMu also Rated Top Mortgage
Services Company

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 25, 2004--"Innovative bank." Sounds like a
classic oxymoron -- but not according to FORTUNE magazine's annual survey.

This week, FORTUNE magazine announced that Washington Mutual (NYSE:WM) was the
No. 1 rated company nationally in the innovation category as part of the
publication's 2004 Most Admired Companies list, which is expected to hit
newsstands March 1. The company also earned top ranking in its Mortgage
Services industry group.

In terms of innovation, Washington Mutual bested such venerable organizations
as Starbucks, Procter & Gamble, Herman Miller, UPS, and Nike. Nationally and
internationally recognized for transforming retail banking, the company also
recently received awards from the Lafferty Group, U. S. Banker and the Retail

Paul: On Validea - If you have 7 of the 10 they have, your approach is
similar...except you likely look beyond the strictly quantitative approach that
these 'systems' employ. That's why you might not have the others. $29/month is
sort of pricey IMO. Several free 'guru' screeners are available, including this
one based on Validea: http://www.nasdaq.com/reference/guru.stm
I've found it very difficult, personally, to follow the advice of guru's or

Berkshire's Charlie Munger on value investing

Here's a book review on Damn Right, a study of Munger's investment philosophy.
The guy does not mind volatility since his value bent serves as a floor to his
portfolio. His investors had a ride however, the guy concentrated his bets into
a few names he found attractive.

http://www.financialsense.com/fsu/posts/dancy/reviews/022504.html

With all the Enron style accounting fiascos I'm not sure concentrating bets is
the way to go these days - if you can trust the numbers it might be - but if
one company "blows up" due to falsified financials it can really hurt a

Value based portfolio

For what it is worth we look for value plays that have growth characteristics
that also meet some fundamental TA characteristics - the best of all worlds.
High relative strength, low p/s ratio, high revenue and EPS growth rates. And
an inefficient niche - small firms. FWIW our portfolio is on page two of the
attached report:

We use screens to find these firms - otherwise the pile of interesting firms to

RE: ADG ALLIED DEFENSE GROUP

The Allied Defense Group CEO Provides 2003, 2004 Outlook In Special Letter to
Shareholders CEO Sees Bright and Exciting Future for the Company

PR Newswire, Thursday, February 26, 2004 at 06:00

VIENNA, Va., Feb 26, 2004 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- The Allied
Defense Group, Inc. (Amex: ADG) announces it issued a Special Letter to
Shareholders in an effort to update existing Allied Defense investors on the
current status of the Company. Text of the letter follows:"Dear Fellow
Shareholders,

The Allied Defense Group strategic vision for the future continues to be growth
over the long-term. To accomplish this mission, we continue to rely upon the
performance of our strategic portfolio of defense and security businesses, as
well as take advantage of attractive opportunities that may arise on the
acquisition front. This vision led us to a position of stability today and will
continue to guide and shape Allied Defense into the future.

Reviewing 2003

We are in the process of completing our year-end financial statements. We are
scheduled to report our 2003 earnings March 2, 2004.

Our European subsidiaries have had an excellent year. MECAR continues to serve
its long-term customer base and has begun to reap the benefits of its customer
diversification efforts. This will result in another above-average year for
MECAR. In addition, the VSK Group's diversification efforts resulted in a 30%
increase in product exports and the subsidiary will report its best year ever.

Several factors outside our control affected our domestic subsidiaries. Delays
in Department of Homeland Security funding appropriations adversely affected
sales at NS Microwave. Orders began to flow later in the year, which benefited
the fourth quarter but not enough to salvage the year. Titan Dynamics has been
undergoing a U.S. Navy/Marine Corps sponsored $1.5 million safety certification
program that is scheduled for successful completion in the second half of 2004.
During 2003, Titan's sales potential suffered for lack of the certification.
SeaSpace Corporation was affected by lower margins from its X-band product
sales and increased competition. We have aggressively taken steps throughout
the year to"right size"our U.S. companies. Customer diversification,
implementation of new leadership, a reduction of the workforce, and material
cost reduction efforts were components to the"right sizing."The growth at the
European subsidiaries offset the losses experienced by the U.S. subsidiaries,
ensuring a profitable year overall. Preliminary financial results show growth
of consolidated revenue and lower net earnings for 2003, compared to our
earnings for 2002, as a result of the U.S. subsidiary losses. I am proud to
report that the Company produced its seventeenth consecutive profitable
quarter.

In addition, we commenced a series of business initiatives in 2003 aimed at
enhancing the profitability of our subsidiaries. We are very excited about
those initiatives and look forward to the benefits of each.

2004 Goals

My initial report to you was less than one year ago, July 2, 2003, when I
reported my five primary areas of concentration: Grow Shareholder Value,
Improve Corporate Profitability, Support the ADG Acquisition Strategy, Focus on
the Corporate Vision, Enhance the Corporate Culture. The ADG goals for 2004
continue to support and enhance those efforts and keep us on target to achieve
our strategic corporate vision:

* Enhance the profitability of our four U.S. subsidiaries

* Complete composition of our North American Credit Facility

* Acquire a mid-sized company to provide increased strategic stability

* Facilitate the establishment and integration of our newest U.S.

subsidiary, MECAR USA

* Aggressively expand our worldwide customer base

We are focused on long-term success for Allied Defense and will strive to
propel the Company along that path.

2004 Outlook

Those of you who have followed Allied Defense for a long period of time
recognize that the Company has been extremely fortunate in the last few years.
We have enjoyed several large and lucrative MECAR contracts that temporarily
accelerated our growth. These contracts and customer relationships have also
enabled us to build a strong business and market presence upon which to grow in
the future. As a larger, more diverse company, Allied Defense is well
positioned to deliver substantial revenue and earnings.

Although our dependency on MECAR has somewhat declined over the last few years,
the firm is still our primary source of revenue and has a major impact on the
financial results for the Company. MECAR had very profitable years in 2002 and
2003. The backlog from a very large order received in early 2002 was, for the
most part, exhausted in 2003. The absence of large orders at MECAR will
translate into a more normal level of production in 2004. The subsidiary is
expected to remain profitable, but on a smaller scale than in recent years. We
fully intend to compete for and win more of those large contracts. In fact, we
are in competition for a large contract at this time and like our chances for
success. The results for that contract award are not expected until late in
2004.

The VSK Group had its best year ever in 2003 and is expected to repeat that
same accomplishment in 2004.

Our U.S. subsidiaries have been"right sized"for profitability in 2004 and are
expected to perform considerably better than in 2003.

Our newest subsidiary, MECAR USA, is expected to commence operations in the
fourth quarter of 2004 and we are very excited about its prospects. MECAR USA
provides us the opportunity to exploit our current MECAR technologies to
address a $1.5 billion annual market in the United States. The new company will
initially manufacture ammunition and pyrotechnics components to meet domestic
and international defense requirements. MECAR USA will be based in Marshall,
Texas, and will share a facility with Titan Dynamics.

We look forward to producing solid, expected results, accentuated by very
profitable contracts, long into the future.

Our Exciting Future

We are proud of our track record and our optimism grows daily about the
opportunities for Allied Defense in the coming years. Our forward looking
growth strategy and future potential make the Company a compelling investment.
Your management team is dedicated to increasing the value of your investment in
The Allied Defense Group. We are incredibly privileged to play a role in the
enrichment of this Company and will continue to serve its owners, the
shareholders.

Sincerely,

John G. Meyer, Jr.

re. ADG. May be a hold at this point. Still looks relatively inexpensive (p/bk,
etc.) esp. as compared to other defense companies. The company will be
profitable this year, and its cash exceeds its debt.

Based on today's information, I now believe I was wrong in my opinion that the
stock was a buy at dips under $20 (i.e. at $19-20).

Over the past few years there have been many opportunities to buy this stock at
even better prices than today's. Although times change and the company has new
management now and a broader product line, I am willing to bet that given
today's punk news maybe I might be able to buy this stock at even better prices
than today's approx. $18.40. Perhaps once again I'll see $15-$16. To that end,
this morning I've cut back my relatively outsize position by selling all the
shares I've accumulated this year, in '03, in '02, and about 2/3 of my '99
position.

Jmo, and as I say, I've been wrong many, many times (with both buying and
selling decisions).

Joe, It has been a long time I did not see your post. Glad you are back and
thanks for the nice review on the Munger book.

I am trying to use a similar approach as yours - find value plays with growth
characteristics, once the growth become real, hold on to it, don't just sell at
"fair value".

My largest holding ALVR in Feb2003 was ALVR, trading at $1.86 with $3.3
cash/share, no debt, cash burn rate 8cent/Q and improving. Later the growth
turned out to be real, and I revised sell target multiple times just in time to
hold on(I recommended on this board at 1.86, later around 3, 5, 8) - still have
majority of shares now at $14.30. It was a "Value Investor's Dream Come
True!!!!"

I held two other home run stocks before, bought PHTN at cash value $3 and sold
$65 in two years, bought SINA at cash value $1.5 and unloaded at 10, 20, 38,
still hold some at 43 now.

Overall my modified value investing approach (hold the fast growers and watch
long-term market momentum) had significantly improved my return comparing with
if I were using regular "sell at fair value" approach, portfolio returned 180%
in 2003 without using margin, option or futures, just long/short common stocks.
Die-hard Ben Graham style investors may predict I will fail sometime. But I
insist on this modification. Warren Buffett's many great stocks picks were not
accepted by Graham while Buffett worked in his partnership, which eventually
led to Buffett's quit. Buffett's modification to "value" was instrumental to
his great success - such as the American Express name brand play. How many
Graham style value stocks are available today that do not have significant
problems? probably none today.

Good Luck and Keep in touch!

I've had a recent difficulties with lots of cash from stock sales, but no good
ideas for stock purchases. I've been opening 2% FDIC insured savings accounts.
Recently, I paid off the mortgage on my house. My rationale was that it's the
equivalent of purchasing a high quality bond currently yielding 6% with a
coupon that floats with inflation (I had an old adjustable.) If I need future
leverage, I can use margin, or just set up a home equity line of credit.

I came to that solution after discussing a refi with my 'innovative' WaMu
banker. He wanted to charge the same fees as if I were a new John just coming
through the door, despite the fact that he had held my mortgage for 20 years.
He had no interest in keeping a longtime, problem-free customer. (I gather that
WaMu has a reputation for customer indifference. I don't know what that means
for their bottom line, but in a commodity business, holding clients may be
important.)

It's not my buys or buying ideas that're giving me trouble and pain now - it's

market is to sell. I was wrong to sell YUM recently on Avian virus in Asia (no
affect apparently on YUM's KFC franchises); I was wrong to trim MGAM position
recently (ouch)and CZR, wrong to cut back on ANF during its recent drop, wrong
to snip ARW.

It's not like ALVR was an unknown stock here until you mentioned it 2/03.
Before being ALVR it was BRZE, and BRZE was mentioned here several times in
2001 and maybe later. Anyone who bought then and held on has seen at least a
double. And anyone here who added to their position has done even better. A
good time to have added or bought would've been about 3/31/03 when ALVR was

I'll add a little more to my small position in VLO. Tough buy for me. I was
less confident of the business and stock when it was under $40 and discussed
here last year. Now that it's close to $60 I'm more confident of the business
prospects. My confidence could be totally misplaced however. And given the
moves in the stock, the sector, and the oil business in general, at this point
(~$60), the stock might be toppy and more dangerous than I suspect

Paul, I don't ever regret selling stocks. I do regret selling pieces of
companies that are performing well. I continue to hold a cluster of companies
that I feel comfortable with. I've had a lot of buy-outs, and I've dumped
things that seem to be over-priced.

I'm delighted if the person I sell shares to makes a profit as well. I like to
think that I've gotten the 'safe' or 'easy' gain. I will confess that I often
don't relook at a 'sold' stock for a period of time. Missed profit bothers me a
lot less than a loss.

I'm not finding stuff to buy, and market metrics suggest a 'top' rather than a
'bottom'. FWIW, I looked at Value Line the other day and noticed that even
their indicators on the first page of the index are beyond the limits
established for their universe during the last market peak.

yield & grt-g

Another reit preferred started trading last week: grt-g. These seem to start
trading close to issue price, then move to a premium. I expect that to continue
as long as interest rates don't climb too much. This one yields 7.9% ($2.03 div
/ $25.50 price). However if redeemed in 2009 at $25, the effective yield is
7.6%.

I expect the price to quickly (30 days) move to $26.4 to make the yield in line
with other preferred shares -- again, unless overall rates rise. I'll take the
3.5% gain if it occurs. But I'll hold this for awhile since this investment
replaces other preferreds which were selling at premiums.

PS
I posted here about grt-f last septmeber, when it started trading and the price
was under $24.88. Now the price is $26.8 (effective yield 6.7%).

CNC - I sent the CNC link to a friend of mine who does more DD than I do,
listens to all Conf calls, and who models the financials like a maniac. Here's
a bit of what he sent me. I think the issue of acquisitions could be
significant, and the fact that CNC is medicade niche and offers savings in
these times of state budget troubles is quite a nice niche to be in.
....................

Note that UNH is a big cap, while AGP and CNC are small cap.
Note that UNH is a full blown HMO and is simply not comparable to AGP and CNC
which are only Medicaid.

Note below that three other respected analyst have a very different opinions
about the growth rate for CNC, three say 20% and BofA says 13%.

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, Inc. Reconfirms Growth Rate 3-5 Year 20.00 %
02/10/2004
Banc of America Securities, LLC New Growth Rate 3-5 Year 13.00 % 02/06/2004.
BofA just started coverage. (prior to earnings release 2/10/04)
Thomas Weisel Partners Reconfirms Growth Rate 3-5 Year 20.00 20.00 % 01/05/2004
(prior to earnings release 2/10/04)
SG Cowen & Company Reconfirms Growth Rate 3-5 Year 20.00 20.00 % 01/23/2004
(prior to earnings release 2/10/04)

Guidance on 2/10/04 for FYE04 revenue $940-950 million, EPS $1.89-1.96 and
excludes any acquisitions. That is up 22.2% from FYE03 $1.58.

Please note guidance specifically excluded any acquisitions.

For FYE 12/05 I have four analysts estimates, none from BofA, CIBC World
Markets=2.25, Thomas Weisel=2.25, USBancorp Piper Jaffray=2.27, and Legg Mason
= 2.14.
That is 16.6% y-o-y average. All are very respectable firms.

Analysts have no courage right now, no optimism, and are
scarred to death of being called overly optimistic for fear of being
prosecuted.

Michael F. Neidorff, Centene's President and Chief Executive Officer, will
present on Thursday, March 4, 2004 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The presentation
will be available as a live audio web cast at the conference website

Joe Dancy, okay I'll take a little EXXA, a stock on your list.

Risky microcap, imo. High d/e, persistent insider trading. (Data from Yahoo) I
also don't like the way the trading volume fluctuates between few hundred
sh./day to many thousands/day. (But this observation may be irrelevant.)
Business doesn't seem so attractive to me; I defer to you here, assuming
company meets your "value play that has growth characteristics" desirability.

Low p/e; high roe. Maybe the company can continue to do better after coming out
of its reorg. I'm suspicious.

Small bet only for me.

Coal - more energy doom and gloom from grommit.

Dale, I think this is happening. I've read where some NG plants under
construction may not be able to get the NG the contracted for because the
supplies don't exits -- enron contracts with no substance.

coal outlook today:
http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/040301/minerals_stocks_1.html

However, I think it's a longer term effect than that link mentions -- it will
be a permanent condition. I bought BTU a few months ago after reading about the
long term needs for coal. I thought it was overpriced at the time.

Paul, I know you bought NSC
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=19575008&s=nsc
which looks like a good coal bet. I bought BNI for the same reason. Both
companies are doing better than the other railroads in recent months.

I posted this before, excuse the repeat.
"In 1999 the Natural Petroleum Council projected that supply growth in natural
gas would be adequate to increase gas use by 36% by 2010. In 2001 we had a
record drilling boom for Natural Gas. This failed to budge supply. In 2003
natural gas clearly faces a crisis... I will tell you that there is a growing
genuine concern in Washington about what is happening with natural gas today.

http://www.peakoil.net/iwood2003/MatSim.html

Nat gas depletion is in the same boat as oil. NG wells deplete faster than oil.
Texas production dropping even with more and more wells drilled. Mexico shut
off exports to US and is importing NG now. Canada expected to fill the slack
but cannot.

"NG will not solve the energy-supply problem caused by oil depletion...
disturbing signs that rates of NG extraction in North America will soon start
on an inexorable downhill slope -- perhaps within a few months or at most a few
years..."

I bought ACS, Affliated Computer Services, thinking it would continue to
benefit from outsourcing trends and repeat business (90% of 03 revs were
recurring). Gartner estimates worldwide Business Processing Outsourcing market
at $131bil, growing at 9% compounded. ACS gets 74% of revs from BPO.

I found ACS last week screening on MSN for stocks with the following
attributes: 10 rating, "A" valuation, "A" fundamental, rev and eps growth >15%,
net profit margin >10%, ROE >16%, debt/e <.4 but with a slightly "broken
chart."

ACS has a strong history of consistency: 37 consecutive qtrs of double digit
EPS growth and has not missed guidance since 1994. Has a culture of frugality
(spends only 1.4% of revs on sales and marketing!) Does 57% govt, 43%
commercial, which could improve with recent acquisition of Lockheed Martin
commercial unit. Acquired part of Andersen WW in May 02. Has 40,000 people
supporting client operations in nearly 100 countries. In the news recently for
investigation over a $7mil contract and sold off, but it does $4bil in sales.

On June 27 Value Line reiterated its #2 Timeliness Rating (above Average for

fiscal 2005 at $3.05 per share. Its current estimate for fiscal 2004, ending
6/30, is $2.60 per share. It says that current projections indicate that the
shares offer attractive 3- to 5-year appreciation potential, to a price range
of 80 to 120 per share. It says that problems with the state of Georgia have
been resolved; it notes that investigations are going on in Florida regarding
some contracts and says that it cannot comment on the merits of the
investigations. Finally, VL says that ACS continues to perform well, that the
integration of acquisitions is going well, and that the company will probably
be making additional acquisitions, which will be helped by the company's large
cash position. It rates financial strength as "A".

The current PE ratio is about 18.5, compared with average annual PE ratios of
more than 21 for each year since 1996. The leading PE ratio, according to VL's

Grommit, unlike Dale Baker I sold my coal stock BEFORE the big run up. Oops.
It's cost me: psychologically I've not been able to step back in - or up. BTU.
And esp. Dale's pick of FDG which has been a terrific performer to this very
day. Even at its lower prices and VERY decent div., I just could not get myself
to go for even just my usual very small amount. :>(

Meanwhile, I'm holding gas/oil stocks I've mentioned before.

I also have read that there's exploration going on apace, but that not as much
as expected is being found. I'm assuming the big potentials will be in moving
gas from Alaska or by developing foreign - e.g. the "stan" countries. This will
take big capital with big bets. So as with Alaska, we see Mr. Buffett's
Mid-American involved for the potential profits.
One conclusion: I want to be on Exxon, which BECAUSE of its size, could become
even a bigger player.

Been investing many years; never until the past few months have I considered
XOM - too big, too slow(?), too dull.

As I've posted earlier, unlike what I usually do (wait for low prices), I've
been waiting to see if XOM will hit new highs. Which I will interpret as a
positive that others might be having the same thesis.

Jmo, I could be very wrong as I have been so many times, esp. in this sector.

Anyway, fwiw, I'm adding a little to my little XOM position today.
