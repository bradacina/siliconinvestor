Interesting idea. I'm going to add this to my watch list.
A couple of notes: Tangible book stated at about $6/share as of the last
Quarter based on SEC filing.
Lump sums received should help it related to the settlements.

One thing I've been trying to stay away from is high debt companies, and

Which is about current tangible book + 1B they are receiving. I did not look
what else they may receive, but I doubt HUN will trade at book anytime soon. So
if they are only receiving $1B, I am not interested. Also, the payments are
going to be made through 2009, so market can be skeptical about them.

An A. C. Moore Arts & Crafts (ACMR) mention in this article about the crafts
business. I'll likely join you in this issue today. The stock has acted well so
far in December. I like the crafts sector for 2009 and beyond as a play on a
simpler lifestyle that I think many are now facing.

Dee Archer of AC Moore Arts & Crafts at Pine Island and Pondella roads in Cape
Coral, has experienced high traffic, particularly on weekends. "The hours of 11
a.m. to 3 p.m. are what we call 'Moore Time,' when the store is flooded with
our most loyal customers," she said.

Sales have been strong since the store first opened in mid-September. "People
are making things at home instead of buying them," she said, noting that
customers buy molds to make their own chocolates and are doing more baking, and
giving the gift of goodies.

The staff of AC Moore anticipated the trend. "We thought people would be
hand-making gifts just to save some money. We talked about it months ago,
figuring people would do more home baking."

Archer knows it was the right call. "They've been flying off the shelves,"
Archer happily reports. "People are definitely looking for the best price.
That's clear this year.

Christmas decoration sales have also been strong. "I've never seen them go so
fast. We're pretty much picked clean." Still, she says, "It does have a
different feel this year."

AC Moore shopper Betsy Hays, 52, of North Fort Myers, bought bags for
chocolate-covered pretzel rods. She started the project for her daughter to
give as gifts at school and thought she might like to give them to teachers at
Tropical Isles Elementary, where she's a speech pathologist.

The economy has affected Hays' holiday spending. "I'm trying not to charge
anything. I'm trying to not to incur any debt. I'm thinking about the future.
I'm being more careful. It's also a good lesson for my daughter. I don't want
her to be irresponsible one day."

She and her fifth-grade daughter, Rebecca, thought it would be a fun project to
do together.

"I can't say I've ever given food gifts," she said, "but I wanted to be able to
give people something they would appreciate while I stretch my gift giving
dollars."

further that estimates will come down but RIG with its contracts in place, will
still earn $10-11/sh. At p/e of 4 or lower on current price, that's low enough

“First you say you do, and then you don’t. And then you say you will, and then
you won’t. You’re undecided now, so what are you gonna do?”

David G. Klein
— “Undecided,” by Sid Robin and Charlie Shavers

UNFORTUNATELY, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has turned this old song
into the unofficial theme of the Troubled Assets Relief Program, the $700
billion bailout. His frequent changes of direction are not only embarrassing,
they also upset the very markets this program was designed to calm.

It pains me to say this, because I was among the first to call upon Congress to
create two institutions to deal with the financial crisis: one to buy and
refinance home mortgages, the other to buy what came to be called “troubled
assets.” The legislation signed in October empowered the TARP to do both. Sadly
and amazingly, it has done neither.

Regarding mortgages, Mr. Paulson is in a tong war with Sheila C. Bair,
chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who wants to deploy a
small fraction of the TARP money to refinance millions of mortgages. Her plan
may not be perfect — whose is? — but she’s pushing in the right direction. But
he, apparently, disagrees and has devoted no money to this purpose.

Regarding mortgage-related securities — the “troubled assets” themselves — Mr.
Paulson stunned markets on Nov. 12 by announcing that he wouldn’t spend a dime
on that purpose, either. Oh? As one of my students asked me the next morning,
shouldn’t they at least change the name?

Instead, taxpayer money has been used mainly to recapitalize ailing banks. To
be sure, this use of the TARP is perfectly legal. The legislation gives the
secretary broad authority to buy “any other financial instrument” that he deems
“necessary to promote financial market stability.” That certainly includes
buying bank stock.

The question is not one of legality, but of judgment. Old-fashioned believers
in democracy may recall that a reluctant Congress was sold on the idea of
buying troubled assets, not on injecting capital into banks. No wonder members
are crying foul.

In fairness, Mr. Paulson was not alone in advocating capital injections. Many
economists and financial experts agreed. But I doubt that many of them intended
for the government to buy preferred stock with no control rights, at
above-market prices and with no public-purpose strings attached. The automakers
are not being treated this way in their $13.4 billion loan.

Because about half of the $700 billion remains uncommitted, let’s review the
arguments supporting the three main uses of the TARP:

MORTGAGES The financial crisis began with falling home prices and fears of
rampant mortgage defaults — fears that are now coming true. Those fears
depressed the values of securities based on mortgages, making them “troubled.”
Foreclosures are painful and costly events that destroy real estate values and
force fire sales of homes — which depress prices further. It is hard to see a
way out of this mess without seriously reducing foreclosures. Understanding
that, Congress directed the Treasury secretary to use the TARP to get mortgages
refinanced. But he has not.

MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES There were several rationales for buying troubled
mortgage-backed securities. First, panic had virtually shut down the markets
for these securities — markets that must be restarted to restore our system of
mortgage finance. Second, one source of that panic was that nobody knew what
the securities were worth. A functioning market would establish objective
valuations. Third, many mortgages are buried in complex securities. Buying the
securities would let government refinance the underlying mortgages.

Mr. Paulson says he changed his mind about buying troubled assets because the
facts changed. I’m sure that many facts changed. But what new facts invalidate
the rationales above?

Furthermore, there are clear synergies among the main uses: Buying
mortgage-backed securities helps the government acquire mortgages to refinance,
refinancing mortgages to avert foreclosures enhances the values of these
securities, and both policies support the one position that Mr. Paulson has
embraced wholeheartedly, bolstering the finances of banks.

RECAPITALIZING BANKS Granting the secretary catch-all authority to buy “any
other financial instrument” was a sensible addendum to the law. It offered
much-needed flexibility to respond to unforeseen circumstances — an auto
bailout, for example. But whoever imagined that the addendum would consume
nearly all the TARP money, leaving nothing for its two stated purposes?

But suppose you believe (though I don’t) that recapitalizing banks was the best
use of all the money. Even then, the secretary’s execution leaves much to be
desired. Never mind the lack of transparency and the management issues recently
cited by the Government Accountability Office. Think about this:

Treasury has bought preferred stock with no control rights. The 5 percent
dividend rate that taxpayers will generally receive is half what Warren Buffett
got from Goldman Sachs. Banks receiving capital injections through the front
door are generally allowed to pay dividends out the back door. And there are no
public-purpose quid pro quos, such as a minimal lending requirement. So banks
can just sit on the capital, which is what most of them have done, or use it to
make acquisitions, as a few have.

Clearly, Mr. Paulson bent over backward to make the terms attractive to banks.
He contended that wide participation was essential in order to avoid stigma. To
that end, he even forced money on several bankers who didn’t want it.
Naturally, the strong banks that didn’t want the money made that fact known to
the markets immediately. Throwing taxpayer money where it was not needed wasted
a precious resource.

So here we are, looking at an all-too-familiar story. The administration that
brought you the Iraq war and the Katrina response is locking in another
disaster before it leaves town. What to do?

Fortunately, the TARP legislation authorized a first tranche of $350 billion
but wisely gave Congress a mechanism for blocking release of the second $350
billion. With the first tranche now committed, Mr. Paulson said he would soon
request release of the second. Based on his performance to date, Congress
should reject that request unless he agrees to spend most of the next
installment on TARP’s two stated purposes.

Failing that, we can wait a month for the new Treasury secretary, Timothy
Geithner.

On Dec. 24, I received a property tax bill from the City of NY. On the bill it
states " Increase of 7% in property taxes due to financial crisis." This is a
retroactive bill. I had paid my property taxes in full 6 months ago for the
entire year and now we find that the original bill has been retroactively
increased.

In 2005 my property taxes went up 18.5%. On the bill it stated that this
increase is a one time wartime tax and would be rescinded after the war. I
guess since we are perpetually at war somewhere, that increase has become
permanent. In addition to the massive 2005 increase, property taxes went up in
2006, 2007, and 2008, excluding the latest retroactive increase. Assessed home
values have never gone down. Paulson states we need to get home prices higher.
This reaks of idiocity to me. My thoughts are that we need to get home prices
lower so first time buyers can get into a market that has priced them out.

2 months ago Bloomberg rescinded an already legislated budgeted $400 property
tax rebate for the 5 burroughs of New York.

It appears the squeeze is on with 2 states already out of unemployment
insurance funds and 30 more states due to run out by March. I'm sure they will
be applying for Federal funds and bailouts.

If there is anyone who can get us into another great depression, I believe
Paulson is the man.

Thanks god for having restrictions on the property in CA (Prop. 13). If it
weren't for that I cannot image what property taxes would look like.

As far as Paulson is concerned he should have been fired with his draft for
TARP in September. His bailout benefits the large bank way more than Main
street. While I agree with equity infusions I would have gone with the English
model and voting shares at reasonable conditions for taxpayers, so the idiots
cannot run the asylum without supervision any longer. I wonder why nobody (not

Here in IN, there were large protests and nearly a tax revolt because the
property tax rose to 1.5% of assessed value in some cases.

There was an initiative to amend the state constitution to cap it at 1% and
exempt homesteads (owner occupied property), but many legislators, interest
groups, and lobbyists feared that this would limit their power, so they threw
in the kitchen sink to stop it.

The legislature capped the tax at 1% of assessed value without amending the

Spekulatius,

You were right about CRDN before and I was wrong. :)

Right now it is a "hold" for me and even that is tenuous. However, like you
say, it is very cheap, so I am not selling. I would not buy either though. I
bought some at $19 last time it was there. I sold some in July at $40 too, so
that's for damage control. ;)

OK, let's discuss company and not my investment in it. :) IMHO CRDN is in a
tough spot for now. Solar is mostly dead with oil price crash and I would
rather bet on oil rebound than to bet on solar recovery. CRDNs semi equip
company purchase also does not look good with semis dropping a lot. Aluminum
smelting business is still in the future with no assurance that it will ever
work out. Bull died. Army orders of XSAPI came in lower and are delayed by
competitor protests. It may be that rebids will be lower and some part of
contract lost.

On the other hand, like you say company is still profitable and the price is
cheap. That's why I am still holding. But I am not sure I would advise to buy
it right now.

Rebalanced my entire REIT portfolio of stocks to now include 60% preferred
shares and 40% common. Previously I owned only common shares. I was able to
lock in an average yield on the preferred shares of 22%. I averaged down on my
common share cost basis (took some short term losses where allowed) and moved
the proceeds into higher yielding preferred shares.

Many of these preferred shares have already had a significant move higher (ie.
BDN preferred C up 50% in last 30 days). The higher yield and safety of the
preferred shares is what attracts me. I think the market was not pricing these
preferred shares correctly and still believe many of these series of preferreds
are undervalued. I expect these yields will move significantly lower (back to
more normal historical levels) as both the common and preferred shares move
higher in price.

Many of these REITs are selling significantly below BV (even when analyzed from
2002 price levels). This industry is not without risk. A lot of these firms
have to rollover their debt in the next few years which could be at a
historical price spread to treasuries. Their cost of funds will be very high if
long term rates do not come down significantly in the next 36 months. Their
rental incomes could come under pressure with a continued slow down in the
economy. Therefore property (regional) locations and types (warehouse.
industrial, apartment) are important in your REIT property mix. I have stayed
away from all hotel and SFR REITs.

My strategy is on any recovery in the industry (maybe 2-3 years) peel off the
common shares and keep the preferred shares for income. My total exposure of
REITs to my taxable portfolio is quite small (about 2.5%) but their income
contribution component is HUGE about 4x my average portfolio dividend return
now around 5%.

Preferred dividend income is taxed like ordinary income (ie. interest income)
and does not receive the preferential treatment like qualified dividend income.
It's possible that with an Obama administration future qualified dividend
income (perhaps in FY2010) will be taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.
If this occurs, the difference in the tax rates on the preferred dividend
income and common dividend income should be zero (preferred dividend income is
now taxed about 10%-15% higher than qualified dividend income).

At this stage in the cycle, if the REITs can survive (there may be a period of
a few quarters of non-dividend payments on the common), the risk reward of
owning the preferred shares is quite attractive.

These companies seem to be attractive based on their BV, debt and cash flows.
EEQ has the least debt of the group and is selling about 30% below book. BBEP
has a lot more debt and selling at a 20% discount to EEQ. Legacy Reserves Lp
(LGCY) ( http://www.legacylp.com/about.cfm ) may be an interesting regional
play.

You could put together a small basket of these companies and net a 20%-25%
yield. There is excellent price appreciation potential too. EEQ may be the best
of the group for a long term hold.

I own LINE. Have you looked at APL or ATN of the Atlas family?
Just curious if you have an opinion on the MLP's.
So many are so cheap.
I have been beating my brains out trying to get a handle on APL. It has been
beaten down severe account company was whipped by the oil price spike. Removed
hedges at the market peak and did not replace as of 3rd Q conference call.
I think they learned a lesson. Only question would be will they make it intact
into the next profit cycle.
If they replaced the hedges in the small window they had I would say easy. I
somehow think they really dropped the ball.
ATN is a very good long term MLP.

EEQ, BBEP, LINE -
I am glad yyou like my pick. EEP/EEQ have some of the highest yield for
non-commodity sensitive long haul pipeline MLP's. LINE and BBEP are
fundamentally different - they are upstream MLP while EEQ/EEP is a pipeline
MLP. As a matter of principle, i do not invest in upstream MLP or income trust.
I believe those trust do not work with falling commodity prices mainly because
they do not retain enough cash flow to keep their reserves the same - so what
they do is issue new shares to make up for the shortfall. This works when
commodity and shares prices but in down markets it does not. if the bear market
last too long those MLP literally will run dry and be gone.

On the other hands when pipes are laid, they are going to throw off mostly
increasing (because of FERC tariff adjustments) cash flow for decades with
little reinvestment.

APL - no need to beat you brains out. They were mishedged (dirty hedges for
crude while they produce NGL) and got hit when oil went up Near the oil peak,
they removed all hedges and issued new units to pay out the counterparties.
Then oil went down down down. Now they are close to hitting their loan
covenants, have not hedges in place and NGL are even more so in the tank than
crude.

APL is simple mismanaged and it's not a buy imo. If you are looking or a
commodity sensitive NG Gather and processing play there are much better choices
out there (although any company in this field has margin problems)

Thanks for reply.

New WSJ article of interest.

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123050970366838291.html?mod=testMod

Steady expansion for pipeline companies is grinding to a halt as tight credit
makes it harder to raise construction money, potentially limiting their ability
to bring new supplies of natural gas to market.

U.S. gas-pipeline construction boomed in recent years as demand for natural-gas
grew and production shifted to new areas, such as north Texas and the Rocky
Mountains.

Pipeline demand has remained strong despite falling energy prices, but the
financial crisis has made it harder and more expensive for companies such as El
Paso Corp., Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP and others to raise cash to build
new conduits.

Canceled and scaled-back pipeline projects are bad news for natural-gas
consumers and producers, who now could face higher fees and limitations on how
much gas they can move from new production areas.

In October, Enterprise Products Partners LP cited high capital costs in
withdrawing from a project to build a 673-mile-long pipeline from Colorado to
North Dakota. El Paso recently said it was cutting its 2008 capital budget to
$3.5 billion from $3.8 billion and would spend just $3 billion on projects in
2009.

The retrenchment also spells trouble for pipeline companies' growth, which
depend on new projects. Analysts expect many of the smaller pipeline companies
to become takeover targets next year. "It truly is survival of the fittest,"
said Dan Rogers, an energy attorney at King & Spalding in Houston.

Some larger pipeline companies with less debt have been able to raise money in
recent weeks, but at sharply higher costs than a few months ago. El Paso this
month raised $500 million in 5-year notes paying 12%, interest after paying
just 7.25% in May for $600 million in 10-year notes.

Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP said last week it had raised $600
million through the sale of 11-year notes paying 9.7% interest. In March, it
sold 10-year notes for 6.7%.

The challenges for the pipeline industry are coming even though their profits
have been holding up better than other parts of the energy sector, said Mark
Easterbrook, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.

Pipeline companies make their money by charging fees to access their pipes.
Those fees are generally based on the volume of gas moving through the pipeline
and negotiated in advance, so pipeline revenue isn't directly tied to
commodities prices.

But while existing pipelines provide a steady source of revenue, new pipelines
are the source of companies' growth. Future projects are getting postponed or
scaled back. Last month, Regency Energy Partners LP said it would cut capacity
30% on a planned pipeline that would bring natural gas from a new field by
using smaller-sized pipe.

Pipeline companies depend on outside capital because many of them are
structured as master limited partnerships rather than corporations. Such
partnerships carry tax advantages that help improve returns. But the structure
also requires companies to return virtually all their cash flow to investors in
the form of quarterly distributions. That means long-term projects must be
funded by borrowing money or issuing equity.

"The [partnership] model in terms of growth really only works when you have a
healthy capital market," said Wachovia analyst Michael Blum. His firm
anticipates capital spending will drop roughly 25% across the industry next
year.

Stronger companies that have been able to raise new capital may turn to
acquisitions for growth. "There's probably less competition, and there will be
more acquisition opportunities," said Kinder Morgan President C. Park Shaper.

The pipeline construction slowdown comes despite the fact that pipeline demand
remains strong. Gas producers cut back on drilling as prices tumbled, but most
of the cuts have been in older fields that have plenty of pipeline capacity.
Newer fields in Louisiana, Arkansas and Pennsylvania are still growing rapidly
and may quickly outgrow their existing pipelines.

"The gas is now being produced in areas where no one contemplated production
before. The pipeline infrastructure does not exist in many of those areas,"
Energy Transfer Partners LP Chief Executive Kelcy Warren said.

Spekulatius,

Agree but I am speculating on an oil price increase relative to natural gas and
a return of the margin sometime in 2009.
Do you have much knowledge that you would care to share about the natural gas
processing and the hedges that protect the margin?
I have a couple of specific questions.

The Obama administration should consider making the pipeline build out part of
the infrastructure spending where it fit's their goals. For once thing it
probably won't cost a fortune - reducing the cost of debt to a reasonable value
with loan guarantees would probably do the job (the US government simply would
take advantage of their lower cost of funding and they even could make a decent
margin). This prevents critical bottlenecks later, is efficient to keep
construction jobs and pipeline manufacturing jobs and may help to improve he US
energy grid.

I don't think I am knowledgeable on hedging. I try to buy MLP's that don't need
hedging. I do know a fair amount NG processing. basically there are 3 sorts of
contracts POP (percentage of proceeds where the NG processor is paid a
percentage of he NG throughput), fixed fee and Keep whole (processor keeps all
the liquids but reimburses the producer with NG to keep energy content the
same) and percentage of liquids contracts. All those require different hedging
strategies (execept fee based which does not require hedging at all)

At current prices for Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR) their giving you their
ocean shipping and passenger business for free and your buying their river
business and offshore supply business at a discount. 43% of their revenue is
now derived from their river business which is expected to grow 9% per year
(for several years as they double the number of their barges in service by
2010). They have two 12 year credit facilities (totaling $60 million) to
finance their growth in their river & offshore supply business. ULTR only has
30 million shares outstanding and have repurchased 2.5 million shares last
quarter and still have $35 million remaining in their current repurchase
program ( http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/081002/151499.html ). Look for the company to
step up their share buy back especially at these depressed levels.

The company is quite profitable and should earn $1.35/share in 2009 which
reflects a 2.2 PE.

I have 1.5% of the portfolio in this stock with my last buy around $2.50/share.
I am still underwater and will probably average down on a few more shares early
next year. Company pays no dividend but has the potential to be a five bagger
(reversion to their mean 2006-2008 price levels).

I spent quite some time reviewing this company with a skeptical bent.
I looked at the website as well as the lengthy 20f filed with the SEC. I will
follow it and root for the value thread holders but Im not going to buy it for
the following reasons:

I fear that in this type of company management interests are not sufficiently
aligned with those of other shareholders. This is backed by the lack of
dividends, the cashing out of share in the follow on offering, and the lack of
significant purchase of shares at what appear to bargain basement prices. I
also note that there appear to be 2 classes of shares as the 20f mentions
management as having some 14% of the beneficial interest but over 42% of the
voting control. I havent seen too many of these situations resolve themselves
favorably for investors. The shipping field is also rife with insider
transactions which tend to to benefit the insiders at the expense of other
shareholders, The bahamian registration doesnt promote much confidence that
minority shareholders will any avenue to address wrongdoings either. Lastly the
cash on the balance sheet could be very deceiving. it represents the company on
a consolidated basis but the cash may well be stuck in operating entities that
have no means of getting it back to the holding company because of fx or other
restrictions.

Madharry - good points regarding ULTR. I am also a bit skeptical. I found
several things that I did not like:
1) They put a positive spin on drawing down the credit line. Usually that is
considered a last resort.
2) The river barge business (which is what attracted me to ULTR initially)
generates only a small part of ULTR earnings, yet they invest large amounts of
capital in it.
3) Lot's of offshore vessels contracts are going to expire in Summer 2009.

Started a position in ENBRIDGE ENERGY MGMT (NYSE: EEQ) to add to my other gas
distribution companies. I have about 6.5% of the portfolio allocated to this
sector.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=EEQ,TRP,UGI,EP,SRE,SE&d=s

My strategy is to build up my EEQ holdings to represent a 2.5% position in the
portfolio which should bring my sector weighting to around 8%.

EEQ also trades options so I am looking at possibly writing some covered calls
and selling some out of the money naked Puts to generate income and lock in a
lower average cost basis.

=========================================================

Also added a few more shares of PENN WEST ENERGY TRU (NYSE: PWE). The company
is selling near its all time lows. The company recently reduced their payout to
$0.28/month which still yields over 30% at the current rate. The dividend could
be cut another 25% to $0.21/month if oil stays in the $35/barrel range. That
would still yield a whopping 20%.

Todays purchase brought my Oil & NG portfolio sector weighting to 30%. This is
my largest sector weighting in the portfolio.

These are the Oil and NG companies I presently hold:

You may be right that GOOG is a buy here. However, every way I look, the stock
is not cheap. With 18% ROE the expected return is about 11% annual which is
very low in this market and not a buy even in a bull market. Heh, Pepsi and
Coke have expected returns higher than GOOG. Even assuming 20% growth and 20PE
the return is only about 28% going forward, which is again very low in this
market. Even accounting for cash on balance sheet, the earnings yield is very
low compared to anything else.

GOOG. Well, I have my ways of looking at things. So far, I've been very wrong
about GOOG (and lots of others). That's maybe partly because my methodology
might be wrong. Or inapplicable: If people don't want stocks or aren't willing
to pay what they previously were willing to pay because of fear or changing
economic conditions, there's nothing that can be done for it.

That said, I don't understand your analysis, what you mean by "return". "With
18% ROE the expected return is about 11% annual which is very low in this
market and not a buy even in a bull market."
I'm not understanding how 11% is derived from 18% roe. If GOOG has an 18% roe
and book value is $87.29/sh., then the company should earn $15.70/sh. based on
that book. 15.70/309. = 5%.

"Even assuming 20% growth and 20PE the return is only about 28% going forward,
which is again very low in this market." If I could assume a 20 p/e and if I
assume analyst earnings estimate average of $21.50/sh. (Yahoo figure), then I
get a stock price somewhere around $430 in 2009. That won't make my overall bet
on GOOG profitable (I've bought at much higher prices than currently), but for
any buys now at $309, that would still be a 121/309 = 39% gain within 12
months. If it could happen, for me, imo, that's not "too low in this market".

I use several methods making value judgments, and not all of them are in
agreement. Since I am generally looking for ways to include stocks, I don't
always require that all methods be in agreement before I make a purchase. For
GOOG, my focus is on profit margins. What am I willing to pay for a company
with growing sales that has had net profit margins over 20% in each the past
few years? Net profit margins that are higher than KO (but less consistent). I
am willing to pay more for a company like GOOG that keeps about 1/4 of every
revenue dollar to the bottom line than I am for companies that don't have sales
growth and aren't able to have such good profit margins. How much more?-- I use
a formula which relates the profit margins to stock price and other metrics
which quantifies this for me.

Aside from the macroeconomic and psychological issues of most every asset class
being decimated in this year's market crash, the stock-specific issue raised by
Spekulatius would be my concern, namely -- his point that it may be very
dangerous to assume that either sales growth will continue or that profit
margins can continue to be where they are. (Competition not being dead, and the
"moat" may not be as big as past years have indicated.) In most of my posts
relating to my buying GOOG, I have so stated this, namely that I find GOOG a
value buy IF profit margins hold.

This all just how I am viewing GOOG and what I am doing. If others don't
believe the reward justifies a purchase or the risk is too great or too
indeterminable, then it's a pass and on to the next stock for consideration

Paul,

"I'm not understanding how 11% is derived from 18% roe."

I use Mike Burry's Buffettology spreadsheet for this, which extrapolates 10
year earnings based on 18% ROE and assumes terminal 15 PE and calculates the
return rate after tax backwards.

"but for any buys now at $309, that would still be a 121/309 = 39% gain within
12 months. If it could happen, for me, imo, that's not "too low in this
market""

No, it is. Most stocks I hold are expected to return from 2X to 3X current
price in 12 months. Sure, they probably won't but expectation of 39% gain is
way too low except for very conservative stocks. And BTW I use historical
earnings not "analyst earnings estimate", so I get more conservative result.

My question would be: why buy GOOG instead of KO or PEP. But your answer will
be that you buy both or you are "looking for ways to include stocks". Which
makes very hard to have any reasonable discussion. Sorry. :/

I would not like to end the year with a negative post, but I will. :) This is
not aimed at anyone specifically and it is a rant, so skip it if you don't want
to get depressed. ;)

I must say that I find the value of this thread diminishing. I still like it
and other threads in SI for investment ideas. However, I find it - and other
threads, to be fair - not very useful for discussions on specific companies as
investments. In most cases if someone posts a stock, there are either no
replies or off-the-cuff response with issues that can be found by reading five
news articles on Yahoo + company press releases. IMHO these do not add much to
discussion. I don't see anyone doing in-depth analysis of any company. I
understand when Paul does not do it - he owns everything and a kitchen sink, so
he just cannot investigate some company down to details, but I don't see anyone
else doing it either. I am guilty of this too - my first answer to Paul about
GOOG is another example of dismissing the stock without a lot of additional
insight. Of course, then Paul dismisses me without saying much either and we
both go on our merry ways not much wiser... ;)

I also understand that we all are using different valuation principles, so it
would be hard to reach consensus. Still it would be interesting, at least for
me.

Lack of discussion about specific companies IMHO diminishes the utility of the
thread. I find myself not posting new buys and ideas, since I am pretty sure
that I won't get any answers that would delve into them. I don't think I
remember an in-depth analysis of any pick recently, but maybe I just forget.

It is also possible that most of the people on the thread are Grahamites, who
pretty much buy on valuation and do not spend hours or days on learning
everything that is possible about the company like Buffett would.

Anyway, good luck with your investments in 2009! Happy New Year! :)

I would hazard a guess that one of the reasons there is less robust discussion
is that a significant percent of the population of the thread is weary, gunshy,
and tapped out emotionally and in $$$$ terms. I fall into that camp.
Additionally, a lot of the standard value metrics have been pretty useless in a
market like that of late '08.

I think we did not have much in depth discussions because the market

a) conditions were not favoring a value based approach
b) market was moving extremely fast
c) fundamentals have shifted so much that backwards looking numbers seem almost
useless
d) thread participants emotional worn out and frustrated (Wallaces answer)

You can count me in as a person who gravitated away from he typical value
approach because I am trying to look more into the macro picture and maybe
because of that my answers have been less useful than they used to be. However
overall we still have decent discussions - Madharry's reply on ULTR was a
decent analysis, IMO.

I just tallied up my sorry results for the year. I will have to double my
portfolio this year to break even. It turned out I had too much money in O&G
and commodities, some poor specific choices didnt help either. It could have
been worse. I could have been on margin and been wiped out, or I could have
done some close friends a favor and helped manage their money to results like

I am down 21% this year in my main IRA account. Trading and holding cash has
helped quite a bit. My 410k account with limited choices is far worse.

I am very incertain about the next year it could be a good investment year or
an very bad one. The economy is going to be far worse than any of us (at least
for me my span dates back to 1982) has seen, I fear. I think the credit markets
are slowly unthawing, at least for some better credits. Financials are probably
the iffiest prospects - on one hand we have low interest rates but on the other
hand we have a economy that has fallen off the cliff and while the subprime
loans have to been written off (I think) a new batch of subprime is created
every time the housing prices go down or a retailer goes out of business. I
would not be surprised if banks would essentially get nationalized in the US.

I think the current calm period with reduced volatility will end very soon.
Maybe that is already an off topic rant here but I am gravitating away from a
pure value approach and try to include the market psychology as well as the
macro picture in my investment approach.

ESRX - my limit order hit later yesterday at 54.7$. this is not a traditional
value stock but a GARP pick. 17.5 trailing PE and 15.2 forward PE based on
estimated Y2009 numbers. I like it because
a) Growth is seemingly not dependent on economy
b) macro (cost savings , generics penetration, Obamacare (?)) may favor benefit
providers
c) personal experience (companies providing healthcare pushing use of benefit
providers)

Any opinions on that one. I think it's a better pick than Google at his
conjuncture because for GOOG I see several headwinds (online spending, market
share maxed out & pot. for disruptive competition (MSFT's Live/cashback).

fwiw I had a discussion with a friend about what he was looking into buying for
2009 and one of his ideas was to anticipate what the large mutual funds would
be buying when they were convinced it was time to commit more funds to the
market. He came up with Microsoft and I told him that I thought Google would be
a much more likely stock for funds to buy once they started anticipated and
upcycle in the economy. Seems to me Google has a pretty strong moat and should
benefit more than most from a stronger economy.Of course I dont own it.

GOOG - supposedly GOOG is a growth stock in any economy but I think might be
seeing the end of GOOG outperformance where macro pressures are having an
effect on search. in addition to the law of large numbers.

FWIW I recently bought a little IACI. They are aan also run in search but have
some internet business that seem valuable (Match, Citisearch, Servicemagic).
The nice thing about IACI is that they recently spun off 3 companies (that
subsequently tanked) and got rid of the debt. They had 1.3B$ net cash after the
spinoff and get about 400M$ (net of tax) more from the sale of the Japanese TV
shopping business for a total of 1.6B$ net cash which is 73% of IACI market
cap.

Of course having Diller as a CEO does deserve a discount but the current
valuation net of cash is ridiculous, IMO. FWIW, recent weakness is attributed
to Malone selling out.

ESRX: I can't warm to this one. I don't see the attraction, and I don't have an
objective way to evaluate the thing other than as a value stock. (Which it does
not seem to me to be)

Okay, it's a gaarp stock -- it still to me seems expensive based on how many
other good stocks are available at p/e under 15. And from what I can
understand, it's not like ESRX has great market share or proprietary products
or even a dividend.

S&P likes it though. Predicting higher earnings for '09, ESRX one of their top
picks (5 stars). So who knows.

For me, in the health care arena, I'd rather be adding to my COV position.
(Which I am trying to do if price will fall a little.)

If I can be alert enough, and if ESRX moves up a couple of more points, I might
consider a paired trade -- shorting ESRX and buying more of the healthcare/pbm
companies that look better priced to me on their valuations.

RE IACI - I do agree on Diller being a liability, although I do think he got a
little more religion recently. However that said I reiterate that IACI is dirt
cheap by many metrics - if you take the cash into account. In this environment
it should be possible to put the cash to work with decent results. We will see,
i am going to keep this position reasonable small (so far it's a starter
position only).

Insurance companies are different and cary way more risk. CVS Caremark is

ESRX. Yes, earnings estimates for a large number of stocks may be coming down,
so ESRX p/e of 15 might be decent. Analysts seem confident of ESRX's earnings.

I'm following a bunch of health care stocks. Where there are Yahoo estimates,
only one has forward p/e as high as 15. If the estimate p/e for ESRX is found
to be correct, I'd like to believe that at least some of the stocks that I'm
involved with will hold up with their estimated p/e's too.

Lot of correlation in the sector. For example this year even with COV and ESRX:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1y&s=ESRX&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=cov

If this correlation continues -- it might or might not - then if ESRX does
okay, I'll be okay with COV's performance too then.

Different ideas/approaches. For me, here, I'd rather try to up my COV position
than start anew with ESRX.

COV is a good one that I missed - My GTC limit order was too low. FWIW health
care is not immune. Hospitals are under tremendous pressure due to more
uninsured patient etc. In the last Baron, one analyst mentioned SYK and
particularly HRC (Hill Rom) as shorts, since he believes that hospital beds are
a non-critical item for hospitals and such they can reduce Capex substantially
without too much impact. HRC is a spinoff that I am following as a pot. buy but
I got more careful after reading this article.

CAH could be impacted too but to a much lesser effect - a lot of their business
are consumables. MCK should be OK. All of those are single digit growers while
ESRX and peers are double digit growers and such deserve a premium.

Earnings and outlook for next quarter will be a big test for the bulls. i think
they are way too high overall. Financials are a wildcard - my guess is as a
group they loose money in Y2009. Some weaker players like C probably won't make
it and will be nationalized.

I am soliciting input for short plays ideas for Y2009. Some stuff I am tossing
out:

SPG (51.5$) - Mall giant with a still rich valuation. Decently financed but FFO
will see headwinds for a couple of years. Increased cost of funding. Value of
real estate portfolio may shrink such that debt is 70% of EV.

HDB (76.7$)- Indian bank trading at 19x forward earnings. RE boom in India is
popping and banks like HDB will be left holding the bag. FWIW i read about a
year ago that RE in Mumbai was just as expensive as in western capitals like
Paris, London by some measures. the recent attacks will not help either.

TBT (39$)- ETF short play on treasuries.Inflation worries or worries about high
debt load will cause a rise in yield for treasuries.

XOM (81.6$) - too expensive for 40$ crude. Use as a hedge to balance out long
position in cheaper oil stocks.

Speaking for myself, I have remained fully invested throughout this downturn.
Many of my stock could certainly be multibaggers,
and I am very reluctant to put money in foreign entities at this juncture,
where I am unfamiliar with the accounting quality, so Im not going to spend any
time researching these companies let alone spend the time to learn everything I
can about a company when I have virtually no free cash to invest. I already own
some china plays, mfcaf and melco intl, that have been beaten down pretty good.
One stock that i do find intriguing and will spend some time researching is HUN
so if anyone has done some work on that one Im interested in hearing about it
no matter how superficial it may be. Perhaps some of these failed buyout at
much higher prices will yield tremendous returns over time to those with funds
to invest.

HUN -
yes I brought it up recently. I own a tiny bit. Problem is that I expect the
next earnings to be horrible. Still the market cap is so low compared to cash
inflow from the settlement plus they have a god shot at getting more from the
banks involved in the financing of the deal that never took place, IMO. No
other takers so far. I think about adding a little on weakness. I agree on
multibagger potential.

HUN is a situation where it might be helpful to see a research report from a
chemical industry analyst who can comment on the business prospects of the
company. There might be a good reason why the stock is selling where it is but
this is yet another business I know nothing about. Of course none of the
experts in the oil business predicted oil going below $70 a barrel so maybe
ignorance is bliss.

re HUN - not sure a report would help that much. HUN is a mediocre company and
overleveraged as well. But is is arguable dirt cheap. The cash influx from the
settlement should keep them afloat. HUN does not do the very basic chemicals
any more (they sold this business in 2007) otherwise they would be hurting
more.

The only datapoint we have from "experts" is that insiders have been strong
buyers in the 3$ range after the settlement.

OT. Short plays. I looked around in the past hour and I don't see many
companies with both expectations of lousy business in '09 yet still with high
stock price. Here are some ideas I've come up with.

XOM. A trading short. Maybe paired with a buy on a lower p/e oil service stock.
At current $81 price, I'm out of XOM. Maybe a reenter ten points lower. I could
consider a small short at current price.

BBBY. Have taken my lumps on this one recently. Still might be overpriced given
housing slump and consumer cutbacks. No ltd and the main competitor has already
folded (bk), so BBBY will be around for a while. But in '09, the stock may have
recovered too much now, and could drop back. I might consider a small short at
current price.

DOW. Dow is the second largest chemical manufacturer in the world (after BASF).
Have taken my lumps on DOW now too. Drat -- So much for what I believed was a
long-term holding.
It seems to me management has really put this good company in jeopardy by tying
DOW to an apparently ironclad expensive purchase of Rohm and Haas while leaving
DOW exposed to another deal with Kuwait which was supposed to provide funding
for the R&H purchase. The Kuwaitis passed, and now DOW is in a predicament.
Enough so, that I expect the generous DOW dividend could be cut. Stock is down,
but maybe not down enough to reflect the negative headlines that will be
generated as this thing works itself out. Could still be a trading short. (DOW
bod might fire the ceo; that could pop the stock. I do not know.)

The above reflect some of my biases. I've sold these stocks, and once in a
while I get the feeling with such like the above, that if I'm not willing to
own the stocks at their relatively high prices or in their scary circumstances,
maybe I should keep going and after selling, turn around and short some shares.
OTOH, as I sometimes post here, if I can't hold on and finally give up on the
stock(s), maybe that's a sign the bottom is near, and people might want to
consider using my sell as an indicator that they might want to consider the
stock(s) as a buy candidate.
