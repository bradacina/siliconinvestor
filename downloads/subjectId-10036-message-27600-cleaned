I don't blame anyone for bailing. Someone is puking out lots of shares and that
generally portends bad things as the technicians will graciously tell us. It
could just be a very effective bear raid and margin selling, but RAS is not
acting the way a normal stock should in these circumstances.

I think no matter how it turns out you played it by the book, and I get style
points deducted. But they're starting to piss me off now. Don't let me buy any
more for at least a one week cooling off period <g>.

UNH - I also bought some shares today. i like your idea to buy into something
that may not be affected by the current malaise.

I own HPT, a hotel REIT with a good yield (7.8%) right now. I also bought back
some SNH which i sold after the recent spike. SNH's yield is 7.4%. SNH has very
little debt and the debt of HPT is fairly moderate for a Hotel REIT.

I purchased more LM at a little more than 86$. I think they are the cheapest
asset manager around,based on PE and EV/ assets under management, but who like
asset managers when the market tanks?

company for not disclosing more information on credits that until now have been
keeping their payments current. I am holding onto all my shares. They contend
they have sufficiently liquidity to ride out these storms. Certainly if
builders start going bankrupt, ras may not survive either but i think its a

the only borrower which is not current on payments. Perhaps Im in denial but I

Banking on a strong recovery
Stock Spotlight: Major bank stocks have been socked by credit market problems.
But analysts believe some banks have been unfairly punished.
http://money.cnn.com/2007/08/03/markets/spotlight_banking_stocks/index.htm?sour
e=yahoo_quote

From the article:"...Regional banks that lack exposure to investment banking
have been getting whacked by investors as well though. Firms like Washington
Mutual (Charts, Fortune 500) and Wells Fargo (Charts, Fortune 500) both have
extensive home loan operations that are susceptible to the problems in the
subprime market.

Mortgage banker Countrywide slashed its 2007 outlook last month on fears that
the real estate market won't see a complete recovery for two more years.

Wells Fargo could potentially lose money on its big exposure to the home equity
loan market, which constitutes 22 percent of its total loans, said Morningstar
analyst Ganesh Rathnam.

But even though Washington Mutual's home loan department posted a $37 million
loss in the second quarter, which ended in June, it still reported an 8 percent
earnings increase overall.

That's because the company's management saw the subprime mess coming and sold
much of its high-risk portfolio in 2006. It also tightened its lending
standards...."

======================================================

It looks as though WM sold much of its high-risk portfolio in 2006 to the hedge
funds. Perhaps they dodged a bullet and were lucky with their timing. The stock
appears to me to be at a value price especially when you consider the 6%
dividend.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on RAS.

I reviewed the earnings release again (unfortunately it appears the 10Q is not
available yet):
Total Assets: 14.0B (excluding goodwill because let's face it there is no
goodwill in the real estate business these days)
Total Liabilities: 12.7 billion

Assets minus liabilities: 1.3 billion
Company estimate of possible write down: $278 million
Fick estimate of possible writedown: $538 million
Preferred shares shareholder equity: $165 million
http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070803/rait_financial_mover.html?.v=1

Tangible common book value: $600 million to $867 million

With 60 million shares out TBV should be $10 - $14.50 per share. But if you
mark the assets to market value at the height of a mortgage securities crisis,
who knows?

Still I think a sane (value) investor could justify a small position here once
it shows some signs of stabilizing. Last week when the preferred traded at a
small premium to the common I would have favored the preferred but if you can
get the common at 50% of the RAS-A, I think the common may be the better buy.

Comments welcomed.

Kenneth,

RAS is pure trouble. They have repo lines to worry about, toxic tranches on its
b/s that they can't leverage, exposure to home builders and REIT's and the CDO
market for them is shut. RAS owns the AHM trust preferreds and may have some
trust preferreds with small home builders that may go b/k. This could cause
problems because they trust preferreds are financed by an on balance sheet CDO.

Assets: $13.5 billion
Liabilities: $11.9 billion
Equity $1.5 billion ($1.3 billion tangible)
Debt/Equity: 8:1

$4.7 billion of assets are TruPS & Subordinated debt that is 23% commercial
mortgage, 16% home builders, 18% residential mortgage and 16% specialty
finance. These assets are 25% AAA, 7% AA, 27% A. 37% BBB and 3% BB or less.
Included in this segment is a direct investment in a subprime lender, some
subprime MBS and entities that traffic in subprime mortgages. Investors have to
be giving this a huge haircut. They put the REIT and real estate development
assets into one particular on-b/s CDO, Taberna VIII, with $772 million of
investments, to which they hold the bottom $221 million tranches.

On their debt, the biggest concern is their $2.0 billion of repo agreements.
(That's one of the things that hurt AHM, namely they got a margin call on the
private label AAA-rated RMBS that they had repo'ed.) This does NOT include $1.4
billion of OFF balance sheet warehouse lines split evenly between Merrill and
Bear Stearns. Merrill and Bear hold the warehouse lines and put investments in
them. RAS puts up some collateral and receives the interest spread between the
investments and the warehouse line rates. RAS acts as the securitizer
(something like FMD or UNCL). However, if they can't launch a CDO by maturity
of the warehouse lines, and the investments are sold at a loss, the first loss
comes out of their collateral. They don't specify how much collateral is at
risk or what happens if the collateral requirement is increased. If these
warehouse lines were pulled or not used, they lose additional income.

The Bear Stearns warehouse is particularly a concern because Bear held the
largest credit facility at AHM. Bear Stearns looks to have been the marginal
lender to the marginal mortgage originator who made marginal mortgages to
marginal borrowers. Then they securitized said mortgages, with their internal
hedge funds buying the marginal (a.k.a. below AAA) tranches of the
securitizations.

There is a panic in the capital markets and RAS can't securitize anything right
now, which makes the purchase of Taberna at peak values look stupid. RAS also
has depended upon CDO securitization fees to fund operations and pay the
dividend.

As Wes Edens said last week, "...truly the number one cause of death in these
volatile markets is the lack of liquidity and financing..."

American Capital 2Q Earnings Rise
Wednesday August 1, 9:54 am ET

American Capital Strategies 2nd-Quarter Earnings Rise on Portfolio Appreciation
BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- American Capital Strategies Ltd., an alternative asset
management company, said late Tuesday its second-quarter earnings nearly
tripled from the year-ago quarter due to a jump in unrealized appreciation of
its portfolio.

Second-quarter earnings rose to $788 million, or $1.42 per share, from $290
million, or 97 cents per share during the same period a year ago.

During the second quarter, American Capital Strategies recorded an unrealized
gain from its portfolio investments of $549 million. About $493 million of the
appreciation came from the deconsolidation of its European capital management
company.

Removing the portfolio appreciation from the second quarter and the year-ago
quarter, American Capital Strategies' earnings per share from operating income
rose to 91 cents per share, up from 81 cents per share during the second
quarter of 2006.

Analysts polled by Thomson Financial, on average, forecast earnings of 78 cents
per share for the second quarter. Analysts do not always include unrealized
gains from portfolio appreciation.

Net operating income rose 40 percent to $153 million from $109 million due to
growth in interest, dividends and fee income.

Shares of American Capital Strategies fell $1.13, or 3 percent, to $39.63.

LUM reaffirmed their dividend ONE WEEK AGO and said they had plenty of
liquidity.

Today, LUM announced today that, since August 3, 2007, the mortgage industry,
and the financing methods that the mortgage industry relies upon, have
deteriorated significantly and in an unprecedented fashion. Effectively, the
secondary market for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities has
seized-up. As a result, Luminent is simultaneously experiencing a significant
increase in margin calls on its highest quality assets and a decrease on the
financing advance rates provided by its lenders.
In a Board of Directors meeting today, Luminent's Board unanimously voted to
take the following actions:

-- The Board of Directors suspended payment of Luminent's second quarter
cash dividend of 32 cents per share on Luminent's common stock.
-- The Board of Directors extended the maturity of the outstanding
commercial paper issued by Luminent Star Funding Trust I, a special
purpose subsidiary of Luminent, by 110 days.
-- The Board of Directors cancelled Luminent's second quarter 2007
earnings release conference call, scheduled for Thursday, August 9,
2007, at 10:00 a.m. PDT, to discuss its second quarter of 2007 results
of operations.
-- The Board of Directors delayed the filing of Luminent's quarterly
report on form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2007. Luminent's second
quarter of 2007 unaudited condensed financial information is attached
to this press release. Luminent's independent registered public
accounting firm has not completed a review of the financial information
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007.
-- The Board of Directors authorized Luminent's senior management to
inform the New York Stock Exchange of these unfolding events and, as a
result, trading was halted in Luminent's common stock.

The Board of Directors currently is considering the full range of strategic
alternatives to enhance Luminent's liquidity and preserve shareholder value
during this period of market volatility.

dividends that would be required to offset the interest costs of financing them

well in excess of the financing costs or they would not be able to pay

EKS,

I do not profess to be an expert on RAS' assets. My familiarity with the
industry was a by-product of taking lumps to the head in buying AHM. As Homer
says: "Dohhhhh!" Analyzing what went wrong in AHM, though, is helping me to
sort through the carnage going on.

RAS is complicated, which is part and parcel with any Cohen family company
(REXI, AFN, TBBK). In many ways, these specialty REIT's require trusting
management as to knowing what they are doing. However, before you really delve
into that, you have to get comfortable with the capital structure.

This panic is about short-term financing. 60% of AHM's financing was on
short-term financing: repo's, warehouse lines and commercial paper. LUM's
short-term financing was around 45% of debt. A number of REIT's bought
AAA-rated RMBS using repo agreements, but most of it was private label, not
agency (Freddie, Fannie, Ginnie). In normal markets, this is a great spread
trade. Problem is that the unexpected happened and the spreads widened on
private label RMBS. This caused the mark-to-market write-downs on the
underlying assets, so the repo lenders upped the margin requirement, a.k.a. the
haircut. The warehouse lenders started raising the margin requirements for any
mortgage loans held that were non-agency conforming, like Alt-A, as well as
lower-rated MBS, particularly those backed by subprime and Alt-A loans. The
write-down in assets may have also triggered minimum net worth covenants in the
credit facilities. This is a long-winded way of saying that the first thing
that you should check on any potential REIT investment in this market is how
much short-term financing they have.

Another concern with leverage relates to CDO's, particularly those backed by
MBS, which are sometimes called CDO-squared. When they securitize lower-rated
MBS and hold the equity tranches, there is massive leverage masked in something
called an equity.

With the capital markets closed and lenders in retreat, it is important to
determine how much borrowing capacity a REIT has. Capital preservation is key
here to surviving, and the survivors will have some capital flexibility.

If you can get comfortable with the liability side of the balance sheet, then
take a look at the assets.

I am not going to recommend any REIT's here. My view is slightly different from
yours, in that there are vulture investors out there who are going to profit
from buying those toxic MBS that are being force-sold due to margin calls.
Plus, I am not sure whether we have bottomed yet. I would recommend listening
to the NCT earnings call from last week, and maybe listening to the RWT call
coming up on Wednesday.

me to be a conflict of interest when members of the board are buying shares
privately prior to the company purchasing or not purchasing shares. If the

Hi Jhelmers - I briefly reviewed both NCT and RWT from both a risk reward and
value opportunity and my take away is to stay away from these investment
classes. Even with the higher potential dividend yield, the risk is too large
(at this point in the cycle) that some or all of their loan types are over
valued, secured in a creative fashion, utilize too much leverage which could be
subject to potential "call provisions" or margin calls.

Furthermore in the current environment "industry" liquidity has dried up so any
margin call or loan call provision demand could trigger a company failure and
possible BK filing. It's just not possible to unwind many of these deals in a
fast or profitable manner. The big banks and hedge funds have stopped
transacting business in these loan products, so there is zero liquidity even if
you wanted to sell at a loss.

I think the value proposition is in buying the large money banks or selective
regional banks that have sold down with the rest of the financial sector.

I have been buying WM between $32.50 and $34 over the last few days and plan to
hold 18 to 24 months. With a 6% dividend (if they continue to pay that) it is
almost equivalent to many of these REITs with much less risk and more long term
growth prospects.

Thank you for your detailed description of how many of these loan products are
packaged and traded. I now have a better idea of what a traunch is. These REITs
use several of these special entity "asset" classes which just do not fit my
definition of a conservative value investment. Perhaps when the over all real
estate cycle is on the upswing again a small REIT equity position would
complement my portfolio. It would have to be very early in the cycle.

I am going to stick to more traditional value investments and pass (for now)
with these REITs.

Area51,

My apologies, as I was using 3/31 data. Yes they reduced the repo debt to
manageable levels. So the focus goes to their assets and to their revenue
generation.

For instance, the CDO market is currently closed. Will it re-open? Yes, but I
don't know when. The chairman of the board at NCT thinks it will be closed
between 6 to 18 months. You have any ideas? RAS earns fees for CDO
securitizations. GAAP requires them to amortize those fees over time but RAS
receives the fees up front and thus is taxable REIT income. In 2nd quarter,
GAAP showed $1,683,000 of fee income and Schedule II of the press release shows
$14,986,000 of deferred fee income. Of their $53.4 million of adjusted
earnings, $16.7 million came from CDO securitizations. That's about 1/3 of
taxable REIT income.

On the asset side, the biggest concern is Taberna Preferred Funding VIII, which
is a CDO they launched this past March in which the bundled all the REIT and
home builder TruPS. This is where they are taking the $95 million hit for AHM.
So much for their record of only having $6,000 of cash write-offs. There is
concern about exposure to another bankruptcy here. Unfortunately, this is a
black box. I thought the short who was on their last earnings call played dirty
by asking a question on this CDO and metnioning specific names, knowing full
well RAS operates under a client confidentiality agreement. I have no way to
handicap this.

Taberna in general is a concern. It was started in 2005 and run by Daniel
Cohen. They were supposed to IPO the company in 2005 but could not get it
launched. They went from $0 in assets to $7 billion by 12/31/05 and over $10
billion by the time they merged with RAIT on 12/31/06. By comparison, RAIT had
a little over $1 billion in assets. Over 90% of the assets were acquired during
the last two years, during a real estate bubble. The question is how much they
will have to mark to market the securities held for sale. Since RAS owns most
of the equity tranches of the CDO's, the marks to value may be minimal. This
will make a great boogeyman for the shorts on the next earnings call. Having
owned RAS in the past, I know that Betsy has a good track record. Daniel is an
unknown.

The insider buying was positive, although only Daniel and his mom were big
buyers. Daniel's shares were bought by his personal company, Cohen & Co. Betsy
bought the shares from an IRA.

As for a chemical analysis, I do not know what that is, so feel free to expound
about it.

RAS could buy back stock here but I suspect they won't. In a liquidity crisis,
cash is king.

Take a look at TQNT. In my view, kinda similar position in the cycle as ADPT +
a comfortable cash cushion. I'm a long-time AMAT investor (I usually take large
position in the teens and sell off bits after it runs). The current run in AMAT
took me by surprise, as I wasn't expecting an upturn for at least another year
or two. May be portending interesting things for some of the smaller semis

Took a very small position in LUM today. Near as I can tell, price-to-book is
now down to about 0.1. Unlike AHM, they do not originate loans, and credit
profile doesn't look that bad. Given risk/reward, thought it was a reasonable
investment, although as I said, I took a very small position given the current
turmoil.

Still looking at LEND, but can't figure out their outlook at this time.

Thanks for the reply jhelmers.

I was just jerking your chain about the "pure trouble" remark. In this day and
age it seems that many are prone to hyperbole, especially when that hyperbole
may enhance their market position. Disregard the chemical analysis of the
purity of the trouble <g>.

It's my opinion that RAS should be a survivor, but I certainly can't guarantee
that and there are certainly forces both supporting and opposing that goal. It
seems they're default rates are rather low, they have some diversification of
business, and the insider buys show that those that know the business best
remain confident. TBV should remain well above $10 even assuming fairly worst
case conditions in my opinion. Eventually markets should normalize, and
earnings can get back to previous estimate levels. But we don't need $3 per
share in earnings to justify a $10 stock price in my opinion.

I agree that they should shelve the buy-back plan until conditions stabilize.
If they survive they have lots of upside, so survival needs to be job one. I'll
keep playing pullbacks to 6 and selling above 8 while keeping a core position.
At least not all the volatility is to the downside the last few trading days.

After what happened with AHM and how conditions deteriorated in a period of
DAYS for LUM, I have to think the likelyhood of bankruptcy is high.

Or, in the best case scenario, they have to issue dilutive shares or expensive
and dilutive convertable debt in order to get through the crisis.

That being said, I continue to see insider buying in TMA as well as RAS. (I
dont own either)

With what happend with AHM & CBF, Im a bit scared. Which may mean its a good

I reduced my exposure to RAS. basically selling all the shares i bought sub

repurchase authorization is for show only. thus the long term share price will
be a function of company survival, and the restoring of liquidity for the
company's basic business, so the the company's primary concern is cash
conservation. Perhaps in 3 years the stock will be in the 20s again, but

Hi Madharry - I can not figure out WON but have not totally given up either. I
originally liked the company because of their ability to generate free flow
cash flow but this is down due to the industry downturn in advertizing
revenues. Perhaps the overall business model has flipped upside down with a lot
of the new revenues migrating to the Internet. WON does not have any
significant "hard assets" but the value is (or was) in their franchise. Over
the time period I have owned it several positive events have occurred (1) a new
non-exclusive contract with CBS, (2) new management team and (3) the board
evaluating the sale of the company.

I have an average cost of $7.00 and today averaged down with shares so my new
cost is around $5.00. I believe eventually the company will be sold and
integrated with a larger organization that needs their syndication franchise.
The company is still working on developing new sources of ad revenue other than
radio but this is a work in progress. The real value and money generator is
their radio syndication business. This has been much slower to turn around than
I expected.

I guess I am a bit less bullish than I was 24 months ago but am more positive
that some resolution will happen sooner than later. My exit strategy is to
establish my new positions today , hear management's discussion and progress on
their business on tomorrow's earnings report, see if the board and their
investment banker found any interested buyer(s) and if no new developments, I
will probably slowly exit my positions with a small loss.

Luckily, I have significant gains in a few shipping stocks (DRYs & SFL) which I
plan to peel more shares from that will cover any loss I have in WON. WON is a
difficult value play as they did not have any undervalued "hard" assets like
real estate but a very profitable franchise that I paid $0.50 on the dollar for
but unfortunately it is now worth $0.20 on the dollar. Poof, their goodwill and
value as a franchise (and ability to generate all that free flow cash flow)
dissapeared.

EKS

P.S. I would only recommend a speculative buy at this time and there are
probably better value plays in the media industry than WON. I have been wrong
in the past and will be wrong in the future. The key is to try to be right more
often than wrong.

It's just that the swings are so wild in some (many?) stocks now, that a time
frame of three days becomes almost irrelevant sometimes. If somebody calculated
a fair value for SPF of $10 and was able to buy the stock at $8, by their
figuring, they got a value if they bought at 8. And if the stock then went from
$8 through $10, and up to around $13, it could be considered as overvalued. For
SPF all this in a few days.

I don't mean to speak for Jurgis Bekepuris. No one actually explicitly said
here that SPF was a value pick or gave reasons why it might be. I'm just saying
with the market volatility, it seems to me we're getting individual swings in
prices of close to 100% on some stocks of interest, and that that swing can
transform the stock between overvalued to undervalued or vice-versa, very
quickly.

Some movements in the market are just plain crazy and do not make any sense.
Sometime i ask myself if i get bad quotes <g>.. I have been trying to scalp as

could lower my cost in ADVNA through position trading. Even within the same

mall REIT was down more than 6% all of a sudden and then later made up most of
the losses even though the general market went to hell. This was a movement I
was able to exploit.

Sometimes the market is so weak and my screen so red that I do not know what to
buy. In this case I decided on purchasing IVE,the most liquid large cap value
ETF i could find. this happened twice in the last few days <g>.

Trading not always works out for me. I got my head handed over on a platter
with UNTD, which I misjudged and sold with my stop loss.

I bet that Interactive Brokers is going to have one heck of a quarter with all
that volatility and trading frenzy. that's abet worth making if IBKR falls into
a hole.

TYC fragments: COV, TEL and TYC.

For every 4 shares of TYC you should have received one share each of TYC (new)
,TEL and COV.

Total combined value of TYC+TEL+COV=44+34+40$=118$. This would be equivalent to
29.5$ for the old TYC. This is not exactly a strong showing.

From the TYC fragments i bought COV and TEL today. COV is simply one of the
cheapest medical supply/equipment stocks i can find, based on P/S, cash flow
etc. the reason for this is substandard growth. R&D in underfunded with only
2.65 of revenue. the latest earnings report was decent. i think there is a good
chance that the spinoff unlocks value.

I was unsure about TEL and held of until earnings came out, since competitor
Moltex had a very weak report. TEL's earnings look much better, so I decided to
buy. TEL's business is tough and commoditisation is an issue but TEL is a
leader in most business segments. FCF looks very decent so I hope that the
spinoff will unlock vale as well. Based on competitors valuation TEL also looks
cheap IMO.

Good old fashioned industrials with strong cash flow are hip right now. Those
TYC fragments ought to have their day as well I hope. It would be about time.
