Hi Mike,

Re: NKE. You gave very compelling arguments
against NKE in your Microsoft Investor article.
Unfortunately these comments are coming not from an
Investor but from a Speculator. :-(((

It's true that NKE might go down to twenties.
It's true that the future for 1998 and part of 1999 is
cloudy. But looking at the other hand of the story you have
a great company, a great consumer franchise, a leader in
its field selling for under 1.5 PSR. Such opportunities
don't appear every night. That's why Sanborn is buying.
Even though he has to care about his quarterly
results, he is taking a long term view. I would have expected
you to do the same and to give a coherent strategy for
long-term investors. Dollar-cost-averaging, buying
in 3 parts at $50-35-20, whatever. Instead of that
I've got a short term speculation coupled with journalistic
sensationalism - what is Buffett doing, XXX and YYY is buying,
smart money is selling, etc.

Personally, I don't give a damn if Buffett is
buying. I'd preferred if nobody spread Buffett's rumour.
I still haven't finished my buying at $35. :-(((
The Buffett rumour illustrates one thing though - NKE
is in a spotlight. So when something really positive
happens the stock will take off like a rocket giving
no chance for your readers to wait for your "Buy!"
recommendation.

Just for curiosity sake, NKE was named by Fools
one of $1000 stocks for year 20X0 (I think 2010).
That's a possibility for which people invest - not for
which people speculate.

Good luck

Jurgis

I can't resist throwing in my two cents here. Nike has been the equivalent of a
Mcdonalds- a mediocre product hyped to infinity. But at some point the party
ends. There are no significant barriers to entry and unless you are an
impressionable kid or a wimpy parent, cheaper brands are available. IMHO in the
year 2000x we will be looking at these companies, and at the high multiples
paid for some banks and wondering how people could have been foolish enough to
pay so much for these stocks. I note that with respect to Mcdonalds five years
ago in Israel there were none, on a recent visit I noticed many.
Presumably this has taken place all over the world. But sooner or later the
party ends.

I'm on the wrong side, theoretically, of
a stock gaining positive momentum that
everyone wants to like. What can I do?
IMO, Nike's long-term prospects are less
than what everyone thinks. My
thinking is along Armin's. What barriers
to entry? What's to prevent another
brand to get hot or the shoe mania (which
is a recent phenomenon)
to end. Nike's then stuck with overbuilt
infrastructure and a longer-term
inventory problem. My mailbox is
peppered with people saying, "you've
got a great franchise, 20% ROE, great
management...are you some kind of idiot"
and then they inevitably take the high and
mighty road "I'm a long term investor."
or the low road "I'd take Phil Knight or Buffett over
you anyday."

If everyone thinks this,
I can't stop them. And it will become
a PE 50 stock that makes no sense just
like Gilette or Microsoft or Coke. Today,
nifty fify refers to the PE. Pay anything
for large, liquid consumer brands. Price
does not matter. If it's on your store shelf
or you see it everyday, then it is worth
whatever price you pay, and investors
find confirmation in the high valuations.
This is twisted Buffettology.

My point is price does matter,
and that the stock was in hype-world thanks
to unsustainable growth that everyone overoptimistically
thought would continue forever. Even Nike,
with all their capital spending. So the analysts
bid it to the 50-70's. That hyped world
can return, no doubt.

I think of myself as a value investor, not
a speculator. I see a risky market, a stock
everyone wants to love, and significant
downside short-term that may become
long-term if any of this lasts more
than six months, which no one expects.
That was the other thing I'm getting. "Ok,
write off 4-500 million in inventory and
you still have a great franchise." But
that's like Oracle blaming Asia. There's
more to it than just a one-time event IMO.
I'll wait, thank you. I called Nike
trying to write a positive story. I came
away saying, I can't.

James Clarke has a lot of good arguments
for Nike but he hasn't posted them here.
His was the most intelligent response I
received in a sea of "but but but"
stuttering.

Good Investing,

From:Stewart Whitman

Jurgis,

One thing that I learned from reading Graham was not to use a single year's
results to evaluate companies to see if I'm getting a bargain. When you look at
PSR and say it's less than 1.5, take a look at the average sales for the last 3
years (substantially less) and see what it is. Try the same for earnings when
looking at a P/E.

Now, I know you'll say that averaging sales or earnings for a fast growing
company is wrong and using those numbers gives an inaccurate picture. But look
back to years like 1994 when sales and earnings dropped. If you can convince me
that the revenues for 1997/1996 are not just the result of "very good years" -
that there was real quality growth - than using averages is probably inaccurate
and the stock might justify higher numbers.

I also don't understand why you think that PSR of 1.5 is so exceptionally low.
NKE seems to have always sold for PSR less than 1.5 (except in 1996 when PSR
went up to over 2). If you argue that NKE should have a higher PSR, say 2, then
with NKE's margins the P/E is ~24, at 2.5 the P/E would be ~30. In this market,
maybe those P/E are justified. Maybe it does deserve a premium, but as Mike
pointed out in his article the historical P/E is about 15, growth rate arguably
about 19% - so how much of a premium do you want?

For what it's worth, I don't think NKE at $40 is paying full price - not a
bargain but not overvalued. I just surprises me when people think that they are
getting a steal.

In fact, it's page 82.

Yes, I do. Here's another passage from GADR [the Book]:
=========================================
In The Beginning...

I first read "The Intelligent Investor" in 1980 or there
about. At the time, I was not in the Market. The DJIA
had not yet returned to the high of 1051 it had achieved in
1973, in spite of much ensuing inflation.....Real
estate, not the stock market, was the place to be. The
second time I read mention of "The Intelligent Investor"
in "Barron's", I decided to obtain a copy.

It was waiting for me on a shelf at the public library.
I read the Preface by Warren Buffett. At that time, I was
only vaguely aware of his existence. The general media
had not yet bestowed cult status on Wall Street and its
leading figures. Buffett had first read "The Intelligent
Investor" in 1950 at the age of 19, at which point he was
already something of an investing prodigy. In the Preface
of the last edition of "The Intelligent Investor", he wrote,
"I thought then that it was by far the best book about investing
ever written. I still think it is."

I reached the same conclusion before finishing the first
page of Chapter 1. Graham, quoting his own words from the
1934 edition of "Security Analysis", writes: "'An
investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis,
promises safety of principal and an adequate return.
Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.'"

It is difficult to exaggerate the effect those words had on
this reader. Finally, I felt, I was reading something on
investing written by someone who had actually thought
through the subject to its core issue: What is
investing? What is not? By comparison, other authors
seemed to have had merely fortuitous insights, supported
by back-testing carefully selected to confirm their ideas.

By the time I finished reading "The Intelligent Investor"
for the first time, I felt it was the only book on
"investing" I had ever read. Much subsequent study has
left this view largely undisturbed.
=======================================

> It's (sigh) [sic] also defined.

I let your whiny and rude tone pass without comment the first time,
accepting, at face value, your supercilious "el Nino" excuse for your
jejune attitude. But this second post, rather than adopting
the appropriately chagrined tone of someone with a mature persona,
instead continues in the vein of the typically petulant Spoiled
American Prince.

This is where my hypothesis is confirmed. As is in your first post
(which bent over backwards to make enemies where none had
formerly existed -- a luxury that even royalty can't really afford,
and that therefore, only a parvenu would affect), you express interest
in the stock picks themselves. It is obvious you have been

conditioned to expect and anticipate that your tantrums would be
rewarded with further (uncompensated) guidance.

But, alas, when the prince kisses the porcupine, the tale does not
necessarily end happily ever after.

Great response Porc...

For those interested in Eltron (ELTN), here is why it came down so hard:

Back again -

I got this off of Bloomberg -

Here is all the 4th quarter info:

4th Quarter 1997
NI .28

4th Quarter 1996
NI .30

NI .47

Revenues 4th quarter 1996 $22.7m

Decrease in EPS -7%
EPS Amount below estimates -40%

Skinner said, "Net income in the 1997 fourth quarter was affected by start-up
costs
associated with an evolving UPS product mix and accompanying changes in gross
margins, as well as certain non-recurring expenses and a change in the
effective tax rate
for the year."

I guess the gross margins are the primary concern looking forward. I have no
idea

Michael,

>>I'm on the wrong side, theoretically, of a stock gaining
>>positive momentum that everyone wants to like.

Are you saying that you are afraid to be wrong?
I think that you made compelling arguments, but unfortunately
now you are taking a stance of perma-bears
that say "I am right but market simply does not
understand me". I respect you when you say:
"I don't like this stock, this company, it's too
expensive, so I won't buy". I have a problem when people claim
to know some higher truth that makes their position "right".

Well, let's dissect some of your arguments:

> What barriers to entry?

Let's take any brand and you can ask the same question.
Do you remember the time when branded goods were dead?
Everybody was going to buy generic soda, razor, toothpaste, etc.
KO, G, PG, JNJ were going to disappear from the face of
the planet. I totally agree with you that I would not
buy overpriced branded goods. But - count me as a minority.
Most of the people pick the first shiny, familiar
brand they see. And some people are "addicted" to Coke,
Nike sneakers or Gillette razors.
And sometimes brands win by quality too.

Barriers of entry. There are no conventional barriers
of entry for almost any consumer franchise. Do you remember
when G was almost obliterated by BiC? I think Hagstrom
mentions that. These type of challenges make or brake
great companies. G survived and flourished, RBD has not
recovered, OAT is fumbling along.

> What's to prevent another brand to get hot?

Personally, I can't figure out
why people drink Coke, when there are so many better
alternatives available. Again, some companies do it
right. Some companies don't. Will Nike become a roadkill
or will it flourish? It's a call for 1-900 psychics. :-)))

Somebody else called NKE "a mediocre product hyped
to heaven" and compared it to MCD. I can only hope that
the comparison is correct. I've been in the developing
countries and believe it or not, MCD is a symbol of the
great western way of life. True, some people hate it, I hate
it, but we are minority. And MCD is a worthwhile investment
now - I don't follow it for personal reasons.

> What's to prevent another brand to get hot or the
> shoe mania (which is a recent phenomenon) to end.

I was not aware that wearing shoes is a "recent
phenomenon". :-))) Facetiousness aside, I don't understand
what you mean by "shoe mania". People need shoes to wear.
If they jog or play basket-ball, they wear out the shoes
faster. That's the only thing I see. Am I missing something?

>Nike's then stuck with overbuilt infrastructure

How much overbuilt is it? I believe they outsource
the production. So they have no factories. Warehouses and
distribution system is great to have in any case, because
even if they switch to producing airplanes :-) they
will be able to use it.

> and a longer-term inventory problem.

How long is "longer-term"?

>And it will become a PE 50 stock that makes no sense
> just like Gilette or Microsoft or Coke.

But Buffett is not selling Gilette or Coke. :-))))
No, I agree with you that Gilette and Coke are
expensive, and that I wouldn't buy them now.
I would not make any calls as to whether there is no
sense to that pricing.

Stewart asked me why I thought 1.5 PSR "cheap".
That's just my yardstick, and I don't have some
scientific reason for using it. However, it is
cheap compared not only to G and KO, but to number
of other top franchises I follow. Once again, if it's
a fad company - it does not deserve more than 1.5 PSR.
If it's an emerging "blue chip", then it could trade
alongside other franchises at 2-3 PSR. Or, if the market
tanks, it could trade alongside other franchises at
1 PSR. I like the odds. :-)))

> But that's like Oracle blaming Asia. There's
> more to it than just a one-time event IMO.

Actually ORCL is a good example. It's a great
company and I don't believe that MSFT is eating their lunch.
I would buy the stock but it's too expensive by my
yardstick.

I would like to see the world without "one-time"
charges and with candid management reports. Unfortunately
that is not the case.

Anyway, it's nice to have a reasonable discussion.

Good luck

Remember Buffett isn't selling Gilette or
Coke, but he's not buying more now either.
We know he may not be selling because of the
capital gains, but there isn't a very good
reason for why he's not buying more even
on the recent substantial dips if he still
felt they were good values.

I'm not at all afraid of being wrong. I'm
not sure where you got that. My opinions
are broadcast to the world, and I expect
every bit of any harsh response that I get.

Everyone wants to like Nike. I have been
tied up and whipped by people everywhere
for my position. I still have confidence
in my views, and the crowd just makes
me more confident. Like I said, I still
feel firmly contrarian. And hey, I make
money by knowing more than
the market. That's what investing is about
for value investors. If I bought Nike now,
I'd be a momentum player.

Look at Nike's revenues. They outright
exploded in 96 and 97. Wearing shoes
isn't a fad, but wearing Nike's shoes
and paying through the nose for them
is. Much of that growth was in the US
(40% in 97) and that US growth is not
really there anymore.

Nike is a much more recent phenomenon
than most seem to care to think. It
is not yet a consumer monopoly, and
any pricing power it had was
a fad. I want Coke. I don't necessarily
want Nike shoes. That equivalence is
not there yet, and may not ever be there.
Your example about every consumer brand
not attaining monopoly status/pricing power is a good
one. Nike is being challenged, and it
is still up in the air which way it will
go. Nike shoes became a big fashion statement,
as did Fila.

Oracle is indeed a good example. It drifted
lower , then
got slammed from the low 30's to
the low 20's on the announcement.
People were awfully bullish, emotional,
and thinking "all the bad news is
figured into it" at 32. The only
people that didn't like it were the
ODBMS junkies and people that hate
Ellison.

What I can say is that we have a lot
of traders buying Nike and saying they'll
hold it long-term when they've never
done that before. A lot of emotion.
We'll see, but I don't expect them to
change their stripes. And Nike hasn't even
announced any really bad news yet.

Sanborn's argument is fairly vague IMO,
and it doesn't sway me. I don't see how
Nike is historically undervalued to
itself or its peers, even on operating
cash flows/EBITDA. Great, 9.5X EBITDA.
Doesn't excite me. And I don't buy his
argument that he can buy now because he
now feels it is a consumer brand name that
deserves a premium. So his view of the
valuation has changed.

That premium view gives him confidence, and
allow him to make his value argument. But
that's a big assumption for a stock that
only demonstrated a premium in 1996,
never before and never since.

He's been at it for 7 years, and he's been
successful. And I may be wrong. But if you're
argument is that I should give in and just
say, ok, "how dare you think you know better
than the market," I will say that's my job.
I will never buy the stocks that everyone
is touting as "forever" stocks, because
everyone ignores the price when they buy those
stocks. Even value investors might do well
to be wary of their own brand biases when
purchasing stocks of well-known companies.

Good Investing,
Mike

re: Hey guys: feedback welcome --''''>. really?

You think then I am wrong in believing your last post is inconsistent with your

Investing is "bargain hunting" for stocks. If, as a consumer, you have found
bargain hunting to be a good way to "maximize your returns" on shopping for
consumer goods, then, as an investor, Graham and Doddsville may be the place
for you."?

Pretty easy to criticize me. I am posting my stocks (mostly), the reasons I
buy, and where they might fit in someone else's idea of a value portfolio also.
I am an easy target. Apparently, we shall have to wait to see what you have to

This is a repost of a message by me on the Nike
Yahoo thread. I thought it relevant to value investing
in the Buffett way, and to understanding my Nike article.
I must say, after a brief fling with Buffett, I am moving
back to Graham/Tweedy Browne beliefs. True Buffett companies
are richly priced, and I can't afford to buy up that
much silver.

A few points do matter. As an example:

You buy a stock at 45, it goes to 80 in 3 years. That's
a 21% annual compounding return. Buy at 40, it's a 26% return.
At 35, it's a 32% return. Don't look at it as,"it's worth
80 in 3 years regardless," because most people invest
the same amount of money no matter the price. Hence at 30 they
would buy 300 shares, but at 45 they would buy 200 shares.

This means that a few points on the compounding annual return
becomes very important. $10,000 at 21% for 10 years gives
%67,275. At 26% for 10 years gives $100,856. And at 32% for
10 years gives $160,598.

In fact, the more one professes to be a long-term investor
("for my kid's kids"), the more one should pay attention to
price (and thus to a few points here and there on expected annual
compounding rate of return). Ironically, much of the
feedback on my article has said, "I'm a long term investor,
so what do I care about a few points."

I detailed this in my MSN "Buffettology" article. There is
also a "Buffettology" thread on SI that goes through it.

This is also the reason my MSN "Running after Nike" article is
framed like it is - wait for a better price. It is ok to miss a
stock in search for a sufficient margin of safety - thus
Buffett's admonition to "wait for the right pitch." Especially
when you can see bad news on the horizon. The market is more
short-term oriented than many like to believe, and it
provides massive inefficiencies for patient investors.

To invest like Buffett, target your return and wait for it. I
provide a spreadsheet to help with this calculation in the
"Buffettology" article. And I provide a 10-year version of the
spreadsheet at my web site www.sealpoint.com.

In advance, I should apologize to lovers of soundbites for the
length of this note. I know there will be a few that already
know this that will say, "that's common sense - there is
nothing in this note that can't be had by reading." You're
right.

Good Investing,

The soundbite comment was in response to many on the
Yahoo thread that complained we should keep posts
limited to a few sentences at most. Certainly a
"Just Do It" and "I Can" crowd.

<<<<Will MBK be the Citibank of our banking crisis, rising
out of the ashes?
1. japan is finally deregulating the financial system after 7 years of
stagnation.
2. mbk is the largest bank in the world and the strongest in japan.
3. the japanese have an arcane law that would not let them (sorry G-7) lower
taxes until this spring.
4. they need to save face: cannot say will balance budget and then cut taxes.
now can say, the ameircans and europeans have forced us (being so rich) to help
them out...we were forced.
5. the japanese consumer has savings in 1-2% postal savings accounts--if a few
% goes into stocks.......whoosh!
6. citibank is hot on their heels, offering 24 hr. checking, customer service,
etc.--don't think the other banks aren't watching.
7. there has been minimal deregulation in airlines and ports.
8. the japanese consumer is finally getting fed up: this was the first year the
japanese ski team used all foreign equipment.
9. merril lynch bought yamaiichi and with fideility hot on their heels they
will show those japanese folks how they can make 5-10% per year on their
investments--boom! it will go into the stock market.
10. hey, where else can you buy the biggest bank in the world for $12-$13?
..........i could go on. but, in summary, when things are at their worst (below
15K) and mbk is selling at $12 or less, i will be buying.

Mike: re: NKE and FRK. I like S.H. Whitman's (posted here) thinking re NKE:I
also just don't see a compelling reason to buy at this price. Reminds me of the
big pro/con discussion (not on Web) of IBM in '94. So many good ideas either
way. There though, I eventually did see a compelling reason for me to buy.
Anyway, while you're getting chewed on for your NKE position, I wanted to
mention a nice call of yours - very timely IMO - on Medusa. I muffed an
opportunity there - stock is up nicely since your analysis, and it gave me a
carry through opportunity that sad to say, also got away from me. Based on
James Clarke's post - something about SJP and his going to FLA to look at all
the real estate co's -and your idea about Medusa, Florida Rock (FLK) a cement
co caught my eye. If SJP is going to build out - FLK should be a beneficiary.
Missed it at 21 last month, now about 26. I won't step up to it at this point,
but might be worth following for potential if it retraces lows. Cyclical
business probably, but co. seems to be doing okay over past few years. Anyway,
very timely mention on Medusa - sorry I couldn't absorb information quickly
enough. Happens when you're old and slow - to some of us -g-.

What a coinkydink. Just a few minutes ago, I was investigating
Florida Rock for the first time over. So you beat me
to that one. Although we're both sitting here at 26,
it's on my list for investment with the next correction,
along with New Holland, Phelps Dodge, Callaway Golf.

I believe Asia will affect us over at least the next 2 years, so
I'm looking for home-grown small industrials selling to home-grown
or at least non-Asian customers. BMC, Medusa both fit
that. Medusa's still cheap. Deswell is in HK, but it's just
doing too darn well to let go. Sybron Chemical didn't get bought
out after all, but it's still up at 32. It may fall in a correction,
and I'd buy it again. I'm also taking a gander at
Supreme Industries and Federal Signal (trying to get 19 or
less). NCI Building keeps coming up on my screens.

I'll post here or my web site more details when I think any
of these potentials is a good buy.

May be that the company is misperceived on Wall Street (more likely I'm the

range, year after year (except that in '95 they lost money). Rev's have more

announced authorized sh. buyback of

valuation model (19 would be good)- but at current price and pe, and perhaps
continued revenue growth, it's still worth a buy IMO. Bot a small amt at 24.1/4

Michael -

I find your posts in SI among the most valuable I read. One question though -
as the starter of the 'Buffettology' thread, how can you say the following?

"I must say, after a brief fling with Buffett, I am moving
back to Graham/Tweedy Browne beliefs. True Buffett companies
are richly priced, and I can't afford to buy up that
much silver."

In moments such as these, Buffett would simply argue the market is too
overpriced, and wait until there was a true Buffett company not richly priced.
Maybe you simply subscribe to multiple value investing theories. That's fine. I
personally have become a strict 'Buffetollogist'.

How about a stock that's selling below the amount of cash it's about to get
through the sale of one of its subsidiaries. Last week Elbit Medical Imaging,
ELITF, announced it was selling their ultrasound division to GE for 230 million
dollars. EMITF has 21.39 mil. shares outstanding., 10.75 cash per share. The
stock is trading at about $7.25 per share. EMITF also owns 55% of the shares of
ELT a NYSE stock that currently has a market cap of 118 million. That adds
another $3.00 a share. This does take into account their Medical Centers or the
fact that if ELT were to be sold it would be worth at least 1X sales which are
about 300 mil. or $7.70 a share. This is "a too good to be true situation," but
I haven't been able to find anything negative about it.

Re: Elamf Well you talked me on to another one. I looked at it and liked its
cash position and lack of debt. Looks like a low risk reasonably good
return situation. I sold my Brazillian holdings until i see what the deficit
turns out to be.

On another topic I broke one of my rules. I just bought a stock that gapped
down- Dura Pharmaceutical. I looked at it real quick and jumped in at $22.5. It
was 21 when I started researching it but oh well. The bottom line is this is a
company which may have 4-5 new products in the pipeline, pre-announced lowere
profits for 1998 and the stock got crushed from about 38 yesterday. This
company has $10 in cash!

I have a large position (for me) in DSSI it is speculative but I believe it has
huge upside potential. The SI thread on it has lots of info, but in a nutshell
the value of the company roughly equals
its investment in tower semiconductor. In addition it has a software product,

a computer reselling and consulting business and the real jewel may
turn out to be its remote electric meter reading product subsidiary
which is now run by a gentleman formerly associated with Luscent

Armin,

I bought DURA towards the end of '93 and still hold some. The stock is very
volatile - not for the faint of heart (you have been warned). Maybe I should
have sold, but the longer term outlook has continued to look good to me.

The company specializes in sales of respiratory drugs. Typically they'll
purchase drugs that are approved but that are non-blockbuster (i.e. below $500
million sales) from the larger pharmaceutical companies (e.g. Roche), and then
sell them with their own sales force. For the larger pharma, the drugs are not
cost-effective, but DURA can get a lot of money from them.

The company is also developing their own drug delivery system for various drugs
(each drug/delivery system must be approved by the FDA, but most people I talk
to consider the risk of non-approval very low). These drug/delivery systems are
the 4 or 5 products in the pipeline (so they're not actually brand new drugs,
and there's going to be existing competition).

DURA does most of its development "off-balance" sheet - in this case, that
means they fund a separate company to do R&D. Currently, the off-balance sheet
company shares (which are callable and include other privileges) are traded as
SDCOZ. It's been easier for Wall Street to see the value in the sales
organization because the R&D is done off-balance sheet. This is also the reason
their profit margins are so large. The "R&D" charges have come occasionally as
non-recurring charges for setting up, and buying out the off-balance sheet
company. Some people don't like this - they say it's fancy accounting, etc..

In the short term, DURA's going nowhere (IMO)., but I'm pretty sure that the
longer term growth picture is still intact. Can't say that I think its a
"value" stock, but I really like the company and its prospects.

***** OFF SUBJECT!! *****

Please excuse this off-subject question, to anyone who can help, but I have a
serious quandry.

Quite a while back I bought what I think was a "pump-and-dump" stock - RTEK
(Rubber Technology) for an average cost of 0.35/share. It tanked. It has been
trading at around 0.02 and 0.03. I wrote it off a a total loss. Then, when I
tried to view the stock through Yahoo!, it told me the symbol had been changed
to RTEKD. I thought this was probably bad news - probably something like "RTEK-
Disenfranchised" or like. Then today, this new stock (RTEKD) closed at $1.00
(according to Yahoo!) for a 4900% increase!! According to the Quicken quote
here on SI, there is still an RTEK (at 0.02) and an RTEKD (Rubber Technology
NEW) trading at $1.00.
Can anybody help me sort this out? $1.00/share seems way too good to be true,
and I would sell in a heartbeat. But I don't know what to make of this.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I apologize for interrupting your

a substantial margin this year.

But even these stocks have moved up too far too fast.
I bought PHSYA at 48 for the long term, but here it is
at 60 1/2. I bought BMC for two years, and it goes from
16 to 20. Medusa moves from 39 7/8 to 47.

I am spending no small amount of time trying to figure
out this good fortune, and I've concluded it's a bad
omen for the market. I think that there is a limit
to the overvaluation of the big names, and that
people are moving into liquid small-mid caps. But
they still want it liquid, as they eye the exits.

The ultra-small cap values like HYDEA and ELAMF
are not seeing any strength. Why? Institutions are
putting an extra premium on liquidity due to the
market heights. And individuals are giving up
and trading their HYDEA for Index funds and
MSFT.

The technicals of the market have divorced themselves
from the fundamental picture, even if you count
mutual fund inflows. I recently read an
interesting article that stated the baby boomer
rollover into mutual funds is less than we think.
As they pour money into mutual funds, they are selling
individual stocks, in a ratio that is not nearly
as far from 1:1 as people think.

This exacerbates liquidity's premium. I think
we've all seen this happen over the last 5 years.

Re: being in the right strategy, I refuse to believe
that long-term, buying overvalued stocks will beat
undervalued stocks. And I refuse to pay the liquidity
premium in an overheated market.

Re: an alternative. Jump in with the crowd. I've been
such a perma-bear the last year and half. I'll just
let everyone here know when I start buying MSFT or DELL.
Then you can safely leave the market ;o).

FYI, there's a "Going with the Flow" article headlining
the MSN Investor web site.

Honest Abe,

Geez, thanks for the compliment. My "brief fling
with Buffett" is an overstatement. I've been intrigued
by Buffett ever since I read Lowenstein's account.
But I never thought I could find stocks like him -
I didn't know what to look for. Buffettology spells
it out, and allows me to quantitatively calculate
the value. I was and am excited about this, but
I am less enthusiastic about using this strategy
in today's market.

I subscribe to several strategies, and I am trying
to use them to create my own unique - and hopefully
soundly grounded - strategy. My waiting for bad
news and downgrades is my most recent contribution to
adding concepts of event trading and contrarian
investing to value investing. It stems from Buffett's
waiting for the right pitch, however.

Good Investing,

I find buying price discontinuities on bad news has been an exceptionally poor
strategy for me. I have rarely seen an exception to the old rule that the first
disappointment is usually not the last. That is because the first
disappointment is often the result of poor management, which survives the
initial problem to ruin another day.
(A truly extraneous event would be an exception.)

So as a long term investor, not a trader, my policy is to wait for a few
disappointments to really beat up a stock price, look for insider buying, and
study the company inside out and backwards meanwhile.
(This approach plus intimate knowledge of the industry kept me out of a certain
health care company.)

Mike, I would be curious as to whether you would be willing to stretch your
definition of value stock to include franchise value or dominant market
position, even if regular valuation measures looked ridiculous.
AOL would have been such a stock many points ago.

The reason I ask is that I love my @HOME service. Everyone does. The small
extra cost (vs. AOL plus extra phone line, or even AOL alone) is a no-brainer
in terms of productivity (personal ROI). However, ATHM has a ridiculous
valuation, but appears to be dominant in its niche and with all the right
corporate connections.

One thing to be aware of, is xDSL takes off in whatever form is finally decided
on by Intel, etc., ATHM cable modem will be given a run for the money. The most
major draw back with cable modems is that the more people put on a loop the
less bandwidth availible for everyone. Imagine a big data pipe flowing around
your neighborhood with a limited through put. Each new person that is added
syphons off a share of that bandwidth. So if only 10 people are on the loop
each person gets 1/10 of the total. But if you only add 10 more people the
amount of bandwidth to each person is now 1/20 and your speed has been halved.
With xDSL you get a pipe directly to your house which you dont have to share
with any one. I am not trying to be alarmist but this is a real
threat/limitation of ATHM and cable modems.

Progress Report on my "1998 Outlook," as posted on 1/1/98.
So far this year, all of my 6 predictions have been on the mark, except for
Checkpoint having only a small gain. I will be updating my 1998 Outlook
shortly. Here's the YTD data compared to my 1/1/98 statements:

>1. Electric Utilities will be hot (on a risk/reward basis), with total returns
of 20-35%.<
The Telescan Electric Utilities Index (.UOP) on January 1st was 86.15; today
it's at 89.87. YTD gain = 4.3% , annualized gain = 28.9%.

>2. Internet stocks will be one of the hottest sectors of 1998.<
ISDEX internet stock index on January 1st was 99.87, now at 130.22. YTD gain =
30.4%, annualized gain = 491%.

>3. The Nikkei, surprising almost everyone, will surge to 20,000.<
Nikkei on January 1st was 15,280; now at 16,832. YTD gain = 10.2%; annualized
gain = 78.6%, and annualized year-end close of 27,300.

>4. Secondary stocks will have a very good 1st quarter.<
The NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have obviously surged after a weak December and
early January.

>5. The Dow will reach 10,000.<
The Dow is up YTD 6.8% from 7950 to 8490; annualized close would be 11,800.
10,000 appears possible.

>6. My favorite company for 1998 is Checkpoint Software (CHKPF).<
After closing 1997 at around 40 3/4, Checkpoint plunged to around 30 1/2 after
a wicked downgrade, but has recovered strongly to 41 5/8 now. Virtual Private
Networks are still a hot growth area, and Checkpoint's firewall market share
still leads the pack by a wide margin.

Michael,

You know that I am not a perma-bear. ;-)
I still find values with my strategy. I outlined it
in my post:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=3354453

It's buy leaders - or Buffetized Superstocks - at low PSR.
Sell at high PSR.

Of course, this strategy takes me into the most controversial
stocks like NKE.

Unfortunately (or fortunately) my sell levels are achieved
pretty fast in this market, so I have to find other buys
or hold cash. I also have to sell the controversial stocks
where the fundamental picture does not go the way
I was estimating. This does not contribute to long-term
holding style, but I am unwilling to hold highly-valued
stocks.

Having told all that, I am still 100% invested and
I still have a list of stocks at buy levels (take a look at
SMTL and WFR). So it's either not as bad as it seems, or
I am overly optimistic. :-)

I don't think you've been a perma-bear either.
You made a number of good calls even though I did not
participate in any of them. TBR was the one that I liked
most. So once again I wouldn't get concerned about
the eminent crash if you are comfortable with the valuations
of stocks in your portfolio.

Good luck

in aero-space and telecom infrastructure sectors.

My philosophy is very similar to Mike's. I understand Buffett's logic and will

today, so I'm making a list, checking it twice, and building up cash for a bear
market.

In the meantime, I will buy Graham value when I can find it, and stay 15-30% in
cash if I can't (I am 25% in cash now, to answer that question). Tejon Ranch,
St. Joe Corp. made me a lot of money faster than I had expected. Today I think
HYDEA, US Can fit that strategy. HYDEA has been an underperformer, but like
Mike, I don't care. When the market tanked in October, Hyde didn't move. When
it moves to its net asset value, I will sell. That would be a 40% gain. It
might do that in a bull market, it might do that in a bear market. I can't
imagine it going much lower, no matter how bad the market gets. Actually, today
I would love to have a diversified portfolio of 10 HYDEA's. Then I could forget

Wow. Beats what I'm aware of - about 1/25 of the price of my last trade with a

bring this to your attention. Not to tout, recommend or not recommend or
otherwise pronounce judgment on Brown or discount vs. full service. Only to
point out how easy -- maybe too easy-- it's become to get in and get out. The
casino vig. just got a lot lower IMO. Going to be so easy to take that flyer.
Even for 12 yr. old kids -g-. Just about the cost of a couple of lottery
tickets. Still, for guys moving around within a diversified portfolio, it can
be of much help. Also even for people with concentrated portfolios who turn 'em
once or twice a year. Maybe for everybody we can expect increased volatility in
our portfolios or individual stocks. Maybe not. If it - low commissions -
encourages people to get out when stocks are tanking -- then I guess that would
help the value buyer (or speculator) to get in while there is down pressure on
the stocks from the sellers. Similarly on way up, lets people who are afraid of
the heights they see, to get out and yet also inexpensively get back in. I
don't do options, futures, etc. but maybe that's the alternative many people
have been using now.
One thing I do know, these inexpensive commissions let me - encourage me
actually - to lag into a position very inexpensively and also let me go into a
goodly number of them. I like that.

Hello all:

On the boomers, I also read a similar article. Apparently this is one of the

but I don't have a link) mentioned that the originator of the "baby boomer
savings" hypothesis has changed his view. He says the perception of boomer
savings driving the markets simply does not fit the facts. Suprisingly, the
numbers reveal that most boomers have done a woefully inadequate job of saving
for retirement, and investment philosophies dependent upon the assumption of
such large cash inflows into the market should be reconsidered.

Previously, I had believed that this was one consideration behind the inflated

Mike,

I read the Buffettology book also, and subsequently built some screens and an
Excel model to calculate minimum future values as described in the book. The
difficulty I have, however, is that extrapolating Equity per share into the
future seems as risky as predicting earnings per share.

I'm finding that most of the stocks that look to be good buys (15+% annual ROI)
have projected equity per share growth of 25+% compounded. I'm reluctant to
assume such robust growth over long periods of time. Are you finding the same
thing?

Some of the bigger names showing up are Schwabb, Cisco, Calloway, and Oracle.
Some stocks that I've seen mentioned on this thread: NCI Building Sys, Medusa,
and Deswell. Note that this screen does not consider the monopoly power
component that Buffet considers crucial.

This can persist for long periods of time

In an effort to gauge market power, I also use high ROE screens. (Current ROE

also a reflection of good management.

I still think the most tenuous portion of the Buffet method as described in the

write accomodates concept that picking bottom of contrarian stocks is very

My opinion is that it is very dangerous to combine a macro view with a micro or
value orientation. In my opinion, value investors should buy value when and
where they find it. (With diversification within value categories - geography,
business, size, etc.) Period. Anyone taking significant actions based on their
outlook for the economy, their thoughts about interest rates, the general lofty
levels of the market --- these actions IMO have resulted in losing situations.
And IMO it's a terrible place to be when one is a sold-out bull (or bear) and
the market - and most investors - are doing well. One is then in the position
of hoping things get bad to be vindicated and presumably to get back in. Any
tactics that anticipate the economy or try to reduce anxiety about the macro
view that employ hedging categories such as having shorts as a portion of a
portfolio, moving to alleged countercyclical investments (foreign exchanges),
apportioning parts of portfolio to precious metals --- these efforts have
diminished overall results (compared to a buy and hold, or a buy low, sell fair
value approach). IMO. Up to now anyway -g-.

Investor2: I just wish I knew! My preference is to sell at fair or full value
(whatever that is -g- sometimes I have lots of trouble figuring it out). But my
latest tally of my performance is that of the last 22 times I've done this
(sold), the stocks have continued to rise (18 times). So now I have 2 risks
against me. That (selling too soon) and risk of reinvesting proceeds in a wrong
stock. But on the other hand...some stocks I still seem to be holding forever.
Very hard for me to do this as they go higher and higher. Pharmaceuticals for
example. Very hard even to assess fair value. Now they're way past the point -
the ruling reason - why I bought them.
Yet fortunes have been made JUST HOLDing them. (The old lady in NYC who died
last year w/$24 million comes to mind.) Just holding TIGHT ---Ridiculous maybe
but there we are - I'm in and glad I'm in. I compromise a little by selling
some small amounts on scale up - lose more by doing this than I make by
reinvesting proceeds in undervalued stocks it seems (I'm laughing and crying
here.)

Another method discussed on this thread was one of O'Shaughnessy's several
methods wherein he has done research which indicates if - once per year you
rebalance your portfolio by closing positions and then buy stocks that have
risen the most the previous year which have certain qualities like psr below
1.5, etc. ---- this is a very good way to invest (There's a thread on SI.) Not
sure that I've got his requirements exactly right here -- his is not a method
I'm comfortable with. Hard for me to step up and buy up.

One thing I can say is that I believe my portfolio turnover is a heck of lot
less than most of the other guys on this thread. I don't believe in
pig-at-trough investing AT ALL. (Which is, if you find a new stock you like,
you kick out a stock you already have--only so much room at the trough -g-). I
don't know how guys like Honest Abe can hold on so long to such a few stocks --
they are tough in the good Buffett way -- too tough for me. o52870u2--oops that
