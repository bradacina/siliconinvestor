Karl,

I own CY, CS and looking to buy KLAC below 25. CY and CS have limited downside
risk. CY is cyclical but selling close to its book value which has been in the
past an attractive enty point.. CY's chaiman Rodgers was on CNBC recently and
explained its current problems. I am exepecting CY to earn over a dollar in
1999 and trade around 20 by early 1999.

CS as you know is a turnaround. Networking market is growing >20%. CS still has
good R&D. The big money will be made in future with new generation of
networking equipment based on ATM technology. My guess is CS's new management
understands this. Cisco or any one else for that purpose does not have a lock
on new technology. The biggest risk with CS is that they may not have enough
money for their R&D effort. ATM will require major upgrade of networking
equipment with in two or three years. Their is a remote possibility CS may be
acquired by Siemens or Alcatel at much higher price.

KLAC has a major portion of the semiconductor test equipment market locked in.
However there is too much semiconductor manufacturing capacity right now and
upgrade to newer technology fab's may not occur in 1998. KLAC along with AMAT
also may have lower earnings this year. For the next semiconductor cycle I will
like to own WFR, AMAT and KLAC. I am long WFR now and hoping to pick up AMAT
and KLAC in low 20's.

Best wishes and good investing

Ron,
Large blocks trades usually indicate a rapid acceleration of a trend or else a
reversal. MEOHF seems to be ready for a reversal. Some player is stepping up to
the plate to reverse the selling trend. If the sellers run out of shares to
sell, then the only direction left is up when the player tries to accumulate
more shares. I like reversals on huge volume.

Look at CSU on Wednesday with a panic sell of about 700,000 shares at 9 and
then it rebounded the 10% it was down just an hour later and ended up as high
as 10-7/8 yesterday before the market dragged it down also. MEOHF held up very
strong in the last 2 days without the 7-1/2 mark being violated.

Karl C. Wenner: re your finds. I'll give you some feedback. Seem like these
stocks are better than some of your last year's mentions. Or at least closer to
my way of thinking -g-. I wouldn't be surprised to see a package of tech stocks
such as you've selected do very well overall (that is, CY,CS, and KLAC). I too
am trying to do this. (You might want to check out NTAIF mentioned by Paul K.
in a recent post here. It would be a typical value stock - and might do well as
part of a package of diverse tech stocks. I own it, but I bought at higher
prices BA (Before Asia -g-). Tough part of holding a package is that one has to
have the fortitude to endure.
Morrow Snowboards seems like it must've shown up on some sort of value screen.
If they can't sell their product (sales have decreased), and their inventory is
their product, then I wouldn't want to assume that book value provides either a
margin of safety or a decision point to buy/sell the stock. Rainforest almost
similar. Apparently 3 of their restaurants (or whatever they are called) have
had decreasing sales. Article out somewhere - Motley Fool? - where author asks
something about just how many customers will continue to buy their profitable
gorilla t-shirts that they sell in these places? My point: maybe there's a good
reason why this stock is down and might stay down. For me, forward pe of 13 for

QGLY a value stock? Not on your life. Ben Graham would stand you in the corner
for even suggesting it.

My reasoning:

--It's a one-product company
--The product has competition this year -- EVERYBODY is bringing out zinc
lozenges. (QGLY's patent is only on the formulation, not the active ingredient.
The formulation is supposed to make it taste better. Try one for yourself -- it
still tastes like crap.)
--Management is questionable in my opinion. Check out how much of the revenue
gets siphoned off in royalties to managment before the stockholders get any.
--The sales figures are to retail -- who knows if customers are actually buying
this stuff.
--Mild winter = fewer colds = lower sales for ALL cold remedies.
--And of course the thing Ben Graham would point to first -- the lack of any
consistent track record on earnings.

One more negative -- the hysterical tone of the hypesters on the QGLY thread. A
bunch of tub-beaters who sound as though QGLY is paying them by the word.

I passed on this one about six months ago, then watched it double. And I never
regretted the decision. There is no question in my mind that it could double
again. But it could just as easily -- MORE easily IMO -- go to zero. It's as
speculative a stock as you can find. No "value" whatsoever IMO.

Paul,

Thanks for comments on MAX - decided to pass on it.

On Bear vs. correstion: My wife and I were out last night and I got irrefutable
proof that this is a correction - the hemlines of dresses. My eyes are a little
bloodshot and my ribs hurt from my wifes elbow, but I toughed it out and
examined all of the evidence available because I wanted to make sure my
research was valid.

To those wanting more expert opinion, the one I have trusted most this past
year has been Mary Farrell of Pain Webber. She says we have volatility in a
Bull market, earnings reports will be generally good and the market will start
stabilizing late this Q. Expect a reversal as investors and funds will not be
satisfied with below 6% return from bonds, strong bullish market in 2Q. "Baby
being thrown out with bathwater" and there's some really good buys.

This was echoed by Abby Cohen of Goldman Sachs (normally bearish) saying
there's a big inflow of foreign monies to equity and bonds, S&P companies will
show over 8% earnigns growth, DOW may be unstable for a week or two prior to
earnings but first to recover and be above 8700 by end of the year, last half
of the year the emphasis will be on small/mid caps. Recommends Financial
Services, Banking, and that investors take a good look at some of the foreign
stocks like Fijitsu.

I see more evidence with headlines like "Investor panic about Asian situation
isn't warranted".

I believe we will see a market turn around this week, possibly as early as
Monday. I've seen signs of strength in my buys with bargain hunters ready to
take advantage of the panic sellers. High volumes but very little downside
movement and gains on my recent buys.

For what it's worth,
Ron

Ron,
I love MAX. I bought it originally at 2-3/4 or so 4 years ago and have received
3 or 4 splits of 5 or 10%. I like their management and think they will give
15-20% annual returns, especially starting with a depressed P/E. When I spoke
directly to management before they hired a P/R firm they were always low keyed
and honest, understating the potential and coming in with good results
constantly. They have expanded a lot and seem to be doing well with their
customers as sales are increasing except with the government downsizing, and
that seems to be reversing. Their cargo operations seem to have great margins
and have been expanding. It seems to be putting in a bottom. I'll be buying
some for accumulation if it gets under 5-7/8 again.

Brooks,
I agree that QGLY is not a value stock.

I just said that it is of value to me. When a company's growth rate can far
exceed it's P/E for a decent period of time (a year or more), then it is likely
to outperform the market. When a stock has increased revenues 4000% in the last
year, it's not hype, but performance. I agree that they will have competition
one day and I'm not able to predict when. I do know they announced a military
base approval to sel their product and are trying to get a relationship with a
company to sell abroad. If they hook up with a strong dominant partner, then
there will be plenty of growth left. They also are buying back shares, which is
a desparate attempt to bolster the price if they are dishonest, and if they are
honest, then they think the company's price is undervalued. I'm not taking a
large position in it and if I make 20-30%, I'll probably sell 2/3 and play the
rest with profits. I've read in a local paper how customers preferred Cold-eze
to some Hall's product by a wide margin. With a market as shaky as this, I'd be
less prone to buy this type of stock, but I do find value when a growth rate
far exceeds the P/E. They stated they thought they could grow by 20% in 1998
also and earn over 1.10 this year. If so, then a P/E of 13 is rather
inexpensive. I'm sorry if I implied this is a value stock where one's principal
is entirely safe. BMLS is one more along this line with a book value over $4.00
and a p/e around 10 when it trades under $3.00. It will be unlikely to return
more than 20% in a year, while QGLY has much more potential. AOL is growing
around 50% in revenues, slower than QGLY right now, but has an astronomical
projected P/E around 100 or more. By comparison, QGLY is providing much more
value as AOL has to dominate for 4-6 years to grow into it's price. If QGLY can
continue to grow by even 10%, then it is cheap, If not, you're right that there
will be very little value left. At this time I don't know if they will grow,
but the trend looks decent. That's what I meant by value.

Paul,
I'm 10% in low P/E, high growth stocks, 10% in microcaps and 60% in REITs right
now. I have 20% cash also. Most of the REIT's I trade short term looking for 7
- 12% in 3 months or less. For the last year about 80-90% of my trades have
been able to return 5% or more in just months, and about 5% were
break-even/small losses. By holding on long term, REIT's owing golf, warehouse,
and office space properties should be able to provide 15% (+/- 5%) returns
combined appreciation and dividends for the next 5 years. From what I have
gathered, but need to research more, it seems that Real Estate has provided a
similar or better return than stocks for decades until 1989-1990. Since then,
the stocks have outperformed real estate returning 300% to maybe 50-100% for
real estate. This seems to me that real estate should be able to outperform
stocks over the next few years. The book value of the Dow Jones stocks has only
grown from 1075 to 1414 since 1988 End of Year (some of this is probably
understated since Disney & Philip Morris have negative book values and Merck is
less than $5 book. Earnings were 215.46 then and are estimated at $420.00 for
this year. If earnings slow down or inflation picks up, then their is plenty of
downside opportuntity.

A few nice things about REIT's. They are yielding more than almost any
investment out there since Bonds and Utilities have been incredibly strong for
the last 2-1/2 months.
REIT's generally trail utilities by up to 6 months. The utilities haven't put
in a definite top yet, but when it becomes apparent that they have, a trader
will be able to lighten up on REIT's if this pattern continues. For some REIT's
that have produced 15% + return annually for more than 10 years, look at NPR,
HCP, MT, NHP. I wouldn't necessarily buy any of these now, as I feel there are
better values, but it is a steady consistent growth. This includes the last 10
years which weren't banner years for real estate until maybe last year. REIT's
will get clobbered also if we have a full scale recession, but so will just
about every other investment imaginable.

By the way, does anyone think gold is becoming a value play? It may be 1-5
weeks too early to buy gold still as a definite bottoming formation hasn't
occurred... Not too much upside potential for gold unless inflation picks up
and Greenspan can't act due to the Asian crisis.

I also like MAX, but I think it will be showing market weakness until they can
prove they are back on track. It really hasn't fallen much off of it's highs in
spite of the write-off.

This is the reason I bought MEOHF. It is well off of highs. If it makes
projected earnings, PE will be below 7 at current price and I believe we'll see
12-14 range fairly soon. With the share buyback, cash, and current expansions,
I believe they will continue growth. Their next earnings report will be
compared to a year ago loss!!

Richard: re reits. You could be right. I was thinking about people investing in
single family houses or apartment units as an alternative to stocks. I forgot
about REITS. I don't like 'em. Got burned too badly in '80's (Koger), and since
I've been burned, I've avoided them. (Wrongly it seems.) New Plan, Heath Care,
others like Rouse are primo. Get dividend and growth. Price rises for some
since '88 look great. Real estate itself seems to be a long term proposition
-to realize growth, but you've apparently figured out how to short-term trade
successfully the REITs you follow. What confuses me about reits (other than the
accounting -g-) is that the mentality of the management. Classic real estate
wheeler dealers or business managers able to satisfy investors of their
abilities to manage a (usually) diverse group of investments? Too many of these
guys seem (I have no facts to support this) ego driven to build their
portfolios. As long as they can get money, they can and will do deals (like
buying and selling from each other as happened frequently IMO a decade ago).
Just like in Malasia and Indonesia now -g-. For me, I'd consider a reit mutual
fund, maybe Steers and Cohen. I've been trying to follow a few REITs where the
managers seem to be buying stock in open transactions (not options related); I
figure maybe they won't be taking too much advantage of investors if they are
willing to buy in at current price. But none of this would work as well as your
method seems to indicate.

From:Richard Barron

Michael,
The are a few things to consider when buying REIT's.
1.) Many of them are consolidators and will grow since the have proven they can
do this just like consolidators in any other business that can effectively cut
costs and provide good management disciplines.
2.) Each type of REIT is cyclical, and the key is to recognize when
overbuilding is likely. Get out a year before the overbuilding is obvious to
everyone. Right now, hotels will be facing overbuilding in a year or two, and
outlet malls are already experiencing difficulty. Some sectors that seem to be
safe for growth for a few years are the warehouses, office buildings and golf
courses, since Tiger is helping bring a lot of interest back to the sport.
Public storage (mini-warehouses) tend to do well even during recessions as more
people are moving or downsizing.
3.) REIT's have traditionally been interest rate plays, similar to bonds and
utilities (with less quality, though many of the REIT's have far outperformed
the average Utility over a 10-15 year period.). Many are paying higher
dividends than Utilities and Bonds and will find the yield chasers.
4.) Real estate experienced a depression in the 1988-1991 rnage with many
properties losing 50% or more of their values. Banks and Hotels almost went
bankrupt also.For 6-7 years everyone has been saying buy banks. They have been
right the whole time until the last 2 weeks. Banks have been recovering for 7
years and consolidating the whole time. Real estate has only been recovering
for 2-3 years and could easily last as long as the banks unless the economy
tanks big time. If so, real estate will probably be better off than most orther
investments.
5.) Any company that is doing business now, will have to be doing it different
and better in 10 years or they will be on the ropes. (i.e. Apple Computer,
Westinghouse, etc.). On the other hand, Real Estate in a good location can
never be created or replaced. New locations will become hot, but no one can get
new land closer to a current hot location, which means that well situated real
estate properly managed will appreciate.

I'm not suggesting anyone keep 60% of their portfolio in real estate, but it
may pay to lighten up on some speculative or vastly overpriced blue chips and
move 5-10% into real estate. Many REIT's are inexpensive now that have 5-8%
yields and appear to be ready to grow 10% or faster in the next year.

Mike, James Clarke: re REITS, ALEX, TPL. Fundamentals are iffy IMO (but of
course I've been wrong on this sector). I think with some of these REITs, since
valuation is so site specific, it's tough to analyze the content of a REIT's
portfolio. For example REITs with shopping centers all over the midwest or
entire country. Here I'd have to go with the record of management and history
of the REIT- and the records of some (e.g. GGP) look pretty good. As far as
land and buildings being in prime areas being so valuable, I just wonder.
Already I'm buying hundreds of dollars of books from Amazon, and I've started
buying CD's on-line too. Just anecdotal evidence (the worst kind sometimes
-g-), but still the cumulative effect of the Net could be to reduce pressure to
purchase real estate - some retail real estate anyway. You have had good luck
with Tejon. Maybe another Marty Whitman special -- his fund owns Alexander and
Baldwin (undervalued land in Maui) is for you. Texas Pacific Land is a big
landowner with oil leases, also undervalued by some alleged experts. Paul

I think that your comments about the impact of the Internet on the value of
retail real estate is quite interesting. It sounds to me like an adverse
secular trend of unknown dimensions at this time. (I for one did do some
research on items on the Internet but still bought an advertised special at the
local mall.)

As far as the general issue of real estate is concerned, we have had that with
S&L's, banks and insurance companies in the past. A good track record did not
necessarily help, e.g., Mutual Benefit Life, an
old-line mutual insurance company that went bust.

I think that as long term investments, the ones where the land value is highly
discounted like St. Joe Paper was (or is?), or perhaps the ones you mention,
give you a margin of safety.

As for real estate, I like to find stuff below the radar screen. The REITs are
so overfollowed now that they are priced as efficiently as anything else in the
market. Also I find that with REITS it is very important to know management,
and that's hard for a small investor to do. I've looked at Alexander and
Baldwin, and just didn't see it. I spent last weekend looking at Greif
Brothers, which is kind of known as a "St. Joe-like" stock. I'd call that one
fairly valued. Texas Pacific may be interesting if you know the oil business -
I will be the first to admit that I don't. As for now, I still think St. Joe is
the best deal in this sector and don't feel much need to look further.
BTW, St. Joe split 3:1 today.

Senior's Buffett story: I think you get a chance go with Buffett, but it's
seldom. Last year, it was his rumored buying of zero coupon bonds. I didn't see
how he'd make money there. Now I know -g-. Shame on me. In the early seventies,
he was more talkative. A person could have followed him by reading an important
Forbes article. It's possible in the '60's he may have been quoted in some
business publications as a buyer of Am Ex during the vegetable oil scam that
was supposed to have destroyed Am Ex. Mr. Buffett is a very secretive fellow
though these most recent decades. But on very rare occasions he has slipped and
has telegraphed or otherwise announced his purchases. This happens about once
per decade IMO. And so in the '80's he inadvertently told us about a Big One he
liked - a Monster it turned out (IMO). And I was there to catch it! I still own
it, and I bet he does too. With growth by the company, and my confidence in it
increasing as the years have passed, the stock valuation has come to dominate
my portfolio. The funny part - both strange and LOL - I have never in all the
time I've had this stock, seen it mentioned anywhere that Buffett was
associated with having recommended it (except that first or second time when it
was public information). Not ever mentioned in Berkshire Hathaway or his other
portfolios, not mentioned in any of his biographies, and not ever showing up on
any of the supposed valuation screens - repeat, on NO Buffett valuation
screens. Absolutely amazing! (I alluded to this in a previous post here on
Buffett screens - where I said either the people who develop the screens or I
(or both -g-) don't have a clue as to what constitutes a Buffett stock.) Now
you know why I laugh when I read these Buffett posts and see the alleged
possible Buffett stocks.
But there's a lesson here too. Maybe my one and only real Buffett stock is
overvalued now. Where there's one, there may be more. Those great new or
different Buffett stocks are possibly still out there waiting for us. Buffett
is going to get a hold of them, and so can we. Keep looking. Senior.

Best way to emulate Buffet is by owning Buffets company - BRKB or BRKA- its my
largest holding. What many fail to realize is that, despite its core holdings,
its an actively managed portfolio with new acquisitions every year - it also
does some trading to enhance its returns.

Speaking of value, one of my holdings is tanking now to the point where I see
value. RADAF makes electronic games and has just finished its busiest Q - so I
see seasonality in play. Currently selling at trailing p/e of 10. Difficult to
say for sure what forward p/e is but I've heard whispers of well over $2/share
(some as high as $3/share for '98) so forward p/e (given current price of $13)
is about 5 or 6. Earnings have been growing triple digits when compared with
year earlier Qs and trend is likely to continue for next 2 or 3 Qs.

I really disagree for two reasons:

1) Buffett's age - sudden, bad things happen to old people who
have eaten steak their whole lives; should there be a Buffett-medical-
watch web page? It is awfully relevant to many people's investment,
yet his health problems - by now he must have a few - are never
discussed.

2) This is only releveant because Berkshire is trading way above
book value. If something were
to happen to Buffett, how would the stock react? A 30% haircut
maybe? Not to NAV but maybe to a modest premium?

If we're going to put our money with managers, it seems someone
like Ron Baron, who manages a no-load, low-tax, low-turnover
NAV mutual fund that has beaten the S&P in the last 6 mo, 1 yr
3 yr 5 yr and 10 yr periods is a better way to go. If something
sudden happens to him, our investment doesn't plummet.

Hi Paul,

Now that the worst in Asia seems to be over I will like to post some value
ideas from SE Asia, I expect a return of 50-100% this year.

Bangkok Bank BKKPF closed $ 1.50

Siam Darby SIDBY closed $ 0.75

Philippine FPF $ 6.00

Korea fund KF $ 7.25

Indosat IIT $ 14.00

Cheungkong CHEUY $ 4.875

All the stocks picked are considered blue chips in their countries. KF is
trading at a premium of roughly 25%. I see these stocks to benefit from the
bounce back in their oversold markets as well as recovery in their currencies.
The biggest risk IMO is of China devaluing its currency. In two years I expect
return of over 100%.
Relative to US market all these markets are inexpensive.

I would appreciate other views including risks in this portfolio.

> Indosat IIT $ 14.00

Most satellite companies companies seem to float huge debt to build/launch
satellites, so I'd wait for an updated balance sheet/cash flow statement before
investing unless you're sure the currency crisis has not created a problem
(short-term or leng-term).

Stewart,

PT Indosat basically provides international telecom sevs to Indonesia and
partly owned by the Govt. A large portion of its earnings are in dollars. As
far as I know they have not taken on new debt or launched any satellites
recently. Here is a link to their recent financials:

Of all my picks this one is the most risky due to problems in Indonesia. I do
not have any inside information.

Jyoti: Seems like a package of them might work. Personally, I think it's
ridiculous to speculate like this. Your analysis is too relative IMO. Blue
chips in their countries? Right. There can be no blue chip stocks in countries
which themselves are not blue chips. Markets cheap relative to US market? They
should be cheap relative to US. They are so blatently rigged and crooked
compared to our markets (which are more sophistically rigged and crooked -g-).

Paul,

Thank you for your contrary opinion. Here is my reasoning:

Asia was booming earlier thanks to easy money provided by foreigners. Now that
spigot is turned off Asia is not going to disappear from the face of the earth.
Asians will learn the lesson and survive. As far as corruption and croynism it
may be more overt but is probably not much more than here. As you rightly point
out things are more sophisticated here.

Blue chip stock is a relative term. I respectfully disagree that blue chips
exist only in blue chip cointries like USA. My best investment was a Mexican
Telephone company( now Telmex) purchased 17 years ago for fifty cents on a tip
from John Tempelton.(on WSW). Blue chip IMHO is a large financially strong
company with a dominant market share. The company should have in addition a
superior track record.

I perceive the risk to be less because of the valuation of the companies
selected. They are all trading 1/3 rd to 1/4 th from their highs. They are
financially very strong with below average debt ratios. Even Bangkok bank is
expected to pick up market share due to closing of finance companies in
Thailand. Siam Darby is a very old company with hundreds of subsidiaries. All
these companies with revenue stream in billions are household names in their
countries.

I never cared to invest in Asia earlier because of high valuation. To me Asia
was high risk with unreal curriences and very high levels of stock markets.
Right now most Asian countries have a P/E below 10 compared to average P/E here
of over 20.

One of the reasons I am investing 10% of my assets in Asia now because I think
US market will finally correct over 20% this year. In addition I like to buy
things on sale in my personal life as well as in my investment portfolio.

I do understand Asia a little better than an average investor. I was born in
India lived 6 years in Germany and have travelled a lot all over the world. I
think USA is the best country to live and provides the best quality of life in
this world. Ofcourse all parts of USA are not as good as norhern NJ

Best wishes and regards.

Pete,

I agree buying CE funds at premium is not value. However it's a question
whether you want to invest in Korea and how do you take advantage of the
situation in Korea. KF has the least premium compared to other vehicles. The
three Korean ADR's (SKM, KEP, PKX) trade at a premium of over 100% and other
Korean CE funds also have high premiums. There is one open fund MAKOX but it is
not well managed. In addition KF is the oldest fund and is able to buy almost
all its Korean stocks in Korea at Korean prices. To buy KF you must have a
strong conviction that Korean market and currency are deeply undervzlued. I
know Korea have made several trips and think Korean market will bounce back.
Investment in Asia is not without risk and one has to understnad the countries
well before making an investment.

Don,

I agree buying foreign stocks requires more faith than an American stock for
the reasons mentioned by you. However to me buying large foreign stocks is the
same as buying large US stocks. All the news is in the price. I am buying these
stocks as a proxy for the country's market basket. It's not easy buying a
country basket for these countries without paying a huge premium. I will prefer
to buy a good open end mutual fund for these countries if available. I also own
Malaysian Webs and Mathews Korea fund. Normally I do not care to buy any non US
stocks and even now I have invested only a small portion of my funds in them as
a low risk low maintenance speculation. I have spent some time researching
these companies and watched them for a few weeks before pulling the trigger. I
bot Indosat at 11 it's already at 15. Korea fund my average price is 6 1/8, now
it's 7 1/4. I also have small looses in BKKPF and FPF. Overall a plus so far.

I have looked also at AAP, for me it's still not a bargain it's trading at more
than twice book and sales per share. Moreover I think in the austerity climate
prevailing in Asia now, Amway sales and margins will decline in 1998.

Regarding ADR's on NYSE I do not see any big bargains. I would be interested in
hearing of your selections if any. BTW I am looking at Singer SEW a favorite of
several news letters last year. The stock is trading way below book and sales
per share. The turnaround team is in place now.

Hi Pete,

Regarding Korea, I agree it's not a good idea to pay a premium. When I bot KF
the premium was below 10%. The premium changes daily with supply and demand of
stock as well as the currency gyrations. I think the premium will be under 10%
later this year with KF trading over 10.

Before KF I never bot a CE fund at a premium. Usually I look for the discount
in a CE fund, the higher the better. I made an exception for KF because all the
Korean ADR's on NYSE had a premium of over 100%. BTW Korean market has already
bounced about 20% this year. I am hoping it will go up another 50-60% this
year. So far MAKOX has performed better than KF. I own both KF and MAKOX.

Regarding ADR's on NYSE I do not see any big bargains.

I guess I would argue Telebras can be a big bargain. It regularly
oscillates between 90 and 120 (sometimes in a matter of days!)
but there is a timetable, value, and growth prospects. A simple
valuation model - the government expects minimum $20B for its
share (50%) of the company and maximum $30B. This translates to
a range of $125 to $188 in recognized value per share by the
Fall of 1998. Minimal debt, very strong cash flow, cost inefficiecies
just hurting to be squeezed out. A small step outside Brazil's
business cycle. I analyzed it for Microsoft Investor (spotlight,
1/5, http://investor.msn.com ) if you're interested. There I tried to
emphasize an understanding of the government and currency issues as
well, which are very important if one is to feel confident in Brazil.

Shares currently at 104ish. I've been telling people
(http://www.sealpoint.com ) for about 3 months to wait for
under 100 to buy. As privatization nears, I'll raise that target buy price. It
likely will hit the 90's again soon, and at that price,
Telebras is every bit the value of our good old American St Joe's
Paper or Hyde Athletics.

Michael,

I agree TBR is a good stock and may have a great future. The numbers also look
good. There is only one problem, if and when the US market corrects this year
TBR will tank along with all other Latin American ADR's. I also do not consider
Brazilian market a great bargain now. Asian markets have already corrected
60-80%, Latin American markets are yet to have a correction.

My entry price for TBR will be below 70 and I think it might trade below that
level this year.

BTW Mike I am a telecom consultant, understand telecom markets and their growth
a little more than an average guy. I feel a lot of projections on TBR growth is
typical enthusiastic projections of analysts. I do confess looking at TBR last
June trading around $ 76 and passing it. So I am not a very good judge of
value. Because of my telecom background I look extra hard at telecom companies.
On the other hand of the ten or twelve telcom stocks I bot over the years, I
did not make any mistakes.

I also do not consider Brazilian market a great bargain now. Asian markets have
already corrected
60-80%, Latin American markets are yet to have a correction.

My take is that Latin markets don't deserve the shellacking that
Asian markets got. Brazil in particular is acting responsibly and
biting the bullet fiscally. TBR is the most liquid LatAm stock, so
it gets dumped when the general public wants outof LatAm, and it
rises when they want in. Generally, this sentiment parallels
Asia's turmoil and is irrational.

Chile has been LatAm's star. Brazil differs from Chile in that no
significant export industry has developed. Whereas exports to Asia are
a significant part of Chile's economy, the Asian crisis really means
much less to Brazil. If anything, it spurred Brazil into fiscal
tightening - a good thing.

That said, TBR trades at a value discount to its Chilean counterpart,
on a cash flow basis. Its cash flows protect it from the need to
incur debt and hence from most direct effects of short term rate
hikes.

You expect $70? That would mean the government will get
about 11.2B for its share. A B band license just went for over
$1 billion itself. There are 9 A band cellular licenses, which
if anything should command a premium to the B band licenses, coming
out of Telebras. Maybe each won't go for a billion, but you add
in the long distance carrier and the three regionals and they
don't need to go for a billion each to make $70 ridiculous.

I feel a lot of projections on TBR growth is typical enthusiastic projections
of analysts.

I agree. A slow economy will adversely affect that growth even
more. But with 11 month waiting lists for service alleviated
by foreign capital investment, I expect there to be growth
nonetheless, and it won't take much growth at all to make
the current valuation at 5X cash flow and very little debt
attractive.

The privatization and the bids coming down the pipeline put
at timetable on TBR's appreciation, and makes it hard for me
to see a fall to $70 on simple volatility, if that is your
tack. It would take a currency devaluation.

When HK unpegs its dollar, I think we will see another TBR
buying opportunity. $70 should be very unlikely.

Good Investing,
Mike

Mike - nice to see you have noticed St. Joe. I gave it my hardest pitch on this
board at 90-92 three or four weeks ago and loaded up myself. Two days ago it
split 3 for 1 and today it hit 103 pre-split. This is a classic value
investment, but I could not seem to get anybody on a value thread interested -
except Mike. Why? There's still a good deal of upside on this one.

Another one I think is going to run big in 98 is U.S. Can (USC). Perhaps the
most boring business I have ever encountered. Yes, they make cans. Crappy
business? Yes. But it doesn't have to be. Their franchise is in aerosol cans,
which is an oligopolistic market with only three competitors. To date, the
three competitors have totally squandered the opportunity to exert
oligopolistic pricing power. Why? Because U.S. Can's CEO is an idiot. But he is
about to be fired. Several large independent shareholders sit on the Board, and
they are looking for new management. The moment a new guy comes in, I think
prices go up and capital expenditures get cut in half. The company has also
hired Salomon to sell the company, which is extra significant because Salomon
owns 10% of the shares and has a seat on the Board. That's a conflict of
interest I like. This company has the potential to be a huge free cash flow
generator once they cut cap-ex. It trades at 16 and change and I think a
low-ball acquisition price would be 22-24. It is worth over 30. The valuation
is not as simple as St. Joe, but I would be happy to go into more depth on this
one.

The multiples are cheap, but there is a ton of debt. Only a value investor
could love U.S. Can. But clearly there are value investors in the stock. A
couple weeks ago they preannounced that they would miss the fourth quarter
estimate. If Intel did that, the stock would drop ten points. U.S. Can didn't
budge. That's a classic sign of a bottom, when bad news doesn't hurt the stock
price.

This was one of my three picks I posted for the new year. So far, St. Joe is up
over 10%, Public Storage is up about 8%, and U.S. Can is down. I'd still buy
all three if I didn't already own them, but The Can is the only one that is
even more attractive now than two weeks ago. Price targets - St. Joe (SJP) 50,
Public Storage (PSA) 38 and U.S. Can (USC) 26.

This thread is great. Keep it up everybody.

TBR is an outstanding value on its own merits and I would buy it in a heart
beat even at 150 if it was a US company. My concern is with Brazil.I have been
there a few times on buisness, to me they are are a large developing country
with problems similar to SE Asia. IMO the markets and currency have a lot of
risk now. Koreans as you know are one of the large investors in Brazil. They
are trying to take their money home. Moreover when US market catches cold,
latin americans catch flu. I would buy TBR at 100 if I did not expect a
correction in US markets.

BTW do not get overly impressed with the waiting lists. All developing
countries have it. Increasing capacity is capital intensive and pay back is not
all that great. The rate a phone company can charge for telephone is determined
by the local politics and earnings of its citizens. To have a better
understanding of the business compare the revenues and expenses per line with
US RBOC's like Bell Atlantic.

On Hkg unpegging or Chinese devaluation, I would expect complete melt down in
Asia and DJ dropping 1000 points.

Jeffrey,

Chinese devaluation or Hkg peg being broken will force another round of
currency devaluation in SE Asia. IMF will not be able to stop the defauts in
Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Korea. Japanese bank have lent very
heavily in Asia. Defaults will force them to write off their loans. Japan will
be forced to bring their money home from USA. I have seen speculated on other
threads of Japanese owning a trillion dollars in US secrities. Even the
likelyhood of a small portion of these funds repatriated will cause US markets
to tank. Oct 27 was just a foretaste of what can happen to a overvalued market.
No one can really predict what will really happen or what the Fed will do to
stem the waves of selling in US markets. My perception is of course based on
the premise that US markets are way over valued. I can be wrong. I have been
wrong. I got out of the market in 94 and missed a large portion of the greatest
bull market in history. I am a chicken and my pain threshold in investment
losses is very low.

For years I thought Asia was way over valued. In 1996, in my travels in SE Asia
I was shocked to discover how expensive Seoul, Hong Kong Singapore and Bangkok
had become . Every thing was booming, people had a sort of superioity complex
and over confidence. Now the pendulum has gone the other way. It will take some
time for them to adjust and long time to bounce back. Chinese devaluation or
Hkg peg break them even longwer to recover.

BTW I do not expect Hkg peg to go or chinese to devalue this year. Chinese are
very smart people. They will be very cautious and slow in making major monetary
policy changes. In my post I was commeting on mike's remark about Hkg peg and
not predicting it.

Grace,

Korean stock prices every day morning are available on WSJ interactive under
Asian markets-Korea. To compute the premium you have to use the ADR conversion
factor ( ie no of shares per ADR) and use the won to dollar conversion ratio.
Right now the premium for the three NYSE listed ADR's KEP, SKM, PKX is over
100%. I have sold my PKX and KEP and have only 1000 shares left of SKM. I would
not buy the ADR's.

To invest in Korea either MAKOX ( open end fund ) or KF is a good vehicle. KF
premium is reported once a week on saturday's WSJ interactive edition as well
as in Barrons along with other CE funds. During the week I estimate KF premium
based on Seoul Composite index, Won / dollar ratio and daily reported change in
MAKOX nav. I estimate KF premium today to be less than 25%. I will like to
caution you in jumping in Korea right away. My Korean portfolio has gained well
over 30% since Jan 1. Even my MAKOX is up over 28.6%. Wait for a pull back. We
may get it soon.

Thanks, Scott. Nice catch. With a big partner like Foot Locker, Hyde can
probably contribute the product and the design and Foot Locker the dollars.
Perfect. Remember, this is a net-net value investment. So we don't need 20%
growth. All we need to get a 40% profit is for the stock to be valued for the
liquid assets that are already there. I like them odds. This stock is boring
beyond belief, but I think it will get me at least a 25% return within two
years, regardless of what the market does. By the way, that's a good return.
Thats versus a historic average of 9% (yes, your $20 stock goes to 22!) and a
market which I think is 20% lower two years from now.

And speaking of good odds, more on U.S. Can. This morning it was announced that
their closest comparable, Continental Can, got acquired at a 50% premium. I
clearly bet on the wrong horse, but I bought 300 more shares of USC on the
news. The stock hasn't moved yet. The companies are not identical, but they are
similar. USC is clearly for sale in the next year. If not, at the very least
there will be a management change, which is great news given the idiocy of the
current management. USC trades at 16 1/4, or about 5 1/2 times cash flow. I
think free cash flow is going to increase big when capital expenditures go down
according to plan. Based on the Continental Can valuation, the stock is worth
22. I think it is worth closer to 30 to a strategic buyer, and there are
several hunting for acquisitions. Its hard to see how the stock could go much
lower.

Amen. Mike, you amaze me. Even experienced value investors can learn from
reflecting on Michael's essay on value investing. This is a guy who has done
his reading and has integrated multiple value strategies, understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of each. But ultimately, there is one rule, as Mike
has said in more words - BUY THINGS FOR LESS THAN THEY ARE WORTH. Why is that
so hard for people to understand?

I met yesterday with a REIT analyst from a respected Wall Street firm and he
laughed at me when I said I will only invest in REITs that trade at less than
the value of their real estate. Seems like common sense, right? But no, for him
the more important thing is earnings momentum, estimate revision momentum and
"management". He told me that most of his clients don't even know what net
asset value is for the REITs they own. I subtly suggested he not bother calling
me with his picks. Just in case you were thinking that institutional investors
(read: YOUR REIT MUTUAL FUND) are smart.

Jyoti-- I'm hoping you can offer some insight on TWSTY. That it is
trading at roughly 1/2 of book value qualifies it as value (and
makes it interesting). My take is that the company has been bleeding
since inception, and thus the low price to book. Apparantly cable
entered the UK market behind satellite and has had an uphill fight
to gain market share. Recent numbers would indicate that TWSTY is
still losing (spending?) a great deal, but that gross revenues are
expanding noticably. So.... do you see a value here? Regards, Paul

P.S. The story reminds me of TCOMA before the market re-discovered
cable: large losses on infrastructure build-out, nobody wants it.

"Historic average of 9%" - Nice reminder. I think at some point in time, after
15 years of fabulous returns, we are due for a long period of sub-average
returns. I still remember getting into the market in the mid-60's and waiting
15 years for any progress on the Dow. That does not mean to say that you cannot
make money in that environment,
but it is not the same when there is no underlying uptrend. (I also suspect
that the two 15 years periods are not coincidental as an indicator of change
ahead.)

We might well see an average return over the next 10 years of 0-5%. (The only
reason I do not say zero is because the demographic flow of funds is probably
better than in the 1967-82 period.) If so, what does this mean for us? It
certainly means that we do not "have to own stock". A money fund will give you
competitive returns. (In fact,
a close friend asked me for advice just last nite for her aging non-wealthy
parents who just got $25,000 - I suggested Vanguard money fund for time being.)

A 0-5% average stock market return means a large minority of stocks will go
down each year, and most will not have dramatic gains. Therefore, it seems to
me that whether you are a growth or value investor, new funds should only go
into really good ideas, not ones where the best we can say is that "it looks
pretty good". Also, we should be more than average price sensitive since the
next correction will indeed often be just around the corner in this kind of
environment and there will be lots of other opportunities if we miss this one.

Just a little reflection from someone who has seen a lot of markets,
including 1973-4.

Paul,

Your question reg TWSTY:

Telewest is in my UK telecom sourcebook data base. Telewest is in cable and
local telephony. They are investing heavily to upgrade their network and
getting ready for digital TV. They loosing money because of their capital
expenditures. I do not see them reporting positive earnings any time soon. They
are creating an asset in ground and borrowing heavily. I see value in TWSTY as
a takeover speculation. I do not have any idea of their book value. It could be
much higher than stated. You also have to consider that in UK both cable and
telephony are more deregulated than US. IMO digital TV and market for high
speed links to home is still in the future. Pay off in TWSTY as an operating
company is still a few years away.

You can not compare it to TCOMA in USA. TWSTY is a much smaller company
operating in much more competitive environment. BTW I also do not see much
downside risk in current price.

Paul I do not follow this company closely this is just my broad brush
observation. I could be wrong, have been wrong before many many times.

Best wishes and good luck with TWSTY.

Can't resist throwing my two cents in. Although anything is possible short term
re price. The stark reality is that TBR will be privatized meaning there will
be an auction and companies will be viewing the value of TBR as a business as
well as a strategic addition to their existing business. IMHO within a year
this will establish a significant new price level for TBR stock and this is
irrespective of the US, Asian or Latin American markets. I expect
conservatively a 45-50% increase from present levels within 12 months although
I am hoping it will be eight months, and the only downside i see is possible
political risk in Brazil, which i don't know how to quantify. I agree that the
US market is overpriced and that Asia may be slow to recover but this has
little to do with the value of TBR's many franchises not to mention it's 3.5
million cellular subscribers, an operation that has been growing 60% annually.
It is also possible that the auction price exceeds all expectations because how
many future TBRs are there going to be?

I am also very positive on a Brazilian bank UBB that seems to me to be very
underpriced, but in this case there is no catalyst for establishing a new price
level, so while i own it too, I don't know when it will go up, just that it
will eventually. In the meantime it's selling for around book and has a 15%
return on equity. I'm willing to wait.
BTW I aprreciate your analysis of the price premiums for the Korean ADR's. I
had no idea that such inefficiencies could exist. I sthere anyway to make
investments in Korea withoug paying a premium ? Perhaps a company that owns
pieces of Korean companies?

Hi Armin,

Thank you for your ideas on TBR and UBB. My opinion of TBR was just a broad
brush remark not an informed opinion. Looks like you and Mike have done more
home work. Last time I looked at TBR was in the summer of 1996 and passed it.
It doubled after that. So much for my analytical skills. TBR as a company
perhaps has changed since then and may be it's a better buy now. I will spend
some time looking at it in depth.

On Korea I think the best buy may be MAKOX. Even though it's up a lot in last
two weeks , there is a good chance it will go up a lot more. KF between 6-6 1/2
may also be a good buy. The premium and discounts reported by the fund are not
always correct. This is due to the daily gyrations in Korean currency and time
difference. I will also not rush into Korean market it's already up a lot this
year. Depending upon the news we may get a small correction.

I do not know of any company owning pieces of Korean companies.

Thank you again for tips on Brazil.

Best wishes and good investing.

Carmine,

SPTR is a good pick. Spectran is a small fiber optic cable manufacturer. I have
known this company for some time, recommended their products. Fiber optic cable
demand is down because of all the problems in Asia. Corning-GLW is the dominant
market player and its stock is also selling near yearly lows. SPTR is
considered a fringe player in the industry.

Prospects for fiber cable buisness do not look great this year. Long term SPTR
is a buy. IMO you may get a chance to pick it at even lower prices. Of course
the stock can always shoot up on take over speculation.

Where, in your opinion, is telecom going next few years? Not whether it will be
growing or not because that's pretty well a given, but in what areas? Do you
see major growth Internationally? Where? Etc.

With the growth, where's the best investment areas? I don't feel it's in the
carriers, but in the hardware - but what hardware? You think fiber optics will
be weak, why and what areas will be strong? Not asking for stock picks, just
general projections. I like the sector, but am trying to figure out what areas
show the most promise.

I bought both CWP and FON last year and got nice returns until (IMO) they
became overvalued to potential. Did some research on the sector then but
haven't looked at it recently.

Thanks,

Ron,

Telecom's growth potential as you pointed out is well known All major telecom
stock's p/e also reflect that. On fiber, the next major growth area is fiber to
homes. Eventually almost all homes will have fiber strands coming to home. This
will provide almost infinite bandwidth. On transmission the trend is toward ATM
( Asynchronous transfer mode) and switching equipment will be upgraded to
handle it. Mobile is also likely to keep growing. Networking and switching is
another major growth area. I also expect long distance domestic and
international rates to keep coming down.

For investment it's hard to find companies which are truly undervalued. IMO all
major equipment makers ie Lucent, Northern Telecom, Siemens, Ericsson,
Motorola, Alcatel, NEC and Nokia are fully valued. I think the best opportunity
will be in niche players where competitive pressures are likely to be limited.
Examples will be ANDW, ADCT, DIGI, GLW, TLAB, GEMS, ECILF. I intend to buy them
on any major correction in stock market.

Among telecom operators, I feel almost all are well priced. I think big growth
in revenue will be amongst the non US carriers. I like HKT, TBR, TDP, PHI and
even CHL. Unfortunately non of them are in my buying range at the moment.

Ron my strategy with telecom companies have been to buy them on temporary set
backs. Example will be TLDCF which dropped a lot recently due to their Asian
problems. Short term there is some risk in stock. Long term they should be
okay.

CWP and FON are fine companies and appear fully valued here.

Best wishes,

re: Amerco (aka U Haul) I agree with Michael. The Barrons number was too high.
I think the assets are probably worth 35 as is, maybe 50-55 under sensible
management, which is not the case now. Now that the stock is down again, its
probably a buy, but I will not get too excited until I see management either
doing something different or stepping aside. Having done thorough research and
deciding to stay on the sidelines, my dream scenario would be that they put the
company up for sale. The stock would probably jump instantly to 33-35, so I'd
miss that gain, but that is when it would really be a steal, because you would
probably see 50 within six months.

But if I had a lot of cash, I'd probably buy it now. I just think there are

Maybe I should have doublechecked before buying in at $16. Could you show me
the math for the current premium on PKX? I had read in Smartmoney that the
"normal" premium was about 60%, so I thought I was getting a bargain, though
that's certainly debatable. I also want to offer a contrarian view to KF. After

I thought to mention General Magic GMGC $ 1 3/8 here in case of someone is
interested in a small cap idea with limited downside and signficant upside:
This is a wireless communication software company with a potential killer apps:
Serengenti -- an integrated wireless communication service designed to help
carriers to increase their airtime and to help mobile professionals to manage
all the voice mail, email, fax and contact information from one place while
they are all the road.

Basic data: 26.8 mil O/S, mkt cap about $37 mil with $30 mil cash.
Where would the Magic go from here? I am looking at the following positive
events to occur in the next few months:
- the license of their Agent technology, possibly in Q1
- one or two strategic investments to increase the profile of the company as
well as its financial strength;
- extended field trial starting in mid to late Feb with 2000 users
- expect carrier endorsement before or during the trial
- more insider buying: most recent buying occured on Dec 6, one director paid
$1.88 for 2500 shares (M. Kalogris, CEO of Triton Communications)
- lastly, increased media coverage as more carriers are looking into solutions
like Serengeti to increase their airtime.
Bottom line: for a stock trading near its cash, GMGC has a pretty good story.
20c downside, a few DOLLARS upside ...

GES has earnings estimates of about $1.00 for '97 and '98. I imagine the stock
will recover from a P/E of 6 to a P/E of 10-12 on the first or second positive
earnings comparison to the year earlier quarter. It may be 2-3 quarters away,
but with a 50-100% appreciation potential just from stabilizing their business,
the stock has a lot of upside.
I like OO also. Whenever a president of a company buys another 1,000,000
shares, he is either a fool, or a person to share a risk with. I think OO will
turn out to be a good long term investment. The Sunglass Hut debacle is behind

Deswell Industries is falling for no good reason but that
it announced its calling its warrants. I talked with the CEO,

to growth. Micron Electronics I bought in again at 9 5/8, and
I like the prospects. It's the cheapest box maker in an
industry that has been pummeled. GTW just reported

Hyde Athletics just announced a restructuring of its Saucony
