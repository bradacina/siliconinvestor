EAS - According to the database I use, the average PE for the industry is 17x.
I figured 15x to be slightly conservative. On a P/BV basis, the group is at
1.8x versus EAS' 1.1x. The stock isn't as cheap on FCF, but the yield is higher
than average.

I agree this is one of my more conservative ideas as I believe returns in the
stock market will be lower this year. I want to add some defensive names to my
portfolio and move up a bit in market cap size.

BEBE story that is a little startling to me. I like to see ownership in a
company, but it is true the chairman owns 74%?

Under his Rule 10b5-1 Plan, Mr. Mashouf may sell up to 2,700,000 shares over a
period of approximately ten months. If Mr. Mashouf completes all the planned
sales of shares under his Rule 10b5-1 Plan, he would beneficially own
approximately 65,000,000 shares (approximately 71%) of bebe's outstanding
stock.

bruwin,

I'll add my voice to the chorus that think your posts have been overbearing and
condescending. You've had some interesting things to say, and I think your
perspective on "value" is worth airing. But lighten up a little.

From the style of your posts, it isn't clear to me what you're hoping to
achieve. You poo-poo traditional value metrics yet are deliberately vague about
your own strategy in deference to the esteemed Dr Karl Posel, whom no one here
has heard of and whose books are all out of print or unavailable.

Stock screens are just that, screens, and no substitute for actually learning
about a company's business. I don't think anyone here would sanely suggest
blindly buying stocks on the basis of a couple metrics. So talking about
whether this ratio is better than that ratio is sophistry until you get down to
specific examples.

I think you would get along better with people here if you kept your posts
shorter and more concrete. For example how about discussing a stock or two that
meet your criteria yet would be soundly rejected using traditional metrics, or
vice versa? And cut out all the "I'm not suggesting my ideas are better"
verbiage; if you didn't think your ideas had merit then you wouldn't be here!

You are a strange fish.

On the one hand, you've mentioned that you don't want to give away too many
details of your strategy, because it sells books for Dr Posel and you also sell
this information by some unspecified means (newsletter? consulting? other?).
The book you reference is 17 years old, out of print, and nearly unobtainable

you also are not much up for discussing stock choices because you "don’t dip

I'll "bite".

First, for disclosure, I own this stock and it is extremely thinly traded. If
that offends anyone, please click the next button.

The company is Diamond Hill Investment Group (DHIL) and it has a market
capitalization of approximately $50mm and average shares traded of about 2000
per day.

So, what's so interesting about this company?

They are an investment manager which manages several mutual funds which are
rated 4 and 5 stars per morningstar. The investment management business is one
where the manager has quite a bit of fixed costs. In the 1st Quarter of 2005,
DHIL garnered enough Assets Under Management to overcome these fixed costs and
has shown an operating profit in the first two quarters of last year. In the
3rd Quarter, they would've shown an operating profit, also, but the company
accrued a bonus which wiped out all profits.

Assets under management have been growing quite rapidly. As of December 2004,
the company had about $500mm under management. In December 2005, the company
had $1.5B under management.

As for the second negative (first was the bonus accrual), their funds carry a
sales load at this point in time. However, the majority of their AUM growth has
come by means of individually managed accounts.

From:bruwin
Hi CrazyPete ... Unfortunately you’ve drawn several conclusions without knowing
all the facts and taking good care to read exactly what I’ve said.

What I've said, in so many words, was the fact that my Investment Strategy was
based, to a very large extent, on what I learnt from Dr. Karl Posel. I've put
all of that into an Investment Package which I’ve sold to Investors for a
once-off fee. Included in the Package is an e-book copy of Dr. Posel’s first
book, ‘Winning on the JSE’. This book contains his first foray into advising
others what specific criteria to take into account before buying a stock. Since
he published that book, he’s seen the need to revise one or two of those
original criteria, plus he and I have added several new criteria, giving a
total of 12 in all that should be considered. My Package contains ALL of his
latest thinking, with those revisions, on the subject of stock market
investment, as well where to find vitally necessary stock screening and
financial statement information, free of charge, on the Net.

The point to remember is the fact that there are other enthusiastic Investors
out there who don’t necessarily have the Fundamental Analytical knowledge or
experience that the likes of you or other Board members may have, ... or may
have accumulated.
According to their feedback to me, they’ve found our information of great help
and they’ve all reported making more consistent profits than in the past.

With regard to books being "out of print", and your other inferences, I had to
get Dr. Posel’s permission to use and make public his works. He would therefore
share in the commercial venture. In addition, it wouldn’t be fair to those who
have paid for the information, to now find that it’s being freely disseminated
elsewhere on the Internet !
And ‘No’, it doesn’t sell books for Dr. Posel because he’s no longer interested
in involving himself in all that goes with re-prints, re-publishing etc.. for
not that much of a return for the writer. Most of a book’s profit goes to
publishers, printers, distributors etc.. You’d have to know him better to
appreciate his own motives and priorities in this regard.

However, many of his books are held by Libraries, both public, tertiary and in
Universities. He still gets many calls from enquiring investors and business
students.
He is currently busy writing a third book as a natural follow on to ‘Winning on
the JSE’ and ‘Enjoy Investing on the Stock Market’. He does it, these days,
largely for his own interest and he may or may not publish it for the reasons I
mentioned. I am encouraging him, however, to disseminate it via the Internet as
an E-book which will incur far less "loss" to third parties !

I "don’t dip into and out of the Market" that often because that’s the nature
of my Investment Strategy, as I attempted to outline in (a), (b) and (c) of my
Message 22953 to Paul Senior, and in 22853. I prefer to hold fewer, high
quality stocks which produce consistent profits and value for their
shareholders. In this regard you will find reference to 3 such stocks, HANS,
PDX and TWIN which earned 73% in 5 months, 34% in 10 months and 111% in 6
months respectively. In South Africa I've held 3 stocks for quite a while now.
These are DAW, DGC and WBO. They've collectively earned over 123% in 15 months.
Maybe that’s why others have been prepared to pay for my Investment Package !!

I’ve provided details of my comments about stocks in my Message 22847 to Suma.
I’ve been prepared to say what I like and what I don’t like .... and why.

A point to remember is that our strategy would go through over 8000 US
Industrial type stocks and narrow them down to, say, 6 to 10, which we would
then consider for purchase. This is contrary to the strategy of others, such as
maybe Dale Baker, who are proponents of holding larger, diversified portfolios
for risk and other considerations. It's our contention that this tends to
dilute profits.

I’m not, as a general rule, going to enter into this form of discussion in the
future. If you’d like to communicate with me in this regard, you’ll find me at
:-
bruwin90@yahoo.com
All communication to that address is done in strict confidence.

Best wishes with your investments in 2006.

Muwis123, I haven't gone back to look at these reinsurers since Katrina. You
and I both have followed IPCR; It's moved up a little since last mentioned
here. Platinum I never bought, although I recall it being mentioned as a value
buy around when it became public. This one too, looks like it survived the
hurricanes:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=PTP&t=5y

I'm a little gun-shy about these reinsurers. The "rare events", when they
occur, can bite.

I still have a bunch of insurance stocks though.

I'm surprised that Massachusetts auto insurer CGI ($56.68) is down where it is
- near an annual low. I've had this one since at least 1999:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=8977112&srchtxt=cgi

I've added shares occasionally: looks like last at $54.19 on 10/28/5. I also
still have shares of competitor SAFT.

OTOH, I've been surprised by the upside moves in AFG. Neither a fan of the
company, nor its business practices nor the insider control (Lindners), I
bought primarily because the Lindners were buying shares somewhat aggressively.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=21186735&srchtxt=afg

Recently I've been cutting back my position.

I also have positions in medmal insurers and title insurers.

ASIDE:

I want to mention FAF because it's a stock where I guessed it was fully valued
somewhere around $30 by which I recall selling most of my shares. This stock
provides another example to me of where it sometimes pays to keep a stub
position anyway just to see what happens.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=FAF&t=5y

I occasionally see media pundits and "experts" who say, "get rid of those
miniscule positions that clutter up your account and/or distract you. They are
too small to affect your results." My experience is that these stubs can work
out VERY well (sometimes) and even provide percentage returns greater than most
other stocks that one holds - and that's just from the time when the majority
of the stock gets sold and only the stub is left. The perfect example - in my
portfolio anyway - is a tiny stub holding of AAPL. Not much dollars - but my
point is that I believe every little bit helps.

Dave, I'd like to believe I've got a better way to look at these asset
managers, but I'm not there yet.

Here's the rule: Asset managers are overvalued if you have to pay more than 2%
of their assets-under-management for the stock.

Here are the issues:

1. I don't know anything about DHIL.

2. DHIL assets-under-management figure is growing almost enormously. The rule
does not take into account how much assets DHIL might have under control by
year-end '06.

3. As regards the rule above, there's no clarification of assets. There's a
heck of a lot more money to be earned by firms in managing $1B in equity
(stocks), than can be got in managing $1B of assets that comprise government
bonds. So an all-equity firm should be valued much higher than an all-bond firm
- with appropriate adjustments made for firms which have managers of both
types. The rule doesn't do this though.

4. I'm a guy with opinions and now a rule. No references, no historical
support, no nothin'.
-------------
My cutoff point is actually less than 2%. But 2% will work here. 2% of $1.5B =
$30M. Stock's at $53M (i.e. the market cap). Therefore, stock is more than
fairly valued at current price.

---------

Stock's had a good run in past 12 months, assets under management could
increase further, stock could scoot much higher. I'll use my rule though, and
I'll pass. Jmo, I could be wrong.

 In this regard you will find reference to 3 such stocks, HANS, PDX and TWIN

This was never the case, i found this stock using a low P/B screener (which
incidentally is a metric that your are trying to convince the board that it's
worthless). For the record,my first post about TWIN is here:

Spekulatius, at the time I, personally, hadn't uncovered TWIN as I hadn't been
doing much in the way of specific stock screening when we discussed it.

When YOU mentioned it (and here we must give credit where credit is due), I had
a look at it and it fitted my criteria, especially with regard to its low P/E
ratio. Its Turnover looked like it could do with an increase but the other
criteria compensated for that. This was borne out by the fact that its T/O
increased quite nicely when it published its next set of results in Sept. ’05.
What’s more, its EPS nearly tripled from the previous Quarter.
You may recall that I stated that its P/E should be around 16 and at that stage
it was 10, which in my opinion made it undervalued and an attractive buy.

I believe I stated at the time that I regarded HANS as a stock that had
achieved more than TWIN over a shorter period. However, that didn't make TWIN a
stock that should not still be considered for purchase, which time has proved
correct.

You say that you found TWIN by using a low P/B screener. Fair enough. However,
I wouldn't be surprised if TWIN wasn't the only stock that came up in that
screen. Have any of the others done as well as TWIN ? If not, then maybe P/BK
wasn't the "ruling criteria".

You may have read the following in my Message 23012 to the Board,... "Well, I
suspect that, because they (the Board Members) are primarily Fundamental
Analysts, their stock selection criteria very likely also includes sound
Fundamental criteria, apart from those ratios. It's possible, therefore, that
their successes are far more as a result of those sound Fundamental criteria
than they have anything, or much to do, with P/S, P/BK etc..."
Maybe there’s some truth in that. Of course, in the opinion of others, maybe
there isn’t.

The question I've posed on this Board is .... "What properties do P/S, P/BK,
FCF contain that will contribute to finding Value in a stock ?"
So far no one seems willing to answer that question with a straightforward,
unambiguous answer.
All I get is an ongoing reference to how rude I am, the size of my ego, my lack
of humility, and other completely irrelevant comments.
Don't shoot the messenger guys, .... just answer the question !!

And rest assured, Spekulatius, no offense was taken !

RUTH. Restaurant stocks.

I hadn't considered RUTH as a Katrina play, but it might be.

Here's a brief update on the restaurant stocks I have:

Landry's. I've held a position for several years. Trimming back now. Several
Florida seafood restaurants on the water. Maybe hurt by Kratrina, others. CEO
moving LNY into casinos (He purchased Las Vegas Golden Nugget). He believes his
family has some expertise/skills in this business.

CKR. Stock did great there for a while when Paris Hilton ads started. Bring
back Paris and those ads! Otherwise, I'd not add to position at this time.

SWRG. Initially I liked the management style of Alan Stilman. Some grumbling on
Yahoo about his running the company for his own benefit. In past, I believed
real estate values were understated (Las Vegas property). Now I'm not so sure.
Company just seems like it always shows more potential than profits. I've been
trimming.

JAX. Supposedly like a Houston's. I've got to get to one of the restaurants and
see for myself their business operations. Have a few shares of stock. Hard
enough for me just to hold on --- I'd not be a buyer given my lack of knowledge
here.

ARKR. Ancillary play on gambling: Vegas casino hip restaurants, Florida casino
fast-food restaurants. These nightclub/restaurants go into and out of fashion
though. OTOH, company pays nice div. and ltd. = 0. Insider is controlling
stockholder. (A plus and a minus.) Thinly traded stock. I'm adding if I can get
shares @$26.50. (Fri. range was 27.701 - 29.85.)

FRS. Big Boy and Golden Corral. Company has a long history and in past couple
of years has stalled out. I'd not add. Might sell and move on.

RUTH. The restaurants seem crowded (my anecdotal experience). Nice brand
awareness. Stock price maybe now adequately reflects that - high p/e. OTOH,
stock price is still below recent IPO price. I'll hold my few shares.

STAR. Has some cash, no ltd. Dividend. Revenue maybe has stalled. I hold a few
shares on the presumption that maybe stock has bottomed.

re stock screening - when i do a stock screen (I typically use the yahoo java
screener) my intention is to come up with a bunch of stocks (typically 30-50)
that are by some metrics cheap. in the particular case of the screen i used for
TWIN, P/B was one of the criteria, other were P/S, PE and debt/equity (as far
as i remember). Most of the stocks that meet the screening criteria are rubbish
and don't even pass a "30 sec smell" test. I use several different preset
screens and tend to tweak them to get more or less hit's. From time to time, I
have found stocks that have done very well, mostly because they had (in
additions to being cheap) some things going for it that were not evident ion
the screening criteria. In the case of TWIN for example, i noticed that the
company was supplying the oil industry (gears for oil drills) which i assumed
to be a very strong business.

I see, Spekulatius. In my opinion, from that list P/E and Debt/Equity are the

If you're prepared to do it, you can show us a list of all the criteria in that
screen and I'll make my own comments about which ones I, personally, would use.
Maybe you could then only include those ones in a screen and see what it comes
up with in terms of the calibre of stocks.

Your last comment regarding TWIN's potential in the gears for oil drill market
makes sense. One of the 12 criteria we consider is, "Have some knowledge of the
company concerned. Satisfy yourself about its history, track record and actual
modus operandi". Sounds obvious, but one wonders how many ardent Technical

Those are interesting P/E numbers for RUTH Dave ?!
My calculation, for a trailing 12 month P/E, gives me a current P/E =
2010/(2+12+7+11) = 62.8.

Talk about being in trouble, I see RUTH just managed to extricate itself from
Technically Insolvency within the last 3 months with additional paid in

E_K_S. Thanks for the update. I'll comment on all the stocks you mentioned...so
a long post -g-

I generally review the Burkenroad reports a couple/three times per year looking
for ideas. I find mostly that the "underfollowed" companies they write-up have
previously been discussed here or the stocks aren't a fit for me because they
seem too expensive for me or I don't understand the rationale the authors make.

Occasionally I spot something. I bought GIFI which I found there.

http://www.burkenroad.org/04-05%20pdfs/GULF%20ISLAND%20(GIFI)%20Spring05.pdf

I have an order in to add to my few shares tomorrow. I find GIFI to be very
expensive, perhaps not even a value stock. OTOH, relative to other companies
I'm looking at in the sector in which I rightly or wrongly place GIFI, GIFI is
relatively undervalued (I am guessing). Of course, investing by relative value
is very dangerous. But the sector is hot, and I will make a speculative add.

I was wrong to pass on TMI. It's still expensive, but has strong operating
earnings. I'll relook.

------
My idea about investing in oil/gassers/e&p/etc. has been to start with very
small positions in several (many, actually -g-) and let the market tell me
which are the good ones. My presumption is the good stocks will be bid up in
price and the poor will languish and be left behind. My underlying assumption
is that the market is a better determinant of value than I am as regards this
complicated area. At this time (2003-2005) - unlike in almost every other
sector I'm involved with - I have assumed the "better" stocks (i.e. the stocks
bid up in price) are the "better" buys and so I have ADDED to positions of
stocks that have been bid up, and have sold or held stocks that have not
performed.

As regards PQ and EPL, I hold shares of both. But because these stocks have not
performed well - relatively, (and because EPL's been hurt by Katrina), I've
been only holding PQ and selling some EPL - based on my strategy in the
previous paragraph. Of course, a value player could certainly argue that the
price/value has improved for the companies because their stock prices are
relatively low, and that the companies are real takeover candidates. It's
certainly possible.

I've sold a little SGR that was bought in 2002. SGR keeps getting contracts for
rebuilding in the Gulf: "Shaw Group said Friday first-quarter profit tripled
from a year ago, lifted by hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from
cleanup and reconstruction contracts in the wake of two devastating
hurricanes." Positive stuff about SGR now too as regards coal/nuclear plant
capabilities and possibilities. I don't know if all this is already priced into
the stock. I don't believe I'll add more shares, but I won't sell anymore now
either.

Local bank stocks in Gulf look fairly valued to me. I suspect the bigger
regionals and nationals will have more capabilities and opportunities to expand
and improve their competitive position in the area than the small guys.

That was a good overview Paul. It seems that most of the time you have already
discovered the "undiscovered" value stocks. From my quick review, I do like PQ
(PETROQUEST ENERGY). It's up over 100% for the year (FY 2005) so it appears
that Katrina did not really affect the companies operations.

My biggest concern is I believe that a Katrina event is not a hundred year
event any more but rather may be a more common event in the future (i.e. earth
warming changes. Therefore, I wonder if the market is pricing in future
disasters that will result in higher operating costs for companies located on
this region? This is another reason to own a company that has geographical
diversification.

The last thing I want is to buy a company that was impacted by Katrina and find
out that another more powerful storm will hit in 18-24 months.

re BAC. BAC makes alot of mergers (the latest being MNBA) that are dilutive to
shareholders and weaken their balance sheet. C is currently prohibited from
doing major mergers which i think actually is to their benefit. Their balance
sheet is growing stronger as measured by their leverage (tangible book has
grown to 9% of their balance sheet) so even so their earnings have been
stagnant, the company is stronger.

Suma, re BAC. Yes BAC is a slow stock. I got more BAC shares when my MNBA
shares were just recently exchanged.

BAC's up a bit, maybe it's time to sell. BAC's had, in past, a decent history
for integrating its many acquisitions. Dividend's been raised every year for
past 28 or so years. Div. yield is over 4% now. Stock's doubled almost from
five years ago. For me, I have only a small position, so it's easy or easier
for me to continue holding on,which I'm intending to do.

GE of course is not a value stock. If big caps come back into vogue as some are
predicting, GE will participate (I assume). OTOH, I know of people who've
recently given up on the stock - just got tired of not seeing any gains with
it. Same situation there with MSFT, in which I do have a position. I'm trying
to hold on to MSFT, but if I had GE, I'd be looking to sell at least some
shares.

Jmo, I'm no expert, and I've been wrong many, many times. I respond to your
post, but it's all jmo, and I acknowledge that on the thread there may be
several or many with better perspective and insight as regards these stocks
(GE, MSFT and BAC) than I have.

re CECO> I stay clear of CECO. The schools with problems tend to get stuck in
the mud for a long time (look at COCO). An educations institution is dependent
on it's reputation and I imagine that criminal machinations would deter
students or capable teachers. Also loss of accreditation would directly hit
CECO's highest growth and highest margin business, the online education .A PE
of 15 makes APOL only 20-25% cheaper than APOL, which does not have any issues.
My conclusion is that it's not worth to bet on CECO but rather go with a
quality company like APOL.

Yes, Spekulatius, I would agree that the aspect of CECO's accreditation is a
crucial one. Personally, I wouldn't buy until that was resolved to my
satisfaction.
As it happens, Mr. X compared CECO to 3 other rivals, viz. APOL, DV and ESI.
Here are several of HIS pertinent figures as of the middle of Dec. 2005 ...

P/E ratios :-
CECO = 15
APOL = 27
DV = 48
ESI = 27

Gross Margins :-
CECO = 69%
APOL = 58%
DV = 46%
ESI = 54%

In my opinion, CECO currently has the best looking fundamentals, but it
certainly needs to sort out its accreditation problems. I'd be surprised if the
company wasn't fully appreciative of that aspect, and very likely would be
pulling out all the stops in that regard.
Time, as they say, will tell !!

CECO's gross margins look better because they allocated costs differently than
APOL. For CECO the G&A expenses are higher than the (direct) educational
expenses, for APOL the G&A is only about 125 of the direct expenses - so if we
assume that both run an similar business it's clear that these companies break
down their direct and indirect costs differently. For all i can see APOL has an
higher EBITDA margin which is what really counts 9at least for me).

Also note that CECO growth YoY growth for the last quarter only was about 10%
and slowed down considerably, whereas APOL growth still was about 20%.

From:bruwin
Yes, Spekulatius, I'm an Operating Margin man as well !!
You're correct about their EBITDA ratios, APOL:CECO as 34%:21%.
(The reference to Gross Margin was because that's what Mr. X included. He also
mentioned P/S, P/BK etc.., but I'm sure you know my personal opinion of those
by now !)
There again, CECO has a better debt/equity ratio (1.9%:11%), with reference to
the use of "multi-metrics" etc..!
The other clincher for me are their P/E ratios. But be that as it may....
I suppose it could also be expected that CECO's T/O growth for the last Quarter
or two may be suffering due to its latest accreditation problems. One will have
to see what develops after its problems are finally resolved.

Rest assured, I'm not plugging CECO for a current buy. Based on the recent
quality of its fundamentals, and its current low P/E, I presented it as a stock
with possibly the largest potential percentage price increase IF it resolved
its current issues.

This Mr.X probably does a lot more stock research than I do, and probably has a
lot more in the way of research facilities, plus research time, than I have as
well.
He says he focuses on "Undervalued" stocks which I thought would be in line
with what many SI members focus on as well.

I try to give a brief summary of what motivates, or attracts, him about the
stock. I also sometimes express my own opinion about the stock as well. I've
put certain of his recommendations on a watch list, and should any of them meet
my own personal criteria, I would certainly consider buying them, and possibly
informing SI as well.

Sorry to read that you don't understand it, or you aren't interested. Based on
several e-mails I've received from Board Members, there appear to be others who
feel somewhat differently to the way you've described.

And why don't you post those stocks from different sources and leave it up to
Members to accept or reject them ? Who knows, there could be some real winners
amongst them.

Personally, I believe it's the quality of a stock that counts, not whether or
not it comes from "some unknown party".
Based on the discussions and debate I've previously had with Board Members
regarding stock selection criteria, I would have thought that they were more
than capable of "substantiating" the Value, or lack of it, in any stock
presented in this Forum.

Rest assured, for what it's worth, I'll still post my own personal stock

Yes, AOB probably have until March '06 to report their Q3 results.
However, the web site I usually refer to, when checking a company's results,
showed that their latest set of results, i.e. their Q2's, were "loaded" on the
27th. October 2005. Their previous Q3 results were "loaded" on the 29th.
November 2004.
That's why I suspected that their latest Q3's would appear about 3 months after
27th. October 2005, which should make it late January 2006.

In my experience, and opinion, when a company has "good news" to report, they
generally bring it out early rather than later. "Bad news" tends to be left
until the last minute before it's presented to the public.

We'll have to just wait and see what AOB does in this regard.

AOB reported Q3 (not Q2) on nov 14th, as follows:

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/051114/20051114006105.html?.v=1

they announced on nov 7th that they would do so, so obviously no results were
"loaded" anywhere on oct 27th (i have no idea what you are referring to on nov
29th of 2004)

they filed their 10-Q on nov 14th as well

http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=american+oriental&CIK=&filenum=
State=&SIC=&owner=include&action=getcompany

small companies almost always take longer than 3 months between reporting Q3
and reporting their year end results, so it's doubtful that they would report
even 3 months after the Q3 report, which would be mid february

it is possible that they will preannounce, but they had strong reports in each
quarter of 2005 and they never preannounced any of those, so why would they
start now? the only time i have seen them preannounce was in mid 2004

it has never been a matter of good news vs. bad news, they have waited until
the last day on every quarter for the past several years, and most of those
reports have been "good news"
