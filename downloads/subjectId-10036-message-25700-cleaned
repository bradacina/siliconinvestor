seems pretty reasonable, especially when combined with selling the feb 22.50
call for another .20, almost an extra dividend while still having a couple
bucks' upside

i've read elsewhere that there are limits to how much of this type of income
you can receive in an IRA without owing some kind of tax...can anyone shed some
light on that situation, so that i don't run afoul of some regulation?

thanks

I will chime in with an uninformed opinion (I am not knowledgeable in these
IRA/trust/tax laws.)

Afaik there's no limit in this type of income (Canadian trust) that can be
received in an IRA that would trigger additional USA federal tax consequences.
(I haven't a clue about state income taxes other than my own state, where I
believe the same (no limit that triggers additional taxes). I've never come
across such limits anyway for federal or my state.

Now if you are talking about limited partnerships --- L.P. stocks bought and
held in an IRA---, then there IS a limit as to how much 'income' you can
receive from them. Go over that limit in a given year ($1000/yr???) and you
will have (if you are to be legal) paperwork to file and may have to pay tax
(on amount over $1000??)

Again, all just my opinion. Subject to dismissal/guffaws/changes/ and
modifications by people here who actual do know the applicable laws and
procedures.

I have considered LUV off and on over the past month, but since US Airways bid
for Delta is only 10.5 billion I fail to see how LUV is worth 12.5 billion. It
may turn out, but looking at the relatively overcrowded industry with fairly
poor operating earnings, I fail to see how it would be a value play.

I saw the article as well, but just because the rest of the airlines went up
isn't necessarily a good reason to buy the "best of breed". I fly Southwest a
lot and other then their antiquated ABC line boarding scheme, they are a good
airline. That said, I am not comfortable when insiders are selling and the best
reason is because the industry group went up. Same could be said of dot-com's
in 1999.

Now if LUV dropped into the 10 or 9 range, that would be worthwhile.

Certainly LUV isn't a classic value stock. But there are positives for the
company going forward, some of which were mentioned in the article. These are
the reasons I purchased the stock.

1. As you said, best of breed
2. Contraction in the sector

Well, I'm not a fan of Mr. Zell, the head guy of Capital Trust.

I bought stock in two of his companies in which he was buying stock at the
time. Both subsequently went right into bankruptcy. One was a cruise ship
company that was unusual in being USA based and therefore unique in that it
could travel between USA ports (Hawaii and mainland)without having to stop at
foreign ports. Another was a restaurant chain, Chart House I believe. He took
over and subsequently he/his surrogate led the company right into bk.

Maybe it's just reits/real estate where he has the magic touch. CT could've
been a buy and maybe still is.

For me, with my history with Mr. Zell's companies, I'd rather pass than maybe
get burned yet a third time. I doubt I would've been a buyer of CT had I even
seen CT at its lower prices.

I bought some FSP for my stepmothers account at $20.02 last week.

Ive been considering adding more myself but its already over 7% of my IRA and
Im a big believer in diversification so I probably wont. Unless it drops
further. I really dont know why its down now.

I did revert back to my early ways almost 20 years ago and bought a regular
mutual fund and set up monthly automatic investments in an amount of about 8%
of my initial investment as well as reinvested dividends.

Fidelity Balanced Fund is a morningstar 5 star fund and was reccomened in this
months "consumer reports".

Has 3,5 and 10 year annualized returns of about 10% or slightly more.

In a way, this is me kind of giving up on myself being able to find the kind of
stocks I used to. Maybe Im just more conservative nowadays. Maybe all my losers
over the years, while dwarfed by the winners, are keeping me conservative.

SPOR announced a dutch tender offer. I was lucky enough to buy more earlier in
the day before the announcement was made.

But, now I am really puzzeled about what to do. dstern , you still following
SPOR ?

They mention possibly going dark later on. And there have been signs of a
pretty impressive turnaround.

And none of the insiders are selling any in the dutch tender.

Looking back about a year and a half ago, BAMM did one of these. The stock has
doubled since then.

Anyone else still holding SPOR and/or have any insight ?

Sport-Haley, Inc. Board Authorizes Modified "Dutch Auction" Tender Offer
Wednesday December 27, 2:42 pm ET

DENVER, CO--(MARKET WIRE)--Dec 27, 2006 -- Sport-Haley, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPOR -
News) (the "Company") today announced that the board of directors has approved
commencing a modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer under the terms of which the
Company will repurchase up to 472,000 shares of its common stock at a price per
share not greater than $5.30 and not less than $4.80. This would represent the
repurchase of approximately 17 percent of its outstanding common stock as of
December 15, 2006. The tender offer is expected to commence on January 3, 2007,
and to expire, unless extended, at 12:00 midnight Eastern Standard Time on
February 1, 2007. Under the tender offer, shareholders will be able to indicate
how many shares and at what price within the Company specified range they wish
to tender.

Based on the number of shares tendered and the price specified by the tendering
shareholders, the Company will determine the lowest price per share within the
range that will enable it to purchase up to approximately 472,000 shares of
common stock, or such lesser number of shares as are properly tendered and not
withdrawn. The Company will not purchase shares from a shareholder below a
price stipulated by that shareholder, and in some cases, may actually purchase
shares at prices above indications by shareholders under the terms of the
tender offer. The tender offer is not contingent upon any minimum number of
shares being tendered. The Company's directors and officers will not tender any
of their shares in the tender offer. The Company intends to repurchase shares
in the tender offer using cash on hand. If all 472,000 shares are purchased in
the tender at the maximum price of $5.30 per share, approximately $2,501,600 in
cash would be required.

Specific instructions and a complete explanation of the terms and conditions of
the tender offer will be contained in the Offer to Purchase and related
materials that will be mailed to shareholders of record. Shareholders will be
able to obtain copies of the Offer to Purchase, related materials filed by the
Company as part of the tender offer statement on Schedule TO and other
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission through the
Commission's internet address at www.sec.gov without charge when these
documents become available. Shareholders and investors may also obtain a copy
of these documents, as well as any other documents the Company has filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, without charge, from the Company.
Shareholders should read those materials carefully because they will contain
important information, including the various terms and conditions of the tender
offer.

"Our Board of Directors believes the modified 'Dutch Auction' tender offer
represents a mechanism to provide our shareholders with the opportunity to
tender all or a portion of their shares and thereby receive a return of some or
all of their investment if they so elect," said Ronald J. Norick, Chairman of
the Board of Directors. "The Board also believes the tender offer provides our
shareholders with an efficient way to sell their shares without incurring
broker's fees or commissions associated with open market sales. Also, we
believe that the Tender Offer is a beneficial use of our cash reserves for the
benefit of our shareholders."

The Company, its Board of Directors and executive officers are not making any
recommendation to shareholders as to whether to tender or refrain from
tendering their shares into the tender offer. Shareholders must decide how many
shares they will tender, if any, and the price within the specified range at
which they will offer shares for purchase by the Company.

SBS. Not so sure it's the biggest water company in the world. Maybe it depends
on what's meant by "big". On some measures SUEZ is the biggest. Hard for me to
focus on SBS book value because SBS always (i.e. in its relatively short public
history) seems to have sold below book value, and maybe that might not change
for a very long time.

Still, I believe you might be right about SBS's good future. I have a few
shares, and I'll bet alongside you and your partners. And I'll increase my bet
a little too. (Bought a little more SBS a few minutes ago)

Favorable article in today's Barron's on YRC Worldwide:

With stock at $39.64 they say:

"Back up the truck: The depressed shares could climb above 60. Cash flow is
rolling along, and earnings for '07 could come in well above the Street's
expectations."

About those pension liabilities previously mentioned here, they say:

"One frequently cited problem: underfunded pension liabilities. The company has
$2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in potential liability, related just to the
Teamsters' Central States Pension Fund, Bear Stearns points out.
(John)Neff, however, views these concerns as overblown. The pension
obligations, he argues, "are up in the air" and may ultimately be paid by the
Teamsters."

"Up in the air", "may", "ultimately" "could climb" --- those words don't sound
to me like much of a comforting reason to ignore those liabilities.
Anyway, I still hold shares, still also believe the stock is undervalued, and
am looking to add if the stock will drop a bit.

Deal With CBS May Prove Google's Move Into TV

radio and, possibly, local TV ad-sales divisions. Radio revenue is down 7%
through the first three quarters of 2006 and local TV is expected to face
difficult comparisons in 2007 as last year it got a boost from the 2006
elections. Contrary to many assumptions, the deal wouldn't be just for remnant
inventory, and would be instrumental in helping Google get its
audio-advertising business off the ground...."

SPOR:

I can't figure out what to make of the Dutch Tender offer in this situation; I
am equally as puzzled.

Hopefully, no one will tender. That could be an indication that holders view
the value of the company at substantially greater than what the company is
offering. You may recall that there were very few shares tendered in the case
of BAMM.

I am not sure that I have seen evidence of an impressive turn-around. Sales are
up but the company does not seem able to make any money on those new sales.
Would be intersted in hearing your views on the company's performance.

The company still loses money and Net Current Assets slipped $600,000 or so
last quarter. The comfort in owning this company is the margin of safety
provided by its liquid balance sheet. But that seems continually eroding away.

Daniel Zeff continues holding over 10% of the company and that is somewhat
reassuring, although I don't know anything about Zeff. He does seem to turn up
as an owner in several of the comanies that I own -- ELSE, JOB; but I really

Paul , congrats for running this board.
SBS is the 2nd biggest water co. , with U$3,4 bi (K) in the world , first is
Veolia with U$ 27 bi . Suez is yet bigger but is pure water utillities .

After trading for 15 years in Brazil , I can say I know a bit of that .It's a
small market about 150 stocks that is worth and perhaps 30 ADR's.

In the last 15 years PBR.A (PETR4) , RIO.P (VALE5) have rosen alot are the main
brazilian stocks it look likes everybody have them or talk about them.

In the last 20 years BBD (BBDC4)and ITU (ITAU4)2 biggest banks have rosen
perhaps 100 times !!!! in U$ . They have been always the winner always , even
beter than RIO and PBR ,
but now I don't know if they will still rise like rocket at a PE of 14/15 .

From 3 years till now there have been a lot of IPO's with almost good return ,
but I don't like IPO's in Brazil . I've seen a lot of bandits in this area.

The company I most like now in Brazil is USIMINAS (OTCBB: USNZY) few volume in
NY. USIM5.SA have a look in Yahoo it's one of the biggest flat steel co. with
growning earnings and PE = 5.3 !

But have just switched all USIM5 for SBS ( Sabesp) that think in the short term
will rise more sharply.

I have owned SPOR for many years and the only reason I have made any money from
it is by buying low and selling higher. Its amazing that I havent lost money
given the company has been bleeding red for so long. (The margin of safety
helped no doubt)

The previous chairman and his son who was CEO were incompetent at best and
possibly crooked. They got golden parachutes in excess of what was called for
in the proxy.

None of the board members seemed to have any real oversight for the years of
the Tomlinsons mismanagement/fraud or whatever you call it.

While I believe that SPOR has value in a buyout, I dont know how much value it
has in excess of its book value. (Approx $5.28)

The 3 most senior officers, each of which as been with the company for
years,directly own ZERO shares combined.

The board, directly owns just 5.44% combined. (excluding options)

Now, they have a bunch of options bringing that % up a good bit.

There has been ZERO open market buying for many,many years even when the stock
was as low as $2-3.

They had hired an investment banker to help them explore strategic alternatives
and after a year or so they disengaged them without taking any action. (PURW
did the same thing and was later bought out at a nice premium)

Then came the 25 cent dividend and now the dutch tender offer.

I have mixed feelings about going dark because its already illiquid and going
to the pinks would only make things worse.

But, the annual SOX & public company savings could be $200-300k per year which
is not chump change for a company with just 2.77 million shares out. (Less any
shares tendered)

There are 5 holders of 5% or more. One or more of them could have pressured for
this tender offer as a way for them to liquidate a portion of their holdings.

On the other hand, the tender offer announcement has likely brought new buyers
to the stock that are here for more than just the tender offer arb.

They could have already gone dark if they wanted. And, my reading of their TO
document suggests they may give us another "out" before going dark. (What do
you think ?)

"However, we do not intend to discontinue those reporting obligations or to
de-list our common stock from Nasdaq without providing all of our remaining
shareholders other than affiliates with a mechanism to sell or exchange their
shares in one or more going private transactions. As stated above, the Board of
Directors has not definitively determined to pursue a “going private”
transaction at any time in the future."

The reason I think they may have turned things around is I believe they have
had several quarters recently that showed improvements over the prior year. The
last quarter sales were up 17% over the prior year.

I think its possible that they are profitable THIS YEAR. A decent earnings year
with a positive outlook would make the valuation much higher than $5.

I have to think that one or more of the 5%+ holders will tender some shares.

But, new buyers could mean the shares wont trade below $4.50 anymore.

I really dont know.

I dont know what I plan on doing.

Frankly, I dont think I have enough information to come to a positive
conclusion as to the best thing to do.

Adding some S today on weakness. S has been producing crappy numbers ever since
they merged with Nextel. Hopwever Cingular has recovered after a similar
offense, why not Sprint? S trades at 5.7x EV/EBITDA (based on the reduced
estimates for 2007), so i do not need any growth to justify the current
valuation. FCF yield should be about 8% based on current shareprice of 17$.
Sprint has a nice network to build data and internet services on which should
support longer term growth at some point. Either the company will righten
itself or get taken out by private equity or a strategic buyer (Comcast is a
possibility IMO).

I'll hold my few shares of S, but I've taken a little T today.

I like WSJ's James Stewart's column yesterday, "An Inexpensive Way to Play News
of iPhone: Buy AT&T"

About Apple's iPhone announcement:

"Compared with Apple, the media paid relatively little attention to AT&T, whose
Cingular wireless network, now wholly owned by AT&T after its merger with
BellSouth and soon to be rebranded as AT&T Wireless, gained exclusive rights as
the iPhone network. Even after AT&T's strong showing last year, the stock
yields over 4% and trades at just over 13 times earnings."

My opinion is that T's "strong showing last year" is a negative for this year.
And "just over 13 times earnings" is not cheap, for such a company as T (imo).
So I am seeing the stock as expensive for a value play. Mitigated somewhat by
company's size and its dividend. For me, a speculation now (on Apple iPhone)as
much or more than value.

Aside: I still hold shares in VZ. Also CMCSA. I moved some funds from CMCSA to
VZ last year. That's apparently been a mistake. CMCSA has continued to move
higher, and VZ seems stalled.
My penchant for getting in and/or out slowly seems to have helped me here
somewhat, since I'm still riding CMCSA with my remaining shares.

From what I have observed here, your tenacity against odds of a commodity stock
price swings is an admirable trait representing the true long term theme of
value investing. Personally my ability and patience to hold thru these wild
gyrations of a very volatile group has been severely tested at times, resulting
in a failure to hang in. One thing I do know is that FCX has an awful lot of
hard assets and they continually find more. I find the traders, the hedgies,
and others in control of the stock price often with more money than brains
difficult if not impossible to fight. FCX is a very rich company, much more
rich than many people realize. But they, like others in business for the long
term care much more about the long term development of China than a 20 point
swing in the stock. Maybe I'll rejoin you sometime, but being underwater at
this point doesn't enhance my conviction on commodities at the moment,
including oil and gas.

The reaction in SCHW to what I consider a decent report is astonishing. I
realize they have some debt as well as assets, but 24 billion in cash and
equivalents along with over $19 per share in cash - one would think there would
be a floor somewhere below not far away. FBR says downgrade? From this angle,
they are getting about another $3 billion in cash when the US Trust deal is
completed, and to think they won't know what to do with this cash, seems a
little bit much, even for FBR.

stock price and book value don't correlate directly, as SCHW has more than
twice as many shares out as ETFC...you could compare stock price and
price/book, but that isn't really that important as compared to price/earnings
and PEG

ET is trading at a multiple of 14.4 times 2007 earnings, while earnings are
estimated to grow 17.7%, for a PEG in the current year of 0.81

SCHW is trading at a multiple of 21.2 times 2007 earnings, with earnings
estimated to grow 16.2%, for a PEG in the current year of 1.31

using the longer term estimates, ET has a PEG ratio of 0.99, while SCHW has a
PEG of 1.38

ET had a big run from mid 2005 to about may of 2006, and has been consolidating
that gain since, but pull up a longer term chart and it's pretty apparent that
ET has outperformed SCHW

IMHO that will continue to be the case going forward

I'd say something might have got lost in the wording/interpretation of the
posts.

I don't believe that SCHW or other asset managers can be evaluated by book
value. However, if the question was more 'are there offsets to cash', then book
value is a good number to look at. That's what I looked at anyway in Yahoo.
Yahoo shows cash/sh. about $19 with not much "total debt". But book value is
only $3/sh. That seems screwy to me. Bv can't be so low if cash/sh. is so high
with not much debt. (???) So I figure right away there has to be offsets to
that $19 cash/sh which causes that low book value. Offsets that Yahoo doesn't
show. Maybe something like lots of that cash held for customers (as an asset)
with an offsetting current liability (that cash to be claimed by customers).
But something.

I value asset managers by AUM, 'assets under management'. Going back several
years, with the data I've found, asset managers were being bought out at
1.5%-2% aum. So that's where I've tried to be a buyer (under 1.5% aum). Last
year I had several discussion on the Crossy thread with him and others.
Apparently I'm totally wrong in my number. Buyouts and/or analyst valuations
are at a much higher figure these days, with some rapidly growing asset
managers being considered 'undervalued' at 10% of aum. I don't like that high
number; it scares me. When one does look at history through, some of these
companies always seem to do well -- better stock performance over decades than
Buffett's Berkshire. And so recently, wrong though I have been in my opinion of
value, I have gone on and bought a few of companies with 'high' (imo) aum.

I don't understand SCHW to value it. It consists of several businesses, and
they're in the process of divesting themselves of a signifcant aum part
(U.S.Trust Corp). (Aside: it looks like U.S Trust has "over $100B in aum" and
is being sold for $3.3B). From their latest p.r. I see "The firm's (i.e SCHW's)
assets under management from clients of independent advisers at the end of the
year rose 23% from 2005 to slightly more than $500 billion." If I value this at
3% ($15B) but the whole firm at my preferred (but maybe wrong 2%), that's 2% of
$1.2Trillion (from SCHW website), that's maybe $24B. About the current market
cap. So I'll call SCHW fairly valued now and pass for a buy. (I'm in the sector
elsewhere.) OTOH, that growth was 23%, there is a number of reasons to believe
it could continue, and for ltb&h people, for asset manager stocks it's been a
question of just being in and staying in, not worrying about fair
value/undervalue/over value. Back on the the other hand though, SCHW is in the
brokerage business importantly too (not just an aum company), and SCHW has had
significant misteps before (which cratered the stock price).

All jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times. Especially in my comments about
this sector.

All good points made. The businesses are somewhat dissimilar, thus comparisons
with EFTC and AMTD for part of the business and comparisons with perhaps other
asset managers and retirement advisory planning firms for part of SCHW's
business are tuff to break out and analyze. Even then if done, no guarantee as
to future performance. As far as the past mishaps, I did read somewhere that
since the founder came back to assume the top slot, a clearer more focused
strategy going forward is not likely to include mistakes of the past. Who
knows? If the focus is now retirement planning and advisory services dedicated
to private clients with over a million invested, perhaps the baby boom
generation is a longer term positive and the strategic planning at the firm
well directed. Time always tells. Regards

Re CWTR, things could get even uglier, it's a bad miss:

http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/01-18-20
7/0004508807&EDATE=

Coldwater Creek (Nasdaq: CWTR) today announced that earnings per share for its
fiscal 2006 fourth quarter, ending Feb. 3, 2007, are expected to be in the
range of $0.16 to $0.17. The company's previous guidance, provided on Nov. 21,
2006, had been for earnings per share in the range of $0.26 to $0.27.
"Although the strength of our first three quarters is still expected to deliver
record performance in terms of full-year 2006 net sales and earnings, customer
traffic was slower-than-expected across the country throughout the holiday
season, which had a substantial negative impact on our fourth-quarter results,"
said Dennis Pence, chairman and chief executive officer for Coldwater Creek.
"We began our learance sale as-planned on Dec. 24, and since that time have
successfully been clearing merchandise to ensure that we end the quarter with
clean and current inventory levels, while maintaining our historically strong
balance sheet and cash position. Due to this increased level of clearance
activity, our gross margin rate will be under plan for the quarter, which will
negatively affect earnings and operating margin."
"While overall business was less-than-expected due to decreased customer
traffic, the categories of fashion-knit tops, moleskin pants, jewelry and
accessories were especially hard-hit," said Georgia Shonk-Simmons, president &
chief merchandising officer. "At the same time, our core items in jackets,
sweaters, skirts and denim continued to show relative strength for the period."

CHS is also down in AH. I don't see any news for them, so I assume it's in
sympathy - that may or may not turn out to be the right reaction, but you do
have to wonder if some of that missing traffic found it's way to CHS.

I also wish for a dividend boost but their FFO doesnt really cover their entire
dividend as it is. It seems they rely on property sales too.

Was hoping that broker that put a $24 target on it would cause more buying.
Maybe they will come out with another buy.

Another REIT that I own, FUR, has also been down lately. Its a more speculative
play with a lower dividend.

Finally, a longtime holding that went dark on me, HGPI.PK has is UP as they
sold most of their properties a few months back and booked a nice gain.

I compute a $9.21 book value with the recent gains but its likely they have
more undervalued stuff on the books.

Stocks $6.50-7.00 and trades by appointment only.

Also have a position in WMSI because they own real estate thats appreciated

FSP - FFO doesn't really cover their entire dividend as it is. It seems they

I looked at it and agree with the above. I'm not buying this one, there are
better options.

For the last 4 years REITs were up.
2003 29.2%
2004 23.5%
2005 2.2%
2006 28.2%

In past years when analysts and writers have pooh-poohed REITS and forecasted a
poor outlook, I did not feel that way. But now, based on their higher than
usual payout ratios to yield I finally think that this year could be year of
zero price appreciation, or worse. Yet the experts cite great office occupancy
rates and other indicators, and maybe they are finally right this time.

But I see many fewer good REIT deals than in the past. I can only mention a few
worth looking at. FR HRP HPT and maybe SUI. (I still own these and a few
others. I still have MPW, for example, buy would not be a big buyer at these
prices.)

I moved a bit of my REIT investments over to the high yielding canadian trusts,
and my REIT / trust mix is around 50-50 right now. But as soon as the trusts
pick up, I plan on lower my high exposure there. (3 months ago my mix was 3:1

Well, I havent invested in REITS or for yield historically.

The reason I bought FSP was the repeat insider buying.

That suggests they know more about the future outlook than I do.

For the most part, Im not finding much stuff that yields 6+% that also has had
nice clusters of insider buying.

Many of the REITS have had insider selling.

Also remember that FSP owns their properties outright with no permanent
mortgage debt. That should make it somewhat less volatile than the typical more
leveraged REIT.

I do believe their dividend payout is solid and not in danger of being lowered.

The canadian trusts are above my level of competence, the taxing issues are

I'm no expert on OPMR so really haven't looked at the numbers lately. I've
shorted this stock in the past, sometimes OK, and sometimes getting whipsawed
and cutting out. But I do remember the reasons I shorted it in the past.

1. I didn't care for the management at all. At that time they were awarding
themselves inordinate options and paying themselves inordinate salaries. The
sum total of both was more than the entire net income of the corporation or
close.

2. This tricky dicky management has had alot of deals going on in the past
between themselves and affiliated entities and shady individuals. They have had
several businesses and corporations that were totally transformed, jumping from
one line of business to another over the years, mostly unrelated businesses.

In sum, its tuff to trust them and believe they act in the best interest of the
shareholders.

The company primarily manages and owns suburban office buildings. By
syndicating some investments, the REIT also works as an investment bank.

REIT Stands Out From Crowd

By Jonathan Moreland
RealMoney.com Contributor
1/23/2007 7:37 AM EST

This column was originally published on RealMoney on Jan. 22 at 1:59 p.m. EST.
It's being republished as a bonus for TheStreet.com readers.

It takes all kinds of positions to make a well-balanced portfolio, and although
it's much more exciting to present high-risk/high-reward ideas in my columns,
insiders are good at bringing me investment ideas across the spectrum of risk.
On the lower end of that scale is Franklin Street Properties (FSP). Franklin is
not your run-of-the-mill real estate investment trust. I like how it stands out
from the crowd, and the prospects for this security's total return over the
coming year.

Franklin manages a portfolio of primarily suburban office buildings. But it
also acts as an investment banker by syndicating new properties to accredited
investors. This REIT therefore generates banking fees, along with rental income
and gains from property sales.

If Franklin's management feels particularly bullish on a piece of syndicated
property, it offers to roll the preferred shares of that syndicate into the
portfolio of the publicly traded REIT. Given that Franklin has been banker,
buyer and seller by the time management decides to merge with a syndicate,
decisions to merge can be seen as Franklin "cherry-picking" the best of its own
syndication deals for the benefit of the public REIT.

Merging a group of its syndicates together is actually how FSP first started
trading on the stock exchange in the summer of 2005. There was no IPO and no
raising of money. Franklin merely registered the preferred shareholders of
numerous syndicates, and FSP was born.

What Franklin saved in IPO costs, however, it lost in the way of potential
analyst coverage. Coming to market so oddly, and not needing money, FSP remains
woefully underfollowed on Wall Street, despite its $1.4 billion market cap.

This REIT's oddities, and the lack of coverage, is likely why FSP has a
relatively low valuation relative to its peers. The security's
trailing-price/funds-from-operations (FFO) per share of less than 13 is a good
15% below its industry's average. At the same time, FSP's indicated yield of
6.3% is double that of most its peers. Meanwhile, Franklin's return on equity
of 10% is at the high end for its group -- despite the fact that the REIT has
no debt.

That's right, absolutely no leverage. This is arguably the major difference
between FSP and its peers. Most REITs are leveraged by between 100% and 300% of
their equity as a matter of course to help boost returns. But Franklin eschews
leverage as a matter of philosophy.
"There is some degree of risk in putting debt on a property," points out
Franklin's CFO, John Demeritt. "You have to manage interest rate risk, and
there is dividend risk if rates make interest payments climb." Without either
interest rate or dividend risks, FSP's returns come with a lower degree of risk
than most of its peers'.

The lack of leverage during the recent good times for real estate, however, has
been most obvious for making Franklin's funds-from-operations growth less than
its peers'. So even though the income portion of FSP is safer, the penalty for
lower growth has recently made FSP a laggard in its group on a total-return
basis. But FSP's safe indicated yield should provide decent downside support
going forward, and anyone worried about a slowdown in the economy should
appreciate Franklin's clean balance sheet for the safety net it provides the
yield if weakness rears its head.

And what if a real estate crash causes fire sales in the suburban office
environment Franklin considers its core competency? Would Franklin consider
finally leveraging itself to make the most of the opportunity? "We would have
to consider it," admits Demeritt. "It would challenge the [no-debt]
philosophy."

A large challenge for Franklin right now, however, is just getting noticed.
With no obvious banking business to try for, only Oppenheimer's Marvin Loh has
found FSP worth getting to know. He rates the stock a buy with a $24 price
target. If reached, that would yield a 28% total return over the coming year.

With the interest of private-equity funds in REITs these days -- most notably
for Equity Office Properties -- I wondered whether FSP could reasonably expect
some pin action. After all, the private-equity guys love to use leverage to
make their deals pay off, and FSP has the most room to add leverage in the REIT
industry, as far as I can tell.
But a couple of factors would likely get in the way of that happening. Size,
for one. Franklin is less than a tenth the size of EOP, so only a small
private-equity firm would likely find it substantial enough to pursue. Even
then, it's unlikely any private-equity firm would appreciate the syndication
and banking fee part of Franklin.

For their part, insiders certainly think the shares are worth investing in at
these levels. Last year, eight executives and directors invested nearly
$950,000 in FSP at an average price of $20.03. The prior year, five insiders
put over $1 million into the stock at an average of $18.58.

So FSP isn't a raving buy for growth investors or those looking for a
private-equity play, but company insiders obviously see something they like.
Despite the fact that the investment banking aspect of revenues can make for
lumpy earnings, and little FFO growth is forecast in 2007 by the analyst Loh, I
think this REIT is a solid addition to any portfolio looking for a
low-risk/moderate-return position.

MWA - agreed. I bought some MWA.b today. I am not sure about the private market
valuations sloshing around since almost everything should be worth 20-30% more
using private market valuations. But I like MWA's strong position as a supplier
for the water utilities and I think that management can wring out efficiencies.

The MWA.b shares are the better deal right now - they trade at a discount to
MWA but have 8 voting rights each (compared to 1 for MWA).

RE-CNI-Don't own it and never owned it, but I like it for a diversified
portfolio. I think your only going to achieve moderate gains, but you also have
a dividend for a total return. Looks solid to me. I've own CP in the past.

I think the worry is about transporting less lumber for the housing industry
via the Illinois Central. You have an event coming up, earnings to after the
close. Maybe a niche transporting more corn for the ethanol industry. Tracks
serve the ethanol belt. Corn prices are up and Canada grows plenty. The
Canadian dollar has been strong however.

Monogen has more than doubled since I posted a little over a month ago. Up 13%
today. IMHO we have not even begun inning one.

If you do not own wait for a pullback. Do your due diligence. We are due for
one as it has been straight up.

A lot of great posts here recently:

Here is one of the major shareholders who has over 15 million shares or about
$20.9 million.

The Importance of Owning Early-Stage Growth Stocks
The year was 1915. My father, who is still doing fine at 91, was born on June
10th. In mid-August his father was injured in an unusual way after accepting a
bet at their summer cottage at Rose Cliff, So. Weymouth, Massachusetts. Playing
cards one evening with friends, he was challenged to see who would be the first
to enter the ocean in front of the cottage. Knowing that using the stairs to
descend the steep cliff would not win, he plunged off the cliff but upon entry
was impaled in his stomach by some driftwood. Today I'm sure he would have
lived, but in that era there were no antibiotics to combat the infection that
resulted. He lingered in bed for 6 months, dying in January, 1916 at age 33.

He was a very successful entrepreneur, having started a wholesale egg and
cheese business in Boston. During that 6 months of life after the injury he
successfully sold his business and with the proceeds told his young wife that
he had bought two stocks with the proceeds--- Eastman Kodak, his technology
stock, and Beatrice Foods, the company he knew well from the food business. His
instruction, which she repeated often during her 85 year life in which she
never married again, was to NEVER SELL these stocks unless she needed money to
live on, and then only to sell enough stock to provide 6 months living expenses
for her and her three children at any one time.

Countless times she was told by bankers and brokers alike that because she
never worked and needed income, to sell and invest in bonds or put the money in
their bank. She was taking "too great a risk" was the constant refrain. She
would smile and tell them NO, remembering her dying husband's admonition.

She put all three kids thru college,(one became a doctor), and she lived in
style thru her long life. When she died in 1970, the EK and Beatrice were still
held and were valued at over $US1 million in her estate.

What can we all learn from this TRUE story. Identify greatness early, as in the
case of MonoGen, and hold for the LONG term. I doubt very much whether I will
own another stock unless we get bought out prematurely. Luckily, there are four
of us that collectively own over 50% of the company so that event will not
happen unless it is an offer we can't refuse.

The Second Ace

I was watching Texas-Hold-Em last night and it was mentioned that the odds of
being dealt a pair of aces down was 212:1, meaning you should bet them
strongly. We shareholders have been dealt a second ace among the Monogen
team---- Siegfried Weiler. He is the President and owner of Diamond Machine
Werks, the company in Chicago that manufactures the Processor. Note the
spelling of "Werks". German! Seigfried is a second-generation German, I'm told,
and obviously proud of it. What do you think of when you characterize a
German---- a perfectionist. That gut feeling, coupled with the knowledge that
he and his wife have invested over $US27 million in Monogen and have been
stalwarts through thick and thin, is your second indication that someone you
can rely upon has done your DD for you. Siegfried is your second ace!

Rocket

The first ace is Ted Geiselman, the Executive VP and COO. (See message 23).

First-Rate People

A broker friend from New York had a conversation with Evan Jones, the past
Chairman of Digene, in early December. When asked about MonoGen, Evan's first
words were "first-rate people". That's what it's all about! Contrary to what
many of you think, I really don't have a clue how the MonoPrep Processor does
what it does. But having met personally all the top management I second the
assessment of Mr. Jones, and that's all there is to it. I invest on an
instinctive ability to recognize greatness before it becomes obvious to other
investors. I also have the guts to act decisively on that feeling.

Re: Looking down the road...

I just can't help commenting on the idea that earnings are important as an
entry point. If you wait until a company has earnings much of the appreciation
has already taken place. For example, in 2000 when I bought a size position in
ID Biomedical the value of the company as a whole was about $US100 million.
There were about 30 employees and they had patents on a StrepA vaccine and
little more. In September, 2005 Glaxo paid $US1.4 BILLION for the company after
IDB had consummated 2 acquisitions, one a nasal flu technology and the other a
intramuscular flu vaccine. At no time during that 5 years did IDB ever come
close to "earnings", and yet I made 10 TIMES my money! Think about it.

Rocket

One other thing, the IP (intellectual property) of MonoGen is so formidable
that the company could be acquired at any time for that property alone. I am
aware of 2 such attempts by legitimate companies since Monogen obtained its FDA
approval in March 2006.

Re: The Make-Up of the Owners .......

I'm being bad for posting. Must kool it for awhile!

I do own 15 million; 9,931,000 in the private placement, the remainder in open
market purchases.

Must Crawl Back In My Hole

Betty is not happy with me for the intensity that I have exhibited toward
MonoGen and interesting others in the company. I must desist and become a
lurker myself on this board. It is a wonderful long-term investment and I've
done everything I can to make it successful from my standpoint. Now I must
devote more time to my wife!

My apologies to any of you that might want to call. Please don't. See you at

http://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=6898&mn=52&pt=msg&mid=1237475

The Make-Up of the Owners .......

of this company, as best I know it.

I'm going to divide the shareholders into 3 components and discuss the
restrictions placed on each group.

1) The Private Placement33.5 million shares)
This was closed on November 14, 2006 and raised CDN$18.5 million at $CDN.55
(US$.49). (I participated in this placement). The shares are restricted for 4
months, and then could be sold only in Canada under a 904 registration. Andre
told me that my restrictions printed on the certificate will be removed by the
company without having to sell after 2 years. Piece of cake!

2) The Monogen Shareholders: (57 million shares +/- )
These shares were the original Monogen shareholders other than those owned by
Oxbow Equities, which were not counted for purposes of the conversion. Of the
57 million NEW shares issued, 47.5 million are owned by the Weiler Trusts, and
I approximate 7 million are owned by Hoffer Plastics. That leaves only 2.5
million owned by others. All these shares are locked up for 9 months from the
closing date of the merger, which was October 31st, 2006. See pg. 84.

3)The Oxbow Equities Shareholders: (76 million shares +/-)
These shares are all free for trading and are the "float" from which we must
buy. Let me account for many of these shares which are held by solid, long-term
investors and therefore should not see the light of day for many years or until
the company is acquired.
a)A broker in Calgary has 10 million.
b)A lawyer and friends in Montana has 7-8 million
c)Andre owns over 11 million
d)A group in Washington state owns 1 million and counting
e)A broker in Montreal can account for 20-30 million
f)I own over 5 million and friends and family own millions more

That approximates about 65 million, which only leaves 10-12 million unaccounted
for. Intersting, isn't it. What's going to happen if small-cap specialists like
the Royce Funds start buying?

Rocket

PS Received a very friendly email from HI. The Information Circular I alluded
to last night has been taken.

Re: The Make-Up of the Owners .......

A postscript on the make-up of the private placement group. Most of these
shares were sold to Canadian institutions who are considered small-cap
specialists. Since they mark-to-the-market for reporting purposes, they have no
incentive to sell after the 4 month restriction. I would doubt if any of these
shares are sold this year.

Rocket

You Might Wonder Why......

I was able to ask for and receive permission to organize the investor meeting
that was held last Thursday in Chicago.What occurred was considered unheard of.
Let me share with you the reason it did occur.

Together with Betty, I own over 15,000,000 shares or about 9% of Monogen,
making me the 2nd largest shareholder behing the 47,500,000 shares owned by the
Weiler Trusts. Andre told me on Thursday that when the company files its
prospectus with the SEC prior to the proposed offering in the states I will
have to file a 13D as a 5% or more owner. Currently, because the Canadian
threshold is 10% I do not have to do so, owning under that amount.

I just wanted all of you to know that, but rest assured it means nothing will
change in our lives. No new homes, continuing to work as a woodsman when in
Maine, etc. It's just a means of keeping score, and showing naysayers that
rifle shooting (being in one stock) can be far more rewarding than shotgunning
(owning a mutual fund,etc). Get the drift?

A One-Trick Pony

For those of you who don't know me, I thought I'd post my original message that
I sent to friends and family on November 13, 2006. Incidently, I am a retired
stockbroker from Maine.

2006 has been a year of transition between my single-asset portfolio--ID
Biomedical-- and my new single asset-- MonoGen, Inc. As most of you know, I
held only IDB from 2000 to its acquisition by Glaxo in September of last year.
I then positioned and recommended a number of stocks [Medsurge (now CRH
Medical), Sigma Designs, Corriente Resources, Labopharm, Oxbow Equities (now
MonoGen), Tyhee Development, and Delta Petroleum]. All are great early-stage
companies that will be profitable investments, if held. However, I have an
obsessive personality which forces me to choose what I consider to be the
cheapest company relative to what I perceive to be its future growth. Sometimes
it entails sticking my neck into places that frighten others, as I'm sure most
of you will be if you study superficially my current pick.

MonoGen (MOGIF, currently US$.69), based in a suburb of Chicago, is a
"pure-play" debt-free invito-diagnostic medical device company that is
developing an integrated suite of fully automated modules called the Savant
Laboratory System for anatomic and molecular pathology laboratories. It
received FDA approval in March of this year for its flagship machine and has
just completed a private placement, raising CDN$18.5 million, in preparation
for the manufacturing ramp of its MonoPrep Processor that will perform
liquid-based PAP tests. (See the machine in action and study the backgrounds of
its management and board of directors at http://www.monogen.com .)

Since I am over 65 and intend to hold MonoGen for at least 5 years, I'm afraid
this will be my last hurrah in the high risk-high reward arena. Given my
myopia, I will be discontinuing email coverage of all the stocks other than
MonoGen that I have mentioned over the last year. If any of you do buy MonoGen
and would like periodic updates, email me your continuing interest. Otherwise,
I wish you all the best of luck with your investments.

Rocket

P.S. I want to reemphasize that all the other stocks that I have recommended
are fine companies and should afford anyone who owns them an above-average rate
of return over the next 5 years. However, in my opinion, MonoGen will perform
the best over that timeframe because after 9 years plus of incredible effort
with very little money the company is at the inflection point in its life
cycle. It is by far the best opportunity I have ever found selling under $100
million U.S. in market capitalization.

Chicago Meeting

http://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=6898&mn=22&pt=msg&mid=1203854

Back Up The Truck

The meeting I attended at the MonoGen headquarters in Chicago was electrifying!
The MonoGen Processor works flawlessly and will become the defacto standard for
automating the anatomic and molecular pathology laboratories of the future.

I have decided to say little else at this time and let the market price of the
stock speak for me. I could wow you with superlatives but will not. This is the
best technology I have ever found, in a company that is virtually unknown and,
therefore, inefficiently priced. With the commercialization ramp building all
year, it will be an interesting stock to watch, to say the least.

Look for a 1:10 reverse split sometime late in the second quarter, followed by
a secondary offering in the U.S. and a NASDAQ listing. Do not attempt to trade
this stock; just buy it and sit back and watch. You will be handsomely
rewarded.
