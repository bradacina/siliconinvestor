I share your concerns about nly. I remember listening to some really old
professional investor on tv explaining why countrywide was such a great bargain
it was selling in the high 30s at the time. I took a long look at the company
and all i could see was huge leverage so I passed. if someone could assure me
that they were protected in in increasing yield environment I could easily be
convinced on NLY.

I checked my records and I have only owned ibm since sept. 2010 and goog since
august 2010, though it seems a lot longer since together they are over 10% of
my portfolio. they have both done well for me- well exceeding 16% on an annual
basis, and i purchased both in the taxable account with the idea of holding
rather than trading. mpw is also in that category, though its long term by now,
and i need some yield in the portfolio.

Seems like i have done much better with these small E&Ps taking other peoples
advice on these threads rather that trying to ferret anything out on my own. I
put a small amount into ren.ws
an ed a. recommendation and that is a double for me now. he also suggested vnr
which turned out really well, so I will check out your suggestions for sure.

My stake in ttt is large, but i am reluctant to sell as i am sure there wll be
a spinoff of the chinese assets down the road and perhaps the trading operation
too, if they are intent on making this into a royalty company. I will
definitely be holding on to the rest of the khd shares.

Hi Paul

What's you long term exit strategy for the oil stocks you have been
accumulating? Specifically those that are of the small cap variety, do not pay
any type of dividend and/or are hard to determine their fair value.

One of the determinants to calculate fair value is the price of oil and NG.
With oil approaching $100/barrel I see limited up side to the commodity w/o
affecting overall world demand. NG is another case as IMO it is a reversion to
the mean play and could rise another 50% just to get to it's long term
historical avg price.

Valuation for many of these small cap E&P companies is difficult and can be
influenced by company specific events. Several of the big winners are the
result of profitable lease holds located in rich oil/NG areas, getting large JV
partners to help finance & develop wells, building up proven reserves and/or
gathering operations so sustainable income streams can be produced, low
historical interest rates needed to finance E&P operations and generally high
Oil & NG prices.

Even with the best due diligence there are still valuation surprises. For
example Samson Oil & Gas Limited (SSN) retained a 3.8% overriding royalty
interest for the Niobrara acreage they sold to Chesapeake. So not only did this
sale provide immediate liquidity to develop the oily section of their Niobrara
holdings, but it also provides cash flow from operations as Chesapeake pays a
royalty to Samson.

Therefore, I guess my exit strategy on these will be based on (1) holding
period one to three years, (2) price of Oil & NG compared to avg historical
prices (peel off shares when prices are high), (3) the successful development
of proven reserves and (4) minimal debt leverage when compared to net income
and free flow cash.

FWIW, many of the new lease holds terms now contain a royalty over ride for the
term of the lease. Many of these specific terms are not disclosed in the SEC
filings. You have to ask the companies if they have any (on their large sales
and/or purchases). It's a nice surprise when you find out that they retained
these interests. It makes it easier to hold these companies that have these
hidden assets vs the others that continue to spend money and accumulate debt
drilling dry holes.

Small e&p's: I have them mostly in taxable accounts, and I'm planning to hold
each purchase for at least a year. It may take a couple of years to see which
of the small companies can grow and which will fall aside.

While gas prices are low now and this commodity has seen many boom/bust cycles,
it does seem to me that with the newer drilling technologies we may see supply
and possibility of increasing supplies to such an extent that gas prices will
remain very low for all producers in almost all areas (most USA shales) for a
very long time. In other words, I'm not so sure about a reversion-to-mean this
time.

If oil prices fluctuate between $80-110/barrel, my portfolios are really going
to be volatile, given the weighting I have in oil. Mentally I accept that;
emotionally I'm not so sure.

Hi Grantcw -

Re: SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU) - The hidden value that the investment community is
missing . . .

You have it partially correct that SVU's value is in it's real estate. This was
true right after the Albertson's merger but a lot of the owned real estate
(many of the Osco Drug stores) was sold to a private equity firm that assumed
some of the debt for the real estate. SVU was left with some of the best store
locations acquired at a discounted price but as a result had to book a huge
"goodwill" expense that reflected their net acquisition costs above the
tangible value of the acquired assets . Over the last several quarters, SVU has
been writing off these goodwill charges which reflected in losses reported by
the company.

As you detailed in your post, they own approx 38% of their store locations, all
accounted for at the acquisition price at the time of the Albertson's
acquisition. Since then the real estate values on these parcels have not gone
up in value but do remain quite a valuable assets. However, they now carry a
huge debt load which they must pay down.

The Crown Jewel for Super Value - Their Supply Chain Services
==============================================================

Supervalue's crown Jewel is their logistics and distribution network. The real
estate is all company owned (many locations have been owned by the company for
decades). Cost is carried on the books but the actual market value is much
higher. The value kicker is that the ongoing operation is a big money maker.
Their distribution centers rival Walmart's operations and some industry experts
says it is more efficient.

They have Warehouse Facilities located in 28 States
http://www.supervalu.com/sv-webapp/contact/directory.jsp

Above is a list of their warehouse distribution centers. The company has been
consolidating facilities to better serve both their company owned stores and
those where they have contracted distribution agreements.

Supervalue's Supply Chain Services contributed 22.2% of their fiscal 2009
sales. (
http://www.forbes.com/2009/05/18/supervalu-kroger-safeway-personal-finance-inve
ting-ideas-wal-mart.html ) This segment provides food distribution and
logistics services to the company's retail food stores as well as to
approximately 2,200 national, regional and independent grocery stores, mass
merchants and the military. The segment is also a secondary supplier to another
500 retailers. It also offers third-party logistics services support for
warehouse management, transportation and procurement.

Many analysts do not associate any value to SVU's Supply Chain Services and
industry expertise. My opinion is that if this division is spun off it is worth
at least $5.50/share. Currently it has more value when it services their
company owned stores but could be set up as a stand alone company that supplies
one or more of the big three super markets and/or Target/Costco super centers.

The new CEO that SVU brought it early last year is from Wal-Mart and has
extensive marketing experience. I suspect the SVU board will give the new CEO
24 months to get his new marketing and promotional programs working. There will
probably be more sales of company owned stores too.

A final remaking of the company may be the spin off of their logistics Supply
Chain business and/or buying and integrating a private label brand into their
supply chain offering. The key is for the company to work off their debt from
their generated cash flows. They are paying this down at the rate of almost
$1.00/share per year. They have about $7.00/share in debt. I will be adding
more shares next month as soon as my 31 day wash period has expired.

Hi Madharry

Re: Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR)

Added a few ULTR shares below $6.00/share. The company had a conference call
today where they discussed their capital expansion plans. With their new
convertible notes (total of $70 million), their interest expense is quite large
but this is off set by their depreciation so their net cash flow still remains
positive. More revenue comes in when their new PSV fleet starts operating and
they begin to take advantage of the efficiencies in the River Business from
their previous capital investments.

Zachs raised their price target to $10.00/share.

I have a few higher priced shares left in my basket that I plan to sell in 31
days (or longer) so this buy for me allows me to replenish my inventory and/or
sell & book my loss.

Longer term, I would like to see ULTR buy some Port facility warehouse space

Madharry, regarding these e&p's, I haven't kept records of land prices paid vs
current market values.

Lots of variables affecting land prices that I can't quantify -- availability
of required resources such as water, roads, pipelines; winter harshness
considerations; business model -- ratio of gas:oil; heavy vs. light/medium
oils; multiple shale locations. Comparing what adjacent companies paid for
their drilling rights -- even if they bought at the same time -- that is maybe
only indicative.

Looking at market value of acreage owned, I only have info for the Alberta
Cardium. Here are some results I've calculated:

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27101331&srchtxt=tol

I've mentioned TriOil Resources (TOL.v/TRIAF) now. It has your "low market
price to acreage owned" -- as measured by enterprise value to net-sections
controlled. Company agrees: this can be seen in a comparables chart in their
latest corporate presentation. As I say, I'm betting on development success of
the Alberta Cardium and buying TOL.v as one stock that gets a stock buyer land
relatively cheaply compared to other companies' land there. The Alberta
Cardium's pretty broad -- maybe TriOil's in an area that won't be commercially
productive. OTOH, TRO has enough drilling prospects that maybe a couple could
hit to make up for the dry holes.

Hello DebtFree,

Well, as of yet, nothing. But, if I add new shares, I will probably write calls
against them. For example, if we dip under 7, I will most likely buy more
shares and write $7 calls in April or July as they look to have good premiums
(0.80 and 1.10 on the bid respectively vs. current 7.30 SVU price).

I do think this company is more risky than my other positions, but my other
positions are TOT, E, DKA, CSCO, and NE, so I overall feel like my other
positions are in conservative companies without a debt workdown issue like SVU.
But I do feel like SVU is a value play and I'm comfortable with it in general.

Re: SVU - One way to value their Supply Chain Business

According to the Forbes article I posted, SVU derived 22.2% of their fiscal
2009 sales from their supply chain service business. If you look at their
annual report for 2010 their supply chain sales were also running about 22% of
their sales. In 2010, their supply chain services earned $299 million or about
$1.41/share.

My back of the envelope valuation calculation is based on analysts next years
earnings estimates of $1.20/share. 22% of this number s/b attributable to their
Supply Chain Business or $0.27/share. At a 20 PE (industry is 23X look at FDX &
UPS) you get $5.40/share. This division s/b a higher margin business than the
general grocery category and should demand a higher PE..

Realistically, you can not separate the Supply Chain segment from the Grocery
segment w/o allocating a large portion of the company's debt back to this
division. To run as separate companies, the grocery division should have little
or no long term debt.

What about spinning off their Supply Chain Business and use the proceeds to pay
off their long term debt. Shareholders receive shares of the new SVU (w/o
debit) and the new Supply Chain Business (post payment of $4 Billion LT debt).

If you value their Supply Chain Business at 18x earnings at $1.41 (2010 Supply
Chain earnings per share) that equals $25.38/share (Market Valuation of $5.5
Billion). Now subtract out the company LT debt of $20.00/share ($4.0 Billion),
you come up with a net value of $5.38/share ($1.5 Billion). With no debt, the
grocery business could earn $0.75/share - $1.00/share and could be valued at
10x earnings or $7.50/share - $10.00/share (Market Cap $1.6B-$2.21).

New Supply Chain Business - Market Cap $ 1.5B
New SVU (w/o debt) - Market Cap $2.0B

The combined parts would be worth $12.88/share-$15.38/share.

The key point from this review is that their Supply Chain Business is their
crown jewel and the main revenue generator for the company. By spinning off the
division, you could generate enough money to pay off all their debt and be left
with two very profitable operating companies with a valuation of the combined
parts 100% higher than the current market price.

In summary SVU should probably continue to operate all their stores (making
periodic sales/closures based on store profitability), pay down debt and build
their Supply Chain Business services. They could however, spin off their Supply
Chain Division, pay off all company debt and end up with two profitable
operating companies.

I would like them to integrate one or more private label brands into their
supply chain offerings. This could provide a good growth kicker to this
profitable division.

re SVU, a 20X earnings multiple is too high for a supply chain Business. SVU
supply chain business is not like FDX or UPS (both have a substantial moat with
worldwide operations and high market share. SVU business is more like SYY, a
food distribution business with a national footprint only, which trades at 8x
EBITDA or a 14X PE after taxes. SVU food distribution business is much smaller
and should probably carry a lower multiple, especially since it's tied together
with SVU supermarket operations (which would be free to pursue other vendors in
case of a spinoff). I don't think you will see a good multiple for that kind of

Hi JackStraw -

I did not realize that SVU's Supply Chain Business actually grew last year as
the retail sales continued to fall.

From the Zach's report:"...Net sales at Supply Chain Services (24.2% of the
total sales in the quarter) increased 0.2% to $2,100 million in the quarter
compared with $2,096 million in the prior-year quarter...."

Note: 52 Weeks Ended February 27, 2010, Supply Chain Revenues $8,960 million
and Operating earnings $299 million (from 2010 annual report).

Noted potential risks from the analyst -

From the report"...food distribution business sales to dip by 3.5%, portraying
the impact of Target Corp.'s (TGT - Analyst Report) plan to allocate some of
the volume for selfdistribution and Ukrop's exit from its customer list...".

I didn't realize that Target was already a customer of their Supply Chain
Services. It's possible for SVU's Supply Chain division to expand their
services to this account (and others) through superior information technology
implementation. What about new POS wireless tracking inventory systems,
delivery truck GPS tracking systems, intelligent Bar code warehouse inventory
management systems etc. New technology innovation(s) are easy to install and
upgrade.

Also, Target recently announced that they plan to open up new stores in Canada
and entered into several new store lease contracts.

Target Sets Canada for First Expansion Outside U.S. (Update4)
http://noir.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a3AKlIa01pj0

to expand outside the U.S. for the first time in its history.

The leasehold interests apply to as many as 220 sites now run by Zellers Inc.,
a unit of Canadian department-store chain Hudson’s Bay Co., Minneapolis-based
Target said today in a statement. Target plans to open 100 to 150 sites in
Canada in 2013 and 2014. ..."

This is a big opportunity for SVU's Supply Chain Business to expand into Canada
and become international. They already have the warehouse facilities and
distribution trucks just across the border.

The analysts still do not assign a higher PE to the sales derived from this
business segment. Even at a 10 PE this division contributed $1.42/share
earnings for 2010 ($299 million/212 million shares)! That translates to a share
price of $14.20/share (less debt).

This will be my last post on goog: saw some estimates most peg the 2011
earnings at $34-35 and most have price targets of $750,
that seems a bit strange to me as I would think 20 times earnings plus cash
would be $780-$800 perhaps they are leaving room to raise estimates as the
quarterly figures come in. I dont understand the weakness in the price at all,
unless its related to fears of the management change. The way I look at it is-
you have a couple of geniuses who are operators of and major shareholders in
one of the most successful world wide companies to date. These guys built up
and and developed an amazing compan over the past decade. Schmidt who is on his
way out the door was no great star before he got to google. My guess the
success of the company is due mostly to the other two guys and the existing
staff. IMHO as this is the way value investors make their money by taking of
opportunities like this one.

Going back to our coal company analysis, I picked up a small position in PUDA
today as one of my covered call plays. I had sold about 1/3 of my position in
CNX and wanted to stay in coal on some level long-term. So, I picked up PUDA in
my covered call portfolio and sold an August '11 $15 call for 1.44.

I think this is a good value risk/reward play. But, we'll see...

Hi Grantcw -

Re:Puda Coal Inc. (PUDA)

This looks like a very profitable company if one is interested in a pure
metallurgical coking coal play. Forward PE according to Yahoo is 6 and they
earn enough net income to pay off their LT debt in just under two years
(Buffets likes 4 years or less).

No dividend so a covered call (ie Buy/write) strategy makes a lot of sense. The
$1.44/contract is a huge premium for the Aug'11 $15.00 calls. Black Scholes
says at a price of $12.37/share, the August'11 $15.00 calls should sell for
$1.50/contract.

That's an annualized return just on the call premium of 20%. If the stocks gets
called in August add another 22%. I also like that the stock is selling below
my 120 day MA daily chart.

I have added this to my watch list and like the returns BUT I am always
skeptical of Chinese companies. The market cap is $257 million and it has
traded on the AMEX since Nov 2005 so it should be a legitimate company.

Nice find. This fits in nicely with my natural resource theme and the Buy/Write
strategy generates some pretty good income.

Madharry, I'll consider if I want to add to my GOOG position.

I've stood by my estimate of fair value, and maybe it looks like earnings and
margins are going to hold up well enough that the stock might actually see
$700, which in past is what I've figured I'd be trying to get for my shares.

From my 11/30/10 post:
"IF GOOG outstanding profit margins hold up, GOOG is worth a p/e of 25 or more.
IF the 12/'11 analyst average estimate for earnings is correct (about $33/sh),
GOOG fair value imo s/b over $800/sh --- higher than the $700 I've been
mentioning over the past couple of years."

I am just wondering if prospects for the stock itself are good enough now that
maybe I could also sell something that's maybe stalled out and buy more GOOG
with funds. For a chance that $700 might be reached sometime this year. It'd be
a 14% gain from current $611.

re GOOG - I would not give them full benefit $ for $ for the cash on hand. The
cash either just sit's there (dead money deserves a discount) or get's blown
for an overpriced acquisition. Shareholders will not see any of the stash as
dividends. So I believe the value of GOOG cash on hand should be discounted. My
take 100$ are worth 66$ (2/3)

The owners control everything via supervoting shares. My discount - 15%. If you
believe that is too high look where my BMW3.DE (nonvoting shares, slightely
higher dividend then voting shares) shares trade relative to BMW.DE (voting
shares) or Via versus Via.b.

So here I am: 610-66$ (discounted value of cash on hand)=544$ (adjusted GOOG
EV/share)
544/35$=15.5 PE *1.15 (adjusted for supervoting shares)=17.9 PE.

This is not expensive but it's not an ultracheap valuation either. GOOG is
rapidly maturing, growth rates are bound to go down. I think mid teend growth
rates may be possible for a while but I think the days of 30% growth are over
forever - the law of large numbers.

IMHO, GOOG is overpriced here. 20+ PE for megacaps is always a bubble
independent of the company, its leadership, monopoly or whatever. Megacap just
cannot grow at 20% clip for five years plus. And even if GOOG grows earnings at
20% for next 10 years (almost impossible) and then sells at 15 terminal PE, the
annual return will be only ~12%.

Of course, everyone will claim that GOOG is different, it's Gorilla, Godzilla,
King and everything else. And obviously overpriced Godzillas can become even
more overpriced as we know from history.

I am not a fan of Schmidt. IMHO he chanced to get into a golden machine and was
smart enough not to stand in its way. So maybe he was good. I doubt very much
Page can do better. I believe he can't. GOOG holders should hope that he does
not do much worse.

GOOG is still very strong search and advertising monopoly. And it is
positioning itself to become a Microsoft-like monopoly in smart phone arena
even though companies swore not to allow another Microsoft again. But it's
almost a repeat of PC age: there's a Fruit threat and everyone rushes to an
alternative: here comes MS-DOS, I mean, Android.

The only consolation is that companies may be able to sidestep paying GOOG too
much, since the OS is kind-of free. So maybe GOOG will end up more like Sun
with Java - Gorilla but broke - and less like Microsoft.

Disclosure: I have a very small position in GOOG that I have not sold yet. I as
a consumer hope that we won't have Google monopoly anywhere although as an
investor I should hope for opposite.

GOOG-once again i respectfully disagree. if i were the cfo i would look into
initiating a dividend,buy backs at this level, stock splits and down the road
spinoffs. The company does not need $35 billion on its books for sure. cash is
never dead, devaluing maybe but not dead.

For example I can certainly see a youtube spinoff down the road.

There are lots of ways for google to monetize those assets, as far the issue of
super voting rights, normally I would agree with you but in this case since
google is not going to be acquired anyway, I don think it matters so no
discount. as far as growth goes- I suppose when the internet stops growing and
cell phone growth worldwide slows google's growth will slow too. so if we have
10 years of 20% growth and then

10% growth, do you think the pe should be less than 20?

as far as android goes, its is free. google makes money when user use the
search feature on the mobile phone, and that usage is growing triple digits.

AAPL - tough question. The valuation is lower, but the market cap is 1/3
higher, which means that law of large numbers affect them even more than
Google. Also the growth has been tremendous, but IMHO the moat is easier to
cross than Google's search moat. E.g. there is a real risk that Android will
Microsoft (that's a verb :P) iPhone. And I am not sure whether tablet war is
over. Finally loss of Jobs is very significant whatever the Fruities will tell
you. So I feel that in some way AAPL is quite extended where they are and they
will have to do some heavy lifting to maintain and gain from here.

The really big question with AAPL is whether they can ever get out of the niche
player in PCs. Yeah, they have gone a long way and they have a very loyal crowd
playing for them, but they are still working with a niche mentality in a lot of
ways. If they can expand to a point where they are supermajor player, both
current market cap and a bigger one could be justified.

Valuation wise, I should sell GOOG and buy AAPL. However, I don't know if I
will do it. I may establish small position in AAPL if the stock falls to $300
or so. But I just don't know. :)

re GOOG -
>>10% growth, do you think the pe should be less than 20?<<

It might get the same multiple than MSFT in this case. I think a PE of 20 with
10% growth is a stretch unless general stock market valuations move much
higher. They also would need to start a substantial dividend as well.

I did not say that cash is dead, but if they don't use it or use it to buy
something for very steep prices, I think a discount is warranted. it's pretty
clear the market sees it this way because if companies decide to part from
their cash, their valuation typically benefits. Wouldn't you like it if they
would say, we don't need all that cash - we generate more from our business, so
we can issue a 100$ special dividend? The stock certainly would go up, which
tells me that the current situation is not an efficient use of capital.

One thing to note is that the quarter just reported by SVU was the 3rd quarter
of fiscal 2011. So, I'm hoping that sales start to somewhat stabilize in the
coming 12-15 months. We'll still go down at least a little over the coming
year, but hopefully then we'll bounce. Who knows?

From my standpoint, 2 pieces of the business have stabilized, the Supply Chain
business as well as the Save-A-Lot stores (1/2 the overall stores). The other
half of the stores are the higher-end stores which are still getting beat up by
Target, Walmart, and Costco and will decline again this year.

The question is, as SVU continues to sell off and/or close the higher-end
stores in small numbers and then setup new Save-A-Lots, when does the good
section of the business start beating the rough part? Hopefully, sooner rather
than later, but my guess is that we still go down in sales to some degree over
the next 12 months.

Hi Paul -

SPARTAN EXPL LTD (SXPRF.PK)
SPARTAN EXPLORATION LTD. (Toronto: SPE.TO )

http://www.spartanexp.com/documentation/Presentations/Spartan%20Presentation%20
%20Nov10.pdf

Spartan Exploration Ltd. engages in the exploration, development, and
production of oil and gas in Canada. The company holds interests in the oil and
gas properties located in southwest Saskatchewan and southeast Saskatchewan, as
well as in the west Pembina area of central Alberta. As of December 31, 2009,
it had total net proved reserves of 965.8 thousand barrels (mbbls) of light and
medium oil; 216.1 mbbls of heavy oil; 722 million cubic feet (mmcf) of natural
gas; and 55.3 mmbls of natural gas liquids. Spartan Exploration was founded in
2008 and is based in Calgary, Canada.

This company has ramped up their drilling program for 2011 and has budgeted
enough capital for 19 net new wells. They are drilling new wells to production
for about $1.7 million which is below the average cost for many of the
companies i have been following. Funding is from new stock, cash flow and
credit facility. Stock has rallied significantly in 2010 as they have increased
their proven reserves. Their reserves should double again in 2011.

Take a look and see if this one fits your criteria. Stock trades ok volume on
the Toronto exchange (208K AVG Volume) but on the pink sheets is yet to be
discovered.

Hi Grantcw -

One other option for SVU is the option of doing some company owned store sales
lease back arrangements with a private equity real estate REIT fund. I would
not really want to see this done but it would allow SVU to remodel more stores
faster and grow their same store sales.

If management decides to go this route, this would raise a red flag to me that
things are worse than expected. I would probably not add any new shares If I
saw this occur.

If the company begins to promote and expand their Supply Chain business
especially if they expand their operation into Canada and Mexico, this would be
a big plus for me.

The company has lots of options they can pursue and plenty of time as their
next big debt payment of $1.04B comes due in 2016. It's another big plus for
SVU that LT interest rates are at historical lows. This opens the door for
cheap refinancing of their LT debt which now averages just above 7%.

Welcome, nikkei86.

MGM too difficult for me to analyze to come to a fair value for the stock. I've

I'm looking for the slot business to do well with the spread of casino gaming
and the refresh of gaming machines. Technology here seems to be making the
machines more fun & involving for customers and more profitable for the
casinos. I hold a few shares of WMS. And decided I would buy a few of IGT after
I came back couple weeks ago from Las Vegas with an added stop at my local
indian Casino. IGT, the leader in the slot market, has slipped in past couple
of years, but seems to be coming back in terms of winning contracts with
casinos for its new games. Neither stock is a value stock at current price,
imo.

Plenty of people mid-week in all the casinos I saw in Las Vegas. No problem
though getting in at nicer celeb-chef restaurants, and table gaming limits were
lower than I expected (only $5 min at Venetian crap tables), so business still
not where it once was. OTOH, the hotel comp offers that I used to get monthly
are gone or much reduced. (Possibly because casinos don't need to reach so much
for customers now, and maybe more so because I'm not going to Vegas enough to
be considered a worthy customer/player.) I had to really search for a cheap

One thing I can't ignore is that commodities and equities prices are rising.
And so is consumer spending. I just read an article in today's New York Times
about American Express upgrading its perks to customers because of increased
spending. Here's a quote from the article:

The company is starting the program to tap into what she said is an increase in
spending among its wealthiest clients.

"The economy is starting to pick up so there is more of an interest now in
people out there spending,” Ms. Fish said. “Auto is something we haven’t done
before. We wanted to do something robust.”

This definitely has to be the Fed's liquidity injections hitting the system.
And this money will eventually work its way to the consumer. If it does, hard
hit sectors like gaming could see a nice rebound.

I'm not sure how much you guys pay attention to the macro stuff, but it's hard
for me to ignore since I'm really in to economics and the business cycle. As
long as the Fed keeps printing, there is a good chance for recovery.

As far as Macau, check out Entertainment Gaming Asia. EGT. They're opening
casinos in some very niche markets. Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. I'm a little
bearish on Macau in the short-term because of the bubble developing in China.
I'm not sure how any collapse in China's economy would affect Macau.

a reputation for bad economics, it’s the reputation of the business that
remains intact." :/

Did you look at DCIX spinoff from DSX? I got such a tiny amount of shares that
this does not even count as an exploratory position.

MRO - I'd want to buy lower than here.

re DSX -Shipping is not a bad business, it is a very cyclical business.
Cyclical and bad are not the same thing.

I choose DSX specifically because of the low leverage. There is not risk with
dilution at the bottom, which is the main risk with leveraged cyclical business
(like banks etc.). I think we both agree here that DSX management appears to be
above average.

One thing I see supporting the valuation for ships is increasing steel (and
scrap metal!) prices. Steel is an important input for shipbuilders obviously
and with the steep rise in steel prices, this should support the value of
ships. I also think that higher scrap metal prices may support scraping of
older ships that are marginal to operate at current conditions.

I did not buy MRO, I sold 1/2 of my position. The other 1/2 will be gone too at
current prices once it reaches LT gain status.

Paul, what would be the idea behind a JNJ play? Wouldn't an index be more
appropriate? I mean, what is the upside in a company with a market cap of $160
billion?

With those plays, it seems the upside is capped, the overall situation is
marginal, and you have to deal with all of the Wall Street BS of earnings
estimates and what not. Furthermore, with so many watching a stock like JNJ,
isn't it pretty much priced correctly?

Then again, I guess it does depend on the strategy. But shouldn't value be a
tad more aggressive than JNJ?

Nikkei86. The issue for me with an index is that when you buy you are buying
all of the stocks in the index at their then current price. And similarly when
you are selling.

It could be a mistake to believe large mega-caps have limited upside. Look at
GE in one year, GOOG, others. OTOH, in recent past many old stalwarts - JNJ,
WMT, some others -- haven't done well with stock gains. Earnings have
increased, p/e's have come down, and in future, the stocks may rise (maybe).
With some of these though, I feel I've been so patient that I've wasted time,
so I have exited.

With stocks like JNJ, the many people watch for different reasons -- some are
day or swing traders, some are indexers, some are buying for dividend, some
just based on JNJ's conservative long-term history. The sum total of these
people's buys/sells determines the price, not necessarily the value for someone
looking at JNJ as a value stock, imo.

Not sure now if value should be "more aggressive" or not. JNJ coulda/woulda
worked for me in a diversified IRA portfolio based on its (JNJ's) dividend
yield + dividend increases and some hoped-for price appreciation in JNJ stock.
I got all that (being in JNJ since 2/'09, with subsequent adds through 10/'10),
but not enough to satisfy me. So before the fact, it seemed suitable enough and
aggressive enough for me; after three-years, something wasn't aggressive
enough: either I wasn't aggressive enough in buying/selling, the business just
did not appreciate enough (management wasn't aggressive enough in securing
business performance), or the category of stock (these large mega-caps) maybe
by their size, is if not limiting, at least very trying of one's patience. I do
not know.

Paul - Thanks for your insight into AEI.TO and TOL.V, and E_K_S for mentioning
SPE.TO.

Trying to get a handle on why one company deserves a certain share price over
another (may never happen). Using AEI.TO, SPE.TO and TOL.V to start. I also
review the weekly and monthly charts for historical purposes.

All are junior oil companies, and exploring/producing in good areas. All have
been raising money through financing.

I have perused the company web sites and try to compare apples to apples (I do
not find deciphering quarterly reports or financial statements easy). I took
what you detailed on AEI.TO as a succinct start and compared it to SPE.TO and
TOL.V, and here are my findings:

Arsenal Energy (AEI.to/AEYIF) (almost entirely from your post):

Founded (?) – in operation since at least 2004

1. It's 75% oil/gas
2. It's in N. Dakota Three Forks Bakken
3. It's in a couple of other shales (Central Alberta for light oil)
4. Current production approximately 2250 boe/d. Expect approximately "3300
boe/d exit rate '11; 85% oil". (2006 production was approximately 1900 boe/d)
5. Approximately 1M in cash on hand at end 3Q
6. Share price closed at 0.96 as of 25 Jan 11(highest share price 30 Sep 05 –
1.93)

Spartan Exploration Ltd – SPE.TO

Founded in 2008

1. Current production 82% oil
2. In Pembina central Alberta and the Cardium. Also in SW and SE Saskatchewan
3. Into shales (?)
4. Approximately 1800 boe/d in 2010 to be increased to 2500 to 3000 boe/d by
end 2011.
5. Has 2.2M working capital and a 12M line of credit (not being used according
to Dec 2010 presentation)
6. Share price closed at 5.22 as of 25 Jan 11

TriOil Resources – TOL.TO

Founded in 2009

1. Current production approximately 45% oil/55% gas
2. In Sanish and Bakken – SE Saskatchewan. In Pekisko light oil resource play
at Queenstown, S. Alberta
3. Into shales (?)
4. Current production approx 1500 boe/d. Details for 2011 to be stated in Jan
2011.
5. Trouble reading financials – going to get the daughter to explain them to
me.
6. Share price closed at 4.50 as of 25 Jan 11.

Interesting look into these companies. Be hard pressed to delineate between the
three. The way the market is right now, probably best to monitor and see what
the next quarters and presentations bring.

Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.

I do not own any at this time.

Hi 7Years -

I too have been trying to compare these junior oil companies "apples-to-apples"
with some way to rank them especially with the recent move in all of these E&P
companies.

I came across a term called "Netback" which may be useful in evaluating well
development.

http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netback.asp
"... A summary of all the costs associated with bringing one unit of oil to the
marketplace, and all of the revenues from the sale of all the products
generated from that same unit. The netback is calculated by taking all of the
revenues from the oil, less all costs associated with getting the oil to a
market. These costs can include, but are not limited to, importing,
transportation, production and refining costs, and royalty fees....".

Many of these smaller companies are spending a lot of money drilling new wells
to increase their proven reserves. The value opportunity IMO is at the end of
the day is: (1) What are their proven reserves and (2) What did it cost for
them to bring the oil/NG into production. Their Netback amount (by well, by
region and/or by drilling period) is a good measure of how well they are at
bring a well into production.

I also like the companies that are large enough (and w/ experience in completed
wells) that drilling is almost a cookie cutter approach. They usually have
entered into a long term contract w/ a drilling Rig owner and have enough wells
planned to keep the rig & employees busy over the entire contract term. It
takes a good drilling team about 29 days to complete a well. I have been
focusing on companies that have 24-40 wells planned for the year. This way they
can contract for at least one or perhaps two separate drill rigs w/ crew. A
well should take anywhere from $1.5-$2.0 million to complete.

Companies that have over 800 active wells begin to reach the economies of scale
and efficiency for gathering services and/or production & distribution, storage
and hedging. A lot depends on where their wells are located, how concentrated
they are in specific region(s) and what side deals they have w/ JV partners.
The larger operators have a lot of this already figured out and the really
smart ones have planned their developmental wells way ahead identifying fields
ready for a MLP gathering contract and JV partners with tons of cash to help
finance the new wells scheduled for development.

You might also want to check out RAM Energy Resources, Inc. (RAME)(
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=RAME+Key+Statistics ) as they have grown their
proven reserves through acquisition and now have several 1000 producing wells.
They were a bit extended but recently sold some non-core NG assets to reduce
debt. The stock seems like a good value when comparing risk/reward.

I guess that if everything was clear cut and easy to evaluate everybody would
be investing in this sector. The key is to try to find the diamond in the rough
that has a lot of good assets and the money to develop the resources. My
preference is to spread my money around w/ several companies. I do prefer some
of the larger more established companies but you usually have to pay a premium.

Its interesting to see what other investors feel is "value" and the criteria
they use to quantify that.

I had the idea it was time to take a position in hospitality awhile back, and
got into MDH, SPPR, and HPT. All REITS. First two very small and thinly traded
and with no current dividend (things have been tough). HPT bigger and pays a
good dividend.

Current revenue will not get them far. But I think all of these are trading a
fair amount less than building replacement cost. Not much is being built new.
Sooner or later things should improve on the revenue side. Or that's the
theory. And that's the gamble.

AFSI - Based on earnings it's cheap. Based on P/Book, it's not. P/Book makes
more sense for insurer valuations than for other companies, so this is somewhat
important.

One problem is that AFSI has only 4 years of public history. Short history does
not give you a lot of info. You don't know how conservative their underwriting
is and what their float investment acumen is. You cannot see their history of
growing company's book value. They may have great results when they are writing
business, but crash when they have to pay out. They may make a lot of money on
RMBSes, double-CDOs or junk bonds when they are going up, but crash when these
default. So really with insurance companies you have to buy the management and
with recently public companies you buy management even more.

I don't know the managers of AFSI. It seems that CEO has been around since
pre-IPO. From its 10Q it seems that they do a lot of wheeling and dealing. They
have entities and related party transactions for reinsurance, capital
management, life settlements, etc. With these it becomes a question which
company is more important to the management: AFSI, reinsurer (MHLD), capital
manager or what. It's not clear these related party transactions really benefit
everyone equally.

When I look at FRFHF or L, I am pretty sure that the management's goal is to
maximize the value of FRFHF or L. With AFSI, I am not so certain.

It might be worthwhile to establish a small position in AFSI and monitor it. I
am not sure yet if I will do this or not.

Hi Paul - This deal announced after the market close today. The Hospah field
(located in New Mexico) seems like a perfect fit for LEI w/ additional
financing to be obtained from JV partners. Oil and gas production from the
Hospah Sandstones reservoirs since 1927 have yielded nearly 22 million barrels
of oil and nearly 53 MCF of gas through 2005.

Re: Lucas Energy, Inc. (LEI)

Lucas Energy Enters Into Letter of Intent and Partially Funds Oil and Gas
Acquisition of Up to $20.5 Million

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Lucas-Energy-Enters-Into-pz-2716731132.html?x=0&.
=1

From the article:"..."Strategically, this acquisition fits our business model
of reworking old fields and plays to our core strengths," commented William A.
Sawyer, president and CEO of Lucas Energy. "It also diversifies our asset base
out of Texas."

The acquisition covers six shallow producing units and more than 100 existing
well bores drilled to the Hospah oil and Dakota gas formations in McKinley
County, New Mexico. Production averaged approximately 100 barrels per day of
light sweet crude during 2010. Management believes that daily production can be
increased to 500 barrels of oil and 2 million cubic feet of gas in the first
year at a capital cost under $9 million. The development plan includes
deepening certain wells and using them to re-inject formation water into
non-producing zones, putting existing wells back on production, and by removing
carbon dioxide from the natural gas to bring it up to pipeline quality....".

=======================================================

It will be interesting to see how the stock reacts to this news tomorrow. It's
not in the Eagle Ford area (that you prefer) but management believes this can
be a profitable venture which can be structured using JV partner's financing.
$2 Million is a pretty big bet for this company (6.4% of their market Cap.).

7 years. It's not going to be in the financials imo, and so I guess your
daughter's explanations aren't going to be of much help. Jmo, I could be very
wrong.

How does one evaluate an oil company? I guess -- it depends.

Large mega-caps: on p/e
Mid level stuff: price to something. Price to cash flow. Maybe EV to Ebita?
Small stuff: There's no earnings, so how to value? Price to nav? What is nav?
(I like 2pnav10). Price to flowing barrel? I like that too. What price to put
on a flowing barrel? Consider EKS's net-back as a start. (I have my general
number.) Or another way, how about just betting on the management if you find
some leader/team with history (prior company) of delivering results to
stockholders (e.g. now with MHR, TAT)

Just use McDep ratios (market cap and debt to present value of energy
business)?
http://www.mcdep.com/

What would be the steps? As you suggest, how about starting with the company
itself and trying to value it itself on its financials. I'm still learning
here.
Then maybe the area it's in. I'm still learning here too. What ARE the best
areas (shale plays) going forward?

Sometimes -- as is my usual proclivity -- I'll like a subsector (here being a
particular oil shale, ie. ND Bakken or Alberta Bakken or Eagle Ford, etc., and
I'll just take on a basket of stocks in it. Sometimes then, the area overrides
the valuation I'm able to put on an individual stock in that area. That is, for
me, I just buy the stock as part of a package of stocks in the subsector. On
the assumption the good guys in the basket will outshine the dogs there if I've
picked the right subsector at the right time/price.

So yes, I'm holding SPE.to, TOL.to, RAME, AEI.to. and many, many, many more. Of
these four though, I'm buying significantly more AEI because the way I look at
it, if AEI does actually meet its '11 oil production target (3300 boe/d exit
rate '11; 85% oil), it is undervalued on a flowing production basis. TOL? Well,
it's big relative to its size in the Alberta Cardium, but that's imo a story
for 2013, so there's more time for that one, and maybe right now it's not such
a compelling buy. (For me though, if I can be patient, okay to enter now.)

For me, given that I'm buying lots of stocks in several shale plays, it follows
(to my mind anyway, maybe not to the value proposition though) that I'd be
interested in the companies that are actually doing the fracing for these shale
e&p's. I have a few shares of GasFrac Energy Services, Inc. (GFS.V/GSFVF.PK).
Added recently also Canyon Services Group Inc. (FRC.TO/CYSVF.PK), and may add a
little more.

Zazove Associates, LLC filed a 13G report stating that they now hold (or

the recent convertible offering (2,330,459 shares issuable upon the conversion
of Ultrapetrol Bahamas Limited 7.25% Convertible Bond due 01-15-2017 plus
29,901,463 common shares previously held).

What's interesting is that the majority of their shares are common shares (92%)
vs 8% from the convertible bond when converted. I would of thought that they
would have held more of the convertible bond to generate income for their fund.

They must like the risk/reward that the common shares provide.

When I checked w/ Schwab about acquiring some of this bond issue, they could

takes a lot of digging.

Do you have any thoughts on diversification? I remember watching one fund

Lol, you got wrong guy when you ask me about diversification, nikkei86. In some
ways I'm going to be the most diversified guy you've ever come across --- I
almost always carry many more than 200 positions at the same time. Otoh, maybe
now --past few months-- not so diversified: I've got more than 50 different
positions just in oil related companies.

There are, what, maybe 25,000 stocks or more that are publicly traded? What's
wrong with trying to find and buy the top 1%, given the criteria that you use?
Or in my case, stocks that meet the criteria that I use.

My issue with most people as regards diversification is that people don't
diversify enough by time. Thus, if you are playing broad market moves, and if
you are buying ETFs for that, you are buying all the stocks at the same time
for one market move-- so no time diversification there.

"I think 10 stocks at most. After that, statistical studies show that the
benefits of diversification start to decline." Provide references. Otherwise I
say balderdash. There are categories such as growth stocks, value stocks, large
cap stocks, small cap stocks, stocks that are being held that are not quite
buys or sells yet (time diversification), dividend stocks, reit stocks, foreign
small cap, foreign large, foreign value, Graham net-net, special situations.
How the Hell can anyone say they are diversified when they have only ten stocks
in their portfolio?

And I don't believe in 30 either. That's some academic's easy number that looks
good possibly because it's when sample sizes move from Studen't t to normal --
supposedly. That number is nowhere near enough for a diversified portfolio to
capture max returns with min risk.

We can have a conversation about the argument, "I keep a concentrated portfolio
of my best ideas, because why should I buy or hold something that is my 31st of
51st or whatever best idea?" Or pay a manager for his 31st or 51st?

Because the person is in the market every day and should be alert to price
changes which make formerly unattractive stocks very attractive. And things
take time to work out, so you can't be switching out of something that looked
good two days or two weeks or two months ago for something that looks better
now. That way leads to madness and/or ruination. -g-
And as stated here by several people, the issue is that one never really knows
what one's best ideas are except in retrospect: I am almost always, maybe
always, surprised as to what my best performers turn out to be. As a corollary,
sometimes the stocks I am most comfortable buying (as for example, my best
ideas) turn out to be the stocks that fail to perform as well as the stocks I
bought where I was uncomfortable in stepping up or reaching down for them.
(i.e. these stocks weren't my best ideas at the time)

their portfolios, and they only manage to beat the market by 1% or 2%. God
knows there are others who underperform, too. When you get to 200+ your beta
has to be pretty close to 1.

I do understand, however, that the strategy is most likely better than an index
strategy. But it's far from a value strategy. You'll never see the effect of a
10-bagger on your portfolio.

"How the Hell can anyone say they are diversified when they have only ten
stocks in their portfolio?"

Well, call 10 stocks what you want, but I think it's the only way to see some
serious returns. You're not going to get 15% over the Dow with 200+ in the
portfolio.

In general, I think people are eager to play the markets, so they load up on
marginal situations.

"the issue is that one never really knows what one's best ideas are except in
retrospect"

But how does this statement fit into value investing? You invest because you
have a strong belief in the prospects for the company. Because you've done the
homework. When I saw the iPod come out, I knew Apple stood a awesome chance of
appreciating. There aren't many Apple plays, but I think that's the point. Load
up on the few great plays. It's one of the basic principles of Munger.

"people don't diversify enough by time"

I'm not sure I understand completely. You always want to invest at the right
time. The point is to invest in companies that will throw off tons of cash;
companies that are strong buys. When you foresee that trend changing, then it's
time to get out. But I would never invest in stocks that aren't buys or sells
yet.

If you knew about the iPod and Apple in 2003, would you have stuck only
.0000000000000000000005% in the company? What's the point? You load up with a
stock like that.

Mad, but do these nice situations exist anymore? By 'nice' I mean plugging the
numbers into some model that comes up with a fair value for the stock based on
decades of data. Those plays have to be gone, for the most part. With all the
technology on Wall Street. In the 60s when Buffett was operating, they were
still around, but not now.

The nice thing about investing is that you don't necessarily lose 100% when
you're wrong, unlike gambling. The only way to make money in this game is to
load up on the few situations that you find compelling. You have to take the
risk. The magic of compounding isn't going to work for marginal situations.
You'll become a billionaire in 10,000 years. I don't have 10,000 years.
