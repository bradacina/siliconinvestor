Hi Paul - Have you used the new Google search site called
"http://scholar.google.com ". This is a beta site that provides research only
indexed items. I did a search for "value investing", "Graham" and "Buffet".
Here is one of the 41 articles that came up;
(http://ifecorp.com/Papers-PDFs/Carlson1099.pdf ).

I found it quite interesting. Anyway, you might want to add this site to your
tool box.

I am still looking at the chicken producers and really like the No. 3 player
GKIS (Gold Kist Inc)you recently discussed and may begin to accumulate shares
in this one rather than SAFM (Sanderson Farms Inc). I think a small portion of
the portfolio in this sector is a smart investment and provides a good "value"
play.

SFL and FRO announced their earnings and company forecasts last week. SFL
raised their dividend from $0.35 to $0.45 and continue to participate in 20% of
the profit sharing agreement with FRO. I think $20/share is an excellent entry
point, so my strategy is to sell naked Puts to buy more shares and hedge a
portion of my holding (bought between $17 & $21) with May $25 calls collecting
another two dividend payments.

Several of my natural gas company plays reported and I am extremely satisfied
with UGI (UGI Corp) and management's conservative style. This stock is up 18%
from when I mentioned it earlier this year. That does not include the 3%
dividend either! They upped their earnings forecast based on (1) a better than
expected valuation (from independent auditors) of their recent acquisition and
(2) higher revenue cash flows from this operation than previously estimated.
This signals to me that management went into the deal with very conservative
expectations and as they gain operational experience with the "real" numbers,
they will up the overall estimates higher.

Finally TRP (TransCanada Corp) is another one I mentioned at the same time as
UGI and is up 26% and that pays a 4% dividend not included in the gain. This
company is set up to participate in the delivery of natural gas on both U.S.
coasts. They just acquired the exclusive rights to the western distribution
pipe line. They have excellent long term growth prospects.

I would like to buy more shares of each company but it's hard to buy at higher
prices. I guess from my years of investing, it is good to average up. I will be
looking to buy more of each company on dips if possible.

We also saw this week the shrewed (and crook IMO) investment hedge fund put
together the Sears buyout. I believe the loosers were the common shareholders
both for K-Mart and now Sears. Unfortunately, the common share holders had no
advocate for them in the back room of the bankruptcy court when all the deals
were put together. That's a shame.

Keep your eye on ABS and JCP for some possible similar deal. It's possible that
ABS is the best bet and would only happen once their $1.5 billion convertible
preferred expires in June 2007.

Just to follow up on my post exactly one week ago on Storm Cat Energy:

Here is what happened this week:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=SME.V&t=5d

Risk was substantially reduced when they announced acquistion of production in
the Powder River Basin of Wyoming this past week. They also announced a Alaska
acquisition. Thus revenues will begin which will enable the company to list on
the Toronto exchange and get better exposure.

I am going to post the elevator pitch one last time. Note what Schaefer said on
Thursday at the very bottom. I like elevator pitches because I can do due
diligence very quickly on the named company. Plus it summarizes my thinking of
why I believe this is a outstanding investment opportunity. I did the same
thing here when I posted a elevator pitch on net-net Dixon Ticongeroga some
time ago. I wish more people here would post elevator pitches so all can see
the due dilgence they have done and their thought process on the selection.

The market cap of Storm Cat is still very tiny. We have only begun. Thank you
for allowing me to share here. Value? What is 12 million acres of coalbed
methane acres in Mongolia worth? What is a CEO like Zimmerman worth? Why CBM?
No dry holes for one. To what extent is the acquisition of production reduce
risk?

New Coalbed Methane Company--Wyoming-Canada-Alaska-Mongolia (China)

The September 30, 2004 $ 2.1 BILLION acquisition of Evergreen Resources, a
leader in CBM technology, by Pioneer Natural Resources created this
opportunity.

Evergreen's Vice President of Operations and Engineering, Scott Zimmerman, age
48, was out of a job. His annual CBM drilling budget at Evergreen was
approximately $ 200 million!!!!!!!!

Scott spent from 1982 to 2002 with private JM Huber heading up their large CBM
properties. He earned only a salary during that period. At Evergreen he was
third in command but did not have the stock holdings that the other two had.
Zimmerman was now very hungry to build his own major CBM company.

On October 19, 2004, less than one month after the Evergreen acquisition, Scott
Zimmerman joined tiny ($ 30 million market cap) Storm Cat Energy (SME or SMEFF
in US) as CEO and President. He has immense CBM expertise developed over 22
years. Mr. Zimmerman's references have stated he is "the BEST CBM operator in
the COUNTRY."

This is a China Play also in that Storm Cat controls 12 million acres of
Coalbed Methane in Mongolia. In addition the company recently acquired
production in the Wyoming Powder River Basin and thus now has revenues.

I have decided to send this alert out now and will have my complete report in
December and will feature a new gold stock this month.

Storm Cat Energy TSXV:SME SMEFF U.S.

Shares outstanding 12.0 million approx. Very small market cap.

There is 3 main reasons to buy this stock

Management, management and management

The next 2 reasons are the huge gas potential of their Mongolia property and:
Management's connections will mean some excellent acquisitions in North America
such as the one announced Monday. The key thing to understand about Storm Cat
is the management expertise that is assembled for this tiny junior company is
as good or better than what you would find in the best senior oil&gas
companies. Storm Cat has extensive expertise in Coal Bed Methane (CBM). In the
current market environment of high natural gas prices and the dwindling supply
of conventional gas supplies, CBM is an area that will receive a lot of focus
in the years ahead. Storm Cat's personal have plenty of experience in
developing CBM projects in the U.S., but the CBM potential in Canada is just in
its infancy. I expect Storm Catwill pick up CBM projects in Canada as well as
in the U.S., on top of the giant Mongolia project they already have.

Management

The company was formed in 2000 to focus on producing oil and gas from
unconventional reservoirs: tight sandstones, coal seams, and organic rich
shales, the company says on its website, www.stormcatenergy.com. These are
reservoirs that have been neglected in many parts of the world, as they require
extensive technical knowledge from both geological and engineering perspectives

On Oct. 19 the company announced that one of its directors, Scott Zimmerman of
Denver, has been named president of the company. Until recently, Zimmerman was
vice president of operations and engineering for Denver-based Evergreen
Resources Inc. Evergreen Resources, a Rockies-based coalbed methane producer,
has been working a coalbed methane prospect in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough
north of Anchorage. Pioneer Natural Resources acquired Evergreen in May, and
Storm Cat invited Zimmerman to lead Storm Cat Energy in expanding the company's
coalbed methane projects and initiatives in North America and Asia, the company
said.

Scott Zimmerman had twenty years of service with J.M. Huber and then two with
Evergreen. Mr. Zimmerman spent 20 years specializing in CBNG exploration and
development in the Rocky Mountain region, with emphasis on the San Juan and
Powder River Basins. Prior to J.M. Huber, Mr. Zimmerman was the Senior
Production & Reservoir Engineer with Amoco Production Company. Mr. Zimmerman
received a BS in Petroleum Engineer from Texas Tech University in 1979 and is a
member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Brian Mahood is a senior exploration and development geologist with over 34
years experience in the Canadian petroleum industry. Mr. Mahood obtained a
Bachelor of Science (Geology) degree from the University of British Columbia in
1970 and completed the majority of a Master of Business Administration from the
University of Calgary. He has held intermediate and senior management positions
with both junior and senior oil and gas companies. Mr. Mahood has extensive
experience in conventional and coalbed methane exploration and development
geology, acquisition and divestiture of properties, horizontal well feasibility
studies, project economics and the management of exploration strategy, programs
and budgets. He was a member of the Alberta Department of Energy 2001 Coalbed
Methane Economics

Sub-Committee.

Yaro Horachek is President of Geo-ing Resource Consulting Ltd. He has 30 years
of experience in Coal exploration, Coal-bed methane exploration and evaluation,
development, and planning of Coal deposits in western Canada and
internationally. His experience with industry and government includes Shell
Oil, Energy Utility Board of Alberta, Alberta and British Columbia governments,
and numerous oil and gas and mining companies.

Dr. Bereskin, director is President of Bereskin and Associates Inc. He has 20
years of experience consulting in the petroleum industry domestically and
internationally, most of which involve coal bed methane and tight gas
operations. Importantly, Dr. Bereskin is a pioneer in recent technological
advances of shale gas production in the United States, such as the Barnett
shale. He is also currently an adjunct professor at the University of Utah,
responsible for teaching courses in petroleum geology.

Technical Advisory Board

The Advisory board is made up of 4 members that include:

Dr. John Seidle has more than twenty years experience in unconventional gas,
primarily in coalbed methane. As a Senior Reservoir Engineer with Sproule
Associates, Inc in Denver, Colorado, he is involved in the technical and
economic aspects of coalbed methane exploration, production, and enhanced
recovery and teaches an industry short course on CBM. His extensive experience
includes US, Canadian, and several international coal basins. He received his
Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Colorado and is a
Registered Professional Engineer in Oklahoma, Colorado, and Wyoming. He has
authored nineteen technical papers and has been awarded six patents.

Dr. R. Marc Bustin is professor of petroleum and coal geology in the Department
of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and
president of RMB Earth Science Consultants and a principal of CBM Solutions
Ltd. He has over 30 years experience in the petroleum sector, with broad
experience in the realm of fossil fuels both in research and in his consultancy
practice. His professionalexperience includes employment by Mobil Oil Canada,
Gulf Canada Resources (prior to joining UBC) and subsequently one year with
Elf-Aquitaine (France), CSIRO (France) and CNRS (Australia). Dr. Bustin has
published over 150 scientific articles on fossil fuels.

Properties

Mongolia exploration ---China Connection

The company is about to become a production company with news of a new
acquisition, but most important is their actively in Mongolia, where they
signed a production sharing contract with the Petroleum Authority of Mongolia
in February, an agreement ratified by the government of Mongolia in May. The
agreement requires a minimum commitment of US$4.8 million over a five-year term
and allows for the exploration and development of natural gas from coal. Storm
Cat said Oct. 21 that it completed a planned surface mapping project this
summer in Southern Gobi in Mongolia, and then began stratigraphic drilling in
the Narlin Sikhait region of southern Mongolia, collecting continuous core
samples from eight exploratory holes.

Storm Cat said it cored important coal accumulation of more than 41 meters in
total thickness, occurring in as many as 10 separate seams. Most drilling
depths were limited to 150 meters due to mechanical constraints of the
cost-effective Mongolian rig. The company said it designed the shallow drilling
locations to sub-parallel the coal exposures along the 70 kilometer length of
the Narlin Sukrait thrust fault.

To put the next paragraph in perspective, coal seams with a thickness of just 1
meter (3 feet) can be economic to develop. Storm Cat’s coalbeds in Mongolia
consist of at least nine coal seams lying on top of each other. The thickest
individual coal seam is over 250 feet thick! This is over double the thickness
of the thickest and richest coal seams in the entire United States and this is
only one coal seam out nine known to exist.

Storm Cat said seven of these eight exploratory wells encountered substantial
amounts of coal. Management concluded the eighth well bore was simply unable to
reach the coal-bearing intervals due to the depth restrictions of the small
drilling rig.

A larger drilling rig from another driller is moving into selected locations
where up to three wells will be drilled and cores taken down to 900 meters
south of the Narlin Sukhait thrust fault, where gas content work will
evaluatethe gas richness of the various coal seams, Storm Cat said. A North
American gas content or desorption company Hampton, Waechter & Associates is
assisting with data collection and is providing gas content measurements. These
deeper tests will also attempt to document the occurrence of coal
cleating, Storm Cat said.

Storm Cat said Oct. 28 that it has agreed in principle with the Petroleum
Authority of Mongolia to negotiate terms of a formal joint exploration
agreement covering coal deposits which the company believes may contain natural
gas. It is also important to note that China is developing a new gas
pipeline that will run near the project area, so any gas foundcan be brought to
market in the not too distant future.

While Mongolia is important, I expect Mr. Zimmerman he is going to focus on
Wyoming and also in Canada. Mongolia is huge (12 million acres) and potentially
contains 3 to 7 trillion cubic feet of gas, but this may turn out to be just
the icing on the cake. They will probably do a JV in Mongolia and then focus
their resources in the areas that Zimmerman knows in the U.S. and Canada.

Storm Cat is already in negotiations for acquisitions in Western Canada. The
Western Canadian operations are headed up by the talented Brian Mahood and Mike
O’byrne. Brian is a 30 year veteran of the Western Canadian oil & gas scene
specializing in coalbed methane opportunities for StormCat. Mike O’byrne is a
well-respected landman that has worked in Western Canada all his life.

Wyoming, 1481 acres

On November 15th Storm Cat announced the acquisition of a 100-per-cent working
interest (81.5-per-cent net interest) in 1,481 acres of the Jamison/North
Twenty Mile fields located in Campbell county, Wyoming. Geologically, these
fields are located on the eastern flank of the Powder River basin coal bed
natural gas region.

Originally placed in production in early 2002, these fields are currently
producing at a rate of approximately one million cubic feet per day of natural
gas from 28 producing wells. The current production derives from the Anderson
and Canyon coal seams, with gross and net proven reserves of 1.148 billion
cubic feet and 0.842 billion cubic feet,respectively, and gross and net
probable reserves of 3.231 billion cubic feet and 2.37 billion cubic feet,
respectively. The reserve estimates were provided by Sproule Associates in
Denver, Colo.

In consideration of the acquisition, the company has paid $1.25-million (U.S.)
for the properties. The effective date of the transaction is Dec. 1, 2004.

A total of six coal seams exist in the area, including the Anderson and Canyon.
The company believes two of the lower coal seams, the Cook and the Wall,
provide sufficient thickness to warrant testing and development through the
drilling of new wells. In addition, the company feels the Smith coal seam is a
good candidate for recompletion of certain existing wells, but no reserves were
attributed to it in the Sproule analysis.

Financial

As of June 30 2004 the company had $1.1 million in cash and no long term debt.
A $3.4 million financing was announced on November 1st.

Summary

I expect further acquisitions will help push the stock higher along with
positive exploration results in Mongolia and North American properties.

I believe that the management behind this company intends on building a
substantial oil& gas company focusing on CBM and with any luck this
stock might do half as well as Ultra Petroleum did for us ($1.30 to $65).

The stock chart may look like the stock has already seen a substantial move but
the company is still only valued at C$30 million and I would expect we could
easily see $4 to $5 with this stock in the next 6 months and maybe sooner,
depending how quickly SME moves to acquire other projects and what stage of
development they are at.

The recent acquisition in Campbell county, Wyoming is such a project that could
easily be developed further to bring production up to multiples of the current
1 mcf/d. I expect it will take at least 6 to 12 months before we see these
production increases, but the stock will likely anticipate these developments
as new well test results come in.

Schaefer Newsletter November 18, 2004 stated:

StormCat SME-TSX.V announced an actual production acquisition in the Powder
River Basin of Wyoming. I believe this makes StormCat the first and only junior
Canadian explorer with actual CBM production.

StormCat bought this property because they believe they can increase production
significantly in a relatively short period of time. This property will generate
a good deal of cashflow and increased production means increased cashflow. This
is just the beginning.

When I first introduced StormCat President Scott Zimmerman to you, I told you
he was a company builder. I didn’t say that because it sounded good, I said it
because that is what this guy lives and breathes for. He is a company builder.
He has the expertise, the knowledge, the contacts, and the experience when it
comes to unconventional gas to get the job done.

That’s why I say this is only the beginning for StormCat Energy. This company
is going to grow rapidly through both exploration and acquisition.

A year from now we’ll look back and say how lucky we are we were able to get in
at $2.00 a share. " END

I'll start an exploratory position in Korea Electric Power (KEP).

Madharry, were you the person who posted on a couple of Korean stocks? I don't
remember, and SI search engine doesn't go back far enough to check. Would you
(or anyone else here) have a comment on KEP?

The stock's come off a base and is at a multi-year high. I don't like that ---
maybe buyers now have missed the party.
(S&P, 8/12/04 said avoid the shares @$9.54 for their 12 mo. target at $7. KEP's
risen over $12 now.)

Profit margins for this company are pretty good, when I consider KEP's current
and forward (estimated) p/e. (Margins range 8-14% approx. over the past 6-7
years.) And while roe is generally poor (often between 4-6%), that roe number
is off a book value that is often twice what the stock sells for.(i.e. roe on
purchase price is higher than 4-6%). There's also about a 3% dividend yield
(according to the Wall St. Journal - Yahoo isn't clear).

According to what I read, "the company generates substantially all of the
electricity consumed in Korea." A monopoly position countervailed by the
government. Perhaps that limits KEP's profits or business, but maybe it also
means the gov't has an interest in seeing KEP kept profitable enough.

Madharry, fwiw, I'll add a few shares now to my very small position in
Brazilian oil company, PZE.

I am going on the assumption that sometimes regional oil companies can be

Though I offer no facts to support that this assumption is so, or that it
applies now to PZE. (PZE itself, though small, does operate transnationally.)
Just that PZE stock doesn't seem to have made the good up moves that we've seen

PERY, one of my picks,has stumbled on an earnings outlook and downgrade by a
couple of analysts. I've added a bit to my position today.

Company still expects earnings about $2.10-$2.20 for the year ending 01/'05
which makes forward p/e under 10. At current price, stock sells about stated
book value (many acquisitions here, so tangible bv will be much lower). Book
has increased every year for the past ten.

PSR is now less than .33 - not terribly inexpensive. OTOH, the stock's sold at
a higher average psr than .3 for maybe seven of the past ten years.

I believe Carl Icahn is still a major stockholder (A positive imo, since I

sometimes it seems he gets HIS profit while leaving other investors with
losses.)

Psr is decent compared to past years. Paying about twice book - seems high, but
p/bk's been much higher in past years. Profit margins up past few years - but
they do fluctuate when looking back further. For what you pay to get the stock,
profit margin avg. (past few years) of 8% (roughly) is decent.

As you likely know, an important issue for the stock buyer is the relationship
among analysts and Silverman. That is, Mr. Silverman's penchant for
acquisitions is very much frowned upon by 'the market'. Also - if I remember
right - and I could be wrong here - there is some question about Mr.
Silverman's past business dealings or trouble with gov't (???)

For me, there's a high shame factor. This stock was mentioned here several
times by several posters when it appeared the company was in some trouble
(overextended apparently). And there was some indication then that value fund
managers were buying. Stock was selling at half its price now. For no reason
that I remember, I failed to act. Kind of poo-pood the stock. Very wrong. Oh
the shame. -g- Anyway, I've been reluctant to look back at CD.

This stock fluctuates quite a bit it seems. Maybe that has something to do with
the fact the company is a conglomerate tied to housing and travel - areas where
investors' perceptions can change quickly. Over the past few years, a person
could pick up the stock several times in the $15 range. That may occur again.

I'll consider the stock. It'd be a small position, and I'd want to ease in, on
the assumption I might be able to add at those lower prices once again.
(Another person might differ and say the stock's been in a narrow band - almost
always over $20 all year, and with good earnings forecast, might have a
breakout up move.)

Keith Jamison, (and/or others here) - what're your opinions on this one?

SFL stock is trading at a new high after the release of their earnings,
increase in their dividend by 25% and their announcement of a 2 million share
buy back program.

Ship Finance International Limited - Mandatory notification of trade (Tuesday

It appears that they are only 1/3 done from their approved share buy back
program of 2 million shares. They tend to buy at most 75K shares a day so as
not to impact the stock price too much.

SFL receives 20% profit sharing from their parent FRO. I imagine some of the
profit-sharing funds are being used for their share buy back program' since the
financing agreements (by my recollection) prohibit a special dividend. This is
a great way to add shareholder value.

MrCJ, I definitely learned a lot from this thread too - this thread is becoming

tremendous value to me.

I went through the Piotroski and other academic reports on value investing -
the 20 years study of low price-to-book group outperformed the general market
by several percentage points annually. It is fascinating and coincide with my
personal experience, especially the part that 56% of that group failed to beat
the market, but the other 44% was able to drag the performance up due to a few
3,4,5 baggers. I am practicing this approach patiently now, holding about 10

Steel shortage in Japan; CLF and other steel plays benefitting today.
Cleveland-Cliffs mines low-grade iron ore and process it into high-grade iron
ore pellets. These pellets are then shipped to integrated steel making plants
where they are mixed with coke and limestone and fired in a blast furnace to
make molten iron, the first step in the steel making process.

While this shortage may be a problem specific to Nissan and its overly tight
supply chain, the steel market is tight everywhere, reflecting in large part
the huge demand in China for steel and raw materials used to make steel.

Value Line recently ranked general steel the number one ranked industry. CLF
was listed on their "timely stocks in timely industries" list.

Japan's steel crisis forces Nissan to cut car production
From Leo Lewis in Tokyo

JAPAN’S two biggest steelmakers admitted for the first time yesterday that they
were unable to satisfy demand, forcing Nissan, the carmaker, to cut its
fourth-quarter production target by 30,000 vehicles.

Nippon Steel and JFE, already producing at maximum output, have failed to keep
up with Japan’s export boom and the global shortage of materials. Although both
companies are on course for record profits this year, they have been forced to
concede that they have run out of capacity. The steel drought coincides with
record high prices for three other critical commodities: oil, coal and iron
ore.

The sudden supply crisis has forced Nissan to close three of its main factories
in Japan for five days over the coming fortnight. The carmaker is also
understood to be planning a production cut of 30,000 vehicles in the last
quarter of fiscal 2004. 

Earthquakes and other natural disasters have occasionally halted Japanese car
production in the past, but the big manufacturers have, until now, always
weathered materials supply shortages.

The plant closures are seen as a spectacular setback for Carlos Ghosn, the
president of Nissan, whose high-profile resurrection of the company was based
on a realignment of its relationship with suppliers. The plant closures alone
are expected to delay production of 25,000 new vehicles whose popularity is
pushing Nissan’s growth.

Economists are concerned that the steel shortage could produce yet another
obstacle to Japan’s faltering recovery. Tightening steel supplies have already
begun to affect industries outside the auto sector: electronics companies
particularly have been unable to respond to rising export demand because they
have no scope to increase output.

The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) estimates that in the final
quarter of this calendar year, total steel demand will outstrip planned
production by several hundred thousand tons. 

Steel analysts at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, believe that the supply
crisis will remain severe well into next year, particularly in the high grades
of steel for which the Japanese manufacturers are famous. Even efforts by the
automakers to source high-grade steel plates from suppliers near their
factories around the world will depend on those suppliers having quantities of
high-grade slabs and coils that can be made only in Japan.

Several factors lie behind the steel shortage, of which booming vehicle exports
are a major contributor. Toyota, Honda and Nissan have enjoyed a long period of
high growth as they push into Asia and continue to make big inroads into
American and European markets. China’s surging economy, preparations for the
Beijing Olympics and Shanghai Expo have had a profound effect on demand for
construction-grade steel. China has also driven a trade-related boom in
shipbuilding, for which Japanese steelmakers are also key suppliers.

But it is China’s rapid growth that has particularly increased the scale of the
materials supply problem. Coal and iron ore prices have soared in response to
China’s voracious appetite.

JFE yesterday unveiled plans to boost its annual capacity of crude steel by 10
per cent next year from its present level of 27 million tons. Efforts will
centre on the group’s plant in Hiroshima, where both the casting and cooling
process will be speeded up to increase daily output.

Nippon Steel is trying to boost output of raw steel by two million tons a year,
but work to re-tool its mills will probably not be completed until next summer.

regarding INFO: Steve168. Interesting question as to whether there might be
more undervalued stocks than INFO that I am seeing. I'll say yes, there are,
when one considers the risk factor with INFO.

INFO's pretty undervalued selling below its cash (with no long-term debt). But
with INFO's burning through cash, and prospects that don't appear to me to be
so stellar, I'd have to say INFO's a high risk situation. As are many
below-cash plays where one does not intimately know the business and/or
management. Which is why I like to buy a package of below- cash stocks

Paul, I agree there is definitely risk with INFO, and that's probably with any
stock trading below cash with no debt. Otherwise there is no reason for it to
trade at such low price.

Many research reports documented the high book-to-market (low price/book) group
outperformed the market in the last 30 years. Some think it is because of the
higher risk, some think otherwise. If the statistics proved that group worked
in 30 years, and I am buying a basket, I don't think I am taking higher risk.

Regarding my market model and went short early in the year. I could not find
any deeply undervalued stocks before August 2004, so I "promoted" my secondary
market timing indicators to my primary for-profit tool. I had some successes
and failures, eventually did not want the monthly volatility, also I was able
to find deeply undervalued stocks again recently, so I became a buyer in the
last 1-2 months, covered short positions at a loss. INFO is one of my largest
holding now, bought as low as $1.36 since late Oct. mostly below $1.6. I think
I have a very reasonable chance to sell INFO for a 50% profit in a year.

I am a value investor and I am back to "below net liquidation value" investing
again big time. I am a little surprised to see so many stocks entered into my
buying range in the last two months while the general market made new highs
since 2003.

I did make many mistakes in the market, mostly during the period when I could
not find any "below-cash, no debt, reasonable potential" stocks, that I
wondered into other strategies such as "relative value", "growth at reasonable
price(EONC)" or "market timing". As far as I can remember, the "below cash, no
debt, reasonable potential" stocks I purchased all worked out well. I did lose
money in other methodologies, including market timing, such as shorting QQQ in
Sep and Oct.

In an Internet message board, people read stock ideas with suspicious eyes.
That's the way it should be. Nobody is paying for any service/idea, so everyone
research and make decision based on strategy, risk tolerance, style, etc. Paul
Senior sold INFO and I bought INFO, it lost major customers like AWE, revenue
had gone down dramatically. Some people don't think it can survive, I am
willing to take the risk based on:

1. Price/Cash is 1.64/2.2, zero debt. Book value 4.5 (yahoo finance), those
P/C, P/B numbers are among the lowest in all US stocks based on my screen tool.

2. Management and 5% owners own 26.75% of the company, that is pretty high, and
I think the management ought to do something before they lose all their own
money.

3. The company already started layoff, cut costs in most areas of operations.

I think there is a reasonable chance to survive or at least prolong the life
2-3 years. Within that 2-3 years, the stock price will likely fluctuate, and a
50% increase from current $1.64 is very likely, so I put my money where my
mouth is. Do I know for sure? absolutely not. INFO may file bankruptcy if they
continue to burn cash at current rate.

Decided to close Barnes&Noble position. Stock is reasonably priced imo and has
a reasonable p/e (13+) According to Yahoo, total debt is .18 of equity, and
there's quite a bit of cash in the till. (I don't know if lease obligations are
in the balance sheet or not.) Stores are in all the upscale areas I'm familiar
with, and they always have customers, it appears to me. Mr. Riggio, the founder
and successful entrepreneur, seems to be one sharp cookie.

It's just that the book business historically has been so low margin and tough
that if I own the stock at current level, I don't want it to be "reasonably
priced". I want it to be unreasonably priced, i.e. cheap.

Jmo, I could be very wrong if Mr. Riggio comes up with further innovative ways
to enhance the business and so push the p/e multiple up from 13-14.

Fwiw, I've now started a very small position in Toyota (TM). Given that I like
to hold shares for a while, TM seems to me to have among the best prospects
going forward of the automakers that I've been looking at. With its current p/e
of 10.75 and a forward predicted under 10 (per Yahoo), that's not that much
more expensive than 7 and 7.4 for my holding of GM. And TM gains market share,
while GM continues to lose.

Betting on GM is betting that they'll continue to muddle through, the stock
will fluctuate and eventually move up, and that the 5% dividend is attractive
and won't be cut. It's a bet that things might stabilize or turn positive for
GM - at least as perceived by investors.

As regards these bets, it seems to me that going with GM now and NOT betting on
TM at current price (i.e ignoring it as an investment) is like betting that
Toyota will screw up or somehow begin to lose market share, while expecting
that GM can staunch or reverse its multi-year market share losses.

Doesn't seem sensible to me. That would be two big changes. Sure trends can be
reversed (NSANY a great example), but for somebody who intends to hold a
position at least 18-36 months one ought to go with the trends one sees in
front of one's face, especially as there seems to be no evidence that the

To the extent that GM sells outside US, they should benefit by the

Steve168, man, you ask for a lot of info. that's really tough to respond to in
a brief response. (Well, tough for me to respond to.) I assume your post is
directed at the thread, since there are some pretty decent value players -
posters and lurkers - who do know Graham methods and (or) who invest
successfully using book value as a key component - if not basic component - of
their investing style. These guys can give better responses than I can, plus
they're likely consistently better investors than I am.

I do use book value where ever I can. Of course, we really can't use b.v.
analyses with some businesses, e.g. software firms, consulting firms, and some
would say tech firms (But you and I both will buy tech stocks when price is
below book and below cash (with no debt). And it has worked (sometimes?
mostly?) in those rare instances when stocks are available like that.

The basic idea in book value analyses - as I see it - is that we want to shrink
the population of stock choices in the "low price/book value" category (vs.
"high price/book value" category which we ignore). Here one picks one's
choices. Some might be:

low price to book value and low p/sales (thus eliminating high p/sales stocks,
low p/bv from consideration)

low p/bv and low p/e. And maybe reduce this subset further perhaps with:

low p/bv and low p/e and low p/sales.

There are a number of other "proven" ways to cut back the number of stocks in
the "low p/e" category in order to maximize potential gains. Too late at night
now for me to dig out my stuff (Dreman books), but Tweedy-Browne has published
something called "What Works on Wall Street". (refer to their website) They
like the cut (I'm doing this from memory & could be wrong) low p/bv and high
insider buys.

Pietroski uses low p/bv (well, as you say these academics call it book to
market)and some financial numbers (and/or relative strength?)

Of all these methods of investing, the best (highest performing) that I see
current performance on, Pietroski's is the BEST PERFORMER, BY FAR so far in
2004. (I'll dig out the ref. I have.)

I have been using p/bk as a bedrock for many decades. However, I can not report
that I am so successful that I am fabuously rich. It could be that it's wrong
to base so much on the historical or even tangible "book value" statistic, but
more likely it's my issue only. Because I dance all over the place (tech,
GARRP, high relative dividend, Buffett, etc. etc,) or I have other personality
faults - patience too short or patience too long with selections. Or else I
switch too frequently the additional cuts I make to "low p/bv", i.e. sometimes
high insider buys, sometimes high roe, sometime high profit margins, etc. etc.
Or maybe I'm not making the right or best cuts (Pietroski for 2004).

Steve,

About 10 or so years ago, a piece of academic literature came out that
basically said that Beta is dead since the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
did not reliably anticipate future stock returns.

In this research by Fama & French, they found that the two best "indicators"
for stock returns are: Book to Market and Small vs. Big. In other words, look
for small capitalization stocks that are priced at or below their book value.

The real question is, since the "market" should know this by now, has this
"quirk" been arbitraged away?

Great. I also like Hyundai. The best way I have found to buy it is through KEF,
a closed end fund that sells at about a 7% discount to NAV. Samsung, Hyundai
and POSCO are the three largest positions.

In re:"OVTI - Bailed today with 70% gain. Herb Greenberg had a piece out
expressing concerns about quality of earnings. Increasing competition, a
difficult product transition and aggressive reporting tip the risk reward
balance for me."

From the OVTI thread:
(Many thanks to Elroy)

Herb Greenberg article

Questioning OmniVision's earnings

http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B4A82B8D1%2DC0B6%2D4F72%2DA4B9
2DACDC3AF6DF96%7D&am.. .

So I emailed the following to Herb. Wonder if he'll respond?

--------------------

In your recent article on OVTI, you ask "why are investors bidding up this
stock"?

How about the following:

1- If you subtract the net cash per share of $4.48 from the stock price, and
you use the next four quarters consensus EPS of $1.15, you get a forward PE of
13x. A similar calculation for the S&P 500 semiconductor stocks gives forward
PEs between 18x (MU) and 33x (BRCM), with most of them in the 25x to 30x range.
In other words, OVTI's PE is about half of its
larger peer group. The stock could appreciate by 100% and then its PE would
just be "in line" with its S&P500 peers.

2- Although the charges in the October 2004 were one time in nature, they
represent reversals of earlier charges which depressed margins. So although the
October results were artificially high, it implies that earlier quarterly
results (I don't think they said when the earlier charges
were incurreed) were artificially low. Net net, at some point they deserve
credit for the actual results, and they are just realizing that credit in
October. That's a good thing (basically, they won the lawsuit), not a bad
thing.

3- You say "with prices falling and competition likely on the rise, the outlook
for margins wouldn't appear to be bright". Well look at the last two quarters
(July and October) where OVTI has experienced declining ASPs, declining overall
revenues and competition (semis ALWAYS have competition),
and gross margins have stayed FLAT at ~40.2%. That's fantastic considering they
were going through a product transition! The current outlook (which is just an
outlook, but what the hey?) is for RISING revenues, INCREASED
contribution from 1.3 higher ASP megapixel camera phone image sensors,
INCREASED contribution from the much higher ASP 5 megapixel digital camera
sensor, and higher volumes of the newer products (likely yeilds improve as
their manufacturing gets some history). This sounds like a recipe for
increasing gross margins and increasing ASPs. Since the company was able
to hold gross margins flat in the face declining revenues and declining ASPs,
an increase in corporate gross margins seems a reasonable conclusion.

4- And then you ask again - "Which gets back to the question: Why in the world
are investors bidding up this stock?" Well just look at a one year chart, and
you will see that OVTI was ~$33 in December 2003 when it had just delivered $78
million in October 2003 revenues and 23 cents in October 2003 EPS. Now its 2004
and they have delivered $84 million in October 2004 revenues and 28 cents in
October 2004 EPS, and the shares are 40% lower than their year ago level.
Doesn't sounds to me like investors are "bidding up" the stock.

PE = 13x
ASPs and gross margins probably going up
Industry area = semis for camera phones
Operating margins around 24%

What else in the world could one want in a tech stock?

Good overview on book value analysis. I further filter the screen down by two
other components that impact the "true" book value. Specifically, I look at (1)
the company's goodwill accounting and (2) other undervalued tangible assets
(like real estate, under utilized plant and facilities and company owned
natural resources). The reported book value can be overstated by aggressive
goodwill accounting and any recent acquisitions by the subject company should
be scrutinized as they probably allocated a significant amount of their
purchase dollars to goodwill which in many cases is a worthless asset
(especially in the high tech area). Reported book value can be significantly
understated if many of the underlining assets, which are booked at cost, have
appreciated over time. These types of assets may include land (real estate not
including buildings), natural resources (i.e. trees, oil & natural gas,
precious metals) and other undervalued fixed assets not adjusted to current
market prices.

Finally, I analyze book value along with both cash flow and free flow cash
flow. If a company has significant plant and manufacturing facilities which are
under utilized and current free flow cash flows cover the direct operating
expenses (including depreciation), there is an opportunity for the current or
new management team to create more value from these assets. Any increase in
plant utilization or investments in new technologies to make these facilities
more efficient will increase cash flow(s)and eventually result in better
earnings.

If the cash flows are negative and the company has a high amount of leveraged
debt, I will usually look someplace else. Unless the stock is significantly
under valued and I know management is actively reducing their debt obligations,
I might take a small position and watch to see if a turnaround occurs
(specifically if the free flow cash flows begin to turn positive). The other
underlining assets must be quite undervalued for me to even look at such a
purchase. One example recently was my purchase of El Paso (EP) that I picked up
in March 2003. This is still work in progress, however, management has
continued to cut debt by selling some of their underlining assets. What is
eventually left, should result in a smaller and more profitable company that
still has significant undervalued assets. My initial price target is $15.

Dave pointed out to look for small capitalization stocks that are priced at or
below their book value. This is true in my observations (especially if you
adjust the book value according to some of the criteria I listed above). It is
easier for a small company to have their non performing assets valued at market
rates by hiring a new management team to "fix" the problem or package the
company so it can be sold. Most often you get a larger company buying the
smaller company just as a pure "value" asset play.

There is no one best or absolute method of analysis but if you follow a lot of
the basics mentioned in this thread you will limit your downside risk.

In my opinion, the stocks with the most potential are microcap stocks which are
"mispriced". In my opinion, all stocks trade above or below "fair value" most
of the time. Their tiny size and volatility leads to much greater "mispricing"
opportunities in microcap stocks. I think it takes exhaustive analysis to
identify such opportunities and, in my experience, I would not say that book
value is a material factor.

What is "mispriced"? For me, I determine where I think a company can be in a
few years, what that performance would be worth then, the likelihood of it
happening, and how does that compare with the current price. If the potential
gain is exceptionally large, that is mispriced.

I agree with your premise. My favorite stocks for years have been micro or
small cap stocks, where they are unknown and/or just beginning to show solid
growth in their earnings, and thus offer tremendous potential once their story
is "discovered." Do you have any ideas which fit these criteria at the current
time? I haven't found too many of late, and most that I have are bulletin board
stocks, which a lot of people have no interest in (to me a bulletin board
company which is fully reporting is just as valid an investment as a listed
company, but I know many people don't feel that way). In this vein, I would be
interested in some of your favorite stocks if you would be willing to share
them.

Though it isn't wildly undervalued or "mispriced," one of my favorites is UHCO,
which has already made a nice move in the past year, but which still seems well
undervalued trading at 11 times next year's earnings, with a 20% growth rate
and nearly 20% ROE. They also have over 4 dollars in tangible book value, and
book value has grown at over 15% a year for the past five years.

As you noted, I look at this company and figure in a few years they could be
earning 2 bucks a share, with 10 dollars or more in book value, and if they
gain a following and achieve a P/E more in line with their growth, the stock
could be 40 to 50 bucks.

Steve and all,
first of all I assume that with book value, you mean tangible book value. For
me, at least the tangible book value is the metric I am looking for, as and
high tangible book value indeed may be an indicate of value. i personally don't
rat it too high, at least not before looking at the underlying asset that
constitute this book value. Often enough a high book value (relative to
valuation) is just an indication of overvalued assets. One example may be
network assets of telecom service companies that is written down in special
writeoffs, destroying the book value. Book value is really an accounting
concept, as are earnings. Only cash, and cash flows are "real" and absolute
(sometimes accountants even manage to screw up that).

So in short, book value is just one metric i am looking at, and not my favorite
at that. Other are cash/share, free cash flow, growth rates, LT business
prospects, management quality, price /sales to name a few. "Value" has many
forms and is in the eye of the beholder, so a value investor that only looks at
high relative tangible book values forgoes many chance to pick up stocks below
"fair value".

re Trucking companies. Most of those stocks have done well and some (including

rest of the market looks likewise - it just seems like a good time to reduce
positions rather than increasing them. That being said, the truckers have done
well despite high fuel prices, maybe they will do even better now that fuel

OVTI: straight life, thanks for copying that post here. I don't consider Herb's
opinions gospel, but his points on the 'good Q' being attributable to
non-recurring items that didn't justify the jump rang true. As to banking on
retrospective financials when new supply enters a cyclical market, my risk
aversion is somewhat driven by AUO where I'm way underwater due to similar
circumstances. If I were highly attuned to the camera chip market, I'd be more
likely depend on my ability to see around the corners...but that's not the case
so my margin of safety must include my margin of ignorance.

Here's Herbs follow-up today on OVTI - following a brief diatribe on bubble
mentality:

Meanwhile, back on OmniVision: Quite of bit of reader response to last week's
item here on the maker of camera chips, which are better known as image
sensors. It was enough to get the Hostile React-o-Meter spinning, but by no
means out of control. Many of the responses were along the lines that one
reason investors have been bidding up OmniVision's stock is because it's cheap
on a cash flow basis. (Since when are chip companies valued their cash flow?
Ah, that's right, as I mentioned earlier, you use whatever metrics work.
Besides, as we all know, cash flow isn't always what it appears.)

Others pointed to the company's cash generation last quarter, which on the
surface looks impressive. But cash generation can always look good if you defer
payments to suppliers or engage in other maneuverings. Notice that "other"
current liabilities rose by $16 million. (You have to wonder what the "other"
means.)

Meanwhile, there were readers who said I should be careful about questioning
OmniVision, because it's the leader in its industry. Well, I realize that, but
in tech, especially chips, today's leader is likely to be tomorrow's laggard.

Success in technology breeds competition, which for OmniVision is coming from
the likes of Micron Technology (MU). Micron made that clear at a recent
investment conference. "The major players in that market today is OmniVision,
who is, I think, generally considered to be the No. 1 player in the mobile
space," Micron investor relations chief Kip Bedard said. "We have moved into
what we think is probably No. 2, and we're probably about a 25 percent market
share player there. There's about 32 different CMOS image sensor companies. The
ones that tend to get mentioned next are ST Micro (STM) and Agilent (A). The
ones that I think are coming on the horizon you have to keep your eye on would
be Toshiba (TOSBF), Samsung (SSNGY), and probably even Sony (SNE) here at some
point. So I think the landscape probably changes pretty dramatically over the
next couple of years."

If not sooner.

This Greenberg article is even more baseless than the first one. I will pick
apart his new arguments one by one.

Greenberg Point#1

"Many of the responses were along the lines that one reason investors have been
bidding up Omnivision's stock is because it's cheap on a cash flow basis.
(Since when are chip companies valued their cash flow? Ah, that's right, as I
mentioned earlier you use whatever metrics work. Besides, as we all know, cash
flow isn't always what it appears.)

My response follows. I am a CPA with nearly 20 years of experience.

Omnivision is fabless with very little in the way of capex requirements.
Valuing OVTI based on cashflow is a valid approach because they have no need to
pour their cash into fixed asset upgrades. TSM bears the brunt of this risk on
Omnivision's behalf. Herb, did you ever hear of a little company names
Qualcomm? They are also fabless. That is my response to bullshit argument #1.

Greenberg Point#2

"Others point to the company's cash generation last quarter, which on the
surface looks impressive. But cash generation can always look good if you defer
payments to suppliers or engage in other maneuverings. Notice that "other"
current liabilities rose by $ 16 million. (You have to wonder what the "other"
means.)

My response to Greenberg's point# 2:

Greenberg's use of "on the surface" in this point is extremely misleading.
There is nothing on the surface about the impressiveness of OVTI in generating
cash last quarter. Here is the evidence:

Cash and short - term investments rose by $ 66,117,000 from July 31, 2004 to
October 31, 2004. Herb, I am sorry but there is nothing on the surface about
that. During this same time frame accounts receivable rose by only $ 2,146,000
which indicates to me that the accounts receivable are of very high quality
with NO BAD DEBTS OF ANY MATERIAL LEVEL hidden below. In addition, inventories
actually fell by $ 14,003,000 from July 31, 2004 to October 31, 2004. Bottom
line, the company did a fabulous job maneuvering through this product
transition. Also if they are able to defer payments to suppliers more power to
them. What do you think Walmart does? I also have a pretty good idea about what
the $ 16 million is that Herb is getting such a hard-on over. It is probably
accrued bonuses to employees who did one hell of a job in this transition
quarter.

Greenberg point#3:

"Success in technology breeds competition, which for Omnivision is coming from
the likes of Micron Technology."

My response:

Boy Herb, you really do not do a very good job of due diligence. Competition is
a fact of life for all of us. But for you to pick Micron as the greatest source
of competition for OVTI demonstrates how incredibly weak your case is. Micron
is embroiled in controversy right now. There is a DOJ investigation into price
- fixing for DRAM and Micron also has a large pending legal problem with Rambus
that remains to be settled. Throw in the fact that Intel dumped nearly all of
its holdings in Micron in the quarter ended September 30, 2004 there is no
support for saying that Micron is strong competition for OVTI. MU's stock price
is within $ 1 of its 52 week low. Herb, if everything was so rosy for Micron
would this be the case?

Herb, I would like to engage you in an open debate on your critique of
Omnivision. Name the time and the place and I will be there. My only
requirement is that the transcription
of our debate will be published in your column the following day. I know you
won't take me up on that challenge.

Okay, I'll consider KEF. I'm balancing that one vs. EWY vs. trying to buy
individual stocks (which is hard to do for some of these Korean companies.)

I like Hyundai, Posco, Samsung.

Posco will (I am assuming here) benefit from steel orders from Nissan, other
Japanese auto companies. P/e forward is about 6 (per Yahoo), stock already
-like most, if not all, steel companies- is near highs, so maybe it's already
too late. Posco at least trades on a US exchange (as PKX).

I am reading correctly today that Samsung will invest 24 BILLION Dollars (25
trillion won) in the production of semiconductors over the next six years???
Jeez. That is a bet.
I guess to play in the sector, you got to be big, powerful, and gutsy. Which
Samsung seems to be.

Maybe I had better look again at equipment suppliers. $24B is a lot of orders
to be let.

Comparing KEF and EWY, KEF has that 2.5% charge vs. EWY, the iShares South

Ideally, in pure capitalistic world, the increased supply will lead to lower
prices at retail, which will spur demand to soak up the glut. (Do you know
anyone who DOESN"T want an LCD monitor or TV?)
I am looking to get out of AUO soon, because I think the supply/demand picture
is negative for them in the near term.
I think GNSS (supplier of chips for LCD) and GLW - Corning, manufacturer of the

Bob, related to OVTI, I have been an investor in technology for decades. In my
opinion, it is a very fashionable and generally lousy sector to invest in. The
name of the game is "durable competitive advantage (DCA)" - sustainable product
position, market position and gross margins. Very few companies have it and
even fewer investors have the expertise to identify which do.

If you don't have DCA, then buying such a company is like buying an oil well
without a clue as to how long the oil will flow or at what price you can sell
it. I know I do not have the expertise, and generally avoid one product line
companies. If one wants an investment in technology, waiting to buy something
like LLTC at a good price makes more sense to me than an OVTI.

Madharry. Ah, some stocks from the old days. Sorry I didn't add more to ELN
when it was lower. Still holding all my mining stocks too - RIO, PD, SWC, OMG.
I don't see a good reason to sell. (But of course, at my age, I don't see that
well. -gg-)

Added to GTI on Friday. If steel shortages persist, or if steel production
keeps at high levels, GTI ought to do okay. (They supply lots of graphite, a
necessity for mini-mills.) Or if steel is in shortage (per Nissan), then maybe
steel substitute might do okay. So I added to small position in aluminum
producer AA on Fri. too. Also, late to the party that I am, I nevertheless
entered with a small position in steel stock MUSA.

I was in AUO months ago - TA got me out with a profit for which I am grateful.
I was planning on jumping back in but it never showed any power in moves up.

IMOS is also a chip provider to this sector. I don't own it currently.

TFS is "undervalued" to me. It has $0.65 cash and $3.49 book value, and trading
at $2.

Recently it was removed from SP SmallCap 600 index, 6M shares traded on that
day and the stock held up OK, it is trending up from the look at the chart.

The company is focusing on handheld TFT displays. It had some tough time lately
as seen in the share price.

I had been buying and intend to buy more on dips.

Portfolio update -
sold AMGN and MLNM. Both have done well, so I decided to raise some more cash.
I don't find much value out there, so it seems prudent to me to increase cash.

Continuing to add to my oil tanker stock holdings. Bought a bit more FRO today.

Just betting the good news can continue and not all is already priced into the
stock.

(Ashamed to acknowledge I'm still not very clear on the dividend amounts (i.e.
FRO's dividend policy) going forward.)

Steve, TFS has been discussed on this thread before, as an below net cash play.
That was at higher levels. It appears that they are are burning through cash
very quickly. TFS strategic position is dire, IMO.I cannot see how a small
display company like TFS can survive.

From:- with a K
CLF restarts line idle since 1999. Snips from the Duluth News Tribune:

United Taconite fires up line

Production from the kiln, which has been idle since 1999, will be a boon for
the region.

Taconite pellets began rolling off a mothballed line at United Taconite on
Sunday afternoon for the first time in five years...

Refurbished at a cost of $23 million, the line will expand United Taconite's
capacity by about 1 million tons per year. Taconite pellets produced at Iron
Range mines are the primary ingredient used to make steel.

The restart is a byproduct of a boom in the domestic steel and taconite
industries, fueled by global demand and a restructuring by North American steel
producers.

Cleveland-Cliffs owns 70 percent and Laiwu Steel 30 percent of United Taconite.

With the expansion, United Taconite will be capable of producing 5.3 million
tons of taconite pellets annually. If the taconite plant produces 5.3 million
tons in 2005, it would be the facility's highest year of output since 1981,
when it produced 5.8 million tons as Eveleth Mines.

"The restart of Line 1 is a major event and a testament to the strength of the
market," said Dana Byrne, a Cleveland-Cliffs spokesman. "It's (United Taconite)
a strategic asset of Cliffs, and I think this restart is an indication of
that."

In 2003, Cleveland-Cliffs and Laiwu bought the bankrupt taconite plant for $3
million and $40 million in long-term environmental liabilities.

Cleveland-Cliffs has talked about an additional expansion, to produce 700,000
tons of taconite, in 2006. But a decision to move ahead has not yet been made.
That expansion would bump the taconite plant's annual capacity to 6 million
tons.

Sold CL on the spike today at 50.05 - Probably will go higher, but I felt it
was prudent to sell into strength.

I know that oil tanker stocks pay good dividends.. Would you be so kind as to
list a few here that you like.

Thank you.
