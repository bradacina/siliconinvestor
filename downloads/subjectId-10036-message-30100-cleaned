Family control not a reason for avoiding purchase of Pargesa, imo.

1. There are actually two different families that jointly control Pargesa.
They'd have to act in concert - their interests both to be aligned against the
small shareholders. Which could happen of course.

2. How active can the families be in Pargesa? Most of the underlying companies
are the huge businesses in which Pargesa has minor stakes. They could sell
positions, but I doubt they could exploit companies like Total for their own
personal benefit.

3. Really, how much do we know about the managements of companies we buy as
value investments about how aligned management is with shareholders? Options
issues, stacked boards of directors, overly generous perks and salaries.
Rampant stuff.

4. This shouldn't be somebody's only investment or maybe even major investment.
Diversity reduces the portfolio risk of holding Pargesa.

OK, so here are couple more reasons to avoid it:

- Complicated structure both in terms of control and in terms of reporting. Add
Euro accounting to this = nightmare.

- Conglomerates suck by definition. BRKA excluded. ;)

- It owns a bunch of public companies that investors can buy themselves
avoiding the ones that are not attractive.

- It is like BRKA, except that I can trust Buffett, but I don't know if I
should trust the Eurobarons.

- Buying the XXXXF and XXXXY shares is a pain. In most cases. Very limited
quotes, weirdo executions or no executions, investment limits, weirdo
commissions. May or may not be a problem with Pargesa - it seems to vary per
company/shares. So I'm a small investor using Fidelity... but from Dale's
thread it seems there is no very good solution unless you are big and rich and
trade overseas.

- CNP by the way is possibly more interesting since it has a number of fully
controlled companies. Same problems though, plus I am not sure they have shares
listed in USA at all.

On the other hand, both of them are possibly cheap (cheaper than BRKA, but
maybe not if you count Buffett's float ;)). :)

It also comes back to the question we talked about regarding mutual fund
investing: if you are investing yourself, what is the point to invest in
someone else's investment vehicle. BDCs may be understandable, since you can't
invest in senior bonds or private equity. Companies holding a portfolio of
other public companies just look like a mutual fund.

Of course me buying TAVIX which buys CNP is the height of hypocrisy.

I think i prefer CNP over Pargesa. The discount to NAV is probably a little
less than Pargesa, but i think CNP has outperformed Pargesa in the past.

The structure is indeed a little byzantine, but the management has a long track
record so I have not reason not to trust them. The other advantage is that
management is very cheap, cost are only about 0.2% for both CNP and Pargesa.
this beats almost any mutual fund and for sure private equity manager. i see no
reason not to venture into the cotails, especially since i get a fairly
substantial discount to boot with.

buying the shares in Switzerland or Belgium is not a big deal if you have an
Interactive broker account. i did a test drive in my simulation account and it
works straightforward (as did my real live buys in my Roth IRA). Now I am
waiting for a speed bump to get in.

LIZ. You might be right to be avoiding it. I have shares, and I'm concerned.
Not that the stock is down. Historically the stock is trading at near a
ten-year low on some measures, so as styles change, and with LIZ's diversity, I
look for a reversion-to-mean, normally.

I just wonder if there's a shift going on among preteens/teenagers from clothes
to communication.

My 12-year old niece is crying for an unlimited text-message service. Once her
friends have it, she rightly feels she's excluded from her social group. She
gets partial texting; it gets used up quickly though, and after that it's
something like 10c a word (is that about right?) whether incoming or outgoing.
She tells her friends to stop texting her, (her father complains to her about
the add-up of those 10c charges), but they don't apparently. Anyway, unlimited
texting for the family (Dad says what do mom and I need that for?) is about
$40/mo. which the kid says she needs (to make her happy or regain or have
status in her circle (a priority for most kids)). And then of course they all
have to have their iPods and incur the fees that go with that.

$40/mo --- that's a lot of money to a lot of people. I suspect kids would
rather have commo access now and just be satisfied with simple jeans and tops,
if it come down to allocating monies. Not good for teen retailers, if that's
so.

Eventually (and the big if is when IMHO) Cuba will open up, and Havana will

cruised the Caribbean routes, you know that new ports are greatly needed to
provide variety, and Havana would definitely fill that bill.

NETC - Normally I would not look at this company, since it does not have a

The picture is not very attractive. There is definitely high growth in sales.
The earnings (under US GAAP) have fallen down from 2006 though. Debt is
climbing as is goodwill, which I don't like, since goodwill is just crap by
another name. Net tangible assets are around zero. Margins are so so. US P/E is
about 33, which is high.

On the other hand, in US presumably these kind of companies are not valued
using earnings. But I never learned to value US operators, so I will skip on

I think caution and patience are called for when wading into the financial
quagmire, as I expect lots more announcements like these:

-- Standard Chartered said Wednesday it has dropped a plan to bail out its $7
billion Whistlejacket fund, which could now default on some of its debt as
early as Thursday.
The fund -- a structured investment vehicle that issues short-term debt backed
by investments in longer-term securities -- went into receivership earlier in
February after the value of its assets fell below a key trigger level.
Standard Chartered (UK:STAN: news, chart, profile) , a U.K.-listed bank that
focuses on emerging markets, had proposed a potential rescue to the receiver
Deloitte & Touche. But on Wednesday the bank said the continued deterioration
in the market for the fund's assets has left it unable to cobble together a
workable rescue.
"Standard Chartered is disappointed that it has been unable to find a viable
solution to ensure flexibility for Whistlejacket due to these changes in
circumstances," the bank said in a brief statement.
Chart of UK:STAN
Another complicating factor was a decision by the receivers not to pay the
holders of certain debt that matured at the end of last week.
A grace-period on those repayments is about to run out and means the fund could
officially default on the payments on Thursday, according to analysts at
Standard & Poor's.
Shares in Standard Chartered fell 2.4% in midday London trading, outstripping a
broader decline in the U.K. market. See London Markets.
Structured investment vehicles have been struggling to find buyers for their
debt, which must be renewed every couple of months, since the credit crisis
began to accelerate over the summer.
have moved their SIV's assets onto their balance sheets or promised to provide
funding if investors stopped buying their debt.
Standard Chartered initially made a similar promise to provide liquidity to the
fund. See archived story.
But that deal collapsed earlier February when the fund's assets fell further,
requiring that receivers be called in. Standard Chartered said at the time that
it didn't expect the appointment of receivers, or any future arrangements for
the fund, to have a material impact on its profit for 2008.

trying to remember the words of Baruch who said he became wealthy by buying too
late and selling too early.

Icahn Gets FTC Okay To Boost CSX Stake
February 20, 2008 8:56 AM EST
* Icahn Gets FTC Okay To Boost CSX Stake

According to a posting a ftc.gov, Carl Icahn and related funds was granted
early termination notice from the FTC, required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
antitrust law, on CSX Corp. (NYSE: CSX).

The FTC did not disclose the nature of the transaction, but approvals are given
on acquisition of stocks or assets greater than $50 million.

At 12/31, Icahn Capital held 2.9 million shares of CSX of 0.69%.

=============================================================

Looks like Icahn is upping his stake in CSX. According to your earlier posting
(10/24/07), the Grahm Fair Value was $68.04. CSX is near it's all time high as
it traded over $51 today. Icahn may feel there is still another 30% of value to
be had in the company and is building his stake accordingly.

From the report:"...Summary and Recommendation
Despite seeing a steep decline in stock price for buy-recommended
ConocoPhillips (COP), we believe the oil and gas company is financially strong,
well-managed and undervalued in the market. Discussing fourth quarter results
reported today that exceeded our projections, chief executive Jim Mulva
appeared calm and confident. Those results support our December 18 increase in
Net Present Value (NPV) to $124 a share from $112 a share prompted by an
increase in long-term oil price for calculating present value to $80 from $66 a
barrel. We also allowed for higher taxes to be imposed by the state of Alaska
and the province of Alberta. We judge current stock market turmoil to be a
financial problem, not a fundamental problem with the oil and gas industry or
ConocoPhillips. Likely government responses to debt-stressed capital markets
may keep oil price on its long-term uptrend. Meanwhile COP stock trades at the
lowest McDep Ratio of at least our last dozen analyses of the company..."

ARCC: The negative thing about ARCC is that it was founded in 2004, so we don't
know what its history or discipline is. It's smaller than ACAS, so perhaps it
is more nimble, but then ACAS would be able to exert more control and perhaps
attract more deals because of its size and reputation/history.

I agree somewhat with your previous criticism of ACAS. I am not sure it is a
great business, but might be OK business for current situation. I believe its
ROE can only be expected to be in 12% range, high 2006 ROE being an aberration.
On the other hand though, ARCC did not show very good results even in 2006. You
could argue that it did not pursue risky business then, so it is safer or
better but we don't really know.

I am still holding ACAS planning to sell at 1.3-1.5 book: $42-48, though I may
change my mind. I may diversify into AINV or ARCC, although so far all three

Without them, net tangible assets are about 300M vs. the company trading at

even in the heydays of construction. Had good ROE for maybe 2 years. So why
should we think that it's now worth more than maybe 1.1 x tangibles? Neither
plastics nor doors look like a business with a huge macro trend in the works.

Of course, on the positive side it is trading below net tangibles, it just
started barely to lose money (did not lose much - yet) and if the market was
more positive it may tread above book instead of below tangibles, so sure there
should be a lot of value investors buying. As they are.

We have now seen the first stage where there funny paper (CDO CDO^2, subprime)

ACAS -- I just got a letter from schwab where they want to borrow my ACAS
shares and pay me 2% annual interest rate on the market value of the shares. I
lend the shares and get the 2%. They get the dividends but schwab pays be an
equal amount in lieu of dividends. But since that is taxable at regular tax
rates, schwb pays an additional goodwill amount to cover the tax. But the

It appears that this is something that Schwab has been doing for a while. Here

"Charles Schwab, the largest discount broker, runs a service in which it offers
to pay customers interest on any loans of hard-to-borrow stocks from their
brokerage accounts. The rate varies, depending on how much demand there is to
borrow the stock."

ACAS. thanks for the link. I called schwab and got some more info. I was told
that it is a myth that a broker can loan your shares to a short seller without
your approval. That is -- unless you are on margin.

They sent it to me overnight UPS and wanted me to return it via similar prepaid
overnight delivery. I have x thousand shares and maybe that's why they singled
me out.

They also will gross up my payment by 30% to cover higher taxes for any portion
of ACAS dividends which are qualified. And my 2% is computed daily based on the
closing share price (paid monthly).

i.e if I get $100 dividend at 15% tax rate, I end up with $85. So they pay me
$130.77 and assume I am in 35% tax rate and net the same $85. fair enough.

I am signed up. It will start as early as next week. cool.

That does sound like a sweet deal and a great return. I guess someone thinks
ACAS is overpriced here. I have a few shares but haven't checked the short
interest lately.

Since your shares are on loan and not in your account, I guess that could
increase your chances of getting a margin call if the market takes a sudden and
steep dive.

Did they give you any time frame on how long your shares will be on Loan? Can
you recalled them at any time?

The shares will be moved into a new account that shows up in my list when I log
into the website. I am told that they clone my name, ss#, etc into the new
account. I can go into the account and sell at any time. All cash in this
account is automatically swept into my "real" account.

And curiously, I set up the schwab account when etrade's outlook was shaky. And
last week I moved all my schwab shares back to etrade, luckily -- except for
ACAS shares. And I have x thousand shares still at etrade. And schwab tells me
to move them to schwab for the same deal.

What kills me is that the short seller of acas has to pay 11.6% dividend plus
my 2% plus schwab fees. Schwab guy told me that schwab lends the shares to
lehman (or somebody) who in turn lends them to the hedge fund which is
shorting.

And I am not on margin, if I was they could loan my shares without paying me.

I remember hearing some of the stuff about the naked short selling and how they
avoid getting caught. If i recall this correctly all they need it is to show
that they have possession of the shares for some point during the day and they
are covered. I gathered from this that in actuality the same share could be
shorted several times if used by multiple short sellers. Perhaps schwab has
figured out the this can be a lucrative side line for them. if not i cant see
why they would go to all this trouble. i also wonder why they need to put this
in a separate account unless they want to avoid some type of audit that might
uncover this. I guess its my training as a credit officer.

Pargesa, NAT.BR (CNP)

I decided to take the plunge and purchased a position in Pargesa at a little
more than 106 CHF. I initially preferred CNP (NAT.BR) from the two, but then i
realized that CNP is calculating it's NAV based on Pargesa's book value rather
than the market price. this makes a difference of about 400M Euro in NAV (the
market value is lower than the book value in Pargesa's case).

I do not think it's "legitimate" for CNP to do so since their "look through"
ownership in Pargesa is only 24.2% and they share control with Power co.

Using market prices for CNP's Pargesa stake reduces CNP's NAV by 400M or about
8%. Well anyways, Pargesa's NAV is 160 CHF/share and the stock trades at 106
CHF, a 33.75% discount, so it's a pretty straightforward value, IMO.

My next idea is to study the other branch of Pargesa's parent companies -
PWF.TO . This seems to be an interesting holding company as well, but as of now
i have no idea if PWF.TO is a value or not, also i suspect it is.

If they stick with the same model they use here, I think they'll do very well.
Walmart and the big grocery stores can only do one size. Huge. Quik-Trip, 7-11,
and their ilk only do small, overpriced, and of dubious quality.

Tesco easily sizes themselves for the location. There's a small one a few doors
from the office and I usually get my lunch there. There's a considerably larger
but not huge one close to my flat and I can stock up on groceries there, though
it seems geared mostly toward those who might visit daily to buy that day's
food. Though they do carry a decent amount of produce, so I can stock up on
fruits and vegetables. In outlying areas there are ones rivaling the likes of
Price Chopper, etc.

And as far as I can tell, the quality and price of products are the same, no
matter what size the store, and that might be a huge advantage for them. More
people might go to the smaller ones since they won't be a last-resort shopping
place like Quik-Trip.

It's also interesting that, though I don't know if this is purposely a major
part of the way they roll, they seem to go as environmentally-friendly and PC
as they can where possible. For example, eggs are always from free-range hens.
Although they may also avoid the quantity of preservatives we use. Where we can
buy our milk with an expiration date weeks away, and it's usually still good a
few days past that, any milk I've bought here expired only a few days after
purchase and when they put an expiration date on it, they MEAN it. The day
after that date, it turns into a disgusting solid.

Do you know if they have ADR's? I think this company is not only going to fill
a huge set of niches, I think they're going to take decent-sized bites out of
the likes of Price Chopper and even Walmart.

Jurgis, GE's financial arm contributes about 1/3 of GE's operating earnings. A
good deal of GE's financial arm is tied to GE's industrial operations (leasing,
infrastructure finance). i think that part is fairly low risk. The consumer
finance part may be affected but i do not think that we will be seeing so sort
of large writeoffs we have been seeing with banks.

The favorable aspect for GE is that they still have their AAA rating (and i
think they will keep it). With most competitors ratings being downgraded that
is a significant advantage for GE's financial operations.

CRDN. At current price, maybe a GAARP stock. So much still dependent on
government contracts. Company has several non-government products though.

From BusinessWeek:

"In the near term, the company has more to gain by providing add-on armor for
the Army's enhanced Mine Resistant Ambush Protection, or MRAP II, program for
high-threat vehicles, says Al Kaschalk, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities
in Los Angeles."

A recent interest of mine has been defense against IEDs (USA military-speak for
improvised explosive device, or bomb). These things appear to be getting more
powerful and more sophisticated as happens during wars and the learning
experience of combatants.

Expecting this knowledge to be disseminated outside of current conflict (Iraq),
I suspect IED's will show up and blow up more prevalently in Western countries
than currently.

Mentioned previously, I have taken a few shares of
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FRPT . Stock has been beat down because the larger
defense contractors have won the big orders for mine resistant vehicles, FRPT's
sole business. I've also bought a few shares of Allen-Vanguard (ALNVF.PK). This
Canadian company develops electronic jamming products to counter terrorist
devices and provides ordinance disposal equipment ("bombproof" suits, robots,
etc.) and training. I like the company's diversity within its niche, and that
the company stock has come down.

Isn't SIL's mine in some Marxist country or something? If the mine makes money
it is the governments money (and I presume the mine will be very profitable as
Silver is going through the roof). If the company loses money the company can
pick up the tab. Hey I see they have a recent news release that addresses this
concern. Not quite as onerous as I had expected if the government doesn't
change the rules again next month. Still I think I'd pick one of the Mexico or
Canada producers if I wanted to add a silver stock (I own MMG, TRGD, and PZG).
Unless someone can show me some earnings projections on SIL that are
impressive?

NRF and GSS (gold stock which could earn 0.85 per share in 2009 if gold stays
greater than $850 and they meet their projected production rates) report
tomorrow, If I wasn't overloaded I'd consider picking up some shares of either
for the chance some good post earnings action.

Bought some RDN (first entry) and sold the May 10 calls for a quick 10% return
which should cover my losses for at least a few days. (S&P upgraded from sell

has anyone watched the ALLCO finance disaster from down under?
Allco finance was an "hard asset" manager similar to Macquarie, B&B, BAM and
others. The difference appears to be that their accounting was not good. the
results for stockholders are not pretty:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AFG.AX

It appears to me that those "hard asset managers are running a risky business.
Sure just running assets for others is not a high risk but the reality is not
that straightforward. In order to keep growing they constantly purchase new
"hard assets" on their own account, bundle them and then resell or IPO (and
keep a stub). If this money recycling food chain breaks down, they will sit on
those assets just like the banks sit on some of their leveraged buyout or CDO
loans. If something goes wrong with a spinoff, these assets may go back to the
owner just like SIV go back to the banks.

The whole game seems risky because those companies constantly run a lot of
leverage. this business is dependent on cheap money, because they earn their
money on the difference between the cash flow of the assets they hold and the
interest on the debt they pay. If the cost of capital goes up they will be
squeezed and that seems to be happening in Australia where interest rates are
not going down because the economy is booming. Well, those hard assets are
better than CDO^2 of course but i nevertheless suspect a vulnerability.

But yes, I have noticed it doesn't seem to be such a great bet. While there's
the cash cushion, the stock has traded below current p/sales and below current
p/bk before -- several times. Stock imo, could easily fall another 20-30% and
still not be near past lows by those measures.

I'll try to hold this one though for a while. Possibly because I've had decent

Not quite what you are looking for, but I've owned in the past, and am
currently looking at some floating rate closed ends again. FRA, FRB are the
ones I've owned before, and I believe FRA was the one Bill Gross pounded the
table on 1-2 years ago.
I also own a very small amount of VVR in an income oriented account.
There are a lot of these funds out there, they have very nice yields, and
generally trade at a discount to NAV. Prices typically well off the highs. And,
typically, the interest paid resets with the environment at the time, with some
lag.
If this might be something of interest, you can perform DD on

I've had Pimco's FRA and FRB upon Bill Gross's recommendations in Barron's.
Lost money on both.

Holding now a decent-size position in similar PFN. Losing money on this one as
well.

The penalty I guess for me for chasing yields/seeking safety/making wrong
decisions.

-----------
These closed-end funds invest in floating-rate debt instruments.
The funds are diversified in their debt holdings, and the debt resets quickly.
The idea is that a fund holder doesn't take on much default risk with the
underlying securities. When general rates rise, the interest on the cef's debt
holdings increase, and eventually the dividend paid to stockholders should too.
That's how it works as I understand it. (And of course when interest rates come
down, it goes the other way.)

Like many cef's, they use some leverage. That's bit them a bit with the recent
failed auction of their Auction-Rate Preferred Shares (not significantly or
substantially, Pimco(Alllianz Global) says).

Value Investing: I put some fun money into a famous company - Beate Uhse
(DE:USE). Stock heavily discounted trading at E1.30 to 1.35. The company might
be in a crisis but its stuff will always be useful for a whole lot of folks.
Currently a secondary with rights is placed which depresses the stock price
(the price for the secondary is 1.10). Once the placement is finished the
company is in much better shape. I think it could be worth more.
