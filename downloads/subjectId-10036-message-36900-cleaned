GAM qualifies as a CEF in my book:
http://www.cefconnect.com/Details/Summary.aspx?ticker=GAM

Handy because you can do sorts by discount and yield. But use only as a first
screen because high discounts may exist for a good reason, and high yields
often include a return of capital.

50% discount sounds good, but I think there is a catch:

Dr. Ipsofacto, I struggle as to what to conclude about CEG. On the numbers, I
see, it could work. Otoh, Spekulatius has often been very on the mark...his
comments not so easy for me to ignore.

I like the nuclear play too. I don't know if it will work out, but the
companies up for getting gov't assistance won't go bankrupt (I presume) if the
gov't doesn't follow through.

There are four companies (or more) that are involved - CEG, NRG, SCG, and SO. I
hold shares in three, but not CEG.
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25720832&srchtxt=ceg

So for me, I won't buy CEG. I feel I'm still covered with a play on nuclear
growth. Also my shares were purchased last year, so I don't feel I have to step
up for something like CEG which is now up to near 12-mo. high. Back on the
other hand, in past years this stock has achieved much higher levels, so maybe
management actions will enable the stock to move higher still.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=CEG&t=5y

--------------------------
I'll go further. I believe value investing is about going where you see the
value. If you determine CEG is a value buy for you, then so be it. You have to
know yourself too though. There is just something about a sharp, young guy
getting started with value investing and going into a utility stock and holding
it patiently until an idea of fair/full value is reached. (Why not though?) I
guess I don't fit that personality (or age or brains). If we're talking a
trade, or something short-term, not an investment, then I could see it easier.

If I were a student, maybe could scrape up say a few thousand to invest, I'd
look to where I could make use of my understanding of value investing, where
that would be an advantage, and where I could get good reward for the risk I
take. One idea might be to look also at some of these .50-$4.00 Chinese stocks
that are mentioned around SI (grispin here, for example). Once I started
looking, I found so many of these type stocks, it's almost overwhelming. I find
the analysis isn't so difficult (if we're talking p/bk, p/e, roe, debt/equity).
Finding the company and getting to the quarterly/annual reports is
time-consuming, and selecting buys from among the possibilities is a challenge.
I like packages, I'd go with a package of 5-8 such stocks. Of course, this is
sector investing, so is subject to risks in investing in China. It seems like
there is still the possibility of making 2,3 or more times one's investment
though if a carefully or luckily chosen stock is selected. One or two of those
in the package of 5-8 would really make a difference.

Anyway, I hold a bunch of dinky Chinese stocks and I'm going through a list of
more now to see if I find any that I might bet on...er...invest in.

So I remembered Dr. Ipsofacto, and that perhaps this sector might be something
that might appeal to you also.

Others here may have contrary or better ideas. Also, I want to be
opportunistic, so it's possible if circumstances change tomorrow, so will my
idea(s). And I've been wrong many, many times.

Re: GAM

Their expenses are a little higher than ADX. I checked GAM's 2009 annual
statement and they show the following for expenses:

Ratio of expenses to average net assets
applicable to Common Stock
1.93% 0.87% 1.11% 1.06% 1.25% [five years]

If one is looking at an alternative of an actively managed mutual fund, then
GAM looks pretty good, because that is about typical of actively managed mutual
funds, and there is the discount as an extra. For someone with a small stake,
GAM could be okay. Still I'd tend to prefer ADX because their expenses are
lower.

But I manage my own holdings for around .1%, and so see discounted CEF's from a
different angle.

I did notice GAM-B, a preferred, very safe, pays 6%, which might be of interest

Re:SENEA

My first brief review on Yahoo & Google.

Any concern with four insiders dumping very large holdings in June 2009 at
prices around $22.00/share? It looks like four insiders sold a total of 9.42
million shares at $22.00/share. Based on the recent 10Q and as reported on
Google Finance, the total number of shares for SENA is 10.66 million shares.
This represents 88% of all outstanding shares. Hmm... Why not just sell the
company to a private buyer?

Any explanation for these sales? One would assume that the fair value would be
around $22.00/share. At $28.40/share one could make the argument that the stock
is 30% overvalued (if you are one of the four insiders) unless there was some
other under the table deal made between these insiders and the buyer(s) of
their shares. Do any of these insiders have new employment contracts w/ golden
parachute provisions?

Something does not pass the smell test IMO.

SENEA: Carl Marks Management had been in for 11 years apparently. I don't know
why they wanted out, but they did. That is, per Yahoo, the big sellers were all
and only Carl Marks employees - Ruocco, Boas, & Wilson for sure, and I assume
Nancy Marks. Perhaps it's not so much that there's a valuation issue with
SENEA: It might be that Carl Marks Management now finds better opportunities
elsewhere. (They say they invest in distressed debt, for example,
(http://www.carlmarks.com/transactions.aspx) and there's a lot of that around
now.) Otoh, I don't know- maybe there was a valuation issue at $22. I know that
I'm not happy stepping up now at $27-28+, but because I believe I see the value
there at the price, I will chance it. The quarterly report issued 2/'10, months
after the insider sales were made (7/09) gives no indication to me of trouble
abrewing. Also, other directors and the insider controlling family have sold no
shares that I see.

From the 7/'09 proxy:
"On June 22, 1998 the Company entered into a Shareholders Agreement with the
parties listed therein. Under the Shareholders Agreement, certain affiliates of
Carl Marks Management Company, L.P. (“CMMC”) were granted the right to
designate two individuals to the Company’s Board of Directors and certain
substantial shareholders of the Company, including the Wolcott and Kayser
families, have agreed to vote their respective shares of capital stock of the
Company
to elect CMMC director designees. Currently, Messrs. Wilson and Boas are the
two CMMC director designees. On July 8, 2009, the Shareholders Agreement was
amended to provide that the Shareholders Agreement will terminate in the event
of the consummation of the previously announced secondary offering of Class A
Common Stock by certain shareholders of the
Company. In addition, the CMMC director designees have agreed to resign
immediately upon termination of the Shareholders Agreement..."

awaited Ragnarok 2
this took about 8 years, because of problems mentioned above and re-writes of
the game. The Nintendo DS version shipped about 2 weeks ago, online will come
out in the summer.
If the game captors it's fan base like the first one then value could be
released if it does not then they will have to got back to the drawing board,
so will the stock price!
They do have steady income from the 1st game and other games, but Ragnork 2 is

CADC: I'm partial to cement/aggregate companies, and CADC is one serving
Beijing. P/e 7; roe over 20%. D/e looks to be small.

Here's a positive article from a Seeking Alpha writer that was published
yesterday:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/192492-why-i-m-bullish-on-china-advanced-constr
ction-materials-group?source=yahoo

So, okay, it's partly (predominantly?) a play on the build-out of China's
high-speed railway. One operating assumption I've had is that because
aggregates are heavy and shipping costs are high, plant location tends to be a
moat that dissuades outside competitors from transporting into the area and
gaining business. However, this may not be so for CADC, I see now:

From the Mar 2 pr: "Mr. Xianfu Han, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
stated, "We are pleased with the steady flow of railway projects that we have
been awarded since we began focusing on the railway infrastructure construction
area. Our investments in portable plants and implementation of our ready-mix
concrete services have proven to be a successful strategy. Our railway
operations are structured so that as earlier projects wind down, we are in a
position to win additional contracts along the same high-speed rail lines. This
tactic allows us to achieve the desired utilization levels and high margins. We
remain committed to playing a significant role in the Chinese government's
mandate to add 41,000 kilometers of railway track by the year 2020 and we
believe that the strong demand for our services will help drive shareholder
value in the future."

IF these guys can build and use mobile plants successfully, not only should
they be able to move along a railroad's path, building the railroad itself, but
they might also win contracts if adjacent area has construction projects too.

Summary (jmo): Profits are there. Price looks right. Possibilities look good.

I am in for a position a/o this a.m.

CADC. To me, it's not their product that's innovative. It's that they have
mobile plants. I'm no expert here. I don't recall any USA ready-mix companies
that have these in use here though.

Gross margin for this quarter of course is $5.2M/$26M = 20%
Gross margin for the comparable quarter is $3.9/$10.8M = 36%
As reported: "Gross margin was 20.0% versus 36.5% in the same quarter last
year". So gross margin % fell.

Continuing to fog the mind, they felt they had to report another percentage:
That the gross profit did increase from $3.9M to $5.2 from the prior year
quarter, or "Gross profit increased 32.3% year-over-year to $5.2 million."

Okay, about "net earnings margin". Net profit margin this quarter was
$7.9M/$26M = 30% vs. $2.7M/$10.8M = 25%.

So we have this anomaly of net earnings margin this quarter of 30% exceeding
this year's gross margin of 20%. That's because apparently it's required that
$3.36M of "change in fair value of warrants" must be included now in moving
from gross to net. And this is also the place to include $1.3M of "other

I'm one who tries to use net profit margins as a value criteria, and so I'm not
going to be liking non-recurring items (I hope they are non-recurring) such as
"change in fair value of warrants". They may invalidate conclusions I get when
I compare a company's profit margin performance year by year. As seen here,
these items can distort how how much <u>sales dollars</u> actually drop to the
bottom line.

re CADC.
To me, it's not their product that's innovative. It's that they have mobile
plants. I'm no expert here. I don't recall any USA ready-mix companies that
have these in use here though .

You mean something like this:
http://www.odisa.com/batch-plant-mobile.html

I think this has been around forever. For example there are special floating
plants for building concrete pylons and foundations for bridges.

Again, a complicated legal structure for small cement company. Also what does
the bold paragraph mean - no direct ownership but contractual agreements to
receive economic benefits... Strange stuff, especially considering what
"contractual agreements" with foreigners in China are worth.

 We own all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Xin Ao Construction
Materials, Inc., or BVI-ACM, a British Virgin Islands corporation, which in
turn owns 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Beijing Ao Hang Construction
Materials Technology Co., Ltd., or China-ACMH, a company incorporated under the
laws of China. On November 28, 2007, China-ACMH entered into a series of
contractual agreements with Beijing Xin Ao Concrete Co., Ltd., or Xin Ao, a
company incorporated under the laws of China, and its two shareholders, in
which China-ACMH effectively took over management of the business activities of
Xin Ao and has the right to appoint all executives and senior management and
the members of the board of directors of Xin Ao. While we have no direct equity
ownership in Xin Ao, through these contractual agreements we receive the
economic benefits of Xin Ao’s operations and are entitled to consolidate the
financial results of operations and accounts of Xin Ao in our financial
statements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

"Investors who doubted the stock picks of financier Seth Klarman were kicking
themselves on Wednesday after Facet Biotech, 14% of which is owned by Klarman's
Baupost Group, agreed to a $450 million cash buyout from Abbott Laboratories.

According to the two companies, Abbott Laboratories ( ABT - news - people )
will pay $27 per share, a slim discount after Facet Biotech ( FACT - news -
people ) jumped 66.6% to close at $27.01. Facet's stock traded between $5.86

I'll trim my outsize ABT position now. Management has done a very good job
integrating acquisitions, and maybe expensive purchase of FACT will be a winner
as well. (Market participants seem to believe that: ABT stock hasn't fallen

I show I've made 23 purchases of ABT beginning 3/10/09 through 8/12/09. It's
become one of my largest positions. With ABT's acquisition now and with ABT's
sales the drug Humira apparently slowing (18% of last year's revenue), I
believe I'll adjust my risk/reward balance by reducing my position.

Yahoo shows ABT with a current p/e of 15. That seems a tad high to me in
today's market, but very good compared to prior years' higher numbers. Forward
p/e is shown under 12, and by that, the stock would seem if not a buy, more of
a buy than a sell. For me though, perhaps not worth keeping an outsize position
on.

Madharry, ABT held in ira. My taxable account was full, and I had a bunch of
cash available to me in my large ira, so that's where I accumulated the
position.

Sad to say though, the tax advantage of holding for long-term capital gains
(vs. selling for short-term) wouldn't apply to me for my taxable accounts
anyway. I have enough capital loss carryovers from tax years '08 and '09, that
they'd cancel any capital gains, long-term or short-term, should they occur
this year. I've got enough losses to where it almost encourages me to make
short-term trades, since if there are trading gains, they'll be offset by the
carry-over losses.

Hi Madharry -

Those preferred REIT shares were a once in a life time buy and thanks goes to
Grommit for bringing up the different value buy opportunities in the eye of the
financial credit storm last year.

The easy part on the preferred shares is once they reach par (for HRP par is
$25.00/share) the upside is capped. You basically hold the shares for their
yield. Since I have been harvesting my capital losses (sell & buy back in 31
days), I need to recognize LT capital gains.

You should have a big winner with Gulf Resources, Inc. (GFRE) if you held on to
the stock. I passed in 2008/2009 when I should have at least taken a starter
position. This is a true multi-bagger. You get the congrats for staying with
that trade.

Just be sure to exit with your seed money and periodically take some cream off
the top too.

I left a lot of money on the table with my DRYs position. I got my seed money
out and a little bit more but rode the roller coaster "E" ticket ride from
$9.00/share to $130.00/share back to $6.00/share in 48 months.

It does feel good to pocket a bagger from time to time but there is never an
easy "sure" value trade as you know.

Balance sheet doesn't look so bad at $3095M in assets versus $2325M in

Hi Area51-
I continue to hold RAS but just a stub position. The preferred shares was a
good call since they stooped paying their dividend on the common over a year
ago. I originally bought it because the BV was claimed to be much higher than
the stock price (over 100%) but apparently the market thinks differently.

The lesson I learned is its a difficult business to understand and with all the
paper assets they own its hard to value their worth. The credit crunch made
these assets worthless with no active bids in the secondary markets and
definitely no liquidity in them for the company. It does appear that some of
this paper is coming back to life and the company actually reported positive
earnings last quarter.

The stock has responded too up over 50% in the last 30days. I have not added to
my position and in fact harvested some losses. What are the preferred shares
yielding, which ones do you own and how have they performed over the last 18
months?

I guess I would favor nibbling at some of the preferreds at this time rather
than trying to hit a home run with the common stock.

EKS,

Thanks for the reply. I agree the stock and the preferred have had a good run
of late (both up roughly 50% in 3 months)off the relatively good earnings
report. Buying before earnings when it the common was around $1 would have been
better. If you look at a 1 or 3 month chart it looks expensive, but on a longer
term chart or relative to book value it still looks fairly cheap to me.

RAS-A sells for around 15 and yields about 13%. I have gone from 90%
preferred\common split down to about 75%\25%. Which is the better purchase
(common\preferred) depends on investor objectives (certainly the common has a
better capital appreciation potential) and one's outlook for the company
(preferred is better if they just survive, common is better if they thrive).

My gut is that everyone is just disinterested in the company (perhaps for many
good reasons including the low stock price) which is why it still trades so
cheaply. Of course I could be very wrong, and the market sees future trouble
down the road that I haven't fully comprehended.

Not really one I wanted to recommend (although I added a little today), I just
one I wanted to get some independent opinions on it's outlook especially if
anyone still followed it closely.

Also looking at ADM after your earlier post. Can't figure if the results of

accepted 34% tendered 7.5% (2027). They accepted 100% of the long maturities
and and only 18% of the shortest maturity (17 years). I am not too sure if they
were able to buy these back at a discount but accepted everything with
maturities longer than 20 years.

Supervalu jumps amid leveraged buyout chatter

CHICAGO, March 12 (Reuters) - Shares of Supervalu Inc shot up more than 11
percent in heavy trading on Friday morning as rumors circulated that the
supermarket operator could be poised for a leveraged buyout.

Shares reached $17.89, their highest level since June, before retreating a bit
to trade up nearly 6 percent at $17.

"It's another takeover du jour story," Jud Pyle, chief investment strategist at
Options News Network, a division of option market making firm PEAK6 Investments
in Chicago, said in reference to trading in Supervalu.

"The rumor making the rounds is that Supervalu could be the target of a
leveraged buyout. Rumor is they could fetch $22.50 a share."

A spokesman for Supervalu, which runs grocery stores under names such as
Albertsons and Jewel-Osco, said the company does not comment on rumor or
speculation.

The March and April call options allowing investors to buy Supervalu shares at
$17.50 each are trading briskly, as logic would dictate, Pyle said.

Minneapolis-based Supervalu named Craig Herkert as chief executive officer in
May. One of the first tasks for Herkert, who was Wal-Mart Stores Inc's CEO of
the Americas region, was reviewing Supervalu's operations.

Since Herkert joined, the company has announced plans to sell some stores,
remodel others and expand its lower-priced Save-A-Lot format.

Yes, if you can manage your portfolio for .1% fees, then cef's aren't for you.

only owned shares in CET.

In general, I think the higher the market we're at (think Dow 14k), the harder
it is for me find value stocks. At those points, cef's like this make more
sense to me as at least a temporary place to put investing dollars.

Right now, I still think we're at a place where individual value stocks are out

Hello Charshay,

I really like GRVY and have owned it for months. The company is profitable and
has a lot of cash.

As my strategy continually evolves, I'm tending to shy away from value plays
that don't have a catalyst to unlock value. GRVY has a catalyst in that when
Ragnarok 2 comes out, hopefully later this year, I'm assuming that the stock
will run to some degree on the news and depending on that run, I will consider
selling. In the meantime, my view is that the stock should trade around $2
based on it's balance sheet and profitability.

I'm digressing a bit here, but in the same way, I like TGB, as they both have
catalysts this year. TGB is heading down the road to get it's Prosperity gold
mine approved, which will hopefully be a catalyst for futher stock price
growth. And if the mine approval is halted, I don't believe the stock price
will collapse based on the value of it's copper mine operations (though it will
probably decline to some degree).

I guess what has continually frustrated me in the past is buying a value stock
with no timeline and waiting forever for the stock to go up without a catalyst.
Hopefully GRVY will get Ragnarok 2 out the door this year, giving us an
opportunity to sell on a run.

We will see.

Thanks,

Saint Thomas Hospital, in Nashville, Tennessee, he logged on to a hospital
computer and went to a message board called techstocks.com. There he created a
thread called “value investing.” Having read everything there was to read about

I trimmed back CHGI by 1/3 this morning. Company may still grow if/as China
builds more nuclear plants.

Added a little to China real estate company, CHLN. Company may be carrying land
on its books well-below fair value. That's from what I gather from internet
reading. Not a fact verified by me. Even if all true, fair value could be
temporary if China in a real-estate bubble. So only a small position for me in
this stock.

At this price it does look like a fundamental buy. As for me, I've been long
gone and took Dale's cue in Nov to get out of remaining shares. That Sept - Oct
top in 2009 looked a little too formidable for me. I also exited SKYW a while
ago. The only one that kept my interest was AAWW.

I don't like when a stock like RJET declines for 4 or 5 months thru one of the
best rallies the market has had, fundamentals or no fundamentals.

some repositioning:
Out: D (valuation), OTE (swingtrade play)
In WMKQ (Wamu preferred), ES (follow GRSPIN)

WAMKQ - the recent ruling determines the floor for the Wamu preferred and it
better than zero. Some folks I follow think the settlement is at least 10% of
nominal, which would be 2.5$/share for WAMKQ. I bought at 1.3X$ today so it
seems like a decent return potential.

I continue to add to some dinky small cap bank stocks. i won't post them here

RE: Dominion Resources, Inc. (D)

Hi Spekulatius - What's your valuation criteria with D where you feel it is
currently over valued?

The stock has had a pretty good run since it was mentioned on this thread (up
30% from 5/2010). The forward PE of 12.1 seems reasonable compared to other
utilities. The 4.6% dividend is still at a fair level.

I guess if you compare a 2 year chart with the UTY index and DJI index, D has
out performed and money could be deployed else where for a better return.
http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=D#chart4:symbol=d;range=2y;compare=
^uty+^dji;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on
source=undefined

My problem is where do you deploy the funds to get a similar dividend and
better long term upside. D may have 10%-15% left to the upside especially if
the FED signals that they plan to maintains low rate for the foreseeable future
(ie longer term: 12-18 months).

Consol Energy Buys Gas Assets From Dominion
March 15, 2010, 9:36 am
http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/consol-energy-buys-gas-assets-from
dominion/?partner=yahoofinance

From the article:"...Consol Energy will buy the Appalachian natural gas
properties of Dominion Resources for $3.48 billion in cash, giving it a leading
position in the growing Marcellus Shale field, Reuters reports...."

================================================================

Not sure if the deal includes the pipeline assets of Dominion Resources (aka
Dominion Transmission).

Dominion Transmission is a natural gas pipeline that brings gas from the Cove
Point LNG terminal in Maryland and gas from Ohio and Virginia into extensive
natural gas storage fields in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and also brings
gas into New England. It is owned by Dominion Resources.

Sold 1/3 of my Dominion Resources, Inc. (D) and bought equivalent shares in
CONSOL Energy Inc. (CNX). CNX has a forward PE of 10 but only pays .70%
dividend. You get coal and NG reserves in CNX with reserves located in the
heart of the Marcellus Shale field.

CNX. That looks like a good idea. I'll hold my D for a while, but start a
tracking position in CNX. Stock drops further, I'll likely add.

WSJ has a basically negative article on the acquisition. Although the price
paid was good - or at least on some measures (per acre costs, for example)
better than recent acquirers have paid, the issue is that CNX changes from
being a coal company to being a conglomerate (coal and gas). And conglomerates
are valued in the market at lower p/e's than are focused companies (i.e. coal
producers).

On the CNX website, CNX seems to view themselves as an energy producer, both
coal and gas. I've no issue with that. Stock price is beat down enough to where
it seems it might be a buy.

Management looks like it can deliver: Website says Fortune has it as one of
it's "most admired" corporations. A positive for a coal company -g-. Also I see
very good stock performance when looking over a long time frame:

Miniscule dividend yes, so I'll go for a promise of capital gain, and put this

Hi Paul

Here is a good article regarding the CNX purchase.

Consol in $3.5B gas deal
Cecil firm buying 500,000 acres in Marcellus shale
http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10075/1043083-28.stm

From the article:"...The deal, slated to close by April 30, will add 1.64
million acres to Consol's footprint, with about 500,000 acres in the so-called
"fairway of the Marcellus shale," the portion of the natural gas reserve
running northeast from central West Virginia through southwestern Pennsylvania.

Consol's new total of 750,000 acres in the Marcellus shale should put it in
third place behind Range Resources, of Fort Worth, Texas, and Chesapeake
Energy, of Oklahoma City, each of which has leased well over a million acres in
the Marcellus.

The Consol purchase will include more than 9,000 producing wells in
Pennsylvania and West Virginia, with net annual production of 41 billion cubic
feet...."

===============================================================

Consol plans to pay for the deal by issuing between $2 billion and $2.5 billion
of new stock, and between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of debt. Therefore, it's
possible you will see more pressure on the stock when the new stock comes to
market. They may just sell the whole chunk as a private placement.

The other hidden jewel in the mix is the NG pipe line that feeds to the
Maryland LNG terminal. I do not know if this asset is included in the sale or
if D maintains control or maybe D spins it off. I would love to own a piece of
that to put in my basket of NG stocks.

just to be devil's advocate this company shows $200Mmilion in market cap and
$2.3 Billion in debt. they have recently purchased midwest express and frontier
airlines. so they may be a far cry from the company that they used to be. I
used to fly midwest express. they were a spinoff from scott paper i believe and
it was a joy to fly them leather seats, real cutlery, etc. i doubt that the new
organization will retain those frills which made it so nice to fly. I guess
rjet is mostly a regional carrier probably paying little above minimum wage to
its pilots. When I flew more I used to have frequent problems with reigional
airlines and maybe this is why. Now I drive whenever I can.

It may paid to heed's buffetts advice, something about mostly losing money on

Good luck with VSEC. I haven't gotten back in yet and the short term at least
looks a bit questionable. It is a very good Co. though and I keep it on watch.

I haven't made a great deal of changes to my portfolio lately and I usually do
in my trading account. But I'm fairly content and optimistic about my current
holdings. I was probably fortunate to have exited FUQI a while ago, but its
pretty impossible for me to post every trade and exit on all my positions. I
mainly just try to bring a few I really like to the attn of the board at
opportune times. My single largest position is GIB which I continue to like. A
few others at the moment which I really like include RINO, WATG, FLR, EBIX,
GFA, FCX, CTEL, HRBN, and TMWEF. Then some more speculative stocks but the list
is subject to change anytime. Some have had good runs, a few I've cut small

Paul, I'm just going to have to be patient with HUM. I still like it's
valuations.

I really like your RJET pick. Can you be any more specific on your valuation
criteria? Especially your use of the 'tangible book value'.

I've started a purely speculative, non-value related position in SIRI. I like
this stock for a few of reasons.
1. It's a monopoly.
2. It just posted first profit since it's merger with XM.
3. It's making strong efforts to manage debt.
4. The financial media absolutely hates it.

It was just added to the Nasdaq Q-50 so there will probably be a squeeze this
friday as the few funds that mirror the Q50 will have to add by then. Again,
pure speculation.

RJET. I'm believing it could move back up and trade at multiples of book value,
either stated or tangible, where it's traded in past.

From '04 through '09 the low p/e reported by S&P has ranged from 3 to 8. The
high p/e in each of those years varied between 8-12. With a current p/e of 5,
and a forward consensus estimate of 3, there's some indication that RJET is
cheap historically. Net income's increased every year from '00 to '08 with a
50% drop in '09.

There are some things going on here that might be considered. RJET's
acquisitions which will be need to be integrated successfully, the number of
shares outstanding has increased with the acquisitions, and so on.

As I read RJET's website, it seems to me it could be possible that RJET might
be one of the few (?) airline companies where airline management is competent,
and where they actually try to consider stockholders as one of their
stakeholders.

There's no reason that I can see that RJET can't continue to be profitable and
with increasing earnings. So over time, it's easy for me to outlook RJET stock
back over $10. Even if the price of aviation fuel should rise and cause fear as
it did in '08, I might expect the stock to fall, but not greatly so: In the bad
times of '08 high oil, the stock was at $7-8, if I've got my time frame and
chart right:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=RJET&t=5y

Going forward, given the acquisitions RJET's recently made, possibly tangible
book value will be more appropriate to look at than stated book value. There's
some evidence that looking at any book value for an airline is meaningless,
because some airline stocks that have traded below book have gone bk,
especially as managements have suddenly cut bv, realizing some of their planes
are not worth what's on the books, or that the plane's can't generate adequate
revenue. As a pivot point for me, I like to use book value. For RJET, whether
it's stated bv or tangible, RJET stock trades under book value. $6.02 tangible
isn't that much above closing stock price, so that has to be weighed too. Otoh,
roe or return on stated book value has been pretty good, and if we place that
return on the lower tangible book value figure, ROE may be very good indeed
going forward.

Of course there's the Buffett story, something about where he tells Charlie
Munger to have him (Buffett) committed if Buffett ever buys stock in an
airline, because he surely must be crazy. I have bought some of the regional
airlines and followed them right into bankruptcy, and so having lost a bunch of
money here, I realize these stocks, if bought, have to be watched closely, and
really can't or shouldn't or won't be long-term investments. OTOH, of the three
airline stocks I bought last year and am holding now, I'm in positive territory
in all three (as of today anyway). So I come to believe if these stocks
(airline stocks) can be bought correctly, there are profits to be had.

Also fwiw, I control risk by position size. I find myself subject to the
received wisdom that airline stocks are lousy investments, so my positions in
these stocks are small. RJET too, even though I believe the odds are in my
favor.

If I had only a small bankroll for the stock market, I'm not sure I'd be a
buyer of RJET as my first stock choice or any choice. Otoh though, in for
something good is better than out with nothing. So even a very small buy - if
it works out - will at least help increase the portfolio's value.

Aside: Have an HD unit in another car, and that's pretty good too. Better FM

monthly/yearly fee, and of course, the stations broadcasting in HD can and do
send info through the unit's screen (station id/song title/artist/ads). Perhaps

re RJET - the way I look at valuations, SKYW is cheaper due to lower leverage
on an EV/EBITDA basis. RJET with a 200M$ market cap (equal to about the
tangible book) and approx. 2B$ in EV value appears to be trading more like an
option - if they make it, RJET could become a multibagger. I think overall SKYW
looks a little cheaper and a more solid bet, or does anyone think that RJET has
a competitive advantage over SKYW that needs to be taken into consideration?

The thing about SKYW is that it flies for Delta/United, and when/if Delta or
United puts the squeeze on SKYW at contract times, then it's possible the stock
swoons. I don't know when contracts expire, but I've held an airline whose
contract was yanked, the stock cratered, and I said no more. SKYW might be
invaluable to Delta and United, might have long time to go before contract
renewal, and does seem to have pretty decent numbers. For me though, I'll
avoid.

"The company operated a fleet of 449 aircrafts, of which 258 were assigned to
Delta Air Lines, 186 were assigned to United Air Lines, 3 were assigned to
Midwest Airlines, and 2 were assigned to AirTran Airways."

Hello Paul,

As a business traveler, I've owned several Hotel Reits, but no airlines. That
being said, I think RJET is really a bet on how well they can integrate recent
acquisitions like Frontier and Midwest. I had actually never flown either of
those airlines, but I had heard good things about both in comparison to other
legacy airlines. I hadn't heard much about Republic itself.

If they can integrate these acquisitions well, if business travel picks up, and
if there's no airline price war, I could see RJET stock doing well. It's not
one of the 5-10 individual stocks I hold right now, but I could see buying some
shares if I stretched my holdings to more stocks.

Thanks,

SKYW - I agree that being a subcontractor for the major arilines deserves a
valuation discount.

RJET has an interesting presentation on their website. They claim a 15% cost
advantage on their fixed fee business (about 37% of the revenues). I also did
not realize that some of their debt seems to be due to credit card holdback and
virtually all of their debt is asset backed ( lower interest rates).
