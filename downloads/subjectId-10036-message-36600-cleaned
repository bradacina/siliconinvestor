About utilities, I've added today to ENEL.

About http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ENLAY

"Enel is Italy’s largest power company, and Europe’s second listed utility by
installed capacity. It is an integrated player which produces, distributes and
sells electricity and gas.
After the acquisition of the Spanish utility Endesa, Enel is now present in 23
countries with a generating capacity of approximately 95,000 MW, serving over
61 million power and gas customers.
Listed on the Milan stock exchange since 1999, Enel is the Italian company with
the highest number of shareholders, some 1.3 million retail and institutional
investors in 2008.
Enel is also the second-largest Italian operator in the natural gas market,
with approximately 2.7 million customers and a 10% market share in terms of
volumes (on December 31, 2008)."

Giving outdated numbers (year 2008) though on the website doesn't give me
confidence in somebody's competence. -g-

Lot of debt (from acquisition of Spanish utility); management claims they will
reduce debt:

http://www.enel.com/en-GB/investor/press_releases/release.aspx?iddoc=1629603

Dividend has been reduced in '09 from '08:

http://www.enel.com/en-GB/investor/stock_market/dividends/

Looks like about .39 euros. Which would now be $.54. That's before taxes are
taken. I'm not sure what that rate would be for foreign (USA) investors. Maybe
15%? Anyway, yield looks pretty decent (if distribution holds up) for a $5.20
stock of a big utility. And now as I consider, .54 looks better than decent,
and I'm having some difficulty confirming amount: I can't tell from Yahoo, SI,
or my brokerage accounts if it's correct.

I guess the stock drop is based on strength of USA dollar, and worries now
about "sovereign default" - Greece, Spain, Portugal. ENEL is a utility though,
supplying presumably essential services. I understand governments could freeze
prices or something. Can't believe they would kill company though. ENEL is
diversified in Americas, Russia, and Italy (of course). Company seems pretty
aggressive vis-a-vis what one might consider for a USA utility: that is,
company has a big green component, is starting up a photovoltaic business, is
active in nuclear plant construction, and so on.

Fwiw, I started buying ENLAY in July. My purchase prices have been: $5.23,
$5.10, $5.85, $5.67, $5.45, and now more at $5.22. If stock continues to fall
on no adverse company-specific news, I'll continue to add.

Cosan May Bid for Eni Gas Assets in Brazil, CFO Says (Update2

Feb. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Cosan SA Industria & Comercio, the world’s largest maker
of ethanol from sugar cane, may bid for Eni SpA’s Brazilian natural-gas
distribution assets.

“We are considering bidding; the decision has not been made yet,” Cosan Chief
Financial Officer Marcelo Martins said today on a conference call with
analysts. “Eni’s assets in Brazil look interesting and are complementary to our
business.”

Gas Brasiliano Distribuidora, a unit of Rome-based Eni, is a natural-gas
distributor in northwestern Sao Paulo state.

Barra Bonita, Brazil-based Cosan bought 1,500 service stations and other assets
from Exxon Mobil Corp. for $826 million in 2008, and agreed to acquire
service-station network Petrosul in December. Cosan also is in negotiations to
form a joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell Plc to combine ethanol, sugar and
fuel distribution assets in Brazil.

Cosan fell 2.4 percent to 23.27 reais in Sao Paulo. The shares have more than
doubled in the past year.

with institutions that are really too important to fail without bringing the
whole economy to its knees.

the notion that the same legislators who got us into this mess think they can
fix the mess seems like Geithner redux. The real source of the instability of
the financial system can be placed at the feet of legislators who failed to set
up sufficient regulations of derivative products and capital requirements.
there is no need to offer someone like geithner some kind of unlimited power to
do what he thinks he needs to do. also credit default swaps are an insurance
product they should be treated like that. if you dont have something you need

I think that several of these "gathering" companies provide an excellent

price.

If any others hit your radar screen, please post. I plan to accumulate a small

APL is difficult when projecting cash flows.
IMO the market has not quite figured out the cash flows that the company will
have going forward. APL just does not break out the numbers clearly on thier
portion of product.
They are currently IMO almost completely unhedged. The last of the rotten
hedges they entered into drop off in this quarter.
They have a presentation on thier website with an audio and slide portion. Well
worth the time.
My bullish scenario has distributions starting in 1st Q of 2011 at $2.50 to
$3.00 per year.
Cash flows this year are being used to pay down debt.
They have current exposure to 350 million gallons a year of NGL's. The majority
on POP contracts.
That works out to 6 gallons per share in NGL's per year rising significantly
going out 3 years.
If the world does not go back into recession this company will prove to be a
bargain by several degrees.
The majority of thier profit is NGL's and about 70% of the value of the NGL's
is propane.
Inventories are down significantly and prices are staying high even with the
oil correction.
Saved by cold weather but I will be happy to take it.
They also have a general partner AHD. AHD higher risk as far as price for
expected distributions but if APL really takes off the general partner will go
higher in price.
I chose the less risky APL for now.

LPS. Looks to me like it was a pretty decent quarter. Stock down though. Maybe

"For full year 2010, we expect revenues to grow 8%-10% compared to 2009 and

Assuming net income/sh is even lower than company's "adjusted earnings", the
2010 p/e estimate on the stock (trades about $37.50 now) would be higher than
10.8-10.5. Yahoo shows consensus pe on net income to be 9.8, so either company
is conservatively projecting or analysts are overestimating earnings.

Unless I've missed something in browsing the report, this is one of the more
poorly written press releases I've seen in a while. Net income per share for
the year is not disclosed. Very unusual. Nor is the number of fully-diluted
shares outstanding mentioned. (I calculate 97.3M shares out. from the revenue
and revenue-per-share numbers they do provide for q4.)

The message falsely claims that "we have absolutely no gain" from the loan. In
fact, the loan is being made specifically to finance purchase by Petrobras of
U.S.-made oilfield equipment and services. The mission of the Ex-Im Bank is to
encourage exports by making such loans.

The message claims that George Soros would "benefit most" from the loan, but
that is also a baseless accusation. Soros is a favorite whipping boy of
conservatives because of his early financial help to the liberal group
MoveOn.org. And he is indeed a major investor in Petrobras, through his New
York-based hedge-fund firm, Soros Fund Management LLC. But the hedge fund
recently sold 22 million shares of common stock in the company (which carry
voting rights) while buying 5.8 million shares of preferred stock (which is
non-voting.) As reported by Bloomberg News, Soros reduced his stake in the
company before any of the Ex-Im Bank’s promised loan has been dispensed.

There is some truth to the claim that China would benefit, but not much. Brazil
recently agreed to export 200,000 barrels of oil per day to China in coming
years. But that was in return for a loan by China of $10 billion, five times
more than the U.S. Ex-Im Bank is lending to finance purchase of U.S. gear.

The Ex-Im Bank also would like it known that no loan has yet been made, and
that the "preliminary commitment" could eventually result in either a direct
loan or a loan guarantee. Either way, the Ex-Im Bank states, "no taxpayer
dollars are involved." The bank is self-sustaining.

Here's another input from a friend of mine:

Fact Check's analysis is correct. It has nothing to do with Obama, it has
nothing to do with US Taxpayer dollars, it has nothing to do with supporting
off-shore drilling in US waters, it has nothing to do with George Soros.

What it does seem to prove is what many have voiced over the past year or so,
that the WSJ, which used to be a very reliable source of business and economic
news has now been so fully ruined by Murdoch, that it has little credibility
left, and that many now refer to it as The Murdoch Street Journal.

I worked on numerous Ex-IM projects overseas many years ago. The Ex-IM exists
to SUPPORT US JOBS by providing low cost financing for foreign projects that
commit to buy goods and services from US (domestic) based sources for the
project. It does that by providing either direct loans to the foreign
purchaser, or, through loan guarantees to the purchaser.

As an example, one of the projects I worked on was for a project outside of
Istanbul, where we negotiated the financing structure through ABN-AMRO, where
ABN-AMRO would provide the financing for the project, but since we were
providing a large percentage of the project from US based suppliers, EX-IM
agreed to guarantee the loans with a guarantee of the US sourced goods and
services, which allowed the end user to get a lower interest rate, which made
the project more financially attractive, which in turn, supported US jobs to
produce those goods and services.

Had the EX-IM not been in place to support the efforts, the project either
wouldn't have happened as reasonble financing wouldn't have been available and
the costs would have been prohibitive, or would have been sourced from European
firms.

Obviously, who ever wrote that garbage has no idea what they're talking about;
but they clearly look to be part of the right wing hate machine.

The larger companies always tried to manage output. I think what has changed is
that that many raw materials have become investment vehicles via ETF, futures,
hoarding in China which adds to demand, unless these guys try to sell of

reflects the risk that this merger may not happen after all, not an

Mergers & Acquisitions
Is FirstEnergy’s Deal Really Worth It?

From the article:"...But the combination needs to pass muster with regulators,
and they are sure to demand a large share of the synergies on behalf of
rate-paying electricity customers, Reuters Breakingviews suggests. FirstEnergy
assumes half of the savings to accrue from the regulated parts of the deal may
disappear this way, it says.

That may be a canny move to placate state regulators, particularly those in
Maryland, where in 2006 regulators blocked FPL’s merger with Constellation
Energy. But it erodes the financial rationale of the deal, Reuters
Breakingviews argues...."

Westinghouse Statement Regarding Issuance of Conditional Loan Guarantees for
New Nuclear Construction
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Westinghouse-Statement-prnews-1641693312.html?x=0
.v=1

From the article:"...Westinghouse and its consortium team member The Shaw Group
(NYSE:SHAW - News), are under contract to provide two of Westinghouse
AP1000&#226;?&#162; nuclear power plants at Southern's Vogtle site in
Georgia.&#194; The consortium is also building four AP1000s&#226;?&#162; in
China and has been selected to provide no less than 12 additional AP1000s
elsewhere in the United States....".
=================================================================

The nuclear component for Shaw is small but growing. Shaw also makes money on
the reoccurring service business from the new Nuclear facilities.

The real value (if you are betting on a stronger $US dollar) is their $1.5B
assumed loan from Toshiba (from the purchase of Westinghouse) which is pegged
in Yen/$U.S.. As the $US dollar gets stronger, this debt is worth less on their
balance sheet and the company's net worth increase.

Nice pop in uranium supplier USEC today. Likely to fall back because there's
really no immediate payday for the company. I'm still holding shares in it and
in SO.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SO,USU&d=s

Above article's author also states, "The George W. Bush administration set
aside $18 billion in loan guarantees for new nuclear construction. The three
other finalists for that remaining money are NRG Energy, which is hoping to
build two reactors in Texas, the South Carolina utility SCANA, and
Constellation Energy which is hoping to build a reactor in Maryland. The Obama
administration announced in January that it would triple the guarantees to $54
billion, and try to develop a plan for dealing with nuclear waste. Southern Co.
will be the leader, but with $46 billion still on the table, there will be
plenty of followers."

I'm holding shares in Scana (SCG) and NRG. NRG's come down and is now trading
below the all-stock buyout offer it recently received and rejected. I am
weighing adding a few more. SO's dropped somewhat too, and with a 5.6% div
yield, might be a consideration for a buy or add too.
