Hi, Paul:
What's your rationale for getting (back) into BL? Did you see the mention of
increased allowance for doubtful accounts in the 10-Q, and does that concern
you?
Still calculate BV @ about $29/share, how "hard" would you consider that BV?

Regarding HDL....I like the progression of the numbers from 1998 to 1999 to
2000. But through 9 months of their fiscal 2001, they are Free Cash Flow
negative and I can't seem to find them commenting about it in the 10Q
(admittedly, I only looked in "managements discussion" for commentary). Do you
have any insights?

What I'm talking about is: although CFO is showing at $15M, when I look at the
change in cash for the period (-8.53M) and adjust for non-operational cash flow
in the investing and financing areas, I get a negative cash flow of about
.15/share for the nine month period.

re: BL. Wallace, book value for these 'fashion' retailers is iffy, imo. On the
one hand. book value is increasing, so they've not taken substantial
write-offs. OTOH, that suggests it could be only a matter of time before they
do. They are investing $23M in improving order fulfillment and they are
outsourcing as well. It's to-be-determined what kind and how much writeoffs
there will be (if any). 

Given the lousy ROE numbers on that high book value, I'd say the stock is
generally reasonably valued at about 20 in years like now when BL has
relatively low earnings. Providing book value doesn't get chopped in a
restatement or in future, BL price/book value ought to increase (imo) when BL
earnings improve.

BL is not growing revenues. Revenues seems stuck at somewhat over $.5B/year.
Earnings though, move around quite a bit - maybe that's due to general economic
fluctuations and/or to the luck/skill that BL can muster to capture customers
with each new year's 'fashion' offerings.

I'm betting the stock will come back, as it has in the past.

Helpful to patient investors is the knowledge that insiders are persistent

Asbestos. I stopped right there. Thanks for the idea. 

Thanks for the enlightening critique!

From the SLS 10Q:

"....6. Legal Proceedings

The Company is a defendant along with a number of other parties in
approximately 100 lawsuits as of December 31, 2000 (approximately 200 as of
December 31, 1999) alleging that plaintiffs have or may have contracted
asbestos-related diseases as a result of exposure to asbestos
products or equipment containing asbestos sold by one or more named defendants.
Due to the noninformative nature of the complaints, the Company does not know
whether any of the complaints state valid claims against the Company. The lead
insurance carrier has informed the Company that the primary policy for the
period July 1, 1972 , July 1, 1975 has been exhausted and that the lead carrier
will no longer provide a defense under that policy. The Company has requested
that the lead carrier substantiate this situation. The Company has contacted
representatives of the Companys excess insurance carrier for some or all of
this period. The Company does not believe that the asserted exhaustion of the
primary insurance coverage for this period will have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations of the Company.
Management is of the opinion that the number of insurance carriers involved in
the defense of the suits and the significant number of policy years and policy
limits to which these insurance carriers are insuring the Company make the
ultimate disposition of these lawsuits not material to the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations....."

After all the years this asbestos-related liability litigation has been
occurring, I believe it a "mature market". I'm inclined to believe the
company's statements regarding their exposure and I make my investment decision
based on the merits of their business fundamentals. I believe the investment
provides an adequate margin of safety, nice potential for appreciation, and a
nice dividend while I wait Mr. Market to cast a favorable eye.

Alan,
first of all thx for your reply. I did check ALU, interesting company. I might
get into ALU too after their quarterly announcement which doesn'T seem to be
too good..

Anyway worth noting should be that DFA (Dimensional Fund Advisors) almost
doubled their holding in both: ALU and PARL.

Main difference btw. PARL and ALU is that PARL is way more a manufacturer, ALU
more a distributor, that also explains the big difference in gross margins:
PARL: 60%+ ALU: 11%+

I did see the going concern footnotes but IMHO they are mainly due to the
refinancing that has to be done. Their exposure to Perfumania accounts
receivable has been halved over the last year. Look at their trend (downwards)
in debts, they deleveraged tremendously over the last 3 years, they might
become debt free next year - which would render a refinancing obsolete because
there won't be any debt left..

I am suspicious of ALU. I have followed the company off and on since buying its
IPO many years ago. (I have not owned it in years.) I believe they did some
private placement last year on relatively poor terms, when the stock looked
quite cheap. When someone does a deal on terms that appear to make no sense to
me (and I have done privates myself, so have some knowledge), I wonder what
someone else knows that I do not. Sort of like a floorless convertible being a

I'm also suspicious of PARL, Crossy.

There was a PARL thread several years back. The concern then - especially after
a negative Forbes article - was the ownership position of the CEO, and his
deals and self-serving with Perfumania (?) which he or his brother also
controlled. (I am saying this from memory - and I might have it wrong.) Anyway,
as I read your post, it appears that if there were a problem, it's been
resolved. That's to the good.

You've said "I calculated a P&L "potential" model and arrived at a high-end
quarerly EPS 0,20 that could be achieved by just a 10% increase in revenues.
With consumer spending strong, this seems to be outright possible for the total
year."

The product should be easy and cheap to manufacture. With most sales coming for
the Christmas season, and most purchases made by women for their husbands
and/or boyfriends and/or other males.

It's the repeat sales that I always wondered about. Not too many times does the
subject of cologne come up with my buddies. Not too many times in the past few
years have I felt the need for a new bottle of cologne. That could be saying
something about me and my friends grooming habits, maybe -g-, but I'd say in
the competitive marketplace (brand image, fashion of the season), for PARL to
raise revenues (if they do it without smoke/mirrors) - that will be difficult.

"...worth noting should be that DFA (Dimensional Fund Advisors) almost doubled
their holding in both: ALU and PARL. "

I'd say not worth noting. DFA is a strange fund imo. I'm one for lots of
diversification, but these guys are ridiculous. They own pages of stuff. I'll
defer to you or anybody else here who's got better knowledge, but it seems to
me these folks are indexers of some kind. They're not buying on fundamentals
but rather on some sector style. You will see them owning all sorts of junk
that nobody or very few other funds have. I'm not saying they are wrong to buy
PARL, only that I ignore DFA anytime I see them with an ownership position in a
stock I'm investigating.

PARL might work out. I wouldn't want it to be a significant portion of my
portfolio or my only value stock.

Jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times before.

In revisiting PHSY prior to committing new funds, I talked to someone
(Shirley?) at Pacificare. First, management recently dropped the EPS estimate
to $1.65 (actually 1.65 to 1.75). That number IS net of goodwill amortization
expense. Further, that expense consists of tangible (approximately 90c) and
intangible (approximately 1.60). Based on the new FASB rule, the 2002 eps will
exclude the intangible goodwill amortization expense and will include the
tangible goodwill amortization expense.

I don't think tangible goodwill amortization expense is a cash expense, so I
think it should be added back... but accounting is not a strength for me.

I added at $16.60.

Jeffrey,
understand your thoughts on ALU..

let me add my 2cents:

they were acquiring many pharmaceutical related business, sort of a sector
"rollover" plan.

Their base was distributing fragrances & health/beauty products. This part was
not growing last year and the gross margins here are meager..

What I like is seing their private label fragrances growing 100% y/y. Gross
margins here are quite high, usually 50% or more. What I do not like in ALU is
their pharmaceutical segement which posts huge sales but meager contribution to
profits. The 10% gross margin or less for a pharmaceutical distribution company
is really problematic.

When I see that adressed in the future I might be a buyer. Valuations are good
and the "gearing" is quite fine..

Paul,
thx for your reply..

That concern is still there but the size of any problematic exposure was
greatly reduced. The way PARL generated cash flow big time to overcome its
critical moment 3 years ago also.

The repeat sales don't bother me because they are a manufacturer and
distributor not a retailer (!) and it's their job. If the web is moving things
it'S equally fine for them. BTW this is a reason why gross margins are very
high here (60%) because they are not the retailers in this sector..

DFA - they have smallcap arm and yes they are "sector" investors. BUT - and
this is important - they usually go for valuations big time, especially PSR
(price/sales) vs. indsutry mean and PE or "normalized PE" if applicable.. The
might be strange but I prefer this approach to the many bellwether seekers
plowing another $10m into CSCO at $50..

re: goodwill amortization

Brendan,
goodwill amortization is ALWAYS a noncash expense. When the SEC (foolishly
IMHO) closed the door for "pooling of interest" type of takeovers the problem
with the goodwill amortization crept in. As a believer in industrial accounting
over financial accounting I usually prefer EBITDA figures and reduce that by
the I part (Interest). You get a quasi-earnings before taxes figure that
excludes all those effects that I consider "artificial"

Goodwill,
usually that is created when a company does an acquisition under the "purchase"
rule, the only remaining option in the US now..

the difference btw. the assets in the books of the company acquired and what
was paid for (the takeover cost) is recorded in the "goodwill" item. And that
is reduced by a straight line method over a chosen timeframe (usually 2-10
years). A similar item is created when a company does a Chapter 11
restructuring. In all those situations the earnings "LOOK" depressed but they
aren't. I look at it as an "artificial" accounting treatment. Wallstreet thinks
acc. the same lines and created the "cash earnings" figure which excludes the
goodwill amortization.

Techs in Europe ? ACtually Europe is a shameful place regarding the market.
They think here only of rising taxes not lowering it. Actually most governments
here hate free market thinking. I wouldn't invest here big time.

What I like ? Mediaset of Italy (no kidding) - they should thrive now that
Berlusconi is Italy's PM. Mediolanum of Italy (an Insurer). Maybe Pfeiffer

Kaneb (KAB)

Interesting looking company.

It is a limited partnership and I'm not sure if I'm aware of all of the
implications of that for me as an individual limited partner.

Anyone with insights regarding that and would like to share them, I would
appreciate it. I have a basic understanding (perhaps more than that) of the
structure. Just not sure if the distributions from a limited partnership are
treated any differently tax-wise than dividends from any other company. I did
notice that there is a provision in law (Delaware law, in this case I think)
where if the partnership distributes too much cash, the limited partners may be
charged back for the excess distribution for up to three years after the fact,
but I'm not clear on how often that happens in real life. So I'm looking for a
handle on how to evaluate it for risk.

There seems to be a discrepancy between the number of shares listed on Yahoo
and the number of limited partnership units listed on the filings. I will use
the filings as the source.

I see that they filed an S3 on 6/5/01 to sell 1.9 million shares. None of the
proceeds to go to Kaneb. The bulk, 1.8 million +/- from one company. Do you
have any insights on that? Was that from a previous acquisition or what? The
transaction doesn't look to be adding to the total number of partnership units
outstanding (but I could be wrong here), rather it looks like just a large sale
by one owner. As such, it wouldn't be dilutive, but it might be depressing on
the share price until that extra capacity gets absorbed.

Would appreciate your thoughts.

Not that it matters, but I was the one who first suggested MOVI on this board.
Several times dating as far back as March 2000 actually
(http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=13280205), despite major
criticism each time. Not that criticism is bad, it is actually quite useful. My
point is that few others seemed interested in a clear value stock.

My next recommendation is fashionmall.com (FASH). FASH sells way below cash
value ($2.17 mkt prc vs. 4.00+ cash) and cash burn has slowed significantly. I
have been tracking FASH for over a year now, as it has been mentioned on the
Low Price/Cash board several times. A few weeks ago, I finally bought in.

I do not believe fashionmall's business is going to take over the world, but I

Thanks TimbaBear! I'll tell you what I know.

purchases of the common stock and effective on 7/1/01.

http://www.russell.com/US/Indexes/US/membership/recon_additions.asp

2) I am not sure of the partnership implications. There have been a few real
estate (forest) deals that I have been involved with that have been
partnerships -- but am not clear on this situation. (I anticipate selling the
partnership shares -- and holding the higher growth common stock.) The
partnership shares are being spunoff 1 for every 3 Kaneb owned.

3) I am showing (according to Value Line Extended) Kaneb Services had 31.14
million shares at the end of 2000. I like the fact that Franklin Balance Sheet
is the top institutional holder -- since that fund does focus on the financial
statements.

Per Kaneb's earnings statement, dated 3/31/01, Kaneb had 31.261 (basic) million
shares and 32.984 (diluted).

4) I am not sure of the issue of the 1.9 million shares to be sold -- per the
6/5/01 filing. (FWIW: the 1st quarter of 2001 share of earnings includes a
$6,113,000 non-cash gain on the issuance of units by Kaneb Pipe Line Parners LP
(KPP)).

The financial statements are difficult to interpret due to Kaneb's "share of
the pipelines, terminaling and product marketing businesses are now required to
be reported in the financial statements as 'discontinued operations --
businesses to be distributed to common shareholders'".

Time will tell -- I'm not clear on all of the different factors involved. I do
believe that management is attempting to unlock value.

Pick for 2003:

Marty Whitman (who I respect greatly on a personal basis) & Louis Navellier are
optimistic on TRC. This stock has gone nowhere for 15-years, and things really
are turning quickly -- due to a change in management and the energy crisis.

A quick look at the assets will indicate that the value of this company is a
minimum of $100 per share. This assumes a value of approximately $8,500 per
acre: (assuming 170,000 acres, of the 270,000 company owned acres, can be
classified as developable).

A fair market analysis of the company indicates the true value of this firm.
Although I am projecting 2-years to maximize value (Marty continues to scoop up
shares & this is one of Louis's top-five holdings), the value is easy to
calculate.

Anybody else follow this company? I have an extensive holding of corporate
documents, valuations of nearby properties, and media articles.

Marty Whitman (5/15/01) on TRC:

http://sageonline.com/transcript.asp?id=15217&ps=1&s=8

Question: Do you still consider Tejon Ranch <trC> safe and cheap in the
mid-$20s?

Yes. It's especially safe and cheap if the management will be able to get to
the property reasonably priced electric power from a captive or semi-captive
source. Management is working on this.

Question: Do you consider American Express Company [AXP] to be attractive at
the current price?

I don't really know it. Our current investments in common stocks are earnings
common stocks and wealth creation common stocks. Among earnings common stocks
our criteria for buying are that the shares should be available at well under
10 times peak earnings, provided we think the next peak will be a lot better
than the present peak. In wealth creation common stocks, we are buying issues
at at least 30 percent discounts from readily ascertainable net asset values
(NAVs). Neither American Express common nor any large cap market leaders I've
looked at meet our criteria for either earnings, common stocks or wealth
creation common stocks.

of Kaneb Pipe Line Partners, L.P." --- this is an excerpt from the 6/6/01
company news.

1) KPP is already issued and trading (20.29 million outstanding shares).

2) KSL will be new symbol for the new KAB.

3) KSL owns 5.1 million KPP shares. I'm trying to identify where the 1 for 3
spinoff (which Kaneb will spinoff on 6/29/01) shares will come from?

4) This does seem like a good arbitrage opportunity -- if I can identify all of
the exact issues.

Based upon KPP trading already, @ $36, then this gives us part of the
equation...

This was taken from the Yahoo message board. But the numbers appear to answer
some of the questions that I was seeking (now I have to figure out if it is
correct! I'll call the company back tomorrow.

"...$37.11/share kpp x 5,100,000 shares that kab owns / 31,235,242 approx.
outstanding kab shares = $6.06/share alone. Furmanite =$2.00/share,technology
worth $1/share atleast. Add them up and you get $9.00/share. I think that a big
seller has been selling in small lots instead of a large block that is why we
have been down the last few days. Once they are done we will be back to
$7.25/share quiet fast. Once kab split is implemented we should be over
$8/share. JMHO and I invite other people to respond..."

Opinion on buying TRC (Tejon):

You've asked if anyone here follows TRC. Given that this is one of the few
value threads on SI; and that many people here in their research endeavors have
come to know Mr Whitman, his record, his book, and his funds; and that a few
posters here live in Southern California-- the answer must of course be, that
there are people here who indeed follow TRC.
----------------
I myself have been wrong on the stock many, many times. Won't stop me from
giving an opinion now though -g- .

There are three significant issues with TRC,imo, and they don't relate to the
determination of intrinsic value of the stock. The first issue is will the
intrinsic assets be realized? The second is how long must an investor wait for
a payoff? And the third is how should an investor play this stock now?

A current concern apparently is related to the electricity issue facing
California. The way TRC might work with Calpine to get generating facilities,
installing them, etc. I say that that is not necessarily the only problem. I'm
not understanding why water isn't a significant issue. For example we have
Newhall Land (NHL - also a big landholder developer in Southern Cal.) taking a
drubbing when the Cal. Public Utilities denied them a request to develop some
of their properties that they were extremely close to starting. An unexpected
surprise to investors. (NHL subsequently exited these properties, and the stock
recovered.) While Mr. Whitman says TRC does have water, that, imo, is to be
determined. And I realize that those here who follow water stocks might have
better information -- but that NHL issue really was an unexpected surprise to
the market, so why can't TRC be subject to a similar negative surprise in
future as well?

I'll just go ahead and say I don't know when the intrinsic value of this stock
will be realized. But unless there's more positive development news
forthcoming, investors had better be prepared for a wait. You say 2003 to
realize maximize value. I don't know what that means, but for now, this stock
trades on Mr. Whitman's recommendation of the stock, media writeups that say
the stock is undervalued, and importantly, on the market upward evaluation of
California land companies in general (e.g. NHL is at a high also.) In any case,
my opinion is that these land plays take much longer to work out than expected,
and investors had better be prepared to wait for a payoff.

On the one hand we have companies (e.g. ALCO most recently) where the payoff is
very sudden. (that is, not following stepwise as the properties are developed
and sold). That is one reason to buy the stock now and be in it.
OTOH, imo, given that there's still a possibility, if not likelihood, that
negative announcements might also drop Tejon stock, my suggestion is that
potential investors remain on the sidelines for a better price than the current
28+. Mr. Whitman cleaved his large position from the LA Times(?) at under
market, about 13 if I recall, and he was buying at 18 or higher -- and now also
at 24 someone said. But since Mr. Whitman's big buy and the media write up of
it, there've been at least several times to buy TRC at under 22, even under 20.

Furthermore, TRC is not the only land developer selling under intrinsic value
and working to decrease that disparity. There are at least several others. In
spite of what Mr. Whitman says ("diversification is a surrogate for knowledge,
control and/or price consciousness"), I say that in this area (land
developers), for most investors, the risk/reward profile favors owning a
package of these companies. After all, TRC is subject to changing state and
local zoning regulations, supply/demand in a questionable economy, and
geographic peculiarities (like earthquakes). All stuff that can surprise even
the most knowledgeable TRC investor. Anyone buying Tejon ought to consider
buying it as part of a package of such companies. As examples only, CTO (Mr.
Buffett's - or his rep's - pick in Florida) and CDX (in Northern California),
both of which I have, and JOE in Florida (which I do not), and/or perhaps
development REITs or real estate service companies.

KAB.... I bought some of this today.

The way I figure it, the spun-off company will be paying $1.20/sh. dividend. If
I buy 300 KAB for $6.80/share, then I get 100 of the new spin-off and therefore
get $120 in dividends, which works out to about 6% on the total investment. If
I assume that the old KAB shares will drop by 25% after the spin-off, then I'll
have 300 shares worth about $4.50/share; and I'll have 100 shares of a company
paying $1.20/share dividend....let's see, at 6% rate of return, that would make
the new spin-off worth $20/share ($1.20/.06).

Right now I get a nicely positive free cash flow for KAB, a NetNet per their
10K numbers of $3.33/share; A book value of $4.97/share; a price to free cash
flow of 4. That provides me with a margin of safety and a decent potential for
appreciation of share price.

Nice find!

Spent a few minutes trying to understand KAB. Too tough for me to see it.

Buying 300 sh. KAB @ 6.80 ea. = $2040 invested.

Dividend, assuming it is maintained, = @ .3/quarter = $120/yr. for the 100
shares received. This thing is going to be a limited partnership, and dividends
on l.p.'s are, imo, usually more generous than with standard companies. On the
one hand, gas pipelines have apparently garnered market attention because of
energy shortages, including pipeline shortages in some areas, so this argues
for a high price to dividend valuation for the company (like 6%). OTOH, some
pipeline companies (I don't understand enough to know which other pipeline
companies would be comparable to Kaneb's, if any are) are selling at 7 or 8%
yields. An attraction of l.p.s is that such companies pay out most(?) of their
income to the partners (stockholders)in the form of dividends which make l.p's
usually a dividend play (But not always.) If I am understanding these things
right.

Given there's no history of dividend consistency or dividend growth with Kaneb,
I go with a higher dividend yield guess -- 7.5%. That means I guess the 100
shares will trade at 100 X 1.2/.075 = $1600.

Net income for the other parts of the business was .373M for the quarter.

That figure is after interest expense which I assume relates only to that
specific part of the business, since I am assuming that because the pipeline
line numbers are reported as discontinued operations, the pipeline interest
expense numbers are included in the discontinued operations figure).
Annualizing that net income figure (I am on dangerous ground here), and
dividing by the 31M shares outstanding, that gets a per share figure of $.05.
Arbitrarily giving that figure a p/e of 25 would have each share at $1.25.
There are 300 shares in the investment, so that is $375.

My take then is $2040 invested gets 375+1600.

Looks to me like people on the Yahoo KAB thread all seem to see better prices
and maybe a better or more accurate way of analyzing the stock. I have to defer
to people who've spent more time analyzing the deal and know the company
better. So I will assume I'm in error somewhere along the line. But for now,
I'll have to pass on the stock.

Paul...

KAB...."earnings" is why I have moved to the Statement of Cash Flows. Although
reported "earnings" were about 14 cents, the Cash From Operations(CFO) was
$1.86/share.

The Change in cash when adjusted for non-operational, discretionary uses of
cash in the Financing and Investment areas gives me a Free Cash Flow of
$1.69/share. This is what I use instead of "earnings".

For me, it is the money that can be taken off the table without harming the
business model that I want to use to determine if the price for that cash flow
offers any margin of safety.

In order to earn $1.69 safely, I would have to have $37.55 invested in a CD at
4.5% today or, using my 6% figure from before, I would have to have $28.16
invested. A CD offers me no potential for appreciation of the asset other than
the interest paid.

I look at the price of the stock of KAB at $6.80/share and say that it is
earning over 4 times the CD rate (28.16/6.80), so no matter how it re-allocates
its assets through spin-offs, the underlying fundamentals offer a margin of
safety (for me), with an interesting possibility for appreciation.

the company does not comment on rumor, and will not comment specifically on the

It's very tough to figure out all of the numbers on this Kaneb deal. Your
figures look accurate to me.

I listened to the conference calls on Kaneb's website. I couldn't access the
March 2001 call, but the call prior (I believe November 2000) stresses that the
firm: 1) is doing extremely well, and 2) the numbers don't reflect the strength
of the business due to the restructuring.

It was an interesting (albeit a little old) call and contains statements
indicating management confidence in the firm's value. (What else would they
say? But it was a good call, nevertheless.)

Started an exploratory position in The Ackerley Group.

This is yet another in the genre of "family-controlled 'media and

The bet here is that AK management will continue its innovative ways of running
their tv operations and will also continue to develop (and appropriately
harvest) investments within its business segments.

I cannot quantify the intrinsic value of the company and am unable to
adequately defend the stock as a value play at its current price. Maybe it
might be a GARP. Maybe not even that. Ergo my purchase as exploratory only. I'm
looking to try to hold for two years or more.

There hasn't been much if any discussion of these media-entertainment stocks on
this thread in quite a while. So I'll guess there won't be much interest in AK
now. Perhaps properly so. For me though, I am buying AK now in order to add to,

Just wanted to update LPAC - on Friday they announced an 825,000 share buyback
from their largest outside shareholder, the same company that tried to buy LPAC
for $4 last fall (the offer was rejected). LPAC used $2 million of its $7
million cash hoard to buy the shares at 20% under market price. The outside
holder could not have sold so many shares without knocking the price back under
$2 given the low liquidity.

I consider this buyback an excellent step to increase LPAC shareholder value;
it will improve EPS numbers in coming quarters and still leaves LPAC with
plenty of cash if they should need it. And the potential "overhang" from
someone selling those shares in the open market is now gone.

I am waiting for updates on the LPAC annual meeting held late Friday. The next
catalyst for the stock should be an expected contract for the Screen Actors
Guild by June 30.

LPAC is making all the right moves, IMHO. The move up to fair value at $5-6 is

I basically agree with you on LPAC. However, for the seller to have taken $2.50
(instead of holding, or trying to acquire at a price above $4) you have to
either assume they needed the money for some other purpose or that they did not
see the long term prospects as extraordinary. Nobody with any brains sells a
future $5-10 stock for $2.50 unless he has to. Therefore, while I agree it
enhances shareholder value, it MIGHT be a negative comment on the longer term
outlook, and it IS a negative point on the possibility of a takeover..

I disagree on the takeover possibility being worse - with all the shares
accounted for (in retail hands or management now) an acquirer does not have to
worry about what might happen to a single block of 10% of LPAC's shares hanging
over their head.

This is one company I have looked into thoroughly. I don't expect huge growth

I'd be tickled to see Mr. Buffett buy this one, if it fit his criteria. Would
really look forward to seeing a picture of him swigging a Corona with his

For a 20-30% play, assuming that the stock continues its good ways, it
certainly could happen (STZ should be able to meet analysts' earnings growth
expectations, imho). For me, STZ stock price is relatively high now compared to
where it's been. While I have been sorry I never bought the stock when I've

My Interpretation of Kaneb Valuation:

1) Kaneb Services; 6/17/01 Stock Symbol: KAB
Kaneb will begin trading as Xanser after the spinoff.

2) Kaneb Pipe Line Partnership; Stock Symbol: KPP
KPP's valuation has been as low as $20.88 (1993). KPP has a safety factor of
"1" by Value Line. KPP's yield has ranged from 7.7% to 9.4%. KPP's dividend has
been @ $2.20 for years 1993 - 1995; $2.25 for 1996; $2.45 for 1997; $2.60 for
1998; $2.75 for 1999.

3) Kaneb Services LLC Shares; Stock Symbol: KSL WI
KSL will begin trading 6/18/01

4) Xanser Corporation; Stock Symbol: XNR WI
Xanser Corporation will be a growth-oriented technology and technical services
business.

5) KAB will be added to the Russell 3000 on July 1, 2001.

6)KSL WI dividend per share: $1.20 per year (although a partnership is not a
true dividend, it is still a payment; a partnership's payment includes a return
on capital)

KSL will begin trading June 18, 2001. KAB shareholders will receive 1-share of
KSL WI for every 3-shares of KAB owned. The KAB record date is June 20, 2001
and the KSL shares will be distributed June 29, 2001.

KSL will be a LLC owning the following assets: 1) 5.1 million shares of KPP
(currently trading @ $37.00), and 2) Kaneb Services wholly owned petroleum
product marketing subsidiary. KSL will act as the general partner interest of
the pipeline.

KAB's current market valuation:
31.3 million shares @ $7.03 = $220.039 million

KSL's 5.1 million shares of KPP value:
5.1 million KPP shares @ $37.00 = $188.7 million

KSL's petroleum product marketing subsidiary
valuation: unknown

Assume as of June 15's price, 300-shares of KAB are purchased at a cost of
$2120.

1) This transaction will create a shareholder with:

a) a $120 dividend (which I believe is conservative & secure based upon
listening to the March conference call -- during the Q&A); this $120 yield
equates to a 5.66% yield on the $2120 cost.

b) ownership of 100-shares of KSL

c) ownership of 300-shares of XNR

2) Assuming that KSL trades at a low yield of 7.7% (from a historical
perspective), then a 7.7% yield results in a stock price of $15.58. This also
assumes $0 value for the marketing segment.

3) XNR, based upon quarterly results and conference call comments, is in a
growth market with above-average (my words) business prospects. XNR will also
be impacted by the inclusion to the Russell 3000 effective July 1, 2001.

My impression of the conference call is that investors can recognize a
significant appreciation in value with the above actions. Management is focused
upon creating and recognizing shareholder value.

Listen to the conference calls @ http://www.kaneb.com . Please let me know if
their are any errors in the above numbers and assumptions. Tomorrow will
provide an initial value for KSL.

re: xnr, ksl. I look at it this way:

I will just have to assume I am "not attuned mentally" (-g-) to figure out this
deal properly. This is a reasonable assumption given that I'm not thorough or
expert in my investigation here, and that so many apparently knowledgeable
Yahoo KAB posters do believe this is an undervalued situation. (I state this
with respect for those posters - no slighting/disparaging/sneering intended.)

I ask myself then, what is the best play here? If the individual stocks, XNR &
KSL, start to trade above the price they're selling now for joined, sell
either/or or both for an overall profit? Is the "significant appreciation" to
be realized when these stocks start trading or are investors figuring that
they'll have to hold either or both stocks for a quarter or two or more to see
how earnings (and/or dividends) are? Is the growth expected to be in XNR
primarily? If so, why not buy just the XNR when-issued and forgot about the
dividend-rich KSL. If someone were after the dividend, wouldn't they be likely
to dump their newly-received XNR shares, depressing the XNR price initially?
It's all too tough for me, but we shall see how this interesting deal works
out!

Anybody here know when the insiders' XNR options will be (or were) set and at
what price? That might be a clue as to how to play the stock.

Dale, you may not like your pick of SCZ anymore, but it looks like it might
work okay for me. I've started a small position today. As you know, SCZ is a
multi-faceted real estate company with many opportunities to do deals and
perhaps increase (and realize) shareholder value. Which they seem to be trying
to do.

Since they own substantial positions in several REITs but they themselves pay
no dividend to stockholders, it's easy for me to buy this stock in a regular
account. As opposed to typical REITs where I want to weigh the dividend
(return-of-capital component vs. taxable component) before I decide if the REIT
ought to be bought in a tax-sheltered account or not. However, since there's no
dividend, we really have to rely on management to manage cash flows for the
stockholders' benefit. Although SCZ is diversified, I'd guess there could be a
lower floor to the stock (than a dividend-paying REIT) and also less investor
interest in the company because of this lack of dividend.

Another negative is that REITs seem (to me) to be popular now and up in price.
I am buying SCZ now and hoping I'm not buying at the top of a cycle.

D.I.Y. Home Warehouse, Inc. Announces Closure of Remaining Locations

CLEVELAND, Jun 19, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- D.I.Y. Home Warehouse, Inc.
(DIYH) today announced that it will voluntarily close its remaining six stores
in Cleveland, Eastlake, Elyria, Warren, Akron and Ashtabula, Ohio. Inventory
close-out sales at all locations are scheduled to begin later this week and are
expected to be completed by the end of August.

The Company made the difficult decision after a review of updated projections
indicated that the Company would not be able to operate profitably on a
long-term basis given the continued competitive pressures from national
warehouse retailers in its markets. In addition to selling its existing
merchandise inventories, furniture and fixtures, the Company will actively
market the real estate of its closed locations which may result in the sale,
lease, sublease or redevelopment of some or all of the properties.

The Company currently expects that the net proceeds from the disposition of
merchandise inventories will exceed its total outstanding obligations. The
Company will evaluate its existing and future financial obligations and all
valid claims against the Company will be honored. After evaluating the results
of the sale of merchandise inventories, furniture and fixtures and the sale,
lease, sublease or redevelopment of its real estate, the Company intends to
determine how it can maximize shareholder value. The Company intends to retain
an investment banker to assist it in making such a determination. D.I.Y. Home
Warehouse, Inc. would like to thank its customers, associates, stockholders and
vendors for their support and dedication to the Company throughout its sixteen
year history and regrets that it must now exit the marketplace.

The statements contained in this news release may include certain predictions
and projections that may be considered forward-looking statements under
securities law. These statements involve a number of important risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including,
but not limited to, the matters described in the Company's most recent Form
10-K, the Company's ability to generate sufficient proceeds from inventory
sales to retire all debt, the performance of the retail and home improvement
industry, as well as other economic, competitive and technological factors
involving the Company's operations, markets, products and prices.

ALLC/ALD - I was rather concerned that the premium they paid for SDP didn't
make sense. Talked to IR and was told essentially that ALLC [now ALD] thought
Hillman group was a real gem and would probably polish it up a bit while
selling underperforming elements of SDP and end up with something that's worth
well more than what they paid...to be sold or spun when market conditions are
favorable. They're more familiar with SDP than I could be since they looked at
it when the lent money. Looking at the breakout numbers in the SEC doc's
indicates they may have a case. Here's ALD and some screw companies for anyone
that wants to take a look:

any thoughts on GCW?

Gerber Childrenswear, closed today at $6.65

On the plus side, the valuation seems low and their
finances seem sound ($2.00/share cash).
Technically, the stock is also acting well.

On the minus side, they seem to be 60% controlled by
a Citibank investment group, so possibly they are
not too concerned with their public shareholders.
For example, I don't see an "investor relations" section
on their website. Also, their sales have been declining
a bit recentlly, although they seem to be managing
their costs as well...

Any thoughts on AGR/A or PHSY

AGR/A, being in the center of the telecom vortex has recently gone from 9 to 5.
unlike it's former parent LU, it has no debt and will certainly survive. the
word is that of all the fiber which has been laid, only 2.5% has been "lit". as
that fiber gets lit, the optical equipment makers will see the biz. this spin
out (usually bullish) is cheaper at 2X sales than its competitors. i own some
and am contemplating more. thoughts?

PHSY (an HMO)looks cheap on all traditional metrics. it has been hit
dramatically as it struggles to change its biz model to hospital risk based
contracts. UNH owns 17% of stock, management owns 7%, LT debt is not onerous,
seems like very good risk/reward. i don't own this one yet. thoughts?

I have been swapping my position in BMY for a position in NVS. NVS is a better
value right now, IMO. NVS has the major patent expirations behind themselves,
while BMY has major obstacles in the near term future: Glucophage, Buspar,
Pravachol etc. BMY has everything riding on Vanlev, and will not meet growth
targets, if this drug fails. NVS has a similar valuation and financial strength
but much less risk.

Jhelmers: yes, PHSY discussed here recently. At least a couple of us have
positions in it. To me, the stock's low p/sales indicates there might be some
potential for stock price improvement IF PHSY can bring some of their revenue
to the profit line. Hard for me to see this company going out of business -
provides services people need. Still, just because I see them coming out of
this okay, it's just an unsupported guess and doesn't mean they will.

I started my position at 19+, added at 17+, and will add more if stock drops to
15+.

AGRA looks like it might work out too. In an unpopular sector right now, is
that right? For me, it's too new a company (i.e. short trading history) and too
technical a company for me to understand enough to start with a position now. I
haven't looked at it as a spin off candidate. So I defer to others who know the
sector and AGRA's products and prospects and who can make an evaluation of its
stock price to intrinsic value.

Thanks, Spekulatius. I'm starting to build up a small position in NVS again.

I've also become very concerned about my BMY and other pharma stocks (MRK). Of
course this is exacerbated by the drop these stocks are experiencing now. There
isn't a day that goes by, that I don't consider selling some of my BMY. Part of
that is because BMY has come to occupy a large, outsize position in one of my
major portfolios. While I'm happy I'm net positive in this long-term holding,
it's psychologically off-putting (and negative to the portfolio balance)to have
a one point drop in BMY stock price be more hurtful than a 50% or double is
helpful that occurs in another, but much smaller, stock position.

I've been going through my portfolios to categorize stocks I own by length of
time I've held them. Stocks held for 5 or more years, 8 or more years, 10 or
more years. I'd like to show that these stocks are profitable investments, and
that those profits were obtained over the course of several years. It's because
I get tired of so many trading threads on SI and because I see the lack of
patience people everywhere seem to have with the stocks they buy. Even value
investors. (And I'm not immune either.)

Going through my files, it seems I'm in the black on every stock I've held for
five years or more. But I have to give up. I'm not so sure that these stocks
are profitable for me when I take account of the time value of money. Some of
these stocks have had years when they've had no price appreciation. (Some
though have paid dividends which I might consider as an offset.) Some have
cratered, and even though I'm price-wise ahead, I should've (ah hindsight) sold
at much higher prices when I had the chance. (e.g. Sun Microsystems).

Also, I see now there's a bias problem, in that the loser stocks I bought, I
likely have taken my losses on and sold. So the point I would've liked to make,
- profit not by trading but by holding on to stocks for long term gains - is
diluted or obviated by the fact I likely got rid of losers somewhere along the
line (maybe after several years).

At least you held the winners and sold the losers - many investors do the

every time I turn around, from family and friends and clients.

You look people in the eye and say "Of course, you can, just put in a sell
order" and they think you are nuts.

Anyway, since you are dabbling the healthcare world, take a look at MIMS. I
have a small position from just over 6.

http://biz.yahoo.com/p/m/mims.html

I can't decide if this was a not-so-great idea or a stock that just needs some
patience to turn around and deliver a profit. It fits my basic criteria of low
price-sales and positive cash flow though margins are lethally small in their
niche.

Management raised estimates in April with a very upbeat report:

Anyone think that somewhere in here GLW is presenting an opportunity to buy a

below long term intrinsic value?

On AGRA is that company fully divested from LU? If not and LU were to go under
there would surely be some fall out, and possibly even if there is now just a
close business relationship. I would need to be persuaded not to wait for a LU
bankruptcy to consider this and, if one never comes, so be it.

Paul, I agree that BMY is fairly risky right now. NVS is valued about the same
but carriers much less risk. CHIR is not well managed and overvalued, at
current prices.
If I'd invest in an established biotech, I would prefer BGEN which has a much
stronger management and science but also carriers risk due to Avonex
competition.
In principle, I like drug stocks and biotechs, since they are anticyclical.
Besides NVS, I would be interested in MRK in the low sixties. MRK has patent
expiration problems as well but they do have a pipeline. What I do not like is
that they skimp on R&D to make their earning numbers.
Since I believe we are going into a recession, I am not touching the retailers
with a ten foot pole. Don't like truckers either.

I am overweighted biotechs microcaps with significant cash on hand and a good
leverage. I bought DDDP, DPII and NRGN recently. ALL these are risky for
themselves but as a basked, they offer fairly good potential at reasonable
downside.

I think they have no mutual funds, but they must run a lot of institutional

jhelmers, re: IM & TECD. They have in common that they are both computer
resellers - a not-so-attractive business right now (apparently). Which might
mean now is just the time to buy these stocks. Still, to me, both stocks look
too expensive at current prices.

Looking at TECD, I was surprised to see it's a $5 billion revenue company and
on the Fortune 500. I like that they are broadly diversified within several
aspects of IT. The size and diversification in a technical sector make it
difficult for me to analyze the company though. Using just a rote model I have
(based on TECD financial numbers over past five years and a capitalization
rate), I figure fair value for the stock is maybe $35, maybe $40 if they can
maintain current ROE performance. (Not saying my model is correct or even that
it's workable - but it sometimes gives me a point from which to anchor an
evaluation). Given that the stock's $30-31, and the price has bounced around,
I'd be interested in TECD if I could get it closer to its lows (near 25).

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., June 26, 2001 (PRIMEZONE) -- Moore-Handley, Inc. (Nasdaq:MHCO

the Company has purchased approximately 163,000 shares.

The Company's Chairman, William Riley, noted that the Company's unaudited
earnings through May continued their strong rebound and that unaudited book
value per share was just under $7 as compared to a recent market price of
between $1-$1.50.
