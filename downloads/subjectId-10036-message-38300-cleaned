Sold some October $10 covered calls to lock in some recent gains and the next
dividend payment. I may be giving away some of the potential upside but if the
stock is called away, it becomes a source of funds for other compelling buys.

Madharry - re AAB.TO - you would think that any holding company with liquid
assets and a 50% discount to NAV would buy their own $ notes for 50c as much as
feasible. The fact that they don't do that tells me that they don't have
shareholder enrichment on their agenda (I am sure management is not that math
deficient).

FWIW, I don't think they should be blamed too much for the decline in NAV since
4/30 - they own a bunch if illiquid stocks, so it's impossible to exit at a
moments notice.

I'd rather hold something at a 20% discount with a shareholder friendly and

steel-price hikes for the period between April and September, which could lead
to significant cost increases for Japanese firms, according to a report
Wednesday. The Nikkei business daily reported that Toyota has agreed to pay up
to an additional 20,000 yen ($219) per ton compared to fiscal 2009, which would
return the steel price "to the record high reached in fiscal 2008." The deal
would likely serve as a benchmark for similar dealings between smaller steel

I dont blame you. I think the other side of the coin if you read the press

cleanup by financing these start ups and bringing them public. management rakes
it in from all sides, but i expect that ultimately aab shareholders will
benefit from increases in book value and the assets are really cheap now. As I
said I believe crocodile gold is potentially highly undervalued and aab is
presumably holding long term options and warrants on this as well. This is a
long term holding for me and Im prepared to be patient. not one of my largest
plays but not one of my smallest either. Btw if you know of any particularly
shareholder friendly managements let me know. they seem few and far between
these days. One of the things I love about MFCAF management is that since ive
been an investor there have been spin outs and shareholder distributions, as
supposed to say scumbag management like IDT who years ago could have enriched
shareholders but instead screwed them and enriched management instead, or
edv.to management which somehow cajoled investors into buying their private
investment bank instead of paying out a juicy dividend.

re HFCB - this stock screams inefficient market. Secondary at steep discount,
Bank from a dinky town that nobody knows about, probably half the shareholders

I had this stock on my watchlist because it screened well in terms of value and
asset quality metrics (per FDIC website). The secondary brought the stock down
from 12$ to 9$ and will leave a well capitalized bank, imo. So it's now or
never to get in.

Tangible Book after secondary should be around 12.5-13$/share. I don't know if
they can keep the dividend - they will probably pay back the 18.4M$ in TARP
money, so that will save some preferred dividend payment, so it could well work
out. Either way it's cheap enough for me to make a bet. Target would be
12$/share in a year or so but maybe I take 10$ in a few days if it comes to

You are making an inference about Resource America (REXI) based on Resource

.03.

REXI ($3.75/sh) has a tangible bv of $7.04 (according to SI)
RSO ($6.03/sh) has a tangible bv of $5.79/sh (according to SI)

I've had my fill of both companies and the ceo: I followed Leon Cooperman into

HFBC,

I'm in on this one. On the negative side, I wish I could analyze banks better
and their large commercial real estate exposure scares me a bit. And if I were
shareholder going into the offering, I'd be steamed seeing the company issue
stock at such a cheap price.

However, the artificially low pricing from the stock offering, the 0.12
upcoming dividend (Ex 6/28/2010), profitability through the downturn, location
in a fairly bubble-less region, and the discount to tangible book are too much
for me to ignore.

I could be wrong, but when the overhang of flippers from the stock offering
gets taken out, I think this could rally nicely. And a 0.12 dividend within two
weeks certainly doesn't hurt.

Thanks!

The OTS put some restrictions on the company with respect to its commercial

Effective April 30, 2010, the Board of Directors of each of HopFed Bancorp,
Inc. (the "Company") and Heritage Bank (the "Bank"), the Company's federal
savings bank subsidiary, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU")
with the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS"). An MOU with regulatory
authorities is an informal administrative agreement that is not published or
publicly available and is generally used when regulatory authorities believe
that circumstances warrant a milder form of action than a formal supervisory
action, such as a formal written agreement or order.

Under the Company MOU, among other things, the Company has agreed to the
following: (1) the Company will neither accept nor request that the Bank pay
any dividends or make any capital distributions, or commit to pay dividends or
make other capital distributions, without prior OTS approval; (2) the Company
will not declare or pay any dividends or make other capital distributions, or
commit to pay dividends or make other capital distributions, without prior OTS
approval; provided, however, that this restriction will not apply to dividends
on currently outstanding shares of preferred stock issued to and held by the
United States Department of the Treasury and obligations in connection with
currently outstanding trust preferred securities if any such dividend or
capital distribution does not cause the Bank's capital levels to fall below a
Tier 1 core capital ratio of 8% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 12%;
and
(3) the Company will not, directly or indirectly, incur, issue, renew, or
rollover any debt without prior OTS approval. At March 31, 2010, the Bank's
Tier 1 core capital ratio was 8.02%, and its total risk-based capital ratio was
13.25%.

Under the Bank MOU, among other things, the Bank has agreed to the following:
(1) the Bank will not declare or pay any dividends or make other capital
distributions, or commit to pay dividends or make other capital distributions,
without prior OTS approval; (2) the Bank will adopt a concentration risk
reduction plan to reduce the outstanding balance of commercial real estate
loans relative to core capital and the allowance for loan losses; and (3) the
Bank will not increase brokered deposits without prior OTS approval.

In addition, the MOUs identify actions, policies and procedures to be taken and
adopted by the Board of Directors and management of the Company and the Bank,
as appropriate, to ensure maintenance of adequate liquidity, monitor and report
compliance with the MOUs and certain applicable regulations, reduce the level
of classified assets, and correct certain deficiencies and weaknesses
identified by the OTS.

The MOUs will remain in effect until modified or terminated by the OTS. The
Company and the Bank do not expect the actions and limitations required by the
MOUs to change their business strategy in any material respect.

The Board of Directors and management of each of the Company and the Bank have
taken various actions to comply with the terms and conditions of the MOUs, and
will continue to take all actions believed to be necessary for compliance. The
Board and management will continue to work closely with the OTS in order to
comply with the terms and conditions of the MOUs and are committed to
addressing and resolving any and all issues presented in the MOUs.

I bought VOD a couple of months ago because of Einhorn's comments on the
Verizon Wireless dividend.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26352956

From an article in the WSJ, it looks like Verizon is warming up to the idea.

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704122904575314751026236146.html?
od=WSJ_hps_LEFTWhatsNews

Verizon Wireless might start paying a dividend in 2012, providing parents
Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC with a rich source of cash.

The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers has seen stellar growth and
profits over the past few years. But the massive amounts of cash generated has
gone primarily toward paying down debt, with Vodafone in particular getting
little monetary benefit.

John Killian, Verizon's chief financial officer, first suggested the
possibility of a dividend in a Thursday interview with Bloomberg. He said the
door was open for a payout once Verizon Wireless finishes paying down its debt
in 2011. A Verizon spokesman confirmed the comments.

Majority owner Verizon's willingness for a payout underscores the growing need
for both Verizon and Vodafone to draw upon Verizon Wireless's cash flow for
their own needs, and provides a firmer target for when it might materialize.

"While [Mr. Killian's] comment falls short of a definitive commitment, we
nevertheless believe the remark is significant, inasmuch as this is the first
time, to our knowledge, that Verizon has publicly put a specific date on
potential distributions," said Robin Bienenstock, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein LLC.

It's not the first time Mr. Killian hinted at a dividend. He told investors in
late April during a quarterly conference call that the company would look at
the issue again in 2011. "It's an event off into the future," he said.

For Vodafone, which owns a 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, the lack of a
dividend has been a growing concern for investors. Verizon Wireless, which was
created from the merger of wireless assets owned by then-Bell Atlantic and
Vodafone, paid a dividend between 2000 and 2005 but ceased the payout in 2006.

Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said late last year that the company
had to resolve its situation with Verizon Wireless.

"The U.S. is clearly the most important thing that we have, because it's 37% of
our [earnings per share] and 0% of our cash flow, so it's a pretty asymmetrical
type of situation," Mr. Colao said in November during an investor conference.

Vodafone declined to comment on Mr. Killian's comments.

Ivan Seidenberg, chief executive of Verizon, which owns a 55% stake in Verizon
Wireless, has said he will only consider a dividend once the venture's debt has
been paid off.

The move would represent a coup for Vodafone, which would see its free cash
flow increase by an estimated 30%, Mr. Bienenstock said, adding the company's
stock currently trades as if it has no stake in Verizon Wireless.

Verizon's stock trades lower than rival AT&T Inc. because Wall Street already
assumes an eventual cash payout to Vodafone, according to Auriga USA LLC
analyst Chandan Sarkar.

"We believe investors may choose to value Verizon at a discount as they better
recognize the implications of Vodafone owning a 45% stake in the portion of
Verizon's business that generates 70% of its cash flow today," he said.

But cash from the wireless business would secure both Verizon and Vodafone's
commitments to pay a dividend to their shareholders.

A dividend would also dash speculation that the two giants would merge in a
trans-Atlantic deal, analysts say. Mr. Seidenberg has said he sees little
reason to merge with Vodafone. But it does keep the door open to Verizon
eventually buying out Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless, something Mr.
Seidenberg has regularly said he was willing to do.

re CTBI - it's an OK bank but what is cheap about a regional bank trading at
1.5x tangible book an 14x earnings? Those are a dime in a dozen.

CTBI is 4* rated but I expect HFCB to be the same after the capital rise and
HFCB should trade at <10x earnings and <0.8x tangible book, after the offering
with capital for expansion to spare.

CTBI is roughly 10x larger in size than HFCB and I found that you pay a large
premium nowadays for liquidity and size with regional banks. I think this will
provide a powerful incentive for takeover of smaller banks going forward. I
wouldn't mind some takeouts at 50% premiums at all.

Hopfed's rating is C (not great but far better than D-) before the capital
raise.

FWIW, I would not touch BANR even after a capital raise. Same for FRBK which
tries to raise capital too (FRBK was a rejected merger partner - another red
flag).

The safe and sound ratings are a great tool to get a quick and dirty look at
the safety of an institution (Safe and sound did not work right now so i went
to Thestreet Weiss ratings. There are gobs of banks available far below
tangible book, only few of those I consider worthy of investment. BANR would
not even pass a 2min smell test. I think HFBC while not without risk represents
a far better risk reward.

re OTS - yes I agree with you that the OTS restrictions are a negative. I also
became aware of this this weekend when going through the 424B. While they would
have made the capital hurdle by a small margin, i do think that this is the
underlying reason for the secondary, because they rather raise capital then
forgo the dividend.
I is also noteworthy that the OTS did not find more severe issues, like loans
that need to be restated as nonperforming or such. I have seen that too with
some banks local to me that I follow with some interest, the OTS has apparently
gone tougher in their audits and some banks I follow had so show substantial
restatements of their loan portfolio.

After the secondary, HFBC should be in decent shape, which is why I waited
until after the secondary is announced to get in.

Now that PSEC has cut its dividend and stock has fallen, maybe in future we'll
see good news rather than more bad as regards the company. I'm in for a few
shares as of today; will add more if stock drops further on no adverse news.

Persistent insider buying here, especially by Mr. J. Barry, Chair. and CEO, is
a positive for me.

I'm guessing a lot of value investors or bdc buyers have been hurt by this
stock now and in past (I'm one anyway), so reluctance of people to enter or
reenter may be a factor keeping the stock price down. A positive or negative,
I'll look at it as a positive---keeps entry price low.

Annualized new monthly distribution might be $1.21 or so, which would be about
12% on current stock price. Not sure what proportion will be return of capital.

Banks - thanks Spekulatius.

Those Weiss Ratings are very interesting. I agree that ratings which look
beyond a bank's stated balance sheet are critical. A couple of discussion
points and questions.

1. In some cases, BANR for example, the Weiss Ratings tell a very different
story than the book value, Tier 1 and other bank measures that are easily
available. Assuming the Weiss Ratings are objective, it points to severe and
intentional over-stating of assets in many cases. Since banks are highly
leveraged by nature, it doesn't take a lot of over-statement to create drastic
haircuts in book value.

2. Weiss' asset quality measures interest me muchly. I cannot find any
discussion of the methodology they use, but I assume they take the published
loan book (loans by region and by type of borrower/use) and apply expected loss
ratios on each category. I assume these loss ratios are based primarily on what
other banks have already reported or experienced. I have seen this type of
analysis done in bank stock analyst reports.

3. I would like to learn more on these matters. Banks are highly leveraged and
financial information from them is subjective, not factual. Therefore, all bank
stocks are highly speculative in my opinion.

4. It would be easier to find banks to short than banks to buy. One could look
for those banks whose Weiss Ratings diverge dramatically from the Tier 1 ratio
and see whether or not the market has recognized that.

re FRBK - now if you want to see a busted offering look at FRBK. Offering out
at 2$ and stock is already at 1.82$ - almost 10% below the price. Obviously
this dismal performance is a sign that the underwriter did not want to or could
not defend the offering price. This does not bode well for FRBK stock near
term.

This offering has warning signs all over -
1) FRBK is rated 1* (I believe by Safe and sound). This is a very low rating.
2) FRBK had a merger agreement with METR which METR decided to cancel. I
suppose they must have looked into FRBK books and did not like what they see.
Again a busted merger is another red flat. FRBK stock will continue to go down
most likely. At some point it might be an interesting candidate to pick up. For
me that price would be below 1.5$.

Peter - I assume the Weiss ratings just like the Bankrate Safe and Sound
ratings are performed using data from the FDIC database. The FDIC database
which is a great tool for bank investors, breaks down the income statement,
active, and passive side of the balance sheet in certain categories. For
example it is from the FDIC website, one can deduct things that are often
missing from earnings announcements like 30-89day lates, construction loans,
Non-performing asset ratio.

I know in fact that safe and sound uses the following criteria a) earnings, NPA
assets and 30-89 days late, Capital ratios (tangible and Tier 1 ratio I assume
and balance sheet liquidity. Those ratios are all important and not just the
Tier 1 ratio. So i like the safe and sound rating for a quick evaluation. they
have some problems too (sometimes updated a little late_ or they also take into
account preferred shares because they look at the soundness from a depositor
perspective but still, for a 2 min look, Safe and sound ratings are hard to
beat.

FWIW, BANR Safe and sound rating is 2** with a decline bias. HFBC (Heritage
Bank) has a 3* rating with no bias. now add to this 30M$ in capital and we are
looking at a strong 3* or even a 4* bank at <0.8TBV, 10X earnings. this looks
better to me than the banks that Barron touts but what do I know...

China scraps commodity export tax rebates
By Leslie Hook in Hong Kong
Published: June 22 2010 19:34 | Last updated: June 22 2010 19:34
China announced on Tuesday that it was removing export tax rebates for key
commodities, including some steel exports. The news was likely to soothe
trading partners such as the US and the EU who have both attacked China’s steel
export subsidies.

Export rebates will be scrapped for some steel products, including hot rolled
coil, as well as other products such as corn starch, fertilisers, glass goods,
rubber goods and medicine. The new policy came as China’s steelmakers struggled
with the potential effects of renminbi revaluation, which would make steel
exports less competitive if the currency were to appreciate.

Spekulatius:

I believe Weiss does apply their own loss assumptions on a bank's loan
portfolio, above and beyond the reserving done by the bank for either SEC or
FDIC reporting.

The data presented by BANR in their FDIC reports do not differ appreciably from
those in the SEC reports - and neither data set creates the appearance of
needing a hugely dilutive stock offering.

The situation seems so odd to me in that the numbers in BANR's prospectus do
not indicate a need for capital, yet capital is being sought. To me, they are
admitting quite publicly that their loss reserves are insufficient.

BANR's share price is now approaching $2.00 as the time to price the offering
nears, yet book value is north of $10.

You pointed out that Weiss Ratings give BANR a D-. Therefore, Weiss must be
looking beyond the stated financials, which all of us must do. The Weiss
Ratings are a simple way to do that and I thank you for the education.

FWIW this is Banner Banks Safe and Sound report.

Equity is about 420M$, impaired loans ~240M$ but reserved only 93M$. They lost
more than ~40M$ last year. The main reason for the low rating. Oh and we have
630M$ in construction loans (a category with high losses in some cases).

expectations.

This is my first Bank "buy" (other than NYB) in years since I bought Washington

$0.18/share.

Hopefully, the assets disclosed by HFBC are accurate and their secondary
offering will provide them the capital cushion to slowly build their franchise.
I do like Paul's thinking that HFGC may benefit from the Balken shale build out
as some of that infrastructure money (as well as mineral right royalties) may
trickle into HFGC.

I plan to hold my few shares collecting the dividend and may consider selling

do dilutive stock raises all the time, and are generally perceived as not very

--- trying to fool investors by going to a monthly dividend and then not even
clearly acknowledging the dividend is being cut.

I am big on value, but I'd prefer a good management at a good price than
suspect management at a cheaper price. On the other hand, the Wall Street

The Third Depression
By PAUL KRUGMAN
Recessions are common; depressions are rare. As far as I can tell, there were
only two eras in economic history that were widely described as “depressions”
at the time: the years of deflation and instability that followed the Panic of
1873 and the years of mass unemployment that followed the financial crisis of
1929-31.

Neither the Long Depression of the 19th century nor the Great Depression of the
20th was an era of nonstop decline — on the contrary, both included periods
when the economy grew. But these episodes of improvement were never enough to
undo the damage from the initial slump, and were followed by relapses.

We are now, I fear, in the early stages of a third depression. It will probably
look more like the Long Depression than the much more severe Great Depression.
But the cost — to the world economy and, above all, to the millions of lives
blighted by the absence of jobs — will nonetheless be immense.

And this third depression will be primarily a failure of policy. Around the
world — most recently at last weekend’s deeply discouraging G-20 meeting —
governments are obsessing about inflation when the real threat is deflation,
preaching the need for belt-tightening when the real problem is inadequate
spending.

In 2008 and 2009, it seemed as if we might have learned from history. Unlike
their predecessors, who raised interest rates in the face of financial crisis,
the current leaders of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank
slashed rates and moved to support credit markets. Unlike governments of the
past, which tried to balance budgets in the face of a plunging economy, today’s
governments allowed deficits to rise. And better policies helped the world
avoid complete collapse: the recession brought on by the financial crisis
arguably ended last summer.

But future historians will tell us that this wasn’t the end of the third
depression, just as the business upturn that began in 1933 wasn’t the end of
the Great Depression. After all, unemployment — especially long-term
unemployment — remains at levels that would have been considered catastrophic
not long ago, and shows no sign of coming down rapidly. And both the United
States and Europe are well on their way toward Japan-style deflationary traps.

In the face of this grim picture, you might have expected policy makers to
realize that they haven’t yet done enough to promote recovery. But no: over the
last few months there has been a stunning resurgence of hard-money and
balanced-budget orthodoxy.

As far as rhetoric is concerned, the revival of the old-time religion is most
evident in Europe, where officials seem to be getting their talking points from
the collected speeches of Herbert Hoover, up to and including the claim that
raising taxes and cutting spending will actually expand the economy, by
improving business confidence. As a practical matter, however, America isn’t
doing much better. The Fed seems aware of the deflationary risks — but what it
proposes to do about these risks is, well, nothing. The Obama administration
understands the dangers of premature fiscal austerity — but because Republicans
and conservative Democrats in Congress won’t authorize additional aid to state
governments, that austerity is coming anyway, in the form of budget cuts at the
state and local levels.

Why the wrong turn in policy? The hard-liners often invoke the troubles facing
Greece and other nations around the edges of Europe to justify their actions.
And it’s true that bond investors have turned on governments with intractable
deficits. But there is no evidence that short-run fiscal austerity in the face
of a depressed economy reassures investors. On the contrary: Greece has agreed
to harsh austerity, only to find its risk spreads growing ever wider; Ireland
has imposed savage cuts in public spending, only to be treated by the markets
as a worse risk than Spain, which has been far more reluctant to take the
hard-liners’ medicine.

It’s almost as if the financial markets understand what policy makers seemingly
don’t: that while long-term fiscal responsibility is important, slashing
spending in the midst of a depression, which deepens that depression and paves
the way for deflation, is actually self-defeating.

So I don’t think this is really about Greece, or indeed about any realistic
appreciation of the tradeoffs between deficits and jobs. It is, instead, the
victory of an orthodoxy that has little to do with rational analysis, whose
main tenet is that imposing suffering on other people is how you show
leadership in tough times.

And who will pay the price for this triumph of orthodoxy? The answer is, tens
of millions of unemployed workers, many of whom will go jobless for years, and
some of whom will never work again.

Well the company prospects were good four years ago too, and nothing much

They probably picked up their shares at the secondary price of $9.00/share
since the 13G was filed the same day of the secondary off, June 16, 2010.

I guess you hold until the big boys decide to sell.

E-K_S - I think HFBC's secondary gas gone well. The offering price was defended
in a crummy market which is good. I like that hedge fund sees what I am seeing
and decided to get in as well.

I am somewhat overweight this stock (3-4% of my portfolios), which is high
given it's dinky nature. my plan is to peel some shares off, when HFBC bounces
of the lows (10-20%) and let the rest roll and trade around the core position
as I see fit.

For those that are interested SHBI has filed a S3. In think the shares will be
offered at 10-11$, probably close to 10$ based on prior experience. SHBI is a
little more liquid than HFBC, so the offering discount should be less. I think
if it prices below 11$, this is worth a shot too. I need to study the SEC files
and FDIC records first, my knowledge is a little dated - this looked like a
decent bank with somewhat of an asset quality problem a while ago.

thanks for the info . not on yahoo or the detour gold website yet:

* To sell 10.5 mln shares at C$24

* To use net proceeds for the Detour Lake gold project

June 28 (Reuters) - Canadian gold explorer Detour Gold Corp (DGC.TO: Quote)
said it would raise about C$252 million ($243.5 million) through a bought deal
financing to advance its Detour Lake gold project.

Detour Gold said BMO Capital Markets and TD Securities Inc are joint book
runners and the underwriters will buy 10.5 million shares for C$24 each, a 0.2
percent discount to Detour Gold's Friday closing price.

The underwriters will have an over allotment option of 1.6 million shares, for
additional gross proceeds of up to C$37.8 million.

The company expects to close the offering by July 19.

Shares of the company closed at C$24.48 Monday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
They touched C$24.94 earlier in the day, their highest level since 2008.
($1=1.035 CANADIAN DOLLAR)

I havent sold any shares in quite awhile. probably will keep what I have.

Paul Krugman Throws In Towel, Says We're Headed For Another Depression

Posted Jun 28, 2010 11:27am EDT by Henry Blodget in Recession, Banking,
Politics
Related: UDN, UUP, ^DJI, ^GSPC, ^DJI, GLD
For the last several months, Princeton professor Paul Krugman has become
increasingly agitated about what he feels is a disastrous mistake in the making
-- a sudden global obsession with "austerity" that will lead to spending cuts
in many nations in Europe and, possibly, the United States.

Krugman believes that this is exactly the same mistake we made in 1937, when
the country was beginning to emerge from the Great Depression. A sudden focus
on austerity in 1937, it is widely believed, halted four years of strong growth
and plunged the country back into recession, sending the unemployment rate
soaring again.

In Krugman's view, the world should keep spending now, to offset the pain of
the recession and high unemployment--and then start cutting back as soon as the
economy is robustly healthy again.

Those concerned about the world's massive debt and deficits, however, have
seized control of the public debate, and are scaring the world's governments
into cutting back.

Which fate is worse? It depends on your time frame.

Cutting back on spending now would almost certainly make the economy worse, at
least for the short run. Not cutting back on spending later, meanwhile (and
Congress has shown no ability to curtail spending), will almost certainly keep
us on a road to hell in a handbasket.

The White House's own budget projections show the deficit improving as a
percent of GDP to about -4% by 2013. After that, however, even the White House
doesn't think things will get much better. After a few years of bumping along
at about -4%, the deficit will begin to soar at the end of the decade. And
thanks to the ballooning costs of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social
Security--along with inflating interest payments from all the debt we're
accumulating--the White House expects the deficit to soar to a staggering -62%
of GDP by 2085.

What Krugman and his foes agree on is that that's no way to run a country. And
it's time we finally faced up to that.

In the meantime, we'll continue to fight about what to do in the near-term. And
Krugman thinks he has lost that war and we're headed for another Depression.

HFBC,

With divvie 0.12 in hand (just went Ex), I am inclined to play the large 9.00
HFBC bid on some of my shares. If market gets substantially worse, I sell into
the bid, if it improves substantially I bid just above.

If the 9.00 buyer(s) gets his/their fill and banks drop more, I think there is
a chance to buy this substantially cheaper. On the other hand, the bid is
looking very strong so far, so I could see a substantial rise on a bank rally.

Market down 268, time to buy stocks. I did anyway, making adds to these
positions:

EONGY. Euro might fall or fail; this broad-diversified utility won't collapse
though. (or so I am betting)

Ithaca Energy (IACAF). Sells below npv10. Recent additional reserves from its
Stella field. Stock is reported on by LoneClone at Bosco & Crossy thread:
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26603834&srchtxt=ithaca

XOM. 12-mo. low today

TOT. p/e; div yield.

PLND. ETF for Poland. Some PLND detail here:
http://etfdb.com/etf/PLND/fact-sheet/

New positions started:

Lubrizol, LZ. Forward low p/e. (No claim by me though that this is a value
stock at current price.) ROE is good now; in past few years it has not been.
(So, perhaps LZ good roe is not sustainable.) Small bet by me, stock will
recover here.

Breitburn Partners LP, BBEP. Distribution yield about 10% annualized based on
its recently restored distribution.

Positions stopped out of: Ha. None of course.

I bought back my position in ES today. Something metioned in their latest
investor presentation is that they are paying down their debt by forty million
a year. I also think the clean-up money will stay in the US budget as it is a
sure way of keeping US workers employed at the same time cleaning up the
environment.

Recently I bought PESI which is also in the same sector. Both stocks have high
barriers of entry. In the case of PESI, it is their patented methods of
remediation. With ES it is their LLRW site in Utah.

Hello, I see your rationale to cash out HFBC. I agree with you that HFBC could
fall further if the bookmakers gives up on supporting the stock. So far it has
held above the offering price, which I consider very positive, considering the
market conditions.

I also posted about WAIN, a bank microcap I bought in the dark days in Fall
2009, it's a 3 bagger for those I held onto (sold 1/2 at 9$).

It just reminds me that on days like this that things should turn around and a
good profit can be made for those of us who do their homework with these
microcap plays.

NRF might just be in runoff mode, depending on how things go. I have no clue
where common will go and I'd say prefs are somewhat risky, but still possibly
good deal. I hold large position in prefs and would add here if the position
was smaller. Caveat emptor though. ;)

HFBC,

I only sold a portion of my position. I am just trying to take advantage of
that wall at 9.00 to maximize return and minimize risk.

I actually loaded up more shares than normal because that I thought the wall my

Fitch Downgrades First Industrial's IDR to 'B+'; Watch Negative
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/fitch-downgrades-first-industrials-idr-to-b-wa
ch-negative-2010-06-29?reflink=MW_news_stmp

From the article:"...The Rating Watch Negative status reflects the company's
proximity to certain of its covenant compliance levels as well as uncertainty
as to whether it would suspend a preferred stock dividend. The company has
stated that if it is not required to pay preferred stock dividends to maintain
REIT status, it may elect to suspend some or all preferred stock dividends for
one or more fiscal quarters, which would aid compliance with the fixed charge
coverage covenant under its existing line of credit.

The Negative Rating Watch may be resolved in the event that the company
definitively addresses its covenant compliance...",

I continue to hold my entire lot of FR preferreds. Price has come down from a
high of $21.00/share (4/2010) to $16.50/share (about 20% correction). Only
about 16K shares sold over the last two days since the downgrade by Fitch. The
Preferred series went xdividend June 15, 2010 and presently yield 10.8% at
