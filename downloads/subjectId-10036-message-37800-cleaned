Craziness looks like it came from a "typo"...I love it when those wall street
guys let me fill some of my limit orders.

By Tiernan Ray
What caused the sell-off?

Well, consider this highly speculative, but here goes: One proprietary trader
at a major bank tells my colleague Steven Sears that “basket trading” at
Citigroup (C), meaning, the trading of groups of stocks that investors
structure on their own to resemble indices, caused the decline.

Speculation is that a trader wanted to sell $1 million notional of stocks and
instead entered $1 billion notional — a typo, in effect — and that that
triggered a sell-off in some stocks and some stocks traded to zero, such as
Accenture (ACN).

Steven has calls in to Citi but has received no comment yet.

A fund manager at a major money management house relates in an email this
afternoon that “Procter [& Gamble (PG)] and Accenture stocks had the huge hit.
Have heard massive program error by Citi. One of those trades where there were
likely three extra zeros added.”

In retrospect, looks to me like the day had three stages: Moving down (a

I've been buying throughout the day. Buys and gtc fills for me during and after
the cliff-fall though were: a gtc fill for a small add of KMB @ $60.52; a buy
of yet more ATPG; an add to my PFD position (discussed on Dividends for

Yeah, maybe time to re-buy SVU or consider it. Anybody with an opinion on this

SVU: is "Acme Markets, Albertsons, Bristol Farms, bigg?s, Cub Foods, Farm
Fresh, Hornbacher?s, Jewel-Osco, Lucky, Save-A-Lot, Shaw?s Supermarkets, Shop
?n Save, Shoppers Food & Pharmacy, and Star Markets banners".

Grocery business so competitive with the big three (SVU, SWY, KR). And where I
live, the growth from immigrant/1st gen population boom is being addressed by
small-chain but large-store Chinese, Korean, and Mexican markets. So imo, this
component of USA population growth does not shop or help SVU imo.

SVU with p/e of 7 and p/sales .08 seems to discount that though with its
current stock price. And it's not like SVU can rest -- lot of hedge funds in
past have gone in to poor performing grocery chains as acquirer or
consolidator.

I may start a buy if stock tomorrow trades again near today's lows.

 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Navigators Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NAVG - News)
reported net income of $17.0 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the three
months ended March 31, 2010 compared to net income of $12.0 million, or $0.71
per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2009. Operating earnings(1)
were $13.1 million, or $0.77 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2010
compared to $20.2 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, for the first quarter of
2009.

Book value is not up to 49.47$, tangible book around 48.%$. So a buyer here is
buying 1$ in liquid assets for 78 cents. They are buying back stock,
acknowledging that competition is stiffer, rather than growing premiums. This
is exactly what a LT owner want them to do at this point.

RE: Atmos Energy Corporation (ATO)

After waiting patiently for several months. I was finally able to get the price
I wanted for ATO. My buy in price now gets me a dividend close to a 5% yield
with some modest growth. Forward PE improving at 12. Yearly dividend increase
every year going back eighteen years.

I like the NG storage assets that ATO has and their NG pipeline distribution
network.

I plan to sell some or all of my Pepco Holdings, Inc. (POM) utility. I have a
small profit from my previous buys and I can wait for my price of $17.00/share
and still earn my 6% dividend. POM earnings release today was not that stellar
with profits falling by $11M (down 20% from previous quarter). It was a miss by
$0.02/share. Company had higher than normal expenses from two winter storms.
This was seen as a one time event and the stock was upgraded to a buy by
Suntrust Robinson.

I am modestly raising cash from my recent profitable buys as I can now find
better companies at lower prices like ATO.

Dividends greater than 5% and low PE's (12PE or less) are my initial screens. I
also have a focus on domestic companies as I do not want any surprises from a
Greece or Spain default. The exception would be something like a Kimberly-Clark
Corporation (KMB) that begins to look attractive to me for another add below
$60/share.

Paul, you got my attention with TOT. That 6%+ divvy certainly looks attractive.
And safe. Free Cash Flow took a hit in 2009 and ROEttm has fallen off, but most
metrics look good. There's a fair amount of cash on a very solid balance sheet
and the company has grown shareholder equity at about a 12% compounded rate
over the last decade. Plus, according to the last quarterly report, TOT has
reduced debt substantially.

The bad news is in the chart. What we've got here is a splendid example of a
falling knife.

I've tried to catch a few in my day and I don't find it too pleasant, but most
times that's how you play the value game. Low 40s looks like a real possibility
to me, although a small entry position doesn't seem like a bad idea. I don't
know what kicked off this decline since January. TOT missed earnings by a few
cents recently; the rest is probably due to dollar strength and/or the Euro
zone rolling over. I'll be a buyer, probably sooner rather than later, plus I
see an opportunity to acquire other solid Euro multi-nationals coming up.
Meanwhile, I'll read the Morningstar and S&P reports on TOT.

In the white-bread area, the expanding companies seem to be Trader Joe's
(privately owned) and its new competitor, Tesco's Fresh and Easy. These are
"neighborhood markets", and being small sq. foot spaces, they appear to expand
more quickly.

I believe I have Tesco as #1 position in a Vanguard annuity fund I have.

Stops,

Not to beat a dead horse, but I agree with Paul and continue to dislike the
idea of stop-loss orders for value investing. Is someone going to let a market
blip (sometimes intentionally triggered by unscrupulous market makers) override
their analysis? We are supposed to take advantage of Mr. Market, not let him
take advantage of us.

That being said, I will have to admit I just applied a "mental stop" to my
portfolio. I realized I got complacent, being basically fully invested and
enjoying the ride up even though I realized the oppportunities available
weren't that attractive and that I should get some more cash into the portfolio
as a protective measure.

I therefore sold a few of my more questionable securities today and will
probably look to pare off some more if the opportunity arises.

In this case, I am admitting I was over-invested going up into the mini-crash
we have had over the past week. Had I been properly positioned, I wouldn't be
feeling the need to sell anything in here. And the bonds/trust preferreds in my
IRA didn't help much either. They got whacked on a big widening of credit

OP-ED COLUMNIST
A Money Too Far

By PAUL KRUGMAN
So, is Greece the next Lehman? No. It isn’t either big enough or interconnected
enough to cause global financial markets to freeze up the way they did in 2008.
Whatever caused that brief 1,000-point swoon in the Dow, it wasn’t justified by
actual events in Europe.

Nor should you take seriously analysts claiming that we’re seeing the start of
a run on all government debt. U.S. borrowing costs actually plunged on Thursday
to their lowest level in months. And while worriers warned that Britain could
be the next Greece, British rates also fell slightly.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that Greece’s problems are deeper than
Europe’s leaders are willing to acknowledge, even now — and they’re shared, to
a lesser degree, by other European countries. Many observers now expect the
Greek tragedy to end in default; I’m increasingly convinced that they’re too
optimistic, that default will be accompanied or followed by departure from the
euro.

In some ways, this is a chronicle of a crisis foretold. I remember quipping,
back when the Maastricht Treaty setting Europe on the path to the euro was
signed, that they chose the wrong Dutch city for the ceremony. It should have
taken place in Arnhem, the site of World War II’s infamous “bridge too far,”
where an overly ambitious Allied battle plan ended in disaster.

The problem, as obvious in prospect as it is now, is that Europe lacks some of
the key attributes of a successful currency area. Above all, it lacks a central
government.

Consider the often-made comparison between Greece and the state of California.
Both are in deep fiscal trouble, both have a history of fiscal
irresponsibility. And the political deadlock in California is, if anything,
worse — after all, despite the demonstrations, Greece’s Parliament has, in
fact, approved harsh austerity measures.

But California’s fiscal woes just don’t matter as much, even to its own
residents, as those of Greece. Why? Because much of the money spent in
California comes from Washington, not Sacramento. State funding may be slashed,
but Medicare reimbursements, Social Security checks, and payments to defense
contractors will keep on coming.

What this means, among other things, is that California’s budget woes won’t
keep the state from sharing in a broader U.S. economic recovery. Greece’s
budget cuts, on the other hand, will have a strong depressing effect on an
already depressed economy.

So is a debt restructuring — a polite term for partial default — the answer? It
wouldn’t help nearly as much as many people imagine, because interest payments
only account for part of Greece’s budget deficit. Even if it completely stopped
servicing its debt, the Greek government wouldn’t free up enough money to avoid
savage budget cuts.

The only thing that could seriously reduce Greek pain would be an economic
recovery, which would both generate higher revenues, reducing the need for
spending cuts, and create jobs. If Greece had its own currency, it could try to
engineer such a recovery by devaluing that currency, increasing its export
competitiveness. But Greece is on the euro.

So how does this end? Logically, I see three ways Greece could stay on the
euro.

First, Greek workers could redeem themselves through suffering, accepting large
wage cuts that make Greece competitive enough to add jobs again. Second, the
European Central Bank could engage in much more expansionary policy, among
other things buying lots of government debt, and accepting — indeed welcoming —
the resulting inflation; this would make adjustment in Greece and other
troubled euro-zone nations much easier. Or third, Berlin could become to Athens
what Washington is to Sacramento — that is, fiscally stronger European
governments could offer their weaker neighbors enough aid to make the crisis
bearable.

The trouble, of course, is that none of these alternatives seem politically
plausible.

What remains seems unthinkable: Greece leaving the euro. But when you’ve ruled
out everything else, that’s what’s left.

If it happens, it will play something like Argentina in 2001, which had a
supposedly permanent, unbreakable peg to the dollar. Ending that peg was
considered unthinkable for the same reasons leaving the euro seems impossible:
even suggesting the possibility would risk crippling bank runs. But the bank
runs happened anyway, and the Argentine government imposed emergency
restrictions on withdrawals. This left the door open for devaluation, and
Argentina eventually walked through that door.

If something like that happens in Greece, it will send shock waves through
Europe, possibly triggering crises in other countries. But unless European
leaders are able and willing to act far more boldly than anything we’ve seen so
far, that’s where this is heading.

NAVG earnings (and combined ratios) are somewhat lumpy due to their small size
and the fluctuations of the insurance business.

My view of an insurer like NAVG is simple - it is management job to grow
tangible book value/share. Earnings are a way to do that. If the business is
soft, it's better for management to shrink their business and buy back shares
especially if they can do it below tangible book. NAVG stated already that
business is soft, so if that is what they are doing, than that is fine with me.

I always thought the idea of the euro was rather stupid. You had a bunch of
countries that willingly let go of their power to print money through their
central banks. When you give up that power for a shared central bank,
monetizing your country's debt becomes extremely difficult, as Greece is now
finding out. The EU should have just been a free trade zone.

Anyway, this is going to be a mess. We're not just dealing with Greece here.

With DJCO, I assume today's drop is just random fluctuation or some profit

The uptrend in DJCO's stock price recently might be related to

From the article:"...The company said revenue in its oil and gas segment, its
largest business unit, plunged to $2.1 billion from $3.4 billion a year ago due
to slower business awards and a decline in backlog.

Industrial and infrastructure revenue rose 6 percent to $1.2 billion, while its
government unit saw revenue jump 79 percent to $663 million. Revenues also
increased in its power group, but global services revenue dropped 20 percent.

Fluor stood by its 2010 outlook of $2.80 to $3.20 per share in net income...."

=====================================================================

I like the company but think it is getting fully valued even with the stimulus
money that should trickle through. The company does have a substantial "back

I am thinking that Shaw Group Inc. (The) Common St (NYSE: SHAW) or Chicago

I attended the hard assets conference yesterday in NYC for the third year in a
row. Spoke to the former CEO of Detour Gold, a lovely lady, who is still a
large shareholder in it as well as continuing her role as CEO of pelangio
exploration, saw the folks at strathmore, a uranium company trying to get into
production, they think it will be another 4 years before they get into
production. Saw the business development guy at ATUSF. He said that a year ago
he had thought he would be able to deploy the cash to make some more
acquisitions but the market turned around so fast, they didnt see anything they
wanted to commit to. He told me that they were big time involved in getting IRC
sold. I thanked him for it. I also spoke to a geologist from AXU, she seemed
pretty happy about the way thing are going there. also saw a group of companies
that aab.to invests in side by side in one area. I guess they all share various
corporate expenses. It was an interesting group of investment , 3 of whom were
presenting the next day but I chose not to stay. It seems to me that the jr.
developers are far from being a bubble looking at the number and type of people
who attended.Only the presentations of James Dines and Rick Rule were packed.
They were both entertaining. A lot of Mr. Rule's talk I saw previously on the
internet. He is a very sharp guy.

The common theme of the presenters that were not representing specific
companies was that developing countries have both the gdp growth and the
increasing middle class, hence there will be increased demand for commodities
over time. The gold supporters talked about gold being a store of value for
thousands of years for whatever reason, the inability to print more of it, an
assumption that we are at peak gold, and that countries like china and india
were underweight gold in their reserves relative to other countries and were
likely to increase those reserves.
Also heard some of presentation by one of the manager from GROW. He likes
Silver Wheaton too.

There is quite a bit of dilution headwinds to earnings (sharecount increased by

Hi anialzer - What will you be looking for that indicates FLR is no longer a
hold? Is it technical analysis and/or some type of valuation metric?

The market apparently is satisfied with their earnings report last night even
though the stock sold off at the open, it is now up over 3% to $50.50/share.
The most recent recovery high was on 4/26/2010 at $55.47/share (9.8% away). The
stock is trading at both it's weekly and monthly 50 SMA after a successful test
below all 50 SMAs (daily, weekly & monthly). Long term the 2007-2008 trading
quartile range of $75-$95 would be a good future target price zone if the
company's future earnings growth remains positive.

I am not too sure what impact the BP offshore drilling accident will have on
future drilling projects. Perhaps it will be limited to deep drilling projects
and other land based project will continue to go forward. FLR gets a
significant amount of its revenue from this sector, so any slow down (or delay)
in project demand will impact their back log order book.

Good evening to you EKS

I sure wish I new how to answer your question of a selling point, but honestly
I haven't thought that far ahead on FLR. It seems to me if you click on the
chart below once you open it, it's quite clear that the decline from 90's to 30
represented a major low. The retest in March was classic. Now its all a matter
of time and nutty volatility. I guess a good run in the stock would interest me
as a potential seller.

http://i40.tinypic.com/rlm14n.jpg

My view is not really metric based, and for all I know it could approach 43
again in an environment such as this. But since the Nov 08, March 09, Dec. 09
and other interim lows since then it has built a series of higher lows. This
against a backdrop of earnings reports that have been somewhat disappointing.
The Co. has a good ROE, sells at a fraction of calculated enterprise value, and
has a love affair with institutional investors who seek the highest quality
Brand names in the sector. In the long run FLR has participation in so many
areas, including the nuclear energy segment that I just feel it will work out.
It's well managed, makes money during difficult contractions, and if results
begin to improve this year and next demand for the stock could get a boost
again amid tangible evidence of a recovery in contract backlogs. It's just more
a sentiment and feeling than specific reasoning for me. I'd be more interested
in buying a decline into the lower 40's than selling at 50. Maybe down there
some long term deep in the money leaps would make a nice addition if premiums
weren't excessive. Nearer term I thing the market has some testing to do and my
perception is not much will buck the overall market movement until some footing
has been restored.

Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N(NYSE: CBI) - ROE: 22.11%
Shaw Group Inc. (The) Common St(NYSE: SHAW) - ROE: 4.36% </pre>

OK anializer I will go with your analysis for FLR. ROE is pretty good for FLR &
CBI. (SHAW's ROE is effected by their huge loan from Hitachi for the purchase
of their Westinghouse nuclear division which is based in YEN and losses/gains
are adjusted quarterly affecting net income returns.)

The market agrees with you too as FLR up 6% and CBI & SHAW up 4.7% and 3.9%
respectively. It's true that the institutional investor will go with the "best
of breed" and will pay a premium for that. PE is also a lagging metric and even
the forward PE can be a bit misleading for these companies as their projects
can last multiple month's/years. Therefore, the change in their backlog book
orders is the thing to watch. It has been growing for all of these companies.

The key for selling is to let your last shares go when things are looking the
best and new buyers will pay an extra premium for all the good news and strong
earnings of the company.

My only reservation was none of these companies pay a dividend and I want to
book some type of gain to reflect my holding cost while I wait for those double
digit returns. So, I took 20% of the gains off the table earlier this month.

I will continue to hold my shares and try to be a patient value investor even
as Mr. Market jumps up and down digesting the world's economic events.

Drug companies.

GENZ. Management apparently now being investigated for insider trading based on
insiders' knowledge of poor product quality. Have held this stock for maybe
four months with some expectations that there would be positive news
forthcoming, not negative news. Too much for me; I'm out at break-even. Product
is in demand though, so somebody with more patience and confidence and
conviction than I have might profit by holding the stock.

In reviewing GENZ again, I've come across a small company that is building
operations to utilize plant cells instead of human cells to develop drugs. And
one of the drugs it's targeting is the drug that GENZ has quality problems with
and therefore of which there is a shortage. Protalix Biotherapeutics (PLX) is
the company. I've taken a small position -- It's a speculation of course.

About Protalix and GENZ.

"Protalix is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of proprietary recombinant therapeutic proteins expressed
through its proprietary plant cell based expression system. Protalix's
ProCellEx™ presents a proprietary method for the expression of recombinant
proteins that the Company believes will allow for the industrial-scale
production of recombinant therapeutic proteins in an environment free of
mammalian components and viruses. Protalix is also advancing additional
recombinant biopharmaceutical drug development programs. Taliglucerase alfa is
an enzyme replacement therapy in development under a Special Protocol
Assessment with the FDA for Gaucher disease. In August 2009, the FDA granted
orphan drug status and fast track designation to taliglucerase alfa for the
treatment of Gaucher disease and Protalix filed a rolling NDA submission with
the FDA in December 2009. In November 2009, Protalix granted Pfizer Inc.
exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize taliglucerase alfa for
the treatment of Gaucher disease, except in Israel. Protalix retained the right
to commercialize taliglucerase alfa in Israel."

ABT. Stock seems to be a buy somewhere here under $50. Have purchased this

Oil stocks. I've moved my focus to EF/NPV. Still look at at book value, but not
finding new candidates where price to stated bv is less than one.

I'm having to dig a little deeper to find npv. And just as was stated by
Spekulatius that there are some issues with McDep calculations, I find many
concerns/questions also with individual company calculations as I search
through their reports. Many, not all, e&p companies report 2pnpv-10 (the metric
I'm looking for) based on the various "p's" -- proved/producing, proved/not
producing, probable; they exclude or sometimes include other assets; they do or
don't report overall company number or do or don't report each geographic area
or by well itself; they do or don't record the npv of the well before or after
royalty and/or before or after working interest and/or before or after taxes.
Also, there's the bboe split between gas,condensate, oil and how each is to be
valued (end of year prices, average price during the year). Not often are all
these conditions specified clearly, or are they clear to me how to interpret
them.

So at best npv-10 is a guideline. Still I use it for a baseline in making
purchases. Small purchases of several companies by which I attempt to control
risk through diversification -- acquiring a basket of companies that trade
below 2pnpv-10.

Fwiw:

I'm adding to my few EPM shares today (Stock closed @$5.79.) In their April
presentation (p.8) they said they have "1P+2P reserves (7/1/09) PV10 of $245M,
or $7.75 per fully diluted share". And "84%" of those reserves are oil.
Furthermore, as they reiterated in the SeekingAlpha's transcript (Evolution
Petroleum Corporation F3Q10 (Qtr End 03/31/10) Earnings Call Transcript) of
their earnings call, that npv is expected to grow:

"One of the things that I think people can easily miss is that our PV 10
actually increases until peaking at about 2015 before it rolls over. We have a
depleteable reserve but what’s going on here is that the 10% discount rates are
being knocked off as the years go by, are over powering the more minimal
depletion of the reserve. Kind of the exciting thing for is as time passes that
PV 10 inclines without anything else happening. At the same time, we’re getting
cash flow off of Delhi that we can reinvest in some of our other projects to
continue to build shareholder value through that means as well. It’s kind of a
double accelerator affect that we’ve got in our favor here for a while"

Npv can grow or shrink of course depending on how oil and gas prices rise or
fall. Oil seems more expensive now than when the company's independent service
calculated 2pnpv last year, so the reported npv is likely to be somewhat
understated now.

Anyway, there's a small margin of safety here -- maybe -- and I'm an acquirer
and holder of a few shares. ATPG remains the company I follow with the largest
discount to npv and my largest holding by far in this venue. ATPG, being a Gulf
of Mexico deepwater driller just expanding it production, has its issues
though.

to give a year or two to see if things happen. I dont think this this CEO is
doing this with the goal of managing assets sub $10 billion and he has a lot of
skin invested. Perhaps you should listen to the conference call if you have any
interest in the company.

pharma: Fwiw, agree with the Zack's report on BAX. I've today swapped out of
BAX and placed funds into BDX.

If I could see decently, I'd say it's clear that because of BAX size and
products, that it's entrenched in the health care system of the US, and maybe
other countries as well. So its business does seem, as Zack's says, "isolated
from economic downturns".

Otoh, BAX product recall issues are significant. Further, I'm bothered by
management's apparent incompetence with or tolerance for apparently
shoddy/defective product.

The stock of this strong S&P company now trades BELOW where it traded at the
stock market bottom of '09. That troubles me. Until I come to grips with this,
I believe I will stay out.

Stock could be a good value speculation (for somebody else -g-) at current
price. ($44.25) I'll go with Zack's, whose target is $41. There, it might be a
buy for me.
============
My BDX position acquired 4-5/'09. I'll average up now with a small add.

Tortoise funds. TTO cuts dividend. I am out as of this morning.

I buy these type funds for limited partnership distributions which I assume
will be growing as some or several holdings increase their distributions (as
oil/gas partnerships have historically done). Given market turmoil of last
year, I'm not so tolerant of seeing unexpected cuts in the distribution now.

TTO - Tortoise Capital Resources - "invests primarily in privately-held and
micro-cap public companies". This is inherently risky itself, because of the
lack of transparency and the resultant TTO management "guess" of TTO's nav
summary for private firms. So my recently established position has been very
small indeed with TTO. (whew!)

Not too thrilled that management would be so overly invested in a problem
company that they would jeopardize TTO's distribution.
Makes me wonder if Tortoise's TPZ, TYN also have management problems that I
should be concerned about. (I hold decent positions in these two Tortoise
funds.)

-----------
Looks like the bet was to get more TPZ at your May 6 recommended price, EKS, as
you suggested for consideration. I put my order in that night, did not fill.
(aside: Stock, for those who might follow it, has moved above EKS's suggested
buy range.)

India’s per capita spending on city development is $17 each year, just 15
percent of what China spends, according to a report released by McKinsey & Co.
last month. India will have 68 cities with a population of more than one
million people, 13 cities with more than four million people and 6 mega cities
with populations of 10 million or more, at least two of which will be among the
five largest cities in the world by 2030.

India produces about 10 percent less electricity than it needs. The roads,
which account for 65 percent of India’s cargo, are plagued by single lanes and
irregular surfaces, slowing trucks to an average speed of about 20 kilometers
per hour, said a 2009 study by Transport Corp. of India and the Indian
Institute of Management, Calcutta.

The average time taken by ships to unload and load at Indian ports is almost 96
hours, about 10 times longer than in Hong Kong, the government said in its
latest annual economic survey.

re COWN - being a Lehmann big shot is not going to help them get a foot in the
door, I bet. I red the interview about Cohen a while ago and while it sounds
impressive, I think this small boutique shops have their work cut out for them.
So far it seems that the big boys are raking in the money and only few crumps
are left for the smaller ones. So what is left are niche business. Rodham does
business with smelly Chinese microcap stocks. I don't know what COWN vision is
but it seems very generic.

Anyways, revenues are down more than 7M$ QoQ, losses are mounting and the
investment bank environment may be getting worse.If they can do what they say
they are going to do, then COWN is a 3x bagger, but I can as well seeing them
at zero in a couple of years if they blow their equity on bloated salaries.

I have been wrong before and will be so many times more. OTOH one of the
companies stated goals is to bring compensation more in line with revenues and
profits. Since Cohen owns something like 30% of the company, I believe his
interests are highly alligned with shareholders.

Sold out position today on Pol. No hurry, but looking to add to LABL with
proceeds. Low shares outstanding, 1.9% dividend yield. Good cash flow. Sales
growth lately has been through acquisition.
If they can get the Collotype acquisition on track. Growth should expand
profits to past levels, IMO.

Oil stocks: Added a little more MDU.

Upped my position in Nal O&G Trust. I like NOIGF for its position in Alberta's
Cardium area and its distribution (C$.09/mo), which to USA people is $C1.08
(before Canadian tax) on today's NOIGf.pk approx. $10.70 stock price. However,
the trust will convert to a corporation by 4Q 2010. "After conversion, the
Trust's total return will be driven by a combination of growth and yield, with
yield remaining a strong component of the overall return. Specific payout and
dividend levels will be established closer to the time of conversion."

Also, fwiw, I added to my position in Denbury Resources, DNR. I'm partial to
this one because it has a lot of carbon dioxide resources which it uses in
extracting oil/gas.

Tech stocks. Wrong though I've been, I maintain my claim that GOOG fair value
is $700/sh (if profit margins hold up).
With GOOG shares today at $501-$502, I added to my position.

Also, fwiw, I entered QCOM today for the first time. I'm looking at it as a
reversion-to-mean play, not a value play.

Analysts expect continuation of earnings uptrend. The average earnings estimate
for 9/'11 is $2.52, and on current stock price, that'd make the pe under 15.
Whereas in past, stock has traded for 20-30 p/e. I'm betting that if things
unfold as the average QCOM analyst expects (although that happening is no sure
thing), then the stock will move up from current apparently-depressed levels.

That's the problem. From a value perspective I think you need to allow for the
possibility that margins won't hold up. Not that I'm saying that ~$500 is a
horrible entry point, but I'm not comfortable until the mid $400's at least.

Very nice report from HWG. P/e based on current earnings is very low.

To me it's a question of sustainability of those earnings.
"Sales of specialty fabric to U.S. military contractors accounted for
$34,657,000 and $28,394,000 in the 2010 and 2009 first quarters, which
represented 73.5% and 71.6% of Brookwood's sales, respectively."

If HWG is going to earn more than $9/sh this year (first quarter already
$3.44/sh, better than last year's $1.94), then I surmise there must be
something special indeed about HWG's "specialty fabrics". Who knows what
though.

My premise is that gov't will allow "decent" profits, but might want to review
contracts if there's >$10/sh earnings on $36 book value = >28% roe. Excessive
enough that the gov't might actively try to reduce prices paid for HWG's
products.

Back otoh, it's the gov't contractors who pay for HWG's product, so maybe it's
a relatively obscure and small amount in the contract amount for the product,
whatever it is, developed by the contractors for the government. Further, the
one analyst (per Yahoo) following the company, predicts $10.79/sh for 12/'11.
So he/she believes the earnings are sustainable for another year at least.

And back otoh, HWG has had an erratic earnings history. Losses in '00-'02,
losses again in '06, '07. HWG has traded much higher than current ~$45 in
previous years. Maybe though that was partly due to their oil lp, which now is
in bankruptcy.

My summary: Irrespective of current stock price, it's a tough stock for me to
be conclusive about.

RE: Selling Strategies - scaling out vs close out position

Hi Paul -

Are there any other stocks you have sold or closed out positions on that have
exceeded fair value in your opinion? I have several stocks that I have a profit
in but could move a bit higher before I believe they are at or near my fair
value target. I must weigh these with other stocks on my watch list which I
feel are better prospects especially when I consider the risk/reward.

I really never like to sell especially when I have made good buy entry points
but I find that the portfolio tends to get stuck in out of favor sectors from
time to time. I am thinking if I try to turn the portfolio over a bit more and
sell those stocks that are no longer at "fair value", I can generate better
returns rather than holding round trip positions. I find I am holding my
average positions too long (from 4-6 years) w/o booking the large gains that
generally happen w/i the first 2-3 years.

That's why its good to hear recent sales and the thinking about a partial sell
vs closing out a position, if expectations have been met and if the proceeds go
to cash reserves or into a better value proposition.

A few comments about sales from time to time helps me to better understand the
relative "value" in a particular stock.
