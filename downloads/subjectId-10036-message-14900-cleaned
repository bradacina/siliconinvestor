Anyone looking at EP still? Some discussion of it before when it was at 25 or
so (after a big drop). Now it's at 10. But looking at WMB and DYN, you have to
wonder if it too won't go to 2-3.

I cannot believe that all these energy stocks will go like ENRON down the tube,
but that seems to be the market perspective now. EP seems to have a better
balance sheet than the others, but all are under a cloud due to California's
lawsuits and all the round-trip swap trades that were done for deceptive
reasons. S&P came out today with a justification for not downgrading EP debt
rating.

Anyone thinking of nibbling on these risky stocks?

Thread, how are you playing this market?

I've seen one person who's said mostly by being in cash with a few shorts.
Somebody else mentioned going for small caps that look like screaming buys. And
some are looking for good dividend yields on special preferreds.

For me, I'm trying to upgrade my portfolio to rein in large caps that before
now seemed too expensive for me. (I've mentioned a couple in the past few
days.) Adding a bit too to downtrodden small caps that I'm willing to bet will
eventually recover in business and stock price. Or that have a good dividend
and a history of not cutting that dividend. Not so much looking for new ideas
in the small cap universe anymore - more like sticking with stocks I've owned
or have watched for a while. I've also been taking some profits while I still
have them. And selling some loser stocks for the tax loss and to free up funds
to move into the larger caps.

Anybody else here with a perspective to share?

Playing this market is not fun, unless you are a short. I have to admit i
became somewhat paralysed by the market decline. I have fallen into the value
trap and bought shares in companies with "issues" that appear cheap. Examples
are BMY,MLNM,EP,MIR,ELN - the problem is this would have been a dream short
portfolio. I avoided most steep drops and did some succesfull trades but
overall lost quite a bit of money. I am about 70% in cash right now and I think
i will play this market simply by buying ETF's (XLE, UTH, XLU, IDU - energy XLF
-financials PPH - pharma etc.) but above all simple SPY's. I think we are
seeing an issue with survival for many companies with leverage and so i believe

Paul, I am sticking with most of my favorites with the best earnings and cash
flow and the lowest PE's on "real" 2002 earnings. For example, FB crushed
estimates last night and NFI reports tonight after the bell, should be similar.
Insurance plays include ACGL, IPCR and CERG with decent position in retailers
TBAC, PERY and SGDE.

My only big tech position is JDAS. Also nibbling on COGI whenever it dips under
$2, it is a successful business selling like a BK play. Ditto PVAT in defense.

Recent forays into large caps DUK, SBC and BBY all well underwater but they are
franchise names worth owning long-term (though mostly not screaming values).

I am not buying the trouble stories like DYN and WMB. Also trying to avoid any
new plays with high debt (CD was interesting until I checked the debt load,
ouch).

I haven't sold much because I simply refuse to dump quality stocks at junk
prices. The time to sell was a month ago before the value market disintegrated.
The right time will come around again, too.

In retrospect, wish I had stopped out of my top holdings, added shorts then
been ready to buy back my favorites at the current 30-40% discounts to recent
highs.

Paul -- regarding your post:

I put my feelings from 4/9 below. Times have really changed in a few months!
Like you, I am purchasing some large caps -- specifically PFE, XOM, PEP, AMGN,
AIG, HSY, ADP, PAYX. Mid-Cap pickups include: PCL, CHD, JWA, CEFT, MHP.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=17308108

Wearing my emotion on my sleeve:

Maybe it's because I just read this month's "The High-Tech Strategist", but I
am very concerned about the market over the next year or two.

(Caveat: I have also been reading all of Graham's books again -- and how a real
bear market reacts.)

1) Energy is stabilizing, & I feel it should decline -- but higher energy
prices will effect industrial profits.

2) Every valuation metric for most large companies (& many mid-cap companies)
are way out of proprortion. Reading about people putting stocks like "AOL",
"TYC" in the value category is a little disturbing. The writeoffs of goodwill,
stock options, and balance sheet manipulation are rampant and continue to pop
up on a daily basis.

3) Interest rates will be increasing over the next few years -- albeit,
probably slowly -- but who knows. I doubt they will go to 0% like in Japan.

4) Insider selling continues.

5) Value stocks, in my opinion, are very scarce. The market is simply way over
priced -- in almost every sector.

6) Investors I respect, (Bill N of Oakmark Select fame), are buying stocks like
Merck. This is a quality holding: top financial rating, blue chip one-decision
stock, etc. But going through the patent expiration review, P/E, P/S valuations
-- I just don't see the same cheapness or value.

7) Every valuation metric, comparing the current coming-out-of-a-recession
timeframe vs. prior periods -- a la 1990 time frame -- indicate a major rebound
is already in the cards.

I'm a firm believer in Graham & Dodd's valuation metrics. I hope the
significant bear market doesn't occur, and hopefully earnings will rebound
soon.

Thanks for letting me get that off my chest! :)

re: "Thread, how are you playing this market?"

I have a higher percentage of cash than I have ever had. I went to higher cash
about 2 months ago and then went to even more cash on 7/15.

I don't believe this is a typical retrenchment, at least from the perspective
of my lifetime. I believe this is the market getting sized for the economic
realities of the US in 2002 and 2003. As such, I believe this drop in the
market has a long way to go yet. I don't necessarily feel that the drop will be
straight down to the appropriate levels, but I do suspect it will feel that
way.

At the end of the drop cash will be king. I intend to have some left.

I reviewed 50 companies on Sunday, found 22 that had interesting enough Yahoo
profile that I'd spend a little more time looking at them and did my quick cash
flow analysis on them and found 4 that might warrant a detailed look. If the
market were "right sized" after this drop, I would expect the final number to
be at least 8 or 9, if the market had "overshot" to the downside, I would
expect to find 10 or 12. IMO we have a long way to go.

I am not completely out of the market however. I still have decent sized
positions in those companies I believe in: TUG, TRCI, CCL, ACK (although I've
played this one with technical strategies because the chart started to look
ugly at the $3.45ish range so I got out, am now back in at about $1.60), KSL,
XNR (I've held this one and perhaps shouldn't have), ALPH, FRD, ORCL. Took
profits in GVHR (although I let some of them slip away), LU (that was a
technical play all the way, in at 2.00 out at 2.64), SGC (although I wonder
whether I sold that too quickly), took losses in some others, but I haven't had
enough coffee to spur the memory cells to fire correctly yet.

I've bought some bonds: F 7.25% non-callable due in 2010, F 7.00% due in 2012
(I think), some municipals here in Florida at 5.1%.

Looking at a TYC bond yielding 17.844 matures in 8/03 priced at 88.50.

I hear a lot of talking heads saying "This market is way oversold", but I don't
believe it yet.

I see a lot of uncertainty, corporate accounting...we've seen the companies
that were too close to the edge and have fallen off, but how many others were
initially in better shape but no less fraudulent? What about changes in the
Boards of Directors, their qualifications, their liabilities? Will anyone want
to serve because of the fear of future lawsuits? Will they be able to afford
liability insurance? If the company provides for it, what will be the cost?

How will the new corporate attention to GAAP affect earnings? How will
expensing for options affect earnings? How will the dollar affect earnings? How
will the trade war unfold and what impact will it have on earnings? How will
the scrutiny of banks and the losses the banks are beginning to incur affect
corporate ability to expand? How will the fear in the marketplace affect the
alternate abilities to raise cash (selling debt or equity)? How will the
Israel/Palestine conflict impact things? How will this administration's
reported insistence on invading Iraq affect things? The burgeoning budget
deficit? Deflation? Inflation? Consumer strength/weakness?

So many issues, so few clear directions from here.

I like cash until the Spring, at least.

Coffee, I need more coffee!

AOL is a value stock - imo - because it trades for what the value of
Time-Warner alone is worth. However, I base that statement on my guess and
media reporting of what "analysts" have calculated Time-Warner to be worth
($15+/sh). Maybe the calculations are right, maybe not.

In today's environment with all the shenanigans and bankruptcies, I'm
cautiously stating my opinion which is: given the assets that AOL has - music,
cable, cable networks, publishing, movies -- it is hard to imagine Time-Warner
not being around ten years from now.

So I bet that given some time, the stock will recover as the business muddles
on, cash flows continue, management gets lucky/smart and makes some positive
strategic business decisions, "entertainment/leisure" stocks come back into
favor, or some combination of it all.

AOL accounting:
I'm assuming here the bad news is that AOL has done "intercompany" or "phony"
or "revenue enhancing swaps" (pick an appropriate word/expression) buys where
the Time-Warner segment "buys" advertising - and substantial amounts of it - on
AOL thus enhancing revenue. Or has cut deals with others that are accounted for
as 'revenue' but are sham or estimated-over-life or other "odd" deals.

Somewhere in the pile that's AOL, there's got to be a business with real
revenues and I hope real potential for earnings. If the stock has to drop
further before or while AOL cleans up its accounting (assuming there is a
problem), so be it. 18 months from now, it'll be forgotten, and the stock might
rise higher than it is now.

My AOl Politically Incorrect Opinion:

Not only is my opinion on AOL politically incorrect, it's not based on any
stated facts. Given those assumptions, I probably don't deserve to state my
opinion.

But here is what I believe: from the beginning I have thought that TYCO
management, LHSP management, GLX (or gblx -- whatever Global Crossing was!),
WMB management, ENE management were all crooks. This was based just on gut
instinct and listening to management's explanation(s).

My gut feeling says avoid AOL like the black plague. I simply can't even
consider investing in a company that I feel is run by somebody I don't trust.
My gut feeling has kept me out of more problems than potential gains from wrong
gut feelings.

I look for the old-fashioned value plays -- p/s, p/b, p/e, current assets -
debt is a easy figure to calculate, dividend growth, insider buys, no
management turnover, understandable busy model.

Buffett said that one doesn't have to have superior stock picks, only that
losses are limited. Don't take the big loss. I consider TYC, ENE, WMB as taking
the big loss.

Buffett quotes:

http://www.angelfire.com/co/simplewealth/buffettips.html

"An investor needs to do very few things right as long as he or she avoids big
mistakes."

"Turn-arounds" seldom turn.

Is management rational?

Is management candid with the shareholders?

It is more important to say "no" to an opportunity, than to say "yes".

Generally, I'd say volatility isn't equivalent to risk.

But in TYC's case:

There's a large chop in the price today. Lots of people want out (92M sh.
changing hands as I look).

In past, TYC either hasn't been honest or forthright with investors.

They deny rumors of hiring a bankruptcy attorney firm. Given how I might
interpret that in business-speak, maybe they did but are calling the people
"workout specialists" or "debtor-in-possession" people or some obfuscating
term. Maybe TYC really is planning for bankruptcy. Level of trust with TYC is
very low.

There was also an article out yesterday on how TYC's $2B dollar investment in
undersea cable is only generating under $50M in revenue. (I don't remember
exact amounts.) A disastrous, ill-timed, venture though. I inferred from the
article that those cap. costs and expenses coupled with little revenue had not
been factored into TYC's problems because investors were not aware of the
situation.

It would seem that the wise decision is to avoid TYC and and others like it.

For me though, I'm adding to my position.

Made some sales to try to rebalance and free up some cash for buys.

It's not just my portfolio that needs rebalancing. I need it too. -g-
When tough, battle-hardened value investors (e.g Spekulatius, others) are taken
aback by this market, that does scare me. And when I consider this, it makes it
harder for me to step in to buy or even hold on, esp. when it just seems that
prices get cheaper every day.

I'll take loss and close small position in SANYY. Sanyo is the dominant
manufacturer of small batteries, esp. used for cameras. They plod on (albeit
successfully) in too many diverse areas though(imo). High tech to
refrigerators. In owning the stock for a while (3/00) I don't see where they
have much interest in investors as partners.

I'll take the loss and trim back my position in CJR, a Canadian media and
entertainment company. Originally mentioned by Dale Baker (circa 5/01), and
using his method, he was able to quickly exit the position when the stock
turned against him. (Doing this from memory - hoping I remember right) I stuck
with it, added more (9/01), and when the stock rose, I held on. I did not
foresee the earnings decline they've reported now, and in this market, I'm
loath to hang on even though the stock has dropped on the earnings news. There
seem better bargains available in companies reporting decent earnings.

I closed my position in EFX. I have taken profits at higher prices. Although
the stock price has come down, its p/e, p/sales, p/book seem high to me now

slide. That was only two years ago. It did manage to languish between 20 and 25
for the last year or so before its recent plunge. Which many years of trading
at 20 are you talking about?

If you did pick up some at 10 or 12, there may be some hope of appreciation,
but with market conditions so ugly heading into the fall selling season, I
would be a little concerned about another drop under 10 which could put it on
the sell list of many institutions.

Get last weeks Barrons and put Grantham's interview on your wall. Then dust off
your copy of The Rediscovered Ben Graham and you will find an essay written
long ago that is Grantham's argument in another era, but like most of Graham's
great work it reads like it was written yesterday. ("Principles don't change.
Thats why they're called principles." WEB) The Grantham interview is
thoughtful, colorful, persuasive, and terrifying. And I hate to tell you, but I
probably agree with the guy that I can easily see the market dropping another
30, 40, 50% from here over the next three years. I'm not messing around with
bad balance sheets, though nothing's safe if the bear case is right. And so far
it has been right on the nose.

We are at the point in the bear where everybody loses money including value

If I hear Congress making more serious noises about getting rid of the taxes on

re AEG. It's a stinker all right. And for such a large company too.

Yahoo shows that the stock has traded at $20 or more in these years:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AEG&d=c&t=5y&l=on&z=b&q=l

The lowest price/book (annual average) I have going back to '92, gives 1.18.
Using a book value of 8.92 (aside: A problem for me with some of these ADRs is
the inconsistency I find among sources for p/book, div., div. yield, etc.) this
would give a low average price of about $10.5/sh. So I agree that the stock
price could drift down or crash down and stay below 10. I'm not sure it follows
though that funds would then be sellers without their seeing any further
adverse company news. In seven of the past 10 years the stock has sold for 2x
book value or more. If book value remains at 9, the stock could just as well be
at 18+ in a couple of years.

I'll give that this way of looking at it is rear-view. And that some
fundamental flaws may now have been exposed by management. The stock price has
come down to reflect some or maybe all of this. Regardless, I'll assume
management knows their business, is motivated to improve it, and with some
time, maybe 1-2 years, they will. And the stock might recover.

OT -- I just sold my house and will be renting/downsizing so I can travel and
not worry about mold, mildew, termites, pine needles, or starting the wood
stove in the morning. I am renting a smaller, new, beautiful house in town,
with no acreage to maintain.

So I have some serious investing to do that must be very safe and earn my rent.
I am doing preferred stocks (I found some nice ones today and will post on
those as soon as I buy them.) I also bought some REITS and will get some more.
I will get a few value, beaten up equities also.

Sold all my ROST today; bought UDR and FR-D (I think I posted on Fr-d
previously). One preferred I did buy was AIV-h preferred -- 9.7% yield, plus
selling at a discount ($24.5) so if redeemed at maturity, the yield will be
11.6%.
On stocks -- I almost bought more ATG. If you want value picks, I think S,
YELL, SGR, BNHN, and many housings stocks look good. Paul, your FLM looks
unbelievably cheap, and I am about to bite. Are you happy to own it?

I know all my present buys lately are whimpy, income generating, old fogy
investments, but I thought I'd post for all other whimps. If we are in for a
downturn, I am prepared. I am locking in significant dividend income and will
buy a house back when that bubble pops.

This last week finally put me slightly negative for YTD. Damn! But thankful.

Wait till you see the other preferred I found. If I can get it tomorrow -- it
matures in 2 months and will generate a safe 16% if redemmed, and 8.5% if they
let it go and never redeem it. And, of course, something "in between" if they
do something in between. :o)

I opened a very small position in HAS today.

At under 11, the stock is reasonable on a price/sales basis. I have problems
with other metrics. The price/book for this company always seems to me to be
high . And the book value itself has not really been increasing. ROE is poor.
Net profit margins have been on the decline for years.

Management states (2001 annual) they intend to become a smaller but more
profitable company by focusing on their core brands. They are reducing the
debt.

It's hard for me to value this company because in the past 10 years it always
seems to trade higher than I would expect it should given its financial
performance. Perhaps stockholders are looking at the intangibles - the breadth
and scope and staying power of their brands.

I'll call HAS a regression stock. The stock has generally traded above today's
price during the past ten years. Assuming the market recovers, assuming buyers
still and again are willing to pay a premium (my term for the past 10 years'

FLM: You asked if I was happy owning it. There are too many aspects to it for

happy that I made those partial sales at higher than today's price.

I'm still trying to figure a re-enty price for more FLM. For me, anything under
12 1/2 works. Given FLM's recent good news (customer wins) and the very low

Does anybody think the new bankruptcy legislation has a bad side? I haven't
read the new law, but the gist of it that I get is that, across the board,
discharge of debts will be very hard to get accomplished. Additionally, a
minimum of $100/month will have to be paid for a minimum of 5 years.

The concerns I have center around implementing any kind of tougher bankruptcy
law in the middle of all the market chaos that exists.

The major strength we have economically is the consumer, why would we encourage
him to button his back pocket?

I hear a figure of about $400/person as the added cost because of people filing
bankruptcies. What I don't hear is what the new figure would be...maybe
$350/person? But what would be the cost per person if the economy shrivels up
like it did in Japan?

If the consumer slows down, then prices will fall as enticements to get the
consumer increase. Isn't that deflation? And isn't one of the nasties about
deflation that people delay major purchases even more because they know the
price will be lower if they wait?

Am I seeing beasties here where none exist?

From:Don Earl
Timba,

I have a fairly low opinion of the bankruptcy law changes being proposed. As
close as I can tell, it's something that has been lobbied into effect by the
lenders who have over leveraged consumers in the first place. Where our
bankruptcy laws really need an overhaul is at the corporate level, not at the
consumer level.

Hardly a day goes by where I don't get some kind of credit card or loan offer
in the mail. The typical offer doesn't require me to verify anything
whatsoever. Just sign my name and return the form. To the best of my knowledge,
none of these companies ever take the applicant's outstanding debt into
consideration in issuing new credit. It's more like they treat it as if the new
account will be the only debt outstanding once it's issued.

IMO, companies who issue unsecured credit, without any kind of due diligence as
to the debtor's ability to ever pay it back, don't deserve any kind of beefed
up legal protection against defaults. The idea consumers should be held to a
higher level of responsibility for irresponsibly issued credit strikes me as
being somewhat less than equitable. Especially considering the sub prime debt
most likely to be affected by the changes is issued at predatory rates
supposedly designed to make up for a certain percentage of defaults. Somewhere
along the line Company X who issues a clerk at 7/11 his 20th credit card with a
24% interest rate deserves to take the hit on defaults.

I doubt there is likely to be much impact on consumer credit spending due to
any changes in bankruptcy laws. Where I see the most danger is the companies
issuing the credit are likely to treat it as an excuse to even more
aggressively leverage consumers. What happens if the Fed has to raise rates to
defend the dollar? Real Estate values tend to move opposite of interest rates.
Default rates are already at record levels. What happens when a home purchased
with 3% down loses 10% of it's value and the payments on variable rate credit
cards go up?

If the consumer isn't able to reorganize their debt, at a certain point
liquidation makes more sense. Instead of a limited number of defaults on credit
cards, which never should have been issued in the first place, the defaults on
everything skyrockets. Banks get a nice inventory of houses, and car companies
get their SUVs back. But before that happens, the first thing to go is stocks,
bonds and mutual funds.

Maybe I'm being too bearish, but I think we're in a whole bunch of trouble.
Changes in bankruptcy laws are probably a fairly minor factor in the big
picture, but it could be added to the trend of government serving the elite
minority at the expense of everyone else. A wise government would have told the
credit card companies if they don't like their default rates, to change their
lending practices.

I agree with a lot of what you said about responsibility of the credit card
companies to shoulder the burden of delinquencies generated by ill-conceived
marketing and underwriting of broad categories of credit risk.

I think today's rally, in part, was relief that the bankruptcy bill got shelved
at the last minute. We've got 5 or 6 weeks before it becomes a front-burner
issue again.

 A wise government would have told the credit card companies if they don't like
their default rates, to change their lending practices.

Slowed consumer spending due to changed lending practices is a sounder footing
for the economy, IMO, than slowed spending due to the impact of the bankruptcy
changes. I believe, too, in addressing the root of the problem rather than only
punishing those who are seduced.

mistake of sticking with it fighting the market on the way down. While it's
never been much over a 1% position, it's sufficiently underwater that the best
I'll do is cut my losses. I've had several [ELN, DYN, WMB] where, despite
entering after substantial sell-offs, I severely underestimated how low they
could go. One of the problems with a value orientation is that they look like
better deals as the price declines, but sometimes, as the technicians claim,
the market forecasts the fundamentals...it's not Mr. Market getting depressed
and selling cheap, it's Mr Market saying 'The wolf's at the door, you better
run.'
So there are times when the courage to act on an apparent value opportunity can

BFCFB is on my maybe list from the proceeds of the half-stake I cashed out in
NFI this morning (at the open fortunately, 28.20 before the slide). I will look
carefully at the BBX report. PFI also reports sometime this week, I will decide
about sticking around there.

Any opinions on DIS as a long-term franchise play?

Yes, a buy as a long-term franchise play. If I recall correctly, stock was
bought by several here a few years ago when it was at lows then - as it is now.
Money was made.

A possible terrorist attack at a Disney theme park now has to be factored into
a buy decision.

V also should be looked at if one is considering media conglomerates, imo.

Just nibbled on MIHL at 3.50 if you are still in that one, their latest
financials looked decent from a growth and value point of view.

DIS looks like a good IRA buy here too. Bought a half-lot at 17.3.

I am hoping MIHL will not fritter away its cash.

Hi Steve,
How are you taxed on the 2004 leaps? Is the tax due this year on a long term
capital gain basis or is it recognized in the future at expiry or when/if you
are called out?
Thnx

USA Today reporting Dept. of Justice investigating AOL.

Justice investigates AOL accounting

By David Lieberman, USA TODAY

NEW YORK — The Justice Department has opened an investigation into accounting
practices at AOL Time Warner, according to a person knowledgeable of the probe.

U.S. prosecutors in Virginia, where the company's America Online division is
headquartered, are working in tandem with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Last week, AOL Time Warner disclosed that the SEC is looking into certain
transactions at the company's Internet division. CEO Richard Parsons said his
company is cooperating with the SEC.

An AOL spokesman would not say whether the company is aware of the new
investigation, but he adds that it is "not under any subpoena from the Justice
Department."

The company also says, in a prepared statement Tuesday, that "if the Justice
Department wants to look at the facts, of course we will cooperate with them
too, as we would with any other appropriate government agency."

The Justice Department does not comment on investigations.

But the new investigation could prove to be distracting for AOL. SEC
investigators handle civil violations of securities law and can only issue
subpoenas with the approval of the full commission.

By contrast, Justice Department attorneys can look broadly at possible criminal
acts, and they have the authority to issue subpoenas.

The department also is eager to do its part to restore confidence in U.S.
financial markets, which have been shaken by high-profile accounting scandals.
On Tuesday, President Bush signed a law that imposes new penalties on
executives who "fudge the books."

Investigators in the AOL case are believed to be focusing on accounting
questions raised by a recent Washington Post study. The newspaper said America
Online had, among other things, booked revenue from ads sold for eBay and
renegotiated long-term advertising contracts to recognize revenue more quickly.

In its statement, AOL said, "Our accounting is appropriate and in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and our auditors, Ernst & Young,
have repeatedly confirmed that."

BBX report looks very solid; the MMs really ripped off a few people trying to
get out of BFCFB ahead of that earnings report.

BFCFB is now even more undervalued than ever - but it's not alone in this
market where fear and distortions rule.

I enjoy reading this board, about the only one I still follow on SI. A couple
of stocks I own might be of interest: ACY, IN, ITXC, CTIC. I also own ELN which
garnered some attention a while back. I am watching DOX and RG. Longleaf took
positions in both, but I'll wait for tax loss season.

I have a question and am hoping someone can help. I have been looking for a
site where the betas are listed for particular stocks and indexes. Anyone know
where I can find this information?

CPN: Isn't really an NG story unless you count input of NG in the spark
spread...they are consumer of gas, producer of electricity. About 1/3 of their
forward production are unhedged...thus vulnerable to unfavorable spark spread.
Overlay that on high debt levels and you get a risky situation vulnerable to
weather conditions.

After considering DIS further, I've decided to open a very small position at
current price. My intent would be to lag in as the stock drops.

It's still a very expensive company based on p/e. I'm not so sure about
management either - their competence or whose interest they serve.

Perhaps it's almost always an expensive company - that brand and franchise are
so strong.

Hard for me to envision DIS not moving up from current levels if the stock
market recovers. OTOH, it IS hard for me to see the stock market recovering
-g-.

I think some here own TAA, which is getting clocked today.
I owned it, in a former life, as Montana Power - as a stable utility with a
solid, sustainable dividend (fortunately traded out, with a profit) . Those
days are over.
The ubiquitous Yahoo figures show BV of about $10 and cash slightly below $2
with no debt, prior to this Q's poor results. Stock is trading at about $1.10.
Any comments on how this one should be valued, cash burn, and whether this is
real BV?

TIA,
Wallace

Timba,

In a lot of ways I see issues with increasing default rates and record
bankruptcies as symptoms of the real problem. Too much debt. The practice of
individuals and companies figuring they can dig themselves out of debt by
borrowing more money just plain doesn't work. Somewhere along the line the debt
becomes due. The strong economic conditions of the 90s caused a lot of over
confidence in assuming debt. The cost of living was under control, unemployment
was low, wages were high, and the stock market was going to keep going up
forever. An instant replay of the roaring 20s as close as I can tell. It sets
up a model that can only be maintained under perfect economic conditions. A
slight wobble in the economy and the dominos start to fall. Consumers,
companies and governments got drunk on spending easy money credit, and when the
bubble finally burst, everyone was buried in debt.

Perhaps I'm looking too hard at the dark side, but I'm having a hard time
seeing anything likely to prevent a depression under current conditions. Over
$7 trillion in market cap has been eliminated from the economy, and even though
margin rules have changed since the 20s, that asset was still indirectly and
highly leveraged through accumulation of debt in other areas. Buy a house with
3% down, max out the Visa at 14%, take out a second at 9% when housing prices
go up, run up department store cards at 18%, then load up the 401K with mutual
funds.

IMO, the policy of easing over the past year in order stimulate spending has
only exaggerated the situation. Eventually a much lower standard of living will
have to be assumed to repay the debt. An instant replay of the 30s.

At any rate, the fact lenders are trying to find ways to reduce their exposure
to defaults is a pretty clear sign something is seriously wrong.

Wallace Rivers, re: TAA: Hard to have any trust in the business, in the
management team, or in the financials. I'd say for most people - that should be
three strikes and out.

Still, it looks like there's $280M in annualized revenue -- but who can tell?
They say they're sticking with their "disciplined business approach to improve
sales", but they sold (or recorded) $29M that they can't collect. Some
disciple. Overall results also don't give me much trust that management will
prudently use the cash they have.

I move TAA over from business to cigar butt. TAA is either going to recover
somewhat (but the stock may never get up to the price I got my buys) or it's
going BK. An either/or, imo.

I like to bet on recovery. I've already endured enough here for me though, so
now I'll just say I struck out.
I closed my position today.

I'm starting an exploratory position in WMI today.

Current price gives me an opportunity to enter this large cap company on a
"reasonable forward p/e". (given current market p/e compression, and given that
I'm no fan of forward earnings estimates)

I see new management's attempts to bring honesty to the business and to its
reporting. This was not done by the previous management (and their Arthur
Andersen auditors) .

I'm concerned that debt's still to high and that there's no revenue growth. I
haven't confirmed that Andersen will pay or has paid WMI the settlement amounts
it owes WMI and also those amounts that it owes jointly with WMI in other
lawsuit settlements. (I've not confirmed that if Andersen folds, WMI will be on
the hook for all the amounts.)

Still, WMI being the nation's largest waste disposal company suggests to me
that the business and future are there if WMI could get through some of its
current problems.
And that perhaps/maybe/I hope the stock might trade once again near its highs
of the past couple of years.

Try Multex Investor, under Ratio Comparison. I've got it through Yahoo (with
those advertising pop-ups, ugh).

Here's Disney for example:

Beta is fourth line down under Ratio Comparison.

Now a question or two for you or anyone else here: Have you found beta numbers
to be helpful to you? How do you use beta as regards your analyses or in making
your buys or sells?
