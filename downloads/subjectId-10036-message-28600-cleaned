How many of these things are out there? this is beginning to remind me of

Cheyne Finance SIV Won't Pay Debt as It Falls Due (Update2)

By Sebastian Boyd and Neil Unmack

Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Cheyne Finance Plc, the structured investment vehicle
managed by hedge fund Cheyne Capital Management Ltd., will stop paying its
debts, a receiver from Deloitte & Touche LLP said.

Deloitte is negotiating a refinancing of the SIV or a sale of its assets,
according to an e-mailed statement today. Cheyne Finance's debt with different
maturities will now be pooled together, rather than shorter term debt being
repaid sooner, Neville Kahn, a receiver from Deloitte said today in a telephone
interview.

``It doesn't mean we have to go out and fire-sell any assets, quite the
opposite in fact,' Kahn said. ``The paper that falls due today or tomorrow
won't be paid as it falls due.'

Cheyne Finance appointed receivers in September to oversee the management of
its assets after the SIV was forced to liquidate assets to repay maturing
commercial paper. SIVs have dumped about $75 billion of securities since July
after being unable to roll over their short-term debt, prompting the U.S.
Treasury to broker talks between Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co., the three largest U.S. banks, to create an $80 billion
fund to buy the assets.

SIVs, with $320 billion of assets, invest in securities from mortgage-backed
debt to bank bonds. They finance their investments by selling commercial paper,
debt that comes due in 270 days or less, and medium term notes, which mature in
nine months or longer.

Investors in the past three months have avoided asset-backed commercial paper
on concern that delinquency rates on home loans to people with bad credit will
continue to rise and hurt the value of mortgage bonds held by SIVs.

`Insolvency Event'

Cheyne issued $8 billion of short-term debt to buy securities linked to home
loans, according Moody's Investors Service.

The receivers declared an ``insolvency event,' Deloitte said. That means the
SIV is unable to pay its debts when they are due, according to its prospectus.

Moody's cut the SIV's top credit ratings on Oct. 4 by as many as 12 levels to
Ba3, three steps below investment grade, citing the deterioration in the market
value of Cheyne's portfolio.

London-based Cheyne Capital was set up in 1999 by Stuart Fiertz and Jonathan
Lourie, two former Morgan Stanley bankers. The hedge-fund manager oversees
about $12 billion in funds investing in both debt and equity markets.

``We are very pleased with the progress being made to implement a financing or
a whole-book solution of which we are in advanced negotiations,' Kahn said in
the statement. ``Today's determination has not had a detrimental effect on
these negotiations and we have no need for immediate liquidation of assets in
the book.'

Kahn is one of three Deloitte receivers working on Cheyne Finance, with Nick
Edwards and Nick Dargan.

``In our view people should not take this as a precedent for other SIVs,' he
said.

I think Mike has about 500 mil. under management in his hedge fund. That is
from memory a year or so back, so that figure is in flux.
Your post made me wonder how he is faring recently, given the turmoil in the

He started from a very small base, so to be at about a half a billion is quite
a testament to him.

Maybe Jim Clarke could fill us in, or perhaps Mike would like to share with us

Unfortunately, I suspect Michael isn't really able to talk much publicly these
days. He does have to file with the SEC, so here is a link to his latest 13F:

An interesting list. Lots of energy + Google means he should be doing okay. The
only one on the list that would be a potential investment for me is Quiksilver
(and maybe Nexen for some portfolio specific reasons). Quiksilver never seemed
like a good value investment to me, especially because I tend to avoid growth
companies with significant debt, but maybe it deserves more than the cursory
look I've given it in the past.

The one I don't get is Overstock. He may very well be doing okay with it,
depending on when he bought, but I don't see the value proposition. Forget the
ridiculous naked shorting stuff - you have a business model that doesn't scale
well, a well funded, nimble, and dominant competitor, and a CEO with a history
of making promises that don't pan out and who is currently under investigation
by the SEC. However, Michael is a lot smarter than I am, and I'm sure he's
looked at it a lot more closely than I have, so what do I know?

I own a position. Realize that it is valued for high probability of bankruptcy
right now. It is somewhat surprising, since SPF has better balance sheet than
BZH or WCI and these stocks held up much better. (BZH technically even violated
loan covenants, but still it's holding up). Either someone knows something or
the somewhat-toxic convertible deal is to blame or it's a lemming run.

At this time, I would suggest to buy a package like ITB instead of a single

CHME. I'm still considering.

If this company is primarily a distributor, and I value it like I value other
distributors (such as wholesale electronic component or retail stuff), then
this stock is not a buy for me.

CHME's business doesn't seem comparable to medical supply/drug distributors
like CAH, ABC, MHS. CHME has lower p/e, much higher profit margins, and thus
also a much higher price/sales ratio.

Company does seem to have a number of nice positives. They have a supply chain
in place (suppliers and customers), a large number of items, some key products,
and are in the apparently insatiable Chinese market. (And additionally, all
this could be a positive for an acquirer or consolidator.)

My limited experience with CHME's kind of business is that it can be lumpy due
to inventory stocking and changing customer demand. Furthermore, the negatives
expressed here by others seem very valid.

That all said, IF profit margins can be maintained and sales hold up, then at a
p/e of 12 ($3.60/.30), I conclude the stock can be a small buy - for me anyway.

I'll take a few shares at current price.

IMO, 1 month puts are just a very risky bet and not a portfolio insurance. You
are not only making a debatable macro call - that US economy is bad - but you
are also timing it to a very short period of time. Your money though.

BTW, I am not sure what "portfolio insurance" means in general. IMO 99% of it
is money thrown away. If you don't see a reason to invest or think something is
overvalued, sell it. Or buy something else. Or at least do a reasonable DD. I
really doubt you calculated the probability of US going into recession,
probability of that happening in November, probability of S&P dropping to 900
or whatever, how much it would affect your portfolio and then bought the needed
amount of "insurance". I can bet that you looked at the sky, said "maybe it's
going to rain" and then plunged a wad of cash for an expensive umbrella that
will dissolve in a month.

Real insurance is the stuff BRKA guys do and even they miss sometimes. The wild

Re: TX

Does "value" mean "patience" at some level?

Below is an excerpt of the Deutsche Bank report (fair use) that took the stock
out of her lethargy for a nice breakout on solid volume. These guys were right
on the money downgrading TX back in January because of Chavez fears. They are
hopefully right again.

Positive outlook for steel. After meaningful changes in DB's commodity
price outlook we've upgraded our steel forecasts. We are now expecting
benchmark steel prices in the U.S. and Europe to rise between 3% and 4%
in 2008. Our U.S. HRC forecasts are $584/tonne for 2007 and $601/tonne
for 2008.
Forecasting EPS of US$4.68/ADR in 2007 and US$4.97/ADR in 2008.
These estimates reflect our steel price outlook and now its recent acquisition
of IMSA which should be accretive to earnings in '08. TX hasn't detailed
the synergy potential from IMSA but we eventually expect the savings to
exceed $50MM. This synergy assumption is included in our model.
Upgrade to Buy (from Hold). TX has underperformed, but we now think
it is "too cheap" to ignore. Its Venezuela risk will not go away, but we see
Sidor as a valuable asset. We think it is more appropriate to use NPV or EV/
EBITDA to value Ternium. Excluding Sidor, we estimate that its remaining
operations are trading at 5x '08E EBITDA and are worth $35-37/share using
6x EBITDA and our NPV analysis. Our new target price is $40 which discounts
our full valuation (+Sidor) by 10% to 20%.
Key risks are slower economic growth and metal prices, that TX will continue
to operate in Venezuela and if not will receive value for its assets, ability
to integrate IMSA and achieve expected synergies and earnings contribution,
higher than expected raw material costs, and foreign exchange rates
that do not match DB forecasts given the scale of its operations throughout
Latin America.

Actually, most advice on any insurance says that you should not insure at all
(if you can afford it), because bets are skewed towards the insurer most of the
time. There are occasions when they are not, for example, there was a period of
time when auto insurance was underpriced due to price war. But most of the
time, insurance is overpriced.

In case of property, you are required to insure if you have mortgage. In case
of liability, balloon insurance is usually worthwhile to cap costs. In case of
health, you may be required to hold it (soon?). Actually, health insurance is
the only one where you are continuously getting the benefits.

The problem of spending .15% of portfolio is that over a year it is 1.8% of the
portfolio and soon you are talking real money. ;) And it is not even clear how
much and what kind of protection this .15% buys. ;)

In any case, it would be good to calculate the benefit and the cost of the
insurance beforehand, but few (none?) of us do it. :/

In a recent 13D filing with the SEC, the Clinton Group, a $1 billion money
manager, suggested ways the Steve Madden Shoe company might optimize its cash.
Whether Steve Madden will follow the advice, we can't say. But we liked the
letter because it shows why buying cash-laden stocks is often a great bet:

"The Company has substantial, unrestricted cash balance, which we estimate will
grow to be at least $90 million by year end, representing approximately 22% of
the current market capitalization. Clearly, this is an inefficient capital
structure given the Company's free cash flow generation, ongoing strong
earnings, and limited capital expenditure requirements. We believe that $72
million of this cash, combined with a modest senior debt financing of $110
million, could be used to purchase 40% of the outstanding shares of the
Company, resulting in pro forma leverage of 1.5x net debt to 2007E EBITDA. The
Company could execute such a buyback at a range above $21.00 per share or a
13.5% premium to current market prices. The extraordinary accretion from this
transaction produces implied stock prices well north of current levels and a
premium to our proposed tender price of greater than 20%."

that this tidy sum is not enough, for the last quarter they added almost 1B$ to
reserves.

I think that based on the above the streak if dividend increases has to come to

Old Republic standing solid
CEO Zucaro in the front line of the battle enveloping the American housing
market
BY TED PINCUS / Chicago Tribune Oct 9, 2007

One ray of sunshine in the current credit crunch comes from a man who sits
precisely where you wouldn't want to be these days -- as one of the major
mortgage insurers.

Chicago's Al Zucaro is there, and he's been there before. "Believe me, this is
no picnic," he tells me, "but it's no disaster either." Zucaro's company, Old
Republic International (NYSE: ORI) is now the 36th largest public company in
Chicago, one of the nation's largest property/casualty insurers and among the
top five in the scary category of mortgage insurance. Those are the folks who
stand behind the lenders who issue first mortgages on homes, ready to protect
them against losses on defaults.

Thus today Zucaro is at the front lines of the struggle within the U.S. housing
market. While operating revenues from his Mortgage Guaranty Division were up 9
percent for the first half of this year to $286 million (out of $1.9 billion in
total six-month revenues), the division's profitability sagged 31 percent to
$85 million and appears headed south. That's because, as one of the leading
bellwethers of trouble in home defaults, the mortgage insurers are seeing
mounting delinquencies and a 1.34 percent foreclosure rate, up from 1.05
percent last year.

For the first half, Zucaro experienced a mortgage guarantee claims ratio of
60.3 percent vs. 37.2 percent in last year's first half. His mortgage
delinquency ratio has crept up to 4.36 percent from 4.08 last year. Still, the
company has fearlessly written another $20.5 billion in new mortgage coverage
this year vs. $12.7 billion last year.

There are numerous reasons why Zucaro is still sleeping well at night despite
the headlines. "First," he says, "while we face tough times in that market for
the next 18 months, it will not be nearly the storm faced in the '30s (Old
Republic is 84 years old) when foreclosures were widespread, nor even in the
'80s when inflation was high, California and the Oil Patch imploded, and
insurer loss ratios soared to over 150 percent on mortgage guaranty. This time
we're not likely to reach even 90 percent."

The second factor he says is that Old Republic has written very little
sub-prime mortgage coverage. "However, we know that even our quality mortgages
will suffer some collateral damage because whatever foreclosures we do have
will meet a very soft market for home disposition."

Third and most important: Old Republic has a prodigious cushion. Mortgage
insurance has averaged only 40 percent of its pretax income, with the balance
derived from general liability insurance (48 percent), where it ranks third in
the nation, and title insurance (12 percent) where it ranks fifth.

Moreover, it has a remarkably strong balance sheet, with assets of $12.7
billion and shareholder equity of $4.5 billion. Claim reserves total another
hefty $5.7 billion. The rating agencies give it the highest marks and its title
insurance group has held the industry's highest rating for 14 consecutive
years.

All this has been by design, and isn't surprising when you realize that it was
conceived by the accountant who formerly audited its books. Born in Grenoble,
France, Zucaro, 68, became the audit partner of Coopers & Lybrand, Chicago, on
the Old Republic account. Persuaded to join in 1976 as executive VP and CFO, he
soon saw the need to diversify from credit life and disability underwriting and
begin to tap emerging opportunities in property/casualty.

Becoming CEO in 1990, he began a transformation so aggressive that today not
one of the former coverages is even offered by the company. While other
insurers might have grown faster and flashier, few have done it more steadily
or safely. Old Republic has been able to raise its cash dividend every year for
25 consecutive years, and Zucaro is confident the cushion will permit him to
continue the pattern.

Wall Street seems to concur that the damage might be minor and temporary. The
analyst consensus says earnings per share will fall from $1.94 last year to
$1.73 this year, and perhaps be a bit weaker next year before recovering.
Zucaro doesn't quarrel with this assessment. The best indicator is that
investors are supporting the stock at the $19 level, down from the $23 high and
up from the 52 week low of $11. Maybe the old tortoise has some speed in
reserve.

SHOO: Good gain today for anyone who bought lower...

Today I reevaluated a bit of my positions and possible buys:
- Sold MTH and bought ITB with proceeds. I think that my evaluation of
companies in this sector is not as good at the index. Still have SPF and MDC.
- Sold BSX on jump up. IMO they are not out of the woods, the results are bad
and the future is cloudy. I would like to hear if anyone has a different
opinion about this company. The fundamental thesis that it trades below
Guidant's acquisition value is still true, but the acquisition did not pan out
and BSX core business is soft, so maybe that valuation is not so attractive.
- Bought CHS position. Possibly too early, but it seems attractive.
- Passed on buying BLDR. Too many chips in the housebuilding sector already.
May buy it later.
- Passed on buying TUES. I am not sure what differentiation it has from its
competitors. Results declining for 2 years already, so it's probably not only
the current downturn that is affecting the company. I am afraid that it may
turn into PIR kind of situation although their balance sheet is clean for now.
Again, any opinions appreciated.
- Still passing on OSG as discussed before.
- Hold HOG. Like the results, but the price is still not very low to buy a lot.
- Thinking what to do with XEC. This is an underperforming mostly gas play. The
company is cheap, but their results so far are not very exciting. Not sure if I
should sell it and add to IGE index instead. Opinions welcome. BTW, I read some
sell-side analyst reports in the oil-gas area and apparently the research is
dominated by

1.34M shares issued (the remainder is in the MHC) and 18.25M shares outstanding
-> effective book value 13.6$/share 9not counting MHC shares that will be
issued a few years down the road). This is a regional bank stock i am not going
to sell.

XEC, Kurt has been bullish on XEC for a couple of years. He sometimes get's it
right and sometimes he doesn't. It is in fact one of the cheaper NG stocks,
with a valuation of about 2.5$/mcfe in the ground.

FWIW I am very bullish on North American NG. The gap to oil keeps on widening,
with gas at 6$/mcfe, the energy cost /BTU is only 425 of the equivalent value
for oil. Can this continue LT - i think not. I don't own much in this space,
what is the best way to play on NA NG. I do not like many of the producers that
much. Perhaps the shovel plays are better, i down own some NBR, CPX and GW and
think about stocking up those positions.

This is the stuff that scares me, as an ex-credit guy I find it incredible that
anyone would put together a package like that and try to sell it, that the
rating agency could rate any portion of this stuff tiple-A, and that fund
managers were so naive as to believe these ratings. There will be many innocent
people relying on fiduciaries to protect them who suffer severe losses because
of this. I would not want to own any of the rating agencies, I think they will
be sued to the moon over these flawed rating, which im sure no credit guy would
knowingly invest a dime of his own money in, I also think all the investment
banks will face lawsuits galore over this stuff. it will probably take a decade
to sort this all out. meanwhile im trying to make sure my short term funds are
either in fdic banks or tbills.

GSAMP Trust 2006-S3

A PIGMAN Story

In the spring of 2006, Goldman assembled 8,274 second-mortgage loans originated
by Fremont Investment & Loan, Long Beach Mortgage Co., and assorted other
players. More than a third of the loans were in California, then a hot market.
It was a run-of-the-mill deal, one of the 916 residential mortgage-backed
issues totaling $592 billion that were sold last year.

The average equity that the second-mortgage borrowers had in their homes was
0.71%. (No, that's not a misprint - the average loan-to-value of the issue's
borrowers was 99.29%.)

It gets even hinkier. Some 58% of the loans were no-documentation or
low-documentation. This means that although 98% of the borrowers said they were
occupying the homes they were borrowing on - "owner-occupied" loans are
considered less risky than loans to speculators - no one knows if that was
true. And no one knows whether borrowers' incomes or assets bore any serious
relationship to what they told the mortgage lenders.

You can see why borrowers lined up for the loans, even though they carried high
interest rates. If you took out one of these second mortgages and a typical 80%
first mortgage, you got to buy a house with essentially none of your own money
at risk. If house prices rose, you'd have a profit. If house prices fell and
you couldn't make your mortgage payments, you'd get to walk away with nothing
(or almost nothing) out of pocket. It was go-go finance, very 21st century.

Goldman acquired these second-mortgage loans and put them together as GSAMP
Trust 2006-S3. To transform them into securities it could sell to investors, it
divided them into tranches - which is French for "slices," in case you're
interested.

In this case, Goldman sliced the $494 million of second mortgages into 13
separate tranches. The $336 million of top tranches - named cleverly A-1, A-2,
and A-3 - carried the lowest interest rates and the least risk. The $123
million of intermediate tranches - M (for mezzanine) 1 through 7 - are next in
line to get paid and carry progressively higher interest rates.

Finally, Goldman sold two non-investment-grade tranches. The first, B-1 ($13
million), went to the Luxembourg-based UBS (Charts) Absolute Return fund, which
is aimed at non-U.S. investors and thus spread GSAMP's problems beyond our
borders. The second, B-2 ($8 million), went to the Morgan Keegan Select High
Income fund. (Like most of this article, this information is based on our
reading of various public filings; UBS and Morgan Keegan both declined to
comment.)

Even though the individual loans in GSAMP looked like financial toxic waste,
68% of the issue, or $336 million, was rated AAA by both agencies - as secure
as U.S. Treasury bonds. Another $123 million, 25% of the issue, was rated
investment grade, at levels from AA to BBB--.

Thus, a total of 93% was rated investment grade. That's despite the fact that
this issue is backed by second mortgages of dubious quality on homes in which
the borrowers (most of whose income and financial assertions weren't vetted by
anyone) had less than 1% equity and on which GSAMP couldn't effectively
foreclose.

These loans, which are fixed-rate, carried an average interest rate of 10.51%.
After paying the people who collected the payments and handled all the other
paperwork, the GSAMP Trust had ten percentage points left. However, the
interest on the securities that GSAMP issued ran to only about 7%. (We say
"about" because some of the tranches are floating-rate rather than fixed-rate.)

The difference between GSAMP's interest income and interest expense was
projected at 2.85% a year. That spread was supposed to provide a cushion to
offset defaults by borrowers. In addition, the aforementioned X piece didn't
get fixed monthly payments and thus provided another bit of protection for the
12 tranches ranked above it.

Remember that we're dealing with securities, not actual loans. Thus losses
aren't shared equally by all of GSAMP's investors. Any loan losses would first
hit the X tranche. Then, if X were wiped out, the losses would work their way
up the food chain tranche by tranche: B-2, B-1, M-7, and so on.

The $241 million A-1 tranche, 60% of which has already been repaid, was
designed to be supersafe and quick-paying. It gets first dibs on principal
paydowns from regular monthly payments, refinancings, and borrowers paying off
their loans because they're selling their homes. Then, after A-1 is paid in
full, it's the turn of A-2 and A-3, and so on down the line.

Moody's projected in a public analysis of the issue that less than 10% of the
loans would ultimately default. S&P, which gave the securities the same ratings
that Moody's did, almost certainly reached a similar conclusion but hasn't
filed a public analysis and wouldn't share its numbers with us. As long as
housing prices kept rising, it all looked copacetic.

Goldman peddled the securities in late April 2006. In a matter of months the
mathematical models used to assemble and market this issue - and the models
that Moody's and S&P used to rate it - proved to be horribly flawed. That's
because the models were based on recent performances of junk-mortgage
borrowers, who hadn't defaulted much until last year thanks to the housing
bubble.

As a second-mortgage holder, GSAMP couldn't foreclose on deadbeats unless the
first-mortgage holder also foreclosed. That's because to foreclose on a second
mortgage, you have to repay the first mortgage in full, and there was no money
set aside to do that. So if a borrower decided to keep on paying the first
mortgage but not the second, the holder of the second would get bagged.

If the holder of the first mortgage foreclosed, there was likely to be little
or nothing left for GSAMP, the second-mortgage holder. Indeed, the monthly
reports issued by Deutsche Bank (Charts), the issue's trustee, indicate that
GSAMP has recovered almost nothing on its foreclosed loans.

By February 2007, Moody's and S&P began downgrading the issue. Both agencies
dropped the top-rated tranches all the way to BBB from their original AAA,
depressing the securities' market price substantially.

In March, less than a year after the issue was sold, GSAMP began defaulting on
its obligations. By the end of September, 18% of the loans had defaulted,
according to Deutsche Bank.

As a result, the X tranche, both B tranches, and the four bottom M tranches
have been wiped out, and M-3 is being chewed up like a frame house with
termites. At this point, there's no way to know whether any of the A tranches
will ultimately be impaired.

Goldman said it made money in the third quarter by shorting an index of
mortgage-backed securities. That prompted Fortune to ask the firm to explain to
us how it had managed to come out ahead while so many of its mortgage-backed
customers were getting stomped.

Goldman's profits came from hedging the mortgage securities it keeps in
inventory in order to make trading markets. It said in a recent SEC filing,
"Although we recognized significant losses on our non-prime mortgage loans and
securities, those losses were more than offset by gains on short mortgage
positions."

As we interpret this - the firm declined to elaborate - Goldman made more on
its hedges than it lost on its inventory because junk mortgages fell even more
sharply than Goldman thought they would.

I sold my MGI and took the proceeds to purchase more WU. After listening to the
MGI CC, their earnings were great, but Fitch downgraded them over concerns of
the sub-prime mortgages. What bothered me from the CC is that they have maxed
out their credit lines.

One of the major concerns in the money transfer business is that it will be
circumvented using cell phones. Also on Friday, WU issued a press release
concerning their agreement with GSM providers.

http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUKN1844397220071018?rpc=44

Pricing will be the key issue here. But it looks like WU is positioning itself
to gain market share in what still is a fragmented industry.

Furthermore another agreement was reached with Google as reported in Barrons a
few weeks ago. Below is the article.

THERE ARE TWO MAIN knocks on Western Union (WU), neither one new. The first is
that a federal immigration crackdown will crimp money transfers back home from
foreign-born U.S. residents. The other is that emerging online and cellphone
payment technologies will eat into volumes on its transfer-agent network.

An unpublicized deal for Google to pay for Western Union money transfers for
its AdSense members in nine South American and Asian countries (including
China) argues against the latter concern. Quietly, Google has begun offering
the Western Union payment option to owners of Websites sharing in Google ad
revenue, who typically are paid with checks that can be lost or stolen.

Though the financial impact of the effort is unclear for Western Union, this
represents incremental business in a fast-growing segment not now built into
Street assumptions.

Even though WU has over 270,000 agents in over 200 countries, it only has a 15%
market share in a fragmented market. I believe that it is concolidating its
position by building partnerships with other technological threats to the money
transfer business. With its $1 billion in annual operating cash flow the
company will be able to reduce its $3.5 billion in debt and repurchase stock.

Paul, time to buy more CIT. They took another charge on their Mortgage
portfolio and now have charge off about 10% or 1 bill. But this has to be the
end unlike Wash Mut. since they have now sold it for the most part thru
securitization of a non-recourse nature. They said they had fenced it.The rest
of their business is doing well including Factoring-tradefinance, vendor
finance, plane leasing, train car leasing, and corporate finance loans. These
businesses generated 1.30 per share in the last two quarters and should do 1.40
IMO going forward. Since charges are over , street should move stock up. They
sold converts with a mandatory conversion at $42- 14 mill shares for 600mill in
proceeds. Their book value is about 35 and tangible book at 28. Wash mutual has
a book closer to 18 with more charges to come. I think CIT is the play if you

The technological threat exists already. With Paypal, you can send money to 190
countries for very little fees. All you need is a bank account for the sender
and an email address for both sender and received. Does sound to me as if the
technological barrier amounts to a molehill. Cellphone could presumably even
work without banking connection at all for both sender and receiver. Sure WU
could offer this service as well but it is unlikely that they will be able to
charger their fairly substantial fees in this space, IMO.

There is also Walmart which is fairly ubiquitous in both US and Mexico and
could make this a business. Again there would be no banking relationship needed
whatsoever and WMT even could use this service as a loss leader to get people
in it's stores.

securities will keep paying for the ratings but I dont know how long that will
last. Cause if Im the head of investment group, or a money manager I sure dont
want to hear about their ratings anymore I want the analyst to do his/her own
analysis before I buy in.

Sorry, but there is no way to justify an AAA rating on the deal that I
described. It is nonsense to base a rating only on what happened historically
for a brief period of time and not apply common sense and what-if scenarios.
Just like you wouldnt immediately put money with a money manager who had a
terrific track record for 3 years because he was 100% invested in energy

Usually I lurk here, but WU was on my watch list until recently...

Future competition for WU is not just from PayPal. I see regular credit card
companies leveraging their data network, technology, and distribution points to
move "regular" money. "Prepaid" credit cards are a great way of sending money
home. A money order through WU costs what, $10 a shot?

In a related way, PayPal and MasterCard already have a program where you can
get a MasterCard to withdraw money from your PayPal balance - it works anywhere
MasterCard is accepted and there are no transaction fees for the end consumer.

(I've got one, for my small business, and I use it to pay for USD expenses. As
a Canadian that gets USD from web sales, it's annoying to constantly pay
currency exchange. Especially since I used to pay currency exchange both ways,
buying USD for expenses done on the Visa, and selling USD to bring the PayPal
balance home...)

"The technological threat exists already."

Certainly Paypal has been around for a while. But that is not to say that WU
isn't gaining market share. The company's share of the global remittance market
has risen from roughly 10% in 2004 to about 17%-18% in 2006.

With the alliances WU is creating, they will most certainly relinquish a
percentage of their profit margins. But I believe that they address a expanding
world trend. Below is a quote from a recent JMP research report.

"The global remittance business is still the beneficiary of one of the
strongest secular trends today, namely the fluidity of the world's population.
According to studies conducted by the United Nations, there were 191 million
people in 2005 living in countries other than their country of origin. This
migrant population is forecast to reach more than 280 million by 2050, and the
growth in migration fuels a steady and consistent increase in global
remittances.

Major emigrant countries, such as China, India, Mexico and the Philippines, are
contributing to the growth of unbanked and underbanked consumers in the
developed economies of the U.S. and Western Europe, the primary immigrant
locations."

Interesting that you mentioned Walmart. WU recently signed an agreement with
Walmart of Canada. MGI has an agreement with Walmart in the USA. I believe that
Walmart deciding to form alliances with the two largest money transfer agents
rather do it on their own indicates there is resilience to WU's business model.

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/071016/20071016005844.html?.v=1

I think cell phones is the primary techno-threat, but my previous post
addressed my view of that issue. As far as Paypal is concerned, I think that is
out of the range of the typical WU customer. Below is a quote from an interview
with Shawn Kravetz, founder and president, Esplanade Capital who has had a
fairly good track record.

"They are the leader in global money transfer, providing people around the
world with easy and trustworthy ways to send money. They have 300,000 agent
locations in 200 countries. It provides an absolutely vital service. We think
it is underappreciated because Wall Street has an Internet view of the world,
which is, why not use PayPal and credit cards to send money? But a lot of
Western Union customers don't have access to e-mail or a computer or a bank,
for that matter. When they were preparing to be spun out by First Data, we were
astonished at their returns on capital, their cash-flow generation, their 30%
profit margins. Historically, this has been a very solid and a
low-double-digit-growth business. Nice and boring and immensely profitable. But
because of the costs of becoming a public company and some short-term
disruption in the Mexican market, an important market for them, and some
headline risk on immigration reform, we think the stock now presents an
opportunity."

lifted from another post:

WSJ: “The high stakes plan to RESCUE BANKS FROM LOSSES on mortgage securities
amounts to a big bet that a consortium of financial giants—AT THE PRODDING OF
THE US GOVERNMENT—can PERSUADE INVESTORS TO POUR MORE MONEY INTO THE TROUBLED
CREDIT MARKET.”

That's right; the Treasury Dept is directly involved in a scam that saves the
banks while trying to “persuade” investors to “pour more money” into toxic
mortgage-backed sludge. Treasury Dept officials clearly have a different idea
of “moral hazard” than the rest of us.

The banks are presently holding hundreds of billions of dollars in
mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) that they cannot sell—because there are no
buyers ---and don't want to take back on their balance sheets because they'll
be forced to increase their capital reserves. So they've decided to launch a
public relations campaign to promote some goofy-sounding fund, called the
“Master-Liquidity Enhancement Conduit” or M-LEC, which will allow the banks to
place their unwanted bonds in Limbo until some future date when the public
appetite for garbage CDOs improves.

The WSJ does a good job of disguising the real motive behind the new
“Super-Conduit” (aka the Bailout fund) but in the last paragraph, buried in
Section C-3, they reveal the truth:

“The goal is to reassure investors and make them more willing to buy its
short-term debt.” So, the fund is really just a way of rearranging the
marketplace until the next crop of gullible investors sprouts up and buys more
mortgage-backed garbage.

Where are the regulators? The SEC and Treasury should be forcing the banks to
be straightforward with the public and let them know about the hanky-panky
they've been up to with their risky SIVs (structured investment vehicles)
Citigroup alone has nearly $80 billion in off-balance sheets operations which
are in distress. The bank accounts for “25% of the global SIV market. As of
August, assets held by SIVs totaled $400 billion”.

SIVs are set up as a way to make money without taking the risk onto their
balance sheets. “They issue their own short-term debt, usually at relatively
low rates …then use the proceeds to buy higher yielding assets such as
securities tied to mortgages.” (WSJ)

Ever since Bear Stearns blew up in late July, investors have been steering
clear of any securities connected to real estate, which means the SIVs are
getting the Double Whammy---they can't sell their asset-backed commercial paper
(because it's mortgage-backed) and they find buyers for their collateralized
debt obligations. (CDOs) To a large extent, the market is still frozen despite
the upbeat cheerleading on the business pages. Clearly, the worst is yet to
come.

How bad is it?

An article in yesterday's Financial Times said that, “Only $9.9 billion of home
equity loan securitizations have come to market since July 1---A 95% DECLINE
FROM THE $200.9 BILLION IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR AND A ROUGHLY 92%
DECREASE FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.”

The banks are in trouble. Big trouble. Main sources of revenue have dried up
overnight and they're stuck with hundreds of billions of debt. That's why the
papers broke the story on Saturday when there was NO chance of triggering a
stock market CRASH.

Imagine the horror of investors around the world when they discover that the
major investment banks are running these shabby “off-balance sheets” operations
while concealing their real financial condition from their investors. Consider
the disgust the public feels when they see Treasury officials bailing out the
banks instead of ordering them to report their losses and get on with business.

Still, Wall Street nonchalantly leaps from one swindle to the next never
considering the damage it's doing to the credibility of the market.

Susan Pulliam summed it up like this in the Oct 12 edition of The Wall Street
Journal:

“Since the invention of the ticker tape 140 years ago, America has been able to
boast of having the world's most transparent financial markets. The tape and
its electronic descendants ensured that crystal-clear prices for stocks and
many other securities were readily available to everyone, encouraging millions
to entrust their money to the markets. These days, after a decade of frantic
growth in mortgage-backed securities and other complex investments traded off
exchanges, that clarity is gone. Large parts of American financial markets have
become a hall of mirrors.”

The poster then goes on to quote a times article saying that the conduit will
only purchase AAA rated stuff- thats very reassuring! where do i sign up to
invest?

Just because YOU or a savvy investor(s) will not use Moody's ratings in the
future, it does not mean that others won't. Like in any situation there are two
possibilities: either you do your own DD, or you rely on an outside agency. 90%
- perhaps 95% - of people do not have time, interest or acumen to do their own
DD and they WILL rely on agency ratings in the future as they did in the past.
The only things that you could argue against Moody's and S&P are two:

- they will collapse and be sued to the ground. Like Paul said, this is
unlikely. Although we know what happened to Andersen and IMHO that company was
no more at fault than Moody's/S&P. But I am not a lawyer, etc.

- a new agency will appear untainted by past ratings and people will switch to
it. This is again very unlikely, but if such agency were to appear, NOW is the
time for it to start issuing recommendations. ;)

I hold a small position in MCO. I am not sure I will increase it - it will

 Yes, maybe they will be so sued. It's not relevant to their stocks though
(imo). 

it will be relevant if the damages that MCO is going to be sued are significant
to their market cap. Since the losses from CDO and such stuff are going to be
staggering ( a few 100B$, I think), it is conceivable that the lawsuits would
sink MCO and the like.

 They agencies will argue - imo successfully - that they gave good faith
estimates; they have had nothing to gain by intentionally issuing wrong calls;
they are raters which means they offer opinions; they are not people who are
promisors or guarantors; and they made reasonable conclusions with the info
they had at the time to make the opinions they made. <i/>

This case is different then Enron. With Enron MCO had not much to fear because
they had no or very little inside information. But is is notable that Arthur
Anderson, which helped Enron to fabricate their numbers went under because of
their liability involved with Enron. I believe the situation that the rating
agencies are finding themselves in, is much more like Arthur Anderson in Enrons
case. MCO ratings were developed with the issues of those now infamous papers.
They were paid with the issuers and a significant part of their revenue stream
depended on this business. They developed the rules of the game and they did
the rating. Without them, there probably would not be a market for those CDO
papers. So I think they will get sued for substantial amounts of money, right
fully so in my opinion.

Oh, they'll get sued; that's a given. But will they (MCO, others) lose the

(evaluation) as far as I can tell. And there was no conspiracy. Or if so, how
is that going to be proved?

Even if a company says they rely - solely or totally - on a rating agency for
an opinion and that is the only measure of safety that these resource-rich,
sophisticated companies (the JPM's, the mort. reits, all the banks who bought
subprime) use, I do not see how the rating agency will have to pay $ to anyone
of these who bought Subprime/Alt. just because the rating company issued in
good faith, a rating which subsequently proved to be incorrect.

Yes, MCO got revenue and profit for issuing those opinions. I would like to see
how someone could show that MCO purposely, illegally, and/or improperly issued
ratings to drive that revenue, knowing that long-term, an intentionally false
rating would come back to haunt them and ultimately cost more than any
short-term benefit. Perhaps it is in the insider sales. I do not know.

"Many of Moody’s ratings for subprime debt represent ‘shoddy goods’ according
to Joseph Mann, a professor of finance at Drexel University. In a paper
co-written with Joshua Rosner, an independent research analyst, Prof. Mason
argues that the ratings agencies — including Standard & Poor’s Corp. and Fitch
Ratings, as well as Moody’s — are deeply involved with investment bank
underwriters in structuring pools of assets, which places them in a more active
role than simply publishing opinions on the creditworthiness of underlying
assets.

"In past lawsuits that have involved corporate debt ratings, judges have ruled
that such rankings are opinions, like newspaper editorials, and are protected
under the First Amendment. But, if lawyers can convince a judge that Moody’s
debt ratings shouldn’t be treated as opinions, the company could be hurt by
lawsuits.

"The argument against rating agencies appears to be gaining traction, at least
in Ohio. The state’s attorney-general, Marc Dann, is investigating the role of
the credit rating firms.

"Moody’ says it can’t be held responsible for drops in market values of certain
assets, ‘Our ratings predict the probability of default. We do not offer views
on market pricing,’ says Linda Huber, chief financial officer at Moody’s.
‘People enter the market and trade these securities at their own risk.’

"To date, Moody’s hasn’t been sued in federal court on any of its subline
credit ratings, which constituted around 6% of its revenue last year. And while
structured finance ratings made up 43% of its total revenue last year, another
40% came from non-US revenue, where there is also strong growth.

i would agree that moodys isnt responsible for the drop in a price of an asset
but they are responsible when the default rate becomes enormous relative to a
AAA rated credit. Someone finally explained to me the scam behind the Master
SIV. they will purchase AAA rated deals at 94% + a 4% note. The whole point of
this is to set a price for these securities so that they dont have to mark them
down , irrespective to what has happened to default rates etc. It will be
interesting to see whether the treasury provides the funds for this venture. I
Somehow cant see the banks themselves using their own capital to put $100
billion into this. Meanwhile the banks seem to be the one area recovering

The banks could well decide that investing $100 billion in their collective

then picking up the pieces later. I have no doubt that Washington would pat
them on the back and offer to help any way they can, since the political
fallout from a crash is equally bad for incumbents.

It certainly amounts to a market distortion, but perhaps one in most players'

Fool on DDS:

A Retail Stock in the Bargain Bin
By Emil Lee October 22, 2007

Like most value investors, I'm a big fan of investing in companies with
unappreciated real estate value. While retail store sales can be subject to the
whims of fads, weather, and gas prices, often the underlying real estate
steadily and consistently increases in value. Thus, I became very interested in
Dillard's (NYSE: DDS), a department-store operator with substantial real estate
holdings.

Shares on sale
In the past year alone, Dillard's shares have sunk from a high of $40 to less
than $22. The company has performed terribly, and lagging sales caused the
company to post a loss in the most recent quarter.

Entrenched management
In the past, Dillard's was an efficient performer with a watchful eye on
expenses and strong returns on capital. In 1997, Dillard's generated roughly
$694 million of EBITDA with 270 stores. Its advertising costs and its selling,
general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of sales were about
24%. Fast-forward to 2006, when Dillard's generated about $562 million of
EBITDA with 328 stores and had advertising and SG&A costs as a percentage of
sales of about 27%.

So Dillard's now generates less cash flow with more stores and a more bloated
cost structure. That 3-percentage-point increase in expenses is unacceptable in
the low-margin department-store industry.

So what happened? In 1998, William Dillard II took over as CEO from his father,
who founded the company. In 1998, Dillard's also undertook its largest
acquisition ever, of Mercantile Stores.

The next year results were disappointing, and to management's credit, Dillard's
bought back shares that it thought were undervalued as the stock plummeted.
Following the acquisition, the company took numerous impairment charges to
close stores and never really got back on track. In fact, shares still trade at
a large discount to their share price in 1998.

Still, the biggest mark against the company is that the Dillard clan controls
the company through ownership of class B shares, and that ownership allows them
to elect two-thirds of the board members.

A retail catalyst
However, it's not all bad. Dillard's owns an enormous amount of prime retail
real estate under its stores. At the end of 2006, Dillard's owned 241 of its
stores outright. Based on Dillard's 56.5 million in gross square footage, I
estimate (on a pro rata basis) that the company owns 41.5 million square feet
of real estate. 

As we all know, Eddie Lampert famously made billions investing in Kmart -- now
a part of Sears Holdings -- thanks to its vast real estate properties. Could
this be a similar situation?

Based on Dillard's $3.1 billion enterprise value (market cap plus net debt), I
calculate that anyone buying Dillard's shares would be paying $75 per square
foot of owned real estate ($3.1 billion/41.5 million).

In this weekend's Barron's, an article argued that Sears Holdings was cheap
because the stock market valued Sears' real estate at $33 per square foot
(based on enterprise value/average square feet). The article pointed out that
comparables such as Inside Value selection Home Depot (NYSE: HD), J.C. Penney
(NYSE: JCP), Kohl's (NYSE: KSS), and Target (NYSE: TGT) trade at $277, $144,
$319, and $341 per square foot of real estate, respectively.

In addition, Dillard's trades at an enterprise value of just 5.3 times trailing
EBITDA, compared with J.C. Penney at 5.8, Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) at 7.4, and
Macy's (NYSE: M) at 6.4.

Hedge funds at the gate
As an added bonus, Barington Capital, a very savvy hedge fund, has been
agitating for change. Barington's track record includes helping other retail
companies, including Pep Boys (also a real estate play), Syms, Warnaco, and
Collective Brands, unlock value. 

According to letters Barington wrote to Dillard's management, it appears that
the hedge fund has not succeeded so far in getting management to implement
shareholder-friendly measures. However, it's always a nice thing to invest
alongside funds such as Barington and Third Point (which also owns a stake)
that actively work to unlock value.

Stalemate or breakthrough?
It's tough to tell, given management's voting control, what the future holds
for Dillard's. However, the company has significant real estate value, trades
at very low multiples of sales and cash flow, and has some smart hedge-fund
operators involved in the background, so we can at least have some hope that
Dillard's shareholders will see their shares climb out of the bargain bin.

Nice report from our BNI:

Burlington Northern 3Q earnings rise
October 23, 2007: 11:24 AM EST

Oct. 23, 2007 (Thomson Financial delivered by Newstex) --

DALLAS (AP) - Railroad operator Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. (NYSE:BNI)
said Tuesday that its third-quarter profits rose 8 percent, beating Wall Street
expectations, as price increases offset lighter freight shipments and higher
fuel costs.

Chairman and Chief Executive Matthew K. Rose said the company was worried about
the short-term prospect of a slowing economy, weak housing markets, sluggish
consumer spending and high fuel prices.

But investors bid up shares of Burlington Northern, which rose $3, or 3.6
percent, to $86 in morning trading.

The company said it earned $530 million, or $1.48 per share, in the quarter
ended Sept. 30, compared with $489 million, or $1.33 per share, a year earlier.

Analysts were expecting $1.37 per share, according to a survey by Thomson
Financial.

Revenue rose 3 percent to $4.07 billion a year ago, and slightly topped the
$4.04 billion forecast by analysts.

Fort Worth-based Burlington Northern said freight volumes fell by 4.7 percent
due to weakness in the housing market, which dinged shipments of furniture, and
in consumer goods.

But agricultural shipments rose 10 percent, to $682 million, behind strong
demand for wheat and for corn used to produce ethanol. And revenue from coal
shipments jumped 14 percent, or $101 million, to $849 million, even though
volumes were virtually flat due to mine production problems, the railroad said.

Third-quarter expenses rose 1.7 percent, to $3.07 billion. Burlington reduced
salary and benefit costs to offset a 7 percent hike in fuel prices.

Rose said the company was not buying out employees to remove them from the
payroll, but was seeing attrition of about 2 percent per year and wouldn't
increase the work force until shipping volumes resume.

'Although we have concerns near-term about the economy, housing markets, high
fuel prices and general consumer softness, we continue to be optimistic about
the long-term future of BNSF,' Rose said.

Morgan Keegan & Co. analyst Art W. Hatfield said Burlington Northern produced
'good results in a tough environment.'
For the fourth quarter, Burlington expects freight revenue to grow by a
mid-single-digits percentage, with pricing remaining strong and volumes turning
down slightly.

Over the next couple months, shipments of holiday goods could be hit by the
trend of shoppers buying gift cards, which often aren't redeemed right away,
delaying the need for retailers to ship goods by rail to stores before
December, executives said.

Burlington Northern is the second-largest U.S. freight railroad operator after
Union Pacific Corp. (NYSE:UNP)

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (OOTC:HWYI) (NYSE:BRK A) controls 17.2
percent of the company's stock, up from an 11 percent stake in June. Buffett

Hi -with a K

CSX Corp. (CSX) is another railroad you might want to look at too. The long
term price movement is similar to BNI.
http://finance.yahoo.com/charts#chart3:symbol=csx;range=2y;compare=bni+
^gspc;charttype=line;crosshair=on;logscale=on;source=undefined

I think the fundamental valuation for CSX is a bit more attractive than BNI. It
appears that the market has discounted CSX value because of a non functional
board and inexperienced management. According to CSX's largest shareholder TCI,
CSX management ``does not fully understand the economics of the business' and
is ``cavalier about potential risks' and ``undisciplined about spending,'
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a7tRcddDR1b8&refer=home

The value proposition is that their operating inefficiencies can be fixed by
bringing in more experienced management or perhaps even merging with one of the
other top railroad operators. The risk is if current management goes on a
spending spree to satisfy wall street and make lousy strategic long term
capital investments.

From my brief review of CSX's non core assets, they could sell their Greenbrier
Hotel resort for over $700 million (worth a few dollars a share) and deploy
this capital into their core business by upgrading their infrastructure with
new more efficient engines and rail cars.

They announced earnings 10/16/07 which were up 25% but probably from a low
base. I think Buffet likes BNI because their management is top notch.

I don't know if Radian Group, RDN, has been mentioned here before or not. The
company is involved with mortgage insurance and broad related financial
operations.

Down from the 50-65 range most of last winter, the stock trades today around
13.

Here is a comment from deep value manager Marty Whitman that appeared in
Fortune, according to Yahoo!

-------------------------------------------------------
And in early September rival MGIC Investment (Charts), the country's largest
mortgage insurer, abandoned its bid to acquire Radian (Charts). The stock,
which approached $70 early in the year, bottomed near $15 this summer. In a
September SEC filing, Third Avenue Management disclosed that it had bought
nearly 11% of Radian. Shares jumped 10% on the news, but Whitman is in for the
long run, not a quick bounce.

He figures that the company has a book value of about $50 a share. In early
October, Deloitte & Touche said it would no longer be Radian's auditor, raising
concerns that a new auditor might force Radian to write down its assets.
Whitman, though, believes that even in the worst case Radian's book value isn't
likely to fall below $40 a share.

speaks for itself.

Here is the reason why WPL hit an all time low today.

W.P. Stewart suspends dividend (WPL) 7.71 -0.09 : The co announces "the
suspension of the regular quarterly dividend payment to common shareholders.
Commenting on the decision taken today by the Board of Directors, Bill Stewart,
Chairman & CEO said: "We are about eight months into a one- to two-year
turnaround program, and the principal challenge is that it takes time to do it
right. We've essentially completed the addition of strong, experienced people
in most key positions; the integration of our global research and portfolio
management activities and the substantial broadening of our product line.
Investment performance is improving and we have reduced operating expenses."
"We continue to generate positive cash flow but we expect it will take some
time before the impact of these changes takes full effect. The Board's action
today is to ensure the Company has the cash resources necessary to continue
building out our global franchise, including exploring possible strategic
opportunities."

============================================================

The stock should bounce around these lows for several months and if their
recovery plan works, there will big a big value opportunity. I will continue to
hold my small position and will look to add to my position next year with more
positive news on the progress of their turnaround.

Went on a shopping spree today: BAC, CIT, WF, NBR, HPT. Sold some ITG. Decided
to boost financial exposure again. Most of those I have sold off for higher
prices a couple of weeks ago.

CPX earnings were a penny below estimates. Not as bad as expected but stock
appears to sell off. they were roughly FCF neutral this quarter which is at
least some progress relative to the situation before when they had negative FCF
due to heavy Capex. For CPX as well as for most other drillers Capex should
fall and those companies should turn in strong FCF numbers next year when Capex
falls below depreciation.
from the drillers I bought some NBR today because I like the international
business. Altogether my exposure to NG is still moderate and i do not own any
oil play - this space appears too topsy to me.

I am looking at cable play TWC, which trades at a 15-20% discount to CMSCA.

RDN. Yes, RDN mentioned here before several times. It is often surprising how
old stocks, like old girl friends, sometimes come back into your life.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=15294345&srchtxt=rdn

I rode RDN then with Mr. Whitman. It took a while, but results for me were very
satisfying.

Now that he has reentered and buying 10 percent of the company, and I can get
in for a price less than he paid, of course I'm going to be willing to look at
it again too.

I have these comments.

1. Scott Black, a professional value investor whom I like, said on Bloomberg
last night to avoid these bond & mortgage insurer companies, saying that the
troubles in the sector aren't fully known or out. So his comment's a big
negative for me for buying RDN.

2. I am somewhat confused about the stock buying or not buying logic of many
posters on SI who reference Whitman and Third Ave funds. I see several who
state they have the fund and are satisfied with it. I see several who post
about a stock that's being talked about, who say they have it and so does
Whitman (implicitly confirming the wisdom of their purchase or the safety in
it) (Edit. And I am one of these people too -gg-), yet here with RDN we have a
stock that Whitman has now bought maybe $100M worth of, and yet we two are the
only people around who are willing to step in for shares too?

Imo, in trying to avoid uncertainty, an investor gives up a lot in possible
gain. After all, with RDN, you are looking at a financial stock with a stated
book value of over $50. There's a lot of resources and safety in that -- I
hope.

Oh well, maybe Whitman hasn't done his homework correctly, and maybe avoiders
of the stock are right. I'm in as of the last couple days, starting at $13.90

As you warned, ORI Q3 profit fell sharply on mortgage guaranty and title
insurance segments (37% of operating revenue). No improvement here seen before
'09, according to management.

looks like comcast is infected too. down 10%. i probably seem like i dont know
whether i am coming or going but i bought back edv increasing my stake by 25%.
a bunch of what i hope are their still current holdings have come back nicely
in price and iam hoping that the quarterly numbers will show nice reporting and
some deploymnet of the 20% cash on hand they had in mid august.
I would think that with the credit crunch they should be able to get more for
the deals their investment bank can put together so the margins should
increase.
