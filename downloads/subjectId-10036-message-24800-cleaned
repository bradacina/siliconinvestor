After reading Greenblatts "The little book that beats the market" I tried his

Company seems mispriced with no major issues I am aware of.

I like Greenblatts book and believe his screen should work, maybe with some
minor tweaks. I have never looked much at ROA, since i thought that effective
use of capital is included in the estimated growth rates. However i buy into
Greenblatts logic that some stocks with temporary issues may be overlooked when

 Mills Corp. May Be Near Inking A Takeout

Corp.

Mall REIT, Heavyweight Advisors in Tow, Should Secure Deal, Sources Say

While the Street appears to have little faith in $1.5 billion market cap The
Mills Corp. landing a takeout, the REIT could be close to a deal.

On Feb. 23, Mills publicized the start of its strategic review and its hiring
of advisors-Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan-and the stock dropped 9% to $37.20 a
share. And it has moved down steadily since, closing at $27.55 at press time.

Arlington, Va.-based Mills manages 42 retail properties, which include regional
shopping centers and entertainment complexes, in North America and Europe.

A recent Mills announcement, on June 22, involves shifts in management
responsibilities to allow President Mark Ettenger and other executives to focus
more intensely on the review process. Ettenger came aboard in 2004 from
Goldman, where he ran the real estate asset sale division.

On May 23, the company announced it closed on $1.91 billion of $2.23 billion in
financing from Goldman, and that it signed confidentiality agreements with
"more than 30 potential buyers and investors." Bids were due on June 13, and
two days after that deadline, Mills publicized the receipt of letters of intent
from "a variety of parties." Vornado Realty Trust, Westfield Group, Developers
Diversified Realty Corp., Taubman Centers Inc., Simon Property Group Inc.,
General Growth Properties Inc. and The Lightstone Group have signed
confidentiality agreements with Mills and could be in the data room.

Two hedge funds are also keeping Mills in the limelight. The same day Mills
announced its management shift, San Francisco-based Farallon Partners LLC filed
a 13DA confirming it raised its stake to 7.7% from 6.5%. Farallon managing
member, Monica Landry, declined to comment via a spokeswoman. One month
earlier, Stark Investments filed on 8.7%. A Stark partner, Michael Roth, did
not return a call.

And Mills already had one strike against it before the review announcement. On
Jan. 6, it publicized it will restate its financial results back to 2000.

Richard Moore, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, said, "I think people might be
interested in individual assets, but based on what I've heard, I don't think
anyone wants to bid on the whole package." Moore added he doubts many financial
bidders are in the Mills data room. "Regional malls are a management-intensive
business, so private equity firms probably won't want to bid," he said.

Edward Civera, chairman of the four-director special committee, could not be
reached.

A call to Ettenger was deferred to a company spokesman, who, along with a
Goldman spokeswoman, declined to comment. The head of real estate M&A at
Goldman, Michael Graziano, could not be reached.

Oil/oil related. Many of the stocks are getting killed, but some might find a
base because of their high dividend or trust payouts. (assuming their payouts
can stand if/when/as oil comes down in price).

I'll take a chance that PWE distributions will be okay. (Just a guess.) Adding
a few more shares today as price drop continues.

Grommit, can you share any more info on your pick of HTE? It pays out a lot of
trust income vs. stock price, so that's both an attraction and a caution (that
the yield might not be sustainable). HTE's not been mentioned here before, and
you report it's your largest trust holding, so I'm interested.

Oil/oil service: Linking Brinks' post from Spinoff thread here:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=22757165

I'll take a few shares of EEYUF now.

My tactic: betting that somewhere around current stock prices for these trusts,
the trust income (high yield) will stop the decline in the stocks. I assume
trust income won't be cut - oil is still over $60/bbl (for now anyway), and
related businesses (drillers/suppliers/etc.) are good, so maybe these trusts
will be okay. Should the stocks just stop dropping and not go anywhere, an
investor gets good income in return for being in. (even after the 15% Canadian
withholding). And if oil stocks get back in favor again, there's the
possibility of a capital gain with the trusts as well. I'll assume they would
participate in a rally, but to a lesser extent than your typical stocks in the
sector(s).
Of course trusts have a special appeal and their own issues. (Trusts aren't the
same as 'businesses'.)

As is usual for me, I'm trying to diversify among several issues to spread the
risk.

COGT, yes, still holding my few shares.

That lumpy revenue has bothered me. I just hope they have a viable product, and
they've not saturated the market. I'm no expert in the product/company/key
managers/sector. I bought because profit margins look so good (when they have
sales -g-).
Does seem like more sales are coming in, so that's a good sign.
I didn't add at stock lows ... too unfamiliar with the the business to have the
confidence to add on an assumption the good times would return.

When it dropped to about $10/sh and with cash about $4/sh and no ltd, maybe I
got it wrong, and it was a decent value bet then.

I bought an initial position in PTEN. I recommend listening to the presentation
at the Lehman conference. Just to maintain natural gas supplies requires 27000
drills to be drilled each year. The total US inventory of rigs at the end of
2005 was 1,813.

A couple of highlights from the recent quarter:

The company earned $171.7 million, or $1 a share, in the quarter, compared with
$74 million, or 43 cents a share, a year ago. Second-quarter revenue rose 63.3%
from a year ago to $636.8 million. Analysts were looking for earnings of 95
cents and revenues of $607 million. Four hundred thirty-one thousand shares
represents each rig, and rigs currently sell for between 10-15 million dollars.
(Slide 36 in the presentation.) So you can see that the company is valued at
the low end of its rig inventory.

The company, which has already completed a $200 million buyback, also said that
its board has authorized a share buyback of up to $250 million.

Basically the company believes that it's cheaper to buy the stock than to make
an acquisition. With no debt and tremendous cash flow, this looked like a good
entry point for me.

SIX is a gamble. I can share a little history FYI.

Maybe the preferred stock is less a gamble than the common. (PKS previous stock
symbol) The preferred stock was recommended on the value website and maybe
discussed here years ago. The preferred B shares are mandatory redeemable at
$25 (cash or stock) on 2/15/2009. The stock is presently at $21.45 and pays
$1.81 div per year (8.4%) add the appreciation if/when redeemed and you get a
yield of over 15%. Back in 2003, when first mentioned, the pref stock was at
$17, and the yield was even higher. I sold the last of my pref shares just last
week to add to various energy investments.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=six+six-pb

AS far as the common stock. PKS / SIX stock has been owned by the owner of the
redskins and also by Bill Gates via his investment fund. Yahoo lists Snyder as
owning 11 million shares. Search the news on him and six flags. I just searched
Bill Gates and SiX FLAGs and found this.

HTE/Forbes rant:
Adding more HTE. It's the cash distributions - which I hope aren't going to be
cut. That Grommit likes HTE and is in it, that's a positive (well, to me anyway
-g-)

I don't know anything of the Forbes/Lehmann Income Securities newsletter or
their HTE recommendation. I recently ended a free trial subscription to the
Forbes Growth letter though:

http://www.forbesinc.com/newsletters/fgi/

It was terrible. On a lot of levels. Imo.

First, some of the new stocks they were recommending I already bought at lower
prices. They were late, imo.
The time I had their newsletter, their performance seemed mediocre at best to
me. OTOH, my own performance with stocks then and now ain't so great either.
They'd recommend something, the stock seemed okay to me(fundamentals,
business), then in a subsequent letter, they'd recommend selling it -
apparently just because it didn't move or dropped.
You could not discern a method to their recommendations. Like they were writers
who just used their gut to pick stocks and to sell them. Seemed random to me.

On a basic level I ask (rhetorically), who are we? If we're here in the market
for a short time, to play around or maybe to try to make a killing and then get
out, that's one thing. But if we're like Mr. Buffett and plan to be buying (and
selling) stocks for decades, then we have to have a method for our buying and
selling. Imo, it cannot be by following a black box (fundamental and quant. as
determined by these newsletter people), where our buys and sells are
created/determined/recommended for us by methods of which we really have no
clue. And by newsletter people whose employment we cannot be assured of.
I learned nothing from the newsletter to help me be a better investor. "Buy
this, sell this" without giving education or methods does not help someone who
expects to be buying & selling stocks for many years. I'd say and feel the same
even if their picks which I mostly didn't understand, scooted up terrifically
in price. If an investor does not develop his/her own investing method but
rather is dependent on such a newsletter for advice/picks -- that's not a
recipe for the investor's long-term success. Imo anyway.

Madharry, yes I've been considering that issue (When do you follow good value
funds into their individual selections?).

I'm specifically reflecting on Marty Whitman's picks. Somebody on his team
convinced them that buying tech stocks when they were low and you could buy
them something like 6-8x what they would earn when they achieved peak earnings,
was a good idea. So he/they bought several. For me of little faith, I had no
confidence that those stocks would ever see peak earnings again or that 8x peak
earnings wasn't a low. So I never bought. As best as I can guess, my decision
to avoid has been better than their decision back then to buy. (So far, and
maybe)

If though I look at Chinese real estate company, CHEUY, another Third Avenue
selection, and a stock they reported recently they were adding to, that's a
stock I have almost no idea what they could do in future (business or stock),
or their accounting, or their focus (management vs. stockholders' benefit). Yet
it's a stock I'm willing to bet the Third Avenue people have done a lot of
research on and are comfortable with. And that's one reason I'm will to ride
along with them on CHEUY.

I'd guess though, that in general you'd be right to look closely at value
funds' top selections, especially if you can buy around the price they got in.

current ratio high enough for the defensive investor. However, we find the

I'm revisiting VZ vs. CMCSA.

This time it's more "I have the service, so I'll buy the stock" as opposed to
which is the better bet (or neither or both) (VZ vs. CMCSA?).

Got my VZ fiber Thursday. It will replace my Earthlink DSL. Fib. seems to be
just as you say, John Carragher. Several hours to wire the house and computers.
Install went smoothly though, with a battery backup and their wireless router
installed (although we chose to be hardwired from the router to our desktops
now). My upload speed has gone from 114k to 1808k, and my download from 610k to
5043k (according to Speakeasy website).

Both stocks are near highs. Darn difficult to figure the difference in
technologies, and which might be better or worse. Maybe it's not even that:
These telecom/cable companies...Perhaps it's the company with the best access
to politicians that wins.

Some of the other people here like VZ better because of the dividend. I'm
leaning that way too. Maybe neither company can get a significant sustainable
advantage out of their business, and if they just muddle along, I'd rather have
that 4.5% VZ div. yield on my side.

OTOH, there are several possible positives for holding CMCSA, perhaps a prime
one might be that CMCSA has spent a lot of money on upgrades, voip, etc. etc.
and maybe there's a lot of free cash flow to be had now and in future. OTOH,
gee, competition seems like it forces continuing huge capital investments for
everybody.

Here's a cross post from tech101 which highlights the competition between
Verizon and Cablevision:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=22759030&srchtxt=fios

I'm going to drop CMCSA and up my few shares of VZ. It'll never be anything but
a tiny position for me, but it does fit in a category of "if you will buy the
product, consider buying the stock". For me, I go beyond Peter Lynch who I
believe said (paraphrased) about such stocks: buy what you know, but only after
you investigate the company. I've found if I just buy stocks of most the
companies from whom I buy their product or service, that on average, that that
works out satisfactorily for me. And when I don't buy, I have regretted it.

least two years. friend of mine signed up one year and a few months back got a
price increase. not much a few dollars.

there is big difference between cable and optic. with vz you have your own
direct line on a fiber smaller than a hair. on cable you share the line with
the community. as more and more of your neighbors get on their pc your response
time slows down as you are all sharing the same line.

cable is more un-relieable imo it is laid about six inches under the ground and
every tom , dick and harry who works in his yard or has a contractor come
through cuts the line. also the lines outside developments run along the
telephone poles and usually every wind storm the cable goes out or quality of
delivery gets real bad. Also it seems cable has more connections to maintain in
these control boxes outside your house or along the lines. It seems comcast is
always working the lines or boxes. i have never had an interruption in my optic
since installation vs my neighbor across from me has lost service several
times. after a year now he is convinced the price of cable is lower but not
worth it.

next will be optic delivery tv. presently in some states and calf is now
looking at giving approval state wide vs having to negotiate approval in each
community.

the expense to install the optics is huge the ceo last year and the year before
was being laughed at from a financial point. no one expected him to recover the
costs. i know in my development , perhaps 25 homes over half immediately
installed optic and kick cable out. the same will happen with tv once it comes
on line.

You even get faster speeds .. gggggg

Hi John/Paul

I hope you don't mind if I throw in a couple of my thoughts on your
conversation. I think Verizon is way ahead of most other companies because of
their decision to commit so heavily to true fiber-to-the-home. The argument
against FTTH has always been cost for connecting the last mile. Japan FTTH has
exploded and it has proven to be very successful. New technologies are and will
continue to increase the capacity of fiber at a magnitude greater then cable.
The services that Verizon will be able to deliver and the ultimate cost savings
of fiber will pay off in the long run. As well deployment methods are helping
to dramatically drop the cost of fiber to the premises. So the $20 billion or
so that Verizon is proposing to spend on FTTH should be an extremely wise
investment in securing dominance.

Here's is a great article on the subject:

http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB115578482115638079-lMyQjAxMDE2NTE1NzcxODc
Wj.html

Japanese FTTH:

http://www.hitel.com/news_events/access_news/20040901_broadband_article.htm

As well here is an example of some of the new deployment technologies that will
drive down costs especially in metro areas which have always been the major
concern.

Thanks for the comments/links regarding VZ, DSL and cable.

In obtaining technology, I'm usually a late acquirer rather than a seeker of
the latest&greatest stuff, so for me I'm not so enamoured of being able to step
up to fiber with 20Mbps (from my newly acquired and seemingly very satisfactory
5Mbps now). Although according to your link, it's (20Mbps)widely available in
Japan, and sought after by consumers. And it's available through DSL. I had
hoped that that would not be so achievable with DSL, and that FTTH was the
clearly better technology with more capability. Which it may be; I'm making a
small bet that it is (adding more VZ to my few shares today).

I'm wondering what the Koreans are doing. I believe I read they have the most
sophisticated and advanced telecom systems of any nation.

Also curious if there might be any other ancillary plays that people might
suggest regarding fiber. I've looked at General Cable; that stock's too
expensive for me now. Same for MRVC, and APCC. My new router is from Actiontec;
the company appears to be privately held. I don't know of any content stocks
that are largely and specifically benefitting from having their product
delivered over fiber. Movie stocks I'm looking at are in conglomerates (I have
a little TWX, DISCA, etc.).

Recent buys - mostly energy related PTEN (23.8$) , VLO (50.2$), CNX (30.6$)

PTEN, 4$ earnings for a 23$ stock, debt free. PTEN shows up in many of my value
screen including the "magic formula screen". I could easily see this company
being taken out in a private equity deal.

VLO - largest independent refine trading at a PE<7. Lot's of FCF. I do not
understand why VLO appears to trade in lockstep with crude since it's the crack
spread that matters. I checked yesterday and calculated a 1-2-3 crack spread of
18$/barrel which is a very good margin for refining. I conclude that VLO is
mispriced by traders that seem to trade VLO with other energy stocks (basket
trading?)

CNX owns 80% of CXG, the coal bed methane spinoff. CNX market cap is 5.6B$,
with about 560M$ in earnings. CNX 80% ownership in CXG alone is worth
3.8B$x0.8=2.8B$ now we subtract CXG earnings (80% of 140M$=112M$/a); 560M$/a
(total) -112M$/a(gas) =448M$/a

Net result of stripping out CXG from CNX: Net market cap 5.6B$-2.8B$=2.8B$ with
560M$-112M$=448M$. Now CXG cannot be sold near term for tax reasons and it
looks a little expensive with respect to earnings.However i believe that CXG
still is not overvalued based on it's reserve, the future production growth of
15% and reserve growth at very low cost (<0.5$/mcfe!). Anyways without the
gassy spinoff we have CNS 448M$ in earnings valued at only 2.8B$ for a net PE
of 6.25 without CXG.

Total energy related portfolio allocation about 15% now, so it's not that i am
placing a large macro bet. But in all those cases above i think my math is
correct and Mr Market is doing something stupid. We shall see.

Grommit, just a fyi for those unfamiliar with the crack spread definition in
general terms:

Crack Spread:
http://www.traderslog.com/Crack-Spread.htm
(1) In energy futures, the simultaneous purchase of crude oil futures and the
sale of petroleum product futures to establish a refining margin. See Gross
Processing Margin. (2) Calculation showing the theoretical market value of
petroleum products that could be obtained from a barrel of crude after the oil
is refined or cracked. This does not necessarily represent the refining margin
because a barrel of crude yields varying amounts of petroleum products.

With bad news in most cases I sell and ask questions later. In most cases i

price later. Sometimes it works the other way around with good news. My target

I have several more for your perusal: GMR, EXAR, OVTI and I also like

GMR: low debt to equity, low price to book, very nice profit margin, pays a
nice dividend and has great cash flow. Also seem to be conservative in stock
options as the number of diluted shares has increased by an average of less
than 1% over the last three years. The knock: 19% decline in revenues year over
year.

EXAR: No debt, low price to book, high percentage of current price as cash on
hand, nice revenue growth, decent profit margin, strong cash flow and diluted
number of shares is flat to down from the number three years ago. No dividend.

OVTI: No debt, low price to book, high profit margin, increasing sales, very
nice ROA, good cash flow. No dividend. Diluted shares is higher than three
years ago but down 7.49% YOY.

BVF: Reasonable debt level, high quick ratio, low price to book, low price to
capital spending ratio, very nice ROA, increasing sales, pays a dividend, very
nice cash flow. Conservative treatment on shares as the total is flat to down
from the total three years ago.

I've made many more mistakes than good calls, so everyone is urged to treat all

NORTHGATE RECEIVES PERMITS FOR YOUNG-DAVIDSON UNDERGROUND EXPLORATION PROGRAM
Monday September 25, 8:00 pm ET

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(MARKET WIRE)--Sep 25, 2006 -- Northgate Minerals
Corporation (TSX:NGX.TO - News)(AMEX:NXG - News) today announced that the
permits required to commence the advanced underground exploration program at
its Young-Davidson Property near the town of Matachewan have been granted by
the Ontario government. Construction of necessary surface infrastructure will
begin immediately and tender documents for the underground ramp development and
shaft dewatering have already been sent to qualified contractors. Collaring of
the surface portal for the decline ramp is anticipated to begin before the end
of the year.

Ken Stowe, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "I am very pleased
with the rapid approval of permits for the Young-Davidson Underground
Exploration Program. The Ontario government regulators responded to our
comprehensive permit applications in a timely manner with constructive comments
which we incorporated into the project scope prior to receiving final approval.
I have also been very gratified by the strong community and local First Nation
support for the project that we have received at various meetings and open
house forums we have conducted in the Matachewan region. This strong support,
combined with the favourable regulatory environment in Ontario and the
excellent exploration success we have enjoyed so far, will go a long way to
allowing us to meet our objective of completing a feasibility study and making
a production decision at Young-Davidson by mid-2008."

TCE rates look like they are rolling over and the world is producing a crapload
more boats currently to soak up the increased TCE rates. On top of it, it seems
the geopolitical situation is at least somewhat not so crazy so the spot rates
are falling, like 25% from quarter to quarter.

Combine that with better maintenence programs for the boats, all of the
refineries in the US operating at over 90% after the hurricanes, US oil demand
remaining somewhat stable and you get a picture that TCE rates are going to
fall 50% or more from here. Hence the big dividend and the big drop in prices.

We could also look into how much of their business is on contract vs. spot

my personal opinion, shipping rates should drop, you hold the stock for the
dividends for the next 10 years and wait for the next hurricane or war to dump
it.

If you see a flaw in my logic or examples here, please point them out, I'm more

"The forecast growth in tanker supply during 2006 of 5% to 7% may limit
potential increases in freight rates. Increases in fleet size are forecast in
all vessel categories, with the highest increases for the Panamax and Product
Carrier sectors."

"Tanker supply increased by 2.8%, or 8.7 million dwt (4.1 million dwt during
the first quarter and 4.6 million dwt in the second quarter) in the first half
of 2006 from year-end 2005 levels. While there was growth in all vessel
categories, the highest percentage increase occurred in the Panamax sector,
where tonnage increased by 8.0% since the beginning of the year. VLCCs, on the
other hand, experienced the lowest percentage growth at 1.8%. This additional
tonnage exerted downward pressure on TCE rates and is a key factor as to why

categories except VLCCs."

"That is, if its second-quarter earnings report doesn't do the job for you
already. Revenues were down 31% year over year to $51.5 million and net income
dropped 72% to $12.1 million. Time charter equivalent rates, a standard
industry measure, slipped from $34,691 last year to $20,603 this quarter. The
Capesize class of ships time charter rates dropped from $59,052 to $31,829 year
over year."

For clarity's sake, it might be well to note that the above was a quote
regarding the earnings of DRYS, not GMR.

A quote from GMR's most recent 10Q perhaps casts a slightly different light on
the picture:
Voyage revenues decreased by $59.5 million, or 43.9%, to $76.0 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2006 compared to $135.5 million for the prior year
period. This decrease is primarily due to a 52.5% reduction in vessel operating
days to 1,727 days for the three months ended June 30, 2006 from 3,633 days for
the prior year period. During the three months ended June 30, 2006, the average
size of our fleet decreased by 53.3% to 20.1 vessels (12.1 Aframax, 8.0
Suezmax) during 2006 compared to 43.0 vessels (26.0 Aframax, 17.0 Suezmax)
during the prior year period.

So, as you can see, the lion's share of the drop in revenues for GMR was due to
having sold off 53% of their fleet.

While I am certain that the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) would be somewhat different
in rate structure than a corresponding index for crude transport rates, I
suspect that the overall trends for each might mirror each other more times
than not as sea-going transport is, after all, sea-going transport whether
liquid or dry.

Here is a chart I found on the BDI which indicates (to me at least) that
freight rates bottomed and have headed back up:

The other article you linked was for OSG. The current metrics for DRYS are such
that they are carrying too much debt and too little free cash flow for my
taste. OSG is carrying more debt than GMR, pays a lower dividend, and has lower
free cash flow as a percentage of current price. While OSG is selling at a
price to book of 1.2 vs. GMR's 1.5, I think for my taste the other metrics
outweigh in favor of GMR being the pick out of those three.

But then there are always factors I fail to fully appreciate, including how
truly limited my vision and "insights" can be and are most days.

Upping my position a little in trucker YRCW.

Somebody's got to deliver all the imported products arriving at our ports to be
sold during Christmas season.

Seems to be doing 15% roe past couple years. Looking like about a 7 p/e.

Some negatives too of course. Integration issues with strategy of growth by
acquisition. Also the debt from purchasing the companies. Being a union shop is
a plus and minus.
