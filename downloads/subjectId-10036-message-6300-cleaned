I like your "much fairer comment" about where DE will go in the future. Because
it is the future that we've got to anticipate.

Past readings of the chart to glean performance depend on where you start. You
picked end of '86 to early '98 for a multi-X gain. This shows it's possible,
maybe reasonable, to have or have had, a big gain with ag stocks. Fair enough.
My point is that I've never been able to see these ag stocks as profitable
investments. That's me. I say that the chart shows that from maybe '82 to '87,
the stock was under 10; mostly it looks around 5-6 to me. Sure IF you could
have picked the bottom, you might have had a shot to sell at 50% gain in there
somewhere IF you picked the top. If someone did sell and move on, they missed
the big run up that you mention starting in late '86. Was it predictable (the
runnup)? Given competition, environment, out of favor industry, competing
investments, etc. -- I think one had to be an industry intimate, or have steel
parts for certain parts of one's body, or put oneself in a position to be
indifferent to the vicissitudes of one's stock holding(s) -- to have held so
long. Maybe, as previous poster John Stichnoth said, DE is a also a special
situation - being the dominant player. My original comment mentions CSE and NH.
These would be, IMO, and in my purview, even more difficult for someone to hold
for many years.

I think the ag stock prices are too high because I don't trust that there will
be earnings for a long time; I know I couldn't hold on for 5 years for a
profit; and I think I can find better investments now. That's my opinion, -g-
wrong though it may be. And I'm sticking to it. For now anyway -g-. Paul.

Your opinion is valuable, Paul, whether it is right or wrong. My theory of
participation on these threads is to try to provoke discussion, not develop a
cheerleading squad for some stock or idea.

You may be right about lack of earnings but I know that NH believes that the
industry has been more prudent with inventory and production schedules than in
past downturns, as the situation stands today. Of course, the situation could
get materially worse.

My theory of investing is sort of the Warren Buffett style - buy a stock that
you feel confident in and hope it gets cut in half. I won't like it, if after
NH goes from 30 to 9, where I started buying, it then goes to 5 -- or perhaps
50% of book after some losses. But if it then recovers to 20 in the next cycle,
I will make a lot of money.

This is a simple response. I'm of the opinion that of the 3 cse de nh that nh

My reasoning behind this, is that Case & John Deere pulled their dealerships
out of here. The nearest dealer of either one of them is 30-35 mi from here. As
a result of that, the Agco & Ford New Holland dealers are making some
substantial inroads in their(de & cse)business. This is not an isolated

slightly OT re: computer retailing, CPU

So my printer went on the fritz last August. I went and bought a new
refurbished model at Fry's. Doesn't work. Fry's won't honor the $40 performance
guarantee I bought from them (since it was refurbished), and is generally a
pain in the ass/attempting to screw me and succeeding. Hate Fry's. Deal with
the printer until it absolutely gives out late this last week. Saturday, Fry's
was still busy jerking its customers off, and 30 minutes with their idiot
manager gets me nowhere (besides the satisfaction of yelling "fraud" so loud
half the store could hear it) So I figure I'll just buy a new printer. Head to
the internet. First zdnet then cnet. I'm looking for cheap prices from
companies not in CA so I don't pay taxes. OnSale blows because their $523
printer turns out to be $611 when all the fees are added in. Buy.com blows for
similar reasons. And after entering all my personal info for a third time on a
third on-line site, the server responds that they cannot process my transaction
now. I'd have to wait until they're phone lines open 10AM monday.

About this time it dawns upon me I don't want to wait for UPS ground to deliver
my printer, and that this net shopping kinda bites anyway. Darned if I'm going
to enter all my personal info one more time just to find out it's all a sham or
some server doesn't work. Why they can't tell me the true price before I take
the time I don't know. So I head off to OfficeMax. They have like 3 high
schoolers manning the entire store who cannot figure out for the life of them
how to handle a customer wanting to spend $600 on a printer, find my free paper
shredder (one week only!), and still manage the 14 people in line to buy
pencils. I give up, telling my fiancee I don't even want to think about
printers for awhile.

30 minutes later I'm walking through my front door with my new "Editors choice"
printer from CompUSA. And they had the power center/breaker I was looking for.
While I was there I almost made an impulse buy of a notebook PC, some personal
finance software, and I did make an impulse buy of a $129 CheckIt Diagnostic
Suite. Don't tell me it's cheaper on the net. I don't care.

So I don't really think this anecdote is necessarily generalizable, but it
seems to me that CPU's intrinsic value is not negative or zero. Not worth $36,
but maybe $6? Still thinking about it...

But you admit that you wink-wink at the law! <g>

Our state, also, has a use tax on items brought into the state on which state
sales tax has not been paid. Needless to say, I of course report all such
purchases and pay the use tax religiously.

You DO believe me, don't you?

On a more serious note, though, this sales/use tax situation is going to have
to be addressed. Much as I hate taxes, states do need at least some revenue to
run at least minimal essential services. Mail order and the net allow generally
more affluent consumers to avoid paying sales tax which those who purchase at
local stores don't avoid. What's the result? a) in broad terms (of course there
are exceptions, but in broad terms) the less wealthy/astute subsidize the more
wealthy/astute, b) tax rates must be raised to compensate for the lost
revenues, and c) it won't be long before states get serious about enforcing
their use or utility taxes. A few high profile cases of web purchasers fined
major sums or even tossed in the clink for buying over the net and not paying
the tax will either loosen up some tax money or put a big dent in net commerce,
or both. P.S. I wonder whether California could force Amazon, for example, to
disclose all its sales to California residents and send out a bunch of tax
overdue notices. Wouldn't THAT start some fun!

But Frys is in a class all by themselves. And I do not mean that in a positive
way. Several months ago a buddy of mine at work mentioned that he had seen an
ad for a printer at Frys at a great price and was going to buy it. I went with
him because I wanted a scrollable mouse. Service of the store personnel was
less than impressive, but what was really amazing was the product itself. After
getting back to my office, I found out that my purchase was missing both the
software and directions. My buddy took his printer home only to find out that
he was missing several parts, including the software. He also had some EXTRA
parts. So he took it back for a trade in. The store assured him that "this one
was complete". He insisted on opening it right there to make sure. Guess what?
This one was missing more stuff than the first one! He cancelled the purchase,
and needless to say neither he nor I will ever shop there again.

Yes, Frys has good prices. But it is not worth the time and effort.

How bout a biz where everything is going great, product is in short supply..on

I'm talkin about USG the Drywall maker.
Check out Mar 15 WSJ for "World-Trade Wallflower, Drywall Is

The negatives [Always a catch, right]:
CB recently sold a chunk @ 56 [47 now]
Risk of peak of cycle [The biggie] They're gonna print money in the next 6 to 9
months, but more capacity will be coming to spoil the party...and slowdown in
activity.
Potential positives:
Beat expectations bigtime near term - estimates up only 10% in last 90
days..they've raised prices more than that and leverage may help multiply
impact on bottom line.
Maybe some of the "announced' capacity additions are signaling and industry is
smart enough not to torpedo it's profitability...some of new capacity is
replacement for less efficient.
One "Old timer" poster on Yahoo cited 10 quarter cycle in mid-80's..maybe it's
not so peaky...if rates behave...housing numbers are great - starts released
today.

If Micron or Intel faced this kind of tight capacity and freedom to price...It
would be off to the races [Look at Micron in 95 and recently just on
expectation of pricing improvement]

So is this a peak of cycle error...or is 7x a real cheap price to pay for
freedom to print earnings , even if it won't last forever?

RGC: Republic Gypsum is much smaller player. Recent news article <<Republic
sees Q3 earnings below Q2 levels
HUTCHINSON, Kan., March 10 (Reuters) - Republic Group Inc. said Wednesday that
earnings for its third fiscal quarter are expected to be 35 to 40 percent below
second quarter profits because of higher-than-expected expenses.

The company, which makes recycled paperboard, recovered paper fiber and gypsum
wallboard, said in a statement that newly-configured production lines at its
Duke, Oklahoma, gypsum wallboard plant were taking longer than planned to get
started.

Republic also said it accelerated the hiring and training of employees at its
new recycled paperboard mill under construction in Lawton, Oklahoma, which it
said will cause expenses to be greater than originally expected.

According to First Call, analysts' mean estimate for Republic's third quarter
earnings per share is $0.49. The company earned $0.32 a share in its second
quarter that ended December 31, 1998.

''We underestimated difficulties involved and the time required in what has
amounted to, in essence, the start-up or commissioning of two production
lines,'' Chairman and President Phil Simpson said in the statement. ''The good
news is that, I believe, we are now over the worst of the start-up curve.
Additionally, demand for gypsum wallboard is about as strong as I have ever
experienced.''>>
USG by contrast, had a great 4th quarter...Republic may be a great performer
coming off of problems, but USG is the market leader and as such has economies
of scale and process technology advantages. Nobody is as good at making flat
stuff that goes on walls.

appear manageable. From recent 10K: "However, it is management's opinion,
taking into account all of the above information and uncertainties, including
currently available information concerning U.S. Gypsum's liabilities, reserves
and probable insurance coverage, that the asbestos litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on the liquidity or financial position of the
Corporation." There was a couple of pages of
won-some, lost-some, accrual discussion that lead to this.
Net IMO No biggie.
Bankruptcy: It's history...They leveraged up to avoid hostile LBO and
construction market went south. Existing equity went to debt holders. Look at
the balance sheet: Current Ratio (mrq) 1.86 Long-Term Debt/Equity (mrq) 1.08
Total Cash (mrq) $152.0M. The positive effect of the bankruptcy was it forced
them to sell non-core businesses and get lean throughout. This with economies
of scale and superior process technologies makes them the low cost producer
with greater access to distrubution channels.
They just declared dividend and they're buying back shares.
Those two words, Asbestos & Bankruptcy, may help account for the lack of

basic things as machine tools, worm gears, generators and motors, big and

a slight drop for next year, but I believe their earnings will resume their
steady upward trend in the near future, simply because management has been
pretty solid during the time I have owned them. I'm not sure the reason for

overestimate the intelligence of pc/peripheral shoppers, much like people

Berkshire Hathaway/Leucadia National(old). It's primarily an insurance
operation run by a very value oriented management that bargain hunts with its
capital. It may not be cheap at present, but it could belong on a short list of
potential investments.

My two cents on CPU. While I may not buy big ticket items such as a laptop or
desk PC from CPU, I will buy something that I need quickly. For example, I
recently purchased a refurb laptop from Onsale. Once I got it, I decided that I
wanted a modem also, instead of waiting to win a bid on a small ticket item and
save ten bucks, I instead run to the local CPU and purchase it. I guess I'm
willing to wait when I am going to save a decent amount of money (100+), but
when it comes down to items where the difference is a few bucks it isn't worth
the wait. I purchase almost all my peripherals and software at CPU. Items
needed that day would almost be enough to keep the brick and mortar going along
with the newbies. Also, I still do not see the trust in credit card
transactions with the average computer user yet either.

Another aspect of CPU: Sales of PC's/Laptops are still growing quickly, but it
is the margin pressure/decreased ASPs that are the trouble. Plenty of people
are still buying PC's from the local store. And while businesses and net-savvy
folks may not always do it, I think a lot of the AOL-types will.

It would be real interesting, on CPU, to get a breakdwon of capital items sold
vs supplies/peripherals. Stores like Staples have certainly shown that they can
make money selling a bunch of stuff at 5 bucks a shot. CPU's small items
probably average closer to $50. I bet their margins on the big items are a lot
tighter than on the small items.

Just a thought. Good luck.

Some recent moves :
Sold 1/2 my position in Finish Line (FINL) given the huge run-up in recent
months. Still have a full position, though, and feel the company is positioned
for long-term success, with excellent management during this downturn in the
industry. No doubt the NCAA tournament has helped, and now with the return of
baseball (IMO, the fever is back among fans thanks to last year's HR battle),
FINL might get an unexpected tailwind.

Sold 1/2 my position in Telesp Cellular (TCP), Brazil's best-positioned
cellular player, due to sheer overweighting in my portfolio. I had averaged
down aggressively when it got to the 13's, and now the position just got too
huge. Still have a full position.
I'm retaining my overweighted position in Unibanco (UBB), which is now my
largest position with the TCP sale.

I added to Deswell at a recent 8 7/8, and as noted I established a new position
in CPU at 5 3/4, but the sales above leave me with enough cash for two more
positions. Looking at Philip Morris (MO, due to long-term track record), JD
Edwards (JDEC, due to long history of mgmnt, and conservative, good positioning
in ERP industry for rapid reversal of fortunes in its mid-market focus), Men's
Wearhouse(SUIT, my ValueStocks.net March pick of the month), and Informix
(IFMX, well on its way to turnaround but getting held down artificially IMO by
previous buyers at higher prices getting out). I still like every position in
the ValueStocks.net fund and I am considering a position in Theragenics (TGX),
the Jan pick given its strong balance sheet/demographics at its back/better
product than comp/insider buying offset by its having only one product and
being biotech, but with the run-up in oil and the ag equips the gimmes are
getting fewer and far between IMO.

My dilemma of when to sell my winners is still a Q I wrestle with. After all
they keep going up. I'm finding that I feel best if I unload half a position
after a substantial quick run of 70-100% and redeploy to a deeper value
situation soon thereafter. Any other suggestions for value investors? I for one
am wary of the quick spikes that many traditional value stocks have been making
in this market, only to fall substantially when the liquidity dries up.

Audiovox (VOX) looks interesting

From Yahoo Marketguide:
Audiovox Corp. markets and supplies a diverse line of portable
and vehicle cellular telephones and accessories, automotive
sound and security equipment, cruise controls, mobile video,
and other automotive aftermarket accessories.

For some time, I never quite figured out what Audiovox did.
It seemed to be a holding company (with a position in Cellstar)
that sold some type of cellular phone equipment. The stock
price has gone nowhere over the past five years, and the stock
has been selling well below sales and book value, with an
earnings history that was nothing to write home about.

However, over the past eight months or so the stock has
doubled, there have been positive earnings surprises the
last couple quarters, and I keep hearing Ads on my radio
station here in Houston for sleek new Audiovox cellular
phones from Primeco. (I hear similar ads are airing in
Chicago.) The stock is also still selling well below
sales and book value.

I don't know about the long term prospects of this company,
but over the short term at least it looks like it has
some decent prospects. Any comments?

Champion's recent Annual report mentioned that they're seeing increased

about 2 weeks to 1 month now following some acquisitions, but at the same time
they say backlog is considerably greater than prior year. I'd like to see that
pulled down a bit, but at the same time recent housing numbers are bullish.

I haven't looked closely at the others in the industry, but if they all have
inventory buildups it could indicate margin pressure in the near future for
everyone. Does the stock price already reflect this concern? I hope so.

A little while back I had mentioned Dbrsy as a possible play. I know you came
out in favor of angly (same chairman) which also looks like a good play.

As far as underperforming, conventional (not necessarily correct) wisdom is to
buy what is going up. Once targets are reached, announce new targets but no
supporting fundamentals. The only support this market has is the liquidity that
AG seems to want to give it. He is very concerned about any decline in the
stock market and will do all in his power to prevent it (imo) Hence the easy
money policies. This easy money is finding its way into financial assets as no
one sees the need to add capacity in an already over production capacity world.
The most common form is companies using debt offerings to fund their stock
buyback programs. Will this end badly - yes - but do not expect AG to do
anything about it as he is the primary culprit in my opinion. A company which
cant afford to do a stock buy back based on internal cash flow doesnt deserve
to be buying it back. (imo)

Appreciate your advice on this thread. A question, you never mention buying a
stock and then doing a covered call sell. Is this part not part of you
strategy. In particular, one comes to mind.

buy NH at 10, sell the covered call september 10 strike for 1.25. In June you
collect the 55c dividend. This allows you to enter the position at a price of
8.20 Which would seem like a heck of an entry price for this stock. Yes, your
gain is limited to 18% but that seems pretty respectable for a 4 month period.
Since farming is unlikely to recover this year, it would seem to be a good way
of obtaining some return on a long term position. Another way to look at it is
to sell the June 10 calls, knowing that they will take at least a 55c hit if
the dividend is paid before expiry.

Thoughts? thanks

MB--FWIW, Clayton Homes is in Value Line (which I wouldn't have thought), and
is presently rated a 2 for timeliness. The stock has been a dog since late
1995, even though EPS has been marching steadily ahead. Presumably, there is a
negative effect from lack of visibility of future earnings/chances of an
industry slowdown. In the long run that will certainly happen, but "In the long
run we are all dead"--JM Keynes.

I looked at them last year and held off mainly because of the industry
reputation for sloppy accounting and control. I have no reason however to think
one way or another whether CMH is guilty of anything in this regard. And at
some point I have to give more credence to their numbers as they continue to
post good ones. Continued investment to drive internal growth seems to be built
into their business model, which is good. Receivables are up in the last year,
and seem high relative to peers--but I wonder if that relates to something they
are doing that others aren't. DD is needed. Inventory seems to be in pretty
good shape, which is promising.

If you find out anything about the receivables, please let us know. This looks
interesting.

Clayton Homes receivables. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but you
want to check to see if these are the receivables Clayton has been purchasing
from third parties. This is a deliberate strategy, to purchase a block of
receivables, then add value and securitize them. Its worked so far.

As for accounting, if Clayton had the problem Oakwood did last year, it would
have blown up on them by now. When you read Clayton management for a while, you
find they are pretty conservative people. I remember Jim Clayton once on a
conference call drawling "At Clayton, we don't like non-cash earnings."

Look at a long term chart of Clayton with an earnings line (like the charts
Peter Lynch uses in his books). The conclusion should be blindingly obvious.

what the earnings line signified, i.e. what formula was used to place the line

Re Depressed sectors. Some of the apparel retailers look attractive. I recently

I know you already have your oil exposure, but if you're looking for

You might look to P&C insurance as a depressed sector. Some decent insurance
companies are selling at low multiples. My company, Allstate, is one of them.
I'm getting the feeling that our new CEO (Ed Liddy) has some major changes on
the way. I'd be surprised if we don't announce some form of direct channel
operation within the year. We're also being mentioned alot as both a potential
acquirer, especially of Independent Agency business, and as a potential

It's the most inflationary commodity. With oil priced in $US, a Fed reaction to

On the other hand... (Re Oil Prices, from The Economist)--

6-Mar-99

The price of oil has fallen by half in the past two years, to just over $10 a
barrel. It may fall
furtherand the effects will not be as good as you might hope

The next shock?

OIL is cheaper today, in real terms, than it was in 1973. After two OPEC
-induced decades
of expensive oil, oil producers and the oil industry as a whole have more or
less given up
hope that prices might rebound soon. The chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell, Mark
Moody-Stuart, three months ago unveiled a five-year plan that assumed a price
of $14 a
barrel. He has since publicly mused about oil at $11. Sir John Browne, chief
executive of BP
-Amoco, is now working on a similar assumption.

Consumers everywhere will rejoice at the prospect of cheap, plentiful oil for
the foreseeable
future. Policymakers who remember the pain of responding to oil shocks in 1973
and in
1979-80 will also be pleased. But the oilmen's musings will not be popular with
their fellows.
For if oil prices remain around $10, every oil firm will have to slash its
exploration budget.
Few investments outside the Middle East will any longer make sense.

Cheap oil will also mean that most oil-producing countries, many of them run by
benighted
governments that are already flirting with financial collapse, are likely to
see their economies
deteriorate further. And it might also encourage more emissions of carbon
dioxide at just the
moment when the world is trying to do something about global warming.

Yet here is a thought: $10 might actually be too optimistic. We may be heading
for $5. To
see why, consider chart 1. Thanks to new technology and productivity gains, you
might
expect the price of oil, like that of most other commodities, to fall slowly
over the years.
Judging by the oil market in the pre- OPEC era, a “normal” market price might
now be in the
$5-10 range. Factor in the current slow growth of the world economy and the
normal price
drops to the bottom of that range.

That the recent fall in prices has been so precipitous merely confirms that,
for the past 25
years, oil has been anything but a normal commodity. Although the Middle East
contains
two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves, it produces less than a third of
the world's oil.
If production were determined by cost and quality alone, most oil would come
from these
countries. Oil in the Gulf is cheap to extract—barely $2 a barrel, a quarter of
the cost in the
North Sea. Unlike the heavy crudes of Mexico or Venezuela, it is of high
quality and high
value. Much of the world needs fancy technology and expensive rigs to extract
oil; in Arabia,
as the old hands say, “you just stick a straw in the ground and it gushes out.”

The Gulf countries are to blame for their small share of the market. By
nationalising their oil
industries and doing their best through the OPEC cartel to keep prices high in
the 1970s and
1980s, they encouraged oil development elsewhere. With oil so profitable,
prospectors
searched inhospitable parts of the world. The perverse result is that high-cost
regions (such
as the North Sea) have been exploited before low-cost ones (such as Iran).

The oil industry is like a ship with its centre of gravity above the water
line, says Jeremy
Elden of Germany's Commerzbank. It can sail smoothly for years, but capsize
suddenly in
rough seas—and do so quite rapidly. An unprecedented combination of excess
supply and
weak demand has created just such rough seas in the past year. The finances of
the Gulf
states are suffering, as budget cutbacks and recent talk of defence
cancellations have shown.

Yet if the Gulf producers thought that oil prices would remain low for some
years, it would
pay them to abandon all attempts to boost oil revenues by propping up prices,
and instead to
increase production. The result would be a world in which supply and demand
were
determined not by geopolitics and cartels, but by geology and markets—meaning
that, in
today's conditions, the price would head down towards $5. That sounds
appealing. But it
carries also a less happy corollary of a world that depends upon a highly
unstable region for
half its oil, with the proportion rising all the time.

Well down

A new report by Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm, and CERA , an energy
consultancy,
argues that the present price collapse is fundamentally different from the
previous one, in
1986. Then, high prices had choked off demand; but as soon as oil became cheap
again, the
thirst for it returned. This time demand has barely picked up, even though the
price has fallen
by half.

One short-term reason is yet another unseasonably warm winter in the northern
hemisphere.
A more lasting one is the economic troubles of Asia, the region that had been
expected to
drive oil-company profits for years to come. Even such sceptics as David
O'Reilly, one of
Chevron's bosses, who continues to pooh-pooh what he calls a temporary “price
siege”, still
worry that, because of Asia's crisis, demand might not rebound. Demand may fall
further if
and when America's record-breaking growth comes to an end.

There is another threat on the demand side: worries over global warming.
Although the
science remains inconclusive, rich countries agreed at the Kyoto summit in 1997
that it is
worrying enough to warrant pre-emptive action. So they have agreed to binding
targets to
reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. Whether or how countries will hit
these targets is
unclear. But demand for oil (though not for cleaner gas) in the rich world is
likely to be one
casualty.

The supply situation is even gloomier for producers. Unlike 1986, oil supplies
have been
slow to respond to the past year's fall. Even at $10 a barrel, it can be worth
continuing with
projects that already have huge sunk costs. Rapid technological advances have
pushed the
cost of finding, developing and producing crude oil outside the Middle East
down from over
$25 a barrel (in today's prices) in the 1980s to around $10 now. Privatisation
and
deregulation in such places as Argentina, Malaysia and Venezuela have
transformed
moribund state-owned oil firms. According to Douglas Terreson of Morgan Stanley
Dean
Witter, an investment bank, this has “unleashed a dozen new Texacos during the
1990s”, all
of them keen to pump oil.

Meanwhile OPEC , which masterminded the supply cuts that pushed prices up in
the 1970s
and 1980s, is in complete disarray. The cartel will try yet again to agree upon
production
cuts at its next meeting, on March 23rd, but, partly thanks to its members'
cheating on
quotas, the impact of any such cuts will be small. OPEC members fear that Iraq,
whose UN
-constrained output rose by 1m barrels a day in 1998, may some day be able to
raise
production further. Last week Algeria's energy minister declared, with only
slight
exaggeration, that prices might conceivably tumble “to $2 or $3 a barrel.”

Nor is there much chance of prices rebounding. If they started to, Venezuela,
which breaks
even at $7 a barrel, would expand production; at $10, the Gulf of Mexico would
join in; at
$11, the North Sea, and so on (see ). This will limit any price increase in the
unlikely event
that OPEC rises from the dead. Even in the North Sea, the bare-bottom operating
costs have
fallen to $4 a barrel. For the lifetime of such fields firms will continue to
crank out oil, even
though they are not recouping the sunk costs of exploration and financing. And
basket-cases
such as Russia and Nigeria are so hopelessly dependent on oil that they may go
on
producing for some time whatever the price.

And $5

All this explains why oil prices will remain low. But there needs to be a shift
in the policy of
the world's biggest producer, Saudi Arabia, for them to be halved again. The
kingdom has
for years restrained output to support prices. However, if its rulers think
prices are going to
remain low anyway, their calculation may change.

“If it weren't for politics,” insists Euan Baird, head of Schlumberger, the
world's biggest
oil-services firm, “every barrel of oil would be pumped out of the
Gulf—especially Saudi
Arabia.” Politics is not dead yet, as troubles in so many oil countries, from
Venezuela to
Russia to Nigeria have made plain—indeed, it may be the very prize of oil that
has created
these countries' problems. But a new kind of politics may now be at work to
make Mr
Baird's assertion come true.

The latest oil-price shock has come at a sensitive time for the Saudi ruling
family. Power is
passing from the ailing monarch, King Fahd, to his brother, Abdullah. The
autocratic family
has had problems with dissent in radical Islamist quarters. Low oil prices
crippled the Saudi
economy in 1998: output shrank by nearly 2%, both the current-account and the
budget
deficits soared to nearly 10% of GDP and debt approached 100% of GDP . This
year will be
worse.

The choice is simple. Either the Saudis must cut back their welfare state, by
slashing benefits
and raising taxes, or they must find a way of increasing oil revenues. But the
ruling family's
delicate domestic situation makes the first option difficult. So instead the
Saudis may now do
what once would have been unthinkable: throw open the taps. That, according to
McKinsey,
a management consultancy, would certainly herald an era of $5 oil.

It would also destroy OPEC . But the cartel is already moribund, and unless
Saudi Arabia can
bring it back from the dead, which is highly unlikely, going for full
production is the strategy
that makes most sense for all the Gulf states. Mr Elden has crunched the
numbers for the five
main producers (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates)
at a $10
price. His analysis shows that after a short period of lost revenues, the Gulf
states would
enjoy years of strong cash inflow, as they take market share from high-cost
regions. He
reckons that the real rate of return for the Gulf states on such an
“investment” is 13%, well
above the cost of borrowing to plug budget gaps. If Saudi Arabia, on its own,
pursues
volume, he reckons its rate of return would be an impressive 15%.

The catch is finding the money needed to buy equipment and develop fields now,
so as to
expand production fast. The strategy Mr Elden suggests of going for full
production might
cost perhaps $110 billion, a good $50 billion more than the Gulf states have to
hand. But
these countries will not have to beg for charity: their reserves have a present
value of $1.2
trillion. Foreign oil bosses are already queueing up, chequebooks in hand.

Sensitivities about OPEC are one reason why some people doubt that the Saudis
will, say,
double output to gobble up a 25% share within a few years. Plenty of oilmen
think that Saudi
Arabia is too cautious for that. The Saudis might instead respond to low prices
by increasing
output only slowly and quietly. Such a strategy would serve Saudi Arabia's
political ends by
keeping its chums in OPEC afloat, and its economic ends by forcing many
private-sector oil
firms to slash output from high-cost, non- OPEC fields.

There are signs that the nationalism of Gulf producers is crumbling. Kuwait is
debating
opening its oil fields to foreign investment. Even Saudi rulers have dropped
some hints.
Prince Abdullah, on his first visit to America last autumn, met American oil
firms to discuss
possible upstream investment in his country, a subject that would once have
been taboo.
Every few weeks, another top oilman visits the Saudis. Last month, Bill
Richardson,
America's energy secretary, arrived to woo the royals. Although the Saudis were
coy on that
occasion, Mr Richardson says he is confident that a framework for upstream
foreign
investment, beginning with gas, but likely to go on to oil, will be in place
within six months.

The good news...

One might expect a collapse in oil prices to fuel an orgy of gleeful
consumption. Indeed,
when the oil price halved in the mid-1980s, world consumption did soar—by 2.7%
a year
for three years. But not this time, argues Joe Stanislaw of CERA , for two
reasons. One is,
again, the advance of technology, which has made alternatives to oil, such as
natural gas,
cheaper. In the mid-1980s oil consumption surged in part because when oil fell
below $20 a
barrel, it was often substituted for gas. Now, advances in gas turbines have
made gas more
attractive, even if oil prices go below $10.

Another factor is a legacy of previous oil shocks—taxes that are aimed at
conservation. In all
rich countries but one, taxes make up so much of the price of petrol at the
pump that
consumers hardly notice any drop in crude prices. In Europe, for example, about
80% of the
purchase price (typically, $1 a litre) is tax. The exception of course, is
America, where taxes
make up only a third of the price—but at about 40 cents a litre, the price is
very low
anyway. Philip Verleger, a petroleum economist, reckons that even a prolonged
period of
low oil prices (below $10 a barrel) will provide a negligible boost to
consumption in OECD
countries, perhaps no bigger than 1%.

In poor countries, where taxes are lower and more new power stations and
vehicles are
being built, the effect of cheaper oil will be greater. Low prices will mean
that more poor
consumers can enjoy the benefits taken for granted by their rich-world
brethren, although
that will also mean they produce more greenhouse gases. In places like China,
most power
now comes from plants using inexpensive, but filthy, coal. Mr Verleger points
out that a $5
world might encourage a shift to oil-fired plants or, better still, to cleaner
ones using natural
gas.

...and the bad

Yet a falling oil price will not be good for everyone. In particular, the oil
companies and the
producer countries will suffer. Low prices have left both screaming in pain—and
there may
be worse to come .

The six biggest American oil firms posted grim fourth-quarter results for 1998:
their after-tax
profits fell by 90%, or $4.8 billion, compared with the same quarter a year
earlier. The
recent mergers of BP with Amoco and Exxon with Mobil mark a new round of
consolidation
in the industry. A big motive is to take costs out of the business: Exxon-Mobil
for example,
expects to save $2.8 billion from its merger. With its own reorganisation and
internal
streamlining, Shell is hoping to save $2.5 billion a year.

The big firms are also expecting Gulf countries to open up to investment and
are creating
formidable lobbying machines in readiness. This week two European oil firms,
ENI and Elf,
signed contracts to help develop Iranian oil fields. The new BP -Amoco will
take its place
near the front of the queue to see Gulf oil ministers, but it will also be able
to call on new
American friends to put in a good word. Sir John Browne lobbied Mr Richardson
before his
visit to Saudi Arabia.

If oil companies find that they can adapt, albeit painfully, OPEC countries
will find it much
harder. The revenues of the cartel's members plunged in 1998 to about $100
billion, only
one-fifth of their 1980 revenues in real terms, according to Marvin Zonis of
the University of
Chicago. All the oil producers are suffering, but some are in better shape than
others.
Mexico, for example, has diversified its export base, though the federal
government still gets
about a third of its revenues from Pemex, the state oil monopoly. Britain has a
diversified
economy that can weather the price drop. Norway has set aside surplus oil
revenues to pay
for pensions for its ageing population as oil income wanes. Abu Dhabi and
Kuwait, with few
people and lots of cash, have been able to stash profits away for rainy days.

But other countries are heading for big trouble. Nearly half of Russia's
hard-currency
earnings come from crude-oil exports; that figure rises to about 80% for
Venezuela and 95%
for Nigeria and Algeria. In Russia (and also in the Caspian) low oil prices may
make much
production unprofitable. In Venezuela, where production costs are lower, the
bursting of the
oil bubble has helped to propel a populist military man, jailed for two failed
coups in 1992,
into the presidency. Prolonged low prices could trigger social explosions in
several other
unstable producing countries.

As for the country that has most ostentatiously frittered away its oil wealth,
Nigeria, the
delicate transition to democracy that took a further step with last weekend's
presidential
election (see ) could yet be undermined by economic troubles. Nigeria is a
low-cost
producer, so it will still be in business even with low oil prices. But its
mismanagement—Nigerians have recently had to queue for two days to get
petrol—has
been so bad that the transition could prove difficult nonetheless.

In the short run, at least, the oil monarchies of the Gulf could also be in
difficulty. Low prices
already threaten the delicate “ruling bargain” between dictatorial rulers and
coddled subjects.
A further plunge in revenues might put them at great risk. If they slash
benefits or raise taxes,
they risk a backlash that could even shove them out.

In the medium term, however, the Gulf states will find that their revenues
recover and even
increase with cheaper oil. So once they have made the transition to higher
production, a $5
world should not hold any terrors for them. But it may hold more terrors for
the rest of the
world—for, just as in 1973, it will find that it is increasingly dependent on a
few unstable and
unreliable Gulf countries, notably Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, for its energy.
Cheap oil may
not then look quite so wonderful, after all.

From:John Stichnoth

Or, the other hand (Also from Economist, same issue):

Mar 6, 1999

Drowning in oil “WHAT”, sneered Abdurrahman Salim Atiqi, Kuwait's one-time oil
minister,
“is the point of producing more oil and selling it for an unguaranteed paper
currency?” In
1973, when most people feared that nothing could stop greedy OPEC members from
raising
oil prices as much as they chose—though not this newspaper, which forecast an
oil glut—the
producers affected to accept western cash for their black bullion out of
charity. Now the
long oil-price odyssey seems at an end. Since its peak in 1980, the price has
fallen
erratically. It has plunged by half in the past two years alone. In real terms,
oil now costs
roughly what it did before 1973. Crude is gushing from the ground at the rate
of 66m barrels
a day, half as copiously again as in OPEC 's prime. The world is awash with the
stuff, and it is
likely to remain so.

That is good news, is it not? For consumers, certainly, especially those in
poor countries
whose lives will be improved by the warmth, light and mobility that cheaper
energy brings. It
would be progress, too, to get away from the notion that oil is scarce—an
assumption that
led to two decades of energy-policy mistakes, such as subsidising coal and
nuclear power.

But do not imagine that the bad dream is over. It is worse than ever for some
of the world's
most populous and poorest countries that make their living from oil. Petroleum
provides over
half the government's income in such places as Iran and Nigeria. OPEC 's oil
revenues last
year were, in real terms, only a fifth of their peak in 1980, so most oil
producers are beset by
huge budget and current-account deficits. If cash-strapped producers cut
expenditure faster
than consumers spend their windfall, the effect of lower oil prices might even
be to slow
world economic growth.

Cheap oil could cause instability as well as poverty. As a result of last
year's low prices, the
Mexican government has revised its budget three times and increased borrowing.
Mexico is
hardly a paragon of good government, but, thanks to the diversification of its
economy since
the 1980s, it at least has an alternative to oil. Many other oil-producing
countries are
ill-placed to cope with low prices. Cheap oil might merely aggravate the twin
evils of
corruption and bad government.

No naked flames, please

The bigger fear is that consumers will one day suffer, too. Hydrocarbons and
political
volatility seem to go together. The Middle East has the world's cheapest and
most abundant
reserves of high-quality oil. Russia supplies most of Western Europe's natural
gas. The
dependence that this implies has been obscured in the past decade because OPEC
's high
prices in the 1970s and 1980s paid for the development of oil and gas fields in
such
expensive regions as the North Sea.

But low prices will gradually put most such areas out of business—especially if
cash-strapped Gulf states conclude that the best way to increase revenues is to
boost
production, which could drive prices from today's $10 to as little as $5 (see
). The world
will then again depend on a few Middle Eastern countries for half its oil, up
from a quarter
now.

At least for the moment, three of these countries—Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the
United
Arab Emirates—are staunch western allies. But Iran and Iraq are not; and the
whole of the
Gulf is unstable. All the region's governments are suffering from the decline
in the oil price.
Most are repressive and unpopular. None has a sure hold on power.

If the Saudi royal family, in particular, were overthrown, it would send oil
markets into
turmoil. Once low prices move more production back to the Middle East, even a
toppled
emirate or two might be enough to cause disarray. It is no use hoping that a
rebel
government would keep the oil flowing at any cost. Remember the revolution that
overthrew
the shah of Iran in 1979. It cut supplies for only a few months—but was enough
to trigger
the second oil shock.

Of course, any such shock would be different today. Economies depend less on
oil than they
did. The development of markets to trade oil and oil futures means that price
signals are
relayed faster and more efficiently. Oil-producing capacity outside OPEC could
be brought
back on stream should oil prices ever blip up again. Yet any interruption to
oil supplies
would be hugely damaging to the world economy. That is why, even as prices
fall,
governments of consuming countries should be guarding against the dangers of
oil
dependence.

One way of doing this is to keep researching into alternatives to the
petrol-powered internal
combustion engine, such as fuel-cell systems, which can derive hydrogen from
natural gas.
Another is to curb consumption through higher petrol taxes. The country best
able to make a
difference is America, which consumes a quarter of the world's oil, almost all
of it for
transport. American petrol taxes are so low that they do not even take account
of
environmental costs such as pollution. There is no better time to perform the
politically
awkward feat of raising taxes than when oil prices are low and the money can be
quickly
handed back in lower taxes elsewhere.

Yet even this would serve only to mitigate the future risks. By all means,
welcome the return
of normality to oil markets and the end of OPEC 's power. But just as oil's
scarcity seemed a
fact of life in the 1970s, its abundant flow might be too easily taken for
granted today.
Normality could last a while; but it is unwise to assume that it will endure
for ever.

Duh (no offense to you, John). And the Economist gives concern over
global-warming, unseasonably warm weather as two plausible reasons. At least
they mention the global economy, but to me this is the entire
reason. Most of the undeveloped pseudo-industrial world has
ceased to develop itself, giving little to no support to oil as it careens to
new lows. To me, the article is incredibly alarmist, and may be something of a
bottom-feeding signal in itself. After all, since they researched the article

I don't expect $20-25/bbl oil, but a consistent price of $15 will have a major
impact on economies, particularly in those countries that are just now
struggling to recover. It isn't necessarily oil prices rising, but the
perception that oil prices will rise that can be inflationary. OPEC isn't just
a few Arab countries anymore, this involves 13 of the largest producers in the
world.

I'll admit to being an alarmist when it comes to oil prices because I remember
1973 and 1979 so well. There is nothing that can cause inflation so quickly and
inflation causes the Fed to increase interest rates.

The Economist articles may be right, but they may be wrong. If wrong,
Agriculture is in for some very serious problems. We just filled tanks and the
price rose 3.5 cents from last time - that's 5%. I've prepaid to lock in prices
because my distributor assures me that the price will be going higher. Spread
that to every part of the economy because the price of everything is impacted
by oil prices.

I'm adjusting accordingly. If the Economist is right, I lose nothing. If
wrong...?

Mike,

You might try looking at the chemical industry. There's a great deal of
restructuring going on in this area. There seem to be a lot of potential
opportunities being created.

My favorite stock (which I own so I may be biased) is ARJ (Arch Chemical). This
company is a recent spin-off from OLN (Olin). OLN put 3 high-growth/high-margin
specialty chemical businesses into ARJ (Olin retained the big
low-growth/low-margin industries). The 3 areas are: microelectronic chemicals,
water chemicals, and performance chemicals. The microelectronic area is
especially interesting to me given any reasonable upturn in semiconductor
industry, as well as a new plant that has just come online. ARJ has said it
expects earnings growth of 19% this year. ARJ trades at a trailing P/E of 12,
trades at an estimated forward P/E of 10, pays a 4.5% dividend, has a profit
margin of about 5%, and trades at book value. It has been profitable for at
least 5 years with profit margins rising from about 2% in 1993 to as high as 6%
1996 & 1997. The balance sheet is quite reasonable (Debt/Equity is about 0.2)
and OLN had a history of repurchasing shares.

There is about 5 years of history available from the company's EDGAR document -
don't trust the numbers you see on Yahoo! or other services since they may be
carrying over OLN numbers.

Value interesting may pay off big time in the near future. Why? Well it seems
that big money institutions and players are beginning to see that there are
some screaming bargins in the smaller company tech sector - and are starting to
throw money into buyout firms. If this begins a trend we could see some real
demand for some companies that have been lonely for some time.

Also for the last year most companies, as they have the last three or four,
have grossly underperformed the S&P 500 index - money thrown at high priced
mega caps. This can't go on much longer. FWIW, articles are linked to my club

I get updates from time to time from a co-worker who owns some shares. From
what he tells me, and from a little research I have done, it looks like a good
long term investment.

The company keeps its' capital for purchases and investments, and will never
waste it by paying dividends. They also feel the markets are over - valued, so
have taken much of their investments out of the market and purchased some puts
on the S&P, so when the market corrects, their shareholders will be protected.

Their Canadian profits were hurt last year due to the ice storm that hit
Eastern Ontario and Quebec.

As I said I haven't researched this company in detail, but I believe that
Fairfax is a good company to invest in. Any information you have come across in
your research would be greatly appreciated.

I saw both the Oberweis and McCamant features. But note that there are two ways
to correct a disparity in valuation. Late last summer and early fall we saw a
less pleasant way, which was not at all kind to the smaller companies, despite
their cheaper valuations at that time.

The very best scenario that I can imagine is that the large cap stocks
back-and-fill for an extended period of time, while the decent small ones catch
up. For example, the DOW drops to 9500, while small stocks drop little; then
the DOW rallies to 10,000 again while small stocks rally smartly; then repeat
again until enough people get tired of big stock underperformance that real
money goes into small stocks and they get equally overvalued; then everything
sells off big time. But I think this is not a high probability scenario.

Doug,

Thanks for the input. I'm less enthusiastic as I look closer.

I like to look at the investment management results, ROE and the profitability
of the insurance operations. I was impressed enough with most of it, but the
insurance operations don't look particularly good at first glance. I'm also
modestly concerned that such a high percentage of earnings are coming from
capital gains. I think I would rather make an attempt (granted very rough) at
"look thru" earnings.

Re: Temp Staffing... for Technology Services

Mike, there was a very good piece on this subject on CNBC's Power Lunch last
Wednesday, March 17. Unfortunately I was watching it from a busy restaurant,
and can't recall (yet) the stocks mentioned (none I had heard before). So...did
anyone see this on Power Lunch on 3/18? I do know all stocks discussed were at
or near 52 week lows. Key problem is lack of visibility of revenue & earnings,
Y2K distraction, etc. I will recall a couple names I'm sure, and will post.

On Fairfax, a company which at first glance looks just like Berkshire Hathaway
(a fact the CEO exploits by mimicking Buffett in his own annual report) - don't
get seduced by the language. I'd go a step beyond Wayne, and call the company's
financials borderline fraud. Highly misleading, at the very least.

Mike follow up:tech staffing/outsourcing...

Syntel was definitely mentioned in previously mentioned CNBC Power Lunch piece
from 3/17. I believe Ciber was as well. That's all I can recollect...would love
to see a transcript or video of the piece on CNBC again...

The company recently took a one time $1.73 charge due to an aqusition/joint
venture
that didn't work out. Current book value is $4.30 with $1.05 in cash. They are
projecting .30 EPS for FY99. The company is more diversified than the typical
oil
services play, with subsidiaries in construction and waste management.

They have a current work order back log of $275 million with an additional $28
million
in recently announced new contracts.

From the recently filed 10K:

<<<<The Company, through its SRS subsidiary, has entered in four strategic
alliances
with established companies in Venezuela, France, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.
These alliances will enhance the
Company's ability to grow its other industrial support and specialty
fabrication business
internationally by providing the Company an international presence. Effective
January
1999, the Company established an international marketing group headed by Besim
Halef, a corporate Vice President.>

<Besim Halef has been Vice President of Marketing since January 1999, having
served
as the Division President of MM Industra since June 1996. Between April 1994
and
May 1996, Mr. Halef served as a project general manager for National Heavy
Industries Limited, Saudi Arabia in connection with a project to build
specialty
fabrication facilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Mr. Halef had served in
various
capacities at M&M Manufacturing Limited Partnership, the predecessor of MM
Industra, between 1985 and 1994, most recently as the Executive Vice President
and
General Manager of that company from March 1991 to April 1994.>>>>

At $1.50 per share ECGOF is trading at about 1/3 book value, has a forward PE
of 5
and has solid potential for revenue growth going forward.

I am concerned about the insurance operations. I agree that they had a very
poor 1998 and are generally not profitable from underwriting. Underwriting
profit is something I really like in the insurance/ investor model. A BRK the
company is not. But the investment management seems fine to very good and the
company has turned around other insurance operations they bought according to a
report I received. I need to research the matter further. The shareholder
letter is also quite open about the insurance risks and poor performance. The
main issues to me are valuation and the insurance. It is quite expensive right
now if you back out the capital gains and look just at earnings from
operations. So I'm not interested yet. But I don't think all these capital
gains reflect some sort of attempt at deception. My own investment portfolio
looks the same. I've been cashing out a lot of overvalued securities too. I
think management is just restructuring the portfolio in a way I agree with. I'm
not tossing in the towel just yet. It may still make my list of prospects.

My assets have been frozen!

I want to get this warning out. The portfolio that I run as the VSN fund at my
web site has been frozen, legally. I just attempted to switch that portfolio
from Citibank to E-trade. I have accounts in both places. Citibank, upon
getting the notice from E-trade, cancels my account. E-trade says the
securities won't be present on their end for a week or two! So I can't trade in
or out of any of my positions. And this is when I already have an open account
on the receiving end.

Part of me says thankfully I'm a value investor/long-term holder. I don't think
too much damage can be done by me not trading it for a week (except those
volatile Brazil positions, which I was evaluating today when I found out the
assets weren't there) or probably even a year. In fact, it might be for the
best. But ethically I feel this is reprehensible. If this is to happen, E-trade
should have it way up in bold somewhere. If I were a 1-2 day trader, I'd be
suing.

Just a warning,
Mike

Mike,

>> Assets frozen in transfer

This is *normal*. The transfer does take a couple
of weeks. If the receiving side were a full service
broker, they would allow you to trade under supervision,
e.g. sell the securities.

If you were a day-trader, you wouldn't be
transfering stock. ;-))) Money transfer is much faster.
Might have made a sense to sell the stock and to
rebuy it at E-trade.

Good luck

Jurgis

My understanding is that it is only supposed to take a couple days at most, not
over a week. I would just figure this would've been made obvious somewhere if
it's more than a day or two. Oh well.

Re; LWN. Short stock under 2? Didn't know you could. As to debt, if you want to
see how far down the tubes a near bankrupt company can go look at Hechinger
bonds at about 12(HECHH). I thought Leonard Green and his management team could
turn around this company but now it looks like I am wrong. I have received
dividends but that may also come to a halt.
If you are inclined to speculate on junk bonds look at JBAK. Yield to maturity
on short term bond should be about 20%, if company survives. Despite very
troubling inventory and receivable buildup they still have slightly positive
operating results.
Also on CPU, an interesting play is to write ratio calls(2/1) and get a reduced
basis on stock. CPU has leaps and I chose to write Jan 10 calls against the
stock. This is because I believe CPU will suffer some near term weakness when
their swollen inventory writeoffs come down to the quarterly results.

Re other beaten sectors. Like AG equipment makers,the fertilizer stocks are
very depressed. Best to stay with company that has potash, re Mississippi
Chemical(gro) is my favorite.
Also Canadian and oil well service, look at CE Franklin(cfk) for a company with
excellent management which should be very competitive when the commodity cycle
turns up.
