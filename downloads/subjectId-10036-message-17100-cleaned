Paul,

LDL - wow, that's a blast from the past. I remember looking at them ~5 years
ago, when they had pristine 20% ROE every year... What happened?

It shows that James Clarke was right about "Buffett traps" - some of these
high-ROE companies just drop into a hole and never (???) recover.

Is there a way to avoid them? Or to find when they finally recover? I would be
interested in good ideas... :-)

I like LDL at first sight. It seems to be a restructuring play. LDL has been
focusing on its core business and reduced debt from D/E .6 to .2. This trend is
very encouraging.

Some issues:
Pension gap about 10M$
CFO has left recently. (Which is an autoshort according to a very successful

I'll buy a little AIR here.

"AAR Corp. is an independent provider of value-added products and services to
the worldwide aviation industry," per Yahoo.

http://biz.yahoo.com/p/a/air.html

Prior to 9/11 AIR seems to have been a pretty decent company. There were
earnings, a dividend, and steadily rising book value. Sales had increased every
year from '93 to '00. That's all gone now. In addition, the balance sheet has
worsened (imo), because the debt/eq ratio has increased.

I just don't see the company returning to anywhere near its former glory. And
the stock... cigar butt territory imo.

I will buy AIR mostly based on a mechanistic approach. Price/sales is
relatively low, and stock is less than 1/2 of tangible book value (S&P number).
The stock price has averaged at least 1x book in every year since at least '93
(as far back as my records show.) But of course, "aviation" wasn't a dirty word
to investors then.

It appears to me the company's pretty aggressive in looking for and moving into
areas in the aviation/aerospace sector where they believe they can secure
profitable sales. Two positives from the latest quarterly:

"While we are encouraged by the improvement in our results, we are concerned
about the potential near-term effect on demand for parts and services in the
commercial aviation industry as a result of reduced passenger traffic caused by
economic uncertainties and the war in Iraq," said AAR President and CEO David
P. Storch. "However, longer term the airline industry must seek lower cost
solutions to survive, and we are well positioned to benefit as the airlines
move to lower cost maintenance and supply solutions."

and...

"Manufacturing segment sales increased 25.9% over third quarter last year
driven by higher sales of the Company's manufactured products that support the
U.S. Military's mobility requirements and increased sales of non-aviation
related composite structure products."

Another, only-a-small-position-for-me, stock.

$24.0 million at December 31, 2002."

Yahoo shows d/e =0 and bv. = $1.85/sh.

Market cap at today's close ($1.90) = $16.4M

They have a cost reduction plan underway (Who doesn't?), and maybe that can
stem losses.

MrCJ, thank you for your nice comment. My largest holding is ALVR now, trading
at 1.86 while cash at 3.14, book 4.36, and zero debt. Losing about 10c/Q, not
too bad, it is a leader in a niche market of Broadband Wireless Access. I
believe the company has a chance to be profitable in the next 12-18 months.
When that happened, it should be at $3-5.

 NTZ. Yes, sorry to see that. 

Well you can't say you have not been warned. The US$ has been deteriorating
further during the quarter and usually it takes about 3-6 month until a margin
compression is trickels through the supply and sales chain - based on that one
can only expect the next 2 quarters for NTZ to be much worse.

I established a position in LDL today - looking through the latest 10Q I am
pretty sure that this company will profit from the lower US$ and I hope that
this may help to get this stock up again.

I am still watching the regional banks and besides BNK I actually like NFB
more. NFB has a good capitalization ratio, a stellar efficiency (around 32%)
and apparently and high asset quality (0.2% loan losses). This seems to be one
of the best high quality growth plays in this sector. In the short term
however, the lower interest rates will squeeze the interest spread between the
deposits and the loans and this will put pressure on the earnings. I think the
last rally in regional bank stocks will falter for this reason and hope to get
in at lower prices soon.

Thanks for the heads up on EBSC. I sold the Dutch auction what, two or three
years ago. Couldn't resist buying a few thousand shares today at roughly the
same price I sold at before. Two bidders, one of them effectively saying
they're willing to pay more than $5, $18 of tangible book value. I was watching
posts on the stock on this site the last week and thinking - $10 - you're just
as naive as I was when I bought this piece of crap and put other people into it
three years ago, but then I saw the second bid and really looked at the balance
sheet and said hmm, maybe this time it works. I couldn't believe how easy this
was to buy at 5 today given the news on the tape.

Paul and those of you who have been on this thread for years will remember I
used to do net-nets with a lot of other criteria to only find the best of the
net-nets. EBSC is the only one I ever lost money on out of maybe 10 or 12

If all debt were to be backed out, then free cash flow would be $2.29/share, so
what would someone pay to get that amount of return on their investment? But
the cash flow's been better than $2.00 by this metric for the last two years

At least a few people here made good money on Hollywood Entertainment a couple

Hollywood (NasdaqNM:HLYW - News) and Netflix (NasdaqNM:NFLX - News)..."

Perhaps the model for these retailers is now broken? I ask because I bring to

Thanks, rhess, steve168, Wallace Rivers, Dave.

Rhess, I see those figures now at their site. Drives away what attracted me to
the stock.

Something must not be right with Yahoo numbers, or something has dramatically
changed financially at the company in the past couple of months.

http://biz.yahoo.com/fin/l/t/twmc_qb.html

This shows net current assets would be:
current assets: $595.7M
less total liabilities: 411.3M
= $184.4M

divided by Yahoo's 26.5M shares = $6.96/sh

Or even using TWMC's site's number of 38.9M shares (big diff. from Yahoo!)=
$4.74

2/3 of $4.74 = $3.13. That'd be the top Ben Graham net-net price to buy TWMC at
--- which the stock did trade at today. (note: There are those who would say
the the company must be profitable to qualify and this company is not now
profitable, thus does not qualify as a Graham net-net.)

I don't see the attraction of TWMC without the good financial numbers. OTOH, I
missed Hollywood Entertainment when the numbers looked okay there (offered some
safety). Although with HLWY, it was part of a downtrodden sector that garnered
good profits when the rental business quickly transitioned from VCR tapes to
CDs. I don't see what's going to be helping TWMC business at this point.
Indeed, the shorts apparently believe the business model won't work going
forward.

Thanks for the assist, guys. I'll pass on TWMC unless
some additional and positive info comes forward to evaluate.

I recommended ALVR here at 1.86 3 months ago while it was losing money, it is
still losing money today and closed at 3.46. My SINA bought at 1.5 a year ago
was losing money too, at the first break even quarter, it was above 6, today it

VICL is showing a great chart pattern, broke out to 8-month high Friday with

I think the smart money has and will continue to buy into the market, maybe
shifting money from the bonds. If this is true, this will be a long awaited new
bull market. The market will continue to move up until most average investors
see it up 10-15% more while their money is sitting on the sideline getting 1%
interest, or losing 3% in bonds, they will truly feel left out, the scare of
missing new bull market will drive them back. I am staying fully invested,

I passed on VICL. I don't understand anything about the business so I only have
looked cursorily at the numbers as a below-cash play.

There's $5/sh in cash. Maybe their burn rate is $1/sh/yr. (annualizing last
quarter's $5m loss) So they've got plenty of money maybe to go for four years
to come up with some products they can sell or joint-venture. And they have a
lot of stuff apparently. So that's all good.

OTOH, as a below-cash play, next year they'll have $4 sh/cash declining to
maybe $3/sh (??). To me that's not attractive when I looked at the stock price.
It was ~$4/sh.

Well, stock's at $4.71 now (and topped $5) today, so the market's telling me I
might've made the wrong decision here.

Buying more PXT today.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pxt&d=t

Doesn't show up on a search, but I'm pretty sure I mentioned it here at least
once before, in March or April.

Anyway, it's one of the worst of the reinsurers, imo. ROE fluctuates, earnings
are there then disappear, and book value goes up and down. So the p/e - when
there is one - is generally very low.

PXT (today's price: ~$19.75) is expected to earn about $4/sh. this year. I'll
bet they make it: premiums are up all over, and profits this quarter are okay
from what I can tell. I assume also there are only a normal number of
catastrophes that need to have been reserved for and were.

The p/e would be 5 if PXT does make the $4/sh. However, the way I'm seeing it,
that's only midway between a multiple of 4 and 6 where the stock has traded in
some years where there have been earnings.

Assuming written premiums can stay at the current level, PXT might be able to
put together a 2nd good year though, and as visibility gets closer to 2004, the
stock might trade higher on the expected '04 earnings. I hope to see a multiple
of 7 at some point. If so, I expect PXT trade at $28/sh.

I continue to chase small E&P stocks based on the well-known and expected
natural gas problem/shortage/price rise.

These stocks can turn in a blink, and they're dangerous because they've almost
all moved up substantially in price already. Many of these stocks have doubled
and tripled. The natural gas problem has to continue (and we know consumers are
resourceful in reducing demand or choosing alternate sources when a commodity
price goes up sharply), and there needs to be new stock buyers drawn into
buying these things. If Chairman Greenspan reports the problem on TV though,
it's not going to be the smart money that's waking up to the issues now. Maybe
it's just suckers (like me?) who are buying now while the smart money is
exiting?? I feel like I'm late to the party, and if I'm not careful or lucky
I'm going to be the person getting the bill for it.

notice that many E&P's look cheap based on current oil prices but earnings will

during the last few years because they constantly have to buy new reserves to
replace the depleting ones and with current higher oil prices those reserves
tend to be more expensive. Unless they have a very extensive hedge book they

drug trials. It has the cash to burn for another 4 years, I am taking a
calculated risk and willing to give them a try. I guess I just see the "value"
differently than some other people. I am perfectly happy to see some people
just think those cash-burning companies will continue to burn it to zero, they
gave up, throwing the baby out with the bath water, and that is usually the
best time to buy. Considering other people paid VICL for 20, 15, 10, it is a
steal for me at 4.

By the way, did you notice those under-cashed stocks were going up fast in the
past two months? people realized the value and buying them up. There will no
longer be many left in the next month or two.

Market took a dive before close, VICL stay up 10.6% for the day. Some big
buyers absorbed all shares selling at 4.65 and wanted more. It is a new

I agree with you about those tech companies. Some are below cash, and some have

I sit in awe of people who have made big bets on any one of these companies
based on cash value and an expectation that something positive eventually will
happen to the particular company. As you say about CPST, in business for years
and has never showed a profit. There are a lot like that.

This guy, Willard, has the right idea though, imo - build a basket. At first
glance, I like COMS in his list: I'm a little familiar with it, it's big, and
it's got tons of cash even though there are lots of shares out. It's been
profitable in past years (assuming one believes the numbers and management's
integrity then).

For a high-ROE & fallen angel, would you go for PFE?

I'm not sure it's fallen enough. ROE is high all right, but book value to price

Not sure what that means, but your post reminded me to check ECIL, a stock that

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=ecil&k=c1&t=5y&s=adct&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

Couple of years ago I was beaten up by ECIL's decline, but maybe now is a
possible buy point again. I do have the feeling though that it's lying in wait
for me to devour my money again.

ECIL is foreign domiciled (Israeli). OTOH, at under $3/sh. it's at half of
stated book value. It also has $3.38/sh in cash, according to Yahoo (although
d/e = .38). I'd say if it's still somewhat correlated to ADCT going forward, it
might also be somewhat less risky as well because of these aspects, and
therefore a better pick.

ADCT has no virtually LT debt, however it just placed a sizeable convertible
issue that is certainly not showing up in fundamental data on the company. That
said, the company has reasonably decent management and with the pending
acquisition of Allen Telecom, will have some decent products. The company has
also been developing new products in the wireless and cable categories. The
stock dipped a few days ago after the convertible issue was announced. It is
possible they are planning more small acquisitions as indicated by the
prospectus on the convert offering. Since this forum is on value investing,
ADCT would certainly qualify in that regard. After the past 3 years of
continued selling in telecom equipment stocks, as well as ADCT, it is hard to
see any weak holders remaining. Might be a real rebounder, just depends upon
the news of telecom turnaround and mood of the institutions.

Paul,

PFE. I have difficulty using ROE above 25% for any company as an expected "long
term ROE". It just seems that almost everything above 25% or even 20%
eventually crashes through the bottom. Using 25% ROE PFE is not a bargain with
predicted annual return of 6.5%. Even with 30% ROE it would earn only ~12% (I
buy at expected 15% return). Compare that to BMY which at current price and
expected 20% ROE shows 9% expected return. Yes, I know that PFE is much better
company, but how much better?

A related (?) story: I bought RTRSY at $17 and sold at $13 (now it's at $18
again). RTRSY had a ROE of 40-100% until the ROE crashed to 4.1% in 2001 and to
losses last year. At the same time equity dropped from $1800M to $800M and
expected return now even with 20% ROE (which is not guaranteed at all) is ~9%.
Is it worth buying? Remember Mike Burry had a solid case of buying it in the
40's, 30's and all the way down. I know he's smart and uses stops, so he
probably was not caught with a losing position. What I am trying to say is that
these high ROE falling angels may be very dangerous if optimistic assumptions
are used. I wonder if we are not still too optimistic about pharmas including
PFE and BMY.

OTOH, I may have been too pessimistic about RTRSY. I don't know. Other opinions
would be appreciated.

worthwhile to reenter RTRSY at any point in the future.

The issue for me is that I wonder if this thing is a value trap. It surely
seems to be for me since I've owned it. Also, there's KR and SWY that should be
considered (as competitors and as alternate investments). While I'm leaning to
add just a bit to ABS because it's dropped so much so quickly, I'm considering
whether the better bet might be SWY. Some analysts consider SWY the best

The discount to cash is narrowing for all these type stocks. (All that I see
anyway.) And of course, for many, many of these stocks, their prices now exceed
the cash they have.

It seems to me that if someone still wanted to be in this game (buying stocks
with no debt that are selling below cash value), by default, one is led to
biotechs. I've avoided these biotechs because many of the companies won't
survive, and it's a race between cash-burn and product development (sales or
royalty payments of some kind). I assume that buying these biotechs is a little
more risky than buying telecom, IT or other cash-rich business types where
there's a product that doesn't sell or a business model that doesn't work.
Because often the BOD and management eventually act to conserve cash or
liquidate, since they know they're not getting any more money from anyone.
Unlike the cash-rich biotech companies which seem to have two functions - doing
research and seeking out additional monies to fund that research. If they don't
get those additional monies, these biotechs go into a further tailspin.

Anyway, I'll follow your lead here Steve168, and move to some biotechs. I've
bought CRXL and PCYC this morning. As is my usual practice, I want to diversify
among a number of these things. Since these stocks have already doubled from
lows, I'm buying even fewer shares than I ordinarily would.

I have no technical expertise with biotechs whatsoever. For CRXL though I see
that a recent deal with Merck may reinforce and validate some of CRXL's
research, and will likely bring MRK monies to CRXL. (How much or how little was
not disclosed in the press release.)

And of course the horizon is always ahead with biotechs - the stocks can really
soar on investors' dreams.

I see ITG on your list, Paul. It is a company I have been following for some
time (but no position) and it has moved up quite rapidly in the last few weeks.
I did a presentation on ITG to my investment club this month and also noted the
strong ROE and margins. No debt. It strikes me as a former growth story which
is now a value play if one believes volume in the market will move up.

I believe ITG gets two cents a share on each side of the trade.

- Kris

ITG is an electronic trading firm whose primary asset is the Posit matching
system, also called "the match". Posit is a growing source of liquidity for
professional money managers. At a specified time each hour of the trading day,
investors can place a buy or a sell order into Posit. If someone has placed the
other side of the trade into Posit, the trade will occur midway between the bid
and the ask. If there is no one on the other side of the trade, the order is
canceled. It is a very useful method to purchase blocks of illiquid stocks
without moving the market and also a way to protect identity or size in a
stock.

Posit is a superior way to trade for most institutional investors, because it
is anonymous and it does not reveal position or order size to anyone in the
process. It may not be optimal for someone who specializes in trading blocks at
discount, but for the majority of investors, the ability not to reveal identity
or size is very valuable. It not only trades at a fair price, but much more
than other ECN's. Posit is designed to get size done.

per-diem basis. Keep receipts for your purchases. There IS a way to search for
untagged luggage by description.

Per my wife, the travel pro who knows these things. And she emphasizes,keep on
them. (Keep calling the airline.)

Ditto to your advice to Madharry.

OT? Investment performance calculation. After struggling for ages to evaluate
my investment performance, I seem to have found an OK method for now. Most
investment performance calculation methods are either difficult to perform or
inherently misleading or both (see for example, Munger's comments in Whitney
Tilson's writeup on WSC 2003 meeting:
http://www.tilsonfunds.com/wscmtg03notes.html) . All kind of IRRs, Quicken
graphs and reports as well as mutual fund provided measures don't work well in
accounts where money is added, withdrawn, etc.

Now, for my regular account there's too much money flow in/out to perform any
interesting calculation. OTOH, my IRA is nicely funded once a year with no
outflows. So I decided to do historical price search and see where I would have
ended up now if I invested the same inflows at the same exaxt dates into SP500,
TAVFX, CFIMX, LMVTX and other mutuals and never sold. Yahoo has historical
prices adjusted for dividends and splits (I don't guarantee their accuracy!).
So voila: plug in prices and compare my performance to any fund's (or stock's).
Not absolute performance measure, but a yardstick nonetheless. :-)

The results were surprising for me. I expected to be behind most of the funds
above. Actual results were much better. :-) So maybe I'll stick with stock
picking for a bit more. :-)

I'm interested in comments, suggestions and discussion from other people.

Jurgis - don't ask me to compare my performance to buy-and-hold-MSFT-or-BRK
(although I may do it for fun :-)))))

Jurgis Bekepuris. It's possibly just natural that every guy wants to know how
he compares to everyone else regarding performance. (Talking about stock market
performance and stock picking ability here -g-.)

If this market holds we'll soon be seeing adverts (again) for making 50% on
your money every month. Which, if you've just come in to the market since Oct.
or Jan., I'd guess has been do-able up to this point.

As you allude, there's also risk to be considered though. There have been some
mouth-watering gains in some of the stocks mentioned here - SINA amd other
dotcoms since they were cash plays, even airlines - AMR is up 7x from lows.
Imo, to make big bets just in such stocks would've been very risky, and the
reward not so certain.

Presumably one invests for a goal. So it's my opinion that if one is
progressing towards the goal in the way one plans/hopes/expects to, that is
good enough. So the person doesn't have to compare his/her performance to
others or to benchmarks. Which of course is hard not to do given our
competitive juices.

In any case, because how I envision you might invest (from your posts that I
read) - a combination of Buffett and Graham with a lot of discipline and
censoring (no insurance, no high-paid execs, etc.) - it's my guess you would be
doing at least okay against the benchmarks you've listed.

Small hedge fund setup help?

I have been in US stock market for 12 years and finished my investing model
(and program implementation) about 2 years ago. That model portfolio returned
+130% in the past two years. Over that time I told my friends/family about what
stocks I was buying, some of them made money after evaluated my ideas and
decided (on their own) to buy. One former college classmate and one former
co-worker (Unfortunately they are the only 2 Accredited Investors I know since
I came to US knowing nobody 13 years ago) trusted me enough now and said they
would commit some fund if I start a hedge fund. It is going to be small ($0.5-1
Million) in the beginning so I am concerned about the setup cost, as well as
management overhead such as accounting fees. Do you have some advice on low
cost setup?

1. I believe I will need to setup a LLC as the general partner, and LLP for my
investors to put money in. I will buy/sell stocks in LLP account. The LLC takes
1% management fee + 20% incentive (profit cut) from LLP. Is that right?

2. Do I need to file a quarterly tax report to IRS on the gain/loss of LLP
investing activity? or there are ways for me to do it annually (much
preferred)? I believe investors will receive a K-1 once a year for their own
tax preparation, right?

3. Any related websites, articles, ideas are greatly appreciated.

Thanks, Steve168

I think we had similar discussion before when Mike Burry was still here
regarding absolute performance advocated by Marty Whitman: 10% a year any year
(though I don't like that he abandoned his goal when the real bear struck) vs.
relative performance advocated by Bill Miller (he has beaten SP500 11
consecutive years now). Buffett is somewhere in the middle - he does not strive
for absolute yearly results, but definitely strives for outperformance and
long-term absolute performance.

Anyway, I don't have a goal. I want to invest so that my savings grow at OK
pace. Risk figures there somehow, though I don't think about it explicitly. I
know from experience that I can't time the market, so I don't do margin,
options, etc. anymore and I try to buy stocks in my circle of (in)competence
:-) with a margin of safety and expected high performance.

I would define "OK pace" as both Marty's 10% and as Bill Miller's outperform
SP500. This is a tough to achieve long term and impossible to achieve short
term. I would not check performance for 1,3,6 months or even 1-2 years. But I
think it is worthwhile to check 3-5-10 year performance. If it lagged my own
benchmarks significantly, I would not hesitate to stop stock picking and invest
into benchmarks instead. Benchmark selection is very personal thing. I use
SP500 and value funds, others may use what they prefer.

performance of this stock now regardless of all the past many good years of
high ROE and high margins this stock once had. (As we who bought in January
found out to our sorrow.)
Still, it might be a good buy if, as you say, "one believes volume in the

that will happen this year though. But who knows?

Still holding my URS shares. Some updates follow:

I sold 3/8 of my position in thread favorite, BAMM, on today's pop. (Not a
valuation call; I just got tired of holding and waiting.)

In past couple of days I scared myself out of 1/3 of my shares of DCX. Also
about 1/2 of gaming stock MGG.

I added to exploratory position LH after it received a brokerage downgrade a
couple days back.

I've been working on establishing a very small position in thinly-traded
real-estate operating company AQQ. I like the insider buying. (Risky stock. The
company is losing money as it tries to nail-down what its core business is and
what its geographical focus will be.)

I added to small position in crum-bum managed THC. This hospital sector looks
relatively inexpensive to me. I've started a position in TRI. Here's a company
with okay p/e (10-11 expected this year, per Yahoo); l4 of 19 analysts with buy
or strong buy on the stock (This could be a negative! -g-); and selling below
stated book value. There's not a long period of public history that I see, but
it looks like p/sales has come down, possibly to reflect reduction in medicare
payments. I notice several value investors have (or had) positions in the
stock, viz. Sound Shore, Ruane,Cuniff. I assume there's competition among
hospitals, but I also assume there are barriers to entry in the business.
Regardless of government payments/rules/regs it seems like hospitals will still
be in demand, and its hard to see how foreign competition can hurt them
(although some elective surgeries might be done cheaper outside the USA).

jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

Comments welcome regarding these stocks.

Steve,

Good job on Vical! I will opine, however, that its rise is in tandem with the
biotech sector as a whole and the cancer research stocks (largely due to
Imclone's recent announcement) specifically rather than investors seeing it as
a value play.

Do not get me wrong, I invest in both value and growth companies, and have come
close to investing in Vical several times. I just would not call it a value
stock when the burn rate (net loss) is so high.

It is all sematics, however. Value or growth, when you are making money it is a
good thing! Congratulations!

Paul,

LH looks VERY good. But the insiders are selling quite a bit, which causes a
need for a very close look. Compensation seems high also, but I all else looks
good. I like the industry also. I want to own this one, after a brief review on
my part, but I need to look deeper. I hope I don't wait too long.

I just bought JAKK. They make toys. Actually they have them manufactured --
overseas, of course. They sell to Target, Toys R Us, Wal-Mart, etc.
Compensation seems a bit high here too, but sales growth history, profit
history, outlook, and stock price all seem quite nice.

I began avoiding Texas based companies and people after the S&L crisis of the
80's. Have not completely gotten away from them, but found the heuristic
valuable again last year. Particularly dangerous are companies based in Dallas
IMO. If any froth is to be found, it will be there. Big-shotism.

I also try to stay away from companies which leverage human skills rather than
land or capital. Particularly creative skills like advertising or software
development. Engineering firms like Fluor, Stone and Webster, et al don't
usually do very well for very long because if profits become available, they go
into compensation of employees until the next bust when once again, the company
is up against the ropes and cutting people.

Oil can fall into both categories though I do maintain some Apache Oil so that
I have exposure to the most conservative (I hope) of oil based stocks.

Avoids:

- Excessive executive compensation
- Excessive options or "pro-option" fighting management (Intel)
- Banks, insurance, hospitals, almost all energy stocks, some services
- Indication of management dishonesty or fraud unless it is dealt with
decisively (watching "new" SGP).
- "Opaque" country based companies: Bermuda, China, Latin America (there are
exceptions, but the bar is definitely raised if a company is in one of these
countries).
- High debt levels (this is semi-valuation based).
- Complicated company structure or operational structure (again not a definite
avoid, just raises the bar).

These are all non-valuation based avoids. Although I probably forget something.
